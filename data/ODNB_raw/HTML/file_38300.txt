<span class="headword">Stebbing,  Thomas Roscoe Rede</span>  (1835&#150;1926), <span class="occ">zoologist and Church of England clergyman</span>, was born on 6 February 1835 in Euston Square, London, the fourth son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26337/', "Henry Stebbing (1799&#150;1883)")</script>, clergyman and long-time editor of <span class="italic">The Athenaeum</span>, and his wife, Mary Griffin (1805&#150;1882). He was educated at King's College School and at King's College, London (BA, 1855), and matriculated at Lincoln College, Oxford, in 1853. Soon afterwards he entered Worcester College, graduating BA in 1857 and MA in 1859. For a time, about 1859, he held masterships at Radley College and at Wellington College. Until he resigned his fellowship at Worcester in 1868 he was fellow (1860&#150;68), tutor (1865&#150;7), vice-provost (1865), and dean (1866) of the college. He was ordained by Samuel Wilberforce, bishop of Oxford, in 1859.<br>
<br>Stebbing aptly called himself &#145;a serf to natural history, principally employed about Crustacea&#146;  (<span class="italic">WWW</span>, 1916&#150;28, 991). However, his studies of natural history began relatively late, in 1863, when he was employed as a tutor in Reigate. There he met the entomologist William Wilson Saunders (1809&#150;1879), whose daughter Mary Anne (1845&#150;1927) he married in 1867. After their marriage Thomas and Mary Anne Stebbing (who was herself a capable botanist and illustrator) moved to Torquay. There Stebbing continued his career as tutor and schoolmaster and, influenced by the naturalist William Pengelly, also began to write on Darwinism, natural history, and theology. His first paper on Crustacea dates from 1873; a year later he began to study the amphipod Crustacea, a group on which he specialized for the rest of his life, becoming the ranking authority on the group. His work was recognized by fellowships in the Linnean Society (1895) and the Royal Society (1896) and by the gold medal of the Linnean Society (1908). Moving to Tunbridge Wells in 1877, Stebbing gave up full-time teaching in favour of natural history and writing.<br>
<br>The majority of Stebbing's scientific writings deals with the taxonomy of amphipod Crustacea, on which he published more than 110 papers. On the recommendation of the naturalist Canon A. M. Norman, Stebbing monographed the Amphipoda collected on the voyage of HMS <i>Challenger</i>, using the resulting publication (1888) to provide an extensive annotated bibliography of the group and a definitive history of its classification, including the original definition of each genus. In a brief discussion he showed how small variations could account for the evolutionary radiation of the group. In a later monograph (1906), he provided a brief synopsis of the gammaridean Amphipoda that was not superseded until the 1950s. Also among his major works are a biography of the Scottish naturalist David Robertson (1891), a general natural history of the Crustacea (1893), and a monograph on the crustacean order Cumacea (1913).<br>
<br>Stebbing was an early and enthusiastic convert to Darwinism. Originally an evangelical Anglican, he was convinced by the arguments in the <span class="italic">Origin</span> and issued a series of polemical writings, beginning with the book <span class="italic">Essays on Darwinism</span> (1871), supporting Darwinian evolution by natural selection, and becoming increasingly unorthodox in his religious beliefs through the years. His later books <span class="italic">Faith in Fetters</span> (1919) and <span class="italic">Plain Speaking</span> (1926) used the rationality of Darwinism to account for the origin of human behaviour and morality and to criticize tenets of the established church, including the literal truth of <span class="roman">Genesis</span>, the doctrine of the Trinity, the divinity of Jesus, many of the <span class="roman">Thirty-Nine Articles</span>, miracles, and the accuracy of prophecy. Religion, in Stebbing's view, had to be consistent with the logic of science, but its roots were transcendental, emanating from a god of love and unselfishness. Forbidden a parish because of his outspoken views, Stebbing none the less left an important legacy of scientific work and early Darwinian essays, expressing his passion for natural history and the creator of the natural world in formidably rational and lucent prose for nearly sixty years. He died at his home, Ephraim Lodge, The Common, Tunbridge Wells, on 8 July 1926, and was buried in the borough cemetery there on the 13th.<br>
