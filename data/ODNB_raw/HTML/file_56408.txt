<span class="headword">Barrow,  John Henry</span>  (1796&#150;1858), <span class="occ">journalist and writer</span>, was born on 4 January 1796 in Cheapside, London, the sixth of the ten children of Charles Barrow (1759&#150;1826) of Bristol, a partner with his father-in-law in a firm of musical instrument makers, and his wife, Mary (1771&#150;1851), daughter of Thomas Culliford and his wife, Mary. In 1801 Charles Barrow entered the navy pay office and rapidly became chief conductor of moneys in town, a position he systematically abused by embezzling over &pound;5500. In 1810 he had to seek permanent refuge from English law in Douglas on the Isle of Man. Details of John Barrow's formal education have proved elusive, but Dickens was to describe him in November 1845 as &#145;an excellent scholar&#146;, capable of translating from both the French and Italian newspapers  (<span class="italic">Letters of Charles Dickens</span>, 4.434). He built on the experiences of his youth in his two collections of poems and songs from the Manx tradition: <span class="italic">Manks Legends</span> (1818), of which no copy is known to survive, and <span class="italic">The Mona Melodies</span> (1820).<br>
<br>From his appointment in 1819 as reporter for <span class="italic">The Times</span> in the ecclesiastical and maritime courts at Doctors' Commons, J. H. Barrow became, in his own words, &#145;one of the most extensive contributors of my day to the Political and Literary Journals, Reviews and Periodicals of the Metropolis&#146;  (Royal Literary Fund archives). His reporting of the trial of Queen Caroline for that paper in 1820 increased his reputation as a shorthand writer. Admitted to Gray's Inn in 1823, Barrow was called to the bar in 1828 but never practised. On 16 August 1817 he had married Kitty Collins (1791/1794&#150;1864) at St George's, Hanover Square. The marriage was childless, and Barrow left her in 1828 for Lucina Arabella Fidelia Pocock (1804/5&#150;1851), daughter of Major Luke Pocock; they had ten children, six of whom survived their father.<br>
<br>Barrow founded and edited the <span class="italic">Mirror of Parliament</span> in 1828 as a rival to <span class="italic">Hansard</span>. It purported to provide a full record of the debates in both houses of parliament, and to this end, he employed his nephew Charles Dickens as a gallery reporter and general assistant (1831&#150;4), thereby considerably advancing Dickens's journalistic career. Barrow petitioned unsuccessfully for official recognition of the <span class="italic">Mirror of Parliament</span> in May 1834; the <span class="italic">Mirror</span> lost its fight with <span class="italic">Hansard</span> and ceased publication in 1841. Barrow estimated that he lost &pound;5000 by the venture. Both he and his journal received a posthumous tribute from Gladstone who asserted, during a Commons debate in April 1877, that: &#145;I do not hesitate to say, that Barrow's <span class="italic">Mirror of Parliament</span> is the primary record, and not <span class="italic">Hansard's Debates</span>, because of the greater fullness which Barrow aimed at and obtained&#146;  (<span class="italic">Hansard 3</span>, 233, 1877, 1576&#150;7).<br>
<br>Barrow was the leader writer for the <span class="italic">Morning Herald</span> (1839&#150;42), <span class="italic">The Sun</span> (1842&#150;5), and the <span class="italic">Hampshire Advertiser</span> (1848&#150;55). He was appointed Indian correspondent for the <span class="italic">Daily News</span> (1846&#150;7), and arrived in Calcutta in January 1846, shortly after the outbreak of the First Anglo-Sikh War. His first dispatch, printed in February, gave an account of the battles of Mudki and Ferozeshahr, and in March he reported the defeat of the Sikhs at Aliwal. Later dispatches were sent from Bombay and China. He had never restricted himself to journalism, however; he also wrote <span class="italic">Emir Malek, the Prince of Assassins</span> (1827), a historical novel of the thirteenth century, published anonymously, and the text to accompany Thomas Landseer's engravings in <span class="italic">Characteristic Sketches of Animals, Principally from the Zoological Gardens, Regent's Park</span> (1832).<br>
<br>In his final year Barrow experienced severe financial distress and on 2 March 1858 he applied for assistance from the Royal Literary Fund. In his submission he reported that in the previous year, while engaged on the preparation of a work to be entitled &#145;Memoirs of the professional life and times of the editor of the Mirror of Parliament&#146;, which sadly was never published if indeed it was ever completed, he had contracted:<blockquote>a combined Malady that has ever since disabled me from all possibility of completing my outstanding engagements or undertaking new ones. I can neither write, except at the cost of intolerable pain, with my own hand or read, owing to the position required for either pursuit. (Royal Literary Fund archives)</blockquote>The general committee of the fund voted him &pound;50 on 10 March, a bequest which &#145;shed a gleam of sunshine over the clouded and inauspicious end&#146; to his career  (Royal Literary Fund archives). Nevertheless Barrow died of liver disease on 29 March 1858 at his home, 18 Francis Street, Newington, London. He was buried on 3 April at Norwood cemetery in a common grave, near Lucina Pocock, who had been interred there in May 1851. After his death his widow, who had been ignorant of his whereabouts, herself appealed for aid from the fund and received an award of &pound;25. She had previously been receiving financial assistance from friends, including Charles Dickens. She died in Clerkenwell on 9 March 1864.<br>
