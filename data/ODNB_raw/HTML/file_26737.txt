<span class="headword">Stubbes <span class="st"> [Stubbs]</span>,  Philip</span>  (<em>b. </em><em>c.</em>1555, <em>d.</em> in or after 1610), <span class="occ">pamphleteer</span>, is likely to have been born in the reign of Mary I. A native of Cheshire, his family may have come from the Congleton area, where the surname was common and where, before 1586, he seems to have owned a tenement. Although he styled himself &#145;gentleman&#146; in his published works, it is unclear if this was merely literary and social pretension. Suggestions that he was related to John Stubbs, author of <span class="italic">The Discoverie of a Gaping Gulf</span> (1579), are probably mistaken  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 1.646). Stubbes was a pious youth, and &#145;in his minority&#146; had apparently been employed as a lay reader in his local parish church  (<span class="italic">Works of Thomas Nashe</span>, 3.357). According to Anthony Wood, he was educated initially at Cambridge, but &#145;having a restless and hot head, left that university, rambled thro' several parts of the nation, and settled for a time in Oxon, particularly &hellip; in Gloster Hall&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 1.645). However, his name occurs in the records of neither institution and elsewhere he is said to have been &#145;nourst up onely at Grammer schoole&#146;  (Cuthbert Cunny-catcher, sig. C4v).<br>
<br>Stubbes's career as a semi-professional author seems to have begun in the 1580s and by the end of that decade Gabriel Harvey and Thomas Nashe reputed him one of the &#145;common Pamfletters of London&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works of Gabriel Harvey</span>, 2.280) and grouped him with William Elderton, Thomas Deloney, and other ballad-mongers who plied their pens to eke out a living. His first publication was a broadside ballad about the divine judgment which had befallen a habitual swearer from Boothby in Lincolnshire; this was reprinted in 1581 with a secondary cautionary tale relating to one Joan Bowser of Donington, Leicestershire (<span class="italic">Two Wunderfull and Rare Examples</span>, 1581). A list of witnesses to the latter incident survives in BL, Lansdowne MS 819, fol. 87<i>r</i>. Religious and moralistic in character, Stubbes's other works are equally typical of the output of the hack writers of the capital. They include a metrical jeremiad entitled <span class="italic">A View of Vanitie, and Allarum to England, or, Retrait from Sinne</span> (1582, now lost), a jingoistic account of <span class="italic">The Intended Treason of Doctor Parrie</span> ([1585]), a fiercely anti-Catholic attack upon <span class="italic">The Theater of the Popes Monarchie</span> (1585), and two tiny volumes of meditations and prayers, <span class="italic">The Rosarie of Christian Praiers and Meditations</span> (1583, also no longer extant) and <span class="italic">A Perfect Pathway to Felicitie</span> (1592).<br>
<br>Stubbes's best-known book is <span class="italic">The Anatomie of Abuses</span> (1583), a colourful diatribe against contemporary fashions, customs, and pastimes which called for a speedy &#145;reformation of maners and amendement of lyfe&#146;  (sig. &para;4<i>v</i>) in order to avert a visitation of providential wrath. This took the form of a highly readable dialogue between Philoponus and Spudeus about the &#145;verie famous Ilande called Ailgna&#146;  (title-page), a device which allowed Stubbes to indulge in a rich, quasi-anthropological description of late sixteenth-century English society. The instant success of this book (four editions of which were published before 1595), induced him to produce a sequel subtitled <span class="italic">The Display of Corruptions</span>, a taxonomical analysis of the vices of various professions and estates. The uncompromising assault upon dancing, May games, plays, wakes, and other popular recreations which Stubbes launched in the first part of the <span class="italic">Anatomie</span> earned him an enduring reputation as a puritan spoilsport and killjoy. Cuthbert Cunny-catcher (perhaps Robert Greene) and Thomas Nashe accused him of being a &#145;holy brother&#146; and &#145;privy Martinist&#146; (Cuthbert Cunny-catcher, sig. C4<i>v</i>; <span class="italic">Works of Thomas Nashe</span>, 3.358) but their remarks were made in the context of the scurrilous literary squabbles unleashed by the Marprelate controversy of 1588&#150;9, and cannot be taken at face value. Stubbes was certainly no presbyterian: he staunchly defended the established church and the office of bishop and sharply reproved &#145;precisians&#146; and separatists. It is difficult to fathom the depth of his piety and it seems likely that he was motivated by a combination of financial necessity, ambition, and religious zeal.<br>
<br>The dedications to his works suggest that Stubbes moved in a variety of circles: Mr and Mrs William Milward bore &#145;the whole charges&#146; of printing his <span class="italic">Perfect Pathway</span>  (sig. &para;4<i>r</i>), and he acknowledged that he had received &#145;bountifull remuneration&#146; from the suspected Catholic Philip Howard, earl of Arundel, to whom he presented both parts of his <span class="italic">Anatomie</span>  (<span class="italic">The Second Part of the Anatomie of Abuses, Conteining The Display of Corruptions</span>, 1583, sig. A4<i>r</i>). The Latin verses on the &#145;Papist Bloodsuckers or Leeches&#146; by Stubbes which prefaced the 1583 edition of John Foxe's <span class="italic">Actes and Monuments</span> imply more than a passing acquaintance with the martyrologist. In September of 1586 Stubbes, described as &#145;Gentleman, of St Mary at Hill, London&#146;  (Foster, 1300), was licensed to marry Katherine Emmes of the same parish, with whom he moved to Burton upon Trent, Staffordshire. Her untimely death at the age of nineteen led Stubbes to write a best-selling biography of his godly bride, <span class="italic">A Christal Glasse for Christian Women</span> (1591). At least twenty-eight impressions of this pamphlet appeared to 1664 and, an excellent example of the protestant <i>ars moriendi</i>, it became one of the most popular chapbooks of the late seventeenth century.<br>
<br>By 1593 Stubbes was once again living in London, from whence he set out on a three-month tour of England on horseback to acquaint himself with &#145;the maners and dispositions of the people&#146; and to inspect schools, almshouses, highways, and other monuments erected by private benefactors. This journey, which was undertaken &#145;partly for my private pleasure and recreation&#146; and &#145;partly for avoidance of the plague&#146;, supplied Stubbes with the material for his <span class="italic">Motive to Good Workes</span>, published in that same year, a lengthy lament for the passing of an age of charity and hospitality in which he documented the decay of churches and many other public amenities. On 8 November of that year he was &#145;lodging by Cheape side&#146;  (Stubbes, <span class="italic">Motive to Good Workes</span>, sigs. A3<i>v</i>, A6<i>r</i>). He appears to have been alive in 1610, when a revised version of his <span class="italic">Perfect Pathway</span> was republished, incorporating fifteen additional prayers. Thereafter he cannot be traced.<br>

<a name="cosubject_46924"></a><span class="headword">Katherine Stubbes <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Emmes]</span></span>  (1570/71&#150;1590)<span class="occ"></span> was the daughter of a Dutch woman whose maiden name is unknown and William Emmes, cordwainer of the parish of St Dunstan-in-the-West and a freeman of the city of London. The youngest but one of six children, she inherited property on the death of her father late in 1583 and at the age of fifteen was married to Philip Stubbes. The contemporary suggestion that Stubbes cynically insinuated himself into the young heiress's affections is unsubstantiated and probably slanderous. According to her husband's pious account of her life, Katherine was &#145;a perfect paterne of true Christianitie&#146; and &#145;a mirrour of womanhood&#146;. Modest, virtuous, and an avid reader of the scriptures, she prophesied her own death from postnatal complications following the birth of a son, and passed away after making &#145;a most heavenly confession&#146; of the protestant faith and struggling heroically against the temptations of Satan  (Stubbes, <span class="italic">Christal Glasse</span>, sigs. A2<i>r</i> and title-page). It is difficult to disentangle the historical person Katherine Stubbes from the paragon she became in a text heavily conditioned by generic convention. The parish registers of St Modwen's, Burton upon Trent, confirm the baptism of John Stubbes on 17 November 1590 and the burial of Katherine on 14 December.<br>
