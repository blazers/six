<span class="headword">Maidment,  James</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1793, <em>d.</em> 1879), <span class="occ">antiquary</span>, was born in London and baptized in St Swithin's parish on 26 October 1793, the son of James Maidment, a solicitor, of Chase Side, Middlesex, and his wife, Jean or Jane Ann Woolley. His father was descended from a Northumberland family, and an ancestor of his mother was the Dutch patriot John van Olden Barneveldt.<br>
<br>Following attendance at arts and law classes at Edinburgh University between 1810 and 1816, Maidment was called to the Scottish bar on 17 June 1817. He soon took a high position as an advocate in cases involving genealogical inquiry, and was much engaged in disputed peerage cases. On general legal cases he was also much consulted, and his written pleadings in the court of session were models of their type. His written style was held to be far superior to his verbal performances. He married Isabella Jane Stewart or Stuart (1820&#150;1862) and with her had two children, a son, James John Barneveldt (<i>d</i>. 1884), and a daughter, Blanche Wilhelmina Grace (<i>d</i>. 1875). The death of his daughter at the age of fifteen affected him greatly: it is said that he never left his house after this event.<br>
<br>Maidment early showed a taste for antiquarian and historical research, and it was mainly this that led to his friendship with Sir Walter Scott, Charles Kirkpatrick Sharpe, and other men of letters. His publications, mainly of editions of Scottish historical, literary, genealogical, and antiquarian material, were very numerous. Many were anonymous, and as most were privately printed in small editions, some at least for their bawdy or erotic content, they soon became rarities. A more or less comprehensive annotated list of seventy-nine items was issued with memoirs reprinted from contemporary newspaper obituaries in 1883, by Thomas George Stevenson, who, with his father John before him, had in fact published most of them. The most substantial of Maidment's works was one of the last, <span class="italic">Dramatists of the Restoration</span> (14 vols., 1872&#150;9), in the editorship of which he was assisted by William Hugh Logan. Titles of some others demonstrate the main areas of his productions: <span class="italic">Reliquiae Scoticae: Scotish Remains in Prose and Verse</span> (1828); <span class="italic">Fragmenta Scoto-dramatica, 1715&#150;1758</span> (1835); <span class="italic">Analecta Scotica</span> (2 vols., 1834&#150;7); <span class="italic">Court of Session Garland</span> (1839); <span class="italic">A Book of Scotish Pasquils, 1568&#150;1715</span> (1868); <span class="italic">A Packet of Pestilent Pasquils</span> (1868). He also edited works for the Spottiswoode Society and for the Maitland, Abbotsford, Hunterian, and Bannatyne clubs. At his death, he was the only remaining founder member of the last named club. To support these literary activities, Maidment built up a library of over 5000 titles, plus a fine collection of prints. He is believed to have sold part of his library anonymously in 1869 at a London sale. He died at his home, 25 Royal Circus, Edinburgh, on 24 October 1879, and was buried in the Dean cemetery on 31 October. The auction, in 5059 lots, of what books he possessed at the time of his death, was undertaken by Thomas Chapman &amp; Son in Edinburgh, in April and May 1880. The sale occupied fifteen sessions and raised about &pound;4500. The 1883 Stevenson bibliography reprints a detailed account of these sales, taken from <span class="italic">The Scotsman</span> newspaper. Lord Crawford purchased Maidment's peerage collections privately in July 1880, and some at least of these are held by the National Library of Scotland. Other goods were sold later in the year.<br>
