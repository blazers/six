<span class="headword">Vizard,  William</span>  (1774&#150;1859), <span class="occ">lawyer</span>, born in Dursley, Gloucestershire, was the second of the six sons and four daughters of William Vizard (<i>d</i>. 1807) and his wife, Ann (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Phelps). Both the Vizard and the Phelps families had been well-established landowning families in Gloucestershire for a century or more. William Vizard senior was a solicitor, practising in Dursley. Two sons were articled to him and joined the Dursley firm, while William was sent to London after completing his education at school in Gloucester.<br>
<br>In 1790 Vizard was articled to Thomas Lewis of 12 Gray's Inn Square. Five years later he was admitted a solicitor and in 1797 he established his own practice at 7 Holborn Court. Thomas Creevey, a barrister then practising in the court of chancery, had chambers in the same building. Creevey had connections with the whig party and he became a personal client of Vizard, providing him with introductions to prominent whig lawyers and politicians, including Henry (later Lord) Brougham.<br>
<br>Brougham was to be a most significant influence in Vizard's life, as a client, a friend, and a patron. From 1807 until 1812 the two worked together as counsel and solicitor, presenting the case in parliament, on behalf of the merchants of Liverpool and Manchester, for the repeal of the 1807 orders in council.<br>
<br>Vizard soon became closely involved in whig politics. In 1812 he accompanied the distinguished whig lawyer Samuel Romilly to Bristol to seek election there&#151;unsuccessfully in the event&#151;and from then on he was active in the whig party machine.<br>
<br>In 1811 Vizard married Mary Hodges and, leasing some 30 acres of land in Dulwich from Dulwich College, he commissioned the building of Kingswood Lodge (later known as Kingswood House) where the Vizard family lived until 1831. The Vizards had two sons: William, educated at Eton College and Trinity College, Cambridge, who became a barrister and later registrar in the court of bankruptcy; and Henry Brougham, educated at Blackheath School and Trinity College, Cambridge, who became a clergyman. There were also two daughters, Frances and Caroline, the latter named after a significant client.<br>
<br>At some point between 1811 and 1813 Vizard was, at Brougham's suggestion, appointed solicitor to Caroline, then princess of Wales. Estranged from the prince regent, Caroline spent the years between 1814 and 1820 travelling in Europe. Vizard's work for her did not become onerous until she returned to London in June 1820 when her husband succeeded to the throne, following the death of George III in January that year.<br>
<br>Determined that she should not be queen, the new king, George IV, instructed the government to introduce to parliament a bill of pains and penalties to dissolve the marriage. It was Vizard's task to organize the queen's defence during the second reading of the bill in the House of Lords&#151;known as the trial of Queen Caroline&#151;which took place between August and November 1820. Vizard himself announced the government's withdrawal of the bill from the balcony of the House of Lords to the crowd supporting the queen. Caroline's death in August 1821 ended three years of intensive activity on her behalf by Vizard, who continued for some time to be occupied with settling her estate for her executors.<br>
<br>Vizard's connections with Caroline and the whigs brought him many aristocratic and wealthy clients for whom he conducted much litigation in the court of chancery. His expertise in the court's proceedings was recognized in 1824 when he gave extensive evidence to the commission investigating the court and the delays for which it was then notorious. In the 1830s he came to be regarded similarly as an expert on parliamentary practice, particularly the committee procedures for private bills.<br>
<br>When Henry Brougham became lord chancellor in 1830, Vizard was appointed to his private office as secretary of bankrupts, the first solicitor ever to hold the office. Surviving evidence (in the Brougham papers) suggests that he played a significant role in the reform of the bankruptcy system carried out by Brougham. Vizard continued to hold the post of secretary of bankrupts in succeeding whig administrations, from 1835 to 1841 and from 1846 to 1852. He was also, for a time, solicitor to the secretary of state for the Home Office, combining all these official appointments with a large professional practice.<br>
<br>&#145;Great zeal, promptitude and ability&#146; were the qualities attributed to Vizard by his obituarist (in the <span class="italic">Solicitors' Journal</span>) and it seems that he was also not lacking in business sense. In the 1830s he bought the Hoyland Hall estate, near Sheffield, from the earl of Mulgrave (a whig associate and a friend) and in the 1840s Vizard was instrumental in the development there of the Hoyland Silkstone colliery. In 1831 he sold the family's Dulwich home and bought a house and estate at Little Faringdon, Oxfordshire. After the death of his first wife in 1833, he married his second wife, Mary Cipriani, who outlived him; there was one child, a daughter named Anne, of this marriage. Vizard was professionally active until the early 1850s, managing his practice and being involved with the early development of the Law Society. In retirement he enjoyed country pursuits until his death at Little Faringdon on 15 January 1859. He was buried in his home town, Dursley, nominated through his influence in 1832 as the returning place for MPs for West Gloucestershire. The firm he founded continues to practise in London.<br>
