<span class="headword">Tilley, Sir  John</span>  (1813&#150;1898), <span class="occ">Post Office administrator</span>, was born on 20 January 1813 in Peckham, Surrey, the son of John Tilley, merchant, and his wife, Elizabeth, daughter of Thomas Fraser. After being educated at a private school in Bromley, Kent, Tilley in 1829 was appointed a clerk in the General Post Office in London, partly on the basis of family connections with Sir Francis Freeling, its secretary. For the next five decades the bureaucracy which Tilley had entered was to provide the central focus of his life, both personal and professional. There he became a confidant of Anthony Trollope, who joined the Post Office in 1834. The relationship was further strengthened by Tilley's marriage to Trollope's sister Cecilia in 1839; she died of consumption in 1849. Tilley's subsequent marriages also ended sadly. Both Mary Anne Partington, a first cousin of Trollope's, whom Tilley married in 1850, and Susan Montgomerie (<i>d</i>. 1880), whom he married in 1861, predeceased him. These marriages produced two sons and one daughter.<br>
<br>Tilley's professional life was to lead to happier outcomes. Indeed, he was the fastest rising man of his generation at St Martin's-le-Grand. In 1838 he was appointed surveyor for a district in northern England, thus gaining the field experience regarded by many as a prerequisite for promotion. In 1848 he returned to London as assistant secretary. In 1864, on the retirement of Sir Rowland Hill, he became secretary and, in effect, director of the largest business in the United Kingdom.<br>
<br>When Tilley joined the Post Office in 1829, it had the reputation of being a somewhat sleepy organization, its City headquarters removed from other government departments and its management often more interested in its revenue-collecting function than in public service. Yet Tilley was to see and to oversee major transformations in how the department conceived its purpose and how it conducted its business. From the 1830s on railways and steamships quickly emerged as the chief means of mail conveyance, raising difficult contractual questions. In 1840 the agitation of Hill and Robert Wallace bore fruit in the penny post. The mid-century decades were to experience the first waves of labour agitation inside the department, civil service reform, and the coming of new services: Post Office Savings Banks in 1861, the sale of life insurance in 1864, and postcards and a nationalized telegraph system under departmental control in 1870. Another way of gauging this growth is to note that between 1864 and 1880&#151;Tilley's years as secretary&#151;the number of letters conveyed increased from 650 million to 1000 million, gross revenue from &pound;3.8 million to &pound;7.8 million, and net revenue (profit) from &pound;0.9 million to &pound;2.6 million.<br>
<br>Tilley should by no means be given all the credit for this record of expansion and change: in part it was the natural outcome of a growing economy. It also was the result of policies of reformers such as Hill, whom Tilley disliked; and he was often opposed to such progressive schemes. A traditionalist, Tilley consistently held that civil service examinations would allow candidates with academic training&#151;but without the necessary personal qualities&#151;to enter government service. Further, he initially objected to the idea of a state-managed telegraph system, and, when the department assumed control, he allowed Frank Ives Scudamore, the second secretary, who had led the campaign for take-over, a free hand in its management.<br>
<br>Displaying a tough-minded pragmatism, Tilley brought a real concern for the needs of the nation to his direction of departmental affairs. Whether negotiating with shipping companies or dealing with staff unrest, his goal remained to ensure the best possible outcome for the public and the Post Office. The two were virtually identical in his mind, and it was not simply a question of winning ideological battles. Without question, his approach contributed to a broad, if temporary, consensus that the Post Office was the best-administered government department.<br>
<br>In 1880 Tilley became KCB and retired on full pay. He remained active in public and charitable activities, including service as a JP and as chairman of the Eastern Hospital, London. He died from old age on 18 March 1898 at his home, 73 St George's Square, London.<br>
