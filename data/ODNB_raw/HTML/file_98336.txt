<span class="headword">Cavenagh, Sir  (William) Orfeur</span>  (1820&#150;1891), <span class="occ">army officer and colonial governor</span>, was born at Hythe, Kent, on 8 October 1820, the third of five sons and fourth of seven children of James Gordon Cavenagh (1766&#150;1844), army surgeon, and his wife, Ann (<i>d</i>. 1846), daughter of Odiarne Coates, of Grene Court, New Romney, Kent. The Cavenagh family had been landed gentry in co. Kildare and then co. Wexford, Ireland, with a recent tradition of service in the armed forces. After training at the East India Company's college at Addiscombe, Cavenagh joined an Indian regiment of the Bengal army. In the Gwalior and Sutlej campaigns of the mid-1840s he was twice seriously wounded and lost part of his left leg. Meanwhile, on 7 September 1842 he had married Elizabeth Marshall Moriarty, daughter of Lieutenant James Moriarty, naval officer. They had two sons, both of whom became army officers.<br>
<br>In 1850 Cavenagh's knowledge of Nepal led to his attachment to the Nepal mission to London. In 1854 Dalhousie appointed him town major, Calcutta, with the rank of lieutenant-colonel, in effect administrative commandant of the Calcutta garrison, which in 1857 was tempted to join the rising up country, but Cavenagh, a former regimental interpreter who understood the sepoys' mentality, acted skilfully and firmly to prevent this. However, Sir Colin Campbell, the commander-in-chief, objected to a relatively junior officer being directly responsible to the governor-general and secured the abolition of the post. Canning then offered Cavenagh the governorship of the Straits Settlements, which he held from 1859 to 1867.<br>
<br>On arrival Cavenagh found the Straits Settlements in political limbo, as its transfer to the control of the Colonial Office was held up until additional revenues were found to fill its persistent budget deficit. Proposals for customs duties and income tax met bitter resistance but Cavenagh eventually hit on the idea of applying Indian stamp duty to, among other things, the bills of exchange by which Singapore merchants paid for goods received on consignment from Britain. Since the new impost could be passed back to British principals or forward to Chinese distributors they grudgingly consented to it. The other high-profile event of Cavenagh's governorship was his decision to send a gunboat to bombard the state capital of Trengganu, on the east coast of the peninsula, in 1862. It was a token gesture but it fluttered the dovecotes of regional diplomacy and was criticized in parliament in London. However, it induced Siam to withdraw an envoy sent to bring Trengganu under its influence.<br>
<br>In his general conduct of government Cavenagh, shrewd and above all approachable, was more successful and popular than predecessors who had held themselves aloof. After he retired the Singapore community named the new bridge across the Singapore river after him. The staff establishment of the Straits Settlements had been reduced in the 1830s and the Indian Civil Service would not accept postings to such a backwater. The senior administrative (and also police, medical, and public works) posts were therefore held by officers of the Indian army who thus made a new career, becoming an efficient and respected cadre. Cavenagh himself had also to deal with visiting Malay dignitaries, Lord Elgin on his way to China, senior British army and navy officers, and Dutch and French officials. He once proposed to an admiral over dinner a novel method of warship construction to which the latter replied tactfully that &#145;it might be feasible&#146;. In his tours of rural districts of Penang and Malacca he went as far as possible by carriage and then dismounted to walk, changing his artificial leg for a more robust simple &#145;peg leg&#146;, noting with amusement the astonishment of Malay villagers at the change of limb. He was &#145;Small in stature and with a merry twinkle in his eye &hellip; more like a skipper of the old school than a military officer&#146;  (Makepeace and others, 2.529).<br>
<br>Cavenagh had already served for seven years as governor when the long-delayed transfer to the Colonial Office became imminent. He felt&#151;with justification&#151;that the new regime would start well if he stayed on to see it in, and he proposed that half a dozen senior administrators also should remain in post. However, the Colonial Office was resolved to make a clean sweep and did not even notify Cavenagh of the appointment of his successor, Sir Harry Ord. Mortified when he heard the news from a well-informed Singapore merchant, Cavenagh pointedly did not stay to hand over but departed a fortnight before Ord arrived. Another grievance was that he had not received the knighthood that came as a matter of course to governors of Indian provinces and he caused consternation at the India Office when, paying his valedictory visit, he raised the matter with the secretary of state. However, placed on the British army list, he was promoted lieutenant-general (1874) and finally general (1877). Then in 1881 came the long-coveted KCSI. After retiring to Long Ditton, Surrey, he became honorary colonel of the volunteer (territorial) 3rd battalion of the East Surrey regiment and served as a member of Surrey county council. He died at St Aubyns, Long Ditton on 3 July 1891 and was survived by his wife and their two sons.<br>
