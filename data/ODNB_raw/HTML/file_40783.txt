<span class="headword">Vyvyan, Sir  Richard</span>, first baronet  (1613&#150;1665), <span class="occ">politician and local administrator</span>, was the eldest son and heir of Sir Francis Vyvyan (<i>d</i>. 1635) of Trelowarren, Mawgan in Meneage, Cornwall, and his second wife, Loveday, daughter of John Connock of Treworgy, St Cleer, in the same county. His father was governor of St Mawes Castle from 1603 until 1632, when he was removed for embezzlement. Vyvyan matriculated from Exeter College, Oxford, on 20 June 1631, graduating BA the same day. He entered the Middle Temple in November 1631, reigning as prince in the Christmas masque of 1635, but was not called to the bar. Knighted on 1 March 1636, in October of that year he married Mary, daughter of James Bulteel of Barnstaple. They had six daughters and two sons. Vyvyan represented Penryn in the Short Parliament of 1640, and Tregony in the Long Parliament until he was disabled for royalism in January 1644.<br>
<br>In late September 1642, during the Truro mayoral elections, Vyvyan arrived at the town hall urging the outgoing mayor to call out the trained bands for the king. Upon the mayor's refusal Vyvyan appealed to the crowd outside, since &#145;they know not what unlawfull Assemblies were gathered in many parts of the County to the danger of their lives, their wives, and children, if they came not out to assist the Sheriffe and Justices&#146;  (<span class="italic">New News from Cornwall</span>, 1642, 1). The new mayor duly released the town arms, and the following day the trained bands were sent out for the king.<br>
<br>On 14 November 1642 Charles I issued a commission to Vyvyan to coin plate into money and to pay it over to Sir Ralph Hopton. On 3 January 1644 the king issued a further commission to Vyvyan to erect a royalist mint at Exeter, but Vyvyan's two surviving account books for the mint show that he had moved the mint to Exeter in September 1643, immediately after the capture of the city. He remained there almost continuously from September 1643 to April 1646, with two notable exceptions. On 27 January 1644 he attended the Oxford parliament, and he was created a DCL by the university the following month. In August 1644 he followed the king in his campaign against Essex in Cornwall, and on 12 February 1645 was created a baronet for his services to the royal cause.<br>
<br>In November 1642 Hopton had commissioned Vyvyan to erect a fort on Dennis Head, at the mouth of the Helford River. Building work began in spring 1643. On 19 February 1644 the king issued a commission authorizing Vyvyan to complete the fort, and to establish a garrison of one lieutenant, one master gunner, five other gunmen, one porter, and forty rank and file. Vyvyan paid for the erection of the fort and maintained it for eighteen months at his own expense, at a total cost of &pound;1350. After the fort's surrender to Fairfax on 18 March 1646 Vyvyan spent a further &pound;2055 10<i>s</i>. on arrears of pay.<br>
<br>Vyvyan was in Exeter when the city fell and on 9 April 1646 was named in the articles for the surrender of the city. On 20 June 1646 he begged to compound for his delinquency, and on 8 October his fine was fixed at &pound;600. It was also agreed that his goods in Exeter and stock in Cornwall, seized contrary to the terms of the treaty of Exeter, should be restored, but the local committees did not comply. It was only after Fairfax's intervention that, on 3 April 1648, parliament remitted &pound;300, the second half of Vyvyan's fine, in compensation for the loss of his goods. On 11 May 1649 Vyvyan accepted this final discharge of his estate, estimating that he had spent nearly &pound;10,000 in the king's cause.<br>
<br>Nothing is known of Vyvyan's activities during the interregnum. However, he celebrated the Restoration in 1660 by erecting two granite pillars at Trelowarren, and his former services were rewarded with the governorship of St Mawes Castle and appointment as gentleman of the king's privy chamber. He was returned as the member for St Mawes in 1663 and served the constituency until his death on 3 November 1665. He was buried, as he had requested, &#145;without any Pompe or extraordinary cost or expense&#146;  (will), on 10 November at Mawgan in Meneage. His wife survived him, and his eldest son, Vyell (<i>bap</i>. 1634, <i>d</i>. 1697), succeeded to the baronetcy.<br>
