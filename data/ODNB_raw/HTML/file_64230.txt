<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Sickert,  Walter, pupils</span>  (<em>act. </em>1890&#150;1939), <span class="occ">painters</span>, encompass generations of aspiring artists who from 1890 to 1939 attended painting, drawing, and etching classes held by <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36083/', "Walter Richard Sickert (1860&#150;1942)")</script> in a succession of private rooms, private studios, and official art schools. Many students found recipes for successful picture-making in Sickert's precepts: draw by the background spaces; define objects not in terms of outline but as maps of light and shade; plan the execution of pictures through a tonally prepared underpainting. As a result, work by Sickert pupils is ubiquitous.<br>
<br>A distinction must be made between those artists who benefited from Sickert's tuition early in their careers, those who were overwhelmed by him, and those who based their practice on his instruction but retained an independent vision. The first group included <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/33285/', "Roger Fry (1866&#150;1934)")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35842/', "William Rothenstein (1872&#150;1945)")</script> who attended Sickert's evening classes at The Vale, Chelsea, in 1893; <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/34718/', "Ambrose McEvoy (1878&#150;1927)")</script> who in 1909 attended his etching class at 31 Augustus Street; <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37206/', "David Bomberg (1890&#150;1957)")</script> who attended his classes at the Westminster Technical Institute; and the talented amateur <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32413/', "Winston Churchill")</script> to whom he gave private tuition from 1927 to 1928. Some from the second group enjoyed a brief moment of credibility when in July 1913 the Carfax Gallery put on an exhibition, &#145;Paintings, drawings, and etchings by past and present pupils of Mr. Sickert&#146;. This umbrella sheltered 101 works by twenty-eight artists of whom some twenty are now forgotten. As <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30781/', "Enid Bagnold (1889&#150;1981)")</script>, his erstwhile pupil, recalled, Sickert &#145;was such a teacher as would make a kitchen-maid exhibit once&#146;  (<span class="italic">Autobiography</span>, 1969, 73). The few artists remembered from that exhibition are John Doman Turner (<i>c</i>.1872&#150;1938) and Malcolm Drummond (1880&#150;1945), both members of the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/64739/', "Camden Town Group")</script>; Mary Godwin (1887&#150;1960); Jean McIntyre (1889&#150;1967); Charles Maresco Pearce (1874&#150;1964); Louise Pickard (1865&#150;1928); and John Wheatley (1892&#150;1955). The third group represents the few men and women who had talent, staying power, and a temperament strong enough to withstand prolonged exposure to Sickert.<br>
<br>Among the best of these was the artist <a name="cosubject_64831"></a><span class="headword">(Laura) Sylvia Gosse</span>  (1881&#150;1968)<span class="occ"></span>, born in London on 14 February 1881, the youngest of the three children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/33481/', "Sir Edmund Gosse (1849&#150;1928)")</script> and his wife, Ellen, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Epps. Gosse's training began at the St John's Wood School of Art, and continued from 1903 to 1908 at the Royal Academy Schools. In 1908 Sickert&#151;a family friend&#151;took over her education. She learned her formidable skill as an etcher at his classes at the Westminster Technical Institute, at 31 Augustus Street, and perhaps at the school for etching that he ran with the practical and financial help of young Madeleine Knox (1890&#150;1975) first at 209 and then at 140 Hampstead Road. Sickert christened the latter address Rowlandson House in homage to the comic draughtsman and expanded the curriculum to include drawing and painting. When Miss Knox resigned in March 1910, worn out by coping with Sickert, Gosse took over management of the school. A few months later she became a full partner in the enterprise.<br>
<br>Gosse adopted Sickert's subject matter: the townscapes, domestic interiors with figures&#151;clothed and unclothed&#151;iron bedstead scenes, music halls. She adopted his working practices, painting (sometimes after the passage of many years) from squared-up drawings made on the spot and in later life from photographs. She adopted in earlier career his broken touch as both etcher and painter, and in later career his habit of building an abstract jigsaw pattern of colours conceived in terms of their tonal equivalents. She and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/64512/', "Th&#233;r&#232;se Lessore")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36083/', "Sickert, Walter Richard (1860&#150;1942)")</script>] were the painters Sickert most readily entrusted to prepare his later works by transferring his designs to canvas and laying in their tonal underpaintings. However, although Gosse's artistic personality was closely dependent upon Sickert for inspiration, there were qualities innate to her work, in particular her spare touch and bold sense of design, from which he in turn derived nourishment. Her documentary subject painting <span class="italic">Madrid Crowd</span> (1931; priv. coll., repr. Fisher, between 56&#150;7), clearly based on a newspaper photograph, was painted four to five years before <span class="italic">The Miner</span> (Birmingham Art Gallery), Sickert's own essay in contemporary reportage.<br>
<br>Gosse, although shy, self-effacing, and reclusive by nature, had confidence in her work. She exhibited with all the major groups including the Allied Artists' Association (from 1909), the London Group (from 1914), the New English Art Club (from 1911), and the Royal Academy (from 1912). Behind the scenes, she devoted much of her energies and her money to helping Sickert at various times of his life. She bought his paintings anonymously when financial support was crucial to his well-being (donating some to the Johannesburg Art Gallery); she tended Christine Sickert during her terminal illness and nursed Sickert back to health and sanity following Christine's death in 1920 at Envermeu, Dieppe; in 1934 she organized the Sickert fund to raise enough money to enable the seventy-four-year-old painter to work free from financial anxiety; she helped Th&eacute;r&egrave;se Lessore look after her husband during the last years of his life.<br>
<br>During Sickert's lifetime, Gosse often lived in his shadow, renting rooms in and around Camden Town and a house in Envermeu, Dieppe. She is sometimes pitied for having twice failed to win Sickert as a husband, first in 1911 and more emphatically after Christine's death when she and Th&eacute;r&egrave;se Lessore were considered by their mutual acquaintance to be joint favourites. Almost certainly this pity is misplaced. There is no evidence to suggest that Sylvia Gosse wished her devotion to Sickert as man and mentor to be rewarded with the doubtful pleasure of marriage to him. It is probable that she preferred to remain single and single-minded in the pursuit of her career as an artist.<br>
<br>Failed eyesight compelled Gosse to give up painting in 1961. She died of heart failure in hospital on 6 June 1968. Her paintings and drawings are in public galleries throughout the United Kingdom while her graphic work is well represented in the British Museum, the Victoria and Albert Museum, and the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_72003"></a><span class="headword">(Alice) Marjorie Sherlock</span>  (1891&#150;1973), <span class="occ">artist</span>, was born at Fir Tree Cottage, George Lane, Wanstead, Essex, on 3 February 1891, daughter of Henry Alexander George Sherlock, a civil engineer, and Alice Mary Sherlock, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Platts. She came into Sickert's orbit during the First World War, when she studied at the Westminster Technical Institute as a pupil of Sickert and of Harold Gilman. A woman of distinct and forceful character, she married in 1918&#151;and later divorced&#151;her first cousin, Major Wilfrid Kenyon Tufnell Barrett (1897&#150;1975). She lived the last thirty years of her life in an isolated rambling house near Ottery St Mary in Devon. There she carried on working to a rigorous routine and managed to live on a meagre income by making her own clothes and growing her own vegetables.<br>
<br>Sherlock learned her craft from Sickert and Harold Gilman, but retained a distinct vision. As an oil painter she was precocious. Her powerful rendering of Liverpool Street Station (1917; Gov. Art Coll.; another version National Railway Museum, York) was exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1917. In 1926 she resumed her education by going to study etching at the Royal College of Art. She was an accomplished draughtsman on copper, in pencil, and in pen and ink. Her etching of Waterloo Station demonstrates her ability to control the broad structure of a complex composition without losing her delicacy of touch in the detail. Many of her etchings were published: <span class="italic">Egyptian Etchings</span> (1925), <span class="italic">German Etchings</span> (1929), and <span class="italic">Indian Etchings</span> (1932). She visited America during the depression and worked with Andr&eacute; Lhote and Dunoyer de Segonzac in Paris in 1938. On moving to Devon she met Orovida, daughter of Lucien Pissarro, who lived near by. Orovida financed their occasional trips abroad in later years. Marjorie Sherlock died of heart failure at her home, Angela Court, Tipton St John, Devon, on 2 April 1973.<br>
<br>Sherlock had no solo exhibitions, but her work could be seen in many mixed exhibitions including Royal Academy summer shows, the New English Art Club, the Carnegie Institute, Pittsburgh, the Society of Graphic Art, the International Society of Sculptors, Painters, and Gravers, the Royal Society of British Artists, and the Chicago Society of Etchers.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_64230"></a><span class="headword">(Edith) Wendela Boreel</span>  (1895&#150;1985), <span class="occ">artist</span>, was born on 18 March 1895 at Pau in France and came to England when her father, Jonkheer Boreel, a Dutch diplomat, was posted as minister to London. Her mother, Edith Margaret (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Ives), was American. In 1911 she went to the Slade School of Fine Art and to Sickert's evening classes at the Westminster Technical Institute. Her sultry beauty appealed to Sickert as much as her evident talent. Believing that her potential was as a painter in oils, he gave her the use of one of his painting studios in Mornington Crescent. Marjorie Lilly recalls  (Lilly, 67&#150;8) that in 1917 Boreel's remarkable aptitude for gouache painting inspired Sickert, and through him his wider circle of colleagues and pupils, to experiment with this difficult medium. Boreel was also a skilful etcher. Her subject matter included portraits, landscapes, townscapes, and figures. She exhibited with the Allied Artists' Association, the London Group, the New English Art Club, the Royal Academy, and the Royal Society of Painter-Etchers and Engravers (of which she became an associate in 1923). After her marriage in 1924 to Leslie George Wylde, a New Zealander, she went to live in Bray, Berkshire. They assembled a fine collection of paintings by Sickert, including his self-portrait, <span class="italic">The Juvenile Lead</span> of 1907, now in the Southampton Art Gallery. After her husband's death in 1935 she spent much of her time away from England, mostly in France and, during the Second World War, with her son in the United States of America. She died at home in Castelnau-le-Lez, France, on 13 April 1985. Her etchings can be seen in the Victoria and Albert Museum; a polymorphic painting, <span class="italic">Landscape in Nude</span>, bearing no trace of Sickert's influence, belongs to the Government Art Collection.<br>
<br>Among Boreel's contemporaries at the Slade were Marjorie Lilly (1891&#150;1976) and Christina Cutter (1893&#150;1969), who entered Sickert's Fitzroy Street circle in 1917 and were stimulated as much by his enlightening intelligence in regard to art as by his practical instruction. Lilly, Boreel, and Cutter held several joint exhibitions between 1922 and 1939. Cutter, who was born in Wisbech, Cambridgeshire, and died in Chichester, had married George, brother to Marjorie Lilly, in 1918. Her paintings are characterized by a clear grasp of structure expressed through an emphatic pattern of light and shade and a joyous sense of colour. <span class="italic">A Park in Vienna</span> (exh. 1921; priv. coll.) is closer to Charles Ginner than to Sickert. Lilly was born, lived, and died in Camden Town. Few of her paintings survived bombing raids during the Second World War. Her inestimable legacy is the lively account she published, <span class="italic">Sickert: the Painter and his Circle</span> (1971). Lilly quoted the prospectus Sickert published in 1917 in relation to his classes at 8 Fitzroy Street:<blockquote>Mr Sickert retains the option of accepting such students only as he believes are likely to profit by his method of training. To avoid correspondence, it may be found convenient to state the principles by which Mr Sickert would be guided in his acceptance of students. Unlikely to benefit would seem to be: (i) painters whose practice is already thoroughly set in methods its continuance in which Mr Sickert would be unable to encourage and indisposed to check; (ii) students who have already studied with him long enough to have absorbed&#151;or failed to absorb&#151;the little he has to teach. An intelligent student who cannot learn whatever is to be learnt from a teacher in three years will learn no more in thirty. Mr Sickert prefers not to be a party to the creation or perpetuation of what may be called the professional or eternal student, with no other aims than to haunt the art schools as an occupation or distraction in itself. (Lilly, 63)</blockquote>Sickert's last private school, which opened in 1927 at 1 Highbury Place, was restricted to male students. Only a handful applied, of whom several were amateurs. They included Sickert's ophthalmologist Dr Cobbledick; Sickert's biographer Dr Robert Emmons; and Sickert's dealer from 1928, Mark Oliver. Two students were to become serious professional painters: <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37762/', "Paul Ayshford Methuen, fourth Baron Methuen (1886&#150;1974)")</script>, and Morland Lewis.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_72004"></a><span class="headword">(Edward) Morland Lewis</span>  (1903&#150;1943)<span class="occ"></span> was born on 25 May 1903 at Morfa House, Carmarthen, youngest of the ten sons of Benjamin Archibald Lewis (1857&#150;1946), gas engineer, and his wife, Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Fuller. He studied (like Gosse some twenty years before) at the St John's Wood School of Art and the Royal Academy Schools before joining Sickert's class in 1927. He painted landscapes and townscapes in England and France, adapting the lessons of Sickert, for instance the use of underpaintings, to produce rich-toned and lively records of the everyday scenes around him. He painted the streets of London and Paris and landscapes in Ireland and around Ferryside, a fishing village near his native Carmarthen. He exhibited with the London Group from 1929 (member 1932). On 20 May 1940 he married another member of the London Group, the painter Kathleen Margaret Godfrey-Faussett-Osborne (<i>b</i>. 1911), daughter of Henry Bryan Godfrey Godfrey-Faussett-Osborne, a retired civil servant. During the Second World War he served as a camouflage officer in north Africa where he died of malaria on 4 August 1943. Paintings by Lewis are in the Tate collection, London, the Government Art Collection, and the National Museum and Gallery of Wales, Cardiff.<br>
<br>The widespread dissemination of Sickert's precepts had a profound impact on the character of British art throughout the twentieth century. Because Sickert had so many pupils over so long a period, because many went on themselves to become teachers, and because Sickert's maxims were so direct and memorable, art students long after his death were being instructed by Sickert at second&#151;or even third&#151;hand. To paraphrase Sickert, if he taught Bomberg, Bomberg taught Auerbach, &#145;and so on, <i>ad infinitum</i>&#146;.<br>
