<span class="headword">Griffiths,  Hugh</span>  (1891&#150;1954), <span class="occ">chemical engineer</span>, was born at 34 Dunning Road, Middlesbrough, on 28 July 1891, the only child of Hugh Griffiths (<i>d</i>. 1892/3), a blast furnace manager, and his wife, Emma Jane Watson. He attended school in Middlesbrough and, at the age of fifteen, won a national scholarship in chemistry at Imperial College, London. In the following years he took the diploma of associate of the Royal College of Science and he graduated BSc with first-class honours in 1910.<br>
<br>After spending a further year at Imperial College as a demonstrator, in 1911 Griffiths accepted an appointment with the Nobel Explosives Company in Ayrshire and began to examine the physical analysis of chemical plant performance. With the onset of the First World War he became responsible for the design and construction of explosives plant for the Ministry of Munitions, as well as plants for heavy chemicals, dyestuffs, intermediates, and synthetic drugs which, until that time, had been imported from Germany. In 1917 Griffiths set up as a consulting chemical engineer in the City of London, a career which he pursued with ever-increasing success. On 7 January 1919, aged twenty-seven, he married Marion Hellen (<i>b</i>. 1893/4), daughter of John Stilt, a railway engineer; the couple had no children.<br>
<br>Griffiths gave great service to the Institution of Chemical Engineers. From 1917 he took on the lectures started by J. W. Hinchley in 1909 at Battersea Polytechnic, which he continued until 1934 when he was succeeded by his former pupils. He was a prime mover in the creation of the Society of Chemical Industry in 1917 and the Institution of Chemical Engineers in 1922. A member of the board of examiners from 1925 to 1952, he took the chair in 1929. He was a member (at times chairman) of the education committee from 1924 to 1949, and president of the institution in 1945 and 1946.<br>
<br>Griffiths's early collaboration with Dr Emil Passburg, the German designer of vacuum driers, led to a lifelong interest in high-vacuum techniques. His paper in the 1945 <span class="italic">Proceedings</span> of the chemical engineering group of the Society of Chemical Industry was the definitive work on the subject. Also of great importance was his work on the development of commercial crystallizers, summarized in his 1947 presidential address to the Institution of Chemical Engineers. In 1932 he had joined the board of British Carbo-Union and his work on vapour absorption and recovery&#151;the subject of his 1946 presidential address&#151;resulted in the design and erection of the largest installation in the world for the recovery of benzene from coal gas.<br>
<br>Griffiths was a man of strong individuality and forcefulness of character. His leonine aspect and the mischievous twinkle in his eye made his appearance as arresting as his personality. With his immense practical experience he was suspicious of academics; he was a perfectionist and would not tolerate any sort of inaccuracy. After the presentation of a complicated paper at a meeting it was a joy to watch Griffiths, with his invariable appeal to &#145;first principles&#146;, strip the paper of its frills and expose the essential bones of the contribution. He was a champion against humbug in all its forms.<br>
<br>Griffiths died at his home, 240 Upton Road, Old Bexley, Kent, on 26 June 1954.<br>
