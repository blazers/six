<span class="headword">Fleming,  Thomas</span> <span class="st"> [<em>name in religion </em>Placid]</span>  (1642&#150;1720), <span class="occ">abbot of Regensburg</span>, descendant of the earls of Wigtown, was born on 5 October 1642 at Kirkoswald, Ayrshire. He was educated in Edinburgh as a prot&eacute;g&eacute; of Sir George Lockhart until, in 1662 or 1663, he joined the navy. About 1665, when he was in Dublin, he became a Catholic. Subsequently, on his way to France he was captured by Moorish pirates but after a month was freed by Spaniards. He was in the Scots College, Paris, for a time in 1667 and 1668 and from there went to the Scots Benedictine abbey at Regensburg.<br>
<br>Fleming received the monastic habit on 21 November 1668, taking the religious name Placid, and a year later, on 21 November 1669, made his vows. On 28 March 1671 he was ordained priest. On 5 December 1672, when just turned thirty, he was elected abbot of Regensburg, which also brought him control of the sister house at Erfurt. He was to hold the office for forty-seven years, working ceaselessly and single-mindedly, and transforming the entire situation of his community.<br>
<br>In 1672 the monastery was in a lamentable state, with an absentee abbot, the coffers empty, and only three professed monks in residence. Fleming began at once to improve the finances, tackling problems and defaulters with energy. At once he established relations with rulers and officials in church and state who could help him and protect the abbey. The British and French envoys to the imperial diet in Regensburg relied on his help and advice.<br>
<br>At Erfurt, where he appointed a prior answerable to himself, Fleming repaired and extended the buildings and secured two chairs of philosophy in the university to be held always by Scots monks. His greatest achievement, however, was to establish a seminary for Scots students in his own abbey. Finally opened in 1718 after thirty years of tireless lobbying and begging, it ensured a supply of novices and thus of missionary priests for Scotland.<br>
<br>In 1686 Fleming was the prime candidate to be bishop in Scotland but he firmly declined, seeing the Regensburg abbey as his life's work. He died on 8 January 1720 at the abbey and was buried in the abbey church or cloister. When he died the monastic community and the Erfurt house were flourishing and twenty-eight students had entered the seminary. The results of his work endured: Scottish monks of Regensburg and Erfurt during the eighteenth century contributed significantly to the Scottish mission and to the cultural life of Germany.<br>
