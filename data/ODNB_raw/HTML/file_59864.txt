<span class="headword">Chalmers,  Archibald Kerr</span>  (1856&#150;1942), <span class="occ">medical officer of health</span>, son of William Kerr Chalmers, a joiner, and Margaret Nichol, was born at Greenock, near Glasgow, on 10 April 1856. He entered Glasgow University in 1874 and graduated MB, CM, with high honours in 1879 and became houseman at the city's Belvidere Fever Hospital. Chalmers was in private practice for seven years before taking his MD with commendation in 1887 and the Cambridge diploma in public health in 1889. He was admitted to the fellowship of the Royal Faculty of Physicians and Surgeons of Glasgow in 1901. In 1892 he became full-time assistant to James Burn Russell, medical officer of health for Glasgow from 1872 to 1898. Russell joined the Scottish Local Government Board in 1898, and Chalmers was appointed Glasgow's medical officer of health, a position he occupied with distinction until his retirement in 1925.<br>
<br>Chalmers had a baptism of fire when, in 1900, Glasgow was struck with an outbreak of plague, which resurfaced in 1901. The plague was thought to have originated in Hong Kong about 1896 and had arrived, via Porto, in Britain, where previously it had been absent since 1665. Despite his relative inexperience Chalmers, backed by the impressive sanitary organization built up by Russell, faced the difficulties well, perhaps in part because of his military experience, dating from the 1870s, with the local volunteer forces. Smallpox raged concurrently with plague, causing many deaths. However, apart from the rarity of plague, Glasgow's health problems were legion, stemming from overcrowded, insanitary living accommodation and poverty and hunger, and Chalmers met them all head on. It took time to improve housing and to increase environmental standards, but he made an early start on personal medical services such as those for mothers and children soon after the 1904 report of the interdepartmental committee on physical deterioration. The medical inspection of schoolchildren revealed the poor state of child health, against the backdrop of a crippling infant mortality in Glasgow of 14.9 per cent in 1901. Chalmers and some progressive councillors pioneered infant feeding by opening milk depots in 1904, based on Professor Budin's <i>Goutes de lait</i> in Paris. A female doctor employed in the city's health department began infant consultations. The child health movement grew and voluntary provisions followed on from Chalmers's initiative. Chalmers himself attended congresses in Paris on milk depots, to keep informed of European progress. By 1914 Glasgow had opened fourteen consultation centres with four doctors and ten trained health workers.<br>
<br>Strong leadership such as this was also echoed in the control of infectious disease and tuberculosis through the provision of new hospitals. Robroyston Hospital, for treating tuberculosis, opened in 1919, and Mearnskirk Hospital opened in 1922 specifically for children suffering from that disease. Chalmers carried out a positive onslaught on infectious diseases during his term of office, much of it aimed at protecting the health of the young. In 1920 he oversaw the reorganization of the city's sanitary department, when it became the public health department. This was no idle change of nomenclature. It was the point at which Glasgow accepted medical supervision of all medico-sanitary related provision. It was one of the last Scottish cities to do so.<br>
<br>Chalmers played a wide role in Scottish health policy. He was a member of the Belfast health commission in 1907 and a member of the Medical Research Committee from 1916 to 1918. He was an early member of the General Nursing Council and the Central Midwives' Board (Scotland), and of the consultative council of the Medical and Allied Services Committee (Scotland) shortly after the formation of the Scottish board of health in 1919. He was equally evident in academic and professional governance, being examiner for the Cambridge diplomas in public health, in hygiene, and in tropical medicine. He examined for the fellowship of the Royal Faculty of Physicians and Surgeons of Glasgow and for the degrees of public health and forensic medicine at the universities of Glasgow, Aberdeen, St Andrews, and Liverpool. He was deeply involved in the Royal Sanitary Association of Scotland and the British Medical Association. He wrote on a wide range of topics related to public health during his term of office, and he continued producing publications for many years after his retirement. He was made honorary LLD (Glasgow) in 1926.<br>
<br>Chalmers married Margaret Jessie, daughter of Henry Stewart, about 1879; the couple had two sons. Chalmers died in the Croydon Nursing Home, Bridge of Weir, Renfrewshire, on 24 January 1942.<br>
