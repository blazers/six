<span class="headword">Ballantyne,  John</span>  (1774&#150;1821), <span class="occ">publisher and literary agent</span>, was born at Kelso, Roxburghshire, Scotland, on 13 May 1774, the second of three children of John Ballantyne (1743&#150;1817), general merchant, and Jean (1745?&#150;1818), daughter of James Barclay, rector of Dalkeith high school, and his wife, Elizabeth. The younger brother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1228/', "James Ballantyne (1772&#150;1833)")</script>, he was educated at Kelso grammar school, which Walter Scott attended in 1783. He went to London in 1794 and worked as a clerk in the banking firm of Messrs Currie. On returning to Kelso in 1795 he became a partner in his father's business. In June 1797 he married Hermione Parker (<i>d</i>. 1854), stepdaughter of the Revd William Rutherford, assistant minister at Kelso. Soon afterwards the partnership with his father was dissolved, but Ballantyne carried on the business until, as a consequence of financial difficulties, he moved to Edinburgh in January 1805. There he was employed in James Ballantyne's printing business, as a clerk at &pound;200 per year. Small, slight, and dark-haired, he was a talented storyteller, mimic, and singer. His cheerful optimism and good humour led to Scott's enduring affection for a man he called Jocund Johnnie  (<span class="italic">Letters of Sir Walter Scott</span>, 7.127) and Rigdumfunnidos.<br>
<br>When, in January 1809, it was decided to establish a publishing house with Scott as secret partner John Ballantyne was appointed manager, at a salary of &pound;300 and one-fourth of the profits. In preparation he went to London to meet John Murray and made arrangements to be the Edinburgh publisher of the <span class="italic">Quarterly Review</span>. John Ballantyne &amp; Co. was established on Hanover Street, Edinburgh, in March 1809 and later held the designation &#145;bookseller to the regent&#146;. Ballantyne's two-volume novel, <span class="italic">The Widow's Lodgings</span>, was probably written at the beginning of his career as a publisher; the second edition is dated 1813. According to James Ballantyne he also contributed ballads for the <span class="italic">Edinburgh Annual Register</span>, which the company began issuing in 1810. Though the publishing house enjoyed some initial success it was hampered by lack of capital. The <span class="italic">Register</span> project lost money from the beginning, and the company's financial problems were further exacerbated when Ballantyne impulsively bought up stock that later proved unsaleable. By 1813 it was apparent that the business could not continue, and Scott re-entered negotiations with Archibald Constable &amp; Co. The stock was gradually sold off at reduced rates, with Constable taking the bulk of it, and the partnership was finally dissolved on 1 February 1816.<br>
<br>Though Scott's letters to Ballantyne during this period reflect a sense of exasperation his continued regard is evident from his decision to hire him as literary agent. This arrangement proved financially advantageous for Ballantyne, since it came to include a share in the profits from the <span class="roman">Waverley</span> novels. Ballantyne made the Hanover Street premises into a saleroom for literature and art, and his lively character and sociability ensured him success in his capacity as auctioneer. In 1816 he purchased Trinity Grove, at 70 Trinity Road, on the Firth of Forth. The house had earlier belonged to the bookseller William Creech; renamed Harmony Hall, it became the site of lavish parties attended by theatrical, musical, and literary people. From 4 January to 12 July 1817 Ballantyne published a weekly periodical, <span class="italic">The Sale-Room</span>, which was designed to draw attention to the auction house. In November 1820 he proposed a series of reprinted novels, to be entitled <span class="roman">Ballantyne's Novelists' Library</span>, and Scott agreed to provide prefatory biographical essays. The first volume was published by Hurst &amp; Co. in February 1821.<br>
<br>Ballantyne's health began to decline in 1819, and in December 1820 he retired. He moved back to Roxburghshire&#151;to Kirklands, near Earlston&#151;and in April 1821 took Walton Hall, at Kelso, with a view to settling there. However, in early June, when he was at his brother's Edinburgh residence&#151;10 St John Street&#151;he became acutely ill. On the morning of 16 June 1821 he died, probably of tuberculosis. Though Lockhart was severely critical of Ballantyne, he recorded that on attending the burial at Canongate churchyard, on 20 June, Scott turned away to say &#145;I feel as if there would be less sunshine for me from this day forth&#146;  (Lockhart, <span class="italic">Memoirs</span>, 5.76). Scott was a trustee of the will, by whose terms he was designated to receive &pound;2000. In the event Ballantyne had died almost penniless, and the executors had difficulty finding any money for his widow. His mistress, Hermione Robertson, of Friars, near Kelso, may possibly have received her &pound;100. Scott continued to contribute additional biographies to the <span class="roman">Novelists' Library</span> project, for the benefit of Ballantyne's widow.<br>
