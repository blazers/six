<span class="headword">Batty,  Thomas</span>  (<em>c.</em>1832&#150;1903), <span class="occ">animal trainer and circus proprietor</span>, was a nephew of William Batty, the lessee of Astley's Amphitheatre, London. Celebrated as a lion tamer, he is also said to have been the first to train an elephant to stand on its head. He had many life-threatening struggles with the lions he &#145;tamed&#146;: he had so many scars on one side of his body that, it was said, a half-crown could not be placed between them. He would enter the ring, clad in Lincoln green and long leather boots, with a short whip in his hand. The lions would spring at the bars of their cage with fierce snarls, and he would strike at their paws with his whip, provoking their fury. Someone in the audience would always entreat him not to enter the cage, but he would slip in and have a lively ten minutes or so. From about 1859 he performed on the continent. On one occasion, in Hamburg, he entered the cage wearing a glittering spangled costume, whereupon one of the lions mauled him badly, tearing off the costume and scoring his back. He escaped by using the butt of the gun which he carried at that time; another tamer, Lucas, was killed by the same lions in Paris in 1869. Batty returned to Britain in 1874 and began a provincial tour with his own circus, which enjoyed a reputation for grandeur and excellence. He claimed to pay more in wages to his performers than any two other travelling circuses.<br>
<br>Batty and his first wife (whose name is unknown) had ten children who were brought up in the circus. Their son George became a famous jockey act rider and proprietor. Mrs Batty died in 1875 and Batty later married Sarah Footit, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Crockett (<i>c</i>.1836&#150;1923). His fortunes declined in his later years, and he entered the workhouse at Newcastle upon Tyne. He died in the Newcastle City Lunatic Asylum, Gosforth, on 22 September 1903.<br>
