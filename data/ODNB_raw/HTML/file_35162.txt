<span class="headword">Murray,  George Robert Milne</span>  (1858&#150;1911), <span class="occ">botanist and algologist</span>, was born at Arbroath, Forfarshire, on 11 November 1858, one of the eight children of George Murray (<i>b</i>. 1814), a tradesman, and his wife, Helen Margaret Sayles (<i>b</i>. 1819). <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35153/', "Alexander Stuart Murray (1841&#150;1904)")</script>, keeper of Greek and Roman antiquities at the British Museum, was an older brother. Murray was educated at Arbroath high school, and in 1875 studied under Anton de Bary at Strasbourg. In 1876 he became an assistant in the botanical department of the British Museum. Initially responsible for the cryptogamic collections, in 1895 he became keeper of the department. He was lecturer on botany at St George's Hospital medical school from 1882 to 1886, and to the Royal Veterinary College from 1890 to 1895. In 1884 he married Helen (<i>d</i>. 1902), daughter of William Welsh of Walker's Barns and Boggieshallow, Brechin, Forfarshire; the couple later had a son and a daughter.<br>
<br>In 1886 Murray acted as naturalist to the solar eclipse expedition to the West Indies, an area to which he returned on a dredging expedition the following year. Two years later he chartered a tug for a dredging expedition 300 miles west of Ireland, on which he was accompanied by a party of naturalists. In 1901 he became director of the civilian scientific staff of the national Antarctic expedition in HMS <i>Discovery</i>, under Captain R. F. Scott, although he accompanied the expedition only as far as Cape Town. For some years he devoted much of his vacations to the collection of phytoplankton in the Scottish lochs from the fishery board's yacht <i>Garland</i>. Murray was elected a fellow of the Linnean Society in 1878, apparently in contravention of the by-laws, as he was then under age, and became its vice-president in 1899. He was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1897.<br>
<br>Murray's main contribution to botany is his work on marine algae. He wrote a number of papers on the subject, including &#145;The distribution of marine alga in space and time&#146;  (<span class="italic">Journal of the Linnean Society</span>, 1883) and &#145;A comparison of the marine floras of the warm Atlantic, the Cape of Good Hope and the Indian Ocean&#146;  (<span class="italic">Phycological Memoirs</span>, 1892). He also reported on the discovery of at least one new species of phytoplankton. Apart from his work on marine algae, Murray also wrote the section on fungi in Henfrey's <span class="italic">Elementary Course of Botany</span> (3rd edn, 1878), contributed the articles on fungi and vegetable parasitism to the ninth edition of the <span class="italic">Encyclopaedia Britannica</span> (1879 and 1885), and published a <span class="italic">Handbook of Cryptogamic Botany</span>, together with Alfred William Bennett. Between 1882 and 1885 he published three reports on his investigations of the salmon disease, undertaken at the instance of Professor Huxley. From 1892 to 1895 he edited <span class="italic">Phycological Memoirs, being Researches Made in the Botanical Department of the British Museum</span>, of which three parts appeared, each containing papers by him, and in 1895 he published <span class="italic">Introduction to the Study of Seaweeds</span>. He also edited <span class="italic">The Antarctic Manual</span> for the expedition of 1901, arranging the contents and securing contributors, but only writing some four pages of instructions on plant collecting. He retired from his position at the British Museum in 1905, on the grounds of ill health. He died at Stonehaven, Kincardineshire on 16 December 1911.<br>
