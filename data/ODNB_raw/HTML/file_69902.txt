<span class="headword">Fleming,  Jean</span>, countess of Cassillis  (1553/4&#150;1609), <span class="occ">noblewoman</span>, was the only child of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9699/', "James Fleming, fourth Lord Fleming (1533/4&#150;1558)")</script>, and his wife, Lady Barbara Hamilton, the eldest daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/12081/', "James Hamilton, second earl of Arran")</script>. The estates and title passed to her uncle, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9701/', "John Fleming, fifth Lord Fleming")</script>, of whom Jean Fleming complained to the privy council in 1579 that he had failed to provide the 4000 merks promised for her marriage. She had a sixth part of the revenues of the lordship of Fleming assigned to her in September 1579 and was granted the lands of Thankerton and Biggar following her resignation as heir to her grandfather in 1583.<br>
<br>In January 1583 Jean married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17826/', "John Maitland")</script> of Thirlestane (1543&#150;1595), later James VI's chief minister, who became chancellor in 1587 and was elevated to the peerage as Lord Thirlestane in 1590. An English observer commented in 1589 that she was &#145;a wise woman and half chancellor when he is at home&#146;, although this was a rare comment on her involvement in politics  (<span class="italic">Salisbury Papers</span>, 3.446&#150;7). In 1590, the year of James's marriage to Anne of Denmark, she had a daughter, Anna (<i>d</i>. 1609). Two years later she incurred the queen's displeasure as a result of making indiscreet remarks about the latter's relationship with Francis Stewart, fifth earl of Bothwell, within Anne's hearing. This contributed to the friction between the queen and Maitland, and it was said in 1593 that Anne still &#145;cannot hitherto well brook his wife&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP Scot.</span>, 11.233&#150;4). The following year the Maitlands had a son, John.<br>
<br>Maitland died on 3 October 1595. Now a wealthy widow, Jean took a second husband, the much younger <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15377/', "John Kennedy, fifth earl of Cassillis (1574/5&#150;1615)")</script>, in November 1597; the marriage was conducted with some haste and excited attention at court as she was a woman &#145;of good years, not like to bear children&#146;  (BL, Cotton MS Caligula B. iv, fol. 244). Cassillis's union with a woman twice his age was a source of amusement and an embarrassment to the young earl's associates: one commentator at court declared Cassillis to be &#145;clengit out of credit both here and at home with his own friends&#146; since his marriage  (<span class="italic">CSP Scot.</span>, 13.I.329). By January 1598 King James owed the new countess 7000 merks and when he offered Cassillis the treasurership in spring 1599, it was rumoured that James's motive was that &#145;his wifes purse should be opened for her rose nobles&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP Scot.</span>, 13.I.444). Although terms for his holding the office were agreed by mid-March, a fortnight later Cassillis had formally refused the job, worried by its financial implications and offended by the rumour. The matter was not resolved until spring 1600, but the couple entertained the king at Thirlestane Castle that February.<br>
<br>While Cassillis was with James in London in 1603, the countess and her brother-in-law, Hugh Kennedy, master of Cassillis, were captured, and the countess briefly imprisoned, by Kennedy of Drummurchie, one of the faction with whom the earl was feuding. In April 1604 Cassillis was ordered to be warded in Blackness Castle and find &pound;5000 as surety for his wife's protection after assaulting her in the presence of the council and dragging her out of the council chamber; he was imprisoned again for the same offence later in the year.<br>
<br>In March 1609 the countess was &#145;havelie diseasit and under medicine&#146;, prescribed a diet which excluded fish, and granted permission to eat meat in Lent  (<span class="italic">Reg. PCS</span>, 8.256&#150;7). She died on 23 June 1609 aged fifty-five and was buried in St Mary's Church, Haddington, alongside her first husband. The Maitland family monument, erected by their son and heir, John Maitland, first earl of Lauderdale (1594&#150;1645), depicts the recumbent effigies of Jean Fleming and Maitland of Thirlestane and also commemorates their daughter, Anna.<br>
