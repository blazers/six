<span class="headword">Lyttelton <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Balfour]</span>, Dame  Edith Sophy</span>  (1865&#150;1948), <span class="occ">public servant and author</span>, was born in St Petersburg, Russia, the elder of two daughters (there were also five sons) of Archibald Balfour, a prosperous merchant in Russia, and his wife, Sophia. She was educated privately and made her mark on London society in the 1880s as an intelligent, quick-witted, and attractive young woman, who moved in the aristocratic circle of friends known as the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/42005', "Souls")</script>, which included A. J. Balfour, George Curzon, Margot Tennant (later Asquith), and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/34654/', "Alfred Lyttelton (1857&#150;1913)")</script>, her future husband. Lyttelton, a famous amateur athlete and cricketer, and a nephew of Gladstone, was the eighth son of the fourth Baron Lyttelton and his wife, Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Glynne. He had first married, in 1885, Laura, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Tennant (the elder sister of Margot), who died in 1886. Edith Balfour became his second wife on 18 April 1892 when they were married at Bordighera on the Italian riviera, and together they had two surviving children, a daughter, Mary Frances, who married Sir George Lillie Craik, second baronet, and a son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/31385/', "Oliver Lyttelton (1893&#150;1972)")</script>, who became first Viscount Chandos and, like his father, colonial secretary.<br>
<br>Alfred Lyttelton's first marriage to Laura Tennant had been extremely popular and her premature death, after having given birth to a baby son who survived her by only two years, was deeply mourned. His second marriage, though, was to prove no less popular, and Beatrice Webb, who met the Lytteltons in September 1892, thought them &#145;a charming pair &hellip; graceful, modest, intelligent and with the exquisite deference and ease which constitutes good breeding&#146;  (<span class="italic">Diary</span>, 2.22). After Alfred Lyttelton became Liberal Unionist MP for Leamington in 1895 Edith, or D. D. as she was commonly known, played successfully the role of the political wife, entertaining at their home in Great College Street, Westminster. She also exercised a significant influence on her husband's career. He habitually looked to her for advice and it was their joint decision that he should concentrate on politics rather than the bar after their marriage. She afterwards assisted him at elections, on occasion even speaking on his behalf, and as a convinced supporter of women's suffrage she encouraged his grudging acceptance of the cause. When in 1900 he was appointed chairman of a government committee to investigate monopolies in the Transvaal, she accompanied him; the experience better equipped her to support him when, as colonial secretary from 1903 to 1905, he had to defend the controversial use of Chinese labour in the Rand.<br>
<br>Their marriage was a genuine partnership, based upon strong mutual attraction and complementary ambitions, and after Alfred Lyttelton's sudden death on 5 July 1913 his wife published, in March 1917, a reverential biography. This was favourably reviewed in <span class="italic">The Times</span> as an &#145;intimate portrait&#146; of a universally beloved man  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 19 March 1917). It did not, though, meet with the approval of Virginia Woolf, to whom Edith Lyttelton had been held up in youth as an exemplar of &#145;charm and interest&#146;. Woolf was appalled by the emotionalism of the biography and imagined that it was the author and not the subject who hungered for worldly success: &#145;Poor man! I suppose she drove him on to be a celebrity and a politician, which wasn't his line. However, all his sins are paid for by this sort of monument&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters of Virginia Woolf</span>, 2.153). Whatever the merits of this assessment, Edith Lyttelton had a range of activities and interests to match those of her husband, and it is ironic that he was continually urging her, before his own untimely death, to reduce her engagements in the interests of her health.<br>
<br>One of Edith Lyttelton's chief interests, imperialism, was nurtured during her visit to South Africa in 1900. There she met, and developed a high regard for, Alfred, Viscount Milner, and discussed with him at length his political views. She returned to London determined to promote the imperial vision that they shared, and in Violet Markham and Violet Cecil, both of whom had also been to South Africa and had contact with Milner, she found like-minded partners. The three women were central figures behind the Victoria League, which was established in 1901 amid a wave of pro-imperial sentiment generated by the South African War. The league brought together high-ranking women from both sides of the political divide on the common ground of empire. It disseminated information, established an &#145;imperial library&#146;, raised funds for the relief of refugees and the tending of war graves, and provided hospitality for imperial visitors to England. Edith Lyttelton helped to found the movement and served as honorary secretary until she retired owing to ill health. She also supported the related cause of imperial preference, through the Women's Tariff Reform Association.<br>
<br>Lyttelton's strong philanthropic instincts, which were shared by her husband, also found outlets nearer home. She was involved in particular in the Edwardian campaign against &#145;sweated&#146; labour and this subject was the inspiration for two of her many plays. Her dramatic efforts were encouraged by her close friendship with George Bernard Shaw and Mrs Patrick Campbell, and the latter played the lead in <span class="italic">Warp and Woof</span>, Edith Lyttelton's first production, which opened at the Criterion in June 1904. The play dealt with the hardships experienced by women working in the London fashion industry and it was the subject matter, rather than the drama itself, that generated the most interest. Lyttelton's depiction of working women was dismissed by one society critic as unconvincing&#151;&#145;frank factory girls, speculating in broad cockney dialect as to what they would do if they were &#147;lydies&#148;&#146; (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 4 July 1904; Frances Balfour to the editor, 30 June 1904). But the accuracy of Lyttelton's portrayal of their exploitation could not be so easily dismissed, and was in fact vigorously defended in the correspondence columns of <span class="italic">The Times</span>.<br>
<br>Lyttelton returned to the theme in December 1912 with a study of the &#145;&#147;sweating&#148; system&#146; in <span class="italic">The Thumbscrew</span>, which had a single showing at the Little Theatre under the auspices of the Pioneer Players. In all she wrote seven plays, and a translation of Edmond Rostand's <span class="italic">Les deux pierrots</span>, but none ran for more than a few weeks and the last, an adaptation of Disraeli's <span class="italic">Tancred</span>, was condemned as &#145;unhappily tedious&#146; by <span class="italic">The Times</span> and &#145;intolerably tedious&#146; by Virginia Woolf (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 17 July 1923; <span class="italic">Diary of Virginia Woolf</span>, 2.258). It closed after a short run at the Kingsway Theatre in July 1923, but Lyttelton's love for the theatre remained unabated. She also wrote a novel, <span class="italic">The Sinclair Family</span> (1926), and <span class="italic">Travelling Days</span> (1933), an account of her travels in the Far East and India.<br>
<br>It is as a versatile public administrator, rather than an author, that Edith Lyttelton is to be remembered. She was particularly active in advancing the interests of working women and served on the first executive of the National Union of Women Workers, which was founded in 1895. She was also chairwoman of the Personal Service Association, established in London in 1908 to co-ordinate the efforts of well-to-do women who sought to alleviate distress arising from unemployment in the capital. At the outbreak of war Lyttelton was a founder of the war refugees committee, for which she was honoured with the m&eacute;daille de la reine &Eacute;lisabeth by the king of Belgium in June 1918. She was made deputy director of the women's branch of the Ministry of Agriculture in 1917, served on the central committee of women's employment from 1916 to 1925, and was vice-chairman of the Waste Reclamation Trade Board from 1924 to 1931. After the war she devoted herself to the League of Nations and was the British substitute delegate in Geneva (1923, 1926&#150;8, and 1931), where her interests focused on the opium trade and the &#145;white slave&#146; traffic. She was made a DBE in 1917 and a GBE in 1929 in recognition of her many public services.<br>
<br>After the death of her husband Edith Lyttelton became increasingly interested in spiritualism and was a member of the council of the Society for Psychical Research, serving as president in 1933&#150;4. She brought to this difficult subject an independent mind, and her calm reasoning convinced her of the existence of what she termed the &#145;superconscious&#146;&#151;a spiritually elevated version of the subconscious, which she believed enabled the properly receptive mind to foretell events and realize communion with the dead. She lectured on the subject and wrote many books, including <span class="italic">The Faculty of Communion</span> (1925), <span class="italic">Our Superconscious Mind</span> (1931), and <span class="italic">Some Cases of Prediction</span> (1937), and it also inspired her 1926 biography of her friend Florence Upton, the painter and creator of the &#145;golliwog&#146; character, who turned to spiritualism towards the end of her life.<br>
<br>Edith Lyttelton also devoted herself after 1918 to the foundation of a national theatre in London. This, she believed, should be &#145;a theatre where the prices of the seats should be within the reach of all; a true people's theatre dedicated to the highest expression of dramatic art&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 20 May 1924, Chandos to the editor). She was an effective member on the executive committee of the Shakespeare Memorial National Theatre, and her efforts in this direction were consciously carried forward by her son, who was the first chairman of the National Theatre (1962&#150;71). He remembered his mother as a woman &#145;catholic in her tastes and interests&#146;  (Chandos, xiv), and she combined the instincts of a Victorian imperialist and philanthropist with those of an Edwardian suffragist and social reformer, the imagination of a dramatist with the practical bent of a public administrator. She died at her home, 18 Great College Street, Westminster, London, on 2 September 1948.<br>
