<span class="headword">Maunsell,  Andrew</span>  (<em>b. </em><em>c.</em>1560, <em>d.</em> in or after 1604?), <span class="occ">bookseller and bibliographer</span>, was made free of the Drapers' Company by John Wight, himself active in the book trade, on 6 December 1574. The dates and circumstances of his birth, marriage, and death are unknown. Although never a member of the Stationers' Company, Maunsell was active as a bookseller and publisher from 1576, when there were printed for him, by Thomas East, <span class="italic">Jehovah. A Free Pardon. First Written in Spanish</span>, translated by J. Danyel, and, by John Charlewood, Thomas Rogers's <span class="italic">A Philosophicall Discourse, Entituled, The Anatomie of the Minde</span>. At least five other works by Rogers, chaplain to Archbishop Bancroft, were later published by Maunsell, whose investments were chiefly in theological works and in elementary textbooks.<br>
<br>Between 1576 and 1596 Maunsell financed the printing of some fifty-five imprints and was listed as selling seven others, and he bound his apprentices to freemen of the Stationers' Company. Among his more ambitious enterprises was the publication in folio in 1583, with Henry Denham, Thomas Chard, and William Broome, of a translation by Anthony Martin of Peter Martyr's <span class="italic">Common Places</span>. He occupied premises in St Paul's Churchyard from 1576 to 1589, first at the north-east quarter, at The Parrot, from 1576 to 1581; then at the West End from 1582 to 1583. In 1583 he returned to the north-east quarter, trading at the Brazen Serpent from 1584 to 1589. He then removed to a shop at the south entrance of the Royal Exchange, where he is found in 1592, and from there to Lothbury in 1594 to 1595. His device, formerly that of Richard Jugge, was a pelican with its young, rising phoenix-like, out of the flames, surrounded by the motto: <i>Pro lege, rege, grege</i>, expanded below in English as &#145;Love kepyth the lawe, obeyeth the kynge, and is good to the commen welthe&#146;.<br>
<br>In 1590 many of Maunsell's copies were transferred to Robert Dexter. There are no copies entered to him in this and the following year, and from 1592 to 1596 he appears on the title pages of only eight works, and chiefly as a bookseller rather than a publisher. It is reasonable to infer that it was at this time that he embarked on the compilation of the <span class="italic">Catalogue of English Printed Bookes</span>, which was to be his chief claim to fame. This catalogue, of which Maunsell himself completed only the first two parts, bore a triple dedication: to the Queen; to divines, &#145;for some soare so hie that they looke not so low, as on theire owne countrie writers&#146;; and to the Stationers' Company. This was something like the first attempt since John Bale's <span class="italic">Scriptores</span> to construct an English national bibliography. The plan was for the first volume to contain divinity; the second, science in all its branches, and music; and the third, literature, logic, law, and history.<br>
<br>The first two parts appeared in 1595, printed by John Windet and James Roberts respectively. The first part, devoted to divinity, expressly excludes &#145;Popish&#146; books printed overseas and books against the &#145;present government&#146;. It is arranged, like the second part, chiefly in alphabetical order of authors' surnames, where earlier models such as Gesner, Simler, and Bale had listed authors under their forenames, and it also contains thematic sections, devoted, for example, to sermons, catechisms, primers, and commentaries on books of the <span class="roman">Bible</span>. The second part, dedicated to Robert Devereux, second earl of Essex, is also prefaced by letters to the &#145;professors&#146; of mathematics and physic, to the Stationers' Company, and to booksellers in general. Both parts profess to contain only books that Maunsell has seen, and ample spaces are provided for additions.<br>
<br>Maunsell's catalogues provide confirmation of the existence at that time of a number of books of which no known copy survives and which are otherwise recorded only occasionally, if at all, in documentary sources. At the same time it falls short of completeness and several copies survive in which books unknown to Maunsell have been entered, among them one acquired, already sparsely annotated, by Thomas Baker, into which Baker has entered additions copied from Archbishop Harsnett's copy (Colchester, H.f.35) and added a few of his own up to 1602 (CUL, Adv.b.52.1); and another, now in the library of Trinity College, Cambridge (VI.3.60), which supplies many of the papist books omitted by Maunsell and also Latin books, arranged indiscriminately together, and copious other additions to 1595. There are several others substantially annotated (including Hunt., 54169, Harvard UL, B. 2076.1*, CUL, Syn 4.59.16, and University of Michigan, SPEC\Z\2002\451), but unfortunately no comprehensive census of annotated copies exists.<br>
<br>The promised third part of the catalogue (<span class="italic">Humanity</span>) did not appear under Maunsell's hand, and the want was not supplied until the appearance of the <span class="italic">Catalogue</span> of William London in 1658. It was at one time supposed that it was Maunsell's death that prevented the appearance of the third part of his <span class="italic">Catalogue</span>, but he was certainly still alive on 19 April 1596 when, in response to his petition to them, and on account of his &#145;paines in collectinge and printinge the Catalogue of bookes&#146;, the Stationers' Company granted him a &#145;benevolence&#146; in money and books &#145;the particulars of whiche money &amp; bookes appere in a Booke [no longer to be found] conteyning the names of the particular persons that contributed the same&#146;  (Greg and Boswell, 54), and almost certainly on 15 October 1604 when &#145;Andrewe Manssell, son of Andrew Mansell, citizen and stationer of London&#146; was apprenticed to Edmund Weaver, stationer, to serve with Thomas Wight  (Arber, <span class="italic">Regs. Stationers</span>, 2.285), without any indication that his father was deceased.<br>
