<span class="headword">Hervey,  William</span>, Baron Hervey of Kidbrooke and Baron Hervey of Ross  (<em>d.</em> 1642), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, was the only son of Henry Hervey, of Kidbrooke, Kent, and his wife, Jane, daughter of James Thomas of Llanfihangel, Monmouthshire. As a young man Hervey served aboard the lord admiral's flagship during the Armada campaign of 1588, earning renown in the action off Calais. In 1596 he commanded his own vessel, the <i>Darling</i> of Portsmouth, on the expedition to Cadiz, and was knighted by the earl of Essex. The following year he sailed on the voyage to the Azores as commander of the <i>Bonaventure</i>. In September 1598 he was one of several candidates for the comptrollership of the navy, though he failed to secure appointment. During 1599 he served as captain of the <i>Garland</i>, in the fleet based in the Downs under the command of Lord Thomas Howard. It is possible that he played some part in the war in Ireland in 1600. He served as MP for Horsham in 1601, when he was a member of a committee which was considering the Irish situation, and for Petersfield in 1604.<br>
<br>As a veteran of the Elizabethan sea war Hervey retained links with the navy during the early Stuart period. In 1618 he was a member of a committee investigating the ordnance office. On the outbreak of war with Spain in 1625 he was appointed to the council of war; he played an active role in advising the lord admiral on the Cadiz expedition. In December 1626 he became one of the special commissioners who were investigating the state of the navy. He was involved in a survey of naval vessels in January 1627, and in February he was consulted about the number of ships to be employed in the guard of the channel. Later in the year he served as rear-admiral aboard the <i>Repulse</i> on the expedition to the &Icirc;le de R&eacute;, to relieve La Rochelle.<br>
<br>Hervey acquired various offices and honours during his career. He became a gentleman pensioner at the court of Elizabeth I some time before 1587. In 1598 he was made keeper of St Andrew's Castle in Hampshire, with a fee of &pound;19 3<i>s</i>. 4<i>d</i>., although he surrendered the post in 1604. He was granted the office of remembrancer of first fruits and tenths in 1603. He was created a baronet on 31 May 1619 and became Baron Hervey of Ross, in co. Wexford, on 5 August 1620. He was made an English baron on 27 February 1628, reportedly to strengthen the royal cause in the upper house  (<span class="italic">Buccleuch MSS</span>, 3.324). As Baron Hervey of Kidbrooke he was rarely absent from the House of Lords during the session of 1628, and he sat on a wide range of committees.<br>
<br>In 1598 Hervey married Mary (<i>d</i>. 1607), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/3667/', "Anthony Browne, first Viscount Montagu")</script>, and widow of Henry Wriothesley, second earl of Southampton (1545&#150;1581), and of Thomas Heneage (<i>d</i>. 1595). The negotiations concerning the match were shrouded in mystery, probably because of hostility from the third earl of Southampton, whose &#145;discomfort and discontentment&#146; with the marriage were conveyed to his mother by the earl of Essex in November 1598  (<span class="italic">Salisbury MSS</span>, 14.80). Following the death of his first wife in 1607 Hervey married in 1608 Cordelia, daughter and coheir of Brian Annesley of Leigh in Kent. They had three sons and four daughters before her death in 1636. Hervey was survived by only one of his daughters, Elizabeth, who married a cousin, John Hervey of Ickworth. At his death in London in 1642 he owned land in Wexford, a house at St Martin-in-the-Fields, Westminster, as well as the manor of Kidbrooke. The latter was valued at &pound;1000 before 1614. A respected and well connected naval officer, Hervey has sometimes been identified as a possible candidate for William Shakespeare's &#145;Mr. W. H.&#146;. He was buried in Westminster Abbey on 8 July 1642.<br>
