<span class="headword">Lings,  Martin</span>  (1909&#150;2005), <span class="occ">scholar of Islam</span>, was born on 24 January 1909 at Barciecroft, Burnage Lane, Burnage, Lancashire, the son of George Herbert Lings, cotton spinner and ornithologist, and his wife, Gladys Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Greenhalgh. After spending much of his childhood in the United States he returned to England to finish his studies. He became head boy at Clifton College, Bristol, and matriculated at Magdalen College, Oxford, in 1929 to read classics, but soon switched to English. At Oxford he came under the influence of C. S. Lewis, who encouraged the cultivation of his literary gifts. Throughout childhood Lings had experienced &#145;nostalgia for the past&#146;  (Lings, &#145;Frithjof Schuon&#146;, 15), and Lewis's compelling evocation of the &#145;surpassing greatness of the Middle Ages&#146;  (Lings, <span class="italic">The Elements</span>, 9) provided him with a fixed point from which to judge other epochs. Though Lewis awakened in Lings a love for Old English poetry and Dante's <span class="italic">Divine Comedy</span>, Lings did not follow Lewis into Christian faith. Before coming to Oxford he had forsaken corporate worship. Though he had not abandoned private prayer he focused instead on the search for beauty in literature, nature, and art. When he left Oxford with a second-class degree in English in 1932 the composition of poetry was his sole aspiration.<br>
<br>In 1935 Lings accepted a lectureship in Anglo-Saxon and Middle English at Vytautas Magnus University in Kaunas, Lithuania, where he remained until 1939. During this period he discovered the writings of the French traditionalist Ren&eacute; Gu&eacute;non. In his encounter with Gu&eacute;non Lings felt he had come &#145;face to face with the truth&#146;  (Lings, &#145;Frithjof Schuon&#146;, 15). Gu&eacute;non criticized the marginalization of religion in modern civilization and argued for the existence of a common core of esoteric truth in all of the world's great faiths. But Gu&eacute;non believed esoteric truth was best pursued through the adoption of a valid form of religious ritual under the guidance of a spiritual master. After corresponding with Gu&eacute;non Lings looked first to Hinduism, but soon turned to Islam. In 1938, with the approval of Gu&eacute;non, he visited Frithjof Schuon, another traditionalist thinker who lived in Switzerland. Schuon had been initiated into the Shadhiliyyah Sufi order by the celebrated Algerian Sheikh Ahmad al-&#145;Alawi in 1932 and under Schuon's guidance Lings embraced Islam and took the name Abu Bakr Siraj ad-Din.<br>
<br>Adrian Patterson was a close friend of Lings from Oxford and shared his literary tastes and spiritual interests. Patterson had taken up a position at Cairo University and become an intimate of Gu&eacute;non's household. In 1939 Lings went to Cairo to visit both Patterson and Gu&eacute;non and the outbreak of the Second World War prevented him from leaving. In a fateful turn of events in the coming months Patterson died tragically in a horse riding accident and Lings took his place as a lecturer in English literature at the university. He also replaced Patterson as Gu&eacute;non's personal assistant. During these years Lings temporarily abandoned his poetic ambitions and focused on his spiritual pursuits. He concentrated on learning Arabic and writing a manuscript later published as <span class="italic">The Book of Certainty: the Sufi Doctrine of Faith, Wisdom and Gnosis</span> (1952), which reflected the maturation of his newfound convictions. On 14 August 1944, while on leave back in England, Lings married Lesley Smalley, a childhood friend with whom he had kept in touch over the years. Aged thirty-one at their marriage, she was a chartered physiotherapist, and daughter of Edgar Smalley, cotton waste merchant. There were no children of the marriage.<br>
<br>Gu&eacute;non's death in 1951 and the Egyptian revolution of 1952 signalled the end of Lings's Egyptian sojourn. When the new government dismissed British staff from Cairo University he returned to England. There he resumed his education at the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London, where he graduated BA in Arabic in 1954 and PhD in 1959. He also secured a job as assistant keeper (1955&#150;70), deputy keeper (1970&#150;71), and finally keeper (1971&#150;3) of oriental manuscripts and printed books at the British Museum.<br>
<br>Though Gu&eacute;non had become estranged from Schuon before his death and Schuon had distanced himself from Islam, Lings remained loyal to his mentors. He also remained committed to Islam, becoming a leading expositor of the Sufi vein of traditionalist thought. Through a series of publications including <span class="italic">A Muslim Saint of the Twentieth Century</span> (1961), the revised version of his PhD dissertation, on Sheikh Ahmad al-&#145;Alawi, Lings earned a reputation as a sympathetic and incisive commentator on Sufi mysticism. In 1976 he was closely involved with the World of Islam festival in London and wrote the festival's companion volume on Koranic calligraphy. However, his most highly acclaimed work was undoubtedly <span class="italic">Muhammad: his Life Based on the Earliest Sources</span> (1983), for which he received commendations from the governments of Pakistan and Egypt. In this work Lings followed the earliest traditions and utilized his own considerable literary abilities to produce a vivid narrative of the Prophet's life from a believer's perspective. His other published works included studies of the esoteric meanings in Shakespeare's plays, and a volume of <span class="italic">Collected Poems</span> (1987, revised and expanded 2002).<br>
<br>Lings was a diminutive man. Lewis once likened his movements about Magdalen College to those of a &#145;furtive mouse&#146;  (<span class="italic">Collected Letters</span>, 2.24). He was also a gentle, serious individual who gave generously of his time to those seeking spiritual guidance. He died of heart failure at his home, 3 French Street, Westerham, Kent, on 12 May 2005, and was buried beneath the garden he had so lovingly tended. A memorial service was held in the chapel of Magdalen College, Oxford, on 24 September 2005. He was survived by his wife, Lesley.<br>
