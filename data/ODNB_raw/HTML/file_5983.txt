<span class="headword">Colonia,  Adam Isaacszoon  de</span>  (1634&#150;1685), <span class="occ">painter</span>, was born in Rotterdam on 12 August 1634, the son of the painter Isaac Adamszoon de Colonia (1611&#150;1663) and Machtelt Becx. De Colonia probably trained under his father, as well as his grandfather Adam Louiszoon de Colonia (1574&#150;1651), also a painter. In his early career de Colonia was influenced by the importation of fully fledged Italianate styles into Utrecht, and possibly also by Dutch Italianate models such as Nicolaes Berchem (1620&#150;1683).<br>
<br>De Colonia married Cornelia, daughter of Arendt Kerckhoven, in Rotterdam on 28 December 1661, and they had four children. He is recorded in Rotterdam in 1669. Some time after this they moved to London, and are listed as members of the Dutch Reformed church at Austin Friars in 1674. In Britain, de Colonia continued to produce the village genre scenes and biblical and Italianate landscapes, with lively figures, that had characterized his work in Rotterdam. He often painted night scenes, and pastoral images, following the development of these themes by Francesco Bassano (1549&#150;1592) in Venice. De Colonia reportedly copied the Bassano paintings&#151;presumably those by Jacopo&#151;in the Royal Collection, and maintained a steady reputation in Britain throughout his career, with his imitations &#145;esteemed his best performances&#146;  (Buckeridge, 407). He occasionally etched. De Colonia was buried in St Martin-in-the-Fields, London, on 10 September 1685, after which his reputation lessened. Examples of his work are in museums in Holland; Lille, France; and Copenhagen, Denmark.<br>
<br>One of de Colonia's sons, <a name="cosubject_74474"></a><span class="headword">Hendrick Adriaen  de Colonia</span>  (1668&#150;1701/2), often called Adrian de Colonia, also became a <span class="occ">painter</span> with some contemporary reputation. Born on 17 April 1668, Hendrick probably trained with his father, and the chief source of his fame is the figures he inserted into landscapes painted by Adriaen van Diest, a Dutch artist working in London, who was also Hendrick's brother-in-law through his sister Huberta. He also drew a number of &#145;academy pieces&#146;  (Buckeridge, 407), and some landscapes, rougher in style than those of his father. He is reputed to have died, and been buried with his father in St Martin-in-the-Fields, in 1701 or 1702, aged thirty-three, but there is no record of this.<br>
