<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Heim,  Bruno Bernard</span>  (1911&#150;2003), <span class="occ">archbishop of Xanthos and papal diplomatist</span>, was born in Olten, Switzerland, on 5 March 1911, the son of Bernard Heim, stationmaster, and his wife, Elisabeth Studer-Heim, teacher. He had one brother, Karl, to whom he remained very close until Karl's death in the early 1980s. Heim was educated by the Benedictines at Engelberg, where he first developed an interest in heraldry, and to which he left his heraldic library. In 1938, after studies in Rome, he was ordained priest for the diocese of Solothurn. Back in Switzerland he worked for two years with Polish and Italian refugees before being recalled to Rome to study canon law at the Pontificia Accademia Ecclesiastica, the Vatican's institution for the training of its diplomats. Meanwhile he continued his heraldic studies.<br>
<br>Heim's diplomatic career began in Paris, where he was appointed to the nuncio, Archbishop Angelo Roncalli. From Paris he was sent to Vienna and then to Bonn as charg&eacute; d'affaires. In 1958 Roncalli was elected pope as John XXIII and immediately sought advice from Heim about the papal coat-of-arms. The design was to incorporate the lion of Venice (where Roncalli had been patriarch), but when Heim sent his first design Roncalli complained that the lion was too severe. The two of them finally agreed on a lion on whose face a smile is discernible. Many other commissions followed, including from John XXIII's three successors as pope, Paul VI, John Paul I, and John Paul II. The last of these proved the most difficult for Heim. John Paul II insisted on keeping the arms he had had in Cracow, which incorporated the letter M (for the Virgin Mary). Heim argued that letters are not traditionally used in heraldry, but the pope was adamant, and so the papal arms appeared with a large and quite severe M in one quarter. Heim was well respected among heraldists worldwide, and was proud to have been elected patron of the Cambridge University Heraldic and Genealogical Society. His book on ecclesiastical heraldry, <span class="italic">Heraldry in the Catholic Church</span> (1978, revised and enlarged 1981), was widely regarded as the authority on the subject.<br>
<br>Heim's first appointment as papal representative was to Scandinavia (1961&#150;9), with the title of archbishop of Xanthos, a long-defunct diocese. When people asked him where this was, Heim&#151;often accused of a lack of sense of humour&#151;would reply, &#145;Most of it is now in the British Museum&#146;  (private information). He did valuable work in Scandinavia, especially in building bridges with other churches, as he did in his next appointment as pro-nuncio in Egypt (1969&#150;73). His fluency in a number of languages helped him greatly wherever he was posted.<br>
<br>In 1973 Heim was appointed apostolic delegate to the court of St James and took up residence in Wimbledon. The title &#145;delegate&#146; indicated that there were not full diplomatic relations between the Vatican and the court of St James but, partly as a result of Heim's efforts, the two parties normalized diplomatic relations not long before the pope's visit to England, Scotland, and Wales in 1982. Thus Heim became the first apostolic pro-nuncio (as the Vatican calls its ambassadors) to the United Kingdom.<br>
<br>Pope John Paul II came to England in May 1982, but Heim did not regard it as anything like the climax of his work in London. It was noticed that the pope did not seem to engage his representative in the sort of private conversations one might expect, but relations between the two were not the best. Heim had been critical of what he saw as the Holy See's intransigence, above all in moral matters, and at one point the cardinal-prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith had asked Heim to put his views on paper. To Heim's chagrin (and with consequent damage to his reputation with the pope) Cardinal Seper seems to have shown to the pope what Heim had intended to be a first draft.<br>
<br>Heim's pastoral concern meant that he was always available to any priest who wanted to talk. He was also careful not to be seen to interfere in the work of the Catholic bishops in the countries for which he was responsible. In this way he earned great respect among them. By the time he left London in 1985 he had been responsible for the appointment of many of the bishops in England, Scotland, and Wales. It was one of those appointments that gave him the greatest satisfaction. When Cardinal John Carmel Heenan, archbishop of Westminster, died in November 1975, the succession created great problems for Heim. It was clear that one of the obvious candidates might not actually be welcomed by all in Westminster. And so Heim began the search for a successor&#151;one of the most important and sensitive tasks of a papal representative. The bishop of Leeds, William Gordon Wheeler, suggested that Heim might consider the abbot of Ampleforth, the relatively unknown Basil Hume. Heim set about the complex task, made more challenging because another important diocese, Liverpool, had also become vacant. But Heim saw the path of wisdom and Hume was ordained as archbishop of Westminster in March 1976. Heim had asked to be one of the ordaining bishops. In his retirement he always insisted that this was what he regarded as his greatest service to the church.<br>
<br>In retirement in Switzerland Heim continued to live in the family home, designing and painting coats of arms. He paid his last visit to England in June 2001. When his wheelchair was halted at the immigration desk, the woman at the desk asked him the purpose of his visit. He beamed broadly and said, somewhat to her astonishment, &#145;On Friday I am having lunch with the queen mum!&#146;  (private information). Heim died in Olten, Switzerland, on 18 March 2003, and was buried from the parish church there.<br>
