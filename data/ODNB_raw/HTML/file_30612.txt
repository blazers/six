<span class="headword">Barnett,  Samuel Augustus</span>  (1844&#150;1913), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and social reformer</span>, the elder son of Francis Augustus Barnett (<i>d</i>. 27 Dec 1883) and his wife, Mary Gilmore (<i>d</i>. 6 Nov 1880) of Bristol, was born at 5 Portland Square, Bristol, on 8 February 1844. His father was a wealthy manufacturer of iron bedsteads; his mother came from a long-established Bristol merchant family engaged chiefly in overseas shipping. Educated at home, Barnett went in June 1862 to Wadham College, Oxford. Undistinguished as a student (second class in law and modern history 1865, BA 1865, MA 1869), he subsequently was revered by generations of university men for bringing them in direct and living contact with the problems of the urban poor: Barnett House, founded at Oxford University in 1914 to promote the study of social problems, stands as testimony to this legacy. Barnett claimed that a journey to the United States in 1867 eradicated the last traces of his inherited tory prejudices. When he returned to England in December 1867 to be a curate at St Mary's, Bryanston Square, London, under William Henry Fremantle (later dean of Ripon), he struck contemporaries as a rather ordinary young man, distinguished more by his scraggly beard, balding pate, and dishevelled appearance than by any great promise.<br>
<br>Barnett's abilities as a worker on behalf of the Marylebone poor became quickly evident during his curacy under Fremantle. During these years (1867&#150;73) he shared Fremantle's zeal both for church reform, which brought Barnett into contact with men like Arnold Toynbee, and for reforming the organization of charity in London. The latter led to the founding of the Society for Repressing Mendicity and Organising Charity (better known as the Charity Organization Society or COS) in 1869. Through the COS Barnett came under the influence of the housing reformer Octavia Hill, who in turn introduced him to one of her young workers, his future wife, Henrietta Octavia Weston Rowland [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30610/', "Barnett, Dame Henrietta Octavia Weston")</script>].<br>
<br>Married on 28 January 1873, Samuel and Henrietta shared and inspired one another's work for the next forty years. Shortly after their marriage they went to St Jude's, Whitechapel, a notoriously poor and lawless parish in east London, where their imposition of COS principles, including the curtailment of outdoor relief, dismayed the poor but established their reputations as formidable reformers. Convinced of the benefits of direct one-to-one relations between rich and poor, the Barnetts none the less began in the early 1880s to distance themselves from the rigid opposition of the central office of the COS to all forms of state-funded assistance outside the new poor law (1834 and later legislation). They forged an alternative vision of social politics, &#145;practicable socialism&#146;, which combined a reverence for individual initiative and self-improvement with municipal and state support intended to address specific material needs. They also often found themselves in disfavour with traditional Anglicans who distrusted their innovations in Sunday worship, such as oratorios and picture exhibitions. Imbued with the aesthetic theories of John Ruskin, Barnett insisted that &#145;pictures &hellip; could take the place of parables&#146;  (Barnett to Bishop Jackson, 3 April 1882, Fulham MSS, vol. 2) as moral teachers to the poor. Under the Barnetts' aegis, the annual picture exhibitions held in the St Jude's schoolrooms grew into the Whitechapel Art Gallery, which was opened in 1901. Barnett further alienated some Anglicans of varied persuasions in 1884 when, on a non-denominational basis, he launched the scheme on which his fame most securely rests, Toynbee Hall, the university settlement in Whitechapel. Octavia Hill, his erstwhile mentor, was so disturbed by what she viewed as Barnett's lax churchmanship that she supported a rival plan undertaken on an explicitly religious basis by the high-church party of Keble College, the Oxford House settlement in Bethnal Green. Barnett's connections with Whitechapel lasted throughout his life, though he resigned St Jude's in 1893 to serve as a canon of Bristol, by which title he is best-known to posterity. In 1895 he was a select preacher at Oxford, and at Cambridge in 1889 and 1905; from 1906 to 1913 he was canon, and finally subdean, of Westminster.<br>
<br>While Barnett's fame rests mostly on his accomplishments as a secular social reformer, he was actuated by deep religious convictions informed by the teachings of the Christian socialist F. D. Maurice. His friend Beatrice Webb credited Barnett with importantly shaping the &#145;rediscovery&#146; of poverty in the 1880s and social reform in late Victorian England by his insistence that &#145;the sense of sin has been the starting-point of progress&#146;  (Webb, 174). During his first decade at St Jude's, Barnett developed an extensive network of clubs and classes to address not only the spiritual but the intellectual and recreative needs of his parishioners. The unpopularity of these ventures encouraged him to think of an alternative non-parochial institutional framework for his work. Barnett capitalized on the anxieties unleashed by the sensational pamphlet about slum life <span class="italic">The Bitter Cry of Outcast London</span> (1883). He announced a plan to establish what he called a settlement, a residential colony of university men, committed to no particular religious creed, who would live among the poor as friends, neighbours, social-scientific observers, and practical social workers. From 1884 to 1906 he served as warden of Toynbee Hall, which attracted distinguished visitors and many imitators worldwide.<br>
<br>A man of abiding humility and optimism, Barnett believed in the potential goodness and educability of all people regardless of their life station. He was closely associated with university extension in east London, the Oxford Day Training College, pupil-teacher centres, and the Workers' Educational Association. There were few movements for social, cultural, or moral improvement of the poor in which Barnett did not take a prominent part. While <span class="italic">Punch</span> gently mocked his cultural philanthropy, Barnett was also actively involved in many initiatives to improve the economic and material conditions of the poor, including slum clearance and housing reform (he was a leading promoter of the <span class="roman">Artisans' Dwelling Act</span> of 1875), old-age pensions, and labour farm colonies. He died at 69 Kings Esplanade, Hove, Sussex, on 17 June 1913; the funeral service on 21 June was, at Barnett's own instructions, held at St Jude's, but there is a memorial to him in Westminster Abbey; his remains were cremated. Predeceased by his adopted ward, Dorothy Woods, he had no children.<br>
<br>M. Clemenceau remarked in 1884 that Barnett was one of the &#145;three really great men&#146;  (Barnett, 2.45) he had met in England. While Barnett was an effective speaker and a pithy, aphoristic writer, his &#145;greatness&#146; lay in his personality. His public and private persona were marked by a singular lack of vanity in his own achievements and a keenly tolerant sympathy for others which enabled him to discover what was best in those he counselled and help them to make it effective. His impact on twentieth-century Britain is most apparent in the work of the men whose lives he influenced during their residence at Toynbee Hall, including Robert Morant, Hubert Llewellyn-Smith, R. H. Tawney, William Beveridge, and Clement Attlee. Barnett's most important published works include <span class="italic">Practicable Socialism</span> (co-authored with Henrietta Barnett in 1888), <span class="italic">Religion and Progress</span> (1907), <span class="italic">Religion and Politics</span> (1911), <span class="italic">Worship and Work</span> (1913), and <span class="italic">Vision and Service</span> (1917), the two last-named published posthumously and edited by Henrietta Barnett.<br>
