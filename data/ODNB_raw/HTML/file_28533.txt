<span class="headword">Wallace,  James</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1678), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was the only son of Matthew Wallace (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1641), laird of Dundonald in Ayrshire, and his wife, Agnes Somervell. In 1629 James Wallace married Jean Hay, daughter of the late John Hay of Renfield, minister at Renfrew; she died before 5 March 1638. In that year James Wallace's father sold the estate of Dundonald to Sir William Cochrane; even after the sale James was still sometimes called Wallace of Auchans after an important part of the Dundonald estate.<br>
<br>In 1642 Wallace went to Ireland as a captain in Major-General Robert Munro's regiment. In April 1644 he was one of the petitioners of the Ulster army to the Scottish estates for arrears of pay and supplies. In 1645 he was recalled with 200 men of the regiment as part of Home's commanded foot to oppose the progress of Montrose. He joined the covenanters under General Baillie and was taken prisoner at the battle of Kilsyth.<br>
<br>Wallace returned to Ireland before 1647. In November 1648 the Scottish committee of estates sent Wallace, now a major, to Ulster to recruit anti-engager troops for the Scottish army. On 30 March 1649 he was noted as being an officer in one of Monck's Ulster regiments along with the crypto-royalist Lord Montgomery of Ards. About the same time he was appointed governor of Belfast, but he was deprived of this position in June. Soon afterwards he removed to Kedhall, Ballycarry, near Carrickfergus, where he married in 1649 or 1650 a daughter of Mr Edmonstone of Ballycarry. On 10 August 1649 the estates gave him the lieutenant-colonelcy of the Irish foot, which was recruited from the anti-royalist refugees of the Ulster civil war of March&#150;July. In May 1650 Wallace acted as warden of Montrose during the latter's imprisonment before his execution in Edinburgh. Following Charles II's return to Scotland, Wallace's regiment (commanded by Archibald, Lord Lorne), owing to its fierce loyalty to the kirk party regime, was named His Majesty's life guard of foot. Wallace served with it during Lieutenant-General David Leslie's successful defence of Edinburgh. At the battle of Dunbar, Wallace was again made prisoner. On his colonel's petition, as a reward for his services, he was referred to the committee of estates for him to be assigned part of the &#145;excise or maintenance&#146; due from Ayrshire.<br>
<br>After the Restoration Wallace seems initially to have lived in retirement. However, he may have been connected with the plans for a general rising in Ireland, the Dublin Plot of 1663. In September 1665 he was named as one of those leading dissidents ordered to be rounded up by the Scottish authorities, but he escaped to Ireland and took refuge with his wife's kin near Carrickfergus. By the autumn of 1666 he was back in Edinburgh, part of a committee almost certainly planning a general rising which was in contact with the dissidents of Galloway. When the Pentland rising flared up independently of such schemes Wallace was one of those resolute that it &#145;was our duty to own our brethren in Galloway, yea, and to go with them, and take share with them in what should be their lot&#146;  (Wallace, 389). On 18 November, a few days after the rising had sparked off, he set off to join them, and on 21 November he took command at the bridge of Doon, and led them in their march on Edinburgh. One of his earliest prisoners was Sir James Turner, who had been his companion in arms twenty-three years before. During his captivity Turner was constantly with Wallace, of whose character and rebellion he gives a detailed account in his <span class="italic">Memoir</span> (1829). On 28 November Wallace's forces and the king's, under the command of his former comrade in Munro's foot, General Tam Dalzell of the Binns, met at Rullion Green, 7 miles from Edinburgh. Wallace and his heavily outnumbered force of 600&#150;700 foot and 800 horse were defeated at the ensuing, hard-fought battle. With his followers, he fled. He escaped to the Netherlands where he took the name of Forbes and wrote &#145;A narrative of the rising at Pentland&#146;. He was condemned and forfaulted on 15 August 1667 by the justice court at Edinburgh, and this sentence was ratified by parliament on 15 December 1669. At the time of the assassination of Archbishop Sharp in July 1668 he was thought to have been in hiding in Edinburgh and then escaped to Ireland.<br>
<br>In exile Wallace was obliged to move from place to place for several years to avoid his enemies, who were on the look-out for him. He afterwards lived at Rotterdam, where he became an elder of the Scottish church; but on the complaint of Henry Wilkie, whom the king had placed at the head of the Scottish factory at Kamperveen, Wallace was ordered to return from Zeeland. Wallace, however, went back to the Netherlands some time afterwards, and died at Rotterdam at the end of 1678. He left one son, who succeeded to his father's property because the sentence of death and fugitation passed against him after the Pentland rising was rescinded at the revolution of 1688.<br>
