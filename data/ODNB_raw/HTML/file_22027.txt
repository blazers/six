<span class="headword">Peter <span class="st"> [Peters]</span>,  Thomas</span>  (1597&#150;1654/5), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and colonist in America</span>, was born at Fowey in Cornwall and baptized there in June 1597, the second child and elder son among the three children of Thomas Peter or Dickwoode (1571&#150;1625), merchant, and his first wife, Martha (<i>bap</i>. 1572, <i>d</i>. 1598), daughter of John Treffry of Place and Emblem Tresithney; <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22024/', "Hugh Peter (bap. 1598, d. 1660)")</script> was his younger brother. Admitted to Brasenose College, Oxford, on 12 November 1610, Peter graduated BA on 30 June 1614 and proceeded MA on 6 April 1625. By 1628 he was serving as vicar of Mylor in Kerrier hundred, Cornwall. On 25 September 1632 he married Anne Rawe; they had a son, John, and four daughters, Mary, Sarah, Ann, and Elizabeth, living at the time he drew up his will in 1654.<br>
<br>At the time the Long Parliament was called, Peter was numbered among the few puritan ministers in Cornwall. The county became a royalist stronghold during the first civil war, and, probably in 1643, Peter was driven out by Sir Ralph Hopton. He arrived in New England in 1644, apparently without his wife and children, and by the next year was living at Saybrook Fort, possibly serving as chaplain to George Fenwick there. Peter was related to the Winthrop clan (John Winthrop the younger having married his brother, Hugh's, stepdaughter Elizabeth Reade) and became involved with young Winthrop's plan to create an independent plantation at Pequot (later New London, Connecticut). When a church was gathered there in 1646, he was called as its first minister. During his time in New England he was involved with Native Americans in the Connecticut River region, especially the Pequot leader, Uncas. His earliest surviving letter relates a visit to Uncas in spring 1645; the following year he complained of Uncas for &#145;a plott etc &amp; for some iniurious and hostil insolencies&#146; and in 1647 he sparked a confrontation with Uncas over hunting rights and tributary Indians  (N. B. Shurtleff, ed., <span class="italic">Records of the Colony of New Plymouth</span>, vol. 9, 1859, 71, 99&#150;100). His household at Pequot included another stepdaughter of Hugh Peter (Margaret Lake) as well as her daughter. His correspondence reveals that he practised medicine, although he seems to have deferred to Winthrop on such matters.<br>
<br>Peter's decision to return to England appears to have been made suddenly in the autumn of 1646 and he travelled to Boston to await a ship. Initially he contracted to go home in the <i>Supply</i> but, after John Cotton preached a sermon predicting that the voyage would be troubled if a petition (known as the remonstrance) was taken to London aboard the vessel, he changed his plans and travelled on another ship by way of Spain. The voyages of the <i>Supply</i> and of his new ship were difficult, but both reached London safely. Upon his arrival Peter reported finding his brother Hugh &#145;sad afflicted&#146;  (<span class="italic">Winthrop Papers</span>, 150). Before leaving London to resume his duties in Cornwall he raised money for the school in Roxbury, Massachusetts.<br>
<br>Peter then returned to Mylor, serving as minister there until his death. During these years he engaged in a long drawn-out controversy with Samson Bond, rector of Mawgan in Meneague, Cornwall, whom he accused of plagiarizing sermons and of unsound doctrine. According to Peter's own account, published as an appendix to <span class="italic">A Remedie Against Ruine</span> (1652), a sermon preached at Launceston assizes, he got the better of this confrontation. At the end of his life he seems to have been discouraged about the effects of his preaching, describing his ministry at Cornwall as &#145;with little successe to soules&#146;  (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/243, fols. 238<i>v</i>&#150;239<i>v</i>). He died at an unknown date between 26 October 1654, when, &#145;having some of deathes sentences upon my Body&#146;, he drew up his will, and 19 January 1655, when it was proved. He was buried in Mylor churchyard. Anne Peter survived her husband.<br>
