<span class="headword">Haime,  John</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1708, <em>d.</em> 1784), <span class="occ">soldier and Methodist preacher</span>, was born in Shaftesbury, Dorset, and baptized at Holy Trinity Church in Shaftesbury on 18 February 1708 (though he gave the date of his birth as 1710 in his autobiography), the son of a gardener. He followed his father's occupation for several years, but disliked it; he left to work with his uncle as a button maker, first in Shaftesbury and then in Blandford, Dorset. At this period he suffered from acute religious depression and gave himself up to &#145;drinking, swearing, card-playing, lewdness&#146;  (&#145;Short account of God's dealings&#146;, 209). Tired of button making, he was employed by a tanner, and then enlisted in the Queen's regiment of dragoons. On Christmas day 1739 he parted with his wife and children (of whom nothing further is known) to march for Gloucester, and in the course of the following year was at various camps in Hampshire, Oxfordshire, and Wiltshire.<br>
<br>In Highworth, Wiltshire, Haime found among other old books John Bunyan's spiritual autobiography, <span class="italic">Grace Abounding to the Chief of Sinners</span>: &#145;I read it with the utmost attention, and found his case nearly resembled my own&#146;  (&#145;Short account of God's dealings&#146;, 211). The regiment was ordered to march for Scotland, and on the first day he bought <span class="italic">Grace Abounding</span> from a bookseller in Banbury, Oxfordshire. Bunyan's account clearly influenced Haime's interpretation of his experiences and the autobiography he was to write at John Wesley's request at the end of his life. Throughout this period he was a regular churchgoer, but he found no solace and was often tempted to blaspheme. By the bank of the River Tweed he felt that God had lifted him out of his dungeon, but he had recurrent experiences of despair and release. He was sent by sea from Leith to London with the camp equipage, and at Deptford went to hear the Calvinist Methodist John Cennick, then one of George Whitefield's preachers. After hearing his account Cennick told him the work of the devil was on him, but he was later comforted by reading Cennick's own life. On rejoining the regiment he heard Charles Wesley preach at Brentford, Middlesex, and was much encouraged by speaking to him.<br>
<br>In June 1742 Haime's regiment embarked for Flanders, and in February 1743 began their march from Ghent to Germany. After further alternations of relief and despondency, on 22 April, while walking in the fields, he thought God at last answered his prayer: &#145;My head was as waters, and my eyes as a fountain of tears. I wept: I sung&#146;  (&#145;Short account of God's dealings&#146;, 215). At the battle of Dettingen (27 June 1743 <span class="smallcap">NS</span>), in which the British, Hanoverian, and Austrian armies defeated the French, he found his heart filled with love, peace, and joy, and stood the enemy fire for seven hours. In winter quarters at Ghent in 1743&#150;4 he started a meeting for prayer and <span class="roman">Bible</span> reading with two fellow soldiers, John Evans and Pitman Stag, and their number soon increased to twelve. John Wesley replied encouragingly to his letter of 2 February 1744 asking for advice (<span class="italic">Journal of John Wesley</span>, 3.115&#150;16; <span class="italic">Letters</span>, 2.19). Haime's success as a preacher was remarkable. At camp near Brussels in May 1744 he usually had 1000 hearers. When he settled in any camp he built a tabernacle with two or three rooms; he soon had 300 members in his society and six preachers beside himself, including Evans and William Clements. He often walked 20 to 30 miles a day and preached 35 times in a week. At the battle of Fontenoy (11 May 1745 <span class="smallcap">NS</span>), in which the allies were defeated by the French, several members of the society were killed&#151;Evans lost both his legs and died praising God&#151;though Haime himself was unharmed and went through the battle full of joy. Their bravery was praised in a letter by John Wesley of 26 October 1745, rebuking the troops camped near Newcastle for blasphemy  (<span class="italic">Journal of John Wesley</span>, 3.216&#150;17).<br>
<br>For nearly three years Haime had a full assurance of faith, until on 6 April 1746 he fell instantaneously into despair, the symptoms of which were physical as well as mental: he wept and howled, he partly lost his sight, he thought he was on fire. For seven years he continued to suffer, but he went on preaching and converting others. He returned to England, was discharged from the army, and joined the Methodists as a travelling preacher, sometimes accompanying Wesley. Many thought him &#145;very unstable&#146;, but Wesley assured him that it was good for him to be in the fiery furnace  (&#145;Short account of God's dealings&#146;, 307&#150;8). He set up a society in his home town of Shaftesbury, and was briefly imprisoned in Dorchester gaol because he would not undertake to give up preaching. He twice went to Ireland as a travelling preacher, still in great distress of mind.<br>
<br>In 1766 Wesley tried to help by sending Haime to live with John Hoskins, a farmer in Cornwall, as a kind of domestic chaplain. Haime's agony increased, until suddenly he felt freed from his bondage. But he could not bear to stay in one place, and went back on circuit. In looking back over his life for Wesley he divided it into twenty years before his conversion, three years of faith, twenty years in the wilderness, and his present deliverance. His account was designed to show that God did not will that any should perish  (&#145;Short account of God's dealings&#146;, 313). It is important as a detailed record of Methodist practices in the army in the 1740s, as a powerful analysis by a deeply unbalanced man of his own mental suffering, and as a masterpiece in the tradition of the seventeenth-century spiritual autobiography. Haime died on 18 August 1784 at Whitchurch, Hampshire, worn to skin and bone by fever.<br>
