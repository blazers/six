<span class="headword">Lyster, Sir  Richard</span>  (<em>c.</em>1480&#150;1553), <span class="occ">judge</span>, was the son of John Lyster of Wakefield, Yorkshire, and his wife, who was one of the Beaumont family of Whitley. His grandfather Thomas had settled in that town in the reign of Henry VI, and a Thomas Lyster of Wakefield was an attorney of the common pleas from the 1470s until at least 1501. A Richard Lyster was sued for dues by Clement's Inn in 1487&#150;8, but this can hardly have been the present subject and may have been the namesake who was at Gray's Inn in 1508. The future lord chief justice became a member of the Middle Temple about 1500, and is so described in 1502 when he acted as an attorney in the court of requests. He is mentioned as an arbitrator in London in 1503. He owned (and probably wrote) a manuscript account of the serjeants' feast of that year, perhaps as part of a private notebook of reports. After a year's respite on grounds of ill health, he became a bencher of the Middle Temple and gave his first reading in 1516, followed by a second reading in 1522, and served as treasurer from 1522 to 1524.<br>
<br>Lyster came to public prominence in 1521 when he was appointed solicitor-general, from which position he was promoted to attorney-general on 4 September 1525. On 12 May 1529 he was appointed chief baron of the exchequer, was sworn in by Wolsey on 3 June, and knighted. As chief baron he supported Audley and Cromwell in pressing the judges to decide <i>Lord Dacre's case</i> (1535) in favour of the crown, thereby enabling the <span class="roman">Statute of Uses</span> to be passed. After presiding over the exchequer for sixteen years he was made chief justice of the king's bench on 9 November 1545. Since he was not already a serjeant-at-law this necessitated a private coifing on the same day, only the second creation of its kind to be recorded. His speech to the new serjeants in 1547 was described by a contemporary as &#145;a godly, thowghe sumwhat prolixe and long declaration of their duties&#146;  (Dugdale, 118). By this time Lyster had moved from Yorkshire to Southampton, where he lived in a house in St Michael's parish which Leland praised as &#145;very fair&#146;.<br>
<br>Lyster married first Jane, daughter of Sir Ralph Shirley, and widow of Sir John Dawtrey, whose portrait by Holbein is in the Royal Collection, and second Elizabeth Stoke, with whom he had a son, Sir Michael Lyster (<i>d</i>. 1551), and a daughter, Elizabeth, wife of Sir Richard Blount. Lyster resigned from the office of chief justice in the first half of 1552 and died on 16 March the following year. He was buried the next day at St Michael's Church, Southampton. To his eldest grandson, Richard, he left all his lands in the south, and to his younger grandson Charles all his lands in Wakefield and elsewhere in Yorkshire. His grandson Richard was obliged to bring a slander action in 1557 to challenge an assertion that he was Sir Michael's illegitimate son by Maud Vane, whereas he claimed to be the son of Sir Michael's wife, Elizabeth. In 1567 the chief justice's widow caused a monument to be erected in St Michael's Church, with his effigy in judicial robes and collar of SS.<br>
