<span class="headword">Delaval family</span>  (<em>per. </em><em>c.</em>1520&#150;1752), <span class="occ">landowners and industrialists of Hartley and Seaton Delaval, Northumberland</span>, were descended from immigrants who arrived in England at or just after the Norman conquest and acquired land in the area of Hartley in the twelfth century. Thus by about 1219 Gilbert Delaval, lord of Callerton, owned an estate there, probably of about 100 acres of land, a coalmine, and some cottages. The township would appear to have been quite prosperous by the end of the thirteenth century, with a fishery and salt pans&#151;natural bedfellows for a coastal township with shallow coals. Coal and salt were, indeed, the spurs to the industrial development of the Hartley area, and in the sixteenth century the salt pans of <a name="cosubject_76461"></a><span class="headword">Sir John Delaval</span>  (1498&#150;1562)<span class="occ"></span> were said to produce salt which was &#145;esteemed by sutche as buye the same to be better than any other white salt&#146;  (Earnshaw, 4). Evidently the salt and coal trades were already considerable revenue earners for the family, and it was said of Sir John a few years after his death that he &#145;hath been a patron of worship and hospitality, most like a famous gentleman during many years, and powdreth no man by the salt of extortion of oppressing his neighbour, but liberally spendeth his salt, wheat and malt like a gentleman&#146;  (Hedley, 150). Knighted by 1519, he was five times high sheriff of Northumberland between 1527 and 1554, a position which many of his descendants were to occupy. He married Mary, daughter of Thomas Carey of Chilton, Wiltshire.<br>
<br>The lands in Hartley in the early sixteenth century were held by the crown and by other families besides the Delavals, but much of the township was being leased to the latter and Sir Robert Delaval (<i>c</i>.1541&#150;1607), grandson of Sir John, bought out all the freeholders between 1574 and 1577. He converted the tillage lands to pasture and effectively annexed the manor of Hartley to that of his manor of Seaton Delaval in 1578. Thereafter Hartley and Seaton Delaval remained with the Delavals until the early nineteenth century.<br>
<br>Sir Robert had married Dorothy Grey (<i>d</i>. before 1600) and was succeeded by his eldest son, <a name="cosubject_76462"></a><span class="headword">Sir Ralph Delaval</span>  (<em>c.</em>1576&#150;1628)<span class="occ"></span>, who married Jane Hilton (<i>d</i>. 1645). Little is known about his public life other than that he was high sheriff for Northumberland in 1604, 1608, and 1621, and that he was knighted in 1608. However, his youngest son, Thomas, wrote an affectionate portrait of his father as a man who:<blockquote>kept an open, great and plentiful house for entertainment, his own family consisting daily in his house of threescore persons and above &hellip; His life was religious. He kept a chaplain ever in his house that read public prayers daily in his house and preached each Sunday commonly in his chapel and taught and educated his children. He governed his people in excellent order, and stocked and managed his whole estate himself, directing his servants daily their several labours. He kept also the books of his cattle, corn, etc., and how they were disposed. He never rid to any public assembly without five or six men in liveries and two or three of his sons to attend him. He never affected drinking. Cards nor dice, he never could abide them &hellip; His apparel ever decent not rich. He was a man of voluble tongue, excellent discourse and of good memory. He understood the Latin and Greek tongues, and in his younger days did write of several subjects. He understood the laws of the land expertly. His times of private devotions were daily&#151;at morn, noon and night. He loved hunting but left it off long ere he died. He was very zealous in religion which he openly professed to the last, and, having settled his estate &hellip; taken the communion, blessed his wife and children and desiring absolution of his sins from the minister, which done, within 24 hours he made a calm and quiet period of his life. (Hedley, 152)</blockquote>The annual rental of Sir Ralph's estates amounted to &pound;1991 13<i>s</i>. 8<i>d</i>. by the 1620s, and against this the yearly outlay in family annuities, rents, and wages amounted to &pound;311 6<i>s</i>. 4<i>d</i>. At his death, on 24 November 1628, his personal estate was valued at &pound;2934 6<i>s</i>. 9<i>d</i>.<br>
<br>Sir Ralph was succeeded by his son Sir Robert Delaval (1600&#150;1623), who had married Barbara Selby (<i>d</i>. 1679), and then by their only son, <a name="cosubject_47991"></a><span class="headword">Sir Ralph Delaval</span>, first baronet  (1622&#150;1691)<span class="occ"></span>. Until this time any potential expansion of the coal and salt trades was limited by the fact that seagoing trading vessels could not use the small haven at Hartley, so that coal and salt had to be carried from Hartley to the Blyth or the Tyne for shipment. About 1670 this disadvantageous situation was rectified by Sir Ralph by the building of a pier&#151;after two unsuccessful attempts&#151;at the mouth of the burn, &#145;and so it stood&#146;, noted Sir Francis North in 1676, &#145;and was very useful to him in his trade of Salt and Coal&#146;  (Emsley, 16). The building of the pier was followed by the creation of a tidal sluicing system to clear the harbour of river-borne silt and tide-washed sand, also seen by North. Thereafter the harbour became known as Seaton Sluice, and this harbour sluicing system so impressed John Smeaton, who examined it some eighty years later, that he recommended a similar system in his famous harbour plan for Ramsgate. The &pound;7000 which Sir Ralph had spent on his harbour works persuaded Charles II to make him collector and surveyor of his own port, and it would seem that he then built a second pier, presumably on the opposite side of the mouth of the burn to the first, having been offered a &pound;1500 grant towards its construction by the king. One-third of this grant had been paid at the time of Charles's death in 1685, but the remainder was never forthcoming.<br>
<br>On 2 April 1646 Sir Ralph had married the widowed Lady Anne Fraser (<i>d</i>. 1696), daughter of General Alexander Leslie, earl of Leven, commander of the Scottish army which had stormed and taken Newcastle only two years before; one month after the marriage Leslie was holding Charles I prisoner in the town. In 1649 Sir Ralph became the first high sheriff of Northumberland appointed by the Commonwealth, and he entered Richard Cromwell's parliament as a knight of the shire for Northumberland in 1659, being re-elected after the Restoration. He was made a baronet on 29 June 1660 and, after a fifteen-year absence from the house, he was elected to the long-lasting Cavalier Parliament at a by-election in 1677, subsequently supporting the court party; he was re-elected to the three subsequent parliaments.<br>
<br>In spite of the success of the harbour at Seaton Sluice the Delaval estates around Hartley seem to have been in a parlous state by the late 1680s and Sir Ralph attempted to amend this situation by making advantageous marriage arrangements for his sons&#151;he and his wife had seven sons and three daughters. His first son, Robert (1647&#150;1682), apparently a sickly young man, was married to Lady Elizabeth Livingston (1648?&#150;1717), daughter of James, earl of Newburgh, in 1670 [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/68215/', "Delaval, Lady Elizabeth")</script>]; Lady Elizabeth was a noted beauty at the court of Charles II but the marriage was not a success and had effectively ended before Robert's death without an heir. In 1684 Sir Ralph arranged the marriage of his eldest surviving son, another Sir Ralph (1649&#150;1696), to Diana Booth (<i>d</i>. 1713), daughter of Lord Delamere. He settled the succession of the estates on this son and his heirs male, and failing any, upon the next surviving son <a name="cosubject_76463"></a><span class="headword">Sir John Delaval</span>, third baronet  (<em>bap. </em>1654, <em>d.</em> 1729)<span class="occ"></span>, subject to a payment of &pound;8000 for any daughters born to Ralph and Diana. Sir John had married Mary Goodyer (1659/60&#150;1683) in 1683, but she died after a few months of marriage; he later had a daughter, Ann (<i>c</i>.1689&#150;1723), but there is no evidence for a second marriage. He had a distinguished military career, served in many campaigns in Flanders, and rose to become colonel in the guards; he was elected MP for Morpeth, Northumberland, in 1701 and 1702.<br>
<br>His brother Sir Ralph died five years after their father, leaving only a daughter, Diana (1686&#150;1710). His personal estate went to pay his creditors, while the Seaton Delaval and Hartley estates devolved upon his widow, Diana, under the terms of their marriage settlement, and Sir John came into possession of Seaton Sluice, the coalmines, quarries, and salt pans. Diana married again in October 1699; her husband, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/61543/', "Sir Edward Blackett (1649&#150;1718)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/61542/', "Blackett, Sir William")</script>] of Newby in Yorkshire, tightened his grip on the &pound;8000 portion by marrying his stepdaughter Diana to his own eldest son, William, within two months of his own marriage. The younger Diana was only thirteen years old at the time, but there was a clear advantage to Sir Edward in having her both as stepdaughter and daughter-in-law. At the same time Blackett ensured that the &pound;8000 should be paid to him rather than to his son, and in 1709 he secured an agreement from the sole surviving trustee for the settlement, that 6 per cent interest should be charged on the &pound;8000 from 1691.<br>
<br>Meanwhile Sir John Delaval was facing familiar problems with the deterioration of a pier at the harbour, and he attempted to recoup his &pound;500 outlay on its repair by seeking to recover the remainder of Charles II's earlier offer of a grant to his father. In his unsuccessful argument Sir John noted the great benefits that had accrued from Sir Ralph's work; eight salt pans were now at work, the excise on salt alone averaging &pound;5000 per annum, and during the year 1704 some 1400 chaldrons (nearly 3700 tons) of coal had been exported. But even greater financial problems faced Sir John as he was presented with his brother-in-law's claim arising from the marriage settlement, the sum at issue having increased through interest charges to &pound;14,624 by the time of the former Lady Delaval's death in 1713. Sir John put forward his own claims to Seaton Delaval and Hartley on Diana's death, but faced with Blackett's claim, which was confirmed by a court order of 1715, and which amounted to a sum well beyond his means, it was inevitable that he should have to sell off a large portion of his property, namely the manor of Seaton.<br>
<br>The only member of the family in a position to rescue the situation was Admiral <a name="cosubject_76464"></a><span class="headword">George Delaval</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1668, <em>d.</em> 1723)<span class="occ"></span>, of a branch of the family settled at Dissington in Northumberland. The third son of George Delaval (<i>c</i>.1628&#150;1695) and Margaret Grey (<i>d</i>. 1709), the admiral became MP for West Looe in 1715 and 1722, but it was his combined naval and diplomatic careers&#151;he had been employed in embassies in Morocco and Portugal&#151;that brought him sufficient wealth to pay off various fractious and impoverished members of the family. During 1718 he bought Sir John out of Seaton and Hartley, paid off Blackett, purchased the Bavington estate in Northumberland, and commissioned Vanbrugh to design Seaton Delaval Hall as a replacement for the old Delaval Castle; Sir John was left with a life interest in Hartley and Seaton Sluice. Admiral Delaval, who never married, gained little of the fruits of his enterprise for he was thrown from his horse and promptly died of his injuries in 1723; Seaton Delaval Hall was still six years from completion, and Vanbrugh himself died three years later and was, therefore, never to see his finest work completed. Gutted by fire in the early nineteenth century, its shell survives as a dramatically angular conflation of differing elements&#151;classical, medieval, and contemporary&#151;all tightly bound together in a startling unity.<br>
<br>The admiral's will, made a few weeks before his death, devised Bavington to his sister's son George Shafto and the remainder of his estates to his brother's son, <a name="cosubject_76465"></a><span class="headword">Francis Blake Delaval</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1692, <em>d.</em> 1752)<span class="occ"></span>, the son of Edward Delaval of South Dissington (<i>bap</i>. 1664, <i>d</i>. 1744) and Mary Ord, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Blake (<i>c</i>.1664&#150;1711). Francis, a naval captain in the impress service, had inherited the Ford estate in north Northumberland from his maternal grandfather, Francis Blake, in 1718, and under the terms of that will he replaced his Delaval surname with that of Blake. On succeeding to Admiral Delaval's estates Francis also added his original surname. In 1729 he inherited Sir John Delaval's possessions, including Seaton Sluice. In 1724 Francis had married Rhoda Apreece (<i>d</i>. 1759), heir of Sir Thomas Hussey of Doddington, Lincolnshire, her maternal grandfather, and she brought the Doddington estate to the marriage as part of her dowry; Francis could now afford to finish off the building of Seaton Delaval Hall. The income from the estates was perhaps &pound;6000 per annum when Francis inherited, and it seems to have remained at about that level until he died. All of his properties were settled on his eldest son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/92759/', "Sir Francis Blake Delaval")</script>, of a family of seven sons and three daughters but the future fortunes of the Delavals were to rest upon the second son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/39337/', "John Hussey Delaval, Baron Delaval (1728&#150;1808)")</script>, industrialist and politician. The third son was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7454/', "Edward Hussey Delaval (bap. 1729, d. 1814)")</script>, natural philosopher.<br>
