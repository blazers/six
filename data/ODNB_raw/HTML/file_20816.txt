<span class="headword">Ordish,  Rowland Mason</span>  (1824&#150;1886), <span class="occ">engineer</span>, was born at Melbourne, Derbyshire, on 11 April 1824, the son of John Ordish, land agent and surveyor. Nothing is known about his education prior to his arrival in London in his twenties. After some time in an architect's office, in 1847 he went to work as an assistant in the office of the engineer R. E. Brounger. He was engaged on the design of structures and is said to have soon showed particular promise for this work. He was sent to survey the proposed route for a railway in Denmark, a country to which he returned for a short while in 1855. While involved in preparing drawings for a bridge at Windsor he obtained permission from his employer to submit a scheme of his own. This was selected by the queen and the bridge was constructed to his design. At about this time he worked on the caisson foundations of the Black Potts Bridge on the South Western Railway.<br>
<br>In the summer of 1850 Ordish was working for Fox Henderson as a draughtsman, helping with the preparation of the working drawings for the 1851 Exhibition building in Hyde Park. These were prepared by Charles Fox and Ordish in London and sent to foundries in Smethwick and Dudley. Ordish is reported to have carried out his work so efficiently that more and more important tasks were entrusted to him. In late 1850 he was sent to Birmingham to work with Charles Fox and E. A. Cowper on the details for the roof of New Street Station, Birmingham. This roof and the 1851 Exhibition building were both structures that involved innovative uses of cast and wrought iron and working on them provided useful experience. In 1853&#150;4 he was at Sydenham supervising the re-erection and extension of the Exhibition building, even though he had expressed doubts about the suitability of this use of columns and beams for glass and iron roofs. His work with Charles Fox on these schemes was the basis for a lasting friendship and working relationship that continued for many years.<br>
<br>From January 1856 to March or April 1858 Ordish was employed as a draughtsman in the works department of the Admiralty, where Colonel G. T. Greene was director and William Scamp was the civil engineer. This again was an office where innovative ideas were developed, especially during 1857 when the rigid iron frame structure for the Sheerness boat shed was being designed. In 1858 he resigned from the works department and set up in practice at 18 Great George Street, Westminster, first in partnership with a Mr Dawdney and very soon after with W. H. Le Feuvre. In April 1858 he took out a patent for improvements in the design and construction of suspension bridges, which involved a rigid road girder suspended on rigid straight chains, which became known as &#145;Ordish's rigid chain suspension system&#146;. He proposed a low-level bridge of this type across the Thames at the Tower of London in 1862 but the system was not used until 1868 when the Franz Joseph Bridge over the Moldau at Prague was constructed using a chain of steel link bars. For this scheme he received the Austrian gold medal for Arts and Sciences. Another bridge on the same principle was shortly constructed nearby, and later one in Singapore, and one in the USA.<br>
<br>In 1872 a scheme for a bridge at Chelsea was authorized in parliament with, it is said, the promoters insisting that it be designed by Ordish. The Albert Bridge was constructed to his design, but the owners substituted steel wires in place of the link chains he proposed. These were later replaced with the steel link chains he had recommended. He prepared three schemes for other bridges that were not built: in 1872 for a twin-span toll bridge and four tunnels at the Tower; in 1874 with Max am Ende, his chief assistant, for one across the Neva at St Petersburg (for which he received a prize of &pound;300); and, with Ewing Matheson of Andrew Handyside Ltd, in 1885 for a scheme on the site of the present Tower Bridge.<br>
<br>In 1866 Ordish obtained a bill for an underground railway from Charing Cross to Euston, running under Tottenham Court Road, which included a new street through Seven Dials. His skill and experience in the design and detailing of iron structures was much admired and his assistance and expertise were sought and used by many engineers in the sixties and seventies. When the domes of the 1862 Exhibition building in South Kensington were found to be unstable he was asked to prepare a scheme for a form of internal bracing. In 1863&#150;4 he assisted Charles Fox with schemes for the series of bridges south of the Thames and the bridge over it at Pimlico for the London, Chatham, and Dover Railway. Again with Fox he worked on the design for a railway bridge across the River Bremer, Queensland, Australia.<br>
<br>The roof over the train shed at St Pancras Station, commenced in 1865, clearly demonstrates his ability and skill in designing and detailing aesthetically pleasing, practical, and economic wrought-iron structures. With its clear arched span of 240 ft it attracted wide attention in both the technical and lay press and Ordish's contribution was publicly acknowledged by W. H. Barlow at a meeting of the Institution of Civil Engineers in 1870.<br>
<br>Ordish collaborated with Owen Jones on an 80 ft by 40 ft kiosk in India made of cast iron. To stabilize the bases of the columns he used a beam extending into the building below floor level. A similar device was used in 1876 for the bases of the arched roof of St Enoch's Station, Glasgow. This roof was of much the same form as St Pancras and the roof of Cape Town Station, on which Ordish worked. In 1868 he designed, for G. G. Scott, a rectangular dome of iron ribs and glass for the Leeds Infirmary winter gardens. For the next ten years Scott consulted Ordish about the structural ironwork on his schemes and, at Westminster Abbey, Ordish designed for him a polygonal iron framework in the roof space of the chapter house to support the stone vault.<br>
<br>In 1863, with his partner Le Feuvre, Ordish designed and constructed the Dutch-Rhenish railway station at Amsterdam. This was constructed with many cast-iron components, a material that Ordish, unlike many of his contemporaries, considered to be suitable for a variety of structures. His connection with iron founders like Fox Henderson, Handyside, and Heywoods (for whom he designed a cast-iron fronted house) provided him with opportunities to exploit the material. One of his cast-iron bridges is that over Farringdon Street, on the Holborn Viaduct, designed in 1863.<br>
<br>Between 1860 and 1875 Ordish worked on the details of numerous structures, including the Amsterdam Crystal Palace, the Dublin Exhibition building (later re-erected as the Albert Palace at Battersea), the Holloway College at Egham, and another all cast-iron building, the Watson's Hotel at Bombay. In 1869, in conjunction with J. W. Grover, a former Fox Henderson employee, and W. Fairbairn, he designed and detailed the oval, shallow domed roof at the Albert Hall, South Kensington. In 1876, with Perry F. Nursey, he published a scheme for a double cast-iron tube tunnel to be laid on the bed of the channel between Dover and Calais. In addition to the patent he took out for suspension bridges in 1858 he obtained other patents for various devices. One, an elastic chair and rail fixing taken out in 1859, was used on the Stratford upon Avon Railway but was not widely adopted.<br>
<br>Ordish became a member of the Society of Engineers in 1857 (when it was still the Putney Club) and its president in 1860. In September 1857 he gave a paper on suspension bridges and another in May 1858 on the forms and strength of beams, girders, and trusses. He was a member of the Society of Arts, but although asked to join other professional organizations never did. He was a talented designer of structural details with a facility for making rapid mental estimates of the cost of structural ironwork. At the time of his death contemporaries commented that he did not appear to take advantage of the numerous opportunities for advancement that had presented themselves, and that he had little interest in society, which he shunned rather than courted. His death was regretted by the large number of pupils who had been trained in his office and who were in posts all over the world.<br>
<br>In 1881 Ordish became engineer to Dennet and Ingle of Whitehall, and he was inspecting work in progress on their behalf the day before he died. He had suffered from oedema and heart disease for some time and died in his sleep at his home, 19 Stratford Place, Kentish Town, on 12 September 1886. He was buried in the Old Ground, Highgate cemetery, on 17 September 1886.<br>
