</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Keay, Sir  Lancelot Herman</span>  (1883&#150;1974), <span class="occ">architect</span>, was born on 3 August 1883 at 1 Clarence Villa, Enys Road, Eastbourne, the second son of Henry William Keay (1849&#150;1938), bookseller and seven times mayor of Eastbourne, and his wife, Annie Maria Merrick, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Head (1848&#150;1944). He was educated at Eastbourne College and Brighton College of Art and Technology. Between 1906 and 1915 he served as chief architectural assistant to the city of Norwich and was responsible for the restoration of the guildhall and of the Blackfriars and St Andrew's halls, as well as extensions to the city's asylum and isolation hospital. In addition he carried out small housing schemes. A keen theatregoer, he was also an early member of Nugent Monck's Guild of Norwich Players, formed in 1911.<br>
<br>On the outbreak of the First World War Keay volunteered as a dispatch rider. Shortly afterwards he was commissioned as a lieutenant in the 209th field company, Royal Engineers, attached to the 34th division, and was seriously wounded during the battle of the Somme (1916). After leaving France he was posted to Egypt and appointed commanding royal engineer for the Suez town of Kantara. In addition to his routine Royal Engineer services he was responsible for the operation of road and rail bridges across the Suez Canal, and for the supply of drinking water to the occupied area of Palestine. After the amalgamation of the Royal Engineers commands of Kantara and Isma&#145;illiyyah, he was lent for duty with the frontier district administration to prepare a report on transport routes for the western desert, and also visited Suva, Fiji. In 1920 he married Iris Stone (1896&#150;1983), the elder daughter of E. G. Stone of Clifton, St Peter Port, Guernsey, with whom he had two daughters.<br>
<br>After his return to England in 1921 Keay was appointed chief architectural assistant to Birmingham corporation, for which he developed more than 16,000 houses under the auspices of post-war housing legislation. In 1925 he was chosen as chief architectural assistant within the city engineer's department of Liverpool corporation on the recommendation of Sir Thomas White, then chairman of the housing committee. On the retirement of the city engineer, John Alexander Brodie, in 1926, Keay became acting director and then director of housing (1929) at the head of the corporation's separately constituted housing department. In the same year he was elected a fellow of the Royal Institute of British Architects.<br>
<br>Keay's time in Liverpool produced his most influential work, from which he gained a reputation for the breadth and quality of his municipal housing. His appointment reflected a corporation alert to the potential of multi-storey inner-city housing and Keay was regarded as the person to realize these aspirations. During the late 1920s and 1930s he participated in national and international debates on slum clearance and rehousing, and became a prominent critic of the legislative conditions that impeded comprehensive redevelopment of unfit housing. Keay's profile was far higher than his non-metropolitan position might suggest, a reflection of the scale of Liverpool's housing challenge and the efficacy of his response. In frequent public appearances at the RIBA and elsewhere, most notably in the film <span class="italic">Homes for Workers</span> (1938, produced by the Liverpool Gas Company), Keay set out the necessity and multiple benefits of modern housing for ordinary Liverpudlians. In 1935 he became a member of the Ministry of Health's new housing advisory committee, on which he sat until 1957, and which contributed to the formulation of the <span class="roman">Housing Act</span> of 1935, which sought to secure the powers of comprehensive redevelopment. Though subsequently limited in scope by war and by the difficulties of compulsory purchase, the act paved the way for more comprehensive planning legislation after the war. In addition he advised the Ministry of Works and was a member of the National Housing and Town Planning Council.<br>
<br>Pragmatic and enthusiastic for the possibilities of new housing, Keay viewed multi-storey forms as an inevitable and welcome solution to the problem of Liverpool's central slums. He maintained that the large number of tenants displaced by clearances should be rehoused as near as possible to the docksides where the majority worked, and that this required the optimal reuse of expensive inner-city plots. In addition Keay argued for the preservation of the countryside from unnecessary sprawl and the creation of a fine civic landscape modelled on the modern expressionist designs then popular in continental Europe. The most characteristic of Keay's estates, the five-storey St Andrew's Gardens (1931&#150;5), designed by his assistant John Hughes, was modelled on Bruno Taut's Hufeisensiedlung (&#145;horseshoe&#146;) estate in Berlin. Keay had visited and admired the Berlin estate in July 1931, and St Andrew's Gardens, with its 316 flats marked out by their horizontal fenestration and &#145;sun balconies&#146; (a first in British public housing), was promoted as a symbol of a new and sanitary form of city lifestyle. That such schemes were being planned before Arthur Greenwood's housing act of 1930 made slum clearance and new properties mandatory is evidence of the persuasive force of Keay's interest in multi-storey housing solutions.<br>
<br>In contrast to the European modernism favoured for the inner city, Keay addressed the need for housing on Liverpool's fringes with the construction of large suburban estates. Here he applied <i>beaux-arts</i> ideas of axial planning and widespread use of neo-Georgian styling akin to that he had initially favoured before his introduction to continental modernism. The focus for these suburban estates was Brodie's Queen's Drive (begun in 1904), a broad orbital road around the inner city. Formalistic planning devices, including open-sided garden squares, and such detailing as parapeted roofs, urns, and palace-fronted terraces gave developments like Norris Green an urbane yet domestic sensibility.<br>
<br>These trends reached their height in Keay's plan for the Speke estate, which was developed from 1928 on an 1800 acre site acquired from Speke Hall, 8 miles south of the city centre. The plan was for a self-contained satellite township, rather than a traditional suburban extension, and in 1936 Keay designed a residential area that was intended to house 20,000 people. Early progress was slow and by 1938 just 500 houses had been built, with a further 900 in place by the end of the war. Building then accelerated and more than 4000 properties were added in the following decade. By now, however, it was clear that Keay's original vision for a &#145;self-contained community unit&#146;  (Pevsner, 254), characterized by mixed social tenure and a self-sufficient infrastructure of economic and community services, would not be realized.<br>
<br>From 1938 Keay extended his remit from housing to that of Liverpool's city architect, a post he held until 1948. Notwithstanding the eventual failure of the Speke new town project, Keay oversaw the construction of more than 35,000 new flats and houses in the city's centre and suburbs. This impressive body of work was recognized throughout his career, culminating in the presidency of the RIBA (1946&#150;8, the first incumbent from a public-sector background) and his appointment as KBE in 1947. Between 1947 and 1957 he was a member of the advisory council on building and civil engineering research and development, and was appointed chairman of both the Basildon and Bracknell new town development corporations in 1948. The final part of his career, during the 1950s and 1960s, saw work on municipal and social housing schemes across London under the auspices of his private practice, Sir Lancelot Keay, Basil Duckett and Partners. Keay died of a heart attack on 2 November 1974 at his home, 22 Hyde Park Gardens, Paddington, London. In the following decade redevelopment of Liverpool city centre saw the demolition of many of his multi-storey blocks, of which St Andrew's Gardens and Myrtle Gardens (now Minster Court) remain as two of the few extant examples.<br>
