<span class="headword">Conder,  Charles Edward</span>  (1868&#150;1909), <span class="occ">artist</span>, was born at Holly Cottage, Finsbury Road, Tottenham, London, on 24 October 1868, the son of James Conder, coal and lime merchant, and his wife, Mary Ann, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Ayres. In 1870 James Conder took his family to India, where he had a post as railway engineer. Mary Ann died there in 1873, and Charles, aged five, was returned to England for private schooling. At fifteen he was sent to Sydney, New South Wales, where he entered the lands department of the colonial civil service with a view to the profession of a trigonometrical land surveyor. He disliked the work and soon abandoned it.<br>
<br>Conder's predilection was for art, and from an early age he drew and painted from nature. He obtained what art education he could by drawing from life at evening classes in Sydney, by study at the National Gallery of Victoria in Melbourne, and by painting in the country with other Australian artists. During August 1889, with Arthur Streeton and Tom Roberts, he contributed to a small exhibition in Melbourne, &#145;Sketches and impressions&#146;. In 1890, at the Society of Victorian Artists, he showed several paintings, most of which were realistic; but among them was an imaginative work, <span class="italic">The Hot Wind</span>, which attracted notice: a nude female figure in the foreground of a sun-baked landscape, vigorously blowing into flame the ashes of a fire. Another of those pictures, <span class="italic">Departure of the SS &#145;Orient&#146;</span>, was purchased for the National Gallery of New South Wales in Sydney. An uncle thereupon provided the means for studying painting, and in 1890 Conder returned to England, though Paris was his destination.<br>
<br>In Paris, Conder worked intermittently in the studio of Fernand Cormon and at the Acad&eacute;mie Julian, but, always impatient of school routine, followed his own lines and studied the work of artists around him. Louis Anquetin especially influenced him and, to some extent, Honor&eacute; Daumier and Toulouse-Lautrec. In March 1891 he and William Rothenstein exhibited together at the gallery of the Paris dealer Thomas, at 43 boulevard Malesherbes; their work was reproduced in <span class="italic">L'Art fran&ccedil;ais</span>. In March 1896, at the Paris gallery of Siegfried Bing, noted for the influence of his Japanese collections, Conder exhibited panels on silk for the boudoir and a few designs for fans, which inaugurated his most original contributions to art. His first fan design was in oils on a wooden panel, executed about 1895. Elected an associate member of the Soci&eacute;t&eacute; Nationale des Beaux Arts in 1893, he quickly won a reputation for the originality and charm of the work which he exhibited at the society's salon.<br>
<br>In 1899 Conder settled in England. He joined the New English Art Club and contributed to the <span class="italic">Yellow Book</span>. From September 1897 he was one of those who exhibited regularly at the Carfax Gallery in Ryder Street, St James's, London. For the first time his art brought a fairly regular income. In Paris in December 1901 he married a Canadian, Stella Maris (1863/4&#150;1912), daughter of Alexander Macadams, and the widow of George Noel Bedford. The Conders settled at 91 Cheyne Walk, Chelsea, thereafter their permanent home. Stella created a stable domestic life, but the excesses of Conder's earlier years had undermined his health.<br>
<br>Conder preferred working chiefly from his exceptionally retentive memory. His paintings seemed to develop without method or scheme, but once an idea gripped him he could not rest until he had carried it through. A number have not survived because he was careless about materials, brushes, and colours. Of a few lithographs, made at Rothenstein's urging, the best are eight dated 1899, six of which are scenes from Balzac and two are fanciful subjects. A single etching by Conder is known, a dry-point, of which Rothenstein owned a print. Conder painted much in oils, his subjects being chiefly landscapes often romantically and imaginatively treated, seashore scenes, modern watering-places with gaily dressed crowds, and an occasional portrait in a decorative style. But his most characteristic works are the dainty watercolour drawings which date between 1895 and 1905, painted after a fashion of his own on panels of white silk, many shaped for fans. The delicate tones of their colour agree perfectly with the frail texture of the material. The subjects are dreamlike fancies which, while far removed from reality, reflect modern life. The colour and general character of his landscape backgrounds were derived entirely from the scenery at Chartamelle on the River Seine, but the scenery of Normandy also influenced his designs. His art has been compared with that of Antoine Watteau, but it is never constructive like that of the French master and is usually more elusive in subject.<br>
<br>Conder exerted a strong influence on contemporary art. His draughtsmanship was sometimes faulty, but he is appreciated for the Arcadian delicacy of his work and as one of the carriers of French influence to England in the late years of the nineteenth century. Conder died on 9 February 1909 at the Holloway Sanatorium, St Ann's Heath, Virginia Water, Surrey, and was buried in the cemetery in Virginia Water. His widow died on 18 April 1912.<br>
