<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Pitt,  Thomas</span>, second Baron Camelford  (1775&#150;1804), <span class="occ">naval officer and rake</span>, was born on 19 February 1775 at Boconnoc House, Cornwall, the younger of two children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22335/', "Thomas Pitt, first Baron Camelford (1737&#150;1793)")</script>, landowner and politician, and Anne (1738&#150;1803), daughter of Pinckney Wilkinson, London merchant and MP. Pitt passed his childhood predominantly at Boconnoc, where he was educated by tutors. His parents took him in 1786 to a school kept by Mr Meuron in Neuch&acirc;tel in Switzerland and then sent him in July 1789 to Charterhouse School in London, a place he hated so much that he left after only nine days, never to return. During the course of this erratic education he was enrolled on 25 September 1781 as a captain's servant on board HMS <i>Tobago</i>, but he did not actually see naval service until 9 September 1789, when he boarded the <i>Guardian</i>, a partly armed sloop destined for New South Wales. After striking a field of ice near the Cape of Good Hope the ship was deserted by a great part of the crew, but together with the commander Pitt succeeded in bringing the wreck into Table Bay in February 1790.<br>
<br>Praised for his actions, Pitt joined the <i>Discovery</i> on 12 March 1791, under the command of Captain George Vancouver. During the voyage around the Pacific coast of North America he was flogged several times and placed in irons for acts of insubordination, losing his rank of master's mate and finally being discharged by Vancouver while in Hawaii. Placed on a supply ship headed for England on 7 February 1794, Pitt was enraged by what he considered unjust treatment. During the voyage he learnt of his father's death on 19 January 1793, which made him the second Baron Camelford and a young nobleman of some considerable wealth. After leaving the supply ship and making his way to Malacca in the Dutch East Indies he boarded the <i>Resistance</i>, where he was soon promoted to acting lieutenant. Such was his friendship with the captain that when he left the frigate in November 1795 he did so as third lieutenant, having served with courage and distinction in the seizure of Malacca from the Dutch. He returned to England in September 1796 when the long-held dispute with Vancouver came to a head in a notorious manner.<br>
<br>Incensed still by the injustices served against him, Camelford invited Vancouver twice to duel, but Vancouver preferred to submit the matter for naval adjudication. On 21 September 1796 Vancouver was walking up Conduit Street in London when Camelford, on seeing him, dashed across the road and proceeded to rain blows upon him with his cane. The violent episode caused much gossip in the newspapers and prompted a caricature from the satirical pen of James Gillray. The lord chancellor intervened and Camelford agreed to keep the peace in the future or forfeit the sum of &pound;10,000.<br>
<br>In April 1797 Camelford was promoted to the rank of lieutenant. Later that year Rear-Admiral Harvey, commander-in-chief of the fleet in the Leeward Islands, appointed him as acting commander of the <i>Favourite</i> owing to the sickness of the captain. Charles Peterson, the first lieutenant of the ship and senior to Camelford, was indignant at his supersession and managed to transfer to the <i>Perdrix</i>, another sloop in the English harbour in Antigua. This was soon followed by the departure both of the captain of the <i>Perdrix</i> and then of the ship <i>Babet</i>, whose captain, Jemmett Mainwaring, had been the senior officer in port. A question now arose as to who was officially in charge. Mainwaring had assumed Camelford was senior, being acting commander, and so deposited the port orders with him. Peterson, however, believed he was, on account of being senior on the lieutenants list and acting representative for his captain on leave. A threat of action resulted in Camelford's issuing orders to Peterson to prepare his men for possible attack. This Peterson refused, and by return ordered the young peer to do likewise. Camelford, annoyed at being undermined, sent an acting lieutenant, Milward, and a party of marines to arrest Peterson. Met with resistance, Milward withdrew to the quayside and was soon joined by both Camelford and the gathering armed marines from both ships. Camelford, armed with a pistol, walked towards the men of the <i>Perdrix</i>, twice demanding to know the whereabouts of Peterson and whether he still refused to obey his orders. Peterson replied that he did and Camelford fired, killing the lieutenant instantly.<br>
<br>On 20 January 1798, Camelford was tried before a court martial at Martinique. After five days the court concluded that he be &#145;unanimously and honourably acquitted&#146;  (TNA: PRO, Adm 1/5343), it being understood that he had been the senior officer and that Peterson, by his actions, was the mutineer. Despite his acquittal, he suffered much public vilification and consequently left the West Indies as commander of the <i>Terror</i>, reaching England by July 1798.<br>
<br>Later in 1798 Camelford resolved to travel to France, incognito. On the coach to Dover he met Captain Maistral, a French prisoner of war returning home under the terms of an exchange agreement. Maistrel gave to Camelford a letter of introduction to Citizen Barras, one of the directors of the republic, describing his willingness to serve France. The boatmen became suspicious of Camelford and handed him over to the collector of customs, who searched him, found the letter, and sent him as a prisoner to London. After a special session of the privy council, he was pardoned and freed, despite it being a capital offence by law for anyone to attempt to travel to France. It was agreed that he was not guilty of any treasonable activity, but his motives remained unclear. The newspapers thought him &#145;deranged&#146;  (<span class="italic">London Chronicle</span>) and the Admiralty refused him the command of a ship thereafter. Angrily, he resigned his commission, thereby ending his naval career.<br>
<br>In autumn 1799 Camelford took lodgings at 64 Baker Street and while settling into civilian life seems to have formed an affection for his cousin Lady Hester Stanhope. He was &#145;just under six feet two inches in height, with curly brown hair, bold blue eyes, and a lithe muscular figure&#146;  (Tolstoy, 90), yet Lady Hester also admired his &#145;reckless disregard for the opinions of others, his love of adventure, and his contempt for humbug and hypocrisy&#146;  (ibid., 93). Apart from their strong mutual admiration no evidence can confirm any deeper relationship. Camelford was concerned with his overall appearance and his dress became extremely fashionable and innovative, as is evident from contemporary illustrations. Lady Hester's accounts of his life also suggest that he possessed a compassionate and generous side which as a close confidante she was privy to. He regularly gave money to the poor and was keen to correct an injustice served against those less fortunate than himself.<br>
<br>Camelford was never far from the public eye and continued to attract notoriety. He was fined in court for having quarrelled with and assaulted a man at the theatre in May 1799. In February 1800 his friend and lodger at Baker Street, Peter Abbott, annoyed the peer with an utterance at dinner, whereon Camelford tried to force a duel; a struggle and assault ensued. Abbott eventually withdrew the intended legal proceedings. In October 1801, at the time of the celebrations of peace with France, all houses were illuminated in the West End. Camelford however gave orders that his house be left in darkness. The celebratory mob attacked the house, prompting him to rush out and bludgeon his assailants, an action that resulted in personal injury and more newspaper column space. He was not obviously politically active, but his erratic loyalties gave considerable concern to his family. He twice voted against Pitt's government on the issue of peace negotiations with France. He later wrote to his brother-in-law, Lord Grenville, explaining it was a complete misunderstanding on his part. A year later his antics became just as bizarre when he befriended the old whig and libertarian Revd John Horne Tooke and backed him as MP for the rotten borough of Old Sarum. Duly elected, Horne Tooke entered Westminster in February 1801. Efforts were made by Lord Temple to oust this radical and friend of France on the grounds that as a clergyman he should not be allowed to sit in parliament. This motion failed in the Commons, but a few years later Addington, the new prime minister, introduced a law excluding clergymen from holding parliamentary seats. The whole matter greatly angered Camelford, who sold Old Sarum soon afterwards for nearly &pound;40,000. Gillray and other caricaturists continually depicted Camelford in the company of opposition politicians such as Richard Brinsley Sheridan and Charles James Fox and their great supporter the prince of Wales.<br>
<br>Camelford's eccentric political activities are further illustrated by a trip to France in the winter of 1801. Disguised and armed with a specially designed repeating pistol, he dodged both the English and French coastal authorities and reached Paris. His intentions are not known for sure but it has been suggested that he planned to assassinate Napoleon Bonaparte, for he was friendly with many French royalists and knowledgeable of their plots to rid their homeland of the first consul. The French authorities eventually caught him, and sent him back to England only after he had convinced them of his innocence and his support of republican France by citing his collaboration with the radicals in Westminster. Remarkably, he attempted another foray to France only a year later. This time the authorities, taking no chances, almost immediately incarcerated him in the Temple, the state prison in Paris, and returned him home after the intervention of the British ambassador. Deeply distressed by the death of his mother on 5 May 1803, he let Camelford House, in Oxford Street, London, and continued to live at 148 New Bond Street with Robert Barrie, an old navy colleague who seems to have been his closest lifelong friend. His life at this time alternated between serious scientific and literary studies and a riotous social life, typified by his enthusiastic promotion of pugilism.<br>
<br>In March 1804 Camelford was involved in a duel with his old friend and fine shot Thomas Best. A woman known to both men claimed that she and Camelford had been insulted by Best; Camelford demanded satisfaction, even though he may have known the allegation was false. On 7 March 1804 Camelford met Best in the early hours of the morning in the meadows surrounding Holland House, Kensington. Camelford fired first but missed; Best's shot hit Camelford, who fell mortally wounded. He died in Kensington on 10 March 1804, aged twenty-nine. His body was placed in the north vault of St Anne's Church in Dean Street, Soho, London, after an early morning funeral service on 17 March. In his will he stated that he wished to be buried on the island of St Pierre in the Lake of Bienne in Switzerland &#145;where the surrounding scenery will smile upon me&#146;, an unusual request that Lord Nelson alluded to in a letter from <i>Victory</i> on 14 May 1804. His wish was never fulfilled and his coffin lies in the old crypt beneath the tidied remains of the bombed Soho church.<br>
