<span class="headword">Jones,  Lewis</span>  (1837&#150;1904), <span class="occ">settler in Patagonia and writer</span>, was born in Pool Lane, Caernarfon, on 30 January 1837, the first of six children (only three of whom survived) of Stephen Jones, tanner, and his wife, Margaret, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Morgan. As a youth he was employed as an apprentice printer on the <span class="italic">Carnarvon and Denbigh Herald</span>. His interest in literature and his talent for languages and reciting led him to be the driving force of the Literary Society of Caernarfon, which met in the cellar of the Engedi Chapel. At the end of 1856 the society discussed emigration to Patagonia, an idea that had originated earlier that year at meetings of the Welsh Colonial Society (Cymdeithas Drefedigol Gymreig) in Camptonville, California. Many Welsh residents of the United States were disappointed that the first generation born on American soil often turned their backs on the Welsh language and traditions, as a consequence of being scattered across the country among other ethnic groups. They saw a need to channel Welsh migration to a place where they would be free from external influences, and Patagonia&#151;a remote, inhospitable, and barely populated region&#151;became one of the favoured destinations.<br>
<br>In 1857 Jones bought a printing press with his colleague on the <span class="italic">Herald</span>, the printer and Calvinistic Methodist minister Evan Jones (1836&#150;1915), and moved to Holyhead, Anglesey, where in partnership they started publishing <span class="italic">Y Punch Cymraeg</span>, a Welsh-language version of the popular magazine <span class="italic">Punch</span>. In Holyhead he met Ellen Griffiths (1840&#150;1930), daughter of Owen and Mary Griffiths, whom he married shortly afterwards on 29 August 1859 in St Cybi's Church, Holyhead. They had three children: Llewelyn, who died at an early age; Myfanwy Rufudd, who married Llwyd ap Iwan, son of the Reverend Michael D. Jones; and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/61281/', "Eluned Morgan (1870&#150;1938)")</script>, who would become one of the greatest literary talents of Welsh Patagonia.<br>
<br>By 1861 the young couple had moved to Liverpool, where Lewis Jones started his own printing business and resumed contact with Hugh Hughes Cadfan Gwynedd (1824&#150;1888), a former member of the Literary Society of Caernarfon. Jones's interest in the emigration venture was rekindled and a &#145;colonizing society&#146; was founded to channel enthusiasm for the project. In order to rally support for the movement Jones published in 1862 Hughes's <span class="italic">Llawlyfr y wladychfa Gymreig</span> (&#145;Handbook of the Welsh colony&#146;) as well as the newspaper <span class="italic">Y Ddraig Goch</span>. Contacts were made with S. R. Phibbs, the Argentinian vice-consul in Liverpool, and at the end of 1862 Jones sailed to Buenos Aires, where he was joined at the beginning of 1863 by Captain Love Jones-Parry (1832&#150;1891) in order to discuss with the Argentinian government the possibility of establishing a Welsh settlement in Patagonia. After a short visit to the Rio Negro and Chubut valleys both wrote reports about the adequacy of the land for settlement. During this first visit to Argentina, Lewis Jones's first child died in Wales, and his printing office was closed down. Upon learning the news he became depressed and wrote in his diary that he could not wait to leave the country. He nevertheless returned in March 1865 with his wife and Edwin Cynryg Roberts, a fellow member of the Colonizing Society, in order to make the necessary arrangements before the arrival of the first pioneers, who set sail from Liverpool in May, arriving in Patagonia on 28 July 1865.<br>
<br>Lewis Jones's contributions to the establishment of <i>y Wladfa</i> (&#145;the colony&#146;), the Welsh settlement in the Chubut province of Patagonia, were vital for its development and survival through difficult periods, especially during the early years. By November 1865 some of the colonists were discontented at the unfavourable location of the settlement, and blamed Jones, who was advised to leave. He moved to Buenos Aires, where he found a job in the offices of the <span class="italic">Buenos Aires Standard</span>, a newspaper founded in 1861 by the Irish brothers Edward and Michael Mulhall to cater for the English-speaking community in Argentina. Despite being away from the Chubut settlement Jones never lost interest in its fate, and when the majority of the colonists expressed a wish to be moved to another province in the republic in 1867 Jones secured material help from the Argentinian government and persuaded Abraham Matthews&#151;leader of the party in favour of leaving&#151;and the rest of the settlers to give the colony a further opportunity to succeed. Jones then moved back to Chubut and worked tirelessly to make the Patagonian venture a success through his skills as a spokesperson, his contacts with the wealthy and powerful British community in Buenos Aires, and his role as an agent liaising between Buenos Aires and the Chubut settlement, which led him to travel forty times to the capital city between 1865 and 1885.<br>
<br>From the early days of the settlement Jones was actively involved in its political life as a member of several governing bodies and institutions. He was the first elected president of the council of the twelve, a self-governing body created by the first settlers. In 1879 he was also appointed administrator of the colony for six months and in 1885 he was elected justice of the peace under the new <span class="roman">Law of the Territories</span>, which granted the colony the right to elect its own authorities. Tensions, however, arose between the local Welsh settlers, who had been left to govern themselves for almost ten years, and the officials appointed by the government in Buenos Aires to bring the Chubut settlement under effective administrative control of the central state. In 1882 Lewis Jones and Richard Jones Berwyn were taken to gaol in Buenos Aires by the administrator, Juan Finoquetto, after Jones refused to hand in some statistics about the colony on the grounds that such information had to be requested of the local council (a Welsh-elected body). In prison they shared a cell and an amiable conversation with Manuel Quintana, who had been imprisoned for his political activities and who would later become president of Argentina. On the following morning the Welshmen were released after the bail was paid by Michael Duggan, a member of the British merchant community in Buenos Aires.<br>
<br>Between 1868 and 1882 Lewis Jones took part in at least twelve expeditions to explore the territories of Chubut and Santa Cruz, looking for other places to establish new settlements or find new communication routes with the rest of the country. In 1884 he played a key role with Thomas Davies and the engineer E. J. Williams Mostyn in obtaining permission and funding to build a railway linking the New Bay and the Chubut settlement, a plan that had been conceived during the exploratory trip of 1863. The town that developed at the southern end of the railway line was named Trelew (Lewis town) in recognition of Jones's role in the settlement. He also made contributions to the settlement in the field of publishing. He brought a printing press to the Chubut settlement to publish <span class="italic">Ein Breiniad</span> (1878&#150;83), the first printed newspaper in Patagonia. In 1891 he started editing and publishing <span class="italic">Y Dravod</span>, the oldest surviving newspaper in Patagonia. In 1898 he published in Wales <span class="italic">Cymru newydd</span>, his personal account of the Patagonian venture.<br>
<br>In 1899 tragedy struck <i>y wladfa</i> as the Chubut River burst its banks and ravaged in a matter of hours what the pioneers had achieved in thirty-four years of constant toil. Lewis Jones was broken-hearted and retired from public life thereafter. He died in his home in Plas Hedd, Chubut Valley, on 24 November 1904. His remains rest among those of other prominent figures in the history of the Welsh settlement of Patagonia in the cemetery of Moriah Chapel, Trelew. Special permission was granted for the remains of Lewis Jones's wife to be buried alongside him on her death in 1930, since the cemetery was no longer in use.<br>
