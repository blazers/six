<span class="headword">Logan,  George</span>  (1678&#150;1755), <span class="occ">Church of Scotland minister and religious controversialist</span>, was probably born in Glasgow, the son of George (or James) Logan, a merchant and burgess in the city, and his wife, Elizabeth, daughter of John Cunningham, minister of Old Cumnock. The family is thought to have originated in Ayrshire. Logan entered the Greek class at Glasgow University in 1693, and received the MA in 1696. Preparing for the ministry, he went on to study divinity and is listed as a student of that subject at Glasgow on 18 January 1697.<br>
<br>Logan was licensed to preach by the presbytery of Glasgow on 4 March 1703, and then became chaplain to John, earl of Lauderdale. On 6 February 1707 he was called to the parish of Lauder in Berwickshire, and was ordained on 8 May 1707. He married his first wife, Anne Home (<i>d</i>. before 1744), on 5 April 1711; the marriage produced a son and a daughter. On 16 October 1718 he was presented by the duke of Roxburghe to the parish of Sprouston in Roxburghshire, where he was admitted on 22 January 1719. He was transferred to the parish of Dunbar in Haddingtonshire on 24 January 1722, having again been presented by the duke of Roxburghe. While there he published his first work, the <span class="italic">Essay upon Gospel and Legal Preaching</span>, in 1723.<br>
<br>On 31 August 1732 Logan was called to Trinity parish in Edinburgh, and was admitted on 14 December. On 8 May 1740 he was elected moderator of the general assembly which deposed Ebenezer Erskine and other dissident ministers who had vehemently opposed the use of patronage in selecting parish ministers, thus officially confirming the first major secession of the eighteenth-century Church of Scotland. The hotly debated patronage issue provoked Logan's first controversial publications. In 1732 he published <span class="italic">A Modest and Humble Inquiry</span>, followed by <span class="italic">Continuation</span> in the following year. In 1733 he again wrote on church matters in <span class="italic">An Overture for a Right Constitution of the General Assembly</span> (1736). In the following year he supported the government's interpretation of events surrounding the Porteous riots in Edinburgh in <span class="italic">The lawfulness and necessity of ministers their reading the act of parliament for bringing to justice the murderers of Captain John Porteous</span>.<br>
<br>Some time after 1 January 1744 Logan married his second wife, Lilias Weir. As a confirmed whig and presbyterian Logan was naturally opposed to Jacobitism and strongly urged that Edinburgh be placed in a state of defence during the rising of 1745. When this was not done, and Edinburgh was occupied by Jacobite forces, Logan left the city, and his home on Castlehill was used by the Jacobite army as a guardhouse. After they left Logan inserted a satirical advertisement in the newspapers for the recovery of possessions which had been stolen by the recent occupants of his house.<br>
<br>Logan is best known for his contributions to the controversy between whigs and Jacobites over whether Scotland's monarchy was indefeasibly hereditary. Logan presented the whig presbyterian case for a limited monarchy that was not strictly hereditary, against the views of Thomas Ruddiman and other Jacobites. Already in 1717 Logan and other whigs, including the patriotic historian James Anderson, had formed a group of &#145;associated critics&#146; to engage in whig / Jacobite controversy. Their object was to defend the reputation of the sixteenth-century Scottish historian George Buchanan, whose political and historical views were the cornerstone of Scottish whig&#150;presbyterian ideology, and who had been attacked by Ruddiman in his edition of Buchanan's complete works. Their intention was to produce their own edition of Buchanan, refuting the slanders of Ruddiman. Although eighty pages of notes on Ruddiman's strictures were compiled the project was never completed. None the less, Logan spent the 1740s in lively literary combat with Ruddiman. In 1746 he argued in <span class="italic">A Treatise on Government</span> that the Scottish monarchy was not rigidly hereditary. Ruddiman's counter-arguments were answered by <span class="italic">A Second Treatise</span> (1747) and <span class="italic">The Finishing Stroke, or, Mr Ruddiman Self-Condemned</span> (1748). The battle continued in 1749 with Logan's <span class="italic">Second Letter &hellip; to Mr Thomas Ruddiman</span> and <span class="italic">The doctrine of the jure-divino-ship of hereditary indefeasible monarchy enquired into and exploded, in a letter to Mr Thomas Ruddiman</span>. The historical issues dealt with in these works were all central to the controversy, including the relative hereditary claims of Bruce and Balliol to the Scottish crown, and the legitimacy of Robert III and the contemporary Stuart pretender. Logan also defended the seventeenth-century presbyterian idol, Alexander Henderson, against slanders by the episcopalian Ruddiman, in a work published in 1749. He died in Edinburgh on 13 October 1755. His wife appears to have outlived him, but died before 17 December 1770.<br>
