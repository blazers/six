<span class="headword">Lloyd,  Edward</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1703&#150;1736), <span class="occ">printer and bookseller</span>, is earliest referred to in 1703, when he moved from London and settled at the Oxmantown Coffee House, Church Street, Dublin; details of his parentage and upbringing are unknown. Soon afterwards he and his business partner, Richard Pue, published their first newspaper, <span class="italic">Impartial Occurrences</span>, with issue 1 dated 25 December 1703. The title was published regularly, priced at 8<i>s</i>. including postage, and was regarded as &#145;excellent value&#146;. Lloyd was described as the author in the paper for 6 January 1705, but by February 1712 the title had changed to <span class="italic">Pue's Occurrences</span>, marking the transition to Richard Pue's sole ownership.<br>
<br>In May 1705 Lloyd opened a second coffee house, the Golden Ball at Cole's Alley, off Castle Street. Through his friendship with Jonathan Swift he was able to sell at both his premises Swift's controversial satire on abuses in religion and learning, <span class="italic">A Tale of a Tub</span> (4th edn, 1704). Gaining in confidence as a publisher, Lloyd in the same year offered readers a series of &#145;ingenious and entertaining pamphlets upon everything of moment&#146;, which gave rise to his <span class="italic">Dublin Courant, or, Diverting Post</span>. Alongside this venture Lloyd began a range of trading initiatives, including the import of &#145;one hundred curious statues, cut in allabaster, many of which are fit for placing in gardens&#146;  (<span class="italic">Impartial Occurrences</span>, quoted in Pollard, 367&#150;8).<br>
<br>By 1707 Lloyd had established his own publishing company, the New Post Office Printing House, in Essex Street at the corner of Sycamore Alley. However, on 29 July the Irish House of Lords ordered his arrest for printing a <span class="italic">Postscript to Mr Higgins's Sermon</span>, a seditious and libellous tract (attributed to the nonjuror Charles Leslie) which defended Francis Higgins's earlier anti-whig polemic. Lloyd promptly disappeared and left his trading interest in the hands of his wife, of whom further details are unknown. However, he was back in business in 1709, and on 12 March, with help from his friend the printer and publisher Francis Dickson, he was able to rent the Union (hereafter Lloyd's) Coffee House, Cork Hill, and subsequently relinquished his ownership of another premises on Bridge Street.<br>
<br>In 1711 Lloyd visited Cork to dispose of copies of his single-sheet <span class="italic">Memorial of the Church of England</span>, which had appeared earlier that year and remained largely unsold. He was soon in trouble, and on 12 September Cork magistrates published a <span class="italic">Presentment of the grand jury of the city of Cork against Edward Lloyd, for publishing several libels</span> (1711), which argued that the bookseller intended to &#145;make the way easier for a popish pretender to possess the throne&#146;. A year later he was in dire trouble for publishing the <span class="italic">Memoirs of Chevalier de St George</span> and for issuing proposals for printing an abridgement of William Dicconson's life of James II. The magistrates at once ordered the seizure of Lloyd's book and identified him at his prosecution for treasonable libel, recorded in the Armagh diocesan papers, as the architect of a plan to promote the Pretender (James Stuart). Lloyd fled to England, and his petition to the duke of Ormond was referred to the tory lord chancellor of Ireland, Sir Constantine Phipps. Ormond ordered a stop to the legal proceedings on 18 June 1713 and Phipps interposed with a warrant for a <i>nolle prosequi</i>, to the anger of Dublin whigs. Unbowed by recent events, Lloyd began a new title, <span class="italic">Lloyd's Newsletter</span>, a vehemently anti-whig periodical. The whigs, victorious in the general election of autumn 1713, immediately threatened Phipps with impeachment for his defence of Lloyd, who had now returned to Dublin, if only for a brief period. In May 1714 he and his family gave up the Cork Hill coffee house and left Ireland for London.<br>
<br>The situation faced by Lloyd and Phipps was temporarily eased with the dissolution of parliament following the death of Queen Anne in August 1714. However, on 30 September Phipps was relieved of his responsibilities in Ireland and also returned to London, which he entered in October attended by a train of thirty horses, with Lloyd at the head of the procession. Thereafter Lloyd disappeared into obscurity until he published his <span class="italic">Description of the City of Dublin</span> (1732), in which he identified himself as a &#145;citizen and silk-thrower of London&#146; who had &#145;lived nearly twenty years in Ireland&#146;, suggesting that he had lived some ten years in Ireland between 1714 and 1732. In the same year as his account of Dublin he published a <span class="italic">Description of Cork</span> and a work on the Irish mercantile economy, <span class="italic">Thoughts on Trade</span>, in 1736. He then disappeared once more; details of his date and place of death remain unknown.<br>
