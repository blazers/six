<span class="headword">Cuffe,  Hamilton John Agmondesham</span>, fifth earl of Desart  (1848&#150;1934), <span class="occ">lawyer and public servant</span>, was born on 30 August 1848, the second son of John Otway O'Connor Cuffe, third earl of Desart (1818&#150;1865), and Lady Elizabeth (1822&#150;1898), third daughter of John Frederick Campbell, first Earl Cawdor, and his wife, Elizabeth Thynne, daughter of the second marquess of Bath. As a boy Cuffe served as a midshipman in the Royal Navy from 1860 to 1863. He was educated at Radley and at Trinity College, Cambridge, graduating BA in 1869. At the age of twenty-four, in 1872, he was called to the bar by the Inner Temple, in due course becoming a bencher in 1905.<br>
<br>On 19 July 1876 Cuffe married Lady Margaret Joan (1853&#150;1927), second daughter of Henry Thynne Lascelles, the fourth earl of Harewood, and Elizabeth Joanna, daughter of the first marquess of Clanricarde. They had two daughters, Joan Elizabeth Mary, who married Sir Harry Lloyd Verney, and Sybil Marjorie, who married William Bayard Cutting, Geoffrey Scott, and Percy Lubbock. Lord Desart succeeded to the peerage (Irish) as fifth earl on the death of his brother, the fourth earl, in 1898.<br>
<br>Desart had a long and distinguished career in the public service. In 1877 he became secretary to the judicature acts commission, which was responsible for implementing the amalgamation of common law and equity in the new Supreme Court of Judicature and the building of the new Royal Courts of Justice in the Strand. In 1878 he was appointed assistant solicitor to the Treasury, and between 1884 and 1894 served as assistant director of public prosecutions. At the age of forty-six he reached the peak of his career, being appointed solicitor to the Treasury (solicitor to the government) and queen's proctor (solicitor on behalf of the crown principally concerned to ensure that there was no abuse of the divorce laws) in 1894. He also succeeded Sir Augustus Stephenson as director of public prosecutions (DPP), the head of the state prosecution department, a post established only a few years previously.<br>
<br>As DPP, Desart kept a low profile, and did not publicly respond to public criticism. <i>Causes c&eacute;l&egrave;bres</i> for the prosecution of which he was responsible included the Jameson raid (1896); Jabez Balfour and the Liberator frauds (1895); Florence Maybrick (1889); the Moat Farm murder; Neil Cream; the prosecution of Lord Russell for bigamy before the House of Lords (1901); Oscar Wilde (1895); Adolph Beck (1895). He was averse to invoking the criminal law in matters of morals. As Treasury solicitor he conducted an inquiry into the kidnapping of Dr Sun Yatsen by the Chinese legation in London in 1896.<br>
<br>Desart was a cautious public servant, in the civil service tradition. His period of office as DPP was one of relative tranquillity. He refused to discuss individual cases publicly, although for some years until 1905 his annual report did contain details of <i>causes c&eacute;l&egrave;bres</i>, albeit expressed in rather bland style. He was involved in a dispute with the Law Society over the prosecution of fraudulent solicitors, but he adhered to a quiet but firm line.<br>
<br>The vesting of three such important public offices in one person was seen as acceptable in the nineteenth century, but became unworkable in the early twentieth century. In 1907 the <span class="roman">Criminal Appeal Act</span>, which gave a right of appeal and established the court of criminal appeal, created substantially more work for the DPP. Accordingly the <span class="roman">Prosecution of Offences Act</span> of 1908 made the DPP the independent head of an independent department, directly answerable to the attorney-general. Charles Matthews became DPP, and Desart remained Treasury solicitor until his retirement in 1909. In the same year, on the recommendation of H. H. Asquith, he was created Baron Desart of Desart, co. Kilkenny, in the peerage of the United Kingdom, in recognition of his considerable public service.<br>
<br>Desart was sceptical about the usefulness of his role as queen's (and subsequently king's) proctor, which involved intervening in divorce cases, taking the view that most divorce cases were in fact by consent, then not permitted. As he told the divorce commission in 1912, he felt he did more harm than good.<br>
<br>Desart was a British member in the North Sea Inquiry in Paris in 1905, investigating how on its way to the Far East the Russian fleet off Dogger Bank fired on British seamen, apparently thinking them to be the Japanese fleet. Following the Hague Convention of 1907, he was British plenipotentiary and president at the International Naval Conference in London in 1908&#150;9, which produced the declaration of London, proposing prize rules for international law. Although never ratified, it was accepted by the great powers, though in the event abandoned in the First World War in 1916. In 1910 Desart became one of the four British members of the International Court of Arbitration at The Hague. He presided over the United Kingdom prize claim committee in 1915.<br>
<br>In the House of Lords, Desart was a moderate Conservative. He voted for the <span class="roman">Parliament Bill</span> in 1911, and against the <span class="roman">Welsh Church Disestablishment Bill</span> in 1913. He was elected to the Irish senate in 1921. He received many honours and appointments: justice of the peace; CB (1894); KCB (1898); privy councillor (1913); knight of the Order of St Patrick (1919); his majesty's lieutenant for the county of Kilkenny (1920). He was devoted to Ireland, adopting a moderating and conciliatory approach to Irish affairs. &#145;Why am I a Unionist? Because I am an Irishman.&#146; Recognizing the seeming inevitability of some form of Irish home rule, as a southern unionist he opposed the <span class="roman">Government of Ireland Bill</span> of 1912&#150;14 because of the exclusion of Ulster, as he was opposed to the severance of Ireland in any form. He foresaw the danger of civil war in Ireland, but none the less expressed the wish to see Ireland prosper and its parliament succeed.<br>
<br>A man of strong character and great ability, Desart was an experienced statesmanlike figure who knew everybody of significance in public life. A lovable man and a magnificent friend, he had many friends. An Anglican churchman, he was a profoundly religious man. His principal hobby was shooting, and his clubs were the Travellers and the MCC. He lived at 2 Rutland Gardens, Knightsbridge, London; his house in Ireland, Desart Court, was burnt down by Sinn F&eacute;iners. He died aged eighty-six on 4 November 1934 at 29 Wimpole Street, London, leaving no male heir, and no heir presumptive, and the peerage thus became extinct.<br>
