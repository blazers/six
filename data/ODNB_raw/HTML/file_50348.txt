<span class="headword">Ottobuono</span> <span class="st"> [Ottobuono or Ottobono Fieschi; <em>later </em>Adrian V]</span>  (<em>c.</em>1205&#150;1276), <span class="occ">papal official and pope</span>, was born into the Genoese family of the counts of Lavagna. Trained as a theologian and canonist, he acquired distinguished Savoyard connections through his sister, the second wife of Count Thomas (II), but more valuable to his career was the fact that his uncle, Sinibaldo Fieschi, became pope as Innocent IV in June 1243. In November that year Ottobuono was made a papal chaplain, and he subsequently held archdeaconries at Rheims and Parma, before he became cardinal-deacon of San Adriano in 1252. Following his uncle's death in 1254 he remained an important figure at the curia, where his part in the negotiations with Henry III over the throne of Sicily, and his support for Henry's brother Richard and second son, Edmund, doubtless helped to secure his appointment by Clement IV on 4 May 1265 as papal legate to England.<br>
<br>Ottobuono's commission was threefold: to bring about peace and reconciliation following the barons' war; to reform the clergy and the working of the church; and to preach crusade. He left Rome after 19 July 1265, and by 30 August had reached Paris, where he learned of Simon de Montfort's death at Evesham on 4 August. He arrived in England on 29 October. He lodged in the Tower of London for safety, and met Henry III in Canterbury on 1 November, on that day summoning a council for the clergy.<br>
<br>At his first legatine council, held at either Westminster or London on 1 December 1265, Ottobuono made public his commissions, together with the powers he had from the pope to resolve &#145;urgent and arduous matters&#146;. Crusade and reform needed peace between the &#145;disinherited&#146; rebels and Henry III's advisers. The council was to initiate the peace. Ottobuono denounced and suspended four bishops as baronial supporters, issuing a general excommunication of all the king's enemies. However, these actions confirmed the suspicions of the rebels about his Savoyard connections and made his task more difficult.<br>
<br>There was very widespread unrest in the months after Evesham, intensified by royalist vindictiveness against former Montfortians. The king's lengthy siege of Kenilworth Castle gave Ottobuono the opportunity to demand, at a parliament held at Kenilworth in August 1266, that negotiations be entered into with the rebels, and he then helped to establish a committee of bishops and barons to decide what was needed to restore peace in the realm. The legate himself was to be one of two arbiters when differences arose within the committee. The result was the dictum of Kenilworth, announced on 31 October, and then proclaimed by Ottobuono to a church council in Coventry the following day. But the dictum was widely rejected at first, in spite of Ottobuono's efforts to promote it at a parliament held at Bury St Edmunds in February 1267, until in April the earl of Gloucester occupied London in order to force the government to give better terms to its adversaries. The legate, who was in the capital at the time, did not resist the earl, though he retreated to the Tower for safety. While there he was entrusted with the Westminster and crown jewels, used by the king as pledges for loans. He later moved to the Cistercian monastery of Stratford Langthorne in Essex, where he was joined by the king in May. Urgent negotiations, in which the legate was closely involved, finally led to a settlement and to the acceptance of the dictum, helped by a tax on the clergy which Ottobuono arranged in order to assist those disinherited in the civil war to redeem their lands. A letter from Ottobuono to Clement IV, probably of June 1267, spoke of &#145;varying degrees of discord lasting from the beginning of Lent until 20 June, after which came reconciliation from the hand of God&#146;  (Graham, &#145;Letters of Cardinal Ottoboni&#146;, 118&#150;19).<br>
<br>Ottobuono then proceeded to reconcile Llywelyn of Wales with the king. After four days of negotiations the treaty of Montgomery was agreed on 29 September 1267. Although his commission also covered Scotland and Ireland, Ottobuono visited neither country personally, operating instead through envoys. Alexander III, king of Scots, received one papal envoy, refused a second, a certain Master Maurice, entry to his court, and threatened a third with violence. Scottish bishops did attend the councils but, as regards Ireland, Ottobuono was more concerned to ensure that the crusade was preached there, arranging this through the bishop of Lismore. His commission for peace was concluded on 18 November 1267 by the <span class="roman">Statute of Marlborough</span>, which stressed a return to the rule of law and marked the success of his political work.<br>
<br>The resulting stability allowed Ottobuono to proceed with his commission on church reform. The exile of Boniface of Savoy, archbishop of Canterbury, enabled the legate to establish his authority over the English clergy. No election to a bishopric or abbacy could take place without his mandate. In April 1268 he convened a three-day council in London at St Paul's, at which all clergy were summoned to attend in person or by proctor. Having absolved excommunicate Montfortians, Ottobuono issued a set of fifty-three canons, based upon, and often specifically referring to, but none the less considerably amplifying, those issued in 1237 by the legate Otto. Surviving in some seventy versions, they remained fundamental to the law of the church in England until the sixteenth century&#151;they were first printed in 1504.<br>
<br>Ottobuono's constitutions deal with a wide range of issues of conduct and jurisdiction, affecting both the secular and regular clergy. For instance, the former were forbidden to exercise secular jurisdiction, or to take part in lawsuits in which judgments of blood might be given. Simony was condemned, as were concubinage and the bearing of arms, and severe restrictions were placed upon pluralism. Ottobuono sought to improve the position of vicars, and also to ensure that vicars resided in their livings. Archbishops and bishops, too, were expected to reside among their flocks, and restrictions were placed upon demands for procurations and other exactions liable to abuse. Orders were given for the maintenance of church buildings, and rights of sanctuary were upheld. The last thirteen canons deal with the regulars. Ottobuono was clearly knowledgeable in matters monastic. This emerges with particular clarity from the constitutions he issued to individual monasteries following visitations by his commissaries. One such was Westminster Abbey, to which he directed constitutions on 17 April, a few days before the council. But the canons directed in general terms to monks and nuns, though they doubtless gained in force from the legate's knowledge of conditions in particular houses, are largely devoted to commonplace matters of discipline and organization. They are concerned, for instance, to maintain traditional bans or restrictions on the eating of meat, on the holding of private property, and on engagement in trade, and to ensure that monks and nuns care properly for their sick, and make confession and celebrate the eucharist with becoming frequency. The complete set of canons was to be made public by being recited word for word by bishops at their annual diocesan synods.<br>
<br>Ottobuono's third commission, to preach the crusade, was not neglected. Clement had specified that if English crusaders did not go to the Holy Land, funds so far collected&#151;sufficient for 500 knights&#151;would be used elsewhere. This followed an extension of crusade preaching to deal with the rebels in England and also the planned invasion from France in September 1266 by the younger Simon de Montfort. This invasion did not materialize, and the pope continued to complain about the general lack of support for the crusade. In October 1266 he urged Ottobuono to preach with even more vigour.<br>
<br>At first there were difficulties. When Ottobuono called for a crusade at the Bury parliament, the magnates expressed misgivings about the likely effects of denuding the country of its defenders. But the legate persevered, preaching in London and again in Lincoln (where he used interpreters), and at Northampton in June or July 1268 he finally had the satisfaction of seeing the Lord Edward and many barons take the cross. When his legation to England ended in July 1268, Ottobuono returned to Italy having largely achieved what he set out to do. He attended the Second Council of Lyons in 1274, and on 11 July 1276, with the support of Charles of Anjou, he was elected pope, as Adrian V. But he died in Viterbo on 16 August without having being ordained priest, consecrated, or crowned, and was buried there in the church of San Francesco. His final bequests included prayers for Henry III and his family, and a hospital, dedicated to St Thomas of Canterbury in his native Liguria, where English pilgrims were to be specially received. Among his personal effects was found a precious jewel belonging to the English crown.<br>
