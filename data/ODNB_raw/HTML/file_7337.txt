<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Dawes,  William Rutter</span>  (1799&#150;1868), <span class="occ">astronomer</span>, was born on 19 March 1799 at Christ's Hospital, London. His father, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/50961/', "William Dawes (1762&#150;1836)")</script>, was an officer of marines, the official astronomer with the first fleet to New South Wales in 1787, and governor of Sierra Leone from 1792 to 1796, after which he was appointed mathematics master at Christ's Hospital. His mother, Judith Rutter, died when he was very young, and his father, after working for the abolitionist movement for several years, eventually settled in Antigua, where he ran a sugar plantation employing freed slaves. The young William was sent to Portsmouth to live with his paternal grandfather, Benjamin Dawes, and in 1807 was transferred to the care of Thomas Scott (the author of the biblical commentary) at Aston Sandford, near Haddenham, Buckinghamshire. Here he received his education, which was supplemented by a short period spent at Charterhouse School in 1811.<br>
<br>Although originally destined for an ecclesiastical career, Dawes felt dissatisfied with certain tenets of the Church of England, and he eventually chose to enter medicine. In 1820 he began his training at St Bartholomew's Hospital, and after qualifying as a doctor in 1825 he married Thomas Scott's widow and settled in Haddenham.<br>
<br>Dawes's sister, Judith, had married John Jones, who had business interests in the dockyard at Antigua. However, she died in 1826, and consequent family affairs made it necessary for Dawes to move to the Liverpool area. Here he met one of the leading independent ministers of the day, Dr Raffles, who persuaded him to take charge of a small congregation at Ormskirk. It was a position he retained for only a few years, but it afterwards resulted in his frequently being referred to as Reverend Dawes.<br>
<br>As a young man, Dawes had occasionally observed with a 2 inch refractor, and after moving to Liverpool he used a 1.6 inch refractor to observe double stars, which he identified with a Fortin edition of Flamsteed's <span class="italic">Atlas</span> that his father had taken to New South Wales. His first observatory, housing a 3.8 inch Dollond refractor, was set up at Ormskirk, and it was here that he began regular and methodical observations.<br>
<br>Dawes was elected fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society in 1830 and was a regular contributor to the <span class="italic">Monthly Notices</span> and the <span class="italic">Memoirs</span>. His first published observation was &#145;Occultation of Aldebaran, 9 Dec 1829&#146;, and his first extensive papers, submitted in 1831, were &#145;Observations of the triple star Zeta Cancri&#146; and &#145;Observations of double stars&#146;. These were followed by further papers on 126 double stars observed between 1830 and 1833 and by contributions on occultations, planets, comets, the solar eclipse of 1836, photometry, and instruments. He established a considerable reputation within a very short time and soon became a friend and colleague of some of the most eminent astronomers of the day, including Sir John Herschel and William Lassell, with whom he exchanged books and tested, and observed with, telescopes.<br>
<br>By the late 1830s Dawes had decided to seek a paid position as an astronomer. This was a time when affluent benefactors were setting up well-equipped observatories and employing &#145;assistants&#146; to carry out the observations. One of these patrons was George Bishop, who had amassed a considerable fortune in the wine trade. Bishop established an observatory, equipped with a 7 inch Dollond refractor, at South Villa, Regent's Park, London, and it was here that Dawes obtained a position in 1839. He continued to concentrate his efforts on the observation and measurement of 250 double stars, the results of which were published in 1852 in <span class="italic">Astronomical Observations at South Villa</span>. However, he was not credited with making the observations, which led to understandable resentment and his statement that Bishop was incapable of making any observations himself.<br>
<br>Dawes's second marriage, on 28 July 1842, to Ann, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Copeland, the widow of John Welsby, a solicitor of Ormskirk, provided him with independent means, and in 1844 he left Bishop's service and moved to Cranbrook, Kent, where he set up a 6<sup>1</sup>/<sub>3</sub> inch refractor by Merz. Here he worked indefatigably for the next few years, but continual headaches (probably migraine) and asthma&#151;both of which afflicted him throughout his life&#151;finally compelled him to move to Torquay in 1849. At this time he seriously considered abandoning his astronomical pursuits, but his interest was revived by a favourable improvement in his health, and in 1850 he moved to Wateringbury, near Maidstone. He had not long established his observatory there when, at the end of November, he again proved his observational skills by discovering Saturn's cr&ecirc;pe ring, which two weeks earlier had (unknown to him) been independently discovered by W. C. Bond with the 15 inch Merz refractor at Harvard College observatory.<br>
<br>In 1851 Dawes accompanied John Russell Hind (his successor at Bishop's observatory) to Sweden to observe the total solar eclipse of 28 July. This was the first European total eclipse since 1842, and Dawes's description and drawings of solar prominences formed a valuable contribution to the large number of results that were obtained at a time when the true nature of the prominences was still a mystery. The expedition seems to have inspired in him a greater interest in solar observation, and he soon afterwards designed and had made a complex solar eyepiece incorporating a sliding diaphragm-plate pierced with apertures varying from 0.5 to 0.0075 of an inch in diameter. This led to his discovery of the rotation of sunspots and the nature of their nuclei. He also disputed James Nasmyth's description of the pattern of &#145;willow leaves&#146; on the solar surface, which he considered inapplicable and misleading.<br>
<br>At that time, one of the prime requirements in astronomy was a standard scale for the measurement of stellar magnitudes. For many years Dawes had been carrying out methodical investigations into limiting magnitudes and the resolving power of telescopes. He also invented the wedge photometer, consisting of a sliding wedge of neutral-tint glass, originally incorporated in a later version of his solar eyepiece and afterwards used to estimate the magnitudes of stars. Much of his work formed the basis of Norman R. Pogson's research on the standard photometric scale, which was finally established in the mid-1850s. Charles Pritchard used a variation of his wedge photometer at Oxford observatory between 1881 and 1885.<br>
<br>In 1851 Dawes began corresponding with Alvan Clark, of Cambridgeport, Massachusetts. Clark had written to him to tell him of the double stars that he had discovered with object glasses of his own making, and Dawes was so impressed with their obvious quality that in 1854 he purchased a 7<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> inch object glass and tube, which he placed on his Merz mount. Over the next few years he purchased another four&#151;an 8 inch, a 7<sup>1</sup>/<sub>3</sub> inch, another 8 inch, and an 8<sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub> inch&#151;and sold each of them in turn. All of them subsequently passed through the hands of several eminent owners. The last of them&#151;a complete 8<sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub> inch refractor which Clark brought with him when he visited Dawes in 1859&#151;finally passed to the Temple Observatory of Rugby School in 1871.<br>
<br>For a few months after the sale of the 8<sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub> inch refractor in 1863 Dawes possessed no large instrument, but he had already ordered a complete 8 inch refractor from Thomas Cooke of York, and by 1864 he was able to resume his double-star and planetary observations. After his death this instrument belonged to a number of distinguished observers until it found a home at Cambridge observatory, where it bears the name of its last private owner, William Thorrowgood.<br>
<br>Dawes's contribution to double-star astronomy was enormous, and, although he never attempted to discover new double stars, a list of fifteen discovered by him between 1840 and 1859 was published in 1864. His critical eye was also turned to most solar system objects, although he rarely observed the moon or nebulae, and few variable stars were known at that time. Among his observations of Jupiter were the monitoring of white ovals, satellite phenomena, and features on the satellites. He made many important observations of Saturn, and apart from his discovery of the cr&ecirc;pe ring in 1850 he confirmed the existence of Encke's division in 1843, suggested discontinuity in the rings, and attentively studied the phenomena attending the disappearance of the ring system in 1848. His series of drawings of Mars made during the apparition of 1864&#150;5 are remarkably delicate and accurate, and include features similar to the &#145;canals&#146; (channels) discovered by Giovanni Schiaparelli in 1877. The other planets were of less interest to him. Dawes observed the transit of Mercury in 1848 and two occultations of Venus, occasionally observed the satellites of Uranus and Neptune, and was involved in the debate concerning the suspected ring of Neptune in 1846. He declared no interest in minor planets.<br>
<br>The nineteenth century was blessed with numerous bright comets, and Dawes observed many of them, notably those of Bremiker in 1840, Biela in 1845, De Vico and Mitchell in 1847, and Donati in 1858. His report on the Leonid meteor storm of 1866 was his single contribution to meteor astronomy.<br>
<br>Dawes was one of the leading observational astronomers of his time and &#145;by 1860 probably the most skilled visual observer with a refracting telescope in the world &hellip; the expanding firms of Clark and Cooke regarded his praise as a warranty for their object glasses&#146;  (Chapman, 47). His skill earned him the sobriquet &#145;eagle-eyed&#146;, and his reputation was such that G. B. Airy declared that any telescope tested and approved by him could be guaranteed to be of the highest quality. Throughout his life he owned numerous telescopes, micrometers, and peripheral items of equipment, and many of his 150 or so contributions to scientific journals were major papers. His penultimate paper described his own design for an observing chair especially suited for use with a large refractor.<br>
<br>Dawes appears to have been an amiable and honourable character. He was held in high regard by the people of his neighbourhood, especially the poor, for whom he always provided medical services free of charge. His scientific achievements were rewarded with the highest honours which could be bestowed. In 1855 he was awarded the gold medal of the Royal Astronomical Society, and in 1865 he was elected fellow of the Royal Society.<br>
<br>After the death of his wife in 1860 Dawes's health began to decline. Heart disease and rheumatism were added to the headaches and asthma which had afflicted him throughout his life, and yet he continued to observe until the end of 1867. His most extensive work, &#145;Catalogue of micrometrical measurements of double stars&#146;, covering the period 1839&#150;67, was published shortly before his death. He died at Haddenham on 15 February 1868 and was buried beside his wife in Haddenham churchyard.<br>
