<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Callow,  William</span>  (1812&#150;1908), <span class="occ">watercolour painter</span>, was born in Greenwich, Kent, on 28 July 1812, elder son of Robert Callow (1786&#150;1848), a master builder, and his wife, Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1848). <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4404/', "John Callow")</script> was his younger brother. William Callow showed an early talent for drawing and at the age of eleven was tinting prints for the engraver Theodore Fielding at his Newman Street studio, which was near to the Callow home in Tottenham Place, Camden Town, London. In 1825 Callow was formally articled to Fielding as a pupil in engraving and watercolour painting. Copley Fielding, future president of the Society of Painters in Water Colours, recognized potential in the young student and gave him advice and encouragement.<br>
<br>In 1829 Callow was sent to work with Newton Fielding in Paris and was at once enchanted with France, where the essential pattern of his career evolved. In Paris he met Thomas Shotter Boys, from whom he assimilated a method of calligraphic brush strokes and a liking for picturesque city scenes. There was also a received influence from R. P. Bonington, whose luminous use of wash is reflected in the style of Boys. By 1833 Callow was independent of the Fieldings and established in his own atelier. He enjoyed a growing reputation as a watercolourist, and his studio attracted a flourishing circle of pupils, including members of the French aristocracy. The success of <span class="italic">Vue du pont de Richmond</span>, exhibited at the Paris Salon in 1834, led to Callow being asked to give lessons in watercolour painting to the family of King Louis Philippe. His daughter, Princess Cl&eacute;mentine, was a pupil of Callow for seven years and became a lifelong friend.<br>
<br>Callow's range of subject matter was broadened by a series of long walking tours through France, Germany, and Switzerland (1835&#150;40). These were chronicled in detailed diary entries which appear in his posthumously published autobiography. Many finished watercolours were based on sketches made at this time.<br>
<br>In 1838 Copley Fielding strongly supported the election of Callow as an associate of the Society of Painters in Water Colours, although his work was virtually unknown in England. He was awarded a gold medal at the Paris Salon in 1840, but in the following year gave up an established career in France and returned to London, where he purchased 20 Charlotte Street (later Hallam Street), near Regent's Park, in 1842. Callow's watercolours proved to be an immediate success in England and he soon gathered another group of well-connected pupils, including two future viceroys of India and members of the Rothschild family. He was a tall, handsome man, with an air of French courtliness and a real love of teaching which made him one of the best-known drawing masters of the day.<br>
<br>In 1843 the duke of Devonshire commissioned two watercolours from Callow as a gift for Queen Victoria, <span class="italic">Chatsworth, the Garden Front</span> and <span class="italic">The Great Conservatory</span>, which are now in the Royal Collection at Windsor Castle (where in 1829 Robert Callow had superintended some building work). Callow was elected a full member of the Society of Painters in Water Colours in 1848 and was presented to Queen Victoria and Prince Albert at the 1852 exhibition and again in 1860. Prince Albert acquired two watercolours, of which <span class="italic">The Bay of Naples, Early Morning</span> (1852) was later engraved in the <span class="italic">Art Journal</span> in a series entitled &#145;The Royal Pictures&#146;  (Jan 1856, 16). Callow had first visited Italy in 1840, after which Italian scenes, particularly of Venice, were among his most popular subjects. An art critic in <span class="italic">The Athenaeum</span> commented: &#145;Mr. Callow is beyond average in his clever, highly tinted architectural sketches&#146;  (1488, 3 May 1856, 559). Over fifty years of extensive travel is reflected in his continental street scenes of tall fa&ccedil;ades and bustling crowds, but tours of the British Isles are also represented, often in breezy coastal subjects, with shipping.<br>
<br>On 2 July 1846 Callow married one of his fashionable pupils, Harriet Anne Smart (1818&#150;1883), niece of the prominent musician Sir George Smart. The couple shared cultural interests: William delighted in music and Harriet was a talented amateur artist. As her health was delicate, the Callows moved out of London in 1855 to Great Missenden, Buckinghamshire. There they built a large house, named The Firs, although Callow retained premises in London until he finally gave up teaching in 1882. He exhibited 1400 works with the Society of Painters in Water Colours (which became the Royal Society after 1881) and was a trustee (1861 to 1876) and secretary from 1866 to 1870. He painted some pictures in oils, mostly for exhibition at the Royal Academy, including <span class="italic">Porta della Carta, Venice</span> (exh. 1854). He also showed with the British Institution and the Royal Liverpool Academy. Callow never deviated from traditional watercolour methods, in spite of a trend for experimentation, but some original purity of colour and clarity of line was lost in later over-elaboration. A convoluted monogram (which can be misread as CW) was used by Callow for a period in the mid-1830s, but W. Callow or Wm. Callow in back-sloping script is his most characteristic signature.<br>
<br>In 1863 Princess Cl&eacute;mentine (by then duchess of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha) arranged for Callow to sketch at some of the German castles, including Rosenau, near Coburg. Queen Victoria was staying there at the time and received Callow in the garden, much admiring his work. He gave several lessons to the crown princess of Prussia during this tour and was entertained as a guest at Potsdam palace, where he again taught the princess in 1874.<br>
<br>Harriet Callow died on 30 June 1883. Only six months later, on 8 January 1884, Callow, aged seventy-one, married Mary Louisa Jefferay (1857&#150;1937), aged twenty-seven, daughter of a harness maker from Wendover, Buckinghamshire. There were no children of either marriage, but the second was one of special contentment. On his ninetieth birthday Callow was presented with a congratulatory address from the Royal Society of Painters in Water Colours, illuminated by the painter E. R. Hughes, a close friend, who always referred to Callow as &#145;the Maestro&#146;. By now his sight was failing, but work from earlier portfolios continued to sell and a highly praised retrospective exhibition was mounted at the Leicester Galleries in 1907. A review in <span class="italic">The Studio</span> declared that &#145;Mr. Callow has faithfully upheld the best tradition of the old British School of watercolour painting&#146;  (1907, 142). He was now the oldest living British artist, but retained remarkable stamina, walking 5 miles a day, until just before his death at The Firs, from pleurisy, following influenza, aged ninety-five, on 20 February 1908. The obituary in <span class="italic">The Times</span> paid tribute to a celebrated artist who had progressed from boy apprentice to friend of royalty. A memorial plaque to Callow was placed in the church of St Peter and St Paul, Great Missenden, in the churchyard of which he had been buried on 25 February 1908.<br>
<br>Two watercolours were donated to the Tate Gallery, London, in 1909, which purchased twenty-six of Callow's continental sketches in 1912. These spanned thirty years of his career, from <span class="italic">Belfry Tower, Ghent</span> (1844) to <span class="italic">Old Street, Prague</span> (1874). The Victoria and Albert Museum has thirty-three examples of his work, including <span class="italic">Market Place, Frankfurt</span> and <span class="italic">Leaning Towers, Bologna</span>. This prolific watercolour painter is represented in over sixty public collections, including the Mus&eacute;e du Ch&acirc;teau de Versailles.<br>
