<span class="headword">Mayne,  Ethelind Frances Colburn</span>  (1865&#150;1941), <span class="occ">author and translator</span>, was born at Johnstown, co. Kilkenny, on 7 January 1865, the eldest surviving child (she had a younger brother and sister) of Charles Edward Bolton Mayne (<i>d</i>. 1927) of the Royal Irish Constabulary, and his wife, (Charlotte) Emily Henrietta (<i>d</i>. 1902), daughter of Captain William Sweetman of the 16th lancers. The family moved to Kinsale, co. Cork, and finally settled in the city of Cork where her father became a resident magistrate. She was educated at private schools in Ireland, and at some stage became sufficiently accomplished in French and German to work professionally as a translator. Little of her early life is known until the age of thirty. If her novels are a reflection of her life as a young woman, she experienced with some irritation the confines of rural Irish life. She spent her time translating verse, writing short stories, and following literary activity in London through the press.<br>
<br>When the <span class="italic">Yellow Book</span> was launched in April 1894 Mayne submitted a story, &#145;A Pen-and-Ink Effect&#146;, under the pseudonym Frances E. Huntley. The <span class="italic">Yellow Book</span>'s editor, Henry Harland, sent Mayne a letter, &#145;not only accepting the story but praising it in words which even now it thrills me to recall&#146;  (Mayne, &#145;Some reminscences&#146;). She could not know that effusiveness, particularly to female authors, was Harland's usual mode of address. In December 1895 she accepted Harland's offer of employment as sub-editor of the <span class="italic">Yellow Book</span>, and left Cork on new year's day 1896 to take up the position in replacement of Ella D'Arcy who had gone to France. Mayne came under the spell of Harland for his charm, his editorial &eacute;lan, and his literary commitment to &#145;the clearer vision&#146; of the writer, a phrase she used in 1898 as the title for her first volume of short stories. Their industrious partnership was ended abruptly by D'Arcy's return in spring 1896. With no authority but her own, D'Arcy banished Mayne from the office, removed a story of hers that was scheduled for the next edition, and deleted phrases in praise of Mayne written by Harland under his Yellow Dwarf soubriquet. Mayne hoped that Harland would resolve the situation, but he was a cowardly man who avoided confrontation, and he went to Paris in order to escape from the conflict. Despairing of receiving just treatment, she returned to Ireland. Although her prose was always to show the influence of Harland in its allusiveness and searching out of the <i>bon mot</i>, their friendship was not resumed.<br>
<br>Despite this setback Mayne had now embarked on her most important literary endeavour, as a short-story writer, and reverted to publishing under her own name (she always regretted the early subterfuge of a pseudonym). <span class="italic">The Clearer Vision</span> was the first of six volumes of her stories including <span class="italic">Things That No One Tells</span> (1910)&#151;an apt description of the content of her stories&#151;and <span class="italic">Inner Circle</span> (1925). Her fiction shows a dark and brooding vision of Victorian domestic life, particularly the lives of women. The children in her stories are often ugly, the women plain and lonely, the mothers unsympathetic. Her writing shows an intensity of emotion about the perverse and petty tyrannies of everyday life: a woman's desire to have her own room; the wish of schoolgirls that their most popular friend is not in love with her intended husband. The stories tell of impossible yearning and unspoken sentiments with the course of whole lives changed by a few words misunderstood or unsaid. She was compared as a short-story writer to Henry James and Katherine Mansfield but critical acclaim was not followed by popular success and prosperity. A first novel, which was based on her <span class="italic">Yellow Book</span> experiences in London, was not published and the manuscript has been lost.<br>
<br>Mayne's first published novel, <span class="italic">Jessie Vandeleur</span>, whose plot centres on literary theft, came out in 1902. In that year her mother died, and the burden of looking after her father fell on her as the maiden daughter. In her second novel, <span class="italic">The Fourth Ship</span> (1908), she wrote:<blockquote>There are three ships that we all watch for&#151;the golden-sailed <i>Love</i>; the ship with white sails called <i>The Little Child</i>; the <i>Success</i> with rosy sails. For some of us all come home; for some one or the other, for some, again, none of these comes home.</blockquote>She had accurately predicted her own fate. In her forties she began publishing translations from French and German, and embarked on factual studies of regency themes. Her two-volume life of Byron (1912), described as &#145;one of the most brilliant biographies of our age&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 28 June 1929), was followed by <span class="italic">The Life of Lady Byron</span> (1929), which interpreted Byron's relationship with Augusta Leigh, his half-sister, as being sexual and therefore incestuous, and the reason why Byron's separation from his wife was irrevocable.<br>
<br>When Mayne's father retired in 1905 the family moved to London. His death on 8 January 1927 was a double blow as it also meant the loss of his pension. She moved from fashionable Holland Road, Kensington, to various Richmond and Twickenham addresses, accompanied by her invalid sister Violet and her brother-in-law. Over sixty, and not strong, she was solely dependent on literary earnings which were reckoned to average about &pound;27 a year. She was given a civil list pension of &pound;85 a year on 16 March 1927 for &#145;services to literature&#146;, and in May 1939, when her output had dwindled and she had no means but the pension, the Royal Literary Fund granted her &pound;150 in two annual instalments. In the 1920s and 1930s she served on the English committee of the F&eacute;mina Vie Heureuse prize, from 1924&#150;5 as president. Her opinions on the literary works she was invited to judge could be acerbic.<br>
<br>A friend to Hugh Walpole, Violet Hunt, and Mary Butts, Mayne was clearly tolerant of their unconventional lifestyles. Her letters show evidence of close emotional relationships, including with Mary Butts. She died, unmarried, on 30 April 1941 at the Trinity Nursing Home, Torquay, Devon. Although she was an influential modernist writer, she did not ally herself to movements or espouse theories, and this has limited critical appreciation of her work.<br>
