<span class="headword">Stewart,  Charles Stewart  Vane-Tempest-</span>, sixth marquess of Londonderry  (1852&#150;1915), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born in London on 16 July 1852. He was the eldest son, and one of six children, born to George Henry Robert Charles William Vane-Tempest, fifth marquess of Londonderry (1821&#150;1884), and his wife, Mary Cornelia (<i>d</i>. 1906), daughter of Sir John Edwards, bt. He was educated at Eton College and at Christ Church, Oxford, and also spent a year studying at the Royal University of Ireland. His marriage, on 2 October 1875, to <a href="#cosubject_45973">Lady Theresa Susey Helen Chetwynd-Talbot [<i>see below</i>]</a>, eldest daughter of Charles John, nineteenth earl of Shrewsbury, united two great aristocratic families, and seems to have been a dynastic alliance rather than a love match. Londonderry, who succeeded to the family marquessate in 1884, had two sons and one daughter by this marriage, although the paternity of the younger son, Charles Stewart Reginald, was generally doubted. In 1885 he changed the family patronymic from Vane-Tempest to Vane-Tempest-Stewart, restoring a reference to the clan from which he was descended.<br>
<br>The Londonderry family fortune spanned the Irish Sea, and united farming land in co. Down with coalmines in Durham. The second marquess of Londonderry (better known as Lord Castlereagh) had been MP for co. Down and one of the architects of the <span class="roman">Act of Union</span> of 1801; and this legacy, combined with the family interest in Ireland, weighed heavily with both the sixth marquess and his wife. As Viscount Castlereagh he was returned for co. Down in 1878 in an expensive by-election that recalled his predecessor's contest in the same county in 1790. Although an inconspicuous MP, Castlereagh was&#151;like many Irish magnates&#151;frightened by the growth of agrarian agitation in Ireland after 1879, and the parallel development of the home-rule movement: at this time he joined the Orange order. He left the Commons in 1884 on the death of his father: thereafter he sat in the House of Lords as Earl Vane (the family marquessate being an Irish creation).<br>
<br>In July 1886, after the formation of Lord Salisbury's second administration, Londonderry was appointed viceroy of Ireland, with Sir Michael Hicks Beach as the chief secretary. Londonderry was a much more trenchant Unionist and advocate of property right than Hicks Beach&#151;and this balance may well have been what Salisbury was seeking to achieve; in any event there were tensions between the two ministers that were resolved only in March 1887, when Hicks Beach was replaced by Arthur Balfour, a man much more in tune with Londonderry's loyalist convictions. Londonderry stoutly supported Balfour's programme of interactive coercion and conciliation, and was rewarded in 1888 with the Garter. He retired from the viceroyalty in 1889, having originally undertaken to spend no more than three years in this demanding and expensive office.<br>
<br>Londonderry's intimate connection with the government of Ireland between 1886 and 1889 confirmed his antipathy for Irish nationalists and for agrarian radicalism. Unionism, and the defence of property, were the two central preoccupations of the rest of his career. He was a prominent critic of the second <span class="roman">Home Rule Bill</span> in 1893. But he was also suspicious of Conservative legislation affecting Irish land, and he caustically rejected Gerald Balfour's <span class="roman">Land Bill</span> of 1896. Like his friend Edward Saunderson, he harried the Conservative government of which he was nominally a supporter between 1896&#150;7, urging the case of the Irish gentry.<br>
<br>Londonderry had been offered the post of lord privy seal in 1895 but, anxious for departmental experience, he had declined. Between 1895 and 1897 he found the administrative discipline for which he craved through chairing the London school board. His vocal dissent in the House of Lords to the Conservative front bench increased the value of his acquiescence; and, in 1900, on the creation of Lord Salisbury's fourth administration, he was appointed postmaster general. In August 1902 he was translated to the Board of Education as its first president: he was responsible for guiding Balfour's <span class="roman">Education Bill</span> through the Lords and for the administration of this controversial measure. After 1903 he held the education portfolio in association with the lord presidency of the council: he administered the board from the privy council offices because of their sunny outlook over Whitehall. He was a competent and conscientious minister, though excessively deferential to &#145;the stormy impetuosity&#146; of civil servants such as Robert Morant and to the occasionally outrageous interference of his own wife. His conduct in parliament was characterized by what Almeric Fitzroy termed &#145;voluble vagueness&#146;.<br>
<br>After 1906, and the return of a Liberal government, Londonderry devoted himself to the Irish Unionist cause. This bond was fastened in 1910 with the election of his old friend and prot&eacute;g&eacute; Edward Carson to the chairmanship of the Irish Unionist parliamentary party. Londonderry was one of the most prominent critics of the third <span class="roman">Home Rule Bill</span>, and the single most vocal Unionist in the House of Lords. He was a signatory of the Ulster solemn league and covenant of September 1912, and chaired the strategically vital standing committee of the Ulster Unionist Council. In September 1913 he presided over the Ulster Unionist Council meeting that brought about the creation of a provisional government in Ulster. Publicly he was prepared to sanction the most extreme forms of resistance to home rule: like Carson he subscribed &pound;10,000 to an indemnity fund designed for the paramilitary Ulster Volunteer Force. Privately, like Carson, he was more circumspect than might have been guessed by such gestures.<br>
<br>After the euphoria of the struggle against home rule, the outbreak of war in August 1914 brought anxiety and depression. He was concerned for the fate of the Unionist cause: chief among his personal concerns was the fate of his son and heir, Charles Stewart Henry, Viscount Castlereagh (1878&#150;1949), who had gone to the western front. Londonderry fell victim to influenza and, later, to pneumonia in January 1915. He died at his co. Durham home, Wynyard Park, on 8 February 1915 and was buried at Long Newton, co. Durham.<br>
<br>Londonderry was survived by his wife, and by his elder son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36627/', "Charles Stewart Henry Vane-Tempest-Stewart")</script>, and daughter; his younger son, Reginald, had died in 1899. His relations with his wife, <a name="cosubject_45973"></a><span class="headword">Theresa Susey Helen  Vane-Tempest-Stewart</span>, marchioness of Londonderry  (1856&#150;1919)<span class="occ"></span>, had occasionally been strained by her infidelities&#151;an affair with Harry Cust led to a lengthy period during which the married couple were believed never to speak to each other except in public&#151;but the marriage survived and was characterized in later years by warmth and mutual support. Lady Londonderry, born on 6 June 1856 and known to her friends as Nellie, was perhaps the leading Conservative hostess of the Edwardian era. Deprived of a first-rate political role, she exploited every conventional resource in order to articulate and advance her opinions: she acted as patron to many emerging tory politicians, was an unflagging correspondent, and a relentless string-puller. After the election of Andrew Bonar Law, a reserved widower, to the Conservative Party leadership in November 1911, she came into her own as the presiding genius of tory high society. Like her husband, she was conscious of the Unionist traditions of the Londonderry family, and wrote a short memoir of the first Viscount Castlereagh. She was one of the architects, and first president of the Ulster women's unionist council. The death of her husband in 1915 brought social and political eclipse, and also nagging (if unfounded) financial worries. She survived him by only four years, and died at her home, 5 Carlton House Terrace, London, on 16 March 1919.<br>
