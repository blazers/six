<span class="headword">Page, Sir  Thomas Hyde</span>  (1746&#150;1821), <span class="occ">military engineer</span>, was born in Harley Street, Westminster, the son of Robert Hyde Page (<i>d</i>. 1764), military engineer, and Elizabeth, daughter of Francis Morewood. He attended the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, and as the first cadet received a gold medal from George III. Appointed practitioner engineer and second lieutenant in the corps of Royal Engineers on 28 July 1769, Page was promoted sub-lieutenant and engineer in 1774. The following year Lord Townshend, then master-general of the ordnance, requested Page &#145;to take a view of the Bedford Level&#146;, with the purpose of improving the general drainage in the county. This he did, and his manuscript report to Lord Townshend, dated 31 March 1775, is in the library of the Institution of Civil Engineers. He also constructed a ferry at Chatham and was awarded a gold medal of the Society of Arts, 1775.<br>
<br>Page went with his corps to North America and distinguished himself in his capacity as aide-de-camp to General Pigott at Bunker Hill (17 June 1775), when he was severely wounded, losing his leg below the knee. His disability earned him a pension of 10 shillings per day. In 1777 he married Susanna, widow of Edmund Bastard of Kitley, Devon, and sister of Sir Thomas Crawley-Boevey, baronet. Appointed commanding royal engineer of the eastern coastal district, for the next few years Page supervised the refurbishment of defences at Dover, Chatham, Tilbury, Gravesend, Sheerness, and Landguard Fort. He also organized, in 1780, the Dover Volunteers. In 1782 the Board of Ordnance, anxious about the lack of pure water in its garrisons and dockyards, asked Page to bore a well at Sheerness garrison. He determined to try to sink through the quicksands by means of two cylindrical frames of wood of different diameters, excavating within the small circle first, and lowering it progressively as the large circle was formed above it. The experiment failed, and Page was much blamed. In the House of Commons the experiment was said to be &#145;not a well for fresh water, but a sink for the money of the public&#146;. A second attempt was made, this time in Fort Townshend at Sheerness, and was successful. Page's report upon the Sheerness well is dated 12 May 1783. Plans and sections were published in the <span class="italic">Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society</span>, 74, together with an account of similar treacherous soils at Harwich and Landguard Fort.<br>
<br>Page's certificate of candidature of the Royal Society was read on 3 April 1783 and supported by Charles Hutton and others. On 10 July 1783 he was elected a fellow, being described as &#145;a gentleman well versed in mechanics and many other branches of experimental philosophy&#146;. He was knighted on 23 August 1783, but states in his <span class="italic">Account of the Commencement and Progress in Sinking Wells at Sheerness</span> (1797), p. 10, that he &#145;considered the knighthood to have reference to his military services, and not to the well at Sheerness&#146;. In 1783 he married Mary Albinia (<i>d</i>. 1794), daughter of John Woodward (formerly captain in the 70th regiment) of Ringwould, Kent, and they had five children. His third marriage, to Mary, widow of Captain Everett RN, was childless.<br>
<br>Page was promoted captain-lieutenant in 1784 and captain on 20 April 1787, before being moved to the invalid engineers four months later. His expertise remained in demand none the less. He was chief consulting engineer in the improvement of the port of Dublin, of Wicklow harbour, of the inland navigation of Ireland, and of the Royal Shannon and Newry canals. He directed the repairing of the disastrous breach in the dock canal at Dublin in 1792, and was chief engineer for forming the new cut from Eau Brinck to King's Lynn, a problem of navigation and drainage that had puzzled engineers since the time of Charles I.<br>
<br>Page lived for many years at Betshanger Park, Kent, but latterly retired, for reasons of health, to France. He died at Boulogne on 30 June 1821, and was buried there.<br>
