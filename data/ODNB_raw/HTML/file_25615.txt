<span class="headword">Sinclair,  George</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1696?), <span class="occ">natural philosopher</span>, of unknown birth and parentage, described himself as from the Lothians and possessed property in Haddington, Haddingtonshire. He and his brother John were probably educated at the University of St Andrews. John was for a time regent at St Leonard's College, St Andrews, then from 1647 minister of Ormiston in Haddingtonshire; he left in 1683 for Delft, in the Low Countries, where he died in 1687.<br>
<br>George Sinclair taught at St Andrews before moving to Glasgow in 1655, where he was admitted master and appointed professor of philosophy. In 1656 he gave 100 marks towards the building of Glasgow College, and lent a larger sum which was repaid with interest in 1659. During this time the marquess of Argyll obtained rights to the wreck of the Spanish vessel <i>Florida</i>, which had foundered in Tobermory Bay after the defeat of the Armada. Sinclair, &#145;almost the only cultivator of physics during this age&#146; as Stevenson generously described him  (Stevenson, xi), assisted when a diving bell was brought to the site, possibly by Archibald Millar of Greenock. Several pieces of ordnance were recovered before stormy weather ended the exercise. Sinclair subsequently devised his own diving bell and described its use in a stylized classical debate in his <span class="italic">Ars nova et magna gravitatis et levitatis</span>  (1669, pp. 220&#150;44).<br>
<br>Sinclair's four-volume <span class="italic">Tyrocinia mathematica</span> (1661) was prepared for his students; it was reissued in London as <span class="italic">Principia mathematica</span> in 1672. When the professors were required to submit to the episcopal form of government, Sinclair, who had been allocated a university house in 1665, declined to do so and resigned his post in 1667. He then found employment in the mines of southern Scotland as a mineral surveyor and engineer, and was the first to suggest a practical method of draining coalmines. He was also among the first in Britain to measure heights and mine depths with a barometer: using a sealed tube and a bottle of mercury he assembled the barometer to take readings at the base and summit of a hill, first on Hartfell, near Moffat, and later on Arthur's Seat, in Edinburgh, and at Leadhills and Tinto. His <span class="italic">Hydrostaticks</span> (1672) was a gallimaufry of practical and theoretical physics, drawing on his experiences with the diving bell and barometer. His claims to innovation were immediately attacked in a series of anonymous letters ridiculing the novelty of his ideas, which had long been taught at St Andrews. A long satirical attack, under a pseudonym but known to be from James Gregory, professor of mathematics at St Andrews, was published in 1672. Sinclair penned a riposte, the manuscript of which he presented to the University of Glasgow in 1692.<br>
<br>In 1673&#150;4 Sinclair, then a schoolmaster at Leith, was employed by the Edinburgh magistrates to superintend the bringing of the city's first supply of drinking-water from Comiston, for which he was paid &pound;66 13<i>s</i>. 4<i>d</i>. His <span class="italic">Hydrostaticks</span> was reissued as <span class="italic">Natural Philosophy &hellip;</span> in 1683, now dedicated to the provost and council of Edinburgh. His <span class="italic">Principles of Astronomy and Navigation</span> followed in 1688. Besides his practical science, Sinclair was interested in aspects of religion, which led him to issue under his own name <span class="italic">Truth's Victory over Error</span>, a translation of the Latin lectures on the confession of faith delivered by David Dickson, professor of divinity at Glasgow. The book for which Sinclair was best-known was <span class="italic">Satan's Invisible World Discovered</span> (1685), a compilation of numerous &#145;authentic&#146; manifestations of witches, devils, spirits, and other apparitions, in which he defended the popular belief in witchcraft as essential to orthodoxy.<br>
<br>Following the revolution of 1688 Sinclair declared himself willing to swear the oath of allegiance. He was recalled to the University of Glasgow as a regent, and in 1692 became professor of mathematics and experimental philosophy. He is last heard of in April 1696 and probably died later that year.<br>
