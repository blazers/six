<span class="headword">Pilch,  Fuller</span>  (1804&#150;1870), <span class="occ">cricketer</span>, youngest son of Nathaniel Pilch and Frances Fuller, was born at Horningtoft, near Fakenham, Norfolk, on 17 March 1804. He learned the trade of a tailor and showed his enthusiasm for cricket as a boy. He went north to Sheffield to earn his living and was said to have been coached in the game by William Fennex, one of the old Hambledon players.<br>
<br>In 1820, at the age of seventeen, with his brothers Nathaniel and William, Pilch played in his first match at Lord's for Norfolk against the MCC. Although he failed with the bat, he took four wickets, and William Ward, who made 278 for the MCC, predicted his future success. After returning south to Bury St Edmunds in 1825, he joined the powerful Bury club, for which he made his first century&#151;137 not out against Woodbridge in 1830. He again appeared at Lord's in 1827 for England against Sussex in one of the three &#145;experimental&#146; matches, when the new round-arm bowling was publicly tested; he was the highest scorer with 38. When, in the following year, round-arm bowling was legalized, he learned both to play it as a batsman and to bowl it himself.<br>
<br>After moving to Norwich in 1829, Pilch twice defeated Thomas Marsden, the Yorkshire champion, in single-wicket contests in 1833. 1834 was a spectacular year, in which he made 87 not out, and 73 and 153 not out in two matches for Norfolk against Yorkshire. He also scored 105 not out for England against Sussex, and his aggregate of 811 runs in major matches was not surpassed for twenty-seven years.<br>
<br>These successes led Pilch to move to Kent, where he made eighty-four appearances for the county side (1836&#150;54), for which he was paid &pound;100 a season. He also played (1846&#150;51) for William Clarke's All England eleven, taking his own scythe to cut some of the rough pitches encountered in matches against &#145;odds&#146; up and down the land. Between 1827 and 1849 he represented the Players against the Gentlemen on twenty-four occasions. In July 1837, when Victorian England was less than a fortnight old, he was dismissed &#145;hat knocked on wicket&#146;; he remained one of the last players to bat in a top hat. He continued to score heavily in club matches, prizing most his 160 for his home town of Malling against Reigate, also in 1837. He was one of the great players in the great Kent eleven of the time and the county benefited not only from his batting but also from his &#145;management and knowledge of the game&#146;. His last appearance at Lord's was in 1854.<br>
<br>In 1862 (when W. G. Grace was only fourteen) Haygarth's <span class="italic">Scores and Biographies</span> called Pilch &#145;the best batsman that has ever yet appeared&#146;, with a style of batting which was &#145;commanding, extremely forward&#146; and able to crush the best bowling before it could &#145;shoot, rise or do mischief&#146;. James Pycroft used Pilch as his model of classical batting and scientific play in his <span class="italic">The Cricket Field</span>, and G. F. Watts used him as a model in another sense in his lithograph (<i>c</i>.1840) entitled <span class="italic">The Batsman</span>. He was also portrayed in a water-colour by J. C. Anderson in 1851, but it is Watts who best conveys the image of a tall, slim, and graceful performer.<br>
<br>Pilch was popular, respected, and kind. In his old age he was landlord of the Saracen's Head in Canterbury, where &#145;an accurate account of his sayings and doings&#146; was gathered by Frederick Gale for his <span class="italic">The Game of Cricket</span>. He also ran a shop selling cricket equipment. In 1870, shortly before his death, he published his <span class="italic">Whole Art of Cricket</span>, a brief manual of instructions on how to bat and bowl, with diagrams. He died, unmarried, at Lower Bridge Street, Canterbury, on 1 May 1870; he was buried at St Gregory's Church, also in Canterbury.<br>
