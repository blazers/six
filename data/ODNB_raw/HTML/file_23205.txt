<span class="headword">Ray,  Thomas Mathew</span>  (1801&#150;1881), <span class="occ">political organizer</span>, was born in Dublin, the eldest son of Mathew Ray, a master cooper, and his wife, Sarah Carton. Brought up a Catholic, he received a classical education at Dublin schools. In 1842 Ray was admitted to both the King's Inns, Dublin, and Gray's Inn, London, but there is no record of him practising at the bar. Similarly, in 1843 he became a student at Trinity College, Dublin, but never graduated.<br>
<br>Ray worked as a scrivener before becoming secretary of the National Trades Political Union in 1832 and the Trades Union election committee. He was active in registering voters for Daniel O'Connell's return for Dublin in the 1832 election. In 1835 Ray published <span class="italic">A List of the Constituency of Dublin</span>. Appointed an official of O'Connell's General Association of Ireland of 1836, his stipend was continued by O'Connell when he dissolved the association in 1837. Ray was the linchpin of O'Connell's new Precursor Society in 1838. Detained elsewhere, O'Connell told Ray, &#145;you must prepare and have everything ready to commence operations on my arrival in Dublin&#146;. Ray was told to establish a committee by attending parish meetings  (<span class="italic">Limerick Standard</span>, 19 Oct 1838). Such remote control through Ray also characterized the celebrated Repeal Association set up by O'Connell in 1840. Ray happily undertook the details of party management, printing and distributing addresses, campaigning in the country, handling donations and the O'Connell rent, enrolling members, and furnishing the necessary returns. O'Connell even charged Ray with ordering his suits  (<span class="italic">Correspondence of Daniel O'Connell</span>, 6.369).<br>
<br>Ray's letters to O'Connell sometimes bordered on the obsequious: &#145;Pardon me, my dear Liberator, for I fear in my anxiety I may trespass more than needful on your time&#146;  (<span class="italic">Correspondence of Daniel O'Connell</span>, 8.38). One of Ray's sons was christened O'Connell. Nevertheless, behind such deference Ray exercised very considerable influence. For his part, O'Connell had &#145;unlimited confidence&#146; in Ray  (ibid., 7.68). Advising his son John in 1840, O'Connell declared: &#145;Give your best support to Ray who is just the best man in his station I ever met with, beyond comparison the best&#146;  (ibid., 8.38). The &#145;Liberator&#146; was aware that Ray's health was brittle and that he was beset by the problems of a large family. O'Connell told his son to shield Ray tactfully from a jealous opponent  (ibid., 6.360). Publicly, O'Connell declared him &#145;a RAY to illumine the dark pages of our country's wrongs (cheering)&#146;  (<span class="italic">Limerick Reporter</span>). Ray's daughter Mary sometimes acted as O'Connell's personal secretary and was lauded by the &#145;Liberator&#146; as the first female Repealer  (<span class="italic">Freeman's Journal</span>, 5 Jan 1841).<br>
<br>In late 1844 the Peel government placed O'Connell and his lieutenants, including Ray, on trial for sedition, arising out of a series of &#145;monster&#146; repeal meetings in the previous year. Ray's counsel, J. Hatchell QC, maintained that it was &#145;a monstrous thing to include Mr. Ray in this indictment&#146;. As the paid organizer, working for the support of his family, he had attended only two meetings as a spectator. Ray's indictment deliberately precluded his citation, with the books of the Repeal Association, as a defence witness  (Shaw, 335). The jury, containing no Catholics, found against Ray, who was sentenced to nine months' imprisonment and a fine of &pound;50. Ray was comfortably incarcerated in the Richmond bridewell with O'Connell and other leaders from 30 May to 6 September, when the House of Lords acquitted all the accused.<br>
<br>In 1845 and 1846 O'Connell was increasingly challenged within the Repeal Association by William Smith O'Brien and the Young Irelanders. Ray strongly opposed the dissidents, rejecting <span class="italic">The Nation</span>'s defence of a healthy difference of opinion  (<span class="italic">The Nation</span>). As the chief promoter of repeal reading rooms, Ray was glad to see <span class="italic">The Nation</span> barred from them. When the Young Irelanders withdrew in opposition to O'Connell's condemnation of all violence in achieving reform, Ray dispatched sharp letters of exclusion. The Young Irelanders retaliated by demanding the removal of paid officials from repeal committee decisions.<br>
<br>Heart-broken by O'Connell's death in May 1847, Ray blamed Young Ireland: O'Connell's &#145;balmy nature could not endure the sting of ingratitude&#146;  (NL Ire., MS 22,482). He continued as Repeal Association secretary under John O'Connell. Like John O'Connell, whom he persuaded to delay his rejection, Ray remained aloof from the Irish League, intended to reunite Young Irelanders and repealers in July 1848. The unsuccessful rising by Smith O'Brien later that month ended negotiations. When John O'Connell tried to revive the Repeal Association in October 1849, Ray subscribed but remained inactive before the association's final collapse in 1850.<br>
<br>Ray's last years were spent mainly in the office of deeds, of which he was assistant registrar, 1865&#150;80. He was interested in the secretaryship of the Home Government Association in the early 1870s, but was politely rejected. He died at 5 Leinster Road, Rathmines, Dublin, on 5 January 1881 and was buried at Glasnevin cemetery two days later, mourned by his son, T. M. Ray junior. His wife, Mary, predeceased him in 1851, dying at the age of forty-nine. Their marriage was marred by the death of three children in infancy: Kate and Emma in 1839 and Jane in 1844.<br>
<br>Ray was responsible for many repeal reports. His most important publication was the <span class="italic">Report on the Irish Coercion Bill, the causes of discontent in Ireland, condition of the people, comparative criminality with England, remedial measures</span> (1846). According to Fergus O'Ferrall, the Repeal Association was the most sophisticated of O'Connell's organizations and &#145;Ray had it organised as a model of efficiency in different departments and committees&#146;  (O'Ferrall, 116).<br>
