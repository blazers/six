<span class="headword">Pynnar,  Nicholas</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1644?), <span class="occ">military engineer</span>, is of unknown parents and background. Nothing is known of his early life, but he fought in the Low Countries before arriving in Ireland in May 1600 as captain of a regiment of foot to serve as part of the Lough Foyle garrison. His company was disbanded in 1604 and he received a pension. In September 1606 he appears in Venice, probably on government business, and remained in Italy working as a military engineer before returning to London in December 1607. By May 1609 he was in Sweden with Irish troops raised to help the Swedes in their war with Poland, probably having been in Ireland to arrange the levying and transportation of the Irish forces. He was back in Ireland by 1611 to assist the plantation of Ulster and was granted 1000 acres in co. Cavan. However, he appears to have later sold his portion. The same year he appears as a tenant of Sir Richard Boyle in Munster. He left Ireland in 1612 for France and may also have gone again to Venice. <br>
<br>By March 1617 Pynnar had returned to Ireland. On 27 February 1618 he was appointed director-general and overseer of fortifications and buildings along with Sir Thomas Rotherham, and also became muster-master of the undertakers in Ulster and Connaught in the same year. From 1 December 1618 to 25 March 1619 he surveyed the progress of the plantation in the six counties of Armagh, Donegal, Tyrone, Cavan, Fermanagh, and Londonderry. He also executed surveys on the plantations in Longford, Ely O'Carroll, Leitrim, and King's and Queen's counties. During the early to mid-1620s he was active surveying, repairing, and designing military fortifications across the country. In 1630 he travelled to London to complain that his official salary had been cut off since 1624. Four years later the government agreed to pay him half his arrears (&pound;2000) in return for reducing his salary by half. Up to the late 1630s Pynnar was still engaged in various official surveys. He was appointed surveyor-general of the lands, plantations, and mines in 1643. He probably died in 1644.<br>
