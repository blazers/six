<span class="headword">Clayton,  Jack Isaac</span>  (1921&#150;1995), <span class="occ">film director</span>, was born on 1 March 1921 at 95 King's Road, Brighton, the only son of Beatrice Clayton, of independent means. Beatrice Clayton brought up her son and daughter Jill (1917&#150;1993) alone, with a succession of private tutors and much-beloved nannies. Jack Clayton went to the Arnold House School in London for one term, but he was academically almost totally unschooled. At the age of fifteen he entered the film industry, working first for Alexander Korda as a runner, and rising to become production manager on Korda's <span class="italic">An Ideal Husband</span> (1947) via such films as <span class="italic">Wings of the Morning</span> (1937) and <span class="italic">Q Planes</span> (1939). Only wartime service in the RAF film unit (where he made <span class="italic">Naples is a Battlefield</span>) interrupted his steadily growing reputation. On 13 December 1947 he married Mary Lydia Cole, the actress <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/107197/', "Christine Norden (1924&#150;1988)")</script>, who had appeared in <span class="italic">An Ideal Husband</span>.<br>
<br>In the early 1950s Clayton was invited to join John and James Woolf at Romulus Films as associate producer, and his films there included <span class="italic">I am a Camera</span> (1955), <span class="italic">Beat the Devil</span> (1953), and <span class="italic">Moulin Rouge</span> (1952). In the last of these he formed a lasting friendship and working relationship with John Huston, who in 1984 designated Clayton his successor on <span class="italic">Under the Volcano</span> should he die during the making of the film. Clayton was divorced from Christine Norden in 1953 and married a star of <span class="italic">Moulin Rouge</span>, Katherine Kath, in 1954. Other films made at this time included a trio of farces, <span class="italic">Sailor Beware</span> (1956), <span class="italic">Dry Rot</span> (1956), <span class="italic">Three Men in a Boat</span> (1956), and the melodrama <span class="italic">The Story of Esther Costello</span> (1957), with Joan Crawford. In 1956 he was able to persuade Romulus to finance his long-cherished dream: to direct Wolf Mankowitz's updated version of Gogol's <span class="italic">The Bespoke Overcoat</span>. This exquisite chamber work won a prize at Venice and an Oscar for the best short subject. His directorial d&eacute;but thus approved, Romulus offered him <span class="italic">Room at the Top</span>, John Braine's 1957 best-seller. Clayton was originally reluctant to accept Laurence Harvey as Joe Lampton, the male working-class lead, but eventually teamed him with the great French actress Simone Signoret as Alice Aisgill. He believed that Aisgill called for an actress of greater sensuality and sophistication than could be expected from a middle-aged English actress. <span class="italic">Room at the Top</span> (1959) was a sensation. Given the first X-rated certificate, it broke all kinds of film taboos, and was the first of the &#145;kitchen-sink&#146; style of films (successors included <span class="italic">Saturday Night and Sunday Morning</span>, 1960, and <span class="italic">This Sporting Life</span>, 1963). Clayton always disliked the &#145;kitchen-sink&#146; tag, and the range of his work shows how little it meant to him. Signoret won the best actress Oscar for her performance, and Clayton was nominated as best director, but lost out to William Wyler for <span class="italic">Ben Hur</span>. At an Oscar party, however, he found a greater prize when he met and fell in love with <span class="italic">Ben Hur</span>'s Esther, the luminous Israeli actress Haya Harareet (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Neuberg). They married on 29 August 1984, after Clayton's eventual divorce from Katherine Kath.<br>
<br>Always the consummate stylist and expressionist, Clayton embarked in 1961 on his next film, <span class="italic">The Innocents</span>, adapted from Henry James's novella <span class="italic">The Turn of the Screw</span>. This was a complete change of direction for Clayton, but was again distinguished by a commanding central performance from Deborah Kerr as the governess, and by the outstanding black and white photography from his old collaborator Freddie Francis (Clayton had fought ferociously to get him accepted as director of photography on <span class="italic">Room at the Top</span>). This was followed by <span class="italic">The Pumpkin Eater</span> (1964), Penelope Mortimer's book on the pains and pleasures of motherhood, adapted by Harold Pinter and with a consummate leading female performance by Anne Bancroft (with an impeccable English accent), and a small role for Maggie Smith as the local gossip. Clayton's themes&#151;the nonconformist facing the world, the richness and pain of life, and the search for happiness in a cruel world&#151;are present in all his films, be it <span class="italic">Our Mother's House</span> (1967) or <span class="italic">The Great Gatsby</span> (1974). Neither was a great commercial success, although Tennessee Williams once said of the latter that Clayton's film was better than Fitzgerald's book, but both displayed a mastery of style, tact, and unerring taste, as well as his ability to draw superb performances from his actors.<br>
<br>There followed ten lean years, much of which was spent recovering from a severe stroke. Clayton was never a fast worker, always taking great trouble to find the right subject matter; he was unencumbered by the demands of the merely fashionable or commercial, and sculpted the script painstakingly to his taste. He developed a number of subjects, including the story of Helena Rubinstein, but somehow all were aborted until he was asked by Disney to direct Ray Bradbury's <span class="italic">Something Wicked this Way Comes</span> (1983). Full of special effects&#151;never Clayton's forte&#151;it was quietly buried by its distributor, but has since become a cult film. His penultimate film was based on Brian Moore's book <span class="italic">The Lonely Passion of Judith Hearne</span> (1987). This compassionate study of an Irish spinster had long been a favourite subject of film-makers&#151;John Huston had once wanted to make it with Katharine Hepburn&#151;but it was probably too gloomy to reach a mass audience. Maggie Smith was superb in the central role and again it showed all Clayton's sensibilities, his mastery of camera technique, and his impeccable taste. His last film, made for the BBC, was Muriel Spark's <span class="italic">Memento mori</span> (1992), a rich brew of black humour and broad farce. Clayton's sympathy for the underdog, his narrative skills, and his idiosyncratic humour, structured around a compelling central performance, again by Maggie Smith, gave the film an unparalleled grace. Jack Clayton died in Wexham Park Hospital, Slough, on 25 February 1995.<br>
<br>Technicians and actors loved working with Clayton: he brought out the best in them, nurturing them all the way. His output was small and eclectic, and though he founded no school or genre of film-making, his craftsmanship and dedication to his material were absolute. <span class="italic">Room at the Top</span> assures his place in film history, although <span class="italic">The Bespoke Overcoat</span> remains his undisputed masterpiece&#151;but all his films show a restrained and dignified juiciness and absolute integrity. In Fred Zinnemann's words, he was &#145;a director's director, one of the most brilliant of his generation&#146;  (<span class="italic">Jack Clayton</span>).<br>
