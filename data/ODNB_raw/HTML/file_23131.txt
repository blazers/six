<span class="headword">Ranken,  George</span>  (1828&#150;1856), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was born in London on 4 January 1828, the eldest son of George Ranken of London. After education at private schools, in 1844 he passed into the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich. He was commissioned second-lieutenant, Royal Engineers, on 1 October 1847, and was promoted first-lieutenant on 29 December 1849. On 6 April 1850 Ranken embarked for Canada, arriving in Montreal early in May; he went to Quebec, returning to Montreal in March 1852. In July he took a prominent part in trying to extinguish the great fire at Montreal, when over 10,000 people were made homeless. In February and March 1853 Ranken travelled through the United States and to the West Indies. During the tour he made the acquaintance of W. M. Thackeray, who was lecturing, and travelled with him. Ranken's journal of his travels was edited by his brother, W. B. Ranken, and published as <span class="italic">Canada and the Crimea, or, Sketches of a Soldier's Life</span> (1862). In summer 1853 Ranken was again at Quebec, and during the cholera epidemic tried to mitigate the sufferings of the poor. He advocated in the local press the formation of a society to help distressed immigrants. In 1854 he distinguished himself in extinguishing the fire which destroyed the parliament buildings at Quebec, and received the thanks of the Canadian legislature for his role in saving the library of the Literary and Historical Society.<br>
<br>Ranken returned to England early in 1855, and was quartered at first in Edinburgh and then at Fort George, near Inverness. At this time he contributed letters, signed Delta, on military topics to the <span class="italic">Morning Post</span>. He urged increased pay for soldiers in the Crimea to induce the militia to volunteer for the line, a suggestion adopted by Lord Panmure. He proposed the formation, later carried out, of camps of instruction, and also the reorganization of the Royal Artillery and of the Royal Engineers.<br>
<br>While at Fort George, Ranken volunteered for active service, and was ordered to the Crimea, arriving at Balaklava on 12 August 1855. He served in the trenches. On 8 September the British assault on the Redan took place, with Ranken in the van. The assault, though unsuccessful, led later to Russian evacuation. On 10 September Ranken rode into Sevastopol to see the ruins of the burning city.<br>
<br>After the siege Ranken was placed in charge of the waterworks for the army. He was promoted second-captain on 25 September 1855 and brevet major on 2 November for distinguished service in the field. On 28 February 1856 he was accidentally killed while, under Lieutenant-Colonel Lloyd, demolishing the Korabelnaya barracks, Sevastopol, known as the White Buildings. General Codrington in his dispatch praised &#145;this excellent and gallant officer&#146;. Ranken was buried on 2 March 1856 at the Right Attack burial-ground of the Royal Engineers in the Crimea, where eleven of his fellow officers had been buried. A memorial window was placed in the church of Valcartier, north of Quebec, a church towards the building of which he had largely contributed, and a monument was erected in the cathedral of Quebec. Ranken was unmarried. He kept a journal when in the Crimea, from which extracts were selected by W. B. Ranken and published in 1857 as <span class="italic">Six Months at Sebastopol</span>.<br>
