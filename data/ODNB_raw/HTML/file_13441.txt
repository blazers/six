<span class="headword">Hodgson,  John Evan</span>  (1831&#150;1895), <span class="occ">genre painter</span>, was born in London on 1 March 1831, the eldest son of John Hodgson (<i>d</i>. 1856), a merchant trading with Russia. In 1835 his father and mother emigrated to St Petersburg. Initially he lived with them there, but about 1843 he returned to England to live with his uncle James Hodgson, the editor of the <span class="italic">Newcastle Chronicle</span>, in Newcastle upon Tyne. He was enrolled at Rugby School in 1846, and on completing his education there he went to work in his father's counting-house at St Petersburg. His study of old masters in the Hermitage collection and of Ruskin's <span class="italic">Modern Painters</span> persuaded him to abandon commerce for art, and in 1853 he returned to London and enrolled at the Royal Academy Schools. During the next few years he combined study there with extensive travel on the continent. Hodgson exhibited his first painting at the Royal Academy in 1856, the year his father died, and this was followed over the next ten years by further historical pictures. On 29 December 1857 he married Helen Elizabeth Todd, the daughter of another merchant.<br>
<br>Hodgson's early works were of two sorts: scenes of contemporary British and continental European life and depictions of colourful episodes from history. <span class="italic">The Arrest of the Poacher</span> (exh. RA, 1857) is an example of his contemporary genre painting, and <span class="italic">The Return of Francis Drake [from Cadiz], 1587</span> (exh. RA, 1862; Wolverhampton Art Gallery) is one of his historical scenes. In 1858 Hodgson and his wife settled at 5 Hill Road, St John's Wood, where they remained for the next thirty years. His depiction of scenes from Tudor and Stuart times, combined with residence in St John's Wood, led him to join the St John's Wood Clique, a group of young artists, of whom David Wynfield and W. F. Yeames were the early leaders, who shared an interest in historical genre painting. They met regularly both for recreation and to criticize each other's works. One winter, members of the clique decorated the walls of the painting-room at Hodgson's house with frescoes. The figures included portraits by P. H. Calderon of Hodgson and his wife in Elizabethan costume. Hodgson is also depicted in Elizabethan dress in Frederick Walker's cartoon <span class="italic">A Vision of the Clique</span> (1865; reproduced Marks, 1.90), indicating that he was then best known for his Elizabethan scenes.<br>
<br>Following his visit to north Africa in 1868, most of Hodgson's paintings in the following decade comprised scenes of north African life. J. F. Lewis had not, he argued, exhausted this subject. <span class="italic">The Arab Story-Teller</span> (exh. RA, 1869) and <span class="italic">The Snake Charmer</span> (exh. RA, 1872) are two of a long series of oriental pictures of life in Morocco, Algeria, and Tunis. Sometimes he depicted encounters between Europeans and north Africans: <span class="italic">East and West</span> (1883; Aberdeen Art Gallery and Museums) shows a meeting between Arabs and British sailors.<br>
<br>In the early 1870s Hodgson experimented with marine painting and in 1873 was elected an associate of the Royal Academy. On his election as Royal Academician in 1879 he submitted as his diploma work to the academy <span class="italic">A Shipwrecked Sailor Waiting for a Sail</span> (RA). After 1880 he returned to painting domestic scenes and also produced a number of portraits. <span class="italic">The Queen, God Bless her</span> (exh. RA, 1885; reproduced Wood, 245) depicts two soldiers drinking Queen Victoria's health in the middle of a desert landscape, combining the unswerving patriotism of Hodgson's early historical works with an exotic setting. A good scholar and linguist, Hodgson was appointed librarian and professor of painting at the Royal Academy in 1882. He gave the library a more varied character by purchasing for it the works of prominent poets and men of letters. With Fred Eaton, secretary of the Royal Academy, Hodgson wrote a history of the first sixty years of the academy, contributing biographies of its early members. This work first appeared in article form in the <span class="italic">Art Journal</span> and was published as a book after his death. His <span class="italic">Fifty Years of British Art</span> was published to coincide with the Manchester exhibition in 1887.<br>
<br>Unlike his history of the Royal Academy, Hodgson's paintings were little valued during his later years. In particular critics regarded his north African scenes as well executed but lacking in originality. In 1890 he moved to the village of Coleshill, near Amersham, Buckinghamshire, where he died at his home, The Larches, on 19 June 1895; his wife survived him.<br>
