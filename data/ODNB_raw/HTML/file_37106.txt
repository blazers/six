<span class="headword">Alford,  Edward</span>  (1565/6&#150;1631/2), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born in London the only surviving son of Roger Alford (<i>d</i>. 1580) and his wife, Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1598), daughter and heir of Thomas Ramsey, esquire, of London and Hitcham, Buckinghamshire, and widow of Nicholas Clerke of North Weston, Oxfordshire. The Alfords were Sussex gentry who traced their origins back to Richard, lord of Aldford, Cheshire, who held Newton manor in Sussex in 1200; another ancestor fought at Agincourt. Edward's direct line came into the county in the fifteenth century. His grandfather, Robert Alford (<i>d</i>. 1546), married Anne Brydges, a member of the prominent Gloucestershire and Somerset family, while his father made the transition from the local to the national stage as secretary to Sir William Cecil and as MP (for Bletchingley, Surrey, in 1558 and for Preston, Sussex, in 1559). Roger's brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37107/', "Sir Francis Alford")</script>, was also an MP in Elizabeth's parliaments.<br>
<br>In his will Roger Alford left instructions for Edward to pursue his studies at Oxford and Lincoln's Inn, and to seek service in Cecil's entourage thereafter. Alford duly matriculated at Trinity College, Oxford, in 1581, aged fifteen, and subsequently entered Lincoln's Inn in 1583. He did not enter government service, but the durability of the Cecil connection was suggested in 1610 when the earl of Salisbury, the son of his father's patron, included him among a &#145;select number&#146; of MPs with whom he had a private meeting about the levying of impositions, customs duties imposed under the royal prerogative  (Foster, <span class="italic">Proceedings</span>, 2.274n.).<br>
<br>On 11 April 1589 Alford married Judith Downing of Suffolk, with whom he had six sons and a daughter. He sat for Beverley, Yorkshire, in the parliament of 1593, and though no record of his activity in it has survived, he harked back to his service under Elizabeth in later years. He served in no other Elizabethan parliament, however, and his effective career began in 1604 with his election for Colchester, Essex, which he represented in the four succeeding parliaments of 1614, 1621, 1624, and 1625 as well. Alford faithfully reflected the interests of the town corporation which controlled the parliamentary franchise, advancing bills for it in 1621 and 1624, but by the session of 1606&#150;7 he was also the acknowledged leader of the delegation from Sussex where his seat at Offington, near Worthing, lay.<br>
<br>Alford soon adopted a third constituency, parliament itself. Throughout his long career, few MPs were as consistent in their defence of the privileges and autonomy of the House of Commons, and none stouter. In 1610 it was Alford's initiative which secured the ruling that all matters concerning the privileges of the Commons should be perused by the committee for privileges before being entered in the journal of the house. In 1607 he brandished a precedent for expelling a privy councillor who had revealed matters before the house to the king, and in 1621 he rebuked James I for interfering in another pending issue, complaining that there were &#145;Eyes over him to observe&#146;  (Tyrwhitt, 1.32). That same year he claimed for the house the right to adjourn itself on its own authority, and in 1628 he protested against the forced Easter sitting of parliament as an infringement of its liberty. In 1624 he objected strenuously when the Lords debated supply and in 1628 he opposed their admitting the testimony of judges. Royal councillors in the House of Commons had traditionally set the legislative agenda, but in 1625 Alford opposed having the solicitor-general, Sir Robert Heath, chair a committee &#145;because he was sworn to the King and of his fee&#146;  (Jansson and Bidwell, 234). Similarly he objected to the speaker's attending the presentation of the petition on billeting to Charles I in 1628; he had been sharply critical of what he regarded as a previous speaker's obsequious deportment at a conference with the Lords in 1621. At the end of the first session in 1621 he urged that a committee be set up to maintain parliamentary privileges during the summer recess, and when sittings resumed in the autumn he protested the detention of his fellow MP, Sir Edwin Sandys. In 1624 he moved a bill for the preservation of parliament's liberties, and tried to attach a rider to the subsidy bill providing that parliament should meet after adjournment &#145;at a specified time&#146;.<br>
<br>Alford was equally vigilant against other extensions of royal prerogative, including impositions, monopolies, proclamations, and purveyances, both as abuses in themselves and as encroachments on local commerce and governance. After joining the general parliamentary attack on increased customs rates in 1610 and 1614, he blamed them for the trade depression in 1621 and sought to have them added as grievances to the petition of right. Proclamations were another source of evil. Alford attacked the Lenten proclamation against killing meat in 1621 as a prime example of government meddling that raised the price of victuals for the poor in a time of dearth, and he continued to complain of Star Chamber prosecutions for violations of similar decrees in 1624 and 1628. That proclamations were typically enforced in prerogative courts such as Star Chamber suggested to him a sinister pattern in which conciliar decrees bypassed both statutes and the subject's redress at the common law. Particularly obnoxious among proclamations were those for patents of monopoly, which Alford saw as conspiracies to enrich London-based trading companies such as the Merchant Adventurers at the expense of the outports of the southern coast, and particularly abusive among courts was that of chancery, a perennial target of common lawyers. In 1621 Alford introduced a seventeen-point bill to halve the number of masters of chancery, curb their powers, and appoint two common-law &#145;judges assistant&#146; to oversee them. In addition he proposed to erect a new court of appeal empowered to reverse chancery decrees by writ of error. In 1624 he spoke to no fewer than eight bills concerning chancery, enjoining the house to consider them &#145;with as much expedition as may be&#146;.<br>
<br>Alford stubbornly resisted the drift to war in the parliaments of 1624 and 1625, and characteristically opposed grants of subsidy. Along with other dissidents he was pricked for sheriff to disable him from sitting in parliament in 1626, but, although removed from the bench, he retained the position of deputy lieutenant for Sussex, probably through the influence of the earls of Arundel and Dorset, and remained a receiver of admiralty droits. His return to parliament in 1628 was marred by a disputed election, and despite the support of the Colchester corporation he was forced to accept a seat at Steyning, Sussex. Alford's service in this, his last parliament, was perhaps his most significant. Rejecting a mere confirmation of <span class="roman">Magna Carta</span> in the dispute with Charles over the forced loan and billeting, he proposed to proceed by petition of right on 6 May and to incorporate the king's response as a preamble to the subsidy bill, thus firmly tying redress of grievances to supply. Alert to the symbolic significance of the moment, he proposed that Charles receive the petition in parliament rather than at Whitehall. The house did not immediately pick up his suggestion, but as reformulated by Sir Edward Coke it became the basis of the most important affirmation of personal liberty yet made by an English parliament.<br>
<br>Alford, who had so often clashed with councillors from Sir Francis Bacon to Sir Robert Heath, sounded a rare and perhaps valedictory note of conciliation at the end of the session: &#145;I hope we may recede and find a better world at our next meeting&#146;  (Johnson and others, 4.320). Such a hope proved forlorn, and after the dissolution of parliament in March 1629 he retired to his estate at Offington. His last recorded parliamentary address was another protest against the imprisonment of a fellow MP. Alford died, probably at Offington, late in 1631 or early the following year (his will was proved on 26 January 1632). He was buried in the chancel of Hamsey church near Lewes, where he owned a manor. Two of his sons, Sir Edward (1592&#150;1653), knighted 1632, and John (1590&#150;1649), sat in parliament; the former was heavily fined for his service in the king's cause during the civil war. Alford's other sons were Henry, Lancelot, Robert, and William; the last-named became vicar of Purton, Wiltshire. Alford's daughter Elizabeth was an executor of his will.<br>
<br>Alford was the quintessential county back-bencher of his era. His core views were conservative and insular, and his resistance to the extension of prerogative government, from the <span class="roman">Act of Union</span> to the forced loan, was principled and unremitting. He believed in a balanced polity, and although he had no wish to magnify parliament's powers as such, he came to see them as the last bulwark of a system whose co-ordinate institutions had become increasingly impotent in the face of royal pressure. It was parliament, then, that by curbing prerogative courts and conciliar lawmaking, by asserting its privileges to defend the subject's liberties, by reining in government spending and rejecting all non-parliamentary taxation, and by functioning generally as the watchdog of the realm, would preserve the constitution. Such a view was to animate the Long Parliament in its first great spate of reform. No one articulated it more clearly, consistently, and fearlessly in the decades before 1640 than Edward Alford.<br>
