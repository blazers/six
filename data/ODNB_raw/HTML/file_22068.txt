<span class="headword">Pettus, Sir  John</span>  (<em>c.</em>1613&#150;1685), <span class="occ">natural philosopher and politician</span>, was the second son of Sir Augustine Pettus (<i>d</i>. 1613) of Rackheath, Norfolk, and his second wife, Abigail (1592&#150;1673), third daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/47134/', "Sir Arthur Heveningham")</script> of Ketteringham in the same county. In 1632 he matriculated as a fellow-commoner at Pembroke College, Cambridge, where his tutor was Thomas Boswell. He probably attended the college from about 1627 and may have graduated BA in 1631. When he was seventeen Pettus undertook the first of three summer tours around England in the company of Sir Thomas Bendish. Each tour lasted two months and they continued until he left Cambridge. They were designed to give Pettus a wide knowledge of England before he travelled on the continent, and the first included a visit to a lead mine in Derbyshire. Pettus was admitted to Lincoln's Inn on 13 May 1635. In 1637 he married Elizabeth, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/11772/', "Sir Richard Gurney")</script> of Cheapside, London, who became lord mayor in 1641&#150;2, and his wife, Ebigail, daughter of Henry Sandford of Birchington, Kent. John's and Elizabeth's only son, Richard, died in 1662. Their daughter, Elizabeth, married Samuel Sandys, son of Samuel Sandys of Ombersley, Worcestershire, and his wife, Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Barker, in 1657. Elizabeth Sandys died on 25 May 1714 aged seventy-four.<br>
<br>Pettus entered the service of Charles I in 1639, and was knighted on 25 November 1641 as a mark of the king's favour to Gurney. In March 1643 he was among those captured by Oliver Cromwell's forces at Lowestoft, suspected of trying to fortify the town for the king. Pettus reportedly told Cromwell of his intention of joining the royalists. He was first imprisoned at Cambridge before being transferred to unpleasantly overcrowded quarters in Windsor Castle. He was released on an exchange early in 1644 and then served in Oxford, Bath, and Bristol. He and his wife were in Bristol at the surrender of the city to the New Model Army in September 1645, when they were helped by Charles Fleetwood, who was related to Pettus by marriage. The fine for Pettus's delinquency was first set at &pound;1300, but was later reduced to &pound;866 13<i>s</i>. 4<i>d</i>., one-tenth the value of his estate. He was also involved in settling the estate of Sir Richard Gurney, who died in October 1647, in conjunction with Thomas Richardson, later Baron of Cramond, who had married Gurney's other daughter, Anne.<br>
<br>Pettus was imprisoned in 1650 on suspicion of corresponding with Charles II, being questioned by the council of state over a period of three weeks before being released on bail of &pound;4000. Presumably this was when he felt that his life had been in danger and he had again been indebted to Fleetwood for intervening on his behalf. He also acknowledged Fleetwood's help with preserving his estates and in protecting him from being required to take oaths and renunciations. In 1656 he protested to the lord protector of his loyalty to the regime, but after the fall of the protectorate he was approached in 1659 by Francis Finch, an ironmonger, to act as an intermediary between the royalists and Fleetwood.<br>
<br>Pettus's wife left him in 1657, taking some of his possessions, including jewels which he valued at &pound;900. He attributed her action to her conversion to Roman Catholicism. A reconciliation in 1662, when she restored his jewels and he paid her debts, which totalled more than &pound;800, did not long outlast the death of their son in that year. She left Pettus once more in 1662, again taking possessions with her, including pictures, books, and &#145;rarities&#146;, and entered a nunnery abroad. Although she returned to England after five years they were not reconciled, and disputes over her alimony led to his excommunication and an appearance before the privy council in 1672, when the king personally ordered him to pay &pound;2 per week. The case was brought before the privy council again in 1673 and 1674. In 1674 Pettus published a justification, <span class="italic">A Narrative of the Excommunication of Sir John Pettus</span>.<br>
<br>Pettus's interest in metallurgy and mining led to him becoming a member of the Society of Mines Royal and Battery Works in 1651 and he acted as deputy governor of the royal mines from then until his death, apart from one brief interval. He was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1663. He published, in 1670, <span class="italic">Fodinae regales, or, The history, laws and places of the chief mines and mineral works in England, Wales and the English pale in Ireland</span> and, in 1683, <span class="italic">Fleta minor: the laws of art and nature, in knowing, judging, assaying, fining, refining and inlarging the bodies of confin'd metals</span>. The latter consists of a translation of a sixteenth-century work in German by Lazarus Erckern, with a dictionary of metallurgical terms by Pettus.<br>
<br>Pettus was chosen as MP for Dunwich at a by-election in March 1670. He was named to 109 committees of the Cavalier Parliament and was listed as a member of the court party. He made four attempts to obtain a bill regulating charitable stock in the parish of Kelsale, Suffolk, and also presented a bill for settling the estate of Henry Smith, for whom Sir Richard Gurney had acted as executor. <span class="italic">The Case and Justification of Sr J. Pettus</span> (1678) was his defence against claims that he was introducing needless bills and disturbing charities which were functioning satisfactorily. He was blacklisted in the &#145;unanimous club&#146; of court supporters and did not seek re-election after the dissolution of the Cavalier Parliament.<br>
<br>Pettus was involved in affairs in East Anglia, visiting Norwich after the explosion of the magazine there in 1648 and providing for the prisoners taken during the Third Anglo-Dutch War in 1672, in his capacity as deputy to the vice-admiral, as well as mediating between the military and the inhabitants. He was a JP for Suffolk from July 1660 until his death, and deputy lieutenant from 1671. He held the rank of captain of the foot in the militia by 1665 and was a colonel from 1671. Pettus was made a freeman of Dunwich in 1670 and served as bailiff in 1671&#150;2 and 1675&#150;6, and as coroner in 1677&#150;8. He was made a gentleman of the privy chamber in 1670 and retained the position until his death.<br>
<br>Pettus succeeded his grandfather as tenant of land in South Walsham, Norfolk, and before his marriage he bought the manor of Chediston, Suffolk. He used his wife's jointure to acquire the manor of Winbaston and a nearby farm, also in Suffolk, but sold them in the late 1640s to pay his composition fine and debts incurred during the civil war. At the Restoration he claimed that he had lost &pound;25,000 in the royal service and in 1674 that he had not been paid by Charles I or Charles II. His debts were reported at &pound;5960 in 1651 and in 1674 he wrote that he had discharged debts of &pound;28,000 since about 1664. His circumstances were exacerbated by the dispute with his wife and his finances continued to deteriorate. In 1679 he was in a debtors' prison and appealed to William Sancroft, archbishop of Canterbury, for a loan of &pound;20 to release him. He was in the Fleet prison for debt in 1683, hence the punning title of <span class="italic">Fleta minor</span>.<br>
<br>Pettus's other publications were <span class="italic">Volatiles from the History of Adam and Eve</span> (1674) and <span class="italic">The Constitution of Parliaments in England</span> (1680), and he contributed a preface to <span class="italic">England's Independency upon the Papal Power</span> by Sir John Davis and Sir Edward Coke (1674). The attribution to Pettus of <span class="italic">St Foine Improved</span> (1674) is doubtful. He died in 1685 and was buried in the Temple Church in London on 12 July. A portrait of him, aged fifty-seven, engraved by W. Sherwin, is the frontispiece of <span class="italic">Fodinae regales</span> and another of him, aged seventy, engraved by R. White, is the frontispiece to <span class="italic">Fleta minor</span>.<br>
