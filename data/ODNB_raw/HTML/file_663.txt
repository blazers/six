<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Armstrong,  John</span>  (1813&#150;1856), <span class="occ">bishop of Grahamstown</span>, was born on 22 August 1813 at Bishopwearmouth, the second child and eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/662/', "Dr John Armstrong (1784&#150;1829)")</script>, physician, and his wife, Sarah (<i>d</i>. 1837), daughter of Charles Spearman of Thornley in co. Durham. He was educated at a preparatory school in Hanwell under Dr Bond. In 1827 he was sent to Charterhouse School, and in 1832 obtained a Crewe exhibition at Lincoln College, Oxford. He graduated in 1836 with a third-class honours degree in classics, and was ordained in the Church of England in 1837.<br>
<br>Armstrong's first curacy, at Alford, in Somerset, lasted just four months owing to his physical frailty (he had suffered greatly from rheumatism in childhood); a curacy at Wootton-Fitzpaine, in Dorset, was similarly short-lived, and after declining a chaplaincy with the East India Company he accepted a curacy at Clifton, staying until 1841. In that year he became a priest-vicar of Exeter Cathedral, and in 1843 he became, in plurality, rector of St Paul's, Exeter, which lay in the patronage of the dean and chapter. Also in 1843, on 22 February, he married Frances Whitmore (<i>d</i>. 1908), daughter of Edward Whitmore, and they lived in St Paul's parish. Among their children was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30448/', "Edward Armstrong")</script>, historian and college administrator. Armstrong was a quiet, retiring man who avoided society, but was a gifted preacher: &#145;the best all round country congregation preacher I ever knew&#146;, according to a clerical contemporary  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>). He pursued his pastoral ministry conscientiously: perhaps because of his own poor health, he had a particular sensitivity towards the sick, frail, and vulnerable. During this time Armstrong's personal faith and spirituality were strengthened by the <span class="roman">Tracts for the Times</span>, the influence of the Oxford Movement and other high-church elements having reached Exeter. But not everyone approved of this, and elsewhere in the city the wearing of the surplice provoked rioting. Armstrong began the practice at St Paul's with minimal controversy.<br>
<br>In 1845 Armstrong exchanged livings with the vicar of Tidenham, in Gloucestershire. There he began each day with morning prayer in the parish church, followed by teaching in the school and receiving parishioners; parish visiting occupied the afternoons, often continuing until after dark. His predecessor had provoked controversy by attempting to introduce changes in the church services, namely daily morning prayer, holy communion each Sunday and festival, and the introduction of the offertory, but Armstrong, while not yielding to the opposing faction, gradually won people over to these new religious usages by a combination of gentleness, firm perseverance, and careful instruction. From 1845 to 1854 he published a number of volumes of sermons and collections of religious tracts arranged thematically for the Christian year, of which the most notable were: <span class="italic">The Pastor in his Closet</span> (1847), <span class="italic">Sermons on the Festivals</span> (1845), <span class="italic">Tracts for the Christian Seasons</span> (1848&#150;9, 1849&#150;50), <span class="italic">Sermons for the Christian Seasons</span> (1852&#150;3), <span class="italic">Tracts for Parochial Use</span> (1852&#150;3), and <span class="italic">Parochial Sermons</span> (1854). These proved very popular, and he used the revenue to build and maintain several schools in the parish of Tidenham. A devoted family man, Armstrong loved to have his children around him even when writing his sermons. It was therefore a great loss to both himself and his wife when one of their children, an eighteen-day-old baby, died in August 1848.<br>
<br>While at Tidenham Armstrong began his pioneering work in the church penitentiary movement. Just as the evangelical revival had awakened a strong social conscience among its adherents a generation earlier, so too the Tractarians were similarly stirred as the new revival reached beyond the university into the parishes. The plight of the poor, both spiritual and material, was perceived as a priority. But there was one category for whom, in the 1840s, the church made no provision&#151;women and girls from abused backgrounds; those from broken families; unmarried mothers; and prostitutes. These were classed by Victorian society as &#145;fallen women&#146;, a term which both reflected contemporary attitudes towards sex, and also summed up the plight of women caught in a downward spiral whereby their place in society, however lowly, was irretrievably lost. But in time, this second meaning was forgotten, and &#145;fallen woman&#146; became a term of derision.<br>
<br>Through a series of articles in journals such as the <span class="italic">Quarterly Review</span> (September 1848), <span class="italic">Christian Remembrancer</span> (January 1849), <span class="italic">English Review</span> (March 1849), and a lengthy tract entitled <span class="italic">An Appeal for the Formation of a Church Penitentiary</span> (February 1849), John Armstrong became the champion of the church penitentiary cause. In the larger cities there were a number of secular penitentiaries, but (except for the Magdalen Hospital, founded in 1758, which was now largely in secular hands) there was nothing run by the church. He believed the work should be run on religious principles, by ladies organized into sisterhoods, and directed by clergymen. The rescued women would be rehabilitated, trained as servants so they would have a livelihood, and would receive religious instruction leading to confirmation. Armstrong envisaged a two-tier system&#151;houses of refuge in the cities where women would be received first of all; and larger houses of mercy in the country where they would go for training. Armstrong was also mindful of the role of men and wrote forthrightly of the need for &#145;restitution&#146;. Such a scheme as he envisaged required money; Armstrong forced his male readers to recall their misspent youth and to support his plan in a pecuniary manner as an act of penitence. Many men in public life responded, including more than one bishop. Besides his major writings on the subject, Armstrong also wrote letters to the newspapers and had lengthy correspondence with clergymen such as his close friend and biographer Thomas Thellusson Carter, rector of Clewer, near Windsor. In this way public interest was aroused and a number of houses of mercy were established, run by ladies organized into sisterhoods. Armstrong was closely associated with founding the house of mercy at Bussage, Gloucestershire, and his philosophy of rescue work influenced all the pioneering efforts, notably that of Carter and his associates at Clewer. Armstrong was also closely involved with the establishment of the Church Penitentiary Association in 1852.<br>
<br>In 1853 Armstrong accepted the appointment, partly secured through the influence of Bishop Robert Gray of Cape Town, as first bishop of Grahamstown, in South Africa. He was consecrated at Lambeth on St Andrew's day (30 November). Although his diocese was as large as England, he was determined to be a missionary bishop and not merely an administrator. His arrival and welcome at Cape Town on St Michael's day (29 September) 1854 was soon overshadowed by the death of Ruth, his youngest child, on the journey from Port Elizabeth to Grahamstown on 13 December 1854. At Port Elizabeth he had found considerable strife regarding ritual, reminiscent of his earlier experiences at Exeter and Tidenham. The opposing faction had split away from the main congregation and appealed to Gray for support; neither he nor Armstrong was willing to concede, because all was being performed in accordance with the rubrics of the prayer book.<br>
<br>These early troubles, and the fact that Armstrong was already a sick man on arrival in South Africa, did not deter him from visiting all parts of his diocese. His <span class="italic">Notes in South Africa</span> graphically describes these journeys, which he found both taxing physically and spiritually uplifting. Thus he was able to visit the first mission to the Xhosa people near the kraal of Chief Umhalla; also to repay a courtesy visit from Chief Kama, who had been converted by the Wesleyan missionaries; and he preached and confirmed in many places. Armstrong was usually accompanied by his wife and children, who shared the hardships of travelling over rough terrain by wagon, sleeping in or under it at night, and being deprived of fresh food and water.<br>
<br>Missionary endeavour in South Africa was inevitably caught up with England's imperial ambitions, and has to a large extent been discredited in a post-imperial culture. Many of Armstrong's confirmations were held in English forts, established as garrisons against both African and Boer, and there are references in the bishop's writings to mounted police guarding the borders and military escorts for his entourage. A bloody campaign against the Xhosa had been waged by the British from 1850 to 1853, the latest in a number which aimed to disinherit the Xhosa from their own land. Inevitably, Armstrong was caught up in the imperial ideal, but at that juncture it was still possible for a missionary to be detached from political intrigue. The sense of loneliness and remoteness of those missionaries under Armstrong's pastoral care is clearly conveyed in his written account, together with the genuine trust and rapport which he built up with the indigenous Africans.<br>
<br>By the end of 1855, after much extensive travelling, Armstrong's health was almost at breaking point. At Uitenhage he attempted to resolve a clerical dispute, but was met with severe resistance and was forced to withdraw a clergyman's licence; this action was subject to misunderstanding and was still unresolved when Armstrong died. He also founded a non-denominational literary institute and reading-room for artisans in Grahamstown, amid widespread disapproval, and was responsible for the building of Bishopsbourne as the episcopal residence. Despite severe influenza, Armstrong set out early in 1856 on another visitation tour which further taxed his strength. Sweltering heat, heavy rain, nausea from travelling by cart, and stressful pastoral encounters all contributed to his final breakdown of health and strength. He died at Grahamstown on 16 May 1856 in the presence of his wife, children, and close friends, after collapsing a fortnight previously. He was buried four days later in the cemetery at Grahamstown in the rochet made for him by the inmates of the Bussage house of mercy. A memorial chapel commemorating both Armstrong and his daughter Ruth was later built over his grave.<br>
<br>John Armstrong was a gentle, pastoral man, whose deep convictions were never imposed on those in his care, but who won people over by example. His lack of academic expertise was compensated by his strong spirituality, which informed his preaching and made his thought widely accessible. His episcopacy was short, but he brought to it the qualities which had marked out his ministry as a parish priest&#151;a deep concern for social justice and a commitment to education. This latter was especially apparent in Grahamstown, with his championing of the artisans' institute, and in the founding of St Andrew's College, Grahamstown (1855), and St Matthew's College, Keiskama Hoek. J. H. Overton, Armstrong's biographer in the <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span>, concluded that &#145;few men, without possessing any commanding genius or incurring any unpopularity, have done more thoroughly useful work for the church and for society at large&#146;.<br>
