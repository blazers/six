<span class="headword">Abrahams,  Louis Barnett</span>  (1839&#150;1918), <span class="occ">headmaster</span>, was born on 3 October 1839 at Swansea, the son of Barnett Abrahams (1785&#150;1868) and his second wife, Hannah (<i>fl</i>. 1820&#150;1868), the daughter of Locabel Levy of Lissa, Poland. There was also one daughter of this marriage. His father took the position of <i>chazan</i>, or synagogue cantor, in the Jewish congregation of Manchester in 1845.<br>
<br>Abrahams received his early education at the Hebrew School of the Manchester congregation, but suffered a breakdown in health and was sent to live with his uncle, Rabbi Aaron, a rabbinic judge (<i>dayan</i>) of the London Ashkenazi community. He entered the Jews' Free School, situated in Bell Lane, Whitechapel, as a pupil, and was taken on probation in 1854 as a pupil teacher by the headmaster, Moses Angel. Awarded the degree of BA by the University of London in 1863, he qualified by 1864 as a certified assistant teacher. He was singled out by being given charge of the seventh standard, which he taught for the next twenty years. Abrahams married on 11 February 1869 Fannie Rosetta (<i>b</i>. 1848), eldest daughter of Ephraim Mosely. A son and daughter were born in 1870 and 1871 respectively at 77 Tavistock Crescent, London.<br>
<br>In 1869 the committee of the council on education raised his teacher's certificate, unusually, from the fourth degree to the first class of the third degree. By 1870 he was head of English at the Jews' Free School. In 1874, after graduating with honours from the Tonic Sol-Fa College, he was appointed superintendent of musical studies, and introduced the teaching of singing into the school. Abrahams was elected vice-master in 1884 with the practical management of the school in his hands. In 1897 he became headmaster on the retirement of Moses Angel, under the rules of the London county council, into whose control the school had passed.<br>
<br>From 1884 onwards the effects were felt at the school of the influx of Russian Jews. Most of the children were unable to speak English. Although endeavouring to preserve a Jewish atmosphere at the school, Abrahams was opposed to the use of Yiddish, feeling it was a barrier to integration. The Anglicization of the pupils became in his eyes even more important as a bulwark against antisemitism. Abrahams instituted the first uniformed cadet corps to be introduced inside an elementary school and established a corps of the Jewish Lads' Brigade. A gymnasium was erected, swimming baths were started, and sports organized. With the erection of the Rothschild wing in 1897, he was able to supervise a technical school.<br>
<br>Abrahams required all his pupil teachers to enter training college. His difficulties increased after the passing of the <span class="roman">Education Acts</span> of 1902&#150;3, as these involved a loss of independence and an increasing reliance on government funding. He also had to deal with a group of trade-union-orientated teachers. Despite his administrative duties, he nevertheless found time to compile a manual of scripture history for school use. As well as translating a Jewish prayer book into English, he composed a chronological history of England for his pupils.<br>
<br>Louis Barnett Abrahams retired in 1907, having served the Jews' Free School for nearly fifty-four years and seen it grow into the largest elementary school in the country. He was presented with his portrait, which still hangs in the school. As well as his pioneering work at the school he acted as the first editor of the <span class="italic">Jewish Record</span> in 1868. He also served as honorary secretary of the Jewish Religious Education Board at its foundation, treasurer of the Jewish branch of the Happy Evening Society, vice-president of the League of Mercy, and as a member of the Maccabean Physical Training Committee. Abrahams retired to Westcliff-on-Sea and became honorary president of the synagogue, finally settling at The Retreat, Portland Road, Hove, where he died on 3 June 1918, survived by his wife.<br>
