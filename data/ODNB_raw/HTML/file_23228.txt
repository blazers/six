<span class="headword">Rede <span class="st"> [Reade]</span>,  Robert</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1415), <span class="occ">bishop of Chichester</span>, was a Dominican friar, probably of the house at Langley, Hertfordshire, much favoured by Richard II, to which the bishop would make extensive bequests. The house at Hereford was also singled out particularly in the bishop's will, but so too on a smaller scale were many other houses, perhaps suggesting that Rede achieved an office embracing the whole province of the order at some time. His brother, William, was in turn archdeacon, chancellor, and treasurer of Chichester, all in his own gift. One Thomas Rede had a small bequest. Of most interest, he identified his distinguished predecessor at Chichester, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/23248/', "Bishop William Rede")</script>, as a kinsman, and asked to be buried at his feet.<br>
<br>Rede was a doctor of theology. It is not known where he studied, even though Bishop William had made such a mark at Merton College, Oxford. He also had collections of civil- and canon-law books. His public career is very obscure, but possibly he had a longer and closer connection with Richard II's court than is apparent. On 9 September 1394, for example, he was papally provided to the see of Lismore and Waterford, and accompanied Richard II on his expedition to Ireland in that year. On 26 January 1396 he was translated at the king's request to the see of Carlisle, overriding the election of William Strickland; he obtained the temporalities on 30 March, with retrospective effect from the beginning of the vacancy, usually a sign of personal royal favour. However, on 5 October 1396 he was translated once more, to Chichester, with the temporalities restored on 6 March. This was a somewhat wealthier see, and if Rede did also have some personal affection for it through his predecessor, the move is understandable. He certainly managed to spend long periods of time there, even though he was a frequent attender at Richard II's court, and on the council of regency the king left behind when he went to Ireland again in 1399.<br>
<br>The revolution of September 1399 did not incite the public and popular animosity against Rede that it did against other ecclesiastical associates of the late king, but it made him an entirely resident diocesan, mainly at Amberley and Drungewick. In April 1400 Archbishop Arundel reproached him sharply for having ceased to wear a friar's habit. Rede apologized. In January 1401 he sent proctors to convocation, pleading serious ill health and other obstacles. He attended parliaments fairly regularly in the following years, but had no active role in government. He was on bad terms with the cathedral chapter, upon whom he imposed critical visitations as often as canon law allowed, but such friction was not unusual at Chichester. From November 1412 Rede was entirely at Aldingbourne, perhaps in declining health. He made his will on 10 August 1414 and died the following year, before 21 June, having asked to be buried before the altar in the choir of the cathedral, at the feet of Bishop William Rede.<br>
