<span class="headword">Ward,  William</span>  (1787&#150;1849), <span class="occ">cricketer and banker</span>, was born at Highbury Place, Highbury, Middlesex, in July 1787, the second son of George Ward (<i>d</i>. 1829), of Northwood Park, Cowes, a London merchant and large-scale landowner in the Isle of Wight and Hampshire, and his wife, Mary (<i>d</i>. 1813), daughter of Henry Sampson Woodfall. Robert Plumer Ward was William's uncle.<br>
<br>Ward was educated at Winchester College. He was destined for commerce, and spent some time at Antwerp in a banking house. On his return, his father took him into partnership in 1810. On 26 April 1811 he married Emily (<i>d</i>. 1848), fifth daughter of Alderman Harvey Christian Combe, a prosperous brewer and radical London politician. They had two daughters and four sons, one of whom was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28713/', "William George Ward")</script>, a prominent Roman Catholic theologian and philosopher.<br>
<br>In 1817 Ward was elected a director of the Bank of England, and distinguished himself by his accurate knowledge of foreign exchanges. In 1819 he gave evidence before the parliamentary committees on the restrictions on payments in cash by the Bank of England. However, from his early days as a director Ward was critical of the bank's singular lack of general plans. And on 6 December 1827 he moved and carried a measure rescinding its policy of reducing its issues so as to obtain a favourable return in the exchanges. Telling the story in 1832, Ward noted that when the bank had been most at fault it had also been &#145;most in accordance with the Government and the Parliament and the Public at large&#146;  (Clapham, 117).<br>
<br>On 9 June 1826 Ward was elected for the City of London as a conservative MP, and in 1830 at the request of the duke of Wellington, he acted as chairman of the committee appointed to investigate the affairs of the East India Company preparatory to the opening of the China trade. In 1831, discontented at the spirit of reform, he declined to stand for parliament. In 1835 he presented himself as a candidate, and was defeated by the whigs. From about that period he retired from public life. In 1847 he published <span class="italic">Remarks on the Monetary Legislation of Great Britain</span>, in which he condemned the act of 1816 establishing an exclusive gold standard, and called for a bimetallic currency.<br>
<br>In addition to his career in the City of London, Ward was a prominent cricketer, and a patron of the sport. Probably the most powerful batsman of his day, he made a record 278 at Lord's on 24 July 1820 for the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) against Norfolk. A &#145;gentleman&#146; rather than a &#145;player&#146;, he was one of those described by Mary Russell Mitford in 1823 in <span class="italic">Our Village</span> as playing &#145;dressed in tight white jackets with neck cloths primly tied around their throats, fine japanned shoes, silk stockings and gloves&#146;  (Lewis, 59).<br>
<br>Ward's greatest contribution to the sport, however, was to save the Lord's ground from the building speculation planned by Thomas Lord. In return for &pound;5000, Ward acquired the lease in 1825. Together with its honorary secretary Benjamin Aislabie, he was one of the dominant figures in the club during the subsequent decade.<br>
<br>In 1835, around the time of his parliamentary defeat, Ward appears to have suffered &#145;a reversal of fortune&#146;, during which he was assisted by his brother Matthew  (Harris and Ashley-Cooper, 49). For whatever reason, in that year Ward transferred the lease to J. H. Dark for &pound;2000. The latter also undertook to pay an annuity of &pound;425 to the Ward family during the remaining fifty-nine years of the lease. Despite ceasing to be proprietor, Ward continued to play occasionally until 1845.<br>
<br>Ward died on 30 June 1849 at 14 Wyndham Place, London. In his will he left a number of cricketing memorabilia to his children, including his &#145;only remaining cricket bat and balls&#146; to his daughter Georgiana Mary  (Harris and Ashley-Cooper, 49).<br>
