<span class="headword">Penn,  Richard</span>  (1733/4&#150;1811), <span class="occ">colonial official and politician</span>, was the second son of Richard Penn (<i>d</i>. 1771), and Hannah, daughter of Richard Lardner. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21857/', "William Penn")</script>, the founder of Pennsylvania, was his grandfather, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21849/', "John Penn")</script>, lieutenant-governor of Pennsylvania, was his elder brother. He was educated at Eton College and matriculated at St John's College, Cambridge, in October 1752, aged eighteen, and went to the Inner Temple in the same year. In 1771 he was appointed by his uncle, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21855/', "Thomas Penn")</script>, and his father, two of the first proprietaries of Pennsylvania, as deputy governor of the province during his brother's absence in England.<br>
<br>Penn arrived in Philadelphia on 16 October 1771, and occupied the post until John's return in August 1773. His care of the province's commercial interests made him popular with the white colonists. While in America he married Mary Masters on 21 May 1772; the couple had two daughters and two sons, <a href="#cosubject_21858">William</a> and <a href="#cosubject_21854">Richard [<i>see below</i>]</a>. He returned to England in 1775, carrying with him a petition from the first American congress to the king. Penn was examined before the House of Lords as to the support for independence in the colonies. In 1787 he and his family were granted considerable compensation from the United States for his loss of property there, and he visited America one last time shortly before his death.<br>
<br>On 9 April 1784 Penn was elected member of parliament for the borough of Appleby, Westmorland, which he represented until 20 December 1790, when he was returned for Haslemere, Surrey. From 1796 until 1802 he sat for the city of Lancaster, and in the latter year was again chosen for Haslemere. He supported Pitt, but was alone in not going over to the opposition during the regency. He died at his house at Richmond, Surrey, on 27 May 1811; he was survived by his wife.<br>
<br>Penn's elder son, <a name="cosubject_21858"></a><span class="headword">William Penn</span>  (1776&#150;1845), <span class="occ">author</span>, was educated at St John's College, Cambridge, but left without taking a degree. Aged seventeen he published, anonymously, <span class="italic">Vindiciae Britannicae: being Strictures on Gilbert Wakefield's &#145;Spirit of Christianity&#146;</span> (1794); an appendix, in answer &#145;to the Calumnies of the <span class="italic">Analytical Review</span>&#146;, appeared later in the year. William Penn also wrote verse and prose for the <span class="italic">Anti-Jacobin Review</span> and the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span>, in which he published under the pseudonym Rajah of Vaneplysia. Extravagance and conviviality ruined his prospects, and his drinking attracted comment from the prince of Wales. After spending much of his time in the debtors' prison, he died in Nelson Square, Southwark, on 17 September 1845. He was buried at St Mary Redcliffe, Bristol, beside his great-great-grandfather Admiral Sir William Penn.<br>
<br>William Penn's younger brother, <a name="cosubject_21854"></a><span class="headword">Richard Penn</span>  (1784&#150;1863), <span class="occ">author</span>, was employed at the Colonial Office. He was elected a fellow of the Royal Society on 18 November 1824. A cipher that he arranged for use in dispatches is illustrated in his pamphlet <span class="italic">On a New Mode of Secret Writing</span> (1829). He also wrote <span class="italic">Maxims and Hints for an Angler, and Miseries of Fishing</span> (1833), illustrated by Sir Francis Chantrey, to which was added <span class="italic">Maxims and Hints for a Chess Player</span>, with portrait-caricatures of the author and Sir Francis, by the latter. An enlarged edition was published in 1839, and another, containing <span class="italic">Maxims and Hints on Shooting</span>, appeared in 1855. Richard Penn died, unmarried, at Richmond, Surrey, on 21 April 1863.<br>
