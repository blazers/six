<span class="headword">Staniforth,  Sampson</span>  (1720&#150;1799), <span class="occ">soldier and Methodist preacher</span>, was born in December 1720 in Sheffield, Yorkshire, the son of a cutler. His parents had thirteen children, of whom only four lived to maturity. In the autobiography he wrote for John Wesley at the end of his life he said that no care was taken of his education and that he learned nothing of religion or morality; in this he was untypical of Methodist preachers. From fourteen to seventeen he was apprenticed to a baker; he was diligent in his work, but he fell into bad company and took to gaming. Late in 1739 he enlisted in the army, to his mother's distress (she had bought him off once before), and marched to Edinburgh. He heard George Whitefield preach several times in Glasgow (probably in 1742), but could not understand what he said. In Perth he narrowly escaped being killed by the relations of a young woman he refused to marry. In spring 1743 his regiment shipped to Ostend, and after a long and dangerous march joined the grand British, Hanoverian, and Austrian army a few days after the battle of Dettingen. For the next year he and his comrades devoted much time to plundering the countryside and its inhabitants, even though it was a hanging offence. He was &#145;engaged with a negro-man's wife&#146; who was passionately fond of him  (&#145;A short account&#146;, 19). He was then aged twenty-four, and the first, irresponsible, part of his life was about to come to an end.<br>
<br>Staniforth now met a Methodist soldier called Mark Bond, who had been converted by John Haime, William Clements, and John Evans, and who in turn took Staniforth to the preaching. The effect on him was immediate: &#145;I was as it were knocked down like an ox&#146;  (&#145;A short account&#146;, 68). One of the members of the society gave him a piece of an old <span class="roman">Bible</span>, which he read with great joy. Under Bond's care he gave up all his old habits and began to invite others to the preaching. At winter quarters in Ghent, with Clements as preacher, the society hired two rooms for their meetings. All this time Staniforth was in increasing distress because of his past life. &#145;I thought the very stones in the street, and the timber in the wall cried out against me for my enormous wickedness&#146;  (ibid., 71). One night on guard duty he had a vision of Christ on the cross, and knew that his sins were forgiven. &#145;My chains fell off; my heart was free&#146;  (ibid., 72). He wrote a long letter to his mother, who had regularly sent him money, asking her forgiveness; the letter came into the hands of a dissenting minister, John Wadsworth, who sent him a <span class="roman">Bible</span>, and a Methodist, John Wilson, who sent him a hymnbook.<br>
<br>In May 1745 Staniforth took part in the battle of Fontenoy, in which the allies were defeated by the French, and despite witnessing the deaths of many members of the society he thought he would not change his way of life for any other under the sun. Because of the number of losses he was transferred to the artillery at double the pay. The greater part of the British army was now ordered back to England because of the Jacobite rising, and at the end of October 1745 Staniforth was camped on Deptford Heath. Wherever his regiment marched he asked after the Methodists. He reached Stafford, but when the rebels turned aside to Derby he was ordered back to Deptford, where he lay until April 1746. His commanding officer allowed him to go to London twice a week to hear Wesley preach at the Foundry or at West Street Chapel, and here he met his future wife, of whom further details are unknown. He left her on his wedding day, 12 June 1746, to embark for the Netherlands. She wanted him to apply for a discharge, but he refused to do this when a battle was imminent, &#145;lest I should seem afraid to fight, and so bring a scandal upon the Gospel&#146;  (&#145;A short account&#146;, 239). In the disastrous campaign in Flanders of September 1746 (which he described in a letter to Wesley of 17 October 1746) his regiment covered the British retreat, and his close friend Mark Bond was killed. For a time he wished he had died by his side. His wife renewed her request, and he bought his discharge for 15 guineas, eventually returning to England on 22 February 1748.<br>
<br>For the rest of his life Staniforth was active as a local preacher in Deptford. In the early stages he had to apply to a magistrate to control the rioters at preaching time. Initially he read out some of Wesley's sermons once a week, and preachers were supplied from London. He organized a subscription for building a preaching-room at a cost of &pound;225; it was opened by Charles Wesley in 1757, and in due course Staniforth himself began to preach, despite his initial fear. He was now a preacher, steward, visitor of the sick, and band and class leader for the Methodists, and in 1760 and 1761 parish constable and overseer of the poor. In 1764 he was involved in an ill-judged experiment of John Wesley: he was ordained with three others by the Greek &#145;bishop&#146; Erasmus, but wisely made no use of this privilege. In 1771 he arranged for the building of a preaching-room at Rotherhithe, at a cost of nearly &pound;200, for which he lent &pound;100 of his own. He turned down several invitations to leave the Methodists, presumably from dissenting congregations, at a salary of &pound;40 or &pound;50 p.a. After he gave up his business (unidentified in his autobiography, though he seems to have prospered) he moved to Shoreham as assistant preacher at the request of the vicar, Vincent Perronet, but later returned to Deptford. His wife, an asthmatic, predeceased him; they had no children. He died in Deptford in 1799 (before 3 April), aged seventy-eight. He was described as &#145;of a remarkably calm, mild temper, and of a peaceable and healing spirit&#146;  (<span class="italic">Methodist Magazine</span>, 22.462), a sharp contrast to his critical self-portrait as a young man. His surviving relations and legatees evidently resented his Methodism, and invited none of his friends to the funeral, though his fellow preachers attended him to the grave.<br>
