<span class="headword">Locker,  William</span>  (1731&#150;1800), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, was born in February 1731 in the official residence attached to the Leathersellers' Hall, London, the second son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16894/', "John Locker (1693&#150;1760)")</script>, the clerk to the company, and his wife, Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1759), daughter of Edward Stillingfleet. He followed his father to Merchant Taylors' School and entered the navy on 9 June 1746 as captain's servant in the <i>Kent</i> with a family relation, Captain Charles Windham (or Wyndham). After the latter's death Locker was moved to the <i>Vainqueur</i> (Captain James Kirk) bound for the West Indies, and then to the <i>Vulture</i> and the <i>Cornwall</i>, flagship of Charles Knowles, and was present at the capture of Port Louis. He then rejoined Kirk in the <i>Elizabeth</i> and returned home. After the peace he made two or more voyages to India and China in the East India Company's service, but in 1755 he rejoined the navy as master's mate in the <i>St George</i>, then Admiral Sir Edward Hawke's flagship. He passed for lieutenant on 7 January 1756, and was taken by Hawke in the <i>Antelope</i> when the admiral was sent out to relieve John Byng; he was promoted lieutenant to the <i>Experiment</i> on 4 July, though Sir Edward seems to have had difficulty in having the appointment confirmed  (Mackay, 155, 265), and thus he earned Locker's lifelong gratitude, expressed in the name of his youngest and best-known son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16893/', "Edward Hawke Locker")</script>.<br>
<br>In January 1757 John Jervis, then a lieutenant of the <i>Culloden</i>, was appointed to the temporary command of the <i>Experiment</i> during Captain John Strachan's illness, and thus for two important months Jervis was Locker's shipmate. After an indecisive engagement with a large French privateer on 16 March, Jervis returned to the <i>Culloden</i>, and Strachan resumed command of the <i>Experiment</i>. On 8 July, off Alicante, she captured the <i>T&eacute;l&eacute;maque</i>, a privateer of 20 guns and 460 men. Trusting to this enormous superiority in men, the <i>T&eacute;l&eacute;maque</i> endeavoured to lay the <i>Experiment</i> on board, and after two attempts partially succeeded. Only a few of the French were able to get on board, and these were immediately killed. Locker was ordered by Strachan to enter the <i>T&eacute;l&eacute;maque</i>, a task which he carried out successfully. The result of this remarkable action was the loss of 235 Frenchmen killed and wounded, while the <i>Experiment</i> lost only forty-eight. Locker himself suffered a wound in the leg. At the time he thought little of it; but he never completely recovered from its effects.<br>
<br>In December 1758 Locker was moved, with Strachan, to the <i>Sapphire</i> (32 guns); she was attached to the fleet off Brest through summer and autumn 1759, and Locker was present at the defeat of the French in Quiberon Bay on 20 November. He was taken by Hawke into his flagship, the <i>Royal George</i>, in March 1760 and, moving up in rotation, became first lieutenant in July 1761. On 7 April 1762 he was promoted to the command of the fireship <i>Roman Emperor</i> and so began what Edward Hawke Locker was to describe as his father's happiest period of naval service.<br>
<br>In 1763 Locker was appointed to the sloop <i>Nautilus</i> and was sent to withdraw the British garrison from Goree in west Africa, as the peace restored it to France. After returning the garrison to England the <i>Nautilus</i> was sent to the Jamaica station, visiting ports in the Gulf of Mexico and venturing up the Mississippi River. She paid off at Deptford on 8 March 1768, and, to indicate Admiralty approval, Locker was promoted captain on 26 May 1768. In 1770 he married Lucy, daughter of Admiral William Parry, and granddaughter of Commodore Charles Brown. She died in 1780, leaving two daughters, Lucy and Elizabeth, and three sons, William, John, and Edward Hawke. Possibly through his wife the family had interests at Addington, Kent, as well as a farm at Gillingham. From 1770 to 1773 Locker commanded the frigate <i>Thames</i> on the home station, and in 1777 he commissioned the <i>Lowestoft</i> for the West Indies. Horatio Nelson, then just promoted, was at the same time appointed one of the <i>Lowestoft's</i> lieutenants, and remained with Locker for about fifteen months; he was at this time barely nineteen, and the stamp of Locker's teaching and of his experience of Hawke had a lasting effect. More than twenty years afterwards (9 February 1799) Nelson wrote to Locker:<blockquote>I have been your scholar; it is you who taught me to board a Frenchman by your conduct when in the Experiment; it is you who always told me &#145;Lay a Frenchman close and you will beat him;&#146; and my only merit in my profession is being a good scholar. Our friendship will never end but with my life, but you have always been too partial to me. (<span class="italic">Dispatches and Letters</span>, 3.260)</blockquote>In 1779 Locker's health gave way and he was compelled to invalid, nor could he undertake any further active employment. In 1787, on the prospect of war with France, he was appointed to regulate the impress service at Exeter. In the Spanish armament of 1790 he commanded the <i>Cambridge</i> as flag-captain to Vice-Admiral Thomas Graves, then commander-in-chief at Plymouth; and in 1792 he was for a short time commodore and commander-in-chief at the Nore. On 15 February 1793 he was appointed lieutenant-governor of Greenwich Hospital.<br>
<br>Much of the interest in Locker derives from his role as a teacher, friend, and correspondent of Nelson. During his later years he compiled materials for a naval history, a task in which he was much assisted by Admiral John Forbes. Though unachieved, that project (according to its advertisement) was intended &#145;to rescue, by the products of unquestionable evidence, the characters of several worthy sea officers from false aspersions which have been cast on them by violence of party or the malice of individuals&#146;  (NMM, CLU/8). Locker himself had no literary experience, and subsequently handed his material to John Charnock who used it in writing his six-volume <span class="italic">Biographia navalis</span> (1794&#150;8). It was also at Locker's suggestion, and with prior help from him, that Charnock wrote his <span class="italic">Life of Nelson</span>. Locker died at Greenwich Hospital on 26 December 1800. He asked to be buried in the family vault at Addington where he had previously erected a memorial to his wife.<br>
