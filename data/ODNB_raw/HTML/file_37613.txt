<span class="headword">Jones,  Agnes Elizabeth</span>  (1832&#150;1868), <span class="occ">nurse</span>, was born on 10 November 1832 in Cambridge, the elder daughter of Major Joseph Jones (1795&#150;1850) of Londonderry and his wife, Elizabeth Smyth. Agnes Jones was the niece of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16182/', "John Lawrence, first Baron Lawrence")</script>, viceroy of India and friend of Florence Nightingale. Major Jones, who served with the 12th regiment of foot, was promoted lieutenant-colonel in 1835. The regiment was posted to Mauritius in 1837, and the family spent six years there, until 1843 when Jones retired, as a lieutenant-colonel, and the family returned to the family home at Fahan, co. Donegal. Apart from two years at Miss Ainsworth's school at Avonbank, Stratford upon Avon (1848&#150;50), Agnes Jones was educated at home. Following Lieutenant-Colonel Jones's death in 1850 the family moved to Dublin, and for three years Agnes Jones taught at the local ragged school, and visited the sick.<br>
<br>While on a six-month continental holiday with her family, in 1853, she spent a week at Kaiserswerth, near D&uuml;sseldorf, in Germany, where the Lutheran pastor Fliedner had founded an institution for ex-women prisoners in 1833, which had grown to include a hospital, an orphanage, a lunatic asylum, and two schools, run by a community of deaconesses.<br>
<br>Inspired by the work of Florence Nightingale in the Crimea, Agnes Jones was determined to become a nurse, and eventually, in 1860, she overcame her mother's opposition and embarked on eight months' training at Kaiserswerth. She was dissuaded by Pastor Fliedner from volunteering to go to the Syrian mission, and at his suggestion she finished training as a hospital sister and returned to England hoping to work for Florence Nightingale. On her return in April 1861 she took charge of the new Parker Street dormitory for girls, in London, run by the Bible Women's Mission, but this was cut short by the need for her to go to Rome to nurse her sister, who had been taken ill. In 1862 she became a Nightingale probationer at St Thomas's Hospital, London. After one year's training there, where she was Florence Nightingale's &#145;best and dearest pupil&#146;, she worked as a sister at the Great Northern Hospital for the first six months of 1864.<br>
<br>In April 1865, after months of hesitation, Agnes Jones, accompanied by twelve Nightingale nurses, went to Liverpool as lady superintendent of the Liverpool workhouse infirmary at Brownlow Hill. In 1864 William Rathbone, a wealthy shipowner and philanthropist, and a member of the Liverpool vestry, had offered to pay for a matron and trained nurses for three years, as an experiment, to be supplied by the Nightingale Fund, and Florence Nightingale had nominated Agnes Jones. Previously there had been no trained nurses in poor-law institutions, nursing being done by the paupers themselves, and there was widespread sickness among workhouse inmates. She began work in charge of the male wards only, but in 1867 her authority was extended to all the wards, and the vestry decided to make the new system permanent, and to pay for it. Brownlow Hill was the first workhouse to have its own training school for nurses. At first, her uncompromising attitude led to clashes with the governor, George Carr, but, after intervention by Florence Nightingale, relations improved. She was greatly overworked, with between 1300 and 1500 patients, several hundred more than the number of beds, and only fifty nurses. She had only four hours sleep a night.<br>
<br>Agnes Jones's intense religious fervour, which had led her into nursing in the first place, caused Florence Nightingale some anxiety. She took <span class="roman">Bible</span>-reading classes among her nurses, and tried to lead sinners to repentance, and Florence Nightingale was afraid this might damage the reputation of workhouse nursing. After Agnes Jones's death her two aunts, Georgina and Esther Smyth, wrote to Florence Nightingale with stories of miracles performed by her. Agnes Jones was very beautiful&#151;Florence Nightingale described her as &#145;pretty and young and rich and witty, ideal in her beauty as a Louis XIV shepherdess&#146;&#151;and although partially deaf she was an excellent administrator, and determined to establish the principle that she, as lady superintendent, and not a doctor or the workhouse governor, should be in charge of the nursing.<br>
<br>Agnes Jones died of typhus fever in the Liverpool workhouse infirmary on 19 February 1868. She was buried at Fahan church, co. Donegal. Florence Nightingale wrote about her work in <span class="italic">Good Words</span> in 1868 under the title &#145;Una and the Lion&#146;, without mentioning her name. Una was Agnes Jones, and the lion represented the paupers she had to nurse. This eulogy was designed as a recruiting appeal for women to train as hospital nurses. Although the Liverpool scheme collapsed shortly after her death, as she had trained no successor and there was no one suitable to replace her, she had proved the importance of professional workhouse nursing. Within ten years of her death pauper assistants were no longer used in workhouse infirmaries, and in 1879 the Workhouse Infirmary Nursing Association was formed. A memorial erected to Agnes Jones in the Liverpool workhouse was later moved to the city's Walton Hospital. Liverpool Cathedral has a memorial window dedicated to her.<br>
