<span class="headword">Evans,  Dorothy</span>  (1888&#150;1944), <span class="occ">activist and organizer</span>, was born on 6 May 1888 at 14 St Paul's Road, Kentish Town, London, daughter of Edward Evans, commercial clerk, and his wife, Marian, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Smith. Little is known of her parents beyond the occupation of her father. Dorothy Evans was educated at North London Collegiate School, trained as a teacher at Dartford College of Physical Education, and worked briefly as a teacher of gymnastics before resigning to commit herself full-time to the cause of women's suffrage in 1909. From this point she began a lifelong career of political activism and organization, primarily in relation to issues of women's inequality.<br>
<br>As an active member of the Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU), Dorothy Evans was deeply committed to militant tactics of civil disobedience in pursuit of women's suffrage. She was arrested and imprisoned on numerous occasions, undertaking hunger and thirst strikes and suffering forced feeding. In 1910 she was first arrested for failing to pay a dog licence on the grounds that women should not be taxed unless they had political representation. Involvement in a window-smashing campaign in the West End in 1912 resulted in her first imprisonment. The next year her loyalty to the WSPU and its leadership led to the trusted role of liaison officer between the WSPU headquarters in London and its exiled leader Christabel Pankhurst in Paris. To move freely between the two capitals Dorothy Evans was forced to travel in disguise.<br>
<br>As a key activist and organizer, Dorothy Evans was sent by the WSPU to the north of Ireland to increase agitation for women's suffrage. In 1913 she was arrested for being in possession of explosives during an abortive attempt to blow up Lisburn Castle. For this and other activities in Ireland she was charged with conspiracy. However, as on other occasions, her court appearances and prison terms were disrupted by repeated hunger and thirst striking. In 1914 she was released from prison under the government's wartime amnesty for suffragette prisoners.<br>
<br>Shocked by the scale of suffering caused by the First World War, Dorothy Evans became a &#145;whole-hearted pacifist&#146;, speaking in favour of international arbitration at public meetings  (Whately, 46). After the war she continued to devote her time and energy to feminist causes, working with other suffragettes in the newly formed Six Point Group which was committed to securing legal equality between the sexes. During the 1920s her commitment to issues concerned with legal equal rights for women, such as equal pay and women's right to custody of their children and to retain their nationality on marriage, linked her with the &#145;old&#146; feminism rather than the &#145;new&#146;, or special needs, feminism espoused by Eleanor Rathbone and her National Union of Societies for Equal Citizenship. Although a committed socialist and pacifist during this period, she was always prepared to put aside issues of personal political affinity to work for equality with women across the political spectrum.<br>
<br>In the mid-1930s, together with socialist feminists such as the Labour MP Edith Summerskill, Dorothy Evans became convinced, through her concern for the welfare of married women and housewives, that feminist groups should shift their focus of concern to married women's position in the home. At the same time, she believed it was necessary for feminism to reach out to working-class women by building alliances with the labour movement. She was instrumental in founding the Married Women's Association, a key feminist organization of the 1940s and 1950s committed to securing the legal and economic rights of housewives.<br>
<br>Dorothy Evans's interest in the position of married women and housewives was particularly notable given that her personal opposition to the institution of marriage was well known. Although involved in a long-term relationship with A. Emil Davies, treasurer of the Fabian Society, with whom she had a daughter, she never married. According to her biographer, Monica Whately, she believed in a &#145;partnership held together by love, comradeship and mutual respect and not by legal ties&#146;  (Whately, 47). In the mid-1930s she also began a long-term lesbian relationship with the feminist and pacifist activist Sybil Morrison.<br>
<br>During the Second World War Dorothy Evans continued to work full-time for equality. She was appointed secretary of Women for Westminster, a national organization committed to increasing women's representation in parliament. During the same period she was also largely responsible for researching and framing the <span class="roman">Equal Citizenship (Blanket) Bill</span>. Although unsuccessful, this attempted piece of legislation stands as a fitting testimony to Dorothy Evans's political aspirations, since it was intended to rectify in one stroke all instances of discrimination against women on the statute book.<br>
<br>By the time of her death in 1944, Dorothy Evans had become a leading figure in women's politics. Despite what was for the period an unconventional lifestyle, she appears to have gained the respect, admiration, and support of a wide range of women, including those who disagreed with her on moral or religious grounds. She was also one of the few feminists able to bridge the generation gap between older women, like herself, who had been involved in the suffrage struggle, and younger women who had come into politics during the 1930s and 1940s. According to Bee Serota, a young member of the Six Point Group in the early 1940s, Dorothy Evans had &#145;this tremendous quality of being able to encourage young people and not necessarily to think as she thought, but to do things themselves&#146;  (Blackford, 89). On 28 August 1944 at the age of fifty-five Dorothy Evans died of cancer in Canniesburn Auxiliary Hospital, Bearsden, Glasgow. Active in women's politics even in the late stages of her illness, she was in Glasgow to address a public meeting. She left her body for medical research.<br>
