<span class="headword">Sobhuza II</span> <span class="st"> [Ngwenyama,  the Lion]</span>  (1899&#150;1982), <span class="occ">king of Swaziland</span>, was born at Zombodze, Swaziland, on 22 July 1899, one of four sons born to his predecessor, King Ngwane V 
    (Bhunu; <i>c</i>.1875&#150;1899)
   and Lomawa Nxumalo or Ndwandwe (<i>d</i>. 1938), the monarch's chief wife. His father died a few months after his birth and his grandmother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/94560/', "Queen Labotsibeni")</script> then ruled as co-regent with his uncle Prince Logcogco. He was educated at the Swazi National School, Zombodze, and at the Lovedale Institution in South Africa before assuming the Swazi throne as paramount chief at the age of twenty-two in 1921. In the course of his long life Sobhuza took many wives, and had more than sixty recognized sons and a similar number of daughters.<br>
<br>Throughout his long reign Sobhuza presided over the transformation of his country from British protectorate to independent statehood within the Commonwealth. His survival as a traditional monarch was exceptional in a period when, elsewhere in Africa, tribal authority was denigrated and often pushed aside as an antique obstacle in the path to modernization and national self-determination. Sobhuza, however, possessed political skills in abundance, and he cunningly blended appeal to tribal custom with a capacity to manage economic and social change for his kingdom without weakening his autocratic power base. The following year he led a delegation to London, though to little avail.<br>
<br>He also took his case against Allister Miller, who occupied land that included the site of an ancient royal Kraal, to the privy council in 1929, holding that all land occupied by white settlers was held subject to his own sovereign rights. He was defeated by the terms of the <span class="roman">Foreign Jurisdictions Act</span>, which effectively placed the actions of British administrations in protectorates beyond the reach of the British courts. After these failures to achieve any change on the land issue, Sobhuza and his advisers began to embark on a deliberate programme of ethnic mobilization and the development of an ideology that eventually emerged as Swazi &#145;traditionalism&#146;. In doing this he enlisted the support of sympathetic officials such as A. G. Marwick, resident commissioner from 1935 to 1937, and social anthropologists including Bronislaw Malinowski, Isaac Schapera, Winifred Hoernle, and, above all, Hilda Kuper.<br>
<br>Sobhuza's role during the years of British rule was essentially ceremonial; for his people&#151;a largely agricultural community&#151;the king was a source of ritual, ensuring rain and a fertile crop. Yet as early as 1922 Sobhuza demonstrated his political leadership of the Swazi nation by petitioning the British government to nullify a proclamation increasing the land available to the white-settler community.<br>
<br>In the early 1960s the king became a major actor in the events that led to independence for his country in 1968. He strongly opposed the orthodox post-colonial constitution proposed by the British government, in which he was assigned the role of constitutional monarch presiding over a Westminster-style parliament. As he emphasized, &#145;Western democracy is not suitable for my people &hellip; my rule through the tribal council is best for them.&#146; Sobhuza organized an unofficial referendum on the British constitutional proposals&#151;widely seen as a contest between himself and the resident commissioner, Sir Brian Marwick, the nephew of A. G. Marwick&#151;and founded his own party&#151;the Imbokodvo (&#145;grinding stone&#146;) National Movement&#151;which in the pre-independence elections of 1967 won all twenty-four seats in the legislative council and 80 per cent of the popular vote. The nationalist opposition had split into competing factions in the years before the election, and it never effectively challenged Sobhuza's rule thereafter. In the 1972 election the Ngwane National Liberatory Congress won three seats, and this modest revival in nationalist fortunes so disturbed Sobhuza that he promptly abrogated the constitution, banned political parties, and for the next six years ruled by decree through the national council, a traditional body of tribal advisers. Sobhuza was appointed KBE in the 1966 new year's honours.<br>
<br>In 1978 a new constitution was promulgated which provided for an elaborate reversion to a tribal mode of rule involving an electoral college of eighty members chosen by forty local councils (<i>tinkhundla</i>), dominated by tribal elements. The parliament (which opened in 1979) was in effect a gathering of the &#145;king's men&#146; issuing instructions to the cabinet and civil service&#151;&#145;the administrative agents of traditional authority&#146;. Thus, by the time of his diamond jubilee in September 1981, Sobhuza had successfully restored and indeed strengthened the monarch's role as the chief arbiter of decision-making in his kingdom.<br>
<br>The Swazi economy prospered under Sobhuza's leadership. Swaziland is rich in natural resources, and much of the land and mineral wealth originally owned by non-Swazi interests was brought under indigenous control during Sobhuza's reign. His foreign policy displayed a mixture of caution and commitment to the details of the Organization of African Unity. Neighbouring South Africa was the dominant state in the region, and&#151;at Pretoria's insistence&#151;Sobhuza kept a tight grip on the activities of the exiled African National Congress (ANC). A secret accord was signed with South Africa in 1982 which in effect deprived the ANC of sanctuary within Swaziland. Yet, at the same time, Sobhuza maintained cordial relations with his Marxist neighbour, President Samora Machel of Mozambique.<br>
<br>Old and infirm, Sobhuza died on 21 August 1982 in Mbabane, Swaziland. The choice of his successor according to Swazi custom threatened to be prolonged and difficult. He left a stable polity and an economy that, by African standards, was a model of successful, if unbalanced, growth. His achievement was considerable; his intuitive understanding of his people's preference for traditional ways enabled Swaziland to avoid the upheavals characteristic of much of post-war Africa. He was shrewd enough to realize that Western-style government could not easily be grafted onto a chiefly structure profoundly resistant to rapid and uneven modernization. He kept in check the political and economic expectations of his people, but in so doing he may well have placed a burden on his young and untried successor, the fourteen-year-old Makhosetive, his son with Ntombi la Tfwala, who was queen regent of Swaziland from 1983 (following a power struggle in which Queen Dzeliwe was deposed) until the prince was installed as King Mswati III in April 1986.<br>
