<span class="headword">Tresilian, Sir  Robert</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1388), <span class="occ">justice</span>, was a native of Cornwall, owning land at Tresillian, near Merther, though his early career was in Oxfordshire and Berkshire. He received payments for legal advice to Exeter College, Oxford, in 1354&#150;6. On 3 June 1359 Tresilian was recorded as an attorney, and in 1365 as a charter witness in Berkshire. He was a JP in Berkshire in 1367 and in Oxfordshire in 1368. Tresilian maintained links with Cornwall, however, for in 1369 he was probably counsel in a Cornish assize case, and in that year he served as knight of the shire for the county. On 7 December 1369 an order to Hugh Courtenay, earl of Devon, recorded that the admiral had judged a case with two justices and Robert Tresilian, &#145;all learned in the law&#146;  (<span class="italic">CClR, 1369&#150;1374</span>, 59). By 10 February 1370 Tresilian was serving as JP for Cornwall and he served on many Cornish commissions thereafter. He also accounted for the earl of Stafford's rents in Cornwall in 1372, and on 12 August 1376 was appointed to a commission on the Devon stannary, along with the earl of Devon. Perhaps it was due to his Courtenay connections that on 10 September 1377 Tresilian was appointed to a commission headed by William Courtenay, bishop of London, relating to the custody of the properties of Enguerrand (VII) de Coucy (<i>c</i>.1340&#150;1397). On 21 February 1378 he was described as steward of Cornwall.<br>
<br>By this time Tresilian had become a servant of the crown. In Michaelmas term 1375 he became a king's serjeant, and on 6 May 1378 he was appointed a justice of king's bench. Exactly a month later, on 6 June, he became a knight, being made a banneret at Windsor, with robes given him by the king. Despite his new duties, Tresilian continued to serve in Oxfordshire, where he was again appointed JP on 28 June 1378, and had several other commissions there and in Cornwall. On 10 September 1378, however, he was replaced as steward of Cornwall, though apparently serving again in that capacity before 1385.<br>
<br>Tresilian remained a puisne justice of king's bench until June 1381. On 12 December 1379 he was empowered to receive cognitions and issue certificates even though he was not a justice of common pleas. During these years he served on local commissions not only in the south-west but also in Staffordshire and Wales. These duties were interrupted by the peasants' revolt in June 1381, during which Sir John Cavendish, chief justice of king's bench, was killed. On 22 June Tresilian was appointed to succeed Cavendish, and according to both Knighton and Walsingham he dealt extremely harshly with the rebels, putting heavy pressure on juries to convict, and sentencing those convicted to brutal punishments. Tresilian presided over the execution of John Ball, the rebel preacher, on 14 July 1381, and also that of William Grindcobbe, the leader of the townsmen of St Albans, in October 1381, and of John Wraw, the rebel leader in Suffolk, in May 1382.<br>
<br>As the 1380s progressed Tresilian not only continued to serve as chief justice of king's bench, and as a member of numerous commissions in south and south-west England, but also became increasingly involved in national politics, whose often bitterly partisan character inevitably made him a controversial figure. On 27 May 1384 he was appointed with John, first Lord Montagu, steward of the household, to try Friar John Latimer, who had accused the duke of Lancaster of treason. Before the steward could act, however, Latimer was tortured to death by John Holland, Lancaster's future son-in-law. On 18 July following Tresilian received a pardon, not only for treasons and felonies, but also for sales of the laws of the land and other judicial misconduct of the sort with which he was later charged. Another controversial case arose on 9 September, when Montagu, Tresilian, and Sir Robert Bealknap, chief justice of common pleas, were ordered to try John Northampton, the former mayor of London, and his allies, who claimed the support of the duke of Lancaster. Tresilian wished to refer the case to the new mayor of London, but was nevertheless present when Northampton was condemned to life imprisonment at Tintagel, Cornwall.<br>
<br>Tresilian took a stronger line against Lancaster the next year. According to Walsingham, the king and his friends planned to arrest the duke, and Robert Tresilian &#145;boldly mainperned&#146; that he would sentence Lancaster as his crimes deserved. These activities have been identified with a plot in which young courtiers planned to murder Lancaster on 14 February 1385, but the duke escaped. It is a measure of Richard II's trust in Tresilian that at this very time, on 15 February, he should have been retained for life of the king's council, with a yearly fee of 100 marks from the issues of Cornwall and Devon (which he undertook not to collect while receiving other fees), while on 24 February following he was granted the keeping of Conerton Manor in Cornwall. He also appears to have recovered the stewardship of Cornwall, since on 12 December 1385 he was once more replaced in that office.<br>
<br>On 19 November 1386 parliament appointed a commission to restrain the king and his advisers, particularly the chancellor, Michael de la Pole, who was impeached. In the following year it was probably Tresilian who drafted the questions about the commission and impeachment, the so-called &#145;questions to the judges&#146;, which were presented to the other royal justices in meetings at Shrewsbury (1&#150;5 August) and Nottingham (25 August). They all sealed answers declaring that the commission was illegal, the impeachment invalid, and those restricting the royal power punishable as traitors. Later Bealknap and other justices said they signed under threat of death. The response of the king's adversaries was swift and drastic. On 17 November 1387 Thomas, duke of Gloucester, Richard, earl of Arundel, and Thomas, earl of Warwick, later joined by Henry, earl of Derby (son of the duke of Lancaster), and Thomas, earl of Nottingham, appealed Sir Robert Tresilian along with Robert de Vere, duke of Ireland, Michael de la Pole, earl of Suffolk, Alexander Neville, archbishop of York, and Sir Nicholas Brembre (former mayor of London) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/53093/', "Lords appellant")</script>]. The charges against Tresilian were primarily of giving &#145;aid and counsel&#146; to the chief &#145;traitors&#146;, meaning de Vere, de la Pole, and Neville, but of particular relevance to him were accusations of assembling the justices without the assent of the continual council set up under the commission of 1386, and of making very suspicious demands of them (a reference to the &#145;questions to the judges&#146;), and also of manipulating legal cases to their own profit (something Tresilian had demonstrably done).<br>
<br>De Vere's attempt to fight the appellants was defeated, and the latter took control. On 4 January 1388 they ordered that Tresilian be imprisoned at Gloucester, but on the same day he was also referred to as a fugitive. Froissart says Tresilian reached Bristol, and there told the king he would return to London to spy on the appellants. But the king was not actually at Bristol, and Tresilian is more likely to have hidden in the London area.<br>
<br>Tresilian was summoned to answer the appeal in parliament and on failing to appear was condemned by default, on 13 February 1388. Six days later he was found hiding in disguise in Westminster. His discovery caused a sensation, coming when proceedings against the king's supporters were at their height. According to Favent, Tresilian was spotted as he observed proceedings from the roof of a house next to Westminster Palace, and was subsequently discovered hiding under a table, heavily bearded and wearing eccentric clothes, so that he looked more like a pilgrim or beggar than a royal justice. Knighton attests the strange clothes and adds that the beard was false, and that Tresilian was recognized by his distinctive voice. He was dragged out to cries of &#145;We havet hym&#146;, and brought before parliament. He claimed the sanctuary of Westminster Abbey, but Gloucester denied the claim. Attempts to argue that the procedure against him had been founded in error were likewise brushed aside, and the original sentence was quickly carried out. Tresilian was drawn on a hurdle to Tyburn, where physical force was needed to make him ascend the scaffold. His clothes, which were found to be filled with protective charms, were stripped off, and he was hanged naked, finally having his throat cut.<br>
<br>Tresilian's wife, Emmaline (Emma), who had screamed and fainted at his arrest, claimed his body for burial at Greyfriars in London. She was the daughter of Richard Hiwish of Devon, and had married Sir Robert by 20 April 1377 as the widow of Richard Recote of Oxfordshire; she later married Sir John Colshull of Cornwall and died in 1403. With Tresilian she had a son, John, and at least two daughters, Joan and Emma. Tresilian had become a wealthy man. Following his execution one of his servants was ordered to answer to the king for 1000 marks from his late master's property, and he had estates in Berkshire, Buckinghamshire, and Oxfordshire, and above all Cornwall. Many of his lands in the latter county had come to him by marriage, but petitions for redress after his death suggest that Tresilian had also added to them by misusing his judicial authority. In spite of such complaints, and despite the opposition of John Tresilian, much of Sir Robert's forfeited land was acquired by <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/50130/', "John Hawley the elder")</script>, a Dartmouth merchant and pirate, who had married Emma Tresilian.<br>
<br>Sir Robert Tresilian may have been ruthless in his interpretation of the law for private and political ends, but as one of the principal intellectual architects of the &#145;high&#146; doctrine of the royal prerogative, he had a lasting if often unfortunate influence.<br>
