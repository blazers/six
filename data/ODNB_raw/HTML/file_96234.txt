<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Sandbrook,  (John) Richard</span>  (1946&#150;2005), <span class="occ">environmentalist and campaigner against poverty</span>, was born on 13 August 1946 at Forbes Fraser Hospital, Bath, the second of five sons of John Peter Sandbrook, a lieutenant-commander, later captain, in the Royal Navy, and his wife, Ethel Joan Wakeham, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Sutton. He attended Dauntsey's School in Wiltshire, and went on to the University of East Anglia, where he took a degree in biology. After a year as president of the Students' Union he spent five years with the accountancy firm Arthur Andersen &amp; Co. On 18 July 1970 he married, at the parish church of Earlham St Mary, Norfolk, Mary Wray, a 21-year-old economist, and daughter of George Arthur Wray, medical doctor. They had two sons.<br>
<br>While working as an accountant Sandbrook was already active in the environmental movement, helping to set up Friends of the Earth in the UK, and attending the United Nations conference on environment and human development in Stockholm in 1972, before taking over as managing director of Friends of the Earth in 1974. After just two years there (which included some &#145;iconic&#146; campaigning moments, such as dumping thousands of bottles on the doorstep of Schweppes UK as part of the campaign to promote returnable bottles), he moved on to join Barbara Ward (Baroness Jackson of Lodsworth) at the International Institute for Environment and Development, where he spent the next twenty-three years of his working life.<br>
<br>The institute (established in 1973) is seen by many as the birthplace of the concept of sustainable development. Barbara Ward was a development economist and one of the first people to argue that environmental stewardship and the alleviation of poverty had to go hand in hand. Sandbrook rapidly became her favoured prot&eacute;g&eacute; as he took on different roles within the organization, eventually becoming executive director for Europe in 1986 and overall executive director in 1989. By then the so-called Brundtland report, <span class="italic">Our Common Future</span> (1987), had begun to popularize the idea that wealth should only be created in any one generation in ways that did not jeopardize the prospects of future generations&#151;in a nutshell, sustainable development.<br>
<br>Sandbrook's tenure as executive director was later characterized by one close colleague as &#145;five parts inspiration, four parts perspiration and just one part administration&#146;  (private information). He was endlessly pursuing the next pot of money from donor governments or charitable foundations, but somehow there was always time to support other people's &#145;breakthrough initiatives&#146; (such as Bob Geldof's Band Aid) and to establish enduring spin-offs such as Earthscan Books. It was for his services to the UK Overseas Development Administration that he was appointed OBE in 1990.<br>
<br>In its early years the institute had been very apprehensive about working with big business, but when Sandbrook returned from the &#145;earth summit&#146; in Rio de Janeiro in 1992 he set out on a path to establishing and getting involved in a number of ground-breaking initiatives that brought the influence and resources of multinational companies to bear on a range of sustainability challenges. One of the first outcomes was the report <span class="italic">Towards a Sustainable Paper Cycle</span> (1996), which looked at ways of reducing the massive environmental and social impacts of the pulp and paper industry. This led on to a similar but more controversial project with the mining industry (from which the International Council on Mining and Metals emerged), and further work with the United Nations Development Programme as part of its &#145;growing sustainable business&#146; initiative. But even Sandbrook's astonishing mediating skills were put to the test in projects with both BP and Shell International in &#145;hot spots&#146; like Colombia and Nigeria. Radical environmental organizations looked on askance at his strategy.<br>
<br>The reason for Sandbrook's engagement with &#145;big business&#146; was not so much ideological as tactical: he just couldn't see a way of making solutions work without the enthusiastic participation of the business community. Most of his new ventures after leaving the International Institute for Environment and Development in 1999 reflected that pragmatic urgency, including his activity as a founder trustee of Forum for the Future, as non-executive director of the Eden Project in Cornwall from 1999 to 2003, and as vice-chairman (and for a short while acting chief executive) of Plantlife, a conservation charity that gave full rein to his own personal passion for plants and gardening. The focus on British initiatives (together with his work as an adviser to the prince of Wales) helped him cut back on what had always been a punishing amount of international travel, which in turn generated an endless flow of amusing and often improbable anecdotes. Despite such adventures, he was never happier than when at home with Mary and their two sons&#151;especially in their garden in Wimbledon. He died at St George's Hospital, Tooting, on 11 December 2005, of cancer. His wife and children survived him.<br>
<br>Sandbrook's interest in the environment had started in the early 1970s, and remained his abiding passion as the rest of the world gradually awoke to the seriousness of the environmental crisis. He had a profound influence both on the environmental movement and on the world of international development. He was a much-loved friend to countless people all over the world, and a man who understood the joy and the importance of constant conviviality. In July 2006 his life and work were celebrated at a gathering in central London. Many people commented at the time that it wasn't until they looked back over everything he had achieved that the real significance of his work became apparent.<br>
