<span class="headword">Lockhart, Sir  James, of Lee</span>, Lord Lee  (1588/1599&#150;1674), <span class="occ">judge</span>, was the only son of Sir James Lockhart of Lee (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1553, <i>d</i>. in or after 1635) and his second wife, Jane Weir (<i>d</i>. 1599), of Stonebyres, Lanarkshire; his parents married in 1588. He himself married first Elizabeth Fairlie and second, probably by 1621, Martha Douglas of Mordington. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16901/', "Sir George Lockhart (c.1630&#150;1689) of Carnwath")</script> seems to have been their second son. Lockhart had been knighted before 1629 when he was a gentleman of the privy chamber to Charles I.<br>
<br>Lockhart was first elected to the Scottish parliament for Lanarkshire in 1628. On 20 June 1633 he was made lord of the articles. The same year his pension was excepted from the act of revocation and his lairdship of Lee confirmed, although his father was still alive, being recorded in December 1635 as being over eighty-two years of age. In 1638 Lockhart was appointed to supervise the subscription of the national covenant in Lanarkshire. He was not elected to parliament in 1641, and his commission was rejected by parliament in June 1644 and January 1645. However, even though he was not a member he engaged in the work of parliamentary interval committees from 1643, including the committee of war. Similarly he was named to the exchequer commission on 29 July 1644. On 2 July 1646 he was made an ordinary lord of session. Lockhart was a moderate royalist who supported the engagement with Charles I, and as &#145;an able&#146; debater  (J. R. Young, 196), he played an important role in the power struggle in March&#150;May 1648, which saw the duke of Hamilton's views prevail over those of the marquess of Argyll. In the engager army Lockhart commanded a regiment at the battle of Preston in August 1648. Following the whiggamore raid and the installation of a more radical government in Edinburgh, Lockhart was deprived of office by the <span class="roman">Act of Classes</span> in February 1649 and banished by the <span class="roman">Act of Estates</span> in June 1650. His banishment was lifted in December 1650. A supporter of Charles II's invasion of England, he was surprised at Alyth in Perthshire on 28 August 1651 along with other members of the committee of estates and was carried as a captive to Broughty Castle and thence to London. He was confined in the Tower until his son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16907/', "Sir William Lockhart (1621?&#150;1675)")</script>, a Cromwellian diplomat, procured his freedom on 27 May 1653.<br>
<br>Following the Restoration, Lockhart was reappointed a lord of session, although his official appointment dated only from 5 April 1661. He appears to have supported the earl of Crawford's moderate presbyterianism in 1661, but he had little difficulty adapting to the new regime. In parliament he served as a lord of the articles in 1661&#150;3 and was reputed to be one of the few sober men of the so-called drunken parliament. In 1662 he thought it unwise to eject non-episcopalian clergy when there were insufficient numbers of replacements. In 1669 he was again a lord of the articles. Lockhart was named lord justice clerk in 1671. He died on 10 March 1674.<br>
