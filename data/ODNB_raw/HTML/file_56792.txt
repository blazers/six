<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Scott,  Edward Taylor</span>  (1883&#150;1932), <span class="occ">journalist</span>, was born on 15 November 1883 at The Firs, Whitworth Lane, Rusholme, Manchester, the third and last son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35980/', "Charles Prestwich Scott (1846&#150;1932)")</script>, editor and owner of the <span class="italic">Manchester Guardian</span>, and his wife, Rachel Susan Cook [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/48419/', "Scott, Rachel Susan (1848&#150;1905)")</script>]; the name Taylor acknowledged the Scotts' cousins, co-founders of the paper. He was educated at Rugby School and then at Corpus Christi College, Oxford, but left without a degree to study economics at the then new London School of Economics; in London he boarded with the family of the anti-imperialist writer John Atkinson Hobson. Again he left (in 1906) without a degree to become private secretary to Sydney Olivier, the Fabian socialist and newly appointed governor of Jamaica, but almost at once (1907) achieved a London BSc (Econ) degree as an external student. Before going to Jamaica he married on 5 September 1907 Mabel Josephine Hobson (1886&#150;1969), J. A. Hobson's daughter; they had four children.<br>
<br>After two years (1907&#150;9) in Jamaica, where he and his wife were intimate friends with the Olivier family, Scott became a financial journalist in the City office of the London <span class="italic">Daily News</span>; in 1913 he moved to Manchester as commercial editor of his father's newspaper. Early in 1915 he joined the Royal Field Artillery; taken prisoner in the German offensive of March 1918 and held at St Quentin, he was long posted missing, but was home by Christmas. His experiences in the First World War affected him deeply: during the 1919&#150;21 period of labour unrest, when he was in charge of economic and social topics, his leaders &#145;always show a sympathy with men who might well have been gunners in his battery a year before. His views about cabinet ministers, company directors and trade union bosses often resemble a front line soldier's opinion of the staff&#146;  (Ayerst, 432).<br>
<br>Because foreign affairs in the 1920s so often turned on economics and finance&#151;as over German inflation and reparations&#151;Scott's expertise made him in effect the paper's chief foreign as well as home leader writer. He was now also its part proprietor: in 1914 his father had divided the bulk of his shares among his two surviving sons and his son-in-law, C. E. Montague. The elder brother, John Scott, kept to the management side; in 1925 Montague deliberately left the editorial staff to make room for Ted Scott, as he was known. In 1929 C. P. Scott formally retired and Ted became editor. The octogenarian father, however, as &#145;governing director&#146; still came to the office every day and exerted an influence the son could not withstand. Scott achieved full autonomy only on his father's death on 1 January 1932, and then could exert it only for a few months. His colleague and devoted friend Malcolm Muggeridge later made the harassing father&#150;son relationship the theme of a novel, <span class="italic">Picture Palace</span> (1934); the <span class="italic">Manchester Guardian</span>, however, got the publisher to withdraw it.<br>
<br>In the 1920s Scott broadened the paper's economic and financial coverage, launching the <span class="italic">Manchester Guardian Commercial</span> (later discontinued) and <span class="italic">Manchester Guardian Weekly</span>. The policy he followed was shaped both by his own radical, independent temperament and by the stress of the two great crises he lived through, the post-war boom and slump and the world depression that started in 1929. &#145;One can hardly doubt&#146;, he wrote in one leader, &#145;that [self-government in industry] will come, and resistance to it may be futile&#146;  (<span class="italic">Manchester Guardian</span>, 23 June 1921); in another, that to keep productive workers unemployed was &#145;the economics of the madhouse&#146; (ibid., 23 Nov 1921; Ayerst, 432). He guided the paper in opposition to the 1926 general strike but also to parts of the <span class="roman">Emergency Powers Act</span>. In 1931 he led it gradually away from approval of the National Government (which, in his absence on holiday, his deputy W. P. Crozier had welcomed), criticizing its conduct of the election campaign and opposing the uniform cut in unemployment benefit; this led many business firms to cancel advertising&#151;a severe loss of revenue. By 16 November 1931 he was writing to J. L. Hammond:<blockquote>it seems to me broadly that politics are getting into an ugly shape and that we shall be driven more and more to take an anti-property line. And that is fatal to a twopenny paper. I myself feel that I am getting more and more of a socialistic way of thinking (or rather feeling) but the more I look at the Socialist party the less I like it. (Ayerst, 471)</blockquote>In overseas matters he shared the paper's sympathy with Weimar Germany and its suspicion of colonialism.<br>
<br>Where Scott might have led his &#145;twopenny paper&#146; is unknowable: on 22 April 1932 he took his son Richard to Windermere for a boating weekend; while they were on the water, very cold at that season, a freak squall capsized the boat. Richard got on top. Scott tried to swim ashore, but the cold brought a seizure; he sank and drowned. His remains were cremated four days later at Manchester crematorium.<br>
<br>Scott cared more for ideas and argument than for style. A dark, well-built, handsome man of great charm, he was &#145;so reserved and so modest that the toughness of his mind and the independence of his character escaped the negligent eye. He was of all men the most sincere and the least prejudiced&#146;  (Martin, 186). He had started to innovate and, in newspaper history, remains a great might-have-been.<br>
