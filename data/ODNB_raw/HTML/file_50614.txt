<span class="headword">Godred Crovan</span> <span class="st"> [Gu&eth;r&oslash;&eth;r, Gofraid M&eacute;r&aacute;nach]</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1095), <span class="occ">king of Man and the Isles</span>, who may be equated with the King Gorree, or Orry, of Manx tradition, was the founder of a dynasty that ruled there for nearly two centuries. His sobriquet, Crovan, may be Gaelic <i>crobh-bh&aacute;n</i> (&#145;white-handed&#146;), while the M&eacute;r&aacute;nach of Irish sources may come from <i>m&eacute;ar</i> (&#145;a finger&#146;). Little is known of his origins. The Manx chronicle claims that he was &#145;filius Haraldi nigri de ysland&#146;, which presumably refers to Iceland, but the same source says of the Manx people that he &#145;had been reared among them for some time&#146;. What little else is known of his background points to Ireland. The patronymic &#145;mac mic Arailt&#146; found in one Irish annal perhaps means that he was a son or nephew of the &Iacute;mar mac Arailt (<i>d</i>. 1054) who was king of Dublin (<i>r</i>. 1038&#150;46), and whose father (<i>d</i>. 999) was a son of &Oacute;l&aacute;f Sihtricson (Amla&iacute;b C&uacute;ar&aacute;n) of Dublin (<i>d</i>. 981).<br>
<br>Godred is said to have fought at the battle of Stamford Bridge and to have fled from there to Man where he was honourably received by the reigning king. Some years later, perhaps about 1079, he assembled ships and an army of Islesmen, and made three separate expeditions to Man, on the last of which, having landed at Ramsey harbour, he defeated the Manx in battle, and divided the island in two, giving the southern part to his followers and the northern part to those Manxmen who survived the battle. He is first mentioned in an Irish source in 1091, when he appears as king of Dublin. The Manx chronicle claims that he subdued Dublin and a great part of Leinster, presumably a reference to the hinterland of the Hiberno-Scandinavian town, known as Fine Gall, to which its rulers laid claim. He also retained control of the Isles and is said to have &#145;so tamed the Scots that no one who built a ship or boat dared use more than three iron bolts&#146;  (<span class="italic">Cronica regum Mannie et Insularum</span>, fol. 33<i>r</i>). The medieval biography of the prince of Gwynedd, Gruffudd ap Cynan (<i>d</i>. 1137), states that when the latter fled to Ireland, about 1094, and sought advice as to how best to combat the Norman advance into Wales, he was sent to Godred in the Isles, who supplied him with a fleet of sixty ships. When the king of Munster, Muirchertach &Oacute; Briain, sought to re-establish authority over Dublin in 1094, Godred was able to count on the support of many of the kings from the northern half of Ireland, and, with the help of his own fleet of ninety ships, they routed &Oacute; Briain and his allies, though when the latter dispersed, the Munstermen returned and banished Godred from Dublin. The Irish annals, calling him &#145;king of Dublin and of the Isles&#146;, report that Godred was among those who perished in an outbreak of plague in 1095, the Manx chronicle noting that he died in Islay. He left three sons, Lagman, Harald, and <a href="#cosubject_50614">&Oacute;l&aacute;f [<i>see below</i>]</a>. Lagman mutilated Harald and reigned for a short period before abdicating, and, after a brief period of direct Irish and Norwegian intervention, &Oacute;l&aacute;f eventually succeeded.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_50614"></a><span class="headword">&Oacute;l&aacute;f</span> <span class="st"> [&Oacute;l&aacute;fr Bitlingr, &Oacute;l&aacute;fr Gu&eth;r&oslash;&eth;arson]</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1153), <span class="occ">king of Man and the Isles</span>, spent at least part of his youth at the court of Henry I of England, and is said to have ruled for forty years, having &#145;all the kings of Ireland and Scotland as confederates in such a way that no one dared disturb the kingdom of the Isles during his lifetime&#146;  (<span class="italic">Cronica regum Mannie et Insularum</span>, fol. 35<i>r</i>). He founded Rushen Abbey as a daughter house of Furness in Lancashire in 1134, giving the monks of Furness the right of election to the bishopric of the Isles. He married Ingebjorg, daughter of H&aacute;kon Paulsson, earl of Orkney, and also Affreca, daughter of Fergus of Galloway, and with the latter, probably, he had his son <a href="#cosubject_50615">Godred [<i>see below</i>]</a>, though it is said that with concubines he had other sons and many daughters, one of whom married Somerled of Argyll. In 1153 the three sons of his brother Harald, who had been brought up in Dublin, invaded Man demanding half the kingdom for themselves, assassinated &Oacute;l&aacute;f on 29 June, and then launched an unsuccessful invasion of Galloway.<br>
<br>&Oacute;l&aacute;f's son <a name="cosubject_50615"></a><span class="headword">Godred</span> <span class="st"> [Guthfrith, Gofraid, Gu&eth;r&oslash;&eth;r &Oacute;l&aacute;fsson]</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1187) then returned, having done homage to the king of Norway, was acclaimed as <span class="occ">king of Man and the Isles</span>, and ruled the kingdom until his death. He faced opposition from Somerled, to whom, after defeat in battle in 1156, he was forced to cede part of the kingdom, including the Mull&#150;Islay group of islands, retaining control only over Man and the northern Hebrides. The threat from Somerled may have forced Godred into a closer bond with Henry II since on several occasions from 1156 onwards English records reveal the expenditure of small sums on his maintenance, though Godred also maintained close links with Norway, on the journey to which he passed through England in 1158; he was in Scotland in 1159, and apparently only returned to Man from Norway in 1164 (perhaps because of Somerled's death that same year), when he had to capture and mutilate his half-brother Ragnvald before regaining control. His acceptance of the suzerainty of Norway presumably accounts for the fact that by a papal decree of 1154 the diocese of Sodor and Man was subjected to the metropolitan jurisdiction of the archdiocese of Trondheim. He married Fingola, granddaughter of Muirchertach Mac Lochlainn, king of Ireland, a marriage formalized by the papal legate, Cardinal Vivian, in the winter of 1176&#150;7, and gained control of Dublin for a brief period some time before its seizure by Anglo-Normans in 1170. He assisted the Dubliners and their Irish allies in an unsuccessful attempt to dislodge the Anglo-Normans, though some years later he formed an alliance with the Anglo-Norman conqueror of Ulster, John de Courcy, who married his daughter Affreca [<i>see </i><a target="_top" href="/view/article/50616">Courcy,  Affreca  de</a>, <i>under</i> <a target="_top" href="/view/article/6443">Courcy,  John  de</a>]. Godred granted the monks of Holmcultram in Cumberland right of entry to Man and exemption from tolls and customs, and also gave land near Douglas to the priory of St Bees in Copeland. He died on 10 November 1187 on St Patrick's Isle, Peel, and was buried on Iona in the following summer.<br>
