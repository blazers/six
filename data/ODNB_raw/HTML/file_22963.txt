<span class="headword">Quin,  Michael Joseph</span>  (1796&#150;1843), <span class="occ">journalist and travel writer</span>, was born in Thurles, co. Tipperary, the third son of Morty Quin, distiller. He entered Trinity College, Dublin, as a pensioner on 4 November 1811, was admitted to Lincoln's Inn on 26 January 1818, and was subsequently called to the bar. He made a name for himself as a writer on foreign affairs with <span class="italic">A Visit to Spain</span> (1823), first published as a series of letters to the <span class="italic">Morning Herald</span>, which gave an impartial and vivid account of the state of the country at the end of the liberal triennium (1820&#150;23). It was favourably reviewed by Blanco White in the <span class="italic">Quarterly Review</span> of 1823 (vol. 29, 240&#150;41). While defending the cause of constitutional liberty, Quin accurately reported the reactionary trend of popular opinion, provoked by anti-clerical extremists. A firm opponent of the Holy Alliance, he published in the same year a <span class="italic">Secret History of the Council of Verona</span>, exposing the part played by Don Carlos, the comte de Jouffroy, and the duc de Montmorency in plotting French armed intervention against the Spanish constitutional government. His translation, entitled <span class="italic">Memoirs of Ferdinand VII</span>, of the work by Jos&eacute; Joaqu&iacute;n de Mora (1823), provided further evidence against the king whom the French restored to absolute power.<br>
<br>In 1824 Quin took up the cause of the former emperor of Mexico, Agust&iacute;n de Iturbide, then in London planning a return to power. He tried unsuccessfully to win Canning's backing for Iturbide, and translated the latter's apologia, <span class="italic">A Statement of some of the Principal Events in the Public Life of Agust&iacute;n de Iturbide</span>, published by John Murray in June 1824. When Iturbide left for Mexico in May, Quin was entrusted with the care of his elder children's education and was responsible for placing his son at Ampleforth College. Iturbide was executed on 19 July, five days after reaching Mexico.<br>
<br>Quin contributed many articles on foreign affairs to the <span class="italic">Morning Chronicle</span> and <span class="italic">Morning Herald</span>, and for seven years (1825&#150;32) was editor of the <span class="italic">Monthly Review</span>. He was a loyal supporter of Daniel O'Connell and of the campaign for Catholic emancipation, and from March 1828 to March 1829 edited the <span class="italic">Catholic Journal</span>, which represented the English Catholic Cisalpines who advocated the policy of making some concessions to the government in return for the grant of emancipation. He defended this policy at a heated meeting of the Catholic Association which was reported in the <span class="italic">Catholic Miscellany</span> of February 1829 (2.69). The author described Quin as &#145;eminently conciliatory; his forehead is good; a ruddy freshness is diffused over his face, and his eye is quick and good-natured&#146;, even though he lacked the power to move an audience. &#145;There is more of the lawyer than the orator about him. In his moments apparently the most impassioned you can see the man of prudent calculation.&#146; In 1835 he approached Nicholas Wiseman, then on a visit to London, with a view to the establishment of a Catholic periodical comparable with the <span class="italic">Edinburgh Review</span> and <span class="italic">Quarterly Review</span>. Quin, Wiseman, and O'Connell were co-proprietors of the new journal, entitled the <span class="italic">Dublin Review</span>, though it had no financial backing other than an indemnity fund of &pound;500. Quin edited the first two issues (May and July 1836) but in October 1836, on being offered a post in the Spanish colonial service in Cuba, he precipitately resigned, leaving the trustees to find a new editor in the absence of Wiseman and O'Connell. The Cuban venture fell through, and when Quin returned from Madrid, O'Connell refused to reinstate him as editor and regarded his co-proprietorship as having lapsed. Though Quin continued to contribute articles to the review, the episode created a rift in his relations with O'Connell. In February 1842 the printers of <span class="italic">The Tablet</span>, after a dispute with Frederick Lucas, appointed Quin to succeed him as editor and he held the post for the remainder of the year, during which time Lucas produced a rival publication, the <span class="italic">True Tablet</span>. O'Connell swayed opinion in favour of Lucas, who resumed full control in January 1843.<br>
<br>In addition to the titles already listed, Quin published <span class="italic">The Trade of Banking in England</span> (1833), summarizing the evidence submitted to the parliamentary committee appointed to examine the renewal of the Bank of England's charter, and an &#145;oriental romance&#146;, <span class="italic">Nourmahal</span> (1838). He enjoyed his greatest success, however, as a travel writer, and was one of the first to exploit the opportunities of steam. His <span class="italic">Steam Voyage Down the Danube: with Sketches of Hungary, Wallachia, Servia and Turkey</span> (1835) explored territory unfamiliar to the reading public, and this was followed by <span class="italic">Steam Voyages on the Seine, the Moselle and the Rhine</span> (1843). He was elected a fellow of the Royal Society of Literature about 1823.<br>
<br>In his last years Quin was beset by poverty and ill health. For reasons of economy he moved to Boulogne, where he died of lung disease on 19 February 1843 and was buried in the English cemetery. He was survived by his widow, the daughter of Edward Wallis of Burton Grange, York, and three daughters. His brother-in-law, John Edward Wallis, succeeded Frederick Lucas as editor of <span class="italic">The Tablet</span> in 1855.<br>
