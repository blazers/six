<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Thomas,  Graham Stuart</span>  (1909&#150;2003), <span class="occ">horticulturist</span>, was born on 3 April 1909 at Bemerton, Hills Road, Cherry Hinton, Cambridgeshire, the son of William Richard Thomas, clerk to the university syndicate, and his wife, Lilian, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Hays. The family were enthusiastic amateur musicians and gardeners and Thomas later said that his passion for horticulture began when, at the age of six, he was improbably given a fuchsia as a present&#151;an indication that even then the family already owned a greenhouse. On one occasion, he spent a birthday present of half a crown on alpine plants he found at a stall in Cambridge market. After attending the local school, he began formal horticultural training in 1926 when he joined the staff of the Cambridge Botanic Garden. For three years there he learned the art and craft of gardening and gained the bedrock of professional practical grounding on which his further expertise and scholarship was built. Even more importantly, he was able to draw on the living collections at Cambridge to build up a knowledge of plants in all their diversity that would have been unavailable in a normal garden. Although not himself a member of the university and no scholar, he attended lectures in botany and so acquired an all-important blend of academic knowledge and practical skills.<br>
<br>In 1930 Thomas entered commercial horticulture, taking his love of alpines to the famous Six Hills Nursery of the alpine expert Clarence Elliott in Stevenage, then moving the following year to became foreman at Hilling's wholesale nursery, near Chobham, Surrey. It was there that he met and fell under the influence of the ageing Gertrude Jekyll (she died in 1932) and cycled to her home at Munstead Wood, where he began to add knowledge of the art of gardening to that of botany and plantsmanship. Jekyll introduced Thomas to the value and beauty of the herbaceous perennial, and he thus embraced the second of the three great plant types with which he was to become particularly associated. The third plant group, old roses, came during the 1940s, by which time he had become a director of Hilling's and realized that many older varieties were being lost in the plethora of new hybrid tea and floribunda roses, which after the Second World War became an almost unstoppable tide. Thomas's attitude was advanced for its time in his interest in the collection of old varieties, an interest that later became a passion and contributed to the widespread concern for their conservation in the post-war years. It resulted in the formation of the National Council for the Conservation of Plants and Gardens. In 1956 Thomas became manager and then director of another famous and long-established nursery, Sunningdale Nurseries in Surrey, where, with his partner James Russell, he introduced a large number of old or rediscovered plants to the wider public, the vigorous pink-flowered hardy geranium &#145;Claridge Druce&#146; among the best-known. He retired as a director in 1971.<br>
<br>In the late 1940s Thomas began an association with the National Trust, initially at Lawrence Johnston's garden at Hidcote in Gloucestershire (arguably the most important English garden of the twentieth century), which passed to the trust in 1948 after his death. The association was at first informal but from 1955 Thomas was engaged formally as the trust's first gardens adviser, a position he held until 1974, although he continued to have an important guiding hand as a consultant for another twenty years until his death. The post of gardens adviser to the National Trust carried with it the responsibility and care for more gardens than any one person had probably ever had before and it was highly appropriate that Thomas should be its first incumbent, although he inevitably set a standard that was impossible for anyone else to follow. The brief but significant influence of Gertrude Jekyll on his life and thinking was manifest in the gardens he designed, added to, or remodelled for the National Trust, including Knightshayes, Shugborough, and Claremont. His crowning achievement, appropriately, was the rose garden he created in the old walled kitchen garden at Mottisfont Abbey in Hampshire, perhaps the finest rose garden in England.<br>
<br>Fortunately for posterity Thomas not only found and rescued plants, he also wrote about them with a flowing and pleasing prose and many of his books were illustrated by his own fine watercolour paintings. His rose paintings are especially appealing for both their beauty and their botanical accuracy, and betray more than a little of the influence of Redout&eacute;. <span class="italic">Perennial Garden Plants</span> (1976) and a trio of rose titles, <span class="italic">The Old Shrub Roses</span> (1955), <span class="italic">Shrub Roses of Today</span> (1962), and <span class="italic">Climbing Roses Old and New</span> (1965), found their way onto the shelves of every contemporary horticulturist and gardener worthy of the name. Honours inevitably flowed to him. The Royal Horticultural Society recognized Thomas's work with its Veitch memorial medal in 1966, followed two years later by its highest accolade, the Victoria medal of honour. The Rose Society, rather belatedly, awarded the Dean Hole memorial medal in 1976, and the National Trust its founders' award in 1996. He was appointed OBE in 1975. Inevitably too, plants were named in his honour, none better known or more appropriate than David Austin's rich golden yellow New English shrub rose, &#145;Graham Thomas&#146; (1983).<br>
<br>Graham Stuart Thomas (he was almost never known simply as Graham Thomas) was a rather shy, retiring, and private man, a self-effacing individual who wore his learning lightly. Slim and dapper, with a pinched face, and with his spectacles characteristically borne on a beaky nose, he followed his parents' inclinations in his fondness for music and was an accomplished singer. He never married. His last years were clouded by the onset of Parkinson's disease. He died on 16 April 2003 at the Nuffield Hospital, Shores Road, Woking, Surrey, of bronchopneumonia and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.<br>
