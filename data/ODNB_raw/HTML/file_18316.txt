<span class="headword">Masters,  Mary</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1733&#150;1755), <span class="occ">poet and letter-writer</span>, was born of humble parents who, by her admission, &#145;always brow-beat and discountenanc'd &hellip; her Genius to Poetry&#146;  (Masters, <span class="italic">Poems</span>, preface, A2), her father endeavouring &#145;to prevent [her] from acquiring the use of the Pen or a proper Pronunciation in Reading&#146;, since he maintained that &#145;Writing would only qualify [women] for intrigue&#146;  (Masters, <span class="italic">Familiar Letters</span>, 52&#150;3). Though &#145;ill-provided with the gifts of Fortune&#146;  (ibid., preface) she published two original volumes, <span class="italic">Poems on Several Occasions</span> (1733) and <span class="italic">Familiar Letters and Poems on Several Occasions</span> (1755), whose lengthy subscribers' lists, which included Elizabeth Carter, Hester Chapone, Samuel Johnson, Charlotte Lennox, John Newbery, Samuel Richardson, and Christopher Smart, show that Masters was well promoted within &eacute;lite literary networks. In fact such &#145;genteel&#146;  (Landry, 8) social connections mean that Masters, unlike Mary Collier, Mary Leapor, and Ann Yearsley, was not a typical plebeian poet. Despite Boswell's unsubstantiated claim that Johnson &#145;revised&#146; her volumes, &#145;illuminated here and there with a ray of his own genius&#146;  (Boswell, 8.241), Masters's work not only discloses whatever scant biographical information can be pieced together but conveys the mind of a determined, self-possessed woman. The biographical facts are oblique at best, glimpsed through hints of extended sojourns in various London households, Edward Cave's among them, and a period of residence in Derbyshire. The volumes, in effect, establish and confirm Masters's literary presence, their fleeting attention to geography notwithstanding. Her response to &#145;ingenious letters&#146; from the then elderly poet Jane Barker was praise of &#145;such Indications of the clearest Mind&#146; and &#145;such steady Sense&#146;  (Masters, <span class="italic">Poems</span>, 86&#150;7). Whether imitating Dryden or Horace, recommending to female correspondents books such as Francesco Algarotti's explications of Newton, or annotating her copy of poet and prose writer Elizabeth Rowe's work, Masters, as she justified herself to an intemperate <span class="italic">London Magazine</span> critic in the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> (April 1739), let her &#145;Themes themselves &hellip; for their Author plead&#146;  (Masters, <span class="italic">Familiar Letters</span>, 285).<br>
<br>These themes include the vagaries of courtship and marriage, women's intellectual equality, and the transformations and raptures of Christian charity. &#145;Never distrest [with] am'rous Cares&#146;, Masters did not marry, preferring &#145;a safe Part &hellip; out of the Snare&#146; of Cupid  (Masters, <span class="italic">Familiar Letters</span>, 219). However, in poems and prose letters she held forth on love, marriage, and childbirth, pointedly opposing the union of a foolish man and a witty woman, since &#145;those who are not Fools, will Fools despise&#146;, but approving the marriage of two minds where &#145;wit to Wit gives, mutually, Delight&#146;  (ibid., 193&#150;4). Convinced that &#145;Souls have no Sex&#146; Masters devoted several letters and poems to proto-feminist issues: the desire &#145;to rescue [her] Sex from so base a Slavery as some of them undergo who are Married to such as Delight to keep them in a mean Subjection&#146;  (ibid., 77), the asseveration that &#145;as I'm born, I will be, free&#146;  (ibid., 80), and the opinion that the intellectual &#145;difference between Men and Women &hellip; proceeds only from the difference in Education&#146;  (ibid., 313). Answering a female correspondent who argued for women's inferiority and for &#145;female poets fall[ing] short of Milton&#146; Masters contended that &#145;Female Authors have thoughts as sublime as his can possibly be&#146;, citing such exemplars of acumen and artistry as the biblical Deborah, the Socratic Diotima, Pope Joan, and Catherine the Great, along with Mary Astell, Alison Cockburn, and Elizabeth Rowe  (ibid., 313&#150;15). Both volumes, especially the first, show her expertise in blending humility and self-aggrandizement; an &#145;unletter'd Maid &hellip; wholly unpractis'd in the learned Rules&#146;, she insists that she writes &#145;simple Nature unimprov'd by Art&#146;, yet clings to &#145;distinguishing Defects to prove them Mine&#146;  (Masters, <span class="italic">Poems</span>, 45). From early childhood, during which she was particularly affected by the narrative of the friendship of David and Jonathan, the <span class="roman">Bible</span> provided a storehouse of allusion and metaphor. Masters's paraphrastic verse translations of several psalms garnered rhymed epistles from Thomas Scott, attesting that:<blockquote>
<div>the soft melodious Hebrew's Voice<br>
</div>
<div>In your sweet, echoing Notes rejoice.<br>
</div> (ibid., 231)</blockquote>Masters was also an adept imitator whose skill verged on parody. Her two-part extension of Thomas Gray's &#145;Ode on the Death of a Favourite Cat&#146;, aiming to comfort Selima's grieving young mistress, installs the favourite &#145;on Clio's Lap Divine&#146; with &#145;two snow-white cows&#146; attending to dispense &#145;Nectareous Milk of Taste and Hue&#146;, of which Selima &#145;has all the Cream&#146;  (Masters, <span class="italic">Familiar Letters</span>, 253&#150;6). Her response to Dryden's version of Catullus's berating of Lesbia for &#145;the Lechery of Deceit&#146; adroitly turns the tables&#151;in the manner of Christopher Marlowe's articulate nymph&#151;in its observation on the philandering of men, charmed by &#145;dear Variety&#146; and loving &#145;to range&#146;  (ibid., 89&#150;90). Like so many enigmas of her life, the place of Masters's death is unknown.<br>
