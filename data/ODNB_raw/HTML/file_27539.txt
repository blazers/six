<span class="headword">Tonneys,  John</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1514), <span class="occ">prior of the Austin friars, London, and grammarian</span>, was a native of Norfolk and received his early education at the Augustinian friary in Norwich. It was probably here that he entered the order. He is said by Blomefield to have become prior of the Norfolk house <i>c</i>.1478, but this date has been disputed. Tonneys prepared for the priesthood at the Oxford convent, and was ordained there on 25 May 1485. He was sent to Cambridge for his further education, and began his studies for the doctorate of divinity there in 1501&#150;2. On 16 July 1503 Tonneys was elected vicar-general of the English province for the next general chapter. In July 1505 he was elected prior provincial of the order for a three-year term. But although he was re-elected prior provincial for life in August 1508, in April 1510 he was forced to resign the <i>magisterium</i> by the prior-general, Egidio da Viterbo, on the grounds that he had accepted the office without permission, and contrary to the order's regulations.<br>
<br>Tonneys duly resigned and called for a new chapter, but by the end of 1510 his fortunes had turned. He was appointed vicar-general and &#145;reformer&#146; of the English province on 24 September, and was once more appointed prior provincial on 22 November. The prior-general also created a new position for him; Tonneys was made &#145;director of all houses of studies in England&#146;  (Roth, <span class="italic">English Austin Friars</span>, 129). He thereby became responsible for the appointment of regents and professors of both the <i>studia provincialia</i> and the <i>studia generalia</i>; he also had the authority to place student&#150;friars where he saw fit, and to compel their priors to pay for the students' upkeep. Tonneys's learning made him an appropriate choice for the position. He studied Greek, and Bale told Leland that he had seen a Greek letter by him. Bale attributes ten works to Tonneys, including sermons, lectures, letters, <i>collectanea</i>, verses, and <span class="italic">Rudimenta grammatices</span> said to have been printed by Richard Pynson; none of these is extant. In May 1513 Tonneys became prior of the Augustinian friary in London. He died in 1514 and was buried in his London convent. In the same year the prior-general decided that Tonneys's possessions should be given to the London convent. They included 100 pieces of silver, and in July 1522 an inquiry was held into their disposal&#151;the money had been spent without permission by Master Edmond Bellond, the convent's prior.<br>
