<span class="headword">Hayward,  Douglas Frederick Cornelius <span class="st"> [Doug]</span></span>  (1934&#150;2008), <span class="occ">tailor</span>, was born on 5 October 1934 at 12 Church Walk, Kensington, London, the younger son of Noel Westmacott Hayward (1897&#150;1968), electrical engineer, and his wife, Winifred Elliott, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Thurston (1905&#150;1984). He came from a working-class background (his father worked in the boiler room at the BBC before cycling to a London transport depot to wash buses; his mother worked in a munitions factory during the Second World War) and grew up in Hayes, Middlesex. He won a scholarship to Southall grammar school. He was a talented footballer and took a trial for Middlesex county football team but was unsuccessful. After leaving school at fifteen he was apprenticed to a tailor in Shepherd's Bush Green, west London. Following his apprenticeship he did two years' national service in the Royal Navy.<br>
<br>On his return to civilian life Hayward rejoined his former employer, whose premises were located close to Shepherd's Bush Theatre and the BBC studio at Lime Grove, giving Hayward his first contact with actors, who later formed his core clientele. On 4 October 1958, at the parish church in Ickenham, Middlesex, he married Diana Mary Smith, a twenty-year-old secretary, and daughter of Robert Scott Smith, accountant. Through his sister-in-law Melissa Smith (the actress Melissa Stribling), who was married to the film director Basil Dearden, Hayward attracted new clients, retaining their business when he went into partnership with Dimitrio Major, a tailor in Fulham Road, west London, with a similar clientele. The firm of Major Hayward offered skilfully cut, well-made suits whose flattering, fluid shapes suited the lifestyles of its young customers. Determined to work in the West End, Hayward left to set up his own business in Pall Mall in 1963. Clients such as the actor Terence Stamp followed him and in 1967 he upgraded his premises to a four-floor property at 95 Mount Street, Mayfair, where he lived on the first floor. As well as bespoke tailoring, the shop offered a range of shirts, sweaters, ties, and dressing gowns, known as &#145;Hayward Classics&#146;, luggage, hand-made shoes, and wrist watches. His customers, who were mostly young and successful, came from the worlds of art, media, sport, and business. He offered them, and their wives and girlfriends, a relaxed and convivial alternative to the class-conscious formality of Savile Row. In spite of his alternative approach to the business of bespoke tailor, his skills were highly rated by his fellow tailors. In 1965 he was the only non-establishment tailor to be recommended by the society magazine <span class="italic">Queen</span> in its &#145;Society Index&#146;.<br>
<br>During the 1960s Hayward helped to redefine the classic man's suit. As a tailor and not, he emphasized, a fashion designer, his aim was to create a suit that made its wearer appear, and feel, slim, relaxed, and comfortable. He described his customers as looking &#145;a mixture of smart but scruffy in suits that are beautifully made&#146;  (Ross, 125). The suits he created for films brought his aesthetic to a wider audience. He dressed Terence Stamp in <span class="italic">Modesty Blaise</span> (1966), Michael Caine in <span class="italic">The Italian Job</span> (1969), and Roger Moore in <span class="italic">For Your Eyes Only</span> (1981) and <span class="italic">A View to Kill</span> (1985). Many of his clients became lifelong friends, including Caine and the photographers Patrick Lichfield, with whom he set up Burke's dining club in Clifford Street, Mayfair, in 1969, and Terry O'Neill, who was a regular member of Hayward's amateur football team, the Mount Street Marchers' Social Club. His first marriage having been dissolved, on 31 December 1970, at Westminster register office, Hayward married Glenys Marjorie Evans, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Roberts, a 31-year-old journalist (as Glenys Roberts) and daughter of Stanley Roberts, bank manager. Their daughter Polly was born in 1970. The marriage was dissolved in 1978 and Hayward subsequently had a relationship with the journalist Janet Street-Porter (<i>b</i>. 1946).<br>
<br>According to Audie Charles, Hayward's office manager from 1967, his<blockquote>knack was to give a man a suit he could put on and forget about, knowing he looked good. He didn't want anyone to say, there goes a Hayward suit; he wanted you to know the man looked good but you weren't sure why. (Ross, 126)</blockquote>He was also admired for his personal qualities and John Le Carr&eacute; drew on his character and appearance when creating Henry Pendel for his novel <span class="italic">The Tailor of Panama</span> (1996). Hayward valued his privacy and independence but was a discreet and attentive listener whom many called upon for advice. He was also an amusing raconteur, bon viveur, and womanizer. In later life he moved seamlessly between his working-class roots and high society, singing Cole Porter duets with Princess Margaret in Mustique and organizing down-to-earth parties of the kind he had enjoyed as a child.<br>
<br>Hayward's success and personal popularity attracted customers from a wide social spectrum, with businessmen predominating towards the end of his career. He advised Ralph Lauren on his Purple Label menswear line, which was launched in 1994, and lectured on tailoring at the Royal College of Art. In 2006 his daughter Polly took over her father's business because of his failing health. He nevertheless continued to live at 95 Mount Street (and also had a country property near Henley). He died on 26 April 2008 at Meadbank Hospice, 12 Parkgate Road, Battersea, London, from bronchopneumonia and vascular dementia. Although an agnostic he received the last rites from a Roman Catholic priest. The company Douglas Hayward went into administration in 2009, and was purchased by a newly formed company, Mount Street Tailors.<br>
