<span class="headword">McGonagall,  William</span>  (<em>c.</em>1825&#150;1902), <span class="occ">poet and actor</span>, was born in Edinburgh, the fifth child of Charles McGonagall, a migrant Irish cotton weaver, and his wife, Margaret Maxwell. The family settled eventually in Dundee where William McGonagall also became a hand-loom weaver. On 11 July 1846 he married Jean King of Edinburgh; they had seven children. McGonagall was largely self-taught. He was passionately fond of Shakespeare and at about the age of twenty began his career as an amateur actor in the role of Macbeth. He went on to appear in minor parts in the wood-and-canvas &#145;penny gaffs&#146; and to give public recitations wherever he could find a paying audience.<br>
<br>It was not until his early fifties that McGonagall was seized with &#145;a strong desire to write poetry&#146;  (McGonagall, <span class="italic">Poetic Gems</span>, 6&#150;7). His first efforts were published in the Dundee edition of one of the leading Scottish popular papers, the <span class="italic">Weekly News</span>. He soon established his characteristic manner, with such pieces as &#145;The Famous Tay Whale&#146; and &#145;The Tay Bridge Disaster&#146; which remain among the best-known of all his poems. He wrote about battles, fires, shipwrecks, and disasters; processions and shows; and the deaths of public men. There were verses about tourist spots, and watering holes; heroic deeds from Scottish history, and the superior qualities of Sunlight Soap; poems in praise of temperance and love and nature; and a number of quite unsingable songs. Much of what he described he cannot possibly have seen: recycled material from newspaper columns was conjured into rhyme by an uncertain practitioner whose foremost need was to feed himself and his family.<br>
<br>McGonagall's diction was drawn from the high fustian of Scottish popular melodrama, and his metre from the printed poetry of the street. His control of tone was erratic, fluctuating between the lofty and bathetic, and his imagery was frequently conventional. The predominant tone was gloomily fatalistic, focusing on man's ceaseless struggle with malignant natural forces, and the manifold perils of existence. If he had been merely inept, of course, he would simply have been forgotten, like countless other proletarian versifiers. McGonagall's triumph was to forge, by some unfathomable alchemy, the commonplace effects of popular-print rhetoric into an unmistakably personal style. Nobody else has ever sounded quite like him. And he had positive strengths: a sense of wonder, a childlike ability to enter absolutely into what he depicted, and a real gift for narrative that could shape appropriate material into racy little verse-novellas with a rough but genuine graphic power.<br>
<br>As the weaving trade declined, McGonagall struggled to make a living selling his poems in the streets, and performing in music-halls and pubs. These tended to be anarchic places and he often found his audiences disruptive. The writer William Power saw him in the Albion Halls in Glasgow:<blockquote>He wore a Highland dress of Rob Roy tartan and boy's size. After reciting some of his own poems, to an accompaniment of whistles and cat-calls, the Bard armed himself with a most dangerous-looking broadsword, and strode up and down the platform, declaiming &hellip; &#145;Give me another horse!&#151;Bind up my wounds!&#146; His voice rose to a howl. He thrust and slashed at imaginary foes. A shower of apples and oranges fell on the platform. Almost before they touched it, they were met by the fell edge of McGonagall's claymore and cut to pieces. The Bard was beaded with perspiration and orange juice. (Power, 285)</blockquote>A number of strands of Scottish popular culture came together in McGonagall&#151;the bellowing street-corner elocutionists, the urban broadsheet and song-slip patterers, the penny readings, which mixed entertainment with self-improvement, and, most of all, perhaps, a line of genuinely popular poetry. He was the heir not of Burns and Hogg and Lady Nairne, but of chapbook writers such as Claudero and Dougal Graham, and through them a tradition of metrical journalism going back to the broadside poets of the seventeenth century. An estimated 200,000 people were regularly writing poetry in Victorian Scotland and they found their main publication outlet in the burgeoning popular press of which the <span class="italic">Weekly News</span> was an outstanding example. It was there that &#145;the Great McGonagall&#146; found much of his inspiration; there too his work first appeared in print, while the journal's heartless chronicling of his many mishaps kept him steadily before the public eye as a potential butt and object of ridicule. Unable to endure relentless persecution by local audiences, he moved briefly to Perth, and then, in 1895, to Edinburgh. As a performer of his own works he enjoyed a national reputation in Scotland but he was unable to secure engagements in the music-halls of London or New York. William McGonagall died of a cerebral haemorrhage at his home, 5 South College Street, Edinburgh, on 29 September 1902. He was buried in Greyfriars kirkyard, Edinburgh, in a pauper's grave, but a plaque was later erected to his memory there.<br>
