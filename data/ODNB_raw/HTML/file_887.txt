<span class="headword">Aubrey,  William</span>  (<em>c.</em>1529&#150;1595), <span class="occ">civil lawyer</span>, was born at Cantref in Brecknockshire, the second son of Thomas Aubrey, of an old Brecknockshire family, and his wife, Agnes, daughter of Thomas Vaughan. After attending what would become Christ College, Brecon, he was educated at Oxford University, and became a fellow of All Souls (1547), BCL (1549), principal of New Inn Hall (1550), professor of civil law (1553), and DCL (16 August 1554). At about this time he married Wilgiford, daughter of John Williams of Tainton, Oxfordshire. He became a master in chancery in 1555, and was admitted an advocate of the court of arches (9 January 1556) and to Doctors' Commons five days later. In 1557 he went with William Herbert, earl of Pembroke, as judge-advocate on the St Quentin expedition. Having discharged the duties of his Oxford chair by deputies, Aubrey was permitted by Queen Elizabeth to alienate it to John Griffith (23 February 1559). The antiquary John Aubrey, the civil lawyer's great-grandson, records that he was beloved of the queen, who called him &#145;her little doctor&#146;, and he served on Archbishop Parker's commission (1562) which declared unlawful Lady Katherine Grey's marriage to the earl of Hertford, a case involving questions relating to the royal succession. Entering parliament&#151;perhaps through Pembroke's patronage&#151;he was MP for Carmarthen Boroughs (1554), Brecon (1558), Hindon (1559), Arundel (1563), and Taunton (1592). He became treasurer of Doctors' Commons in 1573, and complained in 1576 that half the advocates had insufficient work to make a living.<br>
<br>Having a considerable reputation in international and constitutional matters, in 1571 Aubrey signed the opinion that John Leslie, bishop of Ross and ambassador of Mary, queen of Scots, was triable in England for intriguing against Queen Elizabeth. His maritime decisions during the war with Spain had important international connotations. This expertise is manifest in the letter to his neighbour and kinsman John Dee, concerning the latter's <span class="italic">Soveraigntie of the Sea</span>. He maintained that the proceedings of the high commission were warranted by canon law and not merely by the statute of 1559. He served on the council in the marches of Wales from 1586.<br>
<br>Auditor and vicar-general of the province of Canterbury under Archbishop Grindal, Aubrey wrote an opinion for him on the reform of the church courts. On Grindal's sequestration he became joint administrator (1577) and then sole vicar-general (1582), retaining the office under Archbishop Whitgift after 1583. Opposed to puritanism and Brownism in church and university (1587&#150;90), he participated in the condemnation of his distant relative John Penry in 1593. A master of requests with Sir John Herbert from 1590, in 1592 he became judge of audience in the court of Canterbury.<br>
<br>Aubrey acquired extensive estates in Brecon and south Wales by purchase and royal grant. He died in London on 25 June 1595 and was buried in old St Paul's on 24 July, a bas-relief monument showing him surrounded by his three sons and six daughters, one of whom married Daniel Dun. The memorial described him as &#145;a man of exquisite erudition, singular prudence and great courtesy&#146;, but John Aubrey thought the figure too big, a picture he possessed showing &#145;a delicate, quick, lively, and piercing black eie, a severe eie browe, and a fresh complexioun&#146;  (<span class="italic">Brief Lives</span>, 60).<br>
<br>Aubrey's cousin <a name="cosubject_68191"></a><span class="headword">William Aubrey</span>  (1562&#150;1626)<span class="occ"></span>, second son of Richard Aubrey of Abercynrig in Brecknockshire, followed his illustrious relative into the civil law. He entered Christ Church, Oxford, on 20 November 1581, and graduated BA (22 January 1583) and MA (20 May 1586). He graduated BCL and DCL on 9 July 1597, having been proctor for the year commencing 26 April 1593. Admitted an advocate of the court of arches in 1599, he did not become a full member of Doctors' Commons until 1611, remaining in practice until 1622. Elected MP for Cardigan in 1601, he never took his seat owing to a dispute concerning the election. He was a commissioner for criminal causes in admiralty in Cornwall (1601), south-west Wales (1609), and Middlesex (1614), and a commissioner for piracy in London (1614) and Carmarthen (1616). A JP for Brecon, and chancellor of St David's (1614&#150;26), he married twice, the second time in 1611, his second wife being Anne Bailey, a gentleman's widow of Broxbourne in Hertfordshire where they subsequently lived. He died in 1626.<br>
