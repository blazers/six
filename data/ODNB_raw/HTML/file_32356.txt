<span class="headword">Chamier,  Stephen Henry Edward</span>  (1834&#150;1910), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was born in Madras on 17 August 1834, of Huguenot descent, the fifth son of Henry Chamier of Upton Park, Slough, chief secretary to the Madras government and afterwards member of council, 1843&#150;8, and his wife, Marie Antoinette Evelina, daughter of Thomas Thursby of the East India Company. His grandfather, Jean Ez&eacute;chiel Deschamps Chamier, was also a member of the Madras council. Captain Frederick Chamier was an uncle.<br>
<br>Educated at Cheltenham College and Addiscombe, Chamier was appointed on 11 June 1853 second-lieutenant in the Madras artillery, and joined artillery headquarters at St Thomas Mount on 8 October 1853. Posted to the 1st battery in March 1854, he went to Burma in July 1854. After commanding an outpost of artillery at Sittang on 3 August 1854, he was appointed station staff officer there on 16 November 1854. On 11 April 1856 he went on field service to the Karen hills in command of a mountain train of howitzers and rockets, and was engaged with hill Karens on 22 April.<br>
<br>After commanding B battery horse artillery for a few months at Bangalore, Chamier went in May 1857 to Madras <i>en route</i> for Burma, but following the news of the mutiny at Meerut he went with Major Cotter's horse battery to Calcutta and from there to Benares and Allahabad. Detached to Gopiganj with two guns and some infantry, he disarmed a part of the Bengal native infantry. Proceeding to Mirzapur and on towards Rewah, he held the Katra Pass, where he was joined by a Madras regiment and C battery Madras artillery, and was given command of a battery. Ordered to Cawnpore to aid General Windham's operations against the Gwalior contingent, the force was continuously engaged for three days, with heavy loss; of thirty-six men with Chamier's guns seventeen were killed or wounded. Chamier was thanked in dispatches. He also took part on 8 December 1857 in the rout of the Gwalior contingent mutineers by Sir Colin Campbell in the vicinity of Cawnpore.<br>
<br>At his own request Chamier, in February 1858, rejoined Major Cotter's horse battery and marched with General Franks from Benares through Oudh to Lucknow, engaging on the way in the actions of Chanda, Amirpur, Sultanpur, and various skirmishes. At Lucknow Chamier joined the 5th division of the army under Lord Clyde, and took part in the operations before and during the siege and capture of the city. After its fall Chamier's battery joined the force which went under Major-General Lugard to the relief of Azamgarh, being engaged against Kunwar Singh's rebel force and against other rebels near Jagdispur and Arrah. In June 1858 the campaign, during which, according to artillery orders, Chamier was engaged in nineteen actions, came to a close.<br>
<br>In September 1858 Lord Canning, the governor-general, appointed Chamier commandant of the 1st artillery battery, Hyderabad contingent. He was promoted second captain on 29 February 1864 and brevet major on 11 October 1864 for his actions in the field. After commanding a battery of horse artillery at home from 1872 to 1876, he was, on promotion to regimental lieutenant-colonel, put in command of two batteries at Barrackpore. From 1877 to 1881 he was deputy inspector-general and from 1881 to 1886 inspector-general of ordnance, Madras. During his tenure expeditions were sent to Malta, Afghanistan, and Upper Burma, and he received the thanks of the Madras government and of the viceroy. He retired in October 1886 with the rank of lieutenant-general, being made CB (1886) for his services during the Indian mutiny and receiving the reward for distinguished service. On 4 September 1858 Chamier married, at Dinapore, Dora Louisa, daughter of George Tyrrell MD, of Banbridge, co. Down, Ireland, and they had six daughters and three sons. Chamier was a good musician and played the violoncello. He graduated MusB of Trinity College, Dublin, in 1874. He was a fellow of the Huguenot Society. He died after a long illness at his residence, Brooke House, Camberley, on 9 June 1910. His wife survived him with two daughters and one son, George Daniel, lieutenant-colonel of the Royal Artillery.<br>
