<span class="headword">Binnie,  Geoffrey Morse</span>  (1908&#150;1989), <span class="occ">civil engineer</span>, was born in Kensington on 13 November 1908, the youngest of three brothers. His mother was Ethel Morse (1871&#150;1947). His father, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/31889/', "William James Eames Binnie (1867&#150;1949)")</script>, and grandfather, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/31888/', "Sir Alexander Richardson Binnie")</script>, were both distinguished engineers who together, in 1902, founded the firm of consulting engineers which evolved into Binnie &amp; Partners. He was educated at Charterhouse and read for the mechanical sciences tripos at Trinity Hall, Cambridge. Binnie then served as pupil to a distinguished Swiss engineer, H. E. Gruner, working on hydro-electric projects, and in the testing laboratory of R. Haefeli, attending selected lectures at the Eidgenossische Technische Hochschule, Z&uuml;rich.<br>
<br>Binnie joined the family firm in 1932, working for four years on the Gorge Dam (Jubilee Dam) project for water supply in Hong Kong. He was taken into partnership on 1 January 1939. On the outbreak of war that year he volunteered for the Royal Engineers, seeing service in Abyssinia, Iran, and Iraq. At the end of the war in 1945 he returned to his firm which, after reduction to a small core, returned to the undertaking of major projects. The two principal projects associated with Binnie are Dokan Dam in Iraq and Mangla Dam in Pakistan. With the concrete arch design of the Dokan Dam, which was begun in 1948, Binnie introduced a technology unfamiliar to Britain and stimulated numerical methods of analysis not previously applied to such a structure. When Binnie was commissioned in 1957 to direct the planning, design, and construction of the Mangla Dam, this was the largest single project undertaken by a consulting engineer. Despite several serious problems the dam was completed in 1967, a year ahead of schedule.<br>
<br>Binnie retired in 1972 but continued to work as a consultant until 1981. He was a vice-president of the Institution of Civil Engineers in 1970&#150;72 (his father and grandfather had been president in 1938 and 1905 respectively), and was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1975 and a founder fellow of the Fellowship of Engineering in 1976.<br>
<br>Binnie suffered partial deafness from birth, a disability which intensified with age. He recalled with gratitude those who, particularly in his early years, helped him to surmount this handicap. He was married first in 1932 to Yanina Parycko, a refugee from Poland, who travelled widely with Binnie and contributed to his outstanding concern for the welfare of staff and their families on major projects in remote areas. She died following a long illness in 1964, leaving a son and a daughter. During retirement, Binnie developed an interest in the history of dams, encouraged by his second wife, Elspeth Maud Cicely Thompson (<i>d</i>. 1987), a historian whom he married in 1964. He is remembered as a sociable, considerate, thoughtful man who never lost his sense of fun. He lived at St Michael's Lodge, Benenden, Kent, and died after a heart attack at Benenden, on 5 April 1989.<br>
