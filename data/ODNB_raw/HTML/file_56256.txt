<span class="headword">Tuke <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Lear]</span>,  Mabel Kate</span>  (1871&#150;1962), <span class="occ">suffragette</span>, was born on 19 May 1871 at 40 Crescent Road, Plumstead, Kent, the third of the six children, and the eldest of three daughters, of Richard Lear (1834&#150;1894), clerk of works in the Royal Engineers department at Woolwich arsenal, and his wife, Emma Margaret, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Lear (<i>b</i>. 1836). Both her parents had been born in Alverstoke in Hampshire and were probably cousins. Nothing is known of the type of education Mabel Lear enjoyed; after it ended she does not appear to have had any paid occupation.<br>
<br>The Lear family lived for some of the years of Mabel's youth in Lichfield, Staffordshire, but by 1891 had returned to Plumstead, where on 25 February 1895, two months after the death of her father, she married James Quarton Braidwood, a gas engineer. Nothing can be traced of the fate of this marriage; it was presumably ended, possibly in South Africa, by the death of her husband. In 1901 she married, probably in South Africa, George Moxley Tuke, a captain in the South African constabulary. He, too, died young, however, and in 1905 Mabel Tuke returned to England. In the course of this voyage she got to know of Frederick and Emmeline Pethick-Lawrence. It was through a growing friendship with the latter, who held her interest with a description of her work with the Esp&eacute;rance Girls' Club in Somers Town, that she was introduced to the embryonic London branch of the Women's Social and Political Union, the organization that had been formed in Manchester in 1903 by Emmeline Pankhurst to lobby for women's enfranchisement. From 1906 until the outbreak of war in 1914 Mabel Tuke was the honorary secretary of the WSPU, in titular charge of its head office in Clement's Inn. She was particularly close to Christabel and Emmeline Pankhurst, to whom she was affectionately known as Pansy, a nickname obviously inspired by her luminous dark eyes. Beautiful, soft, and appealing, she represented the &#145;womanly&#146; image that the Pankhursts were keen to promote in order to counteract the popular conception of the suffragettes. She was not involved in any of the WSPU's militant activities until, on 1 March 1912, with Emmeline Pankhurst, she went to Downing Street and threw a stone through the window of no. 10. For this she received a sentence of three weeks' imprisonment and while in Holloway was charged with conspiracy, along with Christabel and Emmeline Pankhurst and the Pethick-Lawrences. She was, however, dismissed from the case on 4 April.<br>
<br>On 15 June, with the leaders of the WSPU in prison or, in the case of Christabel Pankhurst, in Paris, Mabel Tuke took the chair at a triumphant WSPU fund-raising meeting in the Albert Hall. From prison Emmeline Pethick-Lawrence wrote to her that Mr Marshall, the WSPU's solicitor, had told her that he &#145;could not believe that you were not a practised orator and chairman. Said he had never been at a meeting more brilliantly conducted&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 58226, fol. 2). Tuke had never been strong, however, and after this experience her health deteriorated and in the autumn, after the Pethick-Lawrences had been expelled from the WSPU, she embarked on a recuperative sea journey to South Africa. On her return she frequently visited Christabel Pankhurst in Paris, and remained a loyal friend to the Pankhursts after they had ceased their involvement with the suffrage cause. In 1925 she took part, with Emmeline and Christabel Pankhurst, in an ill-fated scheme to run a tea-shop (the English Tea-Shop of Good Hope) at Juan-les-Pins on the French riviera. Mrs Tuke provided most of the capital and did the baking. In later life she lived in the care of her nephew the Revd Alban Prentice at Shadforth in co. Durham. She died of cerebral thrombosis in Ashbrooke Nursing Home, 12 St John's Road, Nevilles Cross, Durham, on 22 November 1962.<br>
