<span class="headword">Culpeper,  Edmund</span>  (<em>c.</em>1670&#150;1737), <span class="occ">scientific instrument maker</span>, was born in Tarrant Gunville, Dorset, the son of Edward Culpeper, rector of that parish, a former servitor at Merton College, Oxford, who took his BA from Merton in 1658. Edmund Culpeper and the herbalist and astrologer Nicholas Culpeper were probably related, being descended from junior branches of the Culpeper (or Colepeper) family, a large, wealthy, landed family in Kent and Sussex.<br>
<br>In 1684 Culpeper was apprenticed in the Grocers' Company to Walter Hayes, engraver and mathematical instrument maker of Moorfields, London. By 1700 he had taken over his master's shop at the Cross Daggers, Middle Moorfields, and this was given as his address in various advertisements from 1707 to 1731, an address emblematically represented on his trade card. In 1710 he was visited by the noted German traveller Conrad von Uffenbach, who sought out the most eminent instrument makers in London. Rather curiously Culpeper did not become a freeman until 1714; he must have decided to do so because he took on an apprentice the day after he was freed. Culpeper was famous for his optical instruments, especially microscopes, but was also known for a wide variety of mathematical instruments in silver, brass, ivory, and wood, although it is difficult to determine at what point he moved from being a maker to a retailer.<br>
<br>Culpeper was a skilled engraver and there is a memorial brass by him, dated 1694, for Dorothy Williams in Pimperne church, Dorset. Other early examples of his work are a woodblock engraving of a trencher design dated 1687, when he was still an apprentice, and a fine gilt-brass horizontal sundial signed &#145;E. C.&#146;, probably made for his sweetheart, as it has engraved underneath an interlaced geometrical pattern inscribed &#145;Ann Porteman. This is a True Loves Knot for Thou Cans Part it not 1687&#146;.<br>
<br>Culpeper married by licence on 10 January 1705 Judith Gunn, who survived him. Their son Edmund became free, by patrimony, of the Grocers' Company in 1758. Indeed three generations of Culpepers joined this guild, as the younger Edmund's son John Chandler Culpeper in turn became his father's apprentice in the following year. Both Edmunds may also have been members of the Spectaclemakers' Company.<br>
<br>Culpeper achieved fame by giving his name to a certain type of tripod microscope made in the early eighteenth century, but it is not at all clear that he was its inventor. He was making the screw-barrel microscope invented by James Wilson from at least 1700. In 1710 he advertised &#145;several sorts of new contrived Microscopes &hellip; I may boldly say, no one but my self in the Kingdom has the like variety of 'em&#146;, but his characteristic works are his engravings of scales, dials, and sectors. By the time of his death, on 14 May 1737 at his house in Moorfields, he was trading &#145;Near the Royal Exchange&#146;. He was buried in St Paul's Churchyard, as recorded in the parish register of St Faith's under St Paul.<br>
