<span class="headword">Falconer,  Thomas</span>  (1771&#150;1839), <span class="occ">classical scholar</span>, was born on 24 December 1771 in Duke Street, Bath, the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9118/', "William Falconer, MD, FRS")</script>, of Bath, and Henrietta, daughter of Thomas Edmunds of Worsborough Hall, Yorkshire. He was educated at the cathedral school in Chester, Bath grammar school, Manchester grammar school, the King's School in Chester, and Corpus Christi College, Oxford. He was a precocious boy, and some of his verses were published in <span class="italic">Prolusiones poeticae</span> (1788). He was elected a scholar of Corpus in 1788, and graduated BA in 1791 and MA in 1795. He was elected a fellow in November 1794, vacating his fellowship after his marriage on 7 December 1797 to Frances, daughter of Lieutenant-Colonel Robert Raitt, with whom he had six sons and five daughters. After taking holy orders he spent some time in Edinburgh studying medicine. He took the degrees of MB and MD in Oxford in 1822, but never practised medicine, nor did he ever do any ordinary clerical duty apart from a short curacy in Bath. His lack of preferment may have been caused by his liking for controversy: he quarrelled with the bishop of Salisbury and turned down at least one living.<br>
<br>Falconer's love of argument and wide but disorganized intellectual interests are evident from his works. Many of his published sermons, including the eight Oxford Bampton lectures entitled <span class="italic">Certain Principles in Evanson's &#145;Dissonance of the Four Generally Received Evangelists&#146; etc.</span> (1811), deal critically with the views of others, although his time in Edinburgh made him sympathetic to the ideas of nonconformists.<br>
<br>Falconer's classical work lay chiefly in the field of ancient geography. In 1797 he published <span class="italic">The Voyage of Hanno, Translated and Accompanied with the Greek Text and Dissertations</span>, and he left a manuscript translation of Strabo which was later completed by his son <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9119/', "William Falconer")</script>. With his father he also wrote a <span class="italic">Discourse on the Measure of the Olympic Stadium</span> (1805) which was appended to his father's translation of Arrian's <span class="italic">Periplus</span>.<br>
<br>Although Falconer was not a particularly distinguished scholar, he was unlucky that his edition of Strabo became notorious through a review by Payne Knight in the <span class="italic">Edinburgh Review</span> of July 1809 which formed a famous attack on Oxford and its scholarship. Falconer's elegantly produced two-volume folio edition was published by the Oxford University Press in 1807. It was based on material left by his uncle Thomas Falconer (1738&#150;1792). The first two books had been seen through the press by Dr Parsons, master of Balliol College, and five more had been edited by the Revd Henry Halliwell of Brasenose College, Oxford. The edition was described by Knight as a &#145;ponderous monument of operose ignorance and vain expense&#146;. His criticisms of Falconer and Oxford learning were answered by a series of lengthy <span class="italic">Replies</span> by Edward Copleston (later provost of Oriel) which form an important&#151;if at times complacent&#151;apologia for Oxford education. Copleston's vigorous defence produced a personal letter of thanks from the chancellor and the conferring on him of the degree of DD by diploma.<br>
<br>Falconer's edition hardly deserves the vehemence of Payne Knight's attack. Although the text is reprinted from Almeloveen's edition (itself a reprint of Casaubon's), Falconer senior had assembled a wide and valuable array of variant readings which proved very helpful to later editors. His manuscript (preserved in the Bodleian Library) contains collations made by several European scholars of manuscripts of Strabo from foreign libraries, including Paris, Florence, Madrid, and Moscow.<br>
<br>Falconer died at his home in The Circus, Bath, on 19 February 1839. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9116/', "Thomas Falconer (1805&#150;1882)")</script>, the county court judge, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9113/', "Randle Wilbraham Falconer (1816&#150;1881)")</script>, the physician, were his sons, and John Arthur Roebuck, the radical politician, was his son-in-law.<br>
