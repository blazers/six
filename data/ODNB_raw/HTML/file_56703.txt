<span class="headword">Jarvis,  Edward  Kem</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1805, <em>d.</em> 1853), <span class="occ">judge and philanthropist</span>, was baptized on 15 March 1805 at Ratcliffe Culey parish church, Hinckley, Leicestershire, the only child of Joseph Jarviss (<i>fl</i>. 1785&#150;1830), Atherstone postmaster and innkeeper, and his wife, Mary (<i>fl</i>. 1785&#150;1810), daughter of John Sands, publican, of Congerstone, and his wife, Melinda. Jarvis's parents were midlanders. The Jarvis ancestry included the parliamentarian Purefoy (later Jervis) family of Caldecote (Warwickshire) and Fenny Drayton (Leicestershire) and Swynfen Jervis, the ancestor of the earls of St Vincent. His first two names acknowledge the benefaction and bequest left to his father, Joseph, by Edward Kem (<i>d</i>. 1800), yeoman of Attleborough and Armitage, who could trace his origins back to the Northumbrian D'Umfrevilles and Talboys as well as Baron De Kyme of Lincolnshire [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/56700/', "Kem, Joseph")</script>].<br>
<br>Jarvis's early life is unknown: he may have been educated at the locally endowed Queen Elizabeth Grammar School before moving to Hinckley in 1819. In 1826 he joined the legal practice of Charles Jervis (a distant relative whose business was established before 1800). On 16 September 1828 he married Rebecca Brown, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Tomlinson (<i>b</i>. 1791), a blind widow. From 1829 Jarvis's name appeared annually in the <span class="italic">Law List</span> as a solicitor. By 1838 he was listed as clerk to the Hinckley magistrates' court and parish auditor. His chief claim to fame derives from his meticulous and thought-provoking evidence to the royal commission into the conditions of the frame-work knitters in 1844. In hosiery's &#145;golden age&#146; (1781&#150;1811), Hinckley had contributed 2400 pairs of stockings for British troops on the continent in 1793. But the industry was very vulnerable to market changes, and by 1829, 66 per cent of the town's people were on poor relief. By the time the commission's report was published Leicestershire's hosiery goods were uncompetitive in their traditional foreign markets because of the progressive American and German manufacturers.<br>
<br>Jarvis's evidence stated that he had been one of two or three local manufacturers who did not practise the pernicious truck system of payment of workers in kind, often in goods of inferior quality. He had set up his own knitting company where no frame rents or standing charges were levied, and even offered his workers stone breaking in the slack times, but their hands were too soft from the intricate loomwork. The project failed because local frame-work knitters disliked the regular routine of his factory. Jarvis also told of how he had called various meetings to set up local funds to help suppress the &#145;truck&#146;. His evidence also provided details of the profiteering devices adopted by other local manufacturers. As a lawyer, Jarvis was litigious and resourceful and by 1846 his outstanding ability saw him promoted to judge of Hinckley and Market Bosworth. As a judge, he disliked imprisoning first-time offenders, preferring to fine the truck operator &pound;5 for a first offence, and &pound;10 for the second before invoking his powers of incarceration. By 1851 he had been made a perpetual commissioner for the poor.<br>
<br>On 1 January 1853 Jarvis died of a heart attack at his home, 4 The Borough, Hinckley; he was buried in a vault beneath the floor of St Mary's Church, Hinckley, on 7 January. A shield-shaped brass plaque with the initials EKJ was affixed to the wall near the bell-tower entrance. His will records investments, cattle, real estate, and property in Hinckley, Barwell, and Burbage, which he left to his wife.<br>
