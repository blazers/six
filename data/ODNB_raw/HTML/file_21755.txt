<span class="headword">Peddie,  James</span>  (1759&#150;1845), <span class="occ">minister of the Secession church</span>, was born in Perth on 10 February 1759, the only surviving son of James Peddie, brewer, and his second wife, Ann Rattray. He was educated at the grammar school in Perth, spending some time with a private tutor before attending Perth Academy. At fifteen he joined a local religious society which met for prayer and scripture reading. In 1775 Peddie entered Edinburgh University, where he was influenced by the moral philosophers Adam Ferguson and Dugald Stewart. Two years later he left the university to attend the Secession Divinity Hall in Haddington where John Brown (1722&#150;1787) had been appointed the theological tutor. Prompted by Locke's thinking on religious toleration Peddie began to question the statement from the Westminster confession of faith concerning the power of the civil magistrate in enforcing religion on society. Peddie was licensed as preacher of the gospel on 6 February 1782 and became minister of the Bristo Street meeting-house, Edinburgh, on 3 April the following year. His election came after a period of considerable controversy within the congregation which eventually divided, the minority building a second church in Rose Street in 1786. Peddie remained as minister of Bristo Street for the remainder of his life.<br>
<br>In May 1795 a proposal came before the synod permitting ministers to disagree with the Westminster confession's statement concerning the power of civil magistrates in religious matters. The Enlightenment ethos, with its encouragement of the right to freedom of enquiry and conscience, led many within the Secession movement to object to civil government's association with a single form of Christian faith. Peddie and other leading theologians of the New Light school advocated this liberal view. In 1799 the synod allowed ministers and elders to adopt divergent opinions on the issue at their ordination, although a minority of Old Light supporters broke away to form the Original Burgher Presbytery until it was united with the Church of Scotland in 1839.<br>
<br>In 1799 the Church of Scotland minister William Porteous accused the New Light Associate Synod of adopting principles of freedom and liberty that were influenced by the French Revolution. Peddie responded to Porteous in his <span class="italic">A Defence of the Associate Synod Against the Charge of Sedition</span>, which gained much praised from Dugald Stewart for its clarity and vigour, and as one of the &#145;most masterly pieces of classical sarcasm in our language&#146;  (J. Kay, <span class="italic">A Review of Original Portraits and Caricature Etchings</span>, ed. H. Paton, 2 vols., 1838, 2.352). Peddie also communicated his defence of the synod to the prime minister, William Pitt, with the effect that Henry Dundas expressed his confidence in the patriotism of these &#145;loyal citizens&#146;. This defence of the synod followed several earlier publications for which Peddie had also been commended. In November 1788 he preached two sermons on the anniversary of the revolution of 1688 which praised the events of 1688&#150;9 for delivering the nation from civil oppression, ecclesiastical tyranny, and &#145;popish superstition&#146;. Both sermons were published a year later as <span class="italic">The Revolution the Work of God, and a Cause of Joy</span>. John Erskine, leader of the popular party of the Church of Scotland, claimed that of all the commentaries on the centenary of the revolution only Peddie's &#145;pleased my taste&#146;  (Erskine to Charles Nisbet, 21 April 1789, in S. Miller, <span class="italic">Memoir of the Rev. Charles Nisbet</span>, New York, 1840, 196). However, Peddie's stance also put him at odds with some Anti-Burgher seceders, such as Archibald Bruce, who believed that churches should not celebrate secular events. A prolific author, Peddie's other significant titles include <span class="italic">The Perpetuity, Advantages, and Universality of the Christian Religion</span> (1796), <span class="italic">Jehovah's Care to Perpetuate the Redeemer's Name</span> (1809), and <span class="italic">A Practical Exposition of the Book of Jonah</span> (1842). Between 1797 and 1802 Peddie was also an editor of the <span class="italic">Christian Magazine</span>, to which he was a regular contributor.<br>
<br>In a ministry spanning sixty years Peddie served as moderator of the Associate Synod in 1789 and, following the formation of the United Secession church (1820), once more in 1825. In line with the general expansion of the secession movement, the Bristo Street congregation increased in numbers and erected a larger building in 1804.<br>
<br>Although a member of a seceding denomination, Peddie was associated with many missionary, educational, and social enterprises. In 1791 he became treasurer of a fund to assist impoverished clergy in rural parishes, a position he held for forty-five years. In conjunction with Gavin Struthers, minister of the Relief church in Edinburgh, he formed the Edinburgh Subscription Library in November 1794. In the following year he supported the founding of the London Missionary Society, acting as a secretary to its Edinburgh auxiliary, as well as being a co-founder of the Scottish Missionary Society, established in February 1796 [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/42118', "Founders of the London Missionary Society")</script>]. A year on he established a fund to provide for widows of dissenting ministers in Scotland. In 1818 he was awarded an honorary DD by Marischal College, Aberdeen.<br>
<br>Peddie was twice married: first, in 1787, to Margaret (<i>d</i>. 1792), the eldest daughter of the Revd George Coventry of Stichill, Roxburghshire, and second, in 1795, to Barbara, a daughter of Donald Smith, lord provost of Edinburgh, with whom he had nine children, including <a name="cosubject_21755"></a><span class="headword">William Peddie</span>  (1805&#150;1893), <span class="occ">minister of the United Presbyterian church</span>, who was born on 15 September 1805 in Edinburgh. William was educated at Crichton Street School, the high school in Edinburgh, and later at the university before entering the Secession Divinity Hall in Glasgow, where he was tutored by John Dick. He was licensed to preach the gospel in May 1827 and became his father's colleague at Bristo Street in October 1828.<br>
<br>James Peddie died in Edinburgh on 11 October 1845 and was buried at Warriston cemetery on 17 October. Thereafter William became the sole pastor of the congregation where, like his father, he remained for the rest of his life. In 1846 he published an edition of his father's <span class="italic">Discourses</span>, with a memoir, while himself serving as an editor of the <span class="italic">United Presbyterian Magazine</span>. A moderator of the United Presbyterian church in 1855, William Peddie had become an honorary DD from Jefferson College, Pennsylvania, in 1843. He died on 23 February 1893 and was buried in Edinburgh.<br>
