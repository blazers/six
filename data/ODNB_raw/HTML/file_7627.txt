<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Digby,  George</span>, second earl of Bristol  (1612&#150;1677), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was the eldest known son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7628/', "John Digby, first earl of Bristol (1580&#150;1653)")</script>, and his wife, Beatrice or Beatrix (1574?&#150;1658), daughter of Charles Walcot of Walcot, Shropshire, and widow of Sir John Dyve of Bromham, Bedfordshire. He was baptized at Madrid, where his father was ambassador to the Spanish court, on 5 November 1612; his birth may therefore be presumed to have taken place there shortly before.<h2>
<a name="Earlylife"></a>Early life</h2>Spain remained Digby's home for eleven years, and he grew up fluent in its language. His first public appearance was at the age of twelve, when he presented a petition to the House of Commons on behalf of his father, who had been recalled from his embassy in disgrace and committed to the Tower. His bearing and eloquence much impressed the members, and the elder Digby was released soon after. George Digby matriculated at Magdalen College, Oxford, on 15 August 1626, and proceeded MA on 31 August 1636. The delay was not due to any lack of aptitude for learning, for he gained a reputation at Oxford, and in the cultivated circle which his father gathered at his country seat of Sherborne in Dorset, as an assiduous scholar. His two greatest enthusiasms in this period were for astrology and theology, and in 1638&#150;9 he exchanged a series of letters with his Roman Catholic kinsman Sir Kenelm Digby (son of the executed gunpowder plotter Everard Digby), advancing the claims of the Church of England against that of Rome; these were to be published in 1651. After achieving his degree he travelled in France, and completed his learning of that language in turn. Observers thought him a youth of unusual brilliance as well as cherubic blond good looks.<br>
<br>During a visit to London in 1634 Digby was slighted by a court favourite, William Crofts, and challenged him to a duel with swords, which he won. The action was technically treasonable, having taken place within the precincts of Whitehall, and Digby took the blame for it and underwent a term in the Fleet prison. This was recognized at the time as compounding an alienation from the government which had been natural in his family since his father's disgrace, and it cannot be accidental that when he married, in 1635 or 1636, it was into a noble house associated with sustained opposition to the royal policies of the decade. His bride was Lady Anne Russell (<i>d</i>. 1697), second daughter of Francis, fourth earl of Bedford, and they produced two sons and two daughters.<h2>
<a name="Politicsandthecivilwar"></a>Politics and the civil war</h2>With these experiences and associations it is hardly surprising that Digby was in the forefront of the attacks which brought down the personnel and measures of Charles I's personal rule. He was elected to represent Dorset in both the Short and the Long parliaments of 1640, and distinguished himself near the opening of the latter, on 10 November, by presenting to the Commons a petition from his county against royal misgovernment and proposing that a remonstrance against it should be made by the house to the king. The following day he became one of the managers of the impeachment of the earl of Strafford, describing him as &#145;that grand Apostate to the Commonwealth&#146;  (<span class="italic">Journal</span>, ed. Notestein, 25&#150;9). By February 1641 he had also become one of the foremost proponents of the bill for triennial parliaments. It is true that on the 8th of that month he was also one of the most determined opponents of the proposals for root and branch reform of the church and showed dislike of the Scots who were encouraging it, but this stance was still consistent with that of his erstwhile allies.<br>
<br>Digby parted company with the latter spectacularly on 21 April, when he became the most celebrated opponent of Strafford's attainder in the Commons. The move probably reflected the inclinations of his father and father-in-law, and was intended to prevent the complete estrangement of the king from the reform party, but it left him in a small minority. On 1 June his speech was published in an attempt to rally support for Charles during another period of tension. Whether or not he countenanced this action it infuriated most of the Commons, and on 9 June the king rescued him from probable committal by elevating him to the Lords as Baron Digby of Sherborne. The MPs were left to order the public burning of his speech on 13 July and to request the king not to give him any office thereafter; Charles promptly appointed him ambassador to France. In this manner the partnership between the two men, to their mutual political disadvantage, was formed.<br>
<br>Digby did not proceed to France but became one of the most extreme of the king's defenders in the Lords. He encouraged Charles to bring moderate MPs into the government but was also almost certainly his principal adviser in the rash courses which finally lost the king control of London and the Commons: the appointment of the notorious Thomas Lunsford to govern the Tower in December and the attempted arrest of the five members on 4 January 1642. Following the latter d&eacute;b&acirc;cle Digby and Lunsford went to meet disbanded officers at Kingston upon Thames, and the Commons assumed (with what truth will never be known) that they were planning a military coup. Parliament ordered the Surrey militia to disperse their men and Digby was summoned to explain himself to the Lords. Instead, using a pass from the king, he sailed on 16 January from Deal to Middleburg in the Dutch Netherlands. There he wrote letters to his friends and the queen encouraging Charles to avoid compromise in his now open breach with parliament. It was the interception of these that caused the Commons to decree his impeachment on 26 February. He had become the stereotypical evil royal counsellor.<br>
<br>All that can be said with any certainty about Digby's activities in the summer of 1642, as civil war commenced, is that at some point he rejoined the king. There are tales of secret journeys between the Netherlands and the royal court, on one of which he was captured by a parliamentarian warship and only escaped by first pretending to be a seasick Frenchman and then talking the governor of Hull, Sir John Hotham, into assisting him. Whatever the truth of these he was with the royal army by the time that it went on campaign, and commanding a horse regiment which he had raised for it. As such he displayed exemplary courage, charging with his regiment at Edgehill on 23 October, proposing and participating in the taking of Marlborough on 5 December, and being wounded in the thigh at the attempted storming of Lichfield on 20 April 1643. In this initial period of the war the king carefully failed to give him any employment as a minister or adviser, doubtless as a gesture of reassurance to moderate and hostile opinion. By the autumn, however, parliament's continued refusal to make peace had hardened the king's mood. The death of Lord Falkland at the battle of Newbury on 20 September left vacant one of the two posts of secretary of state and a seat on the privy council, and eight days later Digby was appointed to both. This promotion of one of the men in the kingdom least acceptable to parliament was a sign of the hardening of Charles's attitude towards his enemies.<br>
<br>Digby proved to be an industrious and conscientious administrator, and the clarity of his thought and handwriting remains a boon to the historian as it was to contemporaries. Nor did he immediately become part of any ultra-royalist bloc among Charles's counsellors. His main allies in the winter of 1643&#150;4 were two civilians, Sir Edward Hyde and Lord Culpeper, moderates whom he had helped to bring into government in 1641, and two soldiers, lords Wilmot and Percy, who had been associated with plots to use armed force against parliament in that year. He and Culpeper became Charles's most trusted civilian advisers and accompanied him on campaign in 1644. There they fell out with Wilmot and Percy, as the former became jealous of them, and were obliged in self-defence to work upon the king's own growing suspicion of Wilmot, and achieve the dismissal of both him and Percy in August.<br>
<br>Digby now badly needed an ally in the royal army and found one in Prince Rupert, with whom he had formerly been at enmity, but whom he now wooed by supporting the appointment of the prince to command the army in November. In February Culpeper and Hyde were removed to duties in the west, with Digby's connivance, leaving the latter the main civilian adviser of the king. His position, however, depended upon his partnership with Rupert, and this broke down as the prince turned against him just as Wilmot had done. There was clearly something about Digby which soldiers found instinctually unpleasant and untrustworthy. It may have been simply that he had become the courtier-politician <i>par excellence</i>, whose mode of dealing with opponents was to behave impeccably to their faces while undermining their credit with the king. It was of a piece with this behaviour that he repeatedly attempted to win over enemy garrisons by suborning their officers&#151;a tactic employed, with total lack of success, at Gloucester, Aylesbury, and Abingdon.<br>
<br>The breach with Rupert proved catastrophic for their cause. First it encouraged Digby to urge Charles into committing the royal army to battle at Naseby on 14 June 1645, an action undertaken against the advice of Rupert and which resulted in its destruction. This turned the prince into his implacable enemy, a feud which took on ideological dimensions as Rupert advised the king to make peace while Digby counselled continued resistance. On 14 September he convinced Charles that his nephew had become untrustworthy and caused the dismissal of Rupert and his supporters from their commands. The furious prince set out to plead his case to the king in person, at Newark. Digby, desperate to avoid the encounter, persuaded Charles on 13 October to commission him as lieutenant-general in England north of the Trent and give him his remaining cavalry, with which he proposed to break through to Scotland. The odds against this expedition were probably too great from the start, and Digby's force was defeated at Sherburn, Yorkshire, on the 15th and disintegrated on the banks of the Solway six days later. Its commander's only achievement was to evade death or capture himself and reach safety in Ireland.<h2>
<a name="ExileandRestoration"></a>Exile and Restoration</h2>Digby now formed the new project of persuading the prince of Wales to become the figurehead for a royalist counter-attack to be launched from Ireland, and in April 1646 followed the track of the prince's own flight into exile, to Jersey. Finding the boy's councillors, who included Hyde and Culpeper, opposed to the venture, he went on to France and concocted a plan with Cardinal Mazarin to bring the prince to the French court and persuade Charles to make concessions to the Scots which would turn them against parliament on his behalf. This scheme got further than the last, only to backfire. The king joined the Scots but would not make the intended concessions, and so became their prisoner. The prince crossed to France and became stranded there, at the court of his mother, together with Digby and other exiles. The latter included Rupert, who would have duelled with Digby had not the queen prevented it, and Wilmot, who did cross swords with him and was wounded and disarmed as effectively as Crofts had been long before.<br>
<br>By 1648 Digby had managed to lose the confidence of the queen in turn, and entered the French royal army as a volunteer, serving with such courage and energy that by 1651 he had become commander of the French forces in Normandy, with the rank of lieutenant-general. In that year the exiled Charles II reappeared in France and Digby somehow talked his way back into his favour and that of Hyde, being awarded the Garter in January 1653 and a place on the new privy council in April; on 6 January he had succeeded his father as earl of Bristol. He remained in the French service until the summer of 1656, when he somehow managed to make a mortal enemy of Mazarin and had to leave the country. Most opportunely Charles II had just settled in the Southern Netherlands as an ally of Spain, and Bristol moved straight to Brussels and used all his charm and linguistic ability to befriend the governor of the province. He then did good service to Charles by pleading his case, being rewarded on 1 January 1657 with his old posts of secretary of state and privy councillor. In March he delighted the Spanish by talking the French garrison of St Ghislain into defecting, and was given the soldiers as his own regiment. He remained one of the inner ring of the exiled court, though subordinate to Hyde, until January 1659, when he committed political suicide by making a personal conversion to Roman Catholicism. As he never reversed it when its political disadvantages became obvious and lasting it must have been wholly sincere, but it represented an acute embarrassment for Charles at a time when he was trying to distance himself from identification with Catholicism. Bristol was dismissed from all his offices. At the same time he ruined his credit with the Spanish by a piece of indiscretion which leaked military secrets to the French, and lost his regiment. In the autumn he accompanied Charles on a mission to Spain as an interpreter, but was abandoned as his master hurried back north on the first lap of the journey which was to end in his restoration.<br>
<br>Bristol followed him, and was restored to his own lands and titles along with other former royalists, but remained barred from office because of his religion and his track record. He became instead one of the ornaments of the court, noted for the recklessness of his gambling and the extravagance of his entertainments. He specially became identified with the interests of his fellow Catholics and of Spain, and with the enemies of his old colleague Hyde, who was still chief royal minister and had become earl of Clarendon; in particular, he was associated with the king's mistress, the countess of Castlemaine. Doubtless jealousy would have propelled these moves in any case, but he had a particular reason to dislike Clarendon. On 31 October 1643, when he was a new royal minister, he had been appointed to the honorary post of high steward of Oxford University, which had been left to him, in theory, upon his dismissal from office in 1659. After the Restoration he claimed it in earnest, only to be dispossessed of it by Clarendon, in the latter's new dignity of chancellor of the university, upon the grounds of Bristol's Catholicism. It must have rankled also that in 1661 Bristol had almost persuaded Charles to marry the daughter of an Italian client of Spain, and actually set out to negotiate the match, only for Clarendon to lead the lobby which persuaded the king into a Portuguese marriage alliance instead.<br>
<br>By 1663 Bristol's fortunes again seemed in the ascendant; the king was disappointed with his Portuguese wife and devoted to Castlemaine, while Bristol had acquired a potent ally in the new secretary of state, Lord Arlington. Clarendon seemed to be increasingly isolated and out of favour. Once again, however, Bristol spoiled his chances, with a risky agreement with an ambitious MP, Sir Richard Temple, to manage the House of Commons in the king's interest. When news of it leaked, and the Commons reacted with fury, Bristol was abandoned by all his friends, and had to protest his innocence to the MPs on 1 July. Humiliated, he turned on Clarendon and accused him of high treason before the House of Lords on the 10th. The hearing lasted four days, and represented the final disaster of Bristol's political career. His charges were soon revealed to be so baseless that they wasted the time of the house, and a furious Charles ordered his arrest as a troublemaker. Bristol went into hiding and had to remain there for years. He was able to emerge only in October 1667, when Clarendon finally fell out with the king, and his enemy was able to obtain both forgiveness and revenge by helping to draw up a fresh impeachment of the earl, this time with royal support. This restored him to public life but not to favour. In 1673 he courted popularity by supporting the <span class="roman">Test Act</span>, which formally disabled Catholics like himself from office, but this was his last notable appearance. He died at his house in Chelsea on 20 March 1677, and his wife had him buried in the Russell family chapel at Chenies, Buckinghamshire, four days later.<h2>
<a name="Character"></a>Character</h2>George Digby remains one of the foremost English examples of irresponsible brilliance. He possessed apparent exceptional talent as a politician, administrator, courtier, soldier, and scholar, and failed as all of those, a pattern which may be related to three defects. One was an inability to keep friends: during the civil war he already saw himself as &#145;single against all the world&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 16/510/74). Another was his constant tendency to choose the most flamboyant, sensational, and risky course out of every political and military problem, without the skills needed to steer such courses to success. The third was an ingrained carelessness in planning actions and observing discretion. He was and remained remorselessly self-destructive, with a proportionate tendency to destroy all those, including monarchs, whom he carried along with him. In this sense, he was one of English history's most dangerous men.<br>
