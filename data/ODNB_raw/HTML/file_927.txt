<span class="headword">Awdely <span class="st"> [Awdeley; <em>alias </em>Sampson]</span>,  John</span>  (<em>b. </em>in or before 1532, <em>d.</em> 1575), <span class="occ">printer and writer</span>, was the younger son of Sampson Awdelie (<i>d</i>. 1559/60), verger of Westminster Abbey. He was a king's scholar at Westminster School between 1542 and 1544, and was made free of the Stationers' Company between 1 October and 26 November 1556. On 24 August 1559 he presented his first apprentice, and on 6 November obtained licences for printing his first publication, a &#145;mornynge and evenynge prayer&#146;  (Arber, <span class="italic">Regs. Stationers</span>, 1.125). From 1561 to 1571 his name (or sometimes his alias, John Sampson) occurs repeatedly in the Stationers' registers, obtaining licences for printing books and pamphlets, and presenting apprentices; the <span class="italic">Short-Title Catalogue</span> shows continuous publication under his name to 1575. In 1564 he was fined for illegally printing &#145;other mens copyes&#146;  (ibid., 1.239). From 1565 to his death in 1575 he was dwelling in Little Britain Street, described on his title-pages as &#145;without Aldersgate&#146;, or &#145;by Great S. Bartholomew's&#146;.<br>
<br>Throughout these years Awdely apparently drove a thriving trade. His publications were of an essentially popular kind, and consisted mainly of ballads, news sheets, and religious tracts. One of the most important medical, scientific, and pedagogical tracts he reprinted and published was Fitzherbert's <span class="italic">Boke of Husbandry</span>. Several of his publications were of his own composition. One of the earliest of them, <span class="italic">The Wonders of England</span> (1559), a folio sheet of eleven ten-line stanzas, related English historical events from the death of Edward VI to the accession of Elizabeth. Such accounts of wonders and prognostications printed by Awdely demonstrated Elizabethan concern with English history and its situation within a natural order. The most important work in his literary effort was a little volume entitled <span class="italic">The Fraternitie of Vacabondes</span>, licensed about July 1561 and self-published in 1565. It is an elaborate description of the habits and organization of the beggars of the day, including some doggerel verses by the author on the back of the title-page; it was reprinted in 1565 and 1575. Harman's <span class="italic">Caveat</span>, a book on the same subject published in 1567, was obviously largely indebted to it. Besides pamphlets and ballads, Awdely focused on protestant texts throughout his career; in 1560 he was fined for illegally printing catechisms, and two of his final issues in 1575 were works by Bale and Crowley. Awdely's editions of the gospels and epistles saw press six times, and he printed sixteen editions of Edward Dering's sermons. As an occasional author, godly pamphleteer, and ballad-printer, he served the varied interests of his times.<br>
<br>Awdely died some time between 4 August and 16 September 1575 (the dates of the signing and proving of his will), leaving a widow, Elizabeth, a son, and five daughters. In his will, consisting mostly of a long religious preamble, he bequeathed his printing house to Sampson, his son, and John Simpson, his son-in-law, &#145;but the same workehowse to remaine in my wyves hand and disposition till she shall see the one of them able to rule and occupie yt&#146;, and during the following year books continued to appear bearing his name in the imprint  (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/57, fol. 269<i>r</i>). However, in 1582, eleven of his titles were transferred to the printer John Charlewood.<br>
<br>It is unclear whether Awdely was related to either the printer John Awdely who was buried in St Giles Cripplegate, London, in August 1563 or the John Awdlie who signed a 1577 petition against printing privileges.<br>
