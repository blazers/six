<span class="headword">Speed,  Samuel</span>  (1630/31&#150;1682), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, was the eldest son of the anatomist <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26094/', "John Speed (1595&#150;1640)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26093/', "Speed, John")</script>] and his wife, Margaret Warner (<i>d</i>. 1685). He was a grandson of the famous cartographer, historian, and genealogist <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26093/', "John Speed")</script>. Elected to Christ Church, Oxford, from Westminster School in 1645, Samuel Speed matriculated on 1 February 1647, aged sixteen, graduating BA on 8 July 1649 and proceeding MA on 30 October 1660. On 14 July 1648 he formally refused to submit to the parliamentary visitors, but must have done so later, for in March 1651 it was recorded that he was absent on leave from the university.<br>
<br>Anthony Wood notes, obscurely, that Speed suffered for his loyalty to the Stuarts. Family tradition had it that he was forced to flee the country for complicity in a plot against Cromwell, and that he sailed to the West Indies and engaged there in piracy against the forces of the protectorate. Perhaps, therefore, he was the same Samuel Speed who was released from the custody of the serjeant-at-arms by an order of the council of state, dated 8 December 1653, on giving his bond not to act for the future to the prejudice of the Commonwealth. At an unknown date, he married Maria, a daughter of Edward Layfield, rector of Chiddingfold, Surrey. There appear to have been no children; after Speed's death his widow was in financial distress and lived at Bishop George Morley's foundation for the widows of clergy at Winchester.<br>
<br>In 1662, probably through the influence of his elder brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26095/', "John Speed of Southampton (1628&#150;1711)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26093/', "Speed, John")</script>], Samuel was presented by Richard Baylie, dean of Salisbury, to the vicarage of Godalming, Surrey, after the crown had withdrawn its nominee. He was appointed a naval chaplain in 1666 and served in the Second Dutch War (and possibly also the third if there is any truth in the garbled account that he was shipboard chaplain to the earl of Ossory). He earned himself a reputation as &#145;the famous and valiant sea-chaplain and seaman&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>: <span class="italic">Fasti</span>, 2.347) and on 25 April 1670 the bishop of Lincoln urged Secretary Williamson to use &#145;your influence in behalf of Mr Speed, whom I might call Captain Speed, as he fought as well as those that are so called&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1670</i>, 181). On 27 June he was duly presented by the king to the prebend of Caistor in the diocese of Lincoln and installed by proxy on 20 September 1670. On 6 May 1674 he was installed as a prebendary of Christ Church, Oxford, on the presentation of the crown. In the same month the king wrote to Oxford University, ordering that the degree of DD be conferred upon Speed, since he &#145;has not had the opportunity of taking it in the usual course, chiefly by reason of his constant adherence to the King's service&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1673&#150;4</i>, 269). On 30 May 1675 a letter from the chancellor of the university to that effect was read in convocation at Oxford, but the degree seems not to have been awarded. Besides his benefice of Godalming, Speed also held the rectory of Whitburn, co. Durham, from 1673 to 1675, and that of Alverstoke, Hampshire, from 1675.<br>
<br>Speed died on 22 January 1682 in the parish of St Michael Queenhithe, in the City, and was buried on the 25th in the chancel of the parish church. Two published works have commonly been attributed to him, one a translation of the <span class="italic">Romae antiquae descriptio</span> of Valerius Maximus (1678), and the other <span class="italic">Prison-Pietie</span> (1677). But there is reason to believe that both books, and therefore the biographical facts revealed in the second, were actually the work of his cousin and namesake, the printer and publisher <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26096/', "Samuel Speed")</script>.<br>
