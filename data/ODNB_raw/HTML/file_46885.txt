<span class="headword">Dorman, Sir  Arthur John</span>, first baronet  (1848&#150;1931), <span class="occ">steel manufacturer</span>, was born at Ashford, Kent, on 8 August 1848, the son of Charles Dorman, a currier who later became a coal and timber merchant, and his wife, Emma Cage. He was educated at Christ's Hospital and spent a short period in Paris before beginning, at the age of eighteen, an apprenticeship to an iron manufacturer in Stockton-on-Tees, co. Durham. By 1873 he had become a metal broker, and in that year he married Clara, daughter of George Lockwood, a local merchant and shipbuilder. They had four sons and three daughters.<br>
<br>Having started with some &pound;1500 of capital, in 1876 Dorman launched a partnership with Albert de Lande Long by taking over an existing plant, the West Marsh ironworks, Middlesbrough. With its puddling furnaces and rolling mill, the company initially manufactured iron bars and angles for shipbuilding. In the 1880s, however, the firm switched to the more productive and profitable new steelmaking technologies by installing open-hearth furnaces and exploiting the breakthroughs of Percy Carlisle Gilchrist and his cousin, Sidney Gilchrist Thomas. By 1901 the company was a major manufacturer in the north-east, with a labour force of about 3000 and an output of about 180,000 tons of finished material a year. It competed for a place both at home and abroad with the principal creators of the iron and steel industry in the north-east, Henry Bolckow and Sir Isaac Lowthian Bell. Another surge of expansion occurred between 1900 and 1914, when the trend in the steel industry was towards vertical integration and merger. In 1902 Dorman Long absorbed Bell Bros. (with its distinguished but ageing head, Sir Isaac Lowthian Bell, still at the helm) and then acquired another substantial local firm, the North Eastern Steel Company. By 1914 Dorman Long, with a workforce of about 20,000, was a dominant firm on Teesside and a major British steel producer.<br>
<br>As both chairman and managing director, Dorman was the key decision maker in the company. Tall and imposing, he had many of the characteristics of the other great Victorian ironmasters: optimism, daring, a great capacity for hard work, and a keen interest in technical improvements. He enjoyed the trappings of wealth (though not for their own sake) and had a paternalistic attitude to his own firm and the local community. He also demonstrated some of the faults of the industry, in which many of the leading merged firms were imperfectly integrated and directed by elderly managers, who were reluctant to delegate authority and even more reluctant to retire.<br>
<br>These faults were exacerbated by an even more profitable and hectic phase of growth during the First World War, which saw Dorman Long become a major supplier of shells. It started to construct a &pound;4.5 million plant at Redcar, Yorkshire, and also acquired several other large companies, such as Samuelsons and Carlton Iron. Dorman, made a KBE in 1918 and a baronet in 1923, emerged from the war more dominant and apparently more powerful than ever. But his company did not fare well in the black decade of the 1920s, and found itself crippled by inefficient plant and poor management. Although in his seventies, Dorman retained the chairmanship, working alongside the even more geriatric Sir (Thomas) Hugh Bell. Dorman's sons, Charles and Arthur, were brought into the business, though neither was able entirely to replace their father, who continued to make the key decisions through the 1920s. Most of these proved inappropriate in a period of slump, and at the end of the decade Dorman Long reflected the feebleness of its chairman. Over-capitalized and burdened with debts, Dorman sought refuge in another merger in 1929 with an equally ailing neighbour, Bolckow Vaughan. In the depression this move failed to turn the company's fortune, and not until after Dorman had departed (literally, for he never retired) were overdue managerial reforms effected.<br>
<br>A typical Victorian owner&#150;founder, Dorman was better at conquering new fields than properly organizing what he had acquired. However, it has been argued persuasively that Dorman's later period of &#145;gerontocracy, dynastic weakness and inefficiency, superimposed on economic stress, should not be allowed to obscure his great qualities of intrepidity, resourcefulness and flair&#146;  (<span class="italic">DBB</span>). He died on 12 February 1931 at his home, Grey Towers, Nunthorpe, near Middlesbrough, Yorkshire.<br>
