<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Syfret, Sir  (Edward) Neville</span>  (1889&#150;1972), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, was born in Cape Town, Cape Colony, on 20 June 1889, the second child of five of Edward Ridge Syfret, a surgeon in Cape Town, and his wife, whose family name was Jones. His only brother was killed in the First World War. His early education was at the Diocesan College in South Africa and he passed into HMS <i>Britannia</i> at Dartmouth in 1904, becoming a chief cadet captain during his final year. In 1909, as a lieutenant, he specialized in gunnery and during the First World War was gunnery officer of the battle cruisers <i>Aurora</i>, <i>Centaur</i>, and <i>Cura&ccedil;ao</i>, all of which served for varying periods as flagship of Reginald Tyrwhitt commanding the Harwich force.<br>
<br>In 1913 Syfret married Hildegarde (<i>d</i>. 1976), daughter of Herbert Warner, of Hy&egrave;res, France; they had one son and one daughter.<br>
<br>Syfret was promoted commander in 1922 and captain in 1929 and on the outbreak of the Second World War was commanding the <i>Rodney</i> in the Home Fleet. Near the top of the captains' list and recognized in the navy as an &#145;intellectual&#146;, he was selected in November 1939 as naval secretary to the first lord, serving both Winston Churchill until he became prime minister in May 1940 and his successor, A. V. Alexander. He was promoted rear-admiral in 1940 and was appointed to command one of the Home Fleet cruiser squadrons, flying his flag in the <i>Edinburgh</i>. His first chance of showing his quality in command came a month later when his squadron was ordered to the Mediterranean as a temporary reinforcement for force H, based on Gibraltar, for an operation to pass a convoy of reinforcements and stores to Malta. Syfret was in charge of the last stages of the operation after the heavy ships of force H had turned back on reaching the Sicilian narrows, and, by taking the bold course of steering directly towards the enemy bases in Sicily, the attacking Italian aircraft were thrown off the scent. The success of the operation was complete, the convoy reaching Malta without the loss of a single ship. Syfret was appointed CB (1941) for his skill and daring in getting the convoy through.<br>
<br>In January 1942 Syfret succeeded Vice-Admiral Sir James Somerville in command of force H. His first major operation in this new command was the capture of Diego Suarez harbour in Madagascar to deny its use to Japanese naval forces in the Indian Ocean. With force H, temporarily renamed force F and reinforced with units of the Home Fleet, an amphibious assault was planned on the harbour defences resolutely held by pro-Vichy French troops. To avoid the inevitable difficulties and casualties of a frontal attack on the harbour installations, Syfret directed his attack across the narrow isthmus at the rear of the harbour in spite of the navigational difficulties of approaching a rock-bound coast at night through narrow channels which had been mined. Complete surprise was achieved and the harbour was captured intact after only a few hours of hard fighting.<br>
<br>Syfret's next major operation was the passage of another convoy to Malta in August 1942. Known as operation Pedestal, it was probably the best-remembered and hardest fought of all the great convoy battles in the Mediterranean. For over two days the convoy and its escorting force were repeatedly attacked by day and night by heavy concentrations of German and Italian submarines and aircraft and by Italian motor-torpedo boats, and though several ships were sunk or damaged, five merchant ships were successfully brought to Malta with sufficient stores to maintain the island until its siege was lifted with the allied invasion of north Africa. Syfret was promoted KCB (1942) &#145;for bravery and dauntless resolution in fighting an important convoy through to Malta&#146;.<br>
<br>In November 1942 an enlarged force H played a crucial part in covering the allied landings in north Africa from possible attacks by the Italian fleet, and later dominated the central Mediterranean to enable convoys to resupply and reinforce Malta without loss in preparation for the next offensives against Sicily and Italy. A serious illness forced Syfret to relinquish his command of force H in January 1943 but he was sufficiently recovered by June of that year to be appointed vice-chief of naval staff (VCNS), having been promoted vice-admiral in the meantime.<br>
<br>Syfret's undoubted qualities of quick decision making and intellectual approach to problems made him an ideal choice as VCNS and he proved an admirable partner for Admiral of the Fleet Sir Andrew Cunningham in the top direction of the war when Cunningham became first sea lord in October 1943. To Syfret as VCNS fell much of the overall direction of the allied landings in Normandy and the subsequent naval capture and clearance of French, Belgian, and Dutch ports as the armies advanced in Europe. To him also fell the organization and implementation of the British decision to send a major fleet into the Pacific to assist the United States in the naval war against Japan. At the end of his two years as VCNS in 1945 he was appointed KBE. He became admiral in 1946.<br>
<br>Shortly after the end of the war Syfret received his last appointment as commander-in-chief of the Home Fleet, a post he held for three difficult years. The run-down of the navy from a war to a peace establishment, accompanied by the problems of the demobilization of personnel, presented considerable difficulties in the maintenance of efficiency in the fleet, but throughout his three years of command he kept the Home Fleet in a state of high morale and readiness for any duty with which it might be faced. He was promoted GCB (1948) at the end of his tenure of this command and was placed on the retired list. Syfret died at his home in Highgate, London, on 10 December 1972.<br>
