<span class="headword">Blundell,  William</span>  (1560&#150;1638), <span class="occ">antiquary</span>, was the elder of two sons of Richard Blundell (<i>d</i>. 1591/2) and his wife, Anne, of Little Crosby, in the parish of Sefton, near Liverpool. The family, who had been landowners in the area since the thirteenth century, resisted the Reformation and suffered persecution throughout the late sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. Following the regular family practice of education abroad, in 1580 William went to Douai, while his brother, Richard, became a priest.<br>
<br>Richard Blundell the elder died a prisoner in Lancaster Castle in 1591 or early 1592, accused of harbouring a priest. William was imprisoned at the same time, and subsequently spent two years in prison in London. A search of his home late in the 1590s forced William to flee; his wife, Amelia or Emilia Norris (<i>d</i>. 1631), was also committed to prison in Chester and released only on the intercession of friends at court. Both Blundells received pardons at the accession of James, but this did not mitigate the persecutions of protestant neighbours and shrieval officials, who through the next three decades conducted frequent raids on his cattle and searches of the hall, culminating in the sequestration of the estate during the civil wars.<br>
<br>In addition to collecting a number of family records and several pro-Catholic &#145;ditties&#146;, William Blundell recorded a particularly significant archaeological discovery, a large trove of Anglo-Saxon coins found by accident in 1611, a few months after he had secretly established a cemetery for local Catholics on his own land, because the local puritan minister had refused Catholics the right of burial at Sefton church. The site of the cemetery was known as the Harkirke because oral tradition suggested that a church had once stood there. Blundell's cemetery endured for over a century, though an attempt by the sheriff of Lancashire, Sir Ralph Assheton, to destroy the graveyard in 1624 was met with resistance by Little Crosby's residents. The riot on that occasion resulted in an action against Blundell and his tenants in Star Chamber, and he was fined &pound;2000 by the court in 1629, though this was eventually reduced.<br>
<br>Blundell took the discovery of the coins as a sign of divine favour of his family's endurance in the face of persecution, and he immediately turned some of his trove into a silver pyx and chalice; the pyx still survives at Little Crosby church. Blundell penned two accounts of his coins, using various medieval and contemporary scholarly and historical sources to identify them. He also had a copperplate reproduction of several of them executed, and this circulated throughout the seventeenth century. The coins themselves were sent to relatives in Wales during the civil wars for safety and were lost soon after. Blundell's account of his coins demonstrates a surprisingly good grasp of Anglo-Saxon history and numismatics.<br>
<br>Blundell died at Crosby Hall, Little Crosby, on 2 July 1638. He was buried in Little Crosby. His wife, Amelia, and their son, Nicholas, had both died in 1631, while his daughter, Margaret, had entered, under the name of Winifred, the English Augustinian house at Louvain. Blundell was succeeded by Nicholas's son, also <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2715/', "William Blundell (1620&#150;1698)")</script>.<br>
