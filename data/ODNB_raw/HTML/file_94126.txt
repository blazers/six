</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Stern,  Irma</span>  (1894&#150;1966), <span class="occ">artist in South Africa</span>, was born in Schweizer-Reneke, Transvaal, on 2 October 1894, the first child of Samuel Stern (1863&#150;1935), general dealer, and his wife, Henny, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Fels (1875&#150;1944). Her parents were prosperous German Jews who retained strong ties with the cosmopolitan culture of Berlin, moving often between Germany and South Africa during her childhood. She spent several periods of schooling in Berlin and attended the ballet, theatre, and opera as well as art exhibitions as she grew older. At this time the conservative culture of Wilhelmine Berlin was being challenged by modernism and the excitement of a career in the fine arts clearly suited the passionate temperament that is evident in her journal and other early writings.<br>
<br>Stern began her studies in art soon after her eighteenth birthday and quickly gravitated towards the expressionist idiom, a direction confirmed by her meeting in 1917 with the Brucke group artist, Max Pechstein. Works by Stern were included in the Frei Secession exhibitions of 1918 and 1920; and in May 1919 she showed thirty-three drawings at the Fritz Gurlitt gallery in what the <span class="italic">Berliner Tageblatt</span> (in an undated cutting in her scrapbook) described as &#145;all kinds of modern styles&#146;. By the time she settled in Cape Town in 1920 she was a successful young artist committed to modernism in the sense that she used her art to communicate the intensity of her feelings about life.<br>
<br>Stern retained strong contacts with Germany until the rise of Hitler, at which time she broke off relations with childhood friends and even stopped writing in German. But she remained somewhat aloof from what she considered the provincial life of the Cape. She called her first exhibition in 1922 &#145;An exhibition of modern art&#146; expressly to signal her cosmopolitan status, and the poor critical reception of this and other early exhibitions appears only to have confirmed her sense of cultural superiority. This arrogance was complemented by an enduring insecurity and sense of loneliness. The expressionism of her early style disrupted conventional notions of beauty at the Cape, and the emotional and sexual nature of her subjects clearly made her conservative, Anglophile public uncomfortable. In particular her African subjects were viewed very differently in Cape Town and Germany. Colonial Cape Town saw itself as an outpost of civilization in Africa and was determined to keep all forms of primitivism at a distance.<br>
<br>But Stern did not depend on the sale of her paintings to make a living as she was supported by her parents for much of her life. As for her personal life, after a succession of unhappy infatuations, she married her former tutor Johannes Prinz (1886&#150;1942) on 1 April 1926&#151;and divorced him on 6 March 1934. In 1927 she acquired The Firs, Rosebank, which soon became celebrated for its eclectic furnishings, colourful garden, and extravagant cuisine.<br>
<br>The impression given in Max Osborn's monograph on Stern, published in Berlin in 1927, is that the artist's birth and domicile in Africa provided a rare authenticity for her images of the continent. In fact traditionalism was already confined to the native reserves demarcated by the <span class="roman">Land Act</span> of 1913 to provide a constant supply of cheap labour for industrializing South Africa. Like A. M. Duggan-Cronin, whose photographic studies <span class="italic">Bantu Tribes of South Africa</span> were launched in 1928, she effectively constructed her image of Africa by choosing to work in the reserves and then selecting her subjects and carefully removing any sign of western civilization from them. In the local context&#151;as distinct from Berlin&#151;her nostalgic representation of African life underscored the impossibility of assimilation. Her description of African people as &#145;lovely and happy children, laughing and singing and dancing through life with a peculiar animal-like beauty&#146;  (<span class="italic">Cape Argus</span>, 12 June 1926) reflects her stereotypical view of African subjects.<br>
<br>The dismay that Stern, and others of her generation, expressed at the increasing westernization of South Africa's black peoples led her not to develop closer relationships with them but rather to seek out people who had not yet been &#145;spoiled&#146; as subjects for her art. Between 1937 and 1946 she made a series of remarkable expeditions to Dakar, Zanzibar, and the Congo, publishing idiosyncratic accounts of the last two. In these travels she continued to seek out the exotic, notably those she saw as quintessential Arabs in Zanzibar and aristocrat types among the Watussi in the Congo. But she also came to temper her expressionist search for the primitive with a more considered account of sheer physical presence, particularly in the form of portrait studies. In this development she gradually abandoned the angular, linear expression, with limited chromatic range, of her early years, in favour of more concentrated compositions of rich, sensual colour.<br>
<br>Stern's travels contributed to the expression of a powerful decorative quality in her work through her constant discovery of exotic materials, particularly textiles. In her middle years, like Matisse, she came to present her art, whatever its subject and whatever its source, as an affirmation of the richness of life. In the same spirit she began a remarkable collection of objects from many different cultures, which she both displayed in her home and incorporated into her art: many still life paintings feature oriental ceramics or African sculptures from her collection; and she frequently used fragments of Zanzibar doors to frame her paintings.<br>
<br>Significantly, Stern's developing interest in the form her art took, rather than her early concern with an expressionist purpose, led her increasingly to view her production within the context of European art history. From the 1940s she appears to have rekindled an interest in the art of the old masters, particularly in their treatment of religious and mythological subject-matter. And, after the Second World War, in a self-conscious effort to modernize her style, she looked closely at the work of Picasso and other artists of the French riviera. These formal experiments loosened the concentrated vigour of her style and introduced a somewhat anecdotal quality to her late work. Her late subjects of harbours, markets, flower sellers, and harvest scenes tend to use the same picturesque style whether for Mediterranean or South African examples.<br>
<br>Stern died at the Volkshospitaal, Cape Town, on 23 August 1966, having achieved magisterial status in South Africa. She was cremated two days later at the Maitland crematorium. She left the greater part of her estate for the promotion of art. The Firs, with its contents, became the Irma Stern Museum, administered by the University of Cape Town.<br>
