<span class="headword">Devereux,  John</span>  (1778&#150;1860), <span class="occ">United Irishman and army officer in the Colombian service</span>, was born in Taghmon, co. Wexford, Ireland, the son of William Devereux and his wife, Mary. As a young man he served in the Wexford militia and was involved in the rebellion of the United Irishmen in 1798. He remained for some time in Ireland, spending 1799 raising recruits for the king's army at Duncannon Fort, after which he was arrested and tried for treason corresponding to the events of 1798. Devereux claimed that he had been &#145;compelled to put on an appearance of associating with rebels&#146;  (<span class="italic">Trial of John Devereux</span>, 60) to protect his family and property. He was sentenced to transportation for life on 9 January 1800, but had soon established himself in Baltimore, USA, where he dedicated himself to commerce and was responsible for raising the first statue of George Washington anywhere on the continent.<br>
<br>In 1814 Devereux wrote to Sim&oacute;n Bol&iacute;var and other South Americans offering his services in the procurement of arms and soldiers for the rebel armies in the Spanish colonies. He claimed to be &#145;a member of one of the British empire's oldest and most noble Catholic families&#146; who had left Ireland because of &#145;religious persecution&#146;  (Devereux to Crisanto Valenzuela, 16 June 1815, <span class="italic">Memorias</span>, 14.257&#150;9). He inserted himself into the networks of rebel supporters in the British West Indian colonies, staying with Robert Sutherland, a friend of Sim&oacute;n Bol&iacute;var, in Haiti in 1815. It has been speculated that while in Haiti Devereux fathered a son, Jean-Louis Rempler (born 21 August 1818 in Jacmel). In 1819 Devereux returned to Ireland, to promote the cause and recruit men in Dublin, Cork, and Belfast. He and his associates proudly proclaimed the Irishness of their &#145;Irish legion&#146;. The revival of romantic Irish nationalism&#151;with its symbols of harps and the colour green, and the love of liberty&#151;was an integral part of Devereux's speeches and letters in this period. His supporters included Daniel O'Connell and recruits included the sons and nephews of many United Irishmen, including Francis Burdett O'Connor, William Sampson, and Daniel O'Leary, in addition to O'Connell's own son Morgan. O'Connell wrote to Bol&iacute;var in 1820, hoping that &#145;my son may be enabled to form one link in that kindly chain which, I hope, long binds in mutual affection the free people of Colombia and the gallant but unhappy natives of Ireland&#146;  (O'Connell to Bol&iacute;var, 17 April 1820, <span class="italic">Correspondence of Daniel O'Connell</span>, 2.257).<br>
<br>Devereux arrived in Colombia only after the rebellion and departure of the majority of his Irish legion, at Riohacha on the Colombian Caribbean coast in 1820. Their departure to the British colonies, citing poor provisioning and disillusion with the Colombian service, left General D'Evereux, as he took to signing himself, with only a few dozen soldiers to command. He was widely mocked, for example by the Colombian vice-president Antonio Nari&ntilde;o, as &#145;a general without an army&#146;  (Nari&ntilde;o to congress, 12 July 1821, in <span class="italic">Archivo Nari&ntilde;o</span>, ed. G. Hernandez de Alba, 1990, vol. 6, pp. 187&#150;90).<br>
<br>Devereux did not fight or command troops in a single battle, and he suffered several personal humiliations in Colombia, including being gaoled in C&uacute;cuta in 1821 for challenging Nari&ntilde;o to a duel over an alleged slight to the honour of a British woman, Mary English. Many of his problems were inflamed by his notoriously poor command of the Spanish language. Bol&iacute;var described Devereux's challenge as &#145;madness &hellip; a real disgrace, a stupidity that compromises the government&#146;  (Bol&iacute;var to Santander, 10 July 1821, <span class="italic">Cartas Santander&#150;Bol&iacute;var, 1820&#150;1823</span>, 3.119). This was the low point of Devereux's career in Colombia and he rapidly left South America after being released from gaol on a technicality. Bol&iacute;var named him envoy extraordinaire to northern Europe in order to get rid of him; in 1825 he was imprisoned in Venice for financial matters. Upon his release he returned to the United States, where he launched a successful application for substantial recompense for his efforts from the Venezuelan and Colombian governments. He even secured favourable acknowledgements in some (though not all) accounts of the period written by its protagonists, including Jos&eacute; Manuel Restrepo and Tom&aacute;s Cipriano de Mosquera. In 1840 he returned briefly to Colombia, where he renegotiated a personal debt owed to him by Restrepo. Restrepo paid him 1500 pesos and 800 pesos per year, for life, from which Devereux lived comfortably in Marylebone and, later, Mayfair.<br>
<br>Devereux suffered problems with his eyesight, and he was completely blind in later life. Though he was remembered in the histories of the wars of independence in Colombia and Venezuela, in Europe he was quickly forgotten by the adventurers who felt defrauded by Devereux's promises when recruiting his mercenaries. His death, on 25 February 1860, at his home, 47 Hertford Street, Mayfair, London, was briefly recorded: &#145;He raised the Irish Legion which, under Bolivar, was engaged in the successful struggle for independence in Colombia&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 1 March 1860, 1).<br>
