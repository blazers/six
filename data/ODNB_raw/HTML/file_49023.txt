<span class="headword">Dalgety,  Frederick Gonnerman</span>  (1817&#150;1894), <span class="occ">wool merchant and sheep farmer</span>, was born on 3 December 1817 in Canada, where his father was a lieutenant in the Irish fusiliers; he had at least two younger half-brothers. Nothing is known of his education or early career before his arrival in Australia at Sydney on 2 June 1834.<h2>
<a name="Earlycareer"></a>Early career</h2>Dalgety became a clerk in the merchant house of T. C. Breillat &amp; Co., before moving to Melbourne in December 1842 as manager of the new office of Griffiths, Borrodaile &amp; Co., a firm hitherto based in both Sydney and Launceston and which specialized in importing goods for &#145;squatters&#146; and purchasing their goods for export. In 1845 Griffiths withdrew and set up a separate concern in Sydney; Dalgety became a partner in Dalgety, Borrodaile, and Gore, of Melbourne and Geelong. Problems arose when Borrodaile then withdrew and demanded repayment of his capital at a time of falling wool prices, when growers were in debt to the firm. John Gore, the London merchant on whom the firm relied, had second thoughts about providing capital for his son Harry's partnership, and he was restricting Dalgety's credit in London.<br>
<br>The firm narrowly escaped failure in 1848 as a result of the strict line that Dalgety took with his debtors, but he had suffered &#145;the greatest anxiety which I would not again undergo to secure a fortune&#146;  (Dalgety to John Gore, 7 Feb 1849, Dalgety archives, N8/19). It was clear that he needed better access to the financial resources of London, and a solution appeared in 1849 when John Gore proposed that they should form a partnership. Dalgety set out for London to complete the agreement, but Gore unfortunately died. Dalgety traded in London in association with Gore's sons, but by 1852 he was back in Melbourne with his finance still unresolved. He returned, however, to a very different situation: Victoria was experiencing a gold rush, and Melbourne was in a phase of explosive development. Dalgety's fortunes were to be transformed.<br>
<br>Initially Dalgety continued in his partnership with Harry Gore, whose brothers provided the crucial connection with London. Dalgety made perhaps &pound;150,000 by 1855 from the firm, as well as a considerable profit from property he had purchased at Melbourne in 1846&#151;he sold it in 1853, for building, at a profit of 4000 per cent. But his new wealth was little compensation for the discomforts of Melbourne. Life was &#145;infernally dull&#146; in the absence of a &#145;smiling female face&#146;, and he could &#145;only hope my moral resolve will be sufficiently strong, to enable me to resist the temptation of taking one &hellip; on the doubtful capacity of housekeeper&#146;; his will would, he felt, hold out &#145;for I have paid the penalty too frequently to incur the risk again&#146;  (Dalgety to Tobias, 25 June 1852, Dalgety archives, N8/20). His initial thoughts were to retire to England and give up business, for he was &#145;naturally of an excitable and anxious temperament&#146;  (Dalgety to F. and E. Gore, 1 Aug 1853, Dalgety archives, N8/20); however, a further bout of self-analysis led him to conclude that &#145;I am not cut out for a life of idleness or a life of gaiety&#146;  (Dalgety to J. Gore, 7 June 1853, Dalgety archives, N8/20). Moreover, as so often in his career, family responsibilities played their role, for he had two younger brothers &#145;to push forward in the world&#146;  (Dalgety to his doctor, 13 July 1852, Dalgety archives, N8/20). The impression is of a man who had acquired wealth through fortunate timing, but who lacked confidence and flexibility, preferring to keep to what he knew&#151;commodity trade with settlers.<h2>
<a name="PartnershipwithDuCroz"></a>Partnership with Du Croz</h2>Continuation in business required a base in London, and Dalgety decided that the best resolution of his difficulties was to sever all ties with the Gores, to settle in London where he would run the business in person, and to find others to operate the business in the colonies. He formed a partnership with Frederick Du Croz (1821&#150;1897), a merchant in Van Diemen's Land, to create Dalgety &amp; Co., and they settled in London in 1854. The Geelong business was run by Charles Ibbotson, and in 1857 Dalgety returned to Australia to make James Blackwood the managing partner in Melbourne. The basic structure of the firm was set for the next twenty years, and Dalgety firmly held to the view that merchant firms should be based on close personal ties and family involvement, in order to create trust for the transaction of business over long distances.<br>
<br>In 1855, soon after Dalgety moved to London, he married Blanche Trosse Allen (1836&#150;1883), the niece of his uncle's wife. Their first child was born in 1860, after his return from Australia in 1859, and Dalgety became impressed by the need to provide for a large and young family: Blanche died in 1883 in childbirth, and five sons and five daughters survived to adulthood. The firm prospered in the 1860s, opening further branches in Australia and New Zealand, and it moved away from its earlier role as a general merchant to specialize in selling wool on consignment and in lending to pastoralists. Dalgety was the largest importer of wool in London in the 1860s, at a time when about 80 per cent of the Australian wool clip was consigned for sale in London. The firm's capital grew from &pound;75,000 in 1852 to &pound;348,000 in 1861, of which Dalgety held &pound;200,000; by 1879 the capital was &pound;934,000, of which Dalgety held &pound;300,000.<br>
<br>By the late 1870s Dalgety &amp; Co. was starting to falter as its original partners became older, and Dalgety failed to adapt to the new circumstances of the wool trade. The capital of the firm had grown through retaining profits, which was no longer adequate by the mid-1870s to provide settlers with funds for fencing their properties and acquiring freeholds. Dalgety was facing increasing competition in London from colonial banks such as the Bank of New South Wales and from finance houses such as the Australian Mercantile Land and Finance Company. They had access to larger sums of money from their depositors and from the sale of debentures to <i>rentiers</i> in England and Scotland; and they were able to offer mortgages to settlers, and to move (in the contrary direction to Dalgety) from pastoral finance to handling consignments of wool. The next stage, towards the end of the nineteenth century, was to sell wool at auctions within Australia rather than in London. These changes posed a threat to Dalgety's continued prosperity.<br>
<br>Dalgety proved incapable of adapting to the new realities, being essentially a simple-minded colonial merchant who was not able to move from the world of visible trade in wool to more abstruse dealings in finance. In the early 1870s he came under attack from growers in the colonies, who suspected that they were being exploited by London merchants; above all he came into bitter conflict with Sir Daniel Cooper of the Bank of New South Wales, who could pose as the protector of the growers. Dalgety's loathing of this &#145;little Sydney blaguard [<i>sic</i>]&#146; and his &#145;ignorant and vulgar aspersions&#146; knew no bounds  (Dalgety to C. Nichols, 10 Aug 1871, Dalgety archives, N39/42), and by 1873 he was &#145;really tired of occupying the position of a muzzled Badger placed under a Trough, for every Cur to snap at&#146;  (Dalgety to J. Blackwood, 17 April 1873, Dalgety archives, N39/42). The serious point behind Dalgety's bluster was that he was failing to adapt, for the increasing need for finance was making the firm more and more dependent on bankers for loans.<br>
<br>Although Dalgety admitted that &#145;we must be strong in capital&#146;  (Dalgety to Blackwood, 22 Dec 1875, Dalgety archives, N39/42), the problem was that the firm was&#151;like all partnerships&#151;susceptible to reduction of capital when partners opted to take their undistributed profits from the firm, or to retire. Dalgety was putting large sums into the acquisition of a landed estate and the construction of Lockerley Hall, at East Lytherly, Hampshire, from 1868, and he also made large purchases of sheep stations in New Zealand. His aim was not to achieve &#145;immediate and high returns&#146;  (Dalgety to C. Ibbotson, 26 Nov 1875, Dalgety archives, N39/42). Although he complained constantly at the low return and the difficulties of control, his strategy was clear from his will made in 1893: the New Zealand properties were to be held by his trustees &#145;with a view to their being ultimately taken over by my sons rather than to be sold&#146;  (will, proved 11 April 1894, London). His response to the attacks of Cooper, and to the changing world of the City, was to retreat into the world he knew best: sheep, which increasingly dominated his letters as he advised his station managers on minute details of breeding and washing wool. In the early 1870s Dalgety had about 100,000 sheep in New Zealand, and the stations offered a solution to his mounting concern over his young family.<br>
<br>&#145;I have five young sons growing up&#146;, he remarked in 1879, &#145;and I should like in these difficult times for providing for sons, to form a future house for some of them in New Zealand&#146;  (Dalgety to W. Burnett, 22 May 1879, Dalgety archives, N8/21). None of his sons, he ruefully admitted, was capable of holding a job in the City; they were constantly failing their examinations at Cambridge and in the navy and army. The eldest son, Freddy, was kind and considerate, &#145;not quick or clever with books but fond of outdoor sports, a capital rider, good shot, plays cricket and lawn tennis well, and fond of animals&#146;  (Dalgety to A. Blackwood, 10 July 1884, Dalgety archives, N39/45). Charles, the only one who entered the firm, soon left and begged to be sent to New Zealand. &#145;He is gentlemanly and has no vices&#146;, commented his father, &#145;so I hope he will make a good colonist&#146;  (Dalgety to W. Burnett, 3 Sept 1891, Dalgety archives, N39/46). He was also plagued by his drunken half-brother, his incompetent brother-in-law, and his feckless cousin: New Zealand was the solution for all. &#145;Verily one's relatives are a source of humiliation and anxiety&#146;, he concluded  (Dalgety to A. Blackwood, 20 Jan 1876, Dalgety archives, N39/43).<h2>
<a name="TheDoxatyears"></a>The Doxat years</h2>Perhaps it was this need to provide for his children which made Dalgety reluctant to change the basis of the firm into a merchant bank. However, it also reflected his own inadequate grasp of financial issues. He dealt with a single commodity on the frontier of the world economy, without connections in European financial centres. During the 1870s he retreated into his estate activities and left the active management of the firm to others. In 1878 Du Croz announced his wish to retire from the London house; Blackwood and Ibbotson's health was failing; and in 1879 Blackwood's son Arthur was taken into partnership in Melbourne, despite Dalgety's justified doubts about his abilities. Dalgety's response was to seek the injection of more capital by the traditional means of recruiting an additional partner. His choice was inspired, for it fell on E. T. Doxat, a partner in the wool brokers Edenborough and Doxat, valued at about &pound;250,000. Edenborough, it was reported, was a &#145;half imbecile&#146;; Doxat was &#145;very clever but not scrupulous, one must exercise utmost caution in dealing with him&#146;  (<span class="roman">Kleinwort Information Book 1</span>, fol. 88). Doxat was to rescue the firm from the increasingly inept Dalgety.<br>
<br>Doxat took over the running of the business with great dynamism and soon obtained ascendancy over the elderly partners. He was energetic, capable, indispensable, perceptive, and unscrupulous: Dalgety stood no chance. Doxat soon discovered that the firm was less secure than he had assumed and was furious that he had been misled into taking a drop in income. He was concerned from the start at the reliance on bankers and brokers for credit, which would be fatal if wool prices fell. Clearly the firm was not able to compete in the business of consigning wool when banks and finance houses were able to offer loans and mortgages to pastoralists. Access to cheap funds was crucial. A bitter battle started for control of the firm. Dalgety preferred to continue in the old way, simply replacing retiring partners. &#145;I cannot see why&#146;, he wrote to Arthur Blackwood, &#145;we could not work on as we are comfortably and independently, if we are only content to work within our capital, and our legitimate credit&#146;  (Dalgety to A. Blackwood, 23 Aug 1883, Dalgety archives, N39/45).<br>
<br>Accordingly, Dalgety made a further trip to Australia and New Zealand in 1881 in a search for new blood. He was repeating the strategy of the 1850s, which Doxat felt was no solution. No sooner had he arrived in the colonies than Doxat and the London partners put forward a plan they had vainly proposed before his departure: conversion to a joint-stock company. Dalgety was horrified and continued with his negotiations to bring in new partners; to his disgust, the London partners refused to agree. Dalgety returned home to do battle, urging that the firm was making an adequate profit, and that conversion would simply alienate its &#145;staunch and valuable connection&#146;  (Dalgety to A. Blackwood, 6 April 1882, Dalgety archives, N39/44).<br>
<br>Doxat, however, was perfectly correct to see that the capital of the firm was inadequate to compete with banks and finance houses. &#145;I cannot understand myself&#146;, Doxat informed Arthur Blackwood, &#145;how Dalgety who is so chary of bills and financing thinks the business is to be worked&#146;  (Doxat to A. Blackwood, 9 June 1881, Dalgety archives, N8/23). The matter was eventually resolved after the death of Dalgety's wife in 1883, which gave him &#145;sole anxious care&#146; of a large and young family, and made him disinclined to face &#145;constant worrying and bullying&#146;  (Dalgety to C. Ibbotson, 6 Sept 1883, Dalgety archives, N39/45), and the conversion of the company by Arthur Blackwood. The partnership became a limited company in 1884. The business was now able to secure cheap funds through the issue of debentures, which amounted to &pound;2m by 1888. The firm was also able to shift from consignments to London, which remained stable, to local sales in Australia, where Dalgety's was one of the three dominant firms before the First World War.<br>
<br>Dalgety himself retreated from the business and became increasingly involved in his activities as a major landowner in Hampshire and New Zealand; he also became deputy lieutenant for Hampshire. The net value of his estate in 1893 was &pound;779,993; he also had &pound;66,852 in investments other than land and the firm. These investments were misjudged, however, for the New Zealand estates were not a success and he had bought land in England shortly before the long-term fall in property prices. Dalgety died from cancer, at Lockerley Hall on 20 March 1894, and was buried at the church of St John the Evangelist, Lockerley, which he had rebuilt. His memorial window, appropriately enough, portrayed Christ the good shepherd, with a sheep across his shoulders.<br>
