<span class="headword">Whinfield,  John Rex</span>  (1901&#150;1966), <span class="occ">textile chemist</span>, was born on 16 February 1901 at Brambletye, Cavendish Road, Sutton, Surrey, the son of John Henry Richard Whinfield, mechanical engineer, and his wife, Edith Matthews. He was educated at Merchant Taylors' School and Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, where he received a third class in part one of the natural sciences tripos (1921) and a second in part two in 1922 (chemistry). In the latter year, on 1 November, he married Mayo Elva (<i>d</i>. 1946), daughter of the Revd Frederick William Walker.<br>
<br>At Cambridge, Whinfield had studied the chemistry of man-made fibres, and on leaving university spent a year working, without pay, in the London laboratory of C. F. Cross and E. J. Bevan, who had first made viscose rayon in 1892. In 1923 he joined the Calico Printers' Association as a research chemist, at a time when the search was on in many laboratories for new synthetic fibres.<br>
<br>In the late 1930s, with Wallace H. Carothers's nylon nearing manufacture, Whinfield looked for other classes of polymer which might yield a textile fibre. Assisted by James Dickson, he discovered how to condense terephthalic acid and ethylene glycol to yield a substance which could be drawn into a fibre. (Carothers had thought of investigating this route but had eventually concentrated on his polyamides.) The Whinfield&#150;Dickson patent was filed in July 1941, but was suppressed for wartime reasons until 1946. It was then examined for commercial potential by both ICI (who eventually marketed it under the name Terylene) and DuPont (who called it Dacron). World manufacturing rights eventually fell to ICI.<br>
<br>During the Second World War Whinfield served as an assistant director of chemical research in the Ministry of Supply. He joined ICI in 1947, first in its plastics division and then in the fibres division, a position which involved worldwide travel.<br>
<br>Despite the importance of Terylene and its universal use as a textile fibre, Whinfield received little public honour for his discovery, his appointment as CBE (1954) seeming hardly adequate for his achievement. Possibly he might have published more, and not been content with the record of work provided by patents. His colleagues honoured him, however, by honorary fellowship of the Textile Institute (1955), and the Perkin medal of the Society of Dyers and Colourists (1956). The University of York gave his name to its chemical library and created some Whinfield travelling fellowships. Following the death of his first wife Whinfield married, on 31 July 1947, Nora Eileen Dawes (<i>b</i>. 1906/7), former wife of Reginald John Dawes, and daughter of Eric Hodder, architect. She survived Whinfield, who died at his home, 2 Castle Gardens, Dorking, Surrey, on 6 July 1966.<br>
