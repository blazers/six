<span class="headword">Humphreys,  Arthur Leslie Charles</span>  (1917&#150;2003), <span class="occ">computer industry executive</span>, was born on 8 January 1917 at 102 Manor Lane, Lewisham, London, the son of Percy Stuart Humphreys, insurance agent, and his wife, Louise, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Weston. He was educated at Catford grammar school, but left at the age of fourteen to train as a solicitor's clerk. Invalided out of the army during the Second World War on account of a heart defect, in October 1940 he became the share registrar of the British Tabulating Machine Company (BTM), manufacturers of electro-mechanical punched-card machinery&#151;the forerunners of office computers. BTM was the licensee of International Business Machines (IBM), the world's largest manufacturer of punched-card machines and later computers. On 11 September 1943 Humphreys married the 25-year-old Marjorie Irene Murphy Jones, a photographer for the Ministry of Supply, and daughter of John Jones, builder's carpenter. They had two sons and one daughter.<br>
<br>In 1949 BTM and IBM terminated their licensing arrangement by mutual agreement, freeing BTM from royalty payments but exposing it to direct competition from IBM. In 1951 Humphreys was appointed assistant secretary with responsibility for commercial affairs. He was closely involved in the negotiations in 1958 between BTM and Powers-Samas (the other British punched-card machine manufacturer) which resulted in the creation of International Computers and Tabulators Ltd (ICT). Appointed head of product and corporate planning in 1962, he oversaw ICT's transformation into Britain's leading computer company over a period of five years, during which it acquired the computer interests of GEC, EMI, and Ferranti. In 1963 he was elected to the ICT board, and was instrumental in the decision to launch a major new computer range, the ICT 1900 series. The new range of computers was based on an obscure Canadian machine, the Ferranti Packard 6000, to which ICT had manufacturing rights, saving the company many months of development time. When in April 1964 IBM announced the System/360, an advanced computer range that reshaped the computer landscape worldwide, ICT was quickly able to respond with the 1900 series. It was the company's first major financial success in computers.<br>
<br>In 1967 Humphreys became managing director of ICT. He played the leading role in the merger of ICT and its principal competitor, English Electric Computers, to create International Computers Limited (ICL), Britain's flagship computer manufacturer. The creation of ICL was a major strand of the Wilson government's strategy to create national champions in key industrial sectors. The merger agreement provided government research and development funding for the creation of a new range of computers for the 1970s and beyond (later named the 2900 series).<br>
<br>ICL was vested in July 1968, with Humphreys as its first managing director. In driving the merger forward, Humphreys had been caught up in the political and industrial mood of the time. He would, he later avowed, have preferred the firm to have grown organically, rather than been distracted by the organizational difficulties subsequent to the merger. In the event, the government's research and development subvention was insufficient to develop a new range of computers, and in the early 1970s the entire computer industry fell into a worldwide recession. Following disappointing results, Humphreys was replaced as managing director of ICL by an executive from an American computer company, and he was &#145;kicked upstairs&#146; to become deputy chairman of the company from 1972 to 1977. He remained a director until 1982. During this period the government assisted ICL with loans that enabled it to survive and introduce the 2900 series. ICL was acquired by Fujitsu in 1990. From 1982 Humphreys served as a part-time director of Computer Associated Systems Ltd&#151;later Knowledge Engineering (UK) Ltd. He had a keen interest in computer history and was a trustee of the Charles Babbage Institute for the History of Information Processing, University of Minnesota, from 1978. He had been appointed CBE for services to the computer industry in 1971.<br>
<br>Portly, and balding from middle age, Humphreys had enormous stamina and a genius for friendship. Gruff in speech and with a wry sense of humour, he was held in great affection by colleagues and subordinates. He loved to travel, which enabled him to maintain many international friendships with former officials of companies with whom he had once negotiated. He was a lifelong supporter of Charlton Athletic Football Club and Kent County Cricket Club, and an expert bridge and table tennis player. He had a reputation for being unbeatable at &#145;liar dice&#146;&#151;and he attributed both this, and his business success, to a talent for making good decisions on the basis of uncertain information. Following the death of his first wife in 1970, on 6 December 1975 he married Audrey Norah Urquhart, a 58-year-old widow and clerical officer, and daughter of Edmund Aubrey Dunningham, confectioner. She died in 1985, and in 1994 Humphreys married (Marion) Terry Rushton, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Greest. He died on 29 August 2003 at Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge, of pneumonia and chronic lung disease, and was survived by his wife and the three children of his first marriage.<br>
