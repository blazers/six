<span class="headword">Hutton,  Kurt</span> <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>Kurt Heinrich H&uuml;bschmann]</span>  (1893&#150;1960), <span class="occ">photojournalist</span>, was born in Strasbourg, Alsace (then Germany), on 11 August 1893, the son of J. Heinrich H&uuml;bschmann (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1908), an authority on the Armenian language and professor of comparative philology at Strasbourg University, and his wife, Anna Meyer (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1933), a dressmaker and distant relative of Aby S. Warburg of the international banking family. Anna H&uuml;bschmann was Jewish but her son did not realize this until years later, when the Nazis stamped his passport with a &#145;J&#146;. Indeed, his schooling was at the Protestant <i>Gymnasium</i> in Strasbourg (1902&#150;11); he went on to study in Heidelberg, probably at the university there. In 1911 he attended Queen's College, Oxford, for one or perhaps two years but did not graduate: he wrote in 1947 of &#145;half hearted studies of law interrupted by the War&#146;  (Hutton, introduction). He also spoke of a failed career in law and banking, perhaps in connection with his mother's relations.<br>
<br>During the First World War H&uuml;bschmann was a cavalry officer, and was awarded the Iron Cross, second class, for carrying dispatches. Early in 1918 he contracted tuberculosis and was invalided out of the army, and spent the next two years in a sanatorium at St Moritz in Switzerland. As a boy he had used a quarter-plate camera; while in the sanatorium he experimented with a stereo-camera. He had been a keen tennis and hockey player and at St Moritz began to ski. His skiing companions included Margareta Malvina Rosena Anna Ratchitzky (1899&#150;1962), a dressmaker, and her friend's sister, Frau Gertrude Englehardt; Margareta (known as Gretl) became his wife about 1921, and Gertrude later became his business partner in a photographic studio.<br>
<br>About 1921 H&uuml;bschmann had started his own portrait studio but, within two years, he realized that it was beyond his business ability. Accordingly, he went to work in a large fashionable studio while studying, it is said, with the well-known photographer Germaine Krull. By 1926 he and Gertrude Englehardt had founded the Atelier Englehardt und H&uuml;bschmann in the Berlin suburb of Dahlem; from this period only family portraits have survived. H&uuml;bschmann became dissatisfied with the big studio camera for formal portraiture and began experimenting with the new revolutionary miniature cameras, the Leica and the Contax.<br>
<br>Success still eluded H&uuml;bschmann until Simon Gutmann, the legendary head of the Dephot agency, persuaded him to do a photo-story on a children's festival in nearby Zehlendorf: the photographs were published in the popular weekly <span class="italic">Die Woche</span> in 1929. H&uuml;bschmann became a successful photojournalist working not only for Dephot but for other agencies such as Weltrundschau and Mauritius. His stories appeared in many German magazines including the <span class="italic">M&uuml;nchner Illustrierte Presse</span>, run by the brilliant Stefan Lorant.<br>
<br>When the Nazis came to power H&uuml;bschmann, with his family, and Lorant left Germany in 1933 for England. In 1934 Lorant founded the British <span class="italic">Weekly Illustrated</span>, and he employed H&uuml;bschmann, thus guaranteeing him regular work. (Lorant left the <span class="italic">Weekly Illustrated</span> soon after it was launched and Tom Hopkinson became editor.) At least eighty of H&uuml;bschmann's photo-stories for the publication have been identified between 1934 and 1938.<br>
<br>Edward Hulton founded the <span class="italic">Picture Post</span> in October 1938 with Lorant as editor and Hopkinson as his assistant; H&uuml;bschmann became one of its regular freelance photographers. In June 1940 he was interned as a German alien in the Isle of Man, but when released in June 1941 he continued working for <span class="italic">Picture Post</span>, now as a staff photographer. His son Peter became a captain in the army recce corps and changed his name to Hutten in the belief that this was the spelling of the name of the famous cricketer. Kurt, though always called Hubsch by his friends, used the same name but spelt it correctly as &#145;Hutton&#146;; however, when he officially changed it in 1947 it was to his son's spelling of &#145;Hutten&#146; (though he never used that spelling professionally). Hutton photographed for <span class="italic">Picture Post</span> until 1951, when following a heart attack he and Gretl moved from their rented house at 81 Brooklands Rise in Hampstead Garden Suburb, Middlesex, to Aldeburgh in Suffolk.<br>
<br>Hutton still did occasional stories for <span class="italic">Picture Post</span> with his son's friend Ronald Blythe, later famous as the author of <span class="italic">Akenfield</span> (1969). He continued to photograph the early Aldeburgh festivals, which he had covered since 1947, for his own enjoyment; Benjamin Britten admired his photography, finding that his unobtrusive presence and almost silent Leica never disrupted rehearsals. These swansong photographs, now in the Britten&#150;Pears Library, are in constant demand worldwide for music programmes and magazines; his <span class="italic">Picture Post</span> photographs are in the Hulton&#150;Getty Library, while much of his earlier work for the <span class="italic">Weekly Illustrated</span> is held by Popperfoto. Ironically, after failing as a studio portrait photographer in Berlin, his informal British portraits are among his best-known today, some of which are in the collection of the National Portrait Gallery, London.<br>
<br>Hutton died on 14 March 1960 at his home, 36 Crag Path, Aldeburgh, and was buried in Aldeburgh parish churchyard. Gretl Hutton died of cancer in 1962. Their son Peter emigrated with his family to Australia; some of his father's photographs were still in his possession in the 1990s.<br>
