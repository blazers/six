</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Walker,  Frederick</span>  (1840&#150;1875), <span class="occ">painter and illustrator</span>, was born at 90 Great Titchfield Street, London, on 26 May 1840, the son of William Henry Walker (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1847), a jeweller, and his wife, Ann Powell (<i>d</i>. 1874). W. H. Walker died while Frederick was still a child, from which time he and his seven siblings were supported by their mother, who was a skilled embroiderer. Frederick's paternal grandfather, William Walker, had been a painter of portraits and nature subjects who exhibited at the Royal Academy between 1782 and 1808.<h2>
<a name="Educationandillustrationwork"></a>Education and illustration work</h2>Walker attended the North London Collegiate School in Camden Town until the age of fifteen, when he was placed as an apprentice and draughtsman in the office of Messrs Baker and Harris, architects in Gower Street. In 1857 he enrolled at Leigh's academy, and in March the following year he entered the Royal Academy Schools. During this time he regularly drew from antique sculpture in the British Museum. Walker was notoriously inattentive as a student, both at Leigh's and at the Royal Academy. Towards the end of 1858 he was employed by Josiah Wood Whymper in Lambeth as an apprentice designer of woodblock illustrations, where he was to work three days a week for two years. There he met Charles Green and John William North, both fellow apprentices; the latter became Walker's closest friend. In 1859 he enrolled at the Langham Artists' Society, a club where young painters worked together on specified subjects and then compared the resulting sketches.<br>
<br>By 1860 Walker's reputation as a designer of black and white illustrations was sufficiently well established for him to embark on a freelance career. His output as an illustrator during the first half of the 1860s was considerable, contributing as he did to periodicals such as <span class="italic">Good Words</span>, <span class="italic">Once a Week</span>, and the <span class="italic">Cornhill Magazine</span>. His series of illustrations for Thackeray's novel <span class="italic">The Adventures of Philip</span>, which was serialized in the <span class="italic">Cornhill Magazine</span> in 1861&#150;2, were admired by a wide public and by the author himself. Walker had been asked in the first instance to adapt Thackeray's own sketches, but after the first two and following his plea that he should be allowed to contribute designs of his own invention he was given virtually a free hand. The illustration entitled <span class="italic">Thanksgiving</span>, later worked up as the watercolour drawing known as <span class="italic">Philip in Church</span> (Tate collection), ended the series and was published in August 1862. In addition, Walker made drawings for the Dalziel brothers, for publications including both <span class="italic">Hard Times</span> and <span class="italic">Reprinted Pieces</span> by Charles Dickens. Dalziel commissioned a series of thirty illustrations of countryside subjects from Walker, but found that increasing pressure of work meant that only about a third of the project was fulfilled. Other artists, among them George John Pinwell and J. W. North, were brought in, and the resulting volume was entitled <span class="italic">A Round of Days</span> (1866). This was followed by <span class="italic">Wayside Posies</span> (1867), also produced by Dalziel and published by Routledge. The engraver Joseph Swain, who cut many of the woodblocks that Walker designed, wrote of Walker's method: &#145;In working out the minutest detail Walker was painfully conscientious. This was even shown in the backgrounds of his illustrations, most of which were drawn on the blocks from nature&#146;  (Goldman, <span class="italic">Victorian Illustration</span>, 125).<h2>
<a name="Watercolourpaintings"></a>Watercolour paintings</h2>In the early 1860s Walker was turning increasingly to painting, treating domestic and genre subjects, some of which were derived from his work as an illustrator, and working both in oil and watercolour. His first exhibited work at the Royal Academy&#151;<span class="italic">The Lost Path</span> (priv. coll.), shown in 1863&#151;was badly hung, but none the less attracted admiring attention. In February the following year he was elected as an associate member of the Old Watercolour Society and exhibited the watercolour version of <span class="italic">Philip in Church</span>, previously treated as an illustration, as a trial piece. At the society's summer exhibition of 1864 he showed the elaborate watercolour <span class="italic">Spring</span>, while the following year he sent its pendant, <span class="italic">Autumn</span> (both V&amp;A). He was also regularly represented in the society's winter exhibitions of drawings and sketches.<br>
<br>Walker's use of bodycolour was elaborate and very personal, and as a technique identified him as one of the younger generation who believed that the method of blending pigment with commercially manufactured Chinese white paint to give opaque areas of colour was a legitimate way of gaining depth of tone and richness of compositional effect. This was a technique still regarded with disfavour by the older members of the Watercolour Society, and about 1865 Walker caricatured himself squeezing paint out of an enormous tube, with the caption &#145;What <i>would</i> &#147;The Society&#148; say if it could only see me?&#146; In 1876, on the occasion of the memorial exhibition of Walker's paintings and drawings, John Ruskin commented unkindly on the artist's &#145;semi-miniature, quarter fresco, quarter wash manner of his own&#151;exquisitely clever, and reaching, under such clever management, delightfullest results here and there, but which betrays his genius into perpetual experiment instead of achievement&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works of John Ruskin</span>, 14.340).<br>
<br>In his watercolour compositions of the 1860s and early 1870s Walker devised his most characteristic subject type, in which figures go about their daily routines in either rustic or urban settings. A subject such as <span class="italic">My Front Garden</span> (Harris Museum and Art Gallery, Preston), exhibited at the Watercolour Society in the winter of 1864&#150;5, shows the immediate precinct of the house in St Petersburgh Place, Bayswater, which he shared with his mother and siblings from 1863, and a postman handing letters to a housekeeper. Of his careful attention to the forms of nature, but avoidance of mechanical realism, J. W. North wrote of his friend's method:<blockquote>Walker painted direct from nature, not from sketches. His ideal appeared to be to have suggestiveness in his work; not by leaving out, but by painting in, detail, and then partly erasing it. [His work] frequently passed through a stage of extreme elaboration of drawing, to be afterwards carefully worn away, so that a suggestiveness and softness resulted&#151;not emptiness, but veiled detail. His knowledge of nature was sufficient to disgust him with the ordinary conventions which do duty for grass, leaves, and boughs; and there is scarcely an inch of his work that has not been at one time a careful, loving study of fact. (Marks, 168)</blockquote>
<h2>
<a name="Oilpaintings"></a>Oil paintings</h2>Walker had ambitions to be known for large-scale oils as well as for watercolours. In 1867 he returned as an exhibitor at the Royal Academy, with the remarkable canvas <span class="italic">The Bathers</span> (Lady Lever Art Gallery, Port Sunlight), showing boys swimming and playing together beside the River Thames. From the early 1860s Walker had been connected with the group of St John's Wood artists who called themselves The Clique, and among which his fellows were P. H. Calderon, G. D. Leslie, J. E. Hodgson, W. F. Yeames, G. A. Storey, and H. Stacy Marks. It was perhaps contact with artists in this circle that caused Walker to introduce symbolical elements and a more generalized evocation of the landscape in his academy exhibits. Walker was much praised for his oil <span class="italic">The Old Gate</span> (Tate collection) when it was exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1869, and in fact received a personal commendation from Frederic Leighton, who served on the hanging committee that year. The following year he showed another Somerset subject, <span class="italic">The Plough</span> (Tate collection), a work that secured his election as an associate of the Royal Academy in January 1871.<h2>
<a name="Travelandfinalyears"></a>Travel and final years</h2>Although Walker was based in London, most of his work was done in different parts of the countryside&#151;his most favoured haunts being the Thames valley around the village of Cookham, where his mother had a cottage; the Quantock Hills in north Somerset, where he stayed with J. W. North at Halsway Manor, and later at Woolstone Moor; and the Scottish highlands, to which he went on fishing expeditions to Corrichoillie with Richard Ansdell and often stayed with his friend and patron William Graham MP, at Stobhall on the River Tay. Occasionally he ventured overseas&#151;to Paris in 1863 and 1866; and to Venice in 1868 and 1870. A breakdown in his health in 1873&#151;presumably the first symptom of the consumption that was to cause his death two years later&#151;led to his visiting Algiers, in company with North, in the winter of 1873&#150;4. Whenever he was abroad he found himself desperately homesick; in Algiers he cried piteously: &#145;I shall never see a hansom cab again&#146;  (Marks, 291).<br>
<br>Walker remained busy through the year 1874, taking up various unfinished canvases, such as <span class="italic">Mushroom Gatherers</span>, and completing <span class="italic">The Right of Way</span> (National Gallery of Victoria, Melbourne). In May 1875 he travelled to Scotland, and this was despite worries about his deteriorating state of health. At St Fillans on Loch Earn in Perthshire he collapsed; his twin sister Mary Marks was sent for, and she was with him when he died on 4 June, at the Drummond Arms Hotel. His body was taken south, and was buried on 8 June 1875 in Cookham churchyard, beside that of his mother, Ann, who had died in the previous November. He was unmarried. Henry Armstead's sculpted profile portrait of Walker remains in Cookham church, and conveys the same distinctive appearance that the artist himself had often shown in his delightful self-portrait caricatures, a number of which are reproduced in J. G. Marks's biography of his late brother-in-law, <span class="italic">The Life and Letters of Frederick Walker</span> (1896).<br>
<br>A memorial exhibition of Walker's works was held at Deschamps Gallery in New Bond Street in the spring of 1876. A notice of the exhibition in the <span class="italic">Art Journal</span> made the observation that, &#145;like Millet, and Mason, and Pinwell, [Walker's] sympathies went forth to what was lowly and familiar, and his genius sublimed common things into the region of poetry and Art&#146;  (<span class="italic">Art Journal</span>, 38, 1876, 85).<br>
