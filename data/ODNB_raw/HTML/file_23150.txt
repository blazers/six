<span class="headword">Rastell,  John</span>  (1530&#150;1577), <span class="occ">author and Jesuit</span>, was born in Gloucester of a family prominent in local commerce and administration. He was admitted to Winchester College in 1543 and later attended New College, Oxford, graduating BA before his election as fellow in 1549, and proceeding MA on 26 June 1555. Rastell's career at Oxford ended in 1560, when he fled England for Louvain, joining other fellows of his college in exile for religion's sake.<br>
<br>Marking the period immediately preceding Rastell's flight was the so-called &#145;challenge sermon&#146;, preached at Paul's Cross in November 1559 and March 1560 by John Jewel, bishop of Salisbury, who attacked various Roman Catholic practices and beliefs as things unknown during the first six hundred years of Christianity. Before leaving England, Rastell wrote his <span class="italic">A Confutation of a Sermon, Prounounced by M. Juell, at Paules Crosse</span>. On account of the censorship of Roman Catholic authors in England, Rastell wrote (as he says in a preface) for &#145;one frind alone, to auoyde feare of foes&#146;  (Rastell, <span class="italic">Confutation</span>, sig. A2<i>v</i>). The book was published at Antwerp in November 1564, after Rastell had become a candidate in theology at Louvain.<br>
<br>Rastell's book was ignored by Jewel and other protestant controversialists, who concentrated their fire against Catholic doctors of divinity (especially Thomas Harding, another former Winchester and Oxford scholar). Nevertheless Rastell continued to publish books opposing Jewel. In January 1565 he issued a partly satirical challenge to Jewel, <span class="italic">A Copie of a Challenge</span>, originally the final section of his <span class="italic">A Confutation</span>. Two months later appeared Rastell's <span class="italic">A Replie Against an Answer (Falslie Intitled) In Defence of the Truth</span>, taking issue with a book by the Oxford protestant Thomas Cooper, who had in 1562 attacked an anonymous Catholic answer to Jewel. Like Jewel, Cooper never answered Rastell. Nevertheless Rastell continued his side of the book war, in early 1566 answering one of Jewel's responses to Harding with <span class="italic">A Treatise Intitled, Beware of M. Jewel</span>, in two books, followed in November 1566 by <span class="italic">The third booke, declaring by examples out of auncient councels, fathers, and later writers, that it is time to beware of M. Jewel</span>. Still failing to provoke any response, in 1567 Rastell published one more controversial work, <span class="italic">A briefe shew of the false wares packt together in the named, apology of the Churche of England</span>, supporting Harding's <span class="italic">Confutation</span> (1565) of Jewel's <span class="italic">An Apologie, or, Answere in Defence of the Churche of Englande</span> (1564). Rastell's final effort too was disregarded by subsequent controversialists; not until 1579 was any notice taken of him, when William Fulke published &#145;A refutation of Maister John Rastels confutation&#146;, one part of a book bracketing answers to three Catholic writers. Fulke cites yet another work by Rastell, &#145;Rastels returne of untruths&#146;, which (Fulke says) was &#145;answered by M. Jewell&#146;, although neither book is extant or mentioned anywhere else.<br>
<br>Ordained a priest in 1566 Rastell later left the Spanish Netherlands for Rome, entering the Society of Jesus on 4 April 1568, three weeks after his younger brother Edward had also become a Jesuit novice there. Both brothers were posted to Bavaria in 1569, John to assist Peter Canisius at Dillingen in writing his book against the Magdeburg Centurists. Rastell served also at Augsburg and Halle; he was appointed vice-rector at Ingolstadt before May 1576 and died there on 5 June 1577.<br>
