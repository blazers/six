<span class="headword">Taylor,  Thomas</span>  (1786&#150;1848), <span class="occ">botanist and physician</span>, was born on 10 May 1786 in a boat on the Ganges River in India, the eldest in the family of at least six children of Joseph Irwin Taylor (1765&#150;1811), a wealthy major in the Bengal artillery of the East India Company, and his wife, an Indian woman known as Poor Begum. The Taylor family, freethinking Unitarians, had settled near Kenmare in co. Kerry in 1650 and Taylor's grandfather had inherited the townland of Dunkerron. About 1793 Taylor was sent back to Ireland for schooling&#151;he attended the French School at Cork. He proceeded to Trinity College, Dublin, graduating BA, in 1807, MB, and MD in 1814. He married his cousin Harriet, daughter of Colonel Thomas Taylor, on 6 September 1809. She had also been born in India and educated in Ireland; they later had two sons and a daughter.<br>
<br>Taylor remained in Dublin after his graduation; he was physician-in-ordinary to Sir Patrick Dun's Hospital until 1820, when he was appointed professor of natural history in the Royal Cork Scientific Institution. In 1830 he retired to the family property at Dunkerron where he lived in increasingly declining circumstances as physician, magistrate, and farmer. During the 1840s he was physician to the union workhouse at Kenmare until he contracted the &#145;fever&#146; and died at his home on 4 February 1848. He was buried in the protestant cemetery at Kenmare.<br>
<br>Taylor was a member of the Royal Irish Academy, and became a fellow of the Linnean Society in 1813. His chief interests were botanical, especially bryophytes (both mosses and liverworts) and lichens, on which he published thirty-four papers or books, some of which were collaborative works with either William Jackson Hooker or Joseph Dalton Hooker. His major works included <span class="italic">Muscologia Britannica</span> (with W. J. Hooker) in 1818; &#145;Lichenes&#146; in Mackay's <span class="italic">Flora Hibernica</span> of 1836 (the first major Irish lichen flora); and significant contributions, with J. D. Hooker, on southern hemisphere hepatics and lichens collected by Hooker on his Antarctic voyage of 1839&#150;43. Taylor's herbarium, purchased in 1849 by the wealthy Bostonian, John Amory Lovell, passed to the Boston Society of Natural History, and then to the Farlow Herbarium of Cryptogamic Botany at Harvard. Taylor, either alone or in collaboration with the Hookers described more than 800 new cryptogamic species. His name is commemorated in the moss genus <i>Tayloria</i>, named by W. J. Hooker in 1816.<br>
