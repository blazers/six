<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Ashe,  Simeon</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1662), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, was admitted in April 1613 to Emmanuel College, Cambridge, where he was a prot&eacute;g&eacute; of Thomas Hooker, and ordained deacon and priest at Peterborough on 5 and 6 October 1619. Nothing is known for certain of his parentage or early life, although he clearly had close connections with Ashby-de-la-Zouch, Leicestershire. After Cambridge he served a clerical apprenticeship under the noted puritan minister of the town, Arthur Hildersham, and led the godly of the county in prayer and fasting during Hildersham's last illness. Ashe was apparently vicar of Rugeley, Staffordshire, by 1627, but fell foul of the authorities for his opposition to the <span class="roman">Book of Sports</span>. Shortly afterwards he became chaplain to the radical puritan Robert Greville, second Lord Brooke, travelling with his patron and preaching regularly at Warwick Castle when Brooke was in residence. Ashe was a central figure in the &#145;puritan opposition&#146; to Charles I, involved in many of the clerical conferences that debated the proper responses to the innovations of the 1630s, and in touch, through Brooke, with the most prominent lay opponents of royal government. Ashe was a more moderate figure than Brooke, committed throughout his life to a disciplined national church. Along with John Ball and others, he sent pointed queries to the ministers of New England revealing their anxiety at the tendencies to separatism and at the power given to congregations in the New England church. Ashe and William Rathband oversaw the publication of these exchanges in 1643, as <span class="italic">A Letter of Many Ministers in Old England</span>, a contribution to the emerging controversy over church government in old England.<br>
<br>Ashe was committed to the overall reform of the English church. He played a large part in the clerical protests against Laudianism, both in the midlands and in the national co-ordination of petitions into the ministers' remonstrance presented to the Long Parliament. He preached a rousing fast sermon to the House of Commons in March 1642, published as <span class="italic">The Best Refuge for the Most Oppressed</span> (1642), insisting that the removal of &#145;prelacy&#146; was necessary before the church could be reformed, and he was appointed to the Westminster assembly in 1643, replacing a clergyman who died before its first meeting. His activities there were mostly in the later 1640s when he had given up service with the army.<br>
<br>At the outbreak of the civil war Ashe became chaplain to the regiment of Edward Montagu, Lord Mandeville (later the second earl of Manchester), in the earl of Essex's army, and he moved to the army of the eastern association in the summer of 1643 when Manchester became its commander. Ashe travelled with the army and in the summer of 1644 he and another of Manchester's chaplains published a series of newsletters with a vivid account of the battle of Marston Moor, <span class="italic">A Continuation of True Intelligence from the English and Scottish Forces</span>. The Scottish minister resident in London, Robert Baillie, regretted that his friend Ashe's account gave &#145;much more to Cromwell&#146; and the Independents than was their due, underplaying the role of the Scottish presbyterians in that great victory  (<span class="italic">Letters and Journals of Robert Baillie</span>, 2.209). The sufferings of the soldiers in 1644, along with Manchester's resignation following the self-denying ordinance, ended Ashe's career as a military chaplain. Thereafter he was based in London, becoming one of the most determined of the City presbyterians, close to Baillie and others working to bring the English church into line with the more rigorous Scottish kirk. Ashe defended Manchester against Oliver Cromwell's attacks and acted as an intermediary between the Lords and the City presbyterians. He signed the &#145;Desires and reasons&#146; of the ministers in November 1645, which outlined to the City's common council clerical objections to the parliament's limited presbyterian legislation. With Edmund Calamy he preached a hard-line, high-profile sermon when the City authorities renewed their commitment to the solemn league and covenant in January 1646 as a symbol of their zeal for a presbyterian church and their hostility to sectarianism; this was published as <span class="italic">Religious Covenanting Directed and Covenant Keeping Perswaded</span> (1646). Ashe, again with Calamy, was heavily involved in the unrest in the City in the summer of 1647 when presbyterian zealots sought to raise a military force to counter the influence of the Independent New Model Army. But, like most ministers of City and assembly, Ashe drew back from the brink as the New Model Army approached the City and, with Calamy and Thomas Case, took a plea for peace to the City militia committee in early August. He was, predictably, one of fifty-two City ministers who in December signed <span class="italic">A Testimony to the Truth of Jesus Christ, and to our Solemn League and Covenant, as also Against the Errours, Heresies and Blasphemies of these Times and the Toleration of them</span> (1648).<br>
<br>Ashe was prominent among the presbyterian ministers who lobbied New Model Army leaders in December 1648 and January 1649 in a vain attempt to prevent the regicide, a horrendous breach of the solemn league and covenant and a betrayal, in presbyterian eyes, of the cause for which the civil war had been fought; their arguments appeared in <span class="italic">A Serious and Faithfull Representation</span> (1649) and <span class="italic">A Vindication of the Ministers of the Gospel in and about London</span> (1649). Although there is no evidence Ashe was involved with the presbyterian-royalist plots for which Christopher Love was executed in 1651, he was a loyal friend to Love and with Edmund Calamy attended him on the scaffold. Temperamentally Ashe was neither a martyr nor a natural conspirator. With Calamy, Jeremiah Whitaker, and others, he oversaw the posthumous publication of the martyr's works as a less provocative way of keeping presbyterian aspirations alive.<br>
<br>Ashe spent more than twenty years in London but did not hold a pastoral charge until 1655, preferring to concentrate on lecturing on the one hand, and service in the extra-parochial London presbyterian committees or classes on the other. In March 1642 he was recommended by the House of Commons as lecturer at St Bride's, Fleet Street, and he was still described as of St Bride's in 1645&#150;6, but there is no evidence of his activity in the extensive parish records. Churchwardens' accounts of St Michael Bassishaw record the payment of &pound;10 per annum to Ashe in 1646&#150;51 as preacher of weekly lectures on Tuesdays and Sunday afternoons, while from October 1651 until January 1655 he acted as assistant to his friend and ally of long-standing, Edmund Calamy, preaching every Sunday and assisting with the administration of the sacrament at St Mary Aldermanbury. He was also one of the Cornhill lecturers. Finally, in 1655, Ashe became parish minister of St Augustine by St Paul, Watling Street, in succession to an equally hot presbyterian, Francis Roberts. Ashe was active in the relevant classes and in the London Provincial Assembly throughout. He was nominated as a &#145;trier&#146; for elders in the fifth London classis in October 1645 and September 1646, and acted as a delegate to the assembly from the seventh classis (1647&#150;9); the sixth classis (1652&#150;6); and the first classis (1658). He served as moderator of the assembly in 1652.<br>
<br>Ashe was a conscientious editor of key puritan and presbyterian works, preparing those of friends such as John Ball, Ephraim Huitt, and Love for the press. His own publications were mostly of set-piece sermons&#151;above all of funeral sermons, of which he was the most famous preacher of his day. Many ministers asked Ashe to preach at their funerals, and took pains to ensure he had ample information on their lives, notably the octogenarian Thomas Gataker (<span class="italic">Gray Hayres Crowned with Grace</span>, 1655). Other notable subjects were Jeremiah Whitaker, Jonathan to Ashe's David (<span class="italic">Living Loves betwixt Christ and Dying Christians</span>, 1654), and Ralph Robinson (<span class="italic">The Good Mans Death Lamented</span>, 1655). In these sermons Ashe celebrated the tradition of the &#145;good old nonconformists&#146; who had suffered under prelacy and worked devotedly to establish a presbyterian national church. Although the deaths of godly ministers in the 1650s could be seen as God's judgment on a sinful nation that had rejected godly reform, Ashe's praises also revealed the resilience of the ordained ministry in the national church and their remarkable successes in difficult times.<br>
<br>Ashe corresponded with Baillie throughout the 1650s, the two men sharing their disquiet at the liberty allowed under the Cromwellian regime, and denouncing attacks on their own high Calvinism. Richard Baxter, agreed Ashe, was &#145;doubtless a godly man, though tenacious in his mistakes&#146; on justification  (<span class="italic">Letters and Journals of Robert Baillie</span>, 3.302&#150;7). Despite his horror at the regicide and the rise of sectarian religion, Ashe remained committed to the cause of moderate parliamentarianism. In the dedication to the earl of Manchester in the printed funeral sermon for Manchester's wife he denounced the radical hijacking of the parliamentary cause and praised:<blockquote>your lordship (with all others) who continue firm to their primary principles from the aspersions of distempered spirits. When the late king forsook his parliament, being misguided by evil counsellors, the raising of an army was judged necessary to restore peace, preserve religion, establish fundamental laws and secure the ancient privileges of parliament. This was the good old cause, held forth by the Solemn League and Covenant &hellip; others crying up the good old cause, do pollute religion, violate laws, tear parliaments into pieces and govern according to their own pleasure. (<span class="italic">The Faithfull Christians Gain by Death</span>, 1658)</blockquote>Ashe, like Manchester, therefore welcomed the restoration of Charles II, and he was among the ministers who travelled to Breda to welcome the king.<br>
<br>Ashe was married with a &#145;family&#146; in the 1630s but no surviving children of his are mentioned in the will he made late in life, and his widow, Susanna, may have been a second wife (a Simeon Ashe married Susanna Miller in Derbyshire in 1658). Ashe was &#145;frail&#146; when he made his will in December 1661, and died shortly before the imposition of the <span class="roman">Act of Uniformity</span> on 24 August 1662. He was &#145;bury'd the very even of Bartholemew Day&#146;, that is, on 23 August, his funeral sermon preached by his old friend Calamy&#151;&#145;the last office of love for an eminent and antient servant of Jesus Christ, and excellent Minister of the Gospel &hellip; one who hath formerly performed this office for many other Ministers&#146;  (Calamy). Besides substantial provision for his widow, her daughter, and a married niece, Ashe left generous bequests to a range of kin, friends, and charitable concerns, especially to the poor of Ashby. His trustees included long-standing friends among the puritan &eacute;lite, such as Anthony Tuckney and John Micklethwaite, and those remembered in bequests included William Dillingham of Emmanuel College and Matthew Newcomen of Dedham. Widows of old friends such as John Ball, William Taylor, and the &#145;Love plotter&#146;, Thomas Cawton, were not forgotten. Ashe's property, mainly in Derbyshire and Lincolnshire, must have been worth some &pound;5000, suggesting that his rather chequered career had been materially rewarding. The looming difficulties for City presbyterians were clearly in Ashe's mind, and his will arranged for rings to be given to &#145;forty ministers my friends in London and elsewhere&#146; with the inscription, &#145;I am not ashamed of the Gospell of Christ&#146;.<br>
