<span class="headword">Rankine, Sir  John</span>  (1846&#150;1922), <span class="occ">jurist</span>, was born at Sorn, Ayrshire, on 18 February 1846, the eldest of the seven surviving children of the Revd John Rankine DD (1816&#150;1885), Church of Scotland minister at Sorn, and his wife, Jane (1819&#150;1879), daughter of Charles Simson of Threepwood, Langshaw, Roxburghshire. After schooling at Sorn and at Ayr Academy, he attended Edinburgh Academy from 1859 to 1861. He matriculated at the University of Edinburgh in 1861 and graduated MA in 1865. He embarked on legal study in the University of Edinburgh in 1866 before proceeding to Heidelberg, where he studied Roman law under C. A. von Vangerow, whom, according to Logan Turner, he was always later to refer to as &#145;my revered teacher&#146;.<br>
<br>After returning to Edinburgh Rankine was admitted as an advocate on 17 December 1869, joining a bar which was enjoying an intellectual revival and to which he was to make a distinguished contribution. According to Sir James Balfour Paul, Rankine &#145;had never a great forensic practice, but as a chamber counsel his opinion was much sought after and valued&#146;  (Paul, 306). A conservative in politics, he served briefly as an advocate-depute in 1885.<br>
<br>Rankine was elected professor of Scottish law in the University of Edinburgh early in 1888. He held this office with great distinction until his retirement in 1922 and was reputed to be an excellent teacher. A factor in this appointment was his important scholarly publications, the first of which was <span class="italic">The Law of Landownership in Scotland</span> (1879). An epoch-making work, it was the first authoritative survey of the law in this field; a fourth edition appeared in 1909, and was regularly used throughout the twentieth century. In 1887 Rankine published <span class="italic">The Law of Leases</span>. This also became a standard authority in its own day and reached a third edition in 1916. In 1921, towards the end of his life, Rankine published <span class="italic">A Treatise on the Law of Personal Bar in Scotland</span>, which, though it was the fruit of five years' research, was not a success. Rankine used as his textbook John Erskine's <span class="italic">Principles of the Law of Scotland</span>, which he edited four times between 1890 and 1911. He was also a general editor of the <span class="italic">Scottish Revised Reports</span>. A lighter side is revealed by his contributions to <span class="italic">Ballads of the Bench and Bar</span> in 1882.<br>
<br>Rankine's academic excellence was recognized in 1891 when he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh and again in 1892 when the University of Glasgow conferred on him the honorary degree of LLD. When a Scottish roll of queen's counsel was instituted in 1897 Rankine was one of the first appointed. He served as a governor of the Royal Infirmary, the Royal Veterinary College, Donaldson's Hospital, and the Edinburgh Royal Asylum. As one might expect of a man with three brothers-in-law who were ministers, one of whom was professor of divinity in the University of Glasgow, Rankine was active in the Church of Scotland though he never became an elder. He served on the church's foreign mission committee, travelling abroad on its behalf to India in 1884 and to South Africa in 1902. His public services were recognized in 1921, when he was knighted.<br>
<br>Rankine had comfortable personal means. Genial and impressively whiskered, he was very fond of cigars and shooting. He never married but lived with his unmarried brother, Charles Rankine Simson, writer to the signet, whose estate of Threepwood (inherited through their mother) Rankine in turn inherited on his brother's death in 1911. He divided his time between his estate of 1000 acres and his house at 23 Ainslie Place, Edinburgh. Shortly after retirement from the chair, Rankine died suddenly at Threepwood on 8 August 1922.<br>
