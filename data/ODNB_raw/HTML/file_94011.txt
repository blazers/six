<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Dower,  John Gordon</span>  (1900&#150;1947), <span class="occ">architect and promoter of national parks</span>, was born at 1 Ashburn Place, Ilkley, Yorkshire on 2 September 1900, the eldest child of Robert Shillito Dower (1870&#150;1953), company director of George Depledge, steel merchant, Leeds, and a Methodist lay preacher, and his wife, Mary Amelia Cobb (Millicent), <i>n&eacute;e</i> Hearnshaw (1872&#150;1916). After attending Ghyll Royd preparatory school, Ilkley, and the Leys School, Cambridge, he was a foundation scholar at St John's College, Cambridge, taking the historical tripos and examinations in architecture (1919&#150;23).<br>
<br>Articled to Sir Herbert Baker as an architectural assistant, Dower passed the examinations of the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA) by self-tuition. In 1931 he set up in private practice with, in his words, an &#145;almost accidental tendency to specialize in housing and town planning&#146;  (private information). He designed housing for the Shoreditch Housing Association, and experimented with steel and other new materials. As secretary of the RIBA aerodromes committee, he wrote two reports on the design of aerodromes, their buildings, and their relationship to their surroundings and other forms of transport. An active member of the Town Planning Institute and of the pressure group Political and Economic Planning (PEP), he became increasingly involved in discussions as to the extent and nature of national planning, presenting a paper on regional planning to the congress of the International Federation of Housing and Town Planning in Stockholm in 1939. He also lectured at the London Polytechnic.<br>
<br>On 3 September 1929 Dower married Pauline Trevelyan (1905&#150;1988). Her father, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36553/', "Sir Charles Philips Trevelyan, third baronet")</script>, had moved one of the early access to mountains bills as a young Liberal MP, and served as president of the Board of Education in the first and second Labour governments. Her uncle, George Macaulay Trevelyan, the social historian, was president of the Youth Hostels Association, and a major benefactor to the National Trust. As well as social work in the East End of London, Dower often joined the Trevelyan weekend parties at Wallington, walking over the Northumberland moors and becoming a keen fly-fisherman. He became master of the Trevelyan hunt in 1932, a grandly energetic, annual three-day manhunt over the western fells of the Lake District.<br>
<br>Dower's involvement in rural planning developed through a partnership with the architect and planner (William) Harding Thompson (1887&#150;1946), and more particularly extensive surveys of south-west England for local branches of the Council for the Protection of Rural England (CPRE) and Somerset county council. He designed youth hostels at Malham, Bellingham, and Eskdale in Cumberland. He was the drafting secretary of the CPRE's standing committee on national parks, and over 40,000 copies of his pamphlet <span class="italic">The Case for National Parks in Great Britain</span> were distributed in 1938, accompanied by a vigorous press campaign and a series of public meetings. In 1939 he drafted a &#145;Summary of proposed provisions for a national parks bill&#146;, envisaging a national parks commission that would designate both national parks and nature sanctuaries, and act as the planning authority within those areas. War intervened before the draft bill could be publicized or promoted in parliament.<br>
<br>As a member of the officer reserve, Dower joined the Royal Engineers as soon as war broke out, but he contracted virulent tuberculosis while surveying the Dover harbour installations, and was invalided out. In August 1942 the principal assistant secretary to the Ministry of Works and Buildings, (Harold) Graham Vincent (1891&#150;1981), who knew Dower through PEP, appointed him to a small section charged with the physical planning of post-war reconstruction, with William Holford as its head. Dower was given oversight of rural policy successively in the Ministry of Works and Planning and the Ministry of Town and Country Planning. An assistant secretary in the Ministry of Works, (Francis) Blaise Gillie (1908&#150;1981), later recalled him as a warm and attractive personality, with a real vision of the broader amenity problem  (Sheail, 7). Dower was specifically asked to carry out a factual inquiry into &#145;the practical needs in certain (national-park) areas&#146;  (TNA: PRO, HLG 92/46). He recognized at once the outstanding opportunity for giving effect to the causes he had so long championed. With the strong endorsement for national parks given by Lord Justice Scott's committee on land utilisation in rural areas (1941&#150;2), Dower was asked to prepare &#145;a report on the general issues backed by the specific information which he had obtained&#146;  (ibid.). His report was first circulated for comment among government departments in November 1943. Not only was there opportunity further to develop the earlier proposals of the standing committee on national parks, but the context was now much fuller. If over 80 per cent of the population of England and Wales was to live and work in towns and cities, with little or no further encroachment by way of suburbs, there must be greater opportunity to enjoy the amenities of the countryside. Where town and country must remain discrete, neither should be managed without close reference to the other.<br>
<br>In a paper delivered to RIBA in March 1943 (published in the <span class="italic">Journal of the Royal Institute of British Architects</span>, 50, 1943, 181&#150;4), Dower argued that the holiday use of the countryside and coast, if generously encouraged and wisely directed, might become one of the most fruitful objectives of post-war reconstruction policy. It was second to none in giving physical, mental, and spiritual health and happiness to &#145;the whole mass of the people&#146;. The large and rapidly growing demand, so visible before the war, stemmed from three movements. One was the increase in leisure time. A second was the ever-widening popular appreciation of &#145;natural landscape beauty&#146;. The third and most obvious was the rapid advances in &#145;mechanical transport&#146;. All three were popular, good, and irresistible movements, but a degree of control and direction&#151;in short, planning&#151;was needed.<br>
<br>Dower now spoke both as a leading figure in the voluntary movement, and with the perspectives that came with the emerging powers and responsibilities of the Ministry of Town and Country Planning. As William Holford recalled, he wrote &#145;continuously and with increasing decision, as if he felt that the project could only be hammered out at white heat&#146;. He was an administrative and technical committee in one, penetrating a maze of detail &#145;which was all put in order, and added to the argument&#146;. Further drafts of his national parks report &#145;compelled the admiration of every officer that sat round the table&#146;  (Holford).<br>
<br>During the last days of the wartime coalition government, in May 1945, the minister of town and country planning, W. S. Morrison, obtained the consent of the cabinet's reconstruction committee to publication of Dower's recommendations as the work &#145;of a member of his Department acting as consultant&#146;  (TNA: PRO, CAB 87/10). The publication of the &#145;one-man White Paper&#146;  (Holford) later that month, <span class="italic">National Parks in England and Wales</span>, was of pivotal importance in finally establishing the principles by which national parks were to be designated. Whatever their meaning in North America and Africa, the words &#145;national park&#146; signified in England and Wales an extensive area of beautiful and relatively wild country in which, for the nation's benefit and by appropriate national decision and action, four objects were met. The characteristic landscape had to be strictly preserved; access and facilities for public open-air enjoyment were amply provided; wildlife, and buildings and places of architectural and historic interest, were suitably protected; and &#145;established farming use&#146; was effectively maintained.<br>
<br>Dower's report recommended the establishment of a preparatory national parks commission. The cabinet's reconstruction committee authorized instead the appointment of a national parks committee, under Sir Arthur Hobhouse (1886&#150;1965), to investigate further the practicality of a series of national parks and their administration. In spite of failing health Dower exerted considerable influence over the drafting of its report, published as a white paper in July 1947. Dower died of pulmonary tuberculosis on 3 October 1947 at his home, Cambo House, Cambo, Morpeth, Northumberland. His ashes were scattered on Ilkley Moor.<br>
<br>Dower had the trained mind of an administrator, the skill of an architect with a good eye for country, and enthusiasm, incisiveness, and lucidity with the pen, which conveyed an effective vision of the broader questions at a critical juncture in twentieth-century land-use planning. The <span class="roman">National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act</span> of 1949 provided the statutory basis for national parks in England and Wales, of which ten were declared in the first ten years. Dower would, however, have been disappointed as to the advisory, as opposed to executive, status conferred on the National Parks Commission. His widow, Pauline Dower, was one of the pioneers who gave effect to national parks and the concept of areas of outstanding natural beauty, serving as a commissioner for sixteen years (latterly as deputy chairman) and as a member of the Northumberland National Park Committee for ten years. They had a daughter, Susan, and two sons&#151;Michael, a town and country planner, who served as national park officer of the Peak District (1985&#150;92) and as director-general of the Countryside Commission (the successor body to the National Parks Commission) from 1992 to 1996, and Robin, an architect who served as a countryside commissioner from 1982 to 1991 and as a member of the Northumberland National Park Committee. The Countryside Commission's headquarters, when opened in Cheltenham in 1975, were given the name John Dower House. The youth hostel at Malham is the John Dower Memorial Hostel.<br>
