<span class="headword">Farrier,  Robert</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1795, <em>d.</em> 1879), <span class="occ">painter</span>, was baptized on 11 December 1795 at St Luke's Church, Chelsea, London, the eldest child of Robert Farrier (<i>bap</i>. 1763) and his wife, Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Wymark (<i>d</i>. 1847). His father was a successful tailor based in Chelsea, where the younger Robert lived throughout his life. He studied as an engraver, but progressed to miniature painting and then entered the Royal Academy Schools in January 1820, at the age of twenty-four. He first exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1818, sending some miniature portraits, and in 1819 he exhibited the first of a series of pictures of amusing domestic subjects, especially scenes from schoolboy life. These became popular, and a number of them were engraved for the annuals, for example <span class="italic">The Schoolboy&#151;&#145;he Whistled Loud to Keep his Courage Up&#146; (Blair's Grave)</span>, (exh. Royal Academy, 1824); <span class="italic">Sunday Morning&#151;the Toilet</span> (exh. Royal Academy, 1825); <span class="italic">Sunday Evening</span> and <span class="italic">The Declaration</span> were engraved by J. Romney. Other pictures by Farrier that were engraved include <span class="italic">The Loiterer</span>, by Mrs W. H. Simmons; <span class="italic">Hesitation</span>, by C. Rolls; <span class="italic">Minnie O'Donnell's Toilet</span>, by E. Portbury; <span class="italic">The Mischievous Boy</span>, by William Ward jun.; <span class="italic">The Village Champion</span>, by Thomas Fairland (lithograph); and <span class="italic">The Culprit Detected</span>, by William Fairland (lithograph). Other paintings by Farrier include: <span class="italic">The Prophecy&#151;you'll Marry a Rich Young Lady</span>. He exhibited thirty-five pictures at the Royal Academy, fifty at the British Institution, and thirty-two at the Society of British Artists. He also showed work at the New Watercolour Society.<br>
<br>On 26 August 1829 at St Luke's, Chelsea, Farrier married Elizabeth Meers (<i>d</i>. 1832), with whom he had two daughters. He married, secondly, on 15 August 1847 at Wandsworth, Frances Elliott (1804/5&#150;1894), the daughter of William Elliott, a music teacher of Wandsworth. In his professional life he occasionally travelled, but he continued to reside in Chelsea at 6 Wellesley Street and later at 7 Smith Street, 12 Old Manor Street (1851), and 2 Hemus Terrace (1861). Farrier died of apoplexy at Holly Villa, Hayes, Middlesex, on 19 April 1879, and was survived by his second wife and one of his daughters. After his death one of his pictures, <span class="italic">The Parting</span>, was presented to the South Kensington Museum. His sister, Charlotte Farrier, who was baptized on 18 August 1802 at St Luke's, Chelsea, was a miniature painter and exhibited frequently and prolifically, from the same addresses as her brother, at the Royal Academy. She died on 1 April 1879.<br>
