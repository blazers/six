</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Burns,  John Elliott</span>  (1858&#150;1943), <span class="occ">labour leader and politician</span>, was born in South Lambeth, London, on 20 October 1858, the sixteenth child of Alexander Burns, a Scottish fitter, and Barbara Smith. He left St Mary's national school when he was about ten and after a series of short-term jobs was apprenticed as an engineer.<br>
<br>Burns spent his childhood in relative poverty. Apparently deserted by his father, his mother took in washing and the family moved to a basement dwelling in Battersea. Despite his brief schooling Burns attended night classes and became an avid consumer of radical literature. A useful boxer, he was a pugnacious and combative individual, and insubordination twice resulted in the cancellation of his indentures by irate employers before he finally completed his apprenticeship at Mowlems, a major London contractor. There he came under the influence of Victor Delahaye, an exiled former communard and member of a French Marxist group, committed to the view that in the absence of effective physical force and organization, the working class could throw off capitalism only through the ballot box. In 1878 Burns had his first encounter with the law when he was arrested for holding a political meeting on Clapham Common in defiance of a police prohibition. More than a year spent working for the Niger Company in west Africa further strengthened his belief in the exploitative nature of imperialism and capitalism. It was there, too, that he read Mill's <span class="italic">Political Economy</span>, the book which, he said, converted him to socialism.<h2>
<a name="Labourleader"></a>Labour leader</h2>On his return to England in 1881 Burns settled in Battersea, London. In July 1882 he married (Martha) Charlotte Gale (1861&#150;1936), daughter of a Battersea shipwright. They had one son, Edgar (<i>b</i>. 1895). Burns threw himself energetically into the radical movement. His impeccably proletarian origins and popular interests (he enjoyed cricket and played football for Wandsworth Clarence Rovers) made him a welcome recruit for the Democratic Federation (later the Social Democratic Federation, or SDF), a Marxist organization with a predominantly middle-class leadership. So, too, did his remarkable gift for public speaking which enabled the federation to use him as &#145;a sort of giant gramophone&#146;  (Burgess, xiv). By 1884 his dynamic and colourful oratory&#151;it was Burns who on a later occasion described the Thames as &#145;liquid history&#146;  (Hughes, 283)&#151;had earned him a place on the party's executive. When the federation split over strategy, he stood firmly with the advocates of parliamentary action, opposing William Morris, who broke away to form the Socialist League. In 1885 Burns unsuccessfully contested Nottingham West in the general election, but his 598 votes dwarfed the total of 59 cast for the two SDF candidates in other constituencies. Furthermore, they were secured without any of the finance offered by the tory party in the hope of dividing the anti-Conservative vote. Throughout his public life Burns had the highest standards of personal integrity and was scathing of all who did not, whatever their social standing.<br>
<br>In the course of 1886 Burns was arrested and charged with sedition and conspiracy following his involvement in an SDF unemployment march that deteriorated into a riot. As &#145;the man with the red flag&#146; he conducted his own defence so ably that he was discharged. Early in the following year he was again arrested when, in company with the radical MP, R. B. Cunninghame Graham, he led the crowd's attack against the police cordon set up to enforce a ban on public meetings in Trafalgar Square. He received a six-week sentence. The language Burns used at this time was often cited later as evidence of his revolutionary aspirations, but he was sometimes tempted into excesses because he so revelled in his ability to inspire adulation in a crowd, and many of his words were subsequently taken out of context. Fundamentally, he never wavered in his conviction that social change was the priority, the method of achieving it a secondary consideration. Even before his imprisonment he had shown signs of disenchantment with the SDF's chronic internecine bickering and its desire to engage in class warfare in the House of Commons, rather than seeking some tangible benefits for ordinary people. In 1889 Burns's popularity and record as a Labour militant enabled him to win one of the two Battersea seats on the newly established London county council.<h2>
<a name="OntheLondoncountycouncil"></a>On the London county council</h2>Barely had the new council begun its work when Burns's attention was diverted to the London dock strike. Although the dock gates had long been a favourite stamping ground he did not initiate the strike, and many other leading labour figures, especially Tom Mann and Ben Tillett, were prominently involved. Even so, the short, powerfully built, and bearded figure of Burns, sporting a straw boater for ease of identification, eclipsed them all. While he negotiated skilfully with intractable employers and organized picket lines tirelessly, Burns's major contribution was his oratory which sustained the strikers with its vision of &#145;the full round orb of the docker's tanner&#146;  (Smith and Nash, 147). The long-drawn-out stoppage and its successful outcome made Burns an internationally known figure. Everywhere his support was coveted to boost the ensuing surge of trade union organization and in 1890 he was elected to the parliamentary committee of the TUC. Burns's moderation in conducting the dock strike earned it considerable sympathy from the wider public and did much to dispel the militant reputation he had acquired in 1886 and 1887&#151;so much so that Battersea Liberals solicited his parliamentary candidature.<br>
<br>Burns's election prospects were considerably enhanced by his performance in the London county council where for two or three years he was a dominant figure. He was an assiduous worker, diligently attending the numerous committees on which he served, visiting many of the council's projects, talking to technical experts, and generally bringing the force of his powerful personality to bear on behalf of municipal enterprise and improvement. In particular, he led the campaign which resulted in council work going only to those contractors who observed trade union rates and conditions. Eventually and with help from other Progressives, notably John Benn, he masterminded the establishment of the council's own works department, demanding of it the same rigorous standards of behaviour and performance he had required of private firms. Later he was instrumental in steering through the House of Commons the legislation that gave London its municipal steamboat service. From the middle 1890s until he finally left the council in 1907, however, Burns's influence diminished somewhat. This was partly because the growing hold of party politics made it difficult for him to preserve the freedom of action which he cherished, partly because in 1892 he was elected as MP for Battersea, winning the seat by 5616 votes to 4057.<h2>
<a name="Inparliament"></a>In parliament</h2>At Westminster Burns generally eschewed larger political issues and concentrated on matters close to his heart, such as working conditions, corruption, public amenities, and the eight-hour day. As had happened in the London county council, these interests inevitably drew him into informal co-operation with the radical wing of the Liberal Party but Burns insisted on his independence. He rejected offers of Liberal financial support in his constituency, relying instead on the salary provided by his own Battersea Labour League. While he emerged as the natural leader of the small group of Labour MPs in the Commons, he was profoundly suspicious of attempts to turn this into anything more structured. This brought him into conflict with Keir Hardie, a leading force behind the establishment of the Independent Labour Party (ILP) in 1893. Beatrice Webb oversimplified this clash in attributing it to Burns's immense egotism. Reared in the secular tradition of metropolitan radicalism, Burns could never come to terms with Hardie's more mystical version of socialism, couched as it was in terms of the <span class="roman">New Testament</span>. He also found irritating Hardie's penchant for parliamentary histrionics and his indifference to procedure. Above all, Burns had reaped handsome dividends in the county council by remaining free of party commitments and co-operating widely for the advancement of specific causes. He did not, therefore, share Hardie's view that within a broad progressive alliance, Labour should have a separately organized political identity. Fearing that the ILP was merely a northern version of the SDF and would divert Labour into narrow sectarianism and a political dead end, Burns supported&#151;though contrary to received opinion he did not initiate&#151;moves to emasculate its influence in the TUC. Although he attended the foundation conference of the Labour Representation Committee (LRC) in 1900 he declined to lend his support to an organization that demanded allegiance to a party programme exclusively geared towards the interests of a specific class. He maintained this position in the face of Hardie's several later attempts to win him over.<br>
<br>Once the major trade unions began to turn to the LRC in the aftermath of the Taff Vale judgment which threatened to expose their funds to legal action, Burns became increasingly isolated within the broader labour movement, even though his own Battersea base remained secure. At the same time his opposition to British involvement in the South African War reinforced his links with the radical wing of the Liberal Party, though he held aloof from the formal anti-war movement, once again preferring to conduct an independent campaign. Burns was also a convinced free-trader and when Joseph Chamberlain launched his tariff reform campaign in 1903 Liberal leaders appreciated the political advantage of having on their platforms a genuine working man who was not afraid to attack Chamberlain as a &#145;fiscal pervert&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 3 Jan 1906). When Campbell-Bannerman formed his administration in 1905 Burns was offered the presidency of the Local Government Board, the first working man to achieve cabinet rank.<h2>
<a name="AttheLocalGovernmentBoard"></a>At the Local Government Board</h2>Burns's acceptance of office has often been portrayed as the first in a long line of betrayals by Labour politicians. Yet Burns had long resisted the notion of an independent working-class party. The flexibility and independence of action that he preferred could be maintained in a Liberal government where the onus for legislative initiatives lay with individual ministers, not a party manifesto. His position was vindicated almost immediately after the general election of 1906 returned the Liberals to power with a huge majority. Faced with a hostile Labour Party reaction to his own <span class="roman">Trades Disputes Bill</span>, Campbell-Bannerman threw over the views of most legal experts, a royal commission, and his own senior cabinet colleagues by announcing that it would be amended to confer on union funds total immunity from legal action. It seems probable that the major influence behind this sudden volte-face was Burns. He had long been Campbell-Bannerman's unofficial adviser on trade union affairs, and had previously introduced the TUC's own bill granting total immunity.<br>
<br>It has been generally concluded that Burns's eight years at the Local Government Board were barren. Behind this judgement lies the view, originally propagated by Beatrice Webb, that Burns's civil servants played on his personal vanity, flattering him into becoming an ineffective and reactionary minister. Burns's vanity is not in doubt: when Campbell-Bannerman offered him the Local Government Board, Burns is alleged to have replied that the prime minister had never done a more popular thing. But Mrs Webb's views were heavily influenced by the fact that Burns was the rock on which her ambitious plans for restructuring the poor law foundered. He had long believed that poverty and its related problems were the combined outcome of individual failure and an inadequate social environment. This was reinforced by a strong streak of puritanism which expressed itself in his opposition to smoking, drinking, and gambling. He was not flattered either into holding an inquiry into the administration of the Poplar poor-law union in 1906. Rather he was disturbed by the possibility that public money might have been dispensed in a corrupt way. In similar fashion, his hostility to the Webbs' plans for the poor law owed less to the conservatism of the Local Government Board than to his own fear of undermining individuality by regimentalizing pauperism.<br>
<br>Other aspects of Burns's character were important in determining his performance at the board, however. His insistence on being personally involved in relatively trivial matters often caused him to lose sight of the president's strategic role. What had just about been possible in London was not practical on a national scale. He lacked many constructive ideas of his own, most obviously in the area of unemployment policy. Intellectual limitations forced him, as the wife of one colleague remarked, to spend most of his official life struggling with &#145;things he did not fully understand and bluffing to hide the fact&#146;  (Masterman, 205). In this regard he was not helped by the operational deficiencies of a department enmeshed in red tape. More particularly, the absence of a statistical section hampered the development of a programme to deal with unemployment, while the poor law section was wedded to the principles of 1834. As the Cinderella of Whitehall, the Local Government Board did not attract high quality civil servants. Burns's parliamentary draftsman was particularly incompetent and must bear much of the blame for the failure of at least two important legislative measures concerning rating and the municipal milk supply to reach the statute book. Burns's diaries (now in the British Library) indicate his frustration with this situation, though ultimately he seems to have given up his struggle to introduce a more dynamic ethos. He came to tolerate the problems because neither his pride nor his conviction that he was somehow called to represent the people would allow him to admit defeat and give up his office.<br>
<br>The one significant piece of legislation Burns did oversee, the <span class="roman">Housing and Town Planning Act</span> of 1909, was a major achievement, introducing for the first time the principle of municipally owned housing and conferring wide planning powers on local authorities. In general, however, Burns found the legislative process tedious and he preferred to implement change through administrative means. Even the Webbs conceded that he did much to humanize the operation of the poor law. Equally significant in his attempts to improve the general social environment were the compulsory notification of pauper tuberculosis and his crusade against infant mortality. This administrative record has been largely overlooked, although it helps to explain why Burns was retained in the cabinet when H. H. Asquith replaced Campbell-Bannerman as prime minister in 1908. It also lay behind his transfer to the Board of Trade on 12 February 1914. After the stream of radical legislation produced by its previous heads, Churchill and Lloyd George, its paramount requirement was for an administratively competent president.<br>
<br>On broader political issues Burns was never as significant a figure within the cabinet as his diary entries suggest. He was consistently opposed to high military expenditure, took a dim view of colleagues like Lloyd George who appeared to flout his own high standards of public behaviour, and was unswervingly loyal to Asquith. However, that support did not survive the outbreak of war in 1914. Despite his stand against the South African War, Burns was not a principled pacifist and as a confirmed home-ruler had advocated strong action against the Ulster Unionists. But he was essentially a little Englander and when it became clear on 2 August 1914 that Britain was committed to support France in the event of a conflict with Germany, he resigned from the government, rejecting Asquith's last minute plea to remain.<h2>
<a name="Retirementandoldage"></a>Retirement and old age</h2>This was the effective end of Burns's political career although he did not leave the House of Commons until 1918. There was no obvious political home for him in post-war Britain. He had forfeited the support of the Asquithian Liberals through his anti-war stance and he would not consider supporting Lloyd George, for whom he had a deep antipathy. But neither could Burns, despite a few fanciful entries in his diary, contemplate a return as a Labour candidate, for his stewardship of the Local Government Board, particularly his handling of unemployment and the Poplar poor-law inquiry, had closed that particular door. Any lingering inclination to return was finally extinguished by the sudden death in 1922 of Edgar, the son on whom he doted. Thereafter, supported by a Carnegie pension worth about &pound;1000 a year, Burns retreated from public life, browsing in bookshops, emerging occasionally to receive academic or civic honours and&#151;more frequently&#151;to watch cricket or to attend to his one remaining public duty as a trustee of the Strathcona leper colony.<br>
<br>By the end of 1941 Burns was practically bedridden, as a result of a combination of old age which had finally conquered his robust health, and of a nearby bomb blast which had thrown him heavily to the ground. He died of heart failure and senile arteriosclerosis at the Bolingbroke Hospital in Wandsworth on 24 January 1943, and was buried in St Mary's church cemetery, Battersea. He left an estate valued at &pound;15,137 3<i>s</i>. 7<i>d</i>.<br>
