<span class="headword">Hussey,  Eric Robert James</span>  (1885&#150;1958), <span class="occ">educationist</span>, was born at White Cliff, Mill Street, Blandford, in Dorset, on 26 April 1885, the eldest son of the Revd James Hussey (1846&#150;1920) and his wife, Martha Ellen Hewett. He won scholarships to Repton School (1899&#150;1904) and then to Hertford College, Oxford, from where he graduated BA in <i>literae humaniores</i> with third-class honours in 1908 (MA 1923). At both Repton and Oxford he was an outstanding athlete, specializing in the 110 yards hurdles, and competed for the United Kingdom in the Olympic games held in London in the summer of 1908. In the same year he joined the Sudan educational service as a tutor at Gordon College, Khartoum. After four years he was seconded to the administration for a period as a district officer and later as district commissioner at Sennar. By then he had acquired a spoken knowledge of Arabic. During the First World War he was retained at his post. Thereafter he became senior inspector in the education department in Khartoum. In November 1920 he went on a special mission to Somaliland to advise on education, and made similar visits to Uganda and Kenya in 1924. On 19 July 1922 Hussey married Christine Elizabeth Justice Morley (1892&#150;1977). They had a son, Marmaduke, and a daughter. Marmaduke Hussey subsequently became a prominent figure in the newspaper industry and later chairman of the BBC (1986&#150;96); in 1996 he was created a life peer as Lord Hussey of North Bradley.<br>
<br>In 1925 Hussey became Uganda's first director of education. He successfully established a department of education and drafted the first education ordinance in a colony in which rival Anglican and Roman Catholic churches exercised a monopoly over schooling. He subsequently won the support of both churches and also formed a lasting friendship with J. H. Oldham, the highly influential secretary of the International Missionary Council. Hussey was a firm advocate of the &#145;adaptation&#146; theory of African education as espoused in the 1925 memorandum <span class="italic">Education Policy in British Tropical Africa</span> and sought to avoid at all costs a policy of reckless Westernization accomplished through the medium of education. He also worked hard to consolidate the recently established Makerere College.<br>
<br>In 1929 Hussey was transferred to west Africa as the first overall director of education in Nigeria. The task awaiting him was no less challenging. A new education ordinance and a new grants-in-aid scheme had to be drafted and major changes made to the structure of schooling while simultaneously reassuring long established and powerfully entrenched missions that their educational interests would be respected. Unfortunately, much of his work, including the establishment of Yaba College, which he hoped would ultimately achieve the status of a university college, and his equally enthusiastic efforts to expand the education of girls, was adversely affected by the prolonged economic recession of the early 1930s which resulted in severe financial and staff retrenchments. In 1932 Hussey was a member of the commission which inspected the Prince of Wales College at Achimota in the Gold Coast Colony. A year later he was made a CMG for his services to colonial education. His term of office in Nigeria ended in February 1936 and with it his career in the colonial education service.<br>
<br>Thereafter Hussey found employment first as assistant secretary (March 1936) and subsequently as secretary (December 1936) of the National Society, which was responsible for the administration of numerous Anglican schools throughout England and Wales. He served with distinction as the Anglican church's &#145;Minister for Education&#146; until June 1942 when he was asked by the British government to go to Ethiopia for two years to act as the emperor's educational adviser. The 1943 annual report of the National Society claimed that he achieved &#145;an administrative triumph&#146; in reshaping the affairs of the society to meet new demands under the 1934 charter, and that he steered it safely through the difficult period of transition with unostentatious ability and faithfulness. Between 1940 and April 1942 he also served with distinction on the Colonial Office's advisory committee on education in the colonies.<br>
<br>In 1944 Hussey returned to London to a position with the British Council as director of the Middle East section which he retained until his retirement in 1949. Between 1945 and 1947 he also served a second term on the Colonial Office's advisory committee on education. In 1940 he began a long association with the London School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS) as the Nigerian representative on the governing board, a position he retained until his death. His last overseas mission was to Eritrea in 1953 to advise on education in the territory's first year of independence. In the immediate post-war years Hussey was active in the Royal African Society as both a council member and vice-president, and represented the society at the Solway Conference on Education in Africa held in Brussels in 1950. In July 1948 he became a fellow of the Woodard Corporation and in 1951 chairman of the governing board of Hurstpierpoint School. Between 1950 and 1956 he also served on the Africa committee of the Conference of British Missionary Societies.<br>
<br>In 1935 Hussey delivered one of the three Joseph Paine lectures at the London Institute of Education (&#145;Some aspects of education in Nigeria&#146;), and in 1939 the sixth of the Heath Clark lectures at SOAS, entitled &#145;The role of education in assisting the people of west Africa to adjust themselves to the changing conditions due to European contacts&#146;. He was also a frequent contributor to <span class="italic">African Affairs</span> and <span class="italic">African World</span>, especially in the post-war years, and recorded several radio talks for the BBC in 1954 on Ethiopian affairs. In 1959 Christine Hussey arranged for publication and private circulation of his memoirs of service in Africa.<br>
<br>As a young man Hussey acquired a reputation for outstanding athletic prowess and his quiet demeanour and genial disposition won him friends wherever he went. They were qualities that endured throughout his life. Sir Christopher Cox visited him in Ethiopia in early 1944 when he was in his sixtieth year and commented that he quite thrived on a 16 mile walk over the mountains  (Hussey, 129); Michael E. Okorodudu, a Nigerian chief, claimed that Hussey was the first director of education who wore shorts and an open-neck shirt and sat to eat Nigerian meals with Nigerian boys and girls in Nigerian schools  (Hussey, 155). Finally, it was James A. Gray, the editor of <span class="italic">African World</span>, who referred to him as &#145;an educationist of distinction&#146; but who was quick to add that it was the man himself who made the fullest impact, the big, unruffled man with the quick smile, eager approach, and quiet chuckle who was courteous and friendly to everyone. He was, Gray suggested, a living example of the truth of how much a man can accomplish if he does not care who gets the credit  (<span class="italic">African World</span>, 10 July 1958). Hussey died of heart disease at his home, Painswold, Broad Street, Cuckfield, Sussex, on 19 May 1958, aged seventy-three years. He was cremated, and his ashes scattered in the churchyard of Cuckfield parish church.<br>
