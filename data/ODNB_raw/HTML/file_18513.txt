<span class="headword">Meggott <span class="st"> [Meggot]</span>,  Richard</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1692), <span class="occ">dean of Winchester</span>, was born in St Olave, Southwark, the son of a brewer; nothing more of his parentage is as yet known. He was a scholar at St Paul's School, London, where he was a contemporary of Samuel Pepys, who on Christmas day 1664 heard &#145;a good sermon of one that I remember was at Pauls with me, his name Maggett&#146;  (Pepys, <span class="italic">Diary</span>, 5.356). Meggott was admitted pensioner to Queens' College, Cambridge, on 4 March 1650, graduating BA in 1653 and proceeding MA in 1657 and DD in 1669. He was appointed by Oliver Cromwell to the Sussex livings of Ford (9 June 1654) and West Tarring (15 November 1655). He held the latter living until 1657, and in June 1656 was also installed as vicar of Fermy in the same county. In 1656 he published <span class="italic">The Rib Restored, or, The Honour of Marriage</span>, a wedding sermon he had delivered the year before at St Dionis Backchurch, London.<br>
<br>Meggott conformed at the Restoration and was collated to the rectory of Ford on 6 August 1661. From 1662 he was rector of St Olave, Southwark, but it seems that the effort of ministering to a large urban parish badly affected his health. To lessen the strain on his constitution Meggott was appointed to the vicarage of Twickenham, Middlesex, on 17 November 1668, a living he held until 1687. He was appointed a canon of Windsor on 18 July 1677 and on 9 October 1679 was installed dean of Winchester. In spite of his supposed ill health Meggott still seems to have passed much of his time in London. In 1672 he was appointed chaplain-in-ordinary to Charles II and preached several times before the court during the 1670s and 1680s. When James II visited Winchester in September 1685, John Evelyn records, he stayed at Dean Meggott's lodgings.<br>
<br>Although, as the editor of a posthumous collection of his sermons admitted, Meggott had on occasion preached in favour of &#145;the Lineal Succession&#146; with much &#145;warmth&#146;  (Meggott, <span class="italic">Ten Sermons</span>, &#145;To the reader&#146;), Meggott conformed at the revolution of 1688. His earlier support for James did not prevent Meggott from remaining a popular court preacher and he delivered many sermons before William and Mary. He remained in these court sermons a staunch defender of the Anglican church. One sermon in particular, delivered on 14 July 1689 before the king and queen at Hampton Court, provoked controversy. Here Meggott urged that, in spite of the <span class="roman">Toleration Act</span>, dissenters who remained outside the communion of the Church of England were schismatics. This received a reply in <span class="italic">The Charity and Loyalty of some of our Clergy</span> (1689), in which the author both refuted the charge of schism and attacked the conformist Anglican clergy (among whom, by implication, he included Meggott) for offering William only <i>de facto</i> allegiance.<br>
<br>Meggott died at Twickenham on 7 December 1692. His Williamite political inclinations are underlined by the fact that it was William Sherlock, dean of St Paul's and advocate of King William's providential divine right, who delivered his funeral sermon at Twickenham three days later. Sherlock praised Meggott's learning and abilities as a preacher, accurately describing him as a &#145;hearty and zealous assertor of the doctrine, worship, government and discipline of the Church of England&#146;  (Sherlock, 21). Though no details of his wife are as yet known, he had at least one son, born in 1673 or 1674.<br>
<br>Sir Godfrey Kneller twice painted Meggott's portrait, engraved copies of which were made by Thomas White and David Loggan.<br>
