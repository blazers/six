<span class="headword">Kennedy,  James</span>  (1784/5&#150;1851), <span class="occ">medical bibliographer</span>, was the son of Captain John Kennedy. He was born in Scotland and spent his childhood at Tillyrie, near Kinross. He became librarian to the Glasgow Public Library (a subscription library) and was presumably responsible for the catalogue printed in 1810, which displays his lifelong tendency to over-elaboration. He celebrated his native region in <span class="italic">Glenochel, a Descriptive Poem</span> (2 vols., 1810), including lengthy scholarly notes, and was editor of a short-lived magazine, <span class="italic">The Druid</span> (1812). He began to attend medical classes at Glasgow University in 1810 and graduated MD in 1813 with a thesis, <span class="italic">De lingua humana</span>. He practised as a physician at Dunning, Perthshire, until 1821, then at Glasgow, becoming an ardent phrenologist and friend of George Combe (letters in National Library of Scotland MSS 7215&#150;7269, 7383&#150;7388). His practice at Dunning furnished material for a series of articles in the <span class="italic">London Medical Repository</span> between 1820 and 1826, and in 1825 he published <span class="italic">Instructions &hellip; on the Management of Children</span>; his &#145;Instructions &hellip; on the management of the female constitution&#146; was described as &#145;ready for the press&#146; but was never published.<br>
<br>In 1826 Kennedy moved to Tamworth, and in 1827 or 1828 he was invited to Ashby-de-la-Zouch by Edward Mammatt, agent to the marquess of Hastings, who was promoting the town as a spa. Kennedy contributed &#145;Remarks on the water&#146; to T. Wayte's <span class="italic">Descriptive &hellip; Guide</span> (1831) and in the same year published anonymously <span class="italic">An Exposure of the Unphilosophical and Unchristian Expedients Adopted by Antiphrenologists</span>, an overblown response to <span class="italic">Anti-Phrenology</span> (1829), by Dr John Wayte of King's Lynn. He continued to contribute to professional journals and to the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span>, but his only other publication in book form was <span class="italic">A Lecture on &hellip; Cholera</span> (1832). His first wife was Miss Thompson, sister of Lord Hastings's secretary; subsequently he married Charlotte Hawkes of Norton Canes, Staffordshire, on 20 November 1838. There were no children.<br>
<br>In 1842 Kennedy retired to Woodhouse, near Loughborough, retaining some charitable practice and serving as physician to the Loughborough Dispensary, but concentrating on his <span class="italic">Athenae medicae Britannicae</span>, a long-standing project for an author-bibliography of British medicine to 1800 (including foreign authors published in Britain). The work was accepted for publication by the Sydenham Society and in 1851 Kennedy moved up to London to supervise printing and to work at the British Museum, but he was taken ill in April after delivery of the first thirty-two pages of proofs. He died aged sixty-six on 9 May 1851, at 24 Great Russell Street, from inflammation of the bowels, and was buried at Woodhouse on 15 May. The manuscript of his bibliography, of which only the letter A was in a finished state, was presented to the British Museum by his widow on 5 August 1859 (now British Library Add. MSS 23168&#150;23194). His library was sold at Sothebys on 11&#150;13 December 1851, and realized &pound;330. 4<i>s</i>. 0<i>d</i>.<br>
