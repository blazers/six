<span class="headword">Thynne,  Thomas</span>, first Viscount Weymouth  (<em>bap. </em>1640, <em>d.</em> 1714), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was baptized on 8 September 1640, the first son of Sir Henry Frederick Thynne, first baronet (1615&#150;1680), landowner of Kempsford, Gloucestershire, and his wife, Mary (<i>bap</i>. 1619), daughter of Thomas Coventry, first Baron Coventry of Aylesborough. Thynne was educated at Kingston grammar school. From a staunchly Anglican and royalist family, in the 1650s he was taught by ejected Anglican clergymen such as Thomas Triplett, corresponded regularly with Henry Hammond, and was &#145;one of the prize pupils&#146; tutored privately by ejected Anglican dons at Oxford  (Seaward, 65). He did, however, eventually go to Christ Church, Oxford, matriculating on 21 April 1657, but was not awarded a degree. While at Oxford he befriended his Christ Church tutor Thomas Ken, later bishop of Bath and Wells, and acquired the extensive manuscript collection of William Burton, his former teacher. Thynne's lifelong interest in manuscripts and coins earned him recognition from the Royal Society, which elected him a fellow in 1664.<br>
<br>In 1664 Thynne was supported by the duke of York in a by-election at Salisbury, but he had little prospect of success against the other candidate, Edward Hyde, who had been put up by his father Lord Chancellor Clarendon, the city's high steward, and Thynne probably withdrew before the poll. In 1666 he was appointed a groom of the duke's bedchamber, a post he held until 1672, and was sent as an envoy to Sweden from 1666 to 1669. In or before 1673 he married Lady Frances (<i>bap</i>. 1650, <i>d</i>. 1712), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9434/', "Heneage Finch, third earl of Winchilsea")</script>. They had three sons, who all predeceased their father, and one daughter. Thynne's new connections enabled him to enter parliament in 1674, when he was returned for Oxford University after a by-election caused by the promotion of the incumbent MP, Heneage Finch, later first earl of Nottingham, to the lord keepership. Thynne's success may be attributed as much to his connection with Finch as to the large sums expended upon entertaining the electorate, for the constituency normally returned only former members of the university. Thynne had no degree, his contribution to the work of the house during this parliament was slight, and he notably made no attempt to have the clergy exempted from the hearth tax, an issue of some concern to the colleges, and consequently there was little scope for his re-election for the university in 1679. His recent marriage had, however, brought him a substantial estate at Drayton Bassett, Staffordshire, and a strong interest in nearby Tamworth, which borough elected him to both parliaments of 1679. He shortly afterwards became high steward of the town, a post he held until his death. In parliament Thynne supported the <span class="roman">Comprehension Bill</span> and a measure to remove Roman Catholics from the capital, but acted against attempts to exclude the duke of York from the succession, telling against committing the first <span class="roman">Exclusion Bill</span> on 21 May 1679. His personal ambition was checked by his failure to secure nomination from the Levant Company as ambassador to Turkey. On 6 March 1680 Thynne succeeded his father as second baronet, and two years later, following the sensational assassination of his cousin, Thomas Thynne, he came into the extensive Somerset and Wiltshire estates centred upon Longleat. His 32-year tenure at Longleat was spent redesigning much of the house's interior, rebuilding a number of rooms, and completing the chapel, while the gardens were laid out with fashionable contemporary formality. On 11 December 1682 Thynne's steadfast opposition to exclusion was rewarded with a peerage, when he was created Baron Thynne and Viscount Weymouth. He deferred taking his seat in the Lords, however, until 1685. Although he was not sounded on the repeal of the <span class="roman">Test Act</span> and penal laws against dissenters, he was known as an opponent of James II's religious measures. In December 1688 he was named as one of four emissaries sent to ask William of Orange to summon a free parliament. In the Lords he voted for a regency, and though he took the oaths to the new monarchs he supported the nonjurors, and offered his old friend Bishop Ken private apartments at Longleat as well as the family chaplaincy. Weymouth's membership of the new missionary Society for the Propagation of the Gospel from 1701 may be a testament to his religious devotion.<br>
<br>Weymouth was a vocal opponent of the government, and legislative measures which he sought to undermine included the <span class="roman">Triennial Act</span> and the 1697 bill for regulating elections. He refused to sign the 1696 association for the defence of William III after the discovery of an assassination plot. Certainly a high tory, he was soon suspected of also being a Jacobite, but is not known to have intrigued actively with the exiled James II. In June 1702, soon after the accession of Queen Anne, Weymouth was appointed a privy councillor, keeper of the Forest of Dean, and the first lord commissioner of trade and plantations. In 1711 he was reappointed <i>custos rotulorum</i> of Wiltshire, a post which he had held almost continuously since 1683 before being displaced by the whigs in 1706.<br>
<br>Weymouth's wife died on 17 April 1712 and was buried on 3 May at Longbridge Deverill, Wiltshire. Two years later, on or shortly before 28 July 1714, Weymouth himself died, probably at Longleat; he too was buried in the family vault at Longbridge Deverill. In his will, made in November 1709, he confirmed an annuity to Bishop Ken and bequeathed &pound;40,000 to four granddaughters and &pound;1000 to build a church in East Woodlands, Frome. Paintings by Van Dyck and Antonio di Cortena were bequeathed to the earls of Rochester and Nottingham. Thynne's titles and the bulk of the estate were devolved on his great-nephew Thomas Thynne, second Viscount Weymouth and father of the first marquess of Bath, on the condition that he confirmed his Anglicanism.<br>
