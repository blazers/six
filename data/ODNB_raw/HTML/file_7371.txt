<span class="headword">Day,  Richard</span>  (<em>b. </em>1552, <em>d.</em> in or before 1606), <span class="occ">printer and Church of England clergyman</span>, was born at Aldersgate, London, on 21 December 1552, the son of the printer <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7367/', "John Day (1521/2&#150;1584)")</script>. Intended by his father for the church, he was educated at Eton College and was admitted as a scholar to King's College, Cambridge, on 24 August 1571. He matriculated in November 1572 and was admitted as fellow on 24 August 1574, proceeding to BA in 1575. He continued his studies, only to give up his fellowship shortly after Michaelmas 1576 without matriculating MA. He later claimed that he had left because of persistent complaints by his stepmother and John Day's second wife, Alice Lehunte, about how much his education was costing and because his father wished him to join the family printing business. In fact, however, it appears that Richard left Cambridge because he had fallen in love with a girl called Ellen Bowles, who lived near Aldersgate. (This was not the woman he married some years later, whose maiden name was Pope.)<br>
<br>In 1576 Day assisted his father in the printing of, and wrote some of the prefixed verses to, the third edition of Foxe's <span class="italic">Actes and Monuments</span>. The following year, on 28 August 1577, he was named as co-patentee when his father secured the renewal of a lucrative patent for the printing of a number of works including the <span class="roman">Psalms</span> in metre and the <span class="italic">ABC with Little Catechism</span>, although it appears that Richard may have gained his half-share by misleading his father about the terms of the grant. None the less, he was admitted as a freeman of the Stationers' Company at some point before 30 June 1578 when he was elected to the company's livery. In that same year he and his father were part of a patent dispute with William Seres and Henry Denham successfully resolved by the Stationers' Company.<br>
<br>Day entered his first book in the company's registers on 28 May 1578, his own translation of John Foxe's <span class="italic">Christ Jesus Triumphant</span>. The work was followed by a newly prefaced edition of <span class="italic">A Booke of Christian Prayers, Collected out of the Auncient Writers</span>, otherwise known as <span class="italic">Queen Elizabeth's Prayer Book</span>. He also variously edited, translated, registered, and printed a handful of books over the next two years. However, his father evidently did not allow him to produce any works covered by the 1577 patent, as Richard took to pirating the little catechism and the metrical <span class="roman">Psalms</span>. As a result, in 1580 his father, then master of the Stationers' Company, assisted by the company's wardens, entered Richard's premises and took from him the bulk of his books, type, and press. No books were issued by Richard Day after this event.<br>
<br>Day was ordained on 1 December 1580, serving as vicar in Mundon, Essex, until about 1583, and occupying Foxe's living at Reigate, Surrey, for a brief period from 24 May 1583 until he resigned at some point during 1584. About this period John Day made a deed of gift to his wife and her family, intended to deprive Richard of his inheritance (worth several thousand pounds) and to force Richard to pay all of his own mounting debts himself. It may well be that, left little option by his father's actions, Richard saw no opening for him other than the church. It is also possible that this was a final attempt to win back his father's approval (and his inheritance), a hope that ended with his father's death on 23 July 1584. The following year Day successfully challenged in chancery the validity of his father's deed of gift. Alice and her brother John Le Hunte counter-sued, and it is this second suit in particular that provides much of the evidence for Richard Day's activities from 1576 onwards.<br>
<br>Despite an attempt by his father in his final years to revoke Richard Day's rights to the 1577 patent, the patent continued in Richard's name until at least 1604 although all printing for it was done by five nominated assigns. In Michaelmas 1585 he and his assigns exhibited a bill of complaint in Star Chamber accusing a number of individuals of infringing the patent. Nothing further is known of his activities after this date, although on 26 February 1591 Verney Alley was granted the reversion to the Day patent on the event of Richard's death. Richard died some time before 13 April 1606, upon which date the court of the Stationers' Company granted 7<i>s</i>. to &#145;Richard dayes wydowe for her relief&#146;  (Jackson, 24). His widow seems to have continued to receive a pension from the company until 1615. The Day patent was eventually passed to the Stationers' Company by Alley's executors in 1614.<br>
