<span class="headword">Prance,  Miles</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1678&#150;1688), <span class="occ">perjurer</span>, was born in Eastwood in the Isle of Ely. His father was Simon Prance, gentleman, a Roman Catholic convert of royalist sympathies. In his youth Miles Prance was apprenticed to a gold- and silversmith and in the early 1670s he was a servant-in-ordinary to Queen Catherine of Braganza. By the late 1670s he was living in Prince's Street, Covent Garden, with a wife and family.<br>
<br>As a Catholic himself, and having referred to Jesuits as &#145;honest fellows&#146;  (Boys, 10), news of the death of the magistrate Sir Edmund Berry Godfrey in October 1678 made Prance an object of suspicion. Many people believed that the murder was part of a plot by the papists. Prance was arrested on 21 December 1678 after inquiries at his home, where his lodger, John Wren (who owed Prance money), maliciously revealed that his landlord had been absent at the time of the murder. Prance's problems were further compounded when the opportunistic fabricator of Romanist conspiracies William Bedloe accused him of being one of the men he had seen about the body of Godfrey as it lay in Somerset House. After a short examination, in which Prance denied being a party to any murder, he was committed to Newgate and there harshly treated. He subsequently confessed his involvement in the crime, only to recant this confession. While still in Newgate he claimed that the clergymen William Boys, Gilbert Burnet, and William Lloyd had visited him, and on 12 January 1679 Prance once more confessed, later claiming that &#145;It was purely the fear of Death, and the misery of my condition, that wrought upon me to foreswear myself, without any thought of reward&#146;  (L'Estrange, 3.128).<br>
<br>In his new confession Prance maintained that the design against Godfrey came to his notice through two Irish priests: Girald, or Fitz-girald, and Kelly. Also brought into the business were Henry Berry, porter to the queen at Somerset House, Robert Green, an Irishman employed in the Queen's Chapel, and Lawrence Hill. Prance said that the group had followed Godfrey as he went about his business in the week of his death. Finally, while Prance kept watch, Godfrey had been strangled on the evening of Saturday 12 October in a yard at Somerset House. The body was then hidden in the palace until it could be placed in a manner so that whenever it should be found it might be supposed that Godfrey had committed suicide and so discredit him and any evidence against Catholics. Prance claimed that this had been done on the following Wednesday, when they had laid the corpse in a ditch near Primrose Hill and put Godfrey's own sword through his body.<br>
<br>Prance now became responsible for the arrest and deaths of Berry, Green, and Hill. He gave evidence against them at their trial on 5 February 1679 and also shared with Bedloe the reward given for the discovery of the murderers. Thereafter Prance informed on a number of Catholics under the influence of Bedloe and Titus Oates, the principal instigator of the Popish Plot. On 13 June 1679 he gave evidence against two Jesuits, Harcourt and Fenwick, in support of Bedloe and Stephen Dugdale, the Popish Plot witness, and on 10 January 1680 he obtained a pension of &pound;50 from the crown. In September 1679 he helped Sir William Waller to election victory at Westminster and later assisted Oates in trying to discredit Sir Roger L'Estrange. Prance published a number of pamphlets defending his evidence against the accusations of Elizabeth Cellier and purporting to explain its contradictions, but with the ebbing of the Popish Plot he faded from view.<br>
<br>Retribution followed in the next reign. On 15 June 1686 Prance was found guilty of perjury and sentenced to be fined &pound;100, pilloried, and whipped. He stood in the pillory at Westminster on 21 June 1686, but the last part of his sentence was not carried out because the &#145;Queen dowager hath beg'd of the king the remission of the last punishment &hellip; [as she was persuaded that Prance had] &hellip; return'd to the church of Rome&#146;  (Clark, 3.189), having previously converted to the Church of England. In December 1688 Prance tried to escape abroad, but was arrested in the company of some other Catholics in a ship off Gravesend. Interrogated by the House of Lords, he was subsequently released and seems to have fled to the continent, where he died in obscurity.<br>
<br>As Prance &#145;had not the brand upon him of an infamous Course of Life, to blast his Evidence as his Fellow-witnesses had&#146;, he was more readily believed by the authorities  (L'Estrange, 3.126). While his story of the Godfrey murder was startling in its detail and provided an easy solution to the mystery, it also caused the deaths of the innocent Berry, Green, and Hill. It is highly unlikely that his claims were genuine. Prance's evidence had been gained under extreme pressure. While he knew something of the particulars of Godfrey's death, he appears to have gained much circumstantial evidence by being a member of the club at the White House, close to Primrose Hill, where the body of the magistrate was discovered and where the inquest had been held. Moreover his version of Godfrey's death, particularly the timing of the disposal of the body, contains a number of improbabilities. Despite his perjury Prance's apparently unconditional return to the Catholic church has led some historians to claim he was a Catholic agent throughout the events in which he was entangled. It is far more likely that Prance was merely yet another unfortunate caught up in circumstances not of his own making and used by those more powerful than himself. In this respect his return to the Catholic church, sanctioned by Queen Catherine herself, was an act of forgiveness rather than anything sinister.<br>
