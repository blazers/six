<span class="headword">O'Kelly,  Joseph</span>  (1832&#150;1883), <span class="occ">geologist</span>, was born in Dublin on 31 October 1832, the second son of Matthias Joseph O'Kelly, and his wife, Margaret Shannon. His father was noted for a love of natural history, especially of conchology, and for his activity in the cause of Catholic emancipation. Joseph O'Kelly entered Trinity College, Dublin, in 1848, took his BA in 1852, his diploma in engineering in 1853, and his MA in 1860.<br>
<br>In 1852 O'Kelly joined the Geological Society of Dublin (after 1864 the Royal Geological Society of Ireland) and he served frequently on its council. He briefly was employed in the valuation office under Richard John Griffith, but on 13 November 1854 he became an assistant geologist with the geological survey of Ireland under Joseph Beete Jukes. He was promoted to senior geologist on 1 April 1863. O'Kelly mapped chiefly in west Cork, in co. Kerry, in the Limerick volcanic beds, and in the southern Irish midlands. His name is on twenty-three sheets of the one-inch geological map of Ireland and he contributed extensively to the accompanying memoirs. While mapping the Slieveardagh coalfield during the winter of 1858&#150;9 atrocious weather and foul accommodation left him with bronchial problems which eventually terminated his field career. In 1863 he was granted six months' sick leave so that he might pass the winter in Malaga.<br>
<br>In October 1866 O'Kelly permanently quitted the field to become secretary in the survey's Dublin office. There his services were of great value, not only because of his extensive knowledge of Irish geology, but also because his honesty and genial disposition helped to cool tempers within a survey where strong personal animosities existed.<br>
<br>O'Kelly married, in 1870, Miss Dorothea Smyth; they had a family of five sons and four daughters. He died of acute bronchitis on 13 April 1883 at his home, 72 Eccles Street, Dublin. His contributions to the literature of geology, practically restricted to the memoirs published by the survey, indicate his powers and his thoroughness as a geological observer. He was elected a member of the Royal Irish Academy on 8 January 1866.<br>
