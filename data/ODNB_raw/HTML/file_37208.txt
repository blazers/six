<span class="headword">Bosanquet <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Dendy]</span>,  Helen</span>  (1860&#150;1925), <span class="occ">social theorist and social reformer</span>, was born in Manchester on 10 February 1860. She was the youngest daughter and the fifth child in the family of five sons and four daughters of the Revd John Dendy, who had been a nonconformist minister, and then became a businessman in Manchester, and his wife, Sarah Beard, daughter of a Unitarian minister. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/51775/', "Mary Dendy")</script> was an elder sister. Having been educated at home by a German governess, she spent the early part of her adult life keeping house for her brothers. In 1886, at the age of twenty-six, she went to Newnham College, Cambridge, where she and another were the first women to gain first-class honours in the Cambridge moral sciences tripos in 1889. She specialized in political economy. She appears to have had academic ambitions, but no permanent openings were offered in either Cambridge or Oxford. She then moved to London and joined the Charity Organisation Society (COS), a body committed to rationalizing London's vast mass of private charities and to defending orthodox economics. She became organizer and district secretary of the society's Shoreditch branch. She was also active in the London Ethical Society, where she met the philosopher <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/31974/', "Bernard Bosanquet (1848&#150;1923)")</script>, whom she married on 13 December 1895. Thereafter she took no paid employment for the rest of her life, but pursued an active public career as a theorist and publicist for the COS, as a translator of German philosophy and sociology, and as a collaborator with her husband.<br>
<br>In 1902 Helen Bosanquet had a much publicized exchange of views with Benjamin Seebohm Rowntree in which she questioned both the extent and the causes of primary poverty as set out in Rowntree's survey of York in 1899. At the end of 1905 she was appointed a member of the royal commission on the poor laws, where she defended the role of organized private charity in public welfare, against the bureaucratic socialism of Beatrice Webb. Her health broke down in 1908, but she is nevertheless believed to have drafted many sections of the royal commission's majority report. In 1909 she became editor of the <span class="italic">Charity Organisation Review</span>, the official mouthpiece of the COS, and in 1914 she published a history of the previous half-century of charitable work in London, <span class="italic">Social Work in London, 1869&#150;1912</span>. She and her husband lived most of their married life at Oxshott in Surrey, in a rural-cum-suburban community very similar to that described in the writings of their neighbour and contemporary George Sturt (George Bourne). They had no children.<br>
<br>Mrs Bosanquet's reputation was in eclipse for most of the twentieth century, partly because of the disparaging account of her in Beatrice Webb's diaries (&#145;the little woman&#146;), and partly because of her association with a subsequently discredited school of &#145;social economics&#146;. She was, however, a major figure in the development of British social work; and her theoretical and sociological writings became of more interest in the late twentieth century than they had appeared to be during and shortly after her lifetime (when idealist and <i>verstehen</i> modes of thought were being demolished by positivism). She was influential in defining the syllabus of the COS's school of sociology, founded in 1903, which was absorbed into the social science department of the London School of Economics in 1912. It was she who insisted that charitable visiting should be grounded in formal training for objective casework; and it was also she who suggested that social workers needed civic education in history, social structure, and economics, as well as professional skills. That two-tier emphasis on both general and professional learning remained a characteristic of British training for social work.<br>
<br>Helen Bosanquet's major writings were: <span class="italic">Rich and Poor</span> (1896), <span class="italic">The Standard of Life and other Studies</span> (1898), <span class="italic">The Strength of the People</span> (1902), and <span class="italic">The Family</span> (1906). These books are rather discursive in style, and contain little of the exhaustive empirical detail characteristic of much Edwardian sociological writing. Nevertheless, they all exhibit a coherent underlying social theory. They attempt to fuse an organic, interdependent theory of society with a view of social behaviour that emphasized diversity and idiosyncrasy. The key to social progress lay in the rational will of individuals, and true philanthropy consisted in supporting and strengthening that rational will rather than in the mere mechanical relief of poverty. The way to social understanding lay not in counting heads or in measuring incomes (though accurate collection of such data was a useful secondary tool); it lay rather in cultural interpretation and participant observation. <span class="italic">The Family</span> challenged the view of many late nineteenth-century sociologists that the family as a social unit would inevitably decline under the pressures of industrial capitalism; and it challenged also the claim of Edwardian anthropologists (echoed by many feminists) that the roots of the family lay in matriarchy. Mrs Bosanquet was herself a feminist and suffragist, though she dissented from most Edwardian feminists in believing that the true expression of women's rights lay not in the public and professional sphere, but in raising the status and functional efficiency of family life. Her views were spelt out in her criticism of the royal commission on divorce (1912), which had recommended the liberalization of the divorce laws. She is often portrayed by historians as upholding an archaic, gentrified, pre-industrial theory of society, and some of her opinions lend support to this view. But in many respects her writing suggests the exact opposite: that she was a proponent of modernity, rationality, and functional efficiency, often at the expense of traditional values and structures. &#145;The one fundamental cure for poverty is to make the poorer wage-earners more efficient in the widest sense of the term&#151;more efficient as producers, as consumers, and in all the relations of life&#146;.<br>
<br>As a person Mrs Bosanquet appears to have been quiet, ironic, and donnish. Her Newnham nicknames&#151;Tone-Raiser and Aunt Dendy&#151;suggest a certain old-fashioned high-mindedness of manner. Her method of cross-examination on the poor law commission was very low-key and mainly confined to precise verification of points of detail, in marked contrast to the dramatic style and absorption in first principles displayed by Beatrice Webb. In later life she suffered much from ill health and lived largely in retirement with her husband in Oxshott and subsequently in Golders Green. She wrote a short memoir of her husband which was published in 1924. Helen Bosanquet died at her home, 13 Heathgate, Golders Green, on 7 April 1925.<br>
