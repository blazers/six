<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Wrench, Sir  (John) Evelyn Leslie</span>  (1882&#150;1966), <span class="occ">promoter of the British empire and author</span>, was born at Brookeborough, co. Fermanagh, Ireland, on 29 October 1882, the younger son of Frederick Stringer Wrench (1849&#150;1926) of Killacoona, co. Dublin, an Irish land commissioner, and his wife, Charlotte Mary (<i>d</i>. 1935), daughter of Sir Alan Edward Bellingham, third baronet, of Castle Bellingham, co. Louth. His older brother, F. A. C. Wrench, a sub-lieutenant in the Central India horse, died of malaria in 1903. He had two sisters, Mary and Winifride.<br>
<br>Wrench was educated at Summer Fields School, Oxford (1893&#150;6), and at Eton College (1896&#150;9), where he excelled at modern languages but fell behind in other subjects. His schooling was frequently interrupted by injury or ill health, and after one such episode, in March 1899, his parents withdrew him from Eton in order to allow him to travel on the continent. Discarding an earlier vocation to become a missionary, Wrench determined on a diplomatic career, and, after travelling through Russia and Turkey with his family, he spent eight months in Germany perfecting his knowledge of the German language. While there, however, he hit upon the idea of emulating the German production of picture postcards. On his return to England at the age of seventeen he founded the <span class="roman">Wrench Series</span>. Old Etonian contacts were useful in obtaining permission to set up stalls at royal and public buildings, but the success of Wrench's business owed a great deal to his own skills as a salesman and organizer. At one point Wrench was employing 100 staff and had a turnover in excess of &pound;5000 a month. Wrench himself was catapulted into the public eye as a fine example of a young British entrepreneur. Over-rapid expansion proved his undoing, however, as too much capital was locked up in stands and stock. The banks foreclosed early in 1904, and Wrench was forced to sell his business for a nominal amount. Wrench's failure was a personal blow, but it was one from which he was able to learn. Thereafter, his enthusiasm was always tempered by perseverance and a certain stoicism.<br>
<br>One of those who had been impressed by Wrench's entrepreneurial abilities was Alfred Harmsworth, Lord Northcliffe. In July 1904 he invited Wrench to join his staff as a private secretary. Wrench agreed, and for the next eight years he acted as Northcliffe's assistant and troubleshooter, serving variously as editor of the overseas edition of the <span class="italic">Daily Mail</span>, editor of the <span class="italic">Weekly Dispatch</span>, managing director of the Paris <span class="italic">Daily Mail</span>, and export and sales manager of the Amalgamated Press.<br>
<br>As a young student in Germany in 1900 Wrench had been much affected by the continental reaction to Britain's difficulties during the South African War. His imperial enthusiasm was reawakened during a visit to Canada in 1906, when he stayed with Lord Grey, who showed him Cecil Rhodes's political will and testament. This kindled in Wrench the idea of an &#145;empire crusade&#146;, modelled on the German Navy League, to harness support for the empire in Britain and its overseas dominions. Wrench's sense of mission was strengthened during the 1909 Imperial Press Conference, and in 1910, with Northcliffe's encouragement, he launched the Overseas Club with an article in the <span class="italic">Daily Mail</span>. Wrench at first combined the organization of the club with newspaper work, but he soon found that he had to fight the impression that it was merely a publicity stunt for the overseas <span class="italic">Daily Mail</span>. Turning down Northcliffe's offer to make him editor-in-chief of periodicals and a director of the Amalgamated Press, Wrench resigned his newspaper posts in 1912 in order to devote himself fully to his imperial mission.<br>
<br>The Overseas Club (renamed the Overseas League following its amalgamation with the Patriotic League of Britons Overseas in 1918) enjoyed a rapid success. Wrench described it as &#145;a kind of &#147;Grown-up Boy Scouts&#148;&#146;  (Wrench, <span class="italic">Uphill</span>, 266). Branches of the club&#151;many of them founded by Wrench during an empire tour in 1912&#150;13&#151;were regularly supplied with speakers and suggestions as to activities by the central office, and, from 1915, with the journal <span class="italic">Overseas</span>, edited by Wrench. During the First World War the club raised more than &pound;1 million towards providing tobacco and other &#145;comforts&#146; for the troops.<br>
<br>Wrench joined the Royal Flying Corps as a second lieutenant on 23 March 1917 and was immediately posted to Scotland to oversee recruiting work. During this time he was involved in attempts to found an Irish Unity League, to promote the idea of a united Ireland within the British empire. A brief visit to Ireland soon convinced him that the scheme was not worth pursuing. In June 1917 he joined the staff of the Air Board, and in December he was promoted major and appointed principal private secretary to the air minister, Lord Rothermere. Following the latter's resignation in April 1918 Wrench joined the Ministry of Information, where he was given overall control of the British empire section, reporting directly to Sir Roderick Jones and Lord Beaverbrook. He was created CMG for his war services in 1917.<br>
<br>During the war Wrench conceived the idea of a new organization to promote friendship and co-operation between the British empire and the United States, which he saw as vital to the stability of the post-war international order. With the help of Walter Hines Page, the American ambassador, and Sir George Perley, the Canadian high commissioner, he launched the English-Speaking Union at a dinner in London on 28 June 1918, presided over by Lord Balfour. Like the Overseas Club, the English-Speaking Union prospered rapidly, promoting exchanges, travelling fellowships, lectures, and social events, and from January 1919 publishing the journal <span class="italic">Landmark</span>, again edited by Wrench. Absorbing the Atlantic Union (founded by Sir Walter Besant in 1897) in February 1919, the English-Speaking Union attracted members from throughout Britain and the self-governing dominions, and Wrench was closely involved in setting up a sister society, the English-Speaking Union of the United States, with William H. Taft as its first president, in May 1920.<br>
<br>Throughout the inter-war years Wrench devoted much of his time to the affairs of the Overseas League and the English-Speaking Union. In addition, he became a contributor to <span class="italic">The Spectator</span> in 1922, joined the board the following year, bought a controlling interest from St Loe Strachey in 1925, and served as editor from 1925 to 1932. He later sold his controlling interest to Ian Gilmour, but he remained chairman of the board for the rest of his life. For his various public services Wrench was knighted in 1932.<br>
<br>In 1929 Wrench founded a third society, the All Peoples Association, with the aim of promoting international amity in general and Anglo-German understanding in particular. The rise of Nazism made the work of the association increasingly difficult, and Wrench found himself (unfairly) branded as a pro-Nazi. In 1936 he reluctantly decided to close the association. The publication of his book <span class="italic">I Loved Germany</span> in 1940&#151;attempting to distinguish between Nazism and the traditional characteristics of the German people&#151;was widely criticized by contemporaries.<br>
<br>On 18 May 1937 Wrench married his first cousin, Hylda Henrietta (1879&#150;1955), daughter of Sir Victor Alexander Brooke, third baronet, sister of Sir Alan Brooke (later Viscount Alanbrooke), and widow of Sir Frederick Des Voeux, seventh baronet. Hylda was an enthusiastic supporter of Wrench's many causes, serving as chairwoman of the Overseas League's Soldiers and Sailors Fund from 1914 to 1918 (receiving the CBE in 1918) and as the league's honorary controller from 1918 to 1940. After their marriage she was an invaluable collaborator as well as companion. Her death was a great blow. They had no children.<br>
<br>In August 1940 Wrench and his wife set out on a lecture tour of Canada, the United States, New Zealand, and Australia, putting the case for a vigorous war effort. Returning via Singapore, they were stranded in India, where they stayed until April 1944. While there, they busied themselves organizing social functions and welfare work for American servicemen and civilians. In May 1942 the viceroy, Lord Linlithgow, appointed Wrench American relations officer with the government of India. Wrench's main task in this post was to organize meetings for American journalists with representatives of the Muslims, the untouchables, the princely states, and others opposed to Congress policies. He later considered that his efforts had gone a long way towards moderating the pro-Congress line of the American press.<br>
<br>After the war Wrench devoted himself increasingly to writing. Particularly noteworthy were his three biographies, <span class="italic">Francis Yeats-Brown</span> (1948), <span class="italic">Geoffrey Dawson and our Times</span> (1955), and <span class="italic">Alfred, Lord Milner: the Man of No Illusions</span> (1958). All three were based on personal acquaintance as well as access to the private papers of his subjects.<br>
<br>In 1958 Wrench was involved in the foundation of yet another society, the Anglo-Kin Society, which aimed to encourage genealogical and topographical research in Britain for the benefit of the descendants of British settlers overseas. He was president of the Dickens Fellowship from 1961 to 1964, and was for many years senior trustee of the Cecil Rhodes Memorial Museum Foundation at Bishop's Stortford, Hertfordshire. On the occasion of the Overseas League's golden jubilee in 1960 (when it was given the title Royal) Wrench was advanced to KCMG. His work for Anglo-American understanding was recognized by the award of the Benjamin Franklin medal by the Royal Society of Arts in 1964. He also received honorary degrees from the universities of Bristol and St Andrews.<br>
<br>Contemporaries remembered Wrench as ascetic-looking, graceful, and charming, with an infectious enthusiasm and boundless energy. He was not an original thinker, but he wrote fluently and engagingly. His main talent was for organizing people. His first loyalty was to the empire, but, like his hero Lord Milner and his friends Lionel Curtis and Philip Kerr (Lord Lothian), he conceived of the empire as a free association of peoples, co-operating to promote self-government and international stability. He was a firm supporter of Indian constitutional reform while editor of <span class="italic">The Spectator</span> and, despite his lifelong concern to promote friendship between peoples of British descent, he condemned racism in any form. Again like Curtis and Kerr, he found it easy to transfer his enthusiasm from the idea of imperial unity to that of eventual world unity, whether through federation or some other means.<br>
<br>Wrench died at his home, the Mill House, Marlow, Buckinghamshire, on 11 November 1966. He was buried at All Saints' Church, Marlow, on 15 November, and a memorial service was held in St Paul's Cathedral on 9 December.<br>
