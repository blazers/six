<span class="headword">Warelwast,  Robert  de</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1155), <span class="occ">bishop of Exeter</span>, was a nephew of his predecessor, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28731/', "William de Warelwast")</script>. He is not to be confused with his successor at Exeter, Robert (II) (1155&#150;60), who broke the Warelwast hold on the church. William was a reformer who modernized his old-fashioned English church and diocese, and it seems that he looked to his nephew to continue the work. He sent him to be educated at Laon under Master Anselm and made him archdeacon of Exeter (first appearing in 1113), in effect his deputy in spiritualities. It is not therefore surprising that following William's death, on 27 September 1137, Robert was elected by the chapter to succeed him. The new king, Stephen, accepted this on 10 April 1138 at the Council of Northampton, and, as the archbishopric of Canterbury was then vacant, Robert was consecrated bishop on 18 December by the papal legate, Alberic, bishop of Ostia.<br>
<br>William de Warelwast had worked closely with his powerful king, Henry I, and Robert naturally followed suit. In 1135 he had been with Henry at Caen. When Henry died on 1 December of that year his nephew, Stephen, seized the throne at the expense of Henry's daughter Matilda, who was married to Geoffrey Plantagenet, count of Anjou. The subsequent rivalry between Stephen and Matilda made difficulties during the next nineteen years for all those in positions of authority in England and Normandy. Robert seems to have accepted Stephen unreservedly&#151;in 1139 he was one of the English delegates to Innocent II's famous Second Lateran Council; and as his diocese was of no strategic importance in the civil war that broke out in 1139, he appears to have had a relatively peaceful existence. In charters of 1143 and 1149, both concerned with Totnes, he acknowledged Stephen as the reigning king. In 1146, however, in connection with the priory of St James, Exeter, he accepted Baldwin de Revi&egrave;res, who in 1136 had occupied Exeter Castle and was then expelled from Devon, as earl of Exeter or Devon, a title conferred on him by Matilda. Robert's one recorded belligerent act was the excommunication in 1140 of Reginald fitz Roy, Matilda's half-brother whom she had made earl of Cornwall, for plundering the lands of the church. That the Exeter mint issued coinage of ambiguous authority is in keeping. The only time that Robert got into trouble seems to have been in 1148, when he was suspended for non-attendance at Pope Eugenius III's Council of Rheims. But since he obtained general grants of protection from that pope for his church's possessions and rights on 7 February 1146 and 14 March 1153, he clearly remained on good terms with him.<br>
<br>It would seem that Robert graduated easily from his apprenticeship under his uncle to his role as a full bishop. Like his uncle he became a member of the Exeter Kalendar Guild. He patronized a local man, Baldwin of Forde, the future archbishop of Canterbury (1184&#150;90), sending him to Italy to study law. More adventurous was his patronage of Richard Peche (Peccator) one of a clan associated with Salisbury which came to occupy a number of ecclesiastical offices at Exeter, who is found in Robert's entourage as early as 1143.<br>
<br>Robert lasted into Henry II's reign and attended his coronation on 19 December 1154. On 7 February 1155 he translated Launceston Priory's relics to its new site, but died soon afterwards, probably on 28 March, and was buried in his cathedral. According to the <span class="italic">Ordinale Exoniense</span> four candles should be lit on the anniversary of Robert &#145;Warwest&#146;, who lies in the choir. Between 19 December 1154 and Michelmas 1156 Henry II deprived the church of Exeter of its rich chapelry of Bosham for the &#145;crime&#146; of making an appeal to Adrian IV. It cannot be said with certainty whether this punishment occurred during Robert's last days, during the vacancy of the see (28 March to 5 June 1155), or in the first months of Robert (II)'s pontificate. Bosham was recovered by the diocese in 1177; even so, the episode was a sad ending to the rule of the Warelwast family.<br>
