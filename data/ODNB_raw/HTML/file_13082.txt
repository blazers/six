<span class="headword">Herman,  Henry</span> <span class="st"> [<em>real name </em>Henry Heydrac D'Arco]</span>  (1832&#150;1894), <span class="occ">playwright and novelist</span>, was educated at a military college in Alsace. He later emigrated to the United States, fought in the Confederate ranks during the American Civil War, and lost an eye at the battle of Bull Run in Virginia. He had returned to England by 1875, as on 15 May of that year he produced <span class="italic">Jeanne Dubarry</span>, a drama in three acts, at the Charing Cross Theatre in London. His name was given as Henry Heydrac D'Arco, son of Charles Heydrac D'Arco, colonel, when he married, at Lincoln, on 25 July 1877 Eugenie Adelaide (1856/7&#150;1947), the only daughter of Frederick Edwards, saddler. She was an actress, and later played in two of Herman's pieces. It was as D'Arco that he was involved in bankruptcy proceedings, in May 1879, Henry Herman being cited as his professional name. Herman's first conspicuous dramatic success, after producing several more plays, was <span class="italic">The Silver King</span>, a drama in five acts, written in conjunction with Henry Arthur Jones, which opened on 16 November 1882. Disputes regarding which collaborator had done more work on <span class="italic">The Silver King</span> ensued. Jones argued at first that Herman &#145;did not write a line of it&#146;  (Jones, 68), though he later acknowledged that Herman had at least written &#145;the end of the second act&#146;  (ibid., 73). Herman also collaborated with Jones on <span class="italic">Breaking a Butterfly</span>, an adaptation of Ibsen's <span class="italic">A Doll's House</span>, which opened at the Prince of Wales Theatre on 3 March 1884, and <span class="italic">Chatterton</span> (Princess's, 22 May 1884). In collaboration with William Gorman Wills he wrote <span class="italic">Claudian</span>, a three-act play performed at the Princess's on 6 December 1884. <span class="italic">The Golden Band</span>, in four acts (Olympic, 14 January 1887), was by Herman and Freeman Wills. Herman is responsible for two untraceable dramas, <span class="italic">For Old Virginia</span> (1891) and <span class="italic">Eagle Joe</span> (1892), and for <span class="italic">The Fay o' Fire</span>, a romantic opera, with music by Edward Jones (Opera Comique, 14 November 1885).<br>
<br>Herman collaborated with David Christie Murray in writing six novels between 1887 and 1891, including the melodramatic <span class="italic">Bishop's Bible</span> (1890), and <span class="italic">He Fell among Thieves</span> (1891). His name alone appears as the author of more than ten novels, including <span class="italic">His Angel</span> (1891), a story which begins vividly with a lynching in New Mexico, and <span class="italic">Eagle Joe</span> (1892), &#145;a Wild West Romance&#146;. His novels were hastily written but exciting, and he wrote stories up to his death.<br>
<br>Freeman Wills noted that although Herman &#145;had not a trace of humour himself &hellip; he was fertile in invention and teemed with melodrama, and had &hellip; an excellent and refined judgment&#146;  (Wills, 220), especially regarding the work of others. He observed that Herman was &#145;an exacting collaborator&#146; and that &#145;his manner was that of the irritable foreigner, but he was thoroughly kind-hearted and chivalrous in his domestic life, and well maintained the dignity of a literary man&#146;  (ibid., 227).<br>
<br>Herman's choice theatrical library was sold at Sothebys on 23 January 1885, when 234 lots fetched over &pound;16,000. The high prices were due in great measure to the large number of grangerized books, illustrated with prints or engravings taken from other books. He died at Gunnersbury, Middlesex, on 24 September 1894 and was buried at St Mary's Roman Catholic cemetery, Kensal Green, in a plot purchased by his erstwhile collaborator Henry Arthur Jones.<br>
