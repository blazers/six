<span class="headword">Hill,  Samuel</span>  (1648/9&#150;1716), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and religious controversialist</span>, was the son of William Hill of South Petherton, Somerset. He matriculated from Lincoln College, Oxford, on 10 April 1663, aged fourteen, but transferred to St Mary's Hall from where he graduated BA in 1666. Nothing is known of his activities until 18 February 1673 when he was installed in the parish of Meare, Somerset. On 21 December 1679 he married Grace Pinfold at St Augustine with St Faith, London. On 10 May 1687 he was presented to the parish of Kilmington in Somerset by Sir Stephen Fox. He was made prebendary of Buckland Dinham in Wells Cathedral on 5 September 1688, appointed master of Bruton Free School, Somerset, in 1700, installed archdeacon of Wells on 12 October 1705 (at which time he appears in the records as MA), and elected a canon residentiary of the cathedral on 25 November 1708. Anthony Wood characterized Hill as a man &#145;much esteemed for his learning and zeal for the Church of England&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, new edn, 1813&#150;20, 4.564).<br>
<br>In his first published work, <span class="italic">The Catholic Balance</span> (London, 1687), the high-church Hill sets out the themes to which he would return throughout his career. He is concerned to defend &#145;true doctrine&#146;, which he defines as that which is &#145;caught in the Scriptures, preached by the Fathers, and universally received in the Primitive Church&#146;  (p. 134), and he argues for an ecclesiastical hierarchy that is of divine and apostolic origin, and therefore independent within its own bounds. Hill followed this up in 1688 with <span class="italic">The Necessity of Heresies Asserted and Explained</span> (London, 1688), in which he argues that heresy is morally necessary in order to demonstrate &#145;right doctrine&#146;  (p. 13). <span class="italic">De presbyteratu dissertatio quadripartita</span> (London, 1691) was Hill's attack on the structure and doctrines of Presbyterianism.<br>
<br>Hill subsequently became engaged in the controversy surrounding the oath of allegiance to William and Mary imposed by parliament in 1689 upon all beneficed clergy. Six bishops and about 400 lower clergy refused to swear the oaths and were deprived of their livings in early 1690. In 1692 Hill, who was distressed at the change of bishops but had nevertheless taken the oath, published a justification of conformity entitled <span class="italic">Solomon and Abiathar, or, The Case of the Deprived Bishops and Clergy Discussed</span> (London, 1692). He insists that the secular deprivations are lawful because they were done for just reasons, and the church has concurred in them. Hill revisited the issue four years later in <span class="italic">A Debate on the Justice and Piety of the Present Constitution under King William</span> (London, 1696).<br>
<br>In 1694 Gilbert Burnet, bishop of Salisbury, published his <span class="italic">Four Discourses</span> (London, 1694). The second of these, &#145;Concerning the divinity and death of Christ&#146;, was challenged by Hill in his <span class="italic">A Vindication of the Primitive Fathers</span> (London, 1695). Burnet's exposition of the Trinity and incarnation, argues Hill, is so ambiguous that it leaves &#145;a latitude for various heresies in this &#147;mystery&#148;&#146;  (p. 7). Such latitude &#145;leadeth to destruction, in the service of heretical Comprehensions&#146;  (p. 53). Burnet complained to the bishop of London that his chaplain, Roger Altham, professor of Hebrew at Oxford, had licensed such a book &#145;full of scurrility&#146;, and Altham was obliged to make a public apology to Burnet for letting the book slip through. Although there were rumours that Hill would be suspended by the bishops for his assault on Burnet, he escaped punishment. Burnet later published an anonymous reply. Apparently Hill wrote a defence of his <span class="italic">Vindication</span>, and also revised his <span class="italic">Vindication</span> in preparation for a second edition, but neither ever appeared in print.<br>
<br>As early as 1693 some high-church clergy, including Hill, had been calling for a convocation of the clergy of the ecclesiastical province of Canterbury to settle the Anglican definition of the Trinity. The campaign came to a head with the publication of Francis Atterbury's <span class="italic">Letter to a Convocation Man</span> (London, 1696). The official response came from William Wake in his <span class="italic">The Authority of Christian Princes over their Ecclesiastical Synods Asserted</span> (London, 1697). Hill waded into the controversy with his <span class="italic">Municipium ecclesiasticum, or, The Rights, Liberties, and Authorities of the Christian Church</span> (London, 1697), the first reply to Wake. Hill declares that the church has a &#145;divine right&#146; to hold synods to govern its own affairs. There are examples of synods in scripture and instances in early church history of synods running church affairs without interference from secular authorities. He later defended <span class="italic">Municipium ecclesiasticum</span> from an attack by Wake in <span class="italic">The Rites of the Christian Church Further Defended</span> (London, 1698). The subject of church power was one to which Hill returned in <span class="italic">A Discourse on Government</span> (London, 1698), <span class="italic">A Brief Discourse into the Grounds, Authority &hellip; of Ecclesiastical Synods</span> (London, 1698), and <span class="italic">The Rights, Liberties and Authorities of the Christian Church</span> (London, 1701).<br>
<br>After this flurry of activity nothing further appeared in print until <span class="italic">A thorough examination of the false principles and fallacious arguments advanced against the Christian church</span> (London, 1708), Hill's response to Matthew Tindal's &#145;pernicious&#146; book <span class="italic">The Rights of the Christian Church Asserted</span> (London, 1708). Hill's final three works, published in 1713, were concerned with remission of sins, baptism, and the <span class="roman">Apocrypha</span>. He died on 7 March 1716 and is buried in Wells Cathedral.<br>
<br>Hill was survived by his wife, Grace, by at least two sons, William and Samuel, and by daughters. The preamble to his will, written four days before he died, conveys Hill's sense of mission as a defender of the church, thanking God for his mercies:<blockquote>transcendingly above all with the divinest of all Imployments in the Services of the Priesthood whereby I have been admitted into the knowledge of God and of his holy Oracles and enabled with a zeale to defend the faith and Church of Christ against all the Adversaries thereof these Ages.</blockquote>He put himself into the hands of God, &#145;now the Time of my Warfare seeming to be at an end&#146;  (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/553, fol. 93<i>v</i>).<br>
