<span class="headword">Allestree,  Richard</span>  (<em>b. </em>before 1582, <em>d.</em> <em>c.</em>1643), <span class="occ">almanac maker and mathematician</span>, was a younger son of William Allestree (<i>b</i>. before 1520, <i>d</i>. 1581) and his wife, Ellen. The family lived at Alvaston and Derby. Richard was an uncle of the famous royalist divine Richard Allestree. William Allestree was five times MP for Derby between 1542 and 1555, and five times bailiff of Derby (1541&#150;79). Well educated, with a good grasp of Latin, Richard practised and probably taught mathematics, including surveying. His work <span class="italic">The Arithmathematicall Treasurie</span> was entered in the Stationers' register in July 1650 but is otherwise unknown. He published a series of well-known almanacs between 1617 and 1643, calculated for Derby and sometimes Coventry (where his younger brother, James, was a goldsmith); two earlier editions, for 1615 and 1616, were not published. The almanacs included information on some local topics, such as Derby's annual fairs and its first mayor, and a woodcut of a quadrant to be cut out and pasted on a board for use as a simple surveying instrument.<br>
<br>Allestree had practised astrology for twenty years before compiling almanacs, but came to believe&#151;&#145;God opening mine eyes&#146;  (Bretnor, sig. A3<i>v</i>)&#151;that it was essentially fraudulent. His almanacs reflect this view and have a pious, even puritan flavour, with numerous biblical citations and attacks on popish idolatry. He conceded that the stars had some influence as secondary causes, for instance by altering the balance of the four humours, but judged it ungodly and unlawful to seek to predict the future. He stressed instead the role of free will and of divine providence. While accepting astrology's value in physic, especially for deciding the best time to draw blood from patients, he dismissed as heathenish the notion that parts of the body were governed by different zodiacal signs, and he brushed aside the use of astrology in farming as superstitious. In 1618 Thomas Bretnor, the leading almanac maker of the time, poured scorn on so-called &#145;Christian Almanackes&#146;, an allusion to Allestree's works; Allestree responded in his edition for 1619, repudiating the ten extreme positions Bretnor had fathered on him but repeating his condemnation of judicial astrology. On astronomical matters Allestree was a traditionalist, mocking the ideas of Copernicus and Tycho Brahe. His friend Robert Woodford, who wrote admiring verses in many editions, may have been the well-known Northamptonshire puritan diarist, who had connections with Coventry. Allestree, who is not known to have married, probably died about 1643.<br>
