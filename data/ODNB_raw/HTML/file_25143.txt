<span class="headword">Sewell,  Jonathan</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1766, <em>d.</em> 1839), <span class="occ">jurist in Canada</span>, the son of Jonathan Sewall (1728&#150;1796), the last British attorney-general of Massachusetts, and Esther Quincy, was baptized on 6 June 1766 at Cambridge, Massachusetts. He moved to England in 1775 with his loyalist parents, and was educated at Bristol grammar school and Brasenose College, Oxford. In 1785 he emigrated to New Brunswick and studied law, then in 1789 went to Quebec, where he was called to the bar on 30 October 1789. In 1793 he became solicitor-general, and in 1795 attorney-general and advocate-general. On 24 September 1796 he married Henrietta, known as Harriet, the daughter of William Smith, former chief justice of New York and Lower Canada. They had sixteen children, of whom twelve survived infancy. In 1797 Sewell entered the house of assembly as member for William Henry, for which he sat through three parliaments, until in 1808 he became chief justice of Lower Canada, an office he filled for thirty years. Shortly afterwards he was named speaker of the legislative council and president of the executive council. He resigned from the second in 1830 but held the speakership until his death.<br>
<br>As attorney-general Sewell prosecuted David McLane, an American undercover agent working for revolutionary France, on a charge of high treason (1797). While building a persuasive case, he was also a party to dubious transactions which ensured that the accused would be convicted and serve as a dramatic example. McLane was hanged, disembowelled, and beheaded before a huge throng of spectators in Quebec City.<br>
<br>Like most of the tiny English &eacute;lite in the 1790s and early 1800s, Sewell was an alarmist who assumed that, if France invaded, the French-speaking Canadian majority would rise in supportive rebellion, with English heads targeted for local &#145;Jacobin&#146; pikes. One political conclusion Sewell and others drew was the imperative need to anglify the Canadians, a viewpoint dropped during the Anglo-American War of 1812&#150;14, when he realized the United States, not faraway France, had become the major external threat to the colony. Sewell's previous attempts at anglification had embittered relations between the Canadians and the English.<br>
<br>Sir James Henry Craig (1748&#150;1812), governor from 1807 to 1811, quickly absorbed the garrison mentality of the English minority and acted on it in 1810 by imprisoning, without bail or trial, three leaders of the constitutionally liberal opposition <i>parti canadien</i>. These men&#151;members of the provincial parliament and editors of their party's strident newspaper, <span class="italic">Le Canadien</span>&#151;were charged with &#145;treasonable practices&#146;, the meaning of which was unknown on both sides of the Atlantic. With others of the executive council Sewell had advised Craig to do this, on the grounds that the three were in league with Napoleon through his ambassador to Washington. Sewell presided at a habeas corpus hearing of one prisoner, refusing the writ on the debatable basis that no parliamentary privilege existed. The British attorney-general later concluded the arrests had been illegal, as there was no proof whatever of treasonable practices.<br>
<br>One of Sewell's earliest acts as chief justice produced a remarkable episode in Canadian history. In 1809 he issued rules of practice for the Quebec king's bench and another set for the provincial court of appeals. In 1814 they were attacked by the assembly, under the leadership of James Stuart (1780&#150;1853), as a usurpation of the law-making authority of the legislature and as affecting the liberty of the subject. Sewell was impeached for subverting the constitution and charged with malicious influence over the governor, leading to various specified acts which covered the whole range of conflict between the house and the government under Craig, including the incarceration of the <i>parti canadien</i> leaders. James Monk, chief justice of Montreal, was joined in the indictment, but only for issuing his own rules of practice. Like Sewell's they followed Westminster precedents very closely. Sewell defended himself in England, where the colonial secretary, Lord Bathurst, dismissed the political charges as a matter of constitutional principle, the governor alone being responsible for executive decisions. This undermined the <i>parti canadien</i>'s notion of a local ministry accountable in cases of serious misbehaviour to the assembly. The privy council found nothing wrong with the various rules of practice.<br>
<br>From 1793 Sewell exercised considerable influence over virtually every governor, reaching the pinnacle twice as &#145;prime minister&#146;: under Craig and Lord Dalhousie (1820&#150;28). He successfully advised the latter to take a hard line&#151;to the point of rejecting the assembly's choice of speaker (1827)&#151;in the prolonged dispute over control of public appropriations. Not surprisingly the chief justice exploited his position to gain lucrative government patronage for himself and his family.<br>
<br>In the legislative council Sewell pursued an extreme tory line, for instance initiating the legally questionable imprisonment for libel of two <i>patriote</i> newspaper editors for attacking the upper house. He was also one of the pioneers of cultural development, and was a founder (1824) and later president (1830&#150;31) of the Quebec Literary and Historical Society. He gave the first paper in 1824, <span class="italic">An essay on the juridical history of France, so far as it relates to the law of the province of Lower-Canada</span>. His other notable publications dealt in constitutional issues: expounding parliamentary procedure (1792) and advocating federation of the British North American colonies (1814, 1824).<br>
<br>Sewell died on 11 November 1839 and was buried four days later from the Anglican cathedral in Quebec City. He was survived by his wife. His judgments, particularly on French civil law, were remarkable for clarity, articulation of general principle, and profound scholarship. His main shortcoming as a judge was to find that law which suited the political interests of the executive. He was awarded an honorary LLD by Harvard University in 1832. At the end of the twentieth century he is recognized by Canadian legal historians as one of Canada's most accomplished jurists.<br>
