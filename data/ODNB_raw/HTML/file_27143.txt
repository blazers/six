<span class="headword">Terrien De Lacouperie,  Albert &Eacute;tienne Jean Baptiste</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1894), <span class="occ">philologist</span>, born in Normandy, was a descendant of the Cornish family of Terrien, which emigrated to France in the seventeenth century during the civil war, and acquired the property of La Couperie in Normandy. His father was a silk merchant and Terrien De Lacouperie, after accompanying him to Hong Kong, followed his father into the silk trade. After almost all of his property was destroyed in a typhoon, he returned to Europe. Opposition to the republic made him decide to settle permanently in England rather than his native France, and he eventually became a British subject. He turned his attention entirely to the study of oriental languages, in which he had become interested in Hong Kong, where he had acquired an intimate knowledge of the Chinese language. In 1867 he published in Paris a philological work, entitled <span class="italic">Du langage: essai sur la nature et l'&eacute;tude des mots et des langues</span>, which attracted considerable attention. He became interested in the progress made in deciphering Babylonian inscriptions, and by the resemblance between the Chinese characters and the early Akkadian hieroglyphics. The comparative philology of the two languages occupied most of his later life, and he was able to show an early affinity between them.<br>
<br>In 1879 Terrien De Lacouperie went to London, and in the same year was elected a fellow of the Royal Asiatic Society. In 1884 he became professor of Indo-Chinese philology, as applied to the languages of south-eastern Asia, at University College, London. He took a particular interest in the derivations of the languages of Chinese indigenous groups, and collected materials on their vocabulary and grammar, including those of the Lolos people of western China. He published his findings in <span class="italic">The Languages of China before the Chinese</span> in London in 1887. The Lolos material had originally been collected by Edward Baber of the British consular service, who was a close friend. Lacouperie also wrote extensively for the <span class="italic">Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society</span> and other publications on the relationship between Babylonian and Chinese characters, the origins of Asiatic languages, other related philological subjects, and Buddhism. From 1886 he edited the <span class="italic">Babylonian and Oriental Record</span>. His last years were largely occupied by a study of the <span class="italic">I Ching (Yi Jing)</span> (<span class="roman">Book of changes</span>), the oldest work in the Chinese language. Its meaning had long proved a puzzle both to native and to foreign scholars. Lacouperie demonstrated that the basis of the work consisted of fragmentary notes, chiefly lexical in character, and noticed that they bore a close resemblance to the syllabaries of Chaldea. In 1892 he published the first part of an explanatory treatise entitled <span class="italic">The Oldest Book of the Chinese</span>, in which he stated his theory of the nature of the <span class="italic">I Ching</span> and gave translations of passages from it. The treatise, however, was not completed before his death.<br>
<br>Terrien De Lacouperie's services to oriental study were recognized by an honorary LittD from the University of Louvain and, for a time, a small pension from the French government. When that was withdrawn his friends tried, unsuccessfully, to obtain him an equivalent from the English ministry. He was twice awarded the prix Julien by the Acad&eacute;mie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres for his services to oriental philology. Terrien De Lacouperie died of typhoid fever at his home, 136 Bishop's Road, Fulham, on 11 October 1894, leaving a widow, Antoinette de la Bruneti&egrave;re. He also edited the &#145;Babylonian and Oriental Record&#146; from 1886.<br>
