<span class="headword">Paris, Sir  Archibald</span>  (1861&#150;1937), <span class="occ">Royal Marine officer</span>, was born at Lansdown, Bath, on 9 November 1861, the youngest son of the Revd Archibald Paris (1816&#150;1861), of Ludgvan, Cornwall, and his wife, Caroline, second daughter of the Revd Sir Henry Delves Broughton, eighth baronet. Having been educated at Eton College and the Royal Naval College, Greenwich, he joined the Royal Marine Artillery in 1879. On 3 September 1885 he married Lilian Jean (<i>b</i>. 1861/2), youngest daughter of Colonel Henry Melvill of the 7th Bengal cavalry.<br>
<br>Paris graduated from the Staff College, Camberley, in 1888, and, after a period afloat and five years as adjutant of the 1st Antrim artillery militia (1894&#150;9), he was appointed to serve in the South African War in South Africa in 1900. Initially he was employed in training field batteries in Rhodesia, and he finally commanded, under Lord Methuen, the &#145;Kimberley column&#146;, a mixed force, mostly mounted irregulars, which was attacked and forced to surrender near Tweebosch in March 1902 owing to the flight of most of the mounted troops. Paris was exonerated from blame and later commended for organizing the gallant resistance. Thrice mentioned in dispatches, he was promoted brevet lieutenant-colonel in June 1902 for distinguished service in the field. From 1903 to 1906 he was chief instructor in military history and tactics at the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich.<br>
<br>In September 1914 Paris relieved Sir G. G. Aston in command of the Royal Marine brigade, and in October he was promoted temporary major-general and appointed to command the Royal Naval division, which he led with distinction at Antwerp, throughout the Gallipoli campaign, and in France. Paris had limited opportunities to display his abilities as a divisional commander in action: at Antwerp his forces were dispersed and communications with them were difficult, in many cases non-existent; on Gallipoli the Royal Naval division only came together as an entity under his command three weeks after the initial landings. Further severe casualties in their early actions and lack of reinforcements so depleted the division that, for the latter stages of the campaign, they were used primarily for trench-holding duties. He was severely wounded in October 1916, with the eventual loss of a leg, shortly before his division took part in its first major action in France. His greatest contribution to the RND was in establishing the organization and <i>esprit de corps</i> to enable it to develop into an efficient fighting formation&#151;one which eventually came to be regarded as an &eacute;lite unit of the British expeditionary force. In addition Paris was instrumental in ensuring the continued existence of the division and the retention of its peculiarly naval identity, in particular after the Dardanelles campaign, when it looked certain that the RND would be disbanded or converted into a &#145;normal&#146; army unit. In June 1917 he was placed on the retired list as &#145;unfit for further service owing to wounds&#146;.<br>
<br>Paris was five times mentioned in dispatches, and promoted major-general in 1915. He was appointed CB in 1907 and KCB in 1916. He also received many foreign decorations. He was honorary colonel commandant of the Portsmouth division, Royal Marines (1923&#150;33), and was awarded a good-service pension in 1925.<br>
<br>Tall and spare, with a cast in one eye caused by an accident, Paris had a thorough grasp of his profession; he was popular with his men, and a highly regarded commander. His only son, Brigadier Archibald Charles Melvill, was killed on active service in Malaya in 1942. Archibald Paris died at Chatelard, Montreux, Switzerland, on 30 October 1937, and was survived by his wife.<br>
