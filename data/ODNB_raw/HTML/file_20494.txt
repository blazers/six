<span class="headword">Ockley,  Simon</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1679, <em>d.</em> 1720), <span class="occ">orientalist</span>, was baptized at Topsham, near Exeter, on 17 February 1679, the son of Thomas Okely of Great Ellingham, Norfolk, and his wife, Thomazin. Although he came of a gentleman's family, he struggled against poverty throughout his career, sometimes aided by patrons. The first of these, Sir Algernon Potts of Mannington in Norfolk, befriended him as a boy, and perhaps obtained his admission as a sizar to Queens' College, Cambridge, in February 1694. He took his BA in 1698, and already showed considerable linguistic talent. Perhaps in 1700, he was appointed to a Hebrew lectureship worth &pound;10 annually. On 15 April 1696 he married Martha Austin (<i>d</i>. 1728) at Knapwell in Cambridgeshire; six children were born to them between May 1702 and December 1708.<br>
<br>Ockley took deacon's orders before he was twenty, and by 1701 was curate of Swavesey, near St Ives in Cambridgeshire, probably on the recommendation of Simon Patrick, bishop of Ely. In 1705 he was ordained priest, and was presented by Jesus College, Cambridge, to the living of Swavesey, worth &pound;80 annually. He never received any further ecclesiastical preferment. He was admitted BD at Cambridge in 1710, and in the same year was appointed chaplain to Robert Harley, who in 1711 became earl of Oxford and lord high treasurer of England. Ockley was clearly out of his depth in high society, and in 1714 apologized at length to his patron for some obscure indiscretion in company, and defended himself against the imputation of &#145;sottishness&#146;. He had indeed a propensity to get into scrapes. In September 1710 Ockley obliged William Whiston with the partial translation of an Arabic version of the <span class="roman">Didascalia</span> (a fourth-century Christian work, the major part of a collection of ecclesiastical rules and customs, the apostolic constitutions, ascribed to the apostles). Whiston, as well as being Sir Isaac Newton's successor as Lucasian professor of mathematics, was devoted to the restoration of primitive Christianity, and regarded the <span class="roman">Didascalia</span> as an essential support to his cause. Ockley soon realized that he was straying into dangerous company. Whiston, as a result of his theological opinions, was deprived of his chair, and banished from the university in October 1710. A sermon by Ockley (published in 1711) was probably aimed at Whiston, and an exculpatory letter written by him was printed by the author of a controversial pamphlet in 1712.<br>
<br>Ockley's scholarly interests soon turned from Hebrew to Arabic, and more specifically to the early history of Islam. This shift was probably due to his acquaintance with Humphrey Prideaux, dean of Norwich, who published in 1697 a widely read biography of the Prophet, tendentiously entitled <span class="italic">The True Nature of Imposture Display'd in the Life of Mahomet</span>. Ockley's move into wider fields was marked by his first publication, <span class="italic">Introductio ad linguas orientales</span>, printed at his own expense in 1706, and dedicated to Simon Patrick. In the preface to this work Ockley, like earlier advocates of the study of oriental languages, recommends them primarily as essential to the theologian. He resumed this theme in his inaugural lecture as Sir Thomas Adams's professor of Arabic, published in 1712.<br>
<br>Two other publications appeared in these years. In 1707 Ockley published a <span class="italic">History of the Present Jews throughout the World</span>, translated from an Italian work by Leon Modena, a Venetian rabbi. Of greater significance was his translation of an Arabic fictitious work by Ibn Tufayl, a twelfth-century physician in Muslim Spain. The story of Hayy ibn Yaqzan describes the life of a solitary child growing up in a state of nature on a desert island, and his gradual acquirement of the practical skills and intellectual qualities of humanity, culminating in his attainment of a natural religion. Later contact with a believer in revelation showed that both faiths were fundamentally the same. This theme was congenial to some thinkers of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. The younger Edward Pococke, a son of the first Laudian professor of Arabic at Oxford, published the Arabic text with a Latin translation in 1671, under the title <span class="italic">Philosophus autodidactus</span>. From this Latin, an English translation was made in 1674 by a Scottish Quaker, George Keith, through whom it influenced the Quaker theology of the period. Another English translation was made in 1686 by George Ashwell, an Anglican controversialist. Ockley's translation was intended as a counter-blast against such unorthodox views. He introduced his <span class="italic">Improvement of Human Reason Exhibited in the Life of Hai Ebn Yokdhan</span> (1708) with an apologia stating that he was unwilling to undertake the translation as there were already two, by Ashwell and:<blockquote>by the Quaker, who imagin'd that there was something in it that favoured their Enthusiastick Notions. However, taking it for granted, that both these Translations were not made out of the Original Arabick, but out of the Latin; I did not question but they had mistaken the Sense of the Author in many places. &hellip; I at last ventur'd to translate it a-new. (Arberry, 23)</blockquote>Not only did Ockley translate it, he also added an appendix:<blockquote>Lest otherwise, that Book, by me design'd for the Innocent, and not altogether unprofitable Diversion of the Reader, might accidentally prove a means of leading some into Error, who are not capable of judging aright; and of confirming others in their Mistakes, who &hellip; have the Misfortune to be led out of the way. (ibid.)</blockquote>At the time the Bodleian Library was incomparably the richest storehouse of oriental manuscripts in the country, and it was therefore to Oxford that Ockley went to pursue his research into Arab history. There he caught the eye of the antiquarian Thomas Hearne, who stigmatized him as &#145;somewhat crazed&#146;  (T. Hearne, <span class="italic">Remarks and Collections of Thomas Hearne</span>, ed. C. E. Doble, 1889, 3.286), but noted his indefatigable industry and high reputation as an Arabist. Hearne mentions Ockley's two short visits to Oxford, in August 1701 and again in the spring of 1706, when he was incorporated MA on 15 April and stayed until 17 May. The reading he accomplished in these two visits, each of six weeks, provided him with the materials for the volume which he published in 1708 under the title <span class="italic">The Conquest of Syria, Persia, and Aegypt by the Saracens</span>, which dealt with Islamic history under the first three caliphs (632&#150;56). In his preface he explained his reason for not commencing with the life of the Prophet: &#145;but that is already written by the Reverend and Learned Dr. Prideaux, now Dean of Norwich&#146;. Evidently Ockley, although now far more erudite than Prideaux, did not wish to compete with the popular work of his former patron. However, in the introduction to his second volume, published ten years later, he hints at its limitations as being &#145;sufficient to give a general <i>Idea</i> of the Man and his Pretensions, and admirably accomodated to his [Prideaux's] principal Design of shewing the Nature of an Imposture&#146;  (Ockley, <span class="italic">History</span>, 2.xxxv). Ockley's work on his first volume was, he believed, facilitated by his discovery of a manuscript purporting to be an account of the conquest of Syria by al-Waqidi (<i>d</i>. 823), whom, he says, &#145;I have here endeavour'd to make speak English&#146;  (Ockley, <span class="italic">Conquest</span>, xix). Unfortunately for Ockley, later research has shown that this source on which he so much relied was written in the time of the crusades.<br>
<br>In 1711 Ockley was appointed, probably through Harley's sponsorship, to the Sir Thomas Adams chair of Arabic, in which he succeeded John Luke (professor from 1685 to 1702) and Charles Wright (from 1702 to 1710), two academic nonentities. The one memorial of Luke's scholarship is indeed his erroneous assurance to Ockley concerning the great chronicler al-Tabari, that &#145;he had never met with him in the <i>East</i>, and that he was to be despaired of in Arabick&#146;  (Ockley, <span class="italic">History</span>, 2.xxxiii). Ockley had hoped to succeed Luke as professor, and his disappointment seems to have led to an estrangement from the fellows of Queens' College, as a result of which he lost preferment to a living in their gift. When he at last obtained the chair, his annual income was increased by &pound;40. The post probably entailed little teaching in view of the decay of Arabic studies in eighteenth-century universities.<br>
<br>In 1713 Ockley published an <span class="italic">Account of South-West Barbary</span>, allegedly based on the report of a Christian slave. Described by Arberry as &#145;a pot-boiler&#146;  (Arberry, 36), this book contains in an appendix Ockley's translation of two letters from the ruler of Morocco. Perhaps in consequence of this display of his competence in Arabic, Ockley was briefly employed by the government in 1714 to translate correspondence from the same ruler, Mawlay Isma&#145;il (1672&#150;1727), with whom England had commercial relations. Two of his translations, now in the Public Record Office, have been identified (Kararah, 82; Arberry, 36&#150;8). However, Harley's fall from power in July 1714 lost Ockley his most influential patron, and he had no further employment under government.<br>
<br>Ten years after the publication of <span class="italic">The Conquest of Syria</span>, Ockley produced a continuation entitled <span class="italic">The History of the Saracens</span> (1718). Again he visited Oxford, this time for a stay of five months. He drew upon a fairly wide range of sources, and identified a fragment of the chronicle of al-Tabari, of which Luke had despaired. He also made extensive use of Bartholom&eacute; d'Herbelot's <span class="italic">Biblioth&egrave;que orientale</span>, which had appeared in 1697, and which gave him access to Persian materials. Ockley speaks regretfully of his frequent attempts to perfect himself &#145;in that easy and delicate language&#146;, and of his ignorance of Turkish  (Ockley, <span class="italic">History</span>, 2.xxxii). This second volume continues the account of early Islamic history from the fourth caliph, Ali, to the Umayyad &#145;Abd al-Malik (656&#150;705). This point of termination, roughly half-way through the Umayyad caliphate, is by no means obvious or natural, but may well be explained by the growing difficulties of Ockley's daily life. The two volumes were republished in 1757 under the common title of <span class="italic">The History of the Saracens</span>, for the benefit of Ockley's daughter Anne. An anonymous &#145;Life of Mahomet&#146;, there prefixed to Ockley's own work, is ascribed by Arberry on internal evidence to his successor as Sir Thomas Adams's professor, Leonard Chappelow  (Arberry, 29).<br>
<br>Ockley's two volumes marked an important stage in the development of Arabic and Islamic studies. Earlier scholars had written in Latin for an international academic readership, but Ockley wrote in English for the instruction of his fellow countrymen, who not being, he says, &#145;sufficiently acquainted with that Nation, have entertain'd too mean an Opinion of them, looking upon them as meer Barbarians, which mistaken Notion of theirs, has hinder'd all further Enquiry concerning them&#146;  (Ockley, <span class="italic">Conquest</span>, xi). In the introduction to his second volume he gives some of the comments made on its predecessor:<blockquote>that it was the strangest Story they ever heard since they were born! They never met with such Folks in their Lives as these <i>Arabians</i>! That they never heard of this Account before, which certainly they must have done of course if any body else had! A Reverend Dignitary asked me, If when I wrote that Book I had not lately been reading the History of <i>Oliver Cromwell</i>! (Ockley, <span class="italic">History</span>, 2.xv)</blockquote>Ockley's second volume is directly linked with the last of his patrons, Thomas Freke of Hannington Hall in Wiltshire. &#145;You&#146;, he says, &#145;were pleased first to invite me to that Work; and the Publick will be indebted to You, at least, that it was done so soon, if not that it was ever done at all&#146;  (Ockley, dedication to &#145;Sentences of Ali&#146;, in <span class="italic">History</span>, vol. 2). Freke had, it appears, in the first place invited Ockley to translate a collection of Arabic proverbs ascribed to the Caliph Ali. Collections so entitled formed a standard part of the pabulum for Arabic students of the period, but Ockley's translation was a selection made from a Bodleian manuscript. Freke paid the expenses of Ockley's stay in Oxford when he was preparing to write his second volume. When and how Ockley became acquainted with Freke is not clear, although Kararah says that he &#145;took great interest in oriental and especially Arabic studies&#146;  (Kararah, 85).<br>
<br>When <span class="italic">The History of the Saracens</span> came out, Ockley was held prisoner in Cambridge Castle for a debt of &pound;200. His friends organized a collection on his behalf, to which Harley contributed &pound;20, and Freke promised &pound;40 by instalments &#145;if when your affairs are finally settled at Cambridge you will go to Oxford and translate all the sentences of Ali into English&#146;  (Arberry, 45). Ockley never fulfilled this last commission of his patron. He was released from gaol in the summer of 1718, and returned to Swavesey. He died there on 9 August 1720, and was buried in Swavesey the next day, leaving his family in destitution. His widow was also buried at Swavesey, on 2 August 1728.<br>
<br>Ockley's work, undertaken with such difficulty in adverse circumstances, has long been superseded. Yet his lasting influence was not limited to the small circle of contemporary orientalists, to whom his books were in the first place addressed. He had a part in the formation of a greater historian of a later generation, Edward Gibbon, who wrote: &#145;Simon Ockley, an original in every sense, first opened my eyes; and I was led from one book to another, till I had ranged around the whole circle of Oriental history&#146;  (E. Gibbon, <span class="italic">Autobiography, World's Classics</span>, n.d., 32).<br>
