<span class="headword">Coghlan,  Jeremiah</span>  (1774/5&#150;1844), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, was in January 1796 mate of a merchant ship at Plymouth, and on the occasion of the wreck of the East Indiaman <i>Dutton</i> displayed such energy and courage that Pellew offered to put him on the <i>Indefatigable</i>'s quarter-deck. He continued for three years in the <i>Indefatigable</i> and in March 1799 followed Pellew to the <i>Imp&eacute;tueux</i>.<br>
<br>In June 1800 Coghlan was put by Pellew in command of the cutter <i>Viper</i>, and while watching Port Louis proposed to cut out a French gun-vessel at the entrance of the harbour. Pellew lent him a ten-oared cutter, and in this, with eighteen men and a midshipman&#151;Silas Hiscutt Paddon&#151;on the night of 29 July, he boarded the gun-brig <i>Cerb&egrave;re</i> and after a hard fight captured her &#145;within pistol-shot of three batteries, surrounded by several armed craft, and not a mile from a 74 bearing an admiral's flag, and two frigates&#146;  (E. Pellew, <span class="italic">Despatch</span>). Both Coghlan and Paddon received several severe wounds, six of Coghlan's men were wounded, and one was killed; but the <i>Cerb&egrave;re</i> was taken and towed out under heavy fire from the batteries. The squadron, to mark their admiration, gave up the prize to the immediate captors; and Pellew, in his official letter to Lord St Vincent, emphasized the courage and skill &#145;which &hellip; effected so daring an enterprise&#146;  (ibid.). St Vincent, in forwarding Pellew's letter to the Admiralty, praised the achievement and in a letter to Pellew privately asked him to present to Coghlan a sword of 100 guineas' value.<br>
<br>On St Vincent's representation, Coghlan, though he had served in the navy for only four and a half years, was promoted lieutenant on 22 September 1800 and continued in command of the <i>Viper</i> until she was paid off in October 1801. In spring 1802 he was appointed to the cutter <i>Nimble</i>, and on 1 May 1804 was promoted to command the sloop <i>Renard</i> on the Jamaica station. On 20 March 1805 he brought to action the French privateer <i>G&eacute;n&eacute;ral Ernouf</i>, which, after an action of thirty-five minutes, was set on fire and blew up with the loss of upwards of a hundred men. In August 1807 Coghlan was moved into the brig <i>Elk</i> on the same station, and for nearly four years was senior officer of a light squadron for the protection of the Bahamas. He was promoted captain on 27 November 1810 but continued in the <i>Elk</i> until the following summer.<br>
<br>In September 1812 Coghlan was appointed to the <i>Caledonia</i> as flag captain of Pellew, then commander-in-chief in the Mediterranean. At the end of 1813 he exchanged into the frigate <i>Alcm&egrave;ne</i> and continued in her until the end of the Napoleonic wars. On 4 June 1815 he was nominated a CB, and from 1826 to 1830 commanded the frigate <i>Forte</i> on the South American station.<br>
<br>Coghlan married, first, a daughter of Benjamin Whitaker of Leeds, with whom he had a son and a daughter. He married, second, a daughter of Charles Hay of Jamaica, widow of Captain John Marshall RN; they had no surviving children. He died at Ryde, Isle of Wight, on 4 March 1844, aged sixty-nine, and was buried in St Thomas's Church, Ryde. His son, Sir William Marcus Coghlan (1803&#150;1885), was commissioned in the Bombay Artillery and was political resident in Aden (1854&#150;63).<br>
