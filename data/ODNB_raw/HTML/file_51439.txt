</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Bernstein,  Sidney Lewis</span>, Baron Bernstein  (1899&#150;1993), <span class="occ">businessman</span>, was born on 30 January 1899 at 14 Westbury Road, Ilford, Essex, the fourth of nine children of Alexander Bernstein (<i>c</i>.1860&#150;1922), businessman, and his wife, Jane Lazarus. His father had moved with his brother Julius from Riga, Latvia, in the early 1890s. The brothers married two sisters, whose family had come from Riga rather earlier. Alexander Bernstein was a shoemaker by trade and in due course, as Sir Denis Forman relates, &#145;set up a boot factory when he made a lucrative contract to supply boots to the Boers in South Africa &hellip; When the Boer War broke out the boot contract collapsed and he was declared a bankrupt&#146;  (Forman, 160). With the aid of his family his next venture was the manufacture of carborundum wheels. He also bought land in Edmonton. This piece of land was ideal for shops, but he thought it needed something to entice shoppers. He thought a film theatre with live entertainment seemed most likely to do so. In 1908 he built the first of the Bernstein theatres, the Edmonton Empire, and ran it like a music hall. In this way the Bernsteins became involved in the entertainment industry.<h2>
<a name="Earlyyears"></a>Early years</h2>When his father died in 1922, Bernstein's family owned a small but significant group of about twenty film theatres. Bernstein (who was educated at the Highlands board school, Ilford, and the Cooper's Company School, Bow, London) became head of this family business. He let the property and related interests go and concentrated on the film theatre business. He also loved the live theatre, and went into partnership with Arnold Bennett to put on a successful series of plays at the Court Theatre in Sloane Square. Some years later he collaborated with Bovis the builders to put up the Phoenix Theatre in Charing Cross Road, in the design of which he played the determining role. The theatre opened in 1930 with No&euml;l Coward's <span class="italic">Private Lives</span>. That went well, but the following productions were not a financial success. In the absence of plays which he considered suitable, Bernstein used the theatre to show films&#151;Ren&eacute; Clair's second talking film, <span class="italic">Le million</span>, was first shown there.<br>
<br>By 1932 Bernstein realized that the financial returns from &#145;legitimate&#146; theatre were inadequate. He therefore continued to develop his main interest, the chain of film theatres. His Granada theatres were grandiose in style. He took a close interest in their architecture, in partnership with the Russian designer Theodore Komisarjevsky. The latter had been educated at the Imperial Institute of Architecture in St Petersburg, and had gone to England in 1919. The most important of Bernstein's theatres was the Granada in Tooting. It combined Moorish, Renaissance, and classical styles. It is now a listed building and represents a lasting monument to the co-operation between Bernstein and Komisarjevsky. Bernstein's interest in film led him to join a group of film buffs in founding the Film Society in 1925, whose purpose was to show to London audiences the best films from around the world, and particularly those from Russia. This brought him into contact with some of the intellectuals who were also interested in films, including George Bernard Shaw, H. G. Wells, John Maynard Keynes, Julian Huxley, Augustus John, James Agate, Jacob Epstein, T. S. Eliot, Wyndham Lewis, and Ivor Montagu. Although he did not operate at their intellectual level, Bernstein was accepted by them, since he was charming, rich, and generous. His membership of the Film Society helped to establish his position in London's artistic community.<br>
<br>Later Bernstein also helped to promote the National Theatre. The idea of such a theatre had had its proponents since the days of David Garrick two hundred years before. Bernstein's work for the theatre brought him in touch with another congenial group of people, including Sir Bronson Albery, Sir Lewis Casson, Dame Sybil Thorndyke, and Geoffrey Whitworth. His interest in theatre design caused him after the war to be co-opted to the committee considering the logistics of the new theatre. But he came to grief over his insistence that a projection room for films and facilities for television should be provided in its design. He fell out with the then architect, Brian O'Rourke, and resigned in 1956.<br>
<br>On 26 November 1936 Bernstein married Zo&euml; Patricia Farmar (1911/12&#150;1972), journalist, daughter of Egbert Farmar, scholastics coach. There were no children of the marriage.<h2>
<a name="ThewaryearsandHollywood"></a>The war years, and Hollywood</h2>Bernstein's contribution to the war effort began in May 1940 when Winston Churchill appointed Alfred Duff Cooper as minister of information. The minister recognized the potential importance of film and appointed Bernstein as film adviser. The appointment was made against the advice of MI5, who regarded Bernstein as a security risk. Although Bernstein had a number of communist friends, there is no evidence that he himself ever was a member of the Communist Party. His only active participation in politics had been to stand as a Labour candidate for the Middlesex county council in Willesden at the end of the 1920s. He was elected and served from 1929 to 1936. Bernstein was by nature a doer rather than an adviser. His keenness to get results made him enemies as well as friends. But by the autumn of 1940 the films division was producing some of its best work, such as <span class="italic">London Can Take It</span>, intended to explain the British war effort to the American public. American broadcasters such as Quentin Reynolds and Ed Murrow recognized the importance of these films. Bernstein also acted as godfather for a number of patriotic films for home distribution, such as <span class="italic">In Which We Serve</span> (1942). In 1944 he became head of the film section of the psychological warfare division attached to Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force, and soon his work was extended to the liberated parts of Europe.<br>
<br>During the war Bernstein's brother Cecil looked after the family's theatres very competently. When the war ended there were still no building permits for more film theatres. But Bernstein needed an outlet for his energies. Hence he and his friend Alfred Hitchcock decided to form a partnership for independent film production in Hollywood. This met Bernstein's need for an entrepreneurial role with a creative side. It also suited Hitchcock's quest for creative autonomy without unreasonable commercial interference. The two of them founded the Transatlantic Picture Corporation as their joint enterprise. Their first film was <span class="italic">Rope</span> (1948), based on a play by Patrick Hamilton. This was moderately successful. <span class="italic">Under Capricorn</span> (1949) was a flop. <span class="italic">I Confess</span> (1953) was an artistic but not a commercial success. In 1951 Hitchcock and Bernstein decided to dissolve the partnership. Hitchcock continued in Hollywood; Bernstein returned to London.<br>
<br>His first marriage having ended in divorce, Bernstein married, second, on 11 December 1954, Sandra Malone (1923&#150;1991), daughter of Charles Malone, of Toronto. There were two daughters and a son of this marriage.<h2>
<a name="GranadaTelevision"></a>Granada Television</h2>&#145;We wish to become exclusive programme contractors for the Manchester&#150;Liverpool station for seven days a week&#146;  (Moorehead, 216). So wrote Bernstein to the Independent Television Authority (ITA) on 20 September 1954. The authority had invited applications for the first group of programme contractors in August of that year. But Granada had in effect been applying to enter television for years. Ever since their first inquiry in 1948 the Bernsteins had been keeping up a regular, if one-sided, correspondence with the postmaster-general's office. After the Labour defeat in 1951, Bernstein had written to Herbert Morrison:<blockquote>I think you should know that my company have applied to the Postmaster-General for a licence to operate a commercial television station or sponsored television. I still think the country would be better off without it. However, if there is to be commercial television in this country, we think we should be in. (ibid., 215)</blockquote>When the time came in the mid-1950s for Bernstein's application to be considered, his long-standing links with the Labour Party in fact caused the authority some hesitation. Some of the members feared that he might not be wholehearted in his loyalty to the system as laid down by parliament. In the event the authority decided that Granada would be run by competent people who could be relied upon to bring an enterprising television company into existence. The fact that Granada Television was a wholly owned subsidiary of Granada Theatres Ltd was not regarded as a drawback. On the contrary, the good reputation of that company gave the authority an assurance that it could rely on a well-run enterprise.<br>
<br>The way some of the independent television contractors went about the building up of the commercial channel confirmed the worst fears of critics of the introduction of the new service. By contrast Granada claimed that it would be showing items of unusual or topical interest and special programmes of intellectual or cultural value. Bernstein assured the press that there would be nothing boring. At the end of its first year Granada produced a volume of essays entitled <span class="italic">Year One</span> (1958), with an introduction by Sir Kenneth Clark, then chairman of the ITA. Clark wrote a foreword in which he admitted that he had not foreseen how much Granada would develop a character &#145;which distinguishes it most markedly from the other programme companies and the BBC&#146;  (<span class="italic">Year One</span>, 3).<br>
<br>In the meantime Bernstein had begun to establish himself and his company in Manchester. A site in Quay Street was bought in May 1955 and a self-contained centre was built. Bernstein's interest in architecture came into its own again. In the view of some of those who knew him best, Bernstein's architectural talent consisted in his attention to detail rather than an interest in a grand design. The Granada headquarters building was functional, but hardly added an architectural landmark to the Manchester street scene. Bernstein attracted an able group of younger producers and directors and put his stamp particularly on the news and current affairs output and on Granada's drama and social documentaries. He found himself in conflict with the Independent Television Authority, as much on matters of substance as on his attitude to the contractual relationship between Granada and the ITA. Most of the other programme contractors recognized that they were dependent on a public authority, and conducted their relations with the authority accordingly. Bernstein barely acknowledged the nature of the relationship. This view of the autonomy of Granada was also reflected in his attitude to its northern location. He would spend two or three days in Manchester, flying from Biggin Hill on a Tuesday. He did not think it necessary to appoint any directors who lived locally, although in later years he complied with the ITA's insistence that he should. Through the Granada Foundation and in other ways he extended carefully targeted patronage to institutions and causes in the north-west. It is a measure of the lack of confidence of the local authorities in the north-west in the 1950s and 1960s that they were very pleased with the contribution that Granada was willing to make to the regional scene.<br>
<br>It was in the field of current affairs that Bernstein's interests first clashed with the prevailing orthodoxies of broadcasting, established during the BBC monopoly. As Asa Briggs, the historian of the corporation, recounted:<blockquote>More intrepid than other broadcasting organisations, Granada deliberately broke new ground when, after consulting its lawyers, it broadcast programmes while the campaign at Rochdale [the by-election of February 1958] was in progress &hellip; two Granada producers had been dispatched to the town to talk over with local party agents provisional plans for by-election broadcasts, proposals which were leaked to the <span class="italic">News Chronicle</span> before reaching the head offices of the parties in London &hellip; The <span class="italic">New Statesman</span> claimed that it was &#145;to the credit of Granada Television that at Rochdale, it finally forced the machine men to grow up into the television age&#146;. (Briggs, 238&#150;9)</blockquote>The other area into which Bernstein steered his television company was drama. During the 1960s Granada's output was consistently better than that contributed from elsewhere on independent television. He kept a close personal eye on the company's drama output. Like Bernard Shaw, who had been the great playwright of his youth, what Bernstein looked for in a play was a social statement. But plays had also to be well constructed. Having himself little or no experience of production, he engaged producers and directors. Philip Mackie was the first. When Bernstein invited him to join Granada, Mackie wrote: &#145;I see you are offering me the post of Head of Drama&#146;. Bernstein replied, &#145;No, I'm asking you to be in charge of plays&#146;  (Moorehead, 266).<br>
<br>This correspondence illustrates Bernstein's approach to the management of Granada. His theory that you must never give people titles of any kind, or they get above themselves, contrasted markedly with the carefully structured BBC hierarchy where everyone had his or her title (and the commensurate brass plate). Bernstein regarded himself as the producer of everything the company put out; all the other staff were his assistants. This did not make for easy relations with the more independent members of the company. It originated in the personal way in which Bernstein had run his cinemas, essentially as the proprietor of a private company. He brought from Granada Theatres three assistants to Granada Television: his brother Cecil, his man of business Victor Peers, and his accountant Joe Wharton, who acted as company secretary. They were his intimates; all the rest were disposable. Even Sir Denis Forman, who soon became indispensable to Bernstein, took a long time to be accepted by this tightly knit management group.<br>
<br>The essentially personal way which Bernstein brought over from Granada Theatres also accounted for the manner in which he dealt with the financial crisis which arose in 1956. The initial losses of the company led Bernstein to make a working arrangement with Associated Rediffusion for the exchange of programmes and networking. The purpose was to protect Granada Television against heavy losses, pending the establishment of satisfactory advertising revenue. The ITA did not take cognizance of this agreement until 1959, by which time the financial crisis had been overcome. Sir Kenneth Clark and Sir Robert Fraser did not insist, as perhaps they should have done, on an independent scrutiny of the compliance of the agreement with section 5 (2) of the <span class="roman">Television Act</span> (1954). But then, as Bernard Sendall argued in his history of independent television in Britain, &#145;neither Wills (the chairman of Rediffusion) nor Bernstein were men who would with deliberation have acted in breach of the Act or of the contracts which were based on it&#146;  (Sendall, 199).<h2>
<a name="Widerfields"></a>Wider fields</h2>By the 1960s the prosperity of what had by then become the Granada Group (of which Granada Television was a subsidiary) enabled Bernstein to branch out into other fields. Cinemas were turned into bingo halls; a successful television rental enterprise was built up by Alex Bernstein, Cecil's son; motorway service stations were introduced; and an effort was made to establish the company in publishing. Granada acquired McGibbon and Kee, Rupert Hart-Davis, and one half of Jonathan Cape, as well as the Panther and Paladin paperback imprints. The music publisher Novello was another exercise in diversification. At the end of Bernstein's chairmanship television provided only 16 per cent of the group's income. Nevertheless Bernstein's heart remained in television. Although under the ITA's rules he had to retire as chairman of the Granada Television board in his early seventies, he remained chairman of the Granada Group until his eightieth birthday in 1979.<br>
<br>Bernstein was raised to the peerage, as Baron Bernstein of Leigh (a life peer), by Harold Wilson in 1969. Although he attended the House of Lords from time to time he spoke rarely. He liked to run his own show and it may be that he found the rules of the upper house too constricting. He died of cerebral arteriosclerosis on 5 February 1993, at his London home, Flat 4, 26 St James's Place, Westminster. He was survived by the three children of his second marriage, his wife, Sandra, having predeceased him in 1991.<br>
<br>Bernstein was essentially a product of the second television age, when in 1955 the BBC monopoly was replaced by the duopoly of the BBC and commercial television companies operating under the control of the Independent Television Authority. Bernstein contributed significantly to the building of independent television in the public interest, which characterized British television between 1955 and 1990. This period may well come to be seen in retrospect as television's golden age. The expansion of the technological options and the pressure for their exploitation during the Thatcher years brought this golden age to an end sooner than Bernstein would have liked.<br>
