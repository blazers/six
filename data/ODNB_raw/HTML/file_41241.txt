</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">O'Grady,  Standish James</span>  (1846&#150;1928), <span class="occ">journalist and historian</span>, was born at Castletown, Berehaven, co. Cork, on 13 September 1846, the son of Thomas O'Grady, a Church of Ireland clergyman and small landowner, and Susanna Doe, who inherited property in her own right. He was one of a family of eleven children, and he was brought up in an atmosphere of evangelical piety and classical culture. He was educated at Tipperary grammar school, and entered Trinity College, Dublin, in 1864; he graduated in 1868. He won a classical scholarship and the university silver medal in ethics and psychology, and the philosophical society's medal for essay writing; he was also a noted sportsman. He was intended for the church, and studied for his vocation for two years, but then chose the law instead. He was called to the bar in 1872 and went on the Munster circuit.<br>
<br>It was now that O'Grady began to write, for the Conservative <span class="italic">Dublin Daily Express</span> (which connection he maintained until 1898) and the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> (1873&#150;5). In 1875 he published his first book, <span class="italic">Scintilla Shelleiana</span>, under the pseudonym Arthur Clive, investigating Shelley's attitude towards religion. But his career as an influential writer began on a wet day in the west of Ireland, when, in his own words, he was twenty-four years of age (in fact, he was almost certainly twenty-seven or twenty-eight). He described in 1899 how, because of the &#145;stupid educational system of the country&#146;, he knew nothing of Irish history and legend. But in a country house on a rainy day he browsed in the library and chanced upon Sylvester O'Halloran's <span class="italic">History of Ireland</span> (1774), &#145;the finest history of Ireland into which I have ever looked&#146;. He asked himself how it was that &#145;all this interesting history of my own country&#146; was &#145;never brought before my notice by any one&#146;  (Boyd, 3). This chance encounter sent him to the Royal Irish Academy, where he read similar works; and his reading of the C&uacute; Chulainn epic inspired him to write, and publish at his own expense in 1878 and 1880, his <span class="italic">History of Ireland: Heroic Period</span>.<br>
<br>This work was, as O'Grady himself confessed, one of imagination. He knew no Irish, and did not try to learn it until 1899, and then with little success. He misspelt the name of his hero (using the form &#145;Cu Culain&#146;) and never bothered correcting his mistake; as late as 1933 this misspelling was repeated on the English title-page of a translation of <span class="italic">The Coming of Cuculain</span>, published by the Gaelic League. But the importance of the <span class="italic">History</span> lay in its impact upon leading figures of the Irish literary revival, including W. B. Yeats, T. W. Rolleston, and George Russell (AE). O'Grady's belief that Ireland had a continuous &#145;race history&#146;, and that this was centred in the imagination, the &#145;legends&#146; which nations &#145;make for themselves &hellip; that dim twilight region, where day meets night&#146;  (Brown, 525), appealed to Yeats, who included no fewer than six of O'Grady's books in a list of the &#145;thirty best Irish books&#146; in 1895. Yeats declared that it was after reading O'Grady that &#145;I turned my back on foreign themes, decided that the race was more important than the individual, and began my &#147;Wanderings of Oisin&#148;&#146;  (<span class="italic">Collected Letters</span>, 502).<br>
<br>O'Grady was torn between his imaginative history and a more scientific approach to writing about the past. In 1881 he published his <span class="italic">History of Ireland: Critical and Philosophical</span>, which was an attempt to write a more &#145;scientific&#146; history in a plain style. But he continued to defend his view that, while &#145;imagination&#146; was the cause of many errors, yet &#145;nine tenths&#146; of the errors of history arose from its being generally written by men &#145;destitute of imagination&#146; and thus tied to &#145;conventional opinions&#146;. O'Grady now developed an interest in Tudor Ireland, and published various works, including <span class="italic">Red Hugh's Captivity</span> (1889) and <span class="italic">The Bog of Stars</span> (1893), which was the second volume in the <span class="roman">New Irish Library</span>, a venture launched by Yeats and Sir Charles Gavan Duffy. But O'Grady's writings were inseparable from his political ideas, which he expounded in his <span class="italic">The Crisis in Ireland</span> (1882). O'Grady was a Conservative in politics, and he acted as honorary secretary to a landlords' meeting in Dublin in December 1881, when the landlords were embroiled in their conflict with the Land League and the followers of Charles Stewart Parnell.<br>
<br>O'Grady saw the landlords as essential to the welfare and stability of Ireland. In Tudor times the Anglo-Irish lords had looked to the crown &#145;as the lawful centre of order and authority and the fountain of honour&#146;. Chieftains remained &#145;virtually kings, each man governing his own people&#146;. Now he called on the landlords to reassert their authority, and control the &#145;wild, tameless democracy&#146;, &#145;tameless but tameable&#146;, &#145;in its heart desiring to be tamed&#146;. He feared the consequences if the &#145;lowest and most dependent class&#146; became sovereign, for it would produce leaders as &#145;the boiler sends up scum&#146;  (Boyd, 165&#150;8). O'Grady drew lessons from Lord Randolph Churchill's brand of tory democracy, and in 1886 in his <span class="italic">Toryism and the Tory Democracy</span> he set out the principles which he maintained throughout his life: the landlords of Ireland must give a firm lead, rally their tenants, and reverse their decline into degradation. Landlords must stay on their estates, hire labour, and build up loyal retainers who would both love and fear their masters.<br>
<br>This feudal relationship was the only hope for the landlord class. O'Grady saw the opportunity for this class to revive its fortunes in the controversy over the report of the Childers commission which, in 1894, admitted that Ireland had been overtaxed to the sum of &pound;250 million. This united nationalists and unionists in a common condemnation of the great abuse, and O'Grady, in his <span class="italic">All Ireland</span> (1898), urged the setting up of an Irish convention in Dublin, comprising all Irish opinions, and especially the Ulster protestants, which would convey legislative proposals to the Irish MPs in Westminster. This convention would be led by the landlords, now back in their rightful place. When nothing came of this scheme, O'Grady left Dublin and devoted his energies to the purchase and editing of a provincial Irish newspaper, the Kilkenny <span class="italic">Weekly Moderator</span>, a decision which was less eccentric than it seemed, for it was O'Grady's intention to spread his gospel in rural Ireland, and his Christmas number for 1898 contained contributions from Yeats, George Russell, Lady Gregory, and T. W. Rolleston. A series of libel suits cost him his newspaper but, indefatigable as ever, in 1900 he founded the <span class="italic">All Ireland Review</span>, which the nationalist MP William O'Brien described as a &#145;one man show&#146;, but which had a circle of subscribers ranging from landlords like Lord Dufferin to the Fenian John O'Leary.<br>
<br>This publishing venture was typical of the intellectual mood in Ireland in the early years of the new century, when Irish people of various political persuasions were exploring the possibility of reconciliation between nationalist and unionist. But O'Grady's mood was by now deeply altered. In &#145;The great enchantment&#146;, a series of editorials in the <span class="italic">All Ireland Review</span>, he contemplated the inevitable fall of the landlord class. He linked this to his studies of the heroic period: in time of crisis, a mental and spiritual debility fell over Ireland, the consequence, apparently, of some past guilt. And now the Irish gentry were &#145;rotting from the land in the most dismal farce-tragedy of all time, without one brave deed, without one brave word&#146;  (Boyd, 180). He ceased editing the <span class="italic">All Ireland Review</span> when his health broke down in 1906.<br>
<br>O'Grady's political stock was not yet exhausted. Now he developed his political thought to encompass a concern for the poor and unemployed. In the <span class="italic">All Ireland Review</span> he wrote about the problems of the urban poor and the badly paid clerks who worked in Dublin. In the <span class="italic">Irish Review</span> (April 1912) he urged the &#145;governing classes&#146; to set themselves to the task of &#145;getting our unemployed, under-fed multitudes out from these seething centres of want and discontent, out into the sane and wholesome country, and there setting them, in the first instance, to the cultivation of the good earth&#146;. He wrote for A. R. Orage's <span class="italic">New Age</span>, advocating the construction of little labour colonies, but there was an echo of his earlier beliefs in his assertion that these should be headed by enlightened aristocrats.<br>
<br>By now O'Grady's journalistic and historical career was all but over. He was awarded a civil-list pension, which helped his financial position. O'Grady enjoyed a tranquil family life. He had married Margaret, the daughter of the Revd William Fisher, and they had three sons. In 1918 he left Ireland for health reasons, settling first in France, then in the south of England, and then in Northamptonshire, where his eldest son was vicar. He lived here for some years until his son was moved on, and then went to live on the Isle of Wight. He died outside the Home of Rest at Lake on the Isle of Wight, on 18 May 1928.<br>
<br>O'Grady had a Cork accent, and was of medium height; his portrait, by John B. Yeats, reveals a more introspective person than his bubbling enthusiasm would suggest. His works were not widely read in his day, but his role in inspiring the Irish literary revival is secure. Although he wrote about pagan Ireland, his rather apocalyptic vision was inspired by his deeply rooted evangelical protestant background, and he combined this with a scepticism and a great anxiety about the future of Ireland, and of England too, under the coming rule of the &#145;mob-men&#146;. His creation of his hero C&uacute; Chulainn as the figure embodying the truly Irish spirit certainly inspired the 1916 conservative revolutionary Patrick Pearse, and it is not inappropriate that Yeats included O'Grady as one of his &#145;beautiful lofty things&#146;, recollecting O'Grady's drunken speech at a public dinner prophesying an uprising. He has been described as an Irish Carlyle, but he lacked the intellectual powers and cutting edge of Carlyle. Lady Gregory dubbed him a &#145;Fenian Unionist&#146;, which is acceptable provided it is acknowledged that his Fenianism consisted in a strong Irish patriotism, and a desire to defend Irish gentry rights even against England, rather than any inclination towards separatism. O'Grady defended the union; but his writings gained him the admiration of nationalists such as P. S. O'Hegarty (a member of Sinn F&eacute;in) and Daniel Corkery (who held the Anglo-Irish literary revivalists in contempt). It can be said of O'Grady (unlike most prominent Irishmen in his troubled times) that he had no enemies.<br>
