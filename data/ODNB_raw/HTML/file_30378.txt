<span class="headword">Algeranoff,  Harcourt</span> <span class="st"> [<em>real name </em>Harcourt Algernon Leighton Essex]</span>  (1903&#150;1967), <span class="occ">dancer and ballet master</span>, was born in London on 18 April 1903, the son of Thomas Richard Essex, a sculptor, and his wife, Alice Kendall. He was named Harcourt Algernon Leighton Essex. He dropped his original name and assumed that of Algeranoff when he joined Anna Pavlova's company in 1921. It was as though he had not only taken on a Russian stage name&#151;as was usual enough at the time when, in the world of ballet, to be British was to be nothing much whereas to be Russian was to be in the height of fashion&#151;but had largely assumed a Russian identity; Algeranoff, it seemed, became the most persistent of the many character roles in which he excelled.<br>
<br>Algeranoff studied at one time or another under the Russians Nicholas Legat and Lubov Chernicheva, but his most formative period was that of the far-ranging tours which he undertook as &#145;character soloist&#146; with Pavlova. It was then that he became interested in Indian and Japanese dance, about which he subsequently lectured. His experiences of that period, remembered with nostalgia, were eventually put into a book, <span class="italic">My Years with Pavlova</span> (1957). Algeranoff married the French dancer Claudie L&eacute;onard (<i>b</i>. 1924); they had a son, Noel, who, following in parental footsteps, became a mime. Claudie Algeranova later became ballet mistress at the Bavarian State Opera in Munich.<br>
<br>Algeranoff was a founder member of the Markova&#150;Dolin Company in 1935, joined the De Basil Ballet Russe, the company with the best claim to be the successor to the great Diaghilev ballet, in 1936, and the International Ballet, under Mona Inglesby, in 1943. It was with De Basil and the International that he chiefly made, and consolidated, his considerable reputation as a character dancer or, more specifically, as a character actor; for the roles with which he was memorably associated were those in which dancing counted for less than acting. Algeranoff learned the traditional character roles (Carabosse, Rothbart, Hilarion) from a colleague of his in the International, Nikolay Sergeyev, the one-time regisseur of the Maryinsky Ballet in St Petersburg. Sergeyev's notation of the nineteenth-century classics, which he brought with him when he left the Soviet Union, had enabled the Sadler's Wells (subsequently the Royal) Ballet to present exceptionally authentic versions of those basic works. He had then transferred his allegiance from the Sadler's Wells Ballet to the International. Among the character roles in which Algeranoff excelled were the astrologer in <span class="italic">Le coq d'or</span>, the magician Kastchei in <span class="italic">Firebird</span>, Pierrot in <span class="italic">Carnaval</span>, Dr Copp&eacute;lius in <span class="italic">Copp&eacute;lia</span>, the master of ceremonies in <span class="italic">Gaiet&eacute; Parisienne</span>, Carabosse in <span class="italic">The Sleeping Beauty</span>, and Death in Mona Inglesby's choreographic version of <span class="italic">Everyman</span>.<br>
<br>Algeranoff also conducted outstanding classes in character and national dancing at the International Ballet. However, the ballet <span class="italic">For Love or Money</span>, which he made for the company in 1951, is remembered only as indicating that, for all his stagecraft, his ability as a teacher, and his exceptional skill as a performer, he lacked the inventiveness of movement which bespeaks a true choreographer.<br>
<br>After the International Ballet ceased to exist, Algeranoff went to Australia in 1954. There he worked at first in the Australian Children's Theatre. He then became ballet master to the Borovansky Ballet (1959) and a guest artist (1962&#150;3) in the Australian Ballet, which at that time was beginning to take shape under the guidance of Peggy van Praagh. For a time Algeranoff returned to Europe, becoming director of the Norwegian State Opera and Ballet Company. But in 1959 he decided to settle in Australia, making his home in Mildura, where he opened a dance studio. In contemporary Australia there was scarcely the opportunity for Algeranoff's career to prosper conspicuously; but he was one of the pioneers whose example and influence contributed to the growth of an indigenous company in that country where ballet had been previously an intermittent import only. Algeranoff became ballet master for Australia's North Western Ballet Society.<br>
<br>Algeranoff did not belong to the native and nascent British ballet which, young though it was, sent its missionaries, such as Peggy van Praagh, to the dominions. He was one of the last of those few British dancers who made their way in a world of cosmopolitan ballet still dominated by expatriate Russians. But they too have their place in the story of the widening popularity of ballet in the mid-twentieth century.<br>
<br>Algeranoff was dapper, talented, youthfully handsome, and took himself very seriously. He played his Russian character role with zest, in public at least, and loved to tell stories about Pavlova. Algeranoff died in a road accident in Robinvale, Australia, on 7 April 1967.<br>
