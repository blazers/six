<span class="headword">Palmer <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Villiers]</span>,  Barbara</span>, countess of Castlemaine and <i>suo jure</i> duchess of Cleveland  (<em>bap. </em>1640, <em>d.</em> 1709), <span class="occ">royal mistress</span>, was baptized at St Margaret's, Westminster, on 27 November 1640, the only child of William Villiers, second Viscount Grandison (1614&#150;1643), and his wife, Mary (<i>c</i>.1623&#150;1672), daughter and coheir of Paul Bayning, first Viscount Bayning, a wealthy merchant. Grandison was one of the influential Villiers family, his father being half-brother to <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28293/', "George Villiers, first duke of Buckingham")</script>. He himself was a royalist colonel who was seriously wounded at the siege of Bristol in July 1643 and died some two months later, on 30 September 1643. His daughter later put up a monument to him in Christ Church Cathedral, Oxford. Mary Bayning was twice married again: in 1648 to Grandison's cousin, Charles Villiers, second earl of Anglesey, who died in 1661; and then to Arthur Gorges of Chelsea, Middlesex.<h2>
<a name="Earlylife16401660"></a>Early life, 1640&#150;1660</h2>Barbara Villiers was living in London when she became the mistress of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26253/', "Philip Stanhope, second earl of Chesterfield (1633&#150;1714)")</script> in 1656 or 1657. In 1657 she wrote him arch, lively letters arranging several assignations:<blockquote>My freind [Lady Ann Hamilton] and I are just now abed together a contriving how to have your company this afternoune. If you deserve this favour, you will come and seek us at Ludgate Hill, about three a clock, at Butler's shop</blockquote>and &#145;the joy I have of being with you the last night, has made me doe nothing but dream of you&#146;  (Steinman, 11&#150;13). It was an affair which she continued after marrying, on 14 April 1659, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21209/', "Roger Palmer (1634&#150;1705)")</script>, royalist and lawyer, second son of Sir James Palmer of Dorney Court, Buckinghamshire, at St Gregory by Paul, London. Palmer seems to have soon become aware of the situation as Barbara wrote again to Chesterfield after her marriage, &#145;Since I saw you, I have been at home, and I find the mounser [monsieur, Roger Palmer] in a very ill humer, for he sayes that he is resolved never to bring mee to town again and that nobody shall see me when I am in the country&#146;  (Steinman, 16). She advised Chesterfield to put off visiting her that day but the affair probably continued until January 1660 when Chesterfield, having killed a man in a duel, went to France. Little trace remains of Barbara's whereabouts immediately before the Restoration and it is unclear how or where she met <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5144/', "Charles II (1630&#150;1685)")</script>: the king acknowledged her first daughter, Anne, born on 25 February 1661, a birth date which suggests that their affair must have begun within two or three weeks of his arrival in London on 29 May 1660, but leaves open the question of whether they had in fact met before Charles's return to England.<h2>
<a name="Thekingsmistress16601670"></a>The king's mistress, 1660&#150;1670</h2>By July 1660 the Palmers were living in King Street, just across from the privy garden of Whitehall Palace, when one evening the diarist Samuel Pepys stood listening to the music he could hear from the house, an entertainment put on for the king and his brothers James, duke of York, and Henry, duke of Gloucester, by &#145;Madam Palmer&#146;. According to Pepys's information the royal brothers had &#145;a fancy to make her husband a cuckold&#146;  (Pepys, 1.199), but in fact Barbara was already the king's mistress, something Pepys certainly knew by October 1661 when Charles determined to give Barbara a title. The king instructed a grant to be prepared making Roger Palmer Baron Limerick and earl of Castlemaine with a remainder limited to his heirs male by Barbara, &#145;the reason whereof everybody knows&#146; commented Pepys  (ibid., 2.229). Barbara thus became countess of Castlemaine on 11 December 1661. She was then pregnant with her first son with the king, baptized Charles on 18 June 1662 in a ceremony attended by the king [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9629/', "Fitzroy, Charles, second duke of Cleveland and first duke of Southampton")</script>]. In July, Pepys heard that the earl of Castlemaine had had the boy baptized in a Catholic ceremony, causing a furious row with his wife, who left the house and went to her uncle Colonel Villiers at Richmond Palace. Although she soon returned, thenceforward they lived separate lives. A bond indemnifying the earl of Castlemaine for any debts, up to &pound;10,000, contracted by Barbara was signed by her uncle George Villiers, third Viscount Grandison, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13919/', "James Howard, earl of Suffolk")</script>, her uncle by marriage, in 1662 and effectively signals the couple's separation. Charles II's new queen, Catherine of Braganza, arrived in England in May 1662, and Castlemaine appeared determined to maintain her position as the king's acknowledged mistress and to gain an ascendancy over Catherine. Her proposed appointment as a lady of the bedchamber to Catherine (which had first been reported in March 1662), caused great conflict in the court, Catherine initially refusing to accept Castlemaine and the courtiers dividing over the issue. However, Charles did not waver in supporting his mistress, writing to his chancellor, the earl of Clarendon, that &#145;whosoever I finde to be my Lady Castlemaine's enemy in this matter, I do promise upon my word, to be his enemy as long as I live&#146;  (Wynne, 32). Catherine's resistance was eventually overcome and Castlemaine was victorious, being appointed along with the rest of the ladies of the bedchamber on 1 June 1663. Castlemaine often appeared at court events, sometimes taking a leading part, as at a ball held on 31 December 1662, when she appeared in the first dance partnered by the duke of Monmouth, and was placed third in line after the king and queen and the duke and duchess of York. Castlemaine also formed a mutually beneficial alliance with the court artist Sir Peter Lely: in the 1660s he painted a series of portraits of her in the guise of Magdalen, Madonna, a &#145;Sultana&#146;, and St Catherine, which allude to her relationship with the king and may be seen as part of her challenge to the queen. It was in part through Lely's many and influential portraits of her that she established her image as a great court beauty and the king's accepted mistress, and the great number of copies of Castlemaine's portraits attest to her success in this programme of self-promotion. The portraits suggest that she had dark, almost black, hair and blue eyes, confirming the description of her in Mme d'Aulnoy's <span class="italic">Memoirs of the Court of England</span>  (p. 150).<br>
<br>As early as January 1663 there were rumours that Castlemaine was having an affair with the courtier <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/14781/', "Henry Jermyn (bap. 1636, d. 1708)")</script>. However, she did not lose her position as royal mistress and indeed by May 1663 had moved into apartments in Whitehall situated over Holbein's Gatehouse, where Charles frequently dined and where courtiers sought an invitation. Castlemaine's main rival for the king's affections in the 1660s was not the queen but a maid of honour, Frances Stuart, later duchess of Richmond. Early in 1663 Charles began to show an interest in Frances: his insistence that she be allowed entry to Castlemaine's apartments when he was there caused Castlemaine to withdraw from court in July. She was soon persuaded to return, and it was reported that she &#145;commands the King as much as ever, and hath and doth what she will&#146;  (Pepys, 4.238). Her second son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9636/', "Henry Fitzroy, first duke of Grafton")</script>, was born on 20 September 1663. There may have been some doubt over his parentage as he was not at first acknowledged by the king when further titles were given to Castlemaine in 1670.<br>
<br>In December 1663 Castlemaine's conversion to Roman Catholicism was made public. Contemporaries speculated that her motives were not genuine, but some years later Lorenzo Magalotti was told that it was prompted by a fear of death brought on by a dangerous illness, and indeed Castlemaine remained a Catholic for the rest of her life. The contradictory rumours concerning Castlemaine's credit with the king continued. In February 1664 she made her presence felt at the theatre by moving from her box to go and sit between the king and the duke of York; at least one observer thought that &#145;she did it only to show the world that she is not out of favour yet as was believed&#146;  (Pepys, 5.33). Indeed, Charles dined frequently with Barbara, and in September she gave a magnificent dinner for the French ambassador and his wife, where it was remarked that Charles behaved more as a host than a guest  (Comminges to Lionne, 15 Sept 1664, TNA: PRO, PRO 31/3/113, fol. 300). Barbara's daughter Charlotte was born on 5 September 1664, and her last child with the king, a son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9633/', "George Fitzroy, duke of Northumberland")</script>, on 28 December 1665 at Oxford. Her children with the king were one of her great advantages over the childless queen: Charles was said to be &#145;mighty kind to his bastard children&#146; visiting them often in her apartments  (Pepys, 5.164). Castlemaine's favour with the king was often used on behalf of others: she influenced the appointment of her great-uncle, Henry Glenham, as bishop of St Asaph in February 1667, and in the same year Sir Robert Paston wrote to Castlemaine thanking her for interceding with the king over a grant to himself and &#145;that I must with silence and admiration consider a bounty in you beyond all things of example&#146;  (Wynne, 85). Paston's praise of Barbara may have been more than usually extravagant as it seems he owed her money for her intercession but was unable (or unwilling) to pay.<br>
<br>From 1667 Castlemaine's pre-eminence gradually diminished. Her name was again associated with Henry Jermyn in 1667, and in July that year a report circulated that she was pregnant and insisting that the king own the child &#145;or she will bring it into Whitehall gallery and dash the brains of it out before the King's face&#146;  (Pepys, 7.355). The king's refusal led to another tactical withdrawal from court by Castlemaine, whereupon Charles soon felt compelled to visit her and a reconciliation was effected; nothing more is heard of the pregnancy. On the other hand the king's attraction for Frances Stuart survived her marriage with the duke of Richmond and by the end of 1667 her imminent return to Whitehall was thought likely to cause conflict between the factions of the two women.<br>
<br>Then in January 1668 the king's affair with the actress Mary Davis was public knowledge and said to be discomforting Castlemaine. In May that year Castlemaine moved into Berkshire House, opposite St James's Palace and purchased for her by the king for &pound;4000, but she confounded expectations that she would fade into the background. In February 1668 she acted in a court production of Corneille's <span class="italic">Horace</span>, and wore some of the crown jewels, &#145;far outshining the queen&#146;  (Evelyn, 3.505). Later that year she made an appearance at the queen's birthday ball &#145;so glorious in jewells that she was the wonder of all who saw her&#146;  (newsletter, 18 Nov 1668, BL, Add. MS 36916, fol. 119). In 1668&#150;9 the king continued to make frequent visits and was especially assiduous when she fell ill in October 1669. Castlemaine had apparently made the transition from royal mistress to close friend. Her lovers were said to include the rope-dancer <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/11962/', "Jacob Hall (fl. 1662&#150;1681)")</script> about 1667, the actor <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/12473/', "Charles Hart (bap. 1625, d. 1683)")</script> the next year, the playwright <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30120/', "William Wycherley (bap. 1641, d. 1716)")</script> in 1671, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5401/', "John Churchill, later duke of Marlborough (1650&#150;1722)")</script>&#151;apparently giving the last a substantial sum of money&#151;in 1671&#150;5.<br>
<br>During the first decade of the Restoration, Castlemaine was involved in the factions which formed around the king's ministers. Those she helped into high office included Henry Bennet, earl of Arlington, and Charles Berkeley, earl of Falmouth, who were appointed secretary of state and keeper of the privy purse respectively in 1662. Berkeley paid Castlemaine money from the king's privy purse and when he was killed in 1665 in the Second Anglo-Dutch War she was anxious to promote Baptist May to the post. Although the king favoured another for the position Castlemaine used her usual tactic of withdrawing from court and eventually prevailed. On the other hand, the earls of Clarendon and Southampton, the king's lord chancellor and lord treasurer, disapproved of Castlemaine and obstructed all official grants to her. The hostility was reciprocated: on one occasion in September 1662 Castlemaine denounced Clarendon in public and hoped she would see his head on a stake outside Westminster. Her apartments came to be frequented by Clarendon's enemies and his downfall in 1667 was widely reported to have been &#145;certainly designed in my Lady Castlemaine's chamber&#146;  (Pepys, 8.404). In Bishop Burnet's assessment &#145;the mistress [Castlemaine] and the whole bedchamber were perpetually railing at him [Clarendon]. This by a sort of infection possessed the King&#146;  (<span class="italic">Burnet's History</span>, 1.369&#150;71). The king clearly resented Clarendon's hostility towards Castlemaine and on one occasion rebuked him for his wife's lack of courtesy in refusing to visit Castlemaine, whereupon Clarendon seized the opportunity to expostulate on &#145;the lady&#146; and those who courted her favour. Castlemaine did not hide her satisfaction when the end came: Clarendon wrote that as he was leaving Whitehall on 25 August he saw Castlemaine, Arlington, and Bab May looking &#145;out of her open window with great gaiety and triumph, which all people observed&#146;  (<span class="italic">Life of &hellip; Clarendon</span>, 2.304&#150;7).<br>
<br>Castlemaine had a changeable relationship with her kinsman, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28294/', "George Villiers, duke of Buckingham")</script>. In 1666 they had a falling out (of unknown motivation), which greatly displeased the king. In July 1667, however, when Buckingham was in the Tower for his behaviour during the last parliamentary session, Castlemaine was reported to have:<blockquote>so far solicited for him, that the King and she are quite fallen out; he comes not to her nor hath for some three or four days, and parted with very foul words, the King calling her a whore, and a jade. (Pepys, 8.331, 334)</blockquote>It seemed doubtful that Buckingham would be freed but, in fact, a few days later he was at liberty. Pepys speculated that Castlemaine &#145;hath at last overcome the King&#146;  (Pepys, 8.342), and it was Castlemaine who brought Buckingham to the king in her apartments where they were formally reconciled. This temporary alliance may have been prompted because both Castlemaine and Buckingham desired Clarendon's ruin. The situation altered during the course of 1668, however, when James, duke of York, returned to favour. Previously relations between Castlemaine and the duke and duchess of York had been distant but in 1666 there were rumours that Castlemaine was attempting a rapprochement with James by encouraging the affair of the duke and Margaret, Lady Denham. Certainly by April 1668 Castlemaine had joined the rush to court James, beginning by ingratiating herself with Anne, duchess of York, whom she had not seen for six months. At the same time Pepys wrote that &#145;the King and the Duke of York and Duchess and my Lady Castlemaine are now all agreed in a strict league&#146;  (Pepys, 9.153).<br>
<br>This new alliance may have contributed to Buckingham's and Castlemaine's next disagreement. Late in 1668 Castlemaine, in alliance with the duchess of York, used her influence to block an attempt by Buckingham and Lord Arlington to replace the duchess's brother, Henry Hyde, Lord Cornbury, as the queen's lord chamberlain with another man. Buckingham and Arlington consequently engaged Elizabeth, Lady Harvey, in an attempt to destroy Castlemaine's credit with the king. Lady Harvey, who was well known for her wit and involved in many court intrigues, took every opportunity to ridicule Castlemaine's conduct in the king's hearing. Castlemaine retaliated and eventually the campaign was carried to the stage in January 1669 when it appears that Castlemaine arranged for an actress to caricature Lady Harvey during a performance of Ben Jonson's <span class="italic">Cataline</span>, whereupon the actress was imprisoned but soon released by Castlemaine's influence. The episode culminated in victory for Castlemaine: Lady Harvey retired from the fray while Buckingham presented himself at Castlemaine's house and a reconciliation was effected. Castlemaine's friendship with the duke and duchess of York continued: she was seen enjoying herself at a party arranged by the royal couple in March 1669 and in May she told the French ambassador's wife that it was she who had achieved the recent reconciliation between the duke and the king. Other courtiers agreed that it was her influence. Castlemaine also found a new ally in Roger Boyle, earl of Orrery, whom she hoped would be useful against Arlington, and her feud with Buckingham soon recommenced.<br>
<br>Castlemaine was also courted by foreign ambassadors. At first she favoured the Spanish, and gave a dinner in honour of the Spanish ambassador in June 1665 in return for one given for her. However, in 1667 the intrigues of the Spanish in attempting to interest Charles in another woman turned Castlemaine towards the French, and she indicated to the French ambassador her willingness to work for the French interest. In 1669 when negotiations for an Anglo-French treaty were under way this offer was taken up, and Castlemaine began to pass information to Ambassador de Croissy concerning the attitudes of the king and his ministers, in particular denouncing Buckingham and Arlington as ill-intentioned. She and the ambassador gave dinners in honour of each other and a substantial gift was presented to Castlemaine from Louis XIV. De Croissy reported that Castlemaine was sincere in wishing to do everything in her power to contribute to the success of Anglo-French negotiations; however, in the event the French drew back from further involving her in their negotiations for fear of annoying Arlington, and how much, if anything, she knew of the secret treaty of Dover with the French is unclear. Castlemaine attended the state visit of the king's sister Henriette-Anne at Dover in 1670, when the treaty was secretly signed, a newsletter writer specifically noting the jewel worth &pound;2500 given by Castlemaine to Henriette-Anne  (newsletters, 7 May, 25 June, BL, Add. MS 36916, fols. 180, 185).<h2>
<a name="Declininginfluence16701676"></a>Declining influence, 1670&#150;1676</h2>In 1670 Castlemaine was given a series of grants by the king. In January she was granted the reversion of the office of keeper of Hampton Court, which seems to have come into her possession almost immediately. On 3 August she was created duchess of Cleveland, countess of Southampton, and Baroness Nonsuch, with remainders to her sons Charles and George (the latter being described as her second son, no mention being made of Henry). She was also granted substantial interests in land including Nonsuch Palace and its surrounding grounds of 1701 acres in July 1670. In 1673 a grant of Phoenix Park in Dublin, a place traditionally used for the benefit of the lord lieutenant of Ireland, was resisted by the then lord lieutenant, Arthur Capel, earl of Essex, who enlisted several senior courtiers on his side and eventually persuaded her to accept other lands of equivalent value. His subsequent delays in finding such lands make it uncertain whether she ever enjoyed the benefit of this grant. In addition to her palace apartments and Berkshire House (renamed Cleveland House), Castlemaine was given several substantial pensions for life by the king, usually paid to her trustees, her uncles George, Viscount Grandison, and Colonel Edward Villiers. Beginning with &pound;1000 per annum from the Post Office revenues granted in May 1667, which was increased to &pound;4700 per annum from January 1669, the pensions gradually increased until they reached, in theory, some &pound;12,000 per annum from July 1674. However, Castlemaine's declining status at court after 1670 undoubtedly affected her ability to collect her pensions and by 1684 she was owed some &pound;23,000. Such financial difficulties as this caused were, however, relieved on occasion by supplementary gifts of money.<br>
<br>The arrival in 1670 of Louise de K&eacute;roualle, duchess of Portsmouth, and her establishment as the leading royal mistress in 1671&#150;2 marked the end of Cleveland's &#145;reign&#146;, although she did not entirely lose her influence. She was present at the court masque of February 1671 and in spring that year it was reported that &#145;the great duchess of Cleveland goes about the streets with eight horses in her coach, the streets and balconies and windows full of people to admire her&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1671</i>, 271). In February 1672 there was a disturbance at court to do with Cleveland, perhaps the revelation of her pregnancy, probably to John Churchill, and the king's visits decreased. The child, Barbara, was born on 16 July 1672, and was never acknowledged by the king. However, Cleveland retained some semblance of cordial relations with the king and her children with him helped maintain her importance at court. In July 1672 Cleveland's son Henry was acknowledged, being given the title of earl of Euston and the surname Fitzroy. (Cleveland's other children also took this surname at the same time.) The title was in anticipation of the marriage of Henry and Arlington's daughter, Isabella, which took place on 1 August 1672 with much magnificence. A few days later Cleveland invited many courtiers to a dance where one of the guests was Sir Robert Southwell, who wrote that, &#145;as her grace is very obliging, so the whole company are very forward in their respects&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1672</i>, 429, 463). Cleveland's children were then granted arms signifying their royal connection: her sons in December 1672, and her first two daughters the following February.<br>
<br>Cleveland's daughter Charlotte was much sought after by courtiers and in May 1674 the successful suitor was Edward Lee, created earl of Lichfield in honour of the marriage, and a connection by marriage of the earl of Danby, whom Cleveland wished to court due to his influential position as lord treasurer. At the same time Cleveland's first daughter, Anne, was married to her relative Thomas Lennard, created earl of Sussex. The French ambassador noticed that Cleveland appeared much in favour with Charles at Newmarket in October 1672, and in September 1674 it was reported that when Cleveland had been at Oxford to arrange for the education of her son Charles, on the morning she left, &#145;she sate at least one hour in her coach that everybody might see her&#146;  (Wynne, 44&#150;5). On 10 September 1675 her eldest son, Charles, was created duke of Southampton; the following day his brother Henry was made duke of Grafton, while Cleveland's third son, George, was created earl of Northumberland on 1 October 1674, his title being elevated to duke of Northumberland on 6 April 1683.<br>
<br>Cleveland also continued to be active in managing the king's patronage. This could be for straightforward financial benefit, as in the case of Benjamin Mildmay, who was said to have paid both Cleveland and the duke of Buckingham to promote his claim to a barony. In a more complex case, in 1671 Cleveland intervened to help Thomas Wood become bishop of Lichfield in return for Wood's help in the marriage of his niece to Cleveland's eldest son. Wood was the brother of the extremely wealthy Sir Henry Wood, who died on 25 May 1671 having signed a contract arranging for the marriage of his seven-year-old daughter and sole heir, Mary, to Charles Fitzroy. Mary at first went to live with her aunt Lady Chester but before long was living with Cleveland who, when challenged, apparently returned the haughty reply that &#145;The Dutchess hath her and will keep her, and that the Dutchess wonder that so inconsiderable a person as the Lady Chester will contend with a person of her Quality&#146;  (&#145;The case of Mrs Mary Wood&#146;, BL, Harley MS 5277, fols. 22&#150;3). In the subsequent lawsuits over the marriage and control of the Wood estates it was distinctly to Cleveland's advantage to have one of that family obliged to her.<br>
<br>Another who benefited from Cleveland's patronage was Sir John Trevor, whom she employed to advise her on her land interests, and who was with her help returned as an MP in 1673. It was clear, however, that Cleveland's credit was slowly fading: by 1673 she had resigned her place in the queen's bedchamber, in 1674 she was fined for recusancy, in 1675 the duchess of Portsmouth's son was created a duke before her own sons, and then, finding herself in some financial difficulties, she decided to go to France for two years in order to economize. She left in March 1676, and did not return permanently until 1682.<h2>
<a name="Parisianintrigues16781682"></a>Parisian intrigues, 1678&#150;1682</h2>Cleveland took her daughters with her to be educated in the English convent of the Order of the Conception in Paris, to which she donated &pound;1000 for new buildings. In 1678 she made a brief but dramatic re-entry into court politics, two long letters by her to the king giving an unusual insight into her life at this time. In France she had established an amicable relationship with the English ambassador there, Ralph Montagu (1638?&#150;1709), later duke of Montagu, and may even have had an affair with him. She also apparently had an affair with Alexis-Henri de Ch&acirc;tillon (1652 <span class="smallcap">NS</span> &#150; 1737 <span class="smallcap">NS</span>) which Montagu betrayed to the king, intercepting some of her love letters and sending them to Charles. Moreover while Cleveland was visiting England in April&#150;June 1678, Montagu evidently began an affair with her daughter Lady Sussex. Cleveland became aware of this double betrayal and some days after her return to Paris she wrote a letter to Charles which exposed the ambassador to certain ruin. Without actually admitting an affair with Ch&acirc;tillon, she wrote:<blockquote>Now all I have to say for myself is that you know, as to love, one is not mistress of one's self, and that you ought not to be offended with me, since all things of this nature is at an end with you and I; so that I could do you no prejudice.</blockquote>She then launched into details of Montagu's conversations with her when he had<blockquote>several times told me that in his heart he despised you and your brother; and that for his part he wished with all his heart that the Parliament would send you both to travel; for you were a dull governable fool and the Duke a wilful fool.</blockquote>She reported that Montagu planned to ensnare the king with a certain fortune-teller whom he would control and in whom, he claimed, Charles set great store. Montagu was confident he could soon rise to be lord treasurer and had said, &#145;and for the King, I will find a way to furnish him so easily with money for his pocket and his wenches that we will quickly out Bab May and lead the King by the nose&#146;. Cleveland had turned down the invitation to join with Montagu in ruining the current lord treasurer and the duchess of Portsmouth, and told him, &#145;the Devil was not more designing than he was&#146;. Cleveland swore to the king that this was all true and that she was not motivated to write by malice, indeed, &#145;I would not have been so base as to have informed against him for what he said before me had he not provoked me to it&#146;. She begged for the king's commands on the situation with their daughter and after yet more revelations of Montagu's appalling behaviour, promised that her conduct would be &#145;such as that you nor nobody shall have occasion to blame me&#146;, while also reminding Charles that the last time he had seen her, he had said, &#145;Madam, all that I ask of you &hellip; is live so for the future as to make the least noise you can, and I care not who you love&#146;. Charles's reply to this letter was evidently all that Cleveland hoped for, but she was forced to tell him that his commands had had little effect on Lady Sussex, who was still being manipulated by the shameless Montagu  (Andrews, 201&#150;6). The result was that Montagu, afraid of what Cleveland might have revealed, returned to England without leave and attempted to see the king but Cleveland having &#145;done his errand&#146;, Charles cut off his explanations, removed him from his posts and banished him from court  (<span class="italic">Ormonde MSS</span>, new ser., 4.441).<br>
<br>Both her finances and her religion kept Cleveland in France, proclamations against Catholics during the Popish Plot crisis giving rise to fears that she would be prevented from going near Whitehall and indeed would be pressured to reconvert to protestantism. Evidently Cleveland received reassurances that she would be protected as she did in fact make another visit to England in 1679 for some four months, undoubtedly to request some money, but also to try and break off the match between her son Henry and Isabella Bennet in favour of a match with the heiress Elizabeth Percy, countess of Northumberland, and to ask for a promise of her aunt's place as first lady of the bedchamber and groomess of the stole, the last two projects being unsuccessful.<h2>
<a name="Decliningyears16821709"></a>Declining years, 1682&#150;1709</h2>After returning to England in 1682 Cleveland was little regarded by the court in the face of Portsmouth's ascendancy, and it was reported that the king delayed for some time in seeing her. About 1684 she began an affair with the actor <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/10974/', "Cardell Goodman (b. 1653)")</script>, but, in what may have been a conspiracy by Cleveland's sons to remove him from her presence, he was convicted of conspiring to poison the dukes of Grafton and Northumberland and fined &pound;1000 in September 1684. Cleveland however, continued to see Goodman for some time: it was rumoured that she had a son by him in 1686 (although this cannot be confirmed as nothing more is heard of the child), and he witnessed a deed involving some of her property in 1687. Their affair probably finished about 1690 and had certainly ended by 1696 when he was exposed as a Jacobite conspirator and went into exile. Little more is heard of Cleveland until 25 November 1705 when <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9250/', "Robert, or Beau, Feilding (1650/51&#150;1712)")</script>, a former army captain, involved her in a bigamous marriage. Feilding had recently married one Mary Wadsworth thinking she was a rich widow named Mrs Deleau. Unaware that he had been tricked he went on to marry the duchess of Cleveland who was then living in Bond Street. Living with her was her granddaughter Charlotte Calvert (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Lee) who had taken refuge from an unhappy marriage, and who soon began an affair with Feilding and consequently moved out of Cleveland's house in March 1706. The bigamy was eventually discovered in June 1706 when Mary Wadsworth and her accomplice Mrs Villars went to Cleveland and told her the story. On being confronted Feilding attacked the duchess and threatened her with a gun until she managed to call for help out of a window, whereupon the watch arrived and Feilding was arrested. Cleveland exacted revenge by suing Feilding for adultery at the Old Bailey where she had his obscene love letters to Mary Wadsworth read out in court and subsequently published. The marriage was annulled in May 1707. Cleveland lived her last years in Chiswick and died there of a dropsy on 9 October 1709; she was buried in Chiswick parish church four days later. Her will, written on 11 August 1709 and proved the day after her death, constituted her grandson Charles, duke of Grafton, as her principal heir and sole executor.<br>
<br>As the first acknowledged royal mistress in Britain for some centuries, Cleveland's potential influence over the king was of prime concern to Restoration courtiers, and her great beauty, forceful personality, and genius for self-promotion made her both admired and feared. Contemporary comment concentrated on condemning her flagrant affairs and extravagant expenditure: in Bishop Burnet's disapproving opinion she was a &#145;woman of great beauty but most enormously vicious and ravenous; foolish but imperious&#146;  (<span class="italic">Burnet's History</span>, 1.132), while another observer wrote, &#145;the prodigious amount of money dissipated by this woman, who has no moderation or limit in her desires, passes all bounds and exceeds all belief&#146;  (<span class="italic">Lorenzo Magalotti</span>, 72). The author Mary Delariviere Manley, who had lived with Cleveland for a short time in the 1690s, characterized her in a scandal novel, <span class="italic">The New Atalantis</span>, as &#145;querilous, fierce, loquacious, excessively fond, or infamously rude &hellip; The extreames of prodigality and covetousness; of love and hatred; of dotage and aversion were joyn'd together in Hilaria's [Cleveland's] soul&#146;  (Steinman, 192). Indeed, Cleveland's relationship with Charles II often threatened to dissolve under the strain of their respective infidelities, yet she maintained her position for some ten years, in the process establishing the position of royal mistress as one of political significance and acquiring great wealth and high honours for her children.<br>
