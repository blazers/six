<span class="headword">O'Callaghan, Sir  Francis Langford</span>  (1839&#150;1909), <span class="occ">civil engineer</span>, was born on 22 July 1839, the second son of James O'Callaghan JP, of Drisheen, co. Cork, and his wife, Agnes, daughter of the Revd Francis Langford. He was educated at private schools and at Queen's College, Cork. From 1859 to 1862 he received training in applied engineering while employed under Henry Conybeare on railway construction in Ireland and south Wales. Success in a competition for a position in the public works department of India led to his appointment as a probationary assistant engineer on 13 June 1862.<br>
<br>By promotion, often temporary well before the confirmed advance, O'Callaghan rose through the various grades of the department: he achieved the permanent positions of executive engineer fourth class in April 1866 (first class, March 1871), superintending engineer third class in January 1880 (first class, March 1886), and chief engineer third class in April 1889. In May 1889 he was promoted to chief engineer first class and appointed consulting engineer to the government of India for state railways. In August 1892 he became secretary to the government of India, public works department. Posted from 1862 to 1870 to the Northern road and related bridge works (Kanhan Bridge, 1866), in the Central Provinces, O'Callaghan began his association with the state railways when he joined the Nagpur and Raipur railway survey in February 1871. A posting to the Wardha valley railway works (1872) followed, then a furlough, during which time he married, on 22 September 1875 Anna Maria Mary (<i>d</i>. 1911), second daughter of Lieutenant-Colonel Henry Clarinbold Powell of Banlahan, co. Cork. From 1877 to 1879 he was chief engineer of the Tirhut state railway. He next served with great success as engineer-in-chief for a number of demanding railway projects, surveys, and constructions on India's north-west frontier: the Rawalpindi&#150;Peshawar section of the Punjab Northern (1879&#150;83); Sind&#150;Sagar surveys (1884&#150;5); the Bolan line through the Bolan Pass to Quetta (1885&#150;6); the Khwaja&#150;Amran (1887); and the Sind&#150;Pishin railway (1887&#150;9). Repeatedly commended by government he was made CIE (1883) for his work on the Attock Bridge over the Indus and CSI (1888) for the line through the Bolan Pass.<br>
<br>O'Callaghan's technical skills were complemented by his popularity, tact, and sound judgement. He retired from India service in 1894 and returned to England where the Colonial Office appointed him in September 1895 to the demanding position of managing member of the Uganda Railway committee, a position he held until the committee was dissolved on 30 September 1903 and for which he was made KCMG in 1902. During the often controversial construction of that line O'Callaghan had to respond to criticism, to provide testimony to parliamentary investigations, and to make trips of inquiry to east Africa. He also served as a company director of the Burma Railway and the Egyptian Delta Light Railways.<br>
<br>Elected an associate of the Institution of Civil Engineers on 12 January 1869 and a full member on 23 April 1872 O'Callaghan was also a fellow of the Royal Geographical Society. He published in 1865 an adaptation of <span class="italic">Bidder's Earthwork Tables</span> for use in India. O'Callaghan died suddenly at Redbraes, London Road, Guildford, on 14 November 1909. He was Anglican by faith, and his funeral and burial took place a few days later at Holy Trinity Church, Guildford. He was briefly survived both by his wife and their only son, Captain Francis Reginald Powell O'Callaghan RE (1880&#150;1910).<br>
