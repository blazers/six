<span class="headword">Sopwith,  Thomas</span>  (1803&#150;1879), <span class="occ">surveyor and civil engineer</span>, was born on 3 January 1803 in Pilgrim Street, Newcastle upon Tyne, possibly the only son of Jacob Sopwith (1770&#150;1829), builder and cabinet-maker, and his wife, Isabella, daughter of Matthew Lowes. Sopwith developed early aptitudes for writing, drawing, and the cataloguing of minerals. He was educated privately, but briefly, on Tyneside, before being apprenticed to his father as a cabinet-maker.<br>
<br>In 1822 Sopwith commenced a diary (which he continued until his death), designed a new gaol for Newcastle, for which he was awarded 10 guineas, and was admitted a free burgess of the corporation of Newcastle. Despite his training as a cabinet-maker, Sopwith was determined to become a land surveyor; accordingly, as soon as his apprenticeship was completed, he joined Joseph Dickinson of Alston in his survey of the Greenwich Hospital's Alston Moor mines, and soon went into partnership with him. By 1824 or 1825, while he was still based at Alston, Sopwith had already undertaken surveys for the Newcastle and Carlisle Railway and the corporation of Newcastle; he also learned to play the organ. In 1826 his <span class="italic">Account of All Saints Church [Newcastle]</span> was published. On 2 September 1828 he married Mary Dickenson of Alston, daughter of a principal agent to the Greenwich Hospital; their only child, Jacob, was born on 24 July 1829. Mary died seven days later, and Sopwith's father died in October of the same year. Although concentrating on surveying, Sopwith and his cousin, John Sopwith, continued the cabinet-making business. This was not just out of filial piety, as Sopwith was particularly proud of his &#145;monocleid writing cabinet&#146; design with its central locking system.<br>
<br>Sopwith returned to Newcastle in 1830 and surveyed a new line for the Ponteland turnpike. On 1 February in the following year he married Jane Scott (<i>c</i>.1807&#150;1855) of Ross, Northumberland; they had three sons and four daughters. In 1832 Sopwith was elected to the Institution of Civil Engineers and took an office in the newly opened Royal Arcade, Newcastle, embarking on a busy life as a consulting surveyor. He published his <span class="italic">Account of Alston Moor</span> in 1833, and his <span class="italic">Treatise on Isometric Drawing</span> in 1834, the latter following systematic study over two years. He was also to publish about eighteen articles. He undertook many commissions in the years 1832&#150;45, including street improvements in the city of Newcastle, surveys of the minerals in the Forest of Dean (leading to his appointment as crown commissioner for the forest), and work on several railways in England and on the Sambre and Meuse Railway in Belgium. Through all these activities he came to know, and sometimes to work with, engineers such as George and Robert Stephenson, Isambard Kingdom Brunel, William Cubitt, and W. G. Armstrong; and among his friends he included Decimus Burton, Charles Landseer, Charles Barry, Rowland Hill, and professors Sedgwick and Faraday.<br>
<br>At the 1838 British Association meeting in Newcastle, Sopwith argued for the necessity of preserving mining records. In 1845 he was elected fellow of the Royal Society and became chief agent to the W. B. [Lead] Company centred at Allenheads, whereupon he agreed to give up all other professional interests except that of commissioner for woods and forests. He accepted this radical change because the post at Allenheads offered him an important job for the rest of his life, with the provision of comfort in old age. It would also take him back to an area he had come to love, and it would enable him to make Allenheads his main family home. However, he continued to keep a house in Newcastle, and one in London from about 1845. As agent at Allenheads, Sopwith developed the mines; built schools, libraries, and chapels; improved cottages; and encouraged mutual improvement and benefit societies for the workers and their families. He introduced a system of mine surveying and plan production of considerable intricacy, producing some of the earliest detailed mine plans. The limitations of two-dimensional plans, even when drawn isometrically, led him to develop highly regarded three-dimensional geological models in wood, which were constructed in the cabinet-making works. His only setback, in an otherwise successful professional life, came with the Allenheads strike in 1849, when he insisted on enforcing time clauses in miners' bargains. Some miners, led by local Primitive Methodists, refused to accept these bargains and a strike ensued. It was a time of labour surplus, and while the miners hoped for concessions he made none. Described by a friend as the very soul of order and of exactitude, he was in fact obsessive about punctuality. The strike collapsed after four months, and thereafter work was denied to many: some sixty men, women, and children left the dale on one day in May to seek work in America.<br>
<br>Sopwith was not vindictive after the strike and helped various Methodist societies, for example; but he remained uneasy about the strike even in his last years. Although not active in politics, he supported universal suffrage and annual elections, and welcomed the entry of working-class MPs into the Commons, believing that they would lead to an extension of liberal views or a new political party. He was able, no doubt, to express such views both among his influential friends and within some of the twenty-six learned societies to which he belonged.<br>
<br>A dispute with the owner of the Allenheads company, W. B. Beaumont, caused Sopwith to offer his resignation in 1857 (the year in which the University of Durham awarded him an honorary MA), though this was not accepted. He was subsequently allowed to undertake the management from London and returned to Allenheads in 1860. His third marriage, to Anne, daughter of Addison Longhorne Potter of Heaton Hall, took place on 29 September 1858. Sopwith finally retired from his position, and all professional life, in 1871. He died from heart disease at his house, 103 Victoria Street, London, on 16 January 1879, and was buried at Norwood cemetery. His third wife survived him. One of his grandsons was the pioneering aviation engineer <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/40056/', "Sir Thomas Sopwith (1888&#150;1989)")</script>.<br>
