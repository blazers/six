<span class="headword">Sturge,  Emily</span>  (1847&#150;1892), <span class="occ">campaigner for women's education and suffrage</span>, was born on 20 April 1847 at Highbury Villa, Cotham New Road, Cotham, Bristol, the eldest of the eleven children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/50170/', "William Sturge (1820&#150;1905)")</script> and his wife, Charlotte Allen Sturge (1817&#150;1891). Four of her sisters were also involved to a greater and lesser extent in the movement for women's education. The Sturge family were prominent members of the Society of Friends and were linked by marriage and descent to a number of Quaker families. Emily was a great-niece of the Quaker Ann(e) Knight who had campaigned for women's right to vote in the 1840s, and in the memoir of Emily (1892) Charlotte Sturge wrote that Ann Knight &#145;would have rejoiced to see how far her desires have been fulfilled and will probably be yet further carried out&#146;  (Goodbody, 50).<br>
<br>William Sturge was a partner in the family business of surveying which prospered in the nineteenth century. In 1864 the family moved into Chilliswood (later part of the University of Bristol) in Cotham, and the third daughter, Elizabeth, lived there until her death in 1944 at the age of ninety-four. The house was a centre for visiting lecturers and for drawing-room meetings during the suffrage campaigns of the 1870s. Emily was described by her Aunt Matilda as &#145;shy and sensitive in infancy&#146;  (E. Sturge, 79), and this developed into a deep reserve which gave the impression of aloofness. She was also &#145;a woman of considerable personal attractions, a little above the middle height, with good features, a fine bearing, and magnificent hair, which gave a certain distinction to her appearance&#146;  (ibid., 84). In early life she broke away from the evangelicalism of her upbringing, and experienced periods of religious doubt, though she continued to attend Friends' meetings all her life. Her sister Elizabeth said that &#145;we&#151;her sisters&#151;hardly knew how much strong feeling her rather cold and distant manner covered until, after her death, her private memoranda revealed it&#146;  (ibid., 79). In one of these memoranda Emily wonders<blockquote>how it is that I come to be where I am&#151;how it has come about that I am absorbed in the practical work of life. If the line of least resistance had not lain in this direction I could have lived the student's life. (Goodbody, 44)</blockquote>After attending schools at Weston-super-Mare and then Frenchay, near Bristol, Emily's own education was cut short at the age of about fourteen, and thereafter she was largely self-taught. In contemplating the life of a student Emily may have been envying her younger sisters Mary Charlotte, known as Carta (1852&#150;1929), and Caroline (1861&#150;1922), who attended the University College which opened at Bristol in 1876. Carta went on to study at Newnham College, Cambridge, gaining the moral science tripos in 1887, and Caroline qualified as a doctor at London University. One of Emily's brothers, William Allen Sturge (1850&#150;1919), was also medically qualified and married to Dr Emily Bovell, one of the seven female medical students expelled from Edinburgh University during the Sophie Jex-Blake struggle for women's access to medical training in the early 1870s.<br>
<br>The &#145;practical work&#146; of Emily Sturge's brief life was almost wholly concerned with promoting women's suffrage and women's education. From 1878 until her death she was honorary secretary of the west of England branch of the National Society for Women's Suffrage. The West of England Suffrage Society had been formed in Bristol in 1868 at the home of Matthew Davenport Hill, whose daughter Florence was a founding member. Emily Sturge was a member by 1872&#150;3, and from the 1870s until about 1885 she was involved in travelling to public meetings, giving public speeches, and campaigning through the Liberal Party to obtain women's franchise by electoral reform. She was a member of the Bristol Women's Liberal Association, formed about 1880 alongside similar branches formed in other Quaker strongholds, whereby parliamentary and municipal candidates were asked to state their views of women's suffrage. Women were not enfranchised by Gladstone's 1884&#150;5 reforms and Emily Sturge moved across to support the Liberal Unionists in the home rule split. She was a member of the committee of the West Bristol Temperance Society.<br>
<br>Emily Sturge was elected as a Liberal to the Bristol school board in January 1880. School boards were the first form of elected body open to women, and Emily succeeded Helena Richardson as the second woman member, having come second in the poll at the age of thirty-two. She had experience of teaching in a Friends' Sunday school, and took an interest in an elementary school for girls run by the British and Foreign School Society. During her membership of the board she campaigned for free school meals, established as &#145;penny dinners&#146; in 1884; was involved in the setting up of evening schools, chairing the evening school committee from 1886; and was concerned to ensure equal access for women and girls to technical instruction and to promote the training and status of women teachers.<br>
<br>Emily Sturge achieved the latter aim through the new University College, founded in 1876. The college was a direct result of the Clifton Association for Promoting Higher Education for Women, formed in Bristol in 1868. The association founded the <span class="roman">Lectures for Ladies</span> in the 1860s, which were attended by the Sturge sisters and are described by Elizabeth Sturge in her <span class="italic">Reminiscences</span> (1928). The new University College, to become the University of Bristol in 1909, was open to both men and women, except for the medical school. In its early years money was a problem and Emily Sturge organized a successful fund-raising campaign in the late 1880s. She helped to establish a day training school for women teachers at the University College, which opened in October 1892: Marion Pease, a graduate of the new University College and a member of another key Bristol Quaker family, the Frys, was appointed the first mistress of method.<br>
<br>Emily Sturge was also involved in setting up at Bristol a school of cookery to train domestic science teachers, using moneys set aside by the technical instruction committee of the town council, and derived from the <span class="roman">Technical Instruction Act</span> of 1889 and the <span class="roman">Local Taxation (Customs and Excise) Act</span> of 1890. Unlike the school boards, town councils were still restricted to men, and following receipt of a memorial from &#145;certain ladies&#146; in October 1891, Emily Sturge, who wanted grants for technical education to benefit girls as well as boys, was invited to assist with the formation of the school of cookery. It was to open in September 1893. Emily Sturge was re-elected to the Bristol school board in January 1892 shortly before her death at her home, Chilliswood, Tyndall's Park, Cotham, Bristol, on 3 June 1892, from injuries sustained after being thrown from her horse. She was buried in the Quaker burial-ground at Friars Meeting-House, Rosemary Street, Bristol.<br>
