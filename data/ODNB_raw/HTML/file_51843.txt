<span class="headword">Downes,  Ralph William</span>  (1904&#150;1993), <span class="occ">organist</span>, was born on 16 August 1904 at 61 Arthur Street, Derby, the only child of James William Downes (1873&#150;1954) and his wife, Constance Edith, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Platt (1876&#150;1922). He was educated at Derby municipal secondary school, which he left at &#145;exactly 16&#146;  (Downes, 19). Compulsively drawn to the organ from about the age of nine, he became thoroughly soaked in the sounds of the Derby instruments over his remaining years at school. He was for a time deputy organist of All Saints' Church (later the cathedral), and made his first acquaintance with the Mustel harmonium in a local cinema. Faced with the necessity of finding a job he played the organ, first in cinemas in Nottingham, and then, back in Derby, as &#145;star performer&#146; on the Mustel in 1922. From the autumn of that year he studied at the Royal College of Music, London, taught by Walter Alcock, Henry Ley, and Edgar Cook; he was Cook's assistant at Southwark Cathedral from 1923 to 1925, at which point he went to Oxford as organ scholar of Keble College. He was active in the University Musical Club, becoming president in 1927, and directed the orchestral ensemble for several Keble summer plays, some of the music being composed or transcribed by him. Jack Westrup, his contemporary and later professor of music in the university, played trombone in the orchestra; he once described Downes as appearing &#145;almost dashing&#146; at this time  (personal knowledge).<br>
<br>On leaving Oxford in 1928 Downes departed in August for Princeton University where he became the first organist and director of music of the new Gothic chapel; this appointment came about after an interview in England. In 1929 he married Agnes Mary Rix (1889&#150;1980), daughter of John Joseph Helsdon Rix, an English schoolteacher settled in the Netherlands, where she herself was private secretary to the US envoy. They had one son, the art historian Professor Kerry Downes (<i>b</i>. 1930). Downes remained at Princeton until 1935, becoming also a lecturer in the music department, which was started in 1934. His experience of Princeton was not all he hoped, as the organ, which had an excellent specification, was badly balanced, the imposing-looking chapel contained large amounts of acoustic tiling disguised as stonework, and the academic level of undergraduate students in music was not up to the standard that he expected. As he later recounted, he tried to improve the organ at various times and learned much from American organ builders, principally Donald Harrison of the Aeolian-Skinner company.<br>
<br>Downes converted to Roman Catholicism in 1930 and, at the beginning of 1936, became organist of Brompton Oratory, London, retaining this post until 1978 when he became organist emeritus. He did not have responsibility for the choir, but provided accompaniments on the organ to all the church music. In 1937 he was able to obtain a Mustel harmonium for the oratory, and in the same year visited Paris, where particularly the great Cavaill&eacute;-Coll organs made a revelatory impression on him. It was in his first years at Brompton Oratory, and those immediately after the Second World War, that Downes was probably at his finest as an organist. He performed the major works of Reger, Hindemith's organ sonatas, and Schoenberg's <span class="italic">Variations on a Recitative</span>, as well as countless other modern works largely neglected by the general run of organists; many of these were played in recitals for the Organ Music Society, and he was a frequent broadcasting recitalist for the BBC. Although he played Messiaen's organ compositions he seemed to be not over-enthusiastic about them&#151;&#145;bad music&#146; was one description. One particular association was with the Aldeburgh Festival, in which he took part (almost without a break) from its beginning in 1948 until 1985.<br>
<br>Downes is most widely perceived as having been the guiding light in transforming people's attitudes to the organ in mid-twentieth-century Britain. He did this most decisively in the design for the organ in the Royal Festival Hall, London, on which he worked from 1948. As newly appointed organist of the London Philharmonic Orchestra, intended to be the resident orchestra of the as yet unbuilt hall, Downes was the natural choice to be designer of the organ; and while this may have seemed to the London county council (LCC) harmless enough, in a very short time the project became extremely contentious, with damaging interventions from the LCC's musical advisers and other influential persons. In the end Downes's quiet persistence persuaded a distinctly uneasy LCC, in May 1950, that the planned scheme should go ahead.<br>
<br>For Downes life was something of a balancing act, with home life, church (there were many demands at the oratory in addition to Sunday services), performing both as soloist and in concerted music, organ building and maintenance, teaching, examining, and adjudicating. As an interpreter, he had metamorphosed from the youth who had &#145;got the bug&#146; into a discriminating musician by his early twenties; he gave entertaining accounts of some of his adventures in <span class="italic">Baroque Tricks</span> (1983). My own experience comes to mind when, as a brash former national serviceman, I said to him at a lesson that taking a rarefied view was all very well, but what would Bach do if he had our conditions. &#145;Ah&#146;, he replied, quietly and tellingly as always, &#145;you are taking a subjective view, while I am trying to be objective&#146;. When, on a much later occasion, we were having a conversation about teaching, he remarked that he had never felt himself particularly suited to it because many of the practical elements of organ playing had come to him naturally, and he could not readily explain them to a student who found things difficult.<br>
<br>Downes was, in his son's description, a romantic, one who was forever seeking the ideal means of expression, in one instrument, of styles which could be strange bedfellows. He repeatedly claimed, before it was built, that the Royal Festival Hall organ was to be an all-purpose instrument, yet the reeds were given twentieth-century French voicing (by Louis-Eug&egrave;ne Rochesson) which made their use perilous, particularly in such a location. He was strongly influenced by the American reform movement of the 1930s, which was wedded to electric actions for many years to come, and indeed the principal instruments with whose construction he was associated (at the Royal Festival Hall, Buckfast Abbey, Brompton Oratory, Paisley Abbey, and St Albans and Gloucester cathedrals) had electric rather than mechanical action to their keyboards. The great leap, for him, to mechanical action came with the design for the organ in St David's Hall, Cardiff, which was completed in 1982.<br>
<br>Downes was appointed CBE in 1969 and a knight of the order of St Gregory the Great (an honour conferred by the pope) in 1970. He died of pneumonia in London on 24 December 1993 and was buried in Kensington borough cemetery, London, on 7 or 8 January 1994. He was survived by his son. A solemn mass for him was celebrated at Brompton Oratory on 10 May 1994.<br>
