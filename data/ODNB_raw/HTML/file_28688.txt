<span class="headword">Ward,  James Clifton</span>  (1843&#150;1880), <span class="occ">geologist</span>, was born at Clapham Common, Surrey, on 13 April 1843, son of James Ward, schoolmaster, and his wife, Mary Ann (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Morris). After schooling at Hastings, Ward entered the Royal School of Mines in 1861 and gained the Edward Forbes medal in 1864. In 1865 he was appointed to the geological survey and worked for three years in the West Riding. In 1869 Ward was transferred to the Lake District where he worked for eight years, notably in the Keswick district. His important <span class="italic">Geology of the Northern Part of the Lake District</span> was published in 1876. On 11 January 1877 he married Elizabeth Ann Benson, daughter of Cockermouth solicitor Robert Benson. In 1878 he was ordained, and became assistant curate at St John's, Keswick.<br>
<br>Ward was one of the first survey geologists to deploy Henry Sorby's method of examining rock sections with a microscope, and applied it to the Lakeland lavas and ash beds. He adopted Andrew Ramsay's views on the glacial origins of lake basins and wrote several papers on glacial theory and glacial phenomena, giving support to the &#145;glacial submergence&#146; theory.<br>
<br>Studying the Skiddaw Slates of northern Lakeland, Ward regarded them as rather gently folded with a thickness of about 12,000 feet. He examined the metamorphic aureole round the underlying Skiddaw Granite and figured this prominently in the survey's published sections. He sought to establish the depth and pressure under which the granite had formed, linking the stratigraphic evidence to that provided by microscopic examination of the liquid cavities of the granite's quartz crystals. The Slates were correlated with the Arenig (then regarded as Cambrian) rocks of north Wales, and the slates of the Isle of Man, both places where Ward worked for a time. Considering estimated rates of erosion, he suggested that the time elapsed since the Skiddaw Slates period was about 62 million years, in keeping with estimates of geological time favoured in his day. Ward contemplated the idea that granites might be of metamorphic origin, being associated with water in their formation.<br>
<br>Ward also worked on the difficult problems and terrain of what are now called the Borrowdale Volcanics, subdividing them into nine units, assigning the lower ones to the &#145;Cambrian&#146;, again by correlation with Welsh formations. He supposed that the central Lakeland massif had existed since the Palaeozoic era.<br>
<br>Ward was important in Lakeland intellectual life, helping to establish the Cumberland Association for the Advancement of Literature and Science and lecturing in the Keswick district. He collected information on archaeological sites in the region and displayed this, as well as the results of his geological researches, in maps and models in the Keswick Museum.<br>
<br>By all accounts, Ward was a man of most attractive character, cultured, a nature lover, serious-minded, and deeply religious. His field notes contain poems indicative of his romantic temperament and religious zeal. In 1880 he was appointed perpetual curate at Rydal, Westmorland, but taken ill with a chill he died on 16 April that year, survived by his wife and two daughters. He was only thirty-seven. He was buried in the churchyard of St John's, Keswick, on 20 April 1880.<br>
