<span class="headword">Mario,  Jessie Jane Meriton  White</span>  (1832&#150;1906), <span class="occ">advocate of Italian unity</span>, was born on 9 May 1832, probably at 15 Chapel Row, Forton, Gosport, Hampshire, daughter of Thomas White (<i>c</i>.1800&#150;1863) and his second wife, Jane Teage, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Meriton (1805&#150;1834). Her mother, related to a liberal New Orleans family, showed more enthusiasm for the local Pestalozzian school than for the High Street Independent Chapel where Thomas White was a zealous worshipper. She died, however, when Jessie was only two, and was instantly replaced by the schoolteacher, White's third wife, Jane Gain (1813&#150;1866). Jessie White grew up beside Forton inlet among numerous variously mothered siblings.<br>
<br>Thomas White came from a family of shipwrights and wrote a treatise on their profession (1848), but his speciality was designing loading slips and installing them abroad. Despite his narrow righteousness he had a social conscience, and was versed in European democratic movements such as Mazzini's Young Italy. He interested his daughter in these, even though she hated his biblical humbug (noting, for instance, in her diary that Abel was preferred to Cain only because God liked roast lamb better than greens). Her conviction that humanity was the one true basis of belief, gained first from an unconventional local preacher, was strengthened by hearing the reformer George Dawson (1821&#150;1876) during her years at school in Birmingham.<br>
<br>By the age of twenty-one Jessie White was living from private lessons and her writing, which included entries for the <span class="italic">Biographical Magazine</span> and stories for <span class="italic">Eliza Cook's Journal</span>. During a period of work and study in Paris, her radical ideas were further encouraged by meetings with Cousin, Martin, and Lamennais. In the autumn of 1854 she accompanied Emma Roberts, a widow who believed herself engaged to Garibaldi, for a stay with the general in Nice and Sardinia. She afterwards described this trip as the realization of a dream, binding her to a cause for which she would live and die. In Florence she became intimate with the Brownings, learning much through them about Italian politics. On returning to England in May 1855, she applied to study medicine but was refused because of her sex; instead she became a sedulous reader at the British Museum, preparing articles on Italy for the <span class="italic">Daily News</span> and other papers. Through Garibaldi she met Orsini and translated his <span class="italic">Austrian Dungeons in Italy</span>; through the Ashursts she was introduced to Mazzini, who in 1856 asked her to undertake a lecture tour of British cities.<br>
<br>In 1857 Jessie White went back to Italy and was welcomed like a revolutionary saint, but, following the disastrous Pisacane expedition, she was arrested in Genoa together with Mazzini's associate Alberto Mario (1825&#150;1883). On her release she took Mario home to Portsmouth, where they married on 19 December 1857. During another lecture tour in 1858, witnesses praised the graphic eloquence and truthfulness that emerged from this plump, dowdy figure with her shock of flaming hair and partiality for cigars. In the opinion of a later commentator, she blended &#145;the staunch tenacity of the Anglo-Saxon race with the poetic enthusiasm of the Latin&#146;  (Litta-Visconti-Arese, introduction to <span class="italic">Birth of Modern Italy</span>, i). In the winter of 1858&#150;9 the Marios rallied support for Mazzini in America, but Jessie's forthright manner and extremist views provoked controversy on both sides of the Atlantic and led to a painful break with the more conservative Brownings. The couple returned to Italy full of hope that France's initiative against Austria would bring freedom, but experienced instead the disillusionment of Villafranca. They were imprisoned again, but released, and wintered in Lugano. By now they were drifting away from Mazzinian idealism. In the summer of 1860 they joined Garibaldi in his Sicilian campaign, Alberto as aide-de-camp and Jessie as nurse; she boldly took charge of hospital activities under conditions of great chaos and corruption. Mario's <span class="italic">The Red Shirt</span> (1865) portrays this &#145;Miss Uragano&#146; as tender with the wounded but tough and versatile in the field. She successfully appealed to wealthy Englishwomen for ambulance supplies, but in battle tore up her underclothes to make bandages. She became known as &#145;Garibaldi's Englishwoman&#146;, nursing him after Aspromonte and serving under him in 1866 and again in 1867, in which year they also attended together the Geneva Congress of the League of Peace; she began the anti-Prussian campaign of 1870 as a war reporter, but Garibaldi made her chief of ambulances with the rank of major.<br>
<br>With the unity of Italy complete, the Marios resided there permanently. Jessie still travelled about for purposes of research, but lived chiefly at Florence, where she taught and wrote prolifically for the press, including <span class="italic">The Nation</span>, for which she was Italian correspondent on and off from 1866 to her death. Among her many books were studies of poverty and the convict system, editions of Mazzini and Bertani, and several works on Garibaldi. Her splendid <span class="italic">Garibaldi et son temps</span> (1884) was dedicated to the memory of Alberto, who died of cancer on 2 March 1883; she also published a biography of Mario and an edition of his writings. This productivity was achieved with little financial reward and at much cost to herself: she developed writer's cramp and suffered a mild stroke, but struggled on with the help of a typewriter and an amanuensis. Although her grasp on content was seldom perfect, readers were swept along by her commitment and her candid expressiveness, as in her essays on hygiene, abortion, boy-labourers in Sicilian sulphur mines, and a frightful paupers' cemetery with 365 covered pits, one for each day of the year.<br>
<br>Jessie White Mario died at Florence on 5 March 1906 and was cremated after a funeral procession through the city; her ashes were buried beside her husband's at Lendinara. A selection of her posthumous papers was published in 1909 as <span class="italic">The Birth of Modern Italy</span>&#151;a phenomenon to which she had contributed so much and so courageously.<br>
