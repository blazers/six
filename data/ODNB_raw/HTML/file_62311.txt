<span class="headword">Elgood,  George Samuel</span>  (1851&#150;1943), <span class="occ">landscape and garden painter</span>, was born on 26 February 1851 in Oxford Street, St Mary, Leicester, one of the ten children of Samuel Elgood (<i>d</i>. 1874), a wool merchant, and his wife, Jane Octavia, the daughter of George Shirley of Mackworth, Derbyshire. In 1865 he was sent to Bloxham School, Banbury, but he stayed there only about a year. Although he seems to have been brought up in Suffolk, in the late 1860s, for financial reasons, the Elgood family moved back to Leicester, where Samuel Elgood ran a yarn agency. George attended the Leicester School of Art, studying under Wilmot Pilsbury; two of his brothers were also artists. Elgood sketched the Leicestershire countryside and its buildings with his brother Thomas&#151;a topographical and landscape painter&#151;Pilsbury, and the architectural painter John Fulleylove, who married his sister Elizabeth. His brother Richard founded the art metalwork firm of Elgood Brothers.<br>
<br>Elgood began a course at the South Kensington School of Art (later the Royal College of Art), specializing in architecture, but had to return to Leicester in 1874 to carry on the family business after the death of his father. Travelling about the country for the yarn agency, however, gave him the opportunity to paint landscapes in his spare time. He exhibited his work for the first time at the Walker Gallery in Liverpool in 1874, and showed again in 1878 and 1880. He also exhibited at the Dudley Gallery and at the Baillie Gallery. In 1881 he became an associate of the Institute of Painters in Water Colours, and in 1882 an associate of the Institute of Painters in Oil Colours. Most of his garden paintings were shown between 1891 and 1925 at the Fine Arts Society, where they were enormously popular and invariably sold out to affluent patrons&#151;who included members of the royal family: Queen Victoria and Queen Mary both bought Elgood's pictures, many of which are still in the Royal Collection.<br>
<br>It was after his marriage about 1881 to Mary Clephan, an artist and a woman of means, that Elgood began specializing in the painting of gardens; he was to become one of the best-loved garden painters of his time. Formal, architectural gardens were his passion, and he and his wife travelled to France, Italy, Spain, and Tangier. They spent several months in Italy every year, and visited Venice, Florence, and Rome, as well as Sicily. Although Elgood painted scenes such as <span class="italic">Fishing Boats on the Lagoon</span> in Venice, it was his portrayals of the formal villa gardens of Renaissance Italy, including the Villa Borghese, the Villa D'Este, and the Villa Garzoni, which made his reputation. Among his subjects in England were many of the major gardens of the time&#151;gardens of historic interest such as Montacute, Penshurst, Compton Winyates, and Arley Hall. In an age before gardens were taken over by the National Trust, private owners proudly showed to their house party guests at the height of the season their immaculately kept herbaceous borders, rose-clad pergolas, trim yew hedges, and topiary work. These were the scenes Elgood was commissioned to immortalize in his paintings, scenes which mirrored a slice of social history in the indulgent years before the First World War when labour was both plentiful and cheap.<br>
<br>Elgood's garden paintings reached a wide public after his two books were published. The first, <span class="italic">Some English Gardens</span>, was published in collaboration with Gertrude Jekyll in 1904; the second, <span class="italic">Italian Gardens</span>, appeared in 1907 and reflected his love of the formal garden in Renaissance style. He also illustrated <span class="italic">The Garden that I Love</span>, by Alfred Austen, first published in 1894. Elgood's style and the subject matter of his paintings reflected his architectural training. With his eye for detail and the contrasts of pattern and texture of building materials, he accurately depicted balustrading, finialled gate piers, flights of steps, and lichen-covered walls. The colours of his palette were mellow&#151;soft browns, greens, and blues&#151;as if perceived through a misty veil. No gaudy coloured flower-bedecked borders appeared in his paintings, which marked him apart from other contemporary garden painters such as Beatrice Parsons and Arthur Rowe.<br>
<br>In 1908 Elgood moved to Knockwood at Tenterden in Kent. The garden he made surrounding the timber-framed house, with its topiary work, mellow stone walls and paths, pergola, and cottage garden flowers, was the subject of many paintings. Elgood's bearded, angular face, with its earnest expression, betrayed an eccentric, anti-social character. He was often critical of others, including garden designers such as Thomas Mawson. As he grew older, his idiosyncrasies became more pronounced: he lived without electric light or piped water until his death in 1943. When the council decided to cut down trees on his boundary he sat in his shed pointing a shotgun at them until they finally had to give in and the trees were saved  (Eckstein). After his death, on 21 October 1943 at Knockwood, some of his antiquities and paintings went to the Maidstone Museum.<br>
