<span class="headword">Richard fitz Nigel</span> <span class="st"> [Richard fitz Neal]</span>  (<em>c.</em>1130&#150;1198), <span class="occ">administrator, writer, and bishop of London</span>, was the son, presumably illegitimate, of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20190/', "Nigel (c.1100&#150;1169)")</script>, Henry I's treasurer and bishop of Ely, who in turn was nephew of Roger of Salisbury (<i>d</i>. 1139). Contemporaries referred to him at various stages of his life until he became bishop of London as Richard of Ely or as Richard the Treasurer, and the closeness of family feeling within the group is best illustrated by the devoted tone of Richard's <span class="italic">Dialogus de Scaccario</span> (&#145;Dialogue of the exchequer&#146;). His mother was probably English&#151;a document of 1184 follows Richard's name with that of &#145;William the Englishman, brother of the treasurer&#146;  (Madox, 1.215&#150;16). His youth was far from tranquil; in 1144, and also earlier in the reign, King Stephen took him as a hostage for the good behaviour of his father, Nigel. However, his paternal family, and also the monastery of Ely, ensured that his education was a learned one. His later writings display a fondness for classical phrases, at least a basic knowledge of the categories of logic, and some learning in Roman law.<h2>
<a name="Attheexchequer"></a>At the exchequer</h2>Henry II's reign saw Nigel securely restored to royal favour; according to Richard, writing two decades later, his father was brought in to revive the ancient learning and practices of the exchequer. Within the first few years of the reign Richard became treasurer, having already perhaps held the post of chief writing clerk in the exchequer. The <span class="italic">Liber Eliensis</span> states that Henry II, eager for money for his Toulouse campaign of 1159, accepted &pound;400 from Nigel so that his son might be treasurer. While the link between Nigel's payment and the treasurership may not be quite so close, and while no other source gives an exact date for Richard's assumption of the treasurership, the association with Nigel's influence and the period 1156&#150;60, and quite possibly with some kind of payment, seems sure. His tenure of the office was lengthy, lasting until just before his death in 1198. If initially he may have been overshadowed by his father, he long enjoyed personal control of the office. His financial activities were wide-ranging. In 1173 Richard, Nicholas de Sigillo, and Reginald de Warenne were responsible for taxing the royal demesnes in Bedfordshire, Buckinghamshire, Kent, Oxfordshire, and Sussex. The pipe roll of 1175 records a payment concerning the king's horses which the treasurer took with him to the continent. It is conceivable, although unprovable, that Richard's trip was connected to financial reorganization in Normandy during 1176. In the late 1170s he was at work on the <span class="italic">Dialogus de Scaccario</span>, which is both a manual of exchequer business and a celebration of Richard's family as royal servants. Indeed, the family connection with the treasury was continued after Richard's time, for his successor was described as William of Ely &#145;our kinsman&#146;.<br>
<br>In common with other royal servants of the time, Richard's involvement in administration was not limited to one field, in his case that of finance. In 1179 he was an itinerant justice, going on a circuit through Hampshire, Wiltshire, Gloucestershire, Dorset, Somerset, Devon, Cornwall, Berkshire, and Oxfordshire. Final concords also record him serving as a royal justice at Westminster, sometimes, but far from always, at the exchequer. Other final concords were made before him elsewhere, for example on 27 January 1188 and 20 January 1189 at Oxford. He also dealt with a variety of other tasks for the king; for instance in the late 1180s he kept a falcon for Henry's use, and in 1189 was one of those sent by the king to Canterbury concerning a dispute between the archbishop and Christ Church. The pipe rolls record some of his reward, with Richard from 1177 receiving &pound;20 a year from the manors of Essendon and Bayford in Hertfordshire.<h2>
<a name="Promotioninthechurch"></a>Promotion in the church</h2>Meanwhile Richard was also occupying various positions in the church. He first occurs as archdeacon of Ely <i>c</i>.1158, and may have controlled diocesan affairs during his father's lengthy terminal illness in the 1160s. He also held the prebend of Chiswick from St Paul's Cathedral. Probably in December 1183 Richard was appointed dean of Lincoln. One of his major acts was to buy certain ruinous houses in the churchyard, rebuild them from their foundations, and give them to the deanery as the dean's first proper residence. In 1186 the canons of Lincoln, wanting to please the king, proposed Richard as their bishop. Henry refused to accept either Richard or two other candidates put forward by the canons, and chose the saintly Carthusian Hugh instead. However, Richard was soon to have a bishopric. Following the death of Gilbert Foliot in 1187 Richard was elected bishop of London on 15 or 16 September 1189 at Pipewell, and on 31 December following he was consecrated at Lambeth in the presence of twelve bishops. As bishop he can be seen looking after his diocese in various ways, for example by constructing buildings, by pursuing a dispute with a certain John Picot concerning lands in the bishop's fee at Barnet, Hertfordshire, and by endowing the master of the cathedral school with tithes. That St Paul's was a centre of learning in his time is confirmed by the presence of Ralph de Diceto as dean.<br>
<br>Before setting off on the third crusade Archbishop Baldwin of Canterbury held a council at Westminster on 19 February 1190 where he made Richard his deputy. Richard took up the pastoral care both in the territory of Kent and in the churches of the archbishop's manors. This position involved Richard in the case of Hugh de Nonant, bishop of Coventry, whom Baldwin had suspended for accepting the shrievalties of Warwickshire, Staffordshire, and Leicestershire. Hugh promised to resign the offices, and not to accept their like in future, whereupon Baldwin wrote to Richard asking him to ensure that Hugh kept his promise, and Hugh duly resigned his offices, and wrote to Richard about his decision.<br>
<br>On 15&#150;16 October 1190 Richard attended a council held by William de Longchamp as papal legate at Westminster. Ralph de Diceto reports simply that Richard, as the third most important bishop according to the custom of the realm, sat at the legate's right hand. However, Gervase of Canterbury records a long dispute involving the bishop of Rochester concerning the relative claims of the latter and the bishop of London as to the consecration of the bishop of Worcester and the seat at the legate's right hand. Following Archbishop Baldwin's death on crusade in 1190 Richard took a leading role in assembling the bishops for the election of a successor in November and December of the following year. However, in part because Richard was detained in London on the king's business, the bishops were pre-empted by the monks of Canterbury who succeeded in electing their own candidate, Reginald de Bohun, bishop of Bath. But Reginald died on 26 December 1191, and Richard was once more responsible for assembling the bishops for an election on 30 May 1193. Again the monks anticipated any action by the bishops, and on 29 May elected Hubert Walter. This time, despite the infringement of what the bishops regarded as their privilege, the monks' choice was acceptable, and was confirmed the next day when the bishops also elected Hubert at Westminster, and Richard made the public announcement of the election. Hubert was enthroned on 7 November, but this too was an occasion for controversy. Richard, as bishop of London and hence as dean among the bishops of the church of Canterbury, and the bishop of Rochester, as the archbishop's chaplain, both claimed precedence in the ceremony. A compromise was finally reached, allowing Richard to take his place at the archbishop's right hand, and to say prayers when the pall was placed on the archbishop's shoulders and when he was enthroned. As at other times in his episcopate, Richard seems highly attached to the privileges and traditions of his see, just as he was to the customs of the exchequer.<h2>
<a name="RelationswithCountJohnanddeath"></a>Relations with Count John, and death</h2>During Richard I's absence from the realm much of Bishop Richard's time was occupied with the dispute between the king's brother Count John and the chancellor William de Longchamp. On 28 July 1191, at a conference at Winchester, Richard, along with other great churchmen, was a mediator in the peace between John and Longchamp. By the agreement, Richard undertook the keeping of the castle of Bristol. However, in mid-September Geoffrey, the king's half-brother and newly consecrated archbishop of York, landed at Dover, only to be seized by supporters of Longchamp, who violently dragged him from St Martin's Priory wherein he had taken refuge. Richard took a prominent part in the condemnation of this act; he travelled to see Longchamp in the region of Norwich and according to Gerald of Wales threatened an interdict unless Geoffrey were released&#151;according to Diceto having to pledge his bishopric as the condition for Geoffrey's release. Following his release Geoffrey went to London, where he was received by Richard with great honour on 2 October.<br>
<br>Meanwhile John had summoned a council at Loddon Bridge, between Reading and Windsor. On 5 October Richard, together with other great men, accompanied William de Longchamp from Windsor towards the meeting, but Longchamp, his position undermined by the scandal of Archbishop Geoffrey's arrest, then turned back to Windsor and proceeded to flee to London. On 8 October a meeting of barons and bishops was held at St Paul's, where all swore an oath of loyalty to the king. According to Diceto only Richard added to his oath &#145;saving his order and ecclesiastical justice&#146;  (<span class="italic">Diceto &hellip; opera historica</span>, 2.99). On 9 October the monks of Westminster elected their prior William Postard as abbot, in preference to William de Longchamp's brother, and the new abbot received his staff and a blessing from Richard before the altar of St Paul. On 10 October Richard was present when Longchamp was deprived of his temporal authority. In 1192, however, it was the turn of Archbishop Geoffrey to be cast as Richard's opponent. In March he stayed in London at the New Temple while he attended a council. When he went from his residence to the council, he had his processional cross carried before him, an act that Richard and the other bishops of the southern province declared to be contrary to right. They would hold Geoffrey as excommunicate, and threatened that, if the act was repeated, they would break the cross, as they would already have done if he had not been a king's son, a king's brother, and a new archbishop. Richard also suspended the New Temple from celebration of divine office and sounding of bells because Geoffrey had stayed there. Richard seems to have won this conflict, as Geoffrey was careful not to have his cross carried before him when he left London on his return to York.<br>
<br>Throughout this period Richard retained his importance to the king and to royal administration. In April 1193 he was made one of the guardians of Richard's ransom. On 10 February 1194 he was one of the bishops who excommunicated John and his supporters in the infirmary chapel at Westminster Abbey as disturbers of the king's peace and of the realm. On the king's return the bishop of London was prominent at the king's formal crown wearing on 17 April 1194. Gervase of Canterbury records that he owed his important position in the procession to the seniority of his see, and that he sat on the left-hand side of the enthroned king. Richard's loyalty to the king was also apparent at the Council of Oxford in 1197, when Hubert Walter put forward the king's request for 300 knights to serve him abroad for an entire year. The incident is famous for the refusal of Hugh of Lincoln to provide such service, but before this occurred Richard had declared his support for Hubert's request. Richard's judicial activities also continued, and he sat regularly as a justice at Westminster until 1196, and then more occasionally until his death. Other final concords show his sitting as a royal justice elsewhere, for example on 22 July 1192 at Hertford. Final concords and the pipe rolls of the fifth and seventh years of the reign show him serving as an itinerant justice in Essex, Hertfordshire, Norfolk, and Suffolk, and perhaps Cambridgeshire and Huntingdonshire. Richard died on 10 September 1198.<h2>
<a name="Writings"></a>Writings</h2>Richard retains his prominence in historians' eyes not only because of his active life but also because of his writings. Unfortunately not all of these survive, but Richard himself records that before the late 1170s he had written<blockquote>a little book &hellip; about the history of the realm of England under the illustrious king of the English Henry I. &hellip; I called it <span class="italic">Tricolumnis</span> because I arranged it all in three columns. The first column dealt with very many affairs of the English Church and some papal bulls. The second dealt with the king's noble deeds, which are beyond human belief. In the third are many matters of public or private interest, and also judgments of the King's court. (<span class="italic">Dialogus</span>, ed. and trans. Johnson, 27)</blockquote>This description comes from Richard's famous surviving work, the <span class="italic">Dialogus de Scaccario</span>. This was composed in the late 1170s, although the existing text includes passages which are probably later interpolations, some not necessarily by Richard. The work takes the form of a dialogue between a master and a student. It is divided into two parts, the first dealing primarily with the staff and structure of the exchequer, the second with the operation of one of its sessions. Also included is a variety of incidental, often historical, material. With the slightly later <span class="italic">Tractatus de legibus</span>, attributed to Glanvill, Richard's <span class="italic">Dialogus</span> marks the emergence of a new type of work, the secular administrative manual.<br>
