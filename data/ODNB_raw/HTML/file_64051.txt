<span class="headword">Coral <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>Kagarlitsky]</span>,  Joseph <span class="st"> [Joe]</span></span>  (1904&#150;1996), <span class="occ">bookmaker</span>, was born on 11 December 1904 into a Jewish family in Warsaw, Poland. His father, Abraham Kagarlitsky, died when he was very young; his mother, Jessica, took Joe and his two brothers to London, before the First World War, and they settled in the East End. The family soon changed its name to Coral, a name drawn from R. M. Ballantyne's novel <span class="italic">Coral Island</span>. During his school years Joe was afflicted by polio which badly affected both his arms, but his remarkable flair for mathematics had been strongly apparent. On leaving school at fourteen he took a job with a lamp-maker, just as the First World War came to an end. It was there that he made his first entry into the world of betting; he became a bookie's runner: that is, someone who runs bets for his colleagues and workmates on behalf of the local bookmaker. Off-course ready money (cash) betting on horse-racing had been illegal since 1853, and the bookie's runner was a pivotal figure in the culture of working-class betting and gambling.<br>
<br>Coral soon understood that the bets were money in the bookmaker's pocket. The punters rarely made claims for winnings due. &#145;I would notice&#146;, he recalled, &#145;that it was only once in a blue moon that there would be a claim the next day. I thought &#147;you must be mad to give it to the bookmaker&#148;&#146;  (McGrath). He began to stand bets himself, and to make his own profits. He was sacked from the lamp-maker's workshop for, in Coral's words, &#145;concentrating on the wrong ledger&#146;. He went to work at a small London advertising agency. The Saturdays off enabled Coral to build up a local network of punters based at a billiard hall in Stoke Newington, and he was soon established as a local bookmaker. Billiards and snooker also remained his lifelong hobbies. In 1927 he left advertising to set up his own pitches at the Harringay and White City greyhound racing tracks. The introduction of the electric hare from the United States of America in 1926 thus assisted Coral's career: it created a legal context for trackside betting.<br>
<br>In common with so many bookies Coral maintained both a legal and an illegal trade. The legitimate side of the business was greyhound racing and credit betting with cheques, where no ready money changed hands, but the most lucrative wing of his business was street betting. Coral stated that he would go out every morning with the aim of increasing his trade. He drank in local pubs, took shaves with the local barbers, and informally plied his trade with those publicans, barbers, shopkeepers, and others willing to take bets on his behalf. Other locals took bets for Coral from pitches in streets and in back alleys. By 1930 he was a cash-in-hand employer of between seventy and eighty agents who collected ready-money bets for him. By that year he had also taken over the pitches of Bill Chandler, a popular Hoxton bookie, who was unable to compete with Coral.<br>
<br>The illegality of street betting bred criminal interference, and the dog tracks were unofficially controlled by gangs. Coral's success attracted the attention of the notorious London mafia, the Derby Sabini gang. During the late 1920s Coral was violently intimidated by Derby Sabini himself. According to Coral, &#145;I shoved an old rusty pistol that wasn't even loaded into his guts and told him &#147;F*** off or you'll get this through the belly&#148;&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>). This gesture earned Coral both the freedom to conduct his business without overt menaces and the respect of the local punters.<br>
<br>Coral was one of the largest regional bookmakers in England by 1939. War interrupted the betting business, owing to the huge reductions in the racing calendar, but Coral was still busy. He opened a credit betting office in Stoke Newington in 1941, and moved the office to London's West End four years later. After the war, moreover, Coral was one of a number of bookmakers who advertised betting by post in the major sporting newspapers such as the <span class="italic">Sporting Life</span> and the <span class="italic">Sporting Chronicle</span>. &#145;Sporting&#146; newspapers were really betting newspapers. Betting by post was legal because no cash changed hands, only cheques or postal orders. The illegal business continued to thrive, however, but the 1950s witnessed a thawing of official attitudes to betting and gambling. During an era of full employment and affluence the paternalistic concern of church and government lest the working classes gamble themselves into poverty was misplaced. The police, moreover, took the opportunity to argue to the royal commission on betting, lotteries and gaming of 1949&#150;51 that the law was unworkable, and that illegal betting was a thriving open secret which rendered futile any attempts to restrict it through intervention. This change of thinking led to the <span class="roman">Betting and Gaming Act</span> of 1960, which finally legalized off-course cash betting, and introduced the licensed betting office to the high streets and back streets of England and Wales.<br>
<br>Initially Coral, along with other large bookmakers such as William Hill, for example, had been unenthusiastic about legalization. A major requirement of the 1960 act was that any new betting office needed to show &#145;unstimulated demand&#146; before being granted a licence. One way was to convert existing business premises to a licensed betting office. Coral paid to have the sweetshop of one of his agents turned into a betting shop. The most efficient way, however, to negotiate the new law was to buy up other offices, and by 1962 Coral had twenty-three shops. Subsequently during the 1960s the corporate structure of bookmaking became more fully fledged, and bookmaking firms became public companies, operating on a legal and commercial basis. Corals became a public limited company in 1963, and diversified into casinos, bingo halls, and hotels. The firm was bought, in 1970, by the brewing, hotels, and entertainments group Bass. The motives for the take-over were clear: Corals' annual profits were &pound;1.5 million in that year. He remained president of the bookmaking firm and a major company director, and took some important subsequent initiatives.<br>
<br>By the mid-1970s expansion had produced 650 Corals bookmakers' shops, and by the end of the decade Corals was one of the &#145;big four&#146; bookmaking firms. It retained that status into the 1990s. In 1992 Corals entered into an arrangement with the tote, the pool betting system based at the racecourses, whereby pool bets could be placed at Corals outlets. The company had also been one of the British bookmaking operations that ventured into Europe at that time; the aim was to take advantage of the continental punter's dissatisfaction with the lack of choice engendered by the municipal and state monopoly over betting. There were thirty-six Corals shops in Belgium by the end of 1992, taking bets on British and other countries' horse- and dog-racing.<br>
<br>Coral had married his wife, Dorothy Helen, in 1927. They brought up three sons, two of whom, Bernard and Nicholas, pursued careers in the family business from the early 1950s. Joe Coral died in University College Hospital, Camden, London, on 16 December 1996 from lung cancer, having suffered from dementia for some years. His address at death was a comfortable flat in Gloucester Place, Marylebone, London. A spokesman of the modern firm of Coral told the <span class="italic">Sporting Life</span> that &#145;we shall not see his like again&#146;&#151;a clich&eacute; appropriate for many earlier bookmakers and certainly for him: Coral's was a powerful rise from poverty to prosperity. In circumstances of considerable adversity, he had taken his chances and opportunities, and had reaped the results of wealth.<br>
