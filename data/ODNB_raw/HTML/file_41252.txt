<span class="headword">Wagner,  Arthur Douglas</span>  (1824&#150;1902), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, was born on 13 June 1824 at Park Hill, Windsor; he was the only child of Henry Michell Wagner (1792&#150;1870), clerk in holy orders, and his first wife, Elizabeth Harriott (1797&#150;1829), daughter of the Revd William Douglas, vicar of Gillingham in Dorset, chancellor of Salisbury Cathedral, and canon of Westminster. Wagner's father was tutor to the sons of the first duke of Wellington until his appointment to the vicarage of Brighton and West Blatchington in Sussex, to which he was inducted on 30 July 1824. Wagner was educated at Eton College (1835&#150;42) and at Trinity College, Cambridge (1842&#150;6), where he took an honours degree in mathematics. He was ordained deacon in 1848 and priest in 1849, serving as curate to his father, who, between 1846 and 1849, built the new church of St Paul at Brighton. Henry Wagner intended that St Paul's should be served by his son, who was appointed its first perpetual curate in January 1850. Wagner's father was a pre-Tractarian high-churchman and Wagner himself was strongly influenced by the Tractarian movement. The new church of St Paul was designed by one of the leading Tractarian architects, Richard Cromwell Carpenter, and it was the first church in Brighton at which an advanced ritual, including eventually the use of vestments and incense, was adopted. Wagner remained at St Paul's for the whole of his ministry, becoming its first vicar when a parish was assigned to the church in 1873.<br>
<br>In 1855 Wagner founded a sisterhood in connection with St Paul's, the Community of the Blessed Virgin Mary. Wagner and the sisterhood became the source of controversy in 1865 when Constance Kent, who was a nurse at the home for the reclamation of prostitutes established by the community, was tried for the murder, some five years earlier, of her half-brother. She had voluntarily admitted to the murder after having made a sacramental act of confession to Wagner, who at the trial refused to answer questions relating to this confession. Public meetings were organized in Brighton to protest against Wagner's actions, and he was assaulted in the street.<br>
<br>Wagner never married. He continued to live at Brighton vicarage until his father's death in 1870, when he moved into the neighbouring house, Belvedere, which he had inherited from his aunt Mary Ann Wagner in 1868. He used his wealth to carry on the tradition established by his father by building four further churches in Brighton: St Mary Magdalene (1862), the Annunciation (1864), the vast and austere St Bartholomew, in Ann Street (1874), and St Martin (1875). In 1873 he purchased Totease Hall at Buxted in Sussex, in which parish he erected a new church between 1885 and 1886. Altogether Wagner is estimated to have spent some &pound;70,000 during his lifetime on financing churches, schools, and even houses for his poorer parishioners.<br>
<br>Wagner lived an ascetic life, though in later life he became extremely stout; he was looked after by his two unmarried cousins, Elizabeth and Fanny Coombe. His only luxuries were the purchase of books and manuscripts. After his death the sale of his library, which totalled 12,000 volumes, took three days. He was not considered a good preacher and published very little: <span class="italic">Parochial Sermons Bearing on the Subjects of the Day</span> (1855), <span class="italic">Reasons for Disobeying on Principle</span> (1874), <span class="italic">Christ or Caesar: an Open Letter to the Archbishop of Canterbury</span> (1874), and <span class="italic">Christ or Caesar, Part II: a Letter to the Lord Bishop of Chichester</span> (1877). The last three pamphlets were attacks on the <span class="roman">Public Worship Regulation Act</span> and the courts created by it for suppressing illegal ritual in the Church of England. Although Wagner used illegal ritual at St Paul's in Brighton, no attempt was ever made to prosecute him under the provisions of the act. His brand of ritualism became popularly known as the &#145;London, Brighton, and South Coast Religion&#146;.<br>
<br>By 1896 Wagner was in failing health and mentally incapable of administering his own affairs; his parish was run by curates. Attempts were made to persuade him to resign but they were unsuccessful. After six years of further decline he died on 14 January 1902 at his house, Belvedere, and was buried four days later, wearing full eucharistic vestments, at Lewes Road cemetery in Brighton. Large congregations attended the requiem masses said for him at all the churches in Brighton which he had helped to establish, and 3000 people attended the interment. Part of his estate, valued at &pound;49,907 15<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>., was used to provide endowments for the churches and the sisterhood that he had founded in his lifetime.<br>
