<span class="headword">Petre,  William</span>  (1602&#150;1678), <span class="occ">translator</span>, was born on 28 July 1602 in his father's house at Ingatestone, Essex, the third son of William, second Lord Petre (1575&#150;1637), and his wife, Catherine (<i>d</i>. 1624), second daughter of Edward Somerset, fourth earl of Worcester (<i>c</i>.1550&#150;1628), and his wife, Elizabeth (<i>fl</i>. 1571&#150;1621). He was the great-grandson of Sir William Petre (1505?&#150;1572), secretary of state and benefactor of Exeter College, Oxford, where Petre matriculated as a gentleman commoner on 5 February 1613, at the early age of ten. The strength of the family's association with the college is marked by the fact that when Petre's eldest brother, John, died on 11 October 1613, the society of Exeter dedicated a threnody to the family. However, Petre's own connection with Exeter was short. When Wadham College was completed by his great-aunt, Dame Dorothy Wadham (1535&#150;1618), later in 1613, both he and his elder brother, Robert, became members of that college; as Wood records, Petre was entered as &#145;the first gentleman commoner or nobleman thereof&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 3.1144&#150;5). Both brothers left without taking a degree, but as fellow-commoners they presented the college with two silver tankards, which survived until 26 January 1643, when they were melted down at Charles I's mint in New Inn Hall Street.<br>
<br>After leaving Oxford, Petre joined the Inner Temple. He went on to travel in the south of Europe, and &#145;became a gentleman of many accomplishments&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 3.1145). He married Lucy (<i>d</i>. 1679), daughter of Sir Richard Fermor, of Somerton, Oxfordshire, with whom he had four sons and two daughters. Like the rest of his family, he remained a Roman Catholic, as is reflected in his translation work; later generations became leaders of English Roman Catholic society [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/64188/', "Petre family (per. 1633&#150;1801)")</script>]. In 1669 he had published at St Omer a translation of the then popular <span class="italic">Flos sanctorum</span> of the Jesuit Pedro de Ribadeneira, originally published at Madrid in 1599&#150;1601. His translation, <span class="italic">Lives of the Saints, with other Feasts of the Year According to the Roman Calendar</span>, extends the calendar as far as 1669. The first edition soon became scarce, and a second, corrected and amended, was published in London in 1730. This too appears to have been popular; Petre's translation was commended by Southey and by Isaac Disraeli in his <span class="italic">Curiosities of Literature</span>. Petre died on 16 January 1678 at his house in Stanford Rivers in Essex, and was buried in the chancel of Stanford Rivers church.<br>
