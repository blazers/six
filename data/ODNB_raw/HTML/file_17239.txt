<span class="headword">Lydiat,  Thomas</span>  (1572&#150;1646), <span class="occ">chronologist</span>, was baptized on 4 April 1572 at Alkerton, Oxfordshire, one of several children of Christopher Lydiat (<i>d</i>. 1613/14), citizen of London and, since 1567, lord of Alkerton manor. He entered Winchester College about 1584, and matriculated from New College, Oxford, on 28 January 1592. He became a full fellow in 1593, graduated BA on 3 May 1595, and proceeded MA on 5 February 1599. He contributed poems to the memorial collections <span class="italic">Oxoniensium stenagmos, sive, Carmina ab Oxoniensibus Conscripta in obitum illustrissimi herois, D. Christopheri Hattoni militis</span> (1592) for Christopher Hatton, and <span class="italic">Oxoniensis academiae funebre officium</span> (1603) for Queen Elizabeth.<br>
<br>Lydiat relinquished his fellowship in 1603 rather than study divinity, owing to &#145;a great defect in his memory and utterance, of which he often complained&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 3.185). He pursued instead his key interests in astronomy and chronology, subsisting on private means. Lectures on these subjects delivered in 1599 were published as <span class="italic">Tractatus de variis annorum formis</span>, together with his <span class="italic">Praelectio astronomica de natura coeli et conditionibus elementorum</span> and <span class="italic">Disquisitio physiologica de origine fontium</span>, in London in 1605. These were a significant contribution to burgeoning scientific and theological debates on the nature of the cosmos and the structure of the calendar. Lydiat's use of physics supported the developing belief in a fluid universe, and, like Kepler, he abandoned the established astronomical principle of circularity in the face of empirical observation. He was one of the first to state that the sun &#145;describes a segment, not of a circle, but of an oval line&#146;  (<span class="italic">Praelectio astronomica</span>, cap. 7, p. 64). He remained harnessed to scripture, however, arguing that creation, while fluid, was finite, being ultimately contained within a sphere surrounded by water and controlled by God. Lydiat's early work simultaneously defined the &#145;octodesexcentenarian&#146; period, by which he managed to reconcile solar and lunar months in a complex annual calendar on a 592-year cycle.<br>
<br>These multiple claims launched Lydiat into protracted arguments with the continental scholars Kepler and Scaliger. The latter called Lydiat &#145;the greatest monster that ever England produced&#146; and &#145;the veryest fool in the whole world&#146;  (Plot, 223), comparing him to travelling troupes of English actors. Among other matters, Lydiat challenged Scaliger's dating of both creation and the birth of Christ; his ideas were in turn refuted in Scaliger's <span class="italic">Isagogici canones chronologiae</span> (1606). Lydiat defended himself in his <span class="italic">Defensio tractatus de variis annorum formis &hellip; contra J. Scaligeri obtrectationem una cum examen ejus canonum chronologiae isagogicorum</span> (1607), and the <span class="italic">Recensio et explicatio argumentorum &hellip; insertis brevibus confutationibus opinionum Scaligeranae &hellip; atque Johannis Keppleri</span> (1613).<br>
<br>Lydiat's growing reputation led to his appointment as chronographer and cosmographer to Henry, prince of Wales, who made him a member of his household on an annual pension of 40 marks. In return Lydiat dedicated to Prince Henry his key work on chronology, <span class="italic">Emendatio temporum ab initio mundi &hellip; contra Scaligerum et alios</span> (London, 1609). He was introduced to James Ussher, through whose influence he moved to Ireland; he was admitted as a fellow of Trinity College, Dublin, and graduated MA from that institution in 1609. Ussher attempted to procure him the mastership of a school in Armagh with an annual income of &pound;50, but by August 1611 Lydiat had returned to England. Ussher later built on Lydiat's research in constructing his famous protestant chronology of world history, and the two remained lifelong friends. Suggestions that Lydiat was Ussher's brother-in-law are without foundation, and there is no evidence that he ever married.<br>
<br>In 1612, perhaps as a result of the death of the prince of Wales, Lydiat became rector of Alkerton, his family parish. He remained based here for the rest of his life, rebuilding the rectory in 1625 and remodelling the chancel about the same time. He continued to engage in scholarly pursuits, producing over 600 sermons and harmonies of the gospels in English, Hebrew, and Greek together with other works. In the 1620s Lydiat published three astronomical and chronological works: <span class="italic">Solis et lunae periodus seu annus magnus</span> (1620), <span class="italic">De annis solaris mensura epistola astronomica ad Hen. Savilium</span> (1620), and <span class="italic">Numerus aureus melioribus lapillis insignatus</span> (1621). These reiterated his rejection of the Gregorian calendar and attempted a more pragmatic version of his octodesexcentenarian one. His later manuscript works established rules for chronological enquiries, and eventually proposed a new solar calendar with the year beginning on 1 March and the Christian era with Christ's baptism, formerly dated to <span class="smallcap">AD</span> 29. Such efforts argued for the supremacy of reformed over Catholic religion, but Lydiat rejected any alignment with millenarian interests in dating Christ's second coming.<br>
<br>In 1625 Lydiat's brother Richard fell into debt, a circumstance leading to the mortgage of Alkerton manor, and its sale in 1630. Thomas Lydiat incurred grave financial difficulties, and was imprisoned for debt continuously between 1627 and 1633 in Oxford and Southwark. An incomplete form of bail from Southwark prison for &pound;700 dated 8 July 1630 is suggestive of the extent of his woes  (Bodl. Oxf., Bodley MS 313, fol. 44). Financial relief and personal freedom were eventually obtained through the efforts of several scholars, including most notably Ussher and Laud, but also Sir William Boswell and Robert Pink, the warden of New College. According to Wood, John Selden declined to contribute to the cause because Lydiat had contradicted his &#145;Marmora Arundeliana&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 3.186). Lydiat's interest in ancient chronologies led him to petition the king during the 1630s for permission to travel to Turkey, Armenia, and Abyssinia but, unsurprisingly, given his credit history, these efforts met with no success.<br>
<br>Lydiat was opposed to some of Laud's reforms, writing manuscripts on altars, bowing at the name of Jesus, and incense from prison in 1633  (BL, Harley MS 2405). He nevertheless counted many puritans among his friends and neighbours, including John Dod and Robert Cleaver, the ministers of Hanwell and Drayton, Oxfordshire, and Sir Anthony Cope, to whom he had dedicated his <span class="italic">Defensio</span> in 1607. During the 1640s Lydiat sided with the royalists and continued to speak out in favour of episcopacy. In 1644 he wrote to Sir William Compton, governor of Banbury Castle, complaining that his house had been pillaged four times by parliamentary forces to the value of &pound;70, and that he was twice carried off by soldiers, once to Warwick and once to Banbury; he signed himself the &#145;old and weak minister&#146; of Alkerton  (Bodl. Oxf., Bodley MS 313, fol. 82). His sufferings in the civil war and his passion for scholarship to the exclusion of his physical needs led Samuel Johnson to recall him in the verse:<blockquote>
<div>If dreams yet flatter, once again attend;<br>
</div>
<div>Hear Lydiat's life and Galileo's end<br>
</div> (<span class="italic">The Vanity of Human Wishes</span>, 1749, ll. 163&#150;4)</blockquote>Lydiat died at Alkerton on 3 April 1646, possibly as a result of an assault by soldiers. He was buried the following day in the chancel of Alkerton church, near his parents. His will left goods valued at &pound;169. In 1669 the fellows of New College erected a monument over his grave, as well as a memorial in the college chapel.<br>
<br>Lydiat's nephew Timothy Lydiat (1618&#150;1663), also rector of Alkerton, may have inherited some of his manuscripts. By the 1670s they were in the possession of John Lamphire, and a part of this collection was published as <span class="italic">Canones chronologici</span> (1675). Lamphire's nephew Dr William Coward presented fifteen manuscripts to the Bodleian in 1695. A manuscript of his treatise on the Arundel marbles survives at Trinity College, Dublin, and was published as &#145;Marmoreum chronicon Arundelianum cum annotationibus&#146; in Humphrey Prideaux's <span class="italic">Marmora Oxoniensia</span> (1676). Lydiat was described in his own century as &#145;the happy Inventor of a more accurat period&#146;  (Plot, 224) but soon faded into obscurity. Nevertheless, he represents both the breadth and integration of Renaissance scholarship and the peculiar focus of protestant polemic, for he drew together astronomical and chronological research with textual criticism, mathematical advances, and theological debate in order to comprehend time and space.<br>
