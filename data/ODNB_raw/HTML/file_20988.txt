<span class="headword">Owen,  Corbet</span>  (1645/6&#150;1671), <span class="occ">Latin poet</span>, was born at Hinton in Shropshire, the son of William Owen, a clergyman of Pontesbury, and his wife, Anna. He was baptized on 5 May 1646 at Pontesbury, Shropshire. He was educated at a private school in Shrewsbury, run by a royalist parson called Scofield. Owen suffered badly from scrofula, or &#145;the king's evil&#146;, and had to use crutches. He was sent to France to be touched by the exiled Charles II; it is not recorded whether the hand of indigent majesty alleviated his symptoms. In May 1658 he went to Westminster School (king's scholar, 1659). Westminster was a leading centre of Latin versification, at which Owen showed great facility: &#145;it was usual with him to speak forty or fifty smooth and elegant verses extempore, in little more than half an hour&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>). He matriculated at Christ Church, Oxford, on 3 July 1663, aged seventeen, and was elected a student (the equivalent of a fellowship elsewhere) in 1664. He studied philosophy well, and may also have spent some time in Lincoln's Inn; later he also studied medicine. He graduated BA on 21 May 1667 and MA on 23 March 1670. Owen gained a reputation, according to Wood, as &#145;the most forward person of his age in the university for polite learning&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 3.924).<br>
<br>The chief production of Corbet Owen's brief literary career was a long Latin ode, in irregular stanzas (but with each line following a recognized metrical pattern), recited at the opening of the Sheldonian Theatre, Oxford, on 9 July 1669. This poem achieved some celebrity, and was reprinted in various editions of the popular collections of British Latin known as <span class="italic">Musae Anglicanae</span> (for example <span class="italic">Musarum Anglicanarum analecta</span>, 1721, 1.89; also 1741). These anthologies began in 1692 (Joseph Addison edited an expanded version in 1699), and Owen's ode was prominent among the university pieces thus preserved and presented to a wider public. Samuel Johnson knew it, and felt that it showed the pernicious influence of Abraham Cowley's &#145;Pindarick&#146; style. In fact Owen was writing in a Renaissance tradition of irregular Latin verse; a number of continental and domestic models exist, from the mid-sixteenth century onwards. Readers of university commemorative collections would have been familiar with the technique, which, while it might irritate purists, did allow for playful or rhetorical variations. Cowley certainly helped to popularize the pseudo-Pindaric genre in the vernacular: &#145;Cowley was probably responsible for Corbett's unclassical performance, but Owen might very easily have done the same thing if Cowley had never lived&#146;  (Bradner, 110).<br>
<br>Owen's <span class="italic">Carmen Pindaricum</span> has twenty-four irregular stanzas (twenty-eight pages). He celebrates Wren's design of the Sheldonian as a triumph of the modern over the Gothic; enemies will be envious. Owen praises Sheldon for allowing the university's printing press to use the new building. Dr Fell (Owen's own head of house) is second only to Sheldon. He alludes wittily, in stanza 24, to the dangers of his irregular form: Horace has warned  (<span class="italic">Odes</span>, iv.2) that Icarus's watery fate awaits imitators of Pindar, and &#145;obsedere vias <i>latrones Grammaticastri</i>&#146; (&#145;bandit&#150;scholars have infested the roads&#146;). Critics use procrustean beds:<blockquote>
<div>Heu docti nimium versus torquere misellos,<br>
</div>
<div>Nunc <i>tensos</i> immane pedes producere gaudent,<br>
</div>
<div>Nunc <i>sauciatis</i> amputare syllabis.<br>
</div>(Alas, the over-learned rejoice to torture poor verses, now to stretch out feet, now to amputate, leaving wounded syllables.)</blockquote>So Owen anticipates and mocks Dr Johnson's criticism.<br>
<br>Owen also wrote an English Pindaric ode, in twenty-one stanzas, &#145;Upon the Intolerable Heat in the Latter End of May and the Beginning of June, 1665&#146;, which is the last, and only signed, poem in John Bulteel's <span class="italic">New Collection of Poems and Songs</span> (1674). It starts vigorously:<blockquote>
<div>Fire, fire, fire, fire, the Bells all backwards ring:<br>
</div>
<div>Haste, haste, to every Well and Spring.<br>
</div>
</blockquote>But death stalks the countryside and city, in the form of the plague, while the brave fleet faces the Dutch. Owen ends by considering his own verse:<blockquote>
<div>This onely my Pindaricks do desire,<br>
</div>
<div>Not for to save my house, but my own self from fire.<br>
</div>
<div>
<i>Pindar's</i> bright Poetick flame<br>
</div>
<div>Surviv'd his ashes, blown by Fame.<br>
</div>
</blockquote>Corbet Owen's flame, alas, did not have the chance to burn quite so brightly. He died about 18 January 1671, and was buried at Condover in Shropshire.<br>
