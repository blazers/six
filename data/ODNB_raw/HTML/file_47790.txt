<span class="headword">Gray,  John</span>  (<em>c.</em>1799&#150;1883), <span class="occ">socialist and writer on economics</span>, was by his own account educated between the ages of nine and thirteen at Repton School, Derbyshire, where he &#145;learned little else than to catch fish, to play at marbles and to climb trees&#146;  (Gray, 338). Subsequently, at the age of fourteen, he was employed in a manufacturing and wholesale house in Cheapside. It was from this time on, he informs us, that he concerned himself with the reform of the social system.<br>
<br>Having penned an abortive tract on the subject, entitled &#145;The national commercial system&#146;, Gray, at the instigation of his brother James, took an interest in the ideas of Robert Owen and heard him speak at the London tavern debates of August 1817. However, it was some years before Gray once again committed his ideas to paper; his first published work was <span class="italic">A Lecture on Human Happiness</span>, published in January 1825. Gray claimed that he had arrived at the central ideas of this book independently of Owen, but it certainly reflects many of the central concerns of Owenite socialism. It is, in essence, an indictment of competitive capitalism, which in Gray's view (substantiated by reference to Patrick Colquhoun's <span class="italic">Treatise on the Population, Wealth, Power and Resources of the British Empire</span>, 1814), had produced a distribution of wealth skewed in favour of the unproductive part of the nation and detrimental to those whose labour was its source. This distribution was effected by means of unequal exchanges which in a competitive context favoured the owners of capital and land, who were able to exact interest and rent from those with only their labour to sell. Gray argued further that these evils could be eliminated by the formation of co-operative communities where the business of competitive exchange would have no place.<br>
<br>This preoccupation with co-operative communities led Gray to take an interest in that established by Abram Combe and Archibald Hamilton at Orbiston near Motherwell in 1825. He visited it in that year but his reaction, as expressed in <span class="italic">A Word of Advice to the Orbistonians</span> (1826), was highly critical. In 1825 too he began publishing a &#145;gratis&#146; newspaper given over entirely to advertisements, the <span class="italic">Edinburgh and Leith Advertiser</span>. This was converted into a regular newspaper but failed after fifty-three numbers, to be replaced by the <span class="italic">Edinburgh, Leith, Glasgow and North British Commercial and Literary Advertiser</span> (later the <span class="italic">North British Advertiser</span>), which proved commercially successful. In 1830 he sought to establish a printers' hall in Edinburgh which would enable several firms to share modern machinery in common premises. This proved a disaster and led to a short period of imprisonment for debt, but the business of newspaper publishing was ultimately to make Gray's fortune: at the peak of its success some 19,000 copies of the <span class="italic">North British Advertiser</span> (merged with another of Gray's papers, the <span class="italic">Ladies' Own Journal</span>, in 1874) were being distributed in Scotland and the north of England.<br>
<br>Yet in the 1830s and 1840s Gray continued to stress the need for a change in existing economic and social arrangements. Specifically, in <span class="italic">The Social System: a Treatise on the Principle of Exchange</span> (1831) he abandoned his earlier communitarianism and argued for a technocratically run and centrally planned economy. This could be effected through a national chamber of commerce that comprised &#145;eminent merchants, bankers, brokers etc&#146;, a single &#145;controlling and directing power&#146; which &#145;having the means of ascertaining, at all times, the actual stock of any kinds of goods in hand, would always be able to say at once where production should proceed more rapidly, where at its own pace and where also it should be retarded&#146;  (Gray, 45). The power to do this would be derived from its control of the means of production (a control to be voluntarily given to it by the owners of land and capital) and would be exercised in particular to ensure that aggregate demand expanded <i>pari passu</i> with aggregate supply, so eliminating the general economic depressions which had bedevilled Britain in the post-Napoleonic wars period. Here we have one of the first examples of an attempt to articulate a political economy of central planning.<br>
<br>The salient themes of <span class="italic">The Social System</span> were to be reiterated in <span class="italic">An Efficient Remedy for the Distress of Nations</span> (1842). However, by 1848 and the publication of his <span class="italic">Lectures on the Nature and Use of Money</span> Gray had abandoned the idea of central planning and his antipathy to competition and had come to believe that a full and efficient utilization of resources could be secured by a fundamental reform of the monetary system. As he put it, &#145;a few salutary monetary laws are all that are wanted&#146;.<br>
<br>Little is known about Gray's private life, in particular the years after 1850. The death on 30 January 1831 of his first wife, Caroline Mordaunt, is recorded on a monument in St Cuthbert's parish churchyard in Edinburgh, and there is mention here too of a second wife, Jane Renny, by whom, together with a married daughter, he was survived. It is also known that, after residing at Faldonside, Galashiels, in the 1840s, he purchased an estate of 26 acres, Bonaly Tower, near Edinburgh, in October 1854. This was sold in 1866, Gray having previously moved to Church Road in Upper Norwood, a part of London which in the 1880s was, as one commentator has put it, &#145;the home of people who thought they were no small beer&#146;. It was here that he died on 26 April 1883, leaving a personal estate of &pound;14,831.<br>
