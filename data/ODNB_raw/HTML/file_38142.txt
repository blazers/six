<span class="headword">Witherings,  Thomas</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1651), <span class="occ">postal administrator</span>, was the second surviving son of Thomas Witherings, a yeoman of Overton, Staffordshire, and his wife, Dorothy, daughter of John Fearne. Nothing is known of his early years or education but by the late 1620s he was apparently trading as a mercer in London, and like his uncle and his elder brother he acted as one of the harbingers to the royal court at Whitehall. This was a lucrative business which helped establish him in an estate in Essex, as well as a larger property in Northamptonshire. It also provided him with the opportunity to ingratiate himself in pursuit of further profit and favour. In 1632 he obtained letters patent for the office of postmaster for foreign posts through the patronage and friendship of one of the principal secretaries of state, Sir John Coke. Operating originally in partnership with William Frizell, and then alone from 1634, Witherings markedly improved the system for dispatch of the English posts on the continent, setting up fixed and regular posts where previously carriage had been entrusted to single operatives who travelled the whole distance themselves in order to make their deliveries.<br>
<br>With Coke's support, Witherings in 1635 submitted proposals for the reform of the inland posts. These were aimed at greatly improving the speed of the service by the introduction of more horse posts, and also made carriage by the royal posts available for the first time to the paying public. In 1637, having overcome the opposition of the patent-holding master of the king's posts, Charles, second Baron Stanhope, Witherings was granted a new commission on 2 June as master of the letter office of England. He was authorized to implement some of his proposed reforms on key strategic routes, greatly improving communications between London, Dublin, and Edinburgh. Under the auspices of Coke's secretaryship, Witherings now held monopolies on the carriage of inland and foreign posts. &#145;So profitable and powerful a monopoly, however efficiently administered, could not last for long&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>): in 1640, with Coke's retirement, the financier Philip Burlamachi supplanted Witherings, who was accused of corruption. At the bidding of Robert Rich, earl of Warwick, the Long Parliament took up the former postmaster's cause, and he obtained restoration to the foreign posts. But in the event the inland posts were acquired from Burlamachi by Edmond Prideaux, who operated the postal system by statutory authority from 1644, exploiting its tremendous tactical potential to the advantage of factional interests aligned with the middle group and the Independents at Westminster.<br>
<br>In 1649 and 1651 Witherings was accused of complicity in Lord Goring's revolt and the naval mutiny of 1648, as well as conveying money, letters, and intelligence to royalists overseas. He was acquitted on both occasions and it is clear that in the meantime he had resumed some formal role in the overseas postal service. His expertise was called on by the council of state, which sought his advice in connection with the establishment of postal communications with the continent. He died on 28 September 1651 while on his way to church in Hornchurch, Essex, and was buried in the chancel of St Andrew's, Hornchurch, beneath a memorial tablet &#145;Sacred to the memory of Thomas Witherings Esq. Chiefe Postmaster of Greate Britaine&#146;. He was survived by his wife, Dorothy Oliver (<i>bap</i>. 1607), and by a son, Thomas, and a daughter, Dorothy. After his death his wife claimed recompense for the large part of her own personal fortune which she claimed had been laid out by her late husband in purchasing and developing the foreign letter office.<br>
