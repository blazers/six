<span class="headword">Adamson,  Joy</span> <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Friederike Viktoria Gessner]</span>  (1910&#150;1980), <span class="occ">conservationist and artist</span>, was born on 20 January 1910 in Troppau, Silesia, the second of the three children of Viktor Gessner (<i>d</i>. 1933/4), civil servant, and his wife, Traute Greipel (1888?&#150;1973). Her mother's family was well off, owning lands and paper factories. After her parents were divorced in 1922 she was brought up by her maternal grandmother in Vienna. She attended a boarding-school for four years and then took a variety of courses, mainly in art and music. At twenty, volatile and troubled, she eloped with the son of a wealthy banker; the affair ended in 1932 leaving her with serious psychological damage, which was not alleviated by periods of psychoanalysis. On 17 January 1944, after two short-lived marriages, between which she emigrated to Kenya, she took as her third husband George Adamson (1906&#150;1989), assistant warden with the Kenya game department.<br>
<br>Joy Adamson's first major undertaking, begun about 1937, was a pioneering project painting east African plants. After initial instruction from her second husband, Peter Bally (<i>b</i>. 1895), a botanist at the Coryndon Museum, Nairobi, she completed a classic series of about 500 scientifically accurate colour paintings, many exceptional for their freshness and vigour. The Royal Horticultural Society in London recognized the outstanding quality of the work, awarding her their Grenfell gold medal in 1947. While accompanying George Adamson on his safaris she became impressed with the urgency of recording the rapidly vanishing rituals and regalia of the peoples of Kenya. Starting in 1948, and always under-funded, although supported for a time by a government commission, she painted about 580 watercolour portraits. Authentic and admirably representative of Kenya's native peoples, these constitute a veritable &#145;Bayeux tapestry&#146;, capturing the &#145;arresting and lasting images&#146; of ways of life now gone  (House, 182). Many are housed in the National Museums of Kenya, Nairobi; some are reproduced in her book <span class="italic">The Peoples of Kenya</span> (1967).<br>
<br>Joy Adamson became famous, however, as the author of the best-selling trilogy <span class="italic">Born Free</span>, <span class="italic">Living Free</span>, and <span class="italic">Forever Free</span> (1960&#150;62), the wonderful story of Elsa the lioness, further popularized in Columbia Film Studio's box-office success, <span class="italic">Born Free</span> (1966). Beginning in 1956 George and Joy Adamson reared the cub Elsa until she reached maturity, successfully released her to the wild, and retained her affection and trust even after she had mated and borne cubs&#151;a unique achievement for the time. Although not scientific in the formal sense, the Adamsons' work was a significant contribution to animal psychology, demonstrating that lions are capable of a far wider range of behaviour than previously assumed. From the broader perspective, <span class="italic">Born Free</span> (books and film) brought a new public awareness of African wildlife and was one of the factors in the rise of the conservation movement. Royalties (&pound;250,000 by the mid-1960s) and funds raised by Joy Adamson's worldwide promotional tours were largely funnelled into the Elsa Conservation Trust, which concentrates especially on conservation in Kenya. In 1977 Joy Adamson was awarded the Austrian cross of honour for science and the arts. She undertook two additional animal studies, successfully rearing and re-establishing in the wild first a cheetah and then a leopard (described in books published in 1969, 1972, and 1980).<br>
<br>Temperamental, restless, autocratic, and so difficult to work with that sooner or later she broke with almost all her close associates, Joy Adamson was nevertheless a vibrant, magnetic personality, handsome in her youth with blond hair and striking blue eyes. She brought energy, tenacity, courage, and vision to her many undertakings. She died at Isiolo, Kenya, on 3 January 1980, of stab wounds inflicted during an altercation with a disgruntled former employee. Her body was cremated at Nairobi crematorium and her ashes were placed on the graves of Elsa the lioness and Pippa the cheetah in Meru National Park, Kenya.<br>
