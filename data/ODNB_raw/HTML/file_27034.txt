<span class="headword">Taylor,  Isaac</span> <span class="st"> [<em>known as </em>Isaac Taylor of Stanford Rivers]</span>  (1787&#150;1865), <span class="occ">writer on theology, artist, and inventor</span>, was born at Lavenham, Suffolk, on 17 August 1787. He was the fourth child and eldest surviving son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27033/', "Isaac Taylor of Ongar (1759&#150;1829)")</script>, artist, engraver, and dissenting minister, and his wife, Ann Martin (1757&#150;1830) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27018/', "Taylor, Ann")</script>], author of several advice and conduct books. The family moved to Colchester in 1796 when the senior Taylor was called as pastor of an independent congregation; in 1810 they moved to another Essex pastorate in Ongar.<br>
<br>The three sons and three daughters of the Taylor family were educated together at home. All were taught drawing and engraving by their father; both parents shared in directing reading, discussions, and religious instruction. While living in Colchester, Isaac and his brother Martin went to a neighbour for some instruction and attended lectures by visiting speakers. All the children were encouraged to write and to make drawings and engravings, first for the family circle and then for publication. By the turn of the century the elder daughters, Ann and Jane [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27039/', "Taylor, Jane")</script>], were beginning to publish verses and stories for children in periodicals and in book form. These works were illustrated by various family members including Isaac; most probably the entire family also contributed to the stories. After the move to Ongar, Isaac the younger executed engraving and drawing commissions and worked with his father on several projects. In 1810 he joined Martin in London, where they worked as engravers for a publishing house in Paternoster Row.<br>
<br>London air did not agree with Isaac; by 1812 he had developed a pulmonary or bronchial complaint which responded favourably to the milder climate of the west of England. He spent the next three or four winters at Ilfracombe, Devon, and Marazion, Cornwall. His sister Jane was his primary companion during this period; they became close friends and confidants. Isaac encouraged Jane in her writing, and she listened to his ideas and plans. In the summers they returned to Essex and made visits to London. Taylor's time was spent in reading, writing, and discussions with friends made in the west. It was probably during this period that he became attracted to the Church of England, although he may not have become a member until after Jane's death. Taylor also began his lifelong interest in the early church and patristic studies in this period. He is said to have coined the word patristic.<br>
<br>In 1818 Josiah Conder, editor of the <span class="italic">Eclectic Review</span>, invited Taylor to join his staff as a regular contributor. Conder was a family friend who had been publishing the work of Ann Taylor Gilbert and Jane Taylor for several years. While continuing his study of the writers of the early church Taylor also became interested in the philosophy of Francis Bacon. His first independently published work, <span class="italic">Elements of Thought</span> (1822), was an introduction to the study of moral philosophy for young people. His second work, a new translation of the <span class="italic">Characters of Theophrastus</span> (1824), appeared pseudonymously under the name Francis Howell. The first edition included the Greek text and illustrations by Taylor. He continued to live at Ongar, making visits when necessary to London. The death of Jane in 1824 precipitated several changes in her brother's life.<br>
<br>Taylor was his sister's literary executor. In 1825 he published <span class="italic">Memoirs and Poetical Remains of the Late Jane Taylor</span>. A revised memoir, correspondence, and other family sketches were published by Isaac's son, also Isaac Taylor, as <span class="italic">The Family Pen: Memorials, Biographical and Literary, of the Taylor Family of Ongar</span> (2 vols., 1867). Taylor moved to Stanford Rivers, about 2 miles from Ongar, in 1825. According to his son, the &#145;rambling old-fashioned farmhouse, standing in a large garden&#146;, provided seclusion and space for the &#145;literary labours&#146; and &#145;silent meditations&#146; of a &#145;literary recluse&#146;  (Taylor, 1.65). On 17 August 1825 he married Elizabeth (1804&#150;1861), second daughter of James Medland of Newington; she had been a friend and correspondent of Jane Taylor. For the remainder of his life Taylor lived at Stanford Rivers with his wife and large family. Six daughters (Jane, Phoebe, Rose, Catherine, Jessie, Euphemia) and three sons (Isaac, James Medland, Henry) survived their father; two daughters predeceased their parents. The children were educated at home: in <span class="italic">Home Education</span> (1838) his method and plan for training children from infancy to the late teens were outlined. He encouraged flexibility and attention to the varying talents and abilities of children. He was opposed to schools for girls and compulsory public education.<br>
<br>Although Taylor always maintained that because he was a layman he was not a theologian, most of his publications were concerned with Christianity, its doctrines and history, and the various manifestations of church organization and teachings. He argued in favour of the historical validity of the <span class="roman">Bible</span> in <span class="italic">History of the Transmission of Ancient Books to Modern Times</span> (1827) and <span class="italic">The Process of Historical Proof</span> (1828), urging that the same methods be applied to scripture as to pagan Greek histories. His interest in textual studies of the classics and the <span class="roman">Bible</span> continued throughout his life. In 1829 Taylor published his abridged translation of Herodotus; he edited a new translation of <span class="italic">The Jewish Wars of Flavius Josephus</span> (2 vols., 1849&#150;51). At the end of his life <span class="italic">The Spirit of Hebrew Poetry</span> (1861) and <span class="italic">Considerations on the Pentateuch</span> (1863) reflected this aspect of his studies. He was not, however, trained in modern critical methods, so that his arguments in the end rested primarily on moral grounds. The <span class="roman">Bible</span> must be true because it was pure, beautiful, and morally right.<br>
<br>The work which made Taylor's reputation was <span class="italic">The Natural History of Enthusiasm</span> (1829). Responding to the social, political, and religious ferment of his own day, he set out the dangers inherent in all sorts of excessive enthusiasm. His path was the Anglican middle way; the belief that the study of scripture and moderation would mean the victory of protestant Christianity. Many of his later works continued this theme. <span class="italic">Fanaticism</span> (1833), <span class="italic">Spiritual Despotism</span> (1835), and <span class="italic">Four Lectures on Spiritual Christianity</span> (1841) all stressed the need to return to scripture and the advantages of Anglican polity. Two studies of religious leaders, <span class="italic">Loyola</span> (1849) and <span class="italic">Wesley and Methodism</span> (1851), continued Taylor's arguments that the best kind of religious establishment was to be found in the Anglican model.<br>
<br>The Oxford Movement's use of the early church to support its proposals for reforming the Church of England took Taylor back to his patristic studies. His vehement and lengthy attack on the Tractarians, <span class="italic">Ancient Christianity, and the Doctrines of the Oxford &#145;Tracts for the Times&#146;</span> (2 vols., 1839&#150;40) attempted to prove that Puseyite doctrine was already permeated with all the errors and superstitions of the middle ages. His views were attacked or praised according to the convictions of the reader.<br>
<br>By the mid-1830s Taylor's works were highly regarded by many serious students of theology and philosophy. In 1836 he was urged to stand for election to the chair of logic at the University of Edinburgh. This seems to have been the only time he was tempted to leave his retreat at Stanford Rivers. He allowed his name to be put forward, but he was narrowly defeated by Sir William Hamilton. According to his son he was asked to stand for other Scottish chairs, but he never again considered such a post.<br>
<br>Taylor seldom left Stanford Rivers except to give lectures or to make an occasional visit to a family member. As a change from reading and writing he took long solitary walks and worked in his shop. In 1824 he patented a widely used beer tap. He also developed a machine for engraving on copper, patented in 1848. Although he lost considerable sums on this invention, it was ultimately adapted for engraving patterns on copper cylinders used in printing calicos. In 1862 he received a civil-list pension of &pound;200 a year. He died at Stanford Rivers on 28 June 1865 and was buried in the churchyard there.<br>
<br>A liberal Anglican of an old-fashioned type, Taylor's ideas about religion, education, and society were grounded in the eighteenth century and showed little awareness of the changes taking place in his own day. None the less his works were popular in both Britain and the United States; his straightforward style and lack of sectarianism commended him to many protestants. But advances in scholarship, science, and economics made many of his views seem irrelevant and outdated by the latter part of the nineteenth century. His rural seclusion allowed him to cultivate &#145;the breadth and catholicity of his religious feelings, and the calm judicial tone of his literary temper&#146;  (Taylor, 1.76), but it also sheltered him from many contemporary realities. He was, however, the most prolific and best-known member of a remarkable family.<br>
