<span class="headword">Plautius,  Aulus</span>  (<em>fl. </em><span class="smallcap">AD</span> 29&#150;57), <span class="occ">Roman governor of Britain</span>, was the son of Aulus Plautius (consul in 1 <span class="smallcap">BC</span>) and Vitellia. His younger brother Quintus Plautius was consul in <span class="smallcap">AD</span> 36, and a sister, Plautia, was married to Publius Petronius (consul in <span class="smallcap">AD</span> 19). The family home was Trebula Suffenas, near Tibur (Tivoli). Plautius, in common with Quintus Veranius, governor of Britain in <span class="smallcap">AD</span> 57&#150;8, and the emperor Aulus Vitellius, was one of the last Romans not to have a cognomen (third name). From the reign of Claudius onwards it became standard for all male Roman citizens to bear three names&#151;the Plautii, Veranii, and Vitellii were no doubt consciously old-fashioned in this respect, using the simple form with just praenomen (forename) and nomen (family name), as in the early centuries of Roman history. Plautius's chief claim to fame is that he commanded the invasion force which conquered much of southern Britain between <span class="smallcap">AD</span> 43 and 47 and, as the first governor (<i>legatus</i> <i>Augusti</i> <i>pro praetore</i>), established the Roman province of Britannia. Even though little is known of his previous experience, his selection for this major undertaking by the emperor Claudius, whose position was still very insecure, can readily be explained. His family had long been closely linked with the Claudii; and a cousin of Plautius, Urgulanilla, had been married to the emperor. The Plautii were also intermarried with two families, the Petronii and Vitellii, who were highly regarded by Claudius. Plautius was probably born <i>c</i>.10 <span class="smallcap">BC</span>, at the earliest. All that is known of his career before his consulship in <span class="smallcap">AD</span> 29 is that he played some part in suppressing a slave uprising in Apulia in the early 20s. At the beginning of Claudius's reign (<span class="smallcap">AD</span> 41), Plautius was governing the important military province of Pannonia (Hungary). In this capacity he must have shown his loyalty when the governor of the neighbouring province, Dalmatia, attempted a <i>coup d'&eacute;tat</i> against Claudius in <span class="smallcap">AD</span> 42.<br>
<br>The bulk of Plautius's invasion army was supplied by the Rhine garrison, which contributed three legions, while he brought one of his Pannonian legions, IX Hispana. After a delay in embarkation at Gesoriacum (Boulogne), caused by a mutiny, the expeditionary force landed without encountering opposition and advanced through what is now Kent. The first serious conflict took place at the crossing of the Medway; the British leader Togodumnus died from wounds received there shortly afterwards, leaving his brother Caratacus in sole command of British resistance. After crossing the Thames, Plautius invited the emperor to join him. In the interval before Claudius arrived, parts of south-west Britain were probably subdued by one of the legionary commanders, the future emperor Vespasian, legate of II Augusta, who is credited with capturing Vectis (Isle of Wight). Other peoples, including the Dobunni of the Cotswolds, had submitted voluntarily. Claudius spent sixteen days in Britain, entering Camulodunum (Colchester), Caratacus's capital, in triumph, and receiving the submission of eleven British rulers. These certainly included those of the Dobunni, the Iceni (East Anglia), and the Brigantes (Pennines), and the previously pro-Roman Britons of modern Hampshire and Sussex, whose ruler, Cogidubnus was later commemorated for his loyalty to Rome by Tacitus; an inscription at Chichester shows that he had been granted Roman citizenship  (Collingwood and Wright, RIB 91). Plautius remained in Britain for a further four years. No details are recorded of his activity, but on his return to Rome in <span class="smallcap">AD</span> 47 he was granted an <i>ovatio</i> (minor triumph), the last non-member of an imperial house to be so honoured. Archaeological evidence suggests that he had extended direct Roman control over southern Britain to a line approximately marked by the Roman road now known as the Fosse Way (between Exeter and Lincoln). Parts of this area were retained by native rulers as clients of Rome, a status also accepted by the Brigantes of the Pennines, the largest people in Britain. But resistance continued, led by Caratacus, who was still operating in Wales when Plautius was replaced by Ostorius Scapula.<br>
<br>Plautius is mentioned twice more during his later years. In <span class="smallcap">AD</span> 48 his prestige was sufficient to protect his nephew Plautius Lateranus, one of Messalina's lovers, after the empress's downfall. Plautius's wife, Pomponia Graecina, was &#145;accused of practising a foreign religion&#146;  (Tacitus, <span class="italic">Annals</span>, xiii.32) in <span class="smallcap">AD</span> 57. Plautius, who claimed the traditional right to try her himself, found her innocent. Pomponia and Plautius himself have often been claimed as Christians on the strength of this story in Tacitus, but there is no direct evidence. At about this time a young man also called Aulus Plautius, who may have been his son, was put to death by Nero: he had been a lover of Nero's mother Agrippina and was suspected of plotting treason. A nephew of Plautius, Petronius Turpilianus, was appointed governor of Britain after the bloody suppression of Boudicca's revolt: he had probably inherited the ties of patronage that Plautius had built up with British notables. At any rate, Plautius may be assumed to have died before <span class="smallcap">AD</span> 65, for he is not mentioned by Tacitus in connection with the execution of his other nephew, Lateranus, in that year. His widow Pomponia survived until <span class="smallcap">AD</span> 83. No direct descendants are recorded; the Plautii are last heard of in the 130s, when Plautius Lamia Silvanus was son-in-law of the future emperor Antoninus Pius.<br>
