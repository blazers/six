<span class="headword">Forbes, Sir  William, of Craigievar</span>, first baronet  (<em>d.</em> 1648), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was the eldest son of William Forbes (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1627), of Menie, later of Craigievar, Aberdeenshire, and his wife, Margaret Udward or Edward, daughter of the provost of Edinburgh; his parents had married in 1603. His father, known as Merchant Willie or Dantzig Willie, was a younger brother of Patrick Forbes of Corse, from 1618 bishop of Aberdeen and uncle of the eirenicist John Forbes of Corse. William was served heir to his father for his lands of Craigievar on 24 March 1629. His inheritance included Craigievar Castle, begun in the Flemish style by the Mortimer family but sold to Merchant Willie in 1610 and only completed in 1626. On 30 April 1630, ostensibly for his loyalty but more probably for his money, Charles I created William a baronet of Nova Scotia. In 1635 Forbes married Bathia (<i>d</i>. after 1649), second daughter of Sir Archibald Murray of Blackbarony; they had two sons and three daughters.<br>
<br>Sir William had been appointed a justice of the peace for Aberdeenshire in 1634, but it was through the civil strife that engulfed Scotland over the signing of the national covenant of 1638 that he became a figure of importance, not just in local but also in national affairs. From an early stage of the dispute, in spite of his earlier favour with the king and the Episcopalian tendencies of his kinsmen of Corse, Sir William took the side of the covenanters against the supporters of the king. In 1638, for instance, he used his patronage of the wealthy parsonage of Kincardine to secure the submission to the Glasgow assembly of his younger brother John Forbes, whose opposition to the covenant was driving him to leave Scotland for Ireland. From 1641 onwards Sir William was prominent on the committees through which the covenanters sought to govern Scottish affairs. In that year he was appointed a commissioner for receiving brotherly assistance from the parliament of England and for conserving the treaty, and a commissioner for manufactures. In 1643 he was appointed to the committee for the loan and tax, and to that for war, also serving on the latter in 1644, 1646, and 1648. In 1644 he was also appointed to the committees for the north, for propositions of peace, and for negotiating with Sweden. He served on the committee of estates in 1644&#150;5. He was on the committee on losses in 1645 and the commission of visitation to Aberdeen University in 1645&#150;6, was a commissioner for re-evaluation of Aberdeenshire in 1647, and was appointed sheriff of Aberdeen in 1647. He was granted &pound;10,000 Scots in reparation for war-related losses in 1647 and had the barony of Logiefintray ratified to him by parliament in 1648, but he appears soon afterwards to have suffered a downturn in fortune and favour. Despite his being elected a commissioner of parliament for Aberdeenshire in 1648, another commissioner took his place.<br>
<br>An eighteenth-century descendant claimed that Forbes, ultimately sickened by the depredations of the covenanters, sought to distance himself from them and, gathering his wealth, planned to put it and himself at the service of the king. The covenanters forestalled this by stripping him of his assets on the pretext of acting for the public good. So affected by this turn of events was Sir William that he died soon afterwards, between 19 June and 13 September 1648, allegedly of a broken heart. His wife survived him, and his twelve-year-old son and heir, John, became liable for payment of significant debts when, in 1653, Alexander Lindsay succeeded in having the family patrimony apprized to the value of &pound;44,612 Scots.<br>
