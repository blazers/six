<span class="headword">Highmore,  Anthony</span>  (1758/9&#150;1829), <span class="occ">legal writer</span>, was born in London, the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13245/', "Anthony Highmore (1718&#150;1799)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13247/', "Highmore, Joseph")</script>], draughtsman, and grandson of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13247/', "Joseph Highmore")</script>, the painter. From 1766 he was educated at a school in Greenwich, and he commenced practice as a solicitor in 1783. Although he worked for over forty years as a solicitor, Highmore, a devout Christian, devoted much of his spare time to the management of charitable concerns and served as secretary to the London Lying-In Hospital. In addition he also moved in radical parliamentary circles; in particular Highmore was an intimate friend of Granville Sharp, and was active in opposition to the slave trade.<br>
<br>Besides contributing to the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span>, Highmore also wrote a number of works on legal and social issues. His earliest was a digest of the law relating to the use of bail in civil and criminal cases (1783). <span class="italic">A Succinct View of the History of Mortmain</span> appeared in 1787, and explored its charitable uses. This was judged to be a pioneering work: a contemporary referred to &#145;his little book, but great work&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 181). Early in the following decade Highmore published his <span class="italic">Reflections</span> (1791) on the law of libel. In this he was an ally of Charles James Fox who, the following year, gave the issue greater prominence when he persuaded the Commons to pass a bill giving juries full powers in legal actions. In 1793 Highmore brought out <span class="italic">Addenda to the Law of Charitable Uses</span>, and also an account of the laws relating to the excise.<br>
<br>During the alarm created by the threatened French invasion Highmore became a member of the Honourable Artillery Company, and in 1804 he wrote a history of the company, at the suggestion of its court of assistants. In 1808 a bill was brought before parliament to prevent the spreading of smallpox. This stipulated that no medical practitioner was to inoculate for the smallpox within 3 miles of any town, and provisions were made for isolating smallpox patients. Highmore, though a believer in vaccination, wrote a pamphlet opposing the terms of the bill, as amended by the Commons, in 1808.<br>
<br>Among Highmore's legal treatises was one on the law of lunacy (1807), a pocket book for attorneys and solicitors (1814), and a guide to the executors of wills and codicils on how to keep accounts and administer the estates of the deceased (1815). He also wrote further works about charities. <span class="italic">Pietas Londinensis</span> (1810) was a history of public charities in and near London; a second volume, <span class="italic">Philanthropia Metropolitana</span> (1822), gave an account of the charitable institutions established in London between 1810 and 1822. Highmore died at Dulwich, Surrey, on 19 July 1829, in his seventy-first year.<br>
