<span class="headword">Muir, Sir  William</span>  (1819&#150;1905), <span class="occ">administrator in India and Islamicist</span>, born on 27 April 1819 in Glasgow, was the youngest child of William Muir (1783&#150;1820), a Glasgow merchant, and his wife, Helen Macfie (1784&#150;1866), of Ayrshire. The Sanskrit scholar <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/19497/', "John Muir (1810&#150;1882)")</script> was his eldest brother. Widowed in 1820, his mother took her four surviving sons and four daughters to Kilmarnock, where William received a sound education at Kilmarnock Academy. He then studied briefly at both Edinburgh and Glasgow universities. Before he was able to graduate he entered East India College, Haileybury, on the nomination of his mother's uncle Sir James Shaw, a former lord mayor of London, who through company contacts obtained nominations as writers or cadets for his indigent nephews. Of the three brothers who had preceded William to Haileybury, two, James and Mungo, died after a short service in India.<br>
<br>After his arrival in India in 1837 Muir was posted to the North-Western Provinces, and remained identified with that region for the next thirty-nine years, notably as its lieutenant-governor in the 1870s. He married, on 7 February 1840, Elizabeth Huntly (<i>d</i>. 1897), daughter of James Wemyss, collector of Cawnpore. A series of junior postings in the revenue and judicial services in Cawnpore, Bundelkhand, and Fatehpur districts, which included responsibility for the settlement report on Hamirpur (1842), was followed by posts in the provincial capital of Agra, first as secretary to the board of revenue in 1848, and then, from 1852, as secretary to Lieutenant-Governor James Thomason, with whose evangelicalism and administrative innovations in the fields of land revenue and education he was very sympathetic. His first twenty years of Indian service proved him sound rather than exceptional.<br>
<br>The sepoy mutiny and subsequent civil uprising of 1857&#150;9 provided Muir with greater scope for initiative. On the death of Lieutenant-Governor John Russell Colvin shortly after rebel advances had necessitated the withdrawal of the European community into the Agra Fort, local responsibility was devolved to three middle-ranking civilians, including Muir. Special responsibility for intelligence made Muir also the nerve-centre for communications within and outside the region of revolt until British recovery began. His intelligence correspondence, an important source for understanding the nature and course of the rising up to January 1858, is deposited in Edinburgh University Library. Muir also wrote a memoir for his children entitled <span class="italic">Agra in the Mutiny</span> which was published privately nearly forty years later.<br>
<br>While his reliability during the 1857 crisis drew him to the governor-general's attention&#151;Lord Canning appointed him his secretary when the government was transferred to Allahabad in early 1858&#151;Muir's career followed a steady rather than a dramatic course for a further ten years, notably on the provincial board of revenue from 1859 to 1865 and as foreign secretary to the government of India from 1865 to 1868. Although he was made KCSI in 1867, he had been passed over for the lieutenant-governorship of the North-Western Provinces in 1864. If his rather self-effacing character seemed to hold him back, in 1868 his rapport with the viceroy, John Lawrence, finally resulted in the provincial governorship; this appointment was extended until 1874 because of his reputation for maintaining stability. During his final two years in India, Muir was financial member of Lord Northbrook's council in Calcutta. He retired to Britain in late 1876 but continued to play an active role in Indian affairs until 1885, as a member of the Council of India in London. He was then appointed principal of Edinburgh University, his alma mater, retiring in 1903, aged eighty-four, with a reputation for benevolent scholarly patronage rather than for innovation. The Muir Institute, where oriental languages are still taught, commemorates the encouragement given by the Muir brothers, through the endowment of chairs and prizes, to the study of these languages in Edinburgh University.<br>
<br>The entry on Muir in the <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span> stressed his contribution to the stabilization of land revenue problems in north-west India after the convulsions of 1857&#150;9. While Muir deserves credit for this, other aspects of his career proved of longer-term significance, notably his Islamic scholarship and his educational endeavours, both in India and in Scotland. On the base provided by his predecessor, Thomason, he attempted to improve the educational provision in the north-west of India, his interests ranging from village vernacular schemes and female education to university provision for the &eacute;lites of the region. His preoccupation with higher education reflected partly his perception of these &eacute;lites, particularly the Muslims, as bulwarks of the raj in the north-west, and partly his evangelical conviction that education would be conducive to social reform and hence to &#145;civilization&#146;, and even to his personal goal of the reception of Christian values. The Muir Central College, opened in Allahabad in 1872, marked the fruition of one of his plans when it became, in 1886, the core college for the province's first university. Muir was unsuccessful, however, in efforts to re-establish Persian as a medium of higher education alongside English, although his support for their interests won him the friendship of some influential members of the Muslim &eacute;lites, notably the &#145;modernist&#146; Sir Saiyid Ahmad Khan and the nawab of Rampur state. His motives were questioned, however, by those&#151;Saiyid Ahmad Khan among them&#151;who found that his scholarly but evangelical critiques of Islamic civilization and history conflicted with Muslim values.<br>
<br>Muir's publications on Islam were certainly controversial, but because he was the first British scholar to attempt a popular interpretation of Islamic history based on study of the Arabic sources, they were widely regarded as authoritative during the colonial era. While he acknowledged the influence of German Islamicists (notably Gustav Weil), Muir's work, notwithstanding its overt evangelical perspective, is original in many of its linguistic and historical assessments, which reflect sound Arabic learning. His <span class="italic">Life of Mahomet: History of Islam to the Era of the Hegira</span> (4 vols., 1858&#150;61) was based on his own translation of the <span class="roman">Koran</span> and on his study of the Hadith collections and early Arabic biographies of the Prophet. It became the standard English biography, going through several editions in the nineteenth century and provoking retorts from Indian Muslim scholars. Less controversial in his own day, though criticized in the late twentieth century for an &#145;orientalist&#146; perspective, were his Middle Eastern histories&#151;notably <span class="italic">Annals of the Early Caliphate</span> (1883) and <span class="italic">The Caliphate: its Rise, Decline and Fall</span> (1891)&#151;also based on Arabic sources. His scholarship was recognized by election as president of the Royal Asiatic Society in 1884, and by the award of the society's triennial jubilee gold medal in 1903. Other academic honours included the honorary degrees of DCL of Oxford (1882), LLD of Edinburgh and Glasgow, and DPhil of Bologna (1888).<br>
<br>Throughout his career in India, but especially in retirement, Muir used his scholarship to support evangelical efforts to gain influence among Muslims. As a junior officer he had attended missionary debates with Muslims, later assisting the evangelical cause with publications such as <span class="italic">Testimony Borne by the Coran to the Jewish and Christian Scriptures</span> (1860) and <span class="italic">The Old and New Testaments, Tourat, Zubur and Gospel: Moslems Invited to See and Read them</span> (1899). The practical help he extended to the tiny Christian convert community in northern India was commemorated at Muirabad, a village established near Allahabad for Christian victims of famine.<br>
<br>Muir died at his home, Dean Park House, Queensferry Road, Edinburgh, on 11 July 1905, and was buried in Dean cemetery. His wife had died in 1897. Their correspondence over half a century reveals a devotedly close marriage. Of fifteen children, all born in India, several sons served in the Indian army, though none reached their father's prominence.<br>
<br>Unusually, there was no biography or memorial publication. Though firmly within the &#145;paternalist&#146; tradition of late nineteenth-century Indian governors, William Muir presents the paradox of a scholar drawn irresistibly to the Arabic literary heritage and to close friendships with individual Muslims, who nevertheless felt compelled by his religious convictions to denigrate Muslim beliefs and social institutions in both their Arabian and Indian settings. His lieutenant-governorship, at a time of growing tension for Indian Muslims, merits some further study.<br>
