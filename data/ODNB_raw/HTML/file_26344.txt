<span class="headword">Steele,  Christopher</span> <span class="st"> [<em>called </em> the Count, Count Steele]</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1733, <em>d.</em> 1767), <span class="occ">portrait painter</span>, was baptized on 9 July 1733 at Acre Walls, Widdeker, St Bees, Cumberland, the second of the six children of John Steele (<i>c</i>.1700&#150;<i>c</i>.1770), tallow chandler, and his wife, Katherine Denton, daughter of Christopher Denton, rector, and his wife, Isobelle Sherwin. His artistic precocity caused his parents to send him to study art under the marine painter Richard Wright of Liverpool in the late 1740s. He then studied in Paris under Carle van Loo, brother of Jean Baptiste van Loo, for a year or more, returning with the dandified extravagant manners and dress which earned him the sobriquet &#145;the Count&#146;, or &#145;Count Steele&#146;.<br>
<br>Having unsuccessfully tried to set up a studio in York, Steele went to Kendal in the Lake District about 1750 and took a room in Redmayne's Yard, from Alderman Redmayne, whose nephew was the painter Daniel Gardner. Gardner was a neighbour of John Romney, whose son George was showing some artistic talent. Both Gardner and George Romney came to work in the studio under Steele, the latter being apprenticed on 20 March 1755 for four years at a fee of &pound;21. The two young men worked together, each having an influence on the other. Their similarities in style are evident in their clarity of line and pure fresh flesh tones, and in their depiction of textiles. Steele then fell in love and eloped with another pupil, Amy Grundy (<i>d</i>. 1761), and moved for nine months to York, where he painted Laurence Sterne. Romney joined him in York but a shortage of commissions led to the termination of his apprenticeship when Romney waived the debt of &pound;10 owing to him. In July 1757 Steele moved to Lancaster and then to Dublin, setting up studios in both places, though no work has been found from his time in Ireland. From 1758 Steele and his wife travelled for two years between Liverpool, Egremont (Cumberland), and Manchester. In 1760, together with the artist's sister Isabella, they bought The Woodcocks, a house near Middlewich, Cheshire. Steele's debts increased and on 30 December 1761 Amy Steele died. In 1762 he made a will in favour of Isabella, with instructions for the income to go to his father for his lifetime, and set sail for the West Indies. He returned to Egremont in 1767 and died on 1 September. He was buried in Egremont. Because of his carefree and generous attitude Steele had often been described as extravagant and even &#145;drunk&#146;. However, a letter from his younger brother Peter Steele ameliorates the &#145;unfriendly plaistering&#146; Steele received from Mr Cumberland in the <span class="italic">European Magazine</span> (43, 1803), acknowledging that while his brother was &#145;poor and frequently distressed&#146; and that this &#145;proceeded from too great generosity and want of proper economy&#146; he also suffered from &#145;a debility of mind and body which produced epilepsy and all its concomitants so that he died a little above 30&#146;  (Burkett, 202).<br>
<br>Up to thirty-eight portraits by Steele have been identified, some by signature, or on stylistic or other grounds. Most were painted between the years 1750 and 1760 and are in private ownership; however, <span class="italic">Giles Moore</span> (<i>c</i>.1758) is in the Newark Museum, New Jersey, while Abbot Hall Art Gallery, Kendal, owns <span class="italic">Elin Machell</span> (<i>c</i>.1753), <span class="italic">Thomas Machell</span> (<i>c</i>.1755), and <span class="italic">Portrait of a Child</span>. On four paintings appear the letters &#145;a.r.g.c.&#146;, for which no explanation has been found. In addition to his consistently well-painted <i>&#339;uvre</i> (which includes delightful portraits of children such as <span class="italic">Martha Rodes</span> of 1750, <span class="italic">Mary Wilkinson</span>, and <span class="italic">John Wilson of Evening Hill</span>, all priv. coll.), Steele is also to be remembered for his influence on George Romney.<br>
