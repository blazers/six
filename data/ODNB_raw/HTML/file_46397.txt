<span class="headword">Cane,  Stephen Percival <span class="st"> [Percy]</span></span>  (1881&#150;1976), <span class="occ">garden designer and writer</span>, was born on 20 September 1881 at High Street, Braintree, Essex, the eldest of the five children of William Stephen Cane, a corn dealer, and his wife, Ellen Wagstaff. He spent his childhood at Bocking Mill on the River Blackwater, near Braintree, and was educated privately from 1891 at a school run by Lygon Graham Pakenham. From February 1903 to January 1908 he worked for Crittalls, the firm of window manufacturers owned by family friends. A visit to the garden at Easton Lodge, designed in 1902 by Harold Peto (1854&#150;1933) for the countess of Warwick, inspired him to become a garden designer.<br>
<br>Cane left Crittalls and enrolled at Chelmsford College of Science and Art to study art and architecture. The principal, C. H. Baskett, offered him an introduction to the secretary of the Architectural Association, F. R. Yerbury. Cane arranged to study part-time, as a pupil of one of the senior students, Stephen Rowland Pierce (1896&#150;1966), who was later vice-president of the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA) from 1951 to 1955. He began a career in journalism in 1915 by writing for <span class="italic">My Garden, Illustrated</span>, a monthly magazine which he owned and edited from May 1918 to June 1920. He finished his training by studying at the Chelmsford County School of Horticulture in 1918, and by 1919 was established in London as a garden architect.<br>
<br>Within a decade Cane had become one of the most sought-after designers of his day, and had received commissions for Llannerch Park, north Wales (1927&#150;9); Ivy House, Hampstead, for Anna Pavlova (1926); Bodens Ride, Ascot (1929); and Hascombe Court, Godalming (1928&#150;9). He designed gardens in Britain, France, Austria, and Greece, for the British pavilion at the New York World Fair (1939), for the King's House, Burhill, for the Royal Warrant Holders' Association (1935), and for Hungerdown House, Seagry, Wiltshire (1945&#150;6). After the Second World War he received a number of large commissions, which gave him the scope to design on a grand scale: Falkland Palace, Fife (1947); the imperial palace, Addis Ababa, for Emperor Haile Selassie (1955); and his most important undertaking, Dartington Hall, Devon, for Leonard and Dorothy Elmhirst (from 1945 onwards), where his work survives in excellent condition. Westfields, at Oakley in Bedfordshire (1953&#150;64), has all the characteristic Cane features at their best: a glade of flowering trees and shrubs, a rock and water garden of Westmorland stone, a formal lily pool, and a paved rose garden. The artist Harold White illustrated Cane's design proposals from the 1920s to the 1950s. The landscape architect and pioneer of the modern movement in gardens Christopher Tunnard (1910&#150;1979) and Frank Clark (1902&#150;1971), landscape designer, author, and teacher, were both articled to Cane from 1932 to late 1934.<br>
<br>Cane worked mainly in the larger private gardens, and remained one of the most prominent designers from the 1930s to the 1950s. His commissions provided the material for his books on garden design: <span class="italic">Modern Gardens, British and Foreign</span> (1926&#150;7), <span class="italic">Garden Design of Today</span> (1934), <span class="italic">The Earth is my Canvas</span> (1956), and <span class="italic">The Creative Art of Garden Design</span> (1967). He contributed articles on gardens to <span class="italic">The Studio</span> magazine during the 1920s and from 1930 to 1938 served as founder editor of the quarterly journal <span class="italic">Garden Design</span>. From 1921 until 1953 he exhibited regularly at the Chelsea flower show, where he was awarded eight gold (1936, 1937, 1938, 1947, 1948, 1949, 1951, 1952) and three silver-gilt medals (1934, 1935, 1950). Although very much a lone worker, he was appreciative of contemporary designers; at one stage he joined the Institute of Landscape Architects but later resigned. A small, reserved, dapper man, he was a perfectionist in his work. Modest and courteous in character, he allowed his social life to revolve round his career, and he never married.<br>
<br>In 1926 Cane described successful garden design as<blockquote>the inclusion of formal terraces and gardens suitable to the character of the house, and the relation and contrast of these with beautifully balanced glades and planting &hellip; It is the harmonious relation of the garden to the house, and of the gardens to the surrounding scenery. (<span class="italic">Modern Gardens, British and Foreign</span>, 1926&#150;7, 1&#150;2)</blockquote>He drew inspiration from the Italianate garden designs of Peto and greatly admired the aesthetics and carefully prescribed rules of Japanese gardens. He chose shrubs and trees of Japanese origin&#151;evergreen azaleas, maples, and flowering cherries&#151;and his rock and water gardens were often designed in the Japanese spirit, with a precise placing of rocks and shrubs and an atmosphere of elegant reserve. Cane coined the use of the word glade and gave it a particular significance in the context of his garden designs: with curving borders of ornamental trees and shrubs, glades were a manageable alternative to labour-intensive bedding schemes. Cane was concerned about cost-effective garden schemes: in April 1957 he took part in a symposium promoted by the Royal Horticultural Society entitled &#145;Garden design in relation to reduction of labour and maintenance costs&#146;, with Brenda Colvin and L. Milner White.<br>
<br>In 1963 Cane was awarded the Royal Horticultural Society's Veitch memorial medal for his work as a designer of gardens and a landscape architect. He continued to practise as a garden architect in London until September 1972, when he suffered a severe stroke. He spent his last years in a nursing home, Eastfield House, Whitchurch, Oxfordshire, paid for by the Elmgrant Trust, and died on 23 February 1976 in St Mary's Hospital, Wallingford, Oxfordshire.<br>
