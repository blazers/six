<span class="headword">Stuart,  Henry Windsor Villiers</span>  (1827&#150;1895), <span class="occ">politician</span>, born on 13 September 1827, was the only son of Henry Villiers Stuart, first Baron Stuart de Decies (1803&#150;1874). His mother was Theresia Pauline Ott, of Vienna (<i>d</i>. 1867), said to have been married to his father in 1826, but the marriage was never legally recognized. On his father's death Stuart claimed the barony and was shocked to find no proof of his parents' marriage was accepted. However, he succeeded to his father's estates. Stuart was educated at University College, Durham, graduating in 1850. He was ordained the same year, and appointed vicar of Bulkington, Warwickshire, in 1854, and of Napton on the Hill, Southam, Warwickshire, in 1855. On 3 August 1865 he married Mary, second daughter of Ambrose Power, archdeacon of Lismore, and his wife, Susan Thacker of Ballymelish; they had five sons and four daughters.<br>
<br>From 1871 to 1874 Stuart was vice-lieutenant of co. Waterford, and, on his father's death in the latter year, succeeded to the property of Dromana near Cappoquin in that county. In 1873 he surrendered his holy orders and successfully contested co. Waterford for parliament as a Liberal, holding the seat until 1885. At the general election of 1885 he contested East Cork as a Unionist, but was defeated.<br>
<br>Stuart travelled extensively, and published many accounts of his wanderings, notably <span class="italic">Adventures amid the Equatorial Forests and Rivers of South America</span> (1891). He was in South America in 1858, in Jamaica in 1881, and he made several journeys through Egypt, and published various works on ancient and modern Egypt. After the English occupation of Egypt he was attached to Lord Dufferin's mission of reconstruction, and in the spring of 1883 was commissioned to investigate the condition of the country. His work received the special recognition of Lord Dufferin, and his reports were published as a parliamentary blue book  (<span class="italic">Parl. papers</span>, 1883, 83, C 3554). He took a keen interest in Egyptian exploration, and was a member of the Society of Biblical Archaeology. He was also a member of the committee of the Royal Literary Fund.<br>
<br>Stuart was drowned on 12 October 1895 off Villierstown quay on the River Blackwater, near his residence at Dromana, having slipped while entering a boat.<br>
