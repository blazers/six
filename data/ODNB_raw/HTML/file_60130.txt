<span class="headword">Macpherson,  Lachlan</span> <span class="st"> [Lachlann Mac a' Phearsain; <em>called </em>Fear Shrath-Mhathaisidh]</span>  (<em>b. </em><em>c.</em>1723, <em>d.</em> in or before 1780), <span class="occ">Gaelic poet and musician</span>, was the only son of John Macpherson (<i>d</i>. 1784?), tacksman, and his wife, Jean, daughter of Lachlan Mackintosh of Macintosh. He was the tacksman of Strathmashie, which is located near the village of Laggan in Badenoch, Inverness-shire. He took the field with his father in the Jacobite rising of 1745 and accompanied the clan chief, Ewen Macpherson of Cluny, as far as Derby. He married Mary, daughter of Archibald Butter of Pitlochry, and they had two sons and two daughters.<br>
<br>Lachlan Macpherson's kinsman James Macpherson published <span class="italic">Fragments of Ancient Poetry Collected in the Highlands of Scotland</span> in June 1760. James then set off in the autumn of the same year on the journey through the highlands that led to the publication of <span class="italic">Fingal</span> (1761) and <span class="italic">Temora</span> (1763), purportedly based upon the work of Fingal's son Ossian. In 1805 a report was produced by a committee of the Highland Society of Scotland appointed to inquire into the nature and authenticity of James's poetry. The report includes a letter from Lachlan (appendix, pp. 8&#150;9) saying that he accompanied James during parts of his journey and assisted him in collecting most of the poetry from oral tradition and old manuscripts. Although he travelled with James only on the mainland, Lachlan's reputation as a Gaelic poet, together with his agreeable and polished manners, ensured that they were made welcome in the remoter parts of the highlands. He provided moral support and subsequently helped to prepare material for publication by deciphering ancient scripts, piecing fragments together, and transcribing them in roman characters.<br>
<br>Lachlan Macpherson's involvement with James Macpherson's later poems has been much discussed. Derick Thomson in his essay of 1998 refers to a letter dated 12 March 1799 from Andrew Gallie, minister in the parish of Laggan from 1758 to 1774, to Charles Macintosh, an Edinburgh solicitor. In this letter, printed in the committee's report  (pp. 30&#150;37), Gallie describes how he saw James and &#145;a friend who was at the time with Mr Macpherson and me&#146; working at translations of the retrieved poetry: &#145;With much labour I have recovered some scattered parts of the translation made at my fire-side, I should rather say of the original translated there, and I communicate to you a few stanzas, taken from the manuscript&#146;. There follow sixteen lines of Gaelic verse. Thomson comments that although these scan decently enough, they are not at all in the style of the ballads. He considers that they correspond closely to a passage in <span class="italic">Fingal</span> and have strong resemblances to a passage in the Gaelic version of the poem. The committee asked Gallie who James's friend was and printed his reply of 4 March 1801  (pp. 39&#150;43). Gallie said that the friend was &#145;alas! no more. His name was Lachlane Macpherson of Strathmashy. He died in the 1767.&#146; It has also been said that after Lachlan's death a paper was found in his handwriting containing a Gaelic version of a poem in the seventh book of <span class="italic">Temora</span>.<br>
<br>Macpherson did not regard himself as a poet by profession, but rather as a typical tacksman who wrote for his own amusement and that of his friends. He is said to have sat in the porch of his house entertaining everyone with his violin and witty rhymes in the manner of village bards. In later times, on clipping days, his quips and songs were recalled amid general merriment. Over a dozen of his songs survive, many having appeared in Gaelic and in translation in <span class="italic">The Poetry of Badenoch</span> by Thomas Sinton (1906). One praises the fellowship of whisky; another recounts how Lachlan and his retainers went to the great wood of Loch Laggan to fetch timber for a house. The raft that they built to float the cabers home glided off, carrying one of the men with it. Lachlan sings of the ensuing noise and merriment. The landlord of the stage-house at Dunkeld offended him in some way. Revenge is taken in song by sending an army of mice to ruin the landlord by eating him out of house and home. In &#145;The White Wedding&#146; he celebrates the marriage of an elderly couple at which all the guests were grey-haired. The old folk rejoice in a gently satirical epithalamium. Others songs are on the theme of hunting and satirize the jingling greed for riches. Perhaps the most serious song laments the death of his clan chieftain, Macpherson of Cluny.<br>
<br>Patrick Macgregor quotes a memorandum written by a Bishop Alexander Macdonell &#145;shortly before his death&#146;. The author of this memorandum was probably Alexander Macdonald (1755&#150;1837), a Gaelic scholar who was a priest in Perthshire and at a Gaelic chapel in Edinburgh. Macdonald says that all those best acquainted with both James and Lachlan believed that James was not as capable of doing justice to translation from the Gaelic as Lachlan, &#145;but that gentleman did not live to see the work finished or revised, which is supposed to be the cause of so many mistakes&#146;  (Macgregor, 39&#150;40). <span class="italic">Fingal</span> and <span class="italic">Temora</span> were published together by James in 1765 as <span class="italic">The Works of Ossian</span>. Andrew Gallie says that Lachlan Macpherson died in 1767, and John Mackenzie, in <span class="italic">Sar-obair nam bard Gaelach</span> (1841), that he died &#145;in the latter end of the 18th century&#146;  (pp. 260&#150;63). This is what may have led later writers to say that he lived into the last decade of the century. Derick Thomson in <span class="italic">Gaelic Poetry in the Eighteenth Century</span> (1993) and in <span class="italic">Companion to Gaelic Scotland</span> (1994) suggests a date of <i>c</i>.1795. However, letters from Macpherson's father and elder son, Alexander, from 1783 and 1780 respectively, which deal with family matters but make no mention of Lachlan, suggest that he had died some time before then  (Macpherson of Cluny MSS, NL Scot.).<br>
