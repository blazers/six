<span class="headword">Beale family</span>  (<em>per. </em><em>c.</em>1836&#150;1912), <span class="occ">lawyers, businessmen, and politicians</span>, were already a well-established merchant family in Birmingham by the late eighteenth century.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_49724"></a><span class="headword">William John Beale</span>  (1807&#150;1883)<span class="occ"></span>, the founder of Beale &amp; Co., solicitors, of Birmingham and London, was the younger son of William Beale (1770&#150;1843), a leading figure in Birmingham. William's eldest son, <a name="cosubject_58865"></a><span class="headword">Samuel Beale</span>  (1803&#150;1874)<span class="occ"></span>, had adopted a commercial career and was engaged in several successful ventures&#151;banking, railways, and ironworks. He was instrumental in founding the Birmingham and Midland Bank in 1836 (later the Midland Bank), of which he later became a director. He was also closely associated with the Midland Railway, being a director and chairman from 1844 to 1864. As well as taking an active role in the public life of Birmingham (he was mayor in 1841), he also sat as member of parliament for Derby (1857&#150;65), a town with strong links with the Midland Railway Company. He died on 11 September 1874.<br>
<br>William John Beale, choosing law as a profession, qualified as a solicitor in 1837, the same year in which he married Martha Phipson. He entered into partnership with Thomas Colmore, a relative of his father's third wife, Ann. The subsequent success of the firm illustrates the significance of family connections as a source of business and the contribution of prominent solicitors in public life.<br>
<br>In addition to managing the Colmore estates, Beale became legal adviser to the Midland Railway. From the mid-1840s this part of the firm became extensive and the large amount of parliamentary work associated with railway promotion led to the establishment of a separate London office. The success brought by railway work attracted large commercial and financial concerns as clients. Though a staunch Liberal and, like the rest of the family a prominent member of the Unitarian denomination, W. J. Beale did not take a large, visible role in local affairs. The exception to this was his philanthropic activities in connection with the general hospital and the organization of the triennial music festivals. He purchased a small estate at Dolgellau in north Wales, building a residence there in 1867: it was here that he died on 21 May 1883.<br>
<br>Three of William John's four sons entered the legal profession. The eldest, <a name="cosubject_49727"></a><span class="headword">Sir William Phipson Beale</span>, baronet  (1839&#150;1922)<span class="occ"></span>, born on 29 October 1839 in Birmingham, was called to the bar in 1869 after a scientific education and a brief spell at the Sheffield ironworks, of which Samuel Beale was a director. He married Mary, daughter of William Thompson, on 5 August 1869. William Phipson was elected member of parliament for South Ayrshire (1906&#150;18), having earlier bought an estate in the county. He was created a baronet in 1912, and died in Dorking on 13 April 1922.<br>
<br>The other two sons succeeded to their father's firm; one remained in Birmingham, while the other took over the running of the London office. <a name="cosubject_49726"></a><span class="headword">James Samuel Beale</span>  (1840&#150;1912)<span class="occ"></span>, born on 5 December 1840 in Birmingham, became head of the London office and was intimately involved in the affairs of the Midland Railway as its solicitor from 1867 until his retirement in 1905. His knowledge of railway law, and his skill in negotiations and the conduct of parliamentary procedure were widely recognized. This expertise was frequently called on by royal commissions, departmental committees, and the Railway Companies Association, of which he was solicitor for some time. In later years he was a director of the Midland Railway and president of the Law Society (1908) and built Standen in Sussex (acquired by the National Trust in 1972). He married Margaret, daughter of Algernon Sydney Field, another solicitor, on 19 April 1870. He died at Standen on 28 August 1912.<br>
<br>The professional career of the third son, <a name="cosubject_49723"></a><span class="headword">Charles Gabriel Beale</span>  (1843&#150;1912)<span class="occ"></span>, though based in Birmingham, had many similarities with that of his elder brother. Born on 10 May 1843 at Courtlands, Harborne Road, Birmingham, and educated at Trinity College, Cambridge, he became solicitor to the Birmingham and Midland Bank and a legal adviser to the Midland Railway. His attributes as a negotiator were also acknowledged and after retirement he was appointed a member of the royal commission on the working of the railway conciliation scheme in 1911. The business experience and legal expertise gained in professional life were also valued in Beale's later years when he became heavily involved in the conduct of municipal affairs in Birmingham in the post-Chamberlain period. He served on many of the corporation's important committees and was thrice mayor in consecutive years between 1897 and 1900. He was active in many areas of public life. On the founding of the University of Birmingham he became vice-chancellor, and, like his father, he was a principal organizer of the music festivals. Beale moved within the influential Unitarian circle and on 7 August 1868 married Alice, daughter of Timothy Kenrick, a local manufacturer, whose sisters married Joseph Chamberlain and Thomas Martineau. He died in Birmingham on 1 September 1912.<br>
<br>By the end of the nineteenth century the Beales were firmly placed in the professional middle class, having built a dynasty based on the practice of law. However, their professional activities demonstrate how the worlds of law and business could overlap.<br>
<br>The firm of Beale &amp; Co. was carried on by the two sons of Charles Gabriel: Hubert (1869&#150;1954) and Edmund (1872&#150;1952). The brothers also introduced their sons into the firm during the inter-war years. James's eldest son, John Beale (1874&#150;1935), though qualified as a solicitor, pursued a successful career in the iron and steel industry. The last member of the family connected with the firm was Charles Beale (1913&#150;1989) of Birmingham, a grandson of Charles Gabriel Beale. The London office remained, but with no family representative.<br>
