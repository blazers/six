<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Nelson, Sir  Amos</span>  (1860&#150;1947), <span class="occ">cotton manufacturer</span>, was born on 31 January 1860 at Winewall, near Colne, Lancashire, the eldest son of James Nelson (1831&#150;1912), an overlooker, and his wife, Mary Ann, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Hartley. Although he came from a hand-loom weaving family, James Nelson began work in a power-loom weaving factory in 1842 and by 1867 had risen from the position of weaver to overlooker to mill manager at the Cotton Tree mill of Critchley and Armstrong at Colne. It was in this mill that Amos was first employed at the age of eight as a half-timer; he had begun full-time work by the age of thirteen and was employed in a range of occupations before being apprenticed as an overlooker when he was sixteen. By the 1880s the family, six children in all, was an example of a highly successful Lancashire working-class family, but in 1881 the closure of the mill threatened its prosperity.<br>
<br>James Nelson invested his savings of &pound;1200, considerable for a working man, in buying 100 looms and renting room and power in nearby Nelson. He was joined in this venture by his son Amos, who, at the age of twenty-one, had already saved &pound;200. Nelson and Burnley were the centres of the &#145;room and power&#146; system in weaving, a system by which a successful working man could transform himself into an entrepreneur through renting both room and power in a weaving shed, thus needing to buy only the looms. The effect of the system was to reduce the start-up costs for new business, easing entry for those families who had been able to save a modest sum.<br>
<br>The firm, James Nelson &amp; Son, was a remarkable success story. By 1895 it had erected mills at Valley Road, Walverden, in Nelson, and was operating some 1200 looms. The firm continued to grow, and in 1912, on the death of James Nelson, owned some 3000 looms. Its success lay in seeking out specialist markets in which it could obtain a premium for its cloth. Having first concentrated on the market in China, the firm moved into the more prosperous home and European markets. It was also the first to introduce the sateen trade into Nelson. During the period of James Nelson's life there appears to have been a division of responsibility between the two men in the firm, the father managing production and the son responsible for finance and policy, including marketing.<br>
<br>In 1914, after his father's death, Amos Nelson set up a private limited company in which he chaired the board. The firm continued its pre-war success and by the end of the First World War had further expanded its capacity by buying spinning and doubling firms and creating an integrated enterprise. By 1922 Nelson controlled 3700 looms as well as more than 300,000 spindles and 60,000 doubling spindles.<br>
<br>Business success also brought with it considerable personal wealth. Nelson had married Mary Driver (1861&#150;1931) of Winewall, Colne, in 1879, and they had three sons and two daughters. They lived initially in Nelson before moving to the Manor House at Thornton in Craven, near Skipton, Yorkshire, and in 1919 Nelson acquired Gledstone Hall and estate, also near Skipton, with the intention of modernizing it. He invited Edward Lutyens, the distinguished architect, to draw up plans. Lutyens, who had a reputation for over-spending, produced plans that were too expensive, and Nelson, who had been knighted in 1922, instead asked him to build a new hall to a budget of &pound;40,000. The hall, which was built between 1923 and 1927, cost &pound;120,000, and although some of the estate's 6000 acres provided an income the cost, coinciding with a depression in the cotton industry, severely taxed Sir Amos's finances. The hall was one of Lutyens's finest buildings.<br>
<br>Gledstone Hall was not Nelson's only project at the end of the war. The firm built a sports and social club in Nelson as a memorial to those employees who had given their lives during the conflict. As the largest employer in the town, and with a record for paying the highest wages, Nelson's was regarded as a good place to work, and the new sports and social club further enhanced this reputation.<br>
<br>The inter-war crisis in the Lancashire cotton industry presented the firm and Sir Amos with their most formidable challenge. The initial post-war depression forced the company to suspend production for three months in 1921, and, while there was some recovery after an intensive marketing operation in the United States of America, the firm responded far more quickly than most of its rivals to the need to adapt. Nelson followed three strategies. The first was to diversify by moving into artificial silk (rayon). He set up two subsidiary companies, Lustrafil Ltd, which by 1924 was producing viscose yarn at Valley Mills, and Nelson Silk Ltd, at Lancaster, making acetate yarn from 1929.<br>
<br>The second aspect of Nelson's strategy was to move away from selling &#145;grey&#146; (unfinished) cloth through merchant distributors. Instead the company began to develop its own commercial outlets, giving direct access to buyers. Nelson acquired five subsidiary companies in Bradford and Manchester which specialized in selling the firm's branded products at home and abroad. Many contemporary manufacturers were critical of the merchant sector, but Sir Amos was one of the few to act positively by supplanting it.<br>
<br>The third strategy was to reduce costs in cotton weaving by a system of &#145;more loom&#146; weaving in the Valley Mills. This was a system by which weavers minded six or eight looms, rather than the traditional four, but were paid at new rates which enabled employers to cut overall costs. The more looms system was a common response by employers in cotton weaving in the 1930s and was the cause of major industrial unrest in Lancashire weaving between 1929 and 1932. Nelson's policy differed from that of most employers in that he introduced a more looms system on semi-automatic looms, rather than the traditional Lancashire looms, enabling him to pay higher wages than his competitors. His proposed more looms system attracted opposition not from the trade unions, but rather from his fellow employers, who felt his proposals undermined their own position. They therefore attempted to prevent him from implementing an agreement with the local trade union, the Nelson Weavers' Association. It was a measure of the growing desperation of the cotton industry that in 1931 Nelson chose to ignore the policy of the Cotton Spinners' and Manufacturers' Association and introduced a local agreement.<br>
<br>Sir Amos established a reputation as an industrial conciliator during the 1928 weavers' lock-out in Nelson. The dispute had been sparked by the fining of John Husband, vice-president of the Nelson Weavers' Association, and for seven weeks some 7000 weavers were locked out by their employers over a 1<i>s</i>. fine. Encouraged by the town's Labour mayor, Andrew Smith, to intervene, Sir Amos proposed to employ the Nelson Weavers' vice-president in his own mills, but he infuriated his fellow employers by suggesting an experimental scheme whereby there was no fining in the town. The county employers' organization, the Cotton Spinners' and Manufacturers' Association, threatened to take action against him if he did not withdraw, though when the dispute was finally settled John Husband was employed at Valley Mills.<br>
<br>The inter-war years also brought personal sadness for Nelson when his first wife died. In 1931 he married his second wife, Harriet, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Hargraves (1896&#150;1966), the daughter of his agent at Gledstone; they had one son.<br>
<br>Sir Amos was active in local politics, sitting as a Liberal on the Nelson town council between 1900 and 1910 and holding the office of mayor between 1903 and 1906. He left the council in 1910, when he broke with the Liberal Party over the issue of free trade, having become convinced that tariff reform was the solution to Britain's economic problems. It was this issue which persuaded him to stand as Conservative parliamentary candidate in 1923 for Nelson and Colne. Despite his local popularity, he was defeated by the Labour candidate, Arthur Greenwood.<br>
<br>The outbreak of war in 1939 changed the economic position of the cotton industry, but recovery did not come until after the war, when from 1945 to 1951 there was a sellers' market in cotton cloth. During this period Sir Amos chose to convert the firm from a private to a public company. Profits had risen substantially in the period 1936&#150;46, and the public company, employing 2600 workers, was capitalized at &pound;1.2 million. Nelson remained chairman of the new company but his tenure was short-lived, as he died on 13 August 1947 at Gledstone Hall. He was buried at St Peter's Church, Marton in Craven.<br>
