<span class="headword">Speke,  Hugh</span>  (1656&#150;<em>c.</em>1724), <span class="occ">whig agitator</span>, was the second son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26099/', "George Speke (1623&#150;1689)")</script>, a civil-war royalist turned whig MP, of White Lackington, near Ilminster, Somerset, and his wife, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/67750/', "Mary Speke")</script>, daughter of Sir Robert Pye. Speke matriculated at St John's College, Oxford, on 1 July 1672; he did not take a degree and in 1680 entered at Lincoln's Inn. During the era of the Exclusion Crisis (1679&#150;83) Speke, along with his father and brothers, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/67748/', "John Speke (1651/2&#150;1728)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26099/', "Speke, George")</script>] and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/67747/', "Charles Speke (d. 1685)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26099/', "Speke, George")</script>], who was later hanged for his part in the Monmouth rebellion, joined the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/92786', "Green Ribbon Club")</script>. He was active in London whig politics and associated with such men as William, Lord Russell, Sir Robert Atkyns, and John Trenchard, who later married Speke's sister, Philip. In 1679 Speke was warned by a friend that to go &#145;so open amongst them&#146; (meaning whigs) was dangerous  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, 21.281). But Speke was impervious to any advice and he led a colourful life in London, making himself not only obnoxious to the court for his outspoken whig politics, but also to his dissenting family in Somerset for his gaming, gambling, and passion for &#145;half-mad, extravagant, expensive, and drunken&#146; women. &#145;Keep out of debauched company&#146;, Speke's elder brother, John, warned him in 1682, &#145;though Whigs and great men&#146;  (ibid., 23.121&#150;2). In June 1683 an indictment was brought against Speke for proclaiming in the presence of others that Thomas Pilkington's remark of 1679&#151;that the duke of York had set fire to London in 1666 and wanted to cut protestant throats&#151;was true  (ibid., 24.338&#150;9). Speke was the author of <span class="italic">Enquiry into and Detection of the Barbarous Murder of the Late Earl of Essex</span> (1683), in which he hinted that Essex had been assassinated by partisans of the duke of York. Pilkington had been sued by James for his comments and was still languishing in prison.<br>
<br>In the summer of 1683 Speke was active in the defence of those accused of conspiring against the royal brothers in the so-called Rye House plot. In July he served as a go-between in the defence of William, Lord Russell, bringing Lady Russell the legal advice of Sir Robert Atkyns. On 18 August he also visited Francis Charlton at the Tower, offering &#145;the best advice and directions I can&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, 25.304). Two weeks later a warrant was issued for Speke's arrest. He had finally landed himself in real trouble by agreeing to assist Laurence Braddon in his quest to uncover the truth about the earl of Essex's death. Braddon, a whig lawyer, was interviewing witnesses and collecting evidence, aiming to prove that Essex had been murdered in the Tower. At the time of Braddon's arrest letters of introduction by Speke to persons of quality, including Atkyns, were discovered on him. Speke later claimed he was drinking at the time he wrote the letters and &#145;knew not well what I writ&#146;. But the letters were plainly incriminating, informing Atkyns that, &#145;we hope we can bring on the earl of Essex's murder on the stage, before they can any of those [Rye House plotters] in the Tower to a trial&#146;  (<span class="italic">State trials</span>, 9.1196, 1162). Speke was arrested in an action of <i>scandalum magnatum</i> at the suit of the duke of York. The charge was later changed to sedition and he was prosecuted along with Braddon before Judge Jeffreys in February 1684. Speke was fined &pound;1000. Unwilling, as he claimed, or simply unable to pay the fine, Speke spent the next four years in the king's bench prison at great expense. There he met the Revd Samuel Johnson, the late Lord Russell's chaplain, who was condemned for seditious libel in 1684 for his notorious attack on the duke of York, <span class="italic">Julian the Apostate</span>. Speke had various prison liberties, including access to a printing press which enabled Johnson to continue publishing anti-papist diatribes. In March 1686 Johnson and Speke decided to arouse the consciences of the protestant soldiers serving in James II's army who were encamped outside London on Hounslow Heath. Speke had Johnson's <span class="italic">A Humble and Hearty Address to All English Protestants in this Present Army</span> printed and, he later boasted, 20,000 copies were distributed among the soldiers in one night. The tract exhorted the men to abandon their Catholic officers and defend the protestant religion. Although 500 copies of the address were found in Speke's chambers, it was Johnson who paid dearly for their boldness. He was defrocked and whipped from Newgate to Tyburn. He refused to name Speke during his ordeal, and Speke was merely placed under stricter confinement.<br>
<br>In 1687, when James II began a new policy of courting dissenters, Speke achieved his liberty. He paid &pound;5000 to the exchequer as a pledge of his own and his family's good behaviour and, for a time, he retired to Exeter, where he became a member of the city council. In 1688, as rumours of the prince of Orange's intended invasion began to circulate, Speke headed for London where he appeared daily at &#145;Whitehall to show myself zealous in James II's cause&#146;  (Speke, <span class="italic">Memoirs</span>, 40). As someone with connections to both the disaffected gentlemen in western England and those gathered about the prince of Orange, Speke was seen as particularly useful to James's court at that critical moment. Soon after Prince William had landed at Torbay, the king himself met with Speke at Chiffinch's lodgings, requesting him to spy on the prince's camp and report back its strength. Speke was given several blank passes, so that he might travel freely, and offered &pound;10,000, which he declined, having no intention of serving the king's interest. He set out on 8 November and proceeded to Exeter, where he came upon an advance guard of the prince of Orange's army. Speke was soon able to arrange a meeting with William and convince him of his loyalty. He gave the prince an account of the king's strength and designs and wrote letters to James, perused by William, magnifying the strength of the prince's army and warning the king that many of his own officers would eventually desert him. The subsequent desertions of the prince of Denmark and the duke of Ormond served to assure James of the reliability of Speke's intelligence.<br>
<br>Speke may have also had a hand in instigating the anti-papist hysteria that gripped London in early December. Fearing an invasion of French and Irish troops bent on massacring protestants, Londoners set about arming themselves, disarming Catholics, and, in the process, looting some Catholic homes and chapels. Their panic had been fed by rumours and letters sent throughout England warning protestants of their impending demise at the hands of roving papist soldiers. Speke later claimed that he had not only sent those letters on his way to Exeter but that he was also the true author of the spurious <span class="italic">Third Declaration of the Prince of Orange</span> (dated &#145;Sherburn Castle, 28 Nov. 1688&#146;). The <span class="italic">Third Declaration</span> fuelled hysteria by stating that armed papists in and around London were going to &#145;make some desperate attempt&#146; upon the inhabitants &#145;by fire or sudden massacre&#146;  (<span class="italic">Third Declaration</span>, Cobbett, <span class="italic">Parl. Hist.</span>, 4, 1809, 14). Speke also asserted later that it was he who advised James, with Prince William's consent, to retire to France. How much of Speke's memoirs of the revolution of 1688 (first published in 1707 as <span class="italic">Some Memoirs of the most Remarkable Passages and Transactions on the Late Happy Revolution</span>, and again in 1715 with some modifications as <span class="italic">The Secret History of the Happy Revolution in 1688</span>) can be trusted is unclear. It seems likely that he was the author of the <span class="italic">Third Declaration</span>. None of the other possible candidates for the job, including Samuel Johnson, who also liked to exaggerate his influence on the revolution, and Robert Ferguson, the notorious plotter and pamphleteer who was certainly capable of the task, ever claimed it.<br>
<br>Speke's relationship with William and Mary's government is not entirely clear. Unlike so many whigs active on the part of the prince, Speke was not given a public office as a reward for his services. Speke himself claimed that this was because he kept a correspondence with James, with William's knowledge, and wanted to keep up the fa&ccedil;ade of his loyalty to the exiled monarch. But he was also in dire straits financially and received very little support from the new administration. From 1692 to 1694, during his brother-in-law John Trenchard's term as secretary of state, Speke occupied himself with zealously chasing down suspected Jacobites. But by 1698 he was begging for money, and in 1703 he petitioned parliament for some monetary compensation, considering all that he and his family had suffered and paid in fines before the revolution. He was rewarded with &pound;100. He later solicited George I for &pound;500, but it is unclear if he had any success. In his later years Speke was living at High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire. He died about 1724.<br>
