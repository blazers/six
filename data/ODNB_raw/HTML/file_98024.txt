<span class="headword">Tripp, Sir  (Herbert) Alker</span>  (1883&#150;1954), <span class="occ">police officer and town planner</span>, was born at 38 Ashley Road, Islington, London, on 23 August 1883, the son of George Henry Tripp (1860&#150;1922), a civil servant in the Home Office who became receiver for the Metropolitan Police district, and his wife, Sophia Caroline, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Freeman (1855/6&#150;1932). From childhood to late teens Tripp was determined to become an artist, and was a student at the Slade School of Fine Art, but his parents insisted that art would be an unwise and insecure career choice. In 1902, bowing to parental persuasion, he followed his father and was nominated by the home secretary to a civil service clerkship in the office of the commandant of the Metropolitan Police, at New Scotland Yard. On 6 June 1910 he married Abigail (1880/81&#150;1951), daughter of John Clarke Powell of the Bank of Ireland. They had one son and one daughter.<br>
<br>In 1920 Tripp became chairman of the police recruiting board. This was a &#145;suited&#146; position: even following promotion to assistant commissioner of the Metropolitan Police in 1932 he only wore uniform on official occasions. His main achievement at the recruiting board was to make the case for an enhanced supply of officer material, something long denied by Peelite tradition. In 1934 Lord Trenchard agreed to the establishment of the Metropolitan Police Staff College at Hendon. Between the mid-1920s and early 1930s Tripp served as a prominent member of the standing committee on aliens and nationality and the advisory committee on the homeless poor of London. Only in 1932, however, following promotion to assistant commissioner with responsibility for traffic, a post he held until his retirement, did he reveal the full range and depth of his talents.<br>
<br>A passionate motorist and cyclist, Tripp had long pondered methods of reducing the death toll on Britain's roads. Since the end of the First World War the traffic problem had become critical. Motor cars had appeared on the roads in ever larger numbers, a development stridently resisted by those who promoted the interests of pedestrians. A convinced citizen of the new automotive world, Tripp travelled widely in search of viable control systems. By the mid-1930s he had decided that, although the great majority of British drivers could be trusted to respond to what was then a remarkably undemanding body of traffic law, pedestrians and cyclists were intrinsically incapable of adjusting to radically changed conditions. He dabbled with plans for the legal regulation of non-drivers but, meeting tough opposition, switched to environmental and planning-based solutions.<br>
<br>Throughout the 1930s Tripp invariably supported conservative Home Office and senior constabulary policies. A clear majority of chief constables were convinced that in the near future motor vehicles would present an insoluble problem. Tripp agreed and also seconded the view that &#145;over-regulation&#146; of motorists might harm relationships between drivers and the police, thereby reducing rather than increasing prosecutions of the very small number of road-hogs conventionally believed to pose a threat to other road-users. Tripp opposed scientifically based innovation, including the introduction of radical &#145;Scandinavian&#146; measures to reduce the incidence of drink driving. Giving evidence in 1938 to the House of Lords select committee on the prevention of road accidents, chaired by Lord Alness, he argued that blood tests would be alien to &#145;British conditions&#146; and insisted that no more than approximately ninety private car owners whose driving was impaired by alcohol could be shown to be causally responsible for fatal accidents in any calendar year.<br>
<br>By the late 1930s Tripp had decided that the road traffic crisis would never be solved by safety education and caution on the part of the overwhelming majority of private motorists, who were assumed to behave in a responsible manner. American solutions might be needed. These included &#145;separation&#146;, although Tripp preferred the term &#145;segregation&#146;. He wrote two seminal studies, one the product of monitoring traffic problems, particularly in London, over the preceding twenty years: the other, an analysis of road conditions in what he correctly predicted would be a massively more heavily motorized post-war environment.<br>
<br>In <span class="italic">Road Traffic and its Control</span> (1938) Tripp proposed the construction of a central network of what would later be called inter-city arterial routes. Each would be &#145;supplied&#146; with traffic from feeder roads, but have only minimal contact with small towns and villages. To save lives, he argued, pedestrians must be prevented from encountering dangerous streams of fast-moving vehicles. As far as possible long-distance drivers would be confined to the central arterial spine. Over the next decade Tripp strongly advocated the adoption of these ideas as a member from 1944 of the committee on road safety and from 1946 of the Ministry of Transport Road Research Board.<br>
<br>In his second study, <span class="italic">Town Planning and Road Traffic</span> (1942), Tripp refined the idea of segregation, championed the introduction of urban precincts, and proposed a scheme based on restricted movement of pedestrians&#151;via bridges and underpasses&#151;in town centres. Both books proved influential in the USA, Europe, and Scandinavia. In time each fed into Colin Buchanan's internationally influential post-war analysis, <span class="italic">Towns and Cars</span> (1963). They also infuriated the rump of the pro-pedestrian movement: anti-motoring activists accused him of forcing non-drivers underground or dangerously up into the heavens. Tripp refused to compromise, insisting that the era of mixed traffic had passed. Segregation must be preferable to spiralling slaughter.<br>
<br>Tripp retired in 1947. Throughout his civil service career he continued to paint and established a reputation as an artist. He painted watercolour portrayals of gently domesticated inter-war seascapes and landscapes, and exhibited regularly at the Royal Academy. Many of his paintings were reproduced as posters for railway companies. From 1942 to 1949 he served on the Royal Academy's planning committee, which concerned itself with the architectural reconstruction of post-war London.<br>
<br>Tripp was also a prolific author on sailing, the other guiding passion of his life, illustrating his books in pen and ink. <span class="italic">Shoalwater and Fairway</span> (1924), <span class="italic">Suffolk Sea Borders</span> (1926), <span class="italic">Solent and Southern Waters</span> (1928), and <span class="italic">Under the Cabin Lamp</span> (1950) are studded with credible dialogue and reveal a microscopically detailed knowledge of the eastern and southern seaways. That he was able to lead what amounted to a triple life&#151;dominated, inevitably, by his lifelong engagement with metropolitan and national traffic problems&#151;says much about early twentieth-century workloads in the Metropolitan Police and at the Home Office.<br>
<br>Tripp was made a CBE in 1935 and knighted in 1945. He died at St Andrews Hospital, Northampton, on 12 December 1954. His home had been at Lee Cottage, Weston Green, Thames Ditton, Surrey, and his funeral was held at All Saints', Weston Green. An unassuming, persuasive, conservative but nevertheless creative man, Tripp made a major though controversial contribution to the consolidation of mass motoring in twentieth-century Britain.<br>
