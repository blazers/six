<span class="headword">Chisholm,  Erik William</span>  (1904&#150;1965), <span class="occ">composer and conductor</span>, was born on 4 January 1904 at 2 Balmoral Villas, Cathcart, Glasgow, son of John Chisholm, master house painter, and his wife, Elizabeth McGeachy Macleod. His formal schooling was short: at the age of thirteen he was removed from Queen's Park School because of poor health. But he displayed a precocious talent for composition, and some of his early songs and keyboard pieces were published during his childhood. He also made an early impression as an instrumentalist, and after piano lessons with Philip Halstead he studied the organ with Herbert Walton. He progressed quickly, and at the age of twelve gave organ recitals at Glasgow Cathedral and in Hull. Keen to develop Chisholm's talent, his father approached the composer John Ireland in London. He hoped that Ireland would teach Erik composition by correspondence, but the composer rejected the idea and the pianist Leff Pouishnoff became his principal teacher and mentor.<br>
<br>In 1927 Chisholm travelled to Nova Scotia, Canada, and was appointed organist and choirmaster at the Westminster Presbyterian Church, New Glasgow, and director of music at Pictou Academy. But his stay was short and he returned to Glasgow two years later. There he accepted the post of organist at Barony Church and taught privately. Concerned that he had no formal qualifications, he decided to apply for a place at the University of Edinburgh. Supported by recommendations from Edward Dent and Donald Tovey, his application was successful, and he gained a BMus in 1931 and a DMus in 1934. During his student years he remained active professionally, and the tasks that he undertook reflected his diverse talents: in 1928 he formed the Scottish Ballet Society; in 1929 he founded the Active Society for the Propagation of Contemporary Music; between 1930 and 1934 he was a music critic with the <span class="italic">Glasgow Weekly Herald</span> and the <span class="italic">Scottish Daily Express</span>; and in 1933 he was the soloist at the premi&egrave;re of his piano concerto no. 1 in Amsterdam.<br>
<br>During the 1930s Chisholm became increasingly interested in conducting. He had a flair for theatre music, and his reputation as a conductor of opera and ballet soon flourished. His performances with the Glasgow Grand Opera Society between 1930 and 1939 were of particular importance, and by leading the British premi&egrave;res of Mozart's <span class="italic">Idomeneo</span> in 1934 and Berlioz's <span class="italic">Les Troyens</span> and <span class="italic">B&eacute;atrice et B&eacute;n&eacute;dict</span> in 1935 and 1936 respectively he attracted national attention. But Chisholm did not restrict his conducting activities to one society, and, with an immense capacity for work, he pursued his career with missionary zeal: he was the founder conductor of both the Barony Opera Society and the Scottish Ballet Society; he established the Professional Organists' Association; and in 1938 he was appointed music director of the Celtic Ballet, for which he composed four works. At the outbreak of hostilities in 1939 Chisholm was declared unfit for military service. Determined to help the war effort where possible, he conducted performances with the Carl Rosa Opera in 1940, and later joined the Entertainments National Service Association. For the latter he toured Italy with the Anglo-Polish Ballet in 1943 and served as musical director to the south-east Asia command between 1943 and 1945. In this capacity, he formed a multi-racial orchestra in India and founded the Singapore Symphony Orchestra.<br>
<br>In 1946 Chisholm was appointed professor of music at the University of Cape Town and director of the South African College of Music. But he was unhappy with existing arrangements and was quick to make changes: he appointed new staff, extended the number of courses, and introduced new degrees and diplomas. As an artist of wide experience, he was aware that South Africa could not provide the opportunities for young musicians that he had enjoyed in Britain. Determined to improve the situation where possible, he founded the South African National Music Press to help young African composers in 1948, established the university opera company in 1951, and started the university opera school in 1954. The opera company soon became a vehicle for innovation, and Chisholm used it to champion the cause of aspiring composers and to perform some of his more recent compositions. He conducted the group in the premi&egrave;re in 1954 of his <span class="italic">Dark Sonnet</span>, later performed successfully in New York; the first performance of his opera <span class="italic">The Pardoner's Tale</span>; and also the premi&egrave;re of John Joubert's <span class="italic">Silas Marner</span> in 1961. Though based in South Africa, he was keen to maintain an international profile, and in 1956 he travelled to the United Kingdom with the company. As part of that tour he led the first staged performance in Britain of Bart&oacute;k's <span class="italic">Bluebeard's Castle</span>, a work with which he had a special affinity. Two years later he conducted the Moscow State Orchestra in his piano concerto no. 2 (&#145;On Hindustani themes&#146;) in Russia.<br>
<br>Throughout his career Chisholm composed at great speed, completing over 100 works, many of which remain unpublished. Because Scottish composers are few and the quality of his music is often good, his apologists have argued that his works should be heard more regularly. But his music can be harsh and his uncompromising approach is often unattractive to audiences. Even so, some of his works have been revived, and recordings of his piano and vocal music have been made. He had a lifelong interest in Scottish music and published a collection of Celtic folk-songs in 1964. He was also interested in Czech music, and completed his book <span class="italic">The Operas of Leo&#353; Jan&aacute;&#269;ek</span> shortly before his death. His services to Czech music were recognized formally in 1956, when he was awarded the Dvo&#345;&aacute;k medal. Erik Chisholm died of a heart attack at Cape Town, South Africa, on 8 June 1965.<br>
