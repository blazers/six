He was born at Fort George, Inverness-shire, on 26 August 1800. He was educated at Harrow School (1814&#150;17), and at Edinburgh University, though he did not graduate. He became an advocate in 1822, practising at the Scottish bar until his father's death (14 April 1838). He was a member of the Speculative Society, and at its meetings read two essays, &#145;Origin and progress of criminal jurisprudence&#146; and &#145;History of painting&#146;. He was an active promoter of almost every scheme of improvement throughout Scotland. Ayrshire, in which his seat was situated, was especially indebted to his aid in its agricultural, charitable, and religious institutions. He initiated the Ayrshire Educational Association, and at his own expense built schools and churches. He was returned to the general assembly of the Church of Scotland as a lay representative for Ayr. He did much to extend the church's usefulness and efficiency, and his advice influenced its legislative body. A decided conservative in his political principles, in both church and state, Fergusson disliked the strife of political life, and was tolerant in his sentiments. Though repeatedly urged by his friends he refused to seek election for his native county. He continued a zealous protectionist. A colonial proprietor, he condemned Peel's free trade legislation as injurious to the colonies. On 1 June 1829 he married Helen (<i>d</i>. 26 June 1869), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/3125/', "David Boyle, Lord Shewalton (1772&#150;1853)")</script>, lord justice-general of Scotland, and they had eight children. In 1837 he succeeded to the estates of his grandfather, Lord Hailes, in East Lothian and Midlothian, and in 1838 to those of his father in Ayrshire, on which he resided. In 1838, on inheriting the Newhailes estate from his aunt Christian Dalrymple, he assumed the name Dalrymple-Fergusson. He died at Inveresk, Midlothian, on 18 March 1849. His Ayrshire tenants erected a monument to him. Fergusson's estate of Hailes in East Lothian and Midlothian descended to his second son, Charles, who assumed the name of Dalrymple, as representing his great-grandfather, Lord Hailes, but the baronetcy of Hailes was extinct; in 1887 he was created baronet, of Newhailes. In the title and estates of Fergusson of Kilkerran, Fergusson was succeeded by his eldest son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/33112/', "Sir James Fergusson (1832&#150;1907)")</script>, politician and colonial governor.<br>
