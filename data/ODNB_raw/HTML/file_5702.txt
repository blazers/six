<span class="headword">Close, Sir  Barry</span>, baronet  (1756&#150;1813), <span class="occ">army officer in the East India Company and political officer in India</span>, was born on 3 December 1756 at Elm Park, co. Armagh, the third son in the family of four sons and five daughters of Maxwell Close (<i>d</i>. 1793) and his wife and cousin, Mary, daughter of Captain Robert Maxwell of Fellows Hall, co. Armagh. The protestant ascendancy family had come to Ireland from Yorkshire under Charles I. After early education in Ireland he was entered as a cadet in the Madras army in 1771 at the age of fifteen, and was commissioned an ensign in the Madras native infantry on 3 September 1773. He was appointed adjutant of the newly formed 20th battalion in 1777, which joined the British garrison of Tellicherry on the Malabar coast, to be attacked and besieged by the forces of Mysore under Haidar Ali in 1780. Close's personal courage and talent for leadership were revealed in this action, and his treatment of the sepoys' followers and families ensured that his battalion remained steady when adjacent battalions mutinied after promises over leave and allowances were broken. The 1780 mutiny and subsequent inquiry prepared him for later experiences in an army whose loyalty was notoriously volatile. He acquired a reputation as an excellent linguist, invariably conducting his business with the sepoys in their own language.<br>
<br>In 1781 Close was appointed aide-de-camp to Major-General James Stuart, the commander-in-chief of the Madras army, and saw that officer summarily dismissed by the governor, Lord Macartney, for refusing to accept orders concerning the deployment of troops of the king's army against the French. Close was in attendance on the one-legged general throughout the drama of his arrest and forcible embarkation for England on 17 September 1783. His diplomatic handling of these highly contentious events enhanced his reputation among the British community in Madras. Gazetted a captain on 18 December 1783, he was selected to conduct boundary negotiations with the representatives of the new ruler of Mysore, Tipu Sultan. His career as a staff officer continued as deputy adjutant-general of the Madras army under Lord Cornwallis during the Third Anglo-Mysore War (1790&#150;92), against Tipu Sultan. On his return to Madras he was appointed adjutant-general and gazetted a lieutenant-colonel on 29 November 1797.<br>
<br>Barry Close was an active member of the European community in Madras, gaining the respect of his fellows for speaking out against inflated food prices, bad roads, and general street lawlessness. He was instrumental in the formation of a permanent police committee on 29 December 1797, and in the establishment of the Madras military fund for the relief of widows and children.<br>
<br>Lord Wellesley's policy of aggressive expansion once more brought the Madras army, in combination with elements from Bombay and the nizam of Hyderabad, to the gates of Seringapatam in May 1799. Close, as adjutant-general, played the leading role in the planning and conduct of the successful assault in which Tipu Sultan died and the substantial kingdom was brought under British control. He was appointed to the commission which supervised the partition of Mysore, and drafted the subsidiary treaty which defined the terms under which the ancient Hindu dynasty of Mysore rulers would be restored to the throne from captivity. The governor-general, Wellesley, described Close as<blockquote>by far the ablest man in the army of Madras, and few more able officers exist in the world. He was the life and soul of the campaign. In addition, he is the ablest scholar in Persian, and in several of the native dialects. He is a man of extraordinary general knowledge and talents. His integrity is irreproachable; and he is a very amiable and pleasant man, with a rather warm temper. (Ingram, 170)</blockquote>Close was appointed the first resident at the Mysore court, with the task of supervising the young raja and settling the new state. But, before this could be achieved, he was dispatched to negotiate the annexation of all the territories in the Carnatic ruled by the nawab of Arcot, who was accused of having secretly plotted with Tipu against the British. During the negotiations (15 July 1801), the nawab died, and Close's mission was extended to settle the disputed succession. His mission successfully completed, in the same year he was appointed resident at the court of the peshwa at Poona in anticipation of further British expansion under Wellesley. He was responsible for concluding the treaty of Bassein with the peshwa on 31 December 1802 which permitted British intervention on the latter's behalf to coerce the princes of the Maratha confederacy. Subsequently, the initial subordination of the confederacy was completed by Arthur Wellesley's victory over Daulat Rao Sindhia at the battle of Assaye in 1803.<br>
<br>Close was promoted colonel of the 20th Madras native infantry on 27 August 1805, and, while nominally still resident at Poona, held a roving commission to maintain the uncertain peace among dissident elements within the Maratha states by negotiation and swift military action. But perhaps his most significant contribution to the East India Company's affairs was to intervene in the mutiny of British officers which paralysed the Madras army for eight months in 1809. In July that year his personal exhortation to the officers not to defy the Madras authorities, and, in their own language, to the sepoys not to follow their dissenting officers, caused the disaffected Hyderabad regiments to give up their protest and eventually led to the collapse of the mutiny throughout south India.<br>
<br>Close returned to Britain on leave in 1810 after almost forty continuous years of service in India. He was immediately promoted major-general (25 July 1810) and, through the influence of the earl of Buckinghamshire (then president of the Board of Control), was created a baronet by the prince regent on 12 December 1812. He died, unmarried, in London on 12 April 1813, and was buried on 23 April with full company honours in Marylebone church, Middlesex. His baronetcy became extinct.<br>
<br>Barry Close gained neither the fame nor the fortune which came to later soldier administrators in India, such as Sir John Malcolm and Sir Thomas Munro, who profited from the consequences of the Wellesley period of intervention and expansion. Rather, he was representative of those men who enabled the East India Company to transform itself from an armed merchant to the agent of empire. It was a substantial change, which relied upon the uncertain talents of an expatriate community where the necessary skills were not imbued by formal training, but were found to a lesser or greater extent in the character and personal abilities of those on the spot who had sufficient ambition to respond to the demands of the moment.<br>
