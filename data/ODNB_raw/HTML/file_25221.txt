<span class="headword">Sharp,  Thomas</span>  (1770&#150;1841), <span class="occ">antiquary</span>, only son of Thomas Sharp of Coventry, hatter, was born on 7 November 1770, in a house in Smithford Street, Coventry, which bore the effigy of &#145;Peeping Tom&#146;. He was educated at the free grammar school in Coventry and on his father's death, in 1784, he joined the family business. He married, in 1804, Charlotte Turland of Barnwell, Cambridgeshire; they had nine children, of whom seven survived him.<br>
<br>From youth Sharp devoted himself to the study of local antiquities and the Coventry city muniments. About 1798 Sharp, with two friends, George Howlette and George Nickson, commissioned views of all the buildings of interest in the county, to be engraved and inserted in their copies of William Dugdale's <span class="italic">Warwickshire</span>. In 1820 Sharp procured rubbings of all the brasses in the county for insertion in the same work. In 1804 he retired from the retail trade to become a wholesaler, and devoted his additional leisure to antiquarian research, producing many pamphlets and articles, and in 1824 a <span class="italic">Guide to Coventry</span>. His chief work, <span class="italic">A dissertation on the pageants, or dramatic mysteries, anciently performed at Coventry by the trading companies of that city</span>, was published at Coventry in a small edition in 1825. It was praised by Sir Walter Scott for its &#145;carefulness and extent of research&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters</span>, 9.444). It remains indispensable, especially because of the loss by enemy action in 1940 of the guild records which Sharp&#151;here anticipating the course of later research&#151;had used to provide the plays with a context. He was in error in believing <span class="italic">Ludus Coventriae</span> to be a genuine Coventry play; it is now regarded by scholars as an &#145;N-Town play&#146;. Sharp proposed to publish an edition of 125 copies of the Coventry <span class="roman">Corpus Christi plays</span>, but failed to secure sufficient signatures. (The compilation was published by the Shakespeare Society in 1841.)<br>
<br>In 1834 Sharp relinquished his declining business altogether and moved to Leamington, where he continued his frequent communication with fellow antiquaries such as Sir Francis Palgrave, Dawson Turner, Francis Douce, William Salt, and John Britton. In 1831 he acted as executor of William Hamper, whose friend and correspondent he had been. Always active in promoting municipal welfare, in 1837 Sharp took a principal part in founding the Coventry and Warwick Hospital. He died on 12 August 1841 at Leamington and was interred at St Michael's burial-ground, Coventry.<br>
<br>At the time of his death Sharp was engaged on a history of Coventry, which appeared posthumously and incomplete as <span class="italic">A Concise History of Coventry</span>. His <span class="italic">Illustrative Papers on the History and Antiquities of the City of Coventry</span> was published in 1871, with a memoir by William George Fretton.<br>
<br>Apart from his topographical collections relating to Warwickshire (the majority of which, like the extra-illustrated Dugdale, were purchased in 1834 by William Staunton of Longbridge House, near Warwick), Sharp was an assiduous collector of coins, and he was an authority on provincial coins and tokens. In 1834 he published a detailed catalogue of the Chetwynd collection at Grendon Hall. One of Sharp's own coins, a gold half-florin of Edward III, of which only two specimens were known, is now in the British Museum. Part of Sharp's library was sold in London by Sotheby and Wilkinson on 23 July 1858. The bulk of his collections of Warwickshire manuscripts was destroyed in a fire at the Birmingham Free Reference Library in 1879, but an annotated copy of his <span class="italic">Dissertation on the Dramatic Mysteries</span> and a volume of his Coventry tracts, also annotated, survive in the British Library  (Add. MSS 43645 and 44932).<br>
