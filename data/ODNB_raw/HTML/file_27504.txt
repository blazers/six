<span class="headword">Thom <span class="st"> [Tom]</span>,  John Nichols</span> <span class="st"> [<em>alias </em>Sir William Courtenay]</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1799, <em>d.</em> 1838), <span class="occ">impostor and lunatic</span>, was baptized on 10 November 1799 at St Columb Major, Cornwall, the only son (he had one sister) of William Thom (or Tom), a small farmer and innkeeper, and his wife, Charity, whose maiden name was Bray. Charity Thom showed symptoms of insanity by 1816 and later died in the county lunatic asylum. Thom was educated at Bellevue House Academy, Penryn, and at a school in Launceston, run by Richard Cope, the local Congregational minister, on narrow religious lines, which left a lasting impression on his mind. He was clerk to a solicitor at St Columb (1817&#150;20) and, after a few months as an innkeeper at Wadebridge, he became clerk to Lubbocks, wine merchants, in Truro. He married in February 1821 Catherine Fisher (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1775), daughter of William Fulpitt of Truro, a comfortably off fisherman turned market gardener, and, using his wife's money, took over Lubbocks on the retirement of the partners. Thom appeared a friendly, diligent tradesman, better educated than most. Almost 6 feet tall, swarthy, and well built, he was a fine cricketer, reputedly one of the best wrestlers in Cornwall, and well known locally for his feats of strength.<br>
<br>Although Thom said little about his religious and political beliefs, in 1821 he secretly joined the Spencean Society, which advocated the nationalization of land. On 19 June 1828 Thom's business premises in Truro burned down, and although they were insured and rebuilt he showed signs of incipient insanity and was under treatment for much of 1829&#150;31. In May 1832 he vanished when on a visit to Liverpool to sell a cargo of malt; he reappeared in September at Canterbury, where he falsely claimed he had been travelling in the Near East. He had probably been living in London, masquerading as Squire Thompson and taking an interest in the cause of distressed Jews. He had grown his hair and beard extravagantly long and, calling himself Count Moses Rothschild, he lodged at The Rose inn. Here he showed a talent for duplicitous self-advertisement, financing the largess he distributed to the credulous mob by loans on which he promised repayment with interest.<br>
<br>Styling himself a knight of Malta, Thom assumed the name of Sir William Courtenay and claimed the earldom of Devon; the real earl lived in France and surprisingly never confronted Thom's imposture. He also claimed the Kentish estates of Sir Edward Hales, sixth baronet, who had died without issue in 1829, and bought some of his clothes from his valet. At the general election of December 1832, standing for Canterbury as an independent, Thom capitalized on the enthusiasm for reform and, promising to abolish tithes, taxes on shopkeepers, primogeniture, placemen, and corporate bodies, he polled a respectable 375 votes (the winner polled 834). However, a few days later he secured only four votes in the county election for East Kent. He then published <span class="italic">The Lion</span>, a weekly broadsheet (March&#150;May 1833), which amid much scurrilous nonsense acutely attributed the cause of the prevailing popular unrest to heavy taxation and exorbitant rents. Unfortunately, Thom was indicted for perjury in his defence of some smugglers at Rochester, and at Maidstone assizes (25 July 1833) he was sentenced to three months' imprisonment and seven years' transportation. After his wife arrived from Cornwall to relate his previous insanity, he was placed in the county lunatic asylum at Barming Heath, where for four years he was a model patient. His father, backed by Thom's former employer (now MP for Truro), petitioned the home secretary, Lord John Russell, for his release, which was granted on 3 October 1837.<br>
<br>Persisting in his claim to be the rightful earl of Devon, Thom refused to return to Cornwall with his family, and for three months lodged near Canterbury with George Francis, a blinkered snob deluded by Thom's aristocratic pretensions and impressed with his biblical exegesis. Thom aimed to whip up the rural working classes against the unfair distribution of wealth, low wages, lack of employment, and the harsh operation of the poor law. Closely resembling the traditional likeness of Christ, and mouthing messianic and apocalyptic prophecies, he gathered about forty followers, armed them with cudgels, and, mounted, with pistols, on a white horse, with a flag bearing a lion as emblem, he led them about the countryside. A warrant charged him with enticing away the labourers of a local farmer, and on 31 May 1838 Thom shot Nicholas Mears, one of the constable's party serving the warrant, cruelly mangling the dying man with his sword. When two companies of the 45th regiment marched from Canterbury that afternoon to arrest him, Thom retired to Bossenden Wood, threatening his followers with death if they fled. In a fight only lasting a few minutes, Thom, having shot one of the officers, Lieutenant Bennett, was himself killed, along with eight of his followers; three more died of their wounds a few days later. Of those captured, three were subsequently sentenced to transportation and six to a year's hard labour. Thom was buried on 5 June in Hernhill churchyard, where no mark or memorial was allowed over his grave.<br>
<br>Thom's paranoia, with its delusions of grandeur and sartorial extravagance, was accompanied by considerable clarity of thought and a commanding presence, all of which gulled his illiterate and ignorant followers (and indeed some of the Canterbury well-to-do). In the aftermath of the final incident in Thom's life, the government of Lord Melbourne came under fire for releasing him from his asylum, and the established church was attacked for its lack of influence locally.<br>
