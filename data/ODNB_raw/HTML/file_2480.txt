<span class="headword">Bisset,  James</span>  (1795&#150;1872), <span class="occ">scholar</span>, was the son of George Bisset and his wife, Mary Adamson. He was born on 20 April 1795 in the parish of Udny in Aberdeenshire, where his father was parish schoolmaster and headmaster of a private academy and boarding-school. James was the second son of a large family; one brother, Thomas, became vicar of Pontefract (1865&#150;78), another, Charles, was incumbent of Upholland in Wigan (1844&#150;81), and a third attained the rank of colonel in the East India Company's service. Bisset was well trained by his father, and then proceeded to Marischal College, Aberdeen.<br>
<br>At the early age of seventeen, as a result of the death of his father, Bisset was obliged to assume all the responsibilities of schoolteaching, and of educating his younger brothers and sisters. Like his father he developed remarkable teaching ability, and his private school became celebrated. Many of the local gentry were educated by him, and several of his pupils became men of mark, among them Sir James Outram and J. C. Robertson, the ecclesiastical historian. He was aided by very able assistants; Dr James Melvin, afterwards rector of Aberdeen grammar school, and Dr Adam Thom, sometime recorder of the Hudson's Bay Company, were both members of his staff. He qualified himself for the ministry of the Church of Scotland, studying divinity at the universities of Aberdeen and Edinburgh. In 1826 he became minister of the small parish of Bourtie, Aberdeenshire. The duties of his limited parochial charge left him leisure to continue his philological studies, for he was known as an elegant Latinist. His repute as a scholar was not, however, sustained by any publication of permanent value. In 1850 the degree of DD was conferred upon him by the University of Aberdeen.<br>
<br>Bisset was twice married: first, in 1829, to Mary Bannerman (<i>d</i>. 1836), eldest daughter of the Revd Robert Lessel of Inverurie; and second, in 1840, to Elizabeth Sinclair, daughter of the Revd William Smith of Bowes. Bisset had four daughters and one son from his first marriage, and one daughter and two sons from his second.<br>
<br>Bisset became an ardent politician on what was called the &#145;constitutional side&#146;, and ecclesiastically was a prominent figure in the prolonged conflict within and without the church courts which terminated in the founding of the Free Church of Scotland. Bisset did not support the secession headed by Thomas Chalmers, Robert Candlish, and Thomas Guthrie. In 1862 he was chosen moderator of the general assembly of the Church of Scotland. He died at Bourtie on 8 September 1872.<br>
