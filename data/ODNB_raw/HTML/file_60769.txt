<span class="headword">McFadzean,  William Hunter</span>, Baron McFadzean  (1903&#150;1996), <span class="occ">businessman</span>, was born on 17 December 1903 in Stranraer, Wigtownshire, Scotland, the second of the three sons of Henry McFadzean (<i>d</i>. 1918), cheese merchant and travelling instructor in cheese-making, and his wife, Agnes Wylie Hunter (<i>d</i>. 1960). He was educated at Stranraer Academy and high school, and read law and chartered accountancy at Glasgow University, but graduated only in accountancy in 1922. Having been articled to McLay, McAllister, and McGibbon, chartered accountants, in Glasgow in 1922, he qualified as a chartered accountant in 1927, and moved to London to join Chalmers Wade. On 8 June 1933 he married Eileen Gordon (<i>b</i>. 1911/12), daughter of Arthur Gordon, of Blundellsands, Lancashire. They had one son and two daughters, one of whom was adopted.<br>
<br>McFadzean moved to Liverpool in 1932 to become the accountant of British Insulated Cables Ltd, a client of Chalmers Wade. He became financial secretary in 1937 and executive manager in 1942, playing a key role in the company's contribution to war production, and he was closely involved in planning the merger with Callender's Cable and Construction Company in 1945. He joined the board of the new company, British Insulated Callender's Cables (BICC) as executive director in 1945 and after being appointed deputy chairman in 1947, and chief executive director in 1950, he became chairman and managing director of BICC in 1954. He played an important part in its growth in the post-war years from a small cable company to an international cable and construction group. He realized that if the company was to expand, it could not confine its operations to England, and he negotiated partnerships and co-operative deals, including one with Rio-Tinto Zinc (RTZ) and British Aluminium; he was deputy chairman of RTZ/BICC Aluminium Holdings Ltd from 1967 to 1973. During his chairmanship of BICC exports and overseas sales grew from &pound;3 million to &pound;250 million. McFadzean retired as managing director in 1961, and chairman in 1973, when he became honorary life president.<br>
<br>McFadzean was knighted in 1960. He was president of the Federation of British Industries (later the Confederation of British Industry) from 1959 to 1961, and was the first chairman of the British National Export Council from 1964 to 1966, and president from 1966 to 1968. He was also a founder member of the Export Council for Europe in 1960, serving for four years, and a member of the Commonwealth Export Council from 1964 to 1966. McFadzean wanted the government to back a strong export policy for British companies. BICC was the largest employer in Huyton, Harold Wilson's constituency, and McFadzean was a friend of the prime minister, who rewarded him for his services to exports with a life peerage in 1966.<br>
<br>Banking was another area which interested McFadzean. He was appointed to the board of Midland Bank in 1959, and was deputy chairman from 1968 to 1977, remaining a director until 1981. During the period of his deputy chairmanship, in 1971, Midland Bank was part of a consortium that bought Thomas Cook, the travel agent business, which had been nationalized after the war. This went on to become a profitable part of the Midland Bank group. Midland Bank was one of the clearing banks that shared in the rescue of the secondary banks during the secondary banking crisis of 1974. McFadzean was also involved in the nuclear industry, as president of the British Nuclear Forum from 1964 to 1966, and later as deputy chairman of the National Nuclear Corporation from 1973 to 1980.<br>
<br>McFadzean, chairman of the Council of Industrial Federations of the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) from 1960 to 1963, supported Britain's entry into the Common Market, and was one of the first British businessmen to see the advantages of a political union. He made his maiden, and only, speech in the House of Lords on 26 July 1971 during the debate on the government white paper <span class="italic">The United Kingdom and the European Communities</span>. In this he described the Common Market as an &#145;inspiring conception&#146;  (<span class="italic">Hansard 5L</span>, 5th ser., 65&#150;9), and talked of the tragedy of Britain's lack of involvement in the talks leading up to the treaty of Rome in 1957. Emphasizing the importance of Britain's being part of a larger economic grouping, he argued that Britain had to join the EEC, already an economic success, in order to halt the decline of its competitive position in the world, and take advantage of the great potential of a larger market. He also thought that membership would give the British people a new sense of purpose and direction.<br>
<br>McFadzean was created a knight of the Thistle in 1976. He died of bronchopneumonia, following a stroke, on 14 January 1996, at Bybrook House Nursing Home, Middle Hill, Box, Wiltshire. He was survived by his wife, son, and daughter, his adopted daughter having predeceased him.<br>
