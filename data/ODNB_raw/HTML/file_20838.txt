<span class="headword">Ormerod,  Oliver</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1626), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and religious controversialist</span>, was the second son of Oliver Ormerod of Ormerod, Lancashire, and his wife, Sibill Hargrave. He was admitted to Emmanuel College, Cambridge, on 6 June 1596, and graduated BA in 1600. In 1605&#150;6 he was rector of Little Wenham, Suffolk.<br>
<br>Ormerod was the author of two works of religious controversy, attacking puritans and Roman Catholics respectively. <span class="italic">The Picture of a Puritane</span> (1605) is written &#145;in a most plaine and familiar manner&#146;, designed (as Ormerod states in the preface) to &#145;bring yourselves, your wives, your children and your servants, to a full detestation of the Puritan-faction&#146;. It consists of two sets of dialogues: the first between an &#145;Englishman&#146; and a &#145;Germaine&#146;, showing the doctrinal similarities between English puritans and German anabaptists, with examples drawn from the Marprelate tracts and the writings of Thomas Cartwright, &#145;which many nowadays doe make as great account of as Oracles&#146;; the second between a &#145;Protestant&#146; and a &#145;Puritane&#146;, including a report of the Hampton Court conference, in which the puritans were &#145;vanquished in open disputation &hellip; and driven to confess that their opinions were mere novelties and new devised fancies&#146;. In the final dialogue Ormerod criticized the episcopal toleration of moderate puritan ministers, arguing that &#145;it does not stand with equitie, that some Ministers should be bound to shew their conformitie, and others be dispensed with&#146;.<br>
<br>The success of the work led Ormerod to publish a companion-piece entitled <span class="italic">The Picture of a Papist</span> (1606), written in similar style as a set of dialogues between a &#145;Minister&#146; and a &#145;Recusant&#146;. The work was entered in the Stationers' register on 9 December 1605, only a month after the discovery of the Gunpowder Plot, and violently denounces the conspirators, expressing the hope:<blockquote>that their privities might be cut off, and thrown into the fire &hellip; that their bellies might be ripped up, and their hearts torn out &hellip; and that their quarters might be fixed upon the gates of our Cities, and exposed to the eyes of men.</blockquote>In the preface Ormerod denied any connection with Thomas Dekker's pamphlet <span class="italic">The Double PP</span> (1605), &#145;which some in London have reported to be of my drawing&#146;, and declared that it was &#145;a greate disgrace to our Religion&#146; that &#145;histrionicall jesters and stage players should be suffered to write books of such matters&#146;.<br>
<br>Both these works provoked indignant responses from other writers. In his <span class="italic">Short Dialogue</span> (1605) the puritan minister Samuel Hieron challenged the accuracy of Ormerod's account &#145;of a man in Oxfordshire who as the Pamphletter saith, being one of the puritan faction, when his Father's ribs were broken, would not ride for a bonesetter on the Saboth day&#146;. According to Hieron, &#145;the Father's ribb was never broken; he had a bruise indeede with a fall, and the meanes was seasonably used, and he soone recovered&#146;; however, the story was repeated without alteration in the second edition (1605) of <span class="italic">The Picture of a Puritane</span>, &#145;newly corrected and enlarged&#146;. The anonymous Roman Catholic author of <span class="italic">The Image of Bothe Churches</span> (1623) also criticized &#145;Ormerode, the picturemaker, who upon erroneous misconceaving, condemned that singular and renowned Doctor Allen, for affirming that princes might be slayne by their subjects&#146;.<br>
<br>On 20 March 1610 Ormerod was presented to the rectory of Norton Fitzwarren, Somerset, resigning on 31 March 1617 when he was presented to the rectory of Huntspill, Somerset, where he remained until his death; the patron of both livings was William Bourchier, third earl of Bath. In or before 1619 he married Joan 
    (or Johanna; <i>d</i>. 1638/9)
  , daughter of Richard Hinkson, possibly from Kent. Ormerod's will, dated 17 January 1626, shows him to have been a wealthy man: it bequeathes the sum of &pound;100 to his son Richard, &pound;300 to his eldest daughter, Anne, and &pound;200 each to his younger daughters Jane and Elizabeth. He charged his widow &#145;to be careful in the tutoring and well bringing up of my children&#146;, and left their legacies to be managed by her, &#145;because my said children are young and not of themselves able to govern their estates&#146;. Ormerod died soon afterwards; his will was proved on 28 June.<br>
