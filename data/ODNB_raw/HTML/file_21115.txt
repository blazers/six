<span class="headword">Paget,  John</span>  (1808&#150;1892), <span class="occ">agriculturist and writer on Hungary</span>, was born on 18 April 1808 at Loughborough, Leicestershire, the eldest of the three children of John Paget (1773&#150;1833), manufacturer, and his wife, Anne (1789&#150;1811), daughter of John Hunt, surgeon. His father, a pillar of the Unitarian church in the midlands, retired to the estates at Thorpe Satchville, which he bought about 1821. Paget completed his early education at Revd Charles Berry's academy, a Unitarian private academy in Leicester, and in 1823 was sent to Manchester College, York. He matriculated at Trinity College, Dublin, in 1827 as a medical student, but received his degree of MD from Edinburgh University in 1831. He never used the title or practised, although he successfully pursued further medical studies in Paris and maintained a lifelong interest in medicine. Between 1833 and 1837 he travelled extensively on the continent. During the winter season in Rome in 1835 he met the Baroness Polyxena Wessel&eacute;nyi (1801&#150;1878), the estranged wife of a Hungarian magnate, Baron L&aacute;szl&oacute; B&aacute;nffy, a highly cultivated woman and society belle. They married on 15 November 1836, on Paget's second visit to Hungary (the first had been in 1835). As a result of these visits, Paget gained an intimate knowledge of Hungarian society including the protagonists of the liberal opposition.<br>
<br>Out of his rich experience Paget produced a well-written travelogue in two volumes: <span class="italic">Hungary and Transylvania; with Remarks on their Condition, Social, Political, Economical</span> (1839), illustrated by George Hering, who had accompanied him to Hungary. The book was well received and soon translated into German. It was, however, on account of the Hungarian war of independence in 1848&#150;9 that the work achieved the prominence it deserved. In the general search for reliable background information on Hungary it was &#145;ransacked&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 3 April 1850) by editors, and new issues followed in quick succession (1849, 1850, 1855), including an American edition (1850). Many of Paget's observations found their way into reference books.<br>
<br>Before the war of independence Paget purchased an estate in Transylvania at Gy&eacute;res where he settled with his family and was granted Hungarian citizenship by an act of the diet of Transylvania in 1847. There he devoted his energies to introducing the latest farming techniques, modern machinery, improved animal husbandry, and selective horse breeding. However, all his efforts were ruined in late 1849 or early January 1850, when marauding Romanian peasants burnt down his English-style manor house and destroyed his possessions; he fled with his family to England. After periods in Loughborough (and subsequently Dresden and Nizza) the family was able to return to Gy&eacute;res in 1855 having finally (with the assistance of the British authorities) managed to obtain safe conduct. Paget spent the rest of his life there in high-standard farming and viniculture.<br>
<br>During his time in Transylvania Paget had been a staunch supporter of the Unitarian church there, and had forged strong links with British Unitarians. As a result, he came to the rescue of the independent Unitarian schooling when it was threatened by measures of the Austrian government (1857).<br>
<br>Paget also published scientific treatises and was a contributor to <span class="italic">Erd&eacute;lyi Gazda</span> on agricultural matters. A regular visitor to, and adjudicator at, international agricultural fairs, in 1878 he was awarded the L&eacute;gion d'honneur at the World Exhibition in Paris. His wife died in the same year. Paget himself died on 10 April 1892 at Gy&eacute;res; he was buried on 12 April in the H&aacute;zsong&aacute;rd cemetery at Kolozsv&aacute;r. Both of his sons predeceased him&#151;the elder, Walter, in childhood, and the younger, Oliver (1841&#150;1863), who fought in the Hungarian legion of Garibaldi, at the age of twenty-two.<br>
