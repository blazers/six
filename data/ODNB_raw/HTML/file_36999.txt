<span class="headword">Wood,  Francis Derwent</span>  (1871&#150;1926), <span class="occ">sculptor</span>, was born on 15 October 1871 at Eskin Place, Castlerigg, St John's, Keswick, Cumberland, fourth child of Alpheus Bayliss Wood, of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, pencil mill manager (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1908), and Ann Mary, daughter of John Hornby Maw, of Ironbridge, Shropshire (<i>c</i>.1830&#150;1916). His parents were educated, artistic, and impoverished; Alpheus a capable watercolourist with an eye for antiques; Ann Mary, well read in Greek, Latin, and Hebrew, had been taught to paint by Ruskin. Francis Derwent Wood rejected their rigorous Christianity from an early age. The Woods moved to Switzerland in 1880. Frank was small for his age, nicknamed Le Microbe as a schoolboy at Coll&egrave;ge Gaillard, Lausanne. He was soon fluent in three languages and was a passionate sketcher and fossil hunter. After he had spent two years at the <i>Kunstgewerbeschule</i> in Karlsruhe, Germany, where the family moved in 1885, in 1887 his mother wrote to Hamo Thornycroft seeking advice about her son's prospects as a sculptor. Impressed by the photographs she enclosed, Thornycroft became a lifelong mentor and friend of Derwent Wood (as he was often known).<br>
<br>Having returned to Shropshire in July 1887, Wood entered art school and worked as a modeller for the family firm of Maw &amp; Co., tile manufacturers of Ironbridge, and later for the Coalbrookdale foundry. He enrolled at the National Art Training School in 1890 where he studied under Lant&eacute;ri, winning a national scholarship. A year later he became paid assistant to Alphonse Legros at the Slade School of Fine Art. As a student at the Royal Academy Schools from 1894 he assisted Thomas Brock and, among many prizes, in 1895 won a gold medal and &pound;200 travelling scholarship for <span class="italic">Daedalus and Icarus</span>, a work influenced by Alfred Gilbert (bronze, Bristol City Art Gallery; plaster, Russell-Cotes Art Gallery, Bournemouth). <span class="italic">Circe</span> was his first exhibit at the Royal Academy of 1895. The scholarship financed a year in Paris where, in his studio at 9 rue Falgui&egrave;re, Wood made sculpture that he successfully exhibited at the Salon. Among many artists he encountered, Wood particularly befriended Gauguin, whose paintings he greatly admired.<br>
<br>Between 1897 and 1900 Wood continued to assist Brock and was visiting director of modelling at Glasgow School of Art. Architectural commissions in Glasgow include figures of the arts for the Kelvingrove Gallery (<i>c</i>.1898). In London, Edwin Lutyens's Britannic House, Finsbury Circus, bears later architectural work (1921&#150;5).<br>
<br>In 1900 Wood took the studio at 27 Glebe Place, Chelsea, and was elected a member of the Art-Workers' Guild in 1901. He married Florence Mary Schmidt (1873&#150;1969), a successful Australian soprano, on 25 March 1903 at St John's Church, Paddington. They lived until 1908 at 23 Clareville Grove, South Kensington, where their only son, Oliver, was born on 20 June 1904. In that year Wood became a founder member of the Society of British Sculptors. He was elected an associate of the Royal Academy in 1910 and Royal Academician in 1920. Increasing success enabled the purchase of the lease of 18 Carlyle Square in 1911. Friends including Augustus John, Walter Sickert, Ambrose McEvoy, George Lambert, and D. H. Lawrence joined them for lively musical evenings at which Florence sang and her &#145;darling Fran&ccedil;ois&#146; played the flute.<br>
<br>Derwent Wood's numerous public monuments include <span class="italic">Sir Titus Salt</span>, Saltaire, Yorkshire (bronze, 1903), <span class="italic">General Wolfe</span>, Westerham, Kent (bronze, 1910), <span class="italic">Edward VII</span>, Rangoon (exh. RA, 1914), <span class="italic">William Pitt</span> (marble, exh. RA, 1918; Capitol, Washington, DC), and portraying a friend, <span class="italic">F. Henry Royce</span> (bronze, exh. RA, 1922; Derby). He also contributed the Australia Gate figures to Brock's Victoria memorial. Wood's portraits are remarkable for their modelling and character. <span class="italic">Henry James</span> (marble, exh. RA, 1914; Tate collection), <span class="italic">T. E. Lawrence</span> (bronze, exh. RA, 1920; Tate collection), and <span class="italic">Ambrose McEvoy</span> (bronze, exh. RA, 1915; NPG) are among many whose vigorous and animated features reveal the artist's greatest strength.<br>
<br>Wood joined up as an orderly in the Royal Army Medical Corps in 1915 and used his skills to develop a technique for masking facial disfigurements. He was commissioned in March 1916 on the strength of this distressing and vital work, and published his methods in <span class="italic">The Lancet</span> in 1917.<br>
<br>War memorials for Liverpool's cotton exchange, for Keswick (exh. RA, 1922), and for Ditchingham, Norfolk (bronze, exh. RA, 1920), were among those that dominated his tenure as professor of sculpture at the Royal College of Art from 1918 to 1923. The machine-gun corps memorial at Hyde Park, whose plinth is inscribed to the corps's &#145;Glorious heroes&#146;, is frequently criticized as an anodyne glorification of war (unveiled 1925, exh. RA, 1925, 1926). Wood intended the idealized David to represent the solitary machine-gunner, whose tragic role in the mechanized destruction of enemy hordes is revealed in the inscription &#145;Saul hath slain his thousands, but David his ten thousands&#146;. He believed that if war memorials must be made, they should not evade the carnage of conflict. The monument teeters ambiguously between the glorification and the pathos of war.<br>
<br>Francis Derwent Wood was a prolific intellectual traditionalist whose influences ranged from the French Renaissance to Alfred Stevens, Gilbert, and Thornycroft. Rare stylistic experiments include <span class="italic">Penitent Thief</span> (bronze, 1918; Lady Lever Art Gallery, Port Sunlight) and <span class="italic">La Paimpolaise</span> (teak, beech, and tin, exh. RA, 1899). Typical of his classical realism are <span class="italic">Psyche</span> (bronze, exh. RA, 1908, 1919; Chantrey purchase 1919, Tate collection; bronze, 1920, Lady Lever Art Gallery, Port Sunlight) and <span class="italic">Atalanta</span> (exh. plaster RA, 1907, marble 1909; Manchester City Galleries). A bronze cast of <span class="italic">Atalanta</span>, erected in his memory by friends from the Chelsea Arts Club in 1929, was stolen from Chelsea Embankment in 1991.<br>
<br>A charming smile and frequent laughter leavened Derwent Wood's severe features. Modest in ordinary conversation, he could be argumentative and he voiced strong opinions about art. He abhorred capital punishment, had no time for Scotsmen, and was a generous employer whose assistants were well rewarded. He loved the Chelsea Arts Club, where he refuelled on cigarettes and legendary quantities of gin and bitters. He cut a flamboyant and dashing figure at the Chelsea Arts balls when he indulged his love of historic dress. He once appeared as Dante, whom he resembled. He was a member of the Garrick Club.<br>
<br>Wood sketched and painted on holidays in France with Henry Royce, and at Amberley, Sussex, with the Sickerts. Drawings, caricatures, and bold woodcuts occupied him during his final illness. After surgery for lung cancer, Francis Derwent Wood died on 19 February 1926 at 14 Henrietta Street, Westminster. A memorial service overflowing with mourners followed his burial on 23 February at Amberley church. Until it was stolen, one of his own sculptures marked his grave.<br>
