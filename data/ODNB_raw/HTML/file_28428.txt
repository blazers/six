<span class="headword">Walcher</span>, earl of Northumbria  (<em>d.</em> 1080), <span class="occ">bishop of Durham</span>, was the Lotharingian priest chosen by William the Conqueror to succeed in 1071 to the troubled see of Durham, following William's harrying of the north in 1069 and 1070 and the rebellion and outlawing of the previous bishop, the Anglo-Saxon &AElig;thelwine. In the tenth and eleventh centuries Lotharingia was prominent as a centre of ecclesiastical reform and Walcher was not the first of his contemporaries to join the English episcopacy; he was preceded, for example, by Duduc of Wells (1033&#150;1061?) and Giso of Wells (1061?&#150;1088). Nothing is known of Walcher's background except that he was a clerk at Li&egrave;ge when William invited him to come to Durham.<br>
<br>In 1071 Walcher began his journey to the embattled north complete with bodyguard, accompanied as far as York, according to the principal source, Symeon of Durham, by the housecarl Eilaf and &#145;many other leading men&#146;. From York he was escorted to Durham by the Northumbrian earl, Gospatric. The next year, 1072, William the Conqueror, in a further attempt to break rebel networks in the north dismissed Gospatric, appointing Waltheof of Huntingdon in his place. Waltheof had local ties but at the same time was bound by marriage to William and initially at least was prepared to work with Walcher. Symeon gives a picture of their beleaguered co-operation: the Conqueror had built a castle at Durham &#145;where the bishop might keep himself and his people safe from the attacks of assailants. Bishop Walcher and earl Waltheof were very friendly and accommodating to each other; so that he, sitting together with the bishop in the synod of priests, humbly and obediently carried out whatever the bishop decreed for the reformation of Christianity in his earldom&#146;  (<span class="roman">Sym. Dur., <i>Opera</i></span>, vol. 2, s.a. 1072). Recent excavations give some indication of how formidable Walcher's castle really was. The moat was at least 19 yards wide, 164 yards long, and 6 yards deep. In the building no expense seems to have been spared; William I had given Walcher an estate at Waltham, Essex, and it is likely that he used its revenues to further the castle's construction.<br>
<br>Symeon's rosy picture notwithstanding, within three years of Walcher's arrival Waltheof had joined a rebellion against the Conqueror which was to cost him his life. The earldom was now given to Walcher. The office required, to use Symeon's words, skill &#145;in difficult affairs&#146;; how far Walcher possessed this it is hard to tell. According to Symeon, Walcher was &#145;a man worthily beloved by all for the honesty of his life and the sobriety and gentleness of his nature; yet he too displeased the natives by permitting his followers unrestrainedly to do whatever they pleased, nor did he check them when they acted wrongfully. Moreover, his archdeacon [Leobwine] swept away from the church many of its ornaments and much of its money and distributed them among his own friends and relations&#146;  (<span class="roman">Sym. Dur., <i>Opera</i></span>, vol. 1, c. 58).<br>
<br>It is around archdeacon Leobwine that the final drama of Walcher's life centres. Leobwine, so Symeon relates, had become jealous of the place in Walcher's affection and counsels of Ligulf, a local nobleman without whose advice Walcher would not carry out the greater matters of secular business. In 1080, on Leobwine's orders, Ligulf and most of his family were slain in their beds. The murder was laid at the door of Walcher, perpetrated as it had been, not only by the plotting of his archdeacon, but also by the complicity of his deputy and his knights. Despite protestations of innocence Walcher could therefore neither expect, nor did he receive, any mercy. On 14 May 1080, at Gateshead, where they had gone for an alleged peace meeting, he, his entourage&#151;a hundred French and Flemish according to the <span class="roman">Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</span>&#151;and Leobwine were killed. Walcher thus became the tenth Northumbrian earl since 993 to have met a violent end. Murky though the details are, it is clear that behind his death lay a history of feud that predated not only his own accession to power but also the conquest itself. According to John of Worcester, Walcher's murderer was Eadwulf Rus, a man who came from the same house as Ligulf's widow (the house of Bamburgh) and who had scores of his own to settle; his father had been killed by Tostig, the earl Edward the Confessor had imposed on Northumbria in 1064. William the Conqueror's reprisals to the deaths at Gateshead were both savage and decisive. Northumbria was once again ruthlessly harried and terrorized and a new castle&#151;the Newcastle of the future&#151;built on the site of Walcher's murder.<br>
<br>As a bishop, Walcher's career was not, however, simply dominated by the politics that beset his earldom. In his insistence that his cathedral clergy should sing canonical rather than monastic offices he may have shown himself to be unsympathetic to the traditions of his see but against this can be offset his encouragement of the revival of Northumbrian monasticism. In the early 1070s a small band of monks from Evesham and Winchcombe, fired by their reading of Bede's <span class="italic">Historia ecclesiastica</span>, had set off to the north to recreate the way of life of the first Anglo-Saxon monks. Their arrival was welcomed by Walcher who gave them first Bede's monastery at Jarrow to repair and resettle and then, after their successful establishment of a community there, the Anglo-Saxon foundation of Whitby. Melrose, in Scotland, was their next destination but Walcher, under pain of excommunication, recalled the monks who had gone there so they would remain in Northumbria and restore the other Bedan monastery of Wearmouth. Under Walcher's protection, according to Symeon, monasticism, destroyed two hundred years earlier by viking incursions, could now flourish again; &#145;like a loving father&#146; Walcher frequently visited the monks and &#145;liberally bestowed upon them whatever they required&#146;  (<span class="roman">Sym. Dur., <i>Opera</i></span>, vol. 1, c. 57). Had he lived, he had plans to introduce a monastic community into his cathedral to act as the guardians of St Cuthbert's shrine and to himself become a monk. At his death, it was the monks of Jarrow who came to fetch his body. The buildings of Jarrow erected during Walcher's episcopacy can be associated stylistically with Lotharingian models and it has been suggested that Walcher may have employed in Northumbria masons from his homeland. There would seem to be no doubt that Walcher's commitment to the cause of monastic reform was both deep and of long standing; this would not, of course, have precluded, but rather strengthened, his appreciation that if Norman power was ever to become acceptable in the north it would only be through the intercession and veneration of local saints and shrines.<br>
<br>Walcher was buried in his cathedral; but under the circumstances it was, to Symeon of Durham, &#145;a funeral less honourable than became a bishop&#146;  (<span class="roman">Sym. Dur., <i>Opera</i></span>, vol. 1, c. 59).<br>
