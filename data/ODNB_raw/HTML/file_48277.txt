<span class="headword">Bartlett,  Abraham Dee</span>  (1812&#150;1897), <span class="occ">taxidermist and zoo superintendent</span>, was born in London on 27 October 1812, second son of John Bartlett, hairdresser and brush maker, and Jane Dunster. As a boy he was allowed to play in the beast room of the Royal Menagerie, Exeter 'Change, London, run by Edward Cross, his father's friend. His fondness for living animals led to an interest in taxidermy that was encouraged by Cross. At fourteen he was apprenticed to his father at his premises at 83 Drury Lane, London. He detested the hairdressing trade, and about 1834 became a taxidermist, trading at Little Russell Street, Covent Garden. He married Lydia Norvall, with whom he had four daughters, Clara (<i>b</i>. 1840), Emma (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1844), Julia (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1848), and Ellen (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1851), and two sons, Edward (1844&#150;1908) and Clarence (<i>c</i>.1848&#150;1903). His business proved successful, which permitted a move to a larger house in Camden Town (he owned three residences at his death).<br>
<br>Bartlett worked for leading naturalists, the British Museum, the Zoological Society of London (through the patronage of its secretary, David Mitchell), and the royal family; Queen Victoria gave him a gold watch for caring for her pet birds. His taxidermy display, including a reconstruction of the dodo, at the Great Exhibition of 1851 earned him a gold medal and an appointment as naturalist to the new Crystal Palace Company in 1852. He acted as London agent for the Calcutta-based curator Edward Blyth, and occasionally handled the latter's dealings in live animals with British purchasers. His association with the Zoological Society and familiarity with wild animals led to his being offered the superintendency of the zoological gardens in Regent's Park, London, in 1859, upon the death of John Thompson. He took up residence at the zoo and remained in post there until his death.<br>
<br>To the public, Bartlett <i>was</i> the zoo, a familiar figure in his long coat and top hat. Among notable zoo events with which he was associated was the controversial sale of the famous elephant Jumbo to P. T. Barnum. As a child he had seen an elephant run amok at the Exeter 'Change menagerie, and knew Jumbo had become too dangerous to remain in the zoo. He became an authority on the captive care of wild animals, and published nearly sixty papers and notes on the subject in the <span class="italic">Proceedings of the Zoological Society</span> and other journals. Among many honours he was awarded a silver medal by the Zoological Society in 1872, and made an associate of the Linnean Society in 1879.<br>
<br>Bartlett died at the zoological gardens on 7 May 1897, after a lingering illness. He was buried at St James's cemetery, Highgate, Middlesex, on 13 May. His younger son, Clarence, succeeded him in the post of superintendent of the zoo (having previously been assistant superintendent for twenty-four years), remaining there until a month before his death in 1903. Bartlett's elder son, Edward, a taxidermist, travelled as an animal collector to Peru. He became curator of the Maidstone Museum and later of Raja Brooke's museum, Kuching (Sarawak, Malaysia), and returned to England shortly before his father's death.<br>
