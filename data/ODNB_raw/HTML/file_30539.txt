<span class="headword">Baird,  Andrew Wilson</span>  (1842&#150;1908), <span class="occ">tidal surveyor</span>, was the eldest son in a family of five sons and four daughters born to Thomas Baird, of Woodlands, Cults, Aberdeen, and his wife, Catherine Imray. He was born in Aberdeen on 26 April 1842 and was educated in the town first at the grammar school and then at Marischal College. Baird entered the Military College of the East India Company at Addiscombe in June 1860 and was transferred to the Royal Military Academy at Woolwich in January 1861. He was commissioned lieutenant in the Royal Engineers on 18 December 1861 and, after instruction at Chatham, sailed for India on 1 March 1864. His first assignment was to help with harbour defence and reclamation work in Bombay. During 1868 he served as assistant field engineer to the Abyssinian expedition under Sir Robert Napier. For his work as traffic manager of the railway from the base he was mentioned in dispatches and received the war medal.<br>
<br>In December 1869 Baird became assistant superintendent of the trigonometrical survey of India and was employed on the triangulation in Kathiawar and Gujarat. His health suffered from the extreme heat and he went on furlough in the spring of 1870. While at home he married in Aberdeen on 14 March 1872 Margaret Elizabeth, only daughter of Charles Davidson, of Forrester Hill. In Britain he studied methods of tidal observations and their reduction by harmonic analysis using the method of Sir William Thomson, later Lord Kelvin. Tidal observations were initially undertaken for the survey of India only to determine the mean sea level for the trigonometrical survey, but, on his return to India in December 1871, Baird extended their scope to investigate changing sea level, setting up self-registering gauges, which he himself calibrated and adjusted, for long periods at three stations in the Gulf of Cutch.<br>
<br>In 1876 the governor-general in council commended Baird's work, which Baird described to the British Association at Glasgow that year. In 1877 it was decided to extend systematic tidal observations under the supervision of Baird, who had become deputy superintendent in the trigonometrical survey department. He organized a new department of the survey to cover the coast from Aden to Rangoon, with its centre at Poona. Over an area that included India, Burma, Ceylon, and the Andaman Islands, Baird began to record, collate, and process precise data on tides. In July 1881, while in Venice as one of the commissioners from India to the third International Congress of Geography, Baird exhibited the use of tidal and levelling apparatus in a canal and for this was awarded the gold medal of the first class. After some eighteen months on furlough in England, Baird resumed his tidal duties in March 1883. In August that year the wave which followed the volcanic eruption of Krakatoa, Java, was traced in all his tidal diagrams and Baird sent a paper on this subject to the Royal Society, of which he was elected fellow the following May.<br>
<br>From July 1885 to August 1897 Baird was master of the mint at Calcutta and Bombay and also assistant and deputy surveyor-general of India. On 12 August 1889 he became permanent mint-master at Calcutta. He reorganized the manufacturing department and successfully advocated the withdrawal of worn and dirt-encrusted coinage. He reached the rank of colonel on 9 April 1896 and retired on 20 April 1897. He was created CSI in June 1897. On his return to Britain he bought a small property at Palmers Cross, near Elgin. He died suddenly of heart failure in London on 2 April 1908 and was buried in Highgate cemetery. His wife, five daughters, and two sons survived him.<br>
<br>By the time of his death forty stations covered by Baird's department were regularly reporting tidal observations, a fact which speaks highly of his scientific and administrative skills. He had organized the first extensive tidal studies using harmonic analysis which, with his improvements, was subsequently widely adopted. He was the author of many papers on tidal observations and surveying.<br>
