<span class="headword">Post,  Julius Ferdinand Hans Ernst <span class="st"> [Felix]</span></span>  (1913&#150;2001), <span class="occ">psychiatrist</span>, was born on 25 July 1913 at Berlin-Wilmersdorf, Germany, the only child of Paul Post (1882&#150;1956), director and curator of the Zeughaus Museum, Berlin, and his wife, Clarissa Olga (Clary), <i>n&eacute;e</i> Daus (1887&#150;1980), daughter of the theatre director Felix Daus. Living in fashionable Charlottenburg, Berlin, Felix, as he was always known, was educated at a series of schools in Berlin, finally attending the Herderschule Stadisches Reformrealgymnasium. He entered medical school in 1932, spending one term each in Hamburg and Berlin.<br>
<br>Post had been baptized and confirmed, but as his mother was of Jewish descent, and he was left wing, with the rise of Nazism he left for England to continue studying medicine. He qualified at St Bartholomew's Hospital medical school in 1939. During the Second World War he worked with the leading psychiatrists Aubrey Lewis at Mill Hill and D. K. Henderson in Edinburgh. In 1944 he passed the examinations for the membership of the Royal College of Physicians (London) and the diploma in psychological medicine, and his first paper on older people's mental health was published, in the <span class="italic">Journal of Mental Science</span>. He then spent eighteen months in the Royal Army Medical Corps, and was promoted major. In the war his emotions were affected by anxiety about his parents (they both survived in Germany), unemployment because of his nationality, internment on the Isle of Man as an enemy alien, marriage on 1 August 1941 to Cecily Elisabeth (Betty) Burnett (1907&#150;1961), the death in infancy of their first child, and the birth of their son (Anthony) Julian in 1944. Their daughter, Deborah, was born in 1949.<br>
<br>Post was appointed to the staff of the Maudsley Hospital in 1947, where Lewis earmarked him to lead the proposed geriatric unit at the Bethlem Royal Hospital &#145;I obeyed &hellip; to say without enthusiasm would be an understatement&#146;, he later said  (Post, &#145;In the beginning&#146;, 15). But within a few years any reluctance to work with older people had been transformed into a therapeutic optimism and a zeal for the specialism. His in-patient ward, out-patient clinics, research, teaching, and the Gresham Club (a pioneering after-care club for former in-patients) all flourished. But the medical committee kept a tight rein on further developments, in particular not permitting longer-term treatment of dementia within the hospital, much to Post's chagrin. At the Maudsley and Bethlem hospitals he played key roles on numerous committees, including secretary and chairman of the medical committee. As chairman (1966&#150;9) he demonstrated considerable leadership qualities, as during the difficult transition when both Lewis and David Davies, dean of the medical school, retired at the same time. By the 1970s, however, Post had considerably reduced his committee work. The medical committee's frequent unambiguously negative views, undermining service development for older people, probably influenced this change. It also coincided with a new role focusing specifically on the development of older people's services, as first chairman of the group for the psychiatry of old age at the Royal College of Psychiatrists (1973&#150;8).<br>
<br>Post always remembered the great inflation during his childhood, saying &#145;since then I have despised money&#146;  (Post and Heuer), a factor probably contributing to his dedication to work within the National Health Service. Despite a predominant interest in older people, he continued to treat, and to contribute significantly to research on, younger mentally ill people. However, his most significant research contributions were two monographs, <span class="italic">The Significance of Affective Symptoms in Old Age</span> (1962) and <span class="italic">Persistent Persecutory States of the Elderly</span> (1966), both long-term follow-up studies, the former based on his DM dissertation. These clearly demonstrated that older people could be treated as effectively as younger people with the same illnesses, and helped to break the incorrect assumption that all mental illness in old age was part of dementia and therefore untreatable. These observations complemented and reinforced seminal research by Martin Roth, with whom Post worked on the geriatric sub-committee of the research and clinical section of the Royal Medico-Psychological Association (1951&#150;8). Post described <span class="italic">The Clinical Psychiatry of Late Life</span> (1965), probably the best-known textbook of old age psychiatry in its day, as &#145;fun to write&#146;, while his other books were &#145;all blood, sweat and tears&#146;  (Post, interview, <i>c</i>.1996). He wrote prolifically: as well as these three books, he was joint editor of two others, and wrote over sixty academic papers, and numerous chapters and conference papers.<br>
<br>Post's first wife, Betty, died of a cerebral haemorrhage in 1961. He married Kathleen Jane Brittain (<i>c</i>.1910&#150;2004) the following year, another close and successful marriage. The family lived at 3 Ridgeway Place, Wimbledon, but after his retirement in 1978 Post and his wife moved to 7 Leeward Gardens nearby. Honours conferred on him included fellowship of the Royal College of Physicians (1963), honorary fellowship of the Royal College of Psychiatrists (1981), a special award from the International Psychogeriatric Association (1995), and the British Geriatrics Society's fiftieth anniversary medal in 1997, &#145;in recognition of outstanding services to geriatric medicine&#146;. When asked about his greatest disappointment, he replied &#145;I would have liked to have had a Chair &hellip; teaching was my favourite occupation &hellip; I would like to have been my own master&#146;  (Post, interview, <i>c</i>.1996).<br>
<br>Post was fortunate early in his career in his serendipitous sharing of common clinical interests and work opportunities in an outstanding teaching hospital with the influential Lewis, later retaining a good working relationship but remaining in awe of him. His contribution to the development of old age psychiatry lay in his dedicated, passionate care of his patients, his ability to pose relevant research hypotheses and to pursue his research to a conclusion, the clarity of his writings, and his charismatic and inspiring teaching of junior doctors, a significant number of whom went on to become psychiatrists for older people, leading the development of the specialism both in Britain and worldwide. Few psychiatrists made such an impact on the development of care for mentally ill older people. He died of a myocardial infarct on 23 March 2001 at St George's Hospital, Tooting. He was cremated at Putney Vale cemetery and his ashes were scattered. He was survived by his wife, Kathleen (who died in 2004 of Alzheimer's disease), and by his son, Julian, and daughter, Deborah.<br>
