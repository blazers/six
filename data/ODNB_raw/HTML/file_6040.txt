<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Compton, Sir  William</span>  (1625&#150;1663), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was born at Compton Wynyates, Warwickshire, the third son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6035/', "Spencer Compton, second earl of Northampton (1601&#150;1643)")</script>, and his wife, Mary Beaumont (<i>d</i>. 1654), daughter of Sir Francis Beaumont. He was educated at Eton College (1634&#150;6), and in his eighteenth year joined his father's royalist regiment, and served with it at the taking of Banbury on 8 August 1642. He led his men in three attacks, and had two horses shot under him during the fighting. Upon the surrender of the town and castle he was made lieutenant-governor under his father, and brought over many to the king's interest. He was knighted at Oxford on 12 December 1643. William and his elder brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/46937/', "James Compton, third earl of Northampton")</script>, worked together uneasily. James blamed William for the capture of the family home, Compton Wynyates, on 9 June 1644 because he had refused to accept James's nominated governor, placing an inexperienced colleague in command. In July 1644 Banbury was besieged by parliamentarian forces from Northamptonshire, Warwick, and Coventry, but Compton resisted the leaguer for three months in what was regarded as a heroic and inspiring defence until his brother, Northampton, raised the siege on 26 October. Compton remained as governor of Banbury until after the king left Oxford, when he was ordered to surrender the garrison, which he did on 8 May 1646, receiving good terms: all officers were allowed to keep their horses, swords, goods, and money, and were given safe conduct.<br>
<br>A landowner in Kent, in 1648 Compton became embroiled in the Kentish rebellion, serving as major-general under George Goring, earl of Norwich. After the defeat at the battle of Maidstone and the failure to gain access to London, Norwich's shrinking army turned towards Essex. When rebellion broke out at Chelmsford on 4 June parliament moved quickly to pardon the rebels on condition they did not support Norwich. The earl dashed to Chelmsford to enlist the rebels' support, leaving Compton in command at Bow Bridge, where he cut communications between London and Essex. On 8 June Norwich and Compton led their forces to Brentwood, where they joined the Essex rebels, and thereafter Compton's role was overshadowed by the military leadership of Sir Charles Lucas, who led the forces to Colchester to raise support. The royalists became trapped in the town when Fairfax and the New Model made a lightning march to the county, enduring siege from 13 June until 28 August. By the end of July they, and the townspeople, were reduced to eating cats and dogs. Upon surrender Compton was not singled out for court martial, unlike Lucas and others, who were shot. Oliver Cromwell is said to have referred to him as &#145;the sober young man, and the godly cavalier&#146;, and he escaped with a fine of &pound;600.<br>
<br>Even so, Compton was involved in royalist conspiracies from the inception of the republic, and in 1650 was felt to be crucial to Kent royalists' plans to seize Dover Castle. About 1651 he married Elizabeth Alington (<i>d</i>. 1671), widow of William, Baron Alington of Horseheath, Cambridgeshire, and sister of Sir Lionel Tollemache, who was married to Elizabeth Murray, countess of Dysart, one of the principal female intriguers of the period. Thereafter he resided in Cambridgeshire. From May 1654 onwards he was one of the six men who comprised the Sealed Knot, the secret organization which aimed to co-ordinate royalist risings. In 1655 he promised the Knot's reluctant support for Penruddock's rebellion, although no practical assistance was provided. Despite this Compton had to stay away from his Cambridgeshire home throughout the summer. Eventually he surrendered voluntarily to the government through the mediation of his brother-in-law Sir Lionel Tollemache. He was held only briefly, but thereafter the authorities kept records of his movements. He may have remained quiescent during 1656, but in the following year was embroiled in the Knot's discussions with the Leveller John Wildman. Compton played no major role in the plotting of the marquess of Ormond and Daniel O'Neill in early 1658, but in April he was arrested and placed in the Tower with fellow Knot members Sir Richard Willys and Colonel John Russell. Upon their release in July all three were warned by secretary Thurloe to expect no quarter if they were involved in future plots. Compton seems to have taken this to heart and his involvement in the conspiracies surrounding Booth's rising appear to have been minimal, even though his brother, the earl of Northampton, was briefly engaged in support for the national rising.<br>
<br>With the Restoration Compton was returned to parliament for the borough of Cambridge (11 March 1661), and appointed master of the ordnance by Charles II. He was a fairly active MP in the early sessions of the Cavalier Parliament. He died suddenly in Drury Lane, London, on 18 October 1663, and was buried at Compton Wynyates, where a monument was erected to his memory. Pepys recorded his shock at the death of &#145;one of the worthiest men and best officers of state now in England&#146;. Compton, Pepys thought, was &#145;of the best temper, valour, abilities of mind, integrity, birth, fine person and diligence of any man he hath left behind him in the three kingdoms&#146;  (Pepys, 4.338&#150;9).<br>
