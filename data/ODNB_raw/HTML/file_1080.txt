<span class="headword">Bain,  Alexander</span>  (1810&#150;1877), <span class="occ">clockmaker and inventor</span>, was born in October 1810 at Houstry, in the parish of Watten, Caithness, the fifth of eleven children of John Bain, a crofter, and his wife, Isobel Waiter. After a basic education at the local village school, Bain was apprenticed to John Sellar, a watchmaker, of Wick. Subsequently, in 1837, he travelled to London, found employment as a journeyman clockmaker in Clerkenwell, and began to attend lectures, exhibitions, and demonstrations on the principles and practices of electrical science. In 1838 he began to consider how a clock could be driven by electricity. His original ideas led to five important patents, dating from 1841 to 1852, and containing a wealth of innovative principles. Bain was the first person, anywhere, to devise an electromagnetically maintained pendulum clock. For this priority, and for his other achievements, he has been called the &#145;father of electrical horology&#146;. In 1843 Bain patented transmitting and receiving apparatus, based on the use of synchronized pendulums and scanning styli, which would enable &#145;copies of surfaces&#146;, such as drawings, to be sent electrically from one place to another. This patent was the first in the world in the field of picture telegraphy. In 1846 Bain opposed the formation of the Electric Telegraph Company, on the grounds that some of his patents would be infringed, and gave evidence to select committees of both houses of parliament. Following an agreement with the company's sponsors, he was awarded &pound;7500.<br>
<br>Bain married Matilda Bowie, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Davis (<i>d</i>. 1856), a widow, on 15 May 1844. They had two sons and two daughters, and for a few years (from the late 1840s) the family lived in Beevor Lodge, a large house in Hammersmith.<br>
<br>At the Great Exhibition of 1851 Bain was awarded the exhibition medal, in class 10, for his clocks, and at about this time he established a showroom and manufactory at 43 Old Bond Street, London.<br>
<br>Bain's ideas, patents, and inventions were numerous and varied. In addition to those relating to printing telegraphs, chemical telegraphs, and automatic telegraphs, and electric clocks, he contributed to the development of an electric log to record the speed of a ship underway; an electric alarm to give warning of fires in the holds of vessels; an apparatus to take soundings at sea; an electrical signalling instrument for use on railways; an effective (though incomplete) fire and police telegraph apparatus; an apparatus for communicating between the carriages of railway trains; another to enable the playing of musical instruments at a distance; a device for copying documents; apparatus for drawing off liquids; unspillable inkwells; propelling pencils; and repeating firearms. <span class="italic">The Times</span> (April 1844) described Bain as &#145;a most ingenious and meritorious inventor&#146;, and Schaffner wrote: &#145;He was not a commercial man but his inventive powers were most wonderful. He has given the world some invaluable inventions.&#146;<br>
<br>For a short period, from 1850 to 1852, Bain's electrochemical telegraph system was operated by several companies in the USA, but litigation against Bain and others by Morse led to their closure. Bain lost his earlier fortune in court actions, and by 1872 was reduced to repairing clocks for a living. In 1873, through the good offices of William Thomson (Lord Kelvin), for whom he had done some repairs, Bain received a memorial of &pound;80 per annum, and in the same year he was awarded a grant of &pound;150 by the Royal Society.<br>
<br>About 1876 Bain was admitted, on Thomson's recommendation, to the Broomhill Home for Incurables, Kirkintilloch, and there he died on 2 January 1877. He was buried in Old Aisle cemetery, Kirkintilloch, Scotland.<br>
