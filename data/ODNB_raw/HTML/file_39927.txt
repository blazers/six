<span class="headword">Clements, Sir  John Selby</span>  (1910&#150;1988), <span class="occ">actor and theatre manager</span>, was born on 25 April 1910 at 1 Carlton Terrace, Childs Hill, Hendon, Middlesex, the only child of Herbert William Clements, barrister, and his wife, Mary Elizabeth Stephens. He was educated at St Paul's School, and spent one term at St John's College, Cambridge. He was forced to withdraw from the college, where he had begun to study history, because sudden financial loss meant his family could no longer afford the fees. His mother's great friend Marie L&ouml;hr gave him his first job at the age of twenty at the Lyric Theatre, Hammersmith. In 1931 he joined the Shakespearian Company run by Sir Ben Greet, and at twenty-five, in 1935, was sufficiently confident to found the Intimate Theatre, Palmers Green, as a weekly repertory company which he managed, directed, and acted in until 1940. In the first year he produced forty-two plays there, playing thirty-six leading parts.<br>
<br>In 1936 Clements married his first wife, Inga Maria Lillemor Ahlgren. They had no children and the marriage was dissolved ten years later. In 1946 he married the actress Kay Hammond, whose real name was Dorothy Katherine, daughter of Sir Guy Standing KBE of the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve. Kay was formerly the wife of Sir Ronald George Leon, third baronet, and was the mother of Sir John Leon, fourth baronet, later better known as the actor John Standing. She and Clements had no children.<br>
<br>During the Second World War, Clements produced many plays for Entertainments National Service Association (ENSA) and also organized a revue company to entertain the troops at out-of-the-way places. John Clements and Kay Hammond together became one of the best-known theatrical couples of their day. In 1944 they acted at the Apollo in <span class="italic">Private Lives</span>, by No&euml;l Coward, an enchanting production with which Coward was delighted. In 1946 Clements appeared as the earl of Warwick in <span class="italic">The Kingmaker</span> at the St James's Theatre, which he himself managed. He presented and directed <span class="italic">Man and Superman</span> in 1951 at the New Theatre, playing the role of John Tanner.<br>
<br>In addition to his many productions and performances, Clements was a successful broadcaster on the radio, taking part with Kay Hammond in the weekly discussion programme <span class="italic">We Beg to Differ</span>. Their comic rivalry on the air delighted audiences. From 1955 Clements was adviser on drama for Associated Rediffusion, one of the first independent television companies, for which he was contracted to produce a number of television plays. In July 1955 he joined the board of directors of the Saville Theatre, the management of which came under his personal control.<br>
<br>In 1960 Kay Hammond became paralysed after a stroke and was confined to a wheelchair for the remaining twenty years of her life. Clements joined the Old Vic Company in 1961, making his first appearance in New York in the title role in <span class="italic">Macbeth</span> in 1962. In 1966 he took on the challenge of directing the Chichester festival theatre when Sir Laurence Olivier left to found the National Theatre. His boundless enthusiasm and love of the theatre overcame any initial reluctance on the part of the actors he approached for his first season at Chichester to join him &#145;in the wake of Larry&#146;. He was able to recruit Celia Johnson and Bill Fraser and splendid supporting casts, who were very loyal to him. His seasons were independent and enterprising, and he was always encouraging, calm, and resourceful in times of crisis.<br>
<br>As a director Clements was businesslike, almost prosaic, and very logical, never selfish and always courteous. Six feet tall, with a handsome face and slightly &#145;jug&#146; ears, he had kind eyes and excellent hands. He was one of the last actor&#150;managers in the country. In Chichester he was not only the director of four plays each summer season, but also played, among other parts, Macbeth, Antony, and Prospero, as well as two of Jean Anouilh's heroes, the general in <span class="italic">The Fighting Cock</span> and Antoine in <span class="italic">Dear Antoine</span>. It was his appreciation of the literary tradition of drama that gave him the courage to present <span class="italic">The Fighting Cock</span>, a great success in its original French version in Paris. <span class="italic">Heartbreak House</span>, in which he played Shotover, was one of his most memorable productions. Clements also acted in a number of films, including <span class="italic">Things to Come</span> (1936), <span class="italic">South Riding</span> (1937), <span class="italic">The Four Feathers</span> (1939), <span class="italic">Oh! What a Lovely War</span> (1969), and <span class="italic">Gandhi</span> (1982). He was appointed CBE in 1956 and knighted in 1968. A member of the council of Equity in 1948&#150;9 and vice-president in 1950&#150;59, he was also a popular trustee of the Garrick Club.<br>
<br>Clements left Chichester in 1973 to spend more time with his wife, for they were a devoted couple. She died in 1980. Clements died on 6 April 1988 at Pendean Convalescent Home near Midhurst, Sussex, where he had spent the last two years of his life.<br>
