<span class="headword">King,  Daniel</span>  (<em>c.</em>1616&#150;<em>c.</em>1661), <span class="occ">engraver</span>, the son of William King, a baker of Chester, was apprenticed to Randle Holme in September 1630 and admitted to the Painters' Company in Chester in August 1639. He made an annual payment to the company from 1639 to 1642, during which years he employed a number of journeymen. But thereafter he ceased to make payments and evidently left the city, although he remained a member of the company.<br>
<br>Nothing is known about King's movements during the civil war, and he next appears in London in the 1650s, when he was closely associated with the antiquary Sir William Dugdale in making etchings for the first volume of the latter's <span class="italic">Monasticon Anglicanum</span> in 1665. King's etchings reappeared the following year without any letterpress text and with extra plates under a new title-plate, <span class="italic">The Cathedrall and Conventuall Churches of England and Wales</span>. This publication bears King's name and has no mention of Dugdale. The 1666 series is known in different forms and with variant title-plates; the plates come in different states, some of which precede those found in some copies of the <span class="italic">Monasticon</span>&#151;so the two publications must have proceeded in parallel. King evidently kept control of the plates, for the bookseller George Thomason entered the work in the Stationers' register on 14 February 1657, listing fifty-seven plates and stating that they had been drawn &#145;at the great charge of Daniel King&#146;  (Eyre). In 1658 Dugdale prepared a long denunciation should King publish any part of his proposed translation of the <span class="italic">Monasticon</span>.<br>
<br>In 1656 King published in London <span class="italic">The Vale-Royall of England, or, The County Palatine of Chester Illustrated</span>, for which he wrote the preface. In it he printed for the first time two essays on Chester written by William Smith and William Webb more than forty years earlier, as well as an essay on the Isle of Man by James Chaloner. This book was illustrated with etchings mostly by Wenceslaus Hollar, which were unsigned and for this reason have often been attributed to King himself; the same is true of the one-sheet etching <span class="italic">An Orthographical Designe of Severall Viewes upon the Road in England and Wales</span> (<i>c</i>.1660), which, although published by King, is also by Hollar. This mistake has led to a gross overestimation of King's abilities as an etcher, which were decidedly modest. King also wrote a manuscript, &#145;Miniatura, or, The art of limning&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 12461), and translated Gerard Desargues's <span class="italic">Universal Way of Dyaling</span>, published in 1659.<br>
<br>King reappears in the books of the Chester company in 1659&#150;60, but is there recorded as dead in 1661. Anthony Wood recorded Dugdale's opinion that King was &#145;a most ignorant silly fellow&#146; who &#145;was not able to write one line of true English&#146;  (Wood, 3.503), and that after King had been robbed and deserted by his wife he had died heart-broken near York House in the Strand about 1664. His plates passed into the stock of John Overton.<br>
