<span class="headword">Cox,  George William</span>  (1827&#150;1902), <span class="occ">historian</span>, born at Benares, India, on 10 January 1827, was the eldest son of the six children of Captain George Hamilton Cox (<i>d</i>. 1841), of the East India Company's service, and Eliza Kearton, daughter of John Horne, planter, of St Vincent in the West Indies. A brother, Colonel Edmund Henry Cox of the Royal Marine Artillery, fired the first shot against Sevastopol in the Crimean War. Sent to England in 1836, Cox attended a preparatory school at Bath and Ilminster grammar school. In August 1842 he was admitted to Rugby under A. C. Tait. In 1843 Cox won the senior school scholarship at Rugby, and in 1845 he was elected scholar of Trinity College, Oxford. Although he obtained only a second class in the final classical school in 1848, his scholarship was commended by the examiners. He both graduated BA and proceeded MA in 1859.<br>
<br>The Oxford Movement gained Cox's sympathy, and in 1850 he was ordained by Samuel Wilberforce, bishop of Oxford. In that year he married Emily Maria, daughter of W. Stirling, a lieutenant-colonel in the East India Company's army. They had five sons and two daughters. After serving a curacy at Salcombe Regis, Cox resigned owing to ill health, and in 1851 accepted the post of English chaplain at Gibraltar. But Cox's high-church views, which coloured his <span class="italic">Life of Boniface</span> in 1853, met with the disapproval of his bishop, Dr Tomlinson, and he gladly embraced the opportunity of accompanying J. W. Colenso on his first visit to South Africa as bishop of Natal (1853&#150;4). On his return to England, Cox became curate of St Paul's, Exeter, in 1854 and for a year (1860&#150;61) he was a master at Cheltenham College.<br>
<br>Meanwhile Cox's religious views completely changed. An article in the <span class="italic">Edinburgh Review</span> (January 1858) on H. H. Milman's <span class="italic">History of Latin Christianity</span> illustrates the development of his views on broad-church lines. He ardently supported Bishop Colenso in his stand for liberal criticism of the scriptures and in his struggle over his episcopal status in South Africa. He defended Colenso in a long correspondence with F. D. Maurice and warmly supported the bishop during his visit to England (1863&#150;5). Cox's association with Colenso and the active support of Mrs Colenso who supplied him with many letters and papers after the bishop's death, gave him abundant material for his life of the bishop, which he published in 1888. In the same year he issued a last vindication of Colenso, in <span class="italic">The Church of England and the Teaching of Bishop Colenso</span>, maintaining Colenso's loyalty to the church.<br>
<br>Throughout his life Cox was largely occupied by literary or historical work of varied kinds. His earliest volume, <span class="italic">Poems Legendary and Historical</span> (1850), was written in collaboration with his friend E. A. Freeman. From 1861 to 1885 he was literary adviser to Messrs Longmans &amp; Co., and for many years he was engaged in writing historical works which were widely read and much admired at the time but were not of permanent scholarly significance. These included <span class="italic">The Great Persian War</span> (1861), <span class="italic">Latin and Teutonic Christendom</span> (1870), <span class="italic">The Greeks and the Persians</span> (1876), <span class="italic">History of the Establishment of British Rule in India</span> (1881), <span class="italic">Lives of Greek Statesmen</span> (2 vols., 1886), and <span class="italic">A Concise History of England</span> (1887). His most elaborate work was a well-written <span class="italic">History of Greece</span> (2 vols., 1874), largely a derivative from George Grote's work. He published also on mythology, where he followed Max M&uuml;ller with some independence. His <span class="italic">Tales from Greek Mythology</span> (1861), <span class="italic">A Manual of Mythology</span> (1867), <span class="italic">The Mythology of the Aryan Nations</span> (1870; new edn, 1882), and <span class="italic">An Introduction to the Science of Comparative Mythology</span> (1881) all enjoyed a wide vogue, although they pressed to extravagant limits the solar and nebular theory of the origin of myths. He was a frequent contributor to the leading reviews, and joint editor with William Thomas Brande of the <span class="italic">Dictionary of Science, Literature, and Art</span> (3 vols., 1865&#150;7; new edn, 1875).<br>
<br>In 1877 Cox claimed to succeed to the baronetcy of Cox of Dunmanway, which had been granted to Sir Richard Cox (1650&#150;1733) in 1706. He believed himself to be the heir male of William, the eighth son of the first baronet. On the death in 1873 of a distant cousin, Sir Francis Hawtrey Cox, the twelfth baronet, the title had been treated by the Ulster office of arms as extinct. Nevertheless it was then assumed by Cox's uncle, Colonel Edmund Cox, on whose death in 1877 Cox adopted the titular prefix. His right to the dignity was doubtful because he was unable to produce any documentary evidence to prove that his ancestor, William Cox, was actually a son of the first baronet and not merely a young man for whose apprenticeship the baronet had paid the fee. The title was also assumed by Major-General John Cox who claimed descent from John Cox of Brandon, younger brother of the second baronet. George Cox's right to the dignity was disallowed after his death. On 9 November 1911 the baronetage committee of the privy council advised George V that the name of Edmund Charles Cox, his eldest surviving son and at that time district superintendent of police at Poona, should not be entered on the official roll of baronets.<br>
<br>In 1880 Cox was appointed vicar of Bekesbourne by A. C. Tait, archbishop of Canterbury, and from 1881 to 1897 he was rector of the crown living of Scrayingham, Yorkshire. After the death of Bishop Colenso in 1882, the church council of Natal, having failed in a petition to the crown to appoint a new bishop by letters patent and also in an attempt to persuade the English archbishops and four other bishops to choose one for them, proceeded in August 1886 to elect Cox as Colenso's successor. Archbishop Benson, however, refused to apply for a royal licence to consecrate Cox on the ground that Natal had been from the beginning a part of the province of South Africa and that that province would not recognize the election. In the following year an attempt to persuade the crown to compel the archbishop also failed.<br>
<br>On 18 May 1896 Cox received a civil-list pension of &pound;120. He died at Ivy House, Walmer, Kent, on 9 February 1902. His ashes were buried after cremation at Long Cross, Chertsey, Surrey.<br>
