<span class="headword">Ritchie <span class="st"> [<em>married name </em>Mortimer]</span>,  Elizabeth</span>  (1754&#150;1835), <span class="occ">biographer</span>, was born at Otley, Yorkshire, on 2 February 1754, the second child of John Ritchie (<i>d</i>. 1780) and his wife, Beatrice Robinson. Her father, a native of Edinburgh, was for many years a naval surgeon. Having retired from the sea he settled in Wharfedale, Yorkshire, where he married Beatrice and continued to practise. The family was Wesleyan Methodist and John Wesley often stayed at their home in Otley. Her childhood was happy, but her upbringing strict and, feeling restricted at home, Elizabeth was delighted at the age of twelve to stay with a Mrs H. who, while providing her with educational opportunities, also introduced her to more worldly pleasures. She attended the Church of England and came to despise the Methodists, but when Mrs H. moved to London, Elizabeth returned home and met Wesley again. She refused to hear him preach and went to the parish church, where the sermon of the evangelical curate greatly affected her. From 3 July 1771 Elizabeth began to keep a very personal diary. In June 1772 she renewed her acquaintance with Wesley at Otley and returned to Wesleyan Methodism, where she joined a class and was made a class leader (1774). Until 1780 her visiting and teaching was restricted to Otley because of her own ill health (probably tuberculosis) and that of her parents, her father dying on 18 April 1780. She later began to go further afield, sharing in John Wesley's journeys and undertaking some herself. While she did not actually preach Elizabeth instructed new converts and ministered to the sick.<br>
<br>Elizabeth corresponded with many leading Methodists and especially, from 1772, with John Wesley. In November 1790 she took up residence at the New Chapel house, City Road, London, acting as housekeeper in place of Hester Ann Rogers, where she became Wesley's nurse during his last illness and often read to him. Elizabeth was at his bedside when he died on 2 March 1791 and at the request of his physician, John Whitehead, wrote a detailed account of his last days. Whitehead read part of this at Wesley's funeral and it was later published. She was very depressed after Wesley's death, but with the help of friends, especially Mary Fletcher (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Bosanquet), she restarted her evangelical and philanthropic activities.<br>
<br>In London, Elizabeth resumed her role as class-leader at the Foundery and continued with her letter writing, but her itinerant journeys and diary ceased. In 1786 she had rejected a proposal of marriage from Harvey Walklate Mortimer (1753&#150;1819) and he married someone else. However, in 1801, when he was a widower, they married and Elizabeth took on the raising of her six stepchildren. After her husband's death in 1819 Elizabeth continued with her class and public speaking until a doctor advised against it. She died in London on 9 April 1835 and was buried at the New Chapel, City Road.<br>
