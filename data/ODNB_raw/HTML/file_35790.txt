<span class="headword">Robinson,  (Esm&eacute; Stuart) Lennox</span>  (1886&#150;1958), <span class="occ">playwright and theatre director</span>, was born on 4 October 1886 in Castletreasure, near Douglas, co. Cork, the youngest of the seven children of Andrew Craig Robinson (<i>c</i>.1842&#150;1921) and Emily Anna, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Jones (1850&#150;1932). When Lennox was six his father, a stockbroker, took orders in the Church of Ireland and in 1895 moved his family first to Kinsale and thence in 1902 to the rectory in Ballymoney in west Cork. Owing to ill health Lennox had little formal education, being tutored at home except for a few years spent at Bandon grammar school up to 1904. At home he read widely and dabbled in music, taking correspondence courses in harmony and composition. In 1906 he obtained a teaching post at a preparatory school in Wellington, Shropshire, from which he was dismissed for incompetence after one term. On his return to Ballymoney he edited a family magazine, <span class="italic">Contributions</span>, with a cousin and here Robinson gained his first experience as writer. He also tried his hand at exotic dramas based on late nineteenth-century favourites seen in Cork. Then on a visit to the Cork Opera House in August 1907 Robinson was suddenly and lastingly affected, like so many aspiring dramatists of his generation, by the plays and acting style of the fledgeling Abbey Theatre company, then on tour. The programme comprised Yeats's nationalistic <span class="italic">Cathleen ni Houlihan</span> and poetic <span class="italic">The Hour Glass</span>, together with Lady Gregory's new play <span class="italic">The Rising of the Moon</span>. &#145;It came on me in a flash, as a revelation, that play-material could be found outside one's own door, at one's own fireside&#146;  (Robinson, 18). Robinson was inspired to write a play in the Abbey mode, <span class="italic">The Clancy Name</span>. He was to go on to write twenty-two plays for the Abbey Theatre.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">The Clancy Name</span>, a one-act play first staged at the Abbey on 8 October 1908, subsequently revised and published, was a peasant play in a harsher style of realism than Synge had introduced to the Abbey. In order to preserve the family name Mrs Clancy suppresses her son's dying confession to a murder. Here and in the plays which followed over the next eight years Robinson displayed the influence of Henrik Ibsen, then regarded as the major exponent of modern tragic drama. These were bleak, pessimistic expositions of rural life, linking Robinson to T. C. Murray and R. J. Ray as one of the so-called Cork realists. Successful at the time, these early plays are nowadays little regarded. Although no admirer of Ibsen, Yeats saw merit in Robinson's work and offered him the post of manager in the Abbey Theatre. Ignorant though he was at this time of theatrical production, Robinson accepted the position. Yeats was to be the dominating influence in his life and he made Robinson his disciple.<br>
<br>Having spent, through Yeats's arrangement, a brief time early in 1910 as private secretary to Shaw in London in order to learn the theatrical trade and attend rehearsals at the Duke of York's Theatre, Robinson was launched as manager and producer&#150;director at the Abbey Theatre. He was immediately embroiled in controversy when, owing to a misunderstanding on his part, he kept the theatre open at the time of King Edward VII's death on 7 May 1910. The Abbey's patron, Annie Horniman, construing this act as a political insult, withdrew her subsidy of the theatre when Yeats backed Robinson and no public apology was made. As a consequence of this loss of income the Abbey company was obliged to make a series of annual tours to the United States, managed by Robinson, between 1911 and 1914. However, Lady Gregory, who never fully approved of Robinson, blamed him when the final tour lost money and Robinson resigned as manager.<br>
<br>At something of a loss where to turn next, Robinson joined the newly founded Irish Volunteers in Cork, but left following the split and later tried to join the Munster fusiliers after the outbreak of the First World War, in which his brother Arthur was killed. But Robinson was rejected by the army for poor eyesight, although his frail constitution (Robinson was over 6 feet tall but weighed only 8 stone) would hardly have fitted him for combat duty. For a time he had a job as clerk in Dublin Castle and lived in the home of Mrs Hester Travers-Smith, daughter of Edward Dowden, where there were books, music, and s&eacute;ances to compensate for the drudgery of work. In 1915 he took a position as organizing librarian for the Carnegie (UK) Trust, then establishing a network of public libraries throughout Ireland. He remained with the trust until his dismissal in 1924 amid controversy over a short story he published in the short-lived magazine <span class="italic">Tomorrow</span> edited by Francis Stuart. In the meantime he continued to write plays, and won much success with <span class="italic">The Whiteheaded Boy</span> (1916) and <span class="italic">The Lost Leader</span> (1918). The latter was in some measure a political play, in which Robinson imagines what Parnell might think of the Ireland that had emerged by 1918 if he were still alive incognito. The former, Robinson's first comedy, displayed his talent for plot construction and his skill in delineating scheming small-town characters obsessed with status and respectability, observed with geniality and mild satire. Later staged in London and in New York <span class="italic">The Whiteheaded Boy</span> became Robinson's most enduring play, being frequently revived on the Abbey stage.<br>
<br>In 1917 Robinson published his only novel, <span class="italic">A Young Man from the South</span>, which is autobiographical and emphasizes the strong nationalist feelings also evident in some short pieces entitled <span class="italic">Dark Days</span> (1918). He also published <span class="italic">Eight Short Stories</span> (1918). But his genius lay mainly in the theatre. His interest in contemporary European drama led Robinson in 1918 to help found the Dublin Drama League, which performed modern experimental plays at the Abbey on Sunday and Monday evenings. He himself both played in and directed some of these productions which created a new audience in Dublin and paved the way for the Edwards-Mac Liamm&oacute;ir Gate Theatre (founded 1928). He returned to the Abbey in April 1919 as manager and producer&#150;director and in 1923 was made a member of the board of directors, filling the place left vacant since the death of Synge in 1909. Robinson is usually credited with reviving the Abbey at this time, which was weakened by the loss of many actors and by the violent political events of the day which led to early curfews in Dublin. Lady Gregory did not believe that Robinson was a good administrator, yet he worked hard to bring the Abbey out of the doldrums until it received a government subsidy in 1925. He proved a skilled and influential director of Abbey plays, encouraging the new talents of George Shiels and Sean O'Casey in the 1920s, Teresa Deevy and Paul Vincent Carroll in the 1930s, as well as many others. He also established a school of acting in 1926 and for many years taught in it himself.<br>
<br>At the same time Robinson as dramatist strove in the 1920s to move beyond the conventional Abbey &#145;peasant&#146; play by writing about the post-war generation in Ireland. These interesting experiments, such as <span class="italic">The Round Table</span> (1922) and <span class="italic">The White Blackbird</span> (1925), were not among Robinson's more successful plays, for there was always something unfinished about each of them, as if he could not quite find sufficient courage to express his theme. Indeed, he lacked a point of view or coherent philosophy of life as a dramatist  (O'Neill, 170). On the other hand, <span class="italic">The Big House</span> (1926) hit upon the important theme of the Anglo-Irish caught up in the wars which ravaged Robinson's native co. Cork from 1918 to 1923 and about which he, his brother, and sister were later to write so graphically in the pages of <span class="italic">Three Homes</span> (1938). For the first time the plight of the long-time colonialists, the protestant minority surrounded by the Catholic majority intent on liberating Ireland, received sympathetic treatment. Robinson returned to this theme in the elegiac <span class="italic">Killycreggs in Twilight</span> (1937). Unfortunately, neither of these plays was as popular as the lighter comedies, both one-act and full-length, which Robinson seemed effortlessly to write for the Abbey.<br>
<br>In autumn 1928 Robinson went to the United States on a lecture tour which was not a financial success. On 8 September 1931 he married Dorothy Travers-Smith (1901/2&#150;1977), an artist and scene designer at the Abbey and granddaughter of the famous Edward Dowden, professor of English at Trinity College, Dublin. There were no children of this marriage, and as time passed Robinson sank into alcoholism and depression. Yet his work rate remained impressive, not only in writing plays but in organizing the Abbey Theatre Festival in 1938, editing a collection of the lectures given during it, <span class="italic">The Irish Theatre</span> (1939), and editing Lady Gregory's <span class="italic">Journals</span> (1946). He occasionally wrote for the Gate Theatre, notably <span class="italic">Roly Poly</span> (1940), a modernized adaptation of de Maupassant's &#145;Boule de suif&#146;, ordered to be closed after one performance by the department of justice following objections by the German and French legations in Dublin. Robinson, a very cultured man, also edited anthologies of Irish poetry and wrote biographies of an Irish artist Dermod O'Brien, <span class="italic">Palette and Plough</span> (1948), and the Anglo-Irish agriculturist and politician Bryan Cooper (1931). He was virtually identified with the old Abbey, however, and his <span class="italic">Pictures in a Theatre</span> (1947), a dialogue woven around the Abbey portraits, drolly represents him as a kind of custodian. In recognition of his diverse achievements Trinity College awarded him an honorary DLitt on 9 December 1948. In the same year he helped found the Actors' Church Union, served as vice-president and president, and took an active interest in the relief of indigent actors. In 1951 Robinson published the official history of the Abbey Theatre, just as fire destroyed the original building and the company moved to the Queen's Theatre. He resigned his directorship in 1956.<br>
<br>Robinson was probably the most complete man of the theatre the Abbey has nurtured in its hundred-year history. As playwright his place in that history is in the second rather than the first rank, and only <span class="italic">The Whiteheaded Boy</span> is revived nowadays. His best work, whether as director or playwright, was done before the end of the 1930s. It is likely that his personality was always too dominated by Yeats, whom he revered, for him to develop his full potential, yet he achieved much in his varied career and to the last was involved in furthering developments in drama in Ireland. He was appointed honorary patron of the All-Ireland Amateur Drama Council in 1953 when the first national amateur drama festival was held at Athlone, and acted as dedicated adjudicator thereafter. In 1956 he was invited by the Chinese government to give a centenary lecture on Shaw.<br>
<br>Lennox Robinson died in Glensilva Nursing Home, Monkstown Road, co. Dublin, on 14 October 1958 of complications arising from heart failure, and was buried in St Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin, on 17 October. To the last, the Abbey Theatre was in his thoughts, for in his will Robinson left the copyrights of his work to the directors as a trust fund to assist playwrights, players, directors, stage designers, and stage musicians.<br>
