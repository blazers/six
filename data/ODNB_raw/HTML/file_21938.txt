<span class="headword">Percy,  Henry</span>, eighth earl of Northumberland  (<em>c.</em>1532&#150;1585), <span class="occ">magnate and conspirator</span>, was born at Newburn Manor, Northumberland, the younger son of Sir Thomas Percy (<i>d</i>. 1537), landowner and rebel, of Prudhoe, Northumberland, and his wife, Eleanor (<i>d</i>. 1567), daughter and coheir of Sir Guischard Harbottle of Beamish, co. Durham; he was aged about five in 1537. He was the younger brother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21956/', "Thomas Percy, seventh earl of Northumberland (1528&#150;1572)")</script>, magnate and rebel. Their father was executed at Tyburn on 2 June 1537 for his role in the Pilgrimage of Grace. After this, they were removed from their mother's custody and placed under the care of Sir Thomas Tempest of Holmside, co. Durham.<br>
<br>Thomas and Henry Percy were restored in blood on 14 March 1549. Henry Percy was returned as MP for Morpeth, Northumberland, in 1554 and knighted on 30 April 1557. Thomas was restored to the earldom of Northumberland on 1 May 1557, with the tail male in remainder to Henry, who became deputy warden of the east and middle marches. Henry Percy purchased the captaincy of Norham Castle at the end of 1557. All this was intended to recover family power through acquisition of traditional Percy offices. Elizabeth I initially favoured him. He was appointed to the queen's council in the north in December 1558 and named of the quorum for co. Durham and for Northumberland in 1559. Percy was a commissioner to treat with the lords of the congregation and encouraged rebellion in Scotland, goading James Hamilton, duke of Ch&acirc;telherault, in February 1559 to take action. The French ambassador in Scotland, Henri Cleutin, seigneur d'Oysel, complained about Percy's interference on 30 July. Percy participated in the Scottish campaign in 1560, commanding a band of horse pistoleers and distinguishing himself, and was appointed governor of Tynemouth Castle, Northumberland, in December as a reward.<br>
<br>Percy was appointed a commissioner to treat with the French on 25 May 1560. He reported on the newly adopted doctrines of the Scottish church and corresponded with John Knox, who was convinced of his protestantism. Ch&acirc;telherault believed Percy was protestant in 1559, as did Francis Russell, second earl of Bedford, in 1565, but Sir Ralph Sadler was unconvinced. Percy was commissioned on 5 May 1561, along with Thomas Young, archbishop of York, to administer the oath of supremacy to the clergy of the northern province. By 25 January 1562 he married his cousin Katherine (1545/6&#150;1596), first daughter and coheir of John Neville, fourth Baron Latimer, and his wife, Lucy. The couple had eight sons, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21939/', "Henry Percy, ninth earl of Northumberland (1564&#150;1632)")</script>, Thomas (<i>d</i>. 1587), <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21962/', "William Percy (1574&#150;1648)")</script>, Sir Charles Percy (<i>d</i>. 1628), Sir Richard Percy (<i>d</i>. 1648), Sir Alan Percy (<i>d</i>. 1611), Sir Josceline Percy (<i>d</i>. 1631), and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21926/', "George Percy (1580&#150;1632/3)")</script>, and two daughters, Lucy and Eleanor (<i>d</i>. 1650). Percy ensured that his children were very well educated. Katherine Neville's younger sister, Dorothy, married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4981/', "Thomas Cecil (1542&#150;1623)")</script> on 27 November 1564. Percy was sheriff of Northumberland from 1562 to 1563. He was appointed a commissioner to suppress piracy on 8 November 1565 and to enforce the <span class="roman">Acts of Uniformity and Supremacy</span> in the archdiocese of York in 1568. The following year he was named of the quorum for Cumberland and for the North and East ridings of Yorkshire.<br>
<br>During the northern uprising of 1569&#150;70, while Northumberland played a leading role in supporting Mary, queen of Scots, Percy remained loyal to Elizabeth. He joined the royal forces and held Tynemouth for the queen, who wrote to him in gratitude on 17 November. Although his motivations are unknown, Percy was proud and quarrelsome, yet displayed &#145;a cautious &#147;loyalist&#148;&#146; attitude during the rebellion  (James, 295). It is possible that the brothers took opposing sides in order to preserve the family estates. When Northumberland escaped to Scotland and was imprisoned there, Percy wrote urging him to confess and appeal to Elizabeth's mercy. Percy was rewarded with the stewardship of the crown property at Tynemouth in 1570. He was returned as MP for Northumberland in 1571, probably to ensure his inheritance. The act for confirmation of attainders of May 1571 contained a clause guaranteeing Percy's rights. He technically succeeded to the earldom when his brother was executed on 22 August 1572.<br>
<br>Despite his previous loyalty, Percy opened communication with John Leslie, bishop of Ross, at Easter 1571. Again, his motivation for offering to assist Mary to escape as part of the Ridolfi plot is unclear. It is possible that Roberto di Ridolfi's agents contacted Percy, as acting head of the family. Despite Percy's professing Catholicism, Thomas Howard, fourth duke of Norfolk, did not trust him. Percy was found out and while in the capital was arrested and lodged in the Tower of London on 15 November. He begged Elizabeth for mercy on 23 February 1572, which was granted, but was tried privately in November, having accepted a secret punishment rather than open trial. The queen was angry with him for his ingratitude and dissimulation, while William Cecil, Baron Burghley, was regarded as too partial towards him because of marital ties. In November she renewed her order to Robert Dudley, earl of Leicester, that Percy be kept in close confinement, his fault being &#145;as great as any Man's, though it be no hie Treason&#146;  (W. Murdin, ed., <span class="italic">A Collection of State Papers Relating to Affairs in the Reign of Queen Elizabeth, from &hellip; 1571 to 1596</span>, 1759, 229). Percy was fined &pound;3333 6<i>s</i>. 8<i>d</i>., which he never paid, and told to stay at his house at Petworth, Sussex. He had been removed from the queen's council of the north in April 1571, and Francis Hastings, second earl of Huntingdon, did not want him restored. Huntingdon wrote to Leicester on 20 January 1573, requesting successfully that the eighth earl of Northumberland remain under house arrest at Petworth. Northumberland was permitted to go to London on 12 July 1573 and set at liberty shortly afterwards.<br>
<br>Northumberland was unpopular with his tenants, who accused him of being a cruel landlord. He attempted to improve his estates, building a forge and a double furnace in Petworth Great Park, which was probably what upset his tenants. However, Northumberland preferred the court to the country. Writing in the early seventeenth century, William Camden described him as &#145;a man of lively and active Spirit and Courage&#146;  (Camden, 193). Northumberland's exile from court was lifted, and he first took his seat in the House of Lords on 8 February 1576. He began rebuilding Petworth from 1576, and it was his principal residence during the last years of his life. In 1577 he was nominated to be a commissioner to promote the breeding of warhorses in Sussex. After his father-in-law died on 22 April 1577 the countess of Northumberland inherited a quarter of the Latimer estate, including Burton Latimer, Northamptonshire.<br>
<br>Northumberland continued to dabble in treasonous plots surrounding Mary. He had several of his sons educated in Paris by Charles Paget. Paget was an accomplice of the conspirator Francis Throckmorton, and visited Northumberland at Petworth in September 1583, perhaps hoping to make it the base for his invasion of England but more probably trying to apprise his associates of the current situation, advising them not to support any plots. Certainly Northumberland was sympathetic to Mary, enjoyed intrigue, and had a weakness for indiscreet comments. The government was convinced that he was seriously involved, and in December he was placed under house arrest for assisting Thomas Paget, third Baron Paget, and Charles Arundell to escape to France and for speaking with Charles Paget. He was removed from his governorship and his stewardship. Northumberland was sent to the Tower on 9 January 1584 for denying matters confirmed by witnesses. Sir Francis Walsingham was convinced that he was a Catholic.<br>
<br>In June 1585 the government considered bringing charges of treason against Northumberland but did not pursue it, although the reason why is unknown. He was found in bed in the Tower on the night of 20&#150;21 June, dead from a shot through the heart inflicted with his own pistol, which was still in his hand. The Star Chamber inquest held on 23 June determined that his death was suicide. He was buried on the same day in the chapel of St Peter ad Vincula in the Tower. Some Catholics, however, were convinced that Sir Christopher Hatton, the vice-chamberlain, had the earl murdered on the government's orders. A Latin pamphlet published at Cologne made this claim; it was soon translated into German, Italian, Spanish, and English. If Northumberland had been shot three times in the chest, as some affirmed, this would indeed seem to rule out suicide, but if not, suicide does seem much more probable; it protected his family from confiscations. The popular belief in Hatton's guilt, however, was strong. In a letter of 1601 to Sir Robert Cecil, Sir Walter Ralegh casually referred to Hatton as Northumberland's murderer. The declaration by the crown after Northumberland's death stated that he conveyed Charles Paget and Arundell out of the country after Throckmorton's arrest, because they were the only real witnesses against him. The dowager countess of Northumberland remarried shortly after 5 December 1587, her second husband being Francis Fitton of Binfield in Berkshire, a kinsman of Northumberland who had long been her steward. She died on 28 October 1596 and was buried in Westminster Abbey.<br>
