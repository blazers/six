<span class="headword">Spencer,  George Trevor</span>  (1799&#150;1866), <span class="occ">bishop of Madras, India</span>, was born on 11 December 1799 at Curzon Street, Mayfair, Westminster, the third son of the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26140/', "Hon. William Robert Spencer (1770&#150;1834)")</script> and his wife, Susan, widow of Count Spreti and daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/14717/', "Francis Jenison (known as Jenison Walworth)")</script>. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26114/', "Aubrey George Spencer (1795&#150;1872)")</script>, bishop of Newfoundland, was his brother. Having gained prizes for Latin alcaics and an English essay at Charterhouse School, he went to University College, Oxford, where he graduated BA in 1822.<br>
<br>In the following year he was ordained deacon, and also married Harriet Theodora, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13402/', "Sir Benjamin Hobhouse")</script>; they had two sons and three daughters. In 1824 he was ordained priest and held the perpetual curacy of Buxton until 1829. From 1829 until 1837 he was rector of Leaden Roding in Essex.<br>
<br>On 19 November 1837, through the influence of his brother-in-law Sir John Cam Hobhouse, president of the Board of Control, Spencer was consecrated second bishop of Madras, and enthroned in St George's Cathedral, Madras, on 4 November 1838. In 1842 he published a <span class="italic">Journal of a visitation to the provinces of Travancore and Tinnevelly in the diocese of Madras, 1840&#150;41</span>. In 1845 he also published <span class="italic">Journal of a visitation tour, in 1843&#150;4, through part of the western portion of his diocese</span>. Besides places in his own diocese, he visited during this tour Poona, Ahmednagar, and Bombay. In the autumn of 1845 Spencer visited the missions of the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel and the Church Missionary Society, and published his <span class="italic">Journal</span> in the following year, together with charges delivered at St George's Cathedral, Madras, and at Palamcottai, and appendices containing statistical tables. In 1846 he also published <span class="italic">A brief account of the C.M.S.'s mission in the district of Kishnagur, in the diocese of Calcutta</span>. In the diocese of Madras he established three training colleges for Indian converts.<br>
<br>The whole of Spencer's episcopate was fraught with tensions between himself and the Madras diocesan committee of the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts. Relations were equally strained with the Church Missionary Society and its forceful chief secretary, Henry Venn. Spencer's stress upon the authority of the bishop rather than the missionary societies, especially in theological matters, was bound to cause problems in a diocese where many of the missionaries were either German or Danish Lutherans or were influenced by Tractarian beliefs. Dogged by ill health, by 1847 Spencer could no longer cope and returned to England on leave. On 16 June 1847 he was made doctor of divinity, and at some time during the course of his stay in England he decided to resign the episcopate, though this was not carried into effect until 1849.<br>
<br>On 4 October 1852 Spencer was appointed commissary or assistant to Richard Bagot, bishop of Bath and Wells. Once again he entered an area of theological controversy, this time with the Ven. George Denison, archdeacon of Taunton, examining chaplain to Bagot. They differed strongly over their understanding of the &#145;real presence&#146; in the eucharist, Denison taking an extreme Tractarian position, and over the extent of Spencer's powers to test whether the beliefs of those presented to him for ordination were in accordance with those sanctioned by the Church of England. The controversy was brief but acrimonious and led to an angry correspondence which ended in Denison's declining &#145;any further communication by word or writing&#146;, and both men's publishing their correspondence in an attempt to vindicate themselves. The result was the resignation of both men, Spencer on 10 May and Denison on 4 June 1853.<br>
<br>In 1860 Spencer was appointed chancellor of St Paul's Cathedral in London, and in the next year became rector of Walton on the Wolds, Leicestershire. He died of dropsy on 16 July 1866 at his home, Edge Moor, Hartington Upper Quarter, near Buxton, Derbyshire, his wife surviving him.<br>
