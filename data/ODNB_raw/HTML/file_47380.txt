<span class="headword">Smith,  Francis Samuel <span class="st"> [Frank]</span></span>  (1854&#150;1940), <span class="occ">politician and Salvationist</span>, was born in Chelsea, London, the son of Alfred John Smith. He was educated at Oxford House School, Chelsea, and apprenticed as an upholsterer in 1870. Four years later, on 28 September 1874, he married Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1935), daughter of George Hall, a smith.<br>
<br>Smith first became involved with the social and religious activism which was to dominate his life when he joined the Chelsea Mission, and through that the Salvation Army, in the late 1870s. He soon gave up his successful furnishings business in Sloane Street, London, to enter full-time into the Salvationist cause. As a propagandist and organizer for the army, Smith demonstrated the skills which he was later to use effectively in his political work, and developed a reputation for his calm, yet uncompromising, determination for a cause. He rose quickly in the movement, and was appointed to the rank of commissioner by General William Booth in advance of a mission to the United States during 1884. After returning from this trip, during which he had been influenced by the writings of the American radical Henry George, Smith increasingly moved the focus of his concerns towards the need for social reform.<br>
<br>Smith came into close contact with a number of radical and socialist political leaders through his involvement with the Free Speech Committee associated with the 1887 Trafalgar Square and Hyde Park demonstrations. His social activism and religious commitment seemed for a time to be merged perfectly in his role as head of the Salvation Army's social reform wing, to which he had been appointed by Booth in May 1890, and he increased the army's involvement in food relief, shelters, and employment schemes. Smith, with W. T. Stead, has been credited with being central to the development of the social reform proposals published by Booth in <span class="italic">Darkest England and the Way Out</span> (1890). Yet Smith came increasingly to be at odds with Booth over the relative importance of social and spiritual work, as well as the extent of autonomy which Smith wanted for the social reform wing of the army. Smith resigned from the Salvation Army over these issues in late 1890.<br>
<br>Smith had written a number of articles on an egalitarian theme for the <span class="italic">War Cry</span> before his resignation, and he turned to journalism as the means of spreading his now more fully formed political views. In early 1891 Smith joined the Fabian Society and also started the <span class="italic">Workers' Cry</span>, as an organ for the Labor Army, advocating collectivism and other radical means of alleviating poverty, but this ceased publication in early 1892. Through the press proprietor and MP, William Saunders, Smith gained work as the parliamentary reporter for the <span class="italic">Eastern Morning News</span>, and was later editor of the <span class="italic">Weekly Dispatch</span>.<br>
<br>In 1892 Smith sought election as an independent, but under the auspices of the Liberal and Labour associations, for both a London county council (LCC) seat in North Lambeth, which he won, and the parliamentary seat of Hammersmith, which he lost narrowly, standing on a platform largely of taxation reform and the abolition of the existing poor-law system. At this time Smith was developing a close association with <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/33696/', "James Keir Hardie")</script>, who assisted him in the Hammersmith contest. Smith and Hardie shared a very strong spiritual and idealist basis to their politics, and a continuing interest in mysticism and similar beliefs. Smith, whom Hardie called &#145;St Francis&#146;  (<span class="italic">DLB</span>, 9.272), has often been seen as having encouraged Hardie's moves towards utopianism and political isolation. Hardie lived in Smith's house in Chelsea after his own election to parliament in 1892, and Smith continued to act as a part-time secretary and election agent for Hardie until the latter's death in 1915.<br>
<br>Hardie encouraged Smith to stand in 1894 as the Independent Labour Party (ILP) candidate in a parliamentary by-election in Sheffield. The seat was won easily by the Liberals, but this was the first of a long line of electoral campaigns for Smith as a Labour candidate in which he stood for propaganda effect, rather than with a real chance of victory. He stood for the House of Commons a further eight times before winning a seat, Nuneaton, in 1929, which he held only until 1931.<br>
<br>In 1901 Smith rejoined the Salvation Army after becoming disillusioned with aspects of political life, and he resigned his LCC seat. Yet by 1905 Smith had returned to political activism, as secretary of a Right to Work Council formed by Hardie and other ILP and Social Democratic Federation members, to pressure the Conservative government on unemployment. Smith also stood again successfully for the LCC in 1907, and attempted, less successfully, to form the &#145;Labour men&#146; on the council into a distinct body, separate from the Progressive grouping. After the 1910 election, Smith, George Lansbury, and R. C. K. Ensor did form, at least temporarily, their own LCC Labour Party.<br>
<br>During the First World War, Smith concentrated on the land issue, particularly focusing on the development of the allotment movement. He was appointed parliamentary private secretary to Lansbury, the new commissioner of works, in October 1930, and continued his interest in the plight of the unemployed. Apart from his many journalistic contributions, Smith also wrote a work on the removal of General Bramwell Booth by the Salvation Army's high council in 1929, and published a brief biography of Hardie in 1915.<br>
<br>Although Smith was an important and respected socialist activist of the period, the intensity of his idealism, and the extent to which his religious and mystical beliefs continued to dominate his political approach, made him a somewhat unusual and distant figure within the socialist movement. He undoubtedly found his closest kindred spirit in Keir Hardie. Smith died on 26 December 1940 at his home at 67 Longley Road, Tooting, London.<br>
