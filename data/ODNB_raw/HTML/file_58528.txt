<span class="headword">Parr,  William</span>, Baron Parr of Horton  (<em>c.</em>1480&#150;1547), <span class="occ">soldier and courtier</span>, was the second of four children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21404/', "Sir William Parr")</script> of Kendal (1434&#150;1483) and his second wife, Elizabeth (1462&#150;<i>c</i>.1505), daughter of Henry, Lord Fitzhugh of Ravensworth, and his wife, Alice Neville. Although his family's lands lay in Westmorland, Parr was raised in the Northamptonshire household of his stepfather, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28162/', "Sir Nicholas Vaux")</script> of Harrowden. In 1505 he married Mary (1484&#150;1555), daughter of William Salisbury and his wife, Elizabeth, daughter of Thomas Wylde of Bromham, Bedfordshire, who brought him Horton manor in Northamptonshire. The couple had four daughters: Matilda, or Maud (married Ralph Lane) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/70800/', "Lane, Maud")</script>]; Anne (married Sir Thomas Tresham); Mary (married first John Digby and then Henry Brooke); Elizabeth (married Nicholas Woodhull).<br>
<br>Parr succeeded to much of his stepfather's influence in Northamptonshire, serving on numerous commissions, as knight of the shire in parliament from 1529 to 1540, and as sheriff (1517, 1522, 1533, and 1537). An avid hunter, between 1505 and 1523 he secured royal grants for the keeping of the great and little parks at Brigstock, the park at King's Cliffe, and the forest and castle of Rockingham, as well as the stewardship of all royal lands in Pembrokeshire. In 1537 he was granted one-quarter of the manor of Kendal in Westmorland, part of a parcel of lands he received from the late duke of Richmond's northern holdings.<br>
<br>Parr began his court career in Henry VII's household as one of the king's spears and as squire for the body (by 1506), an office he retained under Henry VIII until March 1512. He fought in the vanguard of the English army during Henry VIII's expedition to France in the summer of 1513, and on 25 September was knighted in the cathedral at Tournai. An excellent soldier, between April and June 1523 he fought in several skirmishes along the Scottish border under the earl of Surrey, who mentioned Parr's courage in battle in several letters to the king. During the 1536 Pilgrimage of Grace, Parr, swearing he would &#145;put the offenders in despair and dread&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 1/107/115), led a company of men into Lincolnshire to pacify the rebels, helping to secure and hold Stamford.<br>
<br>A bluff, proud, quarrelsome man, Parr was happier on the battlefield than at court, but quickly realized that there was more profit in court politics than in storming castles. In 1515 he was briefly appointed chamberlain to the household of Margaret Tudor, dowager queen of Scots. In 1520 he attended the king at the lavish ceremonies of the Field of Cloth of Gold in France. Through Wolsey's influence Parr was in July 1525 made chamberlain for the newly formed household of the king's illegitimate son, the duke of Richmond, established at Sheriff Hutton in Yorkshire. To Parr this looked like a golden opportunity for advancement, but he quickly discovered that the office was neither as lucrative nor as powerful as he had hoped. Bitter quarrels with one of Richmond's tutors, Richard Croke, did much to increase Parr's disenchantment. By 1530 he had resigned and returned to Horton, although he held a place on the duke's council until Richmond's death in 1536.<br>
<br>An avid supporter of the new religion, albeit probably more for political than spiritual reasons, Parr became Cromwell's chief agent for the dissolution of the monasteries in Northamptonshire which led to several virulent quarrels with disaffected churchmen, particularly the abbot of Peterborough. In 1538 he received as reward a parcel of six lucrative rectories from dissolved religious foundations and the former monastery of Pipewell. After Cromwell's death, he found a new patron in his niece, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4893/', "Katherine or Kateryn")</script>, the daughter of his brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/58875/', "Sir Thomas Parr (1478&#150;1517)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/52790/', "Parr family (per. c.1370&#150;1517)")</script>]. When she married the king on 12 July 1543, he became chamberlain of her household. On 23 December following he was created Baron Parr of Horton and in February 1544 received a substantial grant of lands in Bedfordshire and Northamptonshire, including Kettering and Pytchley manors.<br>
<br>During the summer of 1544, at the queen's request, Parr was named to her regency council while Henry VIII was in France. In failing health, Parr apparently retired instead to Horton, as his name does not appear in the council minutes. He nevertheless remained an important adviser to the queen and messages passed between them regularly. In the summer of 1546, during the plot by religious conservatives against the queen, Parr returned to court and helped to foil the conspiracy by smuggling proscribed books out of her garderobe. He died at Horton the following year, probably on 10 September, and was buried in Horton church, where he is commemorated by a marble effigy.<br>
