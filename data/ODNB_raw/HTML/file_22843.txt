<span class="headword">Prout,  John Skinner</span>  (1806&#150;1876), <span class="occ">watercolour painter</span>, was born at Plymouth in 1806, perhaps the son of Thomas Prout. Although a nephew of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22844/', "Samuel Prout (1783&#150;1852)")</script>, whose style he began by emulating, he was largely self-taught, perhaps because his uncle was then building his career in London. He was educated at Plymouth grammar school. In early life Prout moved to Bristol and produced topographical watercolours and architectural lithographs, notably the sets of the <span class="italic">Antiquities of Chester</span> and <span class="italic">Castles and Abbeys of Monmouthshire</span> (1838). In June and July 1833 he toured Wales and visited Dublin with Samuel Jackson and William James M&uuml;ller, fellow members of the newly founded Bristol sketching club. Towards the end of the 1830s, however, he found himself in &#145;continued difficulties and harassment of mind&#146;  (Bonyhady, 44). He was elected to the New Society of Painters in Water Colours in 1838, but his membership lapsed after his departure for Sydney two years later.<br>
<br>In Australia Prout shone as a painter, printmaker, teacher, and promoter of the fine arts, his greatest success coming after his move to Hobart, Tasmania, in 1843. There he built up a considerable teaching practice, and was on friendly terms with John Glover and his family: his sketch of the older artist asleep in a chair was used in Glover's obituary in the <span class="italic">Art Journal</span> in July 1850. He also produced three volumes of lithographs of scenery around Sydney, Melbourne, Geelong, and Hobart, and he gave lectures and mounted exhibitions. In April 1848, after a farewell concert attended by the governor, he left Hobart for England.<br>
<br>Prout was re-elected associate and member of the New Society of Painters in Water Colours in 1849 and 1862 respectively, and he lived off Australian subject matter for a number of years. In 1850 his <span class="italic">Dioramic Views Illustrative of Convict and Emigrant Life</span>, accompanied by a publication with the same title, was shown in London, and two years later he produced a panorama, <span class="italic">A Voyage to Australia and a Visit to the Gold Fields</span>. He had not himself visited the goldfields, and his two collaborators on the project had never even been to Australia. Probably his most notable works, in Tasmania and later, were of tree ferns, especially in the Valley of Ferns, near Hobart, which for picturesque effect he peopled with the Aborigines who had already been exiled to Flinders Island. His later style perhaps owes more to J. M. W. Turner, J. D. Harding, and his fellow members of the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/95531', "Bristol school of artists")</script>, than to his uncle.<br>
<br>Prout returned to Bristol, but later moved permanently to London, where he died of kidney disease on 29 August 1876 at his home, 4 Leighton Crescent, Kentish Town; his brother Thomas, who lived in Plymouth, was with him. The date of his marriage and wife's name are unknown, but they had two daughters, Agnes and Mary, who each exhibited a sea-shore subject at the Society of British Artists in 1869. There was a studio sale at Christies on 26 February 1877. Sixty-three of Prout's paintings were used in E. C. Booth's <span class="italic">Australia Illustrated</span> (1873&#150;6), and in 1893 some of his Bristol drawings with letterpress descriptions were published as <span class="italic">Picturesque Antiquities of Bristol</span>. In Australia the New South Wales and Tasmanian state galleries, the Mitchell Library and Dixson Gallery, Sydney, and the National Library, Canberra, have examples of his work. In Britain there are watercolours in the British and Victoria and Albert museums, and in provincial galleries at Bristol, Cambridge, Chester, Exeter, Leeds, Leicester, Newport, and Reading.<br>
