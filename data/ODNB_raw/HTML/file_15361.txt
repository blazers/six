<span class="headword">Kennedy,  Alexander</span>  (1695&#150;<em>c.</em>1785), <span class="occ">violin maker</span>, was the first of an eminent family, famous for its prolific output of string instruments. He was born in Scotland and moved to London early in the eighteenth century, and set up business from about 1730 in Oxford market, north of Oxford Street. He made only violins, which he built on the high-arched Stainer model, and varnished with a brownish yellow spirit varnish. He is regarded as &#145;one of the better London makers&#146; of the mid-eighteenth century, and his instruments are generally well made and with &#145;well-figured wood&#146;  (Harvey, 359). He died about 1785. His nephew <a name="cosubject_15383"></a><span class="headword">John Kennedy</span>  (1729/30&#150;1816)<span class="occ"></span> was apprenticed to him. Remaining in London, John subsequently established himself in Cooper's Gardens, near Shoreditch church; in Houghton Street, then Clement's Lane, Clare Market; and in Long Alley, Sun Street, Moorfields. At the height of his success he employed several assistants making violins and violas of the high German model. His instruments were mainly cheap violins (roughly made and unpurfled) with a light reddish varnish, made principally for the music shops. He died in poor circumstances at Long Alley, Moorfields, in 1816, aged eighty-six, and was buried in Shoreditch churchyard. He was married three times; the eldest son from the third marriage was <a name="cosubject_15392"></a><span class="headword">Thomas Kennedy</span>  (1784&#150;1872)<span class="occ"></span>, the best-known maker of the family. He was born in Houghton Street, Clare Market, London, on 21 January 1784. After working for some time in his father's shop, he was apprenticed to Thomas Powell (17 June 1795), and at the beginning of the nineteenth century he worked occasionally for the younger William Forster (whose son was subsequently apprenticed to him). In 1811 he set up his own business at 19 Princes Street, Westminster. From there he moved to 364 Oxford Street, nearby, where he worked for thirty-three years. Like his father, he worked a great deal for the music trade, and, being a rapid and neat (if uneven) workman, was one of the most prolific of English makers. He is credited with about 2000 instruments, including at least 300 cellos based mainly on the Amati model. His best work is of a very high quality and achieves high prices at auction (see Harvey, who also includes a plate of one of Kennedy's violins dated 1844). In June 1849 he retired from business and moved to 162 Pentonville Road, London, where he died on 24 January 1872. He was married to Jane (<i>b</i>. 1780/81), but had no family. One of his violin-making pupils was James Brown (1759&#150;1834), a former silk weaver, who, like his son and pupil, James Brown the younger (1786&#150;<i>c</i>.1860), produced works of a reasonable but variable quality.<br>
