<span class="headword">Adams,  James Williams</span>  (1839&#150;1903), <span class="occ">army chaplain</span>, born on 24 November 1839 in Cork, was the only son of James O'Brien Adams, magistrate of Cork (<i>d</i>. 1854), and his wife, Elizabeth Williams. Educated at Hamlin and Porter's School, on the South Mall, Cork, he went to Trinity College, Dublin (BA 1861). He excelled in athletics, and was regarded as the strongest man in Ireland, vying with his friend Frederick Burnaby in gymnastic feats. He was ordained deacon 1863 and priest 1864 and served curacies at Hyde, Hampshire (1863&#150;5), and at Shottesbrooke, Berkshire (1865&#150;6).<br>
<br>In October 1866 Adams became a chaplain on the Bengal establishment under Bishop Robert Milman at Calcutta. There he had a severe attack of fever, and after sick leave in Ceylon was appointed to Peshawar. He was tireless in visiting the outstations Nowshera and Kohat; he restored and beautified the church and cemetery at Peshawar, and received the thanks of government for his exertions in the cholera camps during two outbreaks. Except for some months at Allahabad (March to December 1870) he remained at Peshawar until December 1872. He was then stationed at the camp of exercise at Hassan-Abdal army headquarters until March 1873, and in 1874 he was sent to Kashmir on special duty. There he built, largely with his own hands, a church of pine logs, where services were frequently held for the numerous visitors to Gulmarg and Sonamarg; it was later accidentally burnt down. In January 1876 he was appointed to Meerut, and in December took charge of the cavalry and artillery camp for the Delhi durbar on the visit of the prince of Wales.<br>
<br>Subsequently Adams experienced much active service. In November 1878 he joined the Kurram field force under Sir Frederick (afterwards Earl) Roberts, and was at all the operations in the advance on Kabul. At Killa Kazi on 11 December 1879 he risked his life in rescuing several injured men of the 9th lancers, who were in danger of drowning in a watercourse while under Afghan fire. Lord Roberts witnessed Adams's exploit and recommended him for the Victoria Cross, which he received from the queen on 4 August 1881. He also took part in Roberts's march from Kabul to Kandahar in August 1880, and was at the battle of Kandahar on 1 September 1880. While in England on furlough he married on 16 August 1881 Alice Mary, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29611/', "General Sir Thomas Willshire")</script>. She survived him with their only daughter, Edith Juliet Mary.<br>
<br>On returning to India later in 1881 Adams spent a year at Lucknow, then three years (1883&#150;5) at Naini Tal. In 1885 he accompanied the field force under Roberts to Burma, and took part in the operations there.<br>
<br>Through twenty years' service in India &#145;Padre Adams&#146; was highly regarded by the soldiers. In 1886 he settled in England, and from 1887 to 1894 he held the rectory of Postwick near Norwich. After two years' rest in Jersey he became in 1896 vicar of Stow Bardolph with Wimbotsham near Downham Market. He was appointed in 1900 honorary chaplain to Queen Victoria, and King Edward made him chaplain-in-ordinary in 1901. In 1902 he left Stow for the small living of Ashwell, near Oakham, Rutland. There, at the rectory, he died on 20 October 1903.<br>
