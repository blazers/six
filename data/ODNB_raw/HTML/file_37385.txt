<span class="headword">Eckersley,  Peter Pendleton</span>  (1892&#150;1963), <span class="occ">broadcasting engineer</span>, was born on 6 January 1892 in Puebla, Mexico, the third son, and the third and youngest child, of (William) Alfred Eckersley, a railway engineer, and his wife, Rachel, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/14320/', "Thomas Henry Huxley")</script>, physiologist. Eckersley's elder brother was the physicist and engineer <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32966/', "Thomas Lydwell Eckersley")</script>. Educated at Bedales School, he was apprenticed with the Manchester firm of Mather and Platt before entering Manchester Municipal College of Technology in 1912. He graduated with a certificate of electrical engineering in 1915, and on 17 March 1917 married Stella (<i>b</i>. 1894/5), daughter of Julian Charles Grove, tea merchant, son of Sir George Grove, writer on music; they had two sons and one daughter.<br>
<br>Peter had become interested in wireless and the work of Marconi while at Bedales, and he served with the Royal Flying Corps as a wireless equipment officer from 1915 to 1918, mainly in Egypt and at Salonika, and was then sent to the Wireless Experimental Station at Biggin Hill. In 1919 he joined Marconi's Wireless Telegraph Company as head of the experimental section of its designs department. He worked at Writtle, near Chelmsford, where he was the leader of an able, if unconventional, team that provided regular transmissions of programmes for radio amateurs at the request of the Radio Society of Great Britain.<br>
<br>A lively and energetic character, enjoying publicity and recognized by his contemporaries as a &#145;personality&#146;, Eckersley did more than any other person to lay the technical foundation of broadcasting in Britain. In 1923 he was hired personally by John Reith as chief engineer of the recently formed British Broadcasting Company, staying in the post until 1929, by which time it had become a public corporation. Eckersley was fully in charge of the &#145;spreading of the service&#146;, and of converting his own idea of a regional plan for radio transmission into a reality. He was highly successful, both in negotiating behind the scenes with the Post Office and in informing and interesting listeners in the implications for them&#151;such as a choice of programmes&#151;of developing communications technology. He also played a prominent part in the first international meetings on wavelength allocation and in the preparations for empire broadcasting.<br>
<br>The high point of Eckersley's BBC career was the opening in 1929 of the first dual transmitter high-power station in Brookman's Park, north of London. It had been conceived of in 1927, but by the time of its delayed opening, Eckersley had been compelled to leave the corporation, after a painful divorce earlier in 1929. The parting with Reith, who was temperamentally completely different from him and who had been a friend as well as a colleague, was difficult for both men. On resigning from the BBC Eckersley received a gratuity, and stayed on as a consultant until the beginning of October 1929. He also had lucrative consultancies with the Marconi Company and His Master's Voice, part of the Radio Corporation of America. Despite these political and financial difficulties, Eckersley continued throughout the 1930s to develop his often original ideas on communications technology, regarding himself as &#145;an inventor of mechanisms to serve ideas&#146;. Although never attracted by television, he was fascinated by the possibilities of cable broadcasting. In 1931 he was one of the founders of Rediffusion; the company name was suggested by him. In 1932 Eckersley went briefly to Australia to advise on the setting up of a national broadcasting organization. He was also interested in radio advertising. Some of his ideas were set out in his only book, <span class="italic">The Power behind the Microphone</span> (1941), which also charted, albeit selectively, his own experience.<br>
<br>Eckersley's second wife, whom he married on 25 October 1930, was Frances Dorothy (<i>b</i>. 1894), divorced wife of Edward Thomas Clark and daughter of Lieutenant-Colonel Arthur James Stephen, a member of the distinguished Stephen family. The new marriage had political, and later ideological, overtones. Eckersley joined Oswald Mosley's new party in 1931, and from 1935 they spent each summer holiday in Germany where they admired the progress that Germany was making under national socialism. When war was declared in 1939 Dorothy and the son of her first marriage remained in Germany, where they earned a living broadcasting in English on German radio the bulletins prepared for them. Eckersley himself blamed Britain for declaring war in 1939 and for opposing Hitler, and British intelligence kept a sizeable dossier on him. He had declared himself bankrupt in 1939.<br>
<br>Eckersley's war-time years were frustrating&#151;he called them &#145;shabby&#146;&#151;even when his security problems became less serious, and on one occasion he attempted suicide. Yet he remained innovatory in his attitudes to radio and set out to exploit his &#145;talking telephone&#146;. In 1943 he joined with Belgian and Polish colleagues in exile to devise a long-wave public service European radio network. &#145;Electromagnetic waves know no frontiers&#146;, they explained. &#145;Broadcasting symbolises through the ether the unity of nations.&#146;<br>
<br>His last bachelor years after 1945 were more tranquil. He protected Dorothy when, having been arrested by the British army, she was brought back to London in 1945 to face trial and imprisonment in Holloway, but the marriage had long been dead. By 1961 the BBC was beginning to acknowledge the major contribution he had made to its early history; Eckersley was photographed with Reith and Hugh Greene, then BBC director-general, at the Institution of Electrical Engineers, on the occasion of the publication of the first volume of the corporation's history. His last journey was to try to market his talking telephone in the Cameroons. He died at the West London Hospital, Hammersmith, on 18 March 1963, leaving just enough money to pay his outstanding debts.<br>
