<span class="headword">MacDonald,  Donald  Dubh</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1545), <span class="occ">rebel</span>, was the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/54282/', "Angus (Angus &#211;g) MacDonald")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/54280/', "MacDonald family (per. c.1300&#150;c.1500)")</script>] and a daughter (perhaps named Mary) of Colin Campbell, first earl of Argyll. Angus died about 1490, and so did not live to see the event which above all else shaped the life of his son, namely the forfeiture of the lordship of the Isles in 1493 by Donald's grandfather, John MacDonald, and the consequent eclipse of his family. Archibald Campbell, who became second earl in 1493, must have consented to his sister's imprisonment in Innis Chonnell Castle on Loch Awe and young Donald claimed to have been born in captivity. He escaped in 1501, and found shelter first with Torquil MacLeod of Lewis and then with Maclean of Duart, and was welcomed as the rightful heir to the lordship of the Isles. Lochaber was invaded and Badenoch plundered, while as part of the king's response a Scottish fleet was gathered in 1504, with Andrew Wood and Robert Barton taking part. One account says that Donald took refuge in the castle of Cairnburgh in the Treshnish Isles off Mull; recaptured in 1506, he was brought to the lowlands and lodged in Edinburgh Castle. After being held in ward for nearly forty years &#145;until his hair got grey&#146;, reports show that he was free by May 1543. That was the year when Matthew Stewart, earl of Lennox, returned to Scotland from abroad, and it was not long before Donald, with Lennox as intermediary, was in touch with Henry VIII and other enemies of the Scottish crown.<br>
<br>In June 1545 Donald Dubh MacDonald (the epithet means &#145;black&#146;) was being blamed by the privy council for the harrying and slaying of the young queen's subjects both in the islands and on the mainland, assisted by the king of England, and he was threatened with dire penalties if he and his supporters did not cease from such treasonable and rebellious conduct. Donald acted with the advice and consent of his barons, who formed a revived council of the Isles on the model of that which had met during the heyday of the lordship; this included, besides the leading men of his own clan, the Maclean chief and cadets, MacLeods, MacNeills, Mackinnon, and MacQuarrie. Meeting near Islay in July and at Knockfergus in northern Ireland in the following month, this body, along with Donald himself, took oaths of allegiance to King Henry and agreed to operate under Lennox's command. They were to assist in the invasion and conquest of Scotland, where Donald would hold the lordship lands (once they had been reclaimed) of King Henry, from whom he was to have an annual pension of 2000 crowns for his services.<br>
<br>Two commissioners were appointed to put these proposals to the king; calling himself earl of Ross and lord of the Isles of Scotland, Donald Dubh MacDonald wrote a personal letter of humble submission in Latin to King Henry; after communing with Lennox (now married to Henry's niece) and his council, Henry received the two island commissioners in September, and an agreement was drawn up taking into account the articles submitted through them. This was readily accepted, and as an assurance of good faith Henry's advisers were given examples of the persecution suffered by those in what were called &#145;the wyld Ilis of Scotland&#146; which had made them always the enemies of the Scottish realm. Donald has been credited with aiming to revive a form of Celtic kingship for himself under the English flag; observers say that he had 180 galleys and 4000 men with him when he sailed across the narrow seas to Ireland, and another 4000 at home to keep Huntly and Argyll busy when they were active in the North and South Isles on behalf of the Scottish government. At Knockfergus, Donald was joined by Lennox, but after some delay a full-scale invasion of Scotland from the west was postponed. What proved to be the last substantial attempt to re-establish the lordship of the Isles ended late in 1545 with Donald's death of a fever at Drogheda, without any direct heir to succeed him, but leaving a &#145;base son&#146; whom he bequeathed to the English king's service.<br>
