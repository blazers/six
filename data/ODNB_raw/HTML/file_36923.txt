<span class="headword">Williams,  Hugh</span>  (1843&#150;1911), <span class="occ">ecclesiastical historian</span>, the son of Hugh Williams (1812/13&#150;1905), carrier and small freeholder, of Menai Bridge, Anglesey, and his wife, Jane, was born at Menai Bridge on 17 September 1843. After attending schools in his native village and at Bangor, he worked for some years as a mason, at the same time continuing his studies. In 1864 he entered the Calvinistic Methodist college, Bala, where he acted as one of the tutors between 1867 and 1869. He graduated BA (London) in 1870 (first in second-class honours in classics), and MA (London) in 1871 (second in philosophy honours). From 1872 to 1875 he conducted a grammar school at Menai Bridge, at the same time ministering to Calvinistic Methodists in Anglesey, being ordained in 1873. He was appointed professor of Greek and mathematics at Bala in August 1873 and took up the post in the following year. In the vacation of 1874 he visited Germany to study the language. On 31 December 1884 he married Mary, eldest daughter of Urias Bromley of Old Hall, Chester; they had no children.<br>
<br>When the Bala college was converted into a theological college in 1891 Williams was appointed professor of church history. In 1903&#150;4 he was moderator of the North Wales Calvinistic Methodist Association. On 19 April 1904 he was awarded the degree of DD by Glasgow University. His hard work told upon his health, and he was for some time troubled by a form of laryngitis. In addition to his other work he preached every Sunday (though not reckoned a popular preacher) and conducted a weekly <span class="roman">Bible</span> class. He was a member of the theological board and court of the University of Wales; also of the council of the Bangor college (later University of Wales, Bangor). After suffering for nearly two years from arterial disease, he died at the college in Bala on 11 May 1911, and was buried in the churchyard of Llanycil, Merioneth, the parish in which Bala is situated.<br>
<br>Williams published commentaries in Welsh on <span class="roman">Galatians</span> and <span class="roman">Colossians</span> but his historical works were more significant. He made his mark by his edition of &#145;Gildas&#146;, with English translation and notes, published in two parts in the <span class="italic">Cymrodorion Record</span> series in 1899 and 1901. He also published various magazine articles and separate papers, including &#145;Some aspects of the Christian church in Wales in the fifth and sixth centuries&#146; (1895), &#145;The four disciples of Illtud&#146; (1897), and the article on the Welsh church in the 1889&#150;96 edition of the <span class="italic">Encyclopaedia Cambrensis</span> (<span class="italic">Gwyddoniadur Cymreig</span>). These were followed by a review of Heinrich Zimmer's <span class="italic">Keltische Kirche</span> (1901), &#145;Pelagius in Irland&#146; (1901) in the <span class="italic">Zeitschrift f&uuml;r Celtische Philologie</span> (1903), and the article on the British church in James Hastings's <span class="italic">Encyclopaedia of Religion and Ethics</span> (1910). These essays prepared the way for his most significant work, <span class="italic">Christianity in Early Britain</span>, which was published posthumously in 1912. It brought him a considerable reputation in Britain, France, and Germany. Placing great emphasis upon fact and eschewing speculation, it set a new standard of scholarship. Inevitably, however, its conclusions have to be modified with the passage of time, particularly in the light of archaeological discoveries in recent decades.<br>
