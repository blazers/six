<span class="headword">Cloete, Sir  Abraham Josias</span>  (1794&#150;1886), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, second son of Peter Laurence Cloete, member of the council of the Cape of Good Hope, was born in Cape Town on 7 August 1794. He was educated in Holland and at the Royal Military College, Marlow. Appointed to a cornetcy in the 15th hussars on 29 January 1809, he was promoted successively lieutenant (1810), captain (1812), brevet-major (1822), lieutenant-colonel (1837), colonel (1851), major-general (1856), lieutenant-general (1863), and general (1871). Joining the 15th hussars in England soon after its return from Corunna, Cloete served with it during the Burdett riots of 1810 and the Luddite disturbances in the midlands and Lancashire of the following years.<br>
<br>On 28 October 1813 Cloete exchanged to the 21st light dragoons at the Cape, and returned as aide-de-camp to the newly appointed governor, Lord Charles Somerset. He commanded a military detachment of volunteers from regiments at the Cape, sent to occupy the desert island of Tristan da Cunha soon after the arrival of the emperor Napoleon at St Helena. Leaving the detachment there, Cloete resumed his duties as aide-de-camp. In 1817 Cloete accompanied his regiment to India, and served with a squadron employed as a field force in Cuttack, on the frontiers of Orissa and Bihar, during the Pindarri war of 1817&#150;19. The 21st dragoons (a party at St Helena excepted) was disbanded in England in May 1819, and Cloete was placed on half pay. In 1820 he was employed, with the rank of deputy assistant quartermaster-general, in superintending the landing and settling on the eastern frontier of Cape Colony, in the districts of Albany and Somerset, of a large body of government immigrants, known as the &#145;settlers of 1820&#146;. In 1822 he was sent home with important dispatches, after which he was appointed town-major of Cape Town, a post he held until 1840. He served in the Cape Frontier War of 1834&#150;5. In 1836 he was made KH, and at the time of his death was the last surviving knight companion of the Royal Guelphic Order in the <span class="italic">Army List</span>.<br>
<br>In 1840 Cloete was appointed deputy quartermaster-general at the Cape, and retained the post until 1854. In 1842 he was sent with reinforcements from Cape Town to relieve a small force under Captain Smith, 27th Inniskillings, which was besieged by Boers near Durban, when his firm and judicious action not only prevented a war with the Boers but also prepared the permanent settlement of the colony of Natal. He was quartermaster-general in the Cape Frontier War of 1846&#150;7 and was mentioned in dispatches, and in 1848 was made CB. He was chief of the staff with the army in the field in the Cape Frontier War of 1850&#150;53, including the operations in the Basuto country, and the battle of the Berea, where he commanded a division. He was mentioned in dispatches in the <span class="italic">London Gazette</span> (4 May 1852), and knighted for his services in 1854. As major-general on the staff he commanded the troops in the Windward and Leeward islands from 1855 to 1861. He was made colonel 19th foot (later the Princess of Wales's Own Yorkshire regiment) in 1861, and KCB in 1862. He was placed on the retired list in 1877.<br>
<br>Cloete had married on 8 May 1857 Anne Woollcombe Louis (<i>d</i>. 1906), granddaughter of Rear-Admiral Sir Thomas Louis, bt; they had a son and a daughter. As a young man, he had fought a duel with the surgeon James Barry over his future wife's aunt. He died at his home, 88 Gloucester Terrace, Hyde Park, London, on 26 October 1886.<br>
