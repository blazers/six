</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Phillpotts,  Henry</span>  (1778&#150;1869), <span class="occ">bishop of Exeter</span>, was born on 6 May 1778 at Bridgwater, Somerset, the second son among twenty-four children of John Phillpotts (1743&#150;1814) and his wife, Sybella (1752&#150;1833), daughter and coheir of Samuel Codrington Glover of Bridgwater. His elder brother, a barrister, John (1775&#150;1849), sat as Liberal MP for Gloucester 1830&#150;31, 1832&#150;5, and 1837&#150;47. At the time of Henry's birth his father ran a pottery and brick factory in Bridgwater. He sold the estate of Sonke at Llangarron, Herefordshire, which had been in the family for two centuries, in 1791. In 1782 the family moved to Gloucester, where John became landlord of The Bell inn and a freeman. He then worked as an auctioneer and land and timber surveyor, moving to Wallsworth, and in 1799 was appointed land agent to the dean and chapter.<h2>
<a name="Educationandmarriage"></a>Education and marriage</h2>A pupil of the Gloucester Cathedral school under Arthur Benoni Evans, Henry Phillpotts won a scholarship to Corpus Christi College, Oxford, matriculating in 1791. In 1795 he graduated BA and was elected probationer fellow of Magdalen College on the Somerset foundation, shortly after winning the chancellor's prize for his essay &#145;On the influence of religious principle&#146;. While at Magdalen he won the Asiatic Society's prize for a Latin panegyric on Sir William Jones, proceeded MA in 1798, and served as junior bursar of the college in 1801 (a plane tree he planted was still standing 200 years later). Phillpotts was elected university praelector of moral philosophy in 1800, and acted as examiner for honours (1802&#150;3). Among his Oxford friends were Edward Copleston and Henry Digby Beste (a convert to Roman Catholicism in 1798). The most significant relationship to emerge from his Magdalen years, however, was the friendship formed with the president, Martin Routh, who helped shape his religious views and remained one of Phillpotts's most trusted counsellors until his death in 1854. Routh's influence led to Phillpotts's ordination as deacon in 1802 and then priest in 1804. Phillpotts resigned his fellowship on his marriage on 27 October 1804 to a niece of Lady Eldon, Deborah Maria (<i>d</i>. 1863), daughter of William Surtees (1750&#150;1832) of Bath and his wife, Elizabeth Catherine. The couple had eighteen children, of whom no fewer than seven followed their father into holy orders. Although Phillpotts departed from Oxford, in 1805 refusing the duke of Portland's offer of the principalship of Hertford College, he maintained a lifelong interest in the university, graduated BD and DD (1821), and was elected an honorary fellow of Magdalen in 1862.<h2>
<a name="Earlyprefermentinthechurch"></a>Early preferment in the church</h2>Phillpotts's first preferment was the crown living of Kilmersdon, near Bath, which he received (probably through Lord Eldon's influence) in 1804. He seems never to have resided there or at Stainton-le-Street, co. Durham, another crown living received the following year. Resigning Kilmersdon in 1806, Phillpotts was presented to the crown living of Bishop Middleham, where he resided for two years, Routh's recommendation having secured him a chaplaincy to Shute Barrington, bishop of Durham. It was to support Barrington in a controversy with the Roman Catholic John Lingard in 1806 that Phillpotts made the first of his innumerable sallies into pamphlet controversies. This may have led the bishop to reward him with the important living of Gateshead in 1808 and in 1809 the ninth prebendal stall at Durham. Middleham was given up in 1810 on Phillpotts's collation by the dean and chapter to St Margaret's Chapel, Durham, and the remainder of his Durham career was punctuated by further lucrative preferment: promotion to the second stall in 1815, and in 1820 (on resigning it) appointment to another episcopal living, Stanhope, one of the richest livings in England. Barrington insisted on residence (and counselled the renunciation of cards) as a condition of this last piece of largess, and Phillpotts spent &pound;12,000 on the construction of a new parsonage. Both in Durham and at Stanhope Phillpotts was a conscientious pastor, and in the latter instance an active magistrate. It was his prolific activity as a controversialist, however, that brought both wider recognition of Phillpotts's considerable talents and notoriety.<h2>
<a name="Defenderoftheestablishedorder"></a>Defender of the established order</h2>Phillpotts entered the lists in defence of both Anglicanism and the social and political order, to the preservation of which he believed the establishment essential. In 1819 he attacked proposals for reform of the law of settlement and for the abolition of the <span class="roman">Test Act</span>, but it was his resolute defence of the authorities in the wake of Peterloo, singling out J. G. Lambton (later Lord Durham) for censure, that provoked a bitter attack on Phillpotts in the <span class="italic">Edinburgh Review</span> and a controversy in which he was widely judged to have emerged victorious. His tory credentials were confirmed in the following year when he promoted a clerical address in support of the government in the Queen Caroline affair, accusing Earl Grey of opportunism in championing her cause. This resulted in a foretaste of Phillpotts's other great passion beside pamphleteering&#151;litigation&#151;when whig lawyers sought unsuccessfully to prove a libel. In the article &#145;Durham clergy&#151;clerical abuses&#146;, published in November 1822, the <span class="italic">Edinburgh Review</span> once more singled him out, and further controversy ensued. By 1823 his growing reputation led Liverpool to contemplate his promotion to the Irish see of Clogher, a preferment Phillpotts spurned.<br>
<br>From 1825 the Catholic question became the dominant theme in Phillpotts's writings and won him national prominence, reflected in his elevation to the deanery of Chester in May 1828. His <span class="italic">Letters to Charles Butler</span> (1825) set out key doctrinal differences between the Anglican and Roman Catholic churches; they were followed in 1827 by two <span class="italic">Letters to Canning</span>, arguing that current schemes for emancipation offered inadequate securities, and proposing an alternative test in which Catholics would accept the possibility of salvation within the Church of England and renounce any intention of harming it. Public perception of Phillpotts as a leading opponent of emancipation was confirmed by <span class="italic">A Letter to an English Layman on the Coronation Oath</span> (1828). This was an exercise in damage limitation after his publication of private correspondence between George III and Pitt which provided useful ammunition for opponents; such miscalculations were Phillpotts's chief weakness as a controversialist. Phillpotts also engaged in extensive (if one-sided) private correspondence with Wellington, Eldon, and others, in which he discussed the developing political situation and proposed possible securities. As early as 1812 Phillpotts had told Barrington that, given adequate safeguards, he had no objection to relief, and a letter to Eldon demonstrates that by October 1828 he felt that now inevitable concessions should be enacted, while the government still had control of the situation. This conviction, combined with a belief that Peel had behaved honourably, led Phillpotts to support Peel in the Oxford election of 1829, even though emancipation had been enacted without some of his specified precautions. Public opinion, however, interpreted this vote as evidence that Phillpotts (&#145;the great rat&#146;) was an unprincipled careerist, <span class="italic">The Times</span> commenting that he had &#145;wheeled to the right and about as if by military command&#146; (3 February 1829). The accusation dogged Phillpotts throughout his career.<h2>
<a name="BishopofExeterfrom1830"></a>Bishop of Exeter, from 1830</h2>Phillpotts's vindication of his position was not assisted by his elevation to the bishopric of Exeter in November 1830, although Wellington explicitly stated that it was done in spite of, rather than as reward for, the <i>volte-face</i> of 1829. Phillpotts suffered further embarrassment when the ministry fell before completing arrangements for his preferment. The outgoing administration had accepted Phillpotts's request that he be allowed to retain Stanhope <i>in commendam</i> to supplement the see's meagre income of &pound;2700 a year; his three predecessors at Exeter had all kept such a living, and his three predecessors at Stanhope had so held it. Some parishioners petitioned against the arrangement, however, and Sir James Graham led the new cabinet, settling old scores, to repudiate it. The stand-off was resolved by Bishop Van Mildert of Durham, who presented a canon of the cathedral to Stanhope and then preferred Phillpotts to the vacant sixth stall, which he retained until his death, regularly going into residence. The incident further damaged his public standing.<br>
<br>The new bishop soon acquired a reputation as one of the ablest and most outspoken debaters in the Lords, if often as much a liability as an asset to the causes he championed. In its obituary, <span class="italic">The Times</span> (20 September 1869) judged that &#145;From the days of Pitt and Fox down to those of Gladstone and Bright, few Parliamentary speakers have excelled the late Bishop&#146;. In the course of his long parliamentary career Phillpotts generally found himself opposing rather than supporting legislation: he signed more protests against bills successful in the Lords than any other nineteenth-century bishop and all but two peers. An early instance was the 1832 <span class="roman">Reform Bill</span>. During the debates of 1831&#150;2 Phillpotts engaged in bitter exchanges with his old whig adversaries, condemning not only the bill but the methods employed to promote it. Although references to a connection between the administration and <span class="italic">The Times</span> subsequently forced Phillpotts into a humiliating retraction, Greville among others admired his speech of 11 April 1832 as &#145;full of fire and venom, very able&#146;, while thinking it unclerical  (<span class="italic">Greville Memoirs</span>, 14 April 1832). His prominence in the debates confirmed his notoriety in radical circles. Both the bishop and his palace were threatened by an Exeter mob in November 1831, and he was burnt in effigy at Durham. This enmity was fully returned: Phillpotts secured the dismissal of Thomas Latimer as editor of <span class="italic">Woolmer's Exeter and Plymouth Gazette</span> in 1831, and in 1840 led the call for legislative action against the socialism of Robert Owen.<br>
<br>On many issues Phillpotts was happy to adopt an independent stance: unlike most fellow tories opposing the Crimean War at the outset, for example. Much of Phillpotts's parliamentary activity, however, was directed towards upholding an essentially static, localist, and paternalist social order against the threats posed by centralization and the diffusion of political economy (he voted against the repeal of the corn laws and for factory regulation). Phillpotts was a persistent critic of the new poor law of 1834, which he claimed converted the poor's right to relief into a privilege. He clashed with C. J. Blomfield over the bastardy clauses which he argued unfairly held the mother solely responsible, and after the act was passed regularly presented petitions highlighting abuses and inadequacies in the new system, which he attributed in part to the ignorance of the wealthy of the physical demands of labouring life.<br>
<br>Phillpotts's orthodox high-churchmanship and command of both legal and theological argument gave his contributions to debates on ecclesiastical matters a coherence and authority which few contemporaries could match. He consistently resisted all measures which he feared would weaken what remained of the confessional character of the state, such as the <span class="roman">Irish Church Temporalities Act</span>, tithe commutation, abolition of church rates, the <span class="roman">Act for the Registration of Marriages</span> (1836), the <span class="roman">Religious Opinions Bill</span> (1846), the <span class="roman">Deceased Wife's Sister Bill</span> (which he called the <span class="roman">Incestuous Marriages Bill</span>), and the <span class="roman">Divorce and Matrimonial Causes Bill</span> of 1857. A particular cause for concern was the position of Roman Catholicism in Ireland and the colonies, Phillpotts opposing the Irish corporations and charitable bequests bills, and protesting at the handling of the Canadian clergy reserves and the incorporation of the seminary of St Sulpice. As an orthodox high-churchman, however, Phillpotts's concern for the protestant establishment did not preclude commitment to <i>jure divino</i> church principles, and these came to the fore prominently in his interventions on church reform, in which he sought to protect the institutional and doctrinal integrity of the Anglican church. Phillpotts recognized the need for reform: in 1835, no doubt with an eye on further advancement, he favoured Peel with a lengthy list of suggestions, including a reorganization of dioceses, improved clergy discipline, and reform of cathedral chapters to make them more useful to the church. It was typical of his sense of the church's prerogatives that he also pressed Peel to consider whether lay impropriators could be compelled to surrender their property. But the appointment of a permanent ecclesiastical commission and its concomitant centralization appeared to Phillpotts incompatible with the constitution of an episcopal church, and he claimed that in its original form (with a majority of the membership ministers or crown appointments) it might in enemy hands become an instrument for the spoliation of the church.<br>
<br>In 1840 Phillpotts led the opposition to the <span class="roman">Ecclesiastical Duties and Revenues Bill</span> in another exchange with Blomfield, arguing against the reduction of cathedral chapters and instead for a charge on dignitaries. If Phillpotts was unable to obstruct these measures, he had more success resisting the clergy discipline bills of 1836&#150;40&#151;&#145;the greatest blow that ever was struck against the Church of England, as a church&#146;  (<span class="italic">Hansard 3</span>, 14, 1832, 603), which like the commission he saw as calculated to undermine episcopal authority through centralization. The act finally passed in 1840 owed much to his alternative proposals. Subsequent attempts to centralize disciplinary procedures similarly encountered Phillpotts's resistance, although his chief concern became the role of the judicial committee of the privy council as the final court of appeal in ecclesiastical causes, which he believed violated the spiritual prerogatives of the church. Such intrusions were to be feared not least because the state could not be trusted to uphold doctrinal orthodoxy: in 1847 Phillpotts was prominent in organizing opposition to the appointment of Renn Dickson Hampden as bishop of Hereford, having, in view of Hampden's unorthodox teaching, previously ceased to require ordinands to produce certificates of attendance at the regius professor's lectures. Phillpotts's concern that the church should have a forum in which to express its sentiments on such matters led him to take a leading role in the campaign which resulted in the gradual restoration of convocation during the early 1850s.<h2>
<a name="Diocesanreform"></a>Diocesan reform</h2>The episcopal office was central to Phillpotts's understanding of the church. This was reflected in his attitude to his own diocesan responsibilities. Phillpotts was an active diocesan reformer, placing particular stress on reducing non-residence (the ninety-three non-residents in Cornwall in 1830 had been cut to twelve by 1869) and pluralism, and ensuring that curates were adequately remunerated. He also promoted church extension, not least through his own subscriptions; by his death no fewer than seventy-seven new parishes had been created in the diocese, while many new churches had been erected and others restored or rebuilt. Having early in his tenure visited the Isles of Scilly Phillpotts soon recognized that the geographical extent of the diocese presented a serious obstacle to effective supervision, and he became a strong advocate of its division. To this end he secured the preservation of the fifth canonry of the cathedral to provide an endowment for a new see, and bequeathed most of his books to form a nucleus for a diocesan library at Truro. Phillpotts also looked to the foundation of a diocesan theological college, and assigned for that purpose the money he had received from the <i>commendam</i> of Shobrooke (long held by the bishop of Exeter)&#151;some &pound;12,000 with an additional &pound;2000 of interest. The college was duly founded in 1861 under Charles John Ellicott, the dean, but closed in 1867. From 1878 the funds set aside were devoted to &#145;Phillpotts studentships&#146;, postgraduate scholarships at Oxford or Cambridge tenable on condition of being ordained to two years' work in the dioceses of Exeter or Truro. The theological college was in part designed to make the diocesan clerical community self-sustaining, an objective close to Phillpotts's heart: in 1831 he had observed that &#145;I wish to discourage the increasing practice of strangers coming hither&#151;so many of the clergy of this diocese &hellip; breed sons to the Church, that I do not like that their prospects be unnecessarily interfered with&#146;; curates who were admitted were expected to remain in post for at least two years.<h2>
<a name="AhighchurchcontroversialisttheGorhamcase"></a>A high-church controversialist: the Gorham case</h2>From the start, when in 1832 he was unjustly accused of fleeing his see city to escape the cholera, Phillpotts's career at Exeter was punctuated by a series of controversies, many of which ended up in the courts. After his death, his son estimated that he had expended some &pound;20,000&#150;30,000 on more than fifty lawsuits undertaken while bishop, and his will contained provision for the posthumous prosecution of an appeal against an action by a similarly deceased litigant. Some damaging disputes related to patronage: Phillpotts's exploitation of legal technicalities to wrest control of presentations served, with the number of relatives who received choice preferment (his son William John rose to be archdeacon of Cornwall), to support the accusation that he represented an archaic survival from the age of &#145;Old Corruption&#146;.<br>
<br>Even more controversial was Phillpotts's attempt to impose doctrinal orthodoxy and liturgical uniformity on his diocese. Uniformity in itself was sometimes the objective, as in an attempt in 1844 to eliminate a symbol of party difference by enforcing the rubrical requirement that a surplice be worn when preaching, abandoned in the face of popular disturbances, protest meetings, and open opposition from members of the cathedral chapter. But Phillpotts also sought to eliminate as far as possible the Calvinist element among his diocesan clergy, and repeatedly harassed or hauled before the ecclesiastical courts individuals he believed guilty of heresy or schism. Notable victims included William Malkin of St Ives, obliged to resign because his wife attended a dissenting chapel; William Beal, headmaster of Tavistock grammar school, refused ordination for preaching on the unity of the Church of England and nonconformity (though in 1833 Phillpotts had himself spoken of the possibility of reunion with all save Unitarians); and Henry Erskine Head of Feniton. The long and complex case of James Shore, who after harassment by Phillpotts attempted to secede from the church while continuing to officiate in his own chapel, ended with Shore incarcerated in debtors' prison and another spat with Latimer, who wrote in the <span class="italic">Western Times</span> (25 July 1848) that Phillpotts was &#145;everlastingly in hot water, but never clean withal&#146;. Phillpotts took out a bill for libel and defamation, but the grand jury accepted Latimer's defence of justification. On numerous occasions Phillpotts refused to license curates or institute incumbents on grounds of their heterodoxy&#151;William Haslam, for example, tricked into resigning his living in anticipation of preferment only to be told that Phillpotts could not license him again in view of his theology; it was typical of Phillpotts that immediately after practising this subterfuge he should invite Haslam to lunch.<br>
<br>Another instance led to the most important and famous of Phillpotts's disputes, following Lord Chancellor Cottenham's presentation of George Cornelius Gorham to Brampford Speke in 1847. Having already declined to countersign his testimonials, Phillpotts refused to institute Gorham after a 52-hour, eight-day <i>viva voce</i> and written examination of 149 questions which most importantly established that Gorham denied the doctrine of unconditional baptismal regeneration. Gorham appealed to the court of arches, where in 1849 Sir Herbert Jenner Fust found for the bishop, and then to the judicial committee of the privy council. In March 1850 the committee found for Gorham, only Blomfield dissenting from the judgment. The case had become a <i>cause c&eacute;l&egrave;bre</i>, rallying high-churchmen as much in protest at the nature of the court of appeal in which the doctrinal bounds of the Church of England would be settled as over the doctrinal issue itself; it led directly to the secession to Rome of several prominent Anglicans, including Phillpotts's chaplain William Maskell and friend Henry Manning. Others less sympathetic delighted at Phillpotts's come-uppance, Queen Victoria clapping with joy on hearing the news&#151;she hardly needed Lord Palmerston to warn her in 1860 that &#145;The theological learning of the Bishop of Exeter has caused much mischief to the Established Church&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters of Queen Victoria</span>, 3.530). In March 1850 Phillpotts himself protested in an outspoken public letter to Archbishop Sumner threatening to withhold communion from the metropolitan should he comply with the judgment; their enmity was confirmed in 1854 when Phillpotts censured the archbishop for his low view of the sacraments and the church. Phillpotts's other main response to the Gorham judgment was to summon a diocesan synod at Exeter in 1851, the first to be held in England since the seventeenth century, at which a resolution on baptism headed the agenda. The synod, however, was more than just a protest meeting. Also embracing two days of practical discussion of diocesan management and pastoralia, and a fierce protest at the &#145;papal aggression&#146;, it represented the culmination and convergence of fundamental theological, diocesan, and protestant constitutionalist strains in Phillpotts's thought.<br>
<br>Phillpotts's aggressive high-churchmanship led many opponents to identify him with the Oxford Movement. Phillpotts was close to both Manning and Pusey, and admitted the latter to preach in his diocese when suspended by Oxford University. In Plymouth, an evangelical stronghold, he also offered resolute and provocative backing for the ministry of George Rundle Prynne and the sisterhood established in 1848 by Priscilla Lydia Sellon. None the less, Phillpotts's support was always qualified in private, and often in public. As befitted the protestant champion of the 1820s, he was a fierce critic of what he regarded as romanizing tendencies in Tractarianism. He strongly denounced <span class="roman">Tract 90</span>, the use of Roman Catholic manuals of devotion, regular confession, the doctrine of reserve, and neglect of the doctrine of justification by faith. On numerous occasions Phillpotts acted against what he regarded as ritualist excesses or pastoral practices not authorized by the Anglican formularies, in 1847 physically sweeping ornaments from the altar of St John's, Torquay, during the Easter service before appointing a court of inquiry. Phillpotts's praise for Pusey's writings on the real presence suggests some advance on the receptionist understanding of the sacrament expounded in 1825 in the <span class="italic">Letters to Charles Butler</span>. However, more generally the <span class="italic">Letters</span>, reissued in 1866, remained a benchmark exposition of Phillpotts's theological position. He referred enquirers to the volume throughout his career, testimony that any development represented a modification rather than a repudiation of his position as an orthodox high-churchman, valuing the Church of England both for its protestantism and its catholicity.<h2>
<a name="Lastyears"></a>Last years</h2>In the years after the Exeter synod Phillpotts was increasingly incapacitated by old age and illness. He conducted his last visitation in 1862, and after a stroke in 1865 many diocesan duties were delegated to his son the archdeacon and to retired bishops. Samuel Wilberforce, visiting Phillpotts in 1867, found him &#145;in full force intellectually &hellip; very kind and full of hospitable courtesy. It is very striking to see the taming of the Old Lion&#146;  (Ashwell and Wilberforce, 3.235). On 9 September 1869 Phillpotts formally executed the resignation of his see, but before its completion he died on 18 September 1869 at his favoured residence at Bishopstowe, Torquay. He was buried at St Marychurch, Torquay.<br>
<br>Phillpotts was short of stature, and described by one commentator as possessing &#145;an intellectual, rather bulging forehead, restless twinkling eyes, a proud curving nose, and a rat-trap of a mouth whose corners drooped in line with a crescent of deep wrinkles extending from his nostrils to his chin&#146;  (Lambert, 35). The most memorable descriptions of Phillpotts's personality are exercises in equally unsparing character assassination. Most vicious was W. J. Conybeare's pen-portrait in the <span class="italic">Edinburgh Review</span> of 1852, depicting him as &#145;a shrewd and worldly churchman, violent by calculation, intemperate by policy, selfish in his ends, and unscrupulous in his means&#146;  (95.72); Trollope was equally unkind in the caricature masquerading as the second son of Archdeacon Grantly in <span class="italic">The Warden</span>. His reputation as a cold, litigious termagent was reinforced by his similarly unbending approach to spiritual counselling, severely discomforting the dying Eldon when, dismayed by the lord chancellor's complacency, he sternly called him to repentance. If family letters reveal a softer side, in public Phillpotts's attempts at charm too often appeared obsequious essays in careerist ingratiation: Gladstone described him on first meeting as &#145;a person of great conversational power, &amp; courtesy very finished but beyond my taste&#146;  (Gladstone, <span class="italic">Diaries</span>, 22 March 1833). Phillpotts was ambitious and, despite his explanations, contemporaries long remembered the about-turn on Catholic emancipation, the memory of which was perpetuated not least by Sydney Smith's <i>bon mot</i> that &#145;he must believe in the apostolic succession, because there is no other means of accounting for the descent of the Bishop of Exeter from Judas Iscariot&#146;  (Reid, 1.300). More perceptive critics, however, recognized his determination, intelligence, and adversarial ability, and the underlying consistency of his attempts to sustain his vision of an episcopal church in which the diocesan's authority was to be upheld not only against contumacious clergy but also interference (even archiepiscopal interference) from outside the diocese. As he told Peel in 1835, &#145;The <i>Government</i> of the Diocese ought to be in <i>one</i>&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 40411, fol. 165<i>v</i>).<br>
