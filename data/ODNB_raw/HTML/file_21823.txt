<span class="headword">Leigh,  Thomas  Pemberton</span>, Baron Kingsdown  (1793&#150;1867), <span class="occ">lawyer</span>, was born in London on 11 February 1793, the eldest son of Robert Pemberton (<i>d</i>. 1804), chancery barrister, and his wife, Margaret, eldest daughter and coheir of Edward Leigh of Bispham Hall, Lancashire. His father, a member of a family settled near Warrington in Lancashire, and a descendant of Sir Francis Pemberton, chief justice of the common pleas, died in 1804. Though he had earned a good income, he had been unable to save money, and his widow was left poorly off, considering the size of his family&#151;three sons and two daughters. Accordingly Thomas Pemberton, who had been for four years at Dr Horne's school at Chiswick to be prepared for Westminster and Oxford, was obliged to give up all hope of a university career, and, leaving Dr Horne's school at the age of sixteen, went into the office of a solicitor, Mr Farrer, for twelve months, and then became a pupil in the chambers of his uncle, Edward Cooke, a barrister in good chancery practice. He had been a studious and diligent boy, left school a fair scholar, and was throughout his life fond of classical studies. He earned &pound;100 to &pound;150 a year before being called to the bar by drawing equity pleadings, according to the practice of the day, for solicitors. He was called to the bar at Lincoln's Inn in 1816. His youth had been, as he called it, &#145;gloomy and joyless&#146;, but he had read diligently, and success came rapidly. He made the hitherto unprecedented sum of &pound;600 in his first year. Though he joined the northern circuit and occasionally appeared before parliamentary committees on election petitions, his practice was almost exclusively in equity. Before he was thirty his income was &pound;3000 a year. In 1829 he became a king's counsel, and divided with Bickersteth the practice of the rolls court, which, when Bickersteth became Lord Langdale, he entirely dominated. In April 1831 he entered parliament for Rye as a staunch Conservative, after an election at which great violence was displayed; he spoke with great effect against the <span class="roman">Reform Bill</span>, and afterwards published his speech. He lost the seat in 1832, began and abandoned a candidature for Taunton, and was elected in January 1835 for Ripon, a seat which he retained as long as he remained in parliament. He declined in December 1835 Sir Robert Peel's offer of the solicitor-generalship in his first administration, as well as Lord Lyndhurst's offer of a puisne judgeship. With characteristic diffidence he distrusted his judicial fitness, and preferred to remain undisputed leader of the chancery bar. Until 1838 he spoke little in the Commons, when he joined with Sugden, his colleague in the representation of Ripon, in resisting the privilege claim of the House of Commons in the case of <i>Stockdale v. <span class="italic">Hansard</span></i>, his best-known speech, supported by his pamphlet-letter to Lord Langdale (1837). He afterwards took a large share in the arrangements made for settling the matter by act of parliament. In 1841 the vice-chancellorship was offered him and refused, but he accepted from Sir Robert Peel in 1841 the post of attorney-general for the duchy of Cornwall.<br>
<br>In January 1843 Pemberton came into a life income of upwards of &pound;14,000 a year on the death of Sir Robert Holt Leigh, a distant relative and large Lancashire landowner, whose admiration he had won by successfully conducting a case for him in 1831. He then assumed the name of Leigh in addition to his father's surname, Pemberton, and took a step unusual among lawyers by deciding to retire in mid-career to his country seat, Torry Hill, near Sittingbourne, Kent, and to the country sports he loved. Sir Robert Peel made him thereon chancellor of the duchy of Cornwall and a privy councillor, and it was arranged that when he left the bar he should become one of the members of the judicial committee of the privy council. He resigned his seat for Ripon in the spring of 1843, and his practice at the bar at the end of that year.<br>
<br>In February 1844 Pemberton Leigh began attendances at the judicial committee of the privy council, which continued for twenty years. He also devoted considerable time to the affairs of the duchy of Cornwall, and thus became a close friend and admirer of Prince Albert. During his tenure of the chancellorship he succeeded in rehabilitating the finances of the duchy, and in accumulating a considerable fund during the minority of the prince of Wales. Honours were repeatedly offered to him and refused. It was expected that he would have been lord chancellor in 1849. Four successive governments, beginning with Lord John Russell's in 1853, offered him a peerage. Lord Derby pressed the lord chancellorship on him in vain, though it is said that he promised to take it if the interests of the Conservative Party, of which he remained a staunch supporter, imperatively demanded it.<br>
<br>Pemberton Leigh also spent much time on the judicial committee, which had been reorganized in 1833 but had not yet settled to its new role. He was an important influence in shaping that role. He was especially influential in imperial cases, becoming an authority on Indian land tenure on which subject he delivered many important judgments, as he also did on allied subjects such as succession rights and mortgages  (Simpson, 411). Following the decision in <i>Bremer v. Freeman</i> (1857), he promoted what became known as <span class="roman">Lord Kingsdown's Act</span>, which dealt with the wills of British subjects living abroad. He was a member of the committee when it pronounced on the Gorham case and the <span class="italic">Essays and Reviews</span> case, &#145;revealing himself to be against persecution and proscription within the Church of England&#146;  (ibid.). In 1854 Lord Aberdeen requested him to take especial charge of appeals in prize cases, and he uniformly interpreted the law of blockade, capture, and prize with a liberal bent towards freedom of trade. When created Baron Kingsdown in 1858 by the Conservative government he also became a member of the appellate tribunal of the House of Lords, and, though he never really approved of it as the ultimate court of appeal, was a much needed source of judicial strength there. In his later years indolence and distaste for judicial activity somewhat grew on him, and at length, after a lingering illness, he died at Torry Hill on 7 October 1867. He was unmarried, and his title became extinct. He was buried at Frinsted church, near Sittingbourne.<br>
<br>Kingsdown was much admired by his legal colleagues for his fastidious and elegantly drafted judgments. He was known as a pious member of the Church of England. His reputation survives in his speech in <i>Ramsden v. Dryson</i> (1866) on the concept which became known as proprietary estoppel, his dissenting judgment still being of relevance.<br>
