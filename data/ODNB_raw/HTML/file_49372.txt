<span class="headword">Herbert</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1164), <span class="occ">bishop of Glasgow</span>, was probably one of the first monks brought by Earl David from Tiron in France to found Selkirk Abbey about 1114, for he became its third abbot in 1119 and must have presided over its shift to Kelso about 1127. He failed in his hopes to become bishop of Durham when William Comyn was rejected there in 1142, but was elected to succeed John (another Tironensian monk) as bishop of Glasgow early in 1147. He was consecrated by Eugenius III at Auxerre on 24 August 1147, but during his episcopate ignored repeated papal injunctions to promise obedience to York. He is found witnessing royal charters, including no fewer than twenty-six of Malcolm IV.<br>
<br>Herbert certainly worked energetically for his cathedral, increasing the endowment of at least three of its prebends and adding a seventh to the existing six; named canons first appear in his time. His introduction of customs of Salisbury probably marked the formal constitution of the chapter as a <i>collegium</i>. He commissioned a life of Kentigern of which only the early chapters survive, but the preface shows that this work was an important recasting of an ancient life, and it was probably the main source for the life written after 1176 by Jocelin of Furness.<br>
<br>Perhaps in early 1164 Somerled so ravaged around Glasgow that its clergy and people fled. According to the <span class="italic">Carmen de morte Somerledi</span>, Herbert was absent, and Kentigern's failure to respond to his prayers led the bishop to disparage the saint. But Kentigern eventually awoke to his duty, persuading the bishop to leave his bed and set out for Glasgow without knowing that Somerled had returned. When he heard, and despite misgivings, Herbert rallied his forces and attacked Somerled at Renfrew, killing him and destroying his force.<blockquote>A priest cut off the head of the miserable leader Somerled, and gave it into the bishop's hands. As his custom was, he wept piously on seeing the head of his enemy, saying, &#145;the Scottish saints are truly to be praised&#146;. And he attributed the victory to the blessed Kentigern, whose memory keep ye always. (Anderson, <span class="italic">Early Sources</span>, 2.258)</blockquote>In the same year, 1164, Herbert died, at some time before 13 September and probably in Glasgow.<br>
<br>Herbert continued the work of his episcopal predecessor John, and these two are eloquent testimony to the effectiveness of monk-bishops in a rapidly developing church. Herbert's encouragement to the institutions of Glasgow Cathedral probably explain revived interest in the cult of Kentigern, which was perhaps popularized by the defeat and death of Somerled. It is difficult to believe that Herbert, now old, led the men of Glasgow; but he certainly seems to have inspired them.<br>
