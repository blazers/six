<span class="headword">Stokes,  Elizabeth</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1723&#150;1733), <span class="occ">pugilist and prize-fighter</span>, was probably a Londoner by birth; no early details of her life are known, but she was billed &#145;of the famous City of London&#146; and termed the &#145;City Championess&#146;  (<span class="italic">Weekly Journal</span>, 1 Oct 1726). A notable early leader in female stage combat for financial gain, she was one of the rare examples of a fighter of either sex who during the first half of the eighteenth century featured in confrontations using weapons (such as the back-sword and quarterstaff) as well as fists. Contrary to some beliefs, no protagonist was required to take part in both during the same contest, although boxing matches did occur occasionally on the undercard of the encounters with weapons. Overall, Stokes participated more in the latter, generally advertised as &#145;trials of skill&#146;, including competing with her husband, James (<i>fl</i>. 1716&#150;1738), against other couples. However, in these mixed paired trials the women seem to have fought only against each other and not against the men. Nevertheless, there is evidence that Stokes engaged in sword bouts with at least one male opponent, Edward Sutton's wife once refusing her challenge on the grounds that if &#145;she can conquer the Champion of Kent [the customary description of the renowned Sutton] at Flats, she must do the same to me at Sharps&#146;  (<span class="italic">Daily Advertiser</span>, 22 Aug 1733). Pugilistic contests, though, appear to have been without exception between members of the same sex and never involved mixed pairs, and in the City Championess's fistic battles she always seems to have been billed individually against another female.<br>
<br>Stokes may well have been the Elizabeth Wilkinson of Clerkenwell who fought a lengthy contest with Hannah Hyfield of Newgate Market in June 1722 in which both protagonists held a half-crown in each hand, the loser being the first to drop her money. The encounter, for 3 guineas, occurred at the Bear Garden, Hockley in the Hole, near Clerkenwell Green. In the summer of 1723 the City Championess was advertised to meet, in boxing battles, the similarly named Joanna Heyfield of Newgate Market (possibly the same person) on two occasions (the first was prevented by inclement weather and the second she won), and also a Billingsgate fish-woman, Martha Jones. She was, commented the <span class="italic">London Journal</span> soon afterwards, by now equal to any of her sex with her fists (as well as apparently with her vulgar tongue), and had gained the admiration of the mob attracted to such entertainments. In October the City Championess may have participated in her first major trial of skill, since in an advertisement for an engagement with Elizabeth Bedford she expressed her desire to show that &#145;I am as well qualify'd [<i>sic</i>] in the Noble Science of Defence as I am in the Art of Boxing&#146;. The weapons to be used were the back-sword, sword and dagger, sword and buckler, and quarterstaff  (<span class="italic">Daily Post</span>, 1 Oct 1723). These same weapons were also listed when she was billed with James Stokes against Sutton and a woman from Kent in August 1725 in an early example of the successful husband and wife pairing.<br>
<br>By 1726 Stokes was contesting at her husband's &#145;New Amphitheatre, in Islington Road, near Sadler's-Wells&#146;, being advertised with her opponent Mary Welch, in a trial of skill in the October, to fight in &#145;close Jackets, short Petticoats coming just below the Knee, Holland Drawers, white Stockings and Pumps&#146;  (<span class="italic">Daily Post</span>, 3 Oct 1726). When the two were billed to meet again in the same month Welch claimed to have been at least her celebrated opponent's equal in their recent encounter. During the next year Stokes's intended activities included three summer mixed paired engagements against Welch and her future husband Robert Barker, two with James, and the other with William Gill. In April 1728 Stokes was bold enough to challenge Welch (now Barker) and one Elizabeth Hughes to fight her on the same afternoon, both to be paid 5 guineas each should either gain a victory over her. This appears to have elicited no response, although Stokes, in the June and August, was certainly advertised to meet the former. These trials of skill were scheduled to be at her husband's establishment, the first event also to feature two of her scholars and the second to have a special gallery for women. At the end of 1728 the Stokes partnership was billed to compete against another experienced husband and wife, Thomas and Sarah Barret (Barrett). In that year, too, boxing matches were planned at James Stokes's amphitheatre between his spouse and an ass driver from Stoke Newington, Anne Field. One was cancelled because of poor weather and Field blamed her inferior performance in the rearranged event (when yet another was advertised) on several gentlemen having forced her to drink with them.<br>
<br>Trials of skill announced in 1729 and 1730 in which Stokes was to be teamed with her husband included those against Charles Wright and his scholar Mary Waller; Thomas and Sarah Barret; Joseph Paddon and the curiously named Engine Woman; Edward Sutton and a Kentish female he had tutored; and Felix Mac-Guire and a woman whom he had trained from infancy. By 1732 Stokes (now known as the European Championess) had fought, according to a notice for forthcoming attractions at her husband's amphitheatre, &#145;45 Stages, and never yet been conquered, the last before his Royal Highness the Duke of Lorrain&#146;  (<span class="italic">Daily Journal</span>, 12 June 1732). The next year appears to be the last in which Stokes was noticeably active. In an advertisement during that summer for what seems to have been her final appearance together with her husband (the Barrets again being the opponents), the pair claimed that they remained undefeated. Shortly afterwards Stokes was due to be partnered first by Sutton and then the Lancastrian Richard Banks against Richard Richbell and his wife, Martha, and Mac-Guire and his spouse, Letitia, respectively.<br>
<br>Besides her highly successful career as a fighter, Stokes appears to have assisted her husband by seconding him in some of his trials of skill, for Joseph Paddon once invited him to contest without any seconds, &#145;his Wife particularly excepted&#146;  (<span class="italic">Daily Journal</span>, 27 July 1730). Further details of her later life and death are unknown.<br>
