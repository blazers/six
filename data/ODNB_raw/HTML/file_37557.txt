<span class="headword">Hoechstetter,  Daniel</span>  (1525&#150;1581), <span class="occ">mining promoter</span>, was born in Augsburg, Germany, the second son of the twenty-year-old Joachim Hoechstetter and his wife, Anna, daughter of Eitelhans Langenmantel, patrician and Anabaptist. Joachim died, probably in Denmark, in 1535. At some time before 1541 his relatives placed Daniel Hoechstetter with a branch of his grandmother's Wieland family, who trained him at their lead, copper, and silver mines and smelting works in the Rauris and Gastein valleys in the Tyrol, part of the archbishopric of Salzburg. He was apparently fully trained by 1549 and began to operate independently. On 16 July 1553 he married, in Augsburg, the twenty-year-old Radagunda, daughter of the prominent Augsburg merchant Leonhard Stammler. They had five sons and five daughters, of whom three sons and four daughters survived infancy. Between December 1555 and January 1557 he returned to live in Augsburg with his growing family.<br>
<br>Nothing is known about Hoechstetter's activities until he was authorized, by Elizabeth I's signet of 8 July 1563, to prospect for minerals in England, which he did during that summer. For reasons which can only be guessed at, he decided to establish himself near Keswick in Cumberland and returned in the following year with Hans Loner, a relative by marriage, and twelve German workers, to set up works and to prospect more fully. In 1564 he also concluded an agreement with the Augsburg firm of Haug, Langnauer &amp; Co. to finance the enterprise with himself as manager, and to invite English participation. By 1568 they were incorporated as one of the first two English joint-stock companies, the Society of the Mines Royal, with some important royal servants and London merchants as members. The English partners became increasingly reluctant to supplement their original investment of &pound;1200 per share and finally refused in 1580, and agreed to lease the works and mines to Hoechstetter and &#145;customer&#146; Thomas Smith, one of the wealthiest London merchants.<br>
<br>Hoechstetter had meanwhile built up the works, from a large smelter in three storeys to coal-sheds, workshops, a stamp mill, and housing in Brigham, almost a mile east of Keswick on the River Greta. They produced fair quantities of copper and a little silver but, with a declining market for copper, could not cover the costs of installations and the travelling expenses of almost 150 Austrian and German craftsmen, a total which amounted to about &pound;50,000. The lease from 1580 worked well enough to provide some regular rent for the society, even after Hoechstetter's death just before 14 May 1581, when he was buried in Crosthwaite church. Radagunda was buried next to her husband in 1610.<br>
<br>On fragmentary evidence, Hoechstetter impresses as a reasonable and well-educated man, with a typical prospector's irrepressible enthusiasms. At first two of his sons, Emanuel (who died on 22 August 1614) with Daniel Hechstetter (as the English descendants called themselves), and then Daniel with Emanuel's son Joseph, continued, more modestly and successfully, to operate the works and mines until about 1634, when they went bankrupt.<br>
