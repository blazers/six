<span class="headword">Stubs,  Peter</span>  (1756&#150;1806), <span class="occ">toolmaker and innkeeper</span>, was born on 15 June 1756 at the White Bear inn, Bridge Street, Warrington, Lancashire, the only child of John Stubs (1736&#150;1757), a currier, of Warrington, and his wife, Mary, daughter of Peter Johnson, yeoman, of Orford, near Warrington. In the second half of the eighteenth century south-west Lancashire was renowned as an area of small metal trades. If these trades had a centre, it was probably Warrington, and it was here that, as a very young man, Stubs established a small workshop as a filesmith. In 1777 he married Mary (1758&#150;1821), daughter of Thomas Sutton of Warrington.<br>
<br>By 1788 Stubs had acquired the tenancy of the White Bear inn, where the file-making business was continued upon an expanded scale. The combination of innkeeping and file making was not wholly accidental, for the dregs of the beer barrels were utilized to form a paste which, when spread into the teeth of the files, gave them greater durability and strength. In 1802 Stubs set up new workshops and warehouses in Scotland Road, Warrington, and it was with this particular manufactory that the legendary quality of his files became most closely identified. Files with the initials P. S. stamped on their heel became treasured among craftsmen: it was not just the superiority of the steel from which they were made, but the perfection with which they were cut and finished. Many orders came to him through personal recommendation and by the 1780s his files were being sold as far afield as London. Later they were finding markets with wholesalers and ironmongers in towns and cities up and down the country. They were also being sold in America. Invariably, though, it was the machine workers of Lancashire and other centres of the industrial revolution who were Stubs's largest customers, for machine making was still then largely a manual rather than a mechanical process. The high standard of his product was vividly attested by the way the P. S. stamp was illegally used by other filesmiths, particularly in Sheffield. Indeed, so serious did this counterfeiting problem become that Stubs was forced to publish a caution to filesmiths in a Sheffield newspaper in 1805. By the early nineteenth century, Stubs's annual profits were estimated at &pound;700, no mean figure by the standards of the day. Alongside his business as an innkeeper and in brewing, he acquired property in Warrington and in 1799 became part owner of a vessel plying the Baltic trade. He was the father of eighteen children and was generous in his dealings with them. He was also given to generous support and hospitality more widely and hence was some way removed from the austere nonconformity which characterized some of his industrialist contemporaries. He died at his home on 28 February 1806 and was buried in Warrington parish churchyard. He was survived by his wife and thirteen of his children.<br>
<br>What is known about Stubs as an industrialist derives from the continuity of the firm he founded for well over a century after his own death and from the concomitant survival of a mass of records relating to it. This archive subsequently came to the notice of T. S. Ashton, who recognized it as affording a unique insight into the trades which supplied the tools of the machine age. What Ashton saw was an industrial sector in transition. In the first decade or so of the firm's existence Stubs was as much merchant as industrialist in that he relied quite heavily on outworkers who combined their craft with farming. As time went by, however, he increasingly gave direct employment to filesmiths and sought ways to induce outworkers to move to Warrington. In the marketing of his product he initially used factors or middlemen. He also capitalized on trading contacts arising from his need for steel castings from which to make files and also for the supply of barley for malt for his brewing business. Later, though, middlemen were more and more replaced by direct dealing with retailers, assisted by the firm's own travellers, of whom Peter's son John became one. The measure of Ashton's insight into this single, small firm owed much to the survival of the correspondence records with the firm's clients and suppliers.<br>
