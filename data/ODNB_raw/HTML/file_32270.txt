<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Campbell,  Lewis</span>  (1830&#150;1908), <span class="occ">classical scholar</span>, was born on 3 September 1830 at Howard Place, Edinburgh, the elder son of Captain Robert Campbell RN, who was related to the Campbells of Kirnan, Argyll, and his wife, Eliza Constantia, eldest daughter of Richard Pryce of Gunley, Montgomeryshire. His father died in 1832 and in 1844 his mother married her second husband, Colonel Morrieson. Campbell was educated at Edinburgh Academy, where he was a close friend of the physicist James Clerk Maxwell, and at Glasgow University (1846&#150;9), where he was taught Latin by William Ramsay and Greek by Edward Lushington. Campbell then went to Oxford in 1849, taking up, in preference to a scholarship at Trinity, the Snell exhibition from Glasgow, tenable at Balliol College. There he met Benjamin Jowett, who was to be the major influence on his life and his work both in theology and philosophy. After graduating with first-class honours in classics Campbell spent a brief period (1856&#150;8) as fellow and tutor at Queen's College. He resigned his fellowship on his marriage on 11 May 1858 to Frances Pitt (Fanny), daughter of Thomas Andrews, serjeant-at-law.<br>
<br>Campbell was ordained deacon in 1857 and priest in 1858, spending five years of active ministry as vicar of Milford, Hampshire, a Queen's College living. In 1863 he was appointed professor of Greek at the University of St Andrews in succession to William Young Sellar who became professor of humanity at Edinburgh University. In 1875 he was an unsuccessful candidate for the Greek chair at Glasgow, to which Richard Claverhouse Jebb, ten years his junior, was appointed. The honorary LLD Campbell received from Glasgow in 1875 must have seemed a poor consolation. Then student numbers at St Andrews declined alarmingly, until in 1876 there were a mere 130 students in the entire university, which was threatened with extinction. When the <span class="roman">Universities (Scotland) Act</span> of 1889 addressed the situation, certain of its new provisions were perceived by Campbell as inimical to his subject and to academic standards. After a prolonged period of ill health in 1891&#150;2, he resigned his chair. The Campbells soon made Alassio on the Italian riviera their winter home. Campbell's years of retirement were marked by further honours (including DLitt Oxon. in 1903) and continued professional activity, from the Gifford lectures at St Andrews in 1894&#150;5 (published in 1898 as <span class="italic">Religion in Greek Literature</span>) to a lecture delivered shortly before his death entitled <span class="italic">The Religious Element in Plato</span> to a Congress of Religions at Oxford in September 1908.<br>
<br>Campbell had been appointed to the chair at St Andrews in recognition of his work on Plato, and for some time he continued to concentrate on Plato's philosophy: his <span class="italic">Theaetetus</span> of 1861 went into a second edition in 1883; in 1867 his edition of the <span class="italic">Sophistes</span> and <span class="italic">Politicus</span> appeared (dedicated to the senatus of the university); and in 1894 he edited the <span class="italic">Republic</span> with Jowett. Campbell pioneered the application of stylometry, a sophisticated examination of vocabulary, grammar, and sentence structure, to the question of Plato's chronological development. This innovatory and imaginative work was little appreciated at the time and continental scholars, failing to observe Campbell's results, later received more credit for proceeding on similar lines.<br>
<br>The second area in which Campbell made a lasting contribution to scholarship was tragedy, especially Sophocles. His edition of Sophocles came out in two volumes, the first (<span class="italic">Oedipus tyrannus</span>, <span class="italic">Oedipus Coloneus</span>, <span class="italic">Antigone</span>), with a fulsome tribute to Jowett, in 1871, with a second edition in 1879; and the second in 1881. Jebb's celebrated Sophocles, which came to overshadow Campbell's, was not begun until 1880, the first part appearing in 1883. Campbell's insights on language (especially in the long &#145;Essay on the language of Sophocles&#146;, prefaced to his first volume), on lyric metre, on the textual tradition, and on dramatic and staging questions are particularly valuable. Campbell's third main scholarly enterprise was again original in conception: verse translation allied with comparative literature. He published translations of Sophocles (1883) and of Aeschylus (1890) in blank verse and lyric metres, and also a <span class="italic">Guide to Greek Tragedy</span> (1891), and a comparative work on tragic method, <span class="italic">Tragic Drama in Aeschylus, Sophocles and Shakespeare</span> (1904). Gilbert Murray followed Campbell's translations of Aeschylus and Sophocles with translations of Euripides which were staged and much more widely read, despite being less economical and less faithful to sense and metrical structure. Campbell's more general work included a volume on Plato's <span class="italic">Republic</span> for the <span class="roman">Home and School Library</span> (1902); and one on Sophocles (1897) for the <span class="roman">Classical Writers</span> series.<br>
<br>Campbell remained a lifelong proponent of liberal ecumenical views, expressed not only in sermons, such as those collected in <span class="italic">The Christian Ideal</span> (1877), but also in correspondence, lectures, and essays. His <span class="italic">On the Nationalisation of the Old English Universities</span> (1901) was a restatement of the liberal cause of freeing the ancient universities from denominational restrictions. Loyalty to his early associates was apparent in his extensive biographical and editorial work: with William Garnett he produced a life of Clerk Maxwell (1882); with Evelyn Abbott the biography of Jowett (1897) and editions of his writings and correspondence (1899); extracts from Jowett's work on Plato (1902) and his theological essays (1906); and editions of the poems of his father's cousin Thomas Campbell (1904).<br>
<br>Campbell's unassuming character comes over in much of his work, especially his replies to Jebb in <span class="italic">Paralipomena Sophoclea</span> (1907). He is described by his younger contemporary John Burnet as sensitive, nervous, and excitable  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>). His lifestyle was mildly bohemian; he founded the students' Shakespearian society, dramatic society, and gymnastic club; and himself participated in their activities. He was an advocate of higher education for women and was closely involved in the foundation of St Leonard's School for Girls, being chairman of the school council from 1886 to 1903. Campbell died at Brissago, Lake Maggiore, near Locarno, Switzerland, on the return journey from Oxford to his home at Alassio, on 25 October 1908. He was survived by his wife; they had no children. There are memorial tablets at the English cemetery, Locarno, where he was buried, and at St John's Church, Alassio, and the chapels of St Andrews and Balliol.<br>
