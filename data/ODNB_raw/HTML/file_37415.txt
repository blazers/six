<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Firbank,  (Arthur Annesley) Ronald</span>  (1886&#150;1926), <span class="occ">novelist</span>, was born on 17 January 1886 at 40 Clarges Street, Mayfair, London, the second of the three sons and the four children of Sir Joseph Thomas Firbank (1850&#150;1910) of London, railway contractor and later Unionist MP for East Hull, and his wife, Harriette Jane Garrett (1851&#150;1924), daughter of James Perkins Garrett, rector of Kellistown, co. Carlow, Ireland. His paternal grandfather was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9479/', "Joseph Firbank (1819&#150;1886)")</script>, a railway contractor. Firbank spent the first ten years of his life at his family's new home, The Coopers, Chislehurst, Kent&#151;a village whose connections with the exiled French empress Eug&eacute;nie may have initiated his enduring fascination with both royalty and Catholicism. In May 1900 he was sent to Uppingham School in Rutland, where, suffering from ill health, he stayed only two terms. Subsequent private tuition was taken in England, France, and Spain in 1901&#150;6. His first book, containing two stories, &#145;Odette d'Antrevernes&#146; and &#145;A Study in Temperament&#146;, was published in 1905; it shows very clearly the influence of Oscar Wilde, and Wilde's presence, as stylist, aesthete, and homosexual martyr, can be felt in different ways throughout Firbank's writing life. The following summer he was at work on his first novel, <span class="italic">The Artificial Princess</span> (published posthumously in 1934): in it he devised the techniques of elliptical narrative and baroque construction, and the manner, at once satirical and lyric, concentrated and fragmentary, that were to characterize his mature work.<br>
<br>In October 1906 Firbank went to Trinity Hall, Cambridge, and left in March 1909, having taken no examinations; on 6 December 1907 he had been received into the Roman Catholic church by R. Hugh Benson. In October 1909 he went to Rome, where he hoped, but failed, to join the Guardia nobile, and he remained in Italy until October 1910, when his father died and he assumed control of the family's finances. Over the following four years he cultivated the nomadic way of life which, with the exception of the war years, was to be his until he died: he drifted restlessly in southern Europe and north Africa&#151;and when in London was seen at the theatre, the Ballets Russes, the Caf&eacute; Royal, and at the bohemian restaurant La Tour Eiffel. He was known for the refined dandyism of his appearance, the flutterings and oscillations of his bearing, his heavy drinking, and his extreme shyness. He was vain of his looks, as is attested by his use of portrait drawings by Augustus John, Wyndham Lewis, and Charles Shannon as frontispieces or on the jackets of his later books. The body of anecdote with which a generation recorded him emphasizes the eccentric refinement and oblique humour of someone too nervous and solitary to be knowable.<br>
<br>With the appearance of his novel <span class="italic">Vainglory</span> in 1915 he styled himself Ronald Firbank for the first time, signalling the emergence of the mature writer. Like all his books until <span class="italic">Prancing Nigger</span> (1924), it was published at his own expense and to negligible acclaim. An unorthodox social comedy set in an English cathedral town, it was also the most experimental modernist novel yet published in England, and its abstruseness was found additionally baffling in the context of the war. Being unfit for service, and to escape the danger of bombing, he moved to rooms at 66 High Street, Oxford, in November 1915, and remained there until September 1919. This was a period of intense isolation, in which he sank into nervous apprehensiveness and paranoia. But it was also a period of remarkable creativity, in which he wrote his novels <span class="italic">Inclinations</span> (1916), <span class="italic">Caprice</span> (1917), and <span class="italic">Valmouth</span> (1919). He showed an exceptional and sustaining dedication to his art in the face of personal loneliness and critical indifference; it was only after his death that he emerged as a vital influence on writers of the generation of Evelyn Waugh, W. H. Auden, and Anthony Powell, who admired the unprecedented economy, Carrollian fantasy, and absurdist comedy of manners which coexist in his work.<br>
<br>Firbank had no close emotional attachments, save with his mother; but in 1919 he seems to have become infatuated with the Hon. Evan Morgan, who rebuffed him by refusing the dedication of his only play, <span class="italic">The Princess Zoubaroff</span>, days before its publication in 1920. After this Firbank resumed his nomadism, and the settings of his books, too, were henceforth to be fantastic versions of foreign places: Vienna, Havana, Seville. His north African tale <span class="italic">Santal</span> appeared in 1921, and <span class="italic">The Flower beneath the Foot</span>, the first of the three major novels of his last years, in 1923. This book shows a new satirical vigour and contempt for British society, at a time when the American writer Carl Van Vechten had begun to promote Firbank's work in the United States. His next novel, <span class="italic">Prancing Nigger</span> (1924), was published first with considerable success in New York and then in London under the author's preferred title of <span class="italic">Sorrow in Sunlight</span>. American editions of <span class="italic">The Flower beneath the Foot</span> and <span class="italic">Vainglory</span> followed, but Brentano declined <span class="italic">Concerning the Eccentricities of Cardinal Pirelli</span> (1926) on religious and moral grounds: Firbank's work after the death of his mother in March 1924 showed a new candour in its treatment of homosexuality. He was working on a novel set in New York, <span class="italic">The New Rythum</span> (fragments published in 1962), when he died at the Hotel Quirinale in Rome on 21 May 1926. He was mistakenly buried in the protestant cemetery in Testaccio, Rome on 1 June, and reinterred in the campo Verano in that city in September.<br>
