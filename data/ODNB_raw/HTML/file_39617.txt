<span class="headword">Mackintosh,  Robert</span>  (1858&#150;1933), <span class="occ">Congregational minister and theologian</span>, was born on 23 May 1858 at Dunoon, Argyll, one of seven children of the evangelical Calvinist Charles Calder Mackintosh (1806&#150;1868) and his wife, Annie, second daughter of Robert Brown of Fairlie, Ayrshire. His father was Free Church of Scotland minister at Dunoon. Following her husband's death his mother moved with the family to Glasgow, where they came under the influence of Alexander Whyte, then assistant minister of Free St John's, and later of Free St George's, Edinburgh, with which church the Mackintoshes subsequently became associated.<br>
<br>Mackintosh won a scholarship to Oxford, but his mother persuaded him not to take it up. Instead he went to Glasgow University (1872&#150;7), where he graduated with first-class honours in philosophy and second-class honours in classics. Of all his teachers Edward Caird impressed him most, though he subsequently found cause first to repudiate and later to modify his teacher's idealism. Theological studies at New College, Edinburgh, followed, and the family moved to Edinburgh. Whyte was very supportive of Mackintosh, who was already reading Erskine of Linlathen and struggling with such doctrinal issues as the eternity of punishment, which assailed his conscience but was affirmed in his church's Westminster confession. Of his theological teachers A. B. Davidson was the most inspiring, while he later dismissed James MacGregor, professor of doctrine, as an arch-Calvinist.<br>
<br>On graduating BD, Mackintosh pursued further studies in Jena and Marburg and then, during a missionary assistantship to Dr Walter Smith at Edinburgh, he contracted scarlet fever. A recuperative trip to New Zealand followed, during which Mackintosh worked on his first book, <span class="italic">Christ and the Jewish Law</span> (1886). He visited the south of France and Palestine, all the while &#145;fighting for life as a Christian, and for liberty as a preacher from the fetters of a seventeenth-century creed&#146;  (<span class="italic">Christianity and Sin</span>, 1917, 107). He supported Robert Rainy's campaign for a declaratory act, designed to clarify the free church's relation to the Westminster confession of faith; but this alone did not suffice to ease his distaste for the confession. On the other hand he drew small comfort from the emotional revivalism which was becoming popular at the time (though he later said that he owed his conversion to Dwight Lyman Moody and Ira David Sankey). Hence his provocatively entitled pamphlets, <span class="italic">The Obsoleteness of the Westminster Confession of Faith</span> and <span class="italic">The Insufficiency of Revivalism as a Religious System</span>. These were bound with his <span class="italic">Essays towards a New Theology</span> (1889), his other themes being &#145;The atonement morally viewed&#146;, &#145;The biblical doctrines of judgment and immortality&#146;, &#145;Internal evidence for the truth of holy scripture&#146;, and &#145;The Calvinist conception of grace&#146;. Far from being mere academic exercises, here was Mackintosh struggling to come to terms with topics which had tormented him for years. In the year in which this book appeared, Mackintosh was awarded the degree of DD by Glasgow University.<br>
<br>In the same year Mackintosh went to Withington Presbyterian Church, Manchester, as assistant to Benjamin Bell. His sojourn was brief, for on 11 December 1890 he was ordained and inducted to the pastorate of Dumfries Congregational Church. Mackintosh later said that he came to Congregationalism as a refugee from narrow Calvinistic confessionalism. While at Dumfries, on 22 May 1894 he married Mary Wilson Robb (1871&#150;1924), daughter of James Henderson Robb, a trader of that town. They had four daughters and two sons. One of the latter was stillborn; the other, to his father's bewilderment, became a priest of the Church of England.<br>
<br>In 1894 Mackintosh was called to be professor at Lancashire Independent college, Manchester, and thus began the family's long association with Withington Congregational Church. Mackintosh served under four principals: Caleb Scott, W. F. Adeney, W. H. Bennett&#151;for whom he had a particular affection&#151;and A. J. Grieve, the last of whom delivered Mackintosh's funeral oration; in it he expressed his great respect for his colleague's saintliness and scholarship, while noting that where teaching was concerned, &#145;his gifts were not of the &#147;popular&#148; order&#146;&#151;though there is evidence that Mackintosh's children's addresses in church were well received.<br>
<br>Mackintosh's teaching duties were at first weighted towards philosophy and sociology, and later towards theology, and this is borne out by the progression of his books: <span class="italic">From Comte to Benjamin Kidd</span> (1899), <span class="italic">A First Primer of Apologetics</span> (1900; 2nd edn, 1904), <span class="italic">Hegel and Hegelianism</span> (1903), <span class="italic">Christian Ethics</span> (1909), <span class="italic">Christianity and Sin</span> (1913), <span class="italic">Albrecht Ritschl and his School</span> (1915), <span class="italic">Historic Theories of Atonement</span> (1920), <span class="italic">Values</span> (1928), and, after his retirement, <span class="italic">Some Central Things</span> (1932). Away from his main academic lines were a biography, <span class="italic">Principal Rainy</span> (1907), and a commentary, <span class="italic">Thessalonians and Corinthians</span> (1909) in the <span class="roman">Westminster New Testament</span> series. He also contributed biblical papers to <span class="italic">The Expositor</span>, and &#145;Galatians&#146; to A. S. Peake's <span class="italic">A Commentary on the Bible</span> (1919). He wrote substantial articles&#151;&#145;Apologetics&#146;, &#145;Theism&#146;, and &#145;Theology&#146; among them&#151;for the eleventh edition of <span class="italic">Encyclopaedia Britannica</span>, and a shorter piece on apologetics for its successor edition. He contributed articles and reviews to a number of other journals.<br>
<br>A lecturer in the faculty of theology of the University of Manchester from its inception in 1904, Mackintosh owed his appointment, as he thought, to the professor of philosophy, Samuel Alexander. In 1908 Mackintosh presented a &#145;masterly&#146; paper at the International Congregational Council (ICC) meeting in Edinburgh which &#145;paralyzed, overpowered&#146; some of the able representatives  (<span class="italic">Proceedings of the International Congregational Council</span>, 1908, 124). In 1918 he chaired the Lancashire Congregational Union and in 1920, in the absence through ill health of P. T. Forsyth, he presented the report &#145;The contribution of British Congregationalism to religious thought&#146; at the ICC assembly in Boston, USA. In 1924 he attended the Conference on Politics, Economics and Citizenship in Birmingham. Mackintosh retired in June 1930 and moved to Whaley Bridge. In 1933 he suffered a heart attack and died on 12 February at 22 York Place, Chorlton upon Medlock, Manchester. The funeral service was held three days later at Lancashire Independent college, followed by interment at Taxal churchyard.<br>
<br>Mackintosh was a man of utter integrity. Regarded by some as austere, even aloof, he was capable of great kindness and, for all his scholarship, had a childlike simplicity. He loved music, enjoyed singing, loathed gardening. With his pointed humour expressed in memorable sentences he could slay intellectual giants, but he had every sympathy with those who faced the trial of faith as he had done. His own words constitute his most appropriate epitaph: &#145;For one's own part, one would thankfully spend one's whole life till one was spent out, for the privilege of removing a single obstacle from the path of hearts that are seeking God&#146;  (<span class="italic">Albrecht Ritschl and his School</span>, 4).<br>
