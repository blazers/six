<span class="headword">Neville,  (Thomas) Henry Gartside</span>  (1837&#150;1910), <span class="occ">actor</span>, was born at Manchester on 20 June 1837. He was the son of John Neville (1787&#150;1874), the manager of the Queen's Theatre, Spring Gardens, and his second wife, Marianne, the daughter of Captain Gartside of Woodbrow, Saddleworth, Yorkshire. He was the twentieth child of a twentieth child, both being the issue of a second marriage. A brother, George, was also an actor.<br>
<br>At the age of three Neville was brought on the stage in his father's arms as the child in <span class="italic">Pizarro</span>. He forfeited all help from his father by refusing to join the army like other members of the family, and in 1857, at Preston, under Edmund Falconer, he took to the stage as a profession. When John Vandenhoff made his farewell performance on 29 October 1858, at the Theatre Royal, Liverpool, Neville played Cromwell to the tragedian's Cardinal Wolsey in <span class="italic">King Henry VIII</span>. Following a stern noviciate in the north of England and in Scotland, he made his d&eacute;but in London at the Lyceum Theatre, under Madame Celeste, on 8 October 1860, as Percy Ardent in a revival of Boucicault's <span class="italic">The Irish Heiress</span>. After further provincial engagements he spent four years at the Olympic under Robson and Emden (1862&#150;6). The experience proved the turning point in his career. In May 1863 he was the original Bob Brierley in Tom Taylor's <span class="italic">The Ticket-of-Leave Man</span>, a character in which he made the success of his life. He played it in all some 2000 times. In May 1864, while Taylor's play was still running, Neville also appeared as Petruchio in the afterpiece <span class="italic">Catherine and Petruchio</span>, and was highly praised for his speaking of blank verse. In October 1866 he was the first professional to take the part of Richard Wardour in Wilkie Collins's <span class="italic">The Frozen Deep</span>, a character originally performed by Charles Dickens.<br>
<br>Neville's impassioned and romantic style of acting, which gave a character to the Olympic productions, contrasted with the over-charged, highly coloured style then current at the Adelphi. But early in 1867 he migrated to the Adelphi, where he was the original Job Armroyd in Watts Phillips's <span class="italic">Lost in London</span> and the original Farmer Allen in Charles Reade's version of Tennyson's <span class="italic">Dora</span>. In August 1867, on Kate Terry's farewell, he played Romeo to her Juliet, and the following December he was the original George Vendale in Dickens and Collins's <span class="italic">No Thoroughfare</span>. In November 1868 <span class="italic">The Yellow Passport</span>, Neville's own version of Victor Hugo's <span class="italic">Les mis&eacute;rables</span>, was produced at the Olympic with himself as Jean Valjean. At the Gaiety in 1869 he played an important role in W. S. Gilbert's first comedy, <span class="italic">An Old Score</span>.<br>
<br>From 1873 to 1879 Neville was lessee and manager of the Olympic Theatre. After experiencing failure in 1873 with H. J. Byron's comedy <span class="italic">Sour Grapes</span> and James Mortimer's <span class="italic">The School for Intrigue</span>, he scored numerous successes through his acting of Lord Clancarty in Taylor's <span class="italic">Lady Clancarty</span> and with John Oxenford's <span class="italic">The Two Orphans</span> in 1874, and also in the part of Franklin Blake in Wilkie Collins's <span class="italic">The Moonstone</span> in 1877. From 1879 he played for two years at the Adelphi, opening there as Perrinet Leclerc in Clement Scott and E. Mavriel's <span class="italic">The Crimson Cross</span>. He proved a popular Charles Surface in a successful revival of <span class="italic">The School for Scandal</span> at the Vaudeville in February 1882. A little later he was supporting Madame Modjeska in the provinces as the Earl of Leicester in Lewis Wingfield's <span class="italic">Mary Stuart</span> and as Jaques in <span class="italic">As You Like It</span>.<br>
<br>Thereafter Neville confined himself chiefly to playing romantic heroes in melodrama. In September 1885 he was the original Captain Temple in Pettitt and Harris's <span class="italic">Human Nature</span> at Drury Lane, and after playing in many similar pieces he went to America in 1890 with Sir Augustus Harris's company to appear as Captain Temple. He opened at the Boston Theatre and performed in the role for 200 nights (the play had been renamed <span class="italic">The Soudan</span>). He was in London again at the Princess's in 1892. During the succeeding fourteen years he continued, with occasional interruptions, to originate prominent characters in the autumn melodramas at Drury Lane. His last appearance on the stage was at His Majesty's at a matin&eacute;e on 29 April 1910, when he played Sir Oliver in Sir Herbert Beerbohm Tree's revival of <span class="italic">The School for Scandal</span>, which was also the last great engagement of Lionel Brough and Hermann Vezin.<br>
<br>Neville's art reflected his buoyant, breezy nature and his generous mind. He believed that the principles of acting could be taught, and in 1878 established a dramatic studio in Oxford Street, in whose fortunes he continued to take an interest for many years. In 1875 he published a pamphlet giving the substance of a lecture on <span class="italic">The Stage, its Past and Present in Relation to Fine Art</span>, which was later published as a book. He also wrote half a dozen plays, including <span class="italic">The Violin-Maker</span>, <span class="italic">The Duke's Device</span>, and <span class="italic">The Great Metropolis</span>, the last in collaboration with William Terriss.<br>
<br>Although he lived for the theatre, Neville was a man of varied accomplishments. He was a prominent freemason. He painted, carved, and modelled, took a keen interest in sport, and was a volunteer and crack rifle shot. He was also a man of sound business capacity, and long managed the George Hotel at Reading. He was a freeholder in Berkshire, Lancashire, Kent, and Middlesex.<br>
<br>Neville died at 4 Esplanade, Seaford, Sussex, on 19 June 1910, from heart failure as the result of an accident, and was buried at Denshaw, Saddleworth, Yorkshire. He was survived by the four sons from his marriage to Henrietta Waddell.<br>
