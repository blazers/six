<span class="headword">Rhodes,  Francis William</span>  (1851&#150;1905), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was the second son of Francis William Rhodes (1806&#150;1878), a Church of England clergyman, and his second wife, Louisa, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Peacock (<i>d</i>. 1873); <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35731/', "Cecil John Rhodes")</script> was his younger brother. He was born on 9 April 1851 at Thorleybourne, Bishop's Stortford. After attending Goodman's High School in Bishop's Stortford, in 1865 he entered Eton College, where he was in the army class and in the cricket elevens of 1869 and 1870. After passing through Sandhurst he was gazetted lieutenant of the 1st (Royal) Dragoons in April 1873. He saw service in the Sudan as a member of the staff in 1884, and was present at the battles of al-Teb and Tamai. He was mentioned in dispatches, received the medal with clasp and bronze star, and was promoted captain in October 1884. He accompanied the Nile expedition in 1884&#150;5 for the relief of Khartoum as aide-de-camp to General Herbert Stewart, and distinguished himself at the battles of Abu Klea and al-Gubba, where his horse was shot under him. He was mentioned in dispatches and received two clasps and the brevet of major and lieutenant-colonel (September 1885). Stewart described him as the best aide-de-camp a general could have.<br>
<br>Rhodes next served in the Sudan expedition of 1888, and was present at the action of Gamaiza (Jummaiza) (20 December); he was again mentioned in dispatches, and received the clasp and the order of the Mejidiye (3rd class). He was made colonel in September 1889. From 1890 to 1893 he was military secretary to his old schoolfellow Lord Harris, governor of Bombay; he received the DSO in 1891, and in 1893, as a result of his brother Cecil's importunity, was chief of staff to Sir Gerald Herbert Portal's mission to Uganda. There he nearly succumbed to blackwater fever.<br>
<br>After his recovery Rhodes went out in 1894 to the recently conquered Matabeleland in Southern Rhodesia which had come under the control of Cecil's British South Africa Company over the previous five years. There he joined Dr L. S. Jameson's military council of four which was responsible for expropriating Ndebele (Matabele) land and cattle on a vast scale, a major factor in the Ndebele uprising of 1896. In the following year he went to Johannesburg, ostensibly as representative of the Consolidated Goldfields, of which his brother was a director but in fact to mobilize the Uitlanders against the South African Republic. In September 1895 he was at Ramoutsa negotiating on behalf of his brother for the cession of Tswana territory close to the Transvaal border, which soon came under the jurisdiction of the British South Africa Company and was used as the jumping-off point for Jameson's ill-fated raid against the republic at the end of 1895. As a leading member of the Johannesburg reform movement agitating for Uitlander rights he was one of the five signatories of the undated letter (November 1895) to Jameson which ostensibly led to the invasion of the Transvaal. On the failure of the raid he was arrested by the republican government, tried for high treason, and sentenced to death (April 1896). The sentence was soon commuted to fifteen years' imprisonment. After being in prison in Pretoria until June, Rhodes and his companions were released, on payment by Cecil of a fine of &pound;25,000 each and on their promising to abstain from politics for fifteen years. Of all the ringleaders, Rhodes was the only one to refuse to accept this condition, and he was banished from the Transvaal. For his encouragement of the raid, Rhodes was placed on the army retired list. Early in July he joined Cecil in putting down the Ndebele uprising in Southern Rhodesia.<br>
<br>In 1898 Rhodes went, as war correspondent for <span class="italic">The Times</span>, with General Kitchener's Nile expedition; he was wounded at the battle of Omdurman. For his services in that campaign his name was restored to the active list (September 1898).<br>
<br>When war broke out in South Africa in 1899 Rhodes went back and served in the early battles in Natal. He was besieged in Ladysmith. In the fight on Wagon Hill (5&#150;6 January 1900) he showed great courage, and took Lord Ava, who was mortally wounded, out of fire into cover  (Amery, 3.194). In the next May he served as an intelligence officer with the flying column under Brigadier-General Bryan Thomas Mahon which hurried to the relief of Mafeking (4&#150;17 May 1900)  (ibid., 4.222). For his services in the war he was created a military CB. In January 1903 he was Lord Kitchener's guest at the durbar at Delhi. In the same year he retired from the army, and was, until his death, managing director of the African Transcontinental Telegraph Company.<br>
<br>Rhodes assisted Winston Churchill in preparing his <span class="italic">River War on the Sudan</span> (1899; new edn by Rhodes, 1902). Churchill found him &#145;very kind and amiable&#146;  (Churchill, 407) and &#145;a brave and gallant man&#146;  (ibid., 415). Rhodes also contributed an introduction and photographs to <span class="italic">From the Cape to the Zambesi</span> (1905) by G. T. Hutchinson, whom he accompanied in that year to the Zambezi. The strain of this journey is said to have brought on the illness of which he died, unmarried, at his brother's residence, Groote Schuur, Rondebosch, near Cape Town, on 21 September 1905. His body was brought to England to be buried at Dalham, near Newmarket, Suffolk. A memorial tablet was placed by his friends in Eton College chapel in October 1906, and prizes for geography were founded at Eton in his memory. Said to have been a man of charm and a gallant soldier by his contemporaries, he was overshadowed in his lifetime and in the annals of history by his more famous younger brother.<br>
