<span class="headword">Sheppard <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Malcolm]</span>,  Katherine Wilson <span class="st"> [Kate]</span></span>  (1847&#150;1934), <span class="occ">suffragist in New Zealand</span>, was born probably on 10 March 1847 in Liverpool, the second of the five children of Andrew Wilson Malcolm (1819&#150;1862), a clerk, and his wife, Jemima Crawford Souter (1821/2&#150;1881). Although named Catherine at birth after her paternal grandmother, she called herself Katherine or Kate throughout her adult life. Her parents, both Scottish, were married on the Isle of Islay in the Hebrides in 1842. After Kate's birth the family shifted residence in England several times, as her father took a series of jobs. Following his death in 1862, the family separated for periods of time. Family tradition holds that Kate lived for a while in Nairn, Scotland, with an uncle who was a minister of the Free Church of Scotland and a Christian socialist, and who probably shaped her own adult political views. Nothing is known of her formal education, but her subsequent writings indicate wide reading, a fluent literary style, and an interest in the social issues of her day.<br>
<br>In 1869 Kate Malcolm emigrated to the city of Christchurch in New Zealand, with her mother, her sister Isabella, and two brothers, Frank and Robert. They joined Marie Beath, her elder sister, who had already settled in Christchurch and married a draper. Two years later, on 21 July 1871, Kate married Walter Allen Sheppard (1836&#150;1915). Born in Bath, England, the son of a flour-miller, Walter Sheppard had established himself as a general merchant in Christchurch, where he became active in local government. The couple had one child, a son named Douglas, who was born in Christchurch on 8 October 1880.<br>
<br>Kate Sheppard and her husband were comfortably well off and built a pleasant home in the suburb of Riccarton. Fair-complexioned, and stylishly dressed, Kate was widely judged good looking. Her activities outside the domestic circle were initially confined to parish work for the Trinity Congregational Church in Christchurch. She assisted in fund-raising, taught in Sunday school, and served as secretary of the ladies' association, which co-ordinated parish visiting. In the mid-1880s, however, her life changed dramatically when, with her sisters Marie Beath and Isabella May, she helped to form the Women's Christian Temperance Union in New Zealand. Under the leadership of Frances Willard, an advocate of women's emancipation and a Christian socialist, the parent body in the United States of America demanded a curb on men's excessive alcohol consumption, and an extension of women's civil rights. In New Zealand the union became an increasingly forceful campaigning group. From 1887 Kate Sheppard led the campaign for the union's central demand, namely women's attainment of full citizenship through parliamentary franchise. Drawing on theoretical and polemical literature from the United States and England, and attentive to the strategies of northern countries' campaigns, she shrewdly tailored New Zealand activism to the local demands of a small, rural, and relatively egalitarian white British colony. Just as Maori men had been enfranchised alongside European men, Kate Sheppard campaigned to enfranchise European and Maori women, although few Maori initially were members of the union.<br>
<br>Kate Sheppard's skilful direction of the fight for the vote marshalled the colony's Liberal and secular pro-suffrage forces to the women's banner alongside the temperance lobby. She herself became an able public speaker, newspaper columnist, and journalist, co-operated with sympathetic politicians of whatever political affiliation, and oversaw the presentation of well-supported petitions to the colonial legislature. In September 1893 suffrage for all women, European and Maori, twenty-one years of age and over, became law. Urged by Kate Sheppard to show their approval by voting in the forthcoming election, a large number of women registered and voted to return the Liberal government that had enfranchised them in November of the same year.<br>
<br>During the suffrage campaign Kate Sheppard had been in touch with many women reformers in northern countries and, following her success in New Zealand, she found herself in demand as a speaker at meetings and international conferences when she and her husband visited Britain in 1894&#150;5 and again in 1903&#150;4. While women throughout Europe and in all except a few western states of the United States of America remained voteless, Kate was distinctive and compelling on a public platform. Back in New Zealand she helped establish the National Council of Women and, drawing on international links through the International Council of Women, worked to further women's and children's legal and welfare reforms. She also edited the <span class="italic">White Ribbon</span> from 1895 to 1903, continued for several years as superintendent of franchise and legislative concerns for the Women's Christian Temperance Union, and worked on the committee of the Canterbury Women's Institute.<br>
<br>Kate Sheppard subsequently faced many personal sadnesses: her son died in 1910; her husband in 1915; her only grandchild also died at an early age. Her later years were clouded by ill health and the disapproval aroused by her unconventional relationship with a printer and suffrage supporter, William Sidney Lovell-Smith (1852&#150;1929). Increasingly she withdrew from public life. She married Lovell-Smith on 15 August 1925 following the death of his wife the previous year, to be widowed once more four years later. She died of bronchitis at the Lovell-Smith home in Riccarton, Christchurch, on 13 July 1934, and was buried three days later in the city's Addington cemetery beside her mother, brother, sister, nephew, and niece.<br>
