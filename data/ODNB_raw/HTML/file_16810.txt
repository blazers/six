<span class="headword">Livingstone,  Thomas</span>, Viscount Teviot  (<em>c.</em>1651&#150;1711), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was born in the Netherlands, the elder of the two sons of Sir Thomas Livingstone (<i>d</i>. 1673), who was created a baronet by Charles I, and was colonel of a regiment of foot in the Dutch service. His mother, Gertrat, was the daughter of Captain Thomas Edmond. He succeeded his father as second baronet in 1673. Having followed his father into the Dutch service, he acquired military reputation as an officer in the 3rd Scottish regiment in the Anglo-Dutch brigade. By 1688 he was lieutenant-colonel of Balfour's foot regiment and went to England with William of Orange in that year. On 31 December 1688 he was appointed colonel of the Royal regiment of Scots dragoons (later the Royal Scots Greys). Livingstone was already well known in the regiment from his numerous visits to Scotland when recruiting for the Anglo-Dutch brigade. The regiment (not to be confused with the Royal regiment of Scots horse, afterwards disbanded) was in England at the time, and its colonel, Charles Murray, first earl of Dunmore, had refused to serve against King James. Livingstone served in Scotland under General Hugh Mackay, and when in command at Inverness, by forced marches with a body of horse and dragoons, surprised and completely routed the Jacobite forces under General Thomas Buchan at Cromdale, on 1 May 1690. The engagement put an end to the resistance of the clans. Livingstone succeeded General Mackay as commander-in-chief in Scotland, and was sworn of the privy council. On 1 January 1696 he became major-general on the English establishment, and on 4 December 1696 was created Viscount Teviot in the peerage of Scotland.<br>
<br>Livingstone married Macktellina Walrave de Nimmeguen (<i>d</i>. 1729), from whom he appears to have separated about 1701. She pursued him in the Scottish courts in November 1703 for the sum of &pound;500, to pay her debts contracted since he left her, and alimony at the rate of &pound;400 per annum. The lords of session &#145;recommended, under the circumstances of the case, to cause pay her bygone debts, and to settle somewhat upon the lady yearly with the time coming, and to treat with the viscount to that effect&#146;  (J. Lauder, Lord Fountainhall, <span class="italic">Decisions of the Lords of Council and Session</span>, 1759&#150;61, 2.200). As a result probably of this litigation, Teviot sold the colonelcy of the Scots Greys on 7 April 1704 to Lord John Hay. In the great seal registers are charters of resignation by him of the lands of Lethington on 23 June 1702, and of the lands of Waughton on 26 July 1709. Teviot became a lieutenant-general on 1 January 1704. He died in London, aged sixty, on 14 January 1711, when, his having no male heirs, the viscountcy became extinct, and the family baronetcy devolved on his brother, Sir Alexander Livingstone, third baronet. Teviot was buried on 24 February in Westminster Abbey, where his brother erected to his memory a sumptuous monument on the north side of the nave. By his will, dated 27 September 1710, he left his house and estate, known as Livingstone House, Wimbledon, Surrey, with furniture, plate, and other effects, to Lady Elizabeth Gordon, daughter of Charles Gordon, second earl of Aboyne. The lady, at this time a child, died unmarried in 1770. The remainder of his property went to his brother, Sir Alexander, except a legacy of &pound;1000 to his cousin german John Cornelius Edmond, then residing in the Netherlands.<br>
