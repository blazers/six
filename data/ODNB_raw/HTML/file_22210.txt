<span class="headword">Pickering,  John</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1615, <em>d.</em> 1645), <span class="occ">parliamentarian army officer</span>, was baptized at Titchmarsh, Northamptonshire, on 3 December 1615, the second son of Sir John Pickering (<i>d</i>. 1628) and his wife, Susannah (<i>d</i>. 1661), daughter of Sir Erasmus Dryden. His elder brother was the politician <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22207/', "Sir Gilbert Pickering")</script>. John attended Oundle School, Northamptonshire, before going to Cambridge, where he matriculated from St Catharine's College as a fellow-commoner in 1631. In October 1634 he was admitted to Gray's Inn. Pickering was employed in diplomatic work for parliament late in 1641, carrying messages to its committee in Scotland, and was back there between December 1642 and January 1643 acting as an agent for the English parliament and reporting back on events in the Scottish privy council.<br>
<br>Pickering's first military appointment, in August 1643, was the administrative post of commissary-general of the musters in the army of the eastern association, but by late 1643 or early 1644 he was colonel of a weak regiment of dragoons (mounted infantry). He was wounded on 3 March 1644, while serving under Oliver Cromwell at the storming of Hillesden House, Buckinghamshire, and was already seen as a significant enough figure to warrant mention by name in a royalist report of the storm. Shortly after this the dragoons of the eastern association army were reorganized to form a new regiment under Lieutenant-Colonel John Lilburne. On 25 March 1644 Pickering was appointed colonel of a newly raised infantry regiment which he commanded at the battle of Marston Moor (2 July) and the second battle of Newbury (28 October). Pickering was noted for his personal bravery, and this, together with his leadership qualities and zealous puritanism, earned him the respect of both officers and soldiers among the Independent faction of the army of the eastern association, and made him an influential figure in its internal politics. The support of Pickering and other officers of his seniority provided the power base which brought Oliver Cromwell to prominence, and Pickering was a leading witness in Cromwell's attack on their commander, the earl of Manchester.<br>
<br>With the creation of the New Model Army in 1645 Pickering was nominated colonel of one of its twelve infantry regiments by the army's newly appointed commander, Sir Thomas Fairfax. Fairfax's choice of officers was subject to approval by both houses of parliament, and Pickering was one of several radical officers approved by the Commons but queried by the Lords. The dispute was not simply one of the Commons against the Lords but involved a range of different considerations&#151;patronage, kinship, politics, and religion: radical opinion saw the Lords acting to put out &#145;not only Independents but such as were good, and putting in most vile persons&#146;  (Gentles, 19). The practical necessity of forming an effective army to end the war, and a very tight vote in the Lords, finally secured the approval of Fairfax's list. Pickering's preaching to his regiment rapidly caused trouble when the presbyterian elements in his regiment, probably among men from another regiment which had been incorporated into his in the reorganization of the army, mutinied; this led to a parliamentary ordinance forbidding lay preaching in the New Model Army. That early disruption notwithstanding, Pickering's regiment by June 1645 was described as one of the seven &#145;chiefest praying and preaching regiments in the army&#146;, and Pickering's own fervent religious commitment, his competence, and his commitment to the cause made him a popular and influential figure in the New Model Army  (Gentles, 100). According to one posthumous newsletter account, &#145;instead of drinking, swearing, roaring, carding, dicing and drabbing, he spent that little time he had to spare in the study of the scriptures and exercising to his regiment, labouring to distil good discipline by his counsel, as he did valour by his practice&#146;  (<span class="italic">Moderate Intelligencer</span>, 39, 27 Nov &#150; 4 Dec 1645, 209). To the contemporary historian of the New Model Army, Joshua Sprigge, he was &#145;a little man, but of a great courage&#146;  (Sprigge, 156n.).<br>
<br>Pickering served with his regiment at the decisive battle of Naseby (14 June 1645) and a series of successful sieges at Leicester, Bridgwater, Sherborne, Bristol, Devizes, Laycock House, and Basing House. He died at Ottery St Mary, Devon, while engaged at the siege of Exeter on 24 November 1645, of the &#145;New Disease&#146; which had recently been rife among besiegers and besieged at Bristol and which was typhus, the &#145;camp fever&#146; common in army encampments, or bubonic plague. At the request of his brother Sir Gilbert, Cromwell gave orders for Pickering to be buried at Lyme Regis Castle. A contemporary news-sheet provides a compelling last word on John Pickering: &#145;The Souldiers are overwhelmed with grief, deare, gallant, Pickering is dead &hellip; glorious Pickering is gone; the heaviest blow that England received this Winter&#146;  (Foard, 111).<br>
