<span class="headword">Seme,  Pixley ka Isaka</span>  (1882&#150;1951), <span class="occ">political leader in South Africa</span>, was born on 2 October 1882 at the Inanda mission of the American Board outside Durban, Natal, the fourth son of Sinono Isaka Seme and Sarah, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Mseleku. His parents died when he was young and he took as his first name the surname of S. C. Pixley, minister at Inanda, who brought him up. From Inanda he moved at the age of fourteen to the Adams Training School for Boys at Amanzimtoti, south of Durban, and in 1897 he left for further education in the United States. When he arrived in New York he stayed with John Dube (1871&#150;1946), with whom he had grown up, and Dube helped get him admitted to Mount Hermon School for Boys in Massachusetts in 1898. In 1902, having failed the Yale admission examination, he became the first black South African to study at Columbia University. In 1906, shortly before he graduated BA, he won first prize in a speaking competition for a stirring &#145;Regeneration of Africa&#146; oration, in which he told his audience that &#145;the [African] giant is awakening&#146;. A basic factor in the regeneration of Africa, he maintained, was an &#145;awakened race consciousness&#146;  (Karis and Carter, 1.69&#150;71).<br>
<br>After delivering a series of lectures in New York entitled &#145;Life in Zululand&#146;, Seme travelled to Atlanta, where he met Booker T. Washington, and then to Britain, to prepare for the bar examinations. He entered Oxford University as a non-collegiate student in October 1906 to read for a bachelor of civil law degree, and on 22 January 1907 was formally admitted as a member of Jesus College. At his lodgings in Beaumont Street, where he resumed his friendship with the African-American Alain Locke (1886&#150;1955), he hired a piano and took up pipe-smoking. He joined the Oxford Union and became treasurer of the Cosmopolitan Club for students from abroad. He ate dinners at the Middle Temple and from early 1908 spent more time in London than in Oxford, often listening to debates in the House of Commons. Not being able to find vacation work, he fell into financial difficulties from which he was not able to extricate himself until after his return to South Africa.<br>
<br>On 8 June 1909 Seme was called to the London bar. That month he and Alfred Mangena (<i>c</i>.1879&#150;1924) were asked by the Transvaal Native Congress to act in the matter of the <span class="roman">South Africa Bill</span>, and Seme had meetings with members of the black delegation sent to oppose it. It was then that the idea arose of founding an organization to unite Africans throughout South Africa. Seme's exposure to pan-Africanist ideas in America and England helped persuade him that Africans should unite in a common political organization.<br>
<br>Soon after the advent of the Union of South Africa, Seme returned there and set up a law office in Johannesburg. He was admitted to the Transvaal side-bar on 22 December 1910. But his law partnership with Mangena did not last long, for he drew a loaded revolver on a group of whites who wanted him to vacate a first-class railway carriage. His defence&#151;&#145;like all solicitors, I of course travel first class&#146;&#151;did not save him from a conviction. In the second half of 1911 he was the prime mover behind the establishment of a permanent nationwide congress. He drafted a constitution and sent out an appeal for a &#145;native union&#146; in which he denounced the &#145;demon of racialism&#146; that divided Africans  (Odendaal).<br>
<br>Seme's great moment came in Bloemfontein on 8 January 1912 when, in the keynote address, he formally moved that the South African Native National Congress (later renamed the African National Congress) be formed. He became the new body's general treasurer (despite his history of financial problems) and oversaw the launch of <span class="italic">Abantu Batho</span> (&#145;The people&#146;), which it was hoped would become the mouthpiece of the congress. Having become legal adviser to the queen regent of Swaziland, he persuaded her to buy a printing press for the new venture. He left others to carry it on, later launching another paper in Eshowe, Zululand, called <span class="italic">Ikwezi</span> (&#145;Morning star&#146;). He also founded Native Farmers' Association Limited to buy farms for Africans, but his own attempt to farm collapsed when in 1916 the registrar of deeds refused to cede transfer to him because of the <span class="roman">Natives Land Act</span> of 1913. This was a severe blow to his pocket and his reputation, and while he continued to believe in the importance of creating a class of prosperous African farmers, he had to direct his attention instead towards Zululand and Swaziland.<br>
<br>Though very westernized, Seme developed close ties with the Zulu and Swazi royal families. While rejecting &#145;tribalism&#146;, he retained a strong sense of his own Zulu identity. In 1913 he met Phikisele Harriet Dinizulu, daughter of the Zulu monarch Dinizulu and half-sister of Dinizulu's successor Solomon, and they were married in May 1920. Seme remained Solomon's adviser until the latter's death in 1933. He was even closer to the Swazi royal house, and spent more time in Swaziland than anywhere other than Johannesburg. Seme was not only kept busy with the land claim cases brought by the Swazi royal house; he took as his third wife Lozinja, a daughter of the Swazi king Mbandzeni. (His full marital history remains obscure.) In December 1922 Seme accompanied Sobhuza II and a Swazi delegation to London, where they met the king and British officials. In 1923 Locke put forward Seme for an honorary doctorate of laws at Columbia, and Seme soon added LLD to his name. In December 1924 Seme left again for England as attorney to Sobhuza II, only to hear the privy council reject the Swazi appeal.<br>
<br>At the African National Congress (ANC) meeting in 1930 Seme was elected president-general in place of the radical Josiah Gumede (1870&#150;1947). Those who voted for Seme hoped that he would provide moderate leadership and reunite the organization, but his election increased divisions within the congress, and during his presidency the ANC became moribund. He wanted to see chiefs playing a larger role, and preached economic self-help, but in July 1932 he was accused of &#145;culpable inertia&#146;, at a time when the ANC was said to be &#145;in a state of chaos and confusion&#146;  (Karis and Carter, 4.138). Three months later he failed to appear to defend himself before the Transvaal supreme court when the Law Society charged that he had neglected the interests of some clients and charged them excessive fees, and he was struck off the roll of attorneys.<br>
<br>Between 1932 and 1936 Seme spent considerable time trying to get the claims of various Swazi chiefs to land in the eastern Transvaal recognized. In 1935 he joined D. D. T. Jabavu (1885&#150;1959) in calling for a meeting of the All-African Convention, only to see the ANC sidelined by the new body. After being replaced as president-general in 1937 Seme continued to sit on the ANC's national executive, and he served on the committee which in 1943 produced &#145;Africans' claims&#146;, which demanded that the freedoms of the Atlantic charter be applied in South Africa.<br>
<br>In April 1942 Seme was reinstated as an attorney, and the following year the brilliant Anton Lembede (1914&#150;1947) began to serve articles with him. Lembede held ANC youth league meetings in Seme's offices. Seme made him a partner and was preparing to sell his law firm to him when Lembede suddenly died. Seme himself died in early June 1951 in Johannesburg. At his funeral on 17 June the service was taken by Ambrose Reeves, the Anglican bishop of Johannesburg. Tributes were paid to him by Albert Luthuli, A. B. Xuma, Z. K. Matthews, and D. D. T. Jabavu, among others, as well as by a representative of the Swazi monarch and the secretary of native affairs. When a tombstone was unveiled at his grave in 1984 it was Mangosotho Buthelezi, whose mother was Seme's first wife's half-sister, who spoke. As a young man Buthelezi had taken down letters dictated by Seme when he was unable to write after losing an eye in an operation. Seme was survived by four sons and a daughter.<br>
<br>The high point of Seme's life came in 1912, with the founding of the Native National Congress. That his later career was so anticlimactic was in part due to his character, for he could be arrogant and authoritarian in manner. A drinking problem did not help, and his deep-rooted conservatism alienated him from much of the politics of the inter-war years. Today he is remembered for his 1906 speech as much as for founding the ANC.<br>
