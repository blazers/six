<span class="headword">Mathew, Sir  George Benvenuto <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>George Byam]</span>  Buckley-</span>  (1807&#150;1879), <span class="occ">politician and diplomatist</span>, was the son of George Mathew (1760&#150;1846), of the Coldstream Guards, and his wife, Euphemia, the daughter of J. Hamilton. In 1835 he substituted the name of Benvenuto for that of Byam and in 1865 he added that of Buckley (on inheriting West Indian estates). Mathew entered the army in 1825, joining the light infantry; by 1833 he was a captain in his father's regiment. He retired from the army in 1841 as captain in the Grenadier Guards. In 1835 he married Anne Hoare (1808&#150;1872), the only child and heir of the banker Henry Hoare of Stourhead and his wife, Charlotte, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Dering. This marriage, which enabled him to enter politics, was soon in difficulties, ending in what Mathew called a &#145;Scotch divorce&#146; in 1849  (Disraeli, 253n.). His second wife, whom he married in 1850, was another heiress, Rosina Adelaide Handley, the daughter of J. C. Handley, and his third was the daughter of J. W. Gerard of New York (she was also the niece and coheir of General Sumner of Boston). In 1835 Mathew was elected MP for Athlone, as a tory. In 1838 he became MP for Shaftesbury when J. S. Poulter's election was declared void on petition, but he failed by seventeen votes to hold the seat in 1841.<br>
<br>Mathew, frustrated in his political career, was appointed governor of the Bahamas in 1844, beginning a long career in the Americas. He was consul at Charleston from 1850 to 1853 and at Philadelphia from 1853 to 1856, when his exequatur was removed by the president of the USA. After serving in the Black Sea (1856&#150;8), he was secretary and then charg&eacute; d'affaires of the legation first in Mexico and afterwards for the Central American republics, for whom he was minister from 1861 to 1863. He moved to be minister to Colombia (1865&#150;6), Argentina (1866&#150;7), and Brazil (1867 &#150; April 1879). He was made CB in 1863 and KCMG in May 1879, and lived latterly at Leamington Spa. He died at 16 Suffolk Street, London, on 22 October 1879. His various marriages produced at least five sons and two daughters. His was a rather miserable career, with the loss of his seat not compensated by his minor diplomatic appointments, despite the wealth supplied by his marriages.<br>
