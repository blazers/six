<span class="headword">Bouverie,  Jacob</span> <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>Jacob  Des Bouverie]</span>, first Viscount Folkestone  (<em>bap. </em>1694, <em>d.</em> 1761), <span class="occ">patron of science and philanthropist</span>, was baptized at St Katharine Cree church, London, on 14 October 1694, the second son of Sir William Des Bouverie, first baronet (1656&#150;1717), and his second wife, Anne, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Urry (<i>d</i>. 1739). Sir William was a well-known Turkey merchant who traced his descent from Laurens des Bouverie, a Flemish silk weaver who had escaped to Kent in 1568. The family motto <i>Patria cara carior libertas</i> reflected these circumstances. Jacob Des Bouverie was educated first at the Middle Temple, where he was admitted on 24 March 1709, and then at Christ Church, Oxford, where he matriculated on 20 October 1711. He inherited &pound;18,000 from his father in 1717. In 1722 his uncle and namesake bequeathed him the honour and lordship of Folkestone and Terlingham in Kent, and in the same year he travelled to France and Flanders in search of his ancestors. On 31 January 1723, at St Paul's Cathedral, London, he married Mary Clarke (<i>c</i>.1701&#150;1739), daughter of Bartholomew Clarke of Delapr&eacute; Abbey, Northamptonshire; they had two sons and four daughters. His town residence was at this time in Red Lion Street, Holborn, and he rented country houses in Kent. In 1736 he succeeded his elder brother, Sir Edward Des Bouverie (1688&#150;1736), as third baronet, and became possessed of Longford Castle in Wiltshire, a remarkable example of late Elizabethan &#145;fantasy&#146; architecture which he enlarged and embellished over the years. He also leased a house in Clifford Street near Piccadilly, previously used by the earl of Burlington, of which he subsequently bought the freehold.<br>
<br>Des Bouverie changed his surname to Bouverie by act of parliament in 1737 and in the same year became a trustee of the Georgia Society [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/95206', "Trustees for establishing the colony of Georgia in America")</script>], having donated &pound;1000 to the society. He became a common councillor of the society in 1738. He sat as MP for Salisbury from 1741 to 1747, his political sympathies being tory. In spite of this and his alleged Jacobitism he remained recorder of Salisbury from 1743 until his death. He became a guardian of the Foundling Hospital in 1745 and was created Viscount Folkestone and Baron Longford in 1747, having, according to gossip, purchased his peerage from Lady Yarmouth, mistress of George II, for &pound;12,000. He installed his son William as MP for Salisbury, who went on to support the government, perhaps indicating a change of loyalty on Folkestone's part. Folkestone's interest in philanthropy and public service was accompanied by an informed connoisseurship and a taste for display. He purchased examples of the Flemish and Italian schools of painting, notably two famous works by Nicolas Poussin and the portrait of Erasmus attributed to Hans Holbein the younger. He commissioned family portraits from Thomas Hudson, views of London Bridge by Samuel Scott, and genre pictures by John Wootton, and employed William Kent, Benjamin Goodison, and other native craftsmen and artists to work for him at Longford Castle. Around it he supervised the creation of a landscape park, planting many trees and flattening only recently formed water meadows. His interest in afforestation continued in the 1750s, when it became a major concern of the Society of Arts. His private account books written in his own hand record wages paid, pictures bought, expenses of journeys, and tailor's bills. He spent &pound;25 on a waistcoat from Paris and &pound;50 on the embroidery for his coat for his second marriage, which took place on 21 April 1741 at Swanscombe in Kent. His bride was Elizabeth Marsham (<i>d</i>. 1782), daughter of Robert Marsham, first Baron Romney. A son, Jacob, died at the age of four but his younger brother Philip survived until 1828. Folkestone's new brother-in-law, Robert Marsham, second Baron Romney, was related to the eminent clergyman and scientist Stephen Hales, who in 1753 was encouraging William Shipley's scheme for a society of arts. Hales told Shipley that Romney and Folkestone had a similar scheme of their own, but after receiving Shipley in their town houses in Clifford Street, the two peers agreed to back the latter's plan [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/94594', "Founders of the Society of Arts, Manufactures, and Commerce")</script>]. After three months of a largely fruitless canvas by Shipley, Folkestone and Romney held a meeting at Rawthmell's Coffee House in Covent Garden on 22 March 1754. With Folkestone in the chair and Romney, Hales, Shipley, and seven others present, premiums were approved for the discovery of cobalt, the cultivation of madder, and for the best drawings by boys and girls. A second meeting followed on 29 March when the two peers offered to make up any deficiencies in the premium fund and, after being absent until 15 January 1755, Folkestone accepted the position of president of the Society of Arts, Manufactures, and Commerce, to which he was elected on 5 February 1755. He held the office until his death in 1761, during which time the membership of the society increased to 1000 and its premium list extended to over 100 items.<br>
<br>Folkestone presided regularly at the society's new year meetings. He saw the society established in the magnificent great room designed for it by William Chambers in Denmark Court in The Strand, where the first exhibition of modern British art took place in 1760. During his presidency he recruited great noblemen, such as George Henry Lee, third earl of Lichfield, as members, and gave direct patronage to premium winners like the sculptor Thomas Scheemakers. He also worked with Lord Romney, his vice-president, in founding the Marine Society in 1756. Folkestone's work was recognized by the Society of Arts by the award of an honorary gold medal &#145;for eminent services&#146; in 1758. He was, he told Shipley, &#145;a hearty &hellip; well-wisher&#146; to the society, whose &#145;Transactions have given me pleasure more than once&#146;  (Folkestone to Shipley, 1755, Radnor, &#145;First president&#146;, 13).<br>
<br>Folkestone last chaired a meeting of the Society of Arts on 4 February 1761, having the day before presented an address of congratulation to the new king, George III, at St James's Palace on behalf of the society. He died on 17 February 1761 at Britford, Wiltshire, and was buried there on 27 February. Folkestone's death was probably caused by aggravated gout. His account book shows numerous payments for wine and for medicines, doctors' fees, and gout shoes. He was succeeded by William Bouverie (1725&#150;1776), the eldest surviving son of his first marriage, who was created earl of Radnor in 1765 and was elected a vice-president of the Society of Arts in 1773. Successive earls of Radnor were to be associated with the society during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.<br>
