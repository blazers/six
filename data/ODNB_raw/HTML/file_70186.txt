<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Cunningham, Sir  Charles Craik</span>  (1906&#150;1998), <span class="occ">civil servant</span>, was born on 7 May 1906 in Dundee, the only child of Richard Yule Cunningham of Abergeldie, Kirriemuir, Forfarshire, a stationer and bookseller, and his wife, Isabella Adam, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Craik. He had a brilliant academic career at the Harris Academy, Dundee, and St Andrews University, where he read English, German, and Humanity, graduating with a first-class degree in 1928 and BLitt in 1929. (He later received an honorary LLD from St Andrews, in 1960.) He joined the administrative civil service in 1929. He was posted to the small Scottish Office in Whitehall, and was soon spotted as a high flyer. From 1933 to 1934 he was private secretary to the parliamentary under-secretary of state for Scotland, and from 1935 to 1938 he was private secretary to three successive secretaries of state. He married, on 10 July 1934, Edith Louisa (1910&#150;1990), daughter of Frank Coutts Webster. It was a long and happy marriage. They had two daughters, Edith Isobel (<i>b</i>. 1935) and Margaret (<i>b</i>. 1937).<br>
<br>In 1939 Cunningham was due to go to Edinburgh as an assistant secretary in the newly created Scottish home department, but the outbreak of the Second World War kept him in London for some fifteen months, acting as a liaison officer between the new department and the Whitehall ministries. When he eventually moved to Edinburgh, he rose steadily up the hierarchy and in 1948 was appointed secretary of the department, a post he held for nine years. He remained throughout firmly in charge. Later in life he looked back nostalgically to the time when James Stuart was his political superior, as secretary of state (from 1951 to 1957); Stuart concentrated on major governmental policies, and gave his senior officials a fairly free hand. The Scottish home department's role was at this period expanding in a wide spectrum of activity, including penal reform, police and fire service training, child care, hydroelectricity, roads, tourism, and the fishing industry. Cunningham felt that his department had a real contribution to make in promoting Scotland's economic development. He was knighted KBE in 1952, having been appointed CVO in 1941 and CB in 1946.<br>
<br>Cunningham, as a stout defender of Scottish interests, became well known in Whitehall, and in 1957 the home secretary R. A. (Rab) Butler agreed to his appointment as permanent under-secretary of state at the Home Office. The responsibilities of the Home Office in the field of criminal justice were familiar enough to Cunningham from his Scottish experience, although the scale was greater. He lost no time in setting up for the first time a professional research unit, and encouraged the creation of the Cambridge Institute of Criminology. The year 1959 saw the publication of Butler's white paper <span class="italic">Penal Practice in a Changing Society</span>, the first general discussion on penal methods since the Gladstone report of 1895. In 1960 a royal commission on the police was appointed. In 1963 Cunningham merged the work of the Prison Commission into that of the Home Office, to improve co-operation between all the divisions dealing with offenders. When he left office, he had brought to an advanced state proposals for appointing a Parole Board.<br>
<br>Cunningham was assiduous in coping with the various other activities of the Home Office, which included relations with the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man, and running the state management scheme for the public houses and breweries of the Carlisle and Gretna Green districts. He used to travel and meet those concerned on the ground. He also found himself facing a new problem: immigration from the Commonwealth. He was involved in the anxious discussions which led to the <span class="roman">Commonwealth Immigration Act</span>, 1962, which for the first time imposed restrictions on entry to the UK from the Commonwealth. In 1965 he accompanied Lord Mountbatten on a mission to various Commonwealth countries to try to persuade them to set up controls and health checks at source. In Pakistan it fell to him to conduct the negotiations.<br>
<br>Cunningham (who was promoted KCB in 1961) brought with him to the Home Office the personal style he had evolved in Scotland, a style made possible only by his prodigious capacity for work. On important policy issues he liked to present to ministers only his own submission, setting out his account of the facts and arguments, and his recommendations. The staff found it somewhat frustrating that their efforts were not seen by ministers, but Butler, although he found the procedure rather odd compared with his experience in the Foreign Office, did not disturb it. Nor did Henry Brooke, who succeeded Butler in 1962 and achieved unpopularity in liberal circles for what was thought to be insensitive handling of some immigration and deportation cases. Sir Frank Soskice, who followed Brooke in 1964 (and, like him, failed to improve his reputation while at the Home Office), also accepted what was on offer. But Roy Jenkins, who succeeded Soskice towards the end of 1965, found the procedure unacceptable. He wanted to know all about the background and to see what others had said so that he could make up his own mind. He began with a confrontation with Cunningham over some staff appointments, but the main battle took place over submissions. Cunningham in the end had to give way. Jenkins respected his great ability, but would not agree to a further extension of his appointment, and he retired in the summer of 1966.<br>
<br>Cunningham was almost immediately appointed to the board of the Atomic Energy Authority, and in October 1966 he became its deputy chairman. During his five years in the post he devoted his skill and energy to furthering the authority's interests. He tried hard to resist proposals for breaking up the authority, and encouraged diversification into non-nuclear work. From 1971 to 1974 he chaired the newly formed Radiochemical Centre Ltd, and he was a founder member of the National Radiological Protection Board. He also chaired selection boards for the civil service commission. In 1972 he chaired the Ugandan Resettlement Board, which tackled with energy and considerable success the formidable problem of resettling some 28,500 Ugandan Asians expelled by Idi Amin. He was promoted GCB in 1974.<br>
<br>Cunningham was a small, wiry individual, with extraordinary stamina. He was always punctilious in attending functions where he thought his department should be represented, and would then work at home far into the night. He was polite and courteous, albeit with touches of impatience; in private conversation he exercised a highly entertaining, if somewhat mordant, wit; and he was a fluent public speaker. He was essentially a liberal and humane man, but tended sometimes to be a little rigid in his approach. He was not a dominant figure in Whitehall, but was much respected as an effective departmental head. A man of formidable intellect and complete integrity, a prodigious and conscientious worker, an expert in so many fields, in possession of an outstanding analytical ability, he was a public servant of great distinction.<br>
<br>Lady Cunningham died in 1990, and in the following year Cunningham moved back to Edinburgh. He continued to live an active life, although troubled by failing sight, but a few months before his death he went into the Strachan House Nursing Home, Edinburgh. He died there on 7 July 1998, of cancer. He was survived by his two daughters.<br>
