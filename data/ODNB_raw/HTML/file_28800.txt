<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Warwick, Sir  Philip</span>  (1609&#150;1683), <span class="occ">politician and historian</span>, was born in the parish of St Margaret, Westminster, on 24 December 1609, and baptized the same day. He was the only son of Thomas Warwick (<i>fl</i>. 1580&#150;1620), organist of Westminster Abbey and the Chapel Royal, and Elizabeth Somerville of Aston Somerville, Warwickshire. He was educated at Eton College, which he entered about 1623, after which he may have attended Pembroke College, Cambridge, and he then spent time travelling in France and Switzerland. It seems that in 1634 he also had some practice with the pike in the Netherlands. While he was abroad, by a contract dated 2 April 1634, it was arranged that he would marry Dorothy (<i>d</i>. 1644), daughter of Matthew Hutton of Marske, Yorkshire. On his return Warwick became secretary to his distant relative Lord Goring, and it was through Goring's influence that he became secretary to William Juxon on the latter's appointment as lord treasurer in March 1636. Warwick was admitted to Gray's Inn on 12 February 1638, and on 11 April that year was created LLB by Oxford University. A few months later, on 13 November, he became a clerk of the signet, an office he held until 1646.<h2>
<a name="Royalistsupport"></a>Royalist support</h2>In 1640 Warwick was elected to sit for both Radnor borough and New Romney, Kent, in the Long Parliament, and chose to serve for the former. He was one of the fifty-nine &#145;Straffordians&#146; who voted against Strafford's attainder, and the following year he rallied to Charles I. In his <span class="italic">Memoires of the Reign of King Charles I</span> (1701) Warwick blamed the outbreak of the civil war on &#145;an envy unto the regall prerogative&#146;, and &#145;the irreconcileable and never to be satisfied appetite unto a change in government in the Long Parliament&#146;  (pp. 8, 75). He fought as a volunteer at Edgehill, and in 1643 he acted as the king's emissary in two unsuccessful attempts to persuade the earl of Newcastle to bring his army southwards. In January 1644 he was among those who assembled at the Oxford parliament, whereupon he was deprived of his seat at Westminster on 5 February. At Oxford he lodged in rooms at University College, and he later helped to negotiate the terms of the city's surrender in June 1646. Warwick's first wife had died in August 1644, and in 1647 he married Joan, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Fanshawe, widow of Sir William Boteler. She is not mentioned in his will, and probably predeceased him.<br>
<br>In the autumn of 1647 Warwick was allowed to attend Charles at Hampton Court as one of his secretaries, and he served the king in a similar capacity a year later at the treaty of Newport. In his <span class="italic">Memoires</span> Warwick subsequently left a firsthand account of the king's final months. Charles trusted him greatly, and in the evenings dictated to him dispatches on the progress of the treaty that were then sent to the prince of Wales. Warwick recorded that in private one day Charles warned, prophetically, that the parliamentarian commissioners &#145;will ask so much, and use it so ill, that the people of England will be one day glad to relodge the power they had taken from the Crown, where it is due&#146;  (Warwick, <span class="italic">Memoires</span>, 1701, 328). Warwick also described the only occasion when, late in the Newport talks, he saw the king shed tears and then compose himself with characteristic self-control: &#145;they were the biggest drops that ever I saw fall from an eye; but he recollected himselfe, and soon stifled them&#146;  (ibid., 326). In January 1649 Warwick was appalled when &#145;this good Prince was most barbarously and traiterously murdered by his owne subjects&#146;  (ibid., 8).<br>
<br>On 28 July 1644 the committee for the advance of money had imposed a fine of &pound;1000 on Warwick, though it seems that no proceedings were taken on this. On 6 August 1646 Warwick begged to compound under the Oxford articles, and the following December he was fined at the rate of one-tenth of his estate (a sum of &pound;477 18<i>s</i>.). However, in January 1649 he begged a review, having paid half his fine and compounded for a debt of &pound;2500 which he was likely to lose. The following month, after review, the fine was reduced to &pound;241, and later that year the Rump Parliament accepted his composition and granted him a pardon.<br>
<br>By compounding, Warwick was able to remain in England during the interregnum. Although he was imprisoned on suspicion in 1655 and detained for several weeks, he avoided any involvement in royalist conspiracy. Nevertheless, there is clear evidence that royalist leaders trusted his loyalty. In January 1660 Warwick was employed to negotiate with Lambert and to look after &#145;a very considerable sum of many thousand pounds&#146; that had been collected &#145;for the advancement of the King's service&#146;  (Scrope and Monkhouse, 3.649). Hyde wrote that &#145;the King knows very well Mr Warwick's affection and zeal to his service and his abilities to promote it&#146;  (ibid.). It was reported that Warwick was sympathetic to the presbyterians, but at the Restoration he helped to thwart their attempts to exclude from the Lords those younger royalist peers who had gained their titles since 1642.<h2>
<a name="SecretarytotheTreasury"></a>Secretary to the Treasury</h2>Charles II expressed his gratitude to Warwick by knighting him in 1660, reappointing him as clerk of the signet, and also making him secretary to the Treasury. The earl of Southampton became lord treasurer in September 1660, but according to Gilbert Burnet he &#145;left the business of the Treasury wholly in the hands&#146; of Warwick  (<span class="italic">Bishop Burnet's History</span>, 1.174). In 1661 Warwick was returned for Westminster and became an active member of the Cavalier Parliament: between then and 1678 he made a total of 49 recorded speeches and was appointed to 258 committees. Throughout he remained consistent in his loyalty to the crown and to the church. In the early 1660s he was appointed to all the committees that framed the Clarendon code, and chaired the committees that drafted the bills for the security of the king's person and against tumultuous petitioning.<br>
<br>Warwick's role as secretary to the Treasury ensured that he regularly acted as an official spokesman on financial matters in the Commons. In June 1661 he reported that the crown's revenue amounted to only &pound;265,000 out of an expected &pound;1,200,000, and he was promptly appointed to a committee to consider ways in which it could be augmented. In 1663 he announced that revenues had increased to &pound;978,000, but the Commons rejected his request for additional supply to bridge the remaining gap, on the grounds that further economies and efficiency savings would solve the problem. However, in 1665 he succeeded in persuading the Commons to grant a new tax of &pound;70,000 a month for the duration of the Second Anglo-Dutch War, and was appointed chairman of the committee to revise county tax assessments for this &#145;royal aid&#146;. In September 1666 he presented a full statement of public accounts to the Commons.<br>
<br>When Southampton died in May 1667, the Treasury was put into commission. Warwick was not among the commissioners, and Sir George Downing took over his position as secretary. Gilbert Burnet thought Warwick &#145;an incorrupt man, and during seven years management of the Treasury made but an ordinary fortune out of it&#146;  (<span class="italic">Bishop Burnet's History</span>, 1.174). It is likely that he had gained about &pound;2000 a year from the post. That and the permission in 1663 to build a house on the road between Charing Cross and St James's Palace, together with the reversion of the office of customer and collector of customs on woollen cloth in the port of London (worth &pound;277 a year), appear to have been the only material benefits that he derived from his office. After 1667 he remained active in the Commons, where he was widely regarded as a court supporter and usually took a sympathetic line towards the crown's policies and advisers. This was evident, for example, in his denial that Clarendon had usurped the functions of the lord treasurer, and in his defence in 1669 of the former treasurer of the navy Sir George Carteret against charges of corruption.<h2>
<a name="Opinionsonmonarchy"></a>Opinions on monarchy</h2>Only very occasionally did Warwick deviate from the prevailing court line. His commitment to the established church led him to oppose greater toleration for either Catholics or protestant nonconformists. In 1670 he was among those appointed to consider the renewal of the <span class="roman">Conventicles Act</span>, and two years later he opposed Charles II's declaration of indulgence. However, he was soon won over by the king's conciliatory response in February 1673, even though it defended the royal suspending power and did not actually withdraw the declaration. He remained hostile to relief for protestant dissenters, and moved on 7 March that &#145;there may be a test upon persons to sit in this House, that the Church may not be destroyed&#146;  (Grey, 2.89). In April 1675 he was named to the committees for bills to suppress popery and to disable Catholics from sitting in either house. During the long prorogation of parliament from November 1675 to February 1677, Warwick wrote his <span class="italic">Memoires</span>, which was published posthumously in 1701.<br>
<br>Warwick was included on lists of government speakers, though Sir Richard Wiseman wrote to Danby: &#145;I wish your lordship would think of some way to make this gentleman industrious and hearty in the service&#146;  (HoP, <span class="italic">Commons, 1660&#150;90</span>, 3.676). Shaftesbury had no doubt as to where Warwick's loyalties lay, and when parliament reconvened in February 1677 he marked Warwick as &#145;thrice vile&#146;  (ibid.). Nevertheless, Warwick's fear of popery was such that he spoke out against Charles II's policy of <i>rapprochement</i> with France. He told the Commons on 14 March 1678 that he had &#145;feared this greatness of the French King these forty years; and in my last Master's time, they had great correspondence in Court, and found casements to look in at&#146;  (Grey, 5.230). On 2 May he declared: &#145;I believe that if ever the nation was in danger, it is now &hellip; I believe all the powers in Christendom will stand by us, if we enter into a war with the King of France&#146;  (ibid., 5.300). In the autumn of 1678 he naturally believed the revelations of Titus Oates and Israel Tonge about the Popish Plot, and on 4 November denounced popery as &#145;a confederacy against God, and against the kingdom&#146;  (ibid., 6.147). He was among those appointed to search the cellars of the Palace of Westminster amid fears of another Catholic plot to blow up parliament. Although he was listed as a court supporter, the logic of his horror of &#145;popery and arbitrary government&#146; led him to vote for the impeachment of Danby.<br>
<br>During 1678 Warwick wrote <span class="italic">A Discourse on Government</span>, published posthumously in 1694. In this treatise he argued that the monarchs of England &#145;remain absolute though limited&#146;, and that the king was &#145;an absolute, though not an arbitrary monarch&#146;  (pp. 20, 41). He regarded England as &#145;a limited and mixt monarchy&#146;  (Warwick, <span class="italic">Discourse</span>, 185), but this did not imply that the crown, Lords, and Commons exercised co-ordinate powers. Indeed, Warwick denounced the doctrine of co-ordination as &#145;like to prove the mother of a civil war&#146;  (ibid., 19), and detested that &#145;destructive torrent of populacy&#146;  (ibid., 184) that had led the houses to take up arms against the king in 1642. His loyalty to the memory of Charles I remained beyond question, and in January 1678 he was appointed to chair a committee to consider the solemn reburial of the king's remains, though no legislation resulted from this.<br>
<br>After the Cavalier Parliament was dissolved in January 1679, Warwick did not stand for parliament again. He had sold his Westminster house in the mid-1670s, and henceforth lived quietly at his home at Chislehurst in Kent. He died on 15 January 1683, probably at Chislehurst, and was buried in Chislehurst church. His only son by his first wife, also named <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28801/', "Philip Warwick (bap. 1640, d. 1683)")</script>, was appointed envoy to Sweden in 1680; he died shortly afterwards at Newmarket on 12 March 1683, after journeying home to take leave of his father.<br>
<br>Warwick's contemporaries varied widely in their assessment of him. Samuel Pepys regarded him as &#145;a very able and right honest man&#146;, whose exposition of the government's financial problems showed him to be &#145;a most exact and methodical man, and of great industry&#146;  (Pepys, 29 Feb 1664, 5.70; 24 Nov 1666, 7.382). By contrast, Andrew Marvell wrote that Warwick &#145;never lyes more than when he professes to speak the sincerity of his heart&#146;  (<span class="italic">A Seasonable Argument to Perswade All the Grand Juries in England to Petition for a New Parliament</span>, [1677], 12). There is, however, no evidence to support Marvell's further claim that Warwick &#145;got artificially from the Treasurer Southampton and the King &pound;40,000&#146;. A less vituperative but still fairly critical account was penned by Gilbert Burnet, who thought Warwick &#145;an honest but a weak man&#146;, who &#145;understood the common road of the Treasury; but, though he pretended to wit and politics, he was not cut out for that, and least of all for writing of history&#146;  (<span class="italic">Bishop Burnet's History</span>, 1.174). It is, however, worth noting that both Burnet and Marvell embraced whig principles that placed them out of sympathy with Warwick's consistent allegiance to crown and church.<br>
