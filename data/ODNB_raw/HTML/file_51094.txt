<span class="headword">Hawkes,  (Charles Francis) Christopher</span>  (1905&#150;1992), <span class="occ">archaeologist</span>, was born on 5 June 1905 at 35 De Vere Gardens, Kensington, London, the elder child and only son of Charles Pascoe Hawkes (1877&#150;1956), a lawyer, soldier, and author, and his wife, Eleanor Victoria (1874&#150;1966), daughter of Charles Davison Cobb, a wine shipper, and his Spanish wife, Victoria. Christopher was a precociously clever child, and after preparatory school in Surrey he went to Winchester College in 1918. He flourished as a classical scholar, also showing a talent for music and drawing. His father's military service included postings in the north-east of England and on Salisbury Plain, and Hawkes became familiar with monuments such as Hadrian's Wall, the monastery church at Jarrow, and Stonehenge. At Winchester he wrote to O. G. S. Crawford, the newly appointed archaeology officer of the Ordnance Survey, whose encouragement to him to explore the field monuments of the district led to his first published work.<br>
<br>In 1924 Hawkes went up to New College, Oxford. He became increasingly interested in ancient history and archaeology, studying Roman Britain with R. G. Collingwood and acquiring his basic training in excavation with Mortimer Wheeler at Brecon in 1925 and with Donald Atkinson at Wroxeter in 1926. In 1925&#150;6, with Nowell Myres and Charles Stevens, he began to excavate the medieval chapel on St Catherine's Hill, Winchester; in 1927&#150;8 this work was extended to the Iron Age hill fort there.<br>
<br>After taking a first-class degree in 1928 Hawkes moved to the department of British and medieval antiquities at the British Museum, as (successively) assistant, assistant keeper (second class), and assistant keeper (first class). He was responsible for compiling the accessions register, and though this was often behind schedule his scholarship and talent for drawing made the registers of this period a mine of information. His intellectual ambition spread far beyond the museum, however, and he continued busily writing, researching, and excavating. His excavation in 1930&#150;32 with Rex Hull at Colchester was the first serious attempt to understand the complexities of a late Iron Age town. From 1935 to 1939 he excavated three more Iron Age hill forts in Hampshire.<br>
<br>Hawkes's work launched a new phase of Iron Age studies. His article on hill forts (<span class="italic">Antiquity</span>, 5, 1931, 60&#150;97) reviewed the evidence for this type of site, and introduced a new chronological and cultural scheme for the Iron Age, linked to a theory of cultural change by migration, which dominated the subject for the next forty years. Another article, written with Gerald Dunning, on the Belgae (<span class="italic">Archaeological Journal</span>, 87, 1930, 150&#150;335), provided detailed documentation of the continental background to the final period of the Iron Age in Britain. With Thomas Kendrick he produced <span class="italic">Archaeology in England and Wales, 1914&#150;1931</span> (1932), a major synthesis of recent archaeological work which offered a new formulation of later prehistory.<br>
<br>At Colchester Hawkes had met (Jessie) Jacquetta Hopkins (1910&#150;1996) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/61934/', "Hawkes, (Jessie) Jacquetta")</script>]. They were married on 7 October 1933, and collaborated fruitfully in several subsequent projects. Their only child, Nicolas, was born in 1937, but the marriage ended in June 1953. Strained by his intellectual ambition, his heavy workload, and his lifelong inability to start the day promptly, Hawkes's relationship with his departmental keeper, Reginald Smith, became increasingly sour. Matters improved after Smith's retirement in 1937, but it was clear that Hawkes's future lay elsewhere. Further progress was stalled by the Second World War, when he was seconded to the Ministry of Aircraft Production. He returned to the museum in 1946, but was soon appointed to the new chair of European archaeology at Oxford. He took up the post on 1 October 1946, and held it until his retirement in 1972. On 30 January 1959 he married the archaeologist <a href="#cosubject_72405">Sonia Elizabeth Chadwick [<i>see below</i>]</a>. After a brief period living at Dorchester-on-Thames, they settled at 19 Walton Street, Oxford, which with the later inclusion of no. 20 remained their home until his death.<br>
<br>Hawkes did not have an easy ride at Oxford. His informative and entertaining memorandum submitted in 1965 to the Franks commission on the plight of new subjects at Oxford  (Franks commission, written evidence, part 11, 55&#150;64) was tartly reminiscent of Cornford's <span class="italic">Microcosmographia academica</span>. With mock puzzlement it described the ingenuity of Oxford's devices for politely blocking change, and boldly sought a remedy in &#145;a period of directorial government&#146;  (ibid., 61). Beneath the humour lay Hawkes's deep frustration at the complex structures and short-sighted priorities which caused Oxford to lag behind other universities in its research and teaching. The frustration born of long years spent in trying to advance his subject also stood out in Hawkes's oral evidence to the committee. In the time spent writing memoranda during his eighteen years at Oxford he said, &#145;I could have written at least one archaeological book&#146;. When asked if there had been rows, he replied: &#145;A good many &hellip; some of them exceedingly fierce, of which I have been the centre&#146;  (Franks commission, oral evidence, O. 33, p. 12).<br>
<br>Hawkes made Oxford a centre for postgraduate teaching and research in archaeology. His interest in the later prehistoric and early historic periods were complemented in 1956 by the appointment of Ian Richmond to a chair in the archaeology of the Roman empire. These developments culminated in the establishment of the Institute of Archaeology in 1961. Hawkes was an inspiring teacher; though there were never many students the proportion who went on to prominent positions in archaeology was remarkable. He quickly appreciated the potential contribution of the natural sciences to knowledge of the past, and responded enthusiastically to Lord Cherwell's suggestion that Oxford should found a research laboratory for archaeology; it came into being in 1955. He was also instrumental in founding its journal <span class="italic">Archaeometry</span> (a word he claimed to have invented).<br>
<br>Hawkes continued to publish well into his eighties. He declined to revise his one major work of synthesis, <span class="italic">The Prehistoric Foundations of Europe</span> (1940), because his interests were now firmly in the first millennium <span class="smallcap">BC</span>, but a stream of articles on Bronze Age and Iron Age Europe confirmed his position as Britain's leading authority on these periods. He did not accept a divide between prehistory and history, and believed firmly in the value of the written sources. His work was characterized by a detailed familiarity with the textual and material evidence and by a firm commitment to understanding the past on a pan-European scale. From the 1930s he was a regular visitor to Europe, and he was greatly respected by his continental contemporaries. Though some of his ideas, especially the explanation of culture change by a series of migrations, became unfashionable, the rapid progress made in Iron Age studies would have been impossible without his pioneering efforts.<br>
<br>Hawkes was a striking figure, despite his spare build and his increasingly severe limp. He had penetrating pale eyes behind his thick glasses, and a shock of dark hair, which later turned to silver. He was a good listener, but also an intimidatingly well-informed, though always witty, talker. His distinctive handwriting was matched by an idiosyncratic English style, which, though always accurate, could be highly compressed. He died in Oxford on 29 March 1992. His funeral took place on 3 April 1992 at St Cross Church, Oxford.<br>
<br>Hawkes's second wife, <a name="cosubject_72405"></a><span class="headword">Sonia Elizabeth Hawkes <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Chadwick]</span></span>  (1933&#150;1999), <span class="occ">archaeologist</span>, was born on 5 November 1933 at Barnes Cray Nursing Home, Crayford, near Dartford, Kent, the only child of Albert Andrew Chadwick, engineer, and his wife, Doris, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Benger. She was educated at school in Dartford, and read English at Bedford College, London, before becoming an archaeologist and expert on the artefacts of the fifth to seventh centuries <span class="smallcap">AD</span>. From 1958 to 1959 she was curator of the Scunthorpe Museum. After her marriage to Hawkes in 1959 she was research assistant (1959&#150;73) at the Oxford Institute of Archaeology. There she began her most significant research, on Anglo-Saxon graves and grave goods, focusing on the Kent cemeteries and especially Finglesham. Elected FSA in 1961 she was university lecturer in European archaeology from 1973 to 1994. She suffered from stage nerves and disliked lecturing, but was an effective supervisor of graduate students and created a notable seminar series which resulted in <span class="italic">Weapons and Warfare in Anglo-Saxon England</span> (1989). In 1979 she was a founding editor of <span class="italic">Anglo-Saxon Studies in Archaeology and History</span>. She nursed her husband in his declining years, took early retirement in 1994, and married Svetislav Petkovic (<i>b</i>. 1923/4), a retired factory inspector, on 13 May 1995. Following a long illness she died of cancer on 29 May 1999 at Sobell House, Oxford, and was cremated on 8 June at Oxford crematorium. She was survived by her second husband.<br>
