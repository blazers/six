</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Loudon,  John Claudius</span>  (1783&#150;1843), <span class="occ">landscape gardener and horticultural writer</span>, was born on 8 April 1783 at Cambuslang, Lanarkshire, the eldest son of William Loudon (<i>d</i>. 1809), farmer, of Kerse Hall, Lothian, and his wife, Agnes, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Somers (<i>d</i>. 1831).<h2>
<a name="Earlyyears"></a>Early years</h2>In 1794 Loudon began working part-time as an assistant to John Mawer, a nurseryman and landscape gardener at Dalry; on Mawer's death in 1798 he became a part-time apprentice to Dickson and Shade, nurserymen at Leith Walk, Edinburgh. At the same time he entered the University of Edinburgh, where he studied until 1802, attending Andrew Coventry's lectures on agriculture, as well as classes in botany and chemistry. While at university, according to his wife's account, he developed the habit of staying up two nights a week to study. His first publication, a translation of the life of Abelard for an encyclopaedia, took place in 1802.<br>
<br>In 1803 Loudon visited London with letters of introduction from Coventry, and met James Sowerby, Sir Joseph Banks, and Jeremy Bentham, the last of whom became a major influence on his social and political thinking. His first horticultural publication, &#145;Hints respecting the manner of laying out the grounds of the public squares in London&#146;, was published in the <span class="italic">Literary Journal</span> for 31 December of that year; it revealed him as a follower of Sir Uvedale Price and a critic of Humphry Repton. His first book appeared in 1804: <span class="italic">Observations on the Formation and Management of Useful and Ornamental Plantations</span>, which was followed in 1805 by <span class="italic">A Short Treatise on Several Improvements Recently Made in Hot-Houses</span> and in 1806 by a two-volume <span class="italic">Treatise on Forming, Improving, and Managing Country Residences</span>.<br>
<br>In 1804, meanwhile, Loudon had exhibited three landscapes at the Royal Academy. On 13 March 1805 he was elected to the Society of Arts, and the following year he was made a fellow of the Linnean Society. He had already begun a career as a landscape gardener in 1803, with proposals for improvements to the grounds of Scone Palace, Perthshire, the seat of Lord Mansfield; 1804 saw commissions from the duchess of Brunswick and others, for properties in the London vicinity and in Scotland (some of these early commissions he was to describe in his book on Scottish farms in 1811).<br>
<br>In 1806 Loudon moved to 90 Newman Street, London, and exhibited the first symptoms of the ill health that affected him for the rest of his life: following an attack of rheumatic fever, his knee became ankylosed and his right arm permanently contracted. In 1807 he retired to Wood Hall Farm in Pinner, Middlesex, and with his father took out a lease on the nearby Kenton Farm. The following year he published a pamphlet, <span class="italic">An Immediate and Effectual Mode of Raising the Rental of the Landed Property of England</span>, as a result of which he was invited by General George F. Stratton to appraise his property at Great Tew, Oxfordshire; Loudon took over the tenancy of Tew Lodge Farm on an undertaking to double its rental value. In 1809 he established a small agricultural college at Tew, and in 1811 he published <span class="italic">Designs for Laying out Farms and Farm-Buildings, in the Scotch Style</span> (reprinted the next year as <span class="italic">Observations on Laying out Farms &hellip;</span>), celebrating his accomplishments there. General Stratton bought back the lease in February 1811, but the agricultural reversals of the Napoleonic wars meant that his expected profits did not materialize. Loudon moved to 42 Pall Mall. His father had died on 29 December 1809, and was buried in the churchyard of St John the Baptist, Pinner; Loudon designed a unique monument for the grave, in the form of a pyramid from whose sides projected the ends of a sarcophagus carrying inscriptions on their end-panels.<h2>
<a name="Continentalvisits"></a>Continental visits</h2>Loudon had amassed &pound;15,000 by the time he left Tew. In 1812 he published <span class="italic">Hints on the Formation of Gardens and Pleasure Grounds</span>, which included designs for formal gardens as well as informal landscapes. He journeyed though the south of England, and in 1813 and 1814 travelled on the continent, visiting Germany, Latvia, St Petersburg, Moscow, and central Europe. According to his wife's account, &#145;he proceeded by Grodno to Wilna, through a country covered with the remains of the French army, horses and men lying dead by the road-side, and bands of wild-looking Cossacks scouring the country&#146;  (J. Loudon, xxii). He arrived in Moscow in time for the celebrations on learning of the allied armies' entry into Paris. When he returned to England he found that his banker had mishandled his finances and largely dissolved the fortune he had built up. During the following year he &#145;made several fruitless journeys [including one to Paris] in the hope of recovering some part of the property&#146;, but ultimately had to resign himself to its loss  (ibid., xxv). In 1816 he moved to Bayswater.<br>
<br>In 1817 Loudon published <span class="italic">Remarks on the Construction of Hot-Houses</span> and the next year <span class="italic">A Comparative View of the Common and Curvilinear Mode of Roofing Hot-Houses</span> and <span class="italic">Sketches of Curvilinear Hot-Houses</span>. Following a suggestion by Sir George Mackenzie, that the ideal design for a greenhouse was spherical, so that light would be admitted equally at all times of day, Loudon invented a glazing bar in wrought iron that could be made in curvilinear sections. He later recorded that he sold his design to Messrs W. and D. Bailey of Holborn, and the patent (no. 4277, granted 11 July 1818) was taken out by them; Loudon's name does not appear on it. Loudon collaborated with Baileys on an unascertained number of glasshouses in the following years. Grandiose plans for glasshouses characterized his plans in 1831 for the Birmingham Botanic Garden, but on these he was overruled by the town council.<br>
<br>In 1819, carrying letters of introduction from Sir Joseph Banks, Loudon visited France, Italy, Switzerland, and the Low Countries to gather material for a proposed <span class="italic">Encyclopaedia of Gardening</span>. The book was published in 1822 as an octavo of nearly 1500 pages, covering plant culture, botany, garden design, and an international survey and history of gardening. It went through six editions, with varying degrees of revision and expansion, during Loudon's lifetime, and posthumous editions continued to appear into the 1870s. The period of writing of this work was one of great physical pain for Loudon: in 1820, an attempted operation fractured his right arm, which in 1825 was amputated. During the intervening years he had become addicted to laudanum as a painkiller, but after the amputation he broke his addiction by progressively diluting the dose he took. Other works of these years include <span class="italic">The Different Modes of Cultivating the Pine-Apple</span> (published anonymously, 1823), <span class="italic">The Green-House Companion</span> (1824, with further editions in 1825 and 1832), and <span class="italic">An Encyclopaedia of Agriculture</span> (1825). In 1823&#150;4 Loudon designed and supervised the building of a villa at 3 Porchester Terrace, Bayswater, which incorporated an entrance conservatory with a wrought-iron dome; he lived there until his death. (The house now bears an LCC plaque, installed in 1953.)<h2>
<a name="TheGardenersMagazine"></a>The Gardener's Magazine</h2>In 1826 Loudon began publishing the <span class="italic">Gardener's Magazine</span>, first as a quarterly, priced 5<i>s</i>.; according to Jane Loudon, 4000 copies of the first issue were sold. From 1827 it appeared bi-monthly, and from 1831 as a monthly, the price per issue declining until in 1834 it reached 1<i>s</i>. 2<i>d</i>. Loudon's magazine, which reached nineteen volumes before it ceased on his death at the end of 1843, was soon imitated by magazines edited by Joseph Paxton, George Glenny, and others, and accusations of plagiarism passed between rival editors; but, in its early years in particular, Loudon himself had republished much material from the more expensive <span class="italic">Transactions</span> of the Horticultural Society. The <span class="italic">Gardener's Magazine</span> became a forum for the exchange of ideas on gardening on a national scale; it also served as Loudon's main forum for promoting his ideas on a variety of subjects. He recounted in it his various journeys around Great Britain, describing the gardens he visited and commenting freely on how they could be improved. In 1829 he published in it articles recommending a national system of education, workers' dwellings, and a plan for the controlled expansion of London through concentric circles of alternating open space and residential and commercial development.<br>
<br>The <span class="italic">Gardener's Magazine</span> was not Loudon's only venture in periodical publication. Between 1828 and 1836 he edited the <span class="italic">Magazine of Natural History</span>, and between 1834 and 1839 the <span class="italic">Architectural Magazine</span>, which provided the young John Ruskin's first opportunity at publication. In 1830 Loudon also launched a folio publication, <span class="italic">Illustrations of Landscape-Gardening and Garden Architecture</span>, but this was poorly subscribed to and was discontinued after its third number in 1833.<br>
<br>In March 1828 Loudon had reviewed an anonymous novel called <span class="italic">The Mummy</span>, published the year before, which favourably impressed him by its account of the scientific and technological advances made in its imagined future. In February 1830 he met the author, who proved, to his surprise, to be a young woman, Jane Webb (1807&#150;1858) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17030/', "Loudon, Jane")</script>], and he married her on 14 September. They had one child, Agnes (married name Spofforth), who was born in 1832.<h2>
<a name="Botanicalpublications"></a>Botanical publications</h2>1828 saw Loudon's third continental tour, in France and Germany. In 1829 came the first of his important botanical publications: <span class="italic">An Encyclopaedia of Plants</span>, with the botanical text contributed by John Lindley. This was followed in 1830 by <span class="italic">Hortus Britannicus</span> and an anonymous <span class="italic">Manual of Cottage Gardening</span>, and in 1832&#150;3 by <span class="italic">An Encyclopaedia of Cottage, Farm, and Villa Architecture and Furniture</span>.<br>
<br>In 1835 Loudon designed a small public garden at an unnamed location, which has been identified as Gravesend, Kent; the site, although built over in the 1870s, marked his practical involvement with the movement in favour of creating public walks and gardens for the country's congested towns. In 1839 he was commissioned by Joseph Strutt to design a public garden for Derby; the 11 acre Derby Arboretum was opened in 1840, and Loudon published a book about its design in the same year.<br>
<br>Two publishing projects occupied Loudon between the years 1836 and 1838. The first of these was <span class="italic">The Suburban Gardener and Villa Companion</span> (1838). Much of the material had been published in the <span class="italic">Gardener's Magazine</span>; additional material from that source was included in the second, posthumous, edition of 1850 (retitled <span class="italic">The Villa Gardener</span>). A sequel devoted to practical gardening, mostly dealing with the kitchen garden, was published in 1842 as <span class="italic">The Suburban Horticulturist</span>.<br>
<br>The second project was the <span class="italic">Arboretum et fruticetum Britannicum</span> (1838), a survey on a scale never before attempted of all the trees grown in the British Isles, whether native or exotic. Again, John Lindley provided botanical assistance. The illustrations for the <span class="italic">Arboretum</span> required the employment of seven artists, including James De Carle Sowerby and G. R. Lewis and H. W. Jukes, both of whom were employed by the owners of the estates where the trees were drawn. Even with Jane acting as amanuensis, the expenses of its production left Loudon &pound;10,000 in debt. He placed his other publications in Longmans' hands as a pledge for the debt, and, by the end of 1841, when financial depression hit the book trade, the debt was reduced to &pound;2600. Loudon compiled two smaller publications from the text of the <span class="italic">Arboretum</span>: the <span class="italic">Hortus lignosus Londinensis</span> (1838) and the <span class="italic">Encyclopaedia of Trees and Shrubs</span> (1842).<br>
<br>In 1840, besides another continental tour, Loudon undertook the editing, in a handy, inexpensive, and pocket-sized volume, of <span class="italic">The Landscape Gardening and Landscape Architecture of the Late Humphry Repton</span>. He also, for several months in 1840&#150;41, conducted the horticultural department of the weekly newspaper the <span class="italic">Gardener's Gazette</span>, founded in 1837 by his rival George Glenny, who had been ousted from editorship by the publishers. In 1841 he laid out the grounds of Castle Kennedy, Stranraer.<h2>
<a name="Cemeteries"></a>Cemeteries</h2>The last direction which Loudon found for his talents was the creation of cemeteries. In 1842, with Edward Buckton Lamb as his architect, he designed the Histon Road cemetery in Cambridge, which was laid out on a strict grid plan to facilitate the location of graves, and was planted with specimen trees, mostly evergreen, arranged geometrically. A series of articles on cemetery design, criticizing various aspects of the layout and management of the new cemeteries which had been opened in the preceding twenty years, and advocating grid layout and evergreen planting, was published in the <span class="italic">Gardener's Magazine</span> in 1843, to be published towards the end of the year as <span class="italic">On the Planting, Managing, and Laying out of Cemeteries</span>. Loudon's financial difficulties led him to accept two commissions for cemeteries in 1843, one for a private company (Bath Abbey cemetery) and one for a local authority (Southampton cemetery). He saw neither project to completion, and his plans for Southampton were the subject of much controversy with the council.<br>
<br>Loudon had suffered inflammation of the lungs in 1842, which left him in declining condition throughout 1843. Despite his poor health, he was overworking frantically in an attempt to work off his debt resulting from the <span class="italic">Arboretum</span>, for one of the creditors, the engraver (whose name does not appear in the work), became bankrupt, and his assignees threatened to arrest Loudon for the required sum of &pound;1500. The other creditors refused their consent to the threat, and on 1 December Longmans issued a plea for the sale of additional copies of the <span class="italic">Arboretum</span> to help clear the debt (copies to the value of &pound;300 were sold in the next two weeks). Loudon was working simultaneously on plans for Coleshill House, Berkshire, and his two cemeteries, when he was taken ill on a visit to the Isle of Wight. Not long after returning to London he died at his home, 3 Porchester Terrace, on 14 December 1843; his death certificate attributed his death to chronic bronchitis. He was buried in Kensal Green cemetery on 21 December. A public meeting was held in February 1844 to raise funds to clear the remaining debt, and Sir Robert Peel provided Mrs Loudon with an annuity. Loudon's last work, <span class="italic">Self-Instruction for Young Gardeners</span>, was published in 1845, with a biographical notice by his widow.<br>
