<span class="headword">Dixey,  John</span>  (1763&#150;1820), <span class="occ">sculptor and modeller</span>, was born on 19 August 1763 in Dublin but spent the vast majority of his life outside Ireland. Of his parents, nothing is known. As a young man he moved to London in order to study at the Royal Academy Schools, which he entered as a painter on 29 October 1784 at the age of twenty-one. His industry and talent earned him a Royal Academy visiting scholarship to Italy, where he was intended to finish his aesthetic education. In 1789, however, when he was about to leave for Italy, he was offered a position in the United States, which was sufficient to induce him to emigrate immediately, and he abandoned his prestigious scholarship.<br>
<br>On arrival in the United States, Dixey settled first in New York city, where he worked as a carver and gilder, and then in Pennsylvania, where he became a leading light on the American aesthetic scene, devoting himself assiduously to the promotion and resurrection of the arts. He exhibited at both the American and Pennsylvania academies. In the early 1810s his manifold efforts were rewarded when he was elected vice-president of the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts. Alongside his administrative endeavours he also worked prolifically as an architectural sculptor, principally employed in the ornamental and decorative embellishment of various important civic and private buildings, including New York city hall and the state house at Albany, New York, for both of which he executed a statue of Justice. While in the United States he also executed some free-standing sculptural groups. His copy of Giuseppe Ceracchi's bust of Alexander Hamilton, the secretary of the treasury, is in the collection of the New York Historical Society. Although scarcely known in England, Dixey had a quiet yet good reputation in both Ireland and the United States until the early decades of the twentieth century. His name was kept alive after his death in New York city in 1820 by his son George Dixey, who adopted his father's profession as a modeller, and his second son, John V. Dixey, who was both a modeller and a proficient landscape painter.<br>
