<span class="headword">Gurney,  Mary</span>  (1836&#150;1917), <span class="occ">educationist</span>, was born at Denmark Hill, London, the elder daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/11770/', "Joseph Gurney (1804&#150;1879)")</script>, parliamentary shorthand writer, and his first wife, Emma (<i>d</i>. 1842), daughter of E. Rawlings. In addition to her brother, William, and younger sister, Amelia, she had an unknown number of half-sisters, the daughters of her father's second marriage, to Harriet Tritton. Her upbringing following her mother's early death was presumably supervised by her father, a self-taught biblical scholar whose thirst for knowledge she certainly inherited. As a girl she taught herself Latin, Greek, and Italian, subjects unlikely to have been on offer at the school, Wincobank Hall, near Rotherham, Yorkshire, which she is said to have attended for &#145;a short period&#146;  (Magnus, <span class="italic">Mary Gurney</span>, 13); later, like her father, she used time spent on bus journeys to learn German, and later still acquired a working knowledge of Spanish. At home she took on, evidently with great verve, the early education of her half-sisters; many years later one of them, Catherine Gurney, recalled &#145;weeping miserably&#146; when governesses came to take her place. Still living at home, she turned to voluntary work, becoming secretary of Wandsworth British Girls' School, an elementary school run by the British and Foreign School Society.<br>
<br>It cannot have been accidental that a school was the object of Mary Gurney's first endeavours: &#145;an educational enthusiasm&#146;, she declared not many years later, &#145;has always been part of myself&#146;  (Ridley, 123). In 1871 she made contact with fellow enthusiasts whose efforts were directed towards providing an affirmative answer to the question she asked in a paper delivered to the Social Science Congress at Leeds in September of that year: &#145;Are we to have education for our middle-class girls?&#146; (reprinted in <span class="italic">The Education Papers: Women's Quest for Equality in Britain, 1850&#150;1912</span>, ed. D. Spender, 1987). By &#145;middle-class&#146; she meant &#145;the mass of girls between &#147;the young ladies&#148; whose parents pay &pound;80 to &pound;100, or even &pound;200 or &pound;300 per annum for instruction principally in so-called accomplishments, and girls trained in elementary schools on payment of 1d or 2d weekly&#146;. In November, with encouragement from Frances Mary Buss, she joined the newly launched National Union for the Improvement of the Education of Women of All Classes, the brainchild of Maria Grey. She was promptly elected to its organizing committee and a year later to the council appointed to carry out the union's most urgent and most enduring project, the establishment of &#145;good and cheap day schools for girls&#146;; these were to be financially self-supporting, although the initial capital would come from interest-bearing shares purchased by well-wishers. This scheme was put into practice through the formation of the Girls' Public Day School Company Ltd (GPDSC), launched in June 1872; the first school opened in Chelsea (it later migrated to Kensington) the following January.<br>
<br>Mary Gurney served on the council of the GPDSC (or GPDST as it became after reconstitution in 1905 as a trust) from 1872 until her death in 1917, and was an influential member of its small but powerful education committee, of which she was chair from 1897 to 1913. While her father was still alive she continued to live at home, which from about 1872 was Tyndale Lodge, near Wimbledon Common. But after his death in 1879, and apparently under no necessity to earn her own living, she set up house with her sister Amelia (neither of them married) in Kensington, within easy reach of the company's office in central London and a convenient starting point for countless journeys on the company's business. Having done much to promote the rapid proliferation of GPDSC high schools in London and its outskirts, but also countrywide&#151;at one point in the mid-1890s there were more than thirty, divided almost equally between London and the provinces&#151;she still contrived to devote personal attention to each, while keeping in view the interests and objectives of the operation as a whole. Recognizing the greater good, she did not vote against the closure of schools which proved unviable, but for sentimental reasons could never be persuaded to vote in favour. She fully supported the council's policy of maintaining a tight control over the schools and saw to it that weaknesses revealed by inspection reports, examination results, and returns of pupil numbers received immediate attention. In 1894, in tandem with the chairman of the GPDSC, W. H. Stone, she gave evidence to the royal commission on secondary education chaired by James Bryce, and in 1899 contributed to a volume of short essays, <span class="italic">What is Secondary Education?</span>, edited by Robert Pickett Scott.<br>
<br>Mary Gurney acted as mentor to a long succession of GPDSC headmistresses, in whose appointment she played a decisive part. Beneficiaries of her wisdom and sympathy, they usually accepted her occasional criticism in the professional spirit with which it was offered; she could, indeed, have been one of their number. She also served on the councils of the Maria Grey Training College, the Teachers' Training and Registration Society, and the London Society for the Extension of University Teaching; she was a governor of Cheltenham Ladies' College and of Princess Helena College. She was interested in the Froebel movement, joined the committee of the Froebel Society, and under the title <span class="italic">Kindergarten Practice</span> (1877) published her translation of a work by one of his followers, A. Koehler; she also translated scholarly articles from French, German, Spanish, and Italian, which appeared in journals such as <span class="italic">The Antiquary</span>. She signed the 1885 petition to the House of Lords in favour of the enfranchisement of women householders. In lending her support to the movement for the higher education of women she rejected the notion of a &#145;women's university&#146; and in 1894 became a member of the governing body of Girton College, Cambridge, her cousin once removed, Russell Gurney, having been a supporter of Emily Davies, the founder of the college. With her sister, Amelia, she gave &pound;1000 for extensions to the chemical laboratory, and their combined bequests to the college eventually amounted to almost &pound;30,000. Privately, she gave financial help to promising scholars, whether at Girton or in the high schools; some doubtless fell into both categories.<br>
<br>Strong-minded, with a countenance to match, Mary Gurney was also tender-hearted and given to hospitality. She was an outstanding example of the cultivated single woman, continually developing her appreciation of music, painting, and architecture through travel and wide reading. She applied herself with equal diligence and success to the multiplication of seriously intentioned schools for girls at a time when few models were at hand and &#145;experience had often to be dearly bought&#146;  (<span class="roman">Memorial leaflet</span>, 1917, GPDST Archives). Her posthumous recognition as one of the four founders of the GPDST, the others being Maria Grey, Emily Shirreff, and Lady Stanley of Alderley, was no more than she deserved. Mary Gurney died at her home, 69 Ennismore Gardens, Kensington, on 8 October 1917 and was buried in Putney Vale cemetery. She bequeathed &pound;500 to the GPDST to found a leaving scholarship.<br>
