<span class="headword">Gross,  William  Mayer-</span>  (1889&#150;1961), <span class="occ">psychiatrist</span>, was born on 15 January 1889 in Bingen am Rhein, Germany, the son of Max Mayer, trader, and Mathilde Gross; his forename at birth was Willy. He was educated at a local preparatory school, then at the <i>Gymnasium</i> in Worms, and studied medicine at Heidelberg, Kiel, and Munich. He qualified in medicine at Heidelberg University in 1912 and presented his doctoral thesis in the following year, having become an assistant in the Heidelberg Psychiatric Clinic. In 1914, he was called up and served for a year on the western front during the First World War before being transferred to a base hospital for psychiatric casualties at Heidelberg.<br>
<br>Mayer-Gross married in 1919 and had one son. After the war, he was one of a group of younger psychiatrists who studied the phenomenology of mental illness by observation and interview, leading to improvement in clinical methods, the delimitation of syndromes, and better understanding of the interaction between personality and the pathological process. This &#145;Heidelberg school&#146; became influential, but also controversial, since it departed from the previous emphasis of trying to discover the causes of psychosis by physical investigation. Mayer-Gross was co-founder of the journal <span class="italic">Nervenarzt</span> in 1928 and was appointed professor <i>extraordinarius</i> in 1929. He also contributed an extensive and important section on clinical aspects of schizophrenia to Oswald Bumke's <span class="italic">Lehrbuch der Geisteskrankheiten</span> (1924). This presentation of the symptoms, cause, and diagnosis of the disorder has been described as &#145;a triumph of knowledge and sustained effort&#146;  (Lewis).<br>
<br>After the Nazi seizure of power Mayer-Gross was able to come to England in 1933, with the help of the Commonwealth Fund, which provided a clinical fellowship at the Maudsley Hospital, London. This was continued by the Rockefeller Foundation, who also brought over Eric Guttman and Alfred Meyer. These immigrants contributed greatly to the academic, clinical, and research activities of the Maudsley, which was then the only university postgraduate psychiatric centre in England. They showed how rigorous methods could be applied to clinical research, and they provided a conceptual framework more suitable for research than anything which could be derived from Meyerian psychobiology, which had strongly influenced the institution up to then. In 1939 Mayer-Gross was appointed director of research at Crichton Royal Hospital, Dumfries; he requalified in medicine at the Scottish royal colleges and became a naturalized British subject, changing his first name to William. Although without any university affiliation, the hospital was well endowed and its facilities were of an exceptionally high standard. Mayer-Gross pursued an active programme of research, which had been fragmentary up to then, and his work had a stimulating effect on psychiatry throughout Scotland. He also wrote the first modern British postgraduate textbook of psychiatry, together with Eliot Slater and Martin Roth; <span class="italic">Clinical Psychiatry</span> was published in 1954.<br>
<br>Mayer-Gross retired as a consultant in 1955 and became senior fellow in a new department of experimental psychiatry in Birmingham, which up to then had had no academic or research activities in psychiatry. Not long afterwards the head of the department moved to the United States and Mayer-Gross took over its direction. He also headed research at the Uffculme Clinic, which he had helped to found; this was one of the first units in Britain focused on psychotherapeutic treatment. For two periods, he represented the World Health Organization in India, where he helped to establish a teaching and research centre at Bangalore. He was also guest professor at Munich and Hamburg. Mayer-Gross was elected FRCP in 1951 and president of the section of psychiatry of the Royal Society of Medicine in 1954. His nature was generous and direct and entirely free from rancour. He had both immense energies for remarkable productivity and unflagging interest, enthusiasm, and industry. Without ever having held a university teaching post in Britain, he was more influential on younger psychiatrists than any other teacher of his time. Mayer-Gross died in Dudley Road Hospital, Birmingham, on 15 February 1961, shortly after Heidelberg University had invited him to return and direct a new psychopharmacological laboratory.<br>
