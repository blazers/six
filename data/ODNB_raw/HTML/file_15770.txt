</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Knowles,  James Sheridan</span>  (1784&#150;1862), <span class="occ">playwright</span>, was born at Cork on 12 May 1784, the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15769/', "James Knowles (1759&#150;1840)")</script>, lexicographer, and his first wife, Jane (<i>d</i>. 1800), daughter of Andrew Peace, medical practitioner of Cork, and widow of a Mr Daunt. Richard Brinsley Sheridan, from whom he derived his second name, was his father's first cousin. At the age of six Knowles was placed in his father's school at Cork, but in 1793 moved with the family to London. There he made early efforts in verse, and at the age of twelve attempted a play, in which he acted with his juvenile companions, as well as the libretto of an opera on the story of the chevalier de Grillon. A few months later he wrote &#145;The Welch Harper&#146;, a ballad which was set to music and became popular. He was befriended by William Hazlitt, an acquaintance of the family, who helped him with advice and introduced him to Samuel Taylor Coleridge and Charles Lamb.<br>
<br>Knowles's mother, from whom he received much encouragement, died in 1800; and on his father's second marriage soon afterwards, to a Miss Maxwell, Knowles, unable to agree with his stepmother, impulsively left home and lived for some time from hand to mouth, helped by his friends. During this period he served as an ensign in the Wiltshire militia, and afterwards (1805) in the Tower Hamlets militia, before studying medicine under Dr Willan, taking the degree of MD from the University of Aberdeen, and becoming resident vaccinator to the Jennerian Society. Meanwhile he was writing small tragedies and &#145;dabbling in private theatricals&#146;. By 1808 he had abandoned medicine and taken to the provincial stage. He probably made his first appearance at Bath. Subsequently he played Hamlet with little success at the Crow Street Theatre, Dublin. In a company at Wexford he met, and on 25 October 1809 married, Maria Charteris (<i>d</i>. 1841) of Edinburgh. They acted together in Cherry's company at Waterford, and there Knowles made the acquaintance of Edmund Kean, for whom he wrote <span class="italic">Leo, or, The Gipsy</span> (1810), which was well received at the Waterford Theatre. In the same year he published <span class="italic">Fugitive Pieces</span>, a small volume of poems. After a season in Swansea, where his eldest son was born, Knowles acted in Belfast. There he wrote and performed in a highly charged drama called <span class="italic">Brian Boroihme, or, The Maid of Erin</span> (1811), which proved very popular.<br>
<br>But these efforts produced a very small income, and Knowles was driven to seek a living by teaching. He opened a school of his own in Belfast, and assembled for his pupils a series of extracts for declamation under the title of <span class="italic">The Elocutionist</span>, which ran through many editions. In 1813 he was invited to offer himself for the post of first headmaster in English subjects in the Belfast Academical Institution; but he declined this appointment in favour of his father, contenting himself with the position of assistant. Three years later the dismissal of his father made it necessary for the son to leave Belfast, and Knowles moved to Glasgow, where he established and ran a school for nearly twelve years.<br>
<br>On 13 February 1815 Knowles's tragedy <span class="italic">Caius Gracchus</span> had been greeted as a work of genius in Belfast. It demonstrated, at least, a sensitive response to Shakespeare's <span class="italic">Coriolanus</span>. Edmund Kean saw in it the promise of meaty parts in contemporary tragedy, and suggested to Knowles a play on the subject of Virginius. Though at this period he was teaching thirteen hours a day, Knowles wrote the drama in three months; but by the time it was ready Kean had accepted another play on the same theme. Knowles, having waited in hope until 1820, produced <span class="italic">Virginius</span> in Glasgow, where John Tait, a friend of William Charles Macready, saw it, and urged Macready to read it. This marked the beginning of a tumultuous relationship which would last over twenty years and see the production of seven of Knowles's plays. <span class="italic">Virginius</span>, performed at Covent Garden on 17 May 1820, with Macready in the title role, was the first. Excited reviewers wrote of a dramatic renaissance, recognizing in Knowles's mixture of Roman grandiloquence and English domesticity a new and distinctive voice. Among the congratulations which Knowles received was one in verse from Charles Lamb. Knowles then remodelled his <span class="italic">Caius Gracchus</span>, and Macready staged it at Covent Garden on 18 November 1823. A decorous adaptation of Massinger's <span class="italic">The Fatal Dowry</span> followed, and then, at Macready's suggestion, <span class="italic">William Tell</span>, which opened at Drury Lane on 11 May 1825. Playwright and actor shared an interest in the portrayal of devoted fathers, and exploited it to their mutual advantage. In <span class="italic">The Spirit of the Age</span> (1825), Hazlitt pronounced Knowles the finest writer of his time, and there was a chorus of agreement in the theatrical journals. But Knowles made little money by his dramatic successes. In 1823 and 1824 he added to his income by conducting the literary department of the <span class="italic">Free Press</span>, a Glasgow paper which advocated liberal and social reform. His school did not prosper, and he began lecturing on oratory and drama, earning the praises of John Wilson (Christopher North) in the <span class="italic">Noctes Ambrosianae</span>.<br>
<br>Knowles's first comedy, <span class="italic">The Beggar's Daughter of Bethnal Green</span>, was produced at Drury Lane on 22 November 1828. It was based on the well-known ballad, which had already inspired a play by Henry Chettle and John Day (written about 1600, and printed in London, 1659). Though expectation ran high, the play was damned at the first performance, according to Knowles's defenders because of the malicious actions of a claque from the temporarily closed Covent Garden. In a reworked version, it held the stage for a further fifty years. In 1830 Knowles left Glasgow with his wife and their son, and settled in Newhaven, near Edinburgh, and there, while working at a new comedy, he put the last touches to his <span class="italic">Alfred the Great, or, The Patriot King</span>. This opened at Drury Lane on 28 April 1831 with Macready in the title role and owed its success to the audience's sentimental attachment to the legendary hero-king. It is among the weakest of Knowles's twenty published plays.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">The Hunchback</span>, a much better play, was initially accepted by the authorities at Drury Lane, but Macready asked for changes, and his hesitation over the revised text caused a breach between the two men. Knowles demanded the return of his manuscript, and took it to Charles Kemble at Covent Garden. It was produced there on 5 April 1832, with Knowles himself in the part of Master Walter. According to Westland Marston, this was Knowles's favourite among his plays, but even so friendly a critic as Marston could find little beyond fervour and sincerity to praise in Knowles's acting, &#145;which did not gain in charm by the addition of a strong Irish brogue&#146;  (Marston, 268). <span class="italic">The Hunchback</span> was a great success, and enjoyed an almost uninterrupted run until the end of the season, but Knowles's acting did not meet with much approval. On taking <span class="italic">The Hunchback</span> to Glasgow and Edinburgh, he was received with enthusiasm by his former friends and pupils. When his next important play, <span class="italic">The Wife</span>, was brought out at Covent Garden on 24 April 1833, Charles Lamb wrote both prologue and epilogue. In this, his prime, Knowles was widely recognized as the leading dramatist of the day.<br>
<br>On 10 September 1837 <span class="italic">The Love Chase</span>, Knowles's second comedy, and perhaps his best play, opened at the Haymarket. Like <span class="italic">Old Maids</span> (1841), it is an adroitly plotted story of three contrasting courtships, witty enough to merit revival. Those of his friends who found Knowles's moral gravity excessive were quick to celebrate his comic skills.<br>
<br>Knowles, despite much adverse criticism, continued to act until 1843, and by his own account was well paid for it. He acted as Macbeth at the Coburg, and in some of his own plays at Covent Garden, where Macready found him &#145;raw, energetic, harsh, but with mind and purpose&#146;  (<span class="italic">Diaries</span>, 1.45). After Knowles's successful tour of America in 1834, Macready's attitude to him changed, not least because of Knowles's flagrant parading of his young prot&eacute;g&eacute;e Emma Marian Maria Elphinstone, who had returned from America with him in 1835, and whom he married on 23 July 1842, the year after the death of his first wife. The relationship was further strained when Knowles was credited with <span class="italic">The Bridal</span> (1837), an adaptation (and bowdlerization) of Beaumont and Fletcher's <span class="italic">The Maid's Tragedy</span> (1610&#150;11), which was more Macready's than Knowles's. Literary fame had probably turned Knowles's head. Few of the dozen plays he wrote between 1836 and his abandonment of the theatre in 1844 enhanced his reputation; nor did the publication of two quickly forgotten novels, <span class="italic">Fortescue</span> (1846) and <span class="italic">George Lovell</span> (1847).<br>
<br>It is not difficult to detect signs of religious fervour in Knowles's writing, but his contemporaries were startled when, in 1844, he began a new career as a Baptist preacher. His intentions were evangelical, but his style remained histrionic, and he retained a fondness for the theatre. He was on the committee that engineered the purchase of Shakespeare's birthplace, and it was reported in 1848, when the purchase was completed, that the custodianship was offered to him. He never filled the office, but at his death the trustees of the birthplace recorded their belief that he had been in receipt of the dividends of &pound;1500, invested in the names of Forster and Dickens, &#145;for the ostensible purpose of founding a custodianship of the birthplace&#146;, and enquiries were made into the investment and appropriation of the dividends  (extract from trustees' minute book, 31 Dec 1862).<br>
<br>Financial anxiety was a familiar demon to Knowles, who had made strenuous efforts to discharge his father's debts. Having rejected the offer of a civil-list pension of &pound;100 in 1847, he accepted one of &pound;200 in 1848. He now entered into religious controversy with the publication, in 1851, of <span class="italic">The idol demolished by its own priest: an answer to Cardinal Newman's lectures on transubstantiation</span>. Himself a sufferer from rheumatism, he was also an active promoter of the water cure, and an admired itinerant preacher almost until his death. His native city of Cork honoured him at a banquet early in 1862, and on 30 November 1862 he died in Torquay. He was buried in the Glasgow necropolis. He was survived by his son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15775/', "Richard Brinsley Knowles (1820&#150;1882)")</script>, who produced a privately printed <span class="italic">Life of James Sheridan Knowles</span> in 1872. Two volumes of <span class="italic">Lectures on Dramatic Literature</span> were published posthumously in 1873.<br>
