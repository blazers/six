<span class="headword">Percy,  Thomas</span>  (1768&#150;1808), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, the eldest child of Anthony Percy (1731&#150;1795), merchant, and his wife, Mary Mason (<i>d</i>. 1795), was born in Southwark on 13 September 1768. He was the nephew of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21959/', "Bishop Thomas Percy (1729&#150;1811)")</script>, for whom he was named. He began to write poetry in his early years at Merchant Taylors' School, where he was a pupil from 1775 to 1785. Daines Barrington relates that by the age of nine Percy had composed not only a ballad which was set to music by the composer Samuel Wesley, but also the first canto of an epic poem on Caesar's invasion of Britain. In this work, says Barrington:<blockquote>there are strong marks of a most early genius for poetry, which he likewise recites admirably well upon the first stool you may place him. I asked this wonderful boy how many books he intended to divide his Epic Poem into; when he answered, that he could not well bring all his matter into less than twenty-four. (Barrington, 308)</blockquote>Two short poems written by Percy at the age of nine or ten were published in the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> in the years 1778&#150;9. Another of pamphlet length, <span class="italic">Verses on the Death of Dr. Samuel Johnson</span> (1785), was printed anonymously at the expense of his uncle, Bishop Percy. His precocity showed itself not only in the private work of composition, but also in his leading role in the organization of a literary society, the &#145;Council of Parnassus&#146;, formed with the aim of reciting and criticizing its members' verses in public. This group's main achievement was the publication, supervised by the fifteen-year-old Percy, of a volume titled <span class="italic">Poems by a Literary Society</span> in 1784.<br>
<br>These juvenile exploits seem to have exhausted Percy's poetic energies: apart from some verses in the <span class="italic">Poetical Register</span>, this completes the list of his literary publications. He matriculated at St John's College, Oxford, on 27 June 1786, graduated BCL at Oxford in 1792, became a fellow of his college in the same year, and proceeded DCL in 1797, having previously in 1793 been presented to the vicarage of Grays Thurrock in Essex.<br>
<br>In 1795 Percy was the ostensible editor of the fourth edition of his uncle's <span class="italic">Reliques of Ancient English Poetry</span>. Though it is the only achievement for which he is remembered, this editorship was no more than a polite fiction arranged by his uncle, whose collection of ballads and other early English verse had become extremely popular since its first publication in 1764. Created bishop of Dromore in 1782, Percy's uncle felt himself unable to acknowledge his continuing interest in the frivolities of poetry, and unwilling to engage in public controversy over the authenticity of his manuscript texts, even if friends urged him to issue a new edition, and even if his detractors, notably Joseph Ritson, ought to be answered. Perhaps the bishop had also hoped that after the death of his son in 1783 he would find in his nephew a congenial spirit to take over the editing under his guidance. He was eventually disappointed, and the editorial work was evidently undertaken by the bishop himself, as was the composition of a prefatory advertisement for putting his name to which Percy received a share in the book's profits. This dissociated the bishop firmly from a work that, it claimed, &#145;the original editor had no desire to revive [because] more important pursuits had &hellip; engaged his attention&#146;  (Percy, 1.ix). The fourth edition was the definitive form of this highly influential collection for over fifty years, and hence the vehicle through which the younger Thomas Percy's name became widely known.<br>
<br>Although his uncle placed opportunities for other editorial projects in Percy's way around this time, nothing came of them, probably because his interest was lukewarm. Nevertheless, he was installed on 3 December 1796 as rector of one of the bishop's churches, at Magheralin in the diocese of Dromore, Down, and simultaneously as precentor of Dromore Cathedral, a sinecure paying &pound;500 per annum. This appointment served to forestall legal action by his former parishioners at Grays Thurrock, who were about to bring a suit against him for his neglect of the church's fabric; but it prevented his free movement back to England, where he was liable to prosecution.<br>
<br>Little is known of Percy's last decade, which seems not to have been happy. He died, unmarried, at Ecton, near Northampton, on 14 May 1808, of what the obituary written by his uncle describes as &#145;a fever, which baffled all medical skill&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>).<br>
