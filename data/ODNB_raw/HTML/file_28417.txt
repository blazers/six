<span class="headword">Wakefield,  William Hayward</span>  (1801&#150;1848), <span class="occ">colonist in New Zealand</span>, was born at Burnham, Essex, on 8 August 1801, the fifth of the ten children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28414/', "Edward Wakefield (1774&#150;1854)")</script>, a farmer, and his wife, Susanna Crash (<i>d</i>. 1817). He was educated at Haigh's School, Tottenham, Middlesex, and was later attached to the British embassy in Turin. On 23 March 1826, in Paris, he married Emily Elizabeth, the daughter of Sir John Shelley Sidney. For assisting his brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28415/', "Edward Gibbon Wakefield")</script> in the abduction of Ellen Turner in 1826 he was sentenced in 1827 to three years' imprisonment in Lancaster Castle. Emily died on 12 August 1827; a daughter, Emily Charlotte, had been born in February that year. From 1832 to 1834 Wakefield served in the Portuguese army, where he was made a knight of the order of the Tower and Sword. He then joined the British Auxiliary Legion of Spain, and in 1837 attained the rank of colonel. He commanded the 1st regiment of lancers in 1836&#150;7 and the 3rd legion in 1837&#150;8. For distinguished service he was created a knight of the order of San Fernando.<br>
<br>In May 1839 Wakefield sailed in the <i>Tory</i> to New Zealand as the leader of the New Zealand Land Company's preliminary expedition. On 27 September he purchased the site for the company's settlement at Port Nicholson (Wellington harbour), and by 8 November had bought large areas on both sides of Cook Strait. In all, he acquired nominally about 20 million acres from the Maori in exchange for goods such as muskets, umbrellas, and Jews' harps. Acting on the express directions of the company, he reserved a tenth of his purchases for the Maori chiefs. These transactions, and the departure of the first emigrant ships in September 1839, took place before Britain had assumed sovereignty over New Zealand. Realizing the immigrants would lack British protection, the company appointed a committee, with Wakefield as president, to maintain order in the new settlement. The committee functioned after the settlers arrived in early 1840, but following the signing of the treaty of Waitangi on 6 February that year Lieutenant-Governor Hobson began acquiring sovereignty for the crown from the Maori chiefs. On hearing of the committee's activities on 21 May he immediately proclaimed sovereignty over the whole country, and on 23 May declared the committee illegal.<br>
<br>Meanwhile, the validity of the company's land purchases was being questioned. According to the system of Maori land tenure, any transfer of territory required the express and public sanction of every member of the tribe, including those temporarily absent. In his haste to acquire land, Wakefield had on occasions ignored this condition, which rendered his title invalid according to Maori custom. Moreover, on 14 January 1840 Hobson's superior, Sir George Gipps, had issued a proclamation announcing that commissioners would be appointed to investigate past purchases of Maori land. A commissioner from Britain began investigating the company's claims in 1842. At Wakefield's suggestion it was agreed that the commissioner would also decide where compensation was due to the Maori. Wakefield none the less obstructed the investigations until 1843, when tension over land in the Wairau district led to a tragic clash between Maori and a group of Nelson settlers. During the investigations it became clear that Wakefield's principal interpreter had had difficulty translating the deeds of purchase and that many Maori had not understood the implications of the transactions. In 1845 the company's entitlement was cut to 266,400 acres and the Maori were awarded &pound;3500 compensation.<br>
<br>The land problem affected race relations and political life in the company's settlements for some years. In March 1847 the <span class="italic">Wellington Independent</span> strongly attacked the company's land policy, sparking off a duel between Wakefield and the editor, Isaac Earl Featherston. After Featherston had fired and missed, Wakefield fired into the air, commenting that he would not kill a man with seven daughters.<br>
<br>Wakefield was a member of the general legislative council of New Zealand in 1841. As the company's principal agent he supervised the settlements at Wellington, Wanganui, Nelson, and New Plymouth, and investigated sites for the New Edinburgh settlement at Otago. A connoisseur of cigars, cheroots, and continental wines, he was regarded by contemporaries as a shrewd negotiator and a competent administrator. Called &#145;Wideawake&#146; by the Maori, he was known among the colonists for his reticence: no one knew what he really thought or meant to do. He died of apoplexy in Wellington on 19 September 1848, and was buried on 22 September in the city's Bolton Street cemetery. He was survived by his daughter, who in 1846 had married Edward William Stafford, a future premier of New Zealand.<br>
<br>William Hayward Wakefield's elder brother, <a name="cosubject_28412"></a><span class="headword">Arthur Wakefield</span>  (1799&#150;1843), <span class="occ">colonist in New Zealand</span>, was born at Burnham on 19 November 1799 and entered the navy in 1810. He served at Batavia, and in the Atlantic and Mediterranean, and rose to the rank of captain. In 1841 he became agent for the New Zealand Company's projected Nelson settlement. After selecting the site in November, he set about establishing the settlement. As he required more land for the growing number of settlers he sent surveyors to the Wairau district, Marlborough, in April 1843. The company's claim to the land was disputed by the Maori chiefs Te Rauparaha and Te Rangihaeata and was awaiting investigation by the land commissioner. Upset by interference with the survey, Wakefield attempted to arrest the chiefs on 17 June. In the fighting which broke out at Tuamarina that day about six Maori and twenty-two Europeans, including Wakefield, were killed. He was buried there on 23 June.<br>
<br>William Hayward and Arthur's younger brother, <a name="cosubject_28417"></a><span class="headword">Felix Wakefield</span>  (1807&#150;1875), <span class="occ">engineer</span>, born in Norfolk, married about 1830, in France, Marie Felicie Eliza Bailli, with whom he had nine children. In the early 1830s he became superintendent of public works in Van Diemen's Land. After returning to England in 1847, he assisted his brother Edward Gibbon Wakefield in his colonizing schemes. His report <span class="italic">Colonial Surveying with a View to the Disposal of Waste Land</span>, prepared for the New Zealand Company, was published in 1849. He joined the Canterbury settlement in New Zealand in 1851 and farmed near Christchurch. In 1854 he became principal superintendent of the Army Works Corps in the Crimea, with the rank of lieutenant-colonel, and built the railway from Balaklava to Sevastopol. Following his return to New Zealand in 1863 he was secretary to the government agent on the Otago goldfields from 1867 to 1870. A keen horticulturist, he published <span class="italic">The Gardener's Chronicle for New Zealand</span> (1870). He died at Sumner, Canterbury, on 23 December 1875, and was buried on 26 December in Christchurch cemetery.<br>
