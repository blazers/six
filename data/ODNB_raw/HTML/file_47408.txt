<span class="headword">Vaughan,  Cuthbert</span>  (<em>c.</em>1519&#150;1563), <span class="occ">soldier</span>, is of unknown parentage. He began his military career in 1546, serving as a captain at Boulogne. One year later he was a captain at the siege of Leith. He continued this military service during Edward's reign, for which he was rewarded in late 1551 with the office of bailiff of the lordships of Marche and Oye in Calais. During Mary's reign he was involved in Wyatt's rebellion: on 13 February 1554 he was indicted at Westminster for offences committed in Middlesex, and for marching to London in order to seize the Tower. For this he was condemned to death. He then provided evidence against another of the rebels, Sir Nicholas Throckmorton, and was subsequently released on a bond of 300 crowns. He did not suffer much: although he lost some of his lands, he successfully petitioned Mary for their restoration after his release. This clemency may have been due to the intervention of Philip, who sought to reconcile many of the rebels to the state; by the end of the reign he was on Philip's pension list.<br>
<br>In 1557 Vaughan was summoned to court to raise 300 men and lead them, as captain, to Berwick; the men were mustered at Tower Hill. Several of these men deserted in Scotland but were subsequently found and hanged. For his service in Scotland he received lands and further restorations. Vaughan married Elizabeth, daughter of Thomas Roydon and Margaret Whettenhall. She survived him by more than thirty years: she died on 19 August 1595 and was buried on 15 November at East Peckham church in Kent. Vaughan was her second husband, the first being William Twysden and the third Thomas Goulding. The recusant <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/69040/', "Jane Wiseman")</script> was said to be their daughter. Early in 1558 Vaughan became involved in a land dispute with the son of his wife's first husband, Thomas Twysden. Early in Elizabeth's reign he was again sent to command at Berwick. Lord Eure, the commander there, sent him home complaining that he was insubordinate; Vaughan had refused to deliver his muster book when demanded by Eure's clerk. On his way back to court he carried a report on the state of Scotland and the protestant rebels there, a commission organized by the earl of Westmorland so that Vaughan might retain some credit. The privy council reinstated him on 21 January 1559. He then took part in the English intervention in the Scottish Reformation crisis of 1559&#150;60. In July 1559 he was sent to survey the fortifications at Aymouth, while in April 1560 he was involved in the siege of Leith. In late April he was praised for his valiant conduct in assaulting the town of Pelham, for which he received the appellation &#145;the general of Pelham&#146;, reported by Randolph  (<span class="italic">CSP Scot.</span>, <i>1547&#150;63</i>, 429&#150;30, n. 826). He was later listed as one of the captains who had served best under Lord Grey. Cecil acknowledged his good services and saw that he was rewarded with a grant of marches in Kent and Sussex.<br>
<br>In 1562 Vaughan was appointed as muster-master and comptroller of the English garrison then occupying Newhaven (Le Havre). On 28 September he and Sir Adrian Poynings left Portsmouth to take the first troops across to Newhaven. He argued over various matters with Poynings. Later rumours emerged in London that he was misappropriating money, and he was subsequently investigated, but was not charged. His work comprised musters, upkeep of fortifications, and general administration. On arrival at Newhaven he was quick to emphasize the strategic value of defending the town of Rouen. At one point he was asked to reform the church service used at the garrison: considered too radical, it was to be brought into line with the established service in England. He died on 23 July 1563, succumbing to the plague which was decimating the English garrison at Newhaven. Vaughan's religion seems to have been of the more &#145;advanced&#146; sort. It is clear that he steadfastly opposed the reintroduction of Catholicism in Mary's reign, and his subsequent exile may have been important in the development of his religious beliefs. His wife, Elizabeth, was a noted puritan patron. Moreover, in December 1562 he expressed the hope that the parliament of the next year would make a more full reform of religion than that already in use. Despite his many years of loyal and valiant service, Vaughan was not the easiest man to work with. His opinions were strong, and he was not one to back down; he quarrelled extensively with Poynings, for example, as to what the best way for the English to enter the town of Newhaven might be. His career was dogged by accusations of insubordination and fiscal misappropriation. Nothing was ever proved, however, and he was held in some esteem by Cecil. Perhaps his firm convictions aroused ill feeling in others: he seems to have been a committed protestant and a solid military man.<br>
