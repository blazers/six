<span class="headword">Brickdale, Sir  Charles  Fortescue-</span>  (1857&#150;1944), <span class="occ">barrister and land registrar</span>, was born on 1 March 1857 at 41 Victoria Street, Westminster, London, the oldest of the five children of Matthew Inglett Brickdale (1817&#150;1894), barrister and sometime radical lawyer, and of Sarah Anna (1833/4&#150;1909), daughter of Judge Edward Lloyd. At the time of Charles's birth the family name was Brickdale, and it was not until the Edwardian period that he and his siblings adopted the double-barrelled form. His sister, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/55176/', "(Mary) Eleanor Fortescue-Brickdale (1872&#150;1945)")</script>, achieved fame as a painter and stained-glass artist, and his brother, J. M. Fortescue-Brickdale (1869&#150;1921), was a physician of some note.<br>
<br>Brickdale was educated at Westminster School and Christ Church, Oxford, where he also attended the Ruskin School of Drawing and learned proficiency in drawing and etching. Following in his father's footsteps, he was called to the bar in 1883 from Lincoln's Inn and specialized in land law. He acquired his credentials as a land reformer with a short book published in 1886, <span class="italic">Registration of Title to Land and how to Establish it without Cost or Compulsion</span>. The Land Registry, set up under an act of 1862 to register and secure title to land and thus ease property transfers, the costs, complexities, and delays of which were a national scandal, had up to that time proved to be a failure. The system was a voluntary one; it was strongly opposed by conveyancing lawyers and a mere three thousand or so titles had been registered. Brickdale pointed to the success of the Australian and Prussian systems of land registration, and argued that the key was to accept that registered land would offer not &#145;indefeasible&#146; but &#145;guaranteed&#146; title.<br>
<br>In 1888 Brickdale was appointed by the lord chancellor, Lord Halsbury, as assisting barrister at the Land Registry. From this time on, as a result of his energy and thoroughness, the thrust of its activities changed. Under Halsbury's protection, Brickdale took advantage of the strong agitation of the period for land reform, notably the controversies arising from the Irish land question and the campaigns of the American Henry George (1839&#150;1897) and his English followers for the taxation of land values, to press consistently for the compulsory registration of land as the key to practical progress. After much lobbying and extensive study of the German and Austrian systems of registration and other foreign modes of tenure, Brickdale achieved this goal in the shape of the <span class="roman">Land Transfer Act</span>, 1897.<br>
<br>The conversion of a voluntary system into a compulsory one in the teeth of continued opposition from lawyers proved a formidable task, and in the event was achieved only gradually, beginning from 1899; a critical date was the extension of registration to the City of London in 1902. Brickdale was rewarded for his persistence by being appointed chief registrar in 1900, a post he held until he retired in 1923. He was the butt of fierce criticism from the Law Society, and the costs and workings of the Land Registry were among the issues investigated by the royal commission on land reform conceded by the Liberal government in 1908&#150;9. In the event Brickdale managed to turn the radicalism of the moment to advantage. In 1910 he secured Lloyd George's promise of a new &#145;<span class="roman">Domesday</span> office&#146; which would combine the Land Registry with the Ordnance Survey and the valuation department of the Inland Revenue.<br>
<br>The Liberal land-reforming tide then receded, and R. B. Haldane as lord chancellor proved less amenable to Brickdale's ambitions than had been expected. What had in effect become a competition over conveyancing between the Land Registry and the solicitors came to an end through the compromise of the <span class="roman">Law of Property Bill</span> (1922), enacted only in 1925 after Brickdale's retirement. However, during his period of office he had transformed a failure into a respected, revenue-earning department of government, housed in a handsome, purpose-built headquarters on the south side of Lincoln's Inn Fields. Brickdale himself in 1900 supplied the initial sketches for the Land Registry building, in a Jacobean style blending in with Lincoln's Inn. It was carried out by the office of works in 1903&#150;5 and 1912&#150;13, the latter phase housing also the Inland Revenue's land valuers.<br>
<br>Brickdale was typical of the more highly educated reformers of his period, earnest, single-minded, cultivated, but stubborn. In 1888 he married Mabel Beatrice Gibbs (<i>d</i>. 1944), daughter of George Louis Gibbs of the merchant banking firm Anthony Gibbs &amp; Sons; they had two sons. Most of his many publications concerned land transfer and registration; he also edited the recollections of his brother-in-law, the soldier Sir Henry Hallam Parr, in 1917. He received a knighthood in 1911. He died at Gorse Corner, Townsend Drive, St Albans, on 20 September 1944 from heart disease and senile decay and was buried at East Sheen.<br>
