<span class="headword">Oslac</span>  (<em>fl. </em>963&#150;975), <span class="occ">magnate</span>, is of unknown antecedents, but his name could be an Anglicized version of Old Norse &Aacute;sl&aacute;kr and it has been conjectured that he came from the eastern Danelaw; his son Thored was living in Cambridgeshire in the time of King Edgar. According to the chronicle attributed to John of Wallingford (a much later text of uncertain authority), the decision to divide Northumbria into two earldoms north and south of the River Tees was taken at a council held by King Edgar at York, on the death of Earl Osulf of Bamburgh. The reason given was the king's unwillingness to let the whole area come to be regarded as any one person's inheritance, &#145;lest this stir up discord due to the wishes of the Northumbrians to have their ancient liberties restored&#146;  (Vaughan, 54). The southern earldom, comprising the area from the Humber to the Tees (the old kingdom of Deira and the later county of York, with its three ridings) was given to Oslac.<br>
<br>Oslac first witnessed as earl three royal charters issued in 963, all relating to the northern Danelaw. Initially he seems to have been of only local importance and he was not in regular attendance at King Edgar's court. The <span class="roman">Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</span> (text D) says he was appointed as earl in 966, but the date is almost certainly mistaken. Apart from a group of three doubtful Abingdon charters which claim to be dated 965, Oslac does not witness surviving royal diplomas again until 968, but from that year onwards he became much more prominent nationally and witnessed many of Edgar's charters. John of Wallingford says that together with &AElig;lfsige, bishop of Chester-le-Street, Oslac escorted Kenneth, king of the Scots, to King Edgar's court to receive the cession of Lothian. Roger of Wendover, however, names Earl Eadwulf of Bernicia in the place of Oslac when recording this event, the exact date of which is unknown. Wendover's account is to be preferred, but both earls may have been present on this historic occasion. From 971 until 975, only four ealdormen witness royal charters consistently: &AElig;lfhere of Mercia, &AElig;thelwine of East Anglia, Brihtnoth of Essex, and Oslac of southern Northumbria. All must have held power over wide territories; between them they were entrusted with the distribution of King Edgar's fourth law code over the whole of England. An entry dated 975 in the <span class="roman">Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</span> (text D) records that &#145;the famous earl&#146; Oslac was banished from England. The B text of the chronicle (also in texts A and C) suggests that the banishment was due to the activity of the anti-monastic party after King Edgar's death. The entry concludes: &#145;The valiant man Oslac was driven from the country, over the tossing waves, the gannet's bath, the homeland of the whale; a grey-haired man, wise and skilled in speech, he was bereft of his lands&#146;  (<span class="italic">ASC</span>, s.a. 975, texts A, B, C).<br>
