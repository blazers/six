<span class="headword">Richmond, Sir  Ian Archibald</span>  (1902&#150;1965), <span class="occ">archaeologist</span>, was born on 10 May 1902 at Rochdale, Lancashire, the elder twin son of Daniel Richmond, medical practitioner, and his wife, Helen Harper. He was educated at Ruthin School and Corpus Christi College, Oxford (1920&#150;24); his first publications appeared while he was still an undergraduate. They included a study of Ptolemy's <span class="italic">Geographia</span> on northern Britain. It was therefore no surprise that, despite a third in honour moderations (1922) and a second in <i>literae humaniores</i> (1924), he was awarded the Gilchrist scholarship to the British School at Rome, the Craven fellowship, and a Goldsmiths' senior studentship. His two years in Rome (1924&#150;6), under the benevolent eye of Thomas Ashby, developed that interest in Roman military architecture and the operations of the Roman army in the field which became his major research interest, although the range of his active work in archaeology would be wider than that of most of his contemporaries. As a young excavator he served his apprenticeship, first under Mortimer Wheeler, at Segontium (Caernarfon) and then in alliance with F. G. Simpson on the Roman works at Cawthorn, Yorkshire.<br>
<br>Richmond's first major work was an outstanding monograph, <span class="italic">The City Wall of Imperial Rome</span> (1930), illustrated by his own original plans and isometric drawings, a book which was the principal issue of his residence in Rome in 1924&#150;6 and which is still a standard work. In 1926 he was appointed lecturer in classical archaeology and ancient history at the Queen's University, Belfast, a post which allowed him to spend half of each year on the continent or in Britain. Much of his summers he devoted to work on Hadrian's Wall, in conjunction with F. G. Simpson, R. G. Collingwood, and E. B. Birley. In 1930 he was the obvious choice to return to Rome as director of the British School, but two years later ill health caused him to resign. For nearly three years he was without a post, but he put his convalescence to good use, completing and seeing through the press the great work <span class="italic">The Aqueducts of Ancient Rome</span> (1935), which Thomas Ashby's premature death had left unfinished, and contributing a series of important papers on the western sector of Hadrian's Wall to the <span class="italic">Transactions</span> of the Cumberland and Westmorland Society.<br>
<br>In January 1935 Richmond was appointed to a lectureship in Romano-British history and archaeology at Armstrong College in Newcastle, part of the University of Durham. In 1938 he married Isabel Little, daughter of John Arthur Little, a woollen merchant in Newcastle upon Tyne; they had one son and one daughter. He remained in Newcastle, with a brief break for war service, until 1956. He was awarded a readership in 1943 and a personal chair in 1950, served a biennium as dean of the faculty of arts, and for several years was public orator. During his twenty-one years at Newcastle, Richmond directed a notable series of excavations, on Hadrian's Wall, at Corbridge, and at Fendoch, Newstead, and Inchtuthil in Scotland. His work at Inchtuthil, in partnership with J. K. St Joseph, continued until 1965, alongside his examination of the Roman fort at Hod Hill (Dorset) until 1958.<br>
<br>In 1956 Richmond had moved to Oxford as the first holder of the chair of the archaeology of the Roman empire with a fellowship at All Souls College. During his time there he trained and inspired many archaeologists who later achieved distinction and held major posts in the subject. In his last years he turned his attention to the Roman siege works at Masada in Israel and at Numantia in Spain. Had time allowed, he planned more work in Spain in the months before his death, though his work and advice for organizations and individuals continued unabated until the end.<br>
<br>Richmond would doubtless have written more, and more substantial, books but for his readiness to accept the countless calls upon his time. He accepted invitations from societies great and small; as he never drove a car, his travels could be protracted. When he visited one local society in the west country, he was met at a rural halt and driven to his destination by a pony and trap&#151;this in 1960. He was a very dignified and eloquent public speaker, his addresses being notable for the elevation of their style, spoken deliberately as though he was seeking the exact word to match his meaning&#151;even when the text had already been written out. But he could also lecture without notes and hold audiences in a spell. In private he would relax, full of fun and with a twinkle in his eye; there could be no greater contrast between his public and private images. A devout Anglican, he frequently attended chapel in All Souls.<br>
<br>Richmond's major books included <span class="italic">Roman Britain</span> (1947) and the first volume of the <span class="roman">Pelican History of England</span> on the same subject (1955), reissued in 1963. He edited three successive editions of John Collingwood Bruce's <span class="italic">Handbook to the Roman Wall</span> (1947, 1957, and 1966). At the time of his death he had completed a revised second edition of <span class="italic">The Archaeology of Roman Britain</span> by R. G. Collingwood, seen through the press by D. R. Wilson and published in 1969. His excavations at Hod Hill were published in 1968, those at Inchtuthil in 1985. But the great bulk of his original writings appeared in the publications of archaeological societies, particularly in <span class="italic">Archaeologia Aeliana</span> (Society of the Antiquaries of Newcastle upon Tyne) and the <span class="italic">Transactions</span> of the Cumberland and Westmorland Antiquarian and Archaeological Society, the <span class="italic">Proceedings of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland</span>, and the <span class="italic">Journal of Roman Studies</span>. His major public lecture series included the Rhind lectures in Edinburgh (1933), the Riddell memorial lectures in Newcastle (1948), the Ford lectures in Oxford (1951), and the Gray lectures in Cambridge (1952). The Riddell lectures were published in the stimulating monograph <span class="italic">Archaeology and the after-Life in Pagan and Christian Imagery</span> (1950). The Ford lectures, on Britain in the third and fourth centuries, and the Gray lectures, on the Romano-British countryside, were edited by Professor Peter Salway and published in 1969.<br>
<br>Richmond gave unstinting service to many national and local organizations. From 1944 he served on the royal commissions on historical monuments, England and Scotland, contributing massively to their reports on Roman sites, notably in the English commission's volumes on Essex and York and the Scottish volumes on the county of Roxburgh. Elected a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries in 1931, he served as director of the society in 1959&#150;64 and president from April 1964 until his death. No fellow had the interests of the society closer to his heart. He was also a pillar of the Society for the Promotion of Roman Studies, of which he was president in 1958&#150;61. He was elected FBA in 1947 and received honorary doctorates from Edinburgh, Belfast, Leeds, Newcastle, Manchester, and Cambridge, and was a member of the German Archaeological Institute. He also served as president of the Society of Antiquaries of Newcastle and of the Bristol and Gloucestershire Archaeological Society. He was appointed CBE in 1958 and knighted in 1964.<br>
<br>Ian Richmond was the most accomplished Roman archaeologist of his time and was recognized as such wherever the subject is pursued. He was as adept in reassessing earlier discoveries as in prosecuting new research aims. As an excavator he had the precious gift of visualizing how the Roman army would lay out its structures on a given site, so that his excavations could be carried out with unmatched economy of effort. His knowledge of Roman architecture and of the sculpted reliefs on the columns of Trajan and Marcus Aurelius, and on the triumphal monument at Adamklissi (Romania), added to his close familiarity with the literary sources, often caused his hearers to wonder whether he had not personally witnessed the Roman army at work. His writings were as notable as those of Francis Haverfield, his predecessor in the mastery of Romano-British archaeology, for their elegant style and for the care with which they were composed. He died at his home, 18 Farndon Road, Oxford, on 5 October 1965; he was survived by his wife.<br>
