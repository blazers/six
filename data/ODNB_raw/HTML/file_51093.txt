<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Havers,  (Robert) Michael Oldfield</span>, Baron Havers  (1923&#150;1992), <span class="occ">lawyer and politician</span>, was born on 10 March 1923 at 126 Mortlake Road, North Sheen, Surrey, the second of three sons and third of four children of Sir Cecil Robert Havers (1889&#150;1977), barrister and High Court judge, and his wife, Enid Flo (<i>d</i>. 1956), daughter of William Oldfield Snelling. His sister Dame (Ann) Elizabeth Oldfield Butler-Sloss (<i>b</i>. 1933) also practised at the bar, and became president of the Family Division of the High Court.<h2>
<a name="Educationwarserviceandearlylegalpractice"></a>Education, war service, and early legal practice</h2>Educated at Westminster School, Havers joined the Royal Navy in October 1941. While he was serving as a cadet, the converted Belgian cross-channel ship in which he was serving received a direct hit. Fortunately he was uninjured. This was the first of three occasions on which he &#145;came to&#146; in the water, after the ships in which he was serving were destroyed. He was appointed midshipman in October 1942 and commissioned a lieutenant in the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve in 1943. He served in the Mediterranean, Normandy, and the Far East. The first of these gave him, he claimed, unrivalled knowledge of the brothels of Alexandria&#151;not on his own account but from having to extricate his sailors and return them to his ship. The final posting gave him his first experience of advocacy, defending in courts martial.<br>
<br>In 1946 Havers left the navy to attend Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, for two years, where he read law. He was called to the bar in 1948 and joined the chambers of Fred Lawton as pupil to Gerald Howard, who became an MP shortly thereafter. On 3 September 1949 he married Carol Elizabeth (<i>b</i>. 1928/9), daughter of Stuart Lay, company director. They had two sons.<br>
<br>Havers's attractive and vigorous style as an advocate enabled him to build up a substantial civil and criminal practice on the south-eastern circuit, primarily in East Anglia. There, in successive summers, he prosecuted a number of heavy frauds, including the Suffolk lime fraud trials, which ended with the Court of Appeal laying down guidelines as to the number of counts to be included in an indictment. His most famous client was probably Mick Jagger, whose sentence of three months' imprisonment for a minor drugs offence, promptly set aside by the Court of Appeal, produced a public outcry. Havers was appointed QC in 1963. From 1962 to 1968 he was recorder of Dover, and then until 1971 recorder of Norwich. He was chairman of the west Suffolk quarter sessions from 1965 to 1971, having been vice-chairman for the previous four years. He also served as chancellor of the dioceses of St Edmundsbury and Ipswich from 1965 to 1973 and of Ely from 1969 to 1973.<h2>
<a name="Memberofparliament"></a>Member of parliament</h2>Havers entered politics comparatively late, when he was elected for the then safe Conservative seat of Wimbledon in succession to Sir Cyril Black, with a majority of 13,000 in June 1970, a seat he held until his appointment in 1987 as lord chancellor. He was elected a bencher of the Inner Temple in 1971. In November 1972 he was appointed solicitor-general by Edward Heath, succeeding Sir Geoffrey Howe, who had moved to the cabinet, and he worked closely with Sir Peter Rawlinson, the attorney-general, until the fall of the Conservative government in February 1974. He was knighted on assuming office in 1972.<br>
<br>Following the Conservatives' defeat, Havers was appointed shadow attorney-general and continued to serve in that capacity and as legal adviser to the shadow cabinet throughout the period of Conservative opposition in 1974&#150;9. Nineteen seventy-four saw his first and, in his own memory, his greatest parliamentary occasion, in the attack on the Labour attorney-general, Sam Silkin, over the <span class="roman">Housing Finance (Special Provisions) Bill</span>. This granted retrospective immunity to the Clay Cross councillors who faced surcharges and disqualification from office for having refused to increase council rents under the <span class="roman">Housing Finance Act</span> of 1972. The roar of support from the Conservative benches behind him as he laid into the attorney-general for advocating this legislation in the teeth, as was known from a leaked letter, of even his own advice, was something he never forgot.<h2>
<a name="Attorneygeneral"></a>Attorney-general</h2>On taking office on 4 May 1979, Margaret Thatcher immediately appointed Havers attorney-general. That office had, in the words of Professor J. Ll. J. Edwards, been &#145;no sinecure throughout its long history&#146; and frequently the subject of stormy controversy  (Edwards, 57). This was equally true of Havers's period in office. Those eight years from 1979 to 1987 were the longest unbroken tenure of the office since the eighteenth century, and included the Falklands War, where he was a member of the small inner &#145;war cabinet&#146;, the miners' strike of 1983, and the Westland crisis.<br>
<br>The first significant controversy of Havers's long period of office came in the autumn of 1979. The Rhodesia sanctions affair, in which his stout endorsement of the decision of the director of public prosecutions not to prosecute anyone for breaching sanctions occasioned some criticism. It related, however, to events involving ministers and senior officials of both major parties in the late 1960s and early 1970s, in circumstances where witnesses were very unlikely to be available, although there were strong grounds for suspecting that at least some in high places both in government and in the oil industry must have known very well what was going on. No one, however, suggested that there had been any political involvement in the decision. Havers was always scrupulous to prevent any attempt at such interference. He believed firmly in the constitutional convention that has applied ever since the Campbell case which brought down the first Labour government in 1924, that the attorney-general, though of cabinet rank, should not be a member of the cabinet, and that the independence of his legal advice and of prosecution decisions should be beyond question.<br>
<br>Two major issues, which were to arise continually during Havers's term of office, were the need to prosecute on several occasions under the <span class="roman">Official Secrets Act</span> of 1911, and the growing difficulty of effectively prosecuting cases of serious financial fraud. The latter was a problem highlighted in particular by the Lloyds cases of Peter Cameron-Webb, and the so-called gang of four case involving Kenneth Grobb, Ian Posgate, and others, which took some seven years from initiation by the Department of Trade until conclusion of the unsuccessful prosecution. It was Havers's initiative in setting up and encouraging the fraud investigation group concept, whereby for the first time hand-picked teams of lawyers, accountants, and police officers worked together as dedicated teams on such cases, which began to turn the tide, and led, following the report of Lord Roskill's commission in 1986, to the subsequent establishment of the Serious Fraud Office.<br>
<br>On those difficult issues, particularly those involving prosecution under the <span class="roman">Official Secrets Act</span>, which required his express authorization, Havers demonstrated not only his personal skills as an advocate but also his pre-eminent recognition that his duty as her majesty's attorney-general was owed not to the government of which he was a member but to the crown and to the upholding and impartial administration of the law. He was centrally involved in Thatcher's decision to expose in the House of Commons the government's knowledge of Anthony Blunt's treacherous links with the Soviet Union. His forensic skills were engaged in the prosecution of the traitors Geoffrey Prime and Michael Bettany, and, most dramatically, in 1982 when his cross-examination of Professor Hugh Hambleton, a Canadian economist, culminated in Hambleton's confessing in court to having passed NATO secrets to the Soviet Union. He was also closely involved in the prosecution of Sarah Tisdall, a Foreign Office clerk. She had leaked details of cruise missiles arriving at Greenham Common and, despite her plea of guilty, was sentenced by the lord chief justice to nine months' immediate imprisonment. He was likewise closely involved in the unsuccessful prosecution of Clive Ponting for disclosing secret information concerning the sinking of the <span class="italic">General Belgrano</span>.<br>
<br>Meanwhile the danger of his involvement in high-profile terrorist cases, both as attorney-general and as former prosecutor of the Birmingham six and Guildford four, had been vividly brought home to Havers when his flat in Wimbledon was bombed by the IRA, fortunately at a time when he and his wife were on holiday in Spain. He reacted publicly with insouciance, being reported as saying to his wife, &#145;Darling, we seem to have had a slight accident at home&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 3 April 1992). But the narrowness of his escape was not lost on him. He described how he went to his clothes cupboard to find his row of suits hanging apparently untouched, until he felt one and the material simply lifted away in his fingers like cotton wool. He kept his small steel safe from the flat, the one he used to store secret documents, in his room at the law courts. It was crushed like a beer can and he kept it on a high desk like a memento, a St Jerome's skull. Thereafter he had to put up with the burdens of round-the-clock protection.<br>
<br>Echoing an earlier tradition in which the attorney-general would prosecute personally in major criminal cases, Havers led for the crown in the case of the Yorkshire Ripper, where he found himself embarrassed by the refusal of Mr Justice Boreham to countenance the crown's acceptance of the defendant's plea of diminished responsibility. However, he proceeded calmly to cross-examine all four psychiatrists who propounded that defence, including the two called by the prosecution, to the effect that a conviction for murder was obtained. The net result was the same, detention for life, but justice was at least seen to be done. However, such tactics would not have been open to him had the option of capital punishment still been available.<br>
<br>The episode which Havers regarded as the most fascinating of his career was his involvement as a member of the small inner cabinet appointed by Thatcher to supervise the conduct of the Falklands War. His experience was engaged in particular in relation to the deployment of and rules of engagement for the nuclear-powered submarine HMS <i>Conqueror</i> in relation to the 26,000 ton Argentine cruiser the <i>General Belgrano</i>. Thatcher valued not only his legal expertise, especially in relation to international law and the actions available to Britain under article 51 of the United Nations charter, but also because he was the only member of the inner cabinet with firsthand naval experience.<br>
<br>It was a significant disappointment to Havers when, following the general election of June 1983, Lord Hailsham continued as lord chancellor and the promotion for which he had hoped was not forthcoming. His second parliament as attorney-general, from 1983 to 1987, saw the groundwork for the major change in the prosecution system nationally which came with the advent of the crown prosecution service, though the detailed preparation for this major change fell, on account of Havers's illness, on the solicitor-general, Sir Patrick Mayhew.<br>
<br>In the autumn of 1985 Havers was taken ill while out shooting and was obliged to undergo major heart surgery to correct aortic stenosis. The operation was performed on the National Health Service at St George's Hospital, Tooting. It was during that illness that the Westland helicopter crisis, in which his courage and independence were put to their sternest test, took place. The protagonists were Leon Brittan as secretary of state for trade and industry, backed by the prime minister, and Michael Heseltine, the secretary of state for defence. In the course of the dispute it had fallen to Havers's deputy, Sir Patrick Mayhew, to write to Heseltine with advice on legal aspects of the problem, and passages from this confidential letter, harmful to Heseltine's political case, were published in the media. There was little doubt that the leak, by a civil servant to the Press Association, must have been authorized at a high level and that it had taken place after exchanges between Leon Brittan's department and 10 Downing Street. Havers returned to work, contrary to medical advice, at the heart of this crisis. He was quite clear that to breach the confidentiality of the letter of a law officer of the crown was a gross impropriety, and secondly that the leak had to be treated as an offence under the <span class="roman">Official Secrets Act</span>, just as much as the one which had sent Sarah Tisdall to prison. When the suggestion was made that he was taking an unduly legalistic approach, he replied that unless the leak were taken seriously, he would order the police to enter Downing Street the next morning and conduct a criminal investigation. After this it became almost inevitable that heads would roll, and Leon Brittan accepted ministerial responsibility and resigned.<br>
<br>The last of the famous cases with which Havers had to deal as attorney-general was the attempt to suppress the book <span class="italic">Spycatcher</span> (1987), written by the former MI5 agent Peter Wright, or at least to prevent his profiting from it. Havers not only accepted responsibility for the overall conduct of this difficult case but, despite criticism, pursued the matter with determination. It led at one point to a contretemps with the cabinet secretary, Sir Robert Armstrong, who in giving evidence in the Australian court had indicated that Havers had been party to an earlier decision not to prosecute the author of another book on the security services, a point which Havers insisted be retracted.<br>
<br>Following the general election of 1987 Thatcher showed her loyalty to Havers by promoting him to be lord chancellor. Sadly his health was not good enough to enable him to continue and in October 1987 he resigned. His heart surgery had never really succeeded and he suffered far more pain than he ever made known to any but his closest family and confidants.<h2>
<a name="Characterandinterests"></a>Character and interests</h2>Key features of Havers's character were his ebullience and his determination to live life to the full. About 5 feet 10 inches tall, with a distinguished head of grey hair, he was friendly, gregarious, and a noted bon viveur with a considerable appetite for fine wines and good cigars. His favourite clubs were the Garrick and Les Ambassadeurs. At the Garrick he enjoyed the company not only of many lawyers and actors but also of several members from Fleet Street, and it is from his conversations there that a number of the indiscretions for which he became celebrated, and some of which got him into hot water, were said to have come.<br>
<br>Havers loved the theatre and was interested also in literature. He co-authored, with different writers, three books on famous trials, which included <span class="italic">The Poisoned Life of Mrs Maybrick</span> (1977), about the Liverpool poisoner, and <span class="italic">Tragedy in Three Voices: the Rattenbury Murder</span> (1980), about Alma Rattenbury, who was acquitted for the murder of her husband. His book <span class="italic">The Royal Baccarat Scandal</span> (1977), written with his fellow lawyer Edward Grayson, was turned into a successful West End play by Royce Ryton. In 1987 he was a judge on the panel for the Whitbread literary awards.<br>
<br>Following his retirement from the woolsack Havers became chairman of RHM Outhwaite, the Lloyd's underwriters, the Solicitors' Law Stationery Society, and the Playhouse Theatre, London. He died of heart failure on 1 April 1992, at St Bartholomew's Hospital, Smithfield, London. He was survived by his wife, Carol, and their two sons, Philip (<i>b</i>. 1950), a barrister, and Nigel (<i>b</i>. 1951), an actor. A memorial service was held on 8 June 1992 at the Temple Church, London.<br>
