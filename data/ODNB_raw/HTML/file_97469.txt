<span class="headword">Megarry, Sir  Robert Edgar</span>  (1910&#150;2006), <span class="occ">judge and jurist</span>, was born on 1 June 1910 at 25 Woodstock Road, Croydon, Surrey, the elder son of Robert Lindsay Megarry (<i>d</i>. 1952), civil servant, and his wife, Irene Marion Edgar, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Clark (<i>d</i>. 1929), daughter of Major-General Edgar Gibson Clark of the Bengal staff corps. His father, whose family came from Belfast, read law at Trinity Hall, Cambridge, was called to the bar by the Inner Temple, and briefly practised as a barrister in Lincoln's Inn before becoming a civil servant, first at the Board of Education and then in the Air Ministry, ending his career as an assistant secretary.<br>
<br>Megarry, known to his friends as Ted, was educated at Lancing College, to which he remained devoted throughout his life, later serving as president of the Lancing Club and long-standing chairman of the Friends of Lancing Chapel. Before going to Trinity Hall in 1929 he taught briefly at a preparatory school, where he discovered his liking for teaching and innovatively required his pupils to answer questionnaires about his effectiveness as a teacher. He read law at Cambridge, but found the course dull and uninspiring, gaining only a third in part one, a lower second in part two of the law tripos and a third in the LLB, preferring such wider pursuits as playing football and tennis for his college, learning to fly, and being <i>Varsity</i>'s first music critic (writing under a pseudonym to hide his activities from his supervisor). In 1935 he qualified as a solicitor after studying with the law &#145;crammers&#146; Gibson and Weldon, who took pride in the quality of their teaching and whose staff he joined as a lecturer. In 1939 he published his first book, <span class="italic">An Introduction to the Rent Acts</span>, in later much expanded editions (eleven were published) renamed <span class="italic">The Rent Acts</span>. In 1939&#150;40 he taught undergraduates as a member of the Cambridge law faculty. Rejected for military service on medical grounds he spent the Second World War as a civil servant, rising to assistant secretary in the Ministry of Supply. On 14 November 1936 he had married Iris Davies, a local government official, and daughter of Elias Lawson Davies, wholesale clothing merchant, of Neath, Glamorgan. They had three daughters.<br>
<br>In 1941 Megarry chose a new career. He had his name removed from the roll of solicitors and joined Lincoln's Inn. In 1944 he was awarded a certificate of honour in his bar finals and was called to the bar. From 1946 (when he left the civil service) until 1967 he practised as a chancery barrister, acquiring a substantial practice in new areas of the law such as town and country planning. However, he also continued teaching and writing. From 1944 to 1947 he was director of the Law Society's refresher courses. In 1946&#150;7 he was a sub-lector at Trinity College, Cambridge, and from 1946 to 1967 he taught bar students as reader in equity for the Council of Legal Education. He lectured solicitors and civil servants on planning law. He was a visiting professor and lecturer at numerous universities in the USA and Canada. Among his many lectures in England, in 1962 he gave the Hamlyn lectures, published as <span class="italic">Lawyer and Litigant in England</span>. In 1946 he had produced <span class="italic">A Manual of the Law of Real Property</span>. It was primarily intended for &#145;the examination candidate whose main anxiety is not whether he will head the list but whether he will appear in it at all&#146;. It was popular with students: by 2002 eight editions had been published. His other writings reached a wider readership. In 1947 he became the editor of the twenty-third edition of <span class="italic">Snell's Equity</span>. Having never seen a book on equity bring a happy smile to a reader's lips, he hoped to &#145;smooth away some frowns&#146; by reorganizing and enlivening that standard textbook. He co-edited (with Paul Baker) five further editions. Even the index grabbed attention, with entries such as &#145;Fornication, pre-marital&#146; and &#145;O.K., meaning of&#146;. In 1957 he produced with William Wade his most famous textbook, <span class="italic">The Law of Real Property</span>. As was explained in the preface this attempted to state the English law of real property in a form both intelligible to students and helpful to practitioners. The book was user-friendly: it contained a glossary and stated clearly the principles on which the law had developed. It was an immediate success, frequently cited forensically in the authors' lifetimes, despite the rule that books only become authoritative after their authors' deaths. They produced four further editions before relinquishing responsibility for the sixth edition. From 1939 Megarry wrote numerous articles and case notes, many brilliant in their succinct analysis, for the <span class="italic">Law Quarterly Review</span>, of which he was assistant editor and book review editor. One critical review of a Court of Appeal decision in <i>Hankey v. Clavering</i> (1942) was relied on more than fifty years later by a law lord, Lord Steyn, to overrule that decision. All his writings were distinguished by their scholarly exposition and their comprehensibility. Such was his reputation as a legal scholar that in 1965 he was elected president of the Society of Public Teachers of Law and in 1970 a fellow of the British Academy.<br>
<br>Megarry's overbusy life nearly led to his professional ruin. He was prosecuted in 1954 for making false income tax statements, having omitted to declare some of his sources of income. This was a high-profile case, with the solicitor-general leading for the prosecution, Megarry's defence counsel being Gilbert Paull. The Old Bailey judge directed the jury that the case should be stopped unless they were certain that Megarry had known that the returns were false. The case was duly stopped and Megarry acquitted.<br>
<br>This brush with the law did not stop Megarry's progress in the profession. In 1956 he was appointed queen's counsel and in 1967 he was elevated to the High Court bench as a chancery judge, receiving the traditional knighthood. He had no qualms about hearing cases involving points on which he might have expressed views as an author. He was always prepared to be persuaded. As he put it, &#145;argued law is tough law&#146;. In 1976 he became the vice-chancellor of the Chancery Division, and was sworn of the privy council in 1978. In the late 1970s he was offered promotion to the Court of Appeal but declined. By reason of a statutory rearrangement of the courts in 1982 he became the vice-chancellor of the Supreme Court and an <i>ex officio</i> member of the Court of Appeal, but chose not to sit in that court. He retired in 1985 on reaching the statutory retirement age but sat in the judicial committee of the privy council until he reached the age of eighty.<br>
<br>As a judge Megarry dealt with many of the important cases of the day brought in the Chancery Division. In addition to the standard fare for chancery judges of that time relating to trusts, tax, company law, bankruptcy and property, he resolved disputes involving trade unions (for example <i>Chappell v. Times Newspapers</i>, 1975), the domicile of Errol Flynn (<i>Re Flynn deceased</i>, 1968), equitable remedies for breach of confidence <i>(Coco v. Clark</i>, 1969), telephone-tapping before the incorporation into English law of the European convention on human rights (<i>Malone v. Metropolitan Police Commissioner</i>, 1979), the exercise of investment powers by the National Union of Mineworkers' pension fund trustees (<i>Cowan v. Scargill</i>, 1985), and land rights of the Banaban inhabitants of Ocean Island, from which phosphate was extracted (<i>Tito v. Waddell, no. 2</i>, 1977). His conduct of the hearing of the Ocean Island case, which lasted a then record 206 days, exemplified his patience as a judge and his belief that the most important person in court was the litigant who would leave the court unsuccessful. At the islanders' request he went on a gruelling journey to the Pacific to view Ocean Island. He delivered his judgment, written in his small, neat hand, orally for two and a half days. It occupies over 240 pages of the law reports and is a repository of erudite learning. A traditionalist by nature, he was no bold innovator in the law. Thus, in <i>Uppal v. Home Office</i> (1978), he was resistant to the logic of the procedural rules relating to judicial review that required the Chancery Division to relinquish its jurisdiction as an occasional forum for administrative law cases. However, in one case, <i>Ross v. Caunters</i> (1980), his strong instinct for justice led him to fashion a remedy for a testamentary beneficiary, the gift to whom was defeated through the negligence of the testator's solicitor; the House of Lords in a subsequent case (<i>White v. Jones</i>, 1995) was to support the result but by a different route. He sought by his judgments to bring clarity and order to the law. Written in a style commanding attention, they were notable for their lucidity, their scholarly treatment of precedent, their meticulous findings of the facts, and their careful analysis of the arguments. He was rarely reversed.<br>
<br>Lord Scarman, in introducing Megarry delivering the 1977 Child &amp; Co. lecture (on judges and judging), described him as &#145;the legal universal man&#146;, being a &#145;teacher &hellip; a writer &hellip; a judge, and above all &hellip; a wit&#146;. A humorous man, Megarry enjoyed collecting legal anecdotes to produce in 1955 <span class="italic">Miscellany-at-Law</span>, &#145;a diversion for lawyers and others&#146;. A <span class="italic">Second Miscellany</span> followed in 1973 and in 2005 he produced a third in the series, <span class="italic">A New Miscellany-at-Law</span> (with the help of Bryan Garner). In 1969 he also published <span class="italic">Arabinesque-at-Law</span>, containing utterances of the eccentric Serjeant Arabin at the Old Bailey in the 1840s. In 1972 for the Selden Society he wrote <span class="italic">Inns Ancient and Modern</span>. Of particular delight to him in the Ocean Island case was the chance discovery of a judgment of Sir Salathiel Lovell, to whose judicial career Megarry enjoyed referring; Lovell, when appointed a baron of the exchequer in 1708, was nearly eighty.<br>
<br>Megarry's professional distinction led him to be appointed a member of the lord chancellor's law reform committee from 1952 to 1973 and a consultant to the BBC's <span class="italic">Law in Action</span> series from 1953 to 1966, his broadcast talks evidencing his ability to communicate to the ordinary man. He was chairman of the Notting Hill Housing Trust in 1967&#150;8, treasurer of Lincoln's Inn in 1981, and, as an enthusiastic and knowledgeable oenophile, chairman of the inn's wine committee for over twenty years. His inn's affection for him was demonstrated by the commissioning (from Anthony Morris) of a portrait of him in 2001. His high standing in and services to the law were recognized by the University of Cambridge in making him an LLD in 1959 and by his college in appointing him an honorary fellow of Trinity Hall in 1973. He also received honorary doctorates from London and several other universities. He died at the Royal Free Hospital, London, of heart failure, on 11 October 2006 at the end of a career described by a reviewer of his last book as &#145;unmatched in its distinction, breadth and diversity&#146;  (S. Cretney, <span class="italic">Law Quarterly Review</span>, 123, 2007, 165). He was survived by his three daughters, his wife, Iris, having predeceased him in 2001.<br>
