<span class="headword">Taylor,  John</span>  (1829&#150;1893), <span class="occ">author and librarian</span>, born on 12 September 1829 at 15 (later 32) Berkeley Place, Clifton, Bristol, was the eldest son of John Taylor, ironmonger, and his wife, Ann Ackland. After leaving school he assisted his father in his business, but found time for much private study. During 1858&#150;9 he contributed to the <span class="italic">Bristol Times</span> several pieces, chiefly translations from the early Latin poets of the church. His attainments attracted notice, and he was appointed, on 26 March 1860, under-librarian to the Bristol Library Society, the largest subscription library in the west of England. He was elected librarian on 30 March 1863 and under him the number of subscribers, previously in decline, steadily increased. The Bristol Library and the Bristol Institution having united, in 1871 he became librarian of the Bristol Museum and Library, as the joint association was designated.<br>
<br>In 1874 Taylor proposed the formation of an archaeological society in Bristol and Gloucestershire and began to gather signatures in support of the idea. His scheme bore fruit in 1876, when the Bristol and Gloucestershire Archaeological Society held its first meeting. Spurning dilettantism, the society set itself high standards, which it substantially attained. Between 1876 and 1886 Taylor contributed antiquarian articles to the <span class="italic">Saturday Review</span>. His connection with the <span class="italic">Athenaeum</span>, which began in 1876, continued until his death.<br>
<br>On 16 October 1883 Taylor was elected city librarian of Bristol, which then had four free libraries. He kept this office until his death. In June 1885 a branch for Redland and West Clifton was opened, and in January 1888 one for Hotwells. This extension of branch libraries into middle-class suburbs, as well as into poorer districts, was actively supported by Taylor, who sent regular reports to the local press to argue that public libraries were not just philanthropic institutions for the poor, but an essential part of urban life.<br>
<br>Taylor wrote on the history and antiquities of Bristol and the west country. He was author of <span class="italic">Tintern Abbey and its Founders</span> (1867), <span class="italic">Guide to Clifton and its Neighbourhood</span> (1868), <span class="italic">A Book about Bristol &hellip; from Original Research</span> (1872), which was part guidebook, part antiquarian work, and <span class="italic">Bristol and Clifton, Old and New</span> (1877). His most important work was the <span class="italic">Ecclesiastical History</span> [of Bristol] (1881), which forms the second volume of <span class="italic">Bristol Past and Present</span> and is the most valuable part of a generally useful book. Some of his <span class="italic">Antiquarian Essays Contributed to the &#145;Saturday Review&#146;</span>, were collected and published in 1895. Taylor died at Wordsworth Villa, Redland, Bristol, on 9 April 1893. He left a widow, three sons, and three daughters. His eldest son, Lancelot Acland Taylor, became librarian of the Museum Reference Library, Bristol.<br>
