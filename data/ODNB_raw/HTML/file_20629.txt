<span class="headword">O'Halloran,  Thomas Shuldham</span>  (1797&#150;1870), <span class="occ">army officer and police chief in Australia</span>, was born on 25 October 1797 at Berhampore, India, the second son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20627/', "Major-General Sir Joseph O'Halloran (1763&#150;1843)")</script> and his wife, Frances (1773&#150;1835), the daughter of Colonel Nicholas Bayly and the niece of the first earl of Uxbridge. He followed in the strong military traditions of his family by becoming a cadet at the Royal Military College at Marlow, Buckinghamshire, in 1808. In 1813 he joined the 17th regiment in India as an ensign and took part in the Anglo-Nepal War (1814&#150;16). He became a lieutenant in 1817.<br>
<br>On 1 August 1821 O'Halloran married Anne (<i>c</i>.1801&#150;1823), the daughter of James Goss, of Dawlish, Devon. They had two children before she died two years later, in Calcutta, whence O'Halloran had gone to join the 44th regiment; the following year he was with them at Chittagong as paymaster, quartermaster, and interpreter. He served in the First Anglo-Burmese War, and became a captain in the 99th regiment in April 1827. Subsequently he exchanged into the 56th and then the 6th regiment, and served as an aide-de-camp to his father in Saugor, central India.<br>
<br>O'Halloran went on to the half-pay list and returned to England in 1834, where on 10 July he married Jane, the eldest daughter of James Waring. They had three sons and one daughter. In 1837 he returned to full pay as a captain in the 97th regiment, and commanded a force sent to quell a riot in Yorkshire. He finally sold his commission the following year and sailed with his family to take up residence on a series of land selections (later O'Halloran Hill) south of Adelaide, South Australia. Soon afterwards, with concern rising as to the lawlessness of the colony, the governor, George Gawler, sought to make use of O'Halloran's experience (particularly that of suppressing disorder in Yorkshire) and appointed him to the board of commissioners of the new South Australian police force. When in 1840 the governor formed a voluntary militia as a further measure to keep the peace, the &#145;dashing officer&#146; O'Halloran  (Ross) was made its major-commandant.<br>
<br>With the dismissal in May 1840 of the police commissioner, O'Halloran was appointed to the vacant position. In July of that year survivors of a shipwreck near Adelaide were killed by Aborigines, and he was ordered to lead an expedition to capture those responsible. This was, if possible, to be carried out without bloodshed. But, Gawler wrote, &#145;if in the execution of it, you are really compelled to abandon temperate measures, and to resort to those of extreme force against the whole tribe, you will not be held blamable&#146;  (Tolmer, 180). Two Aborigines were hanged and others were shot while escaping from O'Halloran's party. This was the first &#145;officially sanctioned punitive expedition&#146; against the Aborigines in South Australia  (Clyne, 51), setting a precedent for many in the years to come. Much of O'Halloran's time as police commissioner was taken up in organizing expeditions against Aboriginal &#145;crime&#146;, such as the traditional lighting of fires in grassland and the pilfering of animals and minor supplies. As noted by the historian of the South Australian police, regarding how O'Halloran undertook this duty, his &#145;judgement was heavily influenced by his military background &hellip; He might attempt to disguise or temper his martial belligerency in dealing with this frustrating problem, but he could not always hide it&#146;  (ibid., 55).<br>
<br>O'Halloran reorganized the police force along more efficient lines, but in 1843 he was asked, as part of an economy drive by the new governor, George Grey, to add the role of police magistrate to his duties. He resigned. Soon afterwards he was appointed by Grey to the legislative council. In 1846 he &#145;stalked out&#146;  (Whitelock, 70) of the council with a number of others in opposition to the imposition of mineral royalties. In 1857 he was elected to the first council formed after the granting of responsible government, heading the votes in a list of twenty-seven candidates. He resigned in 1863. After a lifetime of duty, carried out in his &#145;direct, forthright and uncomplicated&#146; way  (Ross), O'Halloran died, at his home in O'Halloran Hill, on 16 August 1870. He was buried at Christ Church, O'Halloran Hill.<br>
