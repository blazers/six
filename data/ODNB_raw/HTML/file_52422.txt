<span class="headword">Berlioz,  (Louis) Hector</span>  (1803&#150;1869), <span class="occ">composer and conductor</span>, was born on 11 December 1803 in La C&ocirc;te St Andr&eacute;, in the d&eacute;partement of Is&egrave;re, France, the first of four children of Dr Louis-Joseph Berlioz and his wife, Marie-Antoinette-Jos&eacute;phine, commonly known as Jos&eacute;phine, the daughter of Nicolas Marmion of Grenoble. In adulthood he was 5 feet 4 inches tall, with striking looks which included an aquiline nose and deep-set, penetrating grey eyes surmounted by a broad forehead and a shock of auburn hair. His health was not robust, and he fluctuated between extremes of boisterousness and deep melancholia. These qualities were balanced by the wit and humour which reveal themselves in his <i>feuilletons</i> and letters. On 3 October 1833 he married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25943/', "Harriet Smithson (1800&#150;1854)")</script>, an Irish actress with whom he had been infatuated for six years. The couple were separated by 1844, having had a son, although Berlioz cared for Harriet until her death on 3 March 1854, soon after which, on 19 October, he married his mistress, Marie R&eacute;cio.<br>
<br>Berlioz became established in the public eye with the first performance of his <span class="italic">Symphonie fantastique</span> in Paris in December 1830. However, it was performances of his overtures <span class="italic">Les Francs-juges</span>, <span class="italic">Le roi Lear</span>, and <span class="italic">Waverley</span> during 1840 that first aroused public interest in London. During the next few years he travelled with much success to Germany and Russia before venturing to London in November 1847 at the invitation of the impresario Louis Jullien. Berlioz was offered a contract to conduct the opening season of opera at Drury Lane in December, with the promise of a much needed handsome salary and the expectation of a six-month engagement for six years. Jullien went bankrupt in April 1848, and although Berlioz conducted the full season he went unpaid. He turned his attention to organizing concerts which included his own music; the two grandest were at Drury Lane on 7 February and at the Hanover Square Rooms on 29 June 1848. He was very successful and earned much praise, but in the absence of the offer of a suitable position he returned to Paris. During this visit he started to compile his <span class="italic">M&eacute;moires</span>, noting in the preface (dated 21 March 1848) that he had been received in England with much warmth and hospitality.<br>
<br>Berlioz paid four further visits to London. In 1851 it was as a member of the French section of the jury adjudicating the musical instruments at the Great Exhibition. This was a busy and arduous time, and Berlioz took his duties very seriously: but by the end of the exhibition he was the only one of the twelve jurors left in the music section, and he remained unpaid. He attended the service of the charity children held in St Paul's Cathedral on 5 June, a performance involving 6500 children's voices, which made a deep and lasting impression on him; as a result he added a part for unison children's voices in the then unperformed <span class="roman">Te Deum</span>. Before he returned to Paris on 28 July he had taken an apartment for the following summer season. A New Philharmonic Society was planned to promote new or hitherto unknown works of merit, and Berlioz was to be its director.<br>
<br>The 1852 season saw Berlioz's greatest success in London, and between 24 March and 9 June he conducted six concerts at Exeter Hall with an orchestra of 110, the largest ever gathered in London, and one concert at the Hanover Square Rooms. All included his own music alongside other repertory, except the fourth, which was the first London performance of Beethoven's ninth symphony, the &#145;Choral&#146;. For this he had managed to arrange five rehearsals, which was considered a great achievement as English orchestras had already earned notoriety for the paucity of their rehearsal time. This work was repeated at the final concert, with excerpts from <span class="italic">La damnation de Faust</span> (1846); Berlioz's reputation as the world's leading conductor was secured.<br>
<br>If 1852 saw Berlioz's triumph, the season of 1853 witnessed a disaster for his ill-fated opera <span class="italic">Benvenuto Cellini</span> (1837) at Covent Garden. The second overture Berlioz wrote for the work, <span class="italic">Le carnaval romain</span>, had been well received in an all-Berlioz Royal Philharmonic concert, and rehearsals for the opera had been good. But on the opening night, 25 June, a very loud claque hissed the work from start to finish in protest at the encroachment of foreign works and artists into an Italian opera house. It was Berlioz's only failure in London, and he withdrew the work immediately.<br>
<br>Berlioz returned to London for the last time in 1855 to conduct two New Philharmonic Society concerts of his own works at Exeter Hall and one concert of mixed repertory at Covent Garden. Despite rehearsal difficulties, the concerts were successful and plans were initiated for the following season, but they were later abandoned. Berlioz died at 4 rue de Calais, Paris, on 8 March 1869 and was buried at Montmartre three days later.<br>
<br>The lack of a strong native tradition during Berlioz's visits helps to explain why London was more open to musical innovation than other European cities at this time, and accounts for the warmth with which Berlioz was received&#151;warmth which was notably lacking in Paris. Berlioz held London and his British friends in great affection, and would have considered a permanent residence in the city had the opportunity presented itself. Although his visits were not the source of any great compositional activity, the effect of his successes on his morale was certainly a positive one; and his articles for the <span class="italic">Journal des d&eacute;bats</span> (substantially reprinted in 1950 by A. W. Ganz in <span class="italic">Berlioz in London</span>), give a lively and colourful account of London's music-making and his experience of it during those years.<br>
