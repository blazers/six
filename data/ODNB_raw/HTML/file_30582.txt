<span class="headword">Barger,  George</span>  (1878&#150;1939), <span class="occ">chemist</span>, was born in Manchester on 4 April 1878, the elder son of Gerrit Barger, a Dutch engineer, and his wife, Eleanor Higginbotham. He received his school education at Utrecht, and at the age of sixteen obtained a scholarship to University College, London, which he entered in 1896. After two years' study in London he proceeded in 1898 to King's College, Cambridge, with an entrance scholarship, and in 1901 gained a first class in part two of the natural sciences tripos in both chemistry and botany. On leaving Cambridge, where he had become friends with E. M. Forster, he was appointed demonstrator in botany under Leo Errera, of Brussels; and in 1903 he returned to England, to join the staff of the Wellcome Physiological Research Laboratories. In 1904 he married Florence Emily, the daughter of Alfred William Thomas, and they had two sons and one daughter. In that same year Henry Dale, whom Barger had known at Cambridge, joined the Wellcome laboratories, and the two men began a productive scientific partnership.<br>
<br>In 1909 Barger was appointed head of the department of chemistry at Goldsmiths' College, New Cross, London, and in 1913 became professor of chemistry at Royal Holloway College, Englefield Green, but retained a part-time, consulting connection with the Wellcome laboratories. In 1914 he joined the staff of the Medical Research Committee (later Medical Research Council); and in 1919 was appointed the first professor of chemistry in relation to medicine in the University of Edinburgh, where he remained until, in 1937, he accepted the regius chair of chemistry in the University of Glasgow, an appointment which he held for the rest of his life.<br>
<br>Barger's scientific work followed two main lines, namely, studies of alkaloids, and investigations of simpler nitrogenous compounds of biological importance: both arose from his studies of ergot initiated in the Wellcome laboratories. His main achievements in alkaloid chemistry were the isolation of ergotoxine from ergot; the elucidation of the constitutions of carpaine and physostigmine, and of a group of aporphine alkaloids; and an important contribution to the chemistry of yohimbine.<br>
<br>Barger's identification of tyramine as one of the compounds responsible for the biological activity of ergot extracts led to a series of studies of bases similarly derived from naturally occurring amino acids; among such bases isolated both from ergot and from mammalian tissues was histamine, a compound which later proved to be of the greatest physiological significance. In this field Barger's chemical expertise complemented the physiological skills of Dale. Together, the two men worked on a wide range of amines that mimicked the natural activity of the sympathetic nervous system. This led them to develop the significant concept of sympathomimetic amines, important for basic physiology and pharmacology, and for the later development of therapeutic compounds.<br>
<br>In the early part of work by others leading to the synthesis of thyroxine (by C. R. Harington), and of vitamin B1 (by A. R. Todd), Barger's contribution and continuing interest were considerable. His lifelong interest in ergot was expressed in <span class="italic">Ergot and Ergotism</span> (1931), a scholarly monograph covering all aspects of the subject; this was based on his Dohme lectures delivered in 1928 at Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore. In addition to many scientific papers, he published three other books on aspects of organic chemistry and its relationship to medicine.<br>
<br>Barger was an enthusiastic traveller, and his linguistic expertise enabled him to develop close scientific contacts in many countries, which he used to promote his ideal of free exchange between scientists of different nations. In his own work he was essentially an experimentalist and his scientific outlook was mechanistic. He was uncompromisingly honest and outspoken, not over-patient, but generous of himself to his friends and pupils.<br>
<br>Barger was a fellow of King's College, Cambridge, from 1904 to 1910 and was elected FRS in 1919, serving on its council from 1930 to 1932, and receiving the society's Davy medal in 1938. He was an active member of the Chemical Society for many years, serving on its council from 1913 to 1917, and becoming vice-president in the year in which he died, having been Longstaff medallist in 1936. He was Hanbury medallist of the Pharmaceutical Society (1934) in recognition of the importance of his work to pharmaceutical chemistry, and president of section B (Chemistry) of the British Association (1929). He received honorary degrees from the universities of Liverpool, Padua, Heidelberg, Utrecht, Michigan, and Lausanne. Barger died suddenly at Aeschi, Switzerland, on 6 January 1939, while on a lecture tour.<br>
