<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Levitt,  Dorothy Elizabeth</span>  (1882&#150;1922), <span class="occ">motorist and author</span>, was born Elizabeth Levi at 11 Colvestone Crescent, Hackney, London, on 5 January 1882, the second of three daughters of Jacob Levi (1852&#150;1934) and Julia Raphael (1856&#150;1942). The Levi family was a prosperous and well-established Jewish family. Dorothy's father was a jeweller as was her paternal grandfather, Leman or Lemon Levi (<i>c</i>.1804&#150;1895). Her maternal grandfather, Joseph Raphael (1807&#150;1893), a retired diamond merchant, kept a hotel in Duke Street, London.<br>
<br>By 1901 the family was living in Leconfield Road, Islington, London. Jacob Levi had Anglicized the family surname to Levit or Levitt and was engaged in the tea import business. Now aged nineteen, Elizabeth Levit was working as a typist or secretary, an occupation that was becoming increasingly acceptable for middle- or upper-class women. By 1903 she was employed as a secretary with the Napier Car Company, which manufactured cars, among them racing cars. A striking young woman, she was spotted by Selwyn Edge, the Australian entrepreneur, racing driver, and director of the Napier company. She told a journalist that Edge arranged for her to serve a six-month motoring apprenticeship with a firm of automobile makers on the outskirts of Paris, where she trained as a mechanic and chauffeur. She was already an accomplished horsewoman and it is known that she took to driving easily. She described it as &#145;exhilarating&#146;, and all commentators agreed she was an intrepid and skilful driver. On her return to London she earned a living giving driving lessons to high-born and wealthy women, while Edge decided to use her as a works driver and to promote his cars.<br>
<br>As Dorothy E. Levitt she came to public attention in 1903, when she became the first British woman to compete in a motor race. She did not win her first race, in April 1903, but recorded in her diary that she &#145;will do better next time&#146;  (Byng-Hall, 8), and she certainly did. Between 1903 and 1908 she competed in motoring events in the UK, France, and Germany, achieving considerable honours and publicity. Competitive driving had emerged in the mid-1890s and was still largely a male preserve. Very few women, among them the Frenchwoman Camille du Gast, had taken up racing, and Levitt pioneered the sport for women in Britain.<br>
<br>In October 1903 Levitt amazed the public when, driving a 12 hp Gladiator, she won her class at the Southport speed trials, achieving a time of 1 minute 4.4 seconds for the flying kilometre. The following year she won her class at Southport and Blackpool speed trials. In 1905, driving an 80 hp Napier, she won the Brighton sweepstakes, hitting a speed of nearly 80 m.p.h. and beating many professional drivers. In October 1906, driving a 90 hp Napier, she broke her own record and created a new world speed record for women of 91 m.p.h. at Blackpool. Not surprisingly she was dubbed &#145;the fastest girl on earth&#146;. According to an extract from her diary, during this race she had a near miss when the bonnet of her car, a 90 hp six-cylinder Napier, worked loose and might have beheaded her if she had not pulled up in time.<br>
<br>Sponsored and encouraged by Selwyn Edge, with whom she had a very close relationship, Levitt became Britain's foremost woman racing driver. As well as speed events she competed in long-distance reliability trials and hill climbs. In May 1903, driving a 16 hp Gladiator, she took part in the Glasgow&#150;London non-stop run, a distance of some 400 miles. Problems with tyres meant she had to stop, but she still gained 994 marks out of a possible 1000. In 1904 she entered the Hereford 1000 mile event and in March 1905 created a new record for the &#145;longest drive achieved by a lady driver&#146;, when she drove a single-cylinder De Dion Bouton from London to Liverpool and back again in two days, averaging a speed of 20 m.p.h. She travelled with an official observer but did not take a mechanic, preferring to do her own repairs. In 1906 she set another women's speed record at the Shelsley Walsh speed hill climb in a 50 hp Napier, achieving the climb in 92.4 seconds, a record that was not broken until 1913.<br>
<br>In 1907 the new Brooklands track opened but Levitt, even with Edge's backing, was not allowed to compete because Brooklands did not admit women until 1908. Turning her attention to Europe, in June 1907 she achieved a gold medal in the Herkomer trophy race, in Germany, coming fourth out of 172 competitors. Commenting on the lacklustre performance of the British competitors, <span class="italic">The Times</span> stated that &#145;the single exception was the Napier car driven with skill, courage, and cool judgement by Miss Dorothy Levitt&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 20 June 1907). Two months later she raced in Trouville, France.<br>
<br>Motoring journals such as <span class="italic">Autocar</span> constantly featured Levitt's racing achievements as did papers such as <span class="italic">The Times</span> and the <span class="italic">Jewish Chronicle</span>. Her driving skills, combined with an excellent dress sense, attracted considerable press attention. In 1904, at the Hereford 1000 mile trial, where she was the only female competitor, she finished to cheers, a bouquet from Edge, and the acclaim of the press, who photographed her with her Pomeranian dog, Dodo, who accompanied her on long-distance events. Male drivers were so irked that they reportedly turned up the following day with toy dogs attached to the bonnets of their cars. She had the last laugh, sending dog biscuits to the male competitors at the prize-giving concert.<br>
<br>Levitt was a staunch advocate of a woman's right to motor. She wrote articles on motoring for women, including a series in the <span class="italic">Daily Graphic</span> in 1908, and expanded these into a book, published in 1909, <span class="italic">The Woman and the Car: a Chatty Little Handbook for All Women who Motor or Want to Motor</span>. She stated that &#145;Motoring is a pastime for women: young, middle-aged, and&#151;if there are any&#151;old&#146;. She believed that if a woman &#145;wants to learn how to drive and to understand a motor-car, she can and will learn as quickly as a man&#146;  (Levitt, 15&#150;16). An excellent driver, she was also a very efficient mechanic and her book not only gave advice on choosing a car and its accessories, it also provided clear instructions on how to drive and carry out roadside repairs, supported by photographs by Horace W. Nicholls of her doing so. She devoted a chapter to &#145;the all important question of dress&#146;, urging women to favour comfort and practicality over fancy frills, and suggesting they carry gloves, chocolate, and a revolver in the drawer under the driver's seat. She also recommended using a long-handled mirror to see what was happening behind the car, possibly the first recorded use of a rear-view mirror.<br>
<br>After 1908 Levitt seems to have stopped racing. In 1910 she attended a flying school in France, learning to fly a Farman machine. There is no record of her obtaining a pilot's licence but, as a well-known figure and pioneer aviator, she gave an interview to the <span class="italic">Daily Chronicle</span> in March 1910 about her experiences of learning to fly and ambitions for flight. After this there is little recorded information.<br>
<br>According to a biographical profile which introduced her 1909 book Levitt lived in a smart, well-furnished flat in London's West End. As well as driving some 400 miles every week, she hosted lunch parties, enjoyed the theatre, and attended all the major social events, including Ascot, Goodwood, and Cowes, where in 1903 she had powered a Napier speed boat to victory in a race, after which she had been introduced to King Edward VII. The sketch writer, though, declared he was &#145;forbidden to tread too deeply&#146; in areas of her &#145;delightful private life&#146;, and little was revealed of her identity  (Byng-Hall, 6).<br>
<br>Between 1907 and 1913 Levitt lived in Portman Mansions, Marylebone, London. In 1921 she was living at 50 Upper Baker Street, where she died on 17 May 1922, being found dead in her bed. The death certificate, which named her as Dorothy Elizabeth Levi, recorded that she was unmarried and of independent means, identified her as the daughter of Jacob Levi, and gave her age as thirty-eight. The cause of death was morphine poisoning, while suffering from heart disease and an attack of measles. An inquest recorded a verdict of misadventure. Her will, in the name of Dorothy Elizabeth Levitt, left her property, including a diamond brooch and ring, to her sister Elsie Ruby Lewis (1892&#150;1959) and expressed a wish to be &#145;simply buried in a field by the sea&#146;.<br>
