<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Howerd,  Frankie</span> <span class="st"> [<em>real name </em>Francis Alick Howard]</span>  (1917&#150;1992), <span class="occ">comedian</span>, was born in York on 6 March 1917, the elder son and eldest of three children of Francis Alfred William Howard, soldier and tutor in the army education corps, and his wife, Edith Florence, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Morrison. When Frankie was born his father was a private in the 1st (Royal) Dragoons. In 1920 he was posted to Woolwich barracks and he set up home in Eltham, London&#151;coincidentally the place where Bob Hope, another major comic talent, was born in 1903. After a spell in the army education corps Howard senior's health deteriorated and he was invalided out of the army when Frankie was in his teens. At the age of eleven Frankie won a scholarship to Shooters Hill grammar school, where his best subject was mathematics. At the age of thirteen he became a Sunday school teacher at the local church of St Barnabas. Later he joined the church dramatic society and he appeared in an amateur production of <span class="italic">Tilly of Bloomsbury</span>, his stage d&eacute;but. This led him to apply for a place at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, but he failed the audition and took a series of undemanding clerical jobs, spending his evenings appearing with local concert parties, and in talent shows where his hesitant, stumbling manner was not appreciated. It was not the sort of stumbling that subsequently made him famous, but was born of nerves and shyness.<br>
<br>In 1940 Frankie was called up and he served in the Royal Artillery. Stationed at Shoeburyness, Essex, he became, at last, a popular entertainer much appreciated by his fellow servicemen and women, and he honed the mixture of banter, insult, and denigration that later became his trademark. In 1943 he joined a civilian concert party called the Co-oddments, touring the Southend-on-Sea area. It was here that he met the two women&#151;Vere Roper and Blanche Moore, both pianists&#151;who became in turn his much maligned, allegedly deaf accompanist, and the butt of his humour. Next he was posted to Germany and, after some false starts (failed auditions with humourless officers), he attracted the attention of Major Richard Stone, who in the post-war years was to become a leading theatrical agent. He liked Frankie's routine and sent him off with a concert party to entertain the troops. It was at this time that he adapted his surname to Howerd &#145;to be different&#146;.<br>
<br>Demobbed in 1946 Howerd appeared at the Stage Door Canteen in Piccadilly Circus, a venue that in the later stages of the Second World War was a popular meeting-place for allied troops. Here, at a concert, he was a success and he was spotted by a theatrical agent, Stanley &#145;Scruffy&#146; Dale. Dale's boss, Jack Payne, an astute impresario, duly put Howerd under contract. Dale arranged an audition for the BBC radio comedy and music show <span class="italic">Variety Bandbox</span>, and on 3 December 1946 the nation heard Frankie Howerd on the wireless for the first time; he became that rarest of creatures, a star overnight. By 1947 he was one of the most popular entertainers in the country, broadcasting regularly and touring the music-halls, often with Max Bygraves, a contemporary from a similar background. Jack Payne's ingenious manipulation of contracts made sure that Howerd received only a small percentage of his actual fee. In 1957, after a protracted court case, Howerd won both money and freedom from Payne. Stanley Dale had, by this time, left Payne, and he became Howerd's personal manager. Their fortunes soared.<br>
<br>By 1951, joined by Eric Sykes, the writer chiefly responsible for Howerd's radio scripts, Howerd and Dale formed F. Howerd Scripts Ltd, which later blossomed as Associated London Scripts (the directors were Dale, Howerd, Sykes, and the writers Ray Galton and Alan Simpson, Johnny Speight, Tony Hancock, and Spike Milligan). Dale, with a technique similar to that of Payne, managed to pocket a large sum of money to which he was not entitled; he was ejected from Associated London Scripts and faded from the story. Howerd's success continued and he had many triumphs, including the radio show <span class="italic">Frankie's Bandbox</span> (1961), and films, principally <span class="italic">The Runaway Bus</span> (1954), <span class="italic">The Lady Killers</span> (1955), <span class="italic">The Great St Trinian's Train Robbery</span> (1966), <span class="italic">Carry on Doctor</span> (1968), and <span class="italic">Up Pompeii</span> (1970). His television successes included <span class="italic">The Howerd Crowd</span> (1952, script by Eric Sykes), <span class="italic">Nuts in May</span> (1953, script by Galton and Simpson), and, most importantly for Howerd, <span class="italic">That Was The Week That Was</span> (1962, script by Galton, Simpson, and Speight). Most memorable was the long running <span class="italic">Up Pompeii</span> (script by Talbot Rothwell). On stage he had success in the revue <span class="italic">Pardon my French</span> (1953), the farce <span class="italic">Charley's Aunt</span> (1955), as Bottom in <span class="italic">A Midsummer Night's Dream</span> at the Old Vic (1956), and in the musical <span class="italic">A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum</span> (1964&#150;5). On Howerd's way to the forum there were hiccups. Moli&egrave;re's <span class="italic">School for Wives</span> (1957) was not a success, and a musical, <span class="italic">Mr Venus</span>, folded after only seventeen performances in 1958. Worse was to come: a situation comedy, <span class="italic">Frankly Howerd</span> (1959), was a flop; a television version of <span class="italic">Twenty Questions</span> (1961) also failed; and by 1962 the top bosses of the BBC, both radio and television, felt that Howerd was finished. But in 1962 help was at hand. Peter Cook, seeing Howerd at the <span class="italic">London Evening Standard</span> drama awards, where he was doing a spot, invited him to appear at his recently opened nightclub The Establishment. This led to Howerd's being given a spot on <span class="italic">That Was The Week That Was</span>, with such topical remarks as &#145;David Frost&#151;you know, the one who has his hair on backwards&#146;, and &#145;Robin Day&#151;hasn't he got cruel glasses&#146;. This one television appearance had Howerd back at the top, and he was never to suffer the agonies of failing so badly again.<br>
<br>Personally, Howerd could be charming or acerbic as the mood took him, kindness itself or bitingly sarcastic. He was not above inviting himself to friends' homes for lunch or dinner, but he entertained lavishly when on occasion he pushed the boat out. He was conspicuously untidy in appearance and wore a revolting toupee, to which he never referred. Howerd's speciality was the conversational innuendo&#151;a constant banter addressed to the camera or to individual members of the audience&#151;whose content was much less smutty than its tone. His partner for the last thirty-five years of his life was Dennis Heymer (1929&#150;2009), a waiter at the time they met, but later Howerd's manager. Howerd died in hospital of heart failure on 19 April 1992, surrounded by friends and family. He was buried in the churchyard of St Gregory's Church, Weare, Somerset, on 29 April. He was one of the most outstanding comedians of his day and he brought originality and flair to many of his performances.<br>
