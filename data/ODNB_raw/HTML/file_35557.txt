<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Pollard,  Alfred William</span>  (1859&#150;1944), <span class="occ">bibliographer and scholar of English literature</span>, was born at 1 Brompton Square, Kensington, London, on 14 August 1859, the youngest son of a physician, Edward William Pollard, and his second wife, Emma Louisa, daughter of George Edward Thompson, a shipowner, of Woodbridge, Suffolk. It was from John Wesley Hales at King's College School, the Strand, London, which he attended for seven years, that he acquired his interest in Chaucer and Shakespeare. At King's he also became a friend of W. R. Sickert, the painter. In 1877 he went with an open scholarship to St John's College, Oxford, where he achieved first classes in classical moderations (1879) and <i>literae humaniores</i> (1881). Here he also gained the intimate friendship of A. E. Housman. Debarred by a stammer from teaching, in 1883 Pollard entered the printed books department of the British Museum, where, attracted by the artistic quality of early printing, he soon became a recognized authority able to take charge of the antiquarian work of the department. In 1893 he was joined by R. G. C. Proctor, who already had an established reputation as an incunabulist.<br>
<br>Pollard's very happy marriage to Alice (<i>d</i>. 1926), daughter of George England, of Crediton, Devon, on 17 May 1887, made it necessary to supplement a modest salary by literary work and led to his long association with <span class="italic">The Guardian</span> under Daniel Conner Lathbury. Pollard had already edited several of Chaucer's <span class="italic">Canterbury Tales</span> (1886&#150;7); in 1893 he produced a Chaucer primer; in 1898 he edited the Globe edition of Chaucer in collaboration with H. F. Heath, W. S. McCormick, and M. H. Liddell, himself undertaking the <span class="italic">Canterbury Tales</span>. His edition of Sir Philip Sidney's <span class="italic">Astrophel and Stella</span> was published in 1888 and a selection of <span class="italic">English Miracle Plays, Moralities, and Interludes</span>, a pioneer work often revised, first appeared in 1890. These works were followed by editions of Herrick's poems (1891), of <span class="italic">The Towneley Plays</span> with George England (1897), and of <span class="italic">The Macro Plays</span> with F. J. Furnivall (1904).<br>
<br>In 1889 J. Y. W. MacAlister founded <span class="italic">The Library</span>, and Pollard, at first a contributor, was acknowledged as co-editor in January 1904. The partnership lasted until 1920, when <span class="italic">The Library</span> became the journal of the Bibliographical Society under Pollard's control. MacAlister was also largely responsible for the founding in 1892 of the Bibliographical Society, which Pollard joined the next year as honorary secretary, and as such directed its work for over forty years. He also edited a series of <span class="roman">Books about Books</span>, himself writing that on <span class="italic">Early Illustrated Books</span> (1893), and the handsome and scholarly quarterly <span class="italic">Bibliographica</span> (1895&#150;7). These were followed by <span class="italic">Old Picture Books</span> (1902), <span class="italic">Fine Books</span> (1912), and contributions to an important series of catalogues of books in private libraries, including those of J. P. Morgan (1907), Rush C. Hawkins (1910), C. W. Dyson Perrins (1914), and William Andrewes Clark (1921). His interest in fine printing led to an involvement with the private press movement and an association with William Morris and T. J. Cobden-Sanderson and, in America, with John Henry Nash.<br>
<br>R. G. C. Proctor's particular abilities prompted the trustees to undertake a <span class="italic">Catalogue of Books Printed in the XVth Century now in the British Museum</span>, designed by him and Pollard; after Proctor's death in 1903, loyalty to his friend and to the trustees induced Pollard to shoulder a task for which he confessed he had no innate taste or aptitude. It was this rigorous discipline, however, which turned a gifted amateur into a bibliographer of high technical attainment. The first volume appeared in 1908, and Pollard carried on the work until administrative duties forced him to hand it over to his principal assistant, J. V. Scholderer.<br>
<br>It was in the bibliography and textual criticism of Shakespeare that Pollard made his chief contribution to scholarship. His attention seems to have been accidentally turned in this direction about 1902; the outcome, in 1909, was his <span class="italic">Shakespeare Folios and Quartos: a Study in the Bibliography of Shakespeare's Plays, 1594&#150;1685</span>, which remains a milestone in Shakespearian criticism. In it he controverted the views on the transmission of the text which had prevailed since Edmond Malone condemned all quartos as surreptitious, arguing on the contrary that some may even have been printed from autographs. Another orthodoxy established by Malone, that Shakespeare served an apprenticeship revising the plays of other men, was challenged twenty years later in Peter Alexander's <span class="italic">Shakespeare's Henry VI and Richard III</span> (1929), an investigation inspired and sponsored by Pollard. These two books laid the foundation of most modern textual criticism of Shakespeare. In line with them are Pollard's lectures as Sandars reader in bibliography in the University of Cambridge (1915), <span class="italic">Shakespeare's Fight with the Pirates and the Problems of the Transmission of his Text</span> (1917; rev. edn, 1920), his detailed analysis of the text of <span class="italic">Richard II</span> (1916), his census in the same year (with Henrietta C. Bartlett) of quarto editions of Shakespeare's plays, his British Academy lecture on &#145;The foundations of Shakespeare's text&#146; (1923), and his article on &#145;Shakespeare's text&#146; in <span class="italic">A Companion to Shakespeare Studies</span> (1934). Significant too is the volume of studies he promoted and edited on the question of <span class="italic">Shakespeare's Hand in the Play of Sir Thomas More</span> (1923), claiming that three pages of Shakespeare's autograph survive in British Library, Harley MS 7368. From 1919 to 1932 Pollard was honorary professor of bibliography in the University of London and took students of King's College, of which he had been a fellow since 1907, through some of the most disputed fields of Shakespearian criticism. He was treasurer (1906&#150;10) and a member of the council (1910&#150;44) of the Malone Society.<br>
<br>To the Oxford facsimile of the Authorized Version of the <span class="roman">Bible</span>, issued for the tercentenary of 1911, Pollard contributed a historical introduction and edited a collection of documents relating to the translation of the <span class="roman">Bible</span> into English, which is of permanent value for biblical studies.<br>
<br>Pollard became keeper of printed books in 1919 at an administrative crisis, and in five years of strenuous work left his mark on the organization of the department. He retired in 1924. In 1919 the Bibliographical Society had laid plans for <span class="italic">A short-title catalogue of books printed in England, Scotland, and Ireland, and of English books printed abroad, 1475&#150;1640</span>, and much preliminary work had been done by Gilbert Richard Redgrave. In 1924 Pollard took charge, and two years later the first edition of this invaluable reference work appeared. Other interests too engrossed him, and after the death of Sir Israel Gollancz, a fellow Shakespearian scholar, in 1930 he took an active part in the work of the Shakespeare Association and became director of the Early English Text Society, until 1937. He also took part in the founding of the Central Library for Students (later the National Central Library).<br>
<br>In 1934 Pollard resigned the secretaryship of the Bibliographical Society and the editorship of <span class="italic">The Library</span>. His work had won him many academic honours; he became an honorary fellow of St John's in 1923, and he received honorary degrees from the universities of Durham (1921) and Cambridge (1934). He was elected FBA and appointed CB in 1922. In 1935 he suffered a fall while gardening, which seriously incapacitated him, but he lived another nine years and died at Wimbledon Hospital on 8 March 1944.<br>
<br>A humane man and a sincere churchman, Alfred Pollard was deeply religious in an individual way. In 1911 he published anonymously a small book of practical morality, <span class="italic">Life, Love and Light</span>, and he often wrote on religious and social matters, sharing his wife's interest in women's emancipation. Pollard left only a daughter; both his sons were killed in the First World War.<br>
