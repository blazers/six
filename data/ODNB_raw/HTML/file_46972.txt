<span class="headword">Leveson, Sir  John</span>  (1555&#150;1615), <span class="occ">landowner</span>, was born on 21 March 1555 at Whornes Place, Cuxton, Kent, the eldest son of Thomas Leveson (1532&#150;1576), landowner, and Ursula Gresham (1534&#150;1574). The main family estates were in Kent and Essex, but the ancestral property in Wolverhampton was retained. On 10 January 1576 he matriculated at Queen's College, Oxford, and he also spent time at Gray's Inn. On 27 April 1579 he married Margaret, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18014/', "Sir Roger Manwood")</script>, a leading member of the Kentish gentry. She died on 26 April 1585, and on 9 July the following year Leveson married Christian (<i>d</i>. 1627), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18696/', "Sir Walter Mildmay")</script> and widow of Charles Barrett, a match which indicated Leveson's puritan sympathies. Leveson's letters also illustrate the faith which influenced his whole life.<br>
<br>Leveson was efficient in estate management, his family connections brought him into politics, and he became an excellent public servant. Later he traded in pearls and was a shareholder in the Virginia Company. First noted among the thirty-eight Kentish landowners petitioning the privy council against Archbishop Whitgift's attack on the puritans in 1584, he was appointed deputy lieutenant for Kent in 1590, and proved himself invaluable to the lord lieutenant, William, Lord Cobham, in both public and private affairs. Leveson first served him as a military commander in raising the trained bands, and later in the preparations against the Armada; the defence of Kent in 1588 can be followed in his papers. He served as a captain in Lord Willoughby's disastrous expedition to France in 1589 and protested at the hardships thus incurred. Knighted in 1589, he was active in raising volunteers for Norris's expedition of that year, for Cadiz in 1596, and for the Netherlands in 1601&#150;2. With his cousin Sir Richard Leveson he shipped 2000 soldiers from Rochester for Ireland in 1601. Besides warning the government about the unpopularity of musters, he had earlier passed on a massive protest about taxation in 1593. He also served as captain of Upnor Castle from 1596, and advised the government about the placing of beacons.<br>
<br>Leveson was more directly linked with the court in the procurement of supplies for the royal household, and with the arrangements for Queen Elizabeth's Kent progress in 1596. During her last illness he informed the court about the security of the county, and later he reported treasonable talk against the new king, James I. The supervision of recusants, and the detection and apprehension of Jesuits and seminary priests, were also of concern to the government. Leveson entered parliament as MP for Bossiney in 1584, probably owing to Mildmay's influence, and later sat for Maidstone and Kent, being active also in the 1614 election there. He served on several parliamentary committees, most notably in 1601 when three of the four had particular reference to Kent. A Cecilite, he built up connections at court which were to prove invaluable. Executor to William, Lord Cobham, he was entrusted with the funds for Cobham College. Leveson was equally trusted by Henry, Lord Cobham, and helped him during his imprisonment.<br>
<br>On 8 February 1601, riding to his house in Blackfriars, Leveson suddenly became involved in Essex's revolt. The earl of Cumberland and the bishop of London had collected a large body of men on Ludgate Hill; Leveson was asked to take command. He stationed the halberdiers behind a chain drawn across the road, and armed the musketeers. Within half an hour Essex, coming from St Paul's Churchyard with a great company, was halted at the barrier. Recognizing Leveson, Essex sent two envoys to him asking for passage. He refused both persuasion and threats. Shots were fired when Essex's men tried to force their way through. Leveson's men gave no ground and returned the fire. Seeing that Sir Christopher Blount was injured, Essex called his men off and withdrew to Essex House.<br>
<br>When promoting the navigation of the Medway, Leveson had come into conflict with Thomas Sackville, later earl of Dorset and lord treasurer. The sudden death of his cousin Admiral Sir Richard Leveson in 1605 made Sir John's young son Richard (1598&#150;1661) possessor of the great Leveson estate (over 30,000 acres) in Staffordshire and Shropshire. Sackville now showed himself Leveson's mortal enemy. In his official capacity he demanded &pound;40,000 for treasure allegedly taken from the <i>St Valentine</i> carrack by Sir Richard. Then, with Sackville's support, a forged will was produced making Sir Richard's cousin Mary Curzon the heir; Mary was married to Sackville's younger grandson. Finally Sir John Leveson had to settle Sir Richard's debts. The carrack claim was settled for &pound;5000, the forgery exposed, and much of the debt paid. But Sir John observed in his will that he had spent &pound;18,000 more in clearing the estate than it had paid in income. Important for his public services, Leveson had survived in the harsh world of the Jacobean court. After a short illness, he died at Whornes Place on 14 November 1615, and was buried on 22 November at Cuxton parish church.<br>
