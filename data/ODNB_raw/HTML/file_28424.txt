<span class="headword">Wakering,  John</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1425), <span class="occ">administrator and bishop of Norwich</span>, was from Great Wakering, Essex, where he provided for prayers for the souls of his parents and brothers. While he had poor relations there, two other kinsmen served as master of St Bartholomew's Hospital, Smithfield, which had the patronage of Great Wakering church. The bishop's own first preferment was St Benet Sherehog.<br>
<br>On 13 April 1380 a chaplain named John Wakering was pardoned his outlawry after failing to appear in the London hustings court on a charge of illegal retaining. However, the certain career of the bishop can only be traced from 1392 when he was already a senior member of the administration of John of Gaunt, duke of Lancaster. In March of that year Wakering appears as deputy to the chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster. He was chancellor of the county palatine by 4 August 1395, and probably even a year earlier, while in 1394&#150;5 he held also the privy seal of the duchy. He then began to work for the king as well. First termed a royal clerk in October 1394, he was a master in chancery in 1395 and acted as a receiver of petitions for Gascony in both parliaments in 1397. However, when the king banished Gaunt's heir, Henry Bolingbroke, in 1398, Wakering was naturally appointed on 8 October as one of the attorneys to care for the exile's interests. Richard reneged on this agreement when Gaunt died, and confiscated the duchy and county palatine.<br>
<br>When Henry Bolingbroke took the throne, his long-standing confidence in Wakering was demonstrated at once. On 15 October 1399 Wakering was reappointed as chancellor of the county palatine, a post he still held in February 1403 and probably retained until March 1405, and from 25 November 1402 he was also paid as chancellor of the duchy. Between 1400 and 1402, moreover, he acted as a duchy attorney in chancery, of which he was still a master. On 2 March 1405 the king brought him wholly into the royal administration as keeper of the rolls of chancery, an office he would hold for ten years.<br>
<br>Wakering's ecclesiastical preferments had been augmented steadily by Gaunt and Bolingbroke, the rectory of Orpington, Kent, being the one he remembered especially on his deathbed, but on 10 March 1409 he was granted no less than the archdeaconry of Canterbury by the crown. Although he was admitted promptly to the confraternity of Christ Church, Canterbury, and could offer the cathedral useful connections in its legal and other administrative dealings with the crown, his inevitable absence from his responsibilities as archdeacon (which were considerable) is unattractive. This archdeaconry, at least, was usually provided with a full-time occupier. Wakering's regular duties in chancery engaged him in such occasional work as acting as proctor for various ecclesiastical bodies and prelates in parliaments between 1404 and 1416, acting as a receiver of petitions for England there in May 1413 and April and December 1414, deputizing for the dean of St Martin's-le-Grand, London, in January 1411, and acting three times as custodian of the great seal (19&#150;31 January 1410, 10/12&#150;20 June 1411, and 20 December 1411&#150;17 January 1412) while the king and prince of Wales contested for control of the chancellorship and government.<br>
<br>On his accession Henry V was content to continue Wakering in office, even while dismissing those who had served his father in the greatest offices. Wakering was granted letters of attorney on 8 October 1413 because he was going abroad, but nothing more is known of this proposed journey. On 3 June 1415 Wakering was appointed as keeper of the privy seal to succeed John Prophete, who had himself served nine years in that office. Unlike his seven immediate predecessors, Prophete had not obtained a bishopric, by his own account because he refused to intrigue for one. Wakering, by contrast, had instant success. The king's close friend Richard Courtenay, bishop of Norwich, died at the siege of Harfleur at the age of thirty-three. The monks were given licence to elect on 3 November 1415, and royal assent to their choice of Wakering (no doubt by nomination from the crown) was given on 24 November. The Council of Constance was then in session, and on the following day the crown wrote to the papal curia, as being located there, to signify the choice of Wakering. However, John XXIII had been deposed, Gregory XII had resigned, and Benedict XIII was an unrecognized renegade. After some hesitation, the king wrote on 7 April 1416 to the archbishop of Canterbury, instructing him to confirm Wakering's position; Chichele did so on 27 May, and the temporalities were restored on the same day. Wakering was consecrated in St Paul's Cathedral on 31 May. He thus became the first bishop in England for seventy years not to be papally provided to his see. Looked at in another way, he was to be the last non-graduate &#145;civil servant&#146;, of a kind so familiar in the previous century, to achieve episcopacy.<br>
<br>Wakering resigned as keeper of the privy seal on 7 July 1416, but not in order to turn to diocesan life. On 20 July he was appointed as a royal delegate to the Council of Constance where Henry V intended to strengthen the English presence substantially, and also to rein in Bishop Robert Hallum's reforming enthusiasm by making him share the leadership of the delegation with four bishops who had risen through the royal administration and would serve the king's will. Wakering did not return to England until about February 1418, and only in the following month did he finally enter his diocese.<br>
<br>Wakering held no more offices of state, but he did continue to be used as a councillor, and still more so after being appointed to the council of regency for the infant Henry VI on 9 December 1422. It has been assumed that this made him a gross absentee from his diocese, but his register proves otherwise; he was a vigorous commuter and managed to spend most of his time in his see. Until March 1419 he chose Hoxne, Suffolk, as his base, making tours of primary visitation in May and September&#150;October 1418. Thereafter he lived almost entirely at Bishopthorpe; his career had quite probably given him a distaste for administration by wagon train. Indeed, his handling of his diocese seems exactly as might be predicted from his career: competent and uneventful. This should, however, be contrasted with the unsavoury feuds with Norwich Cathedral and city, and with the town of Lynn, which his two predecessors sustained; it would be surprising if Wakering simply found peace by lethargy. It must be noted that in the valleys south-east of Norwich towards Lowestoft lived scores of Lollards whom Wakering's successor, William Alnwick, had no difficulty scouring out in 1428&#150;31. Wakering accepted the compurgation in July 1424 of the chaplain, Hugh Pye of Loddon, Norfolk, who was to prove a leading figure in this sectarian network, and of two other men whose kin were to prove implicated. He delved no further. On the other hand, Alnwick only acted with vigour when the archbishop told him to.<br>
<br>Wakering returned to Bishopthorpe from his last trip to London in early March 1425. His will (29 March) was predictably long and meticulous, and carefully remembered his earlier benefices, his family, and his servants. He had a collection of his own sermons to bequeath. There is, however, more than this to Wakering's final thoughts. Throughout the will there is persistent attention to paupers, not so much for those at his own funeral (for whom he left just 20 marks), but notably in his own properties, past benefices, and especially those in hospitals and across his diocese, these last being left no less than 1000 marks. Furthermore, the bishop recalled the celebrated aphorism of St Augustine of Hippo that funerals were more a solace for the living than help to the dead, and asked for unpompous rites on the day of his death, but 1000 masses on that same day if possible. Wakering died on 9 April 1425. He had, of course, arranged his burial site, tomb chest (still extant, though without its brass), and chantry in the cathedral, on the south side of the presbytery by that of the founder.<br>
