<span class="headword">Littleton, Sir  Thomas</span>, third baronet  (1647&#150;1709), <span class="occ">speaker of the House of Commons</span>, was born on 3 April 1647, the second but eldest surviving son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/58142/', "Sir Thomas Littleton, second baronet (1619/20?&#150;1681)")</script>, of Stoke St Milborough, Shropshire, and North Ockenden, Essex, and his wife, the Hon. Anne (1623&#150;1705), daughter and heir of Edward Littleton, first Baron Lyttleton of Mounslow. As a younger son Littleton was apprenticed to a City merchant, but on the death of his elder brother, Edward, he was sent to Oxford where he matriculated at St Edmund Hall in April 1665. He entered the Inner Temple the following year and was called to the bar in 1671. On his father's death, on 14 April 1681, he succeeded to the baronetcy, and on 6 September 1682 he married Anne (<i>bap</i>. 21 Aug 1663, <i>d</i>. 1714), daughter and heir of Benjamin Baun of Westcote, Gloucestershire; they had no children.<br>
<br>Littleton was elected to the convention of 1689 for Woodstock, Oxfordshire, through the interest of his kinsman Sir Littleton Osbaldeston, first baronet, and continued to represent the town until 1702. His whiggish outlook had been moulded against the background of his father's prominence as a presbyterian spokesman in Charles II's Cavalier Parliament, although as an adult he had also imbibed lessons from his father's bitter experiences of factional politics. Moderation, pragmatism, and good sense were always Littleton's chief strengths, and his even and agreeable temper made him a great advocate of restraint and conciliation. The irony of Littleton's career was that these sterling abilities, coupled with a flair for financial administration, should make him a compliant tool from the early 1690s of the Junto whigs.<br>
<br>Littleton soon made his mark in parliament as a diligent spokesman for the court. He was made a commissioner of prizes in June 1689 in recognition of his efforts in the promotion of measures to ensure the stability of the revolution settlement; promotion to the clerkship of the ordnance followed in 1690. His association with the Junto group began during their embryonic phase early in William III's reign, and it was highly significant that Littleton should be chosen in 1693 to succeed one of them, Sir John Somers, as chairman of the committees of supply and ways and means. In this demanding role Littleton was responsible for supervising the court's financial measures through the House of Commons. It also involved him in the informal processes of managing the court's supporters and he regularly briefed them on government measures at meetings of the back-bench Rose Club. In March 1695 Littleton was put forward as the Junto's choice for the speaker's chair following the disgrace of Sir John Trevor, but on this occasion the favoured candidate was Paul Foley. Littleton's rising importance to the Junto dominated ministry was acknowledged in his appointment in April 1696 to a place on the Treasury board. In this new capacity Littleton worked closely with his Junto friend Charles Montagu, the chancellor of the exchequer, in ensuring the survival of the newly established Bank of England, and in the execution of a broad programme of financial reconstruction.<br>
<br>Following the 1698 general election Littleton was elected speaker of the House of Commons without challenge. In May the following year, at his own request, he was transferred from the Treasury board to the more profitable treasurership of the navy. However, Littleton's term as speaker proved brief and stormy. The Junto ministry grew unpopular and was subject to increasing opposition in the Commons. Littleton's efforts to appear impartial while doing his best to serve his Junto masters weakened his authority. Worse still an aggravated bladder problem, necessitating frequent exits from proceedings, made him a laughing stock. When parliament returned after the next election in January 1701 he was replaced by Robert Harley. Littleton was now able to devote much fuller attention to the Navy Office. Despite the appointment of a mainly tory administration at the accession of Queen Anne in 1702 he retained the treasurership, and was to do so for the rest of his life. Through a series of far-reaching reforms he was able to rationalize the office's chaotic accounting procedures, thereby leaving a legacy which remained in force for much of the eighteenth century.<br>
<br>Littleton lost his safe electoral haven at Woodstock in 1702, but was MP for Castle Rising in Norfolk, 1702&#150;5, for Chichester in Sussex, 1705&#150;8, and for Portsmouth from 1708 until his death. His links with the junto whigs largely ceased in these later years. He remained a government supporter, and in debates on major questions was always particularly attentive to the defence of procedural form. Commanding the respect due to a former speaker he &#145;often diverted the House of Commons with a pleasant story which was always apropos&#146;  (newsletter, 3 Jan 1710, BL, Add. MS 70421). He died on 31 December 1709, his baronetcy becoming extinct, and was buried at his home parish of North Ockenden in Essex.<br>
