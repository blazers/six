<span class="headword">White family</span>  (<em>per. </em>1795&#150;1846), <span class="occ">shipowners and merchants</span> of Sunderland, first came to prominence through <a name="cosubject_49397"></a><span class="headword">John White</span>  (1764&#150;1833)<span class="occ"></span>, who was born at Monkwearmouth, co. Durham, and began his working life as a cooper in the 1780s. During the French wars White diversified his business activities into shipowning to take advantage of boom conditions in this sector, and by 1814 he had accumulated a fleet of 1300 tons with the high value of &pound;2300. In spite of the prolonged post-war economic downturn and the depreciation of shipping values, White's fleet made profits in all but one year during the period 1818&#150;32. This was achieved through the diverse deployment of his fleet in a range of different trades. In addition he made good use of his strategic position in the coal trade, where he also had mining and fitting interests which enabled him to obtain rapid turn-round for his vessels. On 27 May 1788 White married Jane (1769&#150;1826), daughter of Andrew Young, a local ship's chandler; eight children of the marriage survived into adulthood.<br>
<br>By the time of his death on 5 July 1833 at Bishopwearmouth, White had become one of Sunderland's most eminent merchants and shipowners. His death occurred in the middle of a major commercial depression, at which time his sworn effects were valued at only &pound;18,000. The business was carried on by two of his sons, <a name="cosubject_49398"></a><span class="headword">Andrew White</span>  (1792&#150;1856)<span class="occ"></span> and <a name="cosubject_49399"></a><span class="headword">Richard White</span>  (<em>b. </em>1804?)<span class="occ"></span>, under whose direction it continued to expand and diversify throughout the 1830s. In June 1814 Andrew White married Ophelia, daughter of a local shipowner, Hugh Dixon. Richard White married Mary, daughter of Stephen Watson, a draper, in August 1827.<br>
<br>The influence of the Whites also extended into local social and political life. John White was renowned for his philanthropy and his support of the Methodist movement. He championed such causes as the building of schools, the abolition of church rates, and winter charity for the poor. Andrew White continued his father's social work and was associated with almost every local charity and benevolent institution, supporting religious nonconformity, temperance, and improvements in education. The family's highly active role in local politics can be seen from the fact that Andrew was closely involved in reviving the ancient corporation of the borough under the <span class="roman">Municipal Corporations Amendment Act</span> and was elected the first mayor of the new corporation in 1836. He went on to hold the position two more times. Richard White, too, was mayor on one occasion. Andrew's other local responsibilities included being chief magistrate of the borough, justice of the peace, and deputy lieutenant for the county of Durham. He was also MP for Sunderland between 1837 and 1841. Although he remained on the back benches he spoke up in favour of reform on several occasions. However, reformist principles could still take second place to self-interest; in a debate on the navigation laws in 1840 a fellow MP accused him of abandoning his free-trade beliefs when it came to protection for the shipping industry.<br>
<br>As devout Christians sincerely concerned about corruption in the Church of England, the Whites reflected their wide reformist outlook in their religious work. Andrew White was involved with various religious groups in Sunderland and, during his time as an MP, with various causes in London, including the Presbyterian Mission, the London Missionary Society, the Religious Tract Society, and the Zion Chapel. He defended his interdenominationalism in a short tract recommending mutual forbearance among religious groups. His reformist beliefs were at odds, however, with the more conservative-minded national Wesleyan leadership, and in 1836 he was one of the leading figures among Sunderland Methodists to break away from the official Methodists to join the Wesleyan Methodist Association.<br>
<br>In addition to both their philanthropic activities and their own private business interests, the White family were also actively involved in company promotion during the joint-stock boom of the mid-1830s. They played a leading role in the flotation of many local companies, in industries as diverse as railways, banking, soap manufacture, and insurance. Like many contemporary entrepreneurs, they had private and corporate interests which overlapped in a manner that was sometimes mutually beneficial but that on other occasions resulted in a conflict of interest and, frequently, corruption. The collapse of the Sunderland Joint Stock Bank in 1851 led to allegations that the brothers and their associates had used the bank's funds extensively for personal loans without the necessary degree of scrutiny. By the early 1840s the family business was beginning to weaken under the pressure of adverse economic conditions and an over-commitment to social and political activities. In 1846 the firm collapsed and the two brothers were declared bankrupt. Although Andrew White continued in employment as secretary of the Wear and Durham district coal trade committee, his fortunes never recovered significantly from the bankruptcy; when he died a decade later, on 1 October 1856 at Bishopwearmouth, his effects were valued at only &pound;800. The year of Richard White's death is not known.<br>
<br>The Whites were one of Sunderland's leading business families during the first half of the nineteenth century, and they also played an influential role in local political and religious affairs. Before the collapse of their business Andrew and Richard White had interests stretching across the principal sectors of the local economy, and were involved in banking, shipowning, and the coal and timber trades, as well as metallurgy and engineering.<br>
