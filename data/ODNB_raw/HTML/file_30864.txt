<span class="headword">Brown,  William</span>  (1888&#150;1975), <span class="occ">mycologist and plant pathologist</span>, was born on 17 February 1888 at Middlebie, Dumfriesshire, the second son and child of Gavin Brown, small farmer and agricultural engineer, and his wife, Margaret Broatch. In 1900 he went to the Annan Academy as a day scholar, obtaining in 1904 a leaving certificate in mathematics, English, Latin, French, and German, and a bursary for Edinburgh University. In 1908 he took his MA degree, with first-class honours in mathematics, qualifying also in physics and other sciences. Until 1906 he had continued to study Latin (first prize and medal); for the rest of his life he read both Greek and Roman authors in their native texts. Following graduation he spent two more years at Edinburgh, qualifying in 1910 for a BSc in advanced botany and zoology. Over the six years of his studies he was awarded fourteen medals.<br>
<br>In 1912, after two years as a temporary lecturer in plant physiology in the Edinburgh botany department, Brown gained a two-year scholarship to the botany department of the Imperial College of Science and Technology. He became a research student under Vernon Blackman, and was awarded a London DSc in 1916. In 1923 he was appointed assistant professor on the college staff, and in 1928 was made professor of plant pathology in the University of London, the first such post to be established in Britain. In 1921 Brown had married Lucy Doris Allen (<i>d</i>. 1966), a graduate of London University (Bedford College) with first-class honours in botany; she was the daughter of a shipping agent and her mother was from a family of London clockmakers. They had a son and three daughters, one of whom, Lucy, taught at the London School of Economics.<br>
<br>Brown's experimental work on the physiology of fungal growth in culture and of infection of plant tissues was published in a series of eighteen papers (1915&#150;28), and is regarded as a pioneering achievement in these twin subjects. He showed that soft-rot of plant tissues is mediated by fungal secretion of pectinase enzymes and that fungal infectivity is enhanced by nutrients diffusing through the thin cuticle of flower petals and young leaves. His studies of the growth of fungi of the genus <i>Fusarium</i> in culture revealed serious flaws in the taxonomic disposition of species within the genus, which was later revised accordingly. In his paper on combinations of gas and cold storage for control of fungal rots of apple fruits, which was published in the <span class="italic">Annals of Botany</span> in 1922, Brown concluded that the effect of fungistatic factors was greatest when the fungal energy of growth was least. This was Brown's major generalization; it led to the concept of fungal inoculum potential for colonization of plant tissues, both living and dead.<br>
<br>As a supervisor Brown was regarded with affection and respect by his research students. Although he may have appeared conventional in dress and behaviour, his approach to research was anything but so. In his lectures to undergraduates he disdained any tricks of oratory, and his lucid exposition, enlivened by flashes of dry humour, compelled close attention. These qualities are revealed by his lecture entitled &#145;Spontaneous generation&#146;, published in the Royal College of Science <span class="italic">Journal</span> in 1952.<br>
<br>In 1938 Brown was elected FRS. In the same year, he became head of the botany department and continued thus until his retirement in 1953, overseeing a difficult period of post-war reconstruction. As a young man Brown was quite athletic; he was a competent golfer and tennis player. After retirement his chief outdoor interest was gardening. He died in Manchester on 18 January 1975.<br>
