<span class="headword">Pinkerton,  John Maurice McLean</span>  (1919&#150;1997), <span class="occ">computer engineer</span>, was born on 2 August 1919 at 18 Somerset Terrace, St Pancras, London, the elder son and eldest of the three children of John McLean Pinkerton (1890&#150;1957), a surgeon, and his wife, Nora Dorothy, <i>n&eacute;e</i> O'Flyn (1880&#150;1968), a medical practitioner. His family moved to Bath when he was six, and he was educated at King Edward VI Grammar School, Bath (1927&#150;32), and Clifton College, Bristol (1932&#150;7). As a schoolboy he developed an interest in science and radio, constructing sets of increasing complexity from the age of twelve. His parents wanted all their children to follow them into the medical profession, and while his siblings did, he thwarted their expectations by winning a scholarship to study natural sciences at Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1937; he graduated with first-class honours in 1940. He then became a scientific civil servant, working on war-related radar research, first at the Air Ministry Research Establishment, Swanage (1940&#150;42), and then at the telecommunications research establishment, Malvern (1942&#150;5). In 1945 he became a research student under the physicist J. A. Ratcliffe in the Cavendish Laboratory, Cambridge, obtaining a PhD in 1948. On 18 December the same year he married Helen Inglis McCorkindale (<i>b</i>. 1923), an administrative civil servant. They had a son and a daughter.<br>
<br>While Pinkerton was at the Cavendish Laboratory, the Cambridge University mathematical laboratory was in the process of constructing a computer, the EDSAC, under the direction of Maurice Wilkes, whom Pinkerton came to know from attending his talks on computer developments. At the same time the catering firm of J. Lyons had decided to make a copy of the EDSAC for administrative purposes (there then being no commercially available computers). With Wilkes's recommendation, in January 1949 Pinkerton joined Lyons to become chief engineer for the LEO (Lyons' Electronic Office). A gifted and intuitive engineer, he made several innovations to ensure the LEO computer's suitability for business use, the most important of which was &#145;marginal testing&#146;, by which defective components were replaced in a planned manner instead of failing unpredictably in operational use. This became a standard industry practice. The 6000-valve LEO became operational in early 1951, and gradually took over much of Lyons office routine. Word spread wide in the business community and several other firms expressed interest in having a machine. So, in 1955 Lyons decided to go into the computer business and created a subsidiary, Leo Computers Limited. There Pinkerton oversaw the development of LEO's successors, LEO II and LEO III. He was appointed a director in 1959.<br>
<br>The early 1960s brought intense American competition to the computer industry, resulting in an inevitable consolidation among the British players. In 1963 Leo Computers was taken over by English Electric, where Pinkerton became head of computer research. During 1967&#150;8, with the urging of Harold Wilson's Labour government, the two major players in the British computer industry&#151;International Computers and Tabulators and English Electric Computers&#151;merged to form a national-champion computer manufacturer, International Computers Limited (ICL). After the merger Pinkerton became a member of the planning team that specified ICL's flagship computer range, the 2900 series, though he never subsequently found a role that fully matched his technical ability. He spent the remainder of his career in ICL as manager of strategic requirements, taking a special interest in office automation, computer-aided design, and standardization. He was prominent in external affairs, serving on the general assembly of the European Computer Manufacturers Association, of which he was twice president. He also represented ICL in numerous trade associations, government inquiries, and publicly funded research programmes.<br>
<br>In his retirement, Pinkerton remained a force in British computing. He operated as a consultant, lectured frequently, and was a technical author and editor. He held various offices in the Institution of Electrical Engineers, was a council member of the British Computer Society, and was a member of court of the Worshipful Company of Information Technologists (founded in 1982 to promote the information technology profession in the City of London).<br>
<br>Tall, spare of frame, and bespectacled, Pinkerton had on first introduction an academic and slightly austere manner which then quickly warmed. His eclectic interests and pastimes included theatregoing, classical music and opera, the visual arts, bridge, crosswords, photography, and do-it-yourself projects of all kinds. He and his wife entertained at home frequently, and cultivated a wide circle of friends. He died at his home, Thornbrake, Sandown Road, Esher, Surrey, on 22 December 1997, and was buried at Cobham cemetery after a funeral service at Christ Church, Esher, on 5 January 1998. He was survived by his wife and their two children. The Institution of Electrical Engineers subsequently established the annual John Pinkerton lecture and the Worshipful Company of Information Technologists the John Pinkerton journeyman award in his honour.<br>
