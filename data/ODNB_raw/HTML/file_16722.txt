<span class="headword">Lindsey,  Theophilus</span>  (1723&#150;1808), <span class="occ">Unitarian minister and theologian</span>, was born at Middlewich, Cheshire, on 20 June 1723, the youngest son of Robert Lindsey (<i>d</i>. 1742) and his second wife (<i>d</i>. 1747). His father was a mercer who also had interests in the salt trade. His mother, whose maiden name was Spencer, had resided for many years with Frances, countess of Huntingdon, whose son, Theophilus, earl of Huntingdon, was the boy's godfather.<br>
<br>Lindsey was educated at Middlewich grammar school and at the free grammar school at Leeds, under its celebrated headmaster Thomas Barnard. In 1741 he matriculated at St John's College, Cambridge, and after graduating BA in 1744 was in 1747 elected a fellow of his college. He was ordained deacon in 1746 and priest a year later. He was then presented to a chapel in Spital Square, London on the recommendation of Lady Ann Hastings, who, like her sister, Lady Betty Hastings, had from his earliest years shown him many kindnesses, as did their niece by marriage, the evangelical countess of Huntingdon. Shortly afterwards he became domestic chaplain to Algernon Seymour, seventh duke of Somerset, and after the duke's death in 1750 became tutor to his grandson, Hugh Smithson, afterwards second duke of Northumberland. He accompanied his pupil on a continental tour between 1751 and 1753. On relinquishing this post in the latter year he was presented by the earl of Northumberland (subsequently the first duke) to the valuable rectory of Kirby Wiske, Yorkshire, but he resigned this living in 1756 for that of Piddletown, Dorset, which was in the gift of the earl of Huntingdon.<br>
<br>On 29 September 1760 Lindsey married Hannah Elsworth (1740&#150;1812), the stepdaughter of his friend <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2513/', "Archdeacon Francis Blackburne")</script>, and soon afterwards adopted Blackburne's latitudinarian views on subscription to the <span class="roman">Thirty-Nine Articles</span>. He declined in 1762 the offer of the chaplaincy made by the duke of Northumberland when appointed lord lieutenant of Ireland. In 1763 he left Piddletown for the vicarage of Catterick in Yorkshire, which though of less value enabled him to see more of Archdeacon Blackburne and other friends. In the controversy that arose on the publication of Blackburne's <span class="italic">The Confessional</span> in 1766, Lindsey strongly supported the latitudinarians and advocated a relaxation of the system of clerical subscription to the <span class="roman">Thirty-Nine Articles</span>. His own views had become Unitarian, and he helped to organize the Feathers tavern petition in 1771&#150;2, signed by over 200 persons, which was designed to change the laws on subscription [<i>see also </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/93823', "Feathers tavern petitioners")</script>]. On the rejection of the petition by the House of Commons (6 February 1772) he resigned his living, and on 28 November 1773 he preached his farewell sermon at Catterick. Lindsey had generously assisted his poor parishioners, and he was obliged to sell his plate and part of his library to maintain himself after leaving his rectory.<br>
<br>Lindsey and his wife arrived in London in the spring of 1774, and with the help of Joseph Priestley, Richard Price, and other prominent Unitarian friends a room was engaged in Essex House, Essex Street, which was fitted as a temporary chapel and opened for public worship in April of that year. He published for his congregation <span class="italic">A Liturgy, Altered from that of the Church of England, to Suit Unitarian Doctrine</span>, which he amended in later editions. His friends built a chapel for him in Essex Street, which opened on 29 March 1778, and this became the first Unitarian congregation.<br>
<br>Meanwhile Lindsey had issued an <span class="italic">Apology</span> (1774), giving his reasons for leaving the Church of England, and a history of the doctrine of the Trinity and Unitarianism. It reached a fourth edition by 1775, arousing both hostile and friendly criticism, to which he replied in the preface to his next work, <span class="italic">A Sequel to the &#145;Apology&#146;</span> (1776), which was the most elaborate, and in many respects the most valuable, of his contributions to dogmatic theology. Lindsey's Unitarianism was firmly Socinian, involving belief in the divine unity, and the humanity of Christ, together with a denial of Christ's pre-existence and atonement.<br>
<br>Early in 1783 it was arranged that John Disney, who, like Lindsey, had seceded from the Church of England, and had married Mrs Lindsey's stepsister, should serve as Lindsey's colleague at Essex Street Chapel. He was thus enabled to devote more time to theological writing and to campaigning for dissenting civil liberties. He reported on the moves for the repeal of the <span class="roman">Test and Corporation Acts</span> in 1787&#150;90 and organized an unsuccessful petition for the legal toleration of Unitarian worship in 1792. Lindsey was at first a reluctant dissenter: he had hoped to reform the Church of England from within. But subsequently his associates were drawn increasingly from the nonconformist sects. His closest colleague and friend was Priestley, whom he defended in <span class="italic">Vindiciae Priestleyanae, addressed to the students of Oxford and Cambridge, by a late member of the University of Cambridge</span> (1784); a second part appeared in 1790. In another work, <span class="italic">Conversations on Christian Idolatry</span>, issued in the following year, he once more vindicated his theological views.<br>
<br>In July 1793 Lindsey retired from his ministry at Essex Street, although he continued to reside in the minister's house. He responded to the Priestley riots and the travails of Unitarians in the wake of the French Revolution by reprinting Joseph Priestley's <span class="italic">Reply to Paine's &#145;Age of Reason&#146;</span>, with a preface of his own. In 1802 he published <span class="italic">Conversations on the Divine Government</span>. In 1800 he inherited considerable property from a member of his congregation, Elizabeth Rayner, and his last years were spent in comparative affluence. He died at his house in Essex Street on 3 November 1808, and was buried in the cemetery at Bunhill Fields, London, on 11 November.<br>
<br>Lindsey published many occasional sermons and pamphlets. A collection of his sermons, in two volumes, appeared in 1810. He was also a voluminous letter writer, and his correspondence is a valuable source of information for the religious history of the period.<br>
