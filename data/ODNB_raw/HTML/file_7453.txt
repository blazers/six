<span class="headword">Delaune,  William</span>  (1659&#150;1728), <span class="occ">college head</span>, was born on 14 April 1659 and baptized on 26 April at St Stephen, Coleman Street, London, the son of Benjamin Delaune of London, and Margaret, daughter of George Coney, a wealthy London merchant, and possibly grandson of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7450/', "Paul Delaune (c.1585&#150;1655?)")</script>. Educated at Merchant Taylors' School, London, from 1672, he proceeded to St John's College, Oxford, in 1675. He graduated BA in 1679, and proceeded MA in 1683 and BD in 1688. Once ordained he became chaplain to Peter Mews, bishop of Winchester, who presented him to the living of Chilbolton, Hampshire, in 1689.<br>
<br>In 1697 Delaune proceeded DD, and on 12 March 1698 was elected president of St John's, allegedly on account of his inherited wealth. Installed as a canon of Winchester in 1701, he was appointed vice-chancellor of the University of Oxford in October of the following year. As vice-chancellor, Delaune was chairman of the delegates to the university press. During his tenure of this office, which lasted until October 1706, the press's income (including the profits from the first two editions of Clarendon's <span class="italic">History of the Great Rebellion</span>) was calculated to be &pound;2773 3<i>s</i>. 9<i>d</i>. Only &pound;493 of this sum had been paid into the university chest, Delaune borrowing much of the remainder, probably to finance gambling debts. Thomas Hearne charged him, perhaps unfairly, with embezzlement. Delaune admitted making advances to himself out of the university exchequer but claimed he had every intention of repaying. When he was sued in 1709 by the chancellor's court for &pound;231 1<i>s</i>. 2<i>d</i>., Delaune appears to have agreed to pay &pound;300 in two portions. Canon William Stratford claimed that when Delaune admitted that he was unable to pay, the income from his college presidency was sequestered, but there is no evidence to confirm this. However, Delaune did default, and his successor to the vice-chancellorship, William Lancaster, determined to recover the debt in full. He charged Delaune with owing &pound;2280 3<i>s</i>. 9<i>d</i>., the difference between the press's income during Delaune's delegacy and the amount actually paid to the university. Lancaster met with no success, so obtained an order from the chancellor's court to sequester both Delaune's rectory of Long Hanborough, Oxfordshire, and his Winchester prebend. Between 1711 and 1720 a sum of &pound;2590 2<i>s</i>. was recovered.<br>
<br>Hearne suggested that an affection for cards and dice was the vice which contributed principally to Delaune's financial difficulties, and the outburst against the vice-chancellor by the &#145;terrae filius&#146; at the Act (encaenia) in 1703 confirmed that there were scandals attributable to Delaune. Nicholas Amhurst, expelled from St John's in 1719 by the president and fellows, printed a revengeful account of the encaenia incident in his series of pamphlets, <span class="italic">Terrae filius</span>, first published in 1721. Amhurst is also thought to have written the accusatory <span class="italic">Letter from a Student in Grubb Street</span> (1720).<br>
<br>Delaune is said to have lost his considerable fortune, as well as the money borrowed from the university chest and from colleagues. His financial situation was perilous; in 1711 his tory friends, notably the future lord chancellor, Simon Harcourt, were pressed to help. Harcourt planned to obtain for Delaune the lucrative bishopric of Raphoe. Two years later another attempt was made to secure for him the see of Derry. In spite of the chancellor's influence, Delaune was appointed to neither.<br>
<br>In 1715 Delaune successfully stood for election to the Lady Margaret divinity professorship. It was said that Delaune had swung the election in his favour by calling in all the bachelors of divinity who had left the university in debt; only two heads of houses and six doctors of divinity voted for him. Ironically, he was also appointed a delegate of the press and of accounts in 1721. The publication in 1728 of <span class="italic">Twelve Sermons upon Several Subjects and Occasions</span> (fulsomely dedicated to Lord Abingdon) was also an attempt to relieve his deep debts.<br>
<br>Delaune, of tory persuasion, did not allow his personal politics to interfere with potential advancement. In 1704 he had allied himself to the rising Robert Harley and developed close relations with Harcourt, Henry Sacheverell, and Francis Atterbury, but when times changed Delaune changed with them. Although chaplain to Queen Anne from 1703, during which time he acquired some reputation as a preacher (although Thomas Wagstaff declared that Delaune knew little of theology or patristics), Delaune determined that the queen's death in 1714 would not jeopardize his future; in spite of his personal politics he made sure to be seen praying for the new king some hours before it was announced that Anne had died, and was quick to dissociate himself from Harley in decline.<br>
<br>Delaune died, unmarried, on 23 May 1728, and was buried without the usual eulogistic epitaph in St John's College chapel. Wagstaff's humorous epitaph suggests that Delaune's appearance, with his broad-brimmed hat which put him into perpetual shade, his wide and flapping collars, and his agitated hand movements, were sufficient to make him both very noticeable and, apparently, distressing to young ladies.<br>
