<span class="headword">Smart,  John</span>  (<em>d.</em> in or after 1539), <span class="occ">abbot of Wigmore and suffragan bishop</span>, is of unknown origins. He is first recorded in 1498, as a novice member of St Augustine's Abbey, Bristol. About 1505 he became a scholar of St Mary's College, Oxford, and graduated BA on 19 June 1507. By 1511&#150;12, now a priest, he had become a canon of St Augustine's, though he spent this year studying in Paris. On 18 February 1514 he proceeded BTh. On 19 June 1518 Smart was elected abbot of Wigmore, Herefordshire, by Cardinal Wolsey's appointment; he may have applied, or even paid, for his preferment, but no details survive. In 1519 he assisted Charles Bothe, bishop of Hereford, by conducting visitations when Bothe was away at a church council. It was common at this time for the heads of religious houses to assist diocesan bishops by acting as suffragans, and the fact that Wigmore was the only non-exempt abbey in Hereford diocese made Smart an obvious candidate for such promotion there. Nothing happened quickly, but on 2 July 1523 Bothe applied to the papal curia for Smart's elevation, and on 13 July 1526 he was made bishop of Panada <i>in partibus</i> by papal provision; he was licensed to continue at Wigmore by being granted the abbotship <i>in commendam</i>. That year he ordained sixty-three candidates to different orders in Hereford Cathedral and remained suffragan bishop in that diocese until 1535. He also acted as suffragan in the dioceses of Worcester (1526&#150;31) and Llandaff.<br>
<br>When Smart became abbot, Wigmore had long been a source of concern to successive bishops of Hereford, but under its last abbot the monastery's reputation plumbed new depths. The first sign of trouble came in a letter from Smart to Thomas Cromwell in 1528, informing him that Cuthbert Marshall, archdeacon of York, was seeking his resignation and that Bothe had also written to Cardinal Wolsey. In a letter of 31 August 1529, Rowland Philippes, vicar of Croydon and one of Wolsey's emissaries, informed the cardinal that Smart had turned down his offer of a pension of 40 marks if he would resign and had observed that he did not expect the cardinal to last much longer. Philippes advised Wolsey that his only options were to leave Smart in place to destroy the abbey or to attempt to remove him by canonical process.<br>
<br>Wolsey fell from office before he could achieve anything. He had had genuine grounds for concern, for Wigmore faced the threat of financial destruction, so much so that on 17 January 1530 Bishop Bothe, concerned about the monastery's debts and crumbling buildings, handed over its administration to John Cragge, a cathedral prebendary, and John Lee, a canon of Wigmore. They were instructed to sequestrate and administer the revenues and to pay only the conventional allowances to the inmates. When another canon, Richard Cubleigh, returned from London to discover the change in administration (and his own depleted stipend), a fierce quarrel ensued, in which Cubleigh, after being attacked by John Tykkel, a supporter of Lee, drew his sword and killed his assailant.<br>
<br>Within a couple of years, however, Smart had regained control of the monastery, fully supported by Cubleigh, to whom the pope granted a dispensation on 25 March 1532. The abbot's standing and confidence appear to have been undiminished by his temporary suspension. He was appointed visitor for the diocese of Hereford on 11 March 1534, and a year later had no qualms about proposing himself (albeit unsuccessfully) for the recently vacated see of St Asaph, telling Cromwell in a letter dated 20 July 1535 that &#145;if I were a man of sufficient qualities I trust you would help me to succeed him&#146;  (<span class="italic">LP Henry VIII</span>, 8, no. 1073).<br>
<br>Meanwhile Wigmore continued to decay, and Smart's temporary replacement by Lee did nothing to improve relations between them. On 19 September 1536 Hugh Corwen, vicar-general to the new bishop of Hereford, Edward Fox, conducted a visitation. This was a delicate task for Corwen, as he had recently been ordained by Smart at Wigmore. That year's royal injunctions were perhaps delivered at the same time, though Fox delayed issuing his own for six months. While cautious in phrasing, the latter were nevertheless damning in content: presumably on the basis of Corwen's findings, Smart was effectively found to be guilty of incontinence and dilapidation, of bullying the abbey's inmates, and of selling off the monastery's possessions. The canons also came in for criticism, with Richard Cubleigh singled out for particular condemnation for failing to attend choir, engaging in the unmonastic pursuits of hunting and hawking, and brawling in the precincts.<br>
<br>When Fox died on 8 May 1538, a year after issuing his injunctions, little had changed at Wigmore. By then it was clear that the monasteries would not survive much longer, but Lee decided to stand up to his abbot one last time. On 7 September he travelled to Hereford to apply for permission to report Smart to Cromwell for contravening the royal injunctions. During Lee's absence Smart took the opportunity to search his room, claiming to be looking for a stolen vestment. The vestment did not materialize, but he did serendipitously discover an allegedly treasonous letter to the canon from none other than John Cragge, Lee's co-administrator at Wigmore during Smart's suspension.<br>
<br>Smart instantly attempted to use local influence to have Lee arrested at Wigmore Castle. The deputy constable, Sir John Croft, was under no illusions about the state of the monastery, and had complained to Cromwell five years previously that:<blockquote>My neighbour th'abbot of Wigmore were bound to pray for you, if ye would write unto him to reform himself and his brothers; for in my conscience there is no worse rule kept within England nor Wales than is there kept &hellip; of all hands. (<span class="italic">LP Henry VIII</span>, 6, no. 946)</blockquote>Clearly sympathetic to Lee (who acted as his chaplain), he claimed to have no authority to arrest him, and when Smart's agent John Brydges tried to do so, Croft threatened to smash his head open and put him in the stocks.<br>
<br>Croft agreed to hold Lee overnight at his own house and to take him next morning to see his father, Sir Edward Croft, who was a justice of the peace. Meanwhile other JPs travelled to Ludlow, to search and make an inventory of Cragge's house. Nothing treasonous was discovered, but Smart claimed that allegedly stolen goods were found together with a bag containing &pound;71, with the result that Cragge was arrested and sent to Cromwell. Meanwhile in Wigmore three days passed without news, so Sir Edward granted Lee's request that he, too, should be sent to Cromwell in order to present his charges. Twenty-nine articles against Smart, written by Lee and presented to Cromwell, survive, and it is reasonable to conclude that they were delivered at this time. They are similar to many of the counts referred to in Fox's injunctions, though even more lurid&#151;they include murder, rape, sexual incontinence, extortion, simony, superstition, illegal sales of property, wholesale ordinations of undesirables for payment, and gross mismanagement of the abbey and its community.<br>
<br>What Cromwell made of all of this remains unknown, but with the monastery's dissolution imminent, and the local gentry already vying for its assets, close investigation probably seemed futile. It must have also suited him politically to keep proceedings unresolved when he was justifying the destruction of monastic life in England. By the time that Bishop Rowland Lee of Coventry and Sir William Sulyard received the surrender of Wigmore over two months later, on 18 November 1538, Smart still had not responded to Lee's accusations. And when Bishop Lee went to Wigmore to complete the dissolution in early December, John Lee admitted that he could not support his charges, withdrew them, and renounced any intention of proceeding further. Acting on instructions received from Cromwell, the bishop immediately allowed Smart &#145;his goods&#146;. On 3 April 1539, moreover, Smart was granted a pension of &pound;80 per year, considerably more than the 40 marks (&pound;26 13<i>s</i>. 4<i>d</i>.) offered to him by Wolsey in 1529 and four times the pension granted to the previous abbot in 1518. With his future secured, Smart, along with Lee and Cragge, then disappeared into obscurity.<br>
<br>Over 300 years later John Smart was recovered from that obscurity by the historian J. A. Froude, who in 1857 presented the accusations against him as evidence for the decadence of the church in England on the eve of the Reformation, and in the process helped to make him something of a test case in a historiographical debate on late medieval monasticism that was conducted along largely confessional lines. The main protagonists were Francis Gasquet, who attempted to salvage Smart's reputation, and the scholarly controversialist G. G. Coulton, who applied himself to demolishing it again. It is a measure of Coulton's success that when David Knowles published a measured summary of the &#145;Wigmore case&#146; in 1950, although he dismissed Lee's accusations as the work of &#145;an irresponsible and malicious man &hellip; in many of its articles and details either pure fabrication or reckless gossip&#146;, he still concluded that Smart was an &#145;ambitious, dishonest and unworthy man&#146;  (Knowles, &#145;Last abbot&#146;, 145).<br>
<br>It is true that none of the charges against Smart can be corroborated, while at least one can be disproved: diocesan lists for Llandaff in 1534 show that he did not, as Lee asserted, ordain indiscriminately there. But Smart's propensity to scandal, the similarities between Lee's articles and Fox's injunctions, and the number of specific details included by Lee argue strongly that Smart was indeed totally unsuited to the position he held. He made no attempt to defend himself against Lee's allegations, while failing dismally in his attempts to discredit his accuser. The articles against Smart may have been the work of an angry and dissatisfied man, but Lee was also a canon of apparently exemplary conduct who had helped to save his house from financial ruin. His outburst against his abbot, though arguably imprudent, can certainly be defended on the grounds of inherent plausibility, making it only just that his charges should have ensured that history's view of Smart would not be as generous as his pension.<br>
