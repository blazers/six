<span class="headword">Walton,  Jacob</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1743), <span class="occ">mathematical controversialist</span>, was a Dubliner whose antecedents are unknown. A gentleman of the same name and place whose will (now lost) was proved in 1719 could have been his father. From 1719 to 1740 Walton's name appears in lists of subscribers to a dozen books, all but two published in Dublin. In 1731 &#145;Mr. Walton&#146; attended the first meeting of the Dublin Society, and two years later his full name appeared in the list of members. He came to public notice in England in 1735 as J. Walton, author of <span class="italic">A vindication of Sir Isaac Newton's principles of fluxions against the objections contained in &#145;The analyst&#146;</span>. The latter book had been published anonymously in London and Dublin in 1734 by George Berkeley (1685&#150;1753), bishop of Cloyne.<br>
<br>Berkeley's objections to fluxions (calculus) as expounded by Newton and Leibniz had centred around the logical absurdity of conceiving the ratio of two infinitely reducing quantities when both vanished; to believe in this fundamental construct of fluxions required an act of faith as great as that demanded by religion. Berkeley answered Walton, &#145;this Dublin Professor&#146;, in <span class="italic">A Defence of Free Thinking in Mathematics</span> (1735), accusing him of evading many of the issues and with the parting shot &#145;I leave him to be tried by his Scholars&#146;  (p. 71). Walton's rejoinder was <span class="italic">The Catechism of the Author [Berkeley] of &#145;The Minute Philosopher&#146; Fully Answer'd</span>. Still anonymous, Berkeley issued <span class="italic">Reasons for not Replying to Mr. Walton's Full Answer</span> (1735), in fact a sarcastic reply (&#145;a facetious man &hellip; an opponent who writes on my side of the Question&#146;; p. 4). Walton responded with an appendix to his <span class="italic">Catechism</span> (added also to a second edition of Berkeley's <span class="italic">Reasons</span>). All the tracts following Berkeley's first were published in Dublin in 1735, and all except <span class="italic">Reasons</span> in London also.<br>
<br>Walton based his counter-argument on Newton's <span class="italic">Principia</span> and <span class="italic">Quadratura curvarum</span>; while showing &#145;a good intuitive grasp of fluxions&#146;, he &#145;lacked deep philosophic insight&#146;  (Cajori, 93), and can be faulted on some explanations in his <span class="italic">Catechism</span>. Berkeley had shrewdly pinpointed weaknesses in the formulation of the theory that Walton failed to address. The argument was taken up by British mathematicians, including James Jurin (1684&#150;1750), Benjamin Robins (1707&#150;1751), and Colin Maclaurin (1698&#150;1746). The foundations of calculus still remained unsatisfactory, bedevilled by loyalty to Newton, shifting definitions, reliance on geometrical intuition, and lack of appropriate mathematical symbolism. The resolution emerged only in the early nineteenth century, through the work of A. L. Cauchy (1789&#150;1857) and others.<br>
<br>Since he did not use a forename on his tracts, Walton's identity became obscured. Influenced by Berkeley's reference and by Cajori  (p. 69), the entry in the <span class="roman">British Museum catalogue</span> (1964) reads &#145;WALTON (JOHN) Professor of Mathematics in Dublin University&#146;. There was none such: Jacob Walton was probably a private teacher of mathematics.<br>
<br>&#145;Jacob Walton, a very eminent Mathematician&#146;, died on 12 July 1743  (<span class="italic">Dublin Journal</span>) in Peter Street, Dublin; he was buried on 15 July in the city's parish of St Peter and St Kevin. The <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> added that he had &#145;left upwards of &pound;4,000 to his two Maid-servants&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 443), perhaps indicating that he had no close relative. Such a large sum was unlikely to have come from teaching alone.<br>
<br>Walton was one of those lesser mathematicians who, without original contribution, assimilated and disseminated Newton's ideas and techniques. For an Irish mathematician he was exceptional in having his writings noticed and reprinted in England.<br>
