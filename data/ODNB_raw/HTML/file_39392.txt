<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Cumming, Sir  William Gordon  Gordon-</span>, fourth baronet  (1848&#150;1930), <span class="occ">disgraced socialite</span>, was born on 20 July 1848 at Sanquhar House, near Forres, Moray, the eldest son and second of four children of Alexander Penrose Gordon-Cumming (1816&#150;1866), later third baronet, of Altyre and Gordonstoun, landowner and army officer, and his wife, Anne Pitcairn Campbell (<i>d</i>. 1888). He was a nephew of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6899/', "Roualeyn George Gordon-Cumming (1820&#150;1866)")</script>, pioneer big-game hunter, and of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/42347/', "Constance Frederica Gordon-Cumming (1837&#150;1924)")</script>, travel writer.<br>
<br>Educated at Eton College and Wellington College, Gordon-Cumming inherited his baronetcy at the age of eighteen. This title dated from 1804 but, as chief of the clan Cumming (or Comyn), he traced his descent to the fourth century via Charlemagne. His three Moray estates&#151;Altyre, near Forres; Gordonstoun, near Elgin; and Dallas&#151;totalled 38,500 unlucrative acres. In 1868 he purchased a commission in the Scots Fusilier Guards (renamed the Scots Guards in 1877). Asthma and blindness in the right eye did not prevent him seeking adventure. He volunteered for the Carlist War in Spain, hunted in the Rocky Mountains, stalked tigers on foot in India, and suffered shipwreck off Cape Town. He fought with his regiment at Ulundi in Zululand (1879), Tell al-Kebir in Egypt (1882), and Abu Klea in Sudan (1884). The army chose him to convey its condolences to the exiled Empress Eug&eacute;nie of France on the death of the prince imperial in 1879. As a lieutenant-colonel he exhibited dashing style. His speech was characterized by swearing in English and Hindustani; he did not have a Scottish accent.<br>
<br>An <i>habitu&eacute;</i> of the racecourse and gaming table, Gordon-Cumming won the friendship of Albert Edward, prince of Wales. He dined at Marlborough House, thrice stayed at Sandringham, and let the prince use his Belgravia home (2 Harriet Street) for secret liaisons. He too aspired to &#145;perforate&#146;&#151;his own expression&#151;large numbers of &#145;the sex&#146;, including Lillie Langtry, Sarah Bernhardt, Lady Randolph Churchill, and Daisy Brooke. Regular features, a fine moustache, persistence, and brazenness helped him: &#145;All the married women try me&#146;  (Leslie, 143). The &#145;fast set&#146; relished racy tales of Bill Cumming's audacity and insolent wit. He gloried in the sobriquet of the most arrogant man in London.<br>
<br>In September 1890 the prince of Wales had Gordon-Cumming invited to a house party at Tranby Croft, the home of shipping magnate Arthur Wilson, near Hull in the East Riding of Yorkshire. Baccarat, a gambling game using playing cards and counters, provided entertainment, with the prince acting as banker. Afterwards the host's son (Arthur) Stanley Wilson told his mother, his brother-in-law Edward Lycett Green, and his friend Berkeley Levett that he had seen Gordon-Cumming cheat by changing his stakes once the cards had been declared. The next day Mr and Mrs Lycett Green and Mrs Wilson thought they saw the same. They informed the senior courtiers present, Lord Coventry, master of the buckhounds, and Lieutenant-General Owen Williams. Lycett Green threatened to expose Gordon-Cumming (who may once have propositioned his wife). This risked compromising everyone involved, as baccarat had been illegal since 1885. In their anxiety to save the prince from scandal, Coventry and Williams did not pause to investigate the allegation. Instead they pressed Gordon-Cumming to sign a pledge never to play cards again in return for total secrecy. He reluctantly agreed while protesting his innocence.<br>
<br>The secret was not kept. Stung by gossip, Gordon-Cumming on 6 February 1891 instigated an action for slander against the Wilsons (mother and son), the Lycett Greens, and Levett, claiming &pound;5000 in damages. The trial opened on 1 June 1891 at the law courts in the Strand, presided over by Lord Coleridge, with Sir Edward Clarke appearing for the plaintiff, and Sir Charles Russell and H. H. Asquith for the five defendants. The prince of Wales was summoned as a witness. The case became a popular sensation, inspiring not only extensive press coverage but also several music-hall songs and jokes about &#145;backing a rat&#146;. The defendants maintained that the plaintiff had cheated. He denied that his subsequent pledge denoted an admission of guilt. He had been using the <i>coup de trois</i> system of betting, leaving his stake on and adding to it. His winnings amounted to &pound;225. None of the seasoned gamblers present had noticed anything wrong. When the jury found for the defendants after thirteen minutes on 9 June, hissing filled the courtroom. Many opined that the judge's summing-up had been unacceptably biased, and sympathizers regarded Gordon-Cumming as the victim of a botched royal cover-up. Others felt that he was just the type to have cheated at cards for the hell of it. Stern moralists denounced all illicit gambling; the prince had never been so unpopular.<br>
<br>The next day&#151;10 June 1891&#151;saw Gordon-Cumming dismissed from the army and married at Holy Trinity Church, Chelsea, before a mere half-dozen people. His bride was Florence Josephine Garner (<i>c</i>.1869&#150;1922), usually known as Flip, an orphaned American heiress, whose grandfather had made a fortune in textiles at Garnersville, New York. Her annual income stood in the region of $80,000. In refusing to break off the engagement, she horrified her family, who realized the severity of her husband's social ostracism. He resigned from his clubs (the Carlton, Guards', Marlborough, and Turf), while the future king declined to meet anyone who henceforth acknowledged the Scottish baronet. Gordon-Cumming said that he had twenty close friends, none of whom ever spoke to him again. Others relented only after the death of Edward VII.<br>
<br>The Gordon-Cummings, when not abroad, spent summers at Gordonstoun and winters at Altyre. Flip expensively renovated both mansions and bought one of the first motor cars in the highlands. About 1905, however, her investments suddenly slumped. Thereafter the big houses were let or shut up, Dallas had to be sold, and they lived at Bridge House, Dawlish, Devon, with only seven servants. Sir William was too proud a man to express bitterness at his isolation or to let himself run to seed; too proud also to adapt. His values remained precisely those of the society that rejected him. That said, needing company, he slightly masked his scorn for the second-rate and <i>nouveaux riches</i>. In his eyes, though, Dawlish was frankly a &#145;hole&#146;, Flip had become a fat little frump, and her churchgoing friends were tedious &#145;trouts&#146;. He filled his time with golf, croquet, billiards, cricket, bridge, riding, shooting, curling, fishing, collecting postmarks, and walking his pet monkey. The <span class="italic">Morning Post</span>, <span class="italic">Bystander</span>, and <span class="italic">Sporting Times</span> comprised his reading. Dogs mattered much to him, as did his children. Two daughters and three sons, born between 1892 and 1904, found their father humorous and more easy-going than their mother. The marriage had been soured by his sexual infidelities. Her ladyship said that she longed to be a nun and reminded him who paid the bills. She latterly took to drink.<br>
<br>Gordon-Cumming revisited South Africa in 1913&#150;14. During the First World War the couple rented a home in Cheyne Gardens, Chelsea, and Pitmilly House, Boarhills, Fife. They increasingly lived apart. An instinctive tory, in 1916 he took the lead in getting Ramsay MacDonald, an opponent of the war, expelled from the Moray golf club (one of his tenants), though his daughter Cecily later befriended the Labour leader. Widowed in 1922, Gordon-Cumming retired to Altyre with his heir, Alexander (or Alastair), who moved into Blairs House, the former parsonage. It was there that Sir William died of natural causes on 20 May 1930. He was buried three days later at the Michael Kirk, Gordonstoun, generally remembered exclusively in the context of the &#145;royal baccarat scandal&#146;.<br>
