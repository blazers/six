<span class="headword">Donkin,  Bryan</span>  (1835&#150;1902), <span class="occ">mechanical engineer</span>, was born on 29 August 1835 at 88 Blackfriars Road, London, the eldest son in the family of seven children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7811/', "John Donkin (1802&#150;1854)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7810/', "Donkin, Bryan (1768&#150;1855)")</script>], engineer, and Caroline, daughter of Benjamin Hawes. His was the third generation of the distinguished engineering dynasty founded by his grandfather, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7810/', "Bryan Donkin")</script> FRS, and he was known as Bryan Donkin junior. He was educated at private schools and University College, London, before spending two years on an engineering course at the &Eacute;cole Centrale des Arts et M&eacute;tiers in Paris. At the age of twenty-one he commenced his pupillage in the family engineering works of Bryan Donkin &amp; Co., then managed by his uncles.<br>
<br>In 1859 Donkin was sent to St Petersburg by the firm to superintend the construction of what was, at that time, the largest paper mill in Europe. The Donkins had obtained this contract in 1858 from the Russian government, for a mill to produce paper for banknotes and government stationery. In January 1862 he returned to London, and for the next six years worked for the family firm, designing and superintending the installation of machinery in Britain and on the continent. His European work brought him into contact with foreign engineers and engineering practice, which was to prove important in his later career. In 1868 Donkin became a partner in the firm, and when it was converted into a limited liability company in 1889 he became chairman. Although remaining as chairman after the amalgamation with Clench &amp; Co. of Chesterfield in 1900, he stopped having an active part in the management at that time. Donkin married his first wife, Georgina Mary (<i>b</i>. 1847/8), daughter of Frank Dillon, on 15 July 1869. They had a daughter and a son before Georgina died. On 14 February 1888 he married a widow, Edith Dunn, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Marshman (<i>b</i>. 1849/50); they had a daughter. Edith, who survived him, was to help him with his writing later in his career.<br>
<br>In the early 1870s the paper-making industry ceased to provide as much work for the firm as previously, and Donkin began to devote increasing amounts of his time to the scientific side of engine design. The earliest tests were concerned with the Farey engine, designed by Barnard William Farey, one of the partners in the firm. An example installed at a paper mill in Devon was tested with a view to measuring its efficiency and the result was published in <span class="italic">Engineering</span> (3 November 1871), giving the consumption of water and coal per horsepower hour. At that time such efficiency tests were unknown. Donkin's steam consumption test relied upon measuring the condensed water flowing over a tumbling bay or weir. He described the method in a joint paper with Salter and Martin that was presented to the Institution of Civil Engineers  (<span class="italic">Minutes of Proceedings</span>, 66, 1880&#150;81, 278&#150;94). Supported by <span class="italic">Engineering</span>, the tests rapidly gained acceptance in the engineering community.<br>
<br>This work was followed by research into the behaviour of steam in cylinders, and the advantages of jacketing and superheating. The research brought him into direct contact with Professor Dwelshauvers-Devy, and led Donkin to develop his &#145;revealer&#146;, a glass apparatus which, attached to a steam engine cylinder, enabled him to observe the extent of condensation under varying conditions. The insight which this gave into the state of the internal work of cylinders led to a long series of trials by Donkin himself, in collaboration with other leading engineers, such as Professor Hudson Bewe, Lieutenant-Colonel English, and Alexander Kennedy (1847&#150;1928). Kennedy and Donkin's tests on different types of boilers, initially published in <span class="italic">Engineering</span>, appeared as a book, <span class="italic">Experiments on Steam Boilers</span> (1897). A further work on steam boiler design, <span class="italic">The Heat Efficiency of Steam Boilers</span>, appeared in 1898.<br>
<br>In the 1890s Donkin became interested in internal combustion engines. He produced one of the earliest and most popular textbooks on the subject, <span class="italic">A Textbook on Gas, Oil and Air Engines</span> (1894), which was still in print, in its fifth edition, in 1911. He was also responsible for an early translation of Diesel's work <span class="italic">Theorie und Konstruktion eines rationellen W&auml;rmemotors</span>. He was an early member of the Automobile Club.<br>
<br>Donkin was an active member of many engineering societies, in the UK and overseas, presenting papers to the Institution of Civil Engineers, Institution of Mechanical Engineers, Incorporated Institute (later Institution) of Gas Engineers, Manchester Association of Engineers, and North of England Institution of Mining and Mechanical Engineers. He became a vice-president of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers in 1901, and was a member of its research committees on the steam jacket, marine engines, gas engines, and steam engines. For the Institution of Civil Engineers, which he joined in 1884, he served on committees on the thermal efficiency of steam engines, and on steam engine and boiler trials. At the end of his career Donkin was investigating the practicability of working gas engines using gases produced in blast furnaces, and this was the subject of his final paper in 1901.<br>
<br>Donkin's obituarist in <span class="italic">The Times</span>  (8 March 1902, 9e) declared that no other Englishman was in such close touch with progress on the continent. The subjects of his research were reflected in developments within his firm, which had begun building internal combustion engines in the 1890s, and developing boilers using the Perret system of forced draught which he advocated. Donkin died suddenly of heart failure at the Grand Hotel, Brussels, on 4 March 1902, and was buried at Bromley, Kent.<br>
