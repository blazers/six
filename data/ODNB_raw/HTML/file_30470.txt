<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Ashley,  (Anthony) Evelyn Melbourne</span>  (1836&#150;1907), <span class="occ">politician and biographer</span>, born in London on 24 July 1836, was the fourth son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6210/', "Anthony Ashley Cooper, seventh earl of Shaftesbury (1801&#150;1885)")</script>, politician and social reformer, and his wife, Emily (1810&#150;1872), daughter of Peter Leopold Cowper, fifth Earl Cowper; his maternal grandmother, sister of Lord Melbourne, married in 1839, as her second husband, Lord Palmerston.<br>
<br>Ashley, who appears never to have used his family's second surname, was educated at Harrow School and Trinity College, Cambridge, where he graduated MA in 1858. In the same year he became private secretary to Palmerston, then prime minister. The government was on the eve of defeat, and on its fall (1858) Ashley paid a visit to America with Lord Frederick Cavendish and Lord Richard Grosvenor. Palmerston returned to office the following year, and Ashley acted as his private secretary until the prime minister's death in 1865. Meanwhile he made more than one eventful excursion abroad. In 1860 he told Lord Palmerston that he was going to Italy to see what Garibaldi was doing and would take full advantage of his official position. Lord Palmerston replied that what his secretary did during his holiday was no business of his. With this implied permission, Ashley presented himself to Garibaldi in camp and was given ample facilities for watching the progress of the campaign. In 1863 he accompanied Laurence Oliphant on an expedition into the Russian province of Volhynia, where they were arrested on suspicion of being Polish insurgents  (Oliphant, 333). In 1865 he was attached to the mission sent to convey the Order of the Garter to Christian IX of Denmark, and was then created a commander of the Danish order of the Dannebrog.<br>
<br>In 1864 Ashley joined Algernon Borthwick and others in producing <span class="italic">The Owl</span>, the forerunner of society newspapers. The editors were intimately acquainted with current public and private affairs, and secured contributions of literary value. The publication attracted much attention during the six years of its existence. Ashley had become a student of Lincoln's Inn on 22 November 1856, and was called to the bar in 1863. After Palmerston's death (1865) he joined the Oxford circuit; he held the office of treasurer of county courts from 1863 until 1874. He devoted most of his time to the completion of <span class="italic">The Life of Lord Palmerston</span>, which had been begun by Lord Dalling but which was interrupted by his death in 1872. Lord Dalling published two volumes in 1870 and had written part of a third. This Ashley finished in 1874, and he added two concluding volumes which he published in 1876.<br>
<br>Ashley was well acquainted with the Liberals. It was his account that recorded Gladstone's dramatic declaration on receiving the queen's summons in December 1868, &#145;My mission is to pacify Ireland&#146;  (Ashley, obituary of Gladstone, <span class="italic">National Review</span>, June 1898). After defeat at the 1874 general election he was elected as a Liberal for Poole, Dorset, at a by-election on 26 May 1874. As a private member he persistently but unsuccessfully endeavoured to pass a bill to enable accused persons to give evidence. The principle was eventually sanctioned by Lord Halsbury's act of 1898. In 1879 he distinguished himself by his defence of Sir Bartle Frere from an attack by members of his own party. At the general election of 1880 he was returned for the Isle of Wight and was appointed parliamentary secretary to the Board of Trade in Gladstone's second administration. The president, Joseph Chamberlain, was also in the Commons, so that Ashley's parliamentary duties were light, but he presided over the railway rates committee (1881&#150;2). In 1882 he was transferred to the Colonial Office; the secretary of state was Lord Derby, and Ashley represented his department in the House of Commons. To him fell the important task of explaining the conditions of service in which the Australian contingents were to proceed to the Sudan in 1885. From 1880 to 1885 he was one of the ecclesiastical commissioners.<br>
<br>At the general election of 1885 Ashley was beaten in the Isle of Wight by Sir Richard Webster (Lord Alverstone). When Gladstone announced his adoption of the principle of home rule, Ashley joined the Liberal Unionists. At the general election of 1886 he stood as a Liberal Unionist for North Dorset, and was beaten. There followed a series of defeats&#151;at Glasgow, Bridgeton division, in 1887, at the Ayr burghs in 1888, and at Portsmouth in 1892 and 1895&#151;and although his active interest in politics never declined, he made no further attempt to renew his parliamentary career.<br>
<br>On the death in 1888 of his uncle, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6515/', "William Cowper-Temple, Baron Mount-Temple")</script>, Ashley succeeded to the properties bequeathed to Mount-Temple by Lord Palmerston, his stepfather&#151;Broadlands and Romsey in Hampshire, and Classiebawn, co. Sligo. He was sworn of the privy council in 1891. He was deputy lieutenant for Hampshire and a JP for Hampshire, Dorset, and Sligo, an alderman of the Hampshire county council, official verderer of the New Forest, and five times mayor of Romsey (1898&#150;1902). He was also chairman of the Railway Passengers' Assurance Company.<br>
<br>Ashley married twice: first, in 1866, Sybella Charlotte (<i>d</i>. 1886), daughter of Sir Walter and Lady Mary Farquhar (a tory family), with whom he had one son (<script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30471/', "Wilfrid William Ashley")</script>, MP for the Blackpool division of Lancashire) and two daughters; second, in 1891, Alice Elizabeth, daughter of William Willoughby Cole, third earl of Enniskillen, with whom he also had one son. Ashley died at Broadlands on 15 November 1907, and was buried at Romsey.<br>
