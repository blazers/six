<span class="headword">Harrison,  Edward</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1759, <em>d.</em> 1838), <span class="occ">physician</span>, was baptized on 4 November 1759 at St Michael's, Kirkham, Lancashire, the eighth child of Richard Harrison, landowner, of Bankfield and Singleton, both in Lancashire, and his wife, Agnes. He studied medicine at the University of Edinburgh (MD, 1784). After further study in London and Paris he settled in Lincolnshire, first in Louth and then in Horncastle, where in 1789 he was appointed first physician at the Horncastle Dispensary by Sir Joseph Banks. On 24 September 1790 he married Margaret Bickerstaffe, of Stanah Grange, Lancashire, at St Chad's, Poulton-le-Fylde. They had no children but from 1796 were guardians to the two sons and a daughter of Harrison's brother John.<br>
<br>Harrison was a member of the Medical Society of London, and with his collaborator Banks was awarded the society's silver medal in 1797 for their <span class="italic">Paper on the Solution of Iron in the Human and Canine Stomachs by Means of Diluted Nitric Acid</span>. One of the first physicians to recognize the parlous state of medical education and the practice of physic, he founded the Lincolnshire Medical Benevolent Society in 1804, which charged him with the investigation of medical practice in Britain. His findings, which included a vivid account of the scandalous extent of quackery, were published in 1806 as a pamphlet entitled <span class="italic">Remarks on the ineffective state of the practice of physic in Great Britain; with proposals for its future regulation and improvement</span>. This caused such a stir that Harrison threw himself into the cause of medical reform.<br>
<br>Harrison's proposals for reform of the education and organization of all medical practitioners had much merit. He moved to London where, with the backing of Sir Joseph Banks and the support of many influential physicians and members of parliament, a bill for medical reform was drawn up in 1806. William Pitt, the prime minister, promised his support but died before anything could be done. An additional obstacle was the opposition of the Royal College of Physicians, whose own bill had been rejected by parliament in 1806 and which still hoped to act as a national regulating body. Harrison persevered, and <span class="italic">Dr Harrison's Plan for a Medical Reform, and of the Sketch of a Bill for the Improvement of the Medical, and Surgical, and Veterinary Sciences, and for Regulating the Practice Thereof</span> appeared in 1810. The Royal College of Physicians remained implacable, arguing that Harrison's proposed regulations would lead to the loss of social rank and independence for the physician, and in 1811 Harrison and his allies abandoned medical reform, although Harrison's measures had some influence on the <span class="roman">Apothecaries Act</span> of 1815 and subsequent developments leading to the <span class="roman">Medical Act</span> of 1858.<br>
<br>Harrison's wife died in 1817, and on 14 August 1818, at Southwell, Nottinghamshire, he married Charlotte Chaplin (<i>bap</i>. 1770), daughter of Charles Chaplin of Tathwell Hall, near Horncastle. Soon afterwards he successfully reset his new wife's cousin's four displaced vertebrae by combining massage with rest for the patient on a special couch, and so began a new specialism in the treatment of spinal disorders, a subject on which his unorthodox views (<span class="italic">Pathological and Practical Observations on Spinal Diseases</span>, 1827, and <span class="italic">Observations on Spinal Diseases</span>, about 1832) were initially derided; they were, however, accepted after his death. He resigned from Horncastle Dispensary in 1821 and moved permanently to London. He chose to practise without a licence from his old rival, the Royal College of Physicians, thereby flouting the college's right to license all physicians practising in London, and leading to a court case in 1827 where Harrison was acquitted on a technicality by a sympathetic jury. The case inspired subsequent reform of the college's monopoly.<br>
<br>Harrison's efforts were eventually rewarded in 1832 when John Underwood, a former East India Company merchant, responded to the successful treatment of his ward by offering to support a charitable institution to make Harrison's methods available to the poor. With contributions from Underwood, other subscribers, and &pound;1000 from Harrison himself, Harrison's Spinal Institution opened at Stanhope Street, Hampstead Road, London, in 1837, allowing Harrison a wider selection of patients and the opportunity to train others in his methods. Harrison died in Marlborough, Wiltshire, on 6 May 1838, while on his way to the west country to see a patient with a spinal affliction. He was survived by his second wife, and was buried next to his first wife in St Mary's churchyard, Horncastle. He had recently given &pound;300 to the North London Hospital. In his will he left &pound;3000 to his Spinal Institution and &pound;100 each to the Horncastle Dispensary, Horncastle grammar school, and the Lincolnshire Medical Benevolent Society. His Spinal Institution survived him by at least sixteen years.<br>
