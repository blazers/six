<span class="headword">Wilberforce,  Ernest Roland</span>  (1840&#150;1907), <span class="occ">bishop of Chichester</span>, was born on 22 January 1840 at his father's rectory at Brighstone in the Isle of Wight, the third son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29385/', "Samuel Wilberforce (1805&#150;1873)")</script>, bishop successively of Oxford and Winchester, and his wife, Emily Sargent (1807&#150;1841). His childhood was spent at Lavington and Cuddesdon, where he acquired his lifelong love of country sports. From 1854 he attended Harrow School, but left in 1857 without attaining any great distinction. After two years with a private tutor he matriculated at Exeter College, Oxford, in May 1859. His Oxford career was noted more for his prowess as an oarsman than for academic work, and he graduated BA in 1864 with an honorary fourth. He proceeded MA in 1867, and was awarded his BD and DD in 1882.<br>
<br>Wilberforce's marriage on 23 June 1863 to Frances Mary, third daughter of Sir Charles Anderson, bt (1804&#150;1891), resulted in a more serious attitude to life and work. Upon graduation he went to Cuddesdon College, then under Edward King, to train for the ministry. In December 1864 he was ordained deacon by his father, and priest the following year. After brief curacies at Cuddesdon and Lea in Lincolnshire, in 1868 he was presented to the living of Middleton Stoney, near Bicester. However, he resigned in 1870 on account of his wife's poor health; she died from tuberculosis in San Remo in October 1870. In the same year he became domestic chaplain to his father, then bishop of Winchester, and in 1871 was made sub-almoner to Queen Victoria.<br>
<br>In 1873 Gladstone appointed Wilberforce to the living of Seaforth, a suburb of Liverpool and a traditionally evangelical parish. Here his moderate high-churchmanship led him to introduce a daily service and a weekly celebration of holy communion, but with such tact as to avoid any serious friction with the congregation. On 14 October 1874 he married Emily, only daughter of George Connor, afterwards dean of Windsor. They had three sons and three daughters. While at Seaforth Wilberforce became an active supporter of the temperance movement, he and his wife both taking the pledge in 1876. It was also while at Seaforth that he first became renowned for his strong voice and powerful sermons.<br>
<br>In 1878 Wilberforce was appointed a residentiary canon of Winchester, and to the wardenship of the Wilberforce Mission, formed and endowed as a memorial to his father. Most of his missionary work was done in Portsmouth and Aldershot, but in 1881 a legal ruling finally removed the mission to the diocese of Rochester. Following a brief missionary journey to Quebec, in 1882 he was offered by Gladstone the new see of Newcastle.<br>
<br>At the time of his consecration on 25 July 1882 in Durham Cathedral, Wilberforce was the youngest diocesan bishop in the Church of England. The act forming the new diocese has been passed in 1878, but it had taken four years to raise sufficient funds to support a bishop, a measure of the problems faced by Wilberforce in restoring the position of the church in an industrial area long neglected and now dominated by nonconformity. The 1881 census had shown a town of nearly 150,000 persons, but a contemporary local religious census revealed that fewer than 6500 attended Anglican services, a decline even on the 1851 figure. Wilberforce realized that the key to restoration was financial, and his Bishop of Newcastle's Fund raised nearly &pound;250,000 in its first five years. Within ten years eleven new churches and seven new vicarages had been built in the city, and the clergy increased by twenty-eight. At the same time Wilberforce was determined to make his presence felt throughout the diocese, travelling great distances in rural Northumberland to perform confirmations. In the first four years of his episcopate he confirmed twice as many candidates as had been confirmed in the four years before his arrival. And despite early opposition from local nonconformists, his tactful manner of proceeding gradually won many of them to his support. In many ways Wilberforce's work in Newcastle is comparable to that of W. F. Hook in Leeds in the previous generation.<br>
<br>By the mid-1890s Wilberforce's unrelenting work was starting to affect his health, and in 1895 he moved to become bishop of Chichester. However, here he soon found himself faced with a different set of problems. A number of the churches on the Sussex coast had become notorious for their ritualistic practices. Starting in 1898 the evangelicals launched a fresh campaign against ritualism, resulting in the Lambeth judgment against the use of incense and processional lights in the following year. Wilberforce persuaded five of the nine ritualist incumbents in his diocese to comply with the ruling, and attempted to avoid prosecution in the other cases. While personally unmoved by ritual practices, he was aware that legal proceedings and imprisonment following the 1874 <span class="roman">Public Worship Regulation Act</span> had largely failed to achieve anything but a legacy of bitterness and division, which he hoped to avoid. In 1905 he appeared as a witness before the royal commission on the state of ecclesiastical discipline, and in his evidence both criticized what he saw as the prejudiced and inaccurate claims of the evangelicals and defended the work of the ritualist clergy in his diocese.<br>
<br>In 1896 Wilberforce's work for the temperance movement was recognized when he became chairman of the Church of England Temperance Society. In 1904, despite his age, he joined the &#145;mission of help&#146; to southern Africa to aid in the process of reconciliation in the aftermath of the South African War. Following a short illness Wilberforce died on 9 September 1907 at Bembridge in the Isle of Wight. He was buried at West Hampnett, near Chichester, on 14 September.<br>
