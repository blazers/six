<span class="headword">Best,  Henry</span>  (<em>c.</em>1592&#150;1645), <span class="occ">landowner and farmer</span>, was probably born in Hutton Cranswick, Yorkshire, the second of the five sons and one daughter of James Best (<i>d</i>. 1617), yeoman of Hutton Cranswick (later gentleman of Elmswell, Yorkshire), and his wife, Dorothy (<i>d</i>. 1605), whose background and maiden name are not known; James Best married for a second and third time, and had two daughters and a son with his second wife. Nothing is known of Henry Best's early years, though his collection of books and his literary ability indicate a good education. When his father died in April 1617 he was living in Braintree, Essex, probably working in the shop of John Lawrence, grocer and apothecary, and one of the leading townsmen, whose daughter Mary married Best at about this time.<br>
<br>In the summer of 1617 Best travelled back to Yorkshire to manage the family estate at Elmswell, near Driffield, which had been bought by his father in 1598, and to supervise the upbringing of his young siblings and half-siblings. The estate, of nearly 1300 acres, had been left to his elder brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2291/', "Paul Best")</script>, a scholar at Cambridge, but it was bought by Henry in 1618. He spent the next twenty-seven years at Elmswell, overseeing his farms and estate; he built a new house in the 1630s, and only occasionally visited places out of the district.<br>
<br>In the early 1640s Best compiled an account of his farming methods and other country matters, such as &#145;the fashions att our Country weddings&#146;, for the benefit of his son, John (1620&#150;1669), who succeeded him as lord of the manor. Unfortunately, parts of the original manuscript, especially those dealing with tillage and the management of stock other than sheep, have been lost, but what remains of this farming book comprises the most detailed contemporary account of seventeenth-century farming practice. Throughout his control of the Elmswell estate Best also kept a memorandum book, in which he recorded in a haphazard fashion the things he wished to remember: the wages agreed with servants; debts owed and owing; the number of sheep in the shepherd's care. Although not an agricultural innovator, he was an astute farmer and businessman: he took great care in selecting seed and breeding stock; he knew the best markets in the region for a wide variety of products; and he endeavoured never to miss an opportunity for profit. He was always an active manager, out in the fields, exhorting his workers, ever watchful for the tricks of &#145;theevish and ill-disposed servants&#146; or the lackadaisical habits of maids &#145;of a sluggish and sleepy disposition&#146;. He was a man to whom fair dealing came naturally and he was a just, if firm, master.<br>
<br>Best had five sons and two daughters. His wife died in 1639 and he was predeceased by a son and a daughter. He was buried in Little Driffield, Yorkshire, on 22 June 1645.<br>
