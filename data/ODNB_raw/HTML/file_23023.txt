<span class="headword">Raine,  James</span>  (1791&#150;1858), <span class="occ">antiquary and topographer</span>, son of James Raine (<i>d</i>. 1840), village blacksmith, and his wife, Anne, daughter of Edmund Moore, was born at Ovington in the parish of Wycliffe, Yorkshire, on 23 January 1791. He was from 1804 educated at the Kirby Hill Free Grammar School, then from 1809 at Richmond School under James Tate. After teaching at Richmond he was from 1812 to 1827 second master of Durham School. Raine was ordained deacon on 26 September 1814, and priest on 20 September 1818. In 1816, already known for his antiquarian tastes, he was appointed librarian by the dean and chapter of Durham, and in 1822 they presented him to the rectory of Meldon, near Morpeth, Northumberland. Litigation with the landowners, the Greenwich Hospital commissioners, over the Meldon rectory tithes continued until 1846, when the case was decided in Raine's favour. In 1825 he was instituted principal surrogate in the diocesan consistory court, and in 1828 presented to the living of St Mary in the South Bailey, in the city of Durham. These various preferments he held until his death. In November 1825, at Bishop Barrington's request, the archbishop of Canterbury conferred on him the Lambeth degree of MA, and he was in due course incorporated <i>ad eundem gradum</i> in the new University of Durham, which in 1857 awarded him an honorary DCL in recognition of his historical and ecclesiastical services.<br>
<br>In 1812 Raine first met Robert Surtees, of Mainsforth Hall, starting a collaboration that continued until Surtees's death in 1834. In 1819 Walter Scott wrote to Raine urging him to the study of &#145;a treasure of ancient papers preserved at Durham which wanted only the zeal and firmness of a northern Leland to examine and arrange them&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters</span>). By then, as chapter librarian and with Surtees's example before him, he scarcely needed this further encouragement. His first efforts were in unselfishly assisting friends in the composition of their topographical works. The county historians John Hodgson, Sir Cuthbert Sharp, and Surtees himself, all paid tribute to Raine's unstinting assistance. Surtees stated that his <span class="italic">History of Durham</span> would never have been completed but for Raine's indefatigable industry  (<span class="italic">History</span>, 1, 1816, x). Raine subsequently became his friend's literary executor and arranged and edited the fourth volume of Surtees's <span class="italic">History of Durham</span> (1840). In 1827 he had performed a similar service for John Hodgson, for whom during the author's absence abroad he saw through the press volume 3, part 2, of the <span class="italic">History of Northumberland</span>; he later wrote a two-volume memoir of Hodgson (1857).<br>
<br>In 1828 Raine published his first substantial independent work, a monograph on St Cuthbert, including an account of the saint's remains discovered in Durham Cathedral in 1827. In 1830 appeared the first part of Raine's <span class="italic">History of North Durham</span> (that is, those detached parts of the county palatine, including Norham and Holy Island, which after 1844 were statutorily united to Northumberland). The second part of Raine's <span class="italic">History</span> eventually appeared in 1852. Although some later writers have expressed reservations about Raine's charter scholarship, the history was important in its day and still remains useful.<br>
<br>Soon after Surtees's death in February 1834, Raine organized local commemorative effort into the formation of a society bearing his name, to publish unedited historical manuscripts relating to the area between the Humber and the Forth. Raine became first secretary of the Surtees Society, constituted on 27 May 1834, and was an industrious editor of seventeen of the volumes published between 1835 and 1858 by this pioneering society, whose scheme of operation was much copied.<br>
<br>While convalescing from heart stress in 1858, Raine began an autobiographical memoir (published by the Surtees Society in 1991), a charming though uncompleted account of a Teesdale rural upbringing. He died at his home, Crook Hall, near Durham, on 6 December 1858, and was buried in Durham Cathedral yard. He married on 28 January 1828 Margaret, eldest daughter of the Revd Thomas Peacock (1756&#150;1851) and sister of George Peacock (1791&#150;1858), dean of Ely. They had three daughters and one son, James (1830&#150;1896), later chancellor of York Minster and the leading figure in the restoration of its library; he was also an editor for the Surtees Society and for the <span class="roman">Rolls Series</span>. The younger James's son Angelo Raine (1877&#150;1962), historian of York, continued to a third generation the family's clerical and antiquarian tradition.<br>
