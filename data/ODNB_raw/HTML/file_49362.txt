<span class="headword">Alan</span>, lord of Galloway  (<em>b. </em>before 1199, <em>d.</em> 1234), <span class="occ">magnate</span>, was the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/49361/', "Roland, lord of Galloway (d. 1200)")</script>, and Helen de Morville (<i>d</i>. 1217), sister and heir of William de Morville, lord of Lauderdale and Cunningham and royal constable. He had two brothers and two sisters, of whom <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/49364/', "Thomas (d. 1231)")</script> became earl of Atholl in right of his wife, Ada married Walter Bisset of Aboyne, and Dervorguilla married Nicholas de Stuteville of Liddel in Cumbria.<br>
<br>Alan contracted three marriages: to a daughter of Roger de Lacy, constable of Chester; to Margaret (<i>d</i>. before 1228), eldest daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/49365/', "David, earl of Huntingdon")</script>, in 1209; and, <i>c</i>.1229, to Rose, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15853/', "Hugh de Lacy, earl of Ulster")</script>. The first two marriages produced children, but only daughters attained adulthood. Helen, his daughter by his first marriage, married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22966/', "Roger de Quincy")</script>, while Christina (or Christiana) and Dervorguilla [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/49378/', "Balliol, Dervorguilla de")</script>], the children of Alan and Margaret, married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29480/', "William de Forz")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1208/', "John de Balliol")</script> respectively. Alan had one bastard son, Thomas.<br>
<br>Cross-border landholding and kinship with King John of England made Alan a man of consequence in both realms. His relationship with the king of Scots, based on loose overlordship rather than feudal subordination, allowed freedom of manoeuvre where his actions did not conflict with Scottish interests. Galloway's military resources and substantial fleet gave added influence; Alan's aid was courted unsuccessfully by John for his 1210 campaign against the Ulster Lacys, but he agreed to send one thousand men for the abortive Welsh campaign of 1212. A grant of estates in Antrim in 1212 was designed to draw him actively into the defence of Angevin Ulster against the native Irish. Despite such favours from John, when Alexander II entered the civil war in England in 1215, aligning himself with John's baronial opponents, Alan joined the Scottish king and was his chief lieutenant in the occupation of Cumberland and Westmorland from 1215 to 1217.<br>
<br>From 1225 Alan used the freedom afforded by the loose overlordship of the Scottish crown to interfere in the feud between King Ragnvald of Man and his half-brother, Olaf. His private interest, arising from efforts to secure Antrim with Ragnvald's support against the threat of a Lacy restoration, coincided at first with Anglo-Scottish policy towards the region and received the tacit support of his Scottish overlord. The prospect of a pro-Scottish client in Man led Alexander II to acquiesce to the marriage in 1226 of Alan's bastard son, Thomas, to Ragnvald's daughter, but the marriage provoked revolt against Ragnvald. Despite the support of Galwegian galleys and warriors, Ragnvald was overthrown and slain in 1229 by Olaf. Alan's ensuing attempts to conquer Man for Thomas destabilized the Hebrides and western highlands, thereby threatening Scottish territorial interests, and in 1230&#150;31 prompted active Norwegian support for Olaf. Joint action by Alan and Alexander averted catastrophe, but Scottish and Galwegian interests had diverged and the 1231 campaign marked the end of further Galwegian involvement in the Manx succession; Alan's dynastic ambitions had caused an undesirable war with a major foreign power.<br>
<br>Uncertainty over the succession to Galloway shadowed Alan's later years. His nearest legitimate male heir was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/50014/', "Patrick of Atholl")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/49364/', "Thomas, earl of Atholl")</script>], son of his younger brother, Thomas, who had died in 1231, but, although Celtic practice did not debar his bastard son, Thomas, Alan's closest heirs by feudal law were his three daughters, all married to important Anglo-Scottish noblemen. To King Alexander, the crisis precipitated by Alan's Manx ventures made partition, and the attendant opportunity to replace the loose overlordship enjoyed by Alan with a more tightly defined relationship, an attractive proposition, for succession by Thomas threatened a revival of Galwegian interests in Man and so of risks to Scottish security. Alan died about 2 February 1234 and was buried in Dundrennan Abbey, where his mutilated tomb effigy survives. Partition of the lordship followed and, despite a rebellion in 1235 in favour of Thomas, was successfully enforced.<br>
