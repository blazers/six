<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Coles,  Cowper Phipps</span>  (1819&#150;1870), <span class="occ">naval officer and inventor of a gun turret</span>, was born on 9 July 1819, the third son of the Revd John Coles (1787&#150;1865) of Ditcham Park, Hampshire, rector of Silchester, and his first wife, Marianne Goodhead, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Rogers (<i>d</i>. 1832). He passed his examination for a naval commission in 1838, and in January 1846 was promoted lieutenant. In October 1853 he was chosen by Sir Edmund Lyons, his uncle by marriage, as his flag-lieutenant on the <i>Agamemnon</i> in the Mediterranean, and served in the fleet's attack on the Sevastopol forts on 17 October 1854. On 13 November he was made commander, and during 1855 commanded the paddle steamer <i>Stromboli</i> in the Black Sea and Sea of Azov. On 27 February 1856 he was promoted captain. He married, on 11 March 1856, Emily (1829/30&#150;1876), daughter of Henry Shepherd Pearson, with whom he had ten children. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/72803/', "Sherard Osborn Cowper-Coles")</script>, the electrometallurgist and inventor, was their fourth son.<br>
<br>While in the Sea of Azov, Coles designed and constructed a shallow-draft gun-raft, which was capable of carrying a heavy gun protected by an iron shield 4 inches thick. He was ordered home to superintend the construction of similar rafts for the projected attack on Kronstadt, a work that was prevented by the end of the war in May 1856. But from then he devoted himself to the study of defensive armour for ships and forts. The early idea of a raft and shield gradually transformed itself into a conical shield on a revolving turntable, suggested by Isambard Kingdom Brunel, for shore fortification, and finally into the simple cylindrical section for shipboard mounting. The system was attractive because it coincided with a sudden increase in the size and weight of naval artillery, making a broadside of four heavy guns appear to be an adequate replacement for fifty or sixty smaller weapons. Similar ideas were developed in the USA by John Ericsson, and the claims of the two men to the original conception have often been discussed. Probably the crude idea occurred independently to each, but their further progress reacted on each other.<br>
<br>As finally developed, Coles's turret was far more sophisticated than Ericsson's, and the two men's ideas on the ideal ship to mount the turret were radically different. Both men were forced by the turret's weight to build low freeboard vessels: Ericsson created the <i>Monitor</i>, while Coles wanted to combine the turret with a full ship rig to create a first-class battleship. By securing the support of Prince Albert, after whom the first purpose-built British turret ship was named, and of Lord Palmerston, <span class="italic">The Times</span>, and large sections of the daily and service press, Coles secured the conversion of the steam battleship <span class="italic">Royal Sovereign</span> into a mastless turret ship. After offering his patent rights to the Admiralty for &pound;20,000, Coles was left to settle for &pound;5000 in recognition of his efforts, and &pound;100 for every turret installed during the term of his patent. This was in addition to being kept on full pay for most of the decade as an adviser.<br>
<br>Despite successful trials in 1864, Coles was not satisfied with this limited application, and through his brother-in-law Captain G. T. P. Hornby used the Conservative Party to press for a fully rigged first-class ship to be built. The Admiralty ordered the chief constructor, Sir Edward Reed, to design this ship, ordered in 1866 as HMS <i>Monarch</i>, but Coles remained dissatisfied. Eventually the duke of Somerset allowed him to call on private industry to design his own ship. Coles selected Laird Brothers of Birkenhead, who had already built several turret ships for foreign governments, and their design was authorized on 23 July 1866, notwithstanding the submission of the controller of the navy, that it was doubtful whether the proposed freeboard, 8 feet, would be satisfactory for a seagoing cruising ship. The ship was named the <i>Captain</i>. Coles intended that she should function as a seagoing cruising ship, and he was supported by public opinion. The Admiralty, which included many of his supporters, of whom the first lord and first sea lord were the most notable, laid the responsibility on Coles and the Lairds, and sanctioned her being commissioned, although it was found that the freeboard was nearly 2 feet less than had been designed. Apparently they did not realize that this was a source of great danger; and the responsibility they had mentioned referred to the cost of any necessary material alterations.<br>
<br>The <i>Captain</i> was commissioned early in 1870; after an experimental cruise she joined the Channel Fleet, accompanied it to Gibraltar, and on the way home, in a fresh gale off Cape Finisterre on the night of 7 September 1870, capsized and sank. Almost all aboard her were drowned, including Coles, who was travelling as the guest of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4011/', "Captain H. T. Burgoyne")</script>.<br>
<br>Coles was a significant figure in the mid-nineteenth century naval technical revolution. His turret transformed the design of modern warships in the space of a decade, reflecting great credit on his abilities as a publicist and lobbyist. His single-minded determination, however, left him unable to see the other side of the debate, and this led to a decade of controversy with Reed and Admiral Sir Spencer Robinson. The duke of Somerset blamed his &#145;obstinate conceit&#146;  (Mallock and Ramsden, 388) and the support of <span class="italic">The Times</span> for the <i>Captain</i> disaster. Unfortunately, Coles combined a heavy system of protected gun mounting with outdated views on the necessity of a full sailing rig for first-class battleships. Lacking the scientific skill to assess the results of his efforts, he designed the <i>Captain</i> with a heavier rig than the Admiralty-designed <i>Monarch</i>, which he was anxious to outperform, and so she capsized. The real line of development for the turret ship lay not in the masted type, but through the coastal designs to the mastless seagoing battleship <i>Devastation</i>, designed by Coles's arch rival Edward Reed and launched in 1871.<br>
