<span class="headword">McElwain,  Timothy John</span>  (1937&#150;1990), <span class="occ">cancer physician</span>, was born on 22 April 1937 in Wellington, New Zealand, the only child of Allan R. McElwain, freelance foreign correspondent, and his wife, Marjorie (Miranda) Simpson, a commercial artist specializing in fashion. Because of the peripatetic nature of his father's employment, McElwain was educated in both Australia and England. He attended St Peter's College, Adelaide, from 1947 to 1949, and then Sloane School in London (1949&#150;51). Back in Australia, he went to Haileybury College, Melbourne, from 1951 to 1957. He returned to London in 1957 to go to the London Polytechnic to study physics, chemistry, zoology, and botany for a first MB exemption. He duly achieved this, with passes in all subjects. He also became president of the students' union, chairman of the debating society, and president of the faculty club. He was keen on water sports and rowing. He was admitted to St Bartholomew's Hospital medical college in October 1960, being about five years older than the average student. His maturity is reflected in the fact that he had no difficulty with examinations, passing MB, BS finals with honours in 1965, when he obtained a distinction in applied pharmacology and therapeutics. He was awarded the Hayward prize in recognition of his contribution to student activities.<br>
<br>McElwain did his house physician appointments at Bart's, where he worked for Gordon Hamilton Fairley, a pioneer of the drug treatment of cancer. His interest and ability in therapeutics ensured Hamilton Fairley's support, and he obtained one of the first Leukaemia Research Fund fellowships (1968&#150;70), to work on childhood leukaemia at the Hospital for Sick Children, Great Ormond Street. He passed his MRCP in 1968, and, after registrar appointments at Bart's (1967&#150;8), and posts as lecturer (1970&#150;71) and senior lecturer (1972&#150;3) at the Royal Marsden Hospital, London, he was appointed in 1973 consultant physician at the Royal Marsden. He became head of the section of medicine in 1980, and was subsequently appointed Cancer Research Campaign professor of medical oncology in the University of London in 1983. He had been elected at an early age to the fellowship of the Royal College of Physicians, London, in 1977.<br>
<br>McElwain brought to the Royal Marsden Hospital an appreciation of the importance of the discipline of internal medicine, not only in the proper use of drugs to combat cancer, but also in the expert general medical care necessary to the exploration of the drugs' potential. He pushed intensive therapy, using high doses of anti-cancer drugs, to the limit, and his resultant success in the care of myeloma, a highly malignant form of cancer, serves as a confirmation of the value of his work. This could not have been achieved without prolonged, intensive effort, and courage in facing the inevitable institutional resistance and resentments.<br>
<br>As professor of medical oncology McElwain was in great demand from organizations abroad and at home. He was always generous with his time, holding such posts as consultant in medical oncology at the Tata Memorial Cancer Centre in Bombay, India, external assessor to the Chinese University of Hong Kong, and referee for research grant applications to the Medical Research Council of New Zealand. In Great Britain he was chairman or member of several important committees in such institutions as the Royal College of Physicians, London, the Medical Research Council, and the Wolfson Foundation. However, the position that gave him most pleasure was his presidency of the Association of Cancer Physicians. He was a member of the editorial boards of many specialist journals. He was a popular member of societies, and of national and international committees, where his knowledge, combined with good common sense and a pithy expression of his views, could often rescue a meeting that was faltering.<br>
<br>McElwain was a large man, with a bald head, who loved food, wine, and music, and had a remarkable knowledge of contemporary literature. He had a library of over 2000 records of classical music. With his wit and his expansive personality, he was a charming and thoughtful host, and an invitation to his home was not to be missed. In 1970 he married Sheila Glennis, daughter of Richard Howarth, accountant, after a whirlwind courtship while he was a junior doctor at the Hospital for Sick Children, Great Ormond Street. She brought love and security to his life and, while carving out a distinguished medical career for herself, was able to give him an elegant and happy home. There were no children. McElwain died at his home, 94 Clapham Common North Side, London, on 26 November 1990.<br>
