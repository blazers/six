<span class="headword">Owen,  William Fitzwilliam</span>  (1774&#150;1857), <span class="occ">naval officer and hydrographer</span>, was the second illegitimate son of Captain William Owen RN, of the Glansevern Owens of Montgomeryshire and of Passamaquoddy Bay, New Brunswick. His mother, and that of his brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20994/', "Sir Edward Campbell Rich Owen (1771&#150;1849)")</script>, was either Sarah Haslam or Jane Johnson, both of whom were in Captain Owen's household. Owen was born near Warrington, Lancashire, on 17 September 1774. Abandoned in Madras on his father's death in 1778, he was taken aboard the frigate <i>Cormorant</i> as the captain's servant by Captain Sir Thomas Rich. He went with his benefactor to the <i>Enterprize</i>, in which he was present at the moonlight battle off Cape St Vincent in 1780, before being sent to schools in north Wales and near Liverpool.<br>
<br>Owen went back to sea in 1788 as a midshipman, joining the <i>Culloden</i> (74 guns) under Sir Thomas Rich again. He was present in her at the battle of the Glorious First of June in 1794. After service in the <i>Ruby</i> (64 guns) in the expedition to capture the Cape of Good Hope, Owen was appointed to the <i>London</i> (98 guns), flagship of Vice-Admiral Sir John Colpoys. In May 1797, when the crew of the <i>London</i> joined the mutiny at Spithead, Owen was among the officers put ashore.<br>
<br>Later that year Owen was promoted lieutenant in command of the gun-vessel <i>Flamer</i>, in which after the battle of Camperdown he salvaged the Dutch prize <i>Overijssel</i>. His next command was the fireship <i>Nancy</i>, where he came under the orders of Nelson for a planned attempt to fire the invasion fleet mustering in Boulogne. In 1803 Owen was given command of the brig <i>Seaflower</i>, employed first off Brest and later in eastern seas. It was here that he first began the hydrographic work for which he is best-known, discovering and charting deep-water channels through the Maldives and in the islands off Sumatra. In September 1808 the <i>Seaflower</i> was taken by the French frigate <i>La Manche</i>, and Owen was imprisoned on Mauritius until January 1810. Meanwhile he had been promoted commander and appointed to the sloop <i>Barracouta</i>. Before taking up his command he was involved in the planning for the capture of Mauritius. After its fall he returned to the East Indies, where he helped Sir Stamford Raffles impose British rule over Java and Sumatra. He was promoted captain in May 1811 and appointed to the frigate <i>Cornelia</i>, where, as senior officer of the Batavia squadron, he suppressed piracy in the Indies.<br>
<br>In 1815 Owen was ordered to Kingston, Ontario, to survey the Great Lakes of Canada. In the next two years Owen and his team of four assistants charted most of the Canadian shores of the Great Lakes and the upper St Lawrence River, as well as delineating the border between the United States and Canada from Lake Champlain to the St Lawrence. In 1818 he married Martha Evans; they had two daughters. After her death in 1852 he married later the same year Amy Nicholson, a widow, of Saint John, New Brunswick.<br>
<br>After a period on half pay Owen was appointed in 1821 to the sloop <i>Leven</i>, in which, with the brig <i>Barracouta</i> also under his command, he was instructed to survey the east coast of Africa from the boundary of Cape Colony to Cape Gardafui. The squadron arrived at Simonstown in July 1822, and returned there from their last surveying season in September 1825, having surveyed some 20,000 miles of coast, depicted in almost 300 charts. Fever ravaged the ships' companies, and it was not until they began treating it with the native remedy of chinchona bark infusion, instead of bleeding, that mortality was brought within bounds, though it was never eliminated.<br>
<br>Already disgusted by the slave trade from his experiences in the East Indies, Owen was determined to stamp it out. Finding the Mazrui rulers of Mombasa under siege by their suzerain, Sayyid Said, sultan of Oman, Owen in February 1824 on his own initiative raised the siege and took the town under British protection in return for a promise by the Mazrui to abolish slavery. Though disowned by the home government, the protectorate lasted over two years.<br>
<br>After leaving Simonstown in October 1825, the two ships carried out extensive surveys on the west coast of Africa on their way home, before reaching Deptford in August 1826. Owen published <span class="italic">A Narrative of a Voyage to Explore the Shores of Africa, Arabia and Madagascar</span> in 1833, but the similar work by Thomas Boteler, a lieutenant on the survey, is generally considered the better record.<br>
<br>At the end of 1826 Owen was appointed to the frigate <i>Eden</i> and as superintendent of Fernando Po, where it was intended that he should establish a colony for freed slaves. Despite a promising start, hopes that the island was free from fever proved false, and Owen left at the end of 1829. He remained in the <i>Eden</i> until August 1831, when he came ashore for the last time.<br>
<br>In 1835 Owen and his family moved to the estate on Campobello Island in Passamaquoddy Bay, New Brunswick, colonized by his father, where, apart from short trips away, he remained for the rest of his life. In 1842 the surveying ship <i>Columbia</i> was sent out to chart the coast of the Bay of Fundy, and Owen was placed in charge of her operations for five years. He was promoted rear-admiral in 1847, and vice-admiral in 1854. He died in St John on 3 November 1857, and was buried at St Anne's churchyard, Welshpool, Campobello Island.<br>
