<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Lambarde,  William</span>  (1536&#150;1601), <span class="occ">antiquary and lawyer</span>, was born on 18 October 1536 in the parish of St Nicholas Acons, London, the elder son of John Lambarde or Lambert (1500&#150;1554) and his first wife, Juliana (<i>d</i>. 1540), daughter of William Horne (<i>d</i>. 1544), grocer of London. His father, a younger son of William Lambert of Ledbury, Herefordshire, and Alice Baker, was a warden and master of the Drapers' Company, merchant adventurer, alderman of London from 1547, and sheriff of the city in 1551&#150;2. He purchased numerous properties in London and Southwark, the manor of Hedington, Wiltshire, and the manor of Westcombe in East Greenwich, Kent, and he secured a coat of arms on 15 July 1551. At his death on 4 August 1554 and the subsequent death of his second wife, Alice, the following 12 August, his two sons and heirs, William and Giles (1538&#150;1581) were under age. William, the ward of Edmund Hensley, esquire, was found to be of legal age on 23 November 1557. Retaining Westcombe and some London property, he sold most of the remainder of his inheritance between 1559 and 1574 for a total of &pound;1868. Giles, apprenticed in 1554 to his father's friend and fellow draper, John Calthorp, inherited property valued at &pound;52 3<i>s</i>. 4<i>d</i>. per annum and became a controversial, litigious freeman of the Drapers' Company.<br>
<br>Lambarde's early education is obscure. He may have been the William Lambert enrolled in 1549 at Jesus College, Cambridge, but he later stated in his <span class="italic">Alphabetical Description of the Chief Places in England and Wales</span> (1730) that he owed more to Oxford University than to Cambridge, and he was an early donor to the library of Christ Church. On 15 August 1556 he entered Lincoln's Inn, and was named a master of the inn's revels in 1558 and a Christmas steward in 1559. A powerful case has been made that he was the William Lambert who sat for Aldborough, Yorkshire, in the two sessions of the parliament which began in 1563. This individual played a vital role in the debate on the royal succession, and in 1584 wrote an innovative treatise, &#145;Notes on the procedures and privileges of the House of Commons&#146;, first published anonymously in 1641. On 5 November 1566 Queen Elizabeth forestalled a petition from parliament on her marriage and the settlement of the succession by informing a delegation from the Lords and Commons that discussion of these topics should cease. On 8 November Lambarde reopened the issue in the Commons with a learned oration advocating a return to the proceedings. This action led directly to the queen's express commandment forbidding debate, Paul Wentworth's questioning of this possible breach of the liberty of free speech in the Commons, and Elizabeth's eventual, reluctant withdrawal of her prohibition. Lambarde's treatise of 1584 later identified these events as constituting an important precedent for the house, but his involvement was the direct result of his staunch protestantism and concern at the prospect of a Catholic succession, rather than abstract constitutional principle.<br>
<br>Following his call to the bar on 15 June 1567, for two decades Lambarde devoted himself to county administration, his estates, and his scholarship. His first historical researches, undertaken at Lincoln's Inn with the encouragement of Lawrence Nowell and originating within the antiquarian circle of Archbishop Matthew Parker, who promoted Anglo-Saxon research as a firm foundation for the Church of England, led to the publication of <span class="italic">Archaionomia</span> (1568), dedicated to Sir William Cordell. Only the second book to print Old English, this was a pioneering collection and paraphrase in Latin of Anglo-Saxon laws and treaties, together with laws of Edward the Confessor and William I. It was heavily dependent on Nowell's &#145;improved&#146; translation of the originals and at this date some significant manuscripts like the <span class="roman">Textus Roffensis</span> were known to neither Nowell nor Lambarde; the latter recognized this later and amended accordingly his own copies of the book, which survive in the Bodleian and Huntington libraries. However, the work was immediately highly influential, and was crucial to subsequent scholarship. Lambarde's achievement was commended by Parker and acknowledged by John Foxe, and had particular importance in an age when the definition and direction of historical studies were intimately connected to the religious and political conditions and when antiquarianism was an essential part of the search for precedent and authority in all aspects of life and thought.<br>
<br>Lambarde's involvement in county administration began with his appointment in 1568 as a commissioner of sewers for Kent, where he had been acquiring small additional plots of lands for the previous five years. On 11 September 1570 he married Jane (1553&#150;1573), eldest daughter of George Multon (1504&#150;1588), esquire and justice of the peace of St Clere, Ightham, Kent, and Agnes Polhill (1515?&#150;1591). Jane's dowry included the lease of St Clere manor; although she died childless on 21 September 1573, Lambarde resided there until 1583 and held the manor until 1588. It was on his marriage and move to the county, as he later explained to Sir Henry Sidney, that, having already collected some notes for a topographical dictionary, he conceived the novel idea of a systematic survey of Kent. What was in time intended as the first instalment of a historical topography of England was completed in draft in 1570, read in manuscript by Parker and Lord Burghley, and published as <span class="italic">Perambulation of Kent: Containing the Description, Hystorie and Customs of that Shyre</span> (1576). The earliest county history, based on wide and critical reading (partly informed by Lambarde's protestant suspicion of monks and their works), it draws also on <span class="roman">Domesday Book</span> and on royal charters, and includes in its climatic, economic, social, religious, and historical survey a short investigation of the see of Canterbury; a discussion of the local inheritance custom of gavelkind is appended. While Lambarde was uninterested in pre-Anglo-Saxon history (unlike William Camden) and exhibited no appreciation of landscape, his book &#145;is packed with learned information&#146; and &#145;eminently readable&#146;  (McKisack, 137). The project to publish on other counties was eventually abandoned in 1585, when Lambarde learned of Camden's similar undertaking, but his interim researches were finally published as <span class="italic">Dictionarium Angliae topographicum et historicum</span> (1730) and his marginal notations survive in the books he consulted now in the British Library, including John Price's <span class="italic">Historiae Brytannicae defensio</span> (1573) and Alexander Neville's <span class="italic">De furoribus Norfolciensium Ketto duce</span> (1575).<br>
<br>Lambarde was put on the county commission of the peace on 6 August 1579 (sworn on 3 June 1580) and became of the quorum in 1584. For the first eight years of his service in the western division of Kent he kept a memorandum book, his &#145;Ephemeris&#146;, containing notes on some aspects of his work, including the issuing of recognizances for keeping the peace, the licensing of ale houses, and provision for bastards. Twenty-nine of his erudite, contemplative charges to the quarter session juries and local commissions between 1582 and 1601 survive in the Folger Shakespeare Library; they probably represent only a quarter of those he actually delivered. He praised English justice, but was sharply critical of the shortcomings of the juries, which had led government to circumvent them through such agencies as Star Chamber, and thus curtail liberty. Extolling the blessings of peace and deploring the disorders attendant on war, he showed a dislike of foreigners and inveighed, among other things, against ale houses, vagabonds, and engrossers, but he made little reference to national problems and none to felony or murder. His own activities in local government, alongside his friends and associates William Brooke, Lord Cobham, Sir Thomas Fane, Thomas Leveson, and Thomas Wotton, included the recusancy commission (not mentioned in &#145;Ephemeris&#146;), the organization of musters, beacons, and markets, prerogative taxation, the stewardship of the manor of Gravesend, and the wardenship of Rochester Bridge corporation. His desire to study the historical development of every office he held led to the highly praised <span class="italic">Eirenarcha, or, The Office of the Justices of Peace</span> (1582). Reprinted twelve times before 1620, this treatise long remained the standard authority.<br>
<br>On 28 October 1583 Lambarde married his second wife, Sylvestra or Silvester (1554&#150;1587), widow of William Dallison (<i>d</i>. 1581) of Gray's Inn, daughter-in-law of Sir William Dallison, justice of queen's bench, and daughter and heir of Robert Deane or Dene (<i>d</i>. 1577) of Halling, Kent, and Margaret White (<i>d</i>. 1594). After Sylvestra's death on 1 September 1587 from complications following the birth of their twin sons, Lambarde secured the wardship of her son Maximilian Dallison (<i>d</i>. 1631) and a lease of their Halling residence. He made a third marriage locally, on 13 April 1592, to Margaret (<i>b</i>. 1544), widow successively of John Meryam and Richard Reder (<i>d</i>. 1582), yeoman, both of Boughton Monchelsea, and daughter of John Payne of Frittenden, yeoman. In 1598 the Lambardes moved to Westcombe.<br>
<br>In his &#145;Ephemeris&#146; Lambarde emphasized the rule of law as the foundation of society, &#145;the outward guides and masters of our lives and manners&#146;  (Lambarde, <span class="italic">Ephemeris</span>, 76). By 1591 he had completed his greatest achievement in legal history, &#145;Archeion, or, A discourse upon the high courts of justice in England&#146;, which although it circulated extensively in manuscript, was published by his grandson only in 1635. Here he propounded a vision of political society grounded in historically validated laws and customs. He sought to trace the two essential components of this system of government, the common law and the prerogative, to an equally distant Anglo-Saxon past. As for parliament, Lambarde wrote, &#145;I see not how I can derive it from any other time, than from that, in which the <i>German</i> or <i>English</i> did set their first foot on this <i>Land</i>, to invade it&#146;  (W. Lambarde, <span class="italic">Archeion</span>, ed. C. H. McIlwain and P. L. Ward, 1957, 126&#150;7). For him, the establishment of a firm basis for contemporary society could only mean an appeal to the past, and his conclusions were considered valid by those who began, as he did, with a belief in the continuity of institutions which could change their name and structure but not their essential functions. The precise extent of the prerogative and of the common law was a contentious issue, and Lambarde's writings and actions revealed a consistently high opinion of the latter, although not at the expense of the essential function of the former.<br>
<br>Lambarde was a consistent and vocal proponent of ethical propriety and reform in the practice of the law. His direct employment by the crown was long delayed, his career perhaps impeded by his controversial action in 1566, and employment at Westminster came only with the rise to prominence of his close friends, especially Sir Thomas Egerton. In 1589 Lambarde was made deputy to Lord Burghley as master of the alienations office of chancery, in June 1592 a master in chancery extraordinary, and in 1597 a master in ordinary and deputy keeper of the rolls (to Egerton). It was in chancery that his direct influence was most effective, especially when he acted in association with Egerton. Here he attempted to restrict the growing equity jurisdiction to justifiable causes. It was he who prepared the earliest collection of chancery precedents, the so-called Cary's reports, printed in 1650, which quickly became authoritative and had a pronounced effect on moulding court procedure. As in his treatises on the House of Commons and the office of alienations, it was the identification and codification of precedents that comprised his contribution to the establishment of theory out of past and contemporary practice.<br>
<br>On 14 June 1597 Lambarde, who had been active in the Society of Antiquaries, and who on this occasion was described as &#145;a man of great reading, learning and experience&#146;  (<span class="italic">Black Books</span>, 2.51), became a bencher of Lincoln's Inn, having been an associate bencher since 1579. In January 1601 he became keeper of the records in the Tower of London and quickly produced a historical description of the royal manuscripts, &#145;Pandecta rotulorum&#146;. When he presented this to the queen, in an audience at Greenwich Palace he recounted in notes preserved among his family papers, he found Elizabeth an intelligent and appreciative recipient, who questioned him in detail over the content and its meaning. Having dispensed her equally elderly guest from the necessity of kneeling before her, she reportedly avowed that &#145;she had not received since her first coming to the crown any one thing that brought so great delectation unto her&#146; and finally left him with a &#145;Farewell, good and honest Lambarde&#146;  (McKisack, 82).<br>
<br>While in royal service Lambarde made his most sustained land purchases. Between 1593 and 1597 he paid &pound;1760 for the Kentish properties that comprised his most significant acquisitions. Together with Westcombe they formed the basis for his family's landed estate. The earlier sales of portions of his inheritance had all been directed towards the costs of &pound;2739 for the foundation of his model almshouse, the College of Queen Elizabeth, at East Greenwich in 1576. Later, as an executor for the estate of William Brooke, Lord Cobham (<i>d</i>. 1597), he adopted the college's rules for use in Cobham's newly established almshouse, of which he and Thomas Leveson were the first presidents.<br>
<br>Having already obtained an unparalleled reputation for learning, piety, civic virtue, and trustworthiness, Lambarde died at Westcombe at 3 a.m. on 19 August 1601, and was buried in the parish church of St Alphege, East Greenwich; his funeral monument was moved in 1710 to the Lambarde chapel in St Nicholas's Church, Sevenoaks. He had complained of diminished eyesight since 1587, and in August 1586 had told Egerton that he had been gravely sick three times in the previous three years, &#145;in these Dogdays and (as it were) hearde 3 peales rong for me&#146;  (Hunt. L., MS EL 39). By the terms of his will, dated 16 May 1597, the estates in Kent descended to his eldest son, Multon (1584&#150;1634), of Lincoln's Inn; Multon was knighted in 1608 and married Jane (1594&#150;1674), daughter of Sir Thomas Lowe, alderman and sometime lord mayor of London. Lambarde's younger sons, Fane and Gore, the twins born in 1587, were given equal life interests in the London property on attaining the age of twenty-two; both appear to have died young and childless. Their only sister, Margaret (1586&#150;1611), received a marriage portion of &pound;800. On 5 May 1609 she married Thomas Godfrey (1585&#150;1664) of Kent, then gentleman servant to Henry Howard, earl of Northampton, and later sewer of the chamber to James I and father of Edmund Berry Godfrey. Lambarde's library remained at Sevenoaks until 1924, when it was dispersed by sale and bequest.<br>
