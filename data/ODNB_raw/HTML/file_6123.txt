<span class="headword">Conway, Sir  John</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1603), <span class="occ">writer and soldier</span>, was the son and heir of Sir John Conway of Arrow, Warwickshire, landowner, and Katherine, daughter of Sir Ralph Verney and his wife, Elizabeth. Little is known of his youth or education but he was well read. He was knighted in 1559, on the accession of Elizabeth I. On 26 July 1573 the queen granted him a two-year licence to &#145;pass beyond the seas, about the Queens affairs: and protection during that time&#146;  (<span class="italic">CPR</span>, <i>1572&#150;5</i>, 56). He seems to have been hot-headed. In 1578 he was attacked in London by Ludovic Grevil, and would probably have been killed if his servant had not warded off the sword blows. The incident caused outrage at the time as Robert Rich, second Baron Rich, had also been attacked on the same day. In December 1583 he seems to have been imprisoned in connection with the Somerville&#150;Arden case, and during his incarceration he probably wrote his &#145;Meditations and Praiers&#146;. He also wrote commendatory verses prefixed to Geoffrey Fenton's <span class="italic">Certaine Tragicall Discourses</span> (1567) and <span class="italic">Poesie of Floured Praiers</span> (1611). Conway was connected with Robert Dudley, earl of Leicester, because of the proximity of their landholdings in Warwickshire, a centre of Dudley power and influence. He was among Leicester's protestant clients and neighbours recruited for the expedition to the Netherlands in 1585. In 1586 he was the English commander in Middelburg, on Walcheren Island, close to the port and cautionary town of Flushing. He was master of Leicester's artillery from about June. He was well connected at court through membership of the Dudley clientele but became disillusioned with Leicester's lacklustre military leadership, and wrote on 28 January 1587 to Sir William Cecil, Lord Burghley, lord treasurer, and Sir Francis Walsingham, principal secretary, with an account of the betrayal of Zutphen and Deventer only two days earlier. His letters reveal his strong protestant leanings, and he laid much of the blame for the losses on Leicester. He noted sourly in his letter to Burghley that although Sir William Stanley had allegedly opened the gates of Deventer &#145;for the discharge of his conscience&#146;, the payment was &#145;said to be 13,000 pounds&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP for.</span>, 12.340&#150;41). Despite his views, Leicester had made Conway governor of the important and isolated garrison of Ostend on 29 December 1586, where he was to serve until 1590. During this period he was involved in a number of major incidents. In 1587 Alessandro Farnese, duke of Parma, threatened Ostend as part of his preparations to prepare the way for the arrival of the Spanish Armada. Reinforcements under Sir Roger Williams, <i>en route</i> for Ostend, were diverted into Sluys. Their heroic but unsuccessful defence of the town removed the threat to Ostend during 1587. In the following year the impending arrival of the Armada disrupted supplies of food to Ostend, and in late August the garrison broke out into a &#145;wonderful dangerous mutiny&#146;. They complained of victuals that were &#145;neither wholesome, savoury, nor man's meat&#146;. The victualler was thrown into the harbour by the irate troops, and Conway and his officers were imprisoned in the common gaol, after ten of the mutineers had discharged their muskets at them  (<span class="italic">CSP for.</span>, 22.xxxvi&#150;xxxix). The queen took the complaints of the troops seriously, and Peregrine Bertie, Lord Willoughby de Eresby, Leicester's replacement, restored calm in late September by promising to rectify the grievances, and by removing the ringleaders to assist in the defence of Bergen op Zoom.<br>
<br>In the wake of the Armada, a counter-attack was planned against Spain by raiding Portugal, and Conway was caught up in the controversy between Willoughby and Sir John Norris over the provision of troops from the English garrisons in the Netherlands for the expedition. Conway was reluctant to reduce the size of his garrison, or lose his veterans, due to the dilapidated state of the town defences and the continuing threat from the Spaniards. He was grateful for the insistence of the states general, who commissioned him as an officer and contributed to his salary, that he should maintain the integrity of his garrison. Conway co-operated with them. Willoughby regarded the affair as interference from the privy council.<br>
<br>Conway was in a difficult position because he had upset his officers during the mutiny, Norris during the recruitment for the Portugal expedition, and Willoughby during the inspection of the town defences. His captains demanded his recall. He was licensed to leave in July 1590. However, in August&#151;taking advantage of the reduction of the Spanish forces, who had been drawn off to France&#151;he launched a series of aggressive raids in the surrounding area. His most successful nearly ended in disaster when his force of 600 was cut off by the tide at east Dunkirk on 28 August 1590. He was attacked by the Spanish garrisons from Nieuwpoort and Dunkirk in force, and lost most of the booty that had been collected, although he did bring his force and 750 cattle safely back to Ostend. He claimed to have inflicted great damage on the enemy. Under pressure from Willoughby he announced that he was willing to resign. He was replaced by Sir Edward Norris, Norris's brother, and does not appear to have served in the Netherlands again.<br>
<br>Conway died on 4 October 1603, and was buried in Arrow church, where a monument was erected in his memory by his wife, Ellen, daughter of Sir Fulke Greville (<i>d</i>. 1560) of Beauchamp's Court, Warwickshire, and his wife, Elizabeth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Willoughby. They had four sons, including Fulke, John, and Thomas, and four daughters, Elizabeth, Katherine, Mary, and Frances. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6120/', "Edward Conway (d. 1631)")</script>, the eldest son, was created Viscount Conway and Viscount Killultagh in 1627.<br>
