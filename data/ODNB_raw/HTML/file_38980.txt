<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Burberry,  Thomas</span>  (1835&#150;1926), <span class="occ">men's outfitter</span>, was born on 27 August 1835 at Brockham Green, near Dorking, Surrey, the son of Thomas Burberry, farmer and nonconformist. Following an elementary education at Brockham Green village school, Burberry was apprenticed to a local draper's shop before opening his own outfitting business in 1856 in Westminster Street, Basingstoke. The shop expanded rapidly, benefiting from Burberry's knowledge of the retail trade and the requirements of the local farming community. He was particularly concerned with adapting the practical and watertight qualities of traditional linen farmers' smocks to a broader range of clothing products. With that aim in mind Burberry entered into experimental trials with British cotton manufacturers in order to produce a cheaper alternative weatherproof textile that would hold a strong appeal for the growing ranks of upper middle-class sportsmen and those following country pursuits, who made up the bulk of bespoke menswear consumers in the latter half of the nineteenth century.<br>
<br>In 1858 Burberry married Catherine Hannah, daughter of John Newman, currier, at the Salem Chapel, Strand, London. His second wife, named Mary, outlived him. The Basingstoke shop continued to prosper, employing eighty staff by 1871. These were later joined by Burberry's two sons, Thomas and Arthur, and in 1885 by R. B. Rolls who took on the position of marketing and retail manager. Experimentation with the design of wind- and rainproof textiles and garments continued into the 1880s, coinciding with a popular interest in rational and artistic dress reform. In 1884 Burberry's new &#145;gabardine&#146;, a hard-wearing cloth waterproofed in the yarn before weaving and then closely woven and proofed again without the use of rubber, attracted approval at the International Health Exhibition in South Kensington, and in 1888 Burberry took out a patent for a new lighter material adapted for the garments of athletes.<br>
<br>From 1889 Burberry commissioned his youngest son, Arthur, to consolidate metropolitan patronage through giving fittings and taking orders from wealthy visitors at the Jermyn Street Hotel, Piccadilly. This led to the opening of a flagship London store at 30 Haymarket under the management of R. B. Rolls in 1891, a mill and workrooms in the East End in 1892, and a wholesale warehouse in Golden Square in 1900. All of these concerns were run under paternal principles, inspired by Burberry's strong Baptist beliefs. Development of the business also incorporated the fostering of overseas and colonial clients, and between 1900 and 1914 branches of the shop were opened in New York, Buenos Aires, Paris, and Montevideo.<br>
<br>In common with other clothing retailers, Burberry recognized the importance of promotion and publicity and ensured through R. B. Rolls, a partner in the firm by 1901, that the Burberry trade mark was associated in advertising and media coverage with specific &#145;heroic&#146; personalities. Lord Kitchener and Lord Baden Powell both adopted Burberry weatherproofs from the time of the South African War, leading to commissions for uniforms from the army and the Royal Marines by 1906. Sir E. H. Shackleton, Captain Scott, and Roald Amundsen all proved high-profile customers in choosing Burberry textiles for kits and tents on their polar expeditions, and the pioneer aviator Claude Grahame-White provided a precedent for the Royal Flying Corps in its decision to use Burberry as a clothing supplier during the First World War.<br>
<br>Burberry retired to Abbots Court near Weymouth in 1917 and devoted his time to personal religious and humanitarian causes. His adherence to the principles of healthy living which had underpinned the philosophy of his clothing and textile design found outlets in sport, teetotal and anti-smoking campaigns, and support for the Sunday closing movement. Burberry's achievement lay in the marrying of these ethics to an astute understanding of the sartorial demands of the English gentleman. Individual items of Burberry clothing thus incorporated many concessions to the radical dress reform movement, such as the prioritizing of ease of movement and comfort, quality of manufacture, and the use of natural materials, while retaining the appearance of British traditionalism which Burberry clothes came to epitomize. Having witnessed the transition of the firm to a public company in 1920, Burberry died at Crossways, his home in Hook, near Basingstoke, on 4 April 1926.<br>
