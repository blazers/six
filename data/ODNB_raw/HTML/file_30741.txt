<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Abbott,  Eric Symes</span>  (1906&#150;1983), <span class="occ">dean of Westminster</span>, was born on 26 May 1906 at Nottingham, the younger son and second of three children of William Henry Abbott, schoolteacher, and his wife, Mary Symes, also a teacher. A Dame Agnes Mellor scholar at Nottingham high school, he won a further scholarship to Jesus College, Cambridge (of which he became an honorary fellow in 1966), to read classics. A second class in part two (1928) following a first in part one (1927) was probably to be accounted for by many hours on the river coxing the college first eight, winning a trial cap, and being president of the university branch of the Student Christian Movement. In 1928 he crossed Jesus Lane to Westcott House and there came under the single most formative influence in his life: B. K. Cunningham. He obtained a third class in part one of the theological tripos in 1929.<br>
<br>Ordained in St Paul's Cathedral to serve at St John's, Smith Square (1930&#150;32), Abbott was then requested by King's College, London, to become chaplain. So began the twenty-five years in which he was to give all his care and almost all of himself to students who were being prepared for ordination. He was also chaplain to Lincoln's Inn in 1935&#150;6. In 1936, at the age of thirty, he accepted the wardenship of Lincoln Theological College with a staff that included a future archbishop of Canterbury. Here he shared his Anglican perception of priesthood with his students, opening up for them a way of interior faith, prayer, and self-discipline appropriate for the demands of parochial pastoral ministry. He was also canon and prebendary of Lincoln Cathedral (1940&#150;60).<br>
<br>The Second World War was coming to an end when Abbott was invited back to King's College as dean (1945&#150;55). This unique position as dean of the whole college in harness with a lay principal, as well as being head of the department and faculty of theology and warden of the hostel for theological students in Vincent Square, enabled him to influence the post-war revival of the college as a whole, to build up the staff in theology, and to create a postgraduate one-year college at Warminster for the immediate preordination spiritual and pastoral training (Lincoln style) of King's ordinands.<br>
<br>The total burden of this complex responsibility would have been more than enough; but to this public work was added private work of an exacting kind, a seemingly endless sequence of individuals drawn to him by his preaching and personality to seek spiritual guidance. This led to a vast correspondence (the &#145;apostolate of the post&#146;, as he called it). Even on holiday he would spend most mornings and evenings writing letters and the &#145;famous&#146; postcards. It is not surprising that latent heart trouble which was to dog his later years was aggravated by his years in London. The invitation in 1956 to become the sixth warden of Keble College, Oxford (but the first to be elected by the fellows under a new set of statutes), undoubtedly prolonged his working life. He was made an honorary fellow in 1960.<br>
<br>A colleague writing about the bracing effect of Abbott's four years at Keble commented: &#145;His main achievement was to give the college confidence in itself. He consolidated the college both in its internal and external relations. Though not an academic he understood and encouraged academic excellence&#146;  (private information). His swift intelligence, acute perception, and subtle wit, together with his accessibility, drew senior and junior members alike to consult him. An annual Eric Abbott lecture was later established at Keble in his memory.<br>
<br>In 1959 came the invitation to be dean of Westminster. Abbott's vision of the abbey was of a great church in which all questing men and women, irrespective of faith and race, would &#145;see Jesus&#146;. The theme for the celebration in 1965&#150;6 of the 900th anniversary of the founding of the abbey was &#145;One People&#146;. Events were planned to relate the abbey to the needs and aspirations of the modern world. The dean was present at almost all.<br>
<br>Throughout his years as dean Abbott influenced the form and preparation of services for weddings, memorials, and celebrations of national independence. Three royal weddings prepared and conducted by him further deepened his pastoral relationship with the royal family. His presence, prayer, and preaching, his care for art, music, literature, and drama, enhanced the worship and work of the abbey during fifteen years&#151;years which for him included episodes of debilitating ill health. He became a freeman of the city of Westminster in 1973. In 1974 he accepted the need to retire, but continued his ministry to individuals from his home in Vincent Square.<br>
<br>In 1966 he was appointed KCVO and made an honorary DD of London University. He was unmarried. He died at Haslemere on 6 June 1983. The stone that marks his grave in the abbey carries the inscription: &#145;Friend and counsellor of many, he loved the Church of England, striving to make this House of Kings a place of pilgrimage and prayer for all peoples. <i>Pastor Pastorum</i>&#146;.<br>
