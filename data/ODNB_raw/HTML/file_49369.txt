<span class="headword">Marie</span> <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Marie  de Coucy]</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1284), <span class="occ">queen of Scots, second consort of Alexander II</span>, was the elder daughter (there were also three sons) of Enguerrand (III) de Coucy, known as the Great (<i>d</i>. 1242), lord of Coucy in Picardy and great-grandson of King Louis VI of France (<i>r</i>. 1108&#150;37), and his third wife, Marie de Montmirail. She was admired by Matthew Paris for her beauty and was brought from France to be married at Roxburgh on 15 May 1239 to the forty-year-old Scottish king <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/322/', "Alexander II (1198&#150;1249)")</script>. Alexander's first wife, Joan of England, had died childless in 1238, and he had urgent dynastic reasons for his remarriage. In terms of European diplomacy, it evoked Alexander's alliance with the French in 1216&#150;17, when he and Marie's powerful father had probably met during the Franco-Scottish invasions of England. Such a reassertion of Scottish independence alarmed King Henry III, and contributed to the tensions that almost precipitated another Anglo-Scottish war in 1244.<br>
<br>Little is known about Marie's influence on the culture of the Scottish court, though her chancellor, Master Richard Vairement, possibly hailed from Vermand, near Coucy, and her nephew Enguerrand de Guines (who ultimately succeeded as lord of Coucy in 1311) became a leading Scottish magnate by wedding Christiana de Lindsay <i>c</i>.1280. Politically the most important result of Marie's marriage was undoubtedly the birth of her only child, the future <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/323/', "Alexander III")</script>, on 4 September 1241. She played no significant part during her son's troubled minority after Alexander II's death in 1249. According to Matthew Paris, as queen mother she was assigned a third of Scottish royal revenues, and he estimated her share at between 4000 and 7000 merks a year. Marie was at Dunfermline Abbey for the translation of St Margaret's relics on 19 June 1250, and crossed to France in October, but returned with a magnificent retinue for Alexander III's marriage to <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18045/', "Margaret of England")</script> at York on 26 December 1251. She then appears to have lived mainly in France until 1268. No doubt the ambitious Comyns had wanted to be rid of her so as to reinforce their dominance over the young Scottish king; but she also had pressing family duties in her homeland, due to the succession of her second brother Enguerrand (IV) de Coucy as a boy in 1250, and his imprisonment by King Louis IX (<i>r</i>. 1226&#150;70) in 1256.<br>
<br>Early in 1257, apparently to appease Louis for her brother's indiscretions, Marie married her second husband, Jean de Brienne or d'Acre, butler of France, whose father and namesake had been crowned king of Jerusalem in 1210 and emperor of Constantinople in 1231. They visited Scotland briefly in 1257, and both were appointed to a Scottish regency council in September 1258, though their role in state affairs was purely nominal. When Marie separated from Jean de Brienne in 1268 and returned to Scotland, Alexander III secured an agreement whereby she might remain in Scotland at her pleasure, and Jean (who long outlived Marie, dying only in 1296) would receive from her dower an annual pension of 500 merks. In 1276 she was granted safe conducts by the English government to undertake a pilgrimage to Canterbury and return to Scotland. In 1284 (the precise date is unrecorded) she died overseas, presumably in France.<br>
