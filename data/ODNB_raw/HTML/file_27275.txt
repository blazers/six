<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Thompson,  Pishey</span>  (1785&#150;1862), <span class="occ">antiquary</span>, was born on 18 June 1785 at Peachy Hall, Freiston, near Boston, Lincolnshire, the eldest child and only son of John Thompson (1756&#150;1792), grazier and butcher of nearby Benington, and his second wife, Mary Evison (<i>c</i>.1762&#150;1789). A &#145;forward&#146; boy, Pishey first attended a dame-school, probably at Benington, the village where he was brought up by his grandmother Bridget Thompson, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Pishey (1731&#150;1815), who maintained the family farm after her husband, John, died in 1772. From the age of six Pishey appears to have spent two years at Boston grammar school, where he excelled at Latin and mathematics, then four years at Wragby grammar school, followed by schools at Freiston and Skirbeck, near Boston. At sixteen years of age he returned for some time to the Freiston School as usher, and three years later he became a clerk, firstly in Sheath's Banks and then (in 1814) in Garfit's Bank in Boston; he also ran a bookselling business in the town.<br>
<br>Throughout life Thompson adhered to the Unitarian faith, and in politics was a radical. A keen antiquary, and of literary bent, he collected materials for a history of the town and its neighbouring villages, and his intention to publish such a work was announced in 1807. However, in 1819 he emigrated to Washington, DC, where many relations and friends were already settled. His historical materials were arranged and published in 1820 in Boston by John Noble as <span class="italic">Collections for a topographical and historical account of Boston and the hundred of Skirbeck in the county of Lincoln</span>.<br>
<br>Granted American citizenship, Thompson set up as a high-class bookseller and publisher in Pennsylvania Avenue, Washington, and became closely acquainted with leading citizens and presidents. He was founder member of All Souls Church Unitarian, and of the National Institute (the later Smithsonian Institution). He was a founder member of the George Washington memorial committee, and president of the first national theatre. He supported George Flower's slave-free settlement at Albion, Illinois, and worked for the national scheme for settling freed slaves in Liberia. These activities, together with a prolonged holiday back in Boston in 1827 at a time of financial crisis in Colombia, rendered him complacent about the interests of his business. Bankrupt and in great debt, he returned to Britain in November 1841 but failed to find adequate employment. In August 1843 he went again to America, having learned of a vacancy on the <span class="italic">New York Herald</span>. This did not materialize and he returned to Washington, where he reported senate proceedings for <span class="italic">The Globe</span> and was appointed reporter for the <span class="italic">National Intelligencer</span>&#151;a position he held almost until his death&#151;and supplemented his income by freelance accountancy. Thompson's most significant activity in America was as initial campaigner for a national bureau of statistics. His scheme was presented to congress, and an office was set up. President Tyler practically promised to appoint Thompson to run the bureau, but, apparently because their political views differed, Tyler gave the post to a clerk transferred from another state department.<br>
<br>On 6 November 1807 Thompson married Jane Tonge (1786&#150;1851) of Boston, but there were no children of the marriage. He nevertheless fathered a son born on 23 April 1824; the mother was Mary Wright, the eldest daughter of the Revd Richard Wright of Blakeney, Norfolk, the first missionary of the Unitarian church. The boy, named John Wright, was probably born in Washington (his mother had emigrated there with the Thompsons), but was brought up by his maternal relatives in Kirkstead, Lincolnshire. Despite the circumstances, an affectionate relationship, without rancour, subsisted between all concerned, and the illegitimacy remained a secret for many years to all but the immediate family. In due course John Wright became a leading Unitarian minister in Lancashire, renowned for his introduction of Sunday schools. Thompson returned to Britain in 1846, and settled in Stoke Newington, London. After the death of his wife on 16 July 1851 he finally put together his monumental <span class="italic">History of Boston</span>, published on 23 October 1856: it remained the only history of the town for 130 years. Thompson's income was meagre and uncertain, but occasionally friends, particularly the Flower family in Stratford upon Avon, found tactful ways of employing his services. Though living thus in considerable poverty, he could say before his death at his lodgings, 44 Church Street, Stoke Newington, London, on 25 September 1862, that he had repaid almost the whole of his debts. He was buried in New Gravel Pit churchyard, Paradise Place, Hackney. In memory of Thompson, a plaque on the south wall of Boston's parish church was later subscribed to by many of his friends.<br>
