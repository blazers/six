<span class="headword">Lockman,  John</span>  (1698&#150;1771), <span class="occ">author and translator</span>, was baptized on 3 March 1698 at St Paul's, Covent Garden, the son of Gerrard Lockman (<i>d</i>. 1714) and his wife, Sarah (<i>d</i>. 1742). According to his own statement he was born and spent his infancy in Petersham, Surrey  (<span class="italic">London Magazine</span>, 1735, 41), but most of his life was spent in London. It is not known where he went to school or what was his earliest occupation, but it is said that by dint of hard private study he became a tolerable scholar and learned to speak French by frequenting Slaughter's Coffee House  (Hawkins, 516n.). On 11 November 1725 he married Mary Boucher at St Peter-le-Poer Church, Bishopsgate.<br>
<br>In 1726 Lockman published <span class="italic">A Description of the Temple of Venus at Cnidus</span>, translated from the French, and over the following years he translated works of the marquise de Lambert, La Fontaine, Desfontaines, Le Sage, Marivaux, and King Stanislaus, as well as three substantial volumes of French travel writing. It was probably owing to his translation of Voltaire's <span class="italic">La Henriade</span> (1728) that, to Johnson's irritation, he was called &#145;<i>l'illustre Lockman</i>&#146; in France  (Boswell, <span class="italic">Life</span>, 4.6), though Lockman's <span class="italic">Henriade</span> (1732), in very flat blank verse with copious anti-Roman Catholic notes, was less successful than his translations of Voltaire's <span class="italic">Lettres philosophiques</span> (<span class="italic">Letters Concerning the English Nation</span>, 1733) and <span class="italic">Si&egrave;cle de Louis XIV</span> (<span class="italic">An Essay on the Age of Lewis XIV</span>, 1739). His translation of Charles Por&eacute;e's Latin <span class="italic">Oration</span> on whether the stage is a school for virtue (1734) was dedicated to Alexander Pope.<br>
<br>Lockman was one of the team who, for 25<i>s</i>. a sheet (&pound;1.25 for four printed folio pages), compiled the <span class="italic">General Dictionary, Historical and Critical</span>, in ten folio volumes (1734&#150;41), which incorporated Lockman's &#145;new and accurate translation&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 4254, fol. 116) of Bayle's <span class="italic">Dictionnaire</span>, as well as other articles by Lockman. Equally successful and more popular compilations by Lockman were his histories of England and of Rome in the form of question and answer, with parallel text in French and English, which were used as school books until long after their author's death: the copyright of his <span class="italic">History of England</span> was worth over &pound;100 in 1787 and its twenty-fifth edition appeared in 1811. It was said, perhaps with some exaggeration, that Lockman translated &#145;with general accuracy, more books for half a century together than any man of his time&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 314).<br>
<br>Between 1730 and 1767 Lockman wrote about twenty separately published occasional complimentary poems, as well as others in newspapers and magazines; also he wrote songs for the theatre, prologues, and epilogues, usually for good causes. His more substantial theatrical works were <span class="italic">David's Lamentation</span>, an oratorio with music by William Boyce (1736), and <span class="italic">Rosalinda</span>, a musical drama with music by John Christopher Smith (1740), to which was prefixed an enquiry into the rise of operas and oratorios.<br>
<br>Between 1756 and 1762 Lockman fruitlessly circulated proposals to publish his poems by subscription, though he assured Thomas Birch that this was &#145;not (Heaven be Praised) the effect of necessity&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 4312, fol. 233). Appointment as secretary to the council of the Free British Fishery, incorporated in 1750, had perhaps met Lockman's necessities: it certainly provided his motive for prose and verse pamphlets on the importance of the white herring fishery in 1750&#150;51, and presents of verses and herrings to the future George III when he was governor of the Free British Fishery. In 1734 Lockman had complained to Birch of &#145;unmerited rebuffs from the world&#146; and being &#145;compelled to labor day and night&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 4312, fol. 221), but, thanks, one supposes, to income from his fishery appointment and buoyant sales of the histories by question and answer, he published far less new writing after 1750 than before.<br>
<br>For his gentle and inoffensive manners Lockman was nicknamed the Lamb by his literary acquaintances. Nevertheless, when Thomas Cooke &#145;abused his poetry to his face&#146; Lockman, &#145;with a quickness not natural to him, retorted, &#147;It may be so; but, thank God! my name is not at full length in the DUNCIAD!&#148;&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 314). Lockman died on 2 February 1771 in Brownlow Street, Long Acre; he was survived by his wife.<br>
