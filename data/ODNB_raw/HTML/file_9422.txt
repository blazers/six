<span class="headword">Fills,  Robert</span>  (<em>c.</em>1521&#150;1578), <span class="occ">translator and Church of England clergyman</span>, is of obscure parentage. However, it is likely that he belonged to the Fell family who in the sixteenth century were distributed in the Furness district of Lancashire. Fills may plausibly be identified with the Robert Fellys who was admitted BA at Oxford in November 1542 and who was a scholar at St Alban Hall in 1543. He was dispensed in August 1546 to take holy orders outside the statutory time, and was ordained sub-deacon, deacon, and priest at Oxford on various dates in September 1546. <br>
<br>Fills fled England some time after the accession of Mary I, and he and his wife, Rose (<i>d</i>. 1578/9), became members, on 26 November 1557, of the Genevan congregation led by the Scottish reformer John Knox. Three days later he was entered (as &#145;Robert Fillet&#146;) in the city's <span class="italic">Livre des habitants</span>, with the designation &#145;Un Anglois&#146;. <br>
<br>Fills had returned to England by July of either 1560 or 1561 (probably the latter), when, on the petition of John Scory, also a quondam Genevan exile and now bishop of Hereford, he was presented by Elizabeth I to the third prebend (without cure of souls) in the quasi-collegiate church at Bromyard in Herefordshire; he was instituted to this benefice in June of either 1561 or 1562 (probably the latter). In April 1562 Fills published a translation of a text inspired by Calvin's teaching: <span class="italic">The lawes and statutes of Geneva, as well concerning ecclesiastical discipline, as civill regiment</span>, which was printed by Rowland Hall, the printer of the 1560 Geneva <span class="roman">Bible</span>. Although it makes no reference to Calvin himself, this translation, admitted by Fills to be &#145;worde for worde&#146;  (H&ouml;pfl, 268, n. 83) and judged &#145;highly accurate&#146; by H&ouml;pfl, includes not only the text of the ecclesiastical <span class="italic">Ordonnances</span> of 1560 but also that of the 1543 <span class="italic">Edicts</span> (that is, the civil constitution). Claiming to have obtained his raw materials &#145;oute of the register booke of the foresayde Citie&#146;  (sig. *3<i>v</i>), the translator dedicated his work to Lord Robert Dudley, the future earl of Leicester, testifying to Dudley's &#145;zeale &hellip; to the advau[n]cement of gods glorye in this realme, and the singuler &hellip; favour that you usually shewe to the furtherers thereof&#146;  (sig. *2<i>r</i>). Fills paraded his humanist learning in the dedicatory epistle by citing Aristophanes, Josephus, Xenophon, Plutarch, Aristotle, and Livy. <br>
<br>In 1563 Fills was preferred by an unknown patron to the Herefordshire rectory of Kingsland, and recorded by crown officials as having failed to compound for the first fruits of his Bromyard benefice. In that same year he published a translation from Theodore Beza: <span class="italic">A briefe and pith-thie summe of the Christian faith made in forme of a confession, with a confutation of all suche superstitious errours, as are contrary thereunto</span>, also printed by Rowland Hall. The translator boasts in the dedicatory epistle, addressed to Henry Hastings, the puritan third earl of Huntingdon and Lord Robert Dudley's brother-in-law, that he was &#145;somewhat acquainted&#146; with Beza himself  (sig. *2<i>r</i>), who was to succeed Calvin as the Genevan <i>antistes</i>. Referring to England, Fills took this opportunity to complain vituperatively of the &#145;myngle mangle of spirituall and temporall regiment&#146;, drawing particular attention to the state of the cathedrals, many allegedly being &#145;only a very refuge and denne of idell, ignoraunt, and unpreaching lubbers&#146;  (sig. 4<i>v</i>). There were at least six further editions of Fills's work by 1590. <br>
<br>Probably in 1564 Fills followed up <span class="italic">A briefe and pith-thie summe</span> with yet another translation from French: <span class="italic">A treatice co[n]teining certain meditatio[n]s of trew &amp; perfect consolatio[n]</span>, the original of which had been written by Martin Luther. Once again dedicating the book to Lord Robert Dudley, Fills writes of the peer's &#145;accustomable benevolent kindenes towards me&#146;  ([sig. A2<i>v</i>]). Fills's latest known translation from a French original, <span class="italic">Godly prayers and meditations, paraphrasticallye made upon all the psalmes</span>, survives in an edition ostensibly published in 1577, but possibly first published in 1566&#150;7 when the work was entered in the Stationers' register. <br>
<br>Described in 1567 as being resident and hospitable at Kingsland, Fills became one of the earl of Leicester's chaplains either in or before November 1567; a document dateable to 1567 alleges that he was then aged forty-six. On 16 November 1570, described as the earl's chaplain, he was presented by Leicester to the rectory of Pembridge, also in Herefordshire. His institution followed twelve days later. Documents of the mid-1570s record Fills as the pluralist rector of both Kingsland and Pembridge, whose annual income from those two benefices was reckoned to be at least &pound;67, a fairly substantial figure for the age. In 1576 Edmund Grindal, archbishop of Canterbury, appointed Fills a commissioner for his primary metropolitical visitation of the cathedral, city, and diocese of Hereford. <br>
<br>Certain leading puritans were shocked to learn, in February 1574, that copies of Fills's translation of Beza's &#145;Confessions&#146;&#151;presumably meaning a recent (and lost) edition of <span class="italic">A briefe and pith-thie summe</span>&#151;had lately been seized from stationers and burnt at Stationers' Hall in London. Fills was reportedly ready to defend the faithfulness of his translation, alleged to be the source of the difficulty. <br>
<br>Attended by his surgeon, who was to receive &#145;my Paracelsian still&#146;, Fills dictated his will on 16 October 1578. He was buried at Kingsland the next day. The will, in which the testator requested burial in the chancel at Kingsland, reveals something of the contents of Fills's library: &#145;my greate <span class="roman">Bible</span> in englishe &hellip; <span class="roman">Carions Chronicles</span>, <span class="roman">Flores doctoru[m]</span>, a greate <span class="roman">Bible of St Jeromes</span>, <span class="roman">Eliots Dictionarie</span>, marlorate and my Decades of Bullinger &hellip; all my frenche bookes &hellip; the frenche <span class="roman">Bible</span> &hellip; <span class="roman">Dodius herball</span> &hellip; [and] my englishe <span class="roman">Geneva Bible</span>&#146;  (Herefs. RO, MS 17/5/13). Fills was survived by his wife, but the will is silent about any issue of the marriage. <br>
<br>Although Fills's surname has sometimes been rendered &#145;Fitz&#146;, there is nothing to connect him with the Richard Fitz who was the minister of one of the earliest organized Elizabethan separatist congregations and who, in any case, seems to have derived from Devon stock. Garrett's suggestion that Fills may have been the father of John Field, the leading London co-ordinator of the Elizabethan puritan movement, is rightly rejected by Collinson. Fills's significance is twofold: as a popularizer of Calvinism for English readers and as a chaplain to the earl of Leicester. He may be added to the incomplete tally of Leicester's godly chaplains already identified by Adams  (S. Adams, &#145;A godly peer?: Leicester and the puritans&#146;, <span class="italic">History Today</span>, 40, 1990, 14&#150;19).<br>
