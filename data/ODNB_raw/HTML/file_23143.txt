<span class="headword">Raper,  Henry</span>  (1767&#150;1845), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, entered the navy in February 1780, on board the <i>Berwick</i> (74 guns), which in July joined Sir George Rodney in the West Indies. After returning in 1781, he took part in the battle on the Doggerbank on 5 August and was wounded. He afterwards served in the <i>Cambridge</i> (74 guns), and in her was at the relief of Gibraltar by Lord Howe in October 1782. He then joined the sloop <i>Marquis de Seignelay</i> (14 guns), a captured French privateer, with Commander John Hunter (1738&#150;1821), his former shipmate in the <i>Berwick</i>, and remained in her until 1785. From 1785 to 1788 he was in the <i>Salisbury</i>, the flagship of Rear-Admiral John Elliot, at Newfoundland, and afterwards in the <i>Impregnable</i> (98 guns) and <i>Queen Charlotte</i> (100 guns) in the channel until 22 November 1790, when he was promoted lieutenant. Through 1791 he served in the bomb (i.e. mortar) vessel <i>Vesuvius</i>, and in October 1793 he was appointed to the <i>Queen Charlotte</i>, flagship of Earl Howe, to whom he acted as signal lieutenant in May and on 1 June 1794. On 4 July he was promoted commander, and in September, on the recommendation of Howe, he was appointed signal officer on the staff of Vice-Admiral A. J. de Valle, of the Portuguese squadron serving with Howe. On resigning this post in December, he was presented with a diamond-hilted sword. In November 1795 he commanded the brig-sloop <i>Racoon</i> (16 guns) in the Thames; and on 1 February 1796 he was posted to the small frigate <i>Champion</i> (24 guns), employed on the coast of Ireland and afterwards in the North Sea. In January 1798 he assisted in the seizure of a Swedish convoy, which was brought into the Downs; and the following May he took part in the attempt to destroy the locks and sluice-gates of the Bruges and Ostend Canal.<br>
<br>From January 1799 to September 1802 Raper commanded the frigate <i>Aimable</i> (32 guns) in the West Indies and on 1 February 1799 he was promoted captain. In 1810 he declined an offer of the rank of vice-admiral in the Portuguese service; and in November that year he was appointed to the <i>Mars</i> (74 guns), which he commanded until February 1813, on the Lisbon station and in the Baltic. Despite repeated applications he had no further employment, but was promoted in due course rear-admiral on 12 August 1819, vice-admiral on 22 July 1830, and admiral on 23 November 1841. He published <span class="italic">A New System of Signals, by which Colours may be Wholly Dispensed with</span> (1828). He married, in 1798, a Miss Craig, and they had children. He died, after a very protracted illness, at South Audley Street, London, on 5 April 1845. His eldest son was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/23144/', "Henry Raper (1799&#150;1859)")</script>.<br>
