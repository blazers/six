<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Newbigin,  (James Edward) Lesslie</span>  (1909&#150;1998), <span class="occ">missionary and theologian</span>, was born on 8 December 1909 at 4 Tanquerville Terrace, Jesmond, Newcastle upon Tyne, the second child of Edward Richmond Newbigin (1863&#150;1940), shipping merchant, and his wife, Annie Ellen Affleck (<i>d</i>. 1962). His father was of Northumbrian, and his mother of Scottish descent. Both parents were convinced Presbyterians. His father was the owner and manager of a shipping company based in Newcastle upon Tyne, but was interested in a radical approach to national issues. After primary schooling in Newcastle and secondary as a boarder at the Quakers' Leighton Park School, near Reading, Newbigin gained entrance in 1928 to Queens' College, Cambridge, where he read geography and economics with a view to joining his father's firm. His energies were soon occupied with debating and with the Student Christian Movement (SCM). At a camp for unemployed men in south Wales in the summer of 1929, he saw, in a sleepless night of worry at his own failure to handle such a situation, a vision of Christ on the cross reaching &#145;down to the most hopeless and sordid of human misery, and yet promis[ing] life and victory&#146;  (Newbigin, 12)&#151;a conviction that was to shape the rest of his life.<br>
<br>A year later, at an SCM conference, in a moment of quiet prayer Newbigin believed he received an unambiguous &#145;order&#146; to offer for ordination, and was startled by a suggestion later that day that he join the SCM staff when he graduated in 1931. So he went to Glasgow as one of two Scottish secretaries, the other being Helen Stewart Henderson (1907&#150;1999), daughter of the Revd Robert Henderson. Newbigin quickly knew he was to share his life with her. In fact, because of the strict rules of the Church of Scotland for its missionaries, they could not marry until 20 August 1936, just before they set out for India. Meanwhile Newbigin made good use of his two years of working with students and the three of theological studies at Westminster College, Cambridge, to develop an unusually penetrating and clear intelligence. A short book, <span class="italic">Christian Freedom in the Modern World</span> (1937), in response to Macmurray's <span class="italic">Freedom in the Modern World</span> of 1932, was finished on the boat.<br>
<br>During an initial intensive period of study of Tamil, in which he became outstandingly fluent, indeed eloquent, Newbigin suffered a severe leg injury in a bus accident and had to return to Scotland. On returning to India in September 1939 the Newbigins were stationed in Kanchipuram, Madras, where as &#145;district missionary&#146; until 1946 Newbigin gained a profound respect for the people of humble villages and for the potential of the Christian leaders among them. He was increasingly drawn into discussions towards the unity of three denominations (Presbyterian and Congregational, Methodist, Anglican)&#151;to such good effect that in the epoch-making service on 27 September 1947 inaugurating the united Church of South India he was one of the fourteen new bishops consecrated. His diocese was Madurai and Ramnad, in south-east Tamil Nadu, where he was soon immersed both in the inner-church work of preaching and caring for the congregations and in the wider care for the health, economic possibilities, and political prospects of the total community, which involved him in searching discussions with leading Hindus.<br>
<br>On leave in 1946&#150;7 Newbigin faced the bitter arguments in Britain over this pioneering inter-church union, and he provided a deeply theological approach to their resolution in his first major book, <span class="italic">The Reunion of the Church: a Defence of the South India Scheme</span> (1948, revised edn, 1960). The reputation this earned him was heightened by his <span class="italic">A South India Diary</span> (1951, revised edn, 1960), a winning portrait of a church growing from its local roots and of a caring, imaginative bishop. In August 1948 he shared, as a delegate of the Church of South India, in the inaugural Amsterdam assembly of the World Council of Churches (WCC), with many of whose leaders and staff he was acquainted from SCM days. He served on the group drafting the assembly's <span class="italic">Message</span> and presented to the plenary session its eventual text, largely his own work. So began an oft-repeated story within that council: Newbigin, like William Temple between the wars, almost always proved able to produce from complex debates a text of shining clarity and good sense, offering a reconciling, forward-looking view that earned general agreement.<br>
<br>The Madura years saw Newbigin active alike on the Indian church scene and on the international level, where the advent of air travel made it possible for him to share in key meetings of both the WCC and the International Missionary Council (IMC); the IMC's founding conference in Edinburgh in 1910 had provided the essential impetus for the WCC, and it was now actively debating integration with it. In 1952 he delivered the Kerr lectures at Glasgow, published as his second major book, <span class="italic">The Household of God</span> (1953), on the nature of the church. In 1957&#151;to his surprise, indeed dismay&#151;he was approached about becoming general secretary of the IMC, an appointment confirmed by its 1958 assembly in Ghana. So he left India in mid-1959, by which time he had delivered lectures at Harvard, published in 1961 as <span class="italic">A Faith for this One World?</span>, and written for the IMC an influential quasi-manifesto, <span class="italic">One Body, One Gospel, One World: the Christian Mission Today</span> (1958).<br>
<br>Based at first in London, from 1962 in Geneva, Newbigin was widely acclaimed as the leader of the &#145;world mission&#146; constituency later gathered in the division of world mission and evangelism of the WCC&#151;travelling, preaching, writing, and consulting and being consulted by church leaders in every continent. One of his major contributions was the section report on unity from the WCC's third assembly (1961). This for the first time offered a vision of what God's will and gift of unity could look like, starting from the local level with &#145;all in each place who are baptized into Jesus Christ and confess him as Lord and Saviour&#146; and climaxing with a vision of Christians who have<blockquote>a corporate life reaching out in witness and service to all and who at the same time are united with the whole Christian fellowship in all places and all ages in such wise that ministry and members are accepted by all, and that all can act and speak together as occasion requires for the tasks to which God calls his people. (<span class="italic">The New Delhi Report</span>, 1962, 116)</blockquote>Newbigin also took a leading role in the world mission conference at Mexico in 1963 under the theme &#145;Mission on six continents&#146;, at which the old, hurtful distinction between &#145;sending&#146; and &#145;receiving&#146; churches could be overcome in the agreement that Christ's mission was now entrusted to each local church to pursue in its own place and way, with the support&#151;and on occasion correction&#151;of all other local churches: a vision of catholicity in mission that remains a keystone of the ecumenical movement. <span class="italic">The Relevance of Trinitarian Doctrine for Today's Mission</span> (1963) brought his distinctive theological approach to a wider audience.<br>
<br>Yet Newbigin did not altogether enjoy the Geneva years, and was happy to be elected bishop in Madras and to return to India with his wife Helen&#151;their four children (three daughters and a son) by now grown up&#151;in mid-1965. His years there brought constant demands on him from the local, national, and international levels. He remained active in the WCC, especially in its &#145;faith and order&#146; commission. Addresses continued to appear in book form: <span class="italic">Honest Religion for Secular Man</span> (1966), his riposte to the debate around John Robinson; <span class="italic">The Finality of Christ</span> (1969), originally given in Yale University; and <span class="italic">The Good Shepherd: Meditations on Christian Ministry in Today's World</span> (1974, revised edn, 1977).<br>
<br>In 1974 Newbigin and his wife travelled back to retirement in the UK by local transport, carrying only two suitcases and a rucksack from Madras to Munich. Forbidden to cross Iraq or Syria, they hitch-hiked with a friendly Turkish workman from Tabriz to the Armenian border, and thence to Erzurum and Cappadocia. They had decided to live in Birmingham, in order that Newbigin could serve the Selly Oak Colleges as a part-time lecturer in mission studies. His work there resulted in <span class="italic">The Open Secret: Sketches for a Missionary Theology</span> (1978, second edn, 1995). He was also soon caught up in many other activities, not least in the United Reformed church (URC), in which the English Presbyterians had united with the Congregationalists, and which was pursuing the possibility of further unity with the Methodists and the Church of England. Newbigin served as the URC's national moderator in 1978&#150;9, also as one of its representatives on the churches' unity commission, whose plan for &#145;covenanting for unity&#146; of 1980 fell victim, like the Anglican&#150;Methodist unity scheme ten years earlier, to an insufficient majority among the clergy in the general synod of the Church of England, though not without a hard-fought battle also in the URC.<br>
<br>In <span class="italic">The Light has Come: an Exposition of the Fourth Gospel</span> (1982), Newbigin published a magisterial commentary on <span class="roman">St John</span>, while <span class="italic">Unfinished Agenda: an Autobiography</span> (1985, second edn, 1993) provided an engaging, fast-paced, and attractively humble record. Addresses and articles continued to pour from his portable typewriter. Notable among them were &#145;The welfare state&#146; for Westminster Abbey's Gore lecture; &#145;What is &#147;a local church truly united&#148;?&#146; for the <span class="italic">Ecumenical Review</span>; &#145;A Christian perspective on the city&#146; for <span class="italic">Faith in the City of Birmingham</span>, a twenty-page summary of the theology many had missed in the national report <span class="italic">Faith in the City</span>; <span class="italic">Your Kingdom Come</span> (1979), biblical reflections on the theme of the WCC's world mission conference at Melbourne in 1980; <span class="italic">Mission in Christ's Way</span> (1987), in preparation for the next at San Antonio, Texas, in 1989; and <span class="italic">Come Holy Spirit&#151;Renew the Face of the Earth</span>, a lecture towards the 1991 WCC assembly in Canberra. As a former director of the world mission commission he was a guest at the Texas conference, giving an outstanding impromptu after-hours address. In November 1996 he flew, his last major journey, to spend a few days at the corresponding conference in Salvador de Bahia, Brazil, where his brief but far-sighted contribution was welcomed with great warmth.<br>
<br>Meanwhile Newbigin had given fifteen years to what he called &#145;the most intensely missionary period of my life&#146;, engaging at depth with the underlying assumptions and unspoken convictions of the &#145;Western, post-Enlightenment&#146; culture that was spreading all over the world and sapping the foundations of religious traditions, including Christian faith. This began when a planning group of the British Council of Churches, considering a major &#145;church and society conference&#146; for 1984, ran into uncertainty. Newbigin offered to draft a sketch of what its discussions could be indicating, and within ten days had sent a fifty-page manuscript which many who read it, including both the Anglican and Roman Catholic archbishops, found deeply exciting. It became <span class="italic">The other Side of 1984: Questions for the Churches</span> (1983), sold worldwide in many different languages and editions. It was followed during the next ten years by <span class="italic">Foolishness to the Greeks: the Gospel and Western Culture</span> (1986), <span class="italic">The Gospel in a Pluralist Society</span> (1989), <span class="italic">Truth to Tell: the Gospel as Public Truth</span> (1991), and three chapters in <span class="italic">Faith and Power: Christianity and Islam in &#145;Secular&#146; Britain</span> (1998)&#151;all pursuing his passionate concern for the nature of truth and obedience to God's will in a society and culture that had grown indifferent to this entire genre of question. In these years he lectured frequently in Europe and North America, with a memorable visit to India for the fiftieth anniversary of the IMC's Tambaram world mission conference.<br>
<br>After a move to live in sheltered housing in London in 1992, Newbigin was often invited to speak at Holy Trinity, Brompton, sanctuary for evangelicals and charismatics&#151;hardly his lifelong supporters but among whom he found an attentive audience for his central theological concerns. A heart-warming service in September 1997 celebrated his fifty years as a bishop, all spent in leadership of united and uniting churches. Despite a number of health scares in earlier years, it was only at Christmas 1997, on a visit to his eldest daughter in Manchester, that his heart started to give out; he died, not without thought-provoking reflections shared with those visiting his bedside, in south London on 30 January 1998. His funeral service was at the Dulwich Grove URC on 7 February, led jointly by a Nigerian Anglican and a British URC minister; his body was cremated at nearby Norwood the same day. A memorial service was held in Southwark Cathedral on 28 March. He was survived by his wife, Helen, and their four children.<br>
<br>Newbigin was one of relatively few British Christians to have reshaped the thinking and witness of the worldwide church in the twentieth century. He was noted for his combination of five characteristics. In his speaking and writing, he stood out for the fluency of his rigorous, yet unfailingly attractive, fair, and persuasive argument with major strands in current debate. This was invariably grounded in an unshakeable belief in the centrality of God, and in God's initiatives in Jesus and in the Spirit, as the deepest fact and truth underlying everything else. He discerned the universal horizon of whatever he dealt with, whether the dilemmas of a Western welfare state or a dialogue with Hindu friends in India or Handsworth. He always held together in a profound wholeness and integrity both faith and life, both religious teachings and social practice, both the concerns of an individual and the needs of society, God's purposes for both the church and the world. All of these were bathed in the courtesy and infectious laughter of a man who had long since forgotten how to think of himself more highly than he ought to.<br>
