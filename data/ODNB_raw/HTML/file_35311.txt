<span class="headword">Olsson,  Julius</span>  (1864&#150;1942), <span class="occ">marine painter</span>, was born in Islington, London, on 1 February 1864, the third son of Martin Olsson, a Swedish timber agent, and his English wife, Elizabeth Henrietta Tucker. He should not be confused with the Swedish-born painter Bror Julius Olsson (1878&#150;1955), who became a pioneer of post-impressionism in Chicago and changed his surname to that of his mother, Nordfelst. Julius Olsson grew up in Sweden, at Varmland and Karlstrand, and in his childhood he often crossed the North Sea between Gotenberg and Milwall with his father. He was twice married: first, in 1885, to Catherine Mary (<i>d</i>. 1923), daughter of Charles Butt, timber merchant, of Hull; second, in 1925, to Edith Mary, daughter of Charles Luke Ellison, a horse breeder from Castlereagh. There were no children of either marriage. According to his nephew H. William Olsson he was self-taught as a painter. He first painted landscapes in Sweden but settled in St Ives, in Cornwall, in 1888. He was among the first artists of what became the St Ives school, and his place as its founder was secured by the popularity of his paintings of that area and by his teaching of several painters of the next generation who remained in St Ives. He was typical of one strand of the great inundation of sea painting in Britain in the 1880s in that he concentrated on the romantic mood of the sea itself, as subject, rather than the work of fishermen, and in this he was distinct from the rival art colony at Newlyn. His heavily textured oil technique allowed dramatic effects of light and shade, and he specialized in painting nocturnal scenes under moonlight. The titles of his seascapes, for example <span class="italic">Moonlit Shore</span>, purchased in 1911 for the Chantrey collection at the Tate Gallery, record Olsson's interest in a certain effect of light on the sea. He painted the coast also in Dorset, the Channel Islands, the Mediterranean, and especially in Ireland. His pupils included the Canadian modernist Emily Carr (1871&#150;1945), about 1900, and the artists who became the leaders of the St Ives school in the 1920s, R. Borlase Smart (1881&#150;1947) and John Anthony Park (1878&#150;1962).<br>
<br>Olsson exhibited, plentifully and with success, at the Royal Academy from 1890 to 1940. He joined the Royal Institution of Painters in Oils in 1897 and was its president from 1919 until his death. He twice won gold medals at the Paris Salon, where he exhibited from 1910, and twice served on the committee of the Carnegie International Exhibition in Pittsburgh. He was appointed an associate of the Royal Academy in 1914 and Royal Academician in 1920. In Cornwall he became a justice of the peace and was captain of the West Cornwall Golf Club.<br>
<br>From about 1912 Olsson lived in London, and during the First World War he advised the Admiralty on ship camouflage. He was nevertheless included in the opening exhibition in 1927 of the St Ives Society of Artists, and the first exhibition at the Porthmeor Gallery, where the members showed, was officially opened by Olsson in 1928. After his London home was damaged by bombing he moved to Dalkey, near Dublin, where he died on 8 September 1942.<br>
