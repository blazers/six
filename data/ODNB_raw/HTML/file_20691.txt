<span class="headword">Oldham,  Thomas</span>  (1816&#150;1878), <span class="occ">geologist</span>, was born on 4 May 1816 at Dublin, the eldest son of Thomas Oldham, a broker with the Grand Canal Company, and his wife, Margaret Boyd. He was educated at a private school in Dublin and when he was fifteen entered Trinity College, Dublin, where he received his BA in 1836. Following graduation he went to Edinburgh in order to study civil engineering. While there he attended a number of classes at the university, including those on geology given by Robert Jameson. He also worked on civil engineering projects in the city.<br>
<br>On Oldham's return to Ireland in March 1838 he was appointed principal geological assistant to the geological department of the Ordnance Survey of Ireland under Joseph Portlock (1794&#150;1864) and undertook extensive field mapping in the counties of Londonderry and Tyrone. In 1840 he made the important discovery of trace fossils in the Cambrian rocks of the Bray group, co. Wicklow, forms which, in 1848, Edward Forbes (1815&#150;1854) named <i>Oldhamia</i> in his honour. In June 1843, following the disbandment of Portlock's geological department, Oldham was appointed curator of the museum of the Geological Society of Dublin, a post which he held until January 1845. From 1848 to 1850 he served as president of that society. In November 1844 he became assistant professor of civil engineering in Trinity College under Sir John MacNeill (1793&#150;1880). In April 1845 Oldham was appointed professor of geology in Dublin University, and on 1 July the following year he was made local director for Ireland of the newly formed Geological Survey of Great Britain and Ireland. He also proceeded MA in 1846. Oldham's work in Ireland was much praised by his superiors, but he was a stern critic of any mapping which he considered unsatisfactory, in particular that by Frederick McCoy (1823&#150;1899).<br>
<br>Oldham married in late 1850 Louisa Matilda, daughter of William Dixon of Liverpool. They had five sons (including the Indian geologist and seismologist <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37820/', "Richard Dixon Oldham")</script>), and one daughter. On 14 November of that year, following the recommendation of Henry De la Beche (1796&#150;1855), Oldham was appointed to the post of geological surveyor to the East India Company, a position which offered him the substantially increased salary of &pound;1000 per annum. He and his wife arrived in Calcutta in March 1851. Here he immediately styled himself &#145;superintendent of the geological survey of India&#146;, and for the next twenty-five years worked tirelessly to build up the staff of the survey and to improve its scientific competency. A large proportion of India was mapped geologically during this time, enabling the publication of the first official geological map of the sub-continent in 1877. Attention was also directed to economic geology, particularly in mapping the coalfields of Bengal. In 1856, as part of a major reorganization of the survey, Oldham established a new Calcutta headquarters where he built up a fine library and museum. He initiated the modern scientific study of earthquakes in India, and organized a collection of meteorites which by his death had become one of the world's finest. He was also instrumental in the establishment of the Indian Museum in 1866. A keen supporter of geological education in India, he instituted a system of geological apprenticeships for Indians in the survey in 1873.<br>
<br>Oldham was elected a member of the Royal Irish Academy in 1842, and a fellow of the Geological Society of London in 1843 and of the Royal Society in 1848, receiving the latter's royal medal in 1875. In India he was elected a member of the Asiatic Society of Bengal in 1857 and served as its president four times between 1868 and 1876. A bearded, patriarchal figure in later life, he commanded great respect for his scientific rigour and administrative dynamism, and is justly remembered as the &#145;architect&#146; of the geological survey of India. Over 120 publications are attributed to Oldham. In Ireland, in addition to official reports, he published some twenty-nine papers mainly in the <span class="italic">Journal of the Geological Society of Dublin</span>. As superintendent he inaugurated three important high-quality series of geological survey of India publications&#151;the <span class="italic">Records</span>, <span class="italic">Memoirs</span>, and <span class="italic">Palaeontologia Indica</span>. To the former two he made over fifty contributions. The series of annual reports was also begun by him in 1859. Other papers appeared mainly in the <span class="italic">Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal</span> and in <span class="italic">Nature</span>.<br>
<br>Following his retirement from the survey owing to ill health, in March 1876 Oldham returned to England and lived at Eldon Place, Rugby. During this time he was appointed an examiner in geology to the University of London, a post which he had also held in respect of the Royal Indian Engineering College, Cooper's Hill. He died at 18 Hillmorton Road, Rugby, after a brief illness, on 17 July 1878; his wife survived him.<br>
