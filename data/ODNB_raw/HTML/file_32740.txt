<span class="headword">Davies,  Robert</span>  (1816&#150;1905), <span class="occ">benefactor</span>, born at Llangefni, Anglesey, on 1 April 1816, was the second son of Richard Davies (1778&#150;1849), a general storekeeper at Llangefni, and his wife, Anne, daughter of Owen Jones of Coed Hywel, near Llangefni. He was educated at the national school, Llangefni, and at a private school in Chester. As he and his two brothers grew up, their father extended his business, opening a branch for importing timber and iron at Menai Bridge, which he placed under the management of his eldest son, John, who died unmarried in 1848 and to whose business ability the successful development of the family firm was largely due. An iron foundry at Caernarfon was put under Robert's charge, while a store at Redwharf Bay was entrusted to the youngest son, Richard. The shipping and freight business which the brothers operated at Menai Bridge was extremely successful, and as the firm established itself as one of the largest shipowning concerns in the district, the other businesses were disposed of and the three brothers settled in the area.<br>
<br>While at Caernarfon Davies had taken an active part in the work of a ragged school in the town and in subsequent years he had charge of a class of children in a Sunday school of which he was for a short time superintendent. With these exceptions, and that of serving as high sheriff of Anglesey for 1862, he took no part in public work. About 1862 he settled at Bodlondeb, a house overlooking the Menai Strait, near Bangor, and here he led a somewhat eccentric and parsimonious life, letting his share of the profits of the business accumulate. After 1885 he began giving money, generally anonymously or under assumed names, towards liquidating the debts of his own denomination, the Calvinistic Methodists. He was popularly credited with giving &pound;&frac12; million towards chapel debts, although his donations probably did not much exceed &pound;150,000. His other benefactions were &pound;177,000 to endow the Welsh Methodist mission in India, &pound;10,000 to an orphanage (of the same connection) at Bontnewydd, near Caernarfon, and &pound;10,000 to the British and Foreign Bible Society (of which he was a vice-president). At a cost of &pound;5000 he built an English chapel for the Calvinistic Methodists at Menai Bridge (where he was commemorated by a window and tablet), and gave &pound;1200 towards restoring the Welsh chapel at the same place, to the building of which he and his brother had contributed generously. His gifts to educational institutions included &pound;1000 to the founding of the normal college at Bangor in 1856 and &pound;1000 to the University College, Bangor (1884), and financial assistance in the establishment and maintenance of a British School at Menai Bridge. His almsgiving for many years took the eccentric form of a weekly distribution of 12 pounds of flour to between seventy and a hundred people, who personally collected this dole from Bodlondeb every Tuesday.<br>
<br>Davies died unmarried and intestate at Bodlondeb on 29 December 1905, and was buried on 2 January 1906 with his parents in the parish churchyard of Llangefni. His estate was valued at more than &pound;400,000.<br>
<br>His younger brother, <a name="cosubject_45553"></a><span class="headword">Richard Davies</span>  (1818&#150;1896), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born at Llangefni, Anglesey, on 29 November 1818, and married Annie Rees (1836&#150;1918), daughter of the nonconformist minister <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/23284/', "Henry Rees")</script>, in 1855. He was possessed of business acumen and public qualities of a high order. A Liberal in politics, he unsuccessfully contested the tory seat of Caernarfon Boroughs in 1852, but in 1868 he was granted a historic victory when he was returned as the first nonconformist member of parliament for his native county of Anglesey, a seat which he held until 1886. Davies was appointed high sheriff of Anglesey in 1858 and its lord lieutenant in 1884, being the first nonconformist to hold those offices in Wales. He died at his residence, Treborth, near Bangor, on 27 October 1896, and was buried at Llandysilio cemetery, Anglesey, on 31 October.<br>
