<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Russell,  Richard</span>  (1687&#150;1759), <span class="occ">physician</span>, was born on 26 November 1687 at the High Street (at a house now numbered 77), Lewes, Sussex, the eldest of the seven children of Nathaniel Russell (1657&#150;1713), apothecary, and his wife, Mary (1659&#150;1737?), daughter of Drew Ellis, yeoman, of Southerham, near Lewes. He attended the town's grammar school and was probably apprenticed to a surgeon in London, where he also assisted the physician George Howe (1654/5&#150;1710). As a surgeon practising in Lewes, in 1713 he reported a case to the Royal Society and commanded the high premium of &pound;80 for an apprentice. But his practice and interest extended more widely, as it was with a thesis on epilepsy in children, promoted by Hermann Boerhaave, that in December 1724 he graduated MD at the University of Leiden, a mere two months after matriculation. After a few further months in Rotterdam he returned to Lewes by October 1725, to take over the practice of Peter White, just deceased. Russell quickly established himself as the leading physician in east Sussex, soon prosperous enough to invest in property. On 4 December 1719 he married&#151;despite her parents' opposition&#151;Mary (1698&#150;1764), only child of William Kempe, gentleman, and his wife, Mary, of Malling deanery, in South Malling, near Lewes. Nevertheless on Kempe's death in January 1721 his estate passed to his daughter, and Russell lived there for the rest of his life. He and his wife had five daughters and two sons between 1720 and 1735, all of whom outlived him. His daughter Hannah (<i>d</i>. 1761) was the mother of the physician <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21904/', "Sir Lucas Pepys")</script>.<br>
<br>In the 1720s Russell observed how people living on the coast drank sea water to cure diseases of the lower belly, and at Leiden he was considering how to treat glandular secretions. From the 1730s Brighton, 8 miles from Lewes, was attracting visitors for informal recreation by the sea and on the South Downs, and patients were there following Russell's regime of sea water bathing and drinking, some of them referred by London physicians. He distilled his experience in <span class="italic">De tabe glandulari, sive, De usu aqu&aelig; marin&aelig; in morbis glandularum dissertatio</span> (1750). After the proprietor of a London mineral water warehouse published a pirated English translation in 1752 (fifth edition, 1769), Russell issued his own the following year, as <span class="italic">A Dissertation Concerning the Use of Sea Water in the Diseases of the Glands</span>. Demand for his treatment encouraged him in 1753&#150;4 to buy tenements on the low cliff at the eastern edge of Brighton, and build a substantial five-bay house for the reception of patients. In many cases the virtue of Russell's sea water treatments lay not in the water itself, but in the dietetic and hygienic routine and discipline imposed in Brighton's attractive surroundings. Russell's success helped to popularize such treatments and contributed to Brighton's emergence as Britain's first fashionable seaside resort.<br>
<br>Professional recognition came with election as a fellow of the Royal Society on 13 February 1752, and, two years later, with the MD degree from the University of Cambridge granted by royal licence on the recommendation of the Royal College of Physicians and the university's chancellor, the duke of Newcastle. For the degree he submitted a synopsis of <span class="italic">The Oeconomy of Nature in Acute and Chronical Diseases of the Glands</span> (Latin and English editions, 1755). Russell had long supported Newcastle's political interest in Sussex and benefited from his patronage.<br>
<br>Russell died on 21 December 1759, and was buried at South Malling Church three days later. His eldest son and heir, William, a lawyer, took the surname of Kempe, as required by his grandfather's will if he was to enjoy the estate settled on his mother; his inheritance included about 1300 acres of land in east Sussex. The greater part of Russell's practice at Brighton passed to Dr Anthony Relhan.<br>
<br>This Richard Russell has previously been confused with <a name="cosubject_24336"></a><span class="headword">Richard Russel</span>  (1714?&#150;1771), <span class="occ">physician</span>, possibly born on 18 December 1714 at Selmeston, Sussex, the son of the Revd Richard Russel MA, vicar of Alfriston and of Selmeston, and his wife, Juliana. After eight years at Westminster School Russel studied medicine for seven years, in hospitals and with an apothecary in London, by taking the MD degree at Rheims in June 1738, and finally with the famed man-midwife Gregoire in Paris. He started to practise at Hoddesdon, Hertfordshire, and in early 1741 was appointed physician to the branch of Christ's Hospital at Ware, Hertfordshire, but failed to obtain the appointment at the Hertford branch in 1742. On 4 August 1741 he married Elizabeth Wilkins of Hoddesdon at Christ Church, Newgate Street, London, and he was admitted an extra licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians, London, on 23 July 1742. About 1747 he moved to Henley-on-Thames, Oxfordshire, and about 1750 to Reading, Berkshire. There he became involved in a dispute with Anthony Addington, the father of Lord Sidmouth, in connection with which he published two pamphlets, <span class="italic">A letter to Dr. Addington of Reading, on his refusal to join in consultation with a physician, who had taken his degree abroad, and was approved and licensed by the College of Physicians</span> (1749), and <span class="italic">Letter to Mr. Thomas Bigg, late surgeon of St Bartholomew's Hospital, occasioned by his having written a defamatory letter to Dr. Addington against Dr. Russel of Reading</span> (1751). He died at Reading on 5 July 1771.<br>
