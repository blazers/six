<span class="headword">Collins,  Cecil James Henry</span>  (1908&#150;1989), <span class="occ">painter</span>, was born in Plymouth on 23 March 1908, the only child of Henry Collins, an engineer in a Plymouth laundry, and his wife, Mary Bowie. He won scholarships to the Plymouth School of Art (1924&#150;7) and the Royal College of Art (RCA) (1927&#150;31), where he was a favourite pupil of William Rothenstein. At the RCA he met a fellow student, <a href="#cosubject_73728">Elisabeth Ward Ramsden [<i>see below</i>]</a>, whom he married on 3 April 1931. There were no children of the marriage: according to Elisabeth Collins, &#145;I could never have had children; Cecil <i>was</i> a child&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Independent</span>, 22 Feb 2000).<br>
<br>The chief contemporary artistic influences on Collins at this time were Picasso and Klee; other strong influences were Byzantine art, the music of Igor Stravinsky's classical period, and contemporary scientific illustrations, both of cell biology and of astronomy. His early love of Shelley and Shakespeare was now augmented by his studies of Coleridge and Milton. When he and his wife went to live in a lonely cottage near Speen, Buckinghamshire, these influences, together with readings in the English mystics and the silence of the place, inspired him to do his first visionary paintings, which were successfully shown at his first London exhibition, at the Bloomsbury Gallery in 1935. Herbert Read, much impressed, included his work in the London International Surrealist Exhibition in 1936. Collins's association with the surrealists was short-lived, for he was accused of religious sympathies and excluded from the movement.<br>
<br>In the late 1930s Collins and his wife went to live near Dartington Hall, Devon, where the American artist Mark Tobey was teaching. Tobey and Bernard Leach aroused his interest in Eastern thought and art. There he painted several great works, such as <span class="italic">The Voice</span>, <span class="italic">The Quest</span>, and the double portrait <span class="italic">The Artist and his Wife</span> (1939; Tate collection). The artistic and intellectual stimuli at Dartington, together with the threat of war, inspired Collins to paint his most famous series of works, based on the image of the Fool, which he began in late 1939. To him the Fool signified &#145;purity of consciousness&#146;, and he gave to his many depictions of the image qualities that were threatened by the Second World War: charm, fun, compassion, and insight. Rejected for war service at a time when the Dartington community was depleted by the internment of many of its teachers, who had taken refuge there from Germany, Collins was asked to teach, and it was then that he discovered his great gifts as a teacher.<br>
<br>Collins's exhibition at the Lefevre Gallery in 1944, even though cut short by a flying bomb, was an outstanding success. He and his wife had left Dartington by this time and lived variously in London, Yorkshire, Oxford, and Cambridge. In this period Collins produced his &#145;paradisal drawings&#146; and experimented with print making. He also published in 1947 his essay <span class="italic">The Vision of the Fool</span>, a work that expresses his feelings about the role of the artist (the Fool) in the modern world of war and industrialization. This time of success was to be followed by a long period when some critics turned against him and others neglected him. He took up teaching again, at the Central School of Arts and Crafts from 1951 onwards, and leaned towards the traditional images of Christianity. He found a new freedom in painting large works, based on the principle of what he called the &#145;matrix&#146;: he would let the image come to him out of a preliminary working with his paints in a seemingly wild and chaotic manner. Thus he independently discovered something of what the American abstract expressionists had been doing for years. These new works were shown in a major retrospective of his work at the Whitechapel Gallery in 1959. The matrix period led him to explore in greater depth the three main images of his work: the Fool, the Lady or Anima, and the Angel. The matrix period was followed by a return to a calmer, more classical, style in which he continued to express the moods of the spiritual worlds these images conveyed to him. The Fool, the Lady, and the Angel all have access to the world of the Great Happiness, which is the true source of creativity. In his portrayals of the Lady, Collins gave new expression to the ancient tradition of Wisdom or Sapientia as a beautiful woman, and in his angels he showed creatures who are constantly and mysteriously always present and ready to give guidance.<br>
<br>When in 1975 the Central School of Art tried to end Collins's teaching contract, his students arose in rebellion on his behalf. His contract was extended for a year, but the battle had to be fought again with each new generation of students marching and demonstrating, and with correspondence in national newspapers supporting his cause. The conflict, which arose from objections to the originality of his teaching methods and the metaphysical ideas on which they were founded, often debilitated him and distracted him from painting. Nevertheless he received support from other quarters, notably from his association with the Anthony d'Offay Gallery from 1976 onwards, an Arts Council film of his work in 1978, and a Tate Gallery exhibition of his prints in 1981, the year in which his poems <span class="italic">In the Solitude of this Land</span> and a reprint of <span class="italic">The Vision of the Fool</span> were published. These were followed by two full-length television documentaries in 1984 and 1988.<br>
<br>In early manhood and into middle age Collins wore a beard. In later years the curvature of his spine, brought about by deprivations in his early life, became very pronounced, though it never affected his co-ordination. He had great physical calm, with long, fine, thin fingers with which he would seemingly shape his sentences in front of him as he spoke. He was very nervous of catching colds and would often be seen in the hottest weather wearing a tweed suit, a thick tweed greatcoat, and a hat. His eyes were expressive, witty, and sharply observant.<br>
<br>Collins was present at the opening of the retrospective exhibition of his work at the Tate Gallery in May 1989 and died shortly afterwards in the London Clinic on 4 June 1989. He was buried in Highgate cemetery. He had been appointed MBE in 1979 and elected RA in 1988. A man of deep metaphysical interests, and with a scholar's analytical mind, he was regarded by some as Britain's greatest visionary artist since William Blake.<br>
<br>Collins's wife, <a name="cosubject_73728"></a><span class="headword">Elisabeth Ward Collins <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Ramsden]</span></span>  (1904&#150;2000), <span class="occ">painter and sculptor</span>, was born on 31 October 1904 in Halifax, Yorkshire, the eldest child of Clifford Ramsden, editor and proprietor of the <span class="italic">Halifax Courier and Guardian</span>, and his wife, Nellie, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Ward, an amateur concert pianist from Charleston, West Virginia. Despite initial parental reluctance&#151;she later said that she had &#145;had a terrible row with my family&#151;they had expected me to stay at home and do the flowers!&#146;  (Collins, Hyman, and Lane)&#151;she trained at Leeds School of Art and the Royal College of Art, London. After her marriage to Collins she devoted much of her life to encouraging and supporting him, but she also continued to paint, initially exhibiting her gouache paintings under the name Belmont to keep her work independent of Collins's growing reputation. Radiant, friendly, spontaneous, and enthusiastic, Elisabeth Collins was tall, slender, latterly frail, and elegant in an old-fashioned quasi-Bohemian style with big hats and flowing dresses and scarves. Her art, influenced by Redon and Chagall, was magical, visionary, and charming, depicting a colourful dreamlike world described by one critic as from &#145;the Eastern European fairy-tale province of her imagination&#146;  (<span class="italic">Independent</span>, 8 Feb 2000). After Collins's death she used his studio and produced a substantial number of small gouache paintings. Her exhibition at England &amp; Co. in 1996 led to the Tate's acquiring four of her paintings. Although she told interviewers in 1999 that she would never describe herself as a Christian, latterly she was drawn to the rites of the Russian Orthodox church. She died on 17 January 2000 in London, and her funeral was at the Orthodox church in Knightsbridge, London.<br>
