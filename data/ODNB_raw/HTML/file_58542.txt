<span class="headword">Warren,  Edward Perry</span>  (1860&#150;1928), <span class="occ">art collector</span>, was born at Waltham, Massachusetts, on 8 June 1860. He was one of five children of Samuel Dennis Warren (1817&#150;1888) and his wife, Susan Cornelia, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Clarke (1825&#150;1901). Samuel Warren, a descendant of modest farmers who came from England in the seventeenth century, worked his way from office boy to partner in a Boston paper making firm. Later he acquired his own company, and by the time Edward Perry Warren was born he was well on his way to becoming a millionaire.<br>
<br>After attending Phillips grammar school and Hopkinson School, both in Boston, Warren, known to friends as Ned, followed his oldest brother, Sam, to Harvard but was not happy there. From childhood he was introverted and his mother maintained that he was &#145;more nervous than the other children&#146;  (Sox, 3). On receiving his AB from Harvard (1883), he determined to spend the rest of his life abroad. In 1883 he matriculated at New College, Oxford, where he obtained a first class in classical moderations in 1885 but was prevented by ill health from taking the final honour school. However, he graduated BA with a pass degree in 1888.<br>
<br>Warren thrived in the environment of Oxford, where unlike Harvard he &#145;found people who did not damn my ideas as incorrect, but, on the contrary, found them interesting&#146;  (Sox, 15). At New College he met his lifelong partner, John Marshall (1862&#150;1928), who was from Liverpool. He also met a number of like-minded young men who became friends and associates in collecting antiquities. Among them was Bernard Berenson, who was visiting Europe; Warren gave him financial assistance, making it possible for Berenson to begin his long career as an art connoisseur. Later, in 1911, Warren was made an honorary fellow of Corpus Christi College, Oxford, in recognition of his intention to bequeath to the college an endowment to revive its praelectorship of Greek. As a result, the college's first E. P. Warren praelectorship in classics, with a specific commitment to teaching Greek, was appointed in 1954, and has strengthened the college's classical resources ever since.<br>
<br>In 1890, two years after the death of his father, Warren was able to lease Lewes House, a large Georgian residence in the Sussex market town of Lewes which became the focal point of his enterprises. There with Warren lived Marshall and six other young men. It was described by William Rothenstein, a frequent visitor, as &#145;a monkish establishment where women were not welcomed. But Warren, who believed that scholars should live nobly, kept an ample table and a well-stocked wine-cellar &hellip;&#146;  (W. Rothenstein, <span class="italic">Men and Memories: Recollections, 1872&#150;1900</span>, 1931, 1.343, quoted in Sox, 45). Rothenstein also added that a &#145;secrecy seemed to permeate the rooms and corridors, to exhaust the air of the house. The social relations, too, were often strained &hellip;&#146;.<br>
<br>Everything at Lewes House was shared, be it a walking stick, or the tub, where guests bathed <i>&agrave; l'antique</i> after an afternoon on horseback. Warren managed the establishment like a tiny German court: he took upon himself all the concerns of both his companions and his household staff. Matthew Stewart Prichard, the most able&#151;and eccentric&#151;of his friends, said that Warren was &#145;a sort of Buddha to consult upon everything&#146;  (Sox, 47). There was little interest in the outside world: newspapers were rarely read; neighbours never called&#151;not even the vicar. Prichard's brother-in-law, T. H. Lyon, commented that it was &#145;an attempt to live again under a paganism long since dead &hellip; charged with something very like make-believe&#146;  (ibid., 172).<br>
<br>The great collecting centred at Lewes House was at its height in the 1890s. It was so successful that Alexander Murray of the British Museum complained that there was &#145;nothing to be got nowadays&#146; as the Lewes House collectors were &#145;always on the spot first&#146;  (Burdett and Goddard, 79). The Boston Museum of Fine Arts received the lion's share of treasures, including the celebrated Chios head which Rodin coveted. Rodin was to create a version of <span class="italic">The Kiss</span> to suit Warren's specific requirements. It came later to the Tate. At the Ashmolean in Oxford is a treasure of Warren's, what has been described as one of the most perfect fifth-century <span class="smallcap">BC</span> bronze heads. An <span class="italic">Adam and Eve</span> by Cranach and a large tondo by Filippino Lippi, both of which used to grace the dining-room of Lewes House, are now respectively at the Courtauld Institute in London and the Cleveland Museum. In 1999 one of his most prized&#151;and unusual&#151;treasures surfaced from a private collection: a first-century <span class="smallcap">AD</span> Roman silver cup displaying homosexual love-making. It was purchased by the British Museum for &pound;1.8 million.<br>
<br>After twelve years the Lewes House brotherhood started to break up. As John Fothergill, one of the companions&#151;later famous as an innkeeping diarist&#151;wrote:<blockquote>The whole thing was too comfortable and all-providing &hellip; When any of us went to London which we never did save on business, there was the petty cash box in an open drawer in the bureau. We had only to dip into a heap of sovereigns &hellip; I confess I thought this proceeding too horribly heavenly &hellip; Yet &hellip; we never felt secure at home against sudden departures to Italy and Greece. (Sox, 153)</blockquote>Prichard was the first to leave; in 1901 he went to Boston to work at the museum. The most devastating blow came in November 1907 when Marshall married Warren's spinster cousin, Mary Bliss, and they moved to Rome. For long Marshall had been stationed there alone and the marriage was more an act of spite than of romance. Warren was left alone in Lewes with a boy he had mysteriously adopted.<br>
<br>Despite the rejection, Warren made it possible for the Marshalls to live in a sumptuous flat overlooking the Spanish Steps. Marshall became associated with the Metropolitan Museum in New York and purchased a number of antiquities for them. However, among the treasures were some spectacular fakes; most notably three &#145;Etruscan&#146; warriors which were not formally recognized as fakes until 1961.<br>
<br>Mary Marshall died in 1925, and for the remaining three years of their lives Warren and Marshall were re-united. Marshall exhausted himself trying to track down the creator of several archaic Greek forgeries. In Frankfurt he became seriously ill and he died within two days of returning to Rome. Warren, who was with him, willed himself to die. His death, later in the same year, on 28 December 1928, at the Cambridge House Nursing Home, 4 Dorset Square, London, followed an abdominal operation in London.<br>
<br>Warren was cremated on 1 January 1929 and his ashes were taken to Bagni di Lucca in Italy where they were placed with Marshall's remains. At the English cemetery a simple monument was created topped appropriately with a Grecian urn.<br>
<br>Under the <i>nom de plume</i> Arthur Lyon Raile, Warren wrote a number of works, most notably <span class="italic">The Defence of Uranian Love</span> (3 vols., 1928&#150;30), and a collection of poems, <span class="italic">The Wild Rose</span> (1910). But his most lasting achievements were the extraordinary antiquities and works of art which today can be seen as far afield as London, Oxford, Leipzig, Boston, and Bowdoin College in Maine.<br>
