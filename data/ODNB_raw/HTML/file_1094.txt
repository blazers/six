<span class="headword">Finch, Sir  John</span>  (1626&#150;1682), <span class="occ">physician and diplomat</span>, was the fourth of the seven children, and the youngest son, of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9432/', "Sir Heneage Finch (1580&#150;1631)")</script>, and his first wife, Frances, daughter of Sir Edmund Bell. His mother died in 1627. His father, speaker of the House of Commons, died before the birth of the second child from his second marriage, to Elizabeth Cradock. John Finch was brother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9433/', "Heneage Finch (1621&#150;1682)")</script>, subsequently lord chancellor and first earl of Nottingham. He was particularly close to his half-sister, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6119/', "Anne Conway, Viscountess Conway and Killultagh (1631&#150;1679)")</script>, whose interest in philosophy he encouraged.<br>
<br>After schooling at Eton College, Finch was admitted to the Inner Temple in 1642. In the same year he commenced his studies at Balliol College, Oxford. He was admitted pensioner of Christ's College, Cambridge, in 1645, under Mr Potts. Returning to Balliol, he graduated BA there in 1647. In the same year he was incorporated at Christ's College, Cambridge, graduating MA in 1649. At Christ's College he came under the influence of Henry More, and became friends with Thomas Baines, who was to remain his constant companion for the rest of his life. In 1651 Finch and Baines set out together to study medicine at Padua, where they studied with Antonio Molinetti, graduating MD in 1657. Finch was elected pro-rector and syndic at the University of Padua in 1656. While in Italy, he became a member of the scientific circle of Prince (later Cardinal) Leopoldo de' Medici, patron of the Accademia del Cimento. From 1659 until 1665 he held the post of professor of anatomy at Pisa.<br>
<br>On his return to England in 1661 Finch took his MD at Cambridge <i>in absentia</i> (his proxy was Dr Carr). In the same year he was knighted and elected &#145;socius extraordinarius&#146; of the Royal College of Physicians. In 1663 he was elected fellow of the Royal Society, having been one of the original supporters of the foundation of the society in 1660. In 1662 he returned to Italy via the Netherlands, and was appointed English resident at Florence in 1665. In 1665 he supervised the Italian tour by his nephew Daniel Finch, and remained in close contact with him thereafter.<br>
<br>While in Italy, Finch travelled to Rome and Naples. Known in Florence as Giovanni Fink, he was distinguished as an anatomist. He performed dissections and demonstrations at the Arcispedale of Santa Maria Novella with such distinguished men as Tilman Trutwijn, Nils Stensen, Francesco Redi, and Stephano Lorenzini. To judge by his letters to Leopoldo de' Medici, Finch had a special interest in the anatomy of the brain. He introduced Leopoldo to the works of Thomas Willis, and conducted investigations of, among other things, the torpedo fish (which brought him into controversy with G. A. Borelli), and vipers. His letters to his sister, Anne Conway, and to Cardinal Leopoldo de' Medici, as well as his notebooks and diary, show that throughout his life he practised as a gentleman scientist or virtuoso, observing and recording natural phenomena, proposing explanations for them, and commenting on the theories of others.<br>
<br>In 1672 Finch was appointed ambassador to the Ottoman court, succeeding his cousin Heneage Finch, second earl of Winchilsea (<i>d</i>. 1689). He set out for Constantinople in 1673, via Italy, accompanied by Thomas Baines. He arrived there in 1674, returning to England in 1681, after the death of Baines. The most important achievement of his embassy was securing confirmation of the privileges for English merchants trading in the Ottoman empire, for which purpose Finch journeyed to Adrianople in 1675. Finch was correspondent of the Royal Society while in Italy and Turkey. He was also an art collector: he commissioned and collected some sixty paintings, including four by Carlo Dolci. He died of pleurisy on 18 November 1682 after his return to England.<br>
<br>Finch published nothing of importance, but left behind him on his death a large manuscript treatise, evidently prepared for publication, but misattributed to his nephew when the manuscripts were catalogued in 1939. This is a treatise of natural philosophy, which incorporates cultural observations based on his experiences. In it he propounds a materialist view of the natural world and a sense-based epistemology. On both subjects he opposes both Descartes and his teacher Henry More. Along with other letters and papers, including some poems, this manuscript is held at Leicestershire Record Office. The major part of Finch's library, bequeathed to his nephew Daniel Finch, was destroyed in a fire at Burley House.<br>
<br>In a &#145;Dedication&#146; among his papers, Finch records his deep affection for his lifelong friend, Sir Thomas Baines, whom he met at Cambridge about 1647. <a name="cosubject_1094"></a><span class="headword">Sir Thomas Baines</span>  (1622<span class="mult">x</span>4&#150;1680), <span class="occ">physician</span>, was one of the seven children of Richard Baines. Educated at Bishop's Stortford School, Hertfordshire, he was admitted pensioner at Christ's College, Cambridge, on 5 October 1638. He studied first with Robert Gell and later with Henry More, proceeding BA in 1643 and MA 1649. Thereafter his biography coincides with that of Finch. Like Finch, he qualified MD at Padua in 1657, and took his MD at Cambridge by proxy (his proxy being Johannes Gostlin) in 1660. He, too, supported moves to found the Royal Society and was elected extraordinary fellow of the Royal College of Physicians in 1661. He was appointed professor of music at Gresham College in 1660, and held this post until his death. Baines does not appear to have practised as a physician, though he was consulted on a personal basis by members of the Finch and Conway families. Like Sir John Finch, he appears to have led the life of a virtuoso. He published nothing, but left a number of unpublished papers, which are preserved in the Finch family archive. He accompanied Finch as physician on his diplomatic missions to Tuscany and Turkey. He was knighted some time before 1672. He died of a &#145;malignant feaver&#146; at Constantinople on 5 September 1680. His vitals were interred in the English cemetery there, and his embalmed body was taken back to England for burial in Christ's College chapel. Finch was buried in the same grave two years later. Finch and Baines jointly founded two fellowships and two scholarships at Christ's College, Cambridge, each contributing &pound;2000 for this purpose. A memorial commissioned from Joseph Cattens was erected there in 1684, with an encomium from Henry More celebrating the lifelong friendship of the two men.<br>
