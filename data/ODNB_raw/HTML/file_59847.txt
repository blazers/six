<span class="headword">Cely <span class="st"> [Sely]</span> family</span>  (<em>per. </em><em>c.</em>1450&#150;<em>c.</em>1500), <span class="occ">merchants</span>, of London, are famous particularly because of the unique collection of letters written by family members (preserved in the Public Record Office, London) as a result of the case in chancery between the younger Richard Cely and the widow of his brother George; these provide an exceptionally intimate picture of late fifteenth-century family and business life. The Celys were typical staplers, carrying on a business of moderate size, though they were among the larger rather than smaller exporters of wool. Most of their exports were Cotswold fleeces or fells, brought on pack-horses or wagons to London, and then shipped overseas to Calais. There they were sold to visiting buyers from the Low Countries, preferably for cash, often for delayed payments. The trade at Calais, which was their main concern, also involved the Celys in visits to Bruges and the marts at Antwerp and Bergen op Zoom, which were frequented by English mercers acting as importers, and where it was possible to buy foreign goods and also to carry out exchanges between English and Netherlandish currencies. The Celys were therefore involved in a good deal of travel on the other side of the channel, and in a very complicated international trading system, which required expert knowledge of types of wool and currency values, as well as attention to the rules of the Calais staple. They themselves were commonly divided between London, from where business was controlled, and Calais, where the wool was received and sold to foreign buyers.<br>
<br>The elder <a name="cosubject_59845"></a><span class="headword">Richard Cely</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1482)<span class="occ"></span> is first mentioned in 1449, when he was already a substantial stapler and was one of a group lending 2000 marks for the support of the Calais garrison. He was married to Agnes Andrew of Adderbury, Oxfordshire, the sister of Richard Andrew, secretary to Henry VI, dean of York, and first warden of All Souls College, Oxford. This established an ecclesiastical link which had some importance for his sons. His brother John was also a stapler. In 1455 Richard was in a group of leading staplers indenting with the victualler of Calais, and in 1460 he was accused, with other staplers, of helping the mayor of the staple to seize wool. In 1461 and 1474 he was joint constable at Calais. In 1481 he was an unsuccessful candidate for election as sheriff of London. He died in January 1482. The family correspondence suggests that he had been a careful, rather irritable businessman, evidently quite successful. His wife, Agnes, died a year later in January 1483, leaving to her son Robert money to be used as trading capital.<br>
<br>Richard and Agnes had three sons, Robert, Richard, and George. <a name="cosubject_59846"></a><span class="headword">Robert Cely</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1485)<span class="occ"></span>, the eldest, seems to have been a rather unsatisfactory person, devoted to good living, often in debt, and casual about the business. He was a stapler by 1474&#150;5 and also married. There are reports of his buying hawks and horses and holding dinner parties at Calais. In 1478 he was in debt at Calais, and his brother Richard appears to have threatened to imprison him. His wife, whose name is unknown, and his child died in 1479. After his wife's death he was betrothed in 1480 to a lady named Joan Hart, but quickly quarrelled with her. He fled to Calais, but she sued for breach of promise, and he was compelled to flee further, to Bruges, to escape the ecclesiastical jurisdiction of Canterbury. A settlement was made with her by Robert's father and brothers. Back in London he fell sick and was in need of money, and apparently ceased to be a stapler. In 1484 he made a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela; he died in February of the following year.<br>
<br>The younger <a name="cosubject_59847"></a><span class="headword">Richard Cely</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1493)<span class="occ"></span>, the second son, was the effective manager of the business after his father's death. He established a partnership with his brother George in 1476 which lasted until George's death. He was patronized by Sir John Weston, the prior of the order of St John of Jerusalem in England, with whom he may have been acquainted because of the Andrew connection. He accompanied Sir John on an embassy to the French court in 1480, and on a trip to Gravesend to meet Margaret of Burgundy. In 1482 he was apparently wooing Elizabeth Limerick convivially at Northleach, but in the same year he in fact made an advantageous marriage with Anne, daughter of Richard Rawson, an alderman of London, who brought a dower of 500 marks. In 1486 Richard and George, together with William Maryon, bought a ship from a Breton, which they renamed the <i>Margaret Cely</i>; she was used to carry grain exported to the Low Countries and wool to Calais, and to import wine from Bordeaux. Richard was his father's executor, and usually remained in England, handling the purchase of wool in the Cotswolds and its dispatch abroad. After the death of his brother George in 1489 he tried to obtain repayment of debts owed to them jointly. He died, however, on 5 July 1493, fairly heavily in debt to his wife's family. He left three daughters, Margaret, Isabel, and Barbara. His widow married Walter Frost of West Ham and lived until 1527.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_59848"></a><span class="headword">George Cely</span>  (<em>c.</em>1458&#150;1489)<span class="occ"></span>, the third son, appears from his surviving letters to have been an amiable person, and a rather casual and free writer. He is first mentioned in the records in 1472 as buying clothes in London. In 1474 he was learning music from a harpist at Calais, how to play &#145;Mine Heart's Lust&#146; and &#145;O Freshest Flower&#146;. In 1478 he was with the other two brothers in an excursion from Calais to Boulogne. In 1479 George appears to have been enjoying a love affair with a French lady at Calais, but later in the same year he fell seriously ill at Bruges, causing his relatives some anxiety. In 1482 he moved to London, remaining Richard's partner, and about 18 May 1484 married Margery, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Punt, the childless widow of Edmund Rygon, a prosperous draper; it was probably a very favourable match. George lived at Mark Lane, London. He died in 1489, leaving four sons, Richard, Avery, George, and John, and his wife pregnant with a fifth, Edmund. His widow married Sir John Haleghwell. There was afterwards a good deal of litigation between the widows Anne and Margery Cely and their new husbands, about the finances of the brothers Richard and George and lands that they had acquired, principally in Essex.<br>
