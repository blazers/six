<span class="headword">Loring,  Frederick George</span>  (1869&#150;1951), <span class="occ">naval officer and wireless expert</span>, was born on 11 March 1869 at Stonelands, Ryde, Isle of Wight, the eldest son of Admiral Sir William Loring (<i>d</i>. 1895), and his wife, Frances Louisa Adams. From a naval family&#151;his grandfather <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17018/', "Sir John Wentworth Loring (1775&#150;1852)")</script> was lieutenant-governor of the Royal Naval College, Portsmouth, 1819&#150;37&#151;Loring was destined for the Royal Navy. He entered <i>Britannia</i> in July 1882 as a naval cadet, going out to Australia as a midshipman. As a sub-lieutenant he served in the royal yacht, <i>Victoria and Albert</i>, in 1891 and was promoted lieutenant on 1 September 1891. He was a lieutenant in HMS <i>Victoria</i> when she was rammed and sunk by <i>Camperdown</i> off Tripoli on 22 June 1893 with terrible loss of life. Loring was awarded a bronze medal by the Royal Humane Society for saving two lives.<br>
<br>Loring undertook the long torpedo course at HMS <i>Vernon</i> in 1894, qualifying as a torpedo lieutenant in 1896. The same year he married Charlotte Elizabeth Arbuthnot (1862&#150;1933), daughter of the Hon. James Edward Arbuthnot of Mauritius; they had two daughters, Evelyn Frances and Iris. Loring joined the staff of <i>Defiance</i>, the torpedo school at Devonport, where Captain Henry Jackson was experimenting with wireless telegraphy for naval purposes. Loring was one of the first to specialize in wireless telegraphy, becoming one of the navy's leading wireless experts. He served in the fleet during 1900&#150;02 and from 1902 was in charge of the Admiralty shore wireless stations. Loring was selected to accompany Guglielmo Marconi to America in 1904 for wireless experiments, and in 1906 he was the Admiralty representative at the second International Wireless Telegraphy Conference at Berlin. In the same year he was elected as a member of the Institution of Electrical Engineers.<br>
<br>Although specially recommended for promotion, Loring was found to be unfit for further sea service, but permission was given for him to accept the appointment as inspector of wireless telegraphy under the Post Office from 1 July 1908. He received an expression of the Admiralty's appreciation of his services in charge of war signal and wireless telegraphy stations and finally retired from the Royal Navy at his own request with the rank of commander in December 1909. In 1914 Loring was released from liability for naval service, but refused further promotion.<br>
<br>Loring remained as inspector of wireless telegraphy at the Post Office, responsible for the operating staff, until 1930, and represented the Post Office at the international radio-telegraphy conferences at London in 1912 and Washington in 1927. He also acted as an assessor for wireless telegraphy for the Board of Trade, attending the safety at sea conferences in London in 1914 and 1929. Appointed a civil OBE in 1926 for his services to the development of radio, Loring retired from the Post Office in January 1930. He joined the International Marine Radio Company, of which he later became a director, and represented that company at the conferences in Copenhagen in 1931, Madrid in 1932, Lisbon in 1934, Bucharest in 1937, Cairo in 1938, and Stockholm in 1948. He finally retired from the company in 1950, having devoted over fifty years of his life to the interests of maritime radio. In 1949 he married Margaret Mackenzie, daughter of Montague S. Napier.<br>
<br>Apart from his many naval and technical interests Loring had a distinct literary bent. In his early days at sea he wrote for a naval technical journal, and was the naval correspondent for the <span class="italic">Western Morning News</span>. He also wrote poems and short stories, one of which, &#145;The Tomb of Sarah&#146;, achieved considerable success. He was co-author of a paper, &#145;A survey of marine radio progress, with special reference to RMS <i>Queen Mary</i>&#146;, published in the Institution of Electrical Engineers' <span class="italic">Journal</span> in 1937. Loring died of cardiac failure at his home, the Old House, Footscray, Sidcup, Kent, on 7 September 1951, aged eighty-two.<br>
