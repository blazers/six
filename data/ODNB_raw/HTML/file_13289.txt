<span class="headword">Hill,  Richard</span>  (1655/6&#150;1727), <span class="occ">diplomat and public servant</span>, was born at Hawkstone, Shropshire, and baptized at Hodnet on 23 March 1656, the second son of Rowland Hill (<i>bap</i>. 1623?) of Hawkstone and his wife, Margaret Whitehall of Doddington, Shropshire. From Shrewsbury School, Hill was admitted on 18 June 1675, aged nineteen, to St John's College, Cambridge, where he graduated BA in 1679, proceeded MA in 1682, was ordained deacon, and was a fellow between 1679 and 1692. He served as a tutor to the Burlington family and then to that of Laurence Hyde, first earl of Rochester and lord president of the council, who advanced his career. A meeting with Richard Jones, earl of Ranelagh, paymaster-general to the army, led to his appointment as Ranelagh's deputy in Flanders. His financial skill both saved him from the disgrace that was Ranelagh's lot and helped him amass a large fortune. His father is reported to have said: &#145;My son Dick makes money very fast: God send that he gets it honestly&#146;  (Blakeway, 181). A moderate tory, he was distrusted by his whig employers, as the Marlboroughs' and Godolphin's correspondence displays. Speaker Richard Onslow held that his wealth &#145;was all acquired by himself &hellip; without any reproach as to the means of it that I ever heard of&#146;  (Burnet, 4.318).<br>
<br>Hill held office in England as a lord of the Treasury from 1699 to 1702 and a lord of the Admiralty from 1702 to 1708, but his most notable service was on the continent. In 1696 he was sent to Brussels as envoy, and William III, whom he admired greatly, sent him to Turin in 1699 to congratulate Victor Amadeus II, duke of Savoy, and his duchess, respectively second and first cousins of both William and Mary, on the birth of an heir. He had little taste for the envoy's life abroad, complaining that &#145;there is neither beef, nor veal, nor mutton which an Englishman can eat&#146;  (M. Lane, <span class="italic">The Nineteenth Century</span>, 1927, 562), but his &#145;clear parts, &hellip; his easy access and affable way&#146;, as well as his being &#145;a favourite with both parties&#146;  (<span class="italic">Memoirs of the Secret Services</span>, 145) fitted him for diplomatic life. According to a 1720 dedication to William Robinson, bishop of London, who had been lord privy seal, William III &#145;did often declare that he had never employed two ministers of greater vigilance, capacity and virtue than yourself, my Lord, and the Reverend Mr Hill&#146;  (Wheatly). In 1703 Queen Anne sent him again to Turin, via The Hague, where he laid his plans with the Dutch to bring the duke of Savoy into the War of the Spanish Succession against Louis XIV.<br>
<br>Victor Amadeus's duchy, caught between France and the empire, would be put at risk in a war, but war also presented the prospect of repossessing territory lost earlier to the French. The duke had previously proved an unreliable ally, deserting the allies in 1696, and Hill and his Dutch colleague worked hard and at last successfully to gain the full commitment of a ruler who was &#145;a very absolute Prince and will have everything his own way&#146;  (<span class="italic">Diplomatic Correspondence</span>, 1.315). England's subsidy to the duchy was agreed at last, and &#145;wee were a little out of humour, the Envoy of Holland and myself, to come so far and make so ill a bargain for so much money&#146;  (<span class="italic">Diplomatic Correspondence</span>, 1.316), but Victor Amadeus then made a further demand, forcing Hill's reluctant agreement&#151;at a price. Nottingham, Hill's chief, and Marlborough favoured taking advantage of the diversion provided by the Camisard revolt in the C&eacute;vennes to mount an invasion of France from Piedmont, with Huguenot refugees and former Vaudois insurgents to be recruited, and with Sir Cloudesley Shovell's fleet in support. Hill constantly argued against the scheme, as is evident from his very full correspondence, more than 600 letters copied and put in order in his retirement. Hill was his own man and risked offending even Marlborough. He said of De Miremont, the Huguenot general sent from England, that &#145;he knows no more of what is doing in the C&eacute;vennes than the post-man does&#146;  (<span class="italic">Diplomatic Correspondence</span>, 1.351). His scepticism was vindicated by the failure of his planned diversion on the French coast to help the Catalans, in which the four frigates at his disposal (&#145;my little fleet&#146;) took part, the Camisard element having lost heart at rumours of their leader Cavalier's peacemaking  (<span class="italic">Diplomatic Correspondence</span>, 1.343&#150;87). When he asked later for the ambassadorship to The Hague another was appointed who, wrote Godolphin, &#145;will have no whimseys of his own but will be sure to follow your [Marlborough's] instructions&#146;  (Snyder, 2.146).<br>
<br>Hill placed the greatest importance on the lowest rated of his instructions. He was &#145;to give your best attention to the Vaudois &hellip; to let them know your willingness to intercede for them&#146; and &#145;very earnestly to press the Duke to revoke all such edicts as have lately been made against them&#146;  (<span class="italic">Diplomatic Correspondence</span>, 1.4). The Vaudois, a medieval heretic sect, later protestants, who had suffered centuries of persecution by the dukes of Savoy, were guaranteed toleration by a secret clause of the 1690 treaty, and in 1696 by an edict which had become a dead letter by the duke's abrogation of the treaty. Hill made it his business to gain reaffirmation of this clause in the new treaty, thus making the allies guarantors for the Vaudois. After many disappointments he made the granting of the extra subsidy demanded by the duke conditional on &#145;the liberty of conscience of the Vaudois, which I do demand&#146;  (<span class="italic">Diplomatic Correspondence</span>, 1.389). In recognition of this and of the funds he collected in England and the benefits he gained for them the Vaudois pastors placed him &#145;at the head of our Nehemiahs&#146;  (<span class="italic">Diplomatic Correspondence</span>, 2.973). In retirement he continued to serve the Vaudois, conveying funds to them until the 1720s. The Vaudois link survived his death for a century or more: in 1825 by order of the House of Commons the 1690 and 1704 treaties were printed in order to hold the allies of the time to their duty to protect the Vaudois, who were again under threat.<br>
<br>Hill's bid for The Hague ambassadorship having failed he was given a final appointment to Brussels but withdrew. His health was bad and, as he had inscribed on his marble monument in Hodnet church, he was <i>militiae fessus et viarum</i> (&#145;tired with war and travel&#146;). In his three-quarter-length portrait he looks haggard, especially compared with an earlier oval study. He lived quietly as tenant at Cleveland House, St James's, and in his own house at the Old Palace, Richmond, where &#145;he was much resorted to by the most eminent persons of the time [and] the Royal family shewed him very particular regards&#146;  (Burnet, 4.318). He refused a bishopric in hope of that of Ely, which was not realized, and became a fellow of the Royal Society, DCL of Oxford (1708), and fellow of Eton College (1714), where he enjoyed his own chambers. Arthur Onslow, who knew Hill, found that his letters &#145;proved him to have been a very considerable person, and made for higher stations than he arrived to&#146;  (Burnet, 4.318). For want of such stations he devoted his great wealth to consolidating the family's Shropshire estates and to providing from them for three nephews, especially Rowland Hill (1705&#150;1783), later father of Richard Hill (1732&#150;1808) and Rowland Hill (1744&#150;1833). He rebuilt Hawkstone to his own design but Attingham Park later became the Hills' grandest seat. Hill died on 11 June 1727 at Richmond and was buried in the family vault at St Luke's Church, Hodnet. The Vaudois, who have survived and prospered, remember and honour him.<br>
