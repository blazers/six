<span class="headword">Shelley, Sir  William</span>  (1478/9&#150;1549), <span class="occ">lawyer</span>, was the son of John Shelley (1456&#150;1527), a member of a family of London mercers and aldermen, and his wife, Elizabeth (1460&#150;1513), the posthumous daughter of John Faulconer, otherwise Michelgrove, of Clapham in Sussex. His younger sister, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/104416/', "Elizabeth Shelley")</script>, was abbess of St Mary's, Winchester, between 1527 and 1539. The Shelleys were rumoured to be the abbot of Waltham's bondmen of a manor near Ware, Hertfordshire, and in 1467 Sir William's grandfather John Shelley, soon to be sheriff of London, broke the head of a fellow mercer who had called him a churl. Although later generations would claim a more elevated pedigree, the origins of the Shelleys should be sought among the Hertfordshire peasantry. In 1474 John Shelley joined the Sussex gentry by marriage to Elizabeth Michelgrove, a close relative of John Ernley, the future attorney-general. Probably a member of the Inner Temple, Shelley sat as MP for Horsham in 1491&#150;2. William Shelley was admitted to the same inn at some point between 1500 and July 1502.<br>
<br>Probably about 1498 William Shelley married Alice (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1481, <i>d</i>. in or before 1537), the daughter of Harry Belknap (<i>d</i>. 1488) of Knelle in Beckley near Rye in Sussex. He acquired as brothers-in-law the courtier and soldier Sir Edward Belknap (1470&#150;1521) and John Caryll (<i>d</i>. 1523) of the Inner Temple, with whom he or his father shared chambers. In 1512 Shelley took his father's place on the Sussex bench. He failed to become solicitor to the Merchant Adventurers but was appointed recorder of Coventry, where Belknap had influence; his predecessor Anthony Fitzherbert described him as &#145;a gentleman of good conscience and well learned in the law&#146;  (HoP, <span class="italic">Commons, 1509&#150;58</span>, 3.310). He joined Thomas More as an under-sheriff of London in June 1514 and resigned his office at Coventry the following year having found, like Fitzherbert before him, the residence requirement too onerous. As under-sheriff Shelley was a permanent legal official, advising the sheriffs and sitting as a judge in the weekly sheriffs' court. In 1520 Shelley succeeded Richard Broke as recorder, and represented the city in the parliament of 1523. He conducted delicate negotiations with the crown concerning city offices, loans, and the disarming of the Londoners following the execution in 1521 of the duke of Buckingham, who had been indicted before him at the Guildhall.<br>
<br>Plague forced the postponement of Shelley's reading in the autumn of 1517 until the following Lent. He was not included in the serjeants' call of December 1520, but in April received the king's letter to replace Baldwin Malet, who had used his influence to obtain a discharge. Shelley, too late to prepare his serjeant's reading, took the degree at Ely House on 29 or 30 June 1521. When in London, of which he remained recorder, Shelley lived in St Sepulchre, Holborn, where in 1523 he was assessed for &pound;133 in goods; his lands, worth &pound;140 a year, consisted largely of the fourth share of the Belknap estate which he had inherited in 1521. In January 1526 he was passed over as chief baron of the exchequer, an office for which the recordership was often a prelude, but by 17 November had been appointed to Fitzherbert's place as fourth justice of the court of common pleas; for the next seven years he rode the western assize circuit as junior justice to Sir John Fitzjames. Shelley succeeded to his father's estates in January 1527, at the age of forty-eight, and by 1534 had rebuilt Michelgrove as one of the finest houses in Sussex. He entertained the king, who subsequently told Shelley's son of the &#145;great cheer&#146; he had had there. From 1529 until his death he was personally summoned to parliament by writ of assistance; he remained an active member of the Sussex bench, which he chaired as <i>custos rotulorum</i> from before 1532.<br>
<br>Shelley's office of recorder of London involved frequent attendance on Thomas Wolsey, and it is clear that a friendship developed between the two men. Shelley advised Wolsey on the foundation of Cardinal College, and took the surrenders of several of the smaller houses dissolved for its creation in 1526. On Wolsey's fall, and perhaps as a test of his loyalty, Shelley was sent to Esher to receive possession of York Place, the archbishop's Westminster palace, for the king. According to George Cavendish, after an ironic interrogation of the judge on the conflict of law and conscience, the cardinal closed their interview by charging Shelley with the unenviable task of reminding Henry &#145;that there is both heaven and hell&#146;  (Cavendish, 119). York Place was to become Whitehall Palace, and Shelley was to be knighted there between 20 June and 24 November 1530. He seems to have respected Wolsey's subsequent entreaty &#145;for the old amity and love that hath been betwixt us and for that I have used your counsel therein to be good master&#146; to his college  (<span class="italic">LP Henry VIII</span>, 4, 6577), and the marriage of his heir, John Shelley, to the daughter of Wolsey's loyal treasurer William Fitzwilliam of Milton endorses the probability of his close involvement with the cardinal's circle.<br>
<br>While his wealth and landed estate grew, Shelley found himself increasingly out of sympathy with the political and religious changes of the 1530s. In December 1534 his remarks to Fitzherbert about heretical books, and condemnation of the <span class="italic">Supplication</span> of Dr Robert Barnes as &#145;a most detestable book of heresy&#146;  (Elton, 32&#150;3) were reported to the king's council, and for the Lent assize of 1535 he was transferred to the home circuit under the watchful eye of his junior, the attorney-general Christopher Hales. Shelley was one of the quorum in the commissions of 23 April and 1 June for the trials of the Carthusians and of John Fisher, bishop of Rochester, but was omitted from that of 26 June for the trial of Sir Thomas More. He had been among the judges who upheld the will of Baron Dacre of the South early in the month but was absent, pleading sickness, at the crucial second meeting when the majority gave way to Thomas Cromwell and reversed their opinion in favour of the king's fiscal strategy. Shelley was dropped from the summer assize of 1535, when the judges were given specific instructions to publicize the supreme headship and the exemplary executions of Fisher and More; he was not commissioned again for almost a decade.<br>
<br>Richard Shelley remembered that in Cromwell's time his father had &#145;passed storms, and with great loss&#146;  (BL, Lansdowne MS 35, fol. 143), and there is evidence of the antagonism of the king's minister, although they had been on good terms before Wolsey's fall. Early in 1537 Cromwell proposed that the crown should purchase the timber on the manor of Knelle in Sussex, valued by Shelley at &pound;2000, but began to treat the transaction as a sale of the lordship itself. &#145;Surely sir&#146;, wrote Sir William Shelley &#145;there was never motion made to me of any sale of the manor but only of the woods and that was by your good lordship&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 1/117, fol. 141). The sale of timber went ahead, and four years later Shelley's woods were still being felled for the king's works at Calais and Camber. Although Cromwell's servants felt able to help themselves to hawks bred by Shelley at Michelgrove, Sir William was sufficiently confident in his own position to ask for several local manors in exchange for Knelle. No attempt was made to remove Shelley from the bench, either at Westminster or in Sussex, where he remained active as an instrument of government policy, investigating a riot by Sir Geoffrey Pole in 1536 and seeking the origin of rumours of the king's death in 1537, when Cromwell sent him to take the surrender of Titchfield Abbey in Hampshire.<br>
<br>According to Richard Shelley, the king finally made much of Sir William Shelley and in 1541, after Cromwell's fall, he was granted two of his manors in Essex; but he was to wait over three years for another assize commission, as the senior judge on the midland circuit. He acted as a receiver of petitions in the Lords in parliaments between 1539 and 1547 and, through the marriages of his son Thomas and daughter Elizabeth to members of the Copley family, seems to have shared effective control over the seat at Gatton in Surrey, of which the Copleys were the only electors. His servant Thomas Bishop of Henfield (who was to marry Edward Belknap's illegitimate daughter) represented the borough in 1542, his nephew Edward Bellingham in 1545, and his son <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25313/', "Richard Shelley (c.1513&#150;1587)")</script> in 1547.<br>
<br>In 1544 Sir William Shelley may have accompanied the king to the siege of Boulogne, where his son Edward Shelley, a master of the household and gentleman of the privy chamber, was lieutenant of the horsemen. Edward was killed leading a cavalry charge at Pinkie in 1547. Sir William Shelley died, probably at Michelgrove, on 4 January 1549, and was buried at Clapham parish church in Sussex; a monument over his grave, depicting him in judicial robes with his wife, seven sons, and seven daughters, was still unfinished eighteen months later. His will, providing for the saying of 100 masses, is further evidence of his religious conservatism, which his descendants would maintain for many generations.<br>
<br>Shelley's judicial experience spanned thirty-three years, and he sat at Westminster for over twenty. But although he enjoyed a longevity that was denied to many of his fellows and remained a loyal servant of the crown, Shelley's less than wholehearted participation in the religious and political changes of the 1530s, his readiness to resist the king in <i>Lord Dacre's case</i> in 1535, and his continued maintenance of the old religion ensured that the highest prizes eluded him.<br>
