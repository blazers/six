<span class="headword">Dick,  William</span>  (1793&#150;1866), <span class="occ">veterinary surgeon and founder of the Edinburgh Veterinary College</span>, was born on 6 May 1793 at Whitehorse Close, Canongate, Edinburgh, the second of three children who survived beyond infancy of John Dick (<i>c</i>.1769&#150;1844), and his wife, Jane (Jean) Anderson (<i>c</i>.1765&#150;1837). His parents had moved to Edinburgh some six years before. At the time of the birth his father, a blacksmith and farrier, had his forge and residence at Whitehorse Close at the lower end of the Royal Mile, which runs from Edinburgh Castle to Holyrood Palace. William Dick himself said that he was born &#145;at the Court end of the Canongate&#146;.<br>
<br>Dick attended two local private schools and afterwards worked with his father in the forge, where he learned about the treatment of diseases of animals that was provided in those days by the farriers. Dick soon formed an ambition to improve the standard of this treatment and to institute some formal training for those offering it. He was &#145;much inclined to get information on literary matters&#146; and took every opportunity he could to hear lectures by a number of university professors. He attended lectures in comparative anatomy by John Barclay (1758&#150;1826), one of Scotland's leading anatomists, and Dick admitted after hearing Barclay that &#145;he had the impudence to think that it was possible that he himself might one day deliver a lecture on veterinary science&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Veterinarian</span>, 403). He contributed much to the discussions which Barclay held following his lectures and in these put to shame some of the young men attending the classes who were preparing to take their medical degrees. It is reported that Barclay, upon being asked who this young man was, admitted that he did not know; when told that he was a &#145;common working blacksmith&#146; he replied &#145;Well, well, all I can say is that, whether he be blacksmith or whitesmith, he's the cleverest chap among you&#146;  (Pringle, iv).<br>
<br>There was then no veterinary education in Scotland but in the autumn of 1817 Dick enrolled at the London Veterinary College, founded in 1791. He took up residence in the capital at 27 Middlesex Street, Somer's Town, from where he kept up a correspondence with his father, describing in detail the cases which he saw in the course of his studies and discussing and criticizing the treatments used. He did not stay long in London because, as he said in later years:<blockquote>finding that it was possible to derive as much knowledge in Edinburgh as would lay the foundation for the successful working out of the scheme which I intently cherished in my mind, I considered it was not necessary to remain longer in the English metropolis. After three months' study there, I had the confidence to apply for a diploma, the time of residence not being then defined, and I obtained it. (<span class="italic">The Veterinarian</span>, 403)</blockquote>After his return to Edinburgh, Dick began to look at how to further his &#145;scheme&#146; for veterinary education in Scotland. Helped by John Barclay, Dick became involved in providing lectures to the public on veterinary matters. He attracted disappointingly small numbers at first but persevered and made arrangements at his own expense to hold classes in the Calton convening rooms in Edinburgh. Barclay continued to help in the furtherance of Dick's ideas and, following discussions with the university senate, had pursued the suggestion that a veterinary college in Edinburgh might be brought about in conjunction with the Highland Society at Edinburgh (later the Royal Highland and Agricultural Society of Scotland) of which he was a director. As a result of this the society agreed that a lecturer to give instruction in veterinary surgery be appointed under its patronage and that Dick should be that lecturer. It was agreed also that the society would provide a sum of &pound;50 to support this, and arrangements were made for Dick to use his father's forge (which was now situated in Clyde Street in Edinburgh) for practical instruction. For several years Dick continued to lecture in the Calton convening rooms, following the first lecture under the auspices of the Highland Society on 24 November 1823.<br>
<br>Dick built up the college in Clyde Street, and, although it was known as the Highland Society's veterinary school and the society provided a small annual sum in support of the establishment, the buildings and facilities were provided entirely at his own expense. For nearly thirty years he was the sole teacher until in 1840 the first clinical assistant was appointed. By 1847 the number of staff had risen to five, but it remained at that level up to the time of Dick's death.<br>
<br>In 1833 Dick joined the editorial team of <span class="italic">The Veterinarian</span>, on which he served until 1845. In 1844 he was closely involved in the petition seeking the granting of the royal charter of incorporation which established the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons on 8 March 1844. In his busy life Dick still found time to be involved in other than veterinary matters in the community. He was a member of the Royal Physical Society of Edinburgh, the oldest scientific society in Scotland, and served as honorary treasurer to that body for fifteen years. As a farrier he belonged to his trade guild and served as deacon of the Hammermen and also, in the period 1835&#150;7, as deacon-convener of trades, in which position he had a seat on the city council. Later, in 1843 and 1844, he was dean of guild and <i>ex officio</i> a member of the city council. Dick also owned property in Burntisland in Fife and at one time was a member of the town council there. He was a justice of the peace in the city of Edinburgh and did one term of office as moderator of the high constables of the city of Edinburgh. He worked for the development of Heriot's Hospital (now George Heriot's School), establishing education for the children of &#145;decayed freemen&#146;, and was involved in the charitable purposes of the Morningside Lunatic Asylum.<br>
<br>William Dick was a sturdily built man, 5 feet 7 inches in height, with a habit of running his fingers through his hair as he lectured. He was a strict disciplinarian, showing no mercy to the idle, but bestowing praise and encouragement wherever it was deserved. He was held in high esteem in the profession. His students often sought his advice after they had qualified and he himself followed their progress closely. He was a man of opinions strongly held and defended. &#145;In political and ecclesiastical matters his views were somewhat extreme, and always expressed with no reserve and some roughness.&#146; He was usually attentive to the opinions of those who differed from him and put forward a &#145;bold and uncompromising advocacy of the people's rights&#146;  (Bradley, 54&#150;5).<br>
<br>William Dick never married. He died from heart disease on 4 April 1866 in his seventy-third year at his home at 15 Clyde Street and was buried on the 11th in the new Calton cemetery within sight of Whitehorse Close, where he was born. He bequeathed his college in trust to the lord provost, magistrates, and council of the city of Edinburgh, and it later formed the faculty of veterinary medicine of the University of Edinburgh. A collection of Dick's writings, entitled <span class="italic">Occasional Papers on Veterinary Subjects</span>, was published in 1869. Following the incorporation of the veterinary college into the University of Edinburgh in 1951, the university court instituted three new chairs in 1953, named respectively the William Dick chair of veterinary surgery, the William Dick chair of veterinary medicine, and the William Dick chair of veterinary hygiene and preventive medicine.<br>
