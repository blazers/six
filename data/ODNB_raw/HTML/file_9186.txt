<span class="headword">Farrant,  Richard</span>  (<em>c.</em>1528&#150;1580), <span class="occ">musician and theatrical producer</span>, is of unknown parentage. An upbringing in the music of the church may be presumed, since he occurs as a lay gentleman of the Chapel Royal by July 1553. He formed a close association with Richard Bower, master of the choristers of the Chapel Royal, and married his daughter Anne (<i>d</i>. in or after 1582). Following Bower's death in 1561 he received probate of his will as proxy for his widow. On 24 April 1564 he resigned his position in the Chapel Royal upon his appointment as master of the choristers of the choir of St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle.<br>
<br>Farrant had been a simple singing-man in the Chapel Royal's choir of thirty-two men and twelve boys, attending daily the full Latin mass and office during Mary's reign and, after June 1559, the three services of the vernacular <span class="roman">Book of Common Prayer</span>. At Windsor he shared the duties of organist with the lay clerk John Marbeck, directed the musical parts of the three daily services sung by the choir of nineteen singing-men and ten boys, and lodged and educated the boys and trained them in all aspects of their musical participation.<br>
<br>Elizabeth I took a delight in being entertained at court with plays and shows at the two principal festal times of year, and from St George's Chapel Farrant emulated the example set by Sebastian Westcott with the choristers of St Paul's Cathedral and by William Hunnis with the Chapel Royal boys. He brought the Windsor choristers to court once a year to present before the queen a play prepared during their spare time in the weeks beforehand. From 1567, the boys performed at court at Shrovetide, transferring in 1572 to the twelve days of Christmas. Farrant received the financial reward of 10 marks, which rose to &pound;10 in 1574.<br>
<br>Meanwhile, as the intensity of the work of the Chapel Royal became increasingly attenuated towards the end of the 1560s it became possible for its personnel to combine membership with parallel appointments elsewhere, and on 5 November 1570 Farrant was readmitted as a gentleman of the Chapel Royal while still retaining his engagement at Windsor. Thereafter he held both offices until his death, dividing his time between the two. At first he lived principally in Windsor, but presently moved to London after making an arrangement with Hunnis under which, as from 25 March 1576, Farrant effectively assumed the mastership of the Chapel Royal choristers in addition to his employment at Windsor. His office at Windsor was mainly carried out by a deputy from then on.<br>
<br>Locating affordable accommodation for the Chapel Royal choristers whenever the sovereign was resident in London or its environs had long been a problem for their master. Farrant embarked upon the creation of a permanent solution, renting with effect from 29 September 1576 suitably capacious premises within the former Dominican friary (the Blackfriars). He advised the landlord that he proposed to use the premises for teaching the Chapel Royal boys; this function the building could not accomplish without providing also for their catering and accommodation.<br>
<br>The boys' musical and liturgical functions in the Chapel Royal and Farrant's pedagogical duties supporting them were the same as, and as demanding as, those at Windsor. However, there still remained spare time to be filled, and on 5 January 1577 Farrant combined his Chapel Royal and Windsor boys in a play at court entitled <span class="italic">The History of Mucius Scaevola</span>. Judging by the generosity of Elizabeth's gratuity, this was an artistic success. Nevertheless, Farrant did not persevere with the daunting logistics of combining two sets of boys based 25 miles apart; thereafter when he presented plays at court it was with only the Chapel Royal boys. He offered one play annually, most commonly during the festivities at Shrovetide.<br>
<br>At Blackfriars Farrant set up that early example of a public theatre for which he is now best remembered. It was located barely 300 yards from the almonry of St Paul's Cathedral, where only a little earlier Westcott had begun to reap financial reward from the plays prepared by his boys for performance at court; he allowed the paying public to watch the dress rehearsals, so creating a makeshift theatre out of the boys' dining hall. At Blackfriars Farrant did the same thing. His lease granted leave to knock two existing rooms into one, probably to create a space sufficiently large to serve as a hall for the boys' teaching, dining, and recreation. Here, admission of the public to performances of the plays also acted at court made of the school hall, suitably adapted for a few weeks of each year, a second private theatre on the western side of the city of London. Farrant's entrepreneurship, like Westcott's, played an important role in developing among the public that appetite for stage plays on which was founded the celebrated achievements of the following generation of playwrights and actors. By 1580 he was building up a repertory, since as well as <span class="italic">The History of Alucius</span>, presented at court on 27 December 1579, his boys performed a comedy at Lincoln's Inn on 9 February 1580.<br>
<br>No texts of any of the fifteen plays known to have been produced by Farrant have survived, and it is not known whether he himself wrote any of them. The titles of six are recorded; these suggest that his interests were primarily in classical history and mythology. All no doubt were replete with the music for solo voice and viols which was the boys' speciality.<br>
<br>Throughout his career Farrant enjoyed opportunities to compose, though little has survived. His two brief anthems for the prayer book service, &#145;Call to remembrance&#146; and &#145;Hide not thou thy face&#146;, match their music to the flow of words with a particular felicity that compensates entirely for the prevailing lack of contrapuntal content. Like the functional <span class="roman">Short Service</span>, these are for four voices, the popularity of all three items being suggested by the large number of pre-Commonwealth copies. Of three non-ecclesiastical vocal pieces, two are stage songs for solo boy's voice and viols. &#145;Oh Jove, from stately throne&#146; was written for the play <span class="italic">King Xerxes</span>, performed at court on 6 January 1575; the other comes from an unidentified play on the story of Panthea and Abradatas. Here the instrumental accompaniment is full of contrapuntal engagement, above which the voice stands out in direct and affecting simplicity. In a similar style, but for domestic use, is the sacred consort song &#145;When as we sat at Babylon&#146;, a setting for solo boy, brief four-part chorus, and viols of a metrical version of <span class="roman">Psalm 137</span>. Eventually this was adapted as a verse anthem with organ for church use.<br>
<br>Farrant made his will on 30 November 1580 and died on the same day. He bequeathed to his wife the family home in Greenwich, responsibility for their ten young children, and the lease of the Blackfriars property. Although Hunnis (who resumed his duties) and the Chapel Royal choristers left in 1582, this was bidding to become a regular theatre by the time a hostile landlord closed it down in 1584. It was not the boys' hall but their living quarters that eventually became Shakespeare's Blackfriars Theatre early in the next century.<br>
