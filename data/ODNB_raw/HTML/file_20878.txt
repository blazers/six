<span class="headword">Osborn,  Henry</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1694, <em>d.</em> 1771), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, was baptized on 27 August 1694 at Campton, Bedfordshire, the second son of Sir John Osborn, second baronet (1659&#150;1720), of Chicksands, Bedfordshire, and his second wife, Martha (<i>c</i>.1665&#150;1713), daughter of Sir John Kelynge, serjeant-at-law. His parents were both from the Bedfordshire gentry. Following the example of his elder brother, Peter, Henry chose a naval career, entering as a volunteer per order in the <i>Superb</i> (Captain James Moneypenny), on 20 December 1710, and proceeding to the Mediterranean. Rated as midshipman, he later joined the <i>Lion</i> (Captain Robert Bouler, or Bowler), before passing for lieutenant on 8 March 1717. On 3 July 1717 he was promoted lieutenant in the <i>Barfleur</i> by Sir George Byng, commanding the fleet in the Baltic (Byng's daughter Sarah had married his half-brother John). His subsequent service as lieutenant is not clear, as a Henry Osborne also passed for lieutenant a year later, and many conflicting appointments are found in 1720&#150;21. It seems that the future admiral was in the <i>Experiment</i> in 1719 on the north African coast and then in the <i>Yarmouth</i> between 1722 and 1725. He was certainly in the <i>Leopard</i> early in 1726, exchanging into the <i>Bredah</i> on 22 June, the flagship of the fleet then in the West Indies. On 12 October 1727 he was appointed commander of the sloop <i>Weazle</i>, in which he returned to England, and was immediately appointed captain of the <i>Squirrel</i> on 4 January 1728; while in command of her he was appointed governor of Newfoundland, a position he held until 1731. The post was at that time normally held by a sea officer who went there for each season. In 1734 he commanded the <i>Portland</i> in the channel and in 1738 took the <i>Salisbury</i> to the Mediterranean with Sir Chaloner Ogle. Later he was sent to the West Indies to join Edward Vernon's fleet and returned in the <i>Chichester</i> (80 guns) in 1741. About 1740 he married Mary Hughes, daughter of the commissioner of Portsmouth Dockyard; they had two sons and three daughters.<br>
<br>Osborn was next appointed to the <i>Princess Caroline</i> (80 guns), and joined Thomas Mathews's fleet in the Mediterranean. He therefore participated in the unsuccessful battle off Toulon on 11 February 1744, where he was in the van division, next astern of Rear-Admiral William Rowley, and was closely engaged, despite his ship having her lower deck awash. In the subsequent courts martial, he deposed that he considered Vice-Admiral Richard Lestock's neglect to get into station in the day and night before to be a principal cause of the miscarriage. After the battle Osborn, now a senior captain, gained considerable experience in command of detached squadrons, being sent to escort a convoy of victuallers and storeships with the supplies urgently needed by the Mediterranean fleet. He was, however, blockaded in the Tagus for a time by a French squadron, but eventually brought the convoy to Gibraltar. He then operated against Franco-Spanish supplies on the Italian coast and made an unsuccessful attempt to intercept a French Levant convoy. During 1745, now a commodore, he commanded a force cruising between capes Spartel and St Vincent to intercept ships arriving at Cadiz. He returned to England later in 1745, and declined an offer of the governorship of Louisbourg, apparently for financial reasons.<br>
<br>Osborn reached flag rank on 15 July 1747, and for a time commanded at the Nore, before being appointed commander-in-chief at the Leeward Islands on 5 February 1748. Reaching Barbados at the end of April, he arranged the homeward bound convoys and precautions against privateers, and initiated a programme of repairs for the dockyard at English Harbour, Antigua. However, the coming of peace cut short his command, and he left Barbados in December. Before sailing Osborn had to initiate proceedings against the first lieutenant of the <i>Chesterfield</i> who had seized the ship off Cape Coast Castle, west Africa, before being overpowered and imprisoned by other members of the crew who then sailed on to Barbados.<br>
<br>In early 1756 with the approach of the Seven Years' War, Osborn took a squadron to escort convoys and then reconnoitre Brest. He then commanded at Portsmouth for a time, until on 2 May 1757, as a full admiral since 2 February, he was appointed commander-in-chief, Mediterranean, Rear-Admiral Charles Saunders being second-in-command. Osborn's task of watching the French Toulon fleet and protecting British trade proved particularly difficult after the loss of Minorca. None the less he successfully performed this role with, it seems, aid from Augustus Hervey. The Toulon fleet emerged, but was obliged to take refuge in Cartagena, so Osborn based his force on Gibraltar to prevent their escape into the Atlantic. In 1758 rumours of a reinforcement coming from Toulon were prevalent, and Osborn took his squadron east in the hope of intercepting them. On 28 February the French squadron was sighted and Osborn ordered general chase, his ships separating after the four French ships. Two were captured, one was driven ashore, the smallest escaped. One of the captures was the <i>Foudroyant</i> after a remarkable action by a ship of its size, the <i>Monmouth</i> (Captain Arthur Gardiner). This success disposed of the threat and the squadron in Cartagena returned to Toulon. Osborn, however, soon afterwards suffered a stroke and was obliged to resign his command, though he recovered quite well. He received the thanks of the House of Commons, and by the influence of the duke of Bedford, was MP for Bedfordshire from December 1758 until 1761, though he is not known to have spoken or voted. In 1763 he succeeded Lord Anson as vice-admiral of England, and later he received a pension. Osborn died on 4 February 1771 at his home in Hill Street, Berkeley Square, Westminster; he was survived by his wife.<br>
<br>Although John Charnock gives a very unflattering character to Osborn, other evidence does not fully support him. Augustus Hervey refers to him as a &#145;worthy good man&#146;  (<span class="italic">Hervey's Journal</span>, 243), and while he puzzled Edward Boscawen, he made it clear that they were on good terms. Osborn seems to have cared for the seaman, for several sought to go with him to the Leeward Islands  (TNA: PRO, ADM 1/306) and he was dismayed by the frequent arrests for desertion and proposed a &#145;rambling area&#146; round Portsmouth to give seamen some freedom  (Rodger, 191). His ability and humanity are further evident in his correspondence while commander-in-chief at Portsmouth  (TNA: PRO, ADM 1/920&#150;4). Although he may have had interest in Bedfordshire, from which county both Byng and the duke (first lord of the Admiralty, 1744&#150;8) came, it is evident from his appointments that he was considered reliable, even if his principal action was a chase which did not require tactical skill.<br>
