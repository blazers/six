<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Vernon,  Edward</span>  (1684&#150;1757), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, was born in Westminster on 12 November 1684, the second son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28243/', "James Vernon (bap. 1646, d. 1727)")</script>, later editor of the <span class="italic">London Gazette</span>, and Mary Buck (<i>d</i>. 1715). James Vernon had been private secretary to the duke of Monmouth (1672&#150;83) and after the revolution of 1688 he became under-secretary and later secretary of state (1697&#150;1702) to William III. Between 1692 and 1700 Edward attended Westminster School, where he studied mathematics and astronomy and became proficient in Greek and Latin.<h2>
<a name="Earlycareer"></a>Early career</h2>On 10 May 1700 Vernon was entered as a volunteer in the <i>Shrewsbury</i> under Captain Benjamin Hoskins. The <i>Shrewsbury</i> was the flagship of Admiral Sir George Rooke, who took an Anglo-Dutch squadron to the sound to provide limited assistance to the Swedes in a dispute with Denmark. On 4 March 1701 Vernon moved to the <i>Ipswich</i> and shortly afterwards to the <i>Boyne</i>, which formed part of the expeditionary force under Rooke and the duke of Ormond sent to capture Cadiz in 1702. In September 1702 Rooke appointed Vernon third lieutenant on the <i>Lennox</i> and Vernon stayed with the <i>Lennox</i> on a variety of convoy duties during 1703, including a visit to Smyrna with the Levant trade.<br>
<br>On his return to England in March 1704 Vernon took up a commission as fifth lieutenant of Admiral Sir Cloudesley Shovell's flagship, the <i>Barfleur</i>, in which he sailed to the Mediterranean. Vernon remained with Shovell throughout 1704, and was with him on the <i>Barfleur</i> at the battle of Malaga (13 August). He returned to England with Shovell, and when Shovell succeeded Rooke as admiral of the fleet Vernon stayed with him as fourth and then third lieutenant of Shovell's new flagship, the <i>Britannia</i>, in December 1704. Shovell returned to the Mediterranean in the summer of 1705 and Vernon was present at the capture of Barcelona (28 September).<br>
<br>On 22 January 1706 Vernon was given his first command, the <i>Dolphin</i>, a small fifth rate of twenty-eight guns then at Sheerness under orders for the West Indies. Before Vernon could get her rigged and stored he was transferred to the <i>Rye</i> (32 guns) on 2 February and sent with dispatches for Shovell and the Earl Rivers at Lisbon. They had sailed into the Mediterranean to join the allied force under the earl of Galway in Valencia before Vernon arrived. Vice-Admiral Sir George Byng was in command at Lisbon and Vernon was sent cruising down to Gibraltar. When Shovell returned to Lisbon and decided to take the fleet back into the Mediterranean to execute Marlborough's plan to attack Toulon, Vernon was left at Lisbon, but in May he joined the allied fleet at Alicante and sailed with it towards Toulon. On 30 June the <i>Rye</i> was one of the ships ordered to assist the allied crossing of the River Var by bombarding the French positions on the west bank. On the following day Vernon was present at the landings intended to distract the French from the main crossing. He continued cruising and escort duties until the autumn, when he was ordered back to England. During the passage Shovell's flagship, the <i>Association</i>, and several other ships were lost off the Isles of Scilly.<br>
<br>On 7 November 1707 Vernon was given command of the <i>Jersey</i> (50 guns) at Woolwich, which he prepared for sea. In February 1708 the <i>Jersey</i> sailed with Sir George Byng's squadron to the French coast to watch a large French force at Dunkirk, thought to be designed for an expedition to Scotland. In March Vernon was with the fleet that pursued the expeditionary force of Claude, comte de Forbin-Gardanne, to Scotland and, although he took no part in the battle, he helped secure the only prize of that affair, the French warship the <i>Salisbury</i> (50 guns). After this action Vernon was sent south with some of the French prisoners. He was already under orders to proceed to Jamaica to reinforce Commodore Charles Wager's squadron and he was ordered to take as many supernumeraries as he could to reinforce Wager. Vernon arrived at Port Royal on 6 September 1708 and spent the next year with Wager's squadron, cruising. He observed the Spaniards' failure to challenge the British at sea. In October 1708 he had his first sight of Cartagena de las Indias, the great city of the <i>galeones</i>, the treasure ships, where Wager had won a spectacular, if not very profitable, victory back in May.<br>
<br>In September 1709 Vernon sailed for England, and he delivered the <i>Jersey</i> to the Deptford Dockyard officers on 17 December. Throughout the first half of 1710 he commanded the <i>Jersey</i> on a range of duties in the channel and then went back to the West Indies, arriving at Port Royal in December. He remained on that station until March 1712, when he was ordered home again. For the next two years Vernon remained unemployed as the prospect of imminent peace and, possibly, his whig credentials militated against him.<br>
<br>On 2 March 1715 Vernon was given command of the <i>Assistance</i> (50 guns), a two-year-old ship then at Sheerness. After fitting and manning his ship in the spring he spent the summer on duties in the channel and the North Sea. By early 1716 he was the most senior captain in the downs and had command of that station in the absence of a flag officer. In July 1716 he was ordered to take the new British ambassador's equipage to Constantinople. The ambassador, Edward Wortley Montagu, was then at Vienna. He was to join Vernon at Leghorn for the final leg of the journey. The departing ambassador, Sir Robert Sutton, would return with Vernon from Constantinople. The voyage involved a number of diplomatic complexities regarding the status of British warships in Ottoman waters and a further difficulty was caused by the ministry taking the opportunity to carry the envoy from Tripoli back to Port Mahon. After a few diplomatic exchanges, partly arising from the fact that the envoy wanted to travel by land across France, Vernon finally sailed in late October. During a terrible storm in the straits the sea broke through the stern, drove in the bulkhead of the state room, and smashed all the windows. Three days later, on 6 March 1717, the envoy was finally put ashore at Port Mahon. Vernon sailed on to Genoa, where he learned that Wortley Montagu would go to Constantinople by land. While at Leghorn, concerting plans to proceed to the Dardanelles, Vernon also took up the matter of Venetian impressment of British sailors directly with the grand duke of Tuscany at Pisa. Vernon's progress to Constantinople went smoothly and by careful preparation he avoided potential diplomatic difficulty on his return journey through the straits. He landed Sutton at Toulon and sailed on to Cadiz, where once more he took up the matter of detaining British seamen with the local authorities, before returning to England in October.<br>
<br>War with Spain broke out in December 1718, and Vernon's next commission, on 11 March 1719, was to the <i>Mary</i> (60 guns), attached to the earl of Berkeley's squadron at Portsmouth. On 15 May Vernon was appointed commander-in-chief of his majesty's ships at Jamaica and he hoisted his broad pennant on 24 July. On 4 October 1719 he arrived at Port Royal. During the remainder of the year Vernon cruised around the north coast of Jamaica and the Windward passage, protecting the homeward-bound trade. In March 1720 Vernon cruised up to Havana, chasing Spanish ships. On 20 March he sighted three Spanish sail in line. Followed closely by the <i>Ludlow Castle</i> he bore up to meet them. With a strong breeze and the weather gauge he found that he could not use his lower tier of guns effectively in his first pass and tacked to pass again to leeward, but in the battle the <i>Ludlow Castle</i> lost her foretop mast and fell out to leeward. Vernon followed to protect her stern as the Spaniards prepared to attack. Vernon took in sail to meet them and this display induced the Spaniards to break off and make a course for Havana. The rest of his time at Jamaica was relatively uneventful and he sailed for England in June 1721. Throughout Vernon's time in the West Indies the Spaniards had not shown much appetite for a fight.<h2>
<a name="Politicsandnationalcelebrity"></a>Politics and national celebrity</h2>In England Vernon stood for one of the parliamentary seats at Penryn, Cornwall, in the 1722 general election. The precise relationship between the Vernons and Penryn is unclear. His father, James, had stood for this small borough, and won the seat three times in 1695, 1705, and 1708. The chief political interest was held by Hugh Boscawen, first Viscount Falmouth, who was the government's main political manager in Cornwall. With this support Vernon was returned unopposed and in this parliament Vernon spoke and voted with the ministry.<br>
<br>In April 1726 Vernon was appointed to command the new seventy-gun third rate, <i>Grafton</i>, in a squadron under Admiral Sir Charles Wager, sailing for the Baltic to counter a potential Russian threat to the peace there. He remained in command of the <i>Grafton</i> when the squadron returned to Britain and in 1727 he was sent back to the Baltic with another squadron under Sir John Norris. On 19 June, at Copenhagen, news arrived of the death of George I. Vernon was relieved of his command and sent back to England with a loyal address from the fleet.<br>
<br>At the general election Vernon was re-elected for Penryn, but his interventions, in committee and on the floor of the Commons, grew increasingly hostile to the ministry. In January 1729, during the debate on the address, Vernon made his famous, heated accusation that the death of Admiral Francis Hosier and the decimation of his fleet in the West Indies during 1726 could have been avoided had the ministry not ordered Hosier to blockade the Spanish treasure fleet. His experience of the Spaniards indicated that a blockade was unnecessary. Porto Bello, the staging post of Spanish silver from Panama to Havana, could have been taken easily with three hundred men. His strong views, passionate speech, and accusatory style became a feature of his parliamentary work. According to the earl of Egmont, Vernon was so passionate in his views about the French fortifications at Dunkirk that during the debate on 12 February 1730 &#145;He brought up the Pope, the Devil, the Jesuits, the seamen, etc., so that the House had not patience to attend him, though he was not taken down. He quite lost his temper and made himself hoarse again&#146;  (<span class="italic">Egmont Diary</span>, 1.43&#150;4). In 1732 his inflammatory rhetoric earned him a rebuke from the speaker and an accusation from one of the targets of his criticism, Sir John Eyles, that he hid behind parliamentary privilege.<br>
<br>On 15 July 1729 Vernon married Sarah (1699&#150;1756), daughter of the prosperous Rochester brewer Thomas Best, which gave him opportunities in local Kent politics. His marriage, and the death of his father in January 1727, may have secured his financial position. He had purchased an estate at Nacton, near Ipswich in Suffolk. However, his political position at Penryn was looking increasingly fragile. His disillusion with Walpole's ministry and the replacement of Lord Falmouth as government election manager in Cornwall undermined his position. In the 1734 election he lost Penryn and was also defeated in his local borough, Ipswich.<br>
<br>For the next few years Vernon played the role of a Suffolk country gentleman, but when in December 1738 war with Spain over the depredations of the <i>garda costas</i> began to appear more likely, he approached Sir Charles Wager, the first lord of the Admiralty, for a command. His experience of the West Indies, his proven abilities in command, and the fact that no serving senior officer could be induced to take the appointment led to Vernon being promoted vice-admiral of the blue and given command of the West Indies squadron in July 1739. He sailed for Jamaica in July and arrived at Port Royal in October. He had a clear idea of how he wished to conduct operations there. Nineteen days after arriving at Port Royal he wrote to the secretary of state, the duke of Newcastle, about the prospect of capturing Spanish colonies. He knew Havana would be a great prize, but his best advice was to &#145;lay aside all thoughts of such expensive land expeditions as all the advantages may be better and cheaper procured by keeping a strong superiority at Sea in these seas&#146;  (Vernon to Newcastle, 31 Oct 1739, TNA: PRO, SP 42/85, fols. 29&#150;30). Porto Bello, &#145;the only mart for all the Wealth of Peru to come to Europe&#146;  (ibid., fol. 31), was his objective and on 5 November 1739 he sailed to attack the little town. On 20 November he attacked the forts with his six warships and by the next day the town was in his hands. Vernon had left England as expectations of an easy victory against Spain were growing. War had been declared on 19 October and news of Vernon's victory arrived in March 1740 as a confirmation of public expectations. The rejoicing went far beyond the usual celebrations of victory. Vernon became a national hero almost overnight. Both houses of parliament voted their thanks and the City of London made him a freeman. Addresses of congratulations came to the king from across the country. His popular appeal was immense. Medals, pottery, road names, and public house signs bore the name Vernon or Porto Bello and his birthday became a day of celebration across the country. The ministry had already decided that a major expedition would be sent to the West Indies to bring Spain to peace by taking and holding some of her important colonies. The ministry hoped that Havana, the &#145;key to all America&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 32694, fol. 33), would be the objective, but left the final decision to the council of war under the joint command of Vernon and the army commander, Lord Cathcart.<h2>
<a name="FailureintheWestIndies"></a>Failure in the West Indies</h2>Vernon had destroyed the fortifications at Porto Bello, but otherwise left the town unharmed. It was now open to British traders. During March 1740 Vernon went to Cartagena de las Indias. He bombarded the city, but found it impossible to assault with his ships. He conceded to Newcastle that 3000 troops would have enabled him to capture the place and he would be prepared for the future, as he informed the secretary of state, &#145;I know now as much of the avenues to their harbours as they do themselves&#146;  (9 May 1740, TNA: PRO, SP 42/85, fol. 204). Vernon had also learned that the rolling seas and poor ground made the waters off Cartagena a dangerous anchorage. He sailed up to Porto Bello for repairs, then on to the little fortified port of Chagres. After two days the fort surrendered. It was destroyed and the town was left open to trade. While he was at Porto Bello news reached Vernon that the intended expedition was definitely coming out.<br>
<br>Over the summer of 1740 Vernon's concerns grew. He was short of naval stores and seamen. News that Spanish and French squadrons were on their way to the West Indies was worrying. Although France was neutral, the behaviour of the French governor on St Domingue suggested to Vernon that France was bent on assisting the Spaniards. He decided to husband his forces at Port Royal, refusing to risk damage or to be drawn to leeward. Vernon's experience of the Caribbean and his concerns made him determined that the expeditionary force would serve as he intended. It would not go to Havana, but to Cartagena, which he believed the troops could rapidly take before they were reduced by disease. The city lay to windward of Jamaica so that they could return rapidly to the island if threatened by Spanish or French attacks.<br>
<br>The expeditionary force arrived in January 1741. Cathcart had died on the voyage and the army of about 8500 British and American troops was commanded by Major-General Thomas Wentworth. The naval escort, commanded by Vice-Admiral Sir Chaloner Ogle, brought Vernon's squadron up to thirty-three ships of the line. Although this fleet made the Franco-Spanish threat less worrying, Vernon was saddled with another serious problem. The Caribbean provided barely enough seamen to replace losses on his small squadron. This vast fleet would soon be losing, through disease and desertion, seamen that could not be replaced. The army was the only adequate source of manpower.<br>
<br>Although nominally equals in command, Wentworth deferred to Vernon's experience in the opening months of operations. He provided troops to help man the ships and concurred in the attack upon Cartagena. During the attack relations became strained as Vernon pressed Wentworth forward, making ill-considered accusations about inaction and incompetence within the army. When the army finally reached San Lazar, the final fortification before Cartagena, Vernon again urged Wentworth to press on and, contrary to the opinion of his council of war, Wentworth accepted Vernon's demand to assault the fort. The action on 10 April 1741 was a disaster. Both officers realized that a reduction of this last obstacle was impossible before disease, which was beginning to take a hold, reduced the army's capability. Vernon would not put his seamen ashore to suffer the same fate. The reports that were sent to London glossed over many of the issues raised by this operation, as the expeditionary force quietly returned to Jamaica.<br>
<br>The next objective was to be Santiago on the southern coast of Cuba. Vernon knew that a direct attack from the sea was difficult and was determined to land the army to the east. Unfortunately he did not tell Wentworth and from the beginning of this attack relations between the two services deteriorated. As Vernon urged the army to push on through difficult terrain and manipulated the information he allowed Wentworth to have, he was also acutely aware of how the news of failure would be received in London. His dispatches to London had always been very full, and he started to enclose carefully selected items of his correspondence with Wentworth. The dispatches themselves began to contain complaints and criticisms of the general. Wentworth's correspondence was, by comparison, brief and sometimes ambiguous. It was not until much later that Wentworth's enclosures began to shed much light on the campaign. Vernon also asked his brother James to publish an account of Wentworth's incompetence, and in the summer of 1741 Captain Charles Knowles, a close colleague of Vernon, was sent home. Knowles was probably the author of a pamphlet, <span class="italic">An Account of the Expedition to Cartagena</span>, circulated in manuscript in London later that year, which was extremely hostile to the army. The campaign on Cuba ended in December 1741 with relations between the two services at an extremely low ebb.<br>
<br>A final attempt was made to attack Panama with a reinforcement of 2000 troops that arrived. Vernon was unenthusiastic given the rumours of French squadrons going to the West Indies, but it was a favourite scheme of the governor of Jamaica, Edward Trelawney, and Wentworth was determined to do something significant with the reinforcements before they wasted with disease. Trelawney and Wentworth forced the operation on Vernon with the same disastrous effect as Vernon's earlier pressure had created. Vernon did not follow the agreed plan so news got through to the Spaniards to defend the inland passes. He refused to allow the transports to concentrate before appearing off the town. With the army spread out across the sea from Cartagena to Porto Bello, the operation was called off. The last weeks of the operation were spent with minor expeditions to the island of Roatan and to Georgia. By September the army had ceased to exist as a military force and the troops were largely split up on the warships. Vernon was, at last, effectively commander-in-chief, but on 23 September orders arrived to return to England. Vernon sailed on 19 October, arriving off St David's Head on 26 December 1742.<h2>
<a name="Latercareer"></a>Later career</h2>Vernon found his public popularity largely intact. His success at Porto Bello, his exposure of the shortcomings of Walpole's foreign policy, coupled with his earlier stand against the ministry, ensured Vernon's rise as a symbol of liberty and patriotic whig opposition to what many saw as a corrupt and out-of-touch administration. In the 1741 general election he had been chosen for Penryn, Rochester, and Ipswich. He had also been put up at London, Westminster, and Portsmouth, but ministerial disquiet over such numerous nominations led to support being withheld in these seats. Vernon chose to sit for Ipswich, a seat which he held from then until his death. He had a half-hour audience with George II, during which he pressed the king on the need to keep a force superior to the enemy at sea. According to his brother James, &#145;the King bore the lecture pretty well&#146;, but Vernon found his reward was not what he might have hoped  (BL, Add. MS 40794, fol. 28). Unlike Wentworth, who was dispatched to Flanders to command a division, Vernon found himself unemployed and passed over in promotion. Vernon's hostility was directed at the first lord, the earl of Winchilsea. During 1744 he published his correspondence relating to the expedition, together with the selected enclosures. He also published his correspondence with the secretary to the Admiralty, Thomas Corbett, concerning the poor design of British ships, which Vernon claimed was the responsibility of the surveyor of the navy, Sir Jacob Acworth. He continued to comment upon many naval matters in the Commons, in print, and in letters to the Admiralty. Indeed his public profile, his acknowledged experience, his outspoken &#145;country&#146; stance, and his attempts, laced with his usual invective, to have a select committee inquire into Acworth's conduct, made him highly unpopular at the Admiralty at a time when it was struggling to contain the operational and political problems of the early months of open war with France.<br>
<br>In December 1744 Winchilsea was replaced by the duke of Bedford as first lord of the Admiralty and on 23 April 1745 Vernon was promoted admiral of the white. Bedford had a high regard for Vernon's expertise and corresponded with him on the strategic situation in the West Indies and Europe. It was this habit of corresponding with such freedom that made Vernon both valuable and dangerous. His criticisms of the disposition of the western squadron during 1745 focused attention on a policy of concentration that George Anson put to such good effect during 1746&#150;7. On 28 July 1745 Vernon was appointed to command the western squadron, but on 8 August he transferred to the downs, where the latest intelligence suggested French invasion forces were assembling to support the Jacobite rising in Scotland. He kept a close watch on the Flanders coast throughout the late summer and autumn of 1745, but became involved in a frustrating correspondence with the Admiralty over the size of his squadron and the limits of his command, which, in late November, became heated over the right to appoint warrant officers. The dispute rumbled on through December as Vernon made dispositions to resist a possible French invasion. Finally, on 26 December 1745, Vernon was ordered to hand over command to Vice-Admiral William Martin, who had travelled from Plymouth to join Vernon's squadron.<br>
<br>By mid-March 1746 copies of Vernon's correspondence with the Admiralty during the previous year were in print under the titles <span class="italic">Seasonable Advice from an Honest Sailor</span> and <span class="italic">A Specimen of Naked Truth from a British Sailor</span>. When called before the Admiralty for a meeting under Bedford's chairmanship on 9 April he refused to confirm or deny that he was responsible for the publication of the correspondence, asserting that he had been badly treated and that the publication was a private matter on which he was not obliged to answer. Bedford laid the matter before the king, who ordered that Vernon be struck off the flag list on 11 April.<h2>
<a name="Characterandfinalyears"></a>Character and final years</h2>Vernon remained politically active. He spoke on the naval officers' petition against making half-pay officers subject to martial law on 24 February 1749 and in the address of thanks in November of that year. He chaired the parliamentary committee on the herring fishery and helped to establish the Society of Free British Fishery. His great contribution was as an enthusiastic advocate for the maritime economy and defence. Throughout his pamphlets and speeches the major theme of an overwhelmingly powerful navy, based on good ship design, the humane encouragement of seamen to man the fleet, and the development of the maritime economy, is constantly repeated. His determined defence of liberty, country politics, and blue water strategy were a neat encapsulation of whig patriotism. His influence was based partly on his flamboyant style, but largely on the professional respect in which he was held. Until the fall of Louisbourg in the summer of 1745 Vernon had achieved the greatest maritime victories of the war. Although he never tried his ideas in battle he added to the signal commands in 1739 to create greater tactical flexibility in the line of battle. As a trenchant critic of naval officers who apparently failed in their duty he was in tune with current public concern, and he was not prepared to put long-standing friendship before a strict inquiry. On 10 April 1745 Vernon's vote to include Admiral Thomas Mathews in the Commons petition to George II to court-martial the admirals and six captains involved in the battle of Toulon was an important factor in his old friend's eventual disgrace. However, his political weight gradually diminished. His behaviour in 1745 was highly questionable. Anson eclipsed Vernon's achievements by his circumnavigation (1740&#150;44) and the great victory off Finisterre in May 1747. Anson's political weight and professionalism dominated the later 1740s. In January 1748 Vernon published <span class="italic">Original Letters to an Honest Sailor</span>, being copies of several letters from political figures to him since 1739. It caused his enemies a little concern at first, but passed without serious repercussions. By 1756 Vernon had largely retired from public life. His three children had all died and his wife died on 9 May of that year. He died at Nacton on 30 October 1757 and was buried in St Martin's Church, Nacton, on 6 November.<br>
