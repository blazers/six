<span class="headword">Worboys, Sir  Walter John</span>  (1900&#150;1969), <span class="occ">chemical industrialist and design promoter</span>, was born at Cottesloe, Western Australia, on 22 February 1900, the eldest child of Walter Worboys, engineer, and his wife, Amanda Urquhart. He was educated at Scotch College and the University of Western Australia where he graduated in chemistry and geology. He proceeded as a Rhodes scholar to Lincoln College, Oxford, where his supervisor was Nevil Sidgwick, and gained his DPhil in chemistry in 1925. He then joined Synthetic Ammonia and Nitrates Ltd, a subsidiary of Brunner, Mond &amp; Co., as a research chemist at Billingham, and devoted himself to the production of synthetic nitrogen and fertilizers, then in an early stage of development.<br>
<br>On 22 March 1927 he married Ethelwyn Bessie (Betty), daughter of Henry Lavers, an Australian mining engineer; they had one son and one daughter.<br>
<br>Brunner Mond became one of the founder constituents of Imperial Chemical Industries, with which company Worboys remained until he retired as commercial director in 1959. During his later years with the chemical industry he carried a full share of its burdens. He was chairman of the Association of British Chemical Manufacturers in 1953&#150;6 and president in 1957&#150;9. He was a member of council of the Society of the Chemical Industry in 1955&#150;8 and gold medallist in 1957, and became a fellow of the Royal Institute of Chemistry in that year.<br>
<br>Worboys's interest in industrial design, always active, was greatly stimulated by his service as chairman of ICI's plastics division from 1942 until 1948, when he became a director of the main company. Plastics lent themselves with equal facility to good or bad design; Worboys resolved to exploit the good and to discourage the bad, and he employed designers to serve both aims. He joined the Council of Industrial Design in 1947 and in 1953&#150;60 was its chairman. The council, started by the Board of Trade in 1944 to encourage good design as a necessary feature of the post-war export drive, had never enjoyed an easy life, and in its early days had perhaps more critics than friends. There were those who felt that good design could best be determined by market forces, others who saw in any attempt to influence it the hand of government interference. When Worboys became chairman he decided, probably on the strength of his experience with the Festival of Britain of 1951 in which he took an active part, that if the council was to make its mark there was an overwhelming need for a permanent exhibition gallery in London. Such a project meant much greater government support; the fact that this support was provided on a pound-for-pound basis with industry was Worboys's special achievement and his success was due, not only to his enthusiasm and driving force, but also to his ability to convince Whitehall that under his guidance the council and its Design Centre (as the permanent exhibition was to be called) would develop on sound and productive lines.<br>
<br>In the event, the Design Centre went from strength to strength, impressively fulfilling the bold and original conception that manufacturers could be persuaded to pay for space in which the goods shown would be selected by another body. The formation of the Design Centre was a turning point in the fortunes of the Council of Industrial Design; in a world where much that is ugly is created daily, the work of the council has provided a steady influence for good. As Sir Gordon Russell, former director of the council and Worboys's close partner in its work, wrote: &#145;When the history of the revolt against ugliness comes to be written, it will be seen how important was the work of a very small group of top-ranking businessmen after the last war. Of these Walter Worboys was a natural leader&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 21 March 1969). Worboys's concern with industry, with design, and with the arts made a clear bond with the Royal Society of Arts; he became a fellow of the society in 1949, was awarded the bicentenary medal in 1956, and was elected a member of its council in 1961. In 1967 he became chairman of council, a post he held until his death.<br>
<br>Some ten years remained to Worboys after he left ICI, and into this period he compressed a new career. In 1960 he became chairman of British Tyre and Rubber Industries and started a much needed programme of modernization and reorganization, which contributed greatly to the subsequent growth and strength of the company. In 1965 the Westminster Bank, of which he was a director, persuaded him to accept the formidable responsibility of chairing the British Printing Corporation, whose affairs were then at a low ebb. He held both these posts until his death, and they constituted a heavy burden. During this period Worboys began to undertake new commitments in the educational field. Early in the 1950s he had become a governor of Radley College and in 1962 he became chairman of the governing council of Roedean School. Worboys also played a notable part in the university developments of the 1960s by serving as a member of the academic advisory committee for the University of East Anglia and as chairman of the corresponding body for Brunel University. He presided over the government committee on road traffic signs set up in 1961 with results which were appreciated by road users throughout the land.<br>
<br>In appearance Worboys always seemed active, fit, and alert. He was a man of distinction, endowed with the eye at once of the administrator, the artist, the scholar, and the man of affairs. To all his many activities he brought a sense of style. He set uncompromising standards, both of behaviour and performance. His manner could vary from warmth to severity, and his tolerance for the imperfect was limited, but at heart he was most kindly. He was essentially a man of his times. Justly described in the company's house journal as one of the architects of the modern ICI, he was equally at home in the City, in Whitehall, and in the arts. He accomplished much and the burden it placed on his daily life was cheerfully borne. He found his pleasures in his family, his work, in the arts, and in his country home, Norton Hall, Norton-on-Tees. His appointment as an honorary fellow of Lincoln College in 1957 gave him especial satisfaction. He was knighted in 1958 and received an honorary doctorate from Brunel University in 1967. Worboys died at his London home, Flat 8, 69 Onslow Square, Kensington, on 17 March 1969.<br>
