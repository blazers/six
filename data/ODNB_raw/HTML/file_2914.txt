<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Borough,  Stephen</span>  (1525&#150;1584), <span class="occ">explorer and naval administrator</span>, was born on 25 September 1525 at Borough House, Northam Burrows, Northam, Devon, the elder son of Walter Borough (1494&#150;1548) and Mary Dough; his younger brother was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2915/', "William Borough (d. 1598)")</script>.<h2>
<a name="Educationandfirstvoyages"></a>Education and first voyages</h2>With his uncle, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/74036/', "John Borough (d. 1570)")</script>, Stephen probably participated in the first measured surveys of south Devon and Cornwall in 1538; these survive in the British Library. The greatest influence on his childhood was undoubtedly John Borough, who until the late 1530s (when he began to undertake surveying tasks for Henry VIII) had sailed regularly from Bideford, Topsham, and Bristol to trade in Sicily, Crete, and the Levant. Stephen learned thereby to master a wide range of navigational and pilotage skills as a child, while his uncle must also have taught him useful linguistic skills using a Castilian <span class="roman">Bible</span>, a Castilian rutter (or book of sailing instructions), and another compiled in Portuguese. As a youth Stephen Borough also gained firsthand knowledge of the hazards of the Bay of Biscay; writing in 1563 of ships lost on voyages to Andalusia he noted that:<blockquote>some were lost on the coast, others have perished upon cape Finisterre in Galizia and also others upon the strymes and coast of Brittaine. The chiefest of these losses (as I am able to approve) hath happened throughe ignoraunce of the Arte [of navigation] and the presumption of the unskyllful. (BL, Lansdowne MS 116, fol. 7)</blockquote>In consequence Borough matched his navigational skills with a speaking knowledge of Spanish, which later fitted him well for the first Muscovy voyages to which Sebastian Cabot brought the best of long-distance navigational and organizational practice from Seville.<br>
<br>On 20 May 1553 Stephen Borough sailed in the expedition that Cabot had prepared as master of the <i>Edward Bonaventure</i> (160 tons) under John Dee's talented tutee, Richard Chancellor, who had been appointed pilot-general of the fleet of three ships, including the ill-fated <i>Bona Esperanza</i> (120 tons), which under Sir Hugh Willoughby's command was trapped in the ice along with the <i>Bona Confidentia</i> (60 tons). So it was Borough's ship alone that was ready to open trade past the North Cape and through St Nicholas (Archangel). Chancellor journeyed overland to Moscow to formalize relations before both pilots sailed her back the next spring through the Kara Sea and past the fishing settlements at the mouth of the Dvina River. In 1589 Richard Hakluyt published Borough's exploratory voyage of 1556&#150;7 as <span class="italic">The Navigation and Discoverie towards the River Ob</span>. Borough had bravely taken the pinnace <i>Searchthrift</i> as far as the Kola River, having been escorted by the Russian ketch <i>Pechora</i> until 15 July 1556. On 31 July Novaya Zemlya and the treacherous 35 mile wide Viagatz Strait were sighted. Borough stayed there until 23 August (with the result that it was named the Burrough Strait on admiralty charts until the late nineteenth century), recording with Richard Johnson's and William Borough's assistance the hostile icy environs of the Viagatz Strait in the late summer of 1556 before returning to Kholmogory on 11 September where Borough wisely chose to winter. Hakluyt records that Borough started his homeward voyage on 23 May 1557, travelling via Ribachi (Fisher Island, Finland), where he encountered Norwegian vessels with Dutch crews trading strong beer for stockfish. At Dronten (Trondheim) he learned of the loss of the <i>Bona Confidentia</i> and of the recovery of her sails by the town's mayor, and of the alleged loss of the <i>Philip and Mary</i>, although she had safely arrived in the Thames in April 1557. The real loss was of his colleague, Richard Chancellor, captain of the <i>Edward Bonaventure</i>, which had foundered in Pitsligo Bay, Scotland, on 10 November 1556.<h2>
<a name="Seville1558"></a>Seville, 1558</h2>In 1557&#150;8 Dee and Borough worked on the technical problems of preparing a chart of the far northern waters explored by the latter in 1556. Later Dee compared Mercator's maps with &#145;my friend Stephen Borough, his platt&#146;  (BL, Cotton MS Vitellus C.vii, fol. 60<i>v</i>). Stephen Borough's specialist navigational knowledge acquired on that route meant that he was ideally placed to go to Seville in 1558, in response to covert diplomatic arrangements made by Philip and Mary; his knowledge of the near Arctic was to be exchanged for an insight into the training of Spanish pilots. He later described to Hakluyt the organization of navigational training in Seville as he witnessed it in 1558. Hakluyt's dedication to <i>Divers voyages</i> (1582) asserts that Borough was treated with great honour by the Spaniards, and presented with a pair of perfumed gloves worth 5 or 6 ducats.<br>
<br>These gloves were the symbols of qualification and office to which the examined pilots were admitted. Borough was present there despite the formal prohibition on foreigners made at the instance of Charles V in 1547. When Borough arrived in Seville, Sebastian Cabot had only just died, although Alonso de Chaves had succeeded to his former office as pilot-major in 1552. This unique chance to be treated on a par with Cabot as an expert on Arctic waters was not lost on Borough, who wisely restricted himself to interest in the theoretical and scientific content of Martin Cort&eacute;s's training manual <span class="italic">Breve compendio del arte de navegar</span>, completed in 1545 but not published until 1551. Borough clearly thought that Cort&eacute;s's manual was a model document, and on his return to England ensured that the manual was made available to generations of English seamen, instrument makers, and hydrographers through translation by Richard Eden and publication by the queen's printer, Richard Jugge, as <span class="italic">The Arte of Navigation</span> in 1561. Stephen Borough's wisdom and achievements are commended in Eden's preface, written in 1561:<blockquote>he is neither malicious nor envious of his arte and science, in that he desireth the same for the common profite to be common to al men: And for the same intent was the first that moved certain worshipful of your company, as Syr William Garrerd, Maister William Merrick, Maister Blase Sanders, and Maister Edward Castlen to have this work translated into the English tongue.</blockquote>Eden adds in praise of Borough's initiative that:<blockquote>whereas the same hath ben discovered unto you even to the mighty Ryver Ob, that falleth into the Scithian Ocean &hellip; A voyage of such difficultie, and in maner impossibilitie, that consyderyng the infinite dangiours thereof (as I have learned by th information of Steven a Burrugh, that was then the Chiefe Pilot of the same Voyage) that it may seme impossible that they should ever have escaped, excepte the mightye hand of God by the expert skilfulnesse of so excellent a pilot had delivered them from those daungers.</blockquote>
<h2>
<a name="TheArctictrade"></a>The Arctic trade</h2>With a right, as an assistant adventurer mentioned in the charter of 1555, to carry on personal trade within the Muscovy Company, Borough served as chief pilot in the <i>Swallow</i> in May 1560, taking a cargo of broadcloth, kerseys, salt, sack, and raisins, plus a pipe of sherry for Tsar Ivan IV marked by two round compasses on the bung. He returned from St Nicholas with Anthony Jenkinson after his epic overland journey into central Asia. He was back in Russian waters in May 1561, carrying Jenkinson as Queen Elizabeth's ambassador to Persia. His trips were part of a complex strategy to expand trade without operating in conflict with Spanish naval ambitions. While Lord Admiral Fiennes de Clinton and the privy council considered how to reorganize the navy following the loss of Calais in 1558 and Le Havre in 1562, Borough petitioned Queen Elizabeth to replicate the organization of the Casa de Contratac&iacute;on in Seville. Dated 1562, Borough's first draft set out both the form of his own experience and the need for change  (BL, Lansdowne MS 116, fols. 3&#150;7). This was followed by a later draft for the grant of the office of pilot-major to Borough, dated January 1564. Borough's clear appreciation of the value of the Casa's practice comes through. Although his case for the office of pilot-major was never accepted, he was soon afterwards made one of four keepers of the queen's ships on the Medway.<br>
<br>Hostility towards Stephen Borough's interests in the Arctic trade gradually emerged during the 1560s, with resentment growing inside the Muscovy Company that he, along with three other pilots, was allowed to undertake personal trade. The king's remembrancer's customs accounts for 1564 and later port books record the beginning of the controversy, which was created by Borough's embarking with private trade as chief pilot on voyages via the North Cape route in 1564, 1565, 1567, and 1568. Drapers' Company accounts show that in 1569 he shipped a private cargo of fourteen chests of &#145;brimstone&#146; (saltpetre) in the <i>Swallow</i> of London. In 1571 his private adventure on the voyage to St Nicholas consisted of the export of seventy-two broadcloths, worth about &pound;2000. John Hoddesdon's petition over prosecution for his own trade in furs in 1586&#150;7 brought adverse if posthumous comparison of Borough's legitimate private trade, alongside more censorious criticism of the private trade of William Borough and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2911/', "Christopher Borough")</script>, Stephen's son who had made six trips to Russia by 1579.<h2>
<a name="MasterofTrinityHouse"></a>Master of Trinity House</h2>In 1574 Michael Lok reported that Stephen Borough was one of three members of the Muscovy Company appointed to treat in London with Martin Frobisher, Lok, and Christopher Hall about near polar voyaging to Cathay. Meanwhile he had found a safer career that allowed him to refocus on his domestic life at Chatham. He had unexpectedly lost his first wife, Elinor (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Smith), in 1562. On 26 March 1563 he married Johanna Overy (<i>d</i>. 1604), a widow, in St Dunstan and All Saints, Stepney. His children included Christopher, Judith, and two other much younger daughters, Anne and Elizabeth, mentioned in his brother's will of 1598. From 1563 until his death Stephen took on naval duties which increasingly tied him to work on the king's ships moored on the Medway between Rochester and Gillingham, and on the new dockyard facilities at Chatham, especially following a disastrous waterfront fire there on 4 August 1576. While this job overlapped with the formal duties of the elder brethren of Trinity House, any implicit conflict was amicably resolved with his election as a much respected master of Trinity House in 1572. Improvements he saw effected at Chatham included the acquisition of Upnor Castle for the specialized local storage of naval ordnance in 1568, the acquisition of land, plus the planning and construction of a massive store finished in 1580 with a new wharf alongside and a ropery 380 feet long completed in 1586. Fear that the complex was vulnerable to naval raids led to the insertion of defensive stakes in St Mary's Channel in 1574 and to the planning of a heavy chain barrier costing &pound;250 deployed over two huge wheels, five lighters, and some smaller pinnaces, which had cost a further &pound;360 to commission by January 1586. His responsibilities for twenty-nine berths for warships and the associated dockyard facilities all appear on an anonymous map of Chatham, perhaps drawn by him in 1584  (BL, Cotton MS Augustus I.i.52), showing the moorings for the whole fleet in ordinary.<br>
<br>Stephen Borough's advancement in 1572 to be master of Trinity House marks the point whereat his brother took over the responsibilities of the Muscovy Company's chief pilot, notably for shipping on the dangerous North Cape route. Stephen's duties at Trinity House entailed responsibility for organizing coastal pilotage and giving advice about which ships to accept into naval service. His status there conferred opportunities to promote improvements in navigational instruction with Richard Hakluyt. Hakluyt published his advice, along with more from Dee, about the conduct of voyages past the North Cape in <span class="italic">Principall Navigations</span> in 1589, and Borough's &#145;Instructions given to the masters and mariners of the ships of the Muscovie Companie, sayling towards the Bay of St Nicholas&#146; of 3 May 1557 in the 1598 edition of <span class="italic">Principal Navigations</span>. Closely derived from Borough's experience is BL, Harley MS 167/2, mostly in one hand, comprising navigational instruction and diagrams, English translations made in 1578 of Spanish rutters for routes to Brazil, the Caribbean, and Mediterranean ports, and &#145;Borough's rules&#146; for the passage from Orfordness, past the North Cape, to Russia's northernmost seaports.<h2>
<a name="Deathandburial"></a>Death and burial</h2>Borough died on 12 July 1584 at Chatham where he was buried the following day at St Mary's. An engraved Elizabethan brass placed on his tomb in the chancel reads thus:<blockquote>He in his lifetime discovered Moscovia, by the northern sea pasage to St Nicholas, in the yere 1553. At his setting forth of England he was accompanied in his ship by Sir Hugh Willoughbie, being Admirell of the fleete, who, with all the company of the said two shippes, were frozen to death in Lappia the same winter. After his discoverie of Roosia and the costes adjoyning to wit Lappia, Nova Zembla, and the cuntry of Samoyeda etc: he frequented the trade to St Nicholas yearlie, as chief pilot for the voyages, until he was chosen one of the four principal Masters in ordinarie of the Queen's Majesties royall Navy, where in he continued in charge of sundrie sea services till time of his death.
