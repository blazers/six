<span class="headword">Philpot,  Glyn Warren</span>  (1884&#150;1937), <span class="occ">painter and sculptor</span>, was born on 5 October 1884 in London, the youngest of five children of John Philpot (1849&#150;1927), surveyor, and his wife, Jessie Carpenter (1842?&#150;1892), who died when Philpot was seven. He showed a precocious aptitude for drawing, and at thirteen began printing little booklets whose woodcut decorations show a debt to Charles Ricketts. When ill health forced him to leave school at Streatham, he was sent to the Lambeth Art School to study with Philip Connard in the hope that he might be interested in the lessons without tiring. Here he showed a facility for drawing and composition which obtained him a scholarship for two years. When he was only nineteen, a view of a church interior that he had painted during a visit to Rouen in France was hung at the Royal Academy. He spent 1906 in the studio of Jean-Paul Laurens at the Acad&eacute;mie Julian in Paris. However, he was as unaffected by the styles of his art masters as he was by the current trends adopted by his fellow students. It was rather the work of old masters such as Titian, studied in galleries in London and Paris, and his English models, Ricketts and Charles Shannon, that stimulated him towards old-fashioned figurative and imaginative subjects rather than landscape. He also became a brilliant exponent of their method of building up a picture with successive glazes over an underpainting.<br>
<br>In 1906 Philpot became a Roman Catholic, which shocked his Baptist family. He took a series of ever larger studios in Chelsea and organized several small exhibitions. These earned him enough to travel to Spain in 1908. On his return he painted <span class="italic">Manuelito</span> (1909), the picture which, more than his first one-man show at the Baillie Gallery in 1910, made his reputation. A number of successful portraits led to a stream of commissions, which earned him a prosperous living. However, aware that hack work led to sterility, he sought to make each portrait a challenge by varying the pose or the technique. At the same time, he was painting decorative subject pictures on classical and religious themes. He constantly drew from male models, latterly mostly black men&#151;&#145;to keep my eye and hand in&#146;  (Philpot MSS)&#151;and often used such studies in his paintings. Having barely saved sufficient money to last two months, he again went to Spain. As a result he painted <span class="italic">Zarzarrosa</span> (1910), which was hailed in the press as a masterpiece. His success financed the first of many visits to Italy and returns to Paris. <span class="italic">The Marble Worker</span> (1912) won him the first prize of a gold medal and &pound;300 at the Carnegie International Exhibition at Pittsburgh in 1913, when he painted some portraits in the United States. When war was declared in 1914 he was living in Venice, and he returned promptly to England to enlist. After several rejections on medical grounds, he was finally accepted but was demobilized when his health broke down. As a war artist, he painted portraits of admirals.<br>
<br>During Philpot's first retrospective show, at the Grosvenor Gallery in London in 1923, he was elected RA. Chosen to paint King Fouad in Cairo, he was paid &pound;3000 and his fare. In 1927 he bought a house at Baynards, Sussex, where he fashioned a large bronze, <span class="italic">Oedipus Replying to the Sphinx</span>. Three years later he returned to the United States as a member of the jury (along with Matisse) at the 1930 Carnegie International Exhibition, Pittsburgh, and a collection of his pictures was shown at the Venice Biennale.<br>
<br>However, despite such marks of success, long-standing dissatisfaction with his work, a belief that it ought to express more spiritual values, and a desire to free himself from possessions culminated in 1931 in his hiring a studio in Paris, where for a time he devoted himself to sculpture. Upon resuming painting he abandoned glazes and endeavoured, by direct painting with brighter colours, by a simplification of form, and by a more sensitive line, to forge a new style. He was aware of the financial risk involved. When both the critics and the public disliked his new manner, sales and commissions almost ceased. He had to sell Baynards Manor. To win new patrons he organized one-man exhibitions (1932 and 1934) at the Leicester Galleries, London. There he first exhibited the still lifes which show his gift as a colourist. From 1935 to 1937 he worked frequently in north Africa and the south of France, painting watercolours, exhibited at the Syrie Maugham Gallery (1935) and the Redfern Gallery (1937) in London. He also did a series of superb paintings of his Jamaican servant, Henry Thomas. However, the strain of four exhibitions in six years exacerbated problems with high blood pressure. Two days after a dental operation he suddenly suffered a fatal stroke, on 16 December 1937 at his home, 1 Marlborough Gate House, Lancaster Gate, London. After a service at Westminster Cathedral he was buried at Petersham, near Richmond, London. A few days later Vivian Forbes, an artist friend whose emotional instability added to the stress of Philpot's last years, committed suicide.<br>
<br>Courageous and unmercenary, Philpot was also generous, gentle, shy, enthusiastic, and quick, with a great charm of manner, and a delicious sense of fun and of the ridiculous. He was unmarried; his sister Daisy unselfishly devoted herself to looking after him. A memorial exhibition of his work was held in 1938 at the Tate Gallery, of which he was a trustee in 1927 and 1935. A major retrospective at the National Portrait Gallery, London (1984&#150;5), made his work known to a younger generation.<br>
