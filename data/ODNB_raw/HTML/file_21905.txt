<span class="headword">Pepys,  Richard</span>  (<em>c.</em>1588&#150;1659), <span class="occ">judge</span>, was born at Cottenham, Cambridgeshire, the second son of John Pepys (<i>d</i>. 1604) of the Middle Temple and of Impington, near Cottenham, and Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1642), daughter of John Bendish of Bower Hall, Bumpstead, Essex. Pepys joined the Middle Temple in 1609 and was called to the bar in 1617. He subsequently sat in the Short Parliament (March&#150;May 1640) as member for Sudbury, Suffolk. In 1642 he was left heir to the estate of his elder brother, John, and in 1643&#150;4 was elected treasurer of the Middle Temple, having previously served there as reader in 1640. In January 1654 he was appointed serjeant-at-law, and was immediately afterwards a member of the commission for the spring circuit through the midland counties. On 30 May in the same year he was appointed baron of the exchequer, in spite of scruples as to the protector's legal authority. In August, Pepys, by then over sixty, accepted appointment to Ireland, &#145;attracted (it seems) by the chance of improving his fortune&#146;  (Barnard, 284), though the move at his age could be viewed as foolhardy rather than wise. Made at the outset a member of the Irish lord deputy's council, he served under both Charles Fleetwood and Henry Cromwell and thus learned at first hand of the manner in which the council's work suffered from the &#145;lamentable rubbs and interruptions&#146; of which Cromwell was to make complaint. When, in September 1657, Cromwell wrote privately to Secretary Thurloe on the subject of filling future vacancies on the Irish council, his list of qualifications was very likely based on his own assessment of Pepys's worth: councillors should possess sound judgment, be expert in draftsmanship (&#145;conceiving and wordeing of orders&#146;) and prepared to &#145;take paines to observe and search into matters&#146;  (Thurloe, <span class="italic">State papers</span>, 6.505&#150;6).<br>
<br>Pepys's principal duties were judicial. Named chief justice of the upper bench in 1654 he was associated with the revival of the Dublin four courts the following year. Until the appointment of William Steele as lord chancellor in August 1656 he was chief commissioner of the Irish great seal and in that capacity presided over a makeshift court which in a test case handed down a decision presaging a return to normality in Ireland's commercial life; he insisted on the payment of interest on debts contracted before 1641.<br>
<br>Pepys married, first, Judith, a daughter of Sir William Cutte of Arkesden, Essex, and second, Mary (<i>d</i>. 1660), daughter of Captain Gosnold. He left four sons and two daughters. His eldest son, Richard, married Mary, daughter of John Scott of Belchamp-Walter, Essex, and, with his wife and daughter, Mary, migrated to New England in 1634, but returned in 1650 and settled at Ashen Clare, Essex. A number of Pepys's letters to Richard have been printed  (W. C. Pepys, <span class="italic">Genealogy of the Pepys Family, 1273&#150;1887</span>, 1887). They possess great charm. Richard is urged to be careful about money, advised to decline the office of constable, something &#145;never before put uppon a judge's son&#146;  (Pepys, 60), and warned against false friends: &#145;Pray have a care to avoyd flattering companions and such as will if they can insinuate into you, pretending with love and intending theire owne advantage&#146;  (Pepys, 59).<br>
<br>Pepys died in Dublin on 2 January 1659. Henry Cromwell, in reporting the news, described Pepys as &#145;a good councellor, &hellip; a good judge, and indeed a right honest man&#146;  (Thurloe, <span class="italic">State papers</span>, 7.590). Edward Worth, in his funeral sermon  (<span class="italic">The Servant Doing and the Lord Blessing</span>, 1659), was even more effusive in his praise, drawing attention, in particular, to Pepys's fairness and to the fact that during his period of service in Ireland he did nothing to feather his own nest: &#145;As a magistrate, he might say with Samuel, &#147;Whose ox or whose ass have I taken?&#148;&#146;  (<span class="roman">1 Samuel</span>, 8: 16). Pepys was buried at Christchurch Cathedral, Dublin. He was a cousin once removed of the diarist Samuel Pepys.<br>
