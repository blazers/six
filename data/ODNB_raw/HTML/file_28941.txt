<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Webster,  Benjamin</span>  (1798&#150;1882), <span class="occ">actor and theatre manager</span>, was born in Bath on 3 September 1798. His father, Benjamin Nottingham Webster (<i>c</i>.1760&#150;1836), whose middle name the younger Webster also sometimes used, came from Sheffield. The father, through whom Webster claimed descent from Sir George Buck or Buc, was at one time a musical &#145;composer&#146; and pantomimist; he married Elizabeth Moon of Leeds, joined the army, served in the West Indies, was engaged in Bath in organizing volunteer forces, and settled there as a dancing and fencing master. Benjamin Webster senior married three times and had twelve offspring. Apart from &#145;Ben&#146; and Frederick Vestris (1802&#150;1878), who became stage-manager of the Haymarket Theatre, Clara Webster, a ballerina, was the most theatrically distinguished. She died in 1843 at Drury Lane after her dress caught fire on stage.<h2>
<a name="Earlyactingcareer"></a>Early acting career</h2>After receiving some education at Dr Barber's naval academy in Bath, Webster had to abandon the chances of a promised commission as a midshipman from the duchess of York on his mother's death. He made his first appearance on the stage as a dancer in 1809 and assisted his father in his occupations. In 1815, however, he ran away from home, and obtained from the younger Watson at Cheltenham an engagement at 25 shillings a week to play Harlequin, small speaking parts, and second violin in the orchestra. He began his career as an actor as Thessalus in <span class="italic">Alexander the Great</span> at Warwick in 1818, and also played at Lichfield and Walsall races. He then joined in a sharing scheme with a manager called &#145;Irish&#146; Wilson, who fitted up a barn at Bromsgrove, where Webster (announced, with no apparent claim, as from the Theatre Royal, Dublin) doubled the parts of Sir Charles Cropland and Stephen Harrowby in Colman's <span class="italic">The Poor Gentleman</span>, danced a hornpipe, and played in his own dress, and with a head chalked to look like grey hair, Plainway in James Kenney's <span class="italic">Raising the Wind</span>. He then went as Harlequin to the Theatre Royal, Belfast, under Montague Talbot, acted in Londonderry and Limerick, and joined the Dublin company to play with it in Cork as Harlequin.<br>
<br>After appearing in Manchester and Liverpool Webster went to London, and played on 11 May 1818 a smuggler in <span class="italic">Trial by Battle</span>, the opening entertainment of the Coburg Theatre, later the Old Vic. According to a speech he made at a complimentary dinner given to him at the Freemasons' Tavern on 24 February 1864, he had at this time (in fact, in 1821) married a widow, Sophie West (1794&#150;1835), with a family of children. Webster became ballet master and walking gentleman at Richmond, then leader of the band at Croydon, which led to his engagement as dancer and walking gentleman under Beverley at the Tottenham Street Theatre, called many names before it became the Prince of Wales's. After a period at the English Opera House (the Lyceum), he accepted from Elliston an engagement at Drury Lane, where he appeared on 28 November 1820 as Almagro in <span class="italic">Pizarro</span>, and at Christmas played Pantaloon. At the end of the 1821&#150;2 season he joined Alfred Bunn's company at Birmingham, where he was seen in low-comedy parts, then acted at Sheffield, Newcastle, and Chester. He was re-engaged by Elliston for three seasons at Drury Lane in 1823 at more favourable rates than previously, but he also sought to consolidate his financial position by opening a newspaper and bookshop near the theatre. This was to become the base for a later play-publishing venture, the series <span class="roman">Webster's Acting National Drama</span>.<h2>
<a name="Growingreputation"></a>Growing reputation</h2>During a revival of <span class="italic">Measure for Measure</span> on 1 May 1824, John Harley, who played Pompey, was taken ill, and Webster took the part, and was promoted to the first green room, a significant rise in status. In this year he was the first Tuditanus in Sheridan Knowles's <span class="italic">Caius Gracchus</span>, and in 1825 the first Erni in <span class="italic">William Tell</span> by the same author. Although he gained some recognition, he was kept back by Elliston. The <span class="italic">Theatrical Inquisitor</span> of 1826 &#145;blamed the Drury Lane management for stifling a valuable talent&#146;.<br>
<br>It was about this time that Webster began writing plays, mostly short comic pieces and farces. Some thirty-eight of these are listed in <span class="italic">English Drama of the Nineteenth Century</span> (1985). Throughout the 1820s and 1830s Webster played regularly at Drury Lane and at the Haymarket, where he made his first appearance in 1829. At the same time he worked for other theatres as a playwright and stage-manager. In 1832 he was with Madame Vestris at the fashionable Olympic, where he played in Dance's <span class="italic">Kill or Cure</span> and in an adaptation by himself of <span class="italic">L'homme de soixante ans</span>. In the same year he managed the City Theatre in Cripplegate for a short season in association with Harriet Waylett. This experience gave him a taste for management, sharpened by the fact that conditions for actors at the patent houses had deteriorated under the tyranny of Alfred Bunn, who was by 1833 in charge of both Covent Garden and Drury Lane. Webster resorted to the Haymarket, where, in 1835, he and J. B. Buckstone were greatly praised for their performances as Dogberry and Verges in an otherwise disappointing production of <span class="italic">Much Ado About Nothing</span>, with Charles Kemble as Benedick.<br>
<br>In 1835 Sophie West Webster gave birth to a son, Benjamin, but she died several months later. Shortly afterwards Webster married Harriet Ireland (1816&#150;1862), who bore him a son, William, in 1836 and a daughter, Harriette, in 1838. In 1836 his father died.<h2>
<a name="ManagementattheHaymarket"></a>Management at the Haymarket</h2>In the following year Webster undertook the management of the Haymarket Theatre, which had a &#145;summer licence&#146; for the presentation of legitimate drama. He was proud that he began the venture supported solely by his own earnings and was not beholden to any financial backers. The advantage of the Haymarket in comparison with the patent houses of Drury Lane and Covent Garden was that it was small enough to allow the audience both to hear the actors and to see subtle changes in facial expression, so that the management did not have to rely on lavish and costly spectacle to attract the crowds. In an age when visual extravagances were <i>de rigueur</i>, Webster was criticized for his lack of interest in decoration, but it is to his credit that during his management he chose to present the highest standards of acting and writing that were available at the time.<br>
<br>From the first season, when Webster, with considerable bravado, successfully persuaded &#145;the eminent tragedian&#146; W. C. Macready to appear in his company, the Haymarket became known as the actors' theatre, which unashamedly operated a &#145;star&#146; system. Macready and his stage partner, Helen Faucit, appeared regularly, as did Mr and Mrs Charles Kean, the Keeleys, Louisa Nisbett, Julia Glover, Mary Warner, J. L. Toole, and Webster's friend and fellow comedian Buckstone. Madame Vestris and Charles Matthews found there a refuge from bankruptcy and the insults of the patent holders, and another welcome visitor was the American actress Charlotte Cushman. Three distinguished performers of the later nineteenth century were given their London d&eacute;buts by Webster: Tyrone Power, Samuel Phelps (later a rival manager at Sadler's Wells), and G. B. Shaw's favourite actor, Barry Sullivan. Acting standards were extremely high and Webster never fell into the managerial pitfall of casting himself in roles more suited to members of a brilliant company. He paid high salaries and, perhaps most importantly, seemed to have the knack of keeping his temperamental geniuses in order, if not always in good humour.<br>
<br>A further notable feature of Webster's Haymarket which encouraged the best of contemporary acting talent to join him was his serious commitment to the presentation of good new plays. At a time when the guardians of the &#145;national drama&#146; were frequently reduced to presenting animal and freak shows, crude melodrama, and adaptations by hack writers from the trivia of the Parisian stage, Webster actively encouraged contemporary playwrights and men of letters to submit work to him. Sadly, his great playwriting competition in 1843, when a prize of &pound;500 was offered for the best comedy, was a disaster, in that the winning piece, <span class="italic">Quid pro quo</span> by Catherine Gore, selected by a panel of distinguished judges including Charles Kemble, was booed from the stage, but there were a number of notable successes.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">The Bridal</span>, Sheridan Knowles's adaptation of Beaumont and Fletcher's <span class="italic">The Maid's Tragedy</span>, an excellent vehicle for Macready, consolidated the first season. Webster's faith in Bulwer-Lytton was vindicated by the success of <span class="italic">Money</span> in 1840, which had Macready in the leading role of Evelyn, Helen Faucit as Clara Douglas, and Webster in the comic part of Graves. Another nineteenth-century classic, <span class="italic">Masks and Faces</span> (1852), by Charles Reade and Tom Taylor, had Mary Ann Stirling in the leading part of Peg Woffington and Webster as the impoverished author Triplet, regarded by many as his finest performance.<br>
<br>At a time when playwrights were frequently exploited by actors and managers, Webster was highly respected for his fair dealings, particularly his willingness to offer advances on scripts (or even &#145;treatments&#146;) rather than delay payment until the piece's success was assured. The young Dion Boucicault was one such beneficiary. His <span class="italic">Love by Proxy</span>, <span class="italic">Alma Mater</span>, and <span class="italic">Curiosities of Literature</span> were all premi&egrave;red under Webster's management. By the time Webster left the Haymarket he claimed, no doubt with justification, to have spent over &pound;30,000 in encouraging dramatic writing.<br>
<br>The repertory of the Haymarket was distinguished largely by contemporary comedy, supplemented from time to time by farces by Buckstone and by Webster himself, but an innovatory excursion into the presentation of Shakespeare was made with the production of <span class="italic">The Taming of the Shrew</span> in 1844. Under the guidance of the antiquary J. R. Planch&eacute;, the play was presented in full, including the prologue, and the main action took place in the Lord's bedroom incorporating the basic features of an Elizabethan stage. The actors wore Elizabethan costume. On closer inspection this presentation owed more to the decorative aesthetic of Victorian <i>mise-en-sc&egrave;ne</i> than to the Shakespearian architectural and emblematic stage, but it may be seen as an interesting precursor to the reforms of William Poel some forty years later.<br>
<br>Webster's improvements to the Haymarket were not restricted to raising the standards of the repertory and the performances. As he remarked in his farewell speech in 1853, he had spent some &pound;12,000 in redesigning and refurbishing the auditorium: the angular balcony was replaced by an elegantly curved circle, the seats in the pit were backed, orchestra stalls were introduced, the proscenium arch was widened by 11 feet and remodelled, gas lighting was installed and a centre chandelier given to the proprietors, &#145;and behind the curtain money has not been spared to render the stage as perfect for dramatic representation as its limited means will furnish&#146;.<h2>
<a name="TheAdelphitheatre"></a>The Adelphi theatre</h2>In 1844 Webster had acquired the lease of the Adelphi, which he passed over to his long-term companion, the dancer <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4987/', "C&#233;line C&#233;leste (Madame C&#233;leste)")</script>, who had appeared in the 1838&#150;9 season at the Haymarket. In 1853 he joined her at the Adelphi and handed over the Haymarket lease to his old friend Buckstone. Webster gave Buckstone a valuable legacy. Even before the passing in 1843 of the <span class="roman">Theatre Regulation Act</span>, which broke the monopoly of Covent Garden and Drury Lane, he had played his part in the growing respectability of the stage, presenting a series of dramatic entertainments before the queen at Windsor in 1848&#150;9. He provided regular employment for both established actors and those at the beginning of their careers in good working conditions and in plays which exploited their talents. He had initiated touring with the entire company during the short time when the Haymarket was &#145;dark&#146;, another means of keeping the company together. A presentation by members of the company marked the extent of their appreciation of his achievement.<br>
<br>The new joint management of the Adelphi began in 1853 with Mack Lemon's farce <span class="italic">Mr Webster at Home</span>. Webster played Falstaff in a revival of <span class="italic">The Merry Wives of Windsor</span> in the same year. Early successes included <span class="italic">Two Loves and a Life</span> by Taylor and Reade (1854), Boucicault's <span class="italic">Janet Pride</span> (1855), and Taylor's <span class="italic">Helping Hand</span> (1855). C&eacute;leste won acclaim for her performance as a Watteauesque Harlequin. She was the first woman to attempt the part.<br>
<br>In 1859, in the new Royal Adelphi Theatre, erected on the site of the old house, Webster played Penn Holder, one of his greatest parts, in his own adaptation <span class="italic">One Touch of Nature</span>, and in the same year he was the original Robert Landry in Watts Phillips's <span class="italic">The Dead Heart</span>. This was a period of considerable controversy for Webster. Relations with C&eacute;leste became strained, leading to the severance of the partnership. <span class="italic">The Dead Heart</span> was thought by some to be plagiarized from Dickens's <span class="italic">A Tale of Two Cities</span>, or vice versa, and the old friends Webster and Dickens were (thankfully temporarily) estranged. Webster's financial problems were exploited, somewhat opportunistically, by his former prot&eacute;g&eacute; Boucicault, who, after his brilliant successes in America, returned to England with his three masterpieces, <span class="italic">The Colleen Bawn</span>, <span class="italic">Arragh-na-Pogue</span>, and <span class="italic">The Octoroon</span>. These were presented at the Royal Adelphi, but only on condition that their author had control of the theatre's artistic policy, leaving Webster as little more than a front-of-house manager. <span class="italic">The Colleen Bawn</span> (1860) was one of Queen Victoria's favourite plays; it ran for more than 230 performances in London and won acclaim in the provinces. But Webster, although he remained active in the Royal Adelphi management until 1872, never again exerted the managerial control he had previously enjoyed. A subsequent partnership with Chatterton failed on the grounds of his associate's extravagance.<h2>
<a name="Latecareer"></a>Late career</h2>On 1 November 1869 Webster opened as lessee of the Princess's Theatre, which he had long owned, playing in Byron's <span class="italic">The Prompter's Box</span>, and in April 1873 he played his last new role, Rodin the Jesuit in <span class="italic">The Wandering Jew</span>, adapted by Leopold Lewis.<br>
<br>In the 1860s Webster was closely associated with a philanthropic venture, the establishment of a royal dramatic college to provide funds and accommodation for elderly and infirm members of the profession. There was also talk of building a training school for actors, necessitated by the demise of the provincial stock companies. Both schemes were attempts to raise the social respectability of the theatrical profession. Webster promised stone for the building from his quarries in Wales, but neither scheme was implemented and his ownership of the Welsh quarries has never been proved.<br>
<br>In 1874 Webster was given his farewell benefit at Drury Lane. The piece was <span class="italic">The School for Scandal</span>, and all the principal living actors took part. Helen Faucit came out of retirement to play Lady Teazle, there was a recitation by the new star Henry Irving, and Mary Ann Keeley, a stalwart of the Haymarket comedy team, presented the cheque for &pound;2000, reputedly the largest sum ever to be raised by a Drury Lane benefit. Webster's last performance was for the benefit of his friend Buckstone, in 1877. The part was Graves in the production of <span class="italic">Masks and Faces</span> by the Bancroft management at the Prince of Wales's Theatre.<br>
<br>On his seventy-ninth birthday Webster remarried. The bride was 26-year-old Eleanor Phillips, who some months later bore him a son. Neither was mentioned in contemporary obituaries and biographies. Webster, nicknamed the Nestor of the Stage, died at his home, 3 Church Side, Kennington, Lambeth, on 8 July 1882.<h2>
<a name="Legacyandreputation"></a>Legacy and reputation</h2>Webster left two sons connected with the stage. Ben Webster the younger wrote the one-act farce <span class="italic">Behind Time</span> for the Adelphi in 1865; seven other farces or adaptations from the French came from his pen between that date and 1873. John Webster, his stepson, a juvenile star whose success did not last, played about 1837 and 1838 at Covent Garden, the Haymarket, the St James's, and the Adelphi. Webster's daughter Harriette married Sir Edward Lawson, bt, proprietor and editor of the <span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span>. Benjamin Webster, his grandson, was a well-known actor in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century. Together with his wife, Dame May Whitty, he acted in many of the plays of the &#145;new drama&#146; movement in London and in the repertory movement in the provinces. Their daughter, Margaret (Peggy) Webster, born in 1905, was an actress and director who found much success in the United States. Her book about the Webster dynasty, <span class="italic">The Same Only Different</span> (1969), is the most authoritative source on this distinguished theatrical family.<br>
<br>In his line as a character actor Webster stood foremost in his day. His greatest characters were Richard Pride, Robert Landry, Penn Holder, Triplet, Graves, Tartuffe, and Rodin in <span class="italic">The Wandering Jew</span>. He was happiest in characters in which serious purpose, puritanical fervour, and grim resolution were shown, and had not indeed more comedy than would serve like light points in a picture to indicate the gloom. He was a spirited manager so far as the engagement of good actors and the encouragement of playwrights was concerned, but was out of tune with the times in respect of stage mounting and the employment of supernumeraries. Any assessment of his career must nevertheless acknowledge that, however ephemeral his performances and however trivial his own dramatic writings, he was a theatre manager of vision and integrity keeping alive the English dramatic tradition at a time when it was sorely pressed.<br>
