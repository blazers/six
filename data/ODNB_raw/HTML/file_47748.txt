<span class="headword">Jenkin,  (Alfred) Kenneth Hamilton</span>  (1900&#150;1980), <span class="occ">social historian and industrial archaeologist</span>, was born at Green Lane, Redruth, Cornwall, on 29 October 1900, the only child of Alfred Hamilton Jenkin, solicitor (<i>d</i>. 1919), and his wife, Amy Louisa, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Keep. Born into a family connected with mining since the mid-eighteenth century, he took a special interest in the mines and mining people of his native county from an early age. He was educated privately, then at school in Stoke Bishop, at Sherborne School (one term), Clifton College, and University College, Oxford, graduating BA with second class honours in English in 1922 and BLitt in 1924 for a thesis on Richard Carew, the Cornish antiquary.<br>
<br>Settling in St Ives, Jenkin began freelance writing, lecturing, and broadcasting. His first book, <span class="italic">The Cornish Miner</span> (1927), established him as a historian and writer, and became a standard work. Numerous books and articles followed on various aspects of Cornish life and also on copper smelting and slate quarrying in Wales, salt production in Cheshire, bell founding in Loughborough, steel smelting in Sheffield, and coalmining from the Forest of Dean to Scotland. The result of many years of research and mine-walking led to his monumental <span class="italic">Mines and Miners of Cornwall</span> in 16 parts (1961&#150;70), <span class="italic">Wendron Tin</span> (1978), and two books on Devon mines.<br>
<br>On 15 July 1926 Jenkin married Luned Marion Jacobs (<i>b</i>. 1904), the second daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/34145/', "William Wymark Jacobs")</script>, the humorous writer. They had two daughters. The marriage was dissolved in 1939. On 22 January 1948 he married Elizabeth Elsie Lenton (<i>d</i>. 1977), formerly the wife of Stanley Lenton, and daughter of Clement Philip Le Sueur, shipping agent. Apart from absences while studying and a few months in London he lived all his life in Cornwall, in Redruth, St Ives, and Mullion, returning to Redruth in 1954. He died at Treliske Hospital, Truro, on 20 August 1980, and was buried beside his second wife in St Euny's parish churchyard, Redruth.<br>
<br>During a busy and active life Jenkin was a founder member of the Cornish gorsedd in 1928, and was given the bardic name of Lef Stenoryon, Voice of the Tinners. He helped to found the St Ives and Mullion Old Cornwall societies, as well as the Federation of Old Cornwall Societies, of which he was secretary and later president and life vice-president. He served on the council of the Royal Institution of Cornwall for half a century, during which time he became its president and life vice-president. In recognition of his devotion to historical research the council twice granted him the institution's Jenner medal. In 1935 he was a founder member of the Cornish Engines Preservation Society, now the Trevithick Society, and on his retirement in 1974 after long service on its committee he was awarded the Trevithick gold medal. In the 1950s, with others, he persuaded the Cornwall county council to set up a county record office, now one of the country's finest, serving on its committee until his death. In 1974 he became a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries. Finally, in 1978, as a recognition of his contribution to the literature and social and economic history of Cornwall and to Cornish scholarship, Exeter University conferred on him the honorary degree of DLitt.<br>
<br>A tall, spare figure, Jenkin was an accomplished and witty speaker, and a friendly and very likeable person. He was happy at any time to discuss matters Cornish, and to share his findings with others. He divided his great collection of books, manuscripts, and maps between the local studies library in Redruth, the Royal Institution of Cornwall Library, and the county record office, both in Truro, each of which has a collection bearing his name.<br>
