<span class="headword">Higginson,  Francis</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1586/7, <em>d.</em> 1630), <span class="occ">minister in America</span>, was baptized on 6 August 1586 (or possibly 1587) in Claybrooke, Leicestershire, the son of John Higginson, clergyman. He matriculated at St John's College, Cambridge, in 1602, and in 1609 moved to Jesus College, from which he graduated BA in 1610 and proceeded MA in 1613. In 1614 he was ordained deacon and then priest in the archdiocese of York. Tobie Mathew, archbishop of York, conferred on him the rectory of Barton in Fabis in 1615, but he was never inducted into the position. A strict conformist, Higginson resigned those posts in 1615 and obtained the living of Claybrooke. Later, he also preached at Belgrave, a neighbouring village. On 8 January 1616 at St Peter's, Nottingham, he married Anne Herbert (<i>d</i>. in or before 1640); they had nine children.<br>
<br>At some point between 1615 and 1627 Higginson fell under the influence of Arthur Hildersham, the suspended, and later imprisoned, nonconformist lecturer. However, he was tolerated by Bishop Williams of Lincoln until 1627, when he was deprived of his licence. Nevertheless, he was offered several other livings and was selected by the mayor of Leicester to be the city preacher, but he declined all offers. In 1628 proceedings in the court of high commission were apparently begun against Higginson, leading him in March to offer himself as minister to the Massachusetts Bay Company. In 1629 the governors of the company appointed him minister to one of their proposed settlements. With his family he sailed from Gravesend on 25 April 1629, and arrived in Salem harbour on 29 June. In early August their church was formed at Salem. Samuel Skelton was chosen minister and Higginson his assistant. Skelton and Higginson ignored the <span class="roman">Book of Common Prayer</span> and instituted a fairly strict discipline, leading some members of the new congregation to issue complaints against them. They denied that they were separating from the Church of England, but clearly began to lay out the principles of congregationalism.<br>
<br>Higginson kept a valuable journal of his voyage to New England. The journal was sent back to London in August 1629, although it was not published until the nineteenth century, when it appeared as <span class="italic">A True Relation of the Last Voyage to New England</span>. Soon after his arrival he wrote a long letter to &#145;some friends&#146; in England, which was refashioned into a pamphlet entitled <span class="italic">New England's plantation, or, A short and true description of the commodities and discommodities of that countrey</span> (1630) and went through three editions by the year's end.<br>
<br>Higginson contracted what contemporaneous sources refer to as &#145;a fever&#146; in the summer of 1630, and died on 6 August. His widow, Anne, inherited the estate, which consisted mostly of undeveloped acreage in the Salem area. She died before 25 February 1640.<br>
<br>Their eldest son, <a name="cosubject_13239"></a><span class="headword">John Higginson</span>  (1616&#150;1708), was also a <span class="occ">minister in America</span>. He did not receive a formal university education (Harvard College not being founded until 1636) but nevertheless trained for the ministry under the supervision of John Cotton and others. He served as a schoolmaster and assistant pastor until, in 1659, he became the pastor of the Salem church which his father had settled. He took an active part in the discussion surrounding the &#145;halfway covenant&#146; in New England in the 1660s and beyond. He died at Salem on 9 December 1708.<br>
<br>His younger brother <a name="cosubject_13238"></a><span class="headword">Francis Higginson</span>  (1618&#150;1673), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, returned to England some time after 1630, was ordained, and became vicar of Kirkby Stephen, Westmorland. He was buried there on 20 May 1673.<br>
