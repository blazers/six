<span class="headword">Couch, Sir  Richard</span>  (1817&#150;1905), <span class="occ">judge</span>, was born on 17 May 1817, the only son of Richard Couch of Bermondsey, London. Educated privately, he entered as a student of the Middle Temple on 10 January 1838, and was called to the bar on 15 January 1841. In 1844 he assisted in editing Blackstone's <span class="italic">Commentaries</span> (21st edn). In 1845 he married Anne (<i>d</i>. 1898), eldest daughter of Richard Thomas Beck of Combs, Suffolk; they had one son, Richard, who later became a barrister of the Middle Temple. For some years Couch practised on what was then the Norfolk circuit, and he was recorder of Bedford from 1858 to 1862. In the last year he became a judge of the high court of Bombay and on the retirement of Sir Matthew Sausse in 1866 he succeeded to the chief justiceship of the court and was knighted. In 1870 he succeeded Sir Barnes Peacock as chief justice of the high court of Calcutta. In 1875 Couch was appointed president of the commission of inquiry into the charge brought against Malharrao Gaikwad, the ruler of the major Indian state of Baroda, of poisoning the representative of the Bombay government at Baroda, Colonel Robert Phayre. The matter was an extremely sensitive one, as many Indians believed that Malharrao was being victimized by the colonial rulers. Also, the government of India, based in Calcutta, was seeking to utilize the crisis to extend its direct control over the princely states of the Bombay Presidency. The commission consisted of three British commissioners and three Indians, and in their verdict they were divided along those lines, the former, led by Couch, finding Malharrao guilty of the crime, the latter insisting on his innocence. The government of India promptly ignored the commission, deposed Malharrao, and, in 1876, took responsibility for dealing with Baroda State. By then, Couch had already resigned the chief justiceship. On his return to England he was sworn of the privy council, and in January 1881 he was appointed to the judicial committee as one of the two members who had experience of judicial work in the colonies. He acted in this capacity for twenty years, providing clear and sound, but hardly brilliant, judgments. He was elected a bencher of his inn in March 1881. He died at his residence, 25 Linden Gardens, Bayswater, London, on 29 November 1905, and was buried at Paddington cemetery.<br>
