<span class="headword">Pole,  Henry</span>, Baron Montagu  (1492&#150;1539), <span class="occ">nobleman and convicted traitor</span>, was the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/75344/', "Sir Richard Pole (1458/9&#150;1504)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22451/', "Pole, Margaret")</script>] and his wife, Margaret Plantagenet (1473&#150;1541) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22451/', "Pole, Margaret")</script>], daughter of George, duke of Clarence, and later countess of Salisbury. He may have been a royal ward after his father's death in 1504, but is first certainly recorded as one of Katherine of Aragon's attendants at her coronation. He was probably in the royal household for several years thereafter, as he was given gowns in the next three years; on the last occasion he is identified as a &#145;sewer&#146;. In May 1513 he and his mother gave bonds to pay for the lands that she had acquired along with the title of countess of Salisbury. On 5 July he received livery of his father's lands, especially the Buckinghamshire manor of Medmenham, which included what would be his own principal residence of Bockmer. On 25 September he was knighted at Tournai. By 1514 Pole had unofficially acquired the title of Lord Montagu. Before 1520 he married Jane, daughter of George Neville, third Baron Bergavenny. Her father required a jointure worth &pound;200 per annum, and moreover Pole was to pay 1000 marks if he had no male children, but if a son was born, then Bergavenny would give Pole's mother the same amount. This marriage linked Pole with Bergavenny's father-in-law Edward Stafford, third duke of Buckingham, and they often gambled together. When Buckingham was arrested in 1521, so was Pole, but he was imprisoned only briefly, and escorted Charles V during part of the emperor's visit to England in 1522. They had met for the first time at Gravelines in 1520 after the Field of Cloth of Gold.<br>
<br>In 1523 Pole joined the invasion of France, which must have taxed his finances. He was repaid &pound;133 6<i>s</i>. 8<i>d</i>. the following year for his expenditure on equipment for demi-lances, and in 1527 he was exempted from the surcharge on the subsidy of 1523 because his goods were worth less than &pound;50. He continued to hold Medmenham, even though he was never nominated to the commission of the peace for Buckinghamshire. Instead, he regularly served as a JP in Dorset, Hampshire, Somerset, Sussex, and Wiltshire. On 1 December 1529 he entered the House of Lords as Baron Montagu, and in 1530 signed the English nobility's letter to Clement VII asking him to grant Henry's divorce. Perhaps late in the same year he may have conveyed to the king the willingness of his brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22456/', "Reginald Pole")</script> to compromise over the divorce; he was certainly involved in trying to control the damage after Reginald changed his mind in the early summer of 1531 and gave the king a written opinion opposing the divorce.<br>
<br>In July 1531 Montagu entered into articles for the marriage of his daughter Katherine to Francis, Lord Hastings, son of the first earl of Huntingdon. The match took place, but Montagu had to settle with Huntingdon in March 1538 for breaking the agreement, although this may also have had to do with Huntingdon's having mortgaged part of his inheritance. In October 1532 he was at Calais during Henry's interview with Fran&ccedil;ois I. Evidence gathered during investigations in 1538 alleged that he had smuggled his brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22447/', "Sir Geoffrey Pole")</script> to the meeting of the kings and afterwards sent him to tell Queen Katherine that nothing had been done to forward the proposed marriage to Anne Boleyn. Nevertheless at Anne's coronation on 1 June 1533 Montagu acted as her carver. Four days later, however, he, Lord Hastings, and Sir Geoffrey dined with Princess Mary, and Montagu alone on 24 June. He was summoned by writ to parliament in January 1534, and attended regularly. He also became close to Lord Lisle. On 9 July 1534 he served on the jury that acquitted Lord Dacre of treason.<br>
<br>Montagu was now appearing as a significant figure in the dispatches of the imperial ambassador Eustace Chapuys. It is possible that Cromwell was making use of Montagu when the latter told Chapuys in early July of the French king's warning to Henry VIII not to attack either the pope or Catholicism at a meeting of the two monarchs planned to take place at Calais, but Henry Pole's importance is none the less stressed in a further dispatch of 3 November 1534, recommending that Charles use Reginald Pole against England. In February 1535 Chapuys reported how it was to Montagu that the duke of Norfolk complained of being held in no esteem. Nevertheless, on 29 April Montagu served on the special commission of oyer and terminer that tried the Carthusian priors and others, and on a similar commission on 1 July for the trial of Sir Thomas More. Almost immediately afterwards he fell ill and was expected to die, but recovered after a fortnight. During the time Reginald was writing <span class="italic">De unitate</span>, his attack on Henry VIII's divorce and the royal supremacy, in late 1535 and 1536, Montagu continued to forward his brother's interests at court. Consequently he probably really was as shocked and disappointed when the work arrived, as he told Reginald in his letter of 13 September 1536, urging his brother &#145;If there is any grace in you, now you will turn to the right way, and then we may reckon it was the will of God that your ingratitude should show the King's meekness&#146;  (<span class="italic">LP Henry VIII</span>, 11, no. 451). For a man who had been working hard to advance his family at court (whatever his possible reservations about royal policy), the book must have been a heavy blow.<br>
<br>Montagu's status as a noble who could be employed on important juries was reinforced by the trial of Anne Boleyn in May 1536. He may have helped to prepare the way for it by joining the court faction that wished to get rid of her, and certainly told Chapuys in March 1536 that Henry might want a new wife. On 15 May Pole served on the jury that convicted Anne, and perhaps through his mother quickly entered into Jane Seymour's good graces. In July Chapuys reported that Princess Mary would never marry an Englishman, save maybe Reginald Pole or Montagu's son Henry. Montagu attended the parliament of June&#150;July, and his finances had improved enough to place him among the first to pay their subsidy assessments in full. Perhaps through official channels, he received copies of his brother's later correspondence with Bishop Cuthbert Tunstall of Durham, and saw other letters to the king and Cromwell. Cromwell later blamed Montagu's downfall chiefly on this correspondence. He was summoned to serve against the Pilgrimage of Grace with 200 men, but probably did not take the field. A year later he uncovered the basin at Edward's baptism, and at Queen Jane's funeral he attended Princess Mary in her capacity as chief mourner. In early 1538, however, his family's economic fortunes may once more have declined, for he and his mother made several sales of land.<br>
<br>In October 1538, with the arrest of his younger brother Sir Geoffrey, Montagu found himself in deep trouble, but it is difficult to reconcile many of the accusations against him with the public record of his loyalty. One cause of suspicion was his close friendship with Henry Courtenay, marquess of Exeter, who had even warned Montagu to keep his distance. Nearly all the damaging testimony came from Sir Geoffrey and one of his former dependants (curiously enough, the obviously unstable Sir Geoffrey, whom Montagu had done all he could to protect, accused his brother of being dangerously indiscreet). Two summaries of the evidence against Montagu contain a very mixed bag of charges. They stress his knowledge of moves against Reginald and of contacts with him, the burning of correspondence, his frequently reported fear that there would soon be no honest men left, his statement that Henry's leg would kill him, and his criticizing Lord Darcy for having held back from attacking Henry, as well as his observation that the king never made anyone whom he did not later destroy. Montagu's payment of his brother's debts in order to keep him from fleeing was also (rather oddly) thought suspicious. Exculpatory evidence, especially his mother's claim that he had advised her to tell her servants that Reginald was a traitor, was ignored.<br>
<br>The formal indictments more straightforwardly reveal the grounds on which Montagu was prosecuted. The opening charge accused him of favouring Reginald's treason, supported by a quotation reported by Sir Geoffrey&#151;allegedly in late 1536 just when other evidence shows Montagu sharply rebuking Reginald&#151;that &#145;I like well the doings of my brother the Cardinal, and I would we were both over the sea, for this world will one day come to stripes&#146;, as well as other <i>bons mots</i> at Henry's expense, including &#145;Knaves rule about the king&#146;  (<span class="italic">LP Henry VIII</span>, 13/2, no. 979.7). His indictment in Sussex added the further charge that Montagu had regretted Lord Bergavenny's death before the Pilgrimage of Grace. One witness said that Montagu thought Bergavenny could have raised 10,000 men in the west, another reported that he had said Bergavenny had a large following in Kent and Sussex; these and many similar inconsistencies raise doubts about much of the evidence. Under examination, Montagu said that he wished Bergavenny had not died for his son's sake, and otherwise admitted only having talked to Thomas Starkey about the moves against Reginald, and having burnt letters. Despite this stalwart defence, on 2 December 1538 he was found guilty of high treason, and on 9 January 1539 he and Exeter were beheaded on Tower Hill.<br>
<br>Montagu's name appeared in the giant bill of attainder of 19 May 1539, in terms which again make it clear that his condemnation arose from Reginald Pole's resistance and hostility to the king. His own career has usually been construed as that of a man who was involved in opposition to Henry VIII from an early stage. But the evidence suggests that if he opposed the king at all he did so late and out of disappointment with Henry's treatment of the nobility (including, of course, his brother Reginald), and that it was the mischance of the possibly demented behaviour of his brother Geoffrey that was principally responsible for Montagu's destruction.<br>
