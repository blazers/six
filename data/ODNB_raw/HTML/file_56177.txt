<span class="headword">Cooke,  William</span>  (1807/8&#150;1886), <span class="occ">circus manager</span>, was the second son of Thomas Taplin Cooke (1782&#150;1866) and Mary Ann (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Thorpe). He was twice married. His first wife was Mary Ann Spicer (1808/9&#150;1874); they had five children, the eldest of whom, William Henry (1833/4&#150;1905), became an important partner in his business affairs from the 1850s. His second wife was Sarah Saunders, with whom he had two children.<br>
<br>Between 1853 and 1860 Cooke managed Astley's Amphitheatre in London, continuing its long-established equestrian tradition by producing circus entertainments. At Astley's he earned recognition for producing Shakespearian plays, such as <span class="italic">Macbeth</span> and <span class="italic">Richard III</span>, as equestrian dramas. In addition to managing the London house at this period, Cooke also ran a company that toured the provinces during the &#145;tenting season&#146;. The 1858 season was a notable failure for him and his tenting company as they sought to rival a visiting American horse-tamer by demonstrating before provincial audiences the secrets of horse-taming; suspicion was aroused by these so-called secrets in communities such as Norwich and Cheshire where a sound knowledge of horse-taming prevailed, at least among grooms. Cooke's financial position at this stage is unclear, but there is some speculation that he steadily lost money during his years as manager of Astley's. In 1860 he retired from the management of Astley's and the report in <span class="italic">The Era</span> gives an indication of the negative market forces affecting Cooke and possibly other impresarios in the 1850s:<blockquote>we are not in Mr Cooke's confidence and are therefore ignorant of the cause which induces him to retire from the position which he has held with such credit to himself &hellip; but with all the spirit and skill as a manager, it is not difficult in these free trade days to perceive what anxiety and responsibility must attend the conduct of a high priced and restricted theatre, whose lessee, unable to meet the economy of the times, is compelled to keep up exclusive and protectionist prices. (<span class="italic">The Era</span>, 5 Feb 1860, 11)</blockquote>After his retirement from Astley's, Cooke established the Victoria Riding Establishment in Church Road, Wimbledon.<br>
<br>Cooke's other major achievement was his role in creating the first equestrian friendly society, the Dramatic Equestrian and Musical Agency and Sick Fund Association, a society established in 1855 on the progressive principle, common among other such organizations in this period, of &#145;sooth[ing] the hours of sickness, accident, and old age while elevat[ing] the profession&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Era</span>, 29 July 1855, 10). The agency was important since it provided for performers who were traditionally excluded from those friendly societies set up by established theatres, such as Drury Lane and Covent Garden, and by the Actors' Benevolent Fund which catered to the &eacute;lite of the acting profession. As such it was resorted to by employees of the circus, who could afford its relatively reduced subscription rates. In addition to being a founder member of the organization, Cooke sat on its board of trustees for many years, and was appointed a life governor along with his first wife, Mary Ann. Cooke died at the age of seventy-eight at his residence, 149 Acre Lane, Brixton, on 6 May 1886. He was survived by his second wife.<br>
