<span class="headword">Fry,  Joan Mary</span>  (1862&#150;1955), <span class="occ">relief worker and social reformer</span>, was born on 27 July 1862 at West Hill, Highgate, Middlesex, the second daughter of the seven daughters and two sons of the judge <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/33283/', "Sir Edward Fry (1827&#150;1918)")</script> and his wife, Mariabella Hodgkin (1833&#150;1930). Her distinguished younger siblings included <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/33286/', "(Sara) Margery Fry")</script>, Ruth Fry (1879&#150;1962), and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/33285/', "Roger Eliot Fry")</script>, whose children she helped to bring up. She was educated by governesses at home (1867&#150;82) within a family that was especially interested in the natural sciences and questions of political justice, and she was imbued with a profound dedication to moral duty. In certain ways her upbringing was very restricted&#151;by its upper-class privilege, by the Victorianism that prevented her from walking anywhere unaccompanied or unchaperoned until she was thirty, and by an internalized Quaker puritanism that forbade any visit to the theatre until she was sixty. Nevertheless, she emerged from that background an independent-minded spiritual &#145;seeker&#146; and an immensely influential social interventionist.<br>
<br>After years of solitary study&#151;she taught herself some Hebrew and <span class="roman">New Testament</span> Greek&#151;Joan Fry became an outstanding public interpreter of a Quakerism that combined fellowship and individual freedom. In her Swarthmore lecture, <span class="italic">The Communion of Life</span> (1910), she said: &#145;Quakerism is nothing unless it be &hellip; a practical showing that the spiritual and material spheres are not divided, &hellip; the whole of life is sacramental and incarnational&#146;. In <span class="italic">Friends and the War</span>, published in September 1914, she wrote: &#145;We believe there is something Divine in all men, which will respond <i>if</i> we call it out by acting on our belief&#146;. An absolutist pacifist, she was appointed chaplain to imprisoned conscientious objectors during the First World War. She also attended many military tribunals and courts martial of conscientious objectors to check that justice was done. She was the only woman allowed to see and speak to these prisoners in military camps, and in one case at least she protested against a prisoner's mistreatment only just in time to save his life  (F. Brockway, <span class="italic">Bermondsey Story</span>, 1949, 67).<br>
<br>In July 1919 Joan Fry and three other British Friends went to defeated Germany to see how they could mitigate the disastrous impact of the continued allied blockade. Her reports, for dissemination in Britain (later deposited in RS Friends, Lond.), testify to famine and the diseases of famine, including galloping consumption and epidemics of child rickets and pneumonia. In the face of Germany's distrust and outright hatred of the victorious British she organized so massive and effective a relief distribution network, focusing on the needs of women, children, and university students, that the Germans coined a new word for feeding&#151;&#145;Quakern&#146;. During the occupation of the Ruhr in 1923 she reported seeing French officers walking about Duisburg with whips, and intervened on behalf of Germans imprisoned by the French military. She visited the Berlin workhouse and refuge for the homeless in September 1923 and in the following month in N&uuml;rnberg she recorded seeing &#145;7 men in the new &#147;Hitler&#148; uniform&#146;. In acknowledgement of her efforts for peace and reconstruction in defeated Germany the University of T&uuml;bingen made her an honorary doctor of political economy in 1924.<br>
<br>In 1926 Joan Fry turned her attention to social misery in Britain. She made many visits to the coalfields, including those in south Wales, and helped to start feeding centres for the children of unemployed miners and to encourage small community self-help industries. Her greatest contribution was her work for the Friends Allotment Committee (1928&#150;51), which enabled the unemployed miners throughout Britain to grow vegetables on unused land without losing any part of their dole. George V wanted to confer an honour on her in recognition of this work but she refused to profit from others' misfortune. Joan Fry was not tall but she had a remarkable &#145;presence&#146; and was &#145;austere and tender&#146;  (Fawell, 7), with white hair, one humorous, loving eye&#151;she had lost the other in early childhood&#151;and an eagerness to join in the good things of life with others, especially children: she would win races against them at ninety. She died, unmarried, at her London home, 40 Temple Fortune Hill, on 25 November 1955 and was cremated at Golders Green.<br>
