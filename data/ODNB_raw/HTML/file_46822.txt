<span class="headword">Clutton,  John</span>  (1809&#150;1896), <span class="occ">surveyor</span>, was born at Hartswood, Reigate, Surrey, the third of the four sons and six daughters of William Clutton (1745/6&#150;1839) of Hartswood and his second wife.<br>
<br>John Clutton's grandfather, also William Clutton (1740&#150;1826), was the third son of Ralph Clutton (1695&#150;1761), vicar of Horsted Keynes, Sussex. This grandfather married Sarah, only surviving child of Robert Chatfield (1698&#150;1780), of Cuckfield, Sussex, surveyor, and later took over his father-in-law's practice, which included the agency for the Sussex estates of Henry Smith's Charity. This business was conducted from William Clutton's home, the Jacobean house Ockenden, Cuckfield, which he leased from the Burrell family, one of the trustees of the charity; in the next generation it was moved to Hartswood, an estate of several hundred acres purchased by John Clutton's father.<br>
<br>John Clutton was educated at Cuckfield grammar school, of which he remarked in later life &#145;at this place I learnt little good&#146;  (Clutton, 3); it was intended that he should be articled to a solicitor but in 1826 he was called home to join his father's firm, whose affairs had fallen into confusion. His elder brother Robert (1801&#150;1877), who had been formally articled to a surveyor in Maidenhead, was called back at the same time; he sorted out the muddled accounts, put the practice back on its feet, and remained in charge of the original family business for the rest of his life. John's next brother, Ralph (1804&#150;1886), became vicar of Saffron Walden, Essex; his younger brother, Henry (1814&#150;1895), was articled to the architect Decimus Burton, but his tastes were more agricultural than architectural and about 1856 he gave up his architecture in order to join John's independent surveying business.<br>
<br>In 1837 John Clutton married Elizabeth, daughter of George Spencer Smith, and moved to London to set up in practice on his own account. The move was helped by the legacy of &pound;3000 which he received on his father's death, but it was prompted, and indeed necessitated, by the sudden growth of a large volume of surveying business negotiating land purchases for railway construction, business in which a location close to parliament where railway bills were determined was most desirable. His introduction to railway land purchasing came from the South Eastern Railway, whose line originally started from Reigate; eventually he was responsible, as chief land agent, for acquiring all the land and house property for the entire 120 miles of its route. Similar work for the London, Brighton, and South Coast Railway, which also passed through Reigate, followed, but by this time he and his wife had set up house in Parliament Street, London, which also served as his office. By the late 1830s his reputation as a skilful valuer, negotiator, and arbitrator in railway business was growing. He acted for other companies, notably the Eastern Counties Railway, and in 1845 was a key expert witness before the select committee of the House of Lords on compensation for lands taken by railways, from which stemmed the important procedural legislation of the <span class="roman">Land Clauses Consolidation Act</span> and the <span class="roman">Railway Clauses Consolidation Act</span> in 1845.<br>
<br>Two strokes of good fortune enabled Clutton to diversify. In 1845 he became agent for the Kensington estate of Henry Smith's Charity on the death of the architect George Basevi, who had been the surveyor appointed to lay out that estate for building development (the agency of the country estate remaining with Robert and the Reigate office). Two years earlier Decimus Burton had introduced him to Charles Knight Murray, secretary to the newly established ecclesiastical commissioners, who commissioned Clutton to handle the first case under the <span class="roman">Ecclesiastical Leases Act</span> of 1842 of a proposal to grant a building lease of church land. From this followed, in 1845, the commission to conduct a survey, valuation, and report on all the lands and properties of the ecclesiastical commissioners in the southern half of England and Wales. When completed over the next decade this survey formed the first systematic and comprehensive description and account of church lands since the interregnum. It also made Clutton the obvious choice as regular agent for the southern estates of the church, an agency retained by the firm into the 1990s. The work quickly assumed a gigantic character, so that Clutton took on a staff of assistants (one of them Edward James Smith, who later became principal agent for the northern estates of the ecclesiastical commissioners, and president of the Institution of Surveyors, 1876&#150;8) and clerks. His greatly enlarged office moved from Parliament Street to 8 Whitehall Place. The new premises, to which the adjoining no. 9 was soon added, for a time served as the family home as well, but in 1859 the family took a house in fashionable Bayswater, at 3 Sussex Square. Clutton found the daily walk to the office and back very good for his health, while saying that the house &#145;is rather too expensive, for it is not probable that I shall have such continued success&#146;  (Clutton, 5).<br>
<br>The &#145;continued success&#146; referred to the addition of crown estate business to that of the ecclesiastical commissioners. Clutton seems to have owed his connection with the crown estate to the influence of James White Higgins, with whom he had formed a close friendship when they were both engaged in land purchase negotiations for the South Eastern Railway. Higgins introduced Clutton to Alexander Milne, second commissioner of woods and forests, in 1848 when a select committee on woods, forests, and the land revenues of the crown was being set up. Clutton was at once commissioned to report on the condition of New Forest and the Forest of Dean, and gave evidence to the select committee. His grasp of the intricacies of rights and encroachments in royal forests, and of the business of woodland management, was impressive. In 1850 he was appointed crown receiver (agent) for Surrey, and this extended the following year to the receivership for all the midland and southern English counties, to which Norfolk and Suffolk were later added. Clutton thus became the reigning woodland expert of the day, with the agency for 47,000 acres of crown lands which he held until 1889; his last public act was to give evidence to the 1890 select committee on woods, forests, and land revenues of the crown. On his advice the disafforestations of Hainault (1852), Whittlewood (1856), and Wychwood (1857) were carried out, policies which were strongly criticized with the hindsight of the 1880s and 1890s for creating unwanted extra agricultural acreage at great expense, although at the time grubbing up neglected and mismanaged woodland seemed the best course.<br>
<br>Coupled with some large commissions for acquiring land for camp sites and training areas for the War Office, Clutton's career was thus largely in the public service, although he was always remunerated by percentage commissions and never became a salaried civil servant. He kept some private clients and these became relatively more important to the firm of Cluttons, as it was styled from the 1850s, after his retirement. With an income approaching &pound;20,000 a year by the early 1870s John Clutton was a wealthy man, at the head of his profession in wealth as well as in reputation. He became a member of the Royal Agricultural Society in 1838, was elected to the exclusive Land Surveyors' Club in 1839, and was recruited as an associate of the Institution of Civil Engineers in 1848. In March 1868 he took the lead in arranging a meeting of influential surveyors at the Westminster Palace Hotel, favourite rendezvous of railway valuers and arbitrators, which led to the foundation of the Institution of Surveyors, of which he was elected first president.<br>
<br>Clutton recorded little about his wife beyond writing that &#145;my marriage has been one of unvaried good, and my good wife is a pattern to all women&#146;  (Clutton, 5). He was wealthy enough to send all his four sons to Harrow. The youngest, Hubert (1850&#150;1905), became a solicitor, while the other three entered the firm. The eldest, Robert George (1839&#150;1907), more or less gave up going to the office after his father died, and retired to the south of France, but the other two, Ralph (1843&#150;1912) and John Henry (1844&#150;1927), were competent and diligent surveyors who maintained the family business as one of the leading firms in the country. John Henry, who was in charge of the country estates of both church and crown, unfortunately fell out with the Liberal president of the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries, Lord Carrington, in 1906, by telling him to his face that he had a misguided enthusiasm for smallholdings. As a result the crown receivership for the southern agricultural estates was taken away from Cluttons and given to Carter Jonas, Lord Carrington's own agent. Later one of John Clutton's grandsons, Brian Clutton (1884&#150;1938), more than made amends by securing the firm's appointment as surveyors for the crown's London estates in 1927. John Clutton's only daughter, Katherine, also helped to sustain the continuity of the family firm, as her grandson Bernard Marr-Johnson (1871&#150;1945), was articled to Cluttons in 1892 and became a partner in 1901, to be followed into the firm in turn by his own son, Kenneth Marr-Johnson. In the 1990s several of Clutton's direct descendants were partners in the firm, including two of his great-grandsons.<br>
<br>Clutton was an unassuming, unpretentious, but firm-willed man. Lacking in eloquence himself, and neither speaking nor writing with fluency or ease, he paid scant attention to the rhetoric of expert witnesses or counsel when acting in arbitration cases. He disliked the atmosphere of parliamentary committee rooms, where he frequently appeared, because of the dominance of rhetoric over reason, and sometimes showed his impatience. The story runs that on one occasion in cross-examination (although this cannot be traced in any of the printed proceedings of the select committees to which he gave evidence) he was asked: &#145;Are you infallible, Mr Clutton? Do you never make mistakes?&#146; &#145;Oh yes,&#146; he replied, &#145;more than most men.&#146; And, after a pause, &#145;but then, I do more business than most men&#146;  (Rogers, 495).<blockquote>What he did possess, and that to an extraordinary degree, was the solid practical business faculty, in union with a calm temperament, great sobriety of judgment, a firm will, and a large amount of natural caution; these were the principal qualities which he brought to the building up of his vast business. (Rogers, 495)</blockquote>Clutton told the 1845 select committee on compensation for lands taken by railways: &#145;I do not know of any process by which you can prevent a rich man taking advantage of his position&#146;  (&#145;Select committee &hellip; public railways&#146;, 124&#150;7). He himself took little advantage of his own position as a rich man until he was into his sixties, when he eased up on work and took to renting some of the best shooting in Scotland, and at other times sporting seats and large residential houses in England, notably Tyringham House, Newport Pagnell. He acquired a farm at Flanchford, on the River Mole near Reigate, and was at his happiest in these rural surroundings walking over his land and going round his farm buildings. He died there, at his home, Woodhatch House, on 1 March 1896.<br>
