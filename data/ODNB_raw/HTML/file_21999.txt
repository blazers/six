<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Perry,  Stephen Joseph</span>  (1833&#150;1889), <span class="occ">astronomer</span>, was born on 26 August 1833 in London, the son of Stephen Perry, a steel pen-nib manufacturer of Red Lion Square, Holborn. As an infant he was seriously ill with inflammation of the brain, and his mother died when he was seven. He was educated by the Benedictines, first at Giffords Hall, Suffolk, then at St Edmund's College, Douai, in France. There he developed a vocation for the priesthood, and he went to the English College at Rome for his theological studies. His sister, who was in a convent, had lent him a life of St Ignatius to read, and this may have reinforced his decision to enter the Society of Jesus on 12 November 1853. In 1856 he went to Stonyhurst College for training in philosophy and physical science. His mathematical ability led to his being appointed assistant to Father Weld in the observatory; he matriculated in 1858 at the University of London, studied mathematics for a year under Augustus De Morgan, then went to Paris for training in higher mathematics and natural philosophy. On his return to Stonyhurst in 1860, he was appointed professor of mathematics and director of the observatory, but as he was obliged to spend the three years previous to his ordination, on 23 September 1866, at St Beuno's College, north Wales, followed by the Jesuits' customary two years' probation, he resumed his former duties only in 1868. He was a very able lecturer who usually illustrated his talks with lantern slides, and he was in constant demand to address not only learned societies, but artisans and working men in several towns and cities of northern England.<br>
<br>During the course of an exceptionally adventurous life, Perry &#145;undertook more astronomical expeditions than any man now living&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Observatory</span>, 13, 1890, 64). Terrestrial magnetism was another of his enduring interests, starting with his first magnetic surveys in France in 1868 and 1869 and in Belgium in 1871. His results, with magnetic data from Stonyhurst, were presented to the Royal Society, which elected him a fellow on 4 June 1874&#151;one of the few Catholic priests to be thus honoured; he later served on its council.<br>
<br>Perry was elected to the Royal Astronomical Society on 9 April 1869 and led its party sent to observe the solar eclipse of 22 December 1870 from San Antonio, near Cadiz, but cloud frustrated his intended work with the spectroscope. His next journey was to Kerguelen Island, in the Southern Ocean, to observe the transit of Venus across the sun's disc (8 December 1874). Again cloudy skies marred the value of both observations and photographs. The expedition remained a further five months in this desolate place in order to obtain its exact latitude, but on the way home Perry disembarked at Malta and was received by the pope at Rome. Despite being prone to seasickness, Perry led the party observing the second transit of Venus on 6 December 1882 from Madagascar, where they were favoured by good weather. Poor conditions again impeded his spectroscopic work during the solar eclipse of 19 August 1886, seen from the West Indies; the expedition to Pogost on the Volga, for the solar eclipse of 19 August 1887, was also fruitless, as dense cloud obscured the skies.<br>
<br>Perry's most valuable work was undoubtedly in the field of solar physics. He was quick to make use of two new scientific techniques: photography and spectroscopy. In 1879, with John Couch Adams of Cambridge and Charles Pritchard of Oxford, he served on a physics committee set up to secure a complete daily record of the sun's disc by photography. From 1880 he made daily drawings of sunspots, and was able to confirm Schwabe's postulated eleven-year sunspot cycle, as well as the correlation of sunspot activity with solar prominences, magnetic storms, and aurorae. In the field of general astronomy he found time to study planetary and lunar occultations and comets; these activities were in addition to his obligations to attend to his religious offices and to his daytime teaching.<br>
<br>In 1866 the Board of Trade selected Stonyhurst as one of the seven principal meteorological stations in Britain. The observatory was provided with photographic self-recording instruments, and it contributed its results both nationally and to local newspapers. Perry was a member of the Meteorological Society and on its council. The parliamentary commission of 1883 investigating water supplies also drew on his rainfall records.<br>
<br>Perry's last expedition was to French Guiana, for the solar eclipse of 21 December 1889. A similar expedition was dispatched to Angola, the intention being to see if the shape of the solar corona changed during the two and a half hours between its sighting at the two stations. Unfortunately this question was unanswered, as the Angolan sky did not clear. Perry was camped on one of the Salut Islands, where dysentery was rife in the nearby convict settlement; he contracted the ailment, which soon developed into gangrene of the bowel. Despite his severe illness, he managed to command operations during the 120 seconds of totality, even taking a few photographs. Afterwards he collapsed, and his mind began to wander. His colleagues took him on board ship, and he died six days later, on 27 December 1889.<br>
