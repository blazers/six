<span class="headword">Bales,  Peter</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1547, <em>d.</em> 1610?), <span class="occ">writing-master and calligrapher</span>, was baptized at St Michael Cornhill, London, on 15 June 1547. Parish records show that he was the eldest child of Thomas Bales of Birchin Lane, a draper and a citizen of London, and his wife, Elizabeth. According to the preface of Joseph Champion's <span class="italic">The Parallel</span> (1750), Bales had already begun to practise his art by 1559, when he was only twelve years old. Wood's <span class="italic">Athenae Oxonienses</span> provides information about the next stage of his career, linking his name to Gloucester Hall, Oxford, where it is most likely that he was a writing-master rather than a student. On 10 March 1575 his penmanship was brought to the attention of the court when he presented Queen Elizabeth with a gold and crystal ring, set with a specimen of his &#145;micrographical performance, in which the writing was so wonderfully small, yet so very legible, that it surprized all who saw it&#146;  (Kippis, 1.536). This virtuoso piece, which included, among other devotional texts, minute transcriptions of the <span class="roman">Credo</span>, the Lord's prayer, and the ten commandments, much impressed the queen, who is said to have worn the ring on many occasions.<br>
<br>While such marvellous calligraphic feats suggest a natural inclination towards flamboyance and self-promotion, the mainstay of Bales's career was in the rather more prosaic dissemination of &#145;swift&#146;, &#145;true&#146;, and &#145;fair&#146; writing. To this end, by 1590 he had set up a school near the sign of the Dolphin at the upper end of the Old Bailey, London, where some of the leading citizens sent their children. In an age before the wide-scale availability of printed texts Bales also offered his services as a scribe and a copyist in an advertisement that promised: &#145;you may have anything faire written in any kind of hand, usuall, and bookes of copies faire as you shall bespeake&#146;  (Heal, 9). He was evidently successful in this enterprise: in the 1580s and 1590s he was regularly commissioned to transcribe public documents into book form in his even, &#145;type-like lettering&#146;  (ibid.). According to the extensive memoir in the <span class="italic">Biographia Britannica</span> (1778), his connection with courtly circles also led him to become involved in Elizabethan espionage. Working alongside one Thomas Phillips&#151;whose job was to decipher the letters in code which were intercepted by Arthur Gregory, who could &#145;<i>unseal</i> a letter, and so dextrously <i>close</i> it again &hellip; that no eye could discern its having been opened&#146;  (Kippis, 1.536)&#151;Bales was employed either to transcribe their contents or to forge new letters and additional paragraphs to send on in their place. In a bid to secure himself a permanent position, Bales next attempted to gain a place at court; although he was unsuccessful in his efforts, it was around this time that he was appointed to the chancery as a clerk, a fact which is attested at the foot of another of his celebrated micrographical performances: a complete, hand-written <span class="roman">Bible</span> small enough to fit into a walnut shell.<br>
<br>Several events in Bales's life suggest that he was an innovative, rapacious, and competitive man. In 1590 he published <span class="italic">The Writing Schoolemaster</span>, one of the first engraved copybooks. Owing to an error by John Evelyn in his <span class="italic">Numismata</span> (1697), it has long been considered as the first work to present a system of ciphers as a form of shorthand. In fact, it was neither the first treatise on shorthand (that honour can be awarded to Timothy Bright for his <span class="italic">Characterie: an Art of Short Swift, and Secret Writing, by Character</span>, 1588) nor a full exposition on a new system of ciphers, as it was dependent on reducing full words into abbreviated longhand characters. Nevertheless, Bales was determined to profit from this publication, and his underhand dealings led to a lawsuit between the author and his publisher, Thomas Orwin, in which the former was found guilty of undercutting the publisher for his personal gain. His showmanship and competitiveness can be witnessed again in 1595, when, at the age of forty-eight, he challenged Daniel Johnson, a rival penman whose youthfulness assured him greater steadiness of hand, to a writing match for the prestigious prize of a golden pen valued at &pound;20. It was conducted in public at the &#145;Black Fryers within Conduit Yard&#146;, and the jury consisted of William Seager, a herald at arms; Anthony Dew and John Gwilliams, both clerks in the high court of chancery; William Pank, a penman in the court of London; and George Chapman, a gentleman. Under their judgement Bales and Johnson matched their talents for, as Bales put it, &#145;best and fairest writing of all kinde of handes &hellip; for Secretarie and Clerklike writing &hellip; [and] for best teachinge&#146;  (Heal, 9). Evidently Bales's hand was still steady, and his experience was pre-eminent; despite Johnson's publication of vociferous accusations of Bales's corruption in packing the jury with his friends, the golden pen was awarded to the older penman. By posting public placards returning Johnson's slur upon him, Bales proudly capitalized on his victory: in addition to renaming his premises &#145;the Hand and Golden Pen&#146;, he also wrote his own account of this public spectacle in a piece of penmanship entitled &#145;The original cause&#146; (1596/7, now Harl. MS 675, held in the British Library, London).<br>
<br>Bales's leading patrons at court in the 1570s and 1580s seem to have been Sir Francis Walsingham and Sir Christopher Hatton; their deaths in 1590 and 1591 respectively led him to concentrate his attention on Lord Burghley (<i>d</i>. 1598), who either then or earlier had made Bales his writing-master and penman. The last known facts of his life are remarkably eventful. During the later part of his career he was &#145;innocently engaged&#146; in the employment of John Danyell of Deresburie. This gentleman, one of the retinue of the earl of Essex, sought to improve his own fortunes by trying to sell some revealing letters, forged by Bales, to the earl's enemies. On being brought to trial at the Star Chamber for this crime Danyell was convicted on Bales's evidence, forced to pay damages totalling &pound;3000, sentenced to sit in pillory, and then imprisoned for life. Although Bales had also been incarcerated, during the trial he was eventually absolved of all guilt in Danyell's scheme to destroy the earl of Essex.<br>
<br>That Bales weathered the Danyell d&eacute;b&acirc;cle is clear from his advancement to the position of &#145;tutor to the late noble Prince Henry&#146;  (Heal, 9), which must have taken place early in the new reign. Although no research has been undertaken to support this conclusion, it seems possible that he owed both his survival and his promotion to Burghley's son, Robert Cecil, first earl of Salisbury, who served as principal minister in the last years of Elizabeth's reign and the beginning of James I's. With the premature death of Henry, prince of Wales, Bales's career is difficult to trace. In his <span class="italic">The Origins and Progress of Letters</span> (1763), William Massey assumed that he died before 1614; indeed no mention of Bales's name is known after 1610, when the writing-master John Davies of Hereford made a scathing reference to his rival with his &#145;golden Pen&#146; in a satiric verse entitled <span class="italic">The Scourge of Folly</span>. His reputation survived intact, however: by the late seventeenth century, his flamboyant character and idiosyncratic experiences had become a touchstone of virtuosity for later writing-masters, who often drew comparisons between themselves and this celebrated figure.<br>
