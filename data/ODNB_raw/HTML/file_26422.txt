<span class="headword">Stevens,  George Alexander</span>  (1710?&#150;1784), <span class="occ">actor and writer</span>, was born in Holborn, London. He was apprenticed to a trade by his father, a London tradesman, but ran away before his time was out and joined a troupe of strolling players. By 1741 he was acting at Norwich; he was playing lead parts by 1744; poems by him were published in the <span class="italic">Norwich Mercury</span> in 1743. By 1750 he was acting in Lincoln, about which time he married a fellow player, Elizabeth Herbert (<i>bap</i>. 1728, <i>d</i>. 1813), only daughter of the company manager. No children of the marriage have been traced. Stevens's <span class="italic">Religion, or, The Libertine Repentant: a Rhapsody</span>, is dated from Bath, 22 February 1751: it is not known whether he was in Bath to act or to cure the illness that had brought on this sadly confessional poem.<br>
<br>Between September 1751 and May 1753 Stevens acted at the Smock Alley Theatre in Dublin, where he performed small parts in the talented company gathered by Thomas Sheridan. Now a less repentant libertine, he co-founded the Nassau Court, a jovial club devoted to drinking, repartee, and mock trials. His mock-heroic poem <span class="italic">The Poet's Fall</span>, an epistle <span class="italic">A Week's Adventures</span>, an unacted burlesque <span class="italic">Distress upon Distress</span>, and <span class="italic">The Tombs, a Rhapsody</span> (product of another fit of religious seriousness), were all published in Dublin in 1752. His less ephemeral collection of 120 lyrics, <span class="italic">New Comic Songs</span>, appeared in 1753.<br>
<br>Stevens went to London, playing small parts at Covent Garden between November 1753 and May 1755, and writing songs and benefit speeches for the leading comedian Edward Shuter (1728?&#150;1776) and other performers. He joined several London drinking clubs and wrote convivial songs for them. It is said that he was a reckless practical joker and once threw a waiter out of a window and told the landlord to put him down on the bill. His heroi-comical poem, <span class="italic">The Birth-Day of Folly</span>, was published in 1754. In December of that year, following the lead of Samuel Foote and Christopher Smart, he began to give theatrical entertainments satirizing the famous orations of John Henley (1692&#150;1756), which vexed their target sufficiently for Henley to prosecute Stevens. It is not certain where Stevens spent the next six years, but it is likely that he was touring with his father-in-law's company and was frequently in debt. Three almost identical versions are recorded of an elaborate letter, one from Nottingham gaol, the others from Yarmouth gaol in which he was confined &#145;for a London debt&#146;; they are addressed to persons from whom Stevens had recently parted in, variously, Norwich, Lincoln, or Doncaster (<span class="italic">European Magazine</span>, 10, 1786, 274&#150;5; Highfill, Burnim &amp; Langhans, <span class="italic">BDA</span>, 271; Baker and Reed, 690&#150;91).<br>
<br>Between October 1761 and February 1764 Stevens was with the Drury Lane company under David Garrick; he played Falstaff in <span class="italic">The Merry Wives of Windsor</span>, but his other parts were fairly small. He was busier as an author than a player. In 1759 he published another <span class="italic">Collection of New Comic Songs</span>. His unsuccessful farce <span class="italic">The English Sailors in America</span> was performed four times between 1759 and 1761 in different versions under different titles and printed in 1767. He wrote a picaresque novel, <span class="italic">The History of Tom Fool</span> (1760), and an even looser, baggier prose work, <span class="italic">The Dramatic History of Master Edward, Miss Ann, and Others</span> (1763), which satirized Shuter with whom he had quarrelled. (Ann is Shuter's mistress, the actress and dancer Nancy Dawson, who was already celebrated in a well-known ballad by Stevens). In 1762 Stevens was attacked in an anonymous prose satire, <span class="italic">The Battle of the Players</span> (pp. 31&#150;2), as the &#145;Author of a thousand bawdy Songs and obscene Treatises&#146;. Between 1762 and 1764 he edited and partly wrote a periodical, <span class="italic">The Beauties of All the Magazines Selected</span>. The afterpiece <span class="italic">Hearts of Oak</span> (1762), sometimes attributed to Stevens, is probably not by him: its title-song is certainly by Garrick.<br>
<br>As an actor Stevens &#145;was below mediocrity&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 54, 1784, 717) but his comic lecture as an entr'acte in Dublin in 1752 and his mock orations at the Haymarket Theatre in 1754&#150;5 were well received. Building on their success he devised his <span class="italic">Lecture upon Heads</span>, first delivered on 30 April 1764 at the Haymarket. Standing beside a table covered with dozens of papier-m&acirc;ch&eacute; busts and wig blocks, together with a few props, he gave a two-hour satirical monologue on such varied characters as a Cherokee chief, Alexander the Great, a London blood, a Billingsgate fishwife, a jockey, a conjuror, a Frenchman, a Spaniard, a Dutchman, and a Methodist parson. This one-man show was an immediate success. Stevens took it to Dublin, Manchester, Bath, and Bristol in 1764 and repeated it in several London theatres in 1765. In following years he performed many times in London and all over the provinces, making changes to keep the entertainment topical and in a vain attempt to outwit imitators. It is said that he crossed the Atlantic with the <span class="italic">Lecture</span>, but performances in America were almost certainly by an imitator, of which there were many throughout the English-speaking world. The <span class="italic">Lecture</span> was first published in 1765 and there were many more editions, authorized or not; so, to Stevens's vexation, other performers freely capitalized on his successful formula.<br>
<br>Stevens visited Stratford at the end of 1767; it was he, rather than, as is sometimes claimed, George Steevens (1736&#150;1800), who conducted negotiations which resulted in Garrick presenting a statue of Shakespeare to the town. Stevens toured with the <span class="italic">Lecture</span> in 1768&#150;9 and returned to the Haymarket on 28 March 1769 for a two-month run in which he presented the <span class="italic">Lecture</span> sixteen times. His comic opera <span class="italic">The Court of Alexander</span> was performed eight times at Covent Garden in January 1770 and published. He was perhaps the author of another comic opera, <span class="italic">The Fair Orphan</span>, acted and printed at [King's] Lynn, 1771. He made two appearances on the conventional London stage in benefits for actor friends: as Touchstone in <span class="italic">As You Like It</span> at Covent Garden on 5 April 1771, and as Stephano in <span class="italic">The Tempest</span> at Drury Lane on 12 May 1773. With Thomas Snagg the actor (stage name Wilks) he set up a burletta company which played for a few weeks in summer 1771 at Yarmouth and Harleston, but was disbanded on account of &#145;the improbability of profit or reputation ensuing&#146;  (Snagg, 80). Despite this experience Stevens was managing a small company which performed in a booth at the Cambridge cheese fair in September 1772.<br>
<br>At the beginning of 1773 Stevens was making life-sized puppets for Samuel Foote (<i>d</i>. 1777) and probably manipulating them and providing voice-overs at performances. His most successful comic opera, <span class="italic">The Trip to Portsmouth</span>, opened on 11 August 1773 at the Haymarket for twelve nights, was revived there for six performances in 1774&#150;5, and played in Belfast, Dublin, and Newcastle. His staples, though, remained his songs and the <span class="italic">Lecture upon Heads</span>. To counter pirates he published an authorized edition of <span class="italic">Songs, Comical and Satyrical</span> (1772), containing 134 songs. That year he gave the <span class="italic">Lecture</span> sixteen times between 26 March and 11 May at the Haymarket and added an <span class="italic">Essay on Satirical Entertainments</span> to a printed edition of the <span class="italic">Lecture</span>. Over the next seven years he took the <span class="italic">Lecture</span> on tour as far afield as Manchester, Dublin, and Belfast, as well as performing in London; his last recorded performance was on 10 December 1779 in the Town Hall, Wrexham. He sold his lecture to the actor Charles Lee Lewes, who delivered it from 1780 but never matched his success. Other prose sketches by Stevens were gathered posthumously in <span class="italic">The Adventures of a Speculist, or, A Journey through London</span> (2 vols., 1788).<br>
<br>The <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> claimed in 1784 that Stevens made &pound;10,000 from his <span class="italic">Lecture upon Heads</span>, adding inconsistently &#145;the greatest part of which melted from his hands before his death&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 54, 717) and &#145;he secured himself in affluence during the rest of his life&#146;  (ibid., 795). Stevens's intellect was decaying by 1780 and he had retired to Hampstead. He died on 6 September 1784 and was buried two days later at Biggleswade, Bedfordshire. His wife outlived him; she died on 2 September 1813.<br>
