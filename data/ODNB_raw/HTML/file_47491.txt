<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Foley family</span>  (<em>per. </em><em>c.</em>1620&#150;1716), <span class="occ">ironmasters and government contractors</span>, traces its origins to <a name="cosubject_37421"></a><span class="headword">Richard [ii] Foley</span>  (1579/80&#150;1657)<span class="occ"></span>, baptized on 28 March 1580 at Dudley, Worcestershire. His father, Richard [i] Foley, was a nailer, an occupation which at this date provided a decent living and in which Richard [ii] continued. The name of Richard's first wife is unknown but on 31 October 1621 he married as his second wife Alice Brindley (1587/8&#150;1663), of Hyde, near Kinver, Staffordshire. He had eleven children in all; six daughters and two sons from his first marriage and three sons from his second. He had land outside Dudley and a house in the town, where he was active in local government and was mayor in 1616. He was responsible for placing the town grammar school on a sound administrative and financial footing and he became by far the wealthiest property owner in Dudley.<h2>
<a name="Thecharcoalironindustry"></a>The charcoal iron industry</h2>By 1624 Richard [ii] was taking leases of local iron mills, including Hyde mill, Kinver, which in 1627 was converted to use waterpower for the slitting of iron rod, the basic raw material of the nailmakers. Richard [ii] was at one time credited with having introduced the slitting mill from Sweden, but the process was not new; his real achievement was the successful organization and exploitation of water-powered charcoal iron furnaces, forges, and slitting mills, leasing them from landowners who, having built or converted them, found them difficult to manage. He established a business structure which combined centralized control with dispersed plant, thus spreading his risk.<br>
<br>Between 1624 and 1633 Richard [ii] acquired leases of five furnaces, nine forges, and other ironworks, either on his own or in partnership with local ironmasters or gentlemen. His sons Richard [iii] (<i>d</i>. 1678), <a name="cosubject_9789"></a><span class="headword">Thomas [i] Foley</span>  (1617&#150;1677)<span class="occ"></span>, and Robert [i] (<i>bap</i>. 1626, <i>d</i>. 1676) took over parts of the business as they reached maturity. By 1638 they had a warehouse in London adjoining Leadenhall and were competing with the London ironmasters and ironmongers, addressing a national market.<br>
<br>Richard [ii] bought property in the neighbouring parish of Oldswinford and by 1631 had moved to a brick house in High Street, Stourbridge. Though of puritan sympathies he and his son Thomas [i] supplied iron ordnance, shot, pikeheads, and nails to the king's armies in 1642&#150;5. He was active in Stourbridge local government and a feoffee of Stourbridge grammar school. Richard Foley died in July 1657 at the age of seventy-seven and was buried in St Mary's Church, Stourbridge. Four of his five sons continued in the development of the iron business, and his daughters and sons-in-law were also actively involved. Capital was raised by a series of interlocking partnerships between family members and close associates. Iron mills were added or disposed of according to their profitability and value as contributors to the whole enterprise.<h2>
<a name="Expandingenterprise"></a>Expanding enterprise</h2>Richard [iii], the eldest son of Richard [ii] and his first wife, extended Foley interests to north Staffordshire. In 1651 he bought the manor of Longton, north Staffordshire, where there were coal and ironstone mines, and in 1661 he leased Meir Heath furnace in that manor. By 1666 there was an associated warehouse for slit rod at Normacote Grange. With Consall and Oakamore forges these formed a group known as the Moorland works, supplying rod and bar to north Staffordshire ironmongers. These were operated by Richard [iii] in partnership with his younger stepbrother Philip [i] (<i>d</i>. 1670). He also brought together Lawton furnace and the forges of Cranage and Warmingham in Cheshire. Both the Moorland and the Cheshire works supplied rod and bar to north Staffordshire ironmongers. Henry Glover of Stourbridge was brother-in-law to the Foley sons and was their agent. From 2 June 1675 to 15 July 1676 more than 1000 tons of iron were cast at Meir Heath. Richard [iii] died in 1678, and the north Staffordshire works passed to his son Richard [iv] (<i>d</i>. 1684).<h2>
<a name="Civilwaropportunities"></a>Civil war opportunities</h2>Meanwhile, Thomas [i] Foley, born on 3 December 1617 at Witley Court, Worcestershire, the second son of Richard [ii], worked with his father from an early age and married (before 1641) Anne Browne (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1619) of Spelmonden, Kent, whose father, John, was a gun-founder with iron furnaces in the Weald at Hawkhurst and Bedgebury. Of their four sons, Thomas [ii] (<i>c</i>.1641&#150;1701), <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9787/', "Paul Foley (1644/5&#150;1699)")</script>, Nathaniel (1647&#150;1663), and <a name="cosubject_48972"></a><span class="headword">Philip [ii] Foley</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1648, <em>d.</em> 1716)<span class="occ"></span>, three took part in the iron business, and all but Philip [ii] had a university education. In 1651 Thomas [i] bought the manor of Compton Hollows in Kinver, and in 1661 the manor of Harborne. He was managing the Stour works from about 1640 and in 1665 his house at Compton Hollows was assessed at 15 hearths. The civil war brought problems in the transport of iron, but it also provided opportunities for sale. Although the partnership supplied the king's armies it was able to remain neutral and after the war secured valuable naval ordnance contracts for Cromwell's government.<br>
<br>In the aftermath of the war, between 1648 and 1675, Thomas [i] acquired ninety-seven leases and partnerships, expanding in particular into the Forest of Dean where the furnaces produced exceptionally high grade iron from local ores. In the 1650s and 1660s Thomas and his Browne brother-in-law had a gunfounding furnace in Kent. By 1670 the Foley family had under its control mines, woodlands, furnaces, forges, slitting mills, a wire works, and warehouses, located in Worcestershire, south and north Staffordshire, Shropshire, and the Forest of Dean. Furnaces, chafery and finery forges, and slitting mills were grouped to form production units of furnaces and forges, but some work was put out to other ironmasters. The Foley mills produced bar iron, rod iron, wire, cast pots, and anvils. The River Severn was an important line of communication and transport connecting the Stour valley, Shropshire, and Forest of Dean mills with each other as well as with the seaport of Bristol and the river port of Bewdley. Thomas [i] was also a governor of the Society of Mines Royal and of the Society of Mineral and Battery Works.<br>
<br>Thomas's house in Austin Friars, London, was an important assertion of his role on the national market, but Worcestershire remained his main centre. In 1667 he founded Oldswinford Hospital, which provided food, clothes, education, and apprenticeships for sixty poor boys. His contracts with Cromwell's government led to his being drawn into public affairs and in 1656 he was high sheriff for Worcestershire. In the previous year he had bought the manors of Great and Little Witley in Worcestershire and other properties for &pound;2600. In 1669 Thomas [i] reorganized control of the ironworks, grouping the mills on a broadly geographical basis. He handed them over to be managed by his sons, though he continued to supervise and arbitrate between them: Paul became responsible for the Forest works and Philip [ii] for the Stour works. His half-brother Richard [iii] and his nephew Richard [iv] meanwhile ran their north Staffordshire works. Thomas [i] Foley died on 1 October 1677 and was buried at Witley.<h2>
<a name="Managingtheenterprises"></a>Managing the enterprises</h2>The ironworks partnerships were becoming even more widely dispersed as more ironworks were leased, and new partners were brought in. Raw materials, pig iron, and wrought iron were moved greater distances in the course of production, and the numerous customers expected extended credit and paid mainly by means of bills of exchange. This presented problems of management, logistics, and accounting, which required sophisticated solutions.<br>
<br>Richard [iv] was trained by his father and inherited the north Staffordshire works on his father's death in 1678. Philip [ii] and other interested parties made an agreement to resolve the outstanding debts and enabled Richard [iv] to establish his ownership. However Richard died in 1684 and his heir was his uncle, John Foley (1631&#150;1684), the youngest son of Richard [ii] Foley. When John Foley died in November of the same year the ironworks were inherited by Henry Glover senior, his brother-in-law, who had long been manager of the Stour works. For a short period the Cheshire works were transferred to the Yorkshire ironmasters, but they had returned to Foley hands by 1696. John Wheeler of Wollaston, Stourbridge, took over the Moorland works, with Obadiah Lane as manager, the partners being Wheeler, Lane, and Philip [ii] Foley. These works were in a favourable location between the expanding industrial areas of north and south Staffordshire where most of the bar and rod iron was sold.<h2>
<a name="Presenceinparliament"></a>Presence in parliament</h2>Thomas [ii] (<i>c</i>.1641&#150;1701), the eldest son of Thomas [i], was educated at Pembroke College, Cambridge, where he was admitted in 1657 aged sixteen; he entered the Inner Temple, London, in the same year. He married Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1686), daughter of Edward Ashe, a draper of Heytesbury, Wiltshire, and London. Thomas [ii] held the Longhope and Tintern furnaces and Whitbrook and Wilden forge mills in the Forest of Dean. He too was a governor of the Society of Mines Royal and of the Society of Mineral and Battery Works. As eldest son, Thomas [ii] was increasingly preoccupied with building up a landed estate and a political career in the House of Commons. In 1683 he bought the Jacobean manor house of Great Witley from the Russell family, and added long wings to it. He was very active in the House of Commons, a member of all three Exclusion parliaments, supported the revolution, and sat in all the parliaments of William III. He was appointed to 177 committees of the house. In 1685 Thomas's daughter, Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1691), married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/12344/', "Robert Harley, first earl of Oxford and Mortimer")</script>. His eldest son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9790/', "Thomas Foley, first Baron Foley (1673&#150;1733)")</script>, was one of the twelve new peers created by Robert Harley in January 1712.<br>
<br>Meanwhile the younger sons of Thomas [i], <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9787/', "Paul Foley")</script> and Philip [ii], had become the principal managers of the family works, bringing the partnerships to their widest extension in 1692. Paul was educated at Magdalen Hall, Oxford, from 1662, and possibly at the Inner Temple in London from September of that year. Between 1668 and 1670 he married Mary, daughter of John Lane, a clothworker, of St Lawrence, Poultney Lane, London, and bought the estate of Stoke Edith in Herefordshire. Not long before his death he completely rebuilt the house. He was a dissenter, and employed an ejected minister as tutor for his children. Like his elder brother Thomas [ii] he was a governor of the Society of Mines Royal from 1666 to 1678 and the Society of Mineral and Battery Works from 1666 to 1687.<h2>
<a name="Riftsandrecombinations"></a>Rifts and recombinations</h2>In 1669 the numerous but interlocking partnerships and semi-dependent enterprises of the ironworks had been divided into three segments. Paul purchased the king's works in the Forest of Dean in 1674 and probably demolished them; but the Forest of Dean remained the main base of his power and responsibilities within the ironworks partnership. The Forest of Dean works were mainly furnaces producing high-quality iron from local ores. Eventually Paul held seven blast furnaces including Redbrook furnace and two forges at Lydbrook, Gloucestershire. He also had a half-interest in St Weonard's furnace, and the Pontrilas, Peterchurch, and Llansillo forges in Herefordshire.<br>
<br>The Stour works were controlled by the youngest of the brothers, Philip [ii] Foley, baptized on 12 May 1648 in the parish of St Peter le Poer in London. He married Penelope, daughter of William Paget, in 1670, bringing the Cannock group of forges into the family, and his father settled Prestwood estate in Kingswinford parish on them. They had two sons and five daughters. At the age of nineteen Philip took over the Stour valley and south Staffordshire works, then comprising four furnaces, thirteen forges, and the Bewdley warehouse, the stock and debts of which were estimated as &pound;68,830. Philip entered into a bond to pay &pound;60,000 to his father. There was a thorough assessment in 1667&#150;8 of each and every mill in respect of its productivity and profitability, and the workmen were appraised in detail in respect of their skills, diligence, and reliability.<br>
<br>In 1674 there was a rift between Paul and Philip [ii]. Philip was both Paul's chief customer and his main competitor. Paul had expanded his output of pig iron in the Forest works and needed to expand his market in the midlands, but he also raised the price of the best quality Forest iron. Their father, Thomas [i], had to intervene in what threatened to become a bitter quarrel between the brothers. An agreement was drawn up which gave Philip one third of the Forest works but ensured Paul access to the midland market for iron. The partnership was, however, always strained and Paul was never satisfied that he was receiving support from his brother nor a full return from his mills. There were constant shifts and changes in the arrangements and although Paul received a steady profit from the Forest works he was by 1685 anxious to persuade Philip and other ironmasters to buy him out. This may have been a negotiating ploy, for Paul continued to operate the Forest works in close association with Philip.<br>
<br>At the same time Philip [ii] was establishing links with other partners in the Stour valley and in Shropshire, strengthening his own position and making himself less dependent upon Paul for pig iron. His agent and partner John Wheeler of Wollaston became important both in the practical management of the Stour valley and of the north Staffordshire works, and in his personal support for Philip. By 1691 Wheeler was also active in the Forest works. The partnerships included other ironmasters who held shares of one-sixth, or one-quarter, contributing to the large capital required, and they also created an active link with partnerships in other parts of the country.<br>
<br>As the leases of the ironworks were usually for short periods, and without right of survivorship, there was a continual need for adjustment and change of personnel. In 1692 Paul and Philip [ii] Foley together with John and Richard Wheeler and Richard Avenant drew up a new agreement for seven years which created a supervisory group of six partners. This brought together once more the Forest, Stour, and Staffordshire works. Paul and Philip paid in cash; the others were deemed to have put in the stock and debts from the mills which they had been operating for some years. The Stour ironworks were similarly reorganized with five partners. John Wheeler was the chief agent and salaried cash-holder for both partnerships.<h2>
<a name="Closingyears"></a>Closing years</h2>Although this episode marked the climax of the process of expansion it did not halt the process of continuous renewal and reorganization of capital. It was a flexible arrangement and new mills continued to be brought within the network while others passed into other hands. Philip [ii] briefly made agreements which brought mills in Derbyshire (only between 1695 and 1698) and Nottinghamshire (from 1696) into the partnership. The organization was called in the accounts &#145;The Ironworks in Partnership&#146;. Although other ironmasters held shares in the partnerships, Paul and Philip retained control of capital and the leadership in decision making. The day-to-day running of the units of production was in the hands of salaried clerks. These were educated men of modest background, who organized the sales and purchases along with the movement of raw materials and iron, and who hired and fired the workmen. The highly skilled men commanded high wages; their competence was monitored by the management, and they moved from mill to mill. In addition the ironworks required local unskilled labourers and large numbers of carriers by land and water. The enterprise was documented and controlled by a single set of annual accounts which were derived from detailed and regular records of daily transactions, wages, stock, debts, buildings repairs, and customers.<br>
<br>Such attention to financial detail was remarkable for the period, but the Foleys had long been concerned with county and national finance as well as business accounting; in the House of Commons Paul was respected as a good financier and lawyer, and he was one of the main organizers of the Land Bank proposed by Robert Harley. Philip [ii] was less involved in politics than his brother but was elected MP for Bewdley in 1679, for Stafford in 1689, 1695, and 1698, and for Droitwich in 1690 and 1701. There were five Foley cousins in the House of Commons, including the speaker in 1698, and all of them were notable members. In politics as in business the Foley brothers both supported and competed with each other.<br>
<br>The skills of public administration and private business in the Foley concern combined to make possible the effective co-ordination of more than fifty mills located in England and Wales. The enterprise was a landmark in the development of management techniques, but, perhaps as important, it also developed the selection, training, and control of local agents and managers at the sites. Many of the family members who had built up the business to its greatest extent died between 1699 and 1716. Paul Foley died of gangrene on 13 November 1699, and was buried at Stoke Edith, leaving an estate reputed to be worth &pound;4000 a year. Thomas Foley [ii] died in 1701 and Philip [ii] in 1716. Their sons made aristocratic marriages and entered the peerage. From 1710 the Foleys gradually disposed of many of the works, retaining mainly those at the Forest of Dean and the Bewdley warehouse, and domination of the industry thus passed to other families.<br>
<br>Throughout the seventeenth century the Foley family were outstanding in the business of the production and sale of cast and wrought iron. They developed systems of management which enabled them to co-ordinate a multiplicity of units of production spread over a wide geographical area. Their achievement lay in the development of a business which was at once based on a multiplicity of units of production and local salaried management, a sophisticated system of central controls, and an elaborate unified accounting system. At the level of middle management the clerks of two or three related units worked to a uniform pattern throughout the enterprise. At the centre Henry Glover of Stourbridge and John Wheeler were of great importance both as managers and partners, but the Foleys were directly and personally creating policies and enforcing the routines which held together the whole enterprise, and demanding accountability from all those involved. They were also active in local and county government and in the second half of the century in the House of Commons. The two spheres of action were closely linked, not least in providing access to large government contracts and the experience of the management of money. There were other partnerships of ironmasters with whom they both competed and associated, but for six generations they were the leaders of a dynamic sector of industrialization. With the profits they founded three landed estates, namely Great Witley in Worcestershire, Stoke Edith in Herefordshire, and Prestwood in Staffordshire.<br>
