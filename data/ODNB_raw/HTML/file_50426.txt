<span class="headword">Callan,  Nicholas Joseph</span>  (1799&#150;1864), <span class="occ">Roman Catholic priest and physicist</span>, was born on 20 December 1799 at Darver in the parish of Dromiskin, co. Louth, Ireland, into a well-to-do Roman Catholic family, the fifth child and third son of Donnchadh Beag or Wee Denis Callan (<i>c</i>.1745&#150;1813), possibly a farmer, and his wife, Margaret Smith. Little is known about Callan's preparatory schooling but he later attended the academy at Dundalk run by the Presbyterian minister William Neilson. He took the name Joseph on confirmation. Callan prepared for the priesthood at Navan Seminary before entering St Patrick's College, Maynooth, on 26 August 1816. There the first three years were devoted to literature and science&#151;in his third year he excelled in experimental philosophy or physics; the latter three years formed his theological studies. These concluded with his election to the Dunboyne Establishment&#151;the postgraduate institution of the college. In theological studies he was exposed to influences of Gallicanism. At the end of the academic year 1823&#150;4 he headed the premium list and was first in theology, canon law, and ecclesiastical history. He was ordained subdeacon in 1822, deacon on 23 May 1823, and priest, one day later. On completion of his postgraduate studies in 1824 Callan was chosen to assist the Revd Michael Blake in re-establishing the Collegio Irlandese in Rome; there he attended lectures at the Sapienza University and prepared for a doctorate in divinity, conferred on 13 April 1826. On 15 September 1826 he succeeded to the chair of natural philosophy at Maynooth which he occupied until his death. He paid little further attention to theological scholarship.<br>
<br>As professor Callan strove to raise standards in physics; he wrote an introductory textbook <span class="italic">Electricity and Galvanism</span> (1832) and brought out a new and enlarged edition of a textbook on geometry. In his life as a scientist two periods can be identified, one of outstanding activity and achievement as a young professor, and another of consolidation and development in his later years. Perhaps inspired by the knowledge of the work of Galvani and Volta gained during his stay in Rome, Callan became a pioneer in the investigation of electricity and electromagnetism; he made important contributions in developing and improving electromagnets and coils, electric motors for traction, batteries, and electric lighting. In developing electromagnets (1836&#150;8) Callan followed up the work of Sturgeon in England and of Joseph Henry in America. With coils joined in series he recognized that the intensity of the shocks experienced depended on the rapidity of the break in the primary and he developed a device called a repeater, for rapid interruption using the escapement mechanism of a clock. He found that shocks were augmented when the circuits were separated. He discovered the principle of the step-up transformer and the induction coil, a replica of which he sent to Sturgeon, who demonstrated it in August 1837 to the Electrical Society. Employing primary coils of thick copper wire insulated with tape and secondary coils of very great lengths of fine iron wire coated with a mixture of beeswax and guttapercha, he obtained powerful spark discharges. Callan devised a motor using electromagnets for excitation and powered by batteries and he conducted experiments with a view to producing electric railway locomotion. He envisaged an electric railway from Dublin to Kingstown (later Dunlaoghaire) and designed an engine to propel a carriage and load, but practical difficulties led to the demise of the project.<br>
<br>Callan modified the Wollaston cell by placing the zinc plates in copper containers without glass or porcelain vessels. In 1836 he described a very large battery containing 20 square zinc plates with about 140 litres of acid. He proceeded to improve two-fluid cells working in succession with the Poggendorff, Daniel, Grove, and Bunsen cells. He developed a new two liquid cast-iron voltaic battery, and converted his original Wollaston battery into a cast-iron one; using the zinc plates of the former he constructed 577 cells, obtaining what was probably the world's largest battery. Subsequently these cells were manufactured commercially at the Adelaide Gallery in London. His work on the cast-iron battery also led to the discovery that cast iron treated with nitric acid became resistant to weathering and he was granted a patent (2340 of 1853) for this process. He experimented with limelighting and electric arc lighting for application in lighthouses, for which he also devised a special single-fluid battery. He developed a type of tangent galvanometer which later found commercial application as did some other findings, for example in the design of lightning conductors. Of particular significance was his discovery (published in 1863) of the point plate valve or rectifier.<br>
<br>Callan was active in the Roman Catholic publication movement that opposed the activities of evangelical proselytizing societies in Ireland, especially in the 1840s, the decade of the great famine. Over several years he devoted nearly all his leisure time to producing English versions of the popular devotional works of St Alphonsus Liguori, at least sixteen of which were published between 1842 and 1850; a book of meditations by Callan chiefly for ecclesiastics, entitled <span class="italic">Selva</span> (1844), also enjoyed popularity. At the time of the famine Callan donated all of his professorial salary for relief. Whereas a considerable number of his instruments have been preserved, the corpus of his published research papers is small, consisting of nineteen mostly short papers in William Sturgeon's <span class="italic">Annals of Electricity</span>, the <span class="italic">Philosophical Magazine</span>, the <span class="italic">Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy</span>, and the <span class="italic">British Association Report</span> for 1857.<br>
<br>Callan's researches were financed largely from private or family means. Most of his apparatus was made by himself with the help of local tradesmen or blacksmiths. He was seen by many as an eccentric and was the subject of anecdote. In his later years he sought recognition for his earlier discoveries: at the Dublin meeting of the British Association in 1857, where his work was honoured, he upheld his priority claim as inventor of the induction coil.<br>
<br>Callan, who was small in stature, suffered from high blood pressure and he was twice relieved of his duties and sent to convalesce on the continent, in 1849 and in 1850&#150;51. On 2 January 1864 he suffered a stroke in the college chapel and died at Maynooth on 14 January at 8 p.m. His possessions, consisting of books, furniture, prints, and wine, and a share in property inherited from his late sister Catherine, were willed to the college library, to charity, or to his superiors and professors of the college. A Celtic cross and headstone were erected about forty years after his death on his grave in the college cemetery.<br>
