<span class="headword">Whitehorne <span class="st"> [Whithorne]</span>,  Peter</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1549&#150;1563), <span class="occ">soldier and translator</span>, described himself on the title-pages of his books as both a student and &#145;fellow&#146; of Gray's Inn, and was probably the P. Whytame who was admitted to that institution in 1543. Like many men of his generation he was drawn to Italy. In 1549 he travelled to Siena where he met the English diplomat Sir Thomas Hoby. The two men shared an interest in the achievements of the Roman empire, and when they visited that ancient city together they &#145;searched out such antiquities as was here to bee seene&#146;  (Hoby, 25). In 1550 they went on to explore Naples and Florence. Whitehorne then commenced his military career and for the next ten years campaigned with imperial forces in north Africa. He also spent a brief period in Constantinople, where he studied the military organization of the Ottoman empire. However, he continued to be influenced primarily by both contemporary Italian thought and classical authorities.<br>
<br>During his years as a soldier Whitehorne made the first translation into English of Machiavelli's <span class="italic">Arte della guerra</span>, which was published in London in 1560 as <span class="italic">The Arte of Warre</span>. He also published in the same year his own treatise, <span class="italic">Certain Waies for the Orderyng of Souldiers in Battelray</span>, as a supplement to this translation. In this well-regarded study he covered themes not dealt with by Machiavelli, such as fortification, the manufacture of gunpowder, the use of incendiary devices, and signalling. Furthermore, where Machiavelli had been dismissive of artillery, Whitehorne offered a more measured assessment of the utility of cannon. Thus, although a debt to classical authors such as Polybius is evident in the section on signalling, the treatise was an original work of military theory. Its main shortcoming was its brevity; it lacked the detail and copious illustrations that were characteristic of many contemporary continental books. Nevertheless, at the time of its publication, there was no other work in English that offered such insights into the latest developments in siege-craft and military architecture. For this reason Whitehorne can be justly regarded as a pioneer in his field.<br>
<br>Two further editions of these works were published in 1573 and 1588, an indicator of their popularity and influence. Fabio Cotta's Italian translation of the Greek Onosander's <span class="italic">Strategicus</span> had also attracted Whitehorne's attention, and he published an English version, <span class="italic">Of the Generall Captaine and of his Office</span>, in 1563. Considering the martial education of his countrymen a patriotic duty, so that England should be &#145;kept from outrageous cruelty, and ravenous spoil of the enemies&#146;  (Webb, 7), Whitehorne was a significant figure in the development of Elizabethan military theory; he helped establish the agenda for the protracted debates on the nation's defence that dominated the last two decades of the sixteenth century.<br>
