</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Coster,  Howard Sydney Musgrave</span>  (1885&#150;1959), <span class="occ">photographer</span>, was born on 27 April 1885 at his family home, 29 Lavers Road, Stoke Newington, London. He was the third of five sons of William Isaiah Coster, commercial clerk (listed in Howard Coster's <span class="italic">Times</span> obituary and <span class="italic">Who's Who</span> as John William Coster), and his wife, Mary Ann, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Porter. William Coster died when his sons were still boys, and the family subsequently moved to Ventnor on the Isle of Wight. There Mary's sister Annie helped to bring up the five boys, and her brother Samuel ran a photographic business at 31 High Street, Ventnor&#151;a traditional Victorian portrait studio, with glass walls and a glass ceiling. After attending the local school in Ventnor, Howard Coster began a five-year apprenticeship as a general assistant at his uncle's studio, where he earned 2<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>. a week. His duties included the laborious task of preparing wet collodion negatives and supervising 200 daylight-printing frames.<br>
<br>In 1906 Samuel's business was taken over by James Allen, and Coster, now aged twenty-one, abandoned photography in favour of farming in South Africa. His brother Percy had emigrated to the Orange Free State four years earlier. However, after two years of farming, Howard Coster returned to Britain, taking up a position at a portrait studio in Coventry, where he remained for three years, before travelling to South Africa again.<br>
<br>During this second period abroad Coster worked as a travelling photographer. Cycling through the small towns with a tent as a darkroom, he made portraits of cattlemen, and gained free accommodation at hotels in exchange for portrait sittings. Shortly before the outbreak of the First World War he opened a studio with Mr Somerville in Maitland Street, in the centre of Bloemfontein, but in 1918 he returned to England, to enrol in the Royal Flying Corps. He became attached to the aerial photography section, and reached the rank of lieutenant. A small album from this year survives, containing fascinating aerial photographs and images of wrecked planes, juxtaposed with personal snapshots of Coster's comrades and idyllic English rural scenes.<br>
<br>After the war Coster returned to South Africa. This time settling there for seven years, working initially in a studio in Bloemfontein and subsequently with Lionel Levson in Johannesburg. In 1925 he married Joan Burr (1903&#150;1974), and the couple returned to London to open their own studio at 8 and 9 Essex Street, off the Strand. Unusually, the Coster studio was dedicated solely to the photography of men, and just a few months after opening, in May 1926, the credit line &#145;Coster&#151;photographer of men&#146; began appearing in the press. In this he followed the example of the American photographer Pirie McDonald, who worked as a &#145;photographer of men&#146; in New York from the 1900s. Moreover, Coster was anxious to distance himself from the many society photographers in London, who specialized in beautifying their female clientele.<br>
<br>The business was a success from the outset and by the end of the year Coster had undertaken several commissions for portraits of successful writers, including John Galsworthy, J. B. Priestley, and one of his most iconic images, A. A. Milne with his son Christopher Robin Milne and Pooh Bear, at Cotchford Farm, their home in Sussex. In 1926 Coster superseded E. O. Hoppe as portrait photographer for <span class="italic">The Bookman</span>, a literary magazine, producing small half-tones of contemporary writers. In the Christmas issues of 1929 and 1930 several pages were devoted to large sepia photogravure reproductions of Coster's portraits of Siegfried Sassoon, Algernon Blackwood, R. H. Mottram, M. R. James, Alfred Noyes, E. Phillips Oppenheim, and Philip Guedalla. Despite the closure of <span class="italic">The Bookman</span> at the end of 1934, Coster remained the pre-eminent photographer of British literary figures, and his portraits of authors frequently appeared on the inside covers of the sixpenny paperback books first printed by Penguin in 1935.<br>
<br>However, Coster's output was not limited to literary portraits. From 1928 to 1931 the self-styled &#145;photographer of men&#146; produced portraits of eminent women and fashion photographs for British <span class="italic">Vogue</span>, under the by-line &#145;Howard and Joan Coster&#146;. Through <span class="italic">Vogue</span> he met his fellow contributor Baron George Hoyningen-Huene who often made use of Coster's well-equipped London studio. Coster also created advertising images for, among others, Brylcreem, Manikin Cigars, and Slumberland Beds.<br>
<br>At this time Coster also worked regularly for <span class="italic">The Bystander</span> magazine, and from 1929 until 1940 (when the magazine merged with <span class="italic">The Tatler</span>) he produced various weekly series, such as &#145;Prominent men of the day photographed at home&#146;, &#145;Our public men&#146;, &#145;Powers of the pulpit&#146;, and a series of museum directors entitled &#145;National custodians&#146;. After 1935 he produced his most important work for <span class="italic">The Bystander</span>, which included film and theatre stars, directors and producers, theatre designers and composers.<br>
<br>By 1930 Howard and Joan Coster were living in St John's Wood, London, and they employed several staff in the Essex Street studio. Joan supervised the printing, but rarely operated the camera. A secretary, two printers, an apprentice named Arthur Strong, and a former boxer, Joe, responsible for moving lights and heavy equipment, made up the team. Between 12 and 3 o'clock there was no sitting in the studio, and Coster held an open house, generously providing lunch for the staff and visitors. The portraits from this period were made on three different sizes of film negative: 10 inches by 8 inches, whole plate (8&frac12; in. &times; 6&frac12; in.) or half-plate (6&frac12; in. &times; 4&frac12; in.). They were printed on matt or textured paper and often sepia- or cream-toned. The lighting techniques were simple yet striking, frequently relying on just one blue floodlight and a reflector.<br>
<br>The soldier and writer T. E. Lawrence recalled the experience of being photographed in Coster's studio, on 31 October 1931, in a letter to Charlotte Shaw:<blockquote>On Friday I was on the embankment by the Temple &hellip; a little bare-headed man rushed up and said, &#145;Colonel Lawrence?&#146; Used to be, I replied. &#145;I want to photograph you.&#146; But who are you, I asked. &#145;My name is Howard Coster.&#146; A professional, I asked. &#145;Yes, but this is for myself. I don't want to sell it or show it. You and Gandhi are the two people I want to take.&#146; So I went along, for the joke of it, and he put me on a little chair, made me take my tunic off, and photographed me about a dozen times. A little shop in Essex Street. Rather a nice little stammering man, I thought. Works for <span class="italic">Vogue</span>! Had chased me for 5 minutes, afraid to speak.</blockquote>Howard Coster's portrait of Lawrence of Arabia became an iconic image, appearing in the <span class="italic">Photography Year Book, 1936&#150;1937</span> and the <span class="italic">Illustrated London News</span>, after Lawrence's death. It was also exhibited in Photography of 100 Years at the Science Museum in 1939, and in the premises of Kodak Ltd, West Street, Durban, South Africa, alongside Coster's portraits of Aldous Huxley, John Gielgud, Laurence Olivier, and Eric Gill. Coster's friendship with the sculptor and typographer Gill produced the largest collection of negatives of a single subject by Coster, and included many studies of him at work. In return Gill produced a delineative portrait of Coster (1931, NPG).<br>
<br>Coster's reputation as a leading portrait photographer was reinforced when in 1932 he was selected as one of the British representatives at the prestigious Wertheim Gallery exhibition in London. Other exhibitors included John Havinden (1908&#150;1987) and Barbara Ker-Seymer (1905&#150;1993) from Britain, the Hungarian-born Laszlo Moholy-Nagy (1895&#150;1946), and Edward Steichen (1879&#150;1973) from America. Although both were original in their approaches to portraiture, parallels may be drawn between Coster and Steichen, who were similarly inspired by the lighting effects of the expressionist German films of the 1920s.<br>
<br>Other influences from Europe included the work of Man Ray, in particular his use of solarization and under-exposure. One example of Coster's own experimentation with these new techniques is his solarized portrait of Frank Buchman (1878&#150;1961), which appeared in <span class="italic">The Bystander</span> on 15 June 1938. As a prominent member of the Professional Photographers' Association, Coster frequently gave public lectures, championing innovative non-British photography and encouraging experimental approaches to advertising and commercial photography, including the use of X-ray photographs.<br>
<br>In 1937 Coster was elected a fellow of the Royal Society of Arts, and from then on the letters FRSA followed his credit line. In the same year an exhibition of 249 of his portrait photographs was held at the department store Selfridges, entitled &#145;Camera portraits by Howard Coster&#146;.<br>
<br>As the Second World War loomed, Coster continued to work for <span class="italic">The Bystander</span>, but turned his camera away from the arts, towards political figures and foreign ambassadors in London. This period witnessed a change in style too; from 1938 onwards he used the smaller 35 mm Contax camera for location work, and his name appears in the 1940 Contax advertising campaign. It has been commented that these portraits lack the clarity and technical skill of his earlier full- and half-plate images.<br>
<br>After the outbreak of war Coster was commissioned to take a large number of official portraits of army, air force, and political leaders, many of which appeared in the <span class="italic">Illustrated London News</span>, <span class="italic">The Tatler</span>, and <span class="italic">The Sketch</span>. His photograph of Air Vice-Marshal Owen Tudor Boyd (<span class="italic">The Sketch</span>, 18 September 1940) was exhibited at the RAF War Photographs Exhibition at the Building Centre. In November of the same year Coster's portraits of Augustus John and Jacob Epstein featured in the exhibition of the Institute of British Photographers, at 49 Gordon Square, London.<br>
<br>In 1943, as his success endured, Coster moved to a new studio at 3 Victoria Street, Westminster. His work continued to appear in many publications, including <span class="italic">Homes and Gardens</span>, <span class="italic">Good Housekeeping</span>, <span class="italic">The Countryman</span>, and <span class="italic">African World</span>. A year later he was awarded the freedom of the City of London, in acknowledgement of his lifelong commitment to his art and his important contribution to British photography. In 1946 Coster closed the studio and retired with his wife to the country. His collection of 8000 negatives was acquired for the nation by the British Council photographic library, and it subsequently passed to the Central Office of Information, which gave it to National Portrait Gallery in 1974.<br>
<br>In 1953 Howard Coster returned to business in the West End and to a new studio at 9 Sackville Street, London W1. Portraits from this later period include John Betjeman, Cecil Day-Lewis, Compton MacKenzie, and John Gielgud, many of which were published in the <span class="italic">Tatler and Bystander</span> and <span class="italic">The Recorder</span>. He enjoyed his later years with Joan in their terraced house at 32 Friars Street, Sudbury, Suffolk, and continued to work almost until his death on 17 November 1959 at St Audry's Hospital, Melton, Suffolk.<br>
<br>Talkative, with a slight stutter, Coster's lifelong success was a result not only of his technical skill but also of his interest in human nature, and his careful study of the character of every sitter. His apprentice in the early 1930s, Arthur Strong (1908&#150;2004), who also has work in the National Portrait Gallery collection, described Coster as &#145;a patriot; he also believed in God, though he held to no orthodox religion&#146;  (Pepper, xiii). In appearance Coster was of medium build with bright blue eyes and a prominent nose.<br>
<br>The significant contribution Coster made to British photography was appraised in the 1985 exhibition &#145;Howard Coster: camera portraits of the twenties and thirties&#146; at the National Portrait Gallery, London, curated by Terence Pepper. In addition to Coster's collection of 8000 negatives the National Portrait Gallery houses six personal photograph albums and twelve portrait albums from the 1920s and 1930s, which can be glimpsed in the background of his celebrated portrait of W. H. Auden, Christopher Isherwood, and Stephen Spender (1938). Contained in the personal albums are many contact prints and experimental shots, including solarized images of flowers and objects. The diverse range of subjects, such as an East End children's hospital, the Isle of Wight's beaches, and penguins at London Zoo, reveal that Coster's interests and skills extended far beyond portraiture.<br>
