<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Maule,  James</span>, fourth earl of Panmure  (1658/9&#150;1723), <span class="occ">Jacobite sympathizer</span>, was the fifth son of George Maule, second earl of Panmure (1619&#150;1671), and his wife, Lady Jean Campbell (1624/5&#150;1703), eldest daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4511/', "John Campbell, first earl of Loudoun")</script>; <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18368/', "Patrick Maule, first earl of Panmure")</script>, was his other grandfather. His first significant public appointment was as an excise commissioner in Forfarshire in October 1680. On 27 July 1681 he had a charter of the lands and mains of Ballumbie, Forfarshire. Maule of Ballumbie, as he was known, travelled abroad and in 1684 served as a volunteer at the siege of Luxembourg. On 1 February 1686 he succeeded the third earl, his brother George (<i>c</i>.1650&#150;1686), as fourth earl of Panmure (the third earl's only son having died before May 1685). He took the oaths in the Scottish parliament on 29 April 1686 and on 13 May he was sworn a member of the Scottish privy council. On 5 February 1687 Panmure was contracted to marry Lady Margaret Hamilton (<i>d</i>. 1731), youngest daughter of William Douglas, third duke of Hamilton [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7935/', "Hamilton, William")</script>] (all the children of this marriage took their mother's name). They had no children. In March 1687 he was &#145;laid aside&#146;  (Maule, 2.344) from the privy council for refusing to support James II's declaration of indulgence.<br>
<br>In January 1689 Panmure left Scotland to travel to London, presumably in an attempt to influence the revolutionary settlement in Scotland, in which his father-in-law played a crucial role. On 1 March he was given a pass to return to Edinburgh. By 14 March he was attending the Scottish convention, and on 16 March he signed the declaration that it was a free and lawful meeting. However, he opposed the recognition of William and Mary and retired to his estates. He refused the oaths to the new king and never sat in parliament again, although he held local office as a commissioner of supply in Forfarshire and Aberdeenshire in 1689&#150;94 and again in 1704. During Queen Anne's reign Panmure crops up in Jacobite correspondence as a man to be relied upon: in 1705 his name appeared on a list of those &#145;who have distinguished themselves for their loyalty since the Revolution&#146;  (Hooke, 1.229). He opposed the union with England in 1707, and it was probably his nephew John Erskine, earl of Mar, who protected him from arrest in 1708. In 1709 Panmure's extensive reconstruction of Brechin Castle was completed, a project begun in the 1690s. His name was included on a list of non-juring Scottish peers in July 1713.<br>
<br>In August 1715 Panmure was still adding to his extensive estates, purchasing property from the Lindsays of Edzell for over &pound;16,000. After some initial hesitation, and much to the surprise of those such as the lord justice clerk, he left Edinburgh in 1715 and sailed to his northern estates. He proclaimed the Pretender (James Stuart) as James VIII and III at Brechin and raised a regiment of foot which numbered 415 men and fought at the battle of Sheriffmuir on 13 November. Panmure was wounded in the battle, captured &#145;so very ill cut in the head that he was left for dead in a house by the enemy&#146;  (Sinclair, 227), and then rescued by his brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18366/', "Harry Maule (1659&#150;1734)")</script>. In January 1716 he entertained James at Brechin Castle, and following the collapse of the rebellion in February he escaped to France. In consideration of his services James made him a knight of the Thistle on 8 April 1716 (the same day as the duke of Ormond). He was duly attainted by act of parliament for not surrendering himself to justice by 30 June 1716. Panmure joined the Jacobite court at Avignon and travelled with it into Italy. By May 1717 he was &#145;in a dismal way, and full of his old splenetic notions&#146;  (<span class="italic">Stuart Papers</span>, 4.253), feeling neglected and kept out of secrets. By February 1718 he was <i>en route</i> for France via Venice, in the hope that judicious bribery would enable him to return to Britain. The earl of Mar put his disillusionment down to his doctor, who had cured his wounds but not his mind, and &#145;to his natural temper and want of knowing the world, having never been much in business nor conversed much with those that were&#146;  (ibid., 6.90).<br>
<br>Once in Paris, Panmure made contact with the British ambassador, the earl of Stair, but found the way to a pardon blocked &#145;unless I would make engagements never to act according to the principles I have all my life been of&#146;  (<span class="italic">Stuart Papers</span>, 7.669&#150;70). He settled in Paris and made a trip to Maule in France, where he established a family connection to the Maules and Valoniis of Normandy. Panmure died of pleurisy in Paris on 11 April 1723, aged sixty-four. He was survived by his wife, who died on 6 December 1731. In 1717 she had been the beneficiary of an act of parliament which provided maintenance for her as if her husband was already dead. After a determined rearguard action by Lady Panmure, in which she enlisted the aid of two lords of session, the family estates, valued at &pound;3456 per annum, were sold to the York Building Company for &pound;60,400 in October 1719. The company leased them back to Lady Panmure and Harry Maule in 1724. The family regained the estates when <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/64084/', "William Maule (1699/1700&#150;1782)")</script>, son of Harry, purchased them in 1764.<br>
