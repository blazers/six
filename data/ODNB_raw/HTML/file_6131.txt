<span class="headword">Conyngham <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Denison]</span>,  Elizabeth</span>, Marchioness Conyngham  (1769&#150;1861), <span class="occ">royal mistress</span>, was born in London, the eldest of the three known children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/49178/', "Joseph Denison (c.1726&#150;1806)")</script>, cloth merchant and banker, and his wife, Elizabeth Butler. Little is known of her early life, but her father made a fortune in banking, and in 1787 purchased an estate in Surrey and another near Scarborough. Her brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7491/', "William Joseph Denison")</script>, went into the family banking business, and her sister, Anna Maria, married in 1793 Sir Robert Wenlock, later created Baron Wenlock. The following year, on 5 July, Elizabeth married Henry Conyngham.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_6131"></a><span class="headword">Henry Conyngham</span>, first Marquess Conyngham  (1766&#150;1832)<span class="occ"></span>, was born on 26 December 1766, the elder of the twin sons of Francis Pierrepoint Burton, second Baron Conyngham (<i>d</i>. 1787) (who took the surname Conyngham in 1781 on succeeding to the title), and his wife, Elizabeth Clements (<i>d</i>. 1814/1816), sister of the first earl of Leitrim. He succeeded his father as the third Baron Conyngham in 1787, and was created Viscount Conyngham in the Irish peerage in 1789. In 1794 he raised the Londonderry regiment, and was made lieutenant-colonel that August; for this action, and for his influence as a magistrate during the upheavals in Ireland in the 1790s, he was created Viscount Mountcharles and Earl Conyngham, again in the Irish peerage, on 5 November 1797. In the Irish House of Lords he was a vigorous supporter of the <span class="roman">Act of Union</span> between Britain and Ireland; when it was passed in 1801 he was elected one of the first Irish representative peers, was made a knight of St Patrick, and received &pound;15,000 in cash for his close borough of Killybegs in the Irish House of Commons. Having thus benefited considerably from the sale of his country's independence, Conyngham took little further active interest in politics, although he generally supported the tory and ministerial party in the Lords. He is said to have owed his elevation to the marquessate in 1816 to his wife's relationship with the prince regent.<br>
<br>The Conynghams were neither particularly wealthy nor particularly well connected in the early years of their marriage. In the exclusive, not to say snobbish, circles of the aristocracy, Elizabeth's mercantile origins were always held against her, and she was generally considered rather vulgar. According to Creevey, Lady Conyngham &#145;owed her first introduction to Dublin high life exclusively to Lady Glengall&#146;  (Maxwell, 371). She was, however, accounted a beauty, and acquired lovers and admirers including Lord Ponsonby and Tsar Nicholas I. (She was on the continent during the peace talks of 1814&#150;15.) She had five children who survived to adulthood, the second son becoming second Marquess Conyngham and the third, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7485/', "Albert Denison")</script>, succeeding to her brother's fortune and being created Baron Londesborough.<br>
<br>According to the duke of Wellington, Elizabeth Conyngham had decided as early as 1806 to become the mistress of George, prince of Wales  (Oman, 191). There were rumours that she was becoming his favourite by 1819, but she did not become <i>ma&icirc;tresse en titre</i> until the summer of 1820, when, according to Lady Jerningham, she finally ousted her predecessor: &#145;Lady Hertford's day is closed and Lady Conyngham is now the meteor&#146;  (Melville, 277). She was the latest (and, it proved, the last) of the series of women with whom <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/10541/', "George IV")</script> fell in love. His passion and devotion are undisputed, although even contemporaries doubted whether the relationship was physically consummated. Caricaturists and wits found the idea of the fat, ageing king and his large, ageing mistress hilarious, and the king's behaviour in public fed their humour. He was besotted with his new companion, and &#145;sits kissing her hand with a look of the most devoted submission&#146;  (Surtees, 155). During his attempt to divorce Queen Caroline in 1820 he could not keep company with Lady Conyngham, and was in consequence &#145;bored and lonely&#146;  (Lady Cowper, 17 Oct 1820, quoted in Smith, <span class="italic">Queen on Trial</span>, 122). His determination to exclude his wife from the coronation was matched by his desire to have Lady Conyngham close at hand, and throughout the ceremony he &#145;was continually nodding &amp; winking at Ly. Conyngham &amp; sighing &amp; making eyes at her&#146;, compounding his behaviour at one point by taking off a diamond brooch and kissing it at her. Some, like Mrs Arbuthnot, found his behaviour disgusting, but the more charitable Lady Cowper, writing on 20 July 1821, thought that the king had struggled to get through the service, and that &#145;a cheering draught in the shape of a look from Ly. C. &hellip; revived him like Magic or Ether&#146;  (Smith, 185). A peculiarity of the affair was that Lady Conyngham pined for the respectability her situation as a mistress fundamentally denied her, and affected great piety. She &#145;seemed to think that by the forms of religion she could atone for everything else&#146;, said the duke of Wellington  (Oman, 204).<br>
<br>Lady Conyngham, who quickly earned the nicknames La Regnante and the Vice Queen, wielded great influence over the king. Although thought to be whiggishly inclined she had no political ambition, and her power was wielded exclusively to further the personal and financial ambitions of herself and her family. Lord Conyngham was given a United Kingdom peerage in 1821, was sworn of the privy council, and appointed lord steward of the household, and captain, constable, and lieutenant of Windsor Castle, while their second son was appointed first groom of the chamber and master of the robes. The entire family lived with the king (although not directly under his roof) and at his expense, and Lady Conyngham was the recipient of constant gifts of jewels, including some sapphires from the crown jewels. Lady Granville was shown her Christmas presents in 1823:<blockquote>A magnificent cross, seized from the expiring body of a murdered bishop in the island of Scio. An almanack, gold with flowers embossed on it of precious stones. A gold melon, which upon being touched by a spring falls into compartments like the quarters of an orange, each containing different perfumes. (Surtees, 178)</blockquote>But although she had no real political ambition, Lady Conyngham's feelings and actions had political repercussions. In May 1821 her attempt to have her sons' tutor, Charles Sumner, appointed a canon of Windsor almost caused a ministerial crisis, with the prime minister, Lord Liverpool, threatening to resign if the king went ahead with the appointment. The refusal of the wives of the king's ministers to receive Lady Conyngham worsened the relationship between king and government; in particular, her feud with Lady Castlereagh (wife of the foreign secretary) caused constant political difficulties, especially concerning projected royal visits abroad. She also disliked the keeper of the privy purse, Sir Benjamin Bloomfield, and was instrumental in his removal. With his successor, Sir William Knighton, she struck up a mutually beneficial alliance.<br>
<br>Having achieved her ambition, Lady Conyngham was frequently dissatisfied with her lot. The company of the querulous, over-dependent king, who was frequently unwell, grew wearisome, and she was kept in her place only by renewed gifts of jewels. The king too grew bored, but he disliked change and with Lady Conyngham he had the comfort of a habit, and rumours of the favourite's fall from grace were always premature. George IV's death early in the morning of 26 June 1830 brought her reign to a rapid conclusion. She spent the remainder of the night packing, and by the following morning had left Windsor for her brother's house, <i>en route</i> for Paris. Society believed that she was accompanied by &#145;wagonloads&#146; of plunder; but although the king had bequeathed her all his plate and jewels (some of which, as family heirlooms, were not his to give) she refused the entire legacy.<br>
<br>Lord Conyngham, who was made a general in 1830, broke his staff of office at the king's funeral and held no further royal office. He died at his house in Hamilton Place, Piccadilly, on 28 December 1832 and was buried in the family vault at St Mary's Church, Patrixbourne, Kent. Following the death of the king, Lady Conyngham virtually disappears from the historical record. Lady Granville notes that Paris was agog to see her in August 1831, and found her to be &#145;still beautiful&#146;  (Surtees, 246). The duke of Wellington was still speaking darkly of her to his friends in the later 1830s, but thereafter the tongues that had wagged for so long fell silent. Lady Conyngham herself lived for another thirty years, enjoying the sometimes bitter fruits of her labours, dying at the age of ninety-two at her home, Bifrons, Patrixbourne, near Canterbury, Kent, on 11 October 1861. She had outlived all but one of her children. Her estate was proved at under &pound;200,000: she left her real estate to her only surviving son, Francis Nathaniel, along with her diamonds, pearls, and emeralds, which she desired should become family heirlooms. She made provision for her granddaughters out of the &pound;30,000 left to her by her banker brother, and left them her other jewels. Although Lady Conyngham was <i>persona non grata</i> at Queen Victoria's court, her son, the second marquess, had been lord chamberlain to William IV, and as such brought news of her accession to the young queen and retained his post until 1839. His daughter, Jane, Lady Churchill, was one of the queen's ladies of the bedchamber and among her closest friends.<br>
