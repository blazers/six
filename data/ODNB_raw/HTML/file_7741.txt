<span class="headword">Dodd,  Robert</span>  (1748&#150;1815), <span class="occ">marine painter and engraver</span>, was one of the three known sons of Alexander Dodd; <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7740/', "Ralph Dodd (1756?&#150;1822)")</script> was his younger brother. He began his career as a landscape painter, achieving some recognition by the age of twenty-three. He soon developed as a painter of marine scenes, having ample opportunity to study the busy shipping life of London. On 1 November 1772, when he was living in the parish of St John-at-Wapping, London, he married Mary Fulton (<i>b</i>. 1748), a spinster of the parish of St Marylebone. He first exhibited at the Society of Artists in 1780. In 1782 he exhibited three paintings at the Royal Academy and continued to exhibit there regularly until 1809.<br>
<br>Much of Dodd's work records specific battles and actions of the French Revolutionary Wars and the American War of Independence. He painted a large canvas of the battle of the First of June, 1794 (1795; NMM). In 1797, during a trip to Sheerness to &#145;get a plan of the action&#146; of the battle of Camperdown, he was described as &#145;the nice Mr Dodd&#146; for his diplomatic behaviour  (Edwards). A painting of HMS <i>Victory</i> sailing from Spithead (1791; NMM) illustrates his skill at ship portraits. His work also includes scenes of the River Thames and naval dockyards. Many of his paintings were reproduced in line or aquatint by engravers such as Robert Pollard, Frances Jukes, and Robert Laurie.<br>
<br>From about 1783 Dodd himself engraved and published over 100 aquatints of his work. Of interest are his views of the naval dockyards, including those at Chatham, Woolwich, and Deptford, and sets of engravings of the battles of the Nile, 1798 (1799), and Trafalgar, 1805 (1806). In his engravings as in his paintings his strength lies in the depiction of water and in accuracy of the details of ships' rigging, masts, and sails in different conditions. In particular he depicted storm scenes and rough seas with great realism, including a set of five paintings showing the loss of the <i>Ramillies</i>, September 1782 (1783; NMM). His prolific work is significant as a historical record, along with that of several contemporary marine painters working on the same subjects. He is sometimes confused with his brother, the painter Ralph Dodd (<i>c</i>.1756&#150;1822), who also lived and worked in London. Towards the end of his life Robert Dodd was living at Lucas Place, Commercial Road, east London. He died in 1815 and was buried on 20 February at St Dunstan and All Saints, Stepney.<br>
