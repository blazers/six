<span class="headword">March,  John</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1640, <em>d.</em> 1692), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and scholar</span>, the son of Richard March, apothecary, was baptized at St Nicholas's Church, Newcastle upon Tyne, on 17 February 1640. His parents, who died while he was a child, were said to have been Anabaptists, and after their death March was entrusted in &#145;some way&#146; to the care of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1466/', "Ambrose Barnes")</script>, a prominent north-eastern dissenter  (<span class="italic">Ambrose Barnes</span>, 144). After education at the grammar school in Newcastle under George Ritschel, a kinsman of Barnes, March matriculated as a commoner at Queen's College, Oxford, on 15 June 1657. In December 1658 he followed his tutor, Thomas Tully, to St Edmund Hall, where the latter had been elected principal. March proceeded BA in 1661, MA in 1664, and BD in 1674. From 1664 until 1672 he served as tutor and vice-principal of St Edmund Hall, where one of his pupils was John Kettlewell, later a nonjuror, and where March's son, Humphrey, matriculated in 1695.<br>
<br>March returned to the north-east in June 1672, when he was appointed by Merton College to the vicarage of Embleton in Northumberland. His abilities marked him out for an important part in the ecclesiastical affairs of the region. When Nathaniel, Lord Crewe, was translated to the palatine see of Durham in 1674 March became a chaplain to the new bishop and in 1676 he was appointed afternoon lecturer at St Nicholas's, the principal parish church in Newcastle. In 1679 he became vicar of St Nicholas's at a salary of &pound;60, with an additional &pound;10 as lecturer, and resigned the living of Embleton. In 1682 the corporation of Newcastle increased his salary to &pound;90.<br>
<br>Despite his early upbringing March was a zealous high-churchman, asserting the excellence of the Church of England against dissenters and Roman Catholics alike. An erudite preacher, he was particularly noted for his sermons at annual services held on 30 January and 29 May to mark the respective anniversaries of the martyrdom of Charles I and the restoration of Charles II. Several of these sermons, delivered before the mayor and aldermen of Newcastle, were published at the request of the hearers. One, delivered on 30 January 1677, characteristically apostrophized the dissenters as &#145;sons of <i>Belial</i>&#146;  (March, <span class="italic">A Sermon</span>, 8) and included a notable encomium on Charles I, whose <span class="italic">Eikon basilike</span> March frequently quoted. Another, <span class="italic">The False Prophet Unmask't, or, The Wolf Stript of his Sheeps-Clothing</span>, delivered on 30 January 1683, when March's brother-in-law Nicholas Ridley was sheriff of Newcastle, condemned the &#145;dangerous principle &hellip; that all power is originally seated in the people&#146;  (p. 16) and employed quotations from Augustine, Chrysostom, Ignatius, and Optatus to show the schismatical condition of the dissenters. However, March was equally prepared to contend against the errors of the Church of Rome, boldly employing arguments from Augustine, Basil, Chrysostom, Irenaeus, Jerome, and Tertullian for this purpose in an undated assize sermon delivered during the reign of James II.<br>
<br>March was not only an able controversialist, he was also a faithful and diligent parish priest. Continuing work begun by the archdeacon of Northumberland, Dr Isaac Basire, he proved remarkably successful in his efforts to restore conformity to the Church of England after the sectarian confusion of the 1650s. Constantly resident, March officiated at daily public prayers and was diligent in catechizing and in visiting the sick, while &#145;his known abilities in resolving cases of conscience drew after him a great many good people, not only of his own flock, but from remoter distances, who resorted to him as a common Oracle&#146;  (March, <span class="italic">Sermons</span>, preface). He preached effectively, in an eloquent and direct style, exhorting his hearers to holiness of life, warning against the Epicurean tendencies of &#145;the Infamous Author of the Monstrous <span class="italic">Leviathan</span>&#146;  (ibid., 19) and urging adherence to the Church of England, the nursing mother of Charles I, &#145;the first Royal Martyr that ever was in the World&#146;, of the emperor Constantine, and of &#145;<i>Lucius</i>, the first Christian King&#146;  (ibid., 123). By 1683 it was reported that &#145;Newcastle was brought to a very great degree of conformity, by the zeal and diligence of the Vicar&#146;  (&#145;Remains of Denis Granville&#146;, 167). This achievement earned March the approval of William Sancroft, the archbishop of Canterbury; Leoline Jenkins, the secretary of state; and the bishop of Oxford, Dr John Fell.<br>
<br>During the early 1680s March was a member of a clerical club which met monthly in Durham to promote church principles, &#145;according to the practice of Dr [Peter] Samways and Dr [Thomas] Comber&#146;  (<span class="italic">Remains of Denis Granville</span>, 171). At least three members of this assembly later became nonjurors (Denis Granville, archdeacon and later dean of Durham; John Cock, vicar of St Oswald's in Durham and later rector of Gateshead; and Thomas Davison, vicar of Norton, whose brother Jonathan Davison, another nonjuror, was appointed lecturer at St Nicholas's, Newcastle, in 1686). Following the revolution of 1688 March remained loyal to James II. He refused to preach at the thanksgiving service ordered by the convention on 31 January 1689 and caused the <span class="italic">Homily Against Rebellion</span> to be read instead  (<span class="italic">Ambrose Barnes</span>, 435). On the previous day, the anniversary of the martyrdom of King Charles I, in defiance of the order of the House of Lords, which for that year suppressed the official marking of the day, March had preached, as usual, in favour of passive obedience and non-resistance, denouncing the argument from self-defence as &#145;an old fanatick Principle&#146; and declaring that &#145;whoever meddled with the King's Forts, Castles, Militia and Revenue, were &hellip; guilty of Damnation&#146;  (March, <span class="italic">Vindication</span>, 3). When criticized by James Welwood, a Scottish doctor practising in Newcastle, March firmly restated his convictions: &#145;I have always preached this Doctrine on January the 30th &hellip; If the Times be changed, Truth is not, and <i>English</i> Ministers of all men ought not to be time-servers&#146;  (ibid., 6).<br>
<br>Like many high-churchmen March took the oath of allegiance to William of Orange with deep reluctance and &#145;with such a declaration or limitation as should still leave him free&#146; to serve James II  (<span class="italic">Ambrose Barnes</span>, 436). Such ambiguous behaviour caused Thomas Hearne to believe that March might have been a nonjuror  (<span class="italic">Remarks</span>, 2.60) and led to a further deterioration in his relationship with the corporation of Newcastle, which had been under strain since a disagreement over the appointment of a preaching curate for All Saints' parish in 1686. On 15 July 1690 March was warned that his salary would be stopped if he continued to refuse to name William and Mary explicitly in the state prayers, and on 3 December 1692, the day after March's death in Newcastle and before he had even been buried, the corporation resolved that his &pound;90 stipend should not be continued to any successor.<br>
<br>March was buried in St Nicholas's Church on 4 December 1692. A collection of twelve of his sermons was published in November 1693, and a second edition, with a brief biographical note of March by his fellow high-churchman John Scot, appeared in 1699.<br>
