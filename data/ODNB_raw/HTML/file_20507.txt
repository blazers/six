<span class="headword">O'Connell,  Peter</span> <span class="st"> [Peadar &Oacute; Conaill]</span>  (1754/5&#150;1826), <span class="occ">Irish scholar and lexicographer</span>, was born at Carne, now Money Point, about 5 miles east of Kilrush in co. Clare, in an Irish-speaking district. Nothing is known of his parents (he had a brother, Patrick) or his early education. A &#145;tall, gaunt, swarthy man, large-limbed and black-haired, dark-eyed, and strongly built&#146;  (Wall, 102), Peter O'Connell was a hedge-school master and scholar&#150;scribe. Typically some of his extant manuscripts contain later verse, Ossianic tales, and devotional matter. Atypically he probably possessed more printed books than other scribes, and was more acquainted with contemporary scholarship. His interests evolved towards genealogy and, more notably, towards lexicography. He possessed Edward Lhuyd's <span class="italic">Archaeologica Britannica</span> and James MacPherson's <span class="italic">Temora</span>, and knew William Shaw's <span class="italic">Galic and English Dictionary</span> (1780).<br>
<br>These books may have influenced O'Connell's remarkable decision in 1785, as he began work on an Irish&#150;English dictionary, to travel in Ireland, the Scottish highlands, and Wales, and to spend time on studying records in Dublin and at the house of Charles O'Conor at Belanagare, co. Roscommon. He returned to co. Clare in 1800. In 1812 O'Connell accepted accommodation from Dr Simon O'Reardon of Limerick to work solely on the dictionary. He was assisted by Malachi O'Curry (Maoilsheachlainn &Oacute; Comhraidhe), brother of the Irish scholar Eugene O'Curry (Eoghan &Oacute; Comhraidhe) who knew O'Connell well. He remained in Limerick until 1819 when O'Reardon died. According to S&eacute;amus &Oacute; Casaide it was most likely Dr O'Reardon's death, and not some disagreement between them, that led to O'Connell's departure and to the abandonment of preparations for the publication of his Irish dictionary. Thereafter O'Connell was obliged to return to Carne and resided for the rest of his life in his brother's house. He died aged seventy-one on 24 February 1826 and was buried at Burrane, near Killimer, Kilrush, co. Clare.<br>
<br>After his death O'Connell's dictionary was acquired by James Hardiman, who &#145;had it transcribed for the press&#146; by John O'Donovan  (Hardiman, Egerton MS 83). In 1832 Hardiman sold his manuscripts to the British Museum (the autograph of the dictionary is now Egerton MS 83 and O'Donovan's two-volume transcript is Egerton MSS 84 and 85). It was never published, but was, nevertheless, O'Connell's greatest achievement. It does not distinguish the parts of speech, and citations are far too sporadic, but it is a comprehensive delineation of the Irish lexicon. Its definitions are authoritative, and Standish Hayes O'Grady was delighted to find in it proof that native scholarship, independently of German &#145;keltologues&#146;, understood the early infixed pronouns. It has been consulted with profit by later lexicographers and editors. O'Connell led the way for the generation which made the Irish-language heritage accessible to wider scholarship. For one of the greatest of that generation, Eugene O'Curry, he was &#145;the justly celebrated Irish scholar&#146;.<br>
