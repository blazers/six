<span class="headword">Cowley, Sir  Arthur Ernest</span>  (1861&#150;1931), <span class="occ">orientalist and librarian</span>, was born on 13 December 1861 at 3 South Hill, Forest Hill, Sydenham, the fourth son among the seventeen children of Frederick Thomas Cowley (1822&#150;1881), customs house agent, and his wife, Louisa Emily, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Boddy (1830&#150;1912). He was educated at St Paul's School, London (1872&#150;9), then at Trinity College, Oxford (1879&#150;83), where he was an exhibitioner. He showed early promise but ill health and increasing interest in oriental languages resulted in his graduating with a fourth class in <i>literae humaniores</i> in 1883. Cowley then spent two years at the <i>coll&egrave;ge cantonal</i>, Lausanne, Switzerland, improving his French and German, before becoming master in modern languages successively at Sherborne School (1885&#150;9), and Magdalen College School, Oxford (1890&#150;95).<br>
<br>In 1890 Cowley had begun work on the Samaritan liturgy at the suggestion of Alfred Neubauer, sub-librarian in charge of the Bodleian Library's oriental collections, and spent his vacations working in British and continental libraries. In 1894 he and John Frederick Stenning examined Greek and Semitic manuscripts in the library of St Catherine's Monastery on Mount Sinai. He was appointed an assistant sub-librarian at the Bodleian in 1896 to help Neubauer, with whom he published <span class="italic">The Original Hebrew of a Portion of Ecclesiasticus</span> (1897), followed by <span class="italic">Facsimiles of the Fragments Hitherto Recovered of the Book of Ecclesiasticus in Hebrew</span> (1901). In 1898 he produced a revised edition of G. W. Collins's translation of Gesenius's <span class="italic">Hebrew Grammar</span>, which became the standard work of reference for English students.<br>
<br>Cowley succeeded Neubauer as sub-librarian in December 1899, also taking on his teaching of rabbinical Hebrew literature. A fellowship at Magdalen College followed in 1902. At the Bodleian he worked on a catalogue of its Sanskrit materials which was completed in 1905. With Neubauer he edited the second volume of the <span class="italic">Catalogue of Hebrew Manuscripts in the Bodleian Library</span> (1906). For this and his work with A. H. Sayce on fifth-century <span class="smallcap">BC</span> Aramaic papyri, published as <span class="italic">Aramaic Papyri Discovered at Assuan</span> (1906), he was awarded a DLitt by the university in 1908. His early studies culminated in the appearance of <span class="italic">The Samaritan Liturgy</span> in two volumes in 1909. A second, revised, edition of Gesenius followed in 1910. He was elected Sandars reader in bibliography at Cambridge in 1912.<br>
<br>On 3 April 1913 at St Margaret's, Westminster, Cowley married Mabel Beatrice Watts (<i>d</i>. 1950), of St Osyth's Priory, Essex, the second daughter of William Longmore Watts, rector of Boxted, Essex. The couple had no children of their own but adopted two sons. The war found Cowley too old for active service but in 1917 he spent six months with a British ambulance unit in France. In December 1918 he delivered the Schweich lectures on biblical archaeology at the British Academy, published as <span class="italic">The Hittites</span> in 1920. He was elected a fellow of the British Academy in July 1919, and served on its council from 1922 until 1931.<br>
<br>In 1919 Cowley succeeded Falconer Madan as Bodley's librarian. He began by tackling the problem of the growth of the unwieldy transcribed catalogue of printed books. Attempts to publish it were abandoned on grounds of cost and Cowley inaugurated a new catalogue on printed slips for all books published after 1919. His time as librarian was, however, chiefly characterized by his desire to see a unified library management system in the university, to be achieved by staffing other institutions from the Bodleian, the principle of dependent libraries. The process began in 1923, when a Bodleian assistant took charge of a separate library for law students. In 1927 the Radcliffe Library of scientific and medical books and the Indian Institute Library were placed under Bodley's librarian. Finally in 1929 the Rhodes House Library for books on the British dominions and colonies, the United States, and Africa was set up. A third, pressing concern was the perennial one of storage space for the ever-growing collections. The transfer to the Ashmolean Museum of collections of coins and engraved portraits helped, but much more space was needed. As early as 1921 Cowley had maintained that the existing library buildings could not be abandoned. He favoured the retention of the old library and the construction of an extension on the other side of Broad Street. After a decade of argument and discussions this idea was the one largely adopted shortly before his retirement.<br>
<br>Cowley still found time to pursue his scholarly interests. In 1923 he published <span class="italic">The Aramaic Papyri of the Fifth Century</span>, a revision of his 1906 work, incorporating the critical results of the best-known Semitic scholars, his original text largely unaltered. The publication of <span class="italic">A Concise Catalogue of the Hebrew Printed Books in the Bodleian Library</span>, the culmination of thirteen years' work, followed in 1929.<br>
<br>Cowley's strength as a scholar lay not so much in high originality as in a complete mastery of his chosen field, to which he brought a painstaking and thorough accuracy. His knowledge of Hebrew and Aramaic was exhaustive. Combined, they marked him out as one of the leading Semitic scholars of his day.<br>
<br>As Bodley's librarian Cowley became more and more taken up with congresses, conferences, and international boards. In 1926, the year he received a DLitt from Cambridge University, he was invited to serve on the International Committee of Bibliography, becoming its chairman. The following year he was elected a corresponding member of the Institut de France, and also appointed a member of the royal commission on national museums and galleries. In June 1931 his knighthood was announced.<br>
<br>By then Cowley was already too ill to perform his duties in the library. On 3 May he had undergone an operation for the removal of a malignant tumour. He remained in hospital until the beginning of August, and resigned as Bodley's librarian on 31 July. While recuperating in Eastbourne he suffered a stroke; after returning to Oxford he had a second stroke and died at his home at 1 Holywell in the early hours of 12 October 1931. He was cremated at Golders Green crematorium on 14 October. His estate was bequeathed in trust to the university for the benefit of the Bodleian Library, subject to certain annuities.<br>
<br>Cowley had a strong muscular frame and generally enjoyed good health, though he was not fond of exercise. He had a Roman nose, a dignified bearing, with a red complexion and fierce blue eyes, which belied his nature; he was cheerful, genial, and kind, and always ready with help and advice when asked. He had a remarkable capacity for friendship with young and old alike, and was quickly on easy terms with all. Immensely sociable, he was a member of several Oxford common rooms, various dining clubs, and two London clubs, the Athenaeum and the Union. He was an enthusiastic freemason and filled various high offices, including mastership of the university lodge.<br>
