<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Cummings,  Arthur John</span>  (1882&#150;1957), <span class="occ">journalist and author</span>, was born at Barnstaple, Devon, on 22 May 1882, the third child and eldest of the three sons of John Cummings, journalist, north Devon representative of the <span class="italic">Devon and Exeter Gazette</span>, and his wife, Maria Elizabeth Richards. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32663/', "Bruce Cummings")</script> was his youngest brother. He attended Rock Park School, Barnstaple, excelling at his studies. A key influence at the school in the development both of his ethical views and of his appreciation of literature was Philip Ernest Richards, then an Oxford undergraduate, later a Unitarian minister before becoming a professor of English in Lahore.<br>
<br>Cummings hoped to study law at Oxford, but had to abandon this ambition when his father became seriously ill. He joined the <span class="italic">Devon and Exeter Gazette</span>, quickly being given responsibility for writing pieces on a wide sweep of subjects, from musical notices to leading articles and even stock market reports. From Devon he moved successively to the <span class="italic">Rochdale Observer</span>, the <span class="italic">Sheffield Telegraph</span>, and, just before the outbreak of the First World War in 1914, the <span class="italic">Yorkshire Post</span>. He served with the Territorial 4th West Riding (howitzer) brigade, Royal Fleet Auxiliary, seeing action on the western front and being promoted captain. In 1908 he married Lilian, daughter of John Boreham, of Sheffield. She died seven months later of peritonitis. In 1915 he married an artist, Nora, daughter of Arthur Suddards, bank inspector, of Leeds. They had a son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/69184/', "Michael Cummings (1919&#150;1997)")</script>, a political cartoonist, and a daughter, Jean, a journalist.<br>
<br>After the war Cummings became an assistant editor on the <span class="italic">Yorkshire Post</span>. But the paper was generally Conservative in alignment, and politics had become increasingly important to Cummings, as he had developed into, and remained, &#145;an ardent Liberal&#146; of the distinctly older, nonconformist, style. He eagerly accepted an invitation in 1920 to become an assistant editor of the <span class="italic">Daily News</span> (later the <span class="italic">News Chronicle</span>) and remained with that paper for thirty-five years. He became deputy editor and then political editor. He reported on the economic conference at Ottawa in 1932 and was scathing of the government for the agreements reached there. In 1933 he wrote brilliantly on both the Reichstag fire trial and the trial of British engineers in Moscow, with each report showing his deep hatred of totalitarianism and injustice. For his foreign correspondence of that year he was given a Selfridge award.<br>
<br>Of Cummings between the wars it has been said that he was &#145;the unsparing critic of Conservative governments &hellip; No other journalist did as much &hellip; to keep the spirit of Liberalism alive in the country during this unhappy period&#146;  (Cruikshank). By the late thirties he was perhaps the political commentator with the largest readership in Britain, through his twice-weekly &#145;Spotlight on politics&#146;. Although remaining a committed Liberal, Cummings &#145;fraternized&#146; with Labour&#151;something for which he was occasionally criticized&#151;particularly in order to develop a broad left opposition to appeasement with Hitler. In mid-1939 he advocated a Liberal constituency agreement with Labour to &#145;avoid splitting the anti-appeasement vote&#146;  (Koss, 591).<br>
<br>Politics and ethics were the key to Cummings's life. As the &#145;Liberal conscience of Fleet Street&#146;  (Abel), he also earned his description as &#145;a cheerful Puritan&#146;. Robin Cruikshank said that he could &#145;well imagine him in Oliver Cromwell's army&#146;, fighting as a &#145;Radical patriot&#146;  (Cruikshank). The Institute of Journalists elected him president for 1952&#150;3. In his presidential address he declared his support for the recently established Press Council to monitor standards and ethics in the press. But he also condemned the threat from an over-indulgent use of parliamentary privilege to raise &#145;pompous or frivolous claims&#146;, as a way of reducing &#145;necessary or legitimate criticism&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 6 July 1957, 10).<br>
<br>Cummings's books included <span class="italic">The Moscow Trial</span> (1933), <span class="italic">The Press and a Changing Civilisation</span> (1936), and <span class="italic">This England</span> (1945). He retired from the <span class="italic">News Chronicle</span> in 1955, and died at 6 Heather Gardens, Golders Green, Middlesex, on 4 July 1957. He was buried six days later. His wife survived him.<br>
