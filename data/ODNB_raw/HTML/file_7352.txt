<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Dawson,  Matthew</span>  (1820&#150;1898), <span class="occ">racehorse trainer</span>, second son of George Dawson (<i>d</i>. 1846), himself a trainer, and his wife, Jean Alison, was born at Stamford Hall, Gullane, East Lothian, on 20 January 1820. After a demanding apprenticeship under his father, in 1838 he became head lad to his eldest brother, Thomas, at Middleham in Yorkshire but returned to Scotland two years later to train on his own account. He married, on 8 July 1844, at Kilwinning, Mary Rose (<i>d</i>. 1895). Shortly after the death of his father in November 1846, Dawson left Scotland to train for Lord John Scott and his racing partner, Sir John Don-Wauchope. When Lord John gave up racing in 1857 Dawson arranged the sale of his stud to the wealthy Scottish ironmaster James Merry and became Merry's private trainer at Russley, near Lambourn in Berkshire. In 1860 he gained a great success for his master with Thormanby, who won the Derby and cleared &pound;40,000 in bets.<br>
<br>Six years later Dawson left Russley, following differences with Merry (never an easy man to serve), and started as a public trainer at Newmarket, where he bought Heath House. There his principal owners were the heavy-betting dukes of Hamilton and Newcastle, both ultimately forced to leave the turf by their gambling debts. In 1869, however, he secured as a patron the non-gambling Lord Falmouth, who was concerned only with winning important races. Together with the champion jockey Fred Archer, Dawson and Lord Falmouth formed a triumphant trio, winning two Derbys, three Oaks, three St Legers, three One Thousand Guineas, and three Two Thousand Guineas. In 1885, the year after Lord Falmouth retired from the turf, Dawson handed over Heath House to his nephew George H. Dawson and moved to Exning Manor, Suffolk, with just a few horses. Nevertheless, at the age of seventy-five he trained Sir Visto to win both the Derby and St Leger of 1895. That year he retired, but returned to Newmarket two years later to live at Waterloo Lodge, where he died on 18 August 1898.<br>
<br>Although he had no children, Dawson passed on his training skills to many who gained their initial tuition in his yard, including his nephews George and John Dawson, and George Blackwell, Felix Leach, William Walters, and Richard Waugh. His brothers Thomas (<i>d</i>. 1880), Joseph (<i>d</i>. 1880), and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32754/', "John Dawson")</script> were also trainers. As <span class="italic">Baily's Magazine</span> said of them collectively, &#145;their manners are courteous, their stable management has passed into a proverb, and their judgement of a yearling is held in as high repute as their irreproachable taste for whisky&#146;. But Matthew was the outstanding figure. Small in stature, immaculate in dress, and autocratic in his training methods, he won twenty-eight classics, including six Derbys.<br>
