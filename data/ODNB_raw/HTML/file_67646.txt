<span class="headword">Jaeger,  August Johannes</span>  (1860&#150;1909), <span class="occ">music critic</span>, was born on 18 March 1860 in D&uuml;sseldorf, Germany, the second son and the third of the six surviving children of Gottfried Jaeger (1822&#150;1880), a cattle dealer, and his wife, Caroline Obenstintenberg (1826&#150;1910). He was educated at the D&uuml;sseldorf Gymnasium and also received tuition in violin and piano, in which instruments he became proficient, although he was forbidden by his father from pursuing a professional musical career. Despite D&uuml;sseldorf's longstanding musical traditions, Jaeger left the city in 1878 at the age of eighteen, turning his back, like many others, on Bismarckian authoritarianism in favour of the liberalism of the &#145;land without music&#146;  (Northrop Moore, 48). He settled with his family in London, working as a clerk while continuing to pursue music through choral singing and frequent concertgoing. In particular he followed the Richter concerts, with their revelatory programmes of the most modern orchestral music of the day&#151;particularly Wagner, to whom the young enthusiast became devoted. His first opportunities to experience the music dramas themselves came in 1882, when three complete cycles of <span class="italic">The Ring</span> were given in London, together with the English premi&egrave;res of <span class="italic">The Mastersingers</span> and <span class="italic">Tristan</span>.<br>
<br>In 1890 Jaeger was appointed publishing office manager of Novellos, the leading English music publisher of the time. He gradually became an unofficial musical adviser with a highly individual position, enabling him to pursue a personal mission to discover and encourage new English composers. Ideally placed in a position of some power, he built up a wide network of contacts in support of his efforts, joining the ranks of the critics when he became a staff writer for the <span class="italic">Musical Times</span>. This enabled him to add campaigning journalism to his direct lobbying of conductors, the Novello's directors, and others, in a determined search for performance and publication opportunities for new composers. Most importantly, he offered direct encouragement and technical advice through detailed and sometimes extended correspondence, where a rigorous critical judgement was fully and frankly exercised, albeit in a warm and personal way; several of his prot&eacute;g&eacute;s became family friends. But the response from Novellos could be negative and frustrating, as Jaeger tended to be seen as something of an advanced left-winger in an essentially conservative musical establishment slow to embrace the new.<br>
<br>During the 1890s Jaeger did much to establish the reputation of the American Horatio Parker, but his most important efforts during this period were on behalf of Edward Elgar, Walford Davies, and Samuel Coleridge-Taylor, in support of whose highly successful <span class="italic">Hiawatha's Wedding Feast</span> he gave much specific criticism and advice. Shortly after its first performance, on 22 December 1898 Jaeger married Isabella Donkersley (1864&#150;1938), a former violin student at the Royal College of Music. She combined occasional work as a soloist with teaching, providing extra income to support their two children when Jaeger had to retire early through ill health.<br>
<br>During his career Jaeger actively helped a variety of other young composers, including Cyril Scott, Havergal Brian, Josef Holbrooke, John McEwen, John Foulds, and William Henry Bell; and even such a senior figure as Hubert Parry benefited from his advice. But it is for his work for Elgar, with whom he first made contact in 1897 and with whom he enjoyed an instant rapport, that he is best known. He worked tirelessly to encourage the frequently moody composer, to smooth his path at Novellos, to ensure the accurate production of his scores&#151;often against tight deadlines&#151;and to engineer performances of his works at home and abroad, particularly in Germany. He directly exercised critical judgement over the <span class="italic">Enigma Variations</span> and <span class="italic">The Dream of Gerontius</span>, insisting on important changes, and he largely suggested the form and instrumentation of the <span class="italic">Introduction and Allegro for Strings</span>. In order, too, to prepare the public for the new complexities of Elgar's oratorios, Jaeger wrote lengthy analyses of these works at great labour, although he failed to please the composer by an oversimplistic labelling of leitmotifs. Such efforts further weakened a constitution already at risk from chronic overwork, and lowered resistances exacerbated a family tendency to tuberculosis. Despite treatments at Swiss sanatoria, partly financed by Parry, Jaeger died at his home, 37 Curzon Road, Muswell Hill, on 18 May 1909, aged forty-nine. He was cremated at Golders Green on 22 May.<br>
<br>By temperament Jaeger was essentially an artist, ill-adjusted to the drudgery of office routine, but the exigencies of life put him in a position where his own practical musicianship became subsumed into wider fields; one of the obituaries wrote of &#145;his genius for discovering genius&#146;  (Allen, 283), and Jaeger may be said to have done as much if not more than anyone not a composer or conductor to contribute to the dynamic of the English musical renaissance, albeit from a strongly German perspective. His superbly well-judged suggestions for improvement in Elgar's music remain without parallel in relations between composer and publisher, and his D&uuml;sseldorf contacts paved the way for performances of Elgar's music in Germany which established the composer's reputation in his own country as well as in Europe. Elgar recorded deep gratitude for his friend's intimate understanding and encouragement in the celebrated &#145;Nimrod&#146; movement of the <span class="italic">Enigma Variations</span>, music which has become a familiar part of English national life and cultural heritage, even if the unmistakably German name of its modest, frail, but determined subject has remained known to comparatively few. And Elgar knew that the movement does not portray the whole man, for he wrote that, in order fully to portray Jaeger's character and temperament, something &#145;ardent and mercurial&#146; would have been needed.<br>
