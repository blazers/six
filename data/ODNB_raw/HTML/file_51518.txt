<span class="headword">Brown,  James</span>  (1921&#150;1993), <span class="occ">petroleum engineer</span>, was born on 13 March 1921 at 151 Cartvale Road, Glasgow, the son of William Brown, engineer's toolmaker, and his wife, Margaret-Ann, formerly Cameron. Brown was educated at Queen's Park secondary school, Glasgow, then became a tax officer, an experience which stood him in good stead when he joined Shell. The Second World War changed his life. Enlisted in the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders, he underwent tough commando training in Lochaber, and volunteered&#151;the youngest to be accepted&#151;for the hazardous raid on the U-boat pens of St Nazaire in 1942. Along with other members of no. 5 commando, Brown protected HMS <i>Campbelltown</i>, which, disguised as a German ship, rammed the dock gates with explosive; inevitably, he was captured. He was dispatched to Stalag 8B, 60 miles east of Breslau. An ever-determined escaper, his first attempt ended in tragi-comedy. He managed to dye his overcoat and scarf with polish. Alas, with sweat, the polish began to run on to his neck and skin, presenting a most remarkable spectacle. So he dived into a public lavatory in the town of Opeln, only to find that five minutes later the door was forced open by two members of the Gestapo. They frogmarched him, and made him sit between them on a tramcar on the way back to camp. Nothing daunted, when the conductor came along, Brown said sweetly: &#145;A penny half to Sauchiehall Street, Missus!&#146; Even the Gestapo, one of whom had been in Britain before the war, did not suppress a smirk. After further unsuccessful attempts to escape, it was &#145;Fifth Time Lucky&#146;, the title of his memoirs, and a dramatic escape to Switzerland, where he worked on an English-language publication until the autumn of 1944, when the American army reached the Franco-Swiss border. Brown was awarded the Military Medal.<br>
<br>On demobilization Brown became a miner in Auchengeoch colliery, near Glasgow. A grant from the commandos gave him entrance to the mining engineering course at the Royal Technical College in Glasgow, and subsequently Glasgow University. On 18 June 1948 he married Catherine Ann MacDonald (1923&#150;1990), a clerk, and from 1948 until 1975, he worked for Shell in Trinidad, Turkey, Kuwait, and Venezuela, but frequently returned to London and the Netherlands to participate in Shell's most advanced training courses.<br>
<br>Brown had a global understanding of the oil industry. Briefing government officials and ministers on legislation on North Sea oil in the period 1975&#150;90, he would insist: &#145;If you do things purely for the advantage of Britain in UK legislation, just remember that there is a tit-for-tat effect.&#146;<br>
<br>At fifty-four Brown was recruited as the first professor of petroleum engineering at Heriot-Watt. This Edinburgh engineering and science-based university had by 1975 an internationally formidable reputation in offshore engineering, and now needed to develop the expertise needed to get the reserves out of the sea-bed. He also brought to Heriot-Watt immense and important goodwill: Royal Dutch Shell crucially lent him the services of a clever young Dutchman, Bau van Ort. Brown was uniquely placed to get money out of the oil companies for the young department and gathered around him a talented and subsequently distinguished staff who were united in their respect for the blunt and genial professor.<br>
<br>Brown and his ever supportive wife entertained many overseas students at their house at Dundarroch on Loch Ard, near Aberfoyle. Incalculable goodwill towards Britain remained with many of those who shared these beautiful surroundings, and subsequently attained important posts in their own country's oil industry. After Brown retired in 1981 he worked for Britoil, and set up a company: Edinburgh Petroleum Services. His wife died suddenly in Tenerife, where they had gone for health reasons in 1990. Brown moved to Hampshire, where his son William Allan Brown was living, and he died at Frimley Park Hospital, Surrey, on 5 December 1993.<br>
