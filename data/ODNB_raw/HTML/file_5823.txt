<span class="headword">Cokayne <span class="st"> [<em>alias </em>Browne]</span>,  Thomas</span> <span class="st"> [<em>pseud. </em>T. C.]</span>  (1587&#150;1638), <span class="occ">lexicographer</span>, was born on 21 January 1587 at Mapleton, near Ashbourne, Derbyshire, the son of Sir Edward Cokayne of Ashbourne (<i>d</i>. 1606), sheriff of the county, and his wife, Jane (<i>d</i>. 1647), daughter of Sir Nicholas Ashby of Willoughby in the Wolds, Nottinghamshire. He was the grandson of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5822/', "Sir Thomas Cokayne of Ashbourne (1519&#150;1592)")</script>, sheriff of Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire, and author of <span class="italic">A Short Treatise of Hunting</span> (1591).<br>
<br>Thomas Cokayne entered Corpus Christi College, Oxford, but left without taking a degree, probably upon his inheritance of Ashbourne Hall and other family properties at his father's death. Shortly afterwards he married Anne (or Ann) Stanhope (<i>c</i>.1592&#150;1664), who was the daughter of Sir John Stanhope, of Elvaston, Derbyshire, and his wife, Dorothy Trentham, and half-sister of Philip Stanhope, first earl of Chesterfield. The eldest of their seven children was the poet <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5819/', "Sir Aston Cokayne, baronet")</script>.<br>
<br>Neither the grapes of Ashbourne's vineyards, however, nor the asparagus, apricots, and peaches of her gardens that Aston would write about in his poem to his mother in 1658 sufficed to keep Thomas Cokayne from leaving his wife, two sons, and five daughters shortly after 1616 to go to London, where he took lodgings in Gray's Inn Lane and lived under the assumed name of Browne (or Brown). A letter from John Donne to Anne Cokayne, who &#145;warmly engaged Donne's affections&#146;  (Bald, 501) in the late 1620s, suggests that Thomas Cokayne's &#145;perversnesse&#146; put her to the &#145;necessity of hiding&#146; her sons  (<span class="italic">A Collection of Letters</span>, 345) to prevent his discovering their whereabouts. Presumably Donne visited Ashbourne more than once, for a room there was long known as &#145;Dr Donne's chamber&#146;. In &#145;An Epitaph on my Father Mr. Tho. Cokain&#146;  (<span class="italic">Poems</span>, 128 [i.e. 228]), Aston Cokayne expresses no bitterness but praises his father's &#145;great worth&#146; and implies that Thomas Cokayne experienced a spiritual awakening, choosing to sacrifice &#145;all terrene wealth&#146;.<br>
<br>Details of Thomas Cokayne's life in London are not recorded, but it appears that he devoted his energies to lexicography. Anthony Wood claimed that he wrote, in collaboration with unnamed assistants, <span class="italic">A Greek English lexicon, containing the derivations and various significations of all the words in the New Testament</span> (&#145;By <i>T. C.</i> late of C. C. C. in <i>Oxford</i>&#146;), published posthumously in 1658, in which the etymologies, denotations, and connotations of biblical Greek words are expounded, with extensive references to <span class="roman">New Testament</span> chapters and verses. The lexicon is supplemented by Greek and English indexes (evidently prepared by Henry Jessey); an explication, verse by verse, word by word, of the book of <span class="roman">Romans</span>, chapter two; and an essay on Greek and Hebrew dialects. It is, according to the author, &#145;fitted for [those of] the meanest capacity&#146;, ignorant of Latin, who through diligent use of the lexicon may comprehend Greek more quickly and more fully than &#145;many who have spent many years time in <i>Cambridg</i> or <i>Oxford</i> to their friends no small expence and charges&#146;&#151;all for the &#145;bare price of this book&#146;  (T. C., <span class="italic">A Greek English Lexicon</span>, 1658, foreword). The work was reissued in 1661 with the title <span class="italic">An English-Greek Lexicon</span>, &#145;published, and recommended to all&#146; by eight nonconformist London ministers, including Joseph Caryl, who had &#145;a prime hand&#146; in the work  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 3.982), and George Cokayne (possibly a relation of Thomas Cokayne). The 1658 work has variously been attributed to each of them.<br>
<br>Having just passed his fifty-first birthday, Thomas Cokayne died at London and was buried on 27 January 1638 in the church of St Giles-in-the-Fields. On 6 December 1638 administration of his personal effects was granted in London; and in 1640 an inquisition post mortem was held concerning his estates at Ashbourne and Pooley, Warwickshire. His widow retired to Ashbourne Hall where she died on 29 August 1664, aged about seventy-two. She was &#145;an honourable person &hellip; a royalist, of highest elevation, yet a woman of sense&#146;  (<span class="italic">History &hellip; of Ashbourn</span>, 24). Her nephew, the poet Charles Cotton, called her &#145;Mrs. Cokain in the Peake&#146;, an allusion to her eccentric headdress  (<span class="italic">N&amp;Q</span>, 3rd ser., 4, 1963, 415&#150;16).<br>
