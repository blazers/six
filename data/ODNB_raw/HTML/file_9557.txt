<span class="headword">Fitzgerald,  Gerald <span class="st"> [Garret, Gear&oacute;id]</span></span>, eleventh earl of Kildare  (1525&#150;1585), <span class="occ">magnate</span>, was born on 28 February 1525, the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9555/', "Gerald Fitzgerald, ninth earl of Kildare (1487&#150;1534)")</script>, lord deputy of Ireland, and his second wife, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/69231/', "Elizabeth Fitzgerald (fl. 1514&#150;1548)")</script>, noblewoman, daughter of Thomas Grey, first marquess of Dorset, and his wife, Cicely. As a younger son his immediate prospects were not promising, and they worsened when his half-brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9586/', "Thomas Fitzgerald, nicknamed Silken Thomas, tenth earl of Kildare (1513&#150;1537)")</script>, led an abortive rebellion in 1534. After the rebellion the government sought to capture the leading Fitzgeralds of Kildare, including Gerald Fitzgerald, Silken Thomas's heir. Although suffering from smallpox, Fitzgerald was harboured from the government, initially by his tutor Thomas Leverous, then by his paternal aunt Eleanor, widow of Donnell MacCarthy Reagh. Both exploited the Geraldine network to hide Fitzgerald in a succession of safe houses. Fitzgerald's uncle <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/11551/', "Leonard Grey, Viscount Graney (c.1490&#150;1541)")</script>, the lord deputy, was later accused of allowing him to escape, but the reality was that once the fugitive had left the vicinity of the pale the government could do little to secure his surrender.<h2>
<a name="Attainderexileandrehabilitation15341556"></a>Attainder, exile, and rehabilitation, 1534&#150;1556</h2>Upon the execution of his brother and five uncles in 1537, the fugitive Fitzgerald became heir to the earldom of Kildare, abolished by act of attainder in 1536. Restoring his house became Fitzgerald's driving ambition. The execution of the leading Geraldines also ensured that his protectors would not surrender him. The government's concern to seize Fitzgerald increased when his guardians, faced with the loss of their factional leader, formed a coalition, essentially aimed at re-establishing the Kildare ascendancy in Ireland. That Fitzgerald supplied a focus for Gaelic dynasts and traditional enemies like Conn Bacach O'Neill (<i>c</i>.1482&#150;1559) and Manus O'Donnell, who married Eleanor MacCarthy in June 1538, against government authority was only marginally less worrying than the Geraldine league's continental links. The pale, it was rumoured, stood ready to rise in support of Fitzgerald if continental assistance was forthcoming, but the league's ephemeral nature was revealed by its collapse after Grey's victory over the combined forces of O'Neill and O'Donnell at Bellahoe, co. Monaghan, in August 1539. The lord deputy's desolation of O'Neill's country in 1540 prompted the Ulster chieftains to evacuate Fitzgerald from Ireland.<br>
<br>In May 1540 Fitzgerald secured passage to St Malo. His flight did not much reassure the government. The situation in 1540 was &#145;moche to be doubted&#146;  (<span class="italic">State Papers, Henry VIII</span>, 3.234) and could be transformed if Henry VIII's continental enemies intervened. Accordingly, Fitzgerald's arrest remained a priority until the king's death. After arriving in St Malo, Fitzgerald travelled to the French court upon invitation, doggedly pursued by English envoys. To avoid a diplomatic rupture with England he was swiftly moved on, briefly also visiting Charles V's court. Yet his significance was lost on neither monarch; both granted him pensions. Eventually Fitzgerald reached Florence and the court of Cardinal Reginald Pole (1500&#150;1558), which remained his primary residence during his continental sojourn. Pole, a relative and fellow exile active against Henry, undertook to maintain Fitzgerald (who was doubtless seen by him as a useful asset in his intrigues) and secured him a gentleman's education. While Fitzgerald's partisan Richard Stanihurst later sought to distance him from England's continental enemies, cultivating an image of him as the quintessential Renaissance noble, Fitzgerald actually actively sought French aid to restore his house. In 1543, 1544, and 1545 it was rumoured that he would lead French expeditions to effect a Geraldine restoration and expel the English from Ireland.<br>
<br>Nevertheless, throughout the 1540s Fitzgerald continually negotiated with English representatives. By 1547, increasingly frustrated at the absence of French military support, he made preliminary overtures about pardon and restoration. Henry's death in January 1547 greatly facilitated this process. Edward Seymour, duke of Somerset, the lord protector, was anxious to rehabilitate Fitzgerald, to end both the threat of foreign intervention in Ireland as the Anglo-Scottish war intensified and the chronic instability in the Irish midlands&#151;traditionally policed by the Kildares&#151;fuelled by the abandonment of the conciliation policy. Somerset blamed Fitzgerald's earlier defiance on misguided advice by his guardians and persuaded Fitzgerald's mother, who was living at court, to entreat him to return. Fitzgerald, still not wholly trusting the government, secured a full pardon in March 1549 before arriving in England in July that year.<br>
<br>Soon afterwards Fitzgerald met Mabel (<i>d</i>. 1610), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/3665/', "Sir Anthony Browne (c.1500&#150;1548)")</script> of Cowdray Park, Sussex, and his wife, Alice. They married on 29 May 1554 in the Chapel Royal, having obtained the marriage licence the previous day. They went on to have three sons, Gerald Fitzgerald (1559&#150;1580), Henry Fitzgerald, twelfth earl of Kildare (1562&#150;1597), and William Fitzgerald, thirteenth earl of Kildare (<i>d</i>. 1599), and two daughters, Mary (1556&#150;1610) and Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1617). Fitzgerald's brother-in-law was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/3667/', "Anthony Browne, first Viscount Montagu (1528&#150;1592)")</script>. Mainly through Montagu's influence, Fitzgerald was fully restored to favour, receiving some of his lands back in 1552&#150;3, being knighted about 1552, and culminating on 13 May 1554 with his creation as earl of Kildare and baron of Offaly. He signed the letters patent for Edward VI's alteration of the succession on 16 June 1553 but quickly ingratiated himself with Mary I by distinguishing himself during the rebellion of Sir Thomas Wyatt the younger in 1554. By May 1555 nearly all lands forfeited by the 1536 attainder were returned, and in November 1556 Kildare was sent to Ireland with the recommendation of Philip II. The annalists recorded &#145;great rejoicing throughout the greater part of Leath-Mhogha because of their [the earl and countess's] arrival; for it was thought that not one of the descendants of the earls of Kildare &hellip; would ever come to Ireland&#146;  (<span class="italic">AFM</span>, s.a. 1553 [<i>sic</i>]).<h2>
<a name="Restoration15561564"></a>Restoration, 1556&#150;1564</h2>Kildare immediately sought to restore the Geraldines' former glory and symbolically began to rebuild his family's homes. He also began the reconstruction of the Geraldine network, entertaining traditional clients shortly after his return. In 1556 he hastened into Ulster to assist his relative <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20785/', "Shane O'Neill (c.1530&#150;1567)")</script> against local rivals. Kildare's ultimate ambition was to recover the deputyship but his immediate goal was the restoration of the liberty of Kildare and its extension to include the border lordships. This brought him into conflict with supporters of plantation as a solution to endemic disorder on the pale borders, namely the New English community who were already threatened by the earl's restoration as their influence rested largely on their acquisition of confiscated Fitzgerald lands. Kildare's re-establishment offered the cheaper alternative of magnate management of the borders, and when Sir Anthony St Leger, the lord deputy, appointed the earl as governor of Offaly in early 1556 it appeared that a return to aristocratic delegation was imminent.<br>
<br>The appointment as lord deputy of Thomas Radcliffe, Viscount Fitzwalter, in April 1556 was an equal relief to the planters as it was a disappointment to Kildare, since the new governor transformed the Leix-Offaly plantation into an entirely New English project. In October 1557 Radcliffe (now third earl of Sussex) appointed his brother Sir Henry Radcliffe as governor of Leix-Offaly, cancelling Kildare's commission. In response, Kildare accelerated his pursuit of the restoration of the liberty of Kildare, now envisaged as including Offaly and the levy of bonnacht (tribute to maintain soldiers) and other dues traditionally imposed by earls of Kildare on the marches. The early optimism of Kildare's return to Ireland was dissipated by the crown's refusal to countenance his proposals, and his bid for liberty seriously soured relations with Sussex. In June 1558 Sussex dealt a further blow by extending his brother's authority throughout the pale. This threatened to rob Kildare of his <i>raison d'&ecirc;tre</i>&#151;for what use was an earl of Kildare without responsibility for the borders?<br>
<br>In his search for a method to discredit Sussex, Kildare focused on Shane, on whose removal from power in Tyrone the lord deputy had staked his credibility. As Shane's &#145;disobedience&#146; during 1558 and 1559 increased, Sussex claimed that Kildare was the real instigator of the disorder, and director of the pale gentry's increasingly vocal complaints against Sussex's excessive financial impositions. He blamed Kildare for fomenting opposition because &#145;the gouernment of this realm is not commyted to him, as it hath beene to others of his ancestors before&#146;  (<span class="italic">Calendar of Carew Manuscripts</span>, 300&#150;04). On Sussex's recommendation Kildare was summoned to court on suspicion of conspiring with the dissident Gerald FitzJames Fitzgerald. Opportunely for Kildare, Sir Robert Dudley emerged as Elizabeth I's favourite and saw in the earl an opportunity to discomfit Sussex, a factional opponent. Attaching Kildare to his emerging party, Dudley had the earl cleared of any suspicion of treason and, after Sussex's 1561 campaign against O'Neill disintegrated, Dudley and Kildare convinced Elizabeth to negotiate with Shane. Kildare was dispatched in triumph to secure Shane's attendance at court. Sussex remained as lord lieutenant (having been promoted in May 1560) until May 1564, but this Geraldine &#145;solution&#146; fatally compromised his authority and Sir Nicholas Arnold, who acted as lord justice, replaced him.<h2>
<a name="Factionandfavour15641571"></a>Faction and favour, 1564&#150;1571</h2>Arnold was extremely unpopular with the New English administration and garrison, whom he had been commissioned to investigate for corruption. Consequently, he relied heavily on Kildare for support. In return Arnold allowed Kildare the role he craved, protector of the borders. The lord justice reduced the midlands garrison and hounded Sir Henry Radcliffe into resigning his post, thus allowing Kildare considerable latitude to deal with the midlands disturbances. Arnold's support for Kildare infuriated the New English. Sir William Fitzwilliam, vice-treasurer of Ireland, claimed that Kildare was causing disorder against the garrisons as a prelude to regaining traditional Geraldine authority in Offaly and the borders. Kildare also made incursions into Annaly, Fercall, Offaly, and east Br&eacute;ifne, ostensibly to pursue fleeing midland rebels, but, as Fitzwilliam indicated, really to bind those lordships &#145;to be true and faithful to hym and his posteritie for ever&#146;. Moreover, he claimed, Kildare, with Arnold's connivance, also overawed the pale, imposing coign and livery and retaining &#145;all the bastard Geraldines that be hys kinsmen&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 63/15/54). Arnold's support, however, meant such charges were disregarded; indeed, he imprisoned one of Kildare's most vocal critics, Oliver Sutton, for sixteen weeks for denouncing Kildare as Gerald Fitzgerald, eighth earl of Kildare (1456?&#150;1513), &#145;redivivus [restored]&#146;  (ibid.).<br>
<br>Kildare's influence in the pale and its western marches expanded greatly during Arnold's administration. Similarly, when Sir Henry Sidney arrived as lord deputy in January 1566, Kildare benefited from the support of another prot&eacute;g&eacute; of Dudley (now earl of Leicester). Sidney's expansive programme and his feud with Thomas Butler, eleventh earl of Ormond, made Kildare his main support in Leinster. When Shane sought to foment dissension in the pale borders in 1566 and 1567 Kildare prevented any outbreaks:<blockquote>As towchinge all Leinster and Methe, I dare affirme, upon my Credite, unto your Majestie, aswell for the English Pale, and the Justice thereof: It was never, in the Memorie of the oldest Man that now liveth, in greater Quiet and Obedience &hellip; And so well was the English Pale garded in myne absence, chieflie by the diligente and paynefull Service of the Erle Of Kildare, who, for the moste Parte, did continuallie reside upon the Borders, as I cannot here, that there was the Vallue of one Cowe, by Force or Stelthe, taken out of the same. (TNA: PRO, SP 63/20/66)</blockquote>Sidney then turned a blind eye to Kildare's pursuit of traditional Geraldine interests and his resort to coign and livery, even as he tried to eradicate it in the Butler and Desmond lands. For his part Kildare had few qualms about abandoning Shane in order to retain Sidney's support. In the 1566 campaign against Shane &#145;the Earle himself [was] with desperate Followinge of A Horseman into a P[l]ace, shot throughe his Sloppe of his Hose with a Callyver, but not hurt&#146;  (Collins, 1.15&#150;17). After Shane's fall Kildare played a major role in the reorganization of Ulster in summer 1567. Elizabeth even suggested that Sidney appoint him commissioner there during the lord deputy's absence. His star in the ascendant, Kildare made renewed efforts to reclaim yet unrestored family lands when he went with Sidney to England. With the benefaction of Sidney and Leicester, Kildare's requests were satisfied and he was appointed to the lucrative post of admiral of Ireland.<br>
<br>Kildare's collaboration with Sidney continued after the lord deputy's return to Ireland. Mainly through Kildare's re-entrenched influence in the pale, Sidney's programme passed through the 1569 parliament. An act reversing the Kildare attainder and restoring his family in blood was Kildare's reward. It was testimony to Kildare's supreme confidence in his alliance with the lord deputy that he supported Sidney's parliamentary programme despite its proposed abolition of Gaelic practices such as fosterage and coign and livery, upon which Geraldine power had traditionally rested. Crucial to Kildare's acceptance of the programme was the absence of serious challengers from within his own family. During the Butler and Desmond revolts in 1569&#150;70 Kildare again proved the mainstay of the pale defences, rallying support for the lord deputy, preventing a Butler advance on the pale, and conducting a holding operation against Turlough Luineach O'Neill. When in 1571 he received a letter from Sir William Cecil, the principal secretary, commending the propriety of his behaviour, Kildare's rehabilitation appeared complete.<h2>
<a name="Problemswithrebellionandfinalyears15711585"></a>Problems with rebellion and final years, 1571&#150;1585</h2>Yet there was one serious weakness in Kildare's position, the vagaries of court faction. Under a sympathetic lord deputy a favoured dynast could reap rich reward; conversely, under an unsympathetic lord deputy the situation was reversible. When his old enemy Fitzwilliam became lord deputy in December 1571 Kildare was exposed to that harsh reality. Initially little changed: Kildare continued to play a crucial role in government; Fitzwilliam's brief to reduce expenditure prevented him from dispensing with the earl's service and in 1571 he commissioned Kildare to suppress Rory Oge O'More's rebellion. The campaign started well, but by 1573 Kildare could no longer contain the rebels. By late 1574 Fitzwilliam was in severe disfavour at court, blamed by Sidney and Leicester for the disorder in Ireland. As Fitzwilliam's deputyship started to disintegrate he sought to make Kildare the scapegoat, suggesting that the earl's failure to prevent the midland disturbances was a deliberate tactic to advance his claims to govern instead of the lord deputy. He labelled Kildare &#145;the procurer, and mayntainer of all the storme, disordr and rebellion of the Pale since [the beginning] of my goverment&#146;  (Bodl. Oxf., Carte MS 55, fol. 30<i>r</i>). Fitzwilliam secured Elizabeth's permission to apprehend Kildare. He was arrested before the Irish privy council on 8 May 1575 and transferred immediately to England. Sir Nicholas Malby reflected the shock in Ireland: &#145;my lord Kildare's apprehension is found strange by manie&#146;. Subsequently dozens of his followers were interrogated, with some sent to London for further examination.<br>
<br>The basic charge against Kildare was treason: of directing the Leinster rebels against the government. Though repeatedly interrogated in the Tower of London (June to December 1575), Kildare answered the charges brilliantly. He maintained throughout that all dealings with rebels had been only &#145;to satisfie her majestys commission and for her seruice and for the goode of the countrye and her subiects&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 63/52/13). By December it was clear Kildare had no case to answer and Cecil (now Baron Burghley) persuaded Elizabeth to pardon him. The countess of Kildare had licence on 13 February 1576 to return to Ireland to look after her husband's affairs. Nevertheless, Kildare was detained in England for three years and upon his return to Ireland he discovered the midland rebels had ravaged his lands: &#145;the Countye of Kildare is extremely impoverished, and in especiall the Earle of Kildares Lordshippes and Landes; which, in a great Parte, are wasted&#146;  (Collins, 1.81&#150;5). Worse still, his power and influence, so painstakingly constructed over twenty years, lay in tatters. Kildare now required a period of stability to regain the government's confidence and reassert his influence over his former pale dependants and the junior Fitzgerald lines that had asserted their independence during his absence. His detention in England was critical in the outbreak of the pale rebellion of 1579&#150;80 because he had lost influence over its gentry just as a serious breach with the increasingly intrusive New English party emerged.<br>
<br>Furthermore, Kildare failed to gauge accurately the changing religious and ideological atmosphere; and when the rebellion began, mindful of his recent imprisonment and his family's fate in the 1530s, he was paralysed. He neither joined the rebellion, for fear of defeat, nor could he participate effectively in its suppression because to do so would draw &#145;the hatred and ill wyll of my countrie, and pull upon [his] house and posteritie forever the blame&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 63/79/26, SP 63/79/26 (i), SP 63/79/26 (ii)). Nor did he appreciate that he could no longer depend on his allies at court because of the revolt's religious dimension. As his relatives, friends, and dependants joined the rebellion, Kildare's position was compromised, and it became untenable when Gerald fitz Maurice Fitzgerald, commander of his troops, defected to the rebels in August 1580. In December, on the advice of Kildare's enemies on the Irish privy council, who claimed that the earl was the centrepiece of an international Catholic conspiracy, Arthur Grey, fourteenth Baron Grey of Wilton, the lord deputy, arrested Kildare on suspicion of treason. He was imprisoned with his son-in-law <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20387/', "Christopher Nugent, fifth Baron Delvin (1544&#150;1602)")</script>, in Dublin Castle, before being sent to England in 1582 and incarcerated in the Tower again. Kildare's failure to support his faction ensured the failure of the pale rebellion, the decimation of the Geraldine bloc, and the New English triumph. Moreover, his failure adequately to support the government allowed his enemies to turn on him to great effect.<br>
<br>Kildare was cleared of treason in June 1583 and released from the Tower on giving a bond for &pound;2000 to remain within 20 miles of London but not to come within 3 miles of the court. The following year he was permitted to return to Ireland, and sat in parliament in April 1585. He died in London on 16 November 1585, and was buried at Kildare on 13 February 1586. The dowager countess of Kildare died on 25 August 1610 and was buried at Kildare. In 1577 Kildare was described as &#145;a perfect horseman and valiant of courage, small of stature, and slender of person, a very courteous gentleman, a right courtier. All that belonged to a gentleman was in him, saving he was hard and angry at times. He was a great gatherer of money, and would play [gamble] much&#146;  (<span class="italic">Calendar of Carew Manuscripts</span>, 5.216).<h2>
<a name="Achievement"></a>Achievement</h2>Kildare has a well-established historiographical reputation as an ineffectual leader compared with his father and grandfather. Professor Vincent Carey, who demonstrates that the earl faced very difficult problems, has recently convincingly dismissed this simplistic assessment. In the twenty years following the Geraldine collapse the political situation in Ireland changed irrevocably. The crown had no intention of delegating power to a native magnate, preferring to appoint English-born governors. In consequence, a new element was introduced to Irish society&#151;the New English. However, this process created a new colonial &eacute;lite whose position depended on the eclipse of the old colonial &eacute;lite. In the bipolar struggle that ensued, Kildare, after his return in 1556, assumed leadership of the Old English bloc fighting a rearguard action against aggressive New English expansion.<br>
<br>Neither could Kildare achieve his aims by threatening the lordship's stability, by openly unleashing the Geraldine faction in the manner of his predecessors, because he could not lay claim to the same authority. Accordingly, he modified his tactics, proving extremely flexible in adapting to the disorganized process of English expansion in Ireland. He owed his survival to adept playing of the game of faction, particularly at court, and during the 1550s and 1560s won some notable victories, destroying Sussex's administration and using Arnold as a puppet lord deputy.<br>
<br>Although Kildare contained the New English between 1555 and 1575, his successes, because the result of fluctuations in court faction, were in reality transitory. As the struggle between the Old English and the New English intensified in 1579&#150;83 the increasingly successful New English attempt to associate the Old English aristocracy with Gaelic degeneracy was to severely damage Kildare's position and destroy his cousin, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9556/', "Gerald fitz James Fitzgerald, fourteenth earl of Desmond (c.1533&#150;1583)")</script>. Their eclipse signalled the end of the era of regional magnates, and the triumph of the New English party. Of the three great earls of Ireland, only Ormond wielded any influence after 1583 and his survival depended on his familial link to Elizabeth, which insulated him from the attacks of his English opponents.<br>
