<span class="headword">Clark,  George Sidney Roberts  Kitson</span>  (1900&#150;1975), <span class="occ">historian</span>, was born in Leeds on 14 June 1900, the younger son and second of the three children of Edwin Kitson Clark (1866&#150;1943), of Leeds, lieutenant-colonel of the Territorial Army and mechanical engineer, the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/68867/', "Edwin Charles Clark")</script>, regius professor of civil law at Cambridge. His mother was Georgina, a painter, the daughter of George Parker Bidder QC, lawyer, and granddaughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2360/', "G. P. Bidder")</script>, engineer, who was exhibited in his youth as a &#145;calculating&#146; phenomenon. He was educated at Shrewsbury School. Brought up in a cultured and spacious home at Meanwoodside, Yorkshire, he was not happy at school, where he appeared awkward, untidy, and ineffective at games. He entered Trinity College, Cambridge, as an exhibitioner in 1919. There he found the environment in which he could blossom. With his genial and hospitable nature, he entered with zest into college activities. In part one of the historical tripos he obtained a lower second and in part two he was placed in the second division of the first class (1921). He became a research fellow of his college in 1922, college lecturer in 1928, university lecturer in 1929, college tutor in 1933, and in 1954 university reader in English constitutional history.<br>
<br>As a tutor, teaching and administration absorbed most of Kitson Clark's time and energy. He liked young people, both children and undergraduates, and won their affectionate respect. To the end he retained a certain boyishness himself. Burly, courageous, and outspoken, he became one of the notable characters of the university. As fellow of his college and member of the history faculty, he was both active and innovatory. Though generally conservative in his views, he had a flexible and imaginative mind. He played a prominent part in the enlargement of the tripos syllabus to include American and imperial history. In his last two decades he was an outstanding supervisor of research students and made Cambridge a centre for research in English nineteenth-century history. He helped to establish New Hall, the third women's college at Cambridge. He founded the university's education film council.<br>
<br>Kitson&#151;as he was generally known&#151;never married and, with the deterioration in his father's health and finances between the wars, he took on large and continuing responsibilities for the rest of the family. After the Second World War, when college and family pressures eased, his life widened. Underneath his bluff exterior there was a sensitive temperament, easily hurt and sometimes momentarily petulant. Though disappointed not to become vice-master of his college or Cambridge professor of modern history, he remained singularly free from professional envy. He had strong feelings, which he found difficult to suppress, and could offend unwittingly; he himself forgave easily. At heart he was a humble man. A devout Anglican, he revealed something of his deeper beliefs in two books, <span class="italic">The English Inheritance</span> (1950) and <span class="italic">The Kingdom of Free Men</span> (1957).<br>
<br>His first and longest book (but not his best, nor the one he most enjoyed writing) was <span class="italic">Peel and the Conservative Party: a Study in Party Politics, 1832&#150;41</span> (1929; 2nd edn, 1964); this was a development of his fellowship dissertation. Apart from <span class="italic">Peel</span> (1936), a brief life, he produced nothing more for twenty years and never again a major piece of research. As late as 1952 he was contemplating a companion volume on Peel and the corn laws and a study of mid-Victorian society which would fill the gap in &Eacute;lie Hal&eacute;vy's classic <span class="italic">Histoire du peuple anglais au XIX<sup>e</sup> si&egrave;cle</span>. All that came of the first were three memorable articles on the social background. In place of the second came the books which constitute his main historical achievement: <span class="italic">The Making of Victorian England</span> (1962), <span class="italic">An Expanding Society, Britain, 1830&#150;1900</span> (1967), and <span class="italic">Churchmen and the Condition of England, 1832&#150;1885</span> (1973). Significantly, all were based on series of lectures. He had found his medium and with it an attractive style, half-way between essay and conversation. The fruit of capacious reading and much reflection, his books were designed to redirect and illuminate, to stimulate rather than satisfy. A Kitson Clark school of historians would have been foreign to his mentality but generations of students at Cambridge and many contemporary historians were influenced by his outlook and grateful for his friendship, which they marked in an outstanding Festschrift, <span class="italic">Ideas and Institutions of Victorian Britain</span>, edited by Robert Robson (1967). In 1977, he published an erudite edition of G. M. Young's <span class="italic">Portrait of an Age</span>.<br>
<br>Kitson Clark was Ford's lecturer at Oxford (1959&#150;60), Maurice lecturer at King's College, London (1960), Birkbeck lecturer at Cambridge (1967), and visiting lecturer at the universities of Pennsylvania (1953&#150;4) and Melbourne (1964). Besides his Cambridge LittD, which he took in 1954, he received honorary degrees from Durham (1960), East Anglia (1970), Glasgow (1971), and Leeds (1973); and in 1975 he was elected foreign honorary member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. He died at Trinity College, Cambridge, on 8 December 1975.<br>
<br>Kitson Clark's sister, <a name="cosubject_97577"></a><span class="headword">(Anna) Mary Hawthorn  Kitson Clark</span>, <span class="st"> [<em>married name </em>Mary Chitty]</span>  (1905&#150;2005), <span class="occ">archaeologist</span>, was born in Leeds on 14 May 1905. She was educated at Leeds Girls' High School and Girton College, Cambridge, where she read history and stayed on for a year of archaeology. Returning to Yorkshire, in 1929 she became secretary of the Roman Antiquities Committee for Yorkshire, of which her father was treasurer, holding that post until 1943. In 1935 she published the acclaimed <span class="italic">Gazetteer of Roman Remains in East Yorkshire</span>, and from 1941 to 1943 she served as curator of Roman antiquities at the Yorkshire Museum, in York. On 5 July 1943 she married Derwas James Chitty (1901&#150;1971), Church of England clergyman and archaeologist, and the son of James Charles Martin Chitty, also a clergyman. They had met in 1929 in Palestine, where she had joined Dorothy Garrod excavating palaeolithic sites and he was excavating the monastery of St Euthymius. After their marriage they settled in Upton, Berkshire, where he was vicar, though she remained involved in the Yorkshire Philosophical Society (which ran the Yorkshire Museum) and the Roman Antiquities Committee for Yorkshire for a number of years. They had one daughter. After her husband's retirement in 1968 they moved to Llangwnnadl, on the Ll&#375;n Peninsula, Caernarvonshire, near Bardsey Island (Ynys Enlli). As Mary Chitty she published <span class="italic">The Monks of Ynys Enlli</span> in two volumes, covering the years 500&#150;1252 (1992) and 1252&#150;1537 (2000). In 1988 her earlier contributions to Roman archaeology in Yorkshire had been recognized in <span class="italic">Recent Research in Roman Yorkshire: Studies in Honour of Mary Kitson Clark</span>. She died at M&ocirc;r Awel, Llangwnnadl, on 1 February 2005 and was survived by her daughter.<br>
