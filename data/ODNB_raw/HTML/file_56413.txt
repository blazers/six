<span class="headword">Cross,  Edward</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1774, <em>d.</em> 1854), <span class="occ">zoo proprietor</span>, was born in London and baptized on 3 February 1774 at St Andrew's, Holborn, the son of Walter Cross and Jane (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Callow). Nothing is known of his life until he became proprietor of the Exeter 'Change Menagerie in the Strand, following the death of Stephen Polito in 1814. This menagerie had been in existence since about 1780 on the first floor of a complex of small shops. The animals were mostly big cats and birds, but there were also ungulates and reptiles. Cross established relations with painters such as Edwin Landseer and Jacques-Laurent Agasse, as well as scientific figures such as Joshua Brookes and J. E. Gray (who named <i>Rhinoceros crossii</i> after him). George IV patronized him both as a dealer and adviser on his own animals. He also befriended and encouraged the future superintendent of London Zoo, Abraham Dee Bartlett (1812&#150;1897), who was allowed to walk about the beast room and developed his skill in taxidermy by mounting birds which Cross gave him when they died. Even in the late Georgian period, the &#145;disgusting receptacles&#146; for animals at the Exeter 'Change had been the subject of criticism. This became particularly vocal after the bloody destruction of the bull Asiatic elephant Chunee in March 1826, which took more than an hour and some 180 musket shots by soldiers from Somerset House. Shortly after this Cross attempted to sell his collection and offer his services to the newly formed Zoological Society of London, an offer which was repeated in 1828, but which failed because the society required only certain specimens.<br>
<br>The Exeter 'Change was demolished to widen the Strand and Cross found temporary quarters in the King's Mews (on the site of the National Gallery). Then, in 1831, he held a public meeting at the Horns tavern in Kennington at which the Surrey Literary, Scientific and Zoological Institution was founded. Cross sold his animals to this body for &pound;3500 and became superintendent of the enterprise. The grounds of Walworth Manor House, Kennington, were laid out as a zoological garden and the patronage of Queen Adelaide and the archbishop of Canterbury was granted. In addition to a 3 acre lake, there was a circular glass house, 300 feet in diameter and with 6000 square feet of glass, housing the big cats. In 1832 these gardens were said to be both more suitable and more imposing than those at Regent's Park. The collection increased: an Indian rhinoceros in 1834, an orang-utan in 1835, and three giraffes in July 1836. Other attractions included firework displays, flower shows, Promenade Concerts, and balloon ascents. Cross retired in 1844 and died a widower at his home, 45 Newington Place, Kennington, on 26 September 1854, just over a year before the animal collection was auctioned. His wife's name was Mary but nothing more is known of her.<br>
