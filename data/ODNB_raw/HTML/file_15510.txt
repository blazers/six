<span class="headword">Kidd,  James</span>  (1761&#150;1834), <span class="occ">Church of Scotland minister</span>, born on 6 November 1761, was the youngest son of poor Presbyterian parents residing near Loughbrickland, co. Down. His father, William Kidd, died soon after his birth, and the family moved to Broughshane, co. Antrim. A friendly farmer sent James to a good classical school, and a Cameronian minister taught him Latin. Soon he was able to open a school of his own at Elginy, a neighbouring town. The school flourished and Kidd went to Belfast to study English. He next set up a school at Kildownie, 20 miles from Belfast. He stayed there for about four years, and married Jane (<i>d</i>. 4 June 1829), second daughter of Robert Boyd, farmer, of Carnlea, near Ballymena. They had two sons and three daughters. <br>
<br>Kidd and his wife emigrated to America in April 1784; he soon joined Little, a fellow countryman, in a school at Philadelphia, and next became usher to Pennsylvania College, where he also studied and worked as a proof-reader for the press. Working on Hebrew text encouraged him to learn the language; he bought a Hebrew <span class="roman">Bible</span> and, with the help of a Portuguese Jew and by dint of attending the Jewish synagogue in Philadelphia, acquired some fluency in the language. From that time oriental languages became his favourite study. He returned to Britain and settled at Edinburgh, where he became a student at the university, read chemistry and anatomy, and joined the theological classes of the university, supporting himself by offering extra-collegiate classes in oriental languages. In the autumn of 1793 he was appointed professor of oriental languages in Marischal College, Aberdeen. He there completed his theological courses and obtained formal licence as a preacher from the presbytery of Aberdeen on 3 February 1796; he was appointed evening lecturer in Trinity Chapel in the Shiprow. On 18 June 1801 Kidd became minister of the prestigious Gilcomston Chapel of Ease in the suburbs of Aberdeen, where he preached for more than twenty-five years to one of the largest congregations in Scotland. He was at pains to secure variety and freshness in his preaching, constantly looking out for new illustrations and keeping up his student habit of rising at three o'clock every morning. In October 1818 the College of New Jersey conferred on him the honorary degree of DD.<br>
<br>Kidd's powerful preaching and vigorous character overcame violent opposition, and ultimately gained for him an extraordinary popularity. His use of dialect to attract the poor was deplored by his brother ministers. It became an article of popular belief that no one who ever resisted &#145;the Doctor&#146; had prospered. Stories of his courage, benevolence, and eccentricity were numerous. On the accession of George IV he prayed in public that he &#145;might be a better king than he had been a prince regent&#146;, and when the local authorities complained, asked, &#145;And where's the man that can't improve?&#146; Kidd not only advocated vaccination from the pulpit, but employed a medical man to vaccinate his converts, and finally forced hundreds into his own house and vaccinated them himself. He is said to have given a stimulus to the study of Hebrew in the north of Scotland, but was not himself a very profound Hebraist. Kidd was a strenuous supporter of the Anti-Patronage Society, and eagerly advocated the popular election of ministers. He marshalled the forces that, after his death, supported the Disruption (1843) in Aberdeen. He was the author of many volumes of sermons and other works of theology, including <span class="italic">An Essay on the Doctrine of the Trinity</span> (1813), <span class="italic">A Dissertation on the Eternal Sonship of Christ</span> (1822, new edn by R. Candlish, 1872), and <span class="italic">Rights and Liberties of the Church Vindicated Against Patronages</span> (1834). He also wrote the second part of the preface to <span class="italic">Memoirs, Diary, and other Writings of Alexander Wood</span> (1818). Kidd died on 24 December 1834.<br>
