<span class="headword">Kilham <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Spurr]</span>,  Hannah</span>  (1774&#150;1832), <span class="occ">missionary and student of African languages</span>, born at Sheffield on 12 August 1774, was the seventh child of Peter and Hannah Spurr. Her father, a cutler by trade, was a strict Anglican, but her mother let her attend Wesley's services. After her parents' deaths she spent two years at a boarding-school in Chesterfield, where the schoolmaster felt she overstepped the bounds of the &#145;female province&#146; by her serious study of grammar. Back in Sheffield in 1790 she broke with the Church of England, and in 1794 she joined the Methodist society. When <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15525/', "Alexander Kilham (1762&#150;1798)")</script> founded the Methodist New Connexion in Sheffield she joined his congregation; they were married on 12 April 1798 and moved to Nottingham. He died after eight months, on 20 December 1798, and she opened a school to support herself and her stepdaughter, Sarah (later her biographer). Increasingly dissatisfied with the rigidity of Methodism, she joined the Society of Friends in 1803, returned to Sheffield, and opened a girls' boarding-school.<br>
<br>Deeply concerned about the plight of the poor in Sheffield, Hannah Kilham founded the Society for the Bettering of the Condition of the Poor and published religious tracts as teaching aids. She also grew interested in the anti-slavery cause, and became convinced that she should go to Africa as a &#145;school-missionary&#146;. After discussions with missionaries she decided on the experiment of teaching African children in their own languages, not in English, using images and ideas already familiar to them. She learned Wolof from two African sailors in London, published some lessons in Wolof and English, and persuaded the Society of Friends to found a mission in the Gambia. Meanwhile she visited Ireland to investigate and publicize the appalling condition of the rural poor.<br>
<br>The Gambia mission started in 1823 and Kilham opened a school, and taught in Wolof. But with the death of her colleagues in 1824 the mission ended. Meanwhile she had visited Sierra Leone where the large population of liberated Africans, or &#145;recaptives&#146; freed from the slave ships and speaking numerous languages, offered her far more scope to put her ideas into practice. After three years in London working among the poor in the parish of St Giles-in-the-Fields, she paid another brief visit to Sierra Leone in 1827 and collected specimens of thirty African languages. They included not only languages spoken in Sierra Leone, such as Temne, Susu, and Mende, but Fante (in what became Ghana) Hausa, Yoruba, Igbo, and Urhobo (in Nigeria), and Kongo, witness to the wide catchment area of the Atlantic slave trade. Kilham's <span class="italic">Specimens of African Languages Spoken in the Colony of Sierra Leone</span>, published on her return to England in 1828, anticipated Sigismund Koelle's great <span class="italic">Polyglotta Africana</span> (1854), which was to be based, as hers was, on language specimens collected in Sierra Leone. Kilham also published <span class="italic">African School Tracts</span>, illustrating her methods, beginning with words in the relevant African language, and then going on to sentences, <span class="roman">Bible</span> passages, stories, arithmetic, and grammar.<br>
<br>In 1830 Kilham returned to Sierra Leone to put theory into practice. She was given charge of a school for recaptive girls (some of them were brought, at her particular request, straight from the slave ship), in Charlotte village in the mountains above Freetown, where she taught in Mende and Yoruba. She opened a village bookshop and sold her textbooks, and considered drawing up simplified English vocabularies for children to learn English. But she was always restless: sometimes she would reflect in her journal on whether she should not really leave, to work for the Chinese. In 1832 she paid a brief visit to Liberia to see what progress the schools were making there. On the way back the ship was struck by lightning and put back to Liberia. Hannah Kilham suddenly fell unexpectedly ill, became unconscious, and died on 31 March 1832. Her body was committed to the sea, off the coast of Liberia.<br>
