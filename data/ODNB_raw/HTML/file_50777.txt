<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Powell, Dame  Muriel Betty</span>  (1914&#150;1978), <span class="occ">nurse</span>, was born on 30 October 1914 at Ruspidge, East Dean, Gloucestershire, the third child of Wallace George Powell (1878&#150;1969), a stonemason, and his wife, Annie Elizabeth Harriet Florence Jones, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Stewart (1889&#150;1959). She was one of seven children, the second of four daughters. At her first school she was remembered as a quiet, sensitive child who found pleasure in music and in literature. At East Dean grammar school in Cinderford she was determined to become a missionary and, in preparation for the Universities' Mission to Central Africa, she started Swahili lessons; her decision to become a nurse instead astonished her family. She embarked on her career by training as a probationer nurse at St George's Hospital, London (1934?&#150;1937). In 1947 she was to return, aged thirty-two, as its matron. She was qualified as a staff nurse then ward sister by 1939. Her pacifism prevented her joining the forces, but while a nurse tutor at Ipswich she worked on the land in the evenings and at weekends. In 1942 she took a diploma in nursing at London University. From a post at Manchester Royal Infirmary, where she was principal tutor, she returned in 1947 to St George's, where she remained for twenty-three years, for the last three as chief nursing officer. She was appointed CBE in 1962 and DBE in 1968.<br>
<br>Powell was a slight, good-looking, charismatic woman, who deeply believed in the value and dignity of each person. As Dame Muriel she became the most famous nurse in Britain since the First World War. To the general public she was the matron who enabled patients to remain, unawakened, in bed in hospital until seven o'clock in the morning. This simple concession for the sick in hospital, from her manual on nursing, caught the public imagination through the popular press. She became well known throughout the 1960s and 1970s to national radio audiences for her wise and sensible responses to enquiries from broadcasters and journalists about the various news items concerning sickness and the National Health Service. Her successor said &#145;she really made an impact on the public and not just on the nursing profession&#146; by changing the general practice of nursing  (Joan Clague, <span class="italic">Nursing Times</span>, 2039). A deeply committed Christian, she also regularly spoke in religious broadcasts; her contributions were always infused with dedication to caring and to her beliefs, yet she had a lightness of touch that enabled her to impart these to listeners with gentle humour. Her name and opinions became bywords to the public. During this time she wrote, with her co-author, the Revd Paul Gliddon, a former chaplain at St George's, <span class="italic">Called to Serve</span>, &#145;a book for all who care for the sick and who must face the problem of suffering&#146;.<br>
<br>Recognized by her professional colleagues as <i>primus inter pares</i>, Powell became the president of the Association of Hospital Matrons from 1958 to 1963, and deputy president of the Royal College of Nursing, which latter office may be considered as recognition by the &#145;other ranks&#146; organization. In 1963 and 1964 she also served on the Nurses and Midwives Whitley Council that determined the salaries and conditions of employment. For eleven years, from 1958 to 1969, she served on the Central Health Services Advisory Council as chairman of the standing nursing advisory committee of the Ministry of Health. She was also on the council of the King's Fund, the University of London's advisers panel on nursing. With a high national profile it was natural that she should move onto the international stage as a member of the World Health Assembly's expert advisory committee on nursing. She was also a director of the International Council of Nurses, and she travelled the world both officially and by invitation.<br>
<br>Nationally Powell was a member of the committee chaired by Sir Harry Platt that produced <span class="italic">A Reform of Nursing Education</span>, and of the committee under the chairmanship of Sir Brian Salmon on senior nursing staff structure. With her background in teaching she maintained that education was the key to better nursing. She introduced into St George's a shortened programme for university graduates, sponsored by the Ministry of Health. This enabled her hospital to form a partnership with the University of Surrey, combining an honours degree in biology with a nursing training.<br>
<br>By 1970 plans were advanced for the transfer of St George's from Hyde Park Corner to the suburb of Tooting. At fifty-five Powell could have sought retirement, but she elected to apply for the post of chief nursing officer for Scotland. She was appointed and moved north. Life as a senior civil servant was vastly different from her previous experience. She missed the contact with patients&#151;she had always carried out unaccompanied ward rounds&#151;but with her small team of nursing officers in Edinburgh she set about new tasks. Music continued to be her recreation.<br>
<br>Sadly, there is little doubt that, from the time of her acceptance of this last appointment, she was already experiencing the first symptoms of Alzheimer's disease in small ways that were detectable to her closest nursing colleagues. The decision seems to have been made in the Scottish Office that she should be supported until her retirement date, despite increasingly obvious signs of her waning powers.<br>
<br>When, in 1976, she finally retired to the family home in her beloved Gloucestershire, it became increasingly obvious that she needed both help and support in her daily living. These were gallantly provided by a former colleague, John Greene, who had succeeded her as president of the Association of Nurse Administrators (the former Association of Hospital Matrons). He was then the chief nursing officer of the nearby Coney Hill Hospital, where, lovingly cared for and cherished, she died on 8 December 1978. She was buried at Cinderford. The service of thanksgiving for her life, held at St Paul's, Knightsbridge, London, on 2 February 1979, attracted a huge congregation of citizens from all walks of life, as well as her numerous professional colleagues.<br>
