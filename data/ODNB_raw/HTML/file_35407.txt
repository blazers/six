<span class="headword">Paterson,  William Paterson</span>  (1860&#150;1939), <span class="occ">Church of Scotland minister and theologian</span>, was born at Skirling Mains, Peeblesshire, on 25 October 1860, the eldest son of John Paterson (<i>d</i>. 1889), farmer, and his wife, Mary (<i>d</i>. 1899), daughter of John Waugh, laird of St John's Kirk. After Skirling school and three years at the Royal High School, Edinburgh, in 1876 Paterson matriculated at Edinburgh University, where he graduated MA with honours in classics (1880) and BD (1883). Two years (1883&#150;5) of further study at the universities of Leipzig, Erlangen, and Berlin produced a lifelong interest in German culture.<br>
<br>After brief periods as assistant minister in Galashiels and at St Columba's Church of Scotland, London, Paterson was called in 1887 to the charge of St Michael's, Crieff. His seven years of ministry were punctuated by his marriage in 1888 to Jane Sanderson (<i>d</i>. 1928) and the birth of three of their eight children. In 1894 he was appointed by examination to the chair of systematic theology at Aberdeen University. Quickly establishing a reputation as a lecturer of clarity and preacher of eloquence, Paterson was awarded the degree of DD by his alma mater and subsequently appointed in 1903 to succeed his teacher Robert Flint as professor of divinity at Edinburgh University. He held the chair until his retirement in 1934 and served as dean of the faculty of divinity from 1912 to 1928. He was appointed a domestic chaplain to the king in 1916 and was awarded an LLD degree by Glasgow University in 1926.<br>
<br>Paterson's published work was marked by lucidity of exposition, wide-ranging scholarship in several languages, and an ability to harness philosophical argument to the defence of a broadly orthodox doctrinal stance. The alliance of liberal learning and evangelical piety in his thought was characteristic of Scottish theology in the late Victorian and Edwardian period. His two most notable works were <span class="italic">The Rule of Faith</span> (1912), which was the fruit of the Baird lectures (1905&#150;6) after seven years of meticulous revision, and <span class="italic">The Nature of Religion</span> (1925), his Glasgow Gifford lectures of that year. <span class="italic">The Rule of Faith</span> is a careful examination of method and content in the leading doctrinal systems from the ancient church to the late nineteenth century. Although Paterson's own sympathies can be detected as ecumenical and reformed, he proves himself a patient and generally reliable expositor of different outlooks. <span class="italic">The Nature of Religion</span> is a bold attempt to argue from the empirical history of religions to a conception of the truthfulness and practical efficacy of theism, particularly its Christian variant. It is an outstanding example of the apologetic argument employed by successive Gifford lecturers in the early period of the twentieth century, and reveals the keen interest in the phenomena of world religion that had already been developed in Edinburgh in the time of Flint.<br>
<br>Paterson came to prominence as one of the leading church figures of the day through his popular preaching and involvement in ecclesiastical affairs. Widely respected within the United Free Church, he was one of the leading architects of its eventual union in 1929 with the established Church of Scotland, of which he was a minister. He was one of the drafters of new articles declaratory of the united Church of Scotland, and an influential supporter of the drive towards Presbyterian reunion.<br>
<br>At the outbreak of war in 1914, Paterson's life and career entered their most critical phase. Insight into this period is provided by the recent publication of diaries he kept from 1912 to 1928. A strong supporter of the war effort, Paterson argued that Britain and her allies had been subject to German aggression which required resistance by force. The struggle was typically cast in religious terms, by which the resurgent paganism within German culture faced the truer Christian spirit of the British empire. Paterson's expert advocacy of the allied cause was reflected in a series of sermons preached during a vacation in Newtonmore in the late summer of 1914, which were published as <span class="italic">In the Day of the Muster</span>. The ensuing carnage, however, brought the deaths of two of his own sons. On receiving news of the second loss he wrote in his diary:<blockquote>The last sermon he heard me preach was on providence: &#145;the hairs of your head are all numbered&#146;. He thought I was rather too confident about the ways of providence. At the time he fell, I was conducting the evening service in St George's. We were singing &#145;Rock of Ages&#146; about that time. I preached on, &#145;By grace ye are saved through faith&#146;, and in the morning I had preached on &#145;God is love&#146;. It has been a terrible wrench to lose my darling boy. But at least he has been in the world twenty-one years, and it did not corrupt or injure him. And, as it was said in the prayer my father read to us many a time, &#145;The Lord gave and the Lord hath a sovereign right to take away&#146;. (<span class="italic">Diaries</span>, 164&#150;5)</blockquote>Paterson continued his active involvement in church and social affairs throughout the war, his own personal tragedy doubtless enabling him to share in that of many others. Further wartime sermons were published as <span class="italic">In the Day of the Ordeal</span> (1917). Following the end of the war he was elected moderator of the general assembly in 1919. He continued to argue that the hand of providence overruled human history, which thus progressed towards the kingdom of God. In his moderatorial address he urged the League of Nations to reintegrate Germany within the international community. His later years were devoted to continuing, on a lower and more sombre key, his writing and academic commitments.<br>
<br>The task of unveiling war memorials around the country and the journey Paterson made to the scene of his sons' deaths were adjudged to have taken their toll. His wife died in 1928, and, though he did not retire until 1934, the theological culture of the post-war period was now rendering his work&#151;generally liberal, optimistic, and orthodox&#151;somewhat problematic. He died, as Europe was preparing for a further outbreak of war, on 10 January 1939 at Edinburgh, where he lived, and was buried at Skirling. Widely regarded for his charm, gravitas, and occasional eccentricities, Paterson was a tall and striking figure of imposing appearance. His earlier years were marked by sporting prowess, and something of his physical presence can be discerned in the portrait hung in the Rainy Hall, New College, Edinburgh. He was survived by six of his children, and his youngest son, Arthur, established a reputation in psychiatry as the founder of electroconvulsive therapy.<br>
