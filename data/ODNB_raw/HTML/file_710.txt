<span class="headword">Arthur,  Thomas</span> <span class="st"> [Thomas Arthur FitzWilliam]</span>  (1593&#150;1675), <span class="occ">physician</span>, son of William Arthur, was born on 24 November 1593 of a Roman Catholic family in Limerick. His father's name being William, he often styled himself Thomas Arthur FitzWilliam. He was educated at Bordeaux, where he obtained his master's degree, at Paris, where he studied medicine, and at Rheims, where he was awarded a doctorate. In May 1619 he returned to Ireland and began a successful practice in Limerick. From November of that year he made trips to Dublin, treating a number of people there. From April 1624 he spent most of his time in Dublin rather than in Limerick, although he had started building a house in Limerick in 1620. In August 1630 he moved with his wife and children to the capital, where he remained, except for a period between 1641 and 1652, when he sought safety from the war in Limerick.<br>
<br>Arthur kept a personal and professional record book (BL, Add. MS 31885), which contains a complete list of his patients and fees from 1619 to 1666, when he retired. Among the various cases which he treated the most important one, or at least the one in which he took most pride, was that of Archbishop James Ussher (1581&#150;1656), whose complaint had baffled English physicians. Arthur effected a cure in 1626, and received a lavish fee of &pound;51. His success brought him the patronage of the viceroy, Viscount Falkland.<br>
<br>Arthur's entry-book also contains an exact record of his gradual accumulation of property, from which he earned more than from his practice. It also contains a number of pieces of Latin verse and some autobiographical and genealogical information. He also left a manuscript catalogue of his books.<br>
<br>Arthur died in January 1675, leaving two daughters; another daughter had predeceased him in 1651. In his will, he left all his property to his grandson William.<br>
