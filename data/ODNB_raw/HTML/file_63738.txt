<span class="headword">Smyth, Sir  John George</span>, first baronet  (1893&#150;1983), <span class="occ">army officer and politician</span>, was born at Teignmouth, Devon, on 24 October 1893, the eldest of the three sons of William John Smyth (<i>b</i>. 1869) of the Indian Civil Service. His mother, Lilian May Clifford (1869/70&#150;1956), was the daughter of a naval captain. At the Dragon School, Oxford, which he attended from 1901 to 1908, &#145;I had&#146;, he recorded in the second version of his autobiography, <span class="italic">Milestones, a Memoir</span> (1979), &#145;shown signs of becoming an outstanding athlete, with quite a good brain&#146;  (Smyth, <span class="italic">Milestones</span>, 20) until for two years he was bedridden with a serious illness. &#145;These two years were, from a character-forming point of view, the most important in my life&#146;, he considered. &#145;I read voraciously and &hellip; was not afraid of death &hellip; Physical fitness became a <i>sine qua non</i> all the days of my life&#146;  (ibid., 22).<br>
<br>At Repton, from 1908 to 1911, determined to get into Sandhurst, &#145;I was&#146;, Smyth acknowledged in his original autobiography, <span class="italic">The Only Enemy</span> (1959), &#145;that most unpopular of all species &hellip; a swot&#146;  (Smyth, <span class="italic">The Only Enemy</span>, 37), but he passed, eighteenth out of 250, into Sandhurst in 1911 and left the Royal Military College a year later, ninth among those passing out and a prize winner. He was commissioned into the Indian army and joined the 15th Sikhs, &#145;thin as a rail, perhaps rather too serious, but enormously keen&#146;  (ibid., 45&#150;6).<br>
<br>When war broke out in 1914, widespread doubt existed about the ability of Indian troops to stand up to modern weapons and trench warfare, but Smyth's regiment rapidly confounded the sceptics. On 18 May 1915, at &#145;that little cockpit of the Western Front near Richebourg L'Avoue, which the troops afterwards called &#147;the Glory Hole&#148; &hellip; littered with the unburied dead of many battalions, stinking to high heaven&#146;  (Smyth, <span class="italic">Milestones</span>, 48), the crucial event occurred of Smyth's life. He was ordered to carry a supply of desperately needed bombs to a small party holding out in a captured section of the enemy front line. Two attempts to cross the intervening 250 yards of fire-swept no man's land had already failed disastrously and Smyth was &#145;in an absolutely blue funk&#146;  (ibid., 49) when instructed to make a third, but &#145;when I asked for ten volunteers to go with me &hellip; the whole company stepped forward&#146;. All ten of those chosen, &#145;crawling forward, taking what cover we could from the British corpses &hellip;&#146; were killed or wounded but Smyth survived, though &#145;I had bullets through my tunic and cap and my walking-stick had been hit &hellip; four times&#146;  (Smyth, <span class="italic">The Only Enemy</span>, 78). He succeeded in his mission none the less and that July he was awarded the Victoria Cross, making him nationally known. His men asserted that &#145;Smyth Sahib bears a charmed life&#146;  (ibid., 82) but he probably owed his survival to his being sent later in 1915 to serve in Egypt (having added the Russian order of St George to his honours) and, in 1916, back to India.<br>
<br>Smyth's &#145;peacetime&#146; service from 1918 was a misnomer, for it included the Third Anglo-Afghan War (1919&#150;20), in which he won the Military Cross, putting down an insurrection in Mesopotamia, and operations on the permanently restive north-west frontier of India. In all three campaigns he was mentioned in dispatches. From 1931 to 1934 he was an instructor at the Staff College, Camberley, and from 1934 to 1939, following accelerated promotion, he held various staff and command appointments in India.<br>
<br>The start of the Second World War found Smyth on leave in England, where he was appointed general staff officer, grade 1, of the 2nd London division, and then, in February 1940, commander of the 127th infantry brigade. This was also an eventful period in his private life. His marriage, on 22 July 1920, to Margaret Dundas, &#145;a very beautiful woman with a saint-like character&#146; who &#145;gave me four wonderful children&#146; (one of his three sons was to be killed in action in Burma in 1944) ended in 1940 in a divorce that &#145;was certainly not her fault&#146;  (Smyth, <span class="italic">Milestones</span>, 75). On 12 April 1940 he married Frances Mary Blair Read Chambers, the start of a &#145;really happy&#146; partnership  (ibid., 290), which endured until his death.<br>
<br>Two weeks later, on 23 April 1940, Smyth left for France in command of 127th infantry brigade. By 1 June he was back in England, via the Dunkirk evacuations, and, after anti-invasion duties in East Anglia, he returned, during 1941, to India, being promoted acting major-general, at first in command of the 19th division. When, in December, the Japanese invaded Burma, he assumed command of the 27th division, during its withdrawal from Moulmein to Rangoon. On 23 February 1942 he approved the blowing-up of a vital bridge over the wide and fast-flowing Sittang River, which left two-thirds of his men on the far side, at the mercy of the advancing Japanese. Smyth always insisted that &#145;no educated soldier could have made any other&#146; decision  (Smyth, <span class="italic">Milestones</span>, 189), but he was blamed for what Churchill called &#145;a major disaster&#146;  (Churchill, 4.136). That November he was compulsorily retired from the army, on a colonel's pension, with, added later, the honorary rank of brigadier.<br>
<br>Smyth became in 1943 military correspondent to the <span class="italic">Sunday Times</span> and other newspapers, and subsequently its tennis correspondent. He proved a prolific and versatile writer. Following his first book, <span class="italic">Defence is our Business</span> (1945), he produced more than thirty titles, mainly on military subjects, but also on tennis and cats (a lifelong love of his), as well as biographies, children's stories, a play, and <span class="italic">The Story of the Victoria Cross</span> (1962). He also became chairman of the Victoria Cross and George Cross Association.<br>
<br>In 1945 Smyth began a third career, as a politician, standing as Conservative candidate for Central Wandsworth against the formidable Ernest Bevin. He was beaten by 5174 votes, but in 1950 he stood again, at Norwood, and was elected by a majority of 2075; he remained an MP until 1966. From November 1951 he served as parliamentary secretary of the Ministry of Pensions, and he became joint parliamentary secretary when it was merged with the Ministry of National Insurance in 1953. He had little taste, however, for the ministerial battlefields of Whitehall and Westminster and in December 1955 returned to the back benches at his own request. On 23 January 1956 he was created a baronet and in 1962 he was sworn of the privy council.<br>
<br>Late in life Smyth professed himself &#145;a happy man&#146; and &#145;an incurable optimist&#146;  (Smyth, <span class="italic">Milestones</span>, 291). He died on 26 April 1983, at his home, 807 Nelson House, Dolphin Square, London, and was succeeded in his baronetcy by his grandson. He bequeathed his medals to the Imperial War Museum, but the VC was a replica. The original had been stolen and, to its owner's disgust, the War Office had charged him &pound;1 11<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>. to replace it.<br>
