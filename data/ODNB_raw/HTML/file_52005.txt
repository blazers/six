<span class="headword">Hore,  Richard</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1535&#150;1538), <span class="occ">mariner</span>, was a citizen and leather-seller of London. Late in 1535 he attempted to generate interest in a voyage to the &#145;northwest parts of America&#146;. Several gentlemen of the inns of court and chancery responded to his approach; their motive&#151;being &#145;desirous to see the strange things of the world&#146;  (Hakluyt, 8.3)&#151;has since inclined commentators to regard them as proto-tourists. Hore hired two vessels, the <i>Trinity</i> and the <i>William</i>. With a complement of 160, including 30 gentlemen, he departed from England at the end of April 1536. Almost two months elapsed before the ships sighted land, near Cape Breton. Moving north-eastwards without making formal observations of the coastline, they anchored for several days off Newfoundland. There they sighted, and disembarked to chase, a party of Indians, but were unable to make contact. From this point their stores failed them, and extreme solutions&#151;as were later reported&#151;became necessary. Several acts of murder and cannibalism apparently took place among the crew. As their number decreased, &#145;the officers knew not what was become of them&#146;, until one man, challenging another for a piece of meat, asked its provenance. &#145;If thou wouldst needs know&#146;, he was told, &#145;the broyled meate that I had was a piece of such a mans buttocke&#146;  (ibid., 8.5, 6). Despite Hore's exhortations to curb such unpleasantness, his mariners had reached the stage of holding a lottery to decide whom among their number should provide the next meal, when a French ship entered their harbour and was seized by the famished Englishmen. With this prize they returned to England, reaching St Ives in October 1536.<br>
<br>The only account of the voyage is that provided by Hakluyt, and its accuracy is highly suspect. Much of what he reported was third-hand, via his cousin, the lawyer Richard Hakluyt, from conversations with one of the gentlemen voyagers. The only original source was a surviving member of the <i>Trinity</i>'s crew, whom Hakluyt interviewed almost half a century after the voyage took place. Such evidence as exists contradicts both men's statements. Following his return Hore failed to honour his contract with the <i>William</i>'s owner, William Dolphyn, and the ship's cargo was seized. Examined in the court of admiralty, Hore claimed that he had intended a fishing voyage; and he was certainly carrying fish when he returned to England, so acts of cannibalism hardly seem to have been necessary. It may rather be the case that the voyage's unaccustomed hardships may have inclined the &#145;tourists&#146; to overstate their ordeal somewhat.<br>
<br>In the following year Hore was before the admiralty court once more, having hired another vessel, the <i>Valentine</i>, voyaged to Portugal, and undertaken to transport several Portuguese travellers to England. In fact he kidnapped them, brought them to a haven near Cardiff, and demanded money for their release. He seems successfully to have argued himself free from custody. In September 1538 the <i>Valentine</i> was arrested upon the action of her owner, to whom Hore owed &pound;280. Predictably her cargo of salt and wine was suspected to have been obtained dishonestly. The over-enterprising Hore thereafter disappears from extant records.<br>
