<span class="headword">Isaacs,  Nathaniel</span>  (1808&#150;1872), <span class="occ">trader and author</span>, was born in Canterbury. His father, a merchant and inhabitant of Chatham, was married to Lenie Solomon, one of the many children of Nathaniel Solomon of Margate and Phoebe Mitz, a Dutch Jew; Saul Solomon, the merchant king of St Helena, was his uncle. Isaacs's father died during his early childhood and in 1822 the boy was sent to join his uncle Saul Solomon at St Helena. In 1825 he sailed for the British Cape Colony in the vessel <i>Mary</i>, commanded by Lieutenant James King, who aimed to join Lieutenant F. G. Farewell at Port Natal in order to participate in the ivory trade from that region. In October 1825 the <i>Mary</i> was wrecked on the sand bar at Port Natal and the crew left stranded. Isaacs was in contact with other members of Farewell's trading party, including Henry Fynn, Henry Ogle, and Thomas Halstead. James King's apprentice Charles Rawden Maclean (&#145;John Ross&#146;) was also known to Isaacs.<br>
<br>In the absence of reliable evidence it is difficult to establish an accurate historical context for the white traders at Port Natal during the 1820s. Isaacs's early biographers noted his &#145;pioneering&#146; qualities and his presence as a white explorer in the Shakan Zulu state. However, more recent researchers have moved away from this kind of depiction and have noted various kinds of interaction between the trading group and indigenous communities, based on trade in ivory. The South African historian Julian Cobbing has suggested that the Europeans were involved in the east African coastal slave trade, though this is still a debatable topic. While Isaacs and King were rivals with Farewell and Fynn for control of ivory supplies, this group later changed and after the death of King in 1828 Isaacs became Fynn's trading partner. By 1830 these traders had set out a business prospectus for their future economic activities at Port Natal. Isaacs did not, however, remain in the region; he left Natal for the Cape in 1831 aboard the American brig the <i>St Michael</i>.<br>
<br>Although he returned to England in 1832, Isaacs continued to show an economic and political interest in Natal and he wrote to the Cape governor, Sir Lowry Cole, asking for a land grant at Port Natal. This request was turned down and Isaacs then turned his attention to the idea of persuading the British government to annex Natal formally. He wrote to Fynn, suggesting that the latter publish his writing in which he could stress the savage nature of the Zulu in order to secure formal British intervention in defence of the white traders at Port Natal. In 1834 Isaacs and other Cape traders composed a &#145;merchants' memorial&#146; which was sent to Governor D'Urban and then to London. This petition, which requested British annexation, was rejected by the Colonial Office on the grounds of expense.<br>
<br>Having failed to achieve annexation through these methods, Isaacs published in 1836 the book for which he is best known, <span class="italic">Travels and Adventures in Eastern Africa</span>. Despite encouragement from Isaacs, Fynn's reminiscences were only printed in Bird's <span class="italic">Annals of Natal</span> in 1888 and the <span class="italic">Diary of Henry Francis Fynn</span> was not published until 1950. Isaacs's publication thus became the earliest European writing on Shaka and the Zulu in the Natal region. Dan Wylie has suggested that Isaacs's writing, like other narratives on Shaka, was more in the nature of a character assassination than an objective account. His negative depiction of Shaka was clearly motivated by his desire to secure Natal as a political and economic sphere of British imperial expansion.<br>
<br>After his return to England in 1832 Isaacs formed a partnership with C. G. Redman in London for the purposes of commerce in the Senegal coastal region, and in 1835 petitioned the British government against French competition in the area. He also maintained his interest in Natal, and wrote to Fynn in 1840 stating that he planned to leave west Africa and return to southern Africa to control his commercial interests in the Natal coastal region. However, following the official British annexation of Natal in 1843, Isaacs was again refused a land grant in the colony and from this date he seems to have abandoned any further attempts to establish himself in South Africa.<br>
<br>During the early 1840s Isaacs established his trading headquarters in Old Calabar and bought property in Freetown in Sierra Leone. In 1844 he sold his Freetown properties and bought the island of Matacong, north of the Melakori River, as a trading post. The island was within the jurisdiction of the colony but remained outside customs. Isaacs took advantage of this fact and set up depots to ship goods to the mainland. He also acted as consular agent for the French government. From the 1850s he moved away from the European settlement where he cultivated arrowroot for export to England. He was suspected of being involved in the slave trade and in 1854 Governor Kennedy of Sierra Leone tried to have him arrested but he escaped to England. The evidence against Isaacs was later lost at sea while Kennedy was <i>en route</i> for Australia. In 1856 the British authorities dropped the prosecution against Isaacs. Isaacs lived in London from 1854 to 1858 but left England again in 1860 when he visited Matacong. He was in Freetown in 1863. He retired to Liverpool in 1868, and in 1870 he moved to 8 Church Street, Egremont, Cheshire, where he died in a coma on 26 June 1872.<br>
