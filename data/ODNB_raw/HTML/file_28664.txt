<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Wanley,  Humfrey</span>  (1672&#150;1726), <span class="occ">Old English scholar and librarian</span>, was born on 21 March 1672 at the Vicarage House adjoining Jesus Hall, Coventry, the youngest of five children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28665/', "Nathaniel Wanley (1632/3&#150;1680)")</script>, vicar of Holy Trinity, Coventry (1662), and his wife, Ellen Burton (1632&#150;1719), daughter of Humfrey Burton, clerk to Coventry council (1636&#150;85). He was educated at Coventry Free School and, on leaving school, was bound apprentice to a Coventry linen draper. The life of a provincial draper did not suit Wanley and did not detain him long. At least as early as June 1691 he was transcribing local Warwick records; later the same year he made for himself a copy of the Old English grammar from G. Hickes's <span class="italic">Institutiones grammaticae Anglo-Saxonicae</span> (1689) and of the catalogue of Anglo-Saxon manuscripts in the Bodleian Library from the same work.<br>
<br>By October 1694, a draper no more, Wanley was employed seeking out collections of manuscripts for inclusion in the <span class="italic">Catalogi librorum manuscriptorum Angliae et Hiberniae</span>, commonly known as <span class="roman">Bernard's Catalogue</span>, then being compiled at Oxford. <span class="roman">Bernard's Catalogue</span> was published in 1697 and Wanley was author of four catalogues in it. But by then he had long been established at Oxford. The traditional account, which there seems no reason to disbelieve, is that Wanley moved to Oxford in 1695 under the patronage of William Lloyd, bishop of Coventry and Lichfield since 1692. His official subscription and oath taken on his admission to the university is dated 7 May 1695. He was briefly in residence at St Edmund Hall before moving to University College at the invitation of the master, Arthur Charlett.<br>
<br>Wanley arrived at Oxford with the interests that were the foundation of his later achievements already fixed. Oxford was to transform a young man's appetite for copying old manuscripts and for northern languages into the mature scholar's mastery of palaeography and of Old English, and the letters of these years present a striking picture of Wanley's rapidly developing and formidable talents&#151;the growth of his knowledge, the refining of his skills, and the maturing of his judgement. The evidence for Old English is to be found in Wanley's great catalogue of Anglo-Saxon manuscripts, <span class="italic">Librorum veterum septentrionalium, qui in Angliae bibliothecis extant &hellip; catalogus historico-criticus</span>, largely completed in Oxford between 1695 and 1701 but not published until 1705&#151;as volume 2 of George Hickes's <span class="italic">Linguarum veterum septentrionalium thesaurus</span>. It is in his letters of the 1690s to Hickes, Thomas Smith, and others that the discipline of palaeography can be seen being formulated for English scholarship and from English materials.<br>
<br>Wanley's appointment as assistant at the Bodleian Library in November 1695, six months after his arrival in Oxford, gave him the freedom of the greatest treasure house of manuscripts in public or private hands in England. As his experience was enriched by daily contact with the Bodleian collections, he was defining for himself the whole range of questions that exercise palaeographers, and turning his powerful mind and methodical genius to their explanation and, as often as not, their solution. Hickes was his only competitor, and Hickes, as he himself confessed, was Wanley's pupil: &#145;I have learnt more from you&#146;, he wrote in 1698, &#145;than ever I did from any other man&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters</span>, xv, n. 8). At the time of writing Hickes was fifty-five, Wanley twenty-five&#151;and not four years out of the draper's shop.<br>
<br>Throughout the Oxford years Wanley was full of plans for great enterprises. As early as 1695 he urged the collecting of all fragments of scripture remaining in Old English. In 1698 he proposed to undertake what is in effect a comprehensive work on English diplomatic. Probably in 1698 he submitted to the curators of the Bodleian a request to be allowed to remove all manuscript leaves used as pastedowns in printed books in the library, so that they could be arranged to illustrate the development of handwriting. In the summer of 1700 he put forward the grandest scheme of all, proposing to visit the libraries of France, Germany, and Italy to examine manuscripts, collate important texts, take specimens of handwriting, and search for works bearing on English history. These are ambitiously conceived schemes and they are a young man's schemes; most were never begun, none was completed. There is no doubt Wanley would have been wiser to attempt something more manageable. But for Wanley modest ambitions held only moderate attractions.<br>
<br>It is important to remember how far ahead of their time were Wanley's proposals. Anglo-Saxon biblical pieces were first collected by A. S. Cooke in 1898. The comprehensive study of early English charters had to wait for Kemble and Earle in the nineteenth century and Sawyer and others in the twentieth. Bodleian pastedowns remained unlisted until N. R. Ker's <span class="italic">Pastedowns in Oxford Bindings</span> (1954). Of schemes subsequently put forward by Wanley during his early years in Harley's service, the publication of the acts of the privy council was undertaken by Sir Nicholas Harris Nicholas (1834&#150;7), while the plan to publish the original sources of English history, taken up by Thomas Hearne, is really the forerunner of that monumental Victorian enterprise, the <span class="roman">Rolls Series</span>. The only major work Wanley carried to completion, his catalogue of Anglo-Saxon manuscripts, held the field until N. R. Ker published his <span class="italic">Catalogue of Manuscripts Containing Anglo-Saxon</span> in 1957.<br>
<br>In December 1700, amid much rancour and bitterness, Wanley left Oxford for good and moved to London. The precise occasion of his departure is not known. Institutional indifference, social prejudice, and the ill will of those less talented than himself&#151;Hearne, alluding to the favour shown Wanley by Arthur Charlett, called him &#145;the Master's pimp&#146;  (<span class="italic">Remarks</span>, 1.212)&#151;all played their part in persuading Wanley that his advancement at Oxford was blocked and that he would do well to seek a future elsewhere.<br>
<br>There followed years of drudgery for Wanley in London, as assistant secretary (later secretary) of the recently founded SPCK, where in the course of duty he published J. F. Ostervald's <span class="italic">The Grounds and Principles of the Christian Religion</span> (1704), in an English translation from the French, and as assistant to Hans Sloane, secretary of the Royal Society. Wanley was elected FRS in 1706. They are also years of ill health and unhappiness, and of desperate attempts to find a post more congenial to his interests and his talents than the SPCK or the Royal Society afforded, and a post sufficiently well paid to enable him to support a wife and family. On 1 May 1705 he married his landlady, Ann Berenclow (<i>d</i>. 1722), daughter of Thomas Bourchier of Newcastle upon Tyne, and widow of Bernard Martin Berenclow, whose family Wanley had lodged with at 3 Duke Street, York Buildings, Westminster, since 1704. Already the mother of several children by Berenclow, she and Wanley had three children, none of whom survived infancy.<br>
<br>The settled station in life that Wanley so earnestly sought was long delayed. His formal introduction to Robert Harley, then speaker of the House of Commons, which was the encounter that decided the course of Wanley's subsequent career, took place in April 1701. Already in the preface to his catalogue of Anglo-Saxon manuscripts, signed off in August 1704, he extols Harley as his Maecenas. Harley employed him regularly, though not consistently, until Wanley's resignation from the secretaryship of the SPCK in June 1708. Thereafter his future lay in the service of the Harleys, as library-keeper to Robert Harley and to his son Edward Harley.<br>
<br>From 1708 the tale of Wanley's life is largely the story of the Harleian Library and of his official relationship with his employers, chiefly from 1711 with Edward Harley. That story is, in a single word, the story of accumulation. The Harleys, especially Edward, bought books and manuscripts on a scale that challenges understanding, and Wanley's diary is the stolid record of Wanley's brilliance as the agent of an appetite that, after Wanley's death, brought Edward Harley to despair and to financial ruin. Wanley's diary, buttressed by the catalogue of the Harleys' manuscript collections, completed by Wanley as far as the middle of Harley MS 2408 at the time of his death, and by the evidence of the sale catalogue of the Harley printed books sold off after Edward Harley's death in 1741, allows those who assert Wanley's pre-eminence as a librarian to rest their case.<br>
<br>There is no doubt that Wanley's career can be seen as a happy variation of Stubbs's principle that if you put the worst man in the best place you have all the good ones striving to show how much better they are, and so benefiting the world. He had hopes, more or less well founded, of becoming, at different times, Bodley's librarian, a fellow of Worcester College, Oxford, keeper of the Cotton Library, commissioner of Hackney coaches, and historiographer royal. He also had thoughts, not nearly so well founded&#151;though he prosecuted his candidacy no less vigorously for that&#151;of becoming library-keeper to the lord chancellor, and of succeeding Richard Bentley as keeper of the royal libraries, William Petyt as keeper of the records in the Tower, and John Chamberlayne in his post at the state paper office. In all these he failed, and he was obliged to squander his energies on developing the talents that made him the greatest Anglo-Saxonist of his generation, and one of the greatest palaeographers and librarians of his age.<br>
<br>Wanley's years in the service of the Harleys were satisfying and secure; in his later years he seems to have achieved a moderate prosperity, owning in 1719 a parcel of land valued at &pound;400 and a second parcel at Leicester. He had from the first the confidence of Edward Harley and the freedom of his houses in Westminster and at Wimpole, near Cambridge. He had the respect of scholars and, through Harley, the amused affection of poets. Alexander Pope consulted him about the purchase of port wine. John Gay assigned him a stanza, beginning<blockquote>
<div>O Wanley, whence com'st thou with shortned hair<br>
</div>
<div>And visage from thy Shelves with dust besprent?<br>
</div>
</blockquote>in his poem &#145;Mr Popes Welcome from Greece&#146;  (<span class="italic">Poetry and Prose</span>, 1.259). Matthew Prior, tongue in cheek, places him in the exalted company of Socrates and Cicero in his <span class="italic">Alma, or, The Progress of the Mind</span>  (<span class="italic">Literary Works</span>, 1.516). There are four portraits of him from these years, three by Thomas Hill, and the fourth showing a countenance, says Dibdin, &#145;absolutely peppered with variolous indentations&#146;  (Dibdin, 346), evidence of the smallpox that afflicted him in childhood.<br>
<br>The Harley years were, Wanley's indefatigable prosecution of library business apart, unremarkable. In 1717 he was active in the refounding of the Society of Antiquaries, which he had originally helped found in 1707. His wife, Ann, died on 3 January 1722 and was buried at St Paul's, Covent Garden, on 5 January. In 1726 he married again (his second wife was also called Ann) shortly before his death of dropsy at Clarges Street, Hanover Square, Piccadilly, London, on 6 July 1726. He was buried at St Marylebone Church. He died intestate; letters of administration granted to his widow are dated 3 November 1726.<br>
