<span class="headword">Richards,  George</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1694), <span class="occ">merchant</span>, was a younger son of Captain Edward Richards (<i>c</i>.1617&#150;1664) of Southampton. Of a very respectable gentle pedigree, in March 1653 his father chose to put him out as an apprentice, at the cost of &pound;80, to Matthew Atkins, a member of the Weavers' Company. Thereafter he passed under the guidance of Philip Forter of the Barber&#150;Surgeons' Company, and did not take his freedom in the Weavers' Company until May 1669. He married Anne (<i>d</i>. 1683), with whom he had at least two sons and a daughter, and the family settled in Gravel Lane, in the East End of the City.<br>
<br>Richards made his fortune by importing Virginia tobacco. In 1672, and again in 1676, he was the second largest dealer, and still ranked fifth in the much greater trade of 1686. His prominence in colonial commerce was attested by his appearance among the signatories of a petition to the privy council in June 1677 for the payment of bills of exchange by the governors of Virginia. Moreover, he also signed a petition of tobacco importers in September 1685 which implored the government to encourage a trade undergoing &#145;difficulties&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP col.</span>, 12.98). Under James II he gained new prominence in civic circles, being appointed in July 1685 to the court of assistants of the Weavers' Company. Two years later he was removed from both the court and the livery, only to be restored in February 1688 as the government desperately sought support in the capital. Despite these political and mercantile upheavals, his finances remained sound, and he valued himself in June 1690 at &#145;above &pound;8,000 in goods and good debts and money&#146;  (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/421/138).<br>
<br>Richards was buried on 13 June 1694 at St Botolph's, Aldgate, London. Judging by his will, he was a most scrupulous businessman, having set aside sums to pay duties for tobacco &#145;which the waiters of several Virginia ships did order me to post short of what I ought and should have done&#146; some eighteen years previously  (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/421/138). He also proved a generous benefactor to several good causes, most notably Christ's Hospital, which received a legacy of &pound;200. His wife having predeceased him, the bulk of his estate passed to his only surviving son, Philip, who died in April 1695. The Richards fortune thus passed to George's daughter, Sarah, who, through her marriage to the influential tobacco merchant Richard Perry, united the business and wealth of two of the most prominent families in that trade.<br>
