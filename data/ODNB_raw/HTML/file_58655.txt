<span class="headword">Monsell,  Bolton Meredith  Eyres</span>, first Viscount Monsell  (1881&#150;1969), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born at home at Hamble Cottage, Hamble, Hampshire, on 22 February 1881. His Anglo-Irish ascendancy family was a branch of the Monsells of Tervoe, who had settled in co. Limerick in 1644 and were represented in the senior line by the extinct barons Emly. His grandfather was the hymn writer <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18982/', "John Samuel Bewley Monsell")</script>. His father, Bolton James Alfred Monsell (1840&#150;1919), was an army officer and then chief constable of the Metropolitan Police from 1886 to 1910, and his mother, Mary Beverley Ogle (<i>d</i>. 1929), was the second daughter of General Sir Edmund Ogle, sixth baronet; Monsell was the younger of their two sons in a family of six children. Although his father had an army background, Monsell was destined for the senior service. After preparatory schooling at Stubbington House, Fareham, he entered HMS <i>Britannia</i> as a cadet in 1894. He went to sea as a midshipman in 1896 and specialized as a torpedo lieutenant in 1903, but his marriage to an heiress brought his naval career to a close. On 3 December 1904 he wed Caroline Mary Sybil (1881&#150;1959), the only child of Henry William Eyres of Dumbleton Hall, near Evesham in Worcestershire. The names were joined together as Eyres Monsell, and the match enabled him to retire from the navy in 1906 and embark instead upon a political career.<br>
<br>Monsell was elected Conservative MP for Evesham in January 1910, and in the following year became a whip at the suggestion of Bonar Law. During the war he returned to active duty in the navy, and was awarded the order of the Nile for service in Egypt in 1915 before being promoted to commander in 1917. Monsell became deputy chief whip, as treasurer of the household, on 5 February 1919. On 1 April 1921 he moved to the Admiralty, where he was civil lord up to the fall of the coalition and then parliamentary and financial secretary. He was on good terms with Stanley Baldwin, who sat for the adjacent Bewdley division, and with other Conservative anti-coalitionists. It was therefore not surprising that Bobby (as he was known to his friends) should be chosen as chief whip when that post became vacant shortly after Baldwin's succession to the Conservative leadership. Monsell was sworn of the privy council on 7 July 1923 and took over as chief whip on 25 July.<br>
<br>Monsell served as chief whip for more than eight years, and was considered one of the most successful holders of this office. He possessed enormous charm and impeccable manners, was amusing and intelligent, and liked to be liked. Noted as being the best-dressed man in the House of Commons, he was tall, elegant, and strikingly handsome. He was cultivated and sociable, and enjoyed the parties of the &#145;smart set&#146; and the company of women, but he was also very particular and easily bored, when a sardonic note might surface. He enjoyed yachting and holidays at friends' houses on the Mediterranean. He also loved life in the country, where shooting was his favourite pursuit; he took great trouble in shaping the Dumbleton woods into one of the best and most difficult shoots in the country.<br>
<br>Monsell enjoyed his work as chief whip, and was closely consulted by Baldwin on appointments and parliamentary strategy. Under his command the whips' office ran with smooth efficiency; in the 1924&#150;9 parliament the huge Conservative majority was organized in a rota system which gave MPs some leisure while ensuring a government majority. Although Monsell was normally a patient man, tempers can fray in the summer heat and in July 1928 his exasperation with Sir Basil Peto, a notably awkward &#145;die-hard&#146;, led to the unusual step of withdrawing the whip for several months. This explosion was untypical: dissidents were normally handled with &#145;a nice admixture of polite persuasion and hints of party discipline&#146;, applying &#145;the spur and bridle, when needed, with a deft touch&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 24 March 1969). He encouraged the development of both the 1922 committee and the party's official back-bench committee system which began in 1924. He faced a more difficult period while the Conservatives were fractious and dispirited in opposition between 1929 and 1931. Dissatisfaction with Baldwin's leadership and policy, whipped up by the press lords, led to two party meetings being held in 1930, the first of which Monsell chaired. The critics were outmanoeuvred, but unrest continued into the spring of 1931. Monsell, who had been knighted on 28 June 1929, acted as chief whip during the first emergency National Government and then joined the cabinet as first lord of the Admiralty on 5 November 1931.<br>
<br>The longest-serving first lord of the 1930s, Monsell began by restoring confidence after the shock of the Invergordon mutiny (September 1931) and the uncertainty of Sir Frederick Field's period as first sea lord (1930&#150;33). In 1932 Monsell decided to replace him with the outstanding service figure of the 1930s, Admiral Sir Ernle Chatfield, with whom he established a good working relationship based on mutual respect for their complementary roles. Under the economic pressures of the early 1930s, Monsell &#145;had to struggle on behalf of the Navy against his old friends in the Cabinet, a severe trial to his nature&#146;. By the end of his tenure, a programme of replacement and expansion had begun. In Chatfield's view &#145;no one could have done more, few could have achieved so much&#146;  (Chatfield, 2.98).<br>
<br>The Anglo-German naval agreement of 1935 was the most controversial event of Monsell's career. Although he signed it on Britain's behalf, it originated as a German offer and was shaped by many hands. The agreement was attacked by Churchill at the time and in his memoirs, and for many years after the Second World War it was regarded as a defining example of the folly of appeasement. The terms negotiated allowed Germany to build up to same strength in submarines, but her overall naval tonnage was limited to only 35 per cent of Britain's. Recent research has suggested that the Admiralty was mainly concerned with countering the danger that Germany would build large surface warships, and in this respect the agreement was successful. The German navy never posed a serious surface threat in the Second World War, while no treaty could have prevented the rapid building of submarines in wartime.<br>
<br>Monsell's intention to retire had been known since the middle of 1935, but he was persuaded to remain owing to the approaching international naval disarmament conference; as this met in London, he had the further burden of acting as its chairman. He retired from the House of Commons at the 1935 general election, and was raised to the peerage as Viscount Monsell on 30 November 1935. He eventually stood down as first lord on 5 June 1936, by which time the negotiations for the London naval treaty had been concluded. The conference failed to secure any significant disarmament, but even a partial continuation of the Washington treaty system had some advantages and was better than an unbridled naval arms race.<br>
<br>From 1941 to 1945 Monsell served as regional controller of civil defence for south-east England. He had one son and three daughters, but was something of a remote figure to his children. By the late 1940s his first marriage was effectively over, and he did not defend his wife's suit for divorce on grounds of adultery. A decree <i>nisi</i> was granted on 25 May 1950, and exactly two months later Monsell remarried. His second wife, Essex Leila Hilary (1907&#150;1996), was a granddaughter of the first earl of Ypres and daughter of Lieutenant-Colonel Edward Gerald Fleming French; her marriage to Captain Vivyan Drury of Castle Kevin, co. Wicklow, was dissolved in 1935. Monsell died on 21 March 1969, and was cremated at a ceremony held on 28 March, after which the ashes were scattered at sea from a warship. He was succeeded by his only son, Henry Bolton Graham Eyres Monsell (<i>b</i>. 1905), who died unmarried in 1993 and the title became extinct.<br>
