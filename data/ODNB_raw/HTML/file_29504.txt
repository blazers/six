<span class="headword">Williams,  George</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1762, <em>d.</em> 1834), <span class="occ">physician and librarian</span>, was baptized at Catherington, Hampshire, on 24 November 1762, the younger son of John Williams, vicar of Catherington, and his wife, Anne. Educated by his father, he was notably competent in Greek when he arrived at Winchester College in 1775. He entered Corpus Christi College, Oxford, as a scholar in 1777, graduated BA in 1781, was elected a fellow, and later served the college repeatedly, either as bursar or vice-president. After studying medicine at St Bartholomew's Hospital, London, he proceeded MA in 1785 and MD in 1788.<br>
<br>While practising in Oxford, in 1789 Williams was appointed a physician to the Radcliffe Infirmary. This was sufficient for the Royal College of Physicians (of which he was elected a fellow in 1799) to appoint him, in 1796, to the regius and Sherardian chair of botany. The Oxford Physic Garden was run down and liable to regular flooding. Williams did nothing to improve it, but since he obtained election to fellowship of the Linnean Society in 1798, collected plants in the Oxford area which he added to the herbarium, and took a keen interest in the garden at Corpus, it seems likely that it was the condition of the physic garden, together with lack of means, which deterred him. His botany lectures were given by William Baxter, the gardener.<br>
<br>In 1810 Williams became the first physician to be appointed to the part-time post of Radcliffe librarian, which was worth &pound;150 per annum. Williams's enduring legacy was his innovative flair in giving the Radcliffe Library, for the first time, both an identity and utility. The Radcliffe Camera of 1749 had had no settled policy of acquisition or collection, and some 2300 books on many subjects had been shelved almost randomly. Neglect by Williams's predecessor, Thomas Hornsby, who had not spent a penny on acquisitions in twenty-seven years, had allowed surplus to accrue in the Radcliffe Fund. The founding in 1803 of the Aldrichian chair of anatomy and physiology to complement the Lee's readership had put medical teaching on a sound basis, and a chair of rural economy was in prospect. Hence Williams &#145;in large part&#146; initiated a policy of transforming the library to specialize in natural history, sciences, and medicine, and to include relevant works in the major European languages  (Guest, 167). By 1813 he had spent &pound;2000; he spent a further &pound;1000 in 1814, and &pound;500 per annum thereafter&#151;a total of &pound;9000 by 1834. Diligent, capable, and selflessly helpful to all enquirers, by the time of his death he had almost completed the great labour of cataloguing the collection, the product of which was published by his successor, John Kidd, in 1835. This at last made the library an important repository. By 1857 the collection numbered 15,000 volumes, and it remained in the Radcliffe Camera until 1861.<br>
<br>Williams's health gradually weakened after 1829 but did not prevent him serving Corpus again, as vice-president, in 1832. Never married, he died at his home in High Street, Oxford on 17 January 1834. He was commemorated by an elaborate and affectionate monument in the chapel of Corpus Christi College, and by a tribute from the Radcliffe trustees, appreciating their remarkable librarian. His thoughtful bequest of &pound;500 to improve the physic garden was the nucleus for successful fund-raising by Charles Daubeny, his successor there.<br>
