<span class="headword">Payne,  Edward John</span>  (1844&#150;1904), <span class="occ">historian</span>, was born of humble origins at Easton Street, High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire, on 22 July 1844; he was the son of Edward William Payne, a gardener, and his wife, Mary Welch. Payne owed his education largely to his own exertions. After receiving early training at the grammar school, High Wycombe, he was employed by a local architect and surveyor named Pontifex, and he studied architecture under William Burges. Interested in music from youth, he also acted as organist of the parish church. In 1867, at the age of twenty-three, he matriculated at Magdalen Hall, Oxford, whence he passed to Charsley's Hall. While an undergraduate he supported himself at first by pursuing his work as land surveyor and architect at High Wycombe, where he designed the Easton Street almshouses, and afterwards by coaching in classics at Oxford. In 1871 Payne graduated BA with a first class in the final classical school, and in 1872 he was elected to an open fellowship in University College. He remained a fellow until his marriage when he was re-elected to a research fellowship.<br>
<br>On 5 April 1899 Payne married Emma Leonora Helena, daughter of Major Pertz and granddaughter of the historian Georg Heinrich Pertz. They had one son, the archaeologist <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35422/', "Humfry Gilbert Garth Payne")</script>. Their life was mainly spent in London, but Payne was keenly interested in the management of the affairs of his college, and during the years of serious agricultural depression his good counsel and business aptitude proved of great service.<br>
<br>On 17 November 1874 Payne was called to the bar by Lincoln's Inn, and in 1883 was appointed honorary recorder of High Wycombe, holding the office until his death. But his mature years were mainly devoted to literary work. British colonial history and exploration were the main subjects of his study. In 1875 he contributed a <span class="italic">History of European Colonies</span> to E. A. Freeman's <span class="roman">Historical Course for Schools</span>. In 1883 he collaborated with J. S. Cotton in <span class="italic">Colonies and Dependencies</span> for the <span class="roman">English Citizen</span> series, and the section on colonies which fell to Payne he later developed into his <span class="italic">Colonies and Colonial Federation</span> (1904). He also edited Edmund Burke's <span class="italic">Select Works</span> (1876; new edn, 1912) and <span class="italic">The Voyages of Elizabethan Seamen to America</span> (1880; new edn, 1907). But these labours were preliminaries to a great design of a <span class="italic">History of the New World called America</span>. The first and second volumes (published respectively in 1892 and 1899) supplied a preliminary sketch of the geographical knowledge and exploration of the middle ages, an account of the discovery of America, and the beginning of an exhaustive summing up of all available knowledge as to the ethnology, language, religion, and social and economic condition of the indigenous peoples. Nothing more was published, and an original plan to extend the survey to Australasia was untouched. Payne contributed the first two chapters on &#145;The Age of Discovery&#146; and &#145;The New World&#146; to volume one of the <span class="roman">Cambridge Modern History</span> (1902).<br>
<br>At the same time Payne wrote much on music. He contributed many pieces to Grove's <span class="italic">Dictionary of Music and Musicians</span>, and in particular the article on Stradivari. The history of stringed instruments had a strong attraction for him, and he was himself an accomplished amateur performer on the violin and on various ancient instruments. He helped to found the Bar Musical Society, and was its first honorary secretary. He was also a golfer.<br>
<br>In his later years Payne lived at Holywell Lodge, Wendover, and suffered from heart weakness and fits of giddiness. On 26 December 1904 he was found drowned in the Wendover Canal, into which he had apparently fallen in a fit. He was survived by his wife, one son, and two daughters; his widow was given a civil-list pension of &pound;120 in 1905.<br>
