<span class="headword">Watson,  Rundle Burges</span>  (1809&#150;1860), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, was the eldest son of Captain Joshua Rowley Watson (1772&#150;1810). He entered the navy in November 1821, and was promoted lieutenant on 7 October 1829. He served on the coast of Portugal and on the North American station, until in November 1837 he was appointed to the frigate <i>Calliope</i> (26 guns), with Captain Thomas Herbert (1793&#150;1861). After two years on the coast of Brazil the <i>Calliope</i> was sent to China, where she was actively employed during the First Opium War. On 6 May 1841 Watson was promoted commander, and was moved with Herbert to the <i>Blenheim</i> (72 guns), and while in her was repeatedly engaged with the enemy, in command of either boats or landing parties. On 23 December 1842 he was advanced to post rank, and on 24 December was made a CB.<br>
<br>On 1 February 1845 Watson married Helen, second daughter of John Bettington of Pittville; and they had a large family. From February 1846 to October 1849 he commanded the small frigate <i>Brilliant</i> (20 guns) on the Cape of Good Hope station; and in December 1852 was appointed to the new steam frigate <i>Imp&eacute;rieuse</i> (50 guns), then, and for some years later, considered one of the finest ships in the navy. In 1854 she was sent into the Baltic in advance of the fleet, Watson being senior officer of the squadron of small vessels appointed to watch the breaking up of the ice, and to see that no Russian warships got to sea. It was an arduous service well performed. The <i>Imp&eacute;rieuse</i> continued with the flying squadron in the Baltic during the campaigns of 1854 and 1855, and until the signing of peace in March 1856. As the senior officer of the frigate squadron, and generally on detached service, Watson demonstrated the highest standards of seamanship, judgement, and leadership. After the peace the <i>Imp&eacute;rieuse</i> was sent to the North American station; she returned to England and was paid off early in 1857. From May 1856 until his death Watson was naval aide-de-camp to the queen. In June 1859 he was appointed captain-superintendent of Sheerness Dockyard, where he died on 5 July 1860. An officer of great ability, Watson was one of the last great sailing-ship captains, and the first frigate captain of the steam era.<br>
