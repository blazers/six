<span class="headword">Aumonier,  James</span>  (1832&#150;1911), <span class="occ">landscape painter</span>, born in Camberwell on 9 April 1832, was the son of Henry Collingwood Aumonier, a jeweller, and his wife, Nancy Frances, daughter of George Stacy. The family was of French descent. A younger brother worked as an engraver and a nephew, Stacy Aumonier (1877&#150;1928), became a landscape painter and decorative designer before becoming a successful short story writer. During James's childhood, which he spent in north London at Highgate and High Barnet, he showed an early enthusiasm for art: in a later letter to the writer on art Nancy Bell he reminisced about his early experiments in painting garden flowers with his small collection of watercolours and the fact that he was given various colours by a neighbouring coach painter for his first work in oil, a picture of Barking church after an engraving. At the age of fourteen he started work in an unknown business, but also attended evening classes at the London Mechanics' Institution, and subsequently at the Government School of Design, South Kensington. He was sufficiently successful in his studies to find work as a textile designer with a London firm. He married Amelia, daughter of James Wright, a gold beater, on 8 August 1863 and had two sons and two daughters, including Louise, who exhibited flower paintings at the London galleries.<br>
<br>While working for the textile firm Aumonier began to paint out of doors in his spare time. Initially he sketched in the cloisters of Westminster Abbey and in Kensington Gardens in the early hours of the morning before starting work; he later took short train journeys out of London to places such as Epping Forest and Croydon. <span class="italic">Old Farm Buildings, near Croydon</span> and <span class="italic">Lane near Addington, Surrey</span>, both painted in the Croydon area, were his first publicly exhibited works, shown in 1864, at the British Institution and at the Society of British Artists' galleries in Suffolk Street respectively. He first exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1871, in which year he made the acquaintance of the artists Lionel Smythe and William Morison Wyllie (father of William Lionel Wyllie). The latter especially gave Aumonier much practical advice. In 1873 John Newton Mappin purchased <span class="italic">An English Cottage Home</span> (Mappin Art Gallery, Sheffield) from the Royal Academy exhibition. This established Aumonier's reputation, although he continued to work at the textile factory for some time after. Aumonier's paintings were predominantly of the English countryside, peaceful landscapes characterized by the use of warm tints and an overall evenness of tone; contemporary critics admired his ability to capture atmosphere and the effects of light. He exhibited a great number of works at the Royal Institute of Painters in Water Colours; he was elected an associate in 1876 and a member in 1879. <span class="italic">In a Gloucestershire Wood</span> was shown at the institute in 1883 and is now in the collection of Maidstone Museums and Art Gallery. Aumonier was one of the original members of the Institute of Painters in Oil Colours; his oils <span class="italic">Sheep-Washing in Sussex</span> and <span class="italic">The Black Mountains</span>, exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1889 and 1905, are now in the Tate collection. A member of the short-lived British Society of Pastellists, he also worked in mezzotint, exhibiting <span class="italic">The Close of Day</span> at the Royal Academy in 1886 and another such work, untitled, in 1888. He left England only once, when in 1891 he visited Venice and the Dolomites; he exhibited Venetian subjects at the Royal Academy in 1892 and 1893.<br>
<br>In 1889 Aumonier received a gold medal for watercolour painting in Paris and was also the recipient of awards at exhibitions in Berlin, Brussels, Cardiff, Melbourne, and Manchester. On more than one occasion, at the beginning of the twentieth century, he received a number of votes in the elections of associate members of the Royal Academy but was unsuccessful. Aumonier was one of a group of painters including John Leslie Thomson, James Stevens Hill, and Arthur Douglas Peppercorn who held annual exhibitions of landscapes in oil at the Royal Watercolour Society's gallery. His first one-man exhibition was of watercolours and was held at the Leicester Galleries in 1908. He died on 4 October 1911 at 97 South Hill Park, Hampstead; his remains were cremated at Woking. In addition to the collections mentioned above, he is represented in the Leeds and Manchester city art galleries, as well as in public collections in Australia.<br>
