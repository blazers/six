</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Gill,  Austin</span>  (1906&#150;1990), <span class="occ">French scholar</span>, was born on 3 September 1906 at 6B Northgate Street, Stockport, the second child and first son of Austin Gill (<i>b</i>. 1876/7), a cotton operative, and his wife, Ada, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Nuttall (<i>b</i>. 1880/81). His parents were also born in the Stockport area, though the family was originally from Ireland. His mother was a devout Catholic, but Gill rejected religious beliefs at an early age.<br>
<br>The family moved to the village of Hawkshaw, near Bury, Lancashire, from where Gill attended Bury municipal secondary school before studying French at the University of Manchester. There he came under the influence of the eminent Romance philologist John Orr, to whose &#145;teaching, example and friendship&#146; he later paid tribute  (<span class="italic">Ramonneurs</span>, viii). After graduating with first-class honours in 1928 he went to study in France, principally in Grenoble, but also in Paris. A strong football player, he played centre-half for the Grenoble club, who offered to pay him clandestinely to play for them as an amateur. He rejected this subterfuge, and a series of grants from Manchester allowed him to remain in France until 1933, obtaining a <i>licence-&egrave;s-lettres</i> and broaching some of his later research topics.<br>
<br>In 1933 Orr moved to the chair of French at Edinburgh University and offered Gill a post as lecturer in the department, where he remained for the next ten years. In 1939 he was married in Oran, Algeria, to Madeleine Henriette Monier, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Troegeler (<i>c</i>.1915&#150;2004), a north African-born Frenchwoman, who had a daughter, H&eacute;l&egrave;ne, by her previous marriage. Madeleine was a teacher in the Edinburgh French department and after 1940 the representative in Scotland of General de Gaulle, a post that took this striking young woman to bleak military outposts on the Firth of Forth. Gill too was active in promoting Franco-British understanding, and in 1943 he was appointed British Council representative in French north Africa, which was now under allied control. The year he spent there saw the establishment of a provisional French government under de Gaulle against some opposition from the Americans and the British; setting up a British Council office in this environment was a delicate diplomatic task. Gill's work brought him into contact with French writers, notably Andr&eacute; Gide, who wrote in his <span class="italic">Journal</span> of the &#145;tr&egrave;s aimable Gill&#146;  (Gide, <span class="italic">Journal II (1926&#150;1950)</span>, 1997, 996&#150;7).<br>
<br>After the liberation of Paris in August 1944 Gill was transferred to the French capital as acting representative of the British Council, and remained there for nearly a year. His successor wrote in a memorandum to the council that<blockquote>the retirement of Mr Gill, whose energy and experience have built up this office, leaves a gap which no one man can easily fill. He has worked under incredibly difficult conditions and has definitely placed the British Council on the Paris map. (Anthony Bertram, 8 Oct 1945, TNA: PRO, BW 31/13)</blockquote>He organized a wide range of activities and brought to Paris the Old Vic, an acclaimed exhibition of children's art, and such figures of note as T. S. Eliot, Julian Huxley, and Henry Moore.<br>
<br>In September 1945 Gill resigned from the British Council to take up a fellowship in French at Magdalen College, Oxford. During his years there the college was a place of high academic distinction, with such notable fellows as C. S. Lewis and A. J. P. Taylor. Unlike some of his colleagues Gill was not a larger-than-life &#145;character&#146;; he impressed his pupils as a man like other men, who was also an inspiring tutor. They remembered his imposing physical presence, his high academic and moral standards, his courtesy, humour, and understanding, his love of France, and his deep knowledge of French language and literature of all periods. His interests stretched from the history of the language (in particular slang) and Saussurian linguistics to Renaissance and modern literature. Unusually, in the Oxford of his day, he spoke French impeccably and lectured in the language.<br>
<br>From 1950 to 1954 Gill returned to Paris, having been offered the post of director of the British Institute, for which his combination of diplomatic and academic experience and his knowledge of French life and culture made him uniquely qualified. He turned down the offer of the post of adviser to the British embassy in Paris, preferring to return to academic life at Magdalen, where he acted for some years as vice-president. He was made CBE for his British Council work in 1955. In Oxford his combative character made him enemies as well as friends, and in 1966 he unexpectedly resigned to take up the Marshall chair of French in Glasgow. In his short time in Glasgow he made many institutional changes, completely revised the departmental syllabus, and was remembered for &#145;his dynamic leadership, his exacting standards, his great integrity, his mastery of the discipline and dedication to all things French&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Independent</span>, 28 March 1990).<br>
<br>Gill retired in 1971 in order to devote himself to writing, ably supported by his wife. Until then he had published little: an edition (1957) of <span class="italic">Les Ramonneurs</span>, a newly discovered, anonymous seventeenth-century comedy that he convincingly attributed to Alexandre Hardy; the general editorship of a three-volume textbook series, <span class="roman">Life and Letters in France</span> (1965&#150;70); and a number of articles in learned journals, concerned above all with the poet Mallarm&eacute;. He had discovered Mallarm&eacute; in Grenoble and been enthralled by the sound of his verse. He had first intended to elucidate the more famous later poems, but came to believe that it was essential to study in its own right the early work, in which the poet's method and beliefs were elaborated. The result was the two volumes of <span class="italic">The Early Mallarm&eacute;</span> (1980 and 1986), which distilled decades of detailed and wide-ranging research into Mallarm&eacute;'s early life and his intellectual and literary world, with particular stress on his rejection of Christianity. In his faithfulness to biographical research and his belief that &#145;in his poems Mallarm&eacute; expresses ideas&#146;  (Barbier, 145) and that &#145;the obscurity of Mallarm&eacute;'s hermetic writings can in principle be dispelled&#146;  (<span class="italic">Mallarm&eacute;'s Poem</span>, 6), Gill was a representative of the old philological school who found himself at odds with the critical tendencies of the 1980s. He disliked what he saw as the wilful obscurity of much Mallarm&eacute; criticism and once wrote to a correspondent: &#145;For me the word &#147;crystal-clear&#148; shines like a star. My firmest vow, as a scholar, made many years ago, is never knowingly to write obscurely about M[allarm&eacute;] (or attempt to explain what I don't understand)&#146;  (Gill to John Cocking, <i>c</i>. March 1980, Magd. Oxf., Gill papers, box 5).<br>
<br>In his last years Gill's health declined sharply; he suffered a stroke and began to be affected by Alzheimer's disease. He died of bronchopneumonia in Gartnavel General Hospital, Glasgow, on 21 March 1990 and was cremated in Glasgow, his ashes being scattered in a rose garden. He was survived by his wife, Madeleine.<br>
