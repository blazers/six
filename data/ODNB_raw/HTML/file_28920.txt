<span class="headword">Webb,  Francis Cornelius</span>  (1826&#150;1873), <span class="occ">physician and medical writer</span>, born in Hoxton Square, London, on 9 April 1826, was the eldest son of William Webb (1780&#150;1831), a cadet of the family of Webb of Odstock Manor, Hampshire, and his second wife, Elizabeth Priscilla (<i>d</i>. 1850), daughter of Thomas Massett and widow of Ambrose Holloway. He was educated at King's College School, London, and at Devonport grammar school, where he became a sound classical scholar. On 25 September 1841 he was apprenticed to James Sheppard, a surgeon at Stonehouse, Plymouth, and in 1843 he joined the medical school of University College, London. He was awarded five gold or silver medals for proficiency in different classes. In 1847 he became a member of the Royal College of Surgeons, and in 1849 he proceeded to Edinburgh, graduating MD there in 1850. In 1851 he returned to London and became a licentiate of the Society of Apothecaries. On 10 February 1852 he married Sarah Schr&ouml;der (<i>b</i>. 1828), daughter of Joseph Croucher, of Great James's Street, Buckingham Gate, London; they had twelve children, ten of whom survived their father.<br>
<br>In 1859 Webb was admitted a member of the Royal College of Physicians, and he was elected a fellow on 31 July 1873. In 1857 he was nominated to the chair of medical jurisprudence in the Grosvenor Place school of medicine, and subsequently he was lecturer on natural history at the Metropolitan School of Dental Science. In 1861 at the Grosvenor Place school Webb delivered the introductory lecture, &#145;The study of medicine: its dignity and rewards&#146;, which was published by request. His first important literary effort was his article &#145;The sweating sickness in England&#146;; first published in the <span class="italic">Sanitary Review and Journal of Public Health</span> for July 1857, it was afterwards republished separately. Webb next wrote &#145;An historical account of gaol fever&#146;, read before the Epidemiological Society on 6 July 1857 and printed in its <span class="italic">Transactions</span>. In 1858 his essay &#145;Metropolitan hygiene of the past&#146; appeared in <span class="italic">Sanitary Review</span>; it was published in the January issue and was reprinted separately in the same year; it comprised a brief survey of the sanitary conditions of London from the time of the Norman conquest until the nineteenth century. When Hunter's work on teeth was published in the <span class="italic">Dental Review</span>, Webb contributed notes to the text, embodying results of contemporary research on the subject which were designed to bring Hunter's work up to date. <span class="italic">Hunter's Natural History of the Human Teeth</span>, with notes by Webb and R. T. Hulme, appeared in 1865.<br>
<br>A few years later Webb became one of the editors of the <span class="italic">Medical Times and Gazette</span>, and for the last years of his life he was editor-in-chief. He was elected a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries on 22 May 1856, of the Linnean Society on 21 January 1858, and of other learned bodies. He was an accomplished musician, and took an interest in literature, art, and philosophy.<br>
<br>On 23 December 1873, having spent a busy day correcting proofs and preparing the <span class="italic">Medical Times and Gazette</span> for press, Webb had a hurried dinner before returning home to 22 Woburn Place, Russell Square, to help arrange a party planned for that evening. He had suffered from heart trouble for some time, and early the following morning he began to complain of chest pains; he died the same day, 24 December 1873, at home; he was buried in Highgate cemetery. A fund was started to help support his widow and ten children, who were aged between four and twenty-one, as most of the money from his life insurance had to be used to pay debts incurred in bringing up his children. The appeal raised over &pound;2000 for the family.<br>
