<span class="headword">Delaval, Sir  Francis Blake</span>  (1727&#150;1771), <span class="occ">rake</span>, was born on 16 March 1727, the second child and eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/76465/', "Francis Blake Delaval (bap. 1692, d. 1752)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/73888/', "Delaval family")</script>] of Seaton Delaval and Ford, Northumberland, and his wife, Rhoda (<i>d</i>. 1759), daughter of Robert Apreece of Washingly, Huntingdonshire, and maternal granddaughter and heiress of Sir Thomas Hussey, second baronet, of Doddington, Lincolnshire. His ten siblings&#151;seven brothers and three sisters&#151;included <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/39337/', "John Hussey Delaval")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7454/', "Edward Hussey Delaval")</script>. His paternal ancestors were long-established coal-owning landowners in Northumberland whose estates had been consolidated by Francis's great-uncle George Delaval and then extended by advantageous marriages. He was educated at Westminster School (1737&#150;44) and at Christ Church, Oxford, where he matriculated in 1747 but did not take a degree. Delaval established an early reputation for wrongdoing. In 1747 he was one of four Christ Church undergraduates suspected of being responsible for the death of a college servant. However, the coroner's court ruled that the servant was murdered by &#145;persons unknown&#146; and the Oxfordshire grand jury refused to bring charges against the four.<br>
<br>From Oxford Delaval moved to London where he became known for his good looks and enthusiastic gambling. In March 1747 he was reported by Horace Walpole to be keeping an Italian mistress, Tedeschi (probably the singer Caterina), and having beaten her and her lover the castrato Gaetano Guadagni on finding them in bed together. During 1749 he became the lover of Elizabeth Roach or La Roche (<i>b</i>. 1730/31), a minor heiress, daughter of a Major Roach of Fort St George, India, and Mariana Raworth, and the ward of John Potter (<i>d</i>. 1750), under-secretary of state in Ireland, who had married Delaval's cousin Susan Robinson of Dissington, Northumberland. Marriage was rumoured but did not take place, perhaps because Delaval's parents objected on the grounds of Roach's illegitimacy. Delaval and Roach had two children. In November 1749 Delaval unsuccessfully attempted to be elected as MP for Andover, Hampshire.<br>
<br>Financially embarrassed, Delaval was introduced by the actor Samuel Foote to a much older widow said to possess over &pound;110,000, Lady Nassau Pawlet, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Lady Isabella Tufton (<i>c</i>.1700&#150;1763), daughter of Thomas Tufton, sixth earl of Thanet. After the infliction of &#145;Terrors alias Humbug&#146; upon Isabella  (William Kelynge to F. B. Delaval, 1754?, Northumberland Archives, 2DE/38/4/6), convincing her that her conduct was thought to be in question, Delaval and Isabella, were married in the parish of St George, Hanover Square, on 8 March 1750. Lady Isabella proved only to have &pound;23,000 under her control, barely adequate for Delaval's needs. After several months of paying Delaval's debts, Lady Isabella sought shelter with Foote. Delaval forced Foote to surrender a promissory note for &pound;12,000, kidnapped Lady Isabella, and forced her to sign a new marriage settlement surrendering control of her income. His friendship with Foote was later repaired.<br>
<br>Delaval's notoriety seems to have been cemented less by these activities than by his devotion to the performing arts. When resident in Newcastle upon Tyne, he studied music with Charles Avison. In London, in March 1751 he led a &#145;Set of Gentlemen and Ladies&#146; in a performance of <span class="italic">Othello</span> at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, in which Delaval played Othello and his brother John Iago, with Elizabeth Roach as Emilia. Attended by the prince and princess of Wales and other members of the royal family, the event was hailed in the press as a triumph of gentility over professionalism. Delaval followed this social triumph with election as member of parliament for Hindon, Wiltshire, in the by-election of 4 May 1751. By June his debts were already being consolidated and extended through his brother John.<br>
<br>Delaval was elected at his old target, Andover, in 1754. The seat was probably chosen as one where a vulnerable ally of the duke of Newcastle might be unseated, a tactical move against Newcastle whom the Delavals were working to undermine as principal patron at Newark. Though Delaval was hailed as one of those &#145;Men of large Property&#146; who deserved to win &#145;every Borough in the Kingdom&#146;  (<span class="italic">London Evening Post</span>, 8 Nov 1753), his electoral adventures added to his excessive debts. He remained more remarkable for spectacle than for politics, engaging in episodes such as a rowing-boat race on the Thames where he lost &#145;a considerable Sum of Money&#146; to his victorious brother John  (<span class="italic">Whitehall Evening Post</span>, 2 May 1754). In January 1755 Delaval was prosecuted for adultery with Elizabeth Roach, but he countered with claims that Lady Isabella had been seen in bed with another man at a bawdy house in Charing Cross. With his debts now exceeding &pound;45,000, in 1755 a private act of parliament settled fixed proportions of the revenues of the Northumberland estates upon Francis while the property itself was managed by his brothers John and (in the case of Hartley salt pits) Thomas.<br>
<br>Following Henry Fox's appointment as secretary of state in October 1755, Delaval joined the government side in the Commons. He startled society in May 1758 when he went as a volunteer on the expedition to St Malo. He confounded expectations by landing first and acquitting himself bravely, albeit in the face of minimal resistance from the French. He was created a knight of the Bath in March 1761, and secured re-election in Andover in 1761 after Newcastle arranged support from his former antagonist, the earl of Portsmouth. After a disastrous attack on Pitt in the Commons on 9 December, from which he then tried to withdraw, his career in debate ended. He wavered between government and opposition depending on which was most likely to help the appointment of his brother Edward to the chair of modern history and languages at Cambridge, promised by Newcastle but awarded elsewhere by the earl of Bute, or else (successfully) a pension. His move in 1762 to 11 Downing Street assisted his efforts with lobbying, though his surviving letters to George Grenville, his neighbour from 1763 to 1765, reveal a petulance at what he saw as his lack of favour.<br>
<br>Delaval granted his brother John power of attorney over his estates and shares in government securities in 1758, and further rearrangements of his financial affairs were made in 1761 and 1764. Elizabeth Roach had left him in 1758 to marry Sir Henry Echlin, third baronet. By February 1763 a young actress, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4895/', "Ann Catley")</script>, was living openly with Delaval as his mistress. Catley had been apprenticed to the musician William Bates, whose interest Delaval bought out for &pound;200 plus the estimated revenue from her singing engagements, before binding Catley as his own apprentice by way of formalizing their union. Catley's father protested, leading to Delaval producing Catley in the court of king's bench on a writ of habeas corpus on 16 May and on 22 June appearing alongside his lawyer and Bates on charges of conspiracy to remove Catley from the musician and to place her in the hands of Delaval for the purposes of prostitution. Lord Chief Justice Mansfield's judgment that the charge was &#145;contrary to decency and morality&#146; was a legal turning point, expressing Mansfield's view that king's bench was &#145;the custos morum of the people&#146;  (<i>R. v. Delaval</i>, 3. Burr. 1434 at 1437&#150;8). Catley's seduction and contractual obligation to be Delaval's mistress&#150;apprentice were understood by the court primarily as offences against society and not against her father's authority over a dependent female. Delaval was found guilty at the subsequent trial and heavily fined, and his relationship with Catley ended soon afterwards. His wife died in December 1763, but his debts and reputation deterred other potential brides.<br>
<br>Delaval's lifestyle was jolted when in February 1766 he brought Samuel Foote to Cannon Park, Hampshire, home of his sister Sarah and her husband John Savile, first earl of Mexborough. Delaval, John Delaval, and Prince Edward, duke of York, encouraged Foote to ride York's notoriously unmanageable horse. Foote was thrown and broke his leg in two places, leading to its amputation. It was Francis Delaval who accompanied Foote back to London in April, though it is John's contrite letter of apology for his part in causing his injury which survives, epitomizing the division of business between the two brothers. A rumour that Delaval was Foote's partner in the patent for the Little Theatre, Haymarket, was mistaken.<br>
<br>Delaval's love of stagecraft led him into an interest in mechanics. In August 1766 he demonstrated on Westminster Bridge a safety cord which successfully separated a passenger carriage from runaway horses. He also collaborated with Richard Lovell Edgeworth on a series of illusions exhibited at Downing Street to &#145;those who sought mere amusement&#146; and &#145;men of letters and science&#146;  (Edgeworth and Edgeworth, 76). Edgeworth was stage assistant for Delaval's return to public amateur dramatics in May 1767 with several performances of Nicholas Rowe's <span class="italic">The Fair Penitent</span> at Delaval's private theatre on James Street. These performances were less fashionable than those of <span class="italic">Othello</span> in 1751: &#145;none of the royal family have been audience&#146;  (Walpole, 22.521). In the same year he was the dedicatee of Christopher Smart's translation of Horace.<br>
<br>Despite a visit from the duke and duchess of Northumberland to show their support, Delaval lost his Commons seat at Andover in 1768. However, at the election for Middlesex that year he appeared on the hustings as a supporter of John Wilkes, and afterwards embarked on an extra-parliamentary career as a member of the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/73620', "Society of Gentlemen Supporters of the Bill of Rights")</script>. He chaired some meetings of the society in Westminster, encouraged opposition to Wilkes's exclusion from the Commons in Newcastle upon Tyne, and arranged petitions from the gentlemen, clergy, and freeholders of Northumberland and from the burgesses of Newcastle in 1770 requesting a dissolution of parliament. Delaval was unable to gain a parliamentary nomination on the back of this activity, Wilkes supposedly believing him a spy for the court. Perhaps more representative of Delaval's interests was the scheme he devised with Edgeworth at about this time for a telegraph system which would rapidly convey racing results from Newmarket to London. While their experiments showed that a chain of mechanical semaphores was possible, it was too expensive for everyday use.<br>
<br>By early 1771 Delaval's financial position was irrecoverable and John Delaval enforced a new settlement in which Francis and their other surviving brother, Thomas, surrendered their estates, collieries, and saltworks in Northumberland to a trustee in return for annuities, in Delaval's case of &pound;4000. Having suffered from chest pains for over a year, Delaval died at the Mexboroughs' house in Dover Street, London, on 7 August 1771. A post mortem found his stomach in &#145;a very inflamed state&#146;  (<span class="italic">General Evening Post</span>, 15 Aug 1771) and another report described an incurable inflammation of the liver  (ibid., 17 Aug 1771). He was buried on 23 August at the family chapel adjacent to Seaton Delaval Hall, Northumberland.<br>
<br>Delaval displayed frequent signs of melancholy: Elizabeth Roach complained of his indifference and indolence, he urged Edgeworth to live a useful life, and in his will he expressed the wish that he could have died twenty years sooner. His children with Elizabeth Roach&#151;a son, Francis (<i>d</i>. 1826), and a daughter, Frances&#151;were provided for within the Delaval family. As well as a child with Ann Catley, he also had two daughters, Frances and Lydia Davidson, possibly with the same mistress, Mrs Davidson of Gateshead.<br>
<br>Delaval's behaviour as a young man was often reprehensible, though contemporaries thought him possessed of great charm. He personified through his lavish expenditure and love of show the paradoxes of &#145;the gentleman, and the man of honour&#146;  (<span class="italic">Gazetteer and New Daily Advertiser</span>, 4 Sept 1771), playing the roles of defender of constitutional liberty, generous patron, and jovial gambler while undermining the basis of his social standing by financially compromising his estate and appearing in court as a threat to public morality. In approaching marriage as an economic transaction he treated his older and vulnerable wife with great cruelty, while his apparent indifference to convention regarding his relationships with Elizabeth Roach and Ann Catley appealed to pamphleteers who could depict him as a real-life manifestation of the stock literary figure, the unscrupulous seducer of maidens.<br>
