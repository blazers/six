<span class="headword">Ua Conchobair,  Toirdelbach  M&oacute;r</span> <span class="st"> [Turlough the Great O'Connor]</span>  (1088&#150;1156), <span class="occ">high-king of Ireland</span>, held from <i>c</i>.1120 that precarious supremacy over most other rulers in Ireland which justified native historians in styling a series of dominant kings during the eleventh and twelfth centuries &#145;high-kings with opposition&#146;. Toirdelbach was born in Connacht, the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20521/', "Ruaidr&#237; Ua Conchobair")</script> (<i>d</i>. 1118; also known as Ruaidr&iacute; na Saide Buide, or &#145;Rory of the Yellow Bitch&#146;), king of Connacht, and M&oacute;r (<i>d</i>. 1088), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20468/', "Toirdelbach M&#243;r Ua Briain (d. 1086), king of Munster")</script> and &#145;high-king with opposition&#146;. As &#145;Toirdelbach&#146; was then very much an Ua Briain family name, the subject of this article was presumably called after his maternal grandfather, significantly so, in that Ua Briain had played a part in the defeat and death of Ruaidr&iacute; na Saide Buide's father in 1067, before forcing Ruaidr&iacute; himself to submit in 1076. The marriage of Ruaidr&iacute; and M&oacute;r may have been brief. She died the year of her son Toirdelbach's birth, having earlier borne a daughter to another husband, M&aacute;elsechlainn Ua M&aacute;elsechlainn, king of Meath (<i>d</i>. 1087).<br>
<br>Also in 1088, Ruaidr&iacute; changed allegiance to the rival northern high-king, Domnall Mac Lochlainn of T&iacute;r Eoghain (<i>d</i>. 1121), and joined him on an invasion of Munster, razing the Ua Briain palace of Kincora, while Connacht was invaded by Toirdelbach Ua Briain's son and heir, Muirchertach. Four years later Ruaidr&iacute; was blinded by the rebellious king of west Connacht, Ua Flaithbertaig, and in 1093 Muirchertach Ua Briain temporarily banished the whole Ua Conchobair family into T&iacute;r Eoghain, and installed in their patrimony a puppet-king from south Connacht, Gilla na n&oacute;eb Ua hEidin (<i>d</i>. 1100). The Ua Conchobair dynasty fought back, challenged not only by Ua Flaithbertaig, but by the Ua Ruairc king of east Connacht or Br&eacute;ifne, who also aspired to kingship of the whole province. In 1106 Domnall son of Ruaidr&iacute; Ua Conchobair was declared to be deposed by his own subjects and his eighteen-year-old half-brother Toirdelbach was installed by Muirchertach Ua Briain, his maternal uncle, at &#145;&Aacute;th an termoinn&#146; (perhaps near Termonbarry, Roscommon) as local ruler of the Ua Conchobair homeland of S&iacute;l Muiredaig (approximately what is now co. Roscommon and north-east co. Galway). The same year Muirchertach Ua Briain forcibly installed into the kingship of neighbouring Meath Murchad Ua M&aacute;elsechlainn, the father of &Oacute;rlaith (<i>d</i>. 1115) and Tailtiu (<i>d</i>. 1127/1129), two early wives among the many, named and unnamed, of Toirdelbach Ua Conchobair.<br>
<br>In his first recorded campaigns as king of the S&iacute;l Muiredaig against Ua Fergail of Conmaicne (modern co. Longford) in 1110 and against Termonn Da Beo&oacute;c (St Patrick's Purgatory) and Lough Erne in 1111, Toirdelbach Ua Conchobair appears aligned with his maternal uncle, Ua Briain, and his father-in-law, Ua Maelsechlainn, against Ua Ruairc of Br&eacute;ifne and Domnall Mac Lochlainn, overlord of the north of Ireland, who inflicted a great raid on Connacht in 1110. However, in 1114 the high-king, Muirchertach Ua Briain, fell sick, and Toirdelbach, together with Murchad Ua Maelsechlainn, changed allegiance to Domnall Mac Lochlainn and joined him in an invasion of the Ua Briain homeland as far as Tulla, Clare, where Toirdelbach was instrumental in arranging a year's peace between Muirchertach's usurping brother, Diarmait Ua Briain, and the northern army. Subsequently the partially cured Muirchertach attempted to recover power by invading Leinster and Meath, while Ua Conchobair had to overcome a rebellion in Connacht led by his brother Domnall with Ua Fergail and Ua Briain support. No sooner was his brother captured than Toirdelbach himself was laid low for some time by an assassination attempt in west Connacht at &Aacute;th B&oacute;, near Tuam. Yet this widespread opposition in itself marks the extension of Toirdelbach's rule from his family homeland of S&iacute;l Muiredaig to the whole province of Connacht. Before the end of 1115 he had delivered punishing raids against the Ua Briain territory of Thomond or north Munster, ravaged the Ua Fergail land of Conmaicne and the western part of Meath using a fleet on the River Shannon, and pressurized Murchad Ua Maelsechlainn into submission. At the close of this campaign he fasted at the church of Clonmacnoise and presented the community with a gilded drinking horn, a silver chalice, and a gilded copper paten.<br>
<br>Continuing Ua Briain dynastic strife allowed Toirdelbach Ua Conchobair to invade Thomond and destroy the palace of Kincora in 1116 (releasing all prisoners taken on the campaign in honour of St Flann&aacute;n, patron saint of Killaloe). On the death of Diarmait Ua Briain, acting king of Munster, in 1118, Toirdelbach led the armies of Connacht, Br&eacute;ifne, and Meath southwards as far as Glanmire, Cork, ostensibly to restore Muirchertach Ua Briain to power. Instead he concluded a treaty with Tadc Mac Carthaig to divide the province, allotting Desmond or south Munster to Mac Carthaig and Thomond to the sons of Diarmait Ua Briain. Subsequently Ua Conchobair joined Murchad Ua Maelsechlainn in subduing the province of Leinster and the Ostman kingdom of Dublin; and in 1119 he used the forces of Leinster to complete the subjugation of Munster, Muirchertach Ua Briain having finally died after five years of illness. This death revived Domnall Mac Lochlainn's claims to high-kingship, supported by Murchad Ua Maelsechlainn, king of Meath. In 1120 Ua Conchobair's initial attacks on Ua Maelsechlainn were halted by Mac Lochlainn's entry into Meath with an army, and Toirdelbach came to terms. Later in the year he built two bridges across the Shannon and one over the River Suck to facilitate raids from Connacht into Meath. He expelled Ua Maelsechlainn to the north, then celebrated the fair of Tailtiu, an obsolete ceremonial assembly traditionally associated with the high-kingship of Ireland.<br>
<br>Ua Conchobair's overlordship had to be strenuously maintained. In 1121 he invaded Munster to reimpose his settlement, causing &#145;the people of Munster to cry aloud&#146;  (<span class="italic">Annals of Tigernach</span>, 42), even plundering the reformed monastery of Lismore. Next year &Eacute;nna Mac Murchada, king of Leinster, submitted. In 1123 Toirdelbach took hostages from the new king of Desmond, Cormac Mac Carthaig, but remained threatened until this king's death in 1138 by Mac Carthaig's persistent ambition to unite all Munster under his rule and exercise overlordship in Osraige and Leinster. Ua Conchobair responded to a revolt in 1124 by Ua Maelsechlainn, Mac Murchada, Mac Carthaig, and Tigern&aacute;n Ua Ruairc, the new king of Br&eacute;ifne, by ravaging Meath, killing Mac Carthaig's hostages, and building three &#145;castles&#146; in Connacht, at Dunlo (near Ballinasloe), at Galway, and at Collooney in Sligo. Public works were a feature of Ua Conchobair's reign, including, in 1129, a canal cut to drain the River Suck. Another characteristic was the division of subject territories and the imposition of nominated kings. In 1125 he joined with Ua Ruairc to banish Ua Maelsechlainn and divide the kingdom of Meath into three. Following the death of &Eacute;nna Mac Murchada in 1126, he appointed his own son Conchobar Ua Conchobair king over Dublin and Leinster. When Leinster revolted the next year, Toirdelbach imposed another king of his choice there. However, in 1131 Cormac Mac Carthaig made a joint attack on Connacht with Conchobar Mac Lochlainn (<i>d</i>. 1136), king of the north, and although Ua Conchobair repelled them, his power was effectively reduced to his own province for some years. His own son Conchobar Ua Conchobair, as king of S&iacute;l Muiredaig, and his vassal Ua Cellaig actually submitted to Murchad Ua Maelsechlainn, king of Meath, in 1135. By 1138 Toirdelbach recovered somewhat, invading Meath again in alliance with Ua Ruairc and Donnchad Ua Cearbaill, king of Airgialla. In 1140 he erected bridges across the Shannon at Athlone and Lanesborough; and the next year Murchad Ua Maelsechlainn renewed his submission. Then in 1143 Ua Conchobair arrested Ua Maelsechlainn, apparently for collaboration with Munster, and imposed his own son Conchobar Ua Conchobar as king over Meath. Six months later Conchobar was assassinated by a Meath chieftain, whereupon Toirdelbach, after a battle &#145;like the Day of Judgement&#146;, exacted a fine of 400 cows and divided Meath at first between Ua Ruairc, Diarmait Mac Murchada, and an Ua Maelsechlainn prince, then between Murchad Ua Maelsechlainn and a kinsman.<br>
<br>Toirdelbach Ua Conchobair's relations with his other sons seem less affectionate. He allowed Conchobar to blind another son, &Aacute;ed (whose mother was Derbforgaill (<i>d</i>. 1151), daughter of Domnall Mac Lochlainn), and he imprisoned his eventual heir, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20522/', "Ruaidr&#237; Ua Conchobair")</script>, in 1136 and again in 1143, though forced to release him by the lay and clerical guarantors of the prince's original safe conduct. This was not the only occasion Ua Conchobair responded to clerical influence. He granted a great tribute to a relic of the Holy Cross brought to Ireland in 1123, and enshrined a portion at Roscommon; he ordered the construction of the Cross of Cong to house the same, or a similar relic; he endowed and walled the ecclesiastical settlement of Tuam in 1127 and hosted a metropolitan visitation of Connacht by the reformed archbishop of Armagh, Gelasius, in 1140 and again in 1151; and in his will he left 160 ounces of gold, 60 marks of silver, and all his moveable property, except weapons and drinking-horns, to various churches. The last years of Toirdelbach's life were made eventful by the rise of Muirchertach (<i>d</i>. 1166), grandson of Domnall Mac Lochlainn, to rule the north and claim high-kingship of Ireland from <i>c</i>.1149. In 1150 Ua Conchobair yielded hostages to Mac Lochlainn, receiving in exchange a portion of Meath. He immediately commenced a war of conquest against Toirdelbach Ua Briain (<i>d</i>. 1167) culminating in a victory at M&oacute;in M&oacute;r (1152), followed by Ua Conchobair's redivision of Munster in 1153 between Mac Carthaig and Ua Briain kings, before Muirchertach Mac Lochlainn intervened to force the restoration of Toirdelbach Ua Briain. An inconclusive war broke out in 1154 between Mac Lochlainn and Toirdelbach Ua Conchobair, now ably assisted by his son Ruaidr&iacute;. The rivalry was settled in Mac Lochlainn's favour by the death of Toirdelbach in 1156 at the age of sixty-eight. He was buried at Clonmacnoise, and his son Ruaidr&iacute; succeeded him as king of Connacht, and after 1166 as high-king, though another son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20513/', "Cathal Croibhdhearg &#211; Conchobhair")</script>, became ancestor of the main &Oacute; Conchobair line in post-Norman times.<br>
