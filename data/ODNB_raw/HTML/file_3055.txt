<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Bowes, Sir  Martin</span>  (1496/7&#150;1566), <span class="occ">goldsmith and mayor of London</span>, was born in York in the parish of St Cuthbert, Peaseholme. Despite his disclaimer in 1549 that at the time of his going thirty-eight years previously to London at the age of fourteen  (HoP, <span class="italic">Commons, 1509&#150;58</span>, 1.469) he had been of &#145;small substance&#146;  (Raine, 5.19&#150;20), he came in fact from a family of some prominence, his great-grandfather having been mayor and his grandfather sheriff of York. His father was probably Thomas Bowes, goldsmith, who became free of the city in 1498 and who seems likely to have been related to the man of the same name, who also originated from St Cuthbert's and who went on to pursue an active career at the mint, serving between 1468 and 1476 as attorney to Warden John Wode and then from 1476 until his death on 14 September 1479 as joint warden.<br>
<br>In 1513 Bowes was apprenticed to the prominent London goldsmith Robert Amadas, court supplier and future master of the jewels, under whom he learned the assaying skills that were to be the mainspring of his highly successful career. Made free in 1521 and a liveryman of the Goldsmiths' Company in 1525, he went on to become not just remarkable in his own generation, but perhaps the most remarkable member of the company in the entire Tudor period. Having served as fourth warden in 1532&#150;3, third warden in 1534&#150;5, and second warden in 1535&#150;6 he was elected prime warden on 17 September 1537. Chosen twice more during the years 1540&#150;42, he subsequently occupied the position on no fewer than ten further occasions&#151;1549&#150;51, 1553&#150;7, 1558&#150;62&#151;and by so doing achieved almost uninterrupted control. Even after he had lain down office for the last time, in 1562, Bowes's influence remained undiminished for, time and again, decisions were taken by his successors only after his wishes had first been ascertained.<br>
<br>Closely allied with his Goldsmiths' connection was Bowes's link with the mint, which also began with Amadas&#151;this time through Amadas's being with Ralph Rowlett, deputy to Master Worker William Blount, Lord Mountjoy. Bowes was Amadas's deputy by 1526 and grew so quickly in importance that when, in 1530, Mountjoy called his deputies to account Bowes was accused with them of defrauding him of his rightful profits. Despite their protestations of innocence the deputies were replaced by Hugh Welshe, also a goldsmith, and it was not until his death in 1532, the year in which Amadas also died, that Bowes and Rowlett had the opportunity of returning to the mint. By offering a chain of gold worth &pound;30 to Cromwell to assist their cause and paying dearly for Mountjoy's agreement to surrender his patent, they achieved their end, being appointed joint master workers in April 1533. Surviving an adverse inquiry into mint operations in 1534, Rowlett continued in office until his death in March 1543 and Bowes until the reorganization of the mint in 1544. On 3 June he was appointed under-treasurer of the principal mint in the Tower and remained in control of this, the most important of all the eight mints operating during the debasement of the coinage, until September 1550 when he was pensioned at 200 marks. As a commission of inquiry set up on 3 February 1550 revealed, his stewardship of the mint had left much to be desired. All in all, by virtue of arrears on his accounts, profits arising on bullion provisioning, making coin worse than standard, and profiting from moneys that had not been paid over as promptly as they should have been, Sir Martin was found to be in debt to the tune of &pound;29,762. It is a measure, first, of his massive liquidity that he was able in a matter of months to pay off &pound;22,762 of this and, second, of his standing that he could find sureties for the repayment of the remaining &pound;7000 over the next ten years. In the event, &pound;2000 was remitted by the crown in order to secure more prompt repayment of the rest.<br>
<br>In this year, 1554, Bowes married Elizabeth, daughter of Thomas Harlow and widow of William Billingsley of London. By this and two earlier marriages&#151;(by 1526) to Cecily Eliott and (by 1538) to Anne (<i>d</i>. 1553), daughter of John Barrett of Belhus in Aveley, Essex&#151;he had eighteen children, two of whom, Thomas, the eldest son (<i>d</i>. 1591), and Martin, the second son (<i>d</i>. 1573), served under him at the mint, the first as teller (1545&#150;50), the second as surveyor of the meltings (1547&#150;51). Thomas married Cecily, widow of Thomas Haynes, overseas factor to Sir William Bowyer and merchant adventurer of London, while Martin took as his first wife Frances Scrope, the granddaughter and heir of Robert Amadas. Although both sons were free of the Goldsmiths' Company neither practised the craft, preferring instead to make their way in London as merchants. In his will of 1565 Sir Martin divided his possessions in three, according to the custom of London: one part going to his wife, Elizabeth, one part to William and Charity his orphans (both minors), and one part for the performance of his legacies. Martin inherited Sir Martin's mansion house in Lombard Street and half his household goods in London, the other half going to Dame Elizabeth as part of her portion. After appraisal all Sir Martin's household goods at Woolwich, North Cray, Kent, and Mile End were to pass to William and Charity as part of their legacy. Thomas enjoyed the cancellation of all the debts he owed his father, a blessing indeed, because, as Sir Martin opined, he had cost him &#145;four times more than ever his part should come to&#146;  (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/49). By an earlier will of 1562 Sir Martin had defined his legacy to his company as tenements in Lombard Street, Scalding Alley, St Matthew's Alley, and St Botolph without Bishopgate besides a great messuage and twenty-two gardens in the same parish.<br>
<br>During the time when he controlled and benefited from the mint Bowes cut an impressive figure in the city. A commoner in the ward of Langbourn, then alderman from 1536 until his death, he was auditor in 1536, sheriff in 1540&#150;41, the year in which he was knighted, and mayor in 1545&#150;6. In this capacity he participated in the trial of the heretic Anne Askew. In 1547, due partly to the wardens' urging the livery &#145;by all means to give their whole election&#146;  (HoP, <span class="italic">Commons, 1509&#150;58</span>, 1.470) to him, he was returned as MP for London. According to the limited surviving evidence Bowes was supportive in this, and in the further five parliaments in which he represented London, of the interests of York and, especially, London. Outside parliament the same was true. In 1549 he remembered his northern origins by presenting York with &#145;a fair sword with a sheath of crimson velvet garnished with pearl and stone set upon silver and gilt&#146;  (Raine, 5.20). And it was in the parish of St Cuthbert that, in 1557, he proposed to establish a chantry, possibly an indication of his attachment to the old religion. When, at the accession of Elizabeth, Catholicism was once again eclipsed, his endowment was transferred to poor relief. As far as the metropolis was concerned, Bowes showed similar generosity, presenting in 1558 a jewel of gold embellished with pearls and stones to hang from the mayor's collar. He had similar sympathy for London's poor, endowing five almshouses at Woolwich and playing the key role in the establishment of five hospitals&#151;St Bartholomew's, St Thomas's, Bethlem, Bridewell, and Christ's&#151;of which he became comptroller-general when the scheme was finalized in 1557.<br>
<br>Rich and influential, Bowes was also active in government outside his company and the city. Between 1538 and his death he served on a variety of commissions but made his most continuous contribution as a JP for Kent and Middlesex. Bowes died on 4 August 1566, and was buried in St Mary Woolnoth, Lombard Street.<br>
