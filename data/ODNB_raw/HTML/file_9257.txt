<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Fell,  John</span>  (1625&#150;1686), <span class="occ">bishop of Oxford</span>, was born at Longworth, Berkshire, on 23 June 1625, the eldest son among at least eight children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9261/', "Samuel Fell (bap. 1584, d. 1649)")</script>, then rector of Longworth, and his wife, Margaret (<i>d</i>. 1653), daughter of Thomas Wylde of the Commandery, Worcester, and niece of Sir Robert Berkley of Spechley. After education at Lord Williams's School, Thame, Oxfordshire, on 25 May 1637, aged only eleven, he became a student at Christ Church, Oxford; the college was to be the centre of his life. His father, by this time Lady Margaret professor of divinity in the university, was installed as dean of Christ Church on 28 June 1638. John graduated BA on 24 October 1640, the same day as his older contemporary Richard Allestree, one of his two closest lifelong friends; the other, John Dolben, was elected a student of the college that year.<h2>
<a name="Civilwarandinterregnum"></a>Civil war and interregnum</h2>Following the outbreak of the civil war the king established his headquarters at Christ Church and his residence at the deanery lodgings. Most junior members of the college, including Fell, joined the royalist army, but unlike his two friends there is no evidence that he served outside Oxford. With Allestree he proceeded MA on 2 June 1643. Looking back on this period later, he recalled a distinguished gathering of talent, owing to the peculiar circumstances of war. &#145;Oxford was then the common refuge and shelter of such persecuted persons, so that it never was nor is like to become a more Learned University &hellip; nor did ever Letters and Arms so well consist together, it being an accomplisht Academy of Both&#146;  (J. Fell, <span class="italic">The Life of &hellip; Dr Thomas Fuller</span>, 1661, 22). One notable visitor in 1643 and 1644 was the church historian Thomas Fuller; often resident from the spring of 1645 was the controversialist Henry Hammond, preferred by the king to a canonry at Christ Church.<br>
<br>Although the city fell to parliament in 1646, in the next year Fell and Allestree obtained episcopal ordination, perhaps at the hands of their own bishop, Robert Skinner. However, with the arrival in September 1647 of the parliamentary visitors to the university, first Samuel Fell (the current vice-chancellor) and then Hammond (now sub-dean) were imprisoned and deprived. On 12 April 1648 Margaret Fell and her younger children were forcibly removed from the deanery and retired to Samuel's rectory at Sunningwell, Berkshire. With Allestree and Dolben, John appeared before the visitors on 3 May but, having refused to submit to their authority, was expelled from his place at the college on 15 May. Fell's bitterness at these events was as sharp in 1684, when he recounted Allestree's life, as it was in 1661, when he recalled Hammond's. Perpetrators of &#145;the long-expected Ruine&#146;, the visitors arrived &#145;with hunters Stomacks, and design for to boot, for to seize first and then devour the prey, by a new method of Judicature being to kill and then take possession&#146;  (J. Fell, <span class="italic">The Life of &hellip; Dr H. Hammond</span>, 1661, 50). Those who would not &#145;comply with the lust of these Usurpers&#146; were &#145;banisht from the University, and requir'd to depart the precincts thereof within three daies, upon pain of being taken for spies of war&#146;. By this means &#145;the men of greatest hopes and merit in the University were spoil'd of all things&#146; and were replaced by &#145;an illiterate rabble, swept up from the plough tail, from shops and grammar scholes, and the dregs of the neighbor University&#146;  (R. Allestree, <span class="italic">Forty Sermons</span>, 1684, sig. b).<br>
<br>The memory of disaster and persecution which so coloured Fell's later writing and shaped his attitudes is somewhat undermined by his actual experiences over the next decade. In spite of official banishment, he seems to have spent most if not all that time in Oxford, where he lived within a stone's throw of Christ Church, kept contact with his circle of like-minded friends such as Hammond and Gilbert Sheldon, the ejected warden of All Souls, and ministered to a sizeable congregation according to the proscribed liturgy. In the early 1650s he was taking services in the rooms of a college contemporary, the physician <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29587/', "Thomas Willis")</script>, with what can only have been the connivance of John Owen, his father's successor as dean and vice-chancellor. According to one participant, Leoline Jenkins, the future secretary of state, attendance approached 300, although space makes this implausible. When in 1657 Willis bought Beam Hall in nearby Merton Street, Fell and his &#145;underground&#146; church moved in with him. On 17 April that year Willis married Fell's sister Mary, with Allestree and Dolben conducting the ceremony with prayer book rites.<br>
<br>The &#145;Anglican&#146; cell had a political dimension. While Dolben, who in that year married Sheldon's niece Catherine, settled in St Aldates, Oxford, and joined Fell's ministry, Allestree, a royalist agent, channelled funds and information to Charles's court in exile. There Sheldon's friend George Morley, another ejected canon of Christ Church, was the king's chaplain. Fell's church nurtured the clergymen who were by 1659 pencilled in to form the nucleus of a restored church hierarchy and who were poised to effect it by propaganda. One member, the recently ordained Robert South, who was significantly still a member of Christ Church, preached at the university church on 24 July, inveighing against the harmful effects of fanaticism on scholarship and religion. The same month Fell issued anonymously <span class="italic">The Interest of England Stated</span>. All parties currently contending for power might seek to impose their will against the public interest, but none was likely to succeed fully. Even &#145;the Royalist pretension of having the K[ing] an absolute Conqueror&#146; which might &#145;destroy the interest of all parties that have appeared against him or his Father &hellip; infringe the liberties of English Subjects in general&#146;, and set &#145;up the primitive Government of the Church, at least in its full height&#146; would probably falter if imposed by violence in the face of &#145;so great a multitude of eager dissenters&#146;  (p. 5). Since none could win, the only &#145;Expedient&#146; which would &#145;satisfy the reall Interest of every party&#146; was to call back the king anyway. All other forms of government had failed; only monarchy could provide the legal framework necessary for settlement. The king in question, moreover, had not only hereditary right and an identity of interest with that of the nation, but was also peculiarly well qualified because of his experience abroad, his maturity, his marriageability, and his &#145;infinite sweetness of temper&#146;  (p. 9). Since the choice was &#145;Anarchy or his restitution&#146;, all parties actively desired the latter; an honest and loving king would, in the tradition of his grandfather, Henri IV of France, bring forgiveness and healing.<h2>
<a name="Restoration"></a>Restoration</h2>In the run-up to the April 1660 election to the Convention Parliament, Fell and his congregation openly canvassed for the royalist interest, and he signed the &#145;declaration&#146; of Oxfordshire notables issued on 28 April which called for the king's return but denied all intention of revenge. He was already a canon-designate in the new order projected at Christ Church under Morley's deanship, but in the interval before the arrival on 23 July of the royal commissioners to impose it Hammond died. It was for his prebend that Fell petitioned that month and to which he was presented by the king on 9 July. Dolben and Allestree became fellow canons on 27 July. It was a measure of the importance for the new regime of the Christ Church connection that these &#145;posts were among the very first dignitaries of the Church of England to be filled at the Restoration&#146;  (<span class="italic">Hist. U. Oxf.</span> 4: <span class="italic">17th-cent. Oxf.</span>, 822). In the subsequent distribution of rewards the Fell circle featured prominently. Fell was installed as a canon of Selsey in Chichester on 18 August (although he resigned it by 26 January 1662). He, Allestree, and Dolben were created doctors of divinity on 3 October. Four of Fell's brothers-in-law were also honoured that autumn: Willis became doctor of medicine and Sedleian professor of natural philosophy; Walter Jones, another Christ Church man and husband of Philippa, proceeded DD and gained prebends at Westminster and St Paul's; Thomas Washbourne, husband of Dorothy, proceeded DD and became prebendary of Gloucester; George Benson, husband of Katherine, became canon and archdeacon of Hereford. With Morley away in London and Allestree his official substitute, the &#145;valiant triumvirate&#146;  (ibid., 823) ruled Christ Church, reintroducing the prayer book and instituting monthly communion in the cathedral. By 30 November, when following Morley's promotion to the bishopric of Worcester Fell, at only thirty-five, was made dean, the whole panoply of cathedral music and ceremonial was returning.<br>
<br>The following year Fell published an edition of Suetonius and two works offering a cavalier Anglican perspective on the civil wars and interregnum and his blueprint for ensuring they would never be repeated. <span class="italic">The Life of the most Learned, Reverend and Pious Dr H. Hammond</span> (1661), revealed Hammond's heroic efforts to sustain prayer book episcopalianism through the dark and dangerous days of conflict and the rule of &#145;a bloody <span class="smallcap">TYRANT</span>&#146;  (p. 66). His virtues were almost inimitable, but Fell held up his example to shame the reader into charity, meekness, reasonableness, and loyalty, and to challenge him into regular pious observance. Motivation behind <span class="italic">The Life of &hellip; Dr Thomas Fuller</span> (1661) was perhaps more complex. Nephew of John Davenant, Fuller shared the bishop's reservations about the Laudian innovations of the 1630s and his strong anti-Catholicism. In the 1640s he favoured &#145;the blessings of an accommodation&#146;  (p. 23) and defended tithes, infant baptism, and a learned ministry. In appropriating the &#145;godly life&#146; of a divine who from another pen might have appeared as a moderate puritan, Fell secured for his own &#145;Anglican&#146; faction the first protestant historian of British Christianity and of precedents for ecclesiastical reconstruction. Fuller &#145;ceased not to assert the purity of the Church of England&#146;  (p. 37) and &#145;was wont to call those controversies concerning Episcopacy, and the newly invented Arguments&#146; against the church &#145;things of a daies life and no permanency; the Church being built upon a Rock&#146;  (pp. 86&#150;7).<h2>
<a name="Deanandvicechancellor"></a>Dean and vice-chancellor</h2>At Christ Church the co-operation of Fell, Dolben (as sub-dean), and Allestree (as treasurer), commemorated in a triple portrait still hanging there, ensured its establishment as a nursery of Anglican loyalism. Fell's brother Robert and at least four of his nephews joined sons of the nobility and upper gentry. With the deliberate intention of grooming them for service in church, state, and locality, Fell built on the college tradition of admitting a disproportionate number of &eacute;lite students. Although their graduation rate was comparatively low, he imposed high standards of discipline through close pastoral supervision and strict regulation of college ceremonies and servants, and expected diligent attendance at prayers. His care for the morals, spiritual development, health, and academic progress of &#145;our little men&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 29582, fol. 13) was noted by contemporaries and pervades his letters to the Southwells and Hattons, for example. Some former students, like John Luke who in 1664 remembered &#145;yor most happy government&#146;  (BL, Sloane MS 3509, fol. 66), expressed their gratitude; some, like Richard Newdigate, kept in correspondence years after leaving the college and continued to receive paternal advice. Some prot&eacute;g&eacute;s, like South and William Jane, doctrinal Calvinists firmly attached to the liturgy of the Church of England, duly progressed to positions in the divinity faculty from which they disseminated the anti-Roman but scholarly Anglicanism of the next generation.<br>
<br>Wealthy students and ex-students, fund-raising friends like John Evelyn, Fell's own businesslike management, and occasional eminent visitors (like the king in 1663 and 1665, the prince of Orange, and the marquess d'Olivola) enabled and encouraged building projects. Subscriptions paid for the completion of a range begun by Fell's father: the north side of Cardinal Wolsey's original quadrangle, and its subsequent embellishment with an Italian balustrade and a broad terrace round the sides. Following a destructive fire in 1669 new canons' lodgings and adjoining buildings were erected round the &#145;chaplains&#146; quadrangle; &#145;Fell's buildings&#146; survived to 1863. Further works culminated in Sir Christopher Wren's Gateway Tower, the western exit to St Aldates, completed in 1682. The bell Great Tom was recast in the following year and first rang from its new position on 29 May 1684, the anniversary of the Restoration.<br>
<br>The ascendancy achieved in Restoration Oxford by Fell, Allestree (from 1663 regius professor of divinity), and Dolben (before ecclesiastical promotion removed him) was sealed in August 1666 when Fell became vice-chancellor of the university. He remained in office for three years. Although the appointment was ringingly endorsed by the chancellor, Archbishop Sheldon, and Bishop Morley's friend Edward Hyde, earl of Clarendon, others like John Aubrey and Anthony Wood considered the monopoly of power by Christ Church as rigid, unwelcome, and inappropriate. To Fell's existing ambition to rule the entire university was united the particular aim of those who had suffered during the interregnum &#145;to reduce the university to that manner and form, as to preaching, disputing, discipline, opinion &amp;c as 'twas when Dr Laud was chancellor&#146;. Twenty years on, however, &#145;a most strange liberty, loosness in manners and religion had taken place&#146; and the aim seemed unattainable and &#145;ridiculous&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 4.196). Certainly Fell moved swiftly to reintroduce the policies of Archbishop William Laud's chancellorship. Within a few days he had issued as <span class="italic">Cum de vestitu et habitu scholastico</span> regulations for academic dress and &#145;with characteristic efficiency&#146; had done his best to ensure their enforceability by commanding Oxford tailors, under penalty of fine or withdrawal of custom, to cut their cloth according to his printed specifications. &#145;For Fell as for Laud&#146;, clothing appropriate to social rank and academic standing &#145;was the mark of belonging to a well-ordered and disciplined society&#146;  (<span class="italic">Hist. U. Oxf.</span> 4: <span class="italic">17th-cent. Oxf.</span>, 842). Another plank of Laudian order was put in place in December when Fell and Sheldon licensed the publication in Oxford of the late archbishop's collection of private prayers, <span class="italic">A Summarie of Devotion</span> (1667). Meanwhile, on 25 January 1667, in contravention of the declarations of April 1660 and of the Convention Parliament, which eschewed or prohibited the cancellation of university enactments between 1648 and 1660, its ruling body, convocation, formally condemned all transactions during that period of &#145;usurpation&#146; and &#145;pretended jurisdictions&#146;.<br>
<br>With puritanical zeal as marked as that of any of the parliamentary visitors he so deplored, Fell addressed all manifestations of disorder. From the Lenten disputations of 1667, &#145;coursing&#146;, during which exchanges between participants tended to degenerate into violence, was curbed. As Wood saw it, the rigour of debate was thereby significantly undermined, although he also depicted Fell as a conscientious supervisor of lectures and examinations. While a promoter of the traditional proctorial system and (sometimes contradictorily) of collegiate independence where it concerned Christ Church, Fell was not prone to over-delegate and he personally engaged in disciplinary procedures. As in regulating alehouses to decrease drunkenness, he struck at the root of the problem.<br>
<br>Fell's reign was the more effective for congenial chancellors. With characteristic speed and calculation, following Clarendon's fall from political power and resignation on 7 December 1667, on 20 December Fell secured the election of Sheldon as his successor. While the archbishop's own political eclipse, his age, and other preoccupations led him to refuse the position, two years of unofficial partnership were productive. Concerned to keep space for religious worship separate from secular university ceremonial, hitherto held in the university church of St Mary's, Fell was in conception and execution the driving force behind Sheldon's promotion of a designated building next to the Bodleian Library. The Sheldonian Theatre, Wren's most impressive and ingenious creation in Oxford, with its allegorical ceiling by Robert Streater asserting the triumph of scholarship over disorder, was officially opened on 9 July 1669 as the university's &#145;great hall&#146;. On 31 July Sheldon recommended to the university as a prospective chancellor James Butler, duke of Ormond. The duke's widely acknowledged integrity, exemplary personal life, proven loyalty to the crown, but aloofness from the more sordid aspects of Charles II's court ensured a fruitful working relationship with Fell and the university after his election on 4 August; its success was acknowledged a decade later when he confided his grandson Lord James Butler to Fell's care at Christ Church.<br>
<br>As vice-chancellor Fell was especially well placed to advance what was to be his greatest and most lasting achievement, the realization of Laud's dream of a securely based and internationally renowned scholarly press. Since the Restoration he had been at the forefront of the university's battle with the London Stationers and the king's printers over the privilege of printing bibles and prayer books, and in 1667 he had established a type foundry in Oxford. In 1669 he persuaded Sheldon to take the critical step of permitting the Sheldonian to be used as a printing house; an imprint depicting the theatre was still employed when the press moved to purpose-built premises after Fell's death. In partnership with Leoline Jenkins, now principal of Jesus College, Thomas Yate, principal of Brasenose, and secretary of state Sir Joseph Williamson, Fell obtained a lease for the university press, running from Lady day 1672. By this time, with Sheldon's consent, the enterprise was already well under way, underwritten by about &pound;400 from the consortium's own resources. Fell's programme of publication was over-ambitious given the finance available, and was dogged by marketing problems, but his achievement was none the less impressive. He primed the pump with his own edition of Clement (1669), works on philosophy (1671), and music (1672), and with a basic grammar (1673). His &#145;new year books&#146;, an annual challenge to Christ Church students to edit classical texts, produced, for example, translations of Theocritus (1676) and Epictetus (1680). He commissioned the distinguished orientalist Edward Pococke to write on the minor prophets, obtained the printing and publishing rights of the immensely popular <span class="italic">The Whole Duty of Man</span>, supervised the translation into Latin of Wood's history of the university and printed it at his own charge (although not to Wood's satisfaction), and through persistence secured the rights to print bibles. His correspondence, full of press business, testifies to the many collaborative projects he encouraged, from a Welsh prayer book and catechisms (with his nephew-in-law William Lloyd, bishop of St Asaph), to the Saxon chronicle (with William Nicholson). Landmark publications included Robert Morison's <span class="italic">Plantae umbelliferae</span> (1672&#150;99), Robert Plot's <span class="italic">Natural History of Oxfordshire</span> (1677), and John Loggin's <span class="italic">Oxonia illustrata</span> (1674). These were beautifully produced, and all benefited from Fell's importation, above all through his agent Thomas Marshall of Lincoln College (also an Anglo-Saxonist), of a high-quality range of roman, italic, and Greek types. Bequeathed to Oxford University Press, these still survive; although their use rapidly decreased in the later eighteenth century, they were revived in 1864 and employed in special publications in the twentieth century.<br>
<br>Fell's publishing work and his scholarship underpinned his continuing influence in the university after the years of his vice-chancellorship. Although his concern for the position of the church led him to have reservations about the new science and objections to the Royal Society, he supported scientific study at Oxford. By 1677 he had encouraged Elias Ashmole to leave his manuscripts and curiosities to the university and he was involved in negotiations to add the Arundel marbles to the Ashmolean collection.<h2>
<a name="BishopofOxford"></a>Bishop of Oxford</h2>Fell's ascendancy was gilded and extended when on 8 January 1676, through the influence of Sheldon, he was elected bishop of Oxford. Consecrated in London at the chapel of Winchester House in Chelsea on 6 February, he was uniquely permitted to hold the bishopric and the deanery <i>in commendam</i>. The rationale was the poverty of the see, but Fell's dual role was one of several contradictions in the career of this meritocratic enemy of pluralism, simony, and nonconformity: the Restoration church was full of his friends, kin, and former students, he favoured Christ Church men, and he was personally a puritan.<br>
<br>Fell's commitment to his episcopal role was unequivocal, however, and his tenure, relatively long for bishops of Oxford, was important for the church and university at a time of crisis. He repaired the palace at Cuddesdon, damaged during the civil war. His diligence is attested by his visitation articles of 1676, 1679, and 1682, and by his manuscript diocese book, containing a systematic review of the parishes within each deanery, their incumbents, and sometimes their patrons and the value of the living. His correspondence reveals his preoccupations. &#145;Pluralities&#146; were &#145;mischief in the church&#146;  (Bodl. Oxf., Tanner MS 37, fol. 69), which &#145;if not stopt, will go far forward toward the ruining of the church&#146;  (Bodl. Oxf., Tanner MS 32, fol. 159). Should one Mr Elsing obtain the Berkshire living he desired, Fell requested Archbishop William Sancroft that Elsing might resign the existing living &#145;belonging to us&#146; so that he would not &#145;neglect both&#146;  (Bodl. Oxf., Tanner MS 33, fol. 25). In 1670 Fell had revealed to Newdigate his opposition to lay purchase of former church lands and he was keen to gather patronage in clerical hands. &#145;In an age where nothing is so prostituted &amp; marketable ware, as the presentation to livings, it is a worthy charity to rescue the advowsons from the possibility of simoniacal practice, and the patrons from the guilt of it&#146;  (Warks. CRO, CR136, B401). None the less, the stern pastor was agreeably surprised when lay patrons did consult him over presentations; he accepted the request of a &#145;destitute&#146; minister for a second cure for &#145;meer pity&#146;  (Bodl. Oxf., Tanner MS 33, fol. 19); and he showed notable patience over the scandalous behaviour of the curate of Beckley. His major concern was with active and visible dissent, but he also questioned his clergy over their parishioners' negligent attendance at church and failure to receive communion. Dissenters and backsliders were not simply to be disciplined, but also to be persuaded into conformity by their ministers' godly lives and preaching. Writing to Sancroft in 1683 and 1684 Fell identified Abingdon, &#145;a town &hellip; of considerable wealth &hellip; and no less aversion to government&#146;  (Bodl. Oxf., Tanner MS 34, fol. 112) and &#145;the disaffected town of Coventrye&#146;  (Bodl. Oxf., Tanner MS 32, fol. 175), which was not in his diocese, as places in particular need of a properly maintained ministry.<br>
<br>In Fell's last visitation in 1682 one commentator detected &#145;more than a note of disillusion&#146; in his charge to his clergy  (Clapinson, xxxiii). He had already registered his exasperation at their feeble responses to his exhortations. Diligence in offering daily prayer and office, frequent sacraments, and catechizing of youth was undermined by the people's unwillingness to attend. His efforts to encourage monthly communion and observation of the festivals of the church had found greater success among gentle and noble correspondents like the Newdigates and Hattons, whose household piety he commended. A consciousness of &#145;the vanity of temporal proceedings&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 29582, fol. 1) and &#145;the prodigality of the generality of men&#146;  (Warks. CRO, CR136, B410) led him to put more faith in private and individual morality than in public and corporate virtue.<br>
<br>Having preached with success before the king at Christ Church in 1663, Fell had become a royal chaplain. His monarchism continued unabated, but his scorn for &#145;glittering titles and empty names&#146;  (Warks. CRO, CR136, B416) and the antipathy toward aristocratic life displayed in thanking God that &#145;my Lady Hatton knows how to spend hir time without a playhouse, or Hide park, or a circle of impertinent visits&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 29582, fol. 57) cannot have made him a comfortable preacher. His court sermon <span class="italic">The Character of the Last Daies</span> (1675) had castigated the &#145;jolly men of dissolute ungodly life&#146;  (p. 23), the &#145;scoffers&#146; who denied the second coming of Christ in judgement and &#145;the expectation of future retribution&#146;  (p. 1). There had always been &#145;debaucht and dissolute persons&#146;, but never until now had they mocked so openly, &#145;with assurance and impunity&#146; and &#145;for that&#146; been &#145;esteem'd Wits and Masters of Reason&#146;  (p. 16).<h2>
<a name="Exclusionpoliticsandthefightagainstpopery"></a>Exclusion politics and the fight against popery</h2>Events in the last years of Fell's life severely threatened the world he had striven so hard to construct after the Restoration. The dissolution of the Cavalier Parliament disturbed him, and he worked hard to get reliable tories returned in the three general elections of 1679, 1680, and 1681, in particular the election of Jenkins for the university seat in 1680; in that year he was also at the centre of arrangements for housing parliament in Oxford. He was consistently active in the Lords, opposing the &#145;warm counsels&#146; of &#145;unquiet and tumultuous men&#146; who sought to exclude James, duke of York, from the succession  (BL, Add. MS 29582, fols. 1, 3). On 15 November 1680 he was one of the Lords majority who rejected the Commons' <span class="roman">Exclusion Bill</span>.<br>
<br>In <span class="italic">A Sermon Preached before the House of Peers</span> (1680), delivered on 22 December, Fell's text was <span class="roman">Matthew</span> 12: 25: &#145;every kingdom divided against it self is brought to desolation&#146;. Rebellion was &#145;the sin of witchcraft&#146;: &#145;by enchantment&#146; men &#145;disturbed their own and the public peace&#146; and forfeited &#145;all the advantages they enjoy in a setled Government&#146;  (p. 3). The &#145;mad Divisions&#146;  (p. 5) of civil war must not be repeated. Popery was &#145;made of superstition and cruelty, hypocrisy and prophaness&#146; but other sects were &#145;extremely bad&#146;  (p. 13). Comprehension and toleration would not work, a foreign alliance would only inflame the situation, and a standing army would not agree with the country's liberties. Threatened by papal tyranny, men should abandon faction and seek reconcilement. Fell's long immersion in patristic scholarship and in particular his work on a collaborative edition of the third-century Carthaginian Father Cyprian's <span class="italic">De catholicae ecclesiae unitate</span> provided an example of the imperative of unity under a bishop in time of extreme danger. The preface to his English version, <span class="italic">The Holy Martyr St Cyprian of the Unity of the Church</span> (1681) noted the parallel assault from the &#145;machinations of idolatrous Rome&#146; and the efficacy of Cyprian's exhortation to unity and obedience in public worship. It ignored any inconsistency in applying this to a protestant church.<br>
<br>Fell's stance must have seemed vindicated by the successful visit to Oxford of the duke of York and his protestant daughter Princess Anne in May 1683; like previous royal visitors they lodged at the deanery. In June, however, he was thoroughly unsettled by the discovery of the &#145;diabolical&#146; and &#145;execrable&#146; Rye House plot, and was amazed that men &#145;of birth and fortunes&#146; like the duke of Monmouth and Lord Russell should be privy to it  (BL, Add. MS 29582, fols. 19, 21). He was characteristically less surprised by the rebellion and subsequent fate of Algernon Sidney, who &#145;died with the same surliness wherewith he liv'd&#146;  (ibid., fol. 99). Personal grief intruded on 7 December, when Fell recorded the death of his sister Philippa Jones, who since her widowhood in 1672 had lived with him and &#145;freed me from all domestic cares&#146;  (ibid., fol. 97).<br>
<br>In Oxford Fell continued to tread a fine line between vehement anti-whiggery and efforts for reconciliation. Having failed to persuade James Parkinson of Lincoln of the danger of his &#145;seditious principles&#146;  (<span class="italic">Hist. U. Oxf.</span> 4: <span class="italic">17th-cent. Oxf.</span>, 899), he approved his expulsion from the university in September 1683. John Locke, who owed to Fell his appointment as a Christ Church student, lasted longer under Fell's very nose, and was expelled only in November 1684, after he had fled abroad. In that year Fell oversaw the publication of <span class="italic">The Works of the &hellip; Author of the Whole Duty of Man</span>, and Allestree's <span class="italic">Forty Sermons</span>. Prefacing the latter with a hagiographical life of his friend, who had died in 1681, Fell reiterated his message of moderation, loyalty, austerity, and duty; he suppressed the contentious facts of Allestree's Arminianism and his readiness to be selective in his dismissal of Catholic belief.<br>
<br>In the face of the duke of Monmouth's rising in the summer of 1685, Fell took the lead in organizing an armed force from among the students to defend Oxford, making use of an old friend at court, the second earl of Clarendon, to obtain equipment. When Monmouth went to his death on 5 July having refused &#145;to repent of murder, rebellion, &amp; adultery&#146;  (BL, Add MS 29582, fol. 223), Fell was profoundly shocked. But he was beset from the other side by manifestations of creeping Catholicism within the university which finally hit close to home. That summer Obadiah Walker, principal of University College and a prot&eacute;g&eacute; of Fell's in Anglo-Saxon scholarship, published a life of Christ containing doctrine on Mary and on papal authority which his colleagues found unacceptable. Jane and Fell had attempted to remove the offending passages, but Walker defiantly printed the original text. On 1 October the vice-chancellor, reportedly &#145;govern'd by Dr Fell&#146;  (<span class="italic">Hist. U. Oxf.</span> 4: <span class="italic">17th-cent. Oxf.</span>, 919) prevented the sale of Walker's books and Fell deleted the clause in his will which had given Walker printing privileges in the university.<h2>
<a name="Deathandlegacy"></a>Death and legacy</h2>By spring 1686 Fell was ailing. An &#145;inflammation&#146; in his side, similar to one which had killed his father, would not heal, and his year's lodging with Willis had undermined his trust in physicians' diagnoses  (BL, Add. MS 29582, fols. 329, 335, 358). Observers considered him worn out by his many exertions. He drew up a final copy of his will on 11 and 26 June, naming his nephews Thomas Willis and Henry Jones, and his old friend John Cross as his trustees and executors, to administer, among much else, the lease on the press. Beneficiaries included his brother William, members of Christ Church, poor Oxfordshire clergy, and the divinity school library. Jane received Allestree's papers while most of Fell's went to Jones. Fourteen women, among them the dowager countesses Lovelace and Dorchester, were given <span class="roman">bibles</span>, &#145;not knowing a better gift for a bishop to bestow nor more usefull for a Christian to receive&#146;  (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/385, fol. 278<i>v</i>). Fell died at Christ Church on 10 July and was buried on 13 July in the aisle north of the choir in Christ Church Cathedral.<br>
<br>&#145;The great loss we are like to sustain from the death of so great &amp; good a man&#146;  (Warks. CRO, CR136, B418) was keenly felt at Christ Church and other quarters in Oxford. Opinion elsewhere was divided and complex. He had many admirers and his career and correspondence reveals a large circle of friends. In contrast, John Aubrey mocked him as a &#145;ghostlike ghostly father&#146; who &#145;wore a countenance so pompous in its sanctity&#146;, a &#145;dry bone &hellip; a stalking, consecrated engine of hypocrisy&#146;  (Spurr, 222). Wood experienced what he felt was his highhandedness, but he could also appreciate his diligence, skill in mentoring students, encouragement of learning and the press, and charity. Burnet's measured verdict was that he was a man of strict life and &#145;much devotion&#146;, a scholar and a good manager, &#145;in all respects a most exemplary man, a little too heated&#146; in disputes with dissenters and in his zeal for reforming abuses, a rare and worthy, but to many unpalatable man  (Burnet, 142&#150;3). The rhyme,<blockquote>
<div>I do not love thee Dr Fell<br>
</div>
<div>The reason why I cannot tell;<br>
</div>
<div>But this I know and know full well,<br>
</div>
<div>I do not love thee Dr Fell,<br>
</div>
</blockquote>the result of a mischievous translation of a Martial epigram by a disciplined student, Thomas Brown, stuck in the popular memory longer than the preoccupations of the man to whom it refers. It seems to touch a truth about the energetic, determined, effective, partisan, and sometimes sanctimonious man who made a profound contribution to Restoration Anglicanism and who in many respects <i>was</i> Restoration Oxford.<br>
