<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Stewart,  Donald James</span>  (1920&#150;1992), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born on 17 October 1920 at 39 Newton Street, reputedly the last thatched house in Stornoway, Isle of Lewis, the son of Neil Murdo Stewart (1893&#150;1944), carter, and his wife, Jessie Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Smith (1894&#150;1958), domestic servant. Educated at the Nicholson Institute, Stornoway, on leaving school in 1936 his first job was as a junior clerk in a local solicitor's office. Two years later he joined the tweed manufacturing and marketing firm of Kenneth MacKenzie Ltd.<br>
<br>Stewart's first interest in politics was aroused by the Scottish National Party (SNP) campaign in the Western Isles during the general election of 1935, and he began to read political journals such as the left-inclined <span class="italic">Forward</span> and <span class="italic">New Leader</span>, and the nationalist <span class="italic">Scots Independent</span>. He joined the Labour Party in 1937 but ended his membership in 1939, being more in sympathy with the Independent Labour Party. On the outbreak of the Second World War he enlisted in the Royal Navy, serving as a signaller, mainly on vessels engaged on convoy duties in the western approaches sector of the Atlantic. While his ship was in harbour on the Clyde he frequented nationalist meetings in Glasgow, and in 1944 he became a member of the Scottish National Party. After returning to civilian life in 1945, he became a director with Kenneth MacKenzie and continued in that capacity until 1970. On 18 May 1955 in Stornoway he married Christina (Chrissie) Macaulay (1925&#150;1995), daughter of John Macaulay, a crofter from the Lochs district of Lewis.<br>
<br>Stewart's entry into political life came with his election to Stornoway town council in 1951. He was, at various times, bailie, dean of guild, honorary sheriff, and three times provost (1959&#150;65; 1968&#150;71) in a career of municipal service spanning twenty years. He was serving his third term as provost when he was selected as SNP candidate for the Western Isles in the general election of June 1970. He then became the first SNP candidate to win a seat in a general election; and his victory at that crucial moment preserved the threatened credibility of his party. He retained his seat until he retired at the June 1987 general election.<br>
<br>Stewart's capture and subsequent retention of the Western Isles seat depended on the esteem in which he was held locally. He served for some time as provost and MP simultaneously, an unusual arrangement which enabled him to concentrate on issues on which his professional experience made him expert, such as tweed and fishing. He also acted to oppose the imposition of British summer time in winter, and introduced, unsuccessfully, a private member's bill in an attempt to enhance the status and prospects of Gaelic. He was in all aspects a vigorous defender of the economy, society, and culture of his community, always bearing in mind, as he himself was to recall, the maxim: &#145;Remember the people you came from.&#146; At one with the convictions and principles of his people, he found himself sometimes at odds with the urban and industrialized majority. Baptized into the Free Church of Scotland, he held principles of moral austerity on such issues as abortion and the punishment of crime, but he always showed that these principles in him co-existed with a profound kindness. In keeping with the opinions of his people and, at that time, of his party, he resisted all moves towards involvement in the EEC, whose economic plans he described as &#145;taking in one another's washing machines&#146;.<br>
<br>The general election of February 1974 brought into parliament a seven-strong SNP group whose members elected Stewart their leader. In October 1974 eleven SNP MPs were elected. Stewart remained leader of the parliamentary party until his retirement, and was also president of the SNP from 1982. In 1977 he was sworn of the privy council, a recognition not only of his position but also of the respect which his work and personality had earned on all sides of the house. Assessments of his qualities always began with &#145;integrity&#146;, but in addition he was notably courteous and dignified, though relaxed and at ease in all social contexts, devoid of pomposity. His tall and strong physique and bearing were matched by a manifest strength of character sensed by all who met him. Speaking at party conferences he warmed and enthused his listeners, moved by the depth of his convictions and at times convulsed by his wit. He could persuade them to follow his lead even in directions which they might not have chosen, as for instance when he persuaded his colleagues to cease holding conference sessions on Sundays. He was no caricature Sabbatarian. As his old friend Robert McIntyre was to say, &#145;Donald was a rock that laughed&#146;  (<span class="italic">Scots Independent</span>, October 1992).<br>
<br>On his retirement in 1987 Stewart and his wife (who had been a steadfast supporter throughout his political career) were jointly honoured with the freedom of the Western Isles. He died on 23 August 1992 at the Lewis Hospital, Stornoway, following a heart attack, and was deeply mourned by his constituents and his colleagues. He was buried at Sandwick cemetery, Stornoway, on 26 August, following a funeral service at Stornoway Free Church.<br>
