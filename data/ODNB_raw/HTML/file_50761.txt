<span class="headword">Soskice <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>Soskis]</span>,  David Vladimirovich</span>  (1866&#150;1941), <span class="occ">journalist and campaigner for freedom in Russia</span>, was born on 27 March 1866 in Berdichev, near Kiev in Ukraine, the son of Wolf Soskis, merchant, and his wife, Bassia Liuba Soskis (1844&#150;1923). His parents were Jewish but he did not follow their religious faith. He first encountered tsarist oppression at school in Kiev in 1880: &#145;in the gymnasium I heard of three young students being hanged for distributing socialist literature &hellip; [then] considered myself a socialist&#151;or a revolutionist, which is the same thing&#146;. In 1881 he witnessed an anti-Jewish pogrom and hid &#145;revolutionists who were trying to escape &hellip; took part in meetings of secret circles &hellip; was constantly watched by spies and [his] rooms repeatedly searched&#146;. Police harassment continued and Soskice led a forced peripatetic university life at Kiev, St Petersburg, and Odessa, where he graduated in law. He practised in Kazan but his continuing revolutionary activities led to his arrest in 1890 and imprisonment for three years without trial  (Perris, 266&#150;73). After his release he was warned of re-arrest and escaped to France.<br>
<br>Soskice settled in England in 1898 and on 1 November 1899 married Anna Sophia Johansen, daughter of a Russian judge of Norwegian descent, with whom he had been living; they had a son, Victor (1895&#150;1986). They were divorced in August 1902. Soskice's friendships with Russian refugees and their English sympathizers brought him into contact with Edward and Constance Garnett and their circle, where he met Juliet Catherine Emma Hueffer (1881&#150;1944), a musician and later a writer, whom he married on 20 September 1902. He was fifteen years older and according to David Garnett was &#145;squarely built &hellip; with a curly black beard and a square forehead but with a literal mind and no imagination&#146; while she was &#145;a ravishingly beautiful blonde &hellip; with golden hair&#146;, highly intelligent and gifted in languages and music  (D. Garnett, 37&#150;9). She was fresh and lively, he earnest and serious and said to be without humour, although Perris says that he had &#145;wide culture and fine spirit and [was] as unlike the conventional conspirator as possible&#146;  (Perris, 267&#150;77). Their backgrounds, too, could not have been more different. Her father, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/14044/', "Francis Hueffer")</script>, was a noted music critic; her mother, Catherine, was the daughter of Ford Madox Brown; her aunt, Lucy Madox, to whom she was close, was married to Michael Rossetti; Ford Madox Ford was her brother. Their union was happy and they had three sons of whom the first, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/31703/', "Frank Soskice")</script>, was born on 23 July 1902 before their marriage in September. Their home became a meeting place for writers, artists, refugees, and politicians. Later in life Juliet translated Nekrasov and wrote five novels; her autobiographical <span class="italic">Chapters from Childhood</span> (1921) is a minor classic.<br>
<br>In London, Soskice contributed, under pseudonyms, to Russian newspapers and journals on British affairs and wrote on Russian affairs in English publications. He joined the Agrarian Socialist League and the Socialist Revolutionary Party and was particularly active in the Society for Friends of Russian Freedom, whose aims were to publicize the evils of the tsar's regime and to encourage peaceful democratic change in Russia. (Although publicly for peaceful change, some figures engaged in such activities as gun-running, in which Soskice may have taken some part.) The society published a monthly journal, <span class="italic">Free Russia</span>, to which Soskice contributed; he became editor in 1904 and through his contacts was able to provide full accounts of the events of 1905 in Russia. In January 1905 Father Gapon, the leader of the &#145;bloody Sunday&#146; march in St Petersburg, escaped to England and lived secretly, mainly with the Soskices, in Hammersmith. While in London, Soskice and G. H. Perris combined to write, from Gapon's dictation, his <span class="italic">The Story of my Life</span> (1905).<br>
<br>Late in 1905 Soskice was appointed St Petersburg correspondent for the short-lived Liberal daily newspaper <span class="italic">The Tribune</span>. Perris was foreign editor and they arranged such a comprehensive and accurate coverage of Russian affairs that Benckendorff, the Russian ambassador in London, described the newspaper as his &#145;b&ecirc;te noire&#146; and its St Petersburg correspondent as &#145;execrable&#146;  (Hollingsworth, &#145;Benckendorff&#146;, 107). He was particularly irritated over the episode of the memorial to the Russian Duma of 1906 which <span class="italic">Tribune</span> journalists initiated. It was drawn up immediately after the Duma's dissolution as a statement of support from many public figures in British life, with Soskice making arrangements for its reception in St Petersburg.<br>
<br>In 1908 Soskice returned to England and resumed a busy life in journalism and lecturing, developed business interests in Russia, and established a Russian Law Bureau. In 1908&#150;9 he worked in support of the Parliamentary Russian Committee. In 1909 he took part in an attempt to save the <span class="italic">English Review</span> (to which he himself was a contributor), which was in financial difficulties after an auspicious start under Ford's editorship.<br>
<br>After the collapse of the tsar's government in March 1917 Soskice promoted support for the new regime and in May was appointed a second St Petersburg correspondent for the <span class="italic">Manchester Guardian</span>. He participated vigorously in political debate and action and in August joined Kerensky's secretariat. He was thus able to report and analyse events as they unfolded. He was present during the Kornilov affair, when he feared for his life, and was in the winter palace in November when it was besieged by Bolshevik red guards but managed to escape. He remained loyal to Kerensky and, on his return to London, wrote about the events surrounding Kerensky's fall.<br>
<br>After the triumph of the communist regime Soskice lost hope of any immediate change in the government of Russia, and his final years were spent in Britain on his business affairs and in writing, although he and Juliet remained lively hosts. He was naturalized in 1924 and died at his home, 5 Woodlands Road, Barnes, Surrey, on 28 June 1941 of a duodenal ulcer. He was cremated at Golders Green.<br>
