<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Orczy <span class="st"> [<em>married name </em>Barstow]</span>, Baroness  Emma Magdalena Rosalia Maria Josefa Barbara</span> <span class="st"> [<em>known as </em>Baroness Orczy]</span>  (1865&#150;1947), <span class="occ">novelist</span>, was born on 23 September 1865 at Tarna&ouml;rs, near J&aacute;szber&eacute;ny, about 75 kilometres west of Budapest in Hungary, the younger of the two daughters of Baron B&oacute;dog (translated as Felix) Orczy (1835&#150;1892), landowner, and his wife, Emma, daughter of Count Wass. The Hungarian form of Baroness Orczy's first name, by which she was called and which she preferred, was Emmuska. Her father was a great-grandson of the noted Hungarian poet L&oacute;rinc Orczy (1718&#150;1789). Her paternal grandfather lived in considerable state at Tarna&ouml;rs with his Viennese wife, who never allowed Hungarian to be spoken in her presence. Some time after her birth Emmuska's father was given the estate of Tisza-Ab&aacute;d, to which they moved, and to which he sought to bring modern agricultural machinery and methods, which resulted, when she was about three, in a revolt by the peasants, who burnt the crops and the machinery. Because of this, and because of the agricultural depression and the Viennese banking crisis, her family moved to Budapest; here Felix Orczy, who was deeply interested in music, was <i>Intendant</i> of the national theatres (1870&#150;73), where he championed the music of Richard Wagner against some opposition, and appointed Hans Richter (1843&#150;1916) as <i>Kapellmeister</i>. This again involved him in controversy, and he resigned and moved to Brussels, where he taught music. There the girls spent a year at the convent of the Visitation, and there the elder, Madeleine, died, aged about twelve. Emmuska subsequently went to another convent in Paris. She spoke Hungarian with her father, and French with her mother, but disliked having to speak German to her grandmother. However, she spoke not a word of English when, aged fifteen, she moved with her parents to London, and went for a while to a small day school kept by a German couple near their home, 23 Wimpole Street. In London several of Felix Orczy's compositions were performed, including the operas <span class="italic">The Renegade</span> (1881) and <span class="italic">Sisyphus</span> (1882) and the family frequented musical circles.<br>
<br>Emmuska Orczy decided she wanted to be an artist, and went to the West London School of Art and then to Heatherley's. In the latter school she met her future husband, Henry George Montague Maclean Barstow (1862/3&#150;1943), son of the Revd Michael William Barstow (curate of Thornton Watlass, Yorkshire, <i>c</i>.1854&#150;1866); they married in London on 7 November 1894. Their only child, John Montagu Orczy Barstow, who wrote novels under the name John Blakeney, was born in 1899. They set up home in a studio flat in Holland Park Road and earned their living doing book and magazine illustrations. He illustrated and she translated <span class="italic">Old Hungarian Fairy Tales</span> (1895).<br>
<br>Just before the turn of the century, when Orczy was in her mid-thirties, she began a second career as a writer. A series of mystery stories for the <span class="italic">Royal Magazine</span> featured the Old Man in the Corner, who solves murders by pure deduction while sitting in an ABC teashop playing with pieces of string; historians of the genre regard him as one of the first armchair detectives. The Barstows wanted to visit the Paris Exhibition of 1900 and arranged journalistic commissions to pay for their trip. Inspired by the visit to Paris, Orczy wrote <span class="italic">The Scarlet Pimpernel</span> in five weeks. It was rejected by a dozen publishers, and she nearly accepted &pound;30 for all rights in it. But in 1903 she and her husband succeeded in getting a dramatized version they had written accepted for production by Fred Terry (1863&#150;1933). It was produced that autumn in Nottingham, with no great success, and the Barstows rewrote the last act, so that Terry would not be in a hideous disguise for his final bow. It was finally produced in London in 1905 and after a shaky start became very popular.<br>
<br>An instant best-seller when published as a novel in 1905, the story also became the subject of several film versions: the earliest, a silent film of 1928, was called <span class="italic">The Triumph of the Scarlet Pimpernel</span>; the most famous, <span class="italic">The Scarlet Pimpernel</span> (1935), starred Leslie Howard and was directed by Harold Young; a 1982 version starred Anthony Andrews and was directed by Clive Donner. Television adaptations range from the BBC television series of 1950, starring James Carney, to a British&#150;American co-production, starring Richard E. Grant and directed by Patrick Lau, screened in 1999. The plot was a peculiarly potent mixture of the familiar ingredients of historical fiction. During the French Revolution a secret band of daring Englishmen in disguise rescue French aristocrats from the reign of terror. They are led by Sir Percy Blakeney, who appears to the world a fool and a fop, but is in reality a master of disguise and a brilliant leader of men. As Orczy emphasized in later years, he is the typical English gentleman. This symbol of British foreign policy repeatedly outwits the bungling French bureaucrat Chauvelin; like <span class="italic">The Four Just Men</span> (1905) by Edgar Wallace, the novel pits a group of self-selected upper-class amateurs against the power of the state. Sir Percy is also the soul of honour; he is temporarily estranged from his beautiful French wife, Marguerite, because she has betrayed an enemy of hers to the revolutionaries, recalling the romantic vision of personal integrity in other novels of the period such as <span class="italic">The Four Feathers</span> (1902) by A. E. W. Mason. Much historical fiction expresses nostalgia for aristocratic glamour, but <span class="italic">The Scarlet Pimpernel</span> is remarkable in that its plot literally enacts the desire of its readers to snatch the survivors of the <i>ancien r&eacute;gime</i> to safety as they journey towards the guillotine. They are brought to the security of England, which thus figures as a bulwark of conservatism against foreign revolution, and as a model of peaceable class relations in contrast to the class warfare abroad.<br>
<br>Baroness Orczy published eleven more Scarlet Pimpernel adventures between 1908 and 1940, many other novels, mostly historical fiction, and a biography (1935) of the duchesse de Berri. The most notable of her other volumes of fiction, which had a steady sale without ever achieving the same amazing success as <span class="italic">The Scarlet Pimpernel</span>, is probably the volume of stories called <span class="italic">Lady Molly of Scotland Yard</span> (1910), whose heroine is an early example of a female detective with official status.<br>
<br>In 1908 the Barstows moved out of London, first to Minster in Thanet and then to Snowfield, at Bearsted, Kent. In 1906 Orczy inherited from an uncle the property of Tarna&ouml;rs and a private income, which she was later to lose in the crash which followed the First World War. After the war, partly because Barstow had a weak chest, they bought the Villa Bijou at Monte Carlo, Monaco, a place to which they had taken a liking when she had convalesced there after a nervous breakdown in 1915. There they were instrumental in bringing about the construction of an Anglican church. Their decision to move abroad may have been influenced by the xenophobia current in England at the time; Orczy's widowed mother, who had returned to Hungary in the 1890s but escaped during the war to live near them in Kent, returned home (where she became a captive of the Bolsheviks) in 1918 because she thought that her presence as an enemy alien was doing them harm. Like many Hungarians, Orczy resented the partition of her country under the terms of the 1919 treaty of Trianon; her novel <span class="italic">Pimpernel and Rosemary</span> (1924) depicts from that point of view the events following the annexation of Transylvania (her mother's home province) by Romania. During the 1920s, as Monte Carlo became built up, the Barstows also bought a house in Italy, La Padula, at Rezzola on the Gulf of Spezia, but, finding life in Mussolini's Italy increasingly disagreeable, they sold it in 1933.<br>
<br>Orczy spent the duration of the Second World War in Monte Carlo, in circumstances of some difficulty. Barstow died in February 1943 (in Switzerland, according to <span class="italic">The Times</span> of 27 February 1943, but this may be an error). After the war she returned to England, where she published her memoirs and died, in Brown's Hotel, Dover Street, Mayfair, London, of kidney failure and senility, on 12 November 1947.<br>
