<span class="headword">Ball, Sir  George Thomas  Thalben-</span>  (1896&#150;1987), <span class="occ">organist</span>, was born on 18 June 1896 in Sydney, Australia, the elder son (there were no daughters) of George Charles Ball, who had gone to live temporarily in Australia on business, and his wife, Mary Hannah Spear, daughter of a miller, of Newquay, Cornwall. The family returned to England in 1899 and settled in Muswell Hill, where the father kept a shop. Both his parents were amateur musicians and George became a member of the choir of St James's Church. The Thalben of George's surname, which he added by deed poll in 1924, although he used it from 1917, has some Cornish connection. After attending Highfield, a private school in Muswell Hill, he entered the Royal College of Music on an exhibition in 1911, and studied piano with Frits Hartvigson, Franklin Taylor, and Fanny Davies, organ with Sir Walter Parratt and F. A. Sewell, and composition and history with Sir Charles Stanford, Sir Hubert Parry, and Charles Wood. He quickly took part in ensemble and solo performances at the Royal College of Music, playing, among other works, Liszt's sonata in B minor and, with the orchestra conducted by Stanford, the solo part in Rakhmaninov's piano concerto no. 3 in D minor, the performance of which made a profound impression on his seniors and peers alike.<br>
<br>As an organist Thalben-Ball's energies were largely directed towards developing the music at the various churches where he held appointments: as organist of Whitefield's Tabernacle, Tottenham Court Road (1911); as organist and choir-master of Holy Trinity Church, Castelnau, Barnes (1914&#150;16), and St James's, Sussex Gardens (1916&#150;19); and as acting organist (from 1919) and organist (1923&#150;81) of the Temple Church, near Fleet Street, London. His association with Sir Walford Davies, which led eventually to Thalben-Ball's appointment at the Temple Church, began with Saturday morning choir-training classes at the Royal College of Music, when he took part in conducting and accompanying the choir, and succeeded in getting Walford Davies to allow him to bring along his choristers from Barnes to take part. Thalben-Ball's work at the Temple was the cornerstone of his musical life. Throughout an association of more than sixty years he maintained a uniquely high standard of performance, and a musical style, traditional and in some ways limited, of extraordinary consistency. His achievement was all the more remarkable because the choir, for which the boys were drawn from the City of London School, had essentially to be re-established in the early 1950s following the ravages of the Second World War and the later rebuilding of the church. Thalben-Ball was helped, however, by a strong association of old choristers, which provided a continuing nucleus of singers.<br>
<br>The importance of church and choral music to Thalben-Ball makes his position as an organist somewhat paradoxical. Endowed with an exceptionally robust constitution, possessing impeccable technique and powers of co-ordination, showing concentration and alertness at all times, he became the outstanding British organ recitalist for more than half a century: he could knock spots off everyone else! Together with his seniors, Sir Walter Alcock and George Dorrington Cunningham, he inaugurated the Royal Albert Hall organ in 1924, and was the preferred choice for many opening recitals. He became curator&#150;organist of the Albert Hall in 1934, and was a regular soloist at the Henry Wood Promenade Concerts for many years, making a great effect with Wood's transcriptions of Handel concertos for modern resources. After a recital at Birmingham town hall in 1948, following Cunningham's death, he was persuaded to take on the post of city organist in 1949, together with that of university organist. He always had reservations about this job, but none the less enjoyed the rail journeys from London, and performed a large repertory in more than a thousand recitals before his retirement in 1982.<br>
<br>With his many-sided work and musical interests, Thalben-Ball was never a specialist organist, and this fact helps to explain why his reputation is more that of an executant than an interpreter; his natural sympathies lay firmly within the period bounded by the standard concert repertory of his time, which excluded early music and, to a considerable extent, radical modern composition. His teaching was consistent with this outlook. He would work hard and long, even if somewhat spasmodically, with his pupils at the Royal College of Music, and yet a student often received the greatest enlightenment, not from explanation and discussion, but from persuading the master himself to get on the organ bench and demonstrate his way of doing things. He seemed most at home in music of the era from Mendelssohn to Elgar, and produced memorable accounts of the organ works of Liszt and Julius Reubke. As an accompanist he performed extraordinary feats in turning the organ into an orchestra, such as when playing for Kathleen Ferrier in <span class="italic">The Dream of Gerontius</span>.<br>
<br>Thalben-Ball was religious music adviser to the BBC from 1941, concerned with directing music for broadcast services and composing choral introits for them. This at first involved constant travel, as the department had been evacuated from London to Bedford. Even with the later commitments of Birmingham and the re-formed Temple Church choir, Thalben-Ball was able to keep his BBC connection until 1970. He was appointed CBE in 1967 and knighted in 1982. He was a fellow of the Royal College of Organists (1915), the Royal College of Music (1951), the Royal School of Church Music (1956, diploma 1963), and the Royal Society of Arts (1971), and an honorary member of the Royal Academy of Music (1973). He was president of the Royal College of Organists in 1948&#150;50 and an honorary bencher of the Inner Temple (1959). He won the grand prix de Chartres (1973) and the EMI gold disc (1963, for Mendelssohn's &#145;Hear my prayer&#146;). He had an honorary DMus and gold medal from Birmingham (1972).<br>
<br>Thalben-Ball was about 5 feet 6 inches in height, stockily built, with a small moustache and a ramrod-straight back. His dapper dress and turnout made him a man of the city. He married in 1926 a New Zealand artist, (Grace) Evelyn (1888&#150;1961), daughter of Francis Chapman, a New Zealand wheat exporter. They had a son and a daughter. Evelyn died in 1961 and in 1968 Thalben-Ball married the organist Jennifer Lucy Bate, daughter of Horace Alfred Bate, organist of St James's, Muswell Hill. They had no children and the marriage was annulled in 1972. Thalben-Ball died at a nursing home in Wimbledon on 18 January 1987. He was buried at Highgate cemetery.<br>
