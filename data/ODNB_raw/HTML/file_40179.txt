<span class="headword">Young,  George Kennedy</span>  (1911&#150;1990), <span class="occ">intelligence officer</span>, was born in Dumfries on 8 April 1911, the younger son and youngest of three children of George Stuart Young, grocer, and his wife, Margaret Kennedy. He was brought up in the old covenanting traditions of the United Free Church to which his parents belonged. He was educated at Dumfries Academy and at St Andrews University, where he was an outstanding figure with his great height, red hair, outstanding intellectual ability, quick wit, and strong Independent Labour Party views. He took six years to obtain his degree, during which time he spent a year each at Giessen and at Dijon universities, and he achieved first-class honours in both French and German in 1934. He was then awarded a Commonwealth scholarship (1934&#150;6) to Yale University, where he obtained an MA in political science.<br>
<br>In 1936 Young joined the staff of the <span class="italic">Glasgow Herald</span>, which he left in 1938 to join the British United Press. When war was declared in 1939 he joined the King's Own Scottish Borderers; he was commissioned in 1940 and finally achieved the rank of lieutenant-colonel. He was transferred to field security on the basis of a rather sketchy knowledge of Italian, and served with distinction in the Abyssinian campaign, during which he was mentioned in dispatches (1941). He joined MI6 in Cairo in 1943. After the war he did a stint as British United Press correspondent in Berlin in 1946. Later in the same year he was invited to rejoin MI6 and he accepted; his first job was to investigate the ramifications of German penetration of British intelligence activities in the Low Countries.<br>
<br>Young had the qualities to make a success in this field: a deep knowledge of and interest in politics, a first-class brain, a gift for languages, and an ability to attract the loyalty of his staff. After stints in London and Vienna he was posted to Cyprus, in 1951, as the controller of all MI6 personnel and operations in the Middle East. This task he discharged with a firm hand, and in the process he became a believer in &#145;covert action&#146;, encouraged in this by the success in 1952 of MI6, working with the CIA, in restoring the shah of Iran to his throne. As the Middle East drifted nearer to a major crisis and to confrontation some people in London became anxious about Young's independent plans. Sir Dick White had been appointed head of MI6, and Young was recalled to London late in 1956. He was put in charge of that part of the office concerned with the collation and distribution of intelligence. In this capacity he modernized an out-of-date system, particularly in the scientific and technological field. He was disappointed that he was unable to acquire an unmanned high-flying photo-reconnaissance plane.<br>
<br>After the resignation of Sir James Easton in 1958 Young was appointed vice-chief of MI6, with the rank of under-secretary in the Ministry of Defence from 1960. He became much involved in the Far East, studying the dangers of further involvement by the Americans in Vietnam. By the end of the 1950s his political views, particularly on racial matters, had moved so far to the right that he found it increasingly difficult to conform to official policies, whichever of the major parties was in power. His position as vice-chief of MI6 became difficult to sustain, and it was with some relief on both sides that he resigned in 1961.<br>
<br>Shortly afterwards Young joined the merchant bankers Kleinwort Benson; he worked with them more or less full-time from 1961 to 1976. The two banks had only recently amalgamated and had decided to expand their overseas business. Young's international contacts enabled him to play a quasi-ambassadorial role in this expansion, particularly in Iran, France, and Belgium. He quickly learned the broad principles of banking but was not involved in day-to-day banking operations. This happy arrangement with Kleinworts suited both parties; it gave Young space to develop his increasing interest in home politics, and time to write several books on contemporary problems. These included <span class="italic">Masters of Indecision</span> (1962), a diatribe against Whitehall in general and the Foreign Office in particular; <span class="italic">Merchant Banking</span> (1966); <span class="italic">Who is my Liege?</span> (1972); and <span class="italic">Subversion</span> (1984). He stood as Conservative parliamentary candidate at Brent East in 1974&#151;a gesture of principle rather than of political ambition.<br>
<br>Young's influence on many people lay in what he was rather than in what he achieved. His ability might have taken him to the top in several fields. If he never quite succeeded it was perhaps because, while his views on policies and people were strongly held and pungently expressed, they were often unfashionable, and just occasionally his judgement was suspect. Whether politically involved with the left or the right his attraction and influence lay in his total independence of outlook. He remained at heart a militant Scottish covenanter, believing deeply in the rights of the individual against the central forces of bureaucracy. He was appointed MBE (1945), CMG (1955), and CB (1960).<br>
<br>In 1939 Young married G&eacute;ryke, daughter of Dr Martin August Gustav Harthoorn, a distinguished Dutch lawyer who had spent most of his life in Batavia in the Dutch East Indies; there were no children of the marriage. Young and G&eacute;ryke remained devoted to each other. She was a strong-minded person who forcibly expressed her views about the roles of different ethnic groups. It is hard to estimate the degree of influence she had over Young's change from a left-wing student of the 1930s to a powerful figure in the right-wing Monday Club, but it was substantial. Young died in the Charing Cross Hospital, London, on 9 May 1990.<br>
