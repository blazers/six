<span class="headword">Thomson,  Thomas Napier</span>  (1798&#150;1869), <span class="occ">historian and biographer</span>, was born at Glasgow on 25 February 1798, and was the fifth son of Hugh Thomson, West India merchant, and his wife, Agnes, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Davidson. About 1812 the family moved to London, and Thomson was placed at a boarding-school near Barnet in Hertfordshire. Having contracted a bronchial affection, he was sent to his uncle's house in Ayrshire, and in October 1813 he entered the University of Glasgow as Thomas Thomson, having dropped the &#145;Napier&#146; owing to a disagreement with the Napier family. Thomson was a distinguished student. In 1818 he published <span class="italic">The Immortality of the Soul, and other Poems</span>, his only publication in verse. After entering the Divinity Hall as a student for the ministry, he was reduced to poverty by his father's misfortunes, but managed to support himself at college as a private tutor, and in 1823 he obtained the two highest prizes in the University of Glasgow. Having received a licence as a preacher, he officiated in many parts of Scotland, as well as in Newcastle and Birmingham, besides writing for the <span class="italic">Christian Instructor</span>. In Glasgow he delivered a series of lectures to women on the philosophy of history.<br>
<br>In 1827 Thomson was appointed assistant to Laurence Adamson, minister of Cupar, Fife; but, owing to a return of his throat affection, he had to resign. He was then ordained to the charge of the Scottish church in Maitland, New South Wales, Australia, for which he sailed on 11 May 1831 with a brother and sister. On arriving at Maitland, he found there was neither church, manse, nor congregation, so he initiated a charge at Bathurst on 13 July 1832. About this time he married Lucy Agnes Hall. Shortly after the birth of their second child he resigned his charge and returned to Britain, where he arrived in 1835, to devote himself to literature. Charles Knight (1791&#150;1873) engaged him to edit and remodel Robert Henry's <span class="italic">History of Great Britain</span>. This was afterwards abandoned in favour of a new work, <span class="italic">The Pictorial History of England</span> (1838), to which Thomson was one of the principal contributors. He also wrote extensively for the periodical press, and contributed biographical and critical notices for <span class="italic">The Book of the Poets: Chaucer to Beattie</span> (1842).<br>
<br>In 1840 Thomson was commissioned by the Wodrow Society to edit David Calderwood's <span class="italic">Historie of the Kirk of Scotland</span>. As he had to transcribe the original manuscript in the British Museum, the task took him nearly five years. In July 1844 he left London for Edinburgh, where he had been appointed by the Free Church to edit a series of works it was about to publish. After the appearance of several volumes, comprising the <span class="italic">Select Works</span> of John Knox and other Scottish ministers, the scheme collapsed, and Thomson again turned his attention to the periodical and newspaper press. In 1851 he became connected with Messrs Blackie &amp; Son, the publishers, for whom he afterwards turned out an immense amount of work, notably (along with Charles Macfarlane) <span class="italic">The Comprehensive History of England</span> (4 vols., 1858&#150;61). In 1851 he had written a supplemental volume of R. Chambers's <span class="italic">Biographical Dictionary of Eminent Scotsmen</span>, and immediately before his death he prepared a new edition in three volumes, revised throughout and continued with a supplement, which was published between 1869 and 1871. His own biography is contained in the supplement. Having suffered for some years from chronic bronchitis, Thomson died at his house, Summer Lodge, Trinity, Leith, on 1 February 1869.<br>
<br>Thomson was the author of small works written in his college days, entitled <span class="italic">Richard Gordon</span>, <span class="italic">The Christian Martyr</span>, <span class="italic">A Visit to Dalgarnock</span>, and <span class="italic">The City of the Sun</span>. He also published naval biographies (1839), army biographies (from Alfred to Wellington, 1840), and a history of Scotland for schools (1849). He edited Robert Fleming's <span class="italic">Discourse on the Rise and Fall of the Papacy</span> (1846), Milton's <span class="italic">Poetical Works</span> (1853), and the works of James Hogg, the Ettrick Shepherd (2 vols., 1865).<br>
