<span class="headword">Denny, Sir  Archibald</span>, first baronet  (1860&#150;1936), <span class="occ">shipbuilder and engineer</span>, was born at Dumbarton on 7 February 1860. He was the fourth son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/51876/', "Peter Denny (1821&#150;1895)")</script>, of Helenslee, Dumbarton, shipbuilder, and his wife, Helen (<i>d</i>. 1905), the eldest daughter of James Leslie, of Dumbarton. Educated at Dumbarton Academy until the age of fourteen, he then went to the <i>&eacute;cole cantonale</i> at Lausanne, Switzerland, where he spent two years on the study of science, mathematics, and languages.<br>
<br>Denny began his apprenticeship in the shipbuilding department of the family business of William Denny &amp; Brothers, during which time he qualified for entry to the Royal Naval College, Greenwich, where for three years he combined the academic study of naval architecture with the practical training of the shipyard. On completion of this training he served for a short time at the Liverpool office of Lloyd's Register of Shipping. In 1883 Denny became a partner in his father's firm. He assumed responsibility for the technical side of the undertaking, filling the gap left on the death of his brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37353/', "William Denny (1847&#150;1887)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/51876/', "Denny, Peter")</script>]. He was involved in the development of the ship model experiment tank at the Leven shipyard, which commenced operation in 1883 as the world's first hydromechanics laboratory set up by a commercial shipyard, and remains in operation.<br>
<br>Denny became best known for the leadership which took the shipyard to a position recognized worldwide as second to none for technical excellence. The yard produced high-quality ships, many of which were destined for the high-speed and cross-channel routes. In 1901 it delivered the pioneer passenger turbine steamer <i>King Edward</i> using its vast experience coupled with the knowledge gained from research and experimentation in the ship model tank. Denny was consulted regularly by government departments and other interests, he played a prominent part in the council of the Institution of Naval Architects, and for many years was chairman of the technical committee of the British Corporation Register of Shipping, the Glasgow-based rival to Lloyd's Register of Shipping. He chaired the British Engineering Standards Institution for nine years, the Board of Trade committee on the subdivision of ships from 1920 to 1924, the <i>Titanic</i> disaster investigation committee (1912&#150;15), and the International Conference on the Safety of Life at Sea. He served on many government and official commissions and committees, either as chairman or as a committee member.<br>
<br>In 1885 Denny married Margaret, second daughter of John Tulloch, engineer, of Dumbarton, a partner in the engineering department of the firm. They had five sons and one daughter. Denny served for many years in the volunteers, becoming second in command of a battalion of the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders. He was created a baronet in 1913, and in 1911 and 1927 received the honorary degree of LLD from the universities of Glasgow and of Cambridge respectively. He was elected a fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1894, but recognition by his peers took the form of election as president of the Institution of Engineers and Shipbuilders in Scotland, for the sessions 1903&#150;5. In 1921 he took up residence in London and for the remaining fifteen years of his life represented the shipyard interests in the City. He died in London on 29 May 1936, and was succeeded as second baronet by his eldest son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32786/', "Maurice Edward Denny (1886&#150;1955)")</script>, who also chaired the company board for thirty years. He was survived by his wife.<br>
