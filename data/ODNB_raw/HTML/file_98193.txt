<span class="headword">Jones,  Edward</span> <span class="st"> [<em>nicknamed </em> the Boy Jones]</span>  (<em>b. </em>1824), <span class="occ">trespasser</span>, was born on 7 April 1824, the son of Henry Jones, an impoverished tailor living at Crown Court, Charlotte Street, Westminster. The Mary Jones listed in the census of 1841 may have been his mother or stepmother. In newspaper reports his name was sometimes given as Edwin or Edmund. He had three brothers and three sisters. As a child &#145;he manifested a very restless spirit, always inquisitive, active, and thirsting for information&#146;  (<span class="italic">Weekly Chronicle</span>, 21 March 1841). According to one account he excelled at school, particularly in arithmetic, reading, and penmanship, and had ambitions to become an architect. He was reported as attending a Methodist chapel. Between 1836 and 1838 Jones was apprenticed to two separate apothecaries, and in August 1838 he took up an apprenticeship with a carver and gilder.<br>
<br>On 11 December 1838 Jones suddenly left his employer and soon afterwards broke into Buckingham Palace by means that remain a mystery. Jones secreted himself in the chamber of the valet to Queen Victoria's groom-in-waiting (both men, as well as the queen, being at the time in residence at Windsor), where he slathered himself with the valet's bear-grease pomade, and coated himself with soot in an apparent attempt to escape via the chimney. Early on the morning of 14 December he surprised a porter, who chased the begrimed Jones into the palace grounds and the custody of the police.<br>
<br>Brought before a police magistrate, Jones claimed to be William Cotton, and claimed first to have lived in the palace for twelve years, and then for twelve months. His tales were soon revealed to be a complete fiction. None the less, the myth of the Boy Cotton lived on in a number of histories of the palace and biographies of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert (Woodham-Smith, 207&#150;8; Weintraub, 152; James, 115). Both Jones's invented and actual actions riveted public attention. Indicted for burglary, he was acquitted at Westminster sessions, his counsel depicting his trespass as a youthful lark, something he claimed Jones would not repeat.<br>
<br>Soon afterwards a London theatre manager approached Jones with an offer of &pound;4 a week for him to appear on stage in a drama depicting his exploits. Jones refused. He found employment until 1840 as a chemist's assistant.<br>
<br>On 1 December 1840 Jones again slipped into the palace. The queen was in residence this time, having given birth to her eldest daughter, Victoria, less than a fortnight before. In the early morning of 3 December palace servants discovered Jones in the queen's dressing-room, under a sofa upon which Victoria had been sitting only hours before. Jones had had the run of the palace; his finger-marks were discovered around the soup-stock, and he claimed that he &#145;sat upon the throne, saw the Queen, and heard the Princess Royal &hellip; squall&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 5 Dec 1840). The notoriety of the Boy Jones, or In-I-go Jones, as the newspapers now dubbed him, was even greater than before. Described as very short for his age, he was said to have &#145;affected an air of great consequence&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 4 Dec 1840). Popular and journalistic sentiment held that Jones was an extremely clever lad, motivated&#151;over-motivated&#151;to improve his life, a representative of self-help taken to its ludicrous extreme. Jones's stated motive for entering the palace reinforced this interpretation: he claimed he simply wished to observe life in the palace, with an eye to writing a book. The government, as well, took an interest in Jones's state of mind, relevant because his intrusion followed the assassination attempt on Victoria and Albert in June 1840 by Edward Oxford, who had been declared insane. The privy council brought in two phrenologists to examine Jones, but with inconclusive results. On the afternoon of 3 December, in proceedings from which the press was excluded, privy councillors summarily sentenced Jones as a rogue and a vagabond to three months' hard labour at the Westminster Bridewell, Tothill Fields. There Charles Dickens, who disagreed with the popular assessment of Jones, arranged to visit him, because of his &#145;curiosity to see the Palace Victim; strongly doubting the popular belief in his sharpness of intellect&#146;  (M. House and G. Storey, eds., <span class="italic">The Letters of Charles Dickens</span>, 2, 1969, 246).<br>
<br>Jones's second intrusion exposed to public view the chaotic administration of Buckingham Palace. Baron Stockmar attributed Jones's success to &#145;the absence of system, which leaves the palace without any responsible authority&#146;  (<span class="italic">Memoirs</span>, 125). Prince Albert, at that time almost entirely shut out of Victoria's official life, eagerly took up this project of reform, a crucial early step in what became full involvement in his wife's affairs.<br>
<br>At the end of Jones's imprisonment the governor of Tothill Fields asked Jones to promise not to return to the palace; he refused, claiming his curiosity was simply too great. Jones was released to his parents on 2 March 1841 with the understanding that he would go to sea. Two weeks later, on 15 March 1841, Jones again broke into the palace. This time he was apprehended soon after entering, emerging from the larder with a handkerchief full of meat and potatoes. Again privy councillors tried him at the Home Office, on 16 March, and sentenced him to three months' imprisonment at Tothill Fields as a rogue and vagabond; he was released on 14 June.<br>
<br>While Jones was the source of a great deal of public amusement, he posed a serious problem to the Home Office, which decided to compel Jones to a life at sea. Soon after his second imprisonment, an officer of the Thames police, with the help of Jones's father's landlord, succeeded in separating Jones from his family and compelling him to travel to a number of English and Irish ports, finally finding him a berth on a merchant ship sailing from Liverpool to Brazil. His father, frantic at his disappearance, reported all that he knew of the mystery to the press, in an obvious attempt to enlist public sympathy. By December 1841 Jones was back in Liverpool, where he set off on foot to London, subsisting on turnips and sleeping in barns. By the end of the month he arrived in the metropolis, where his father had managed to obtain for him an apprenticeship with a tobacconist at Tothill Street, Westminster.<br>
<br>After a month's contented employment there, Jones abruptly vanished; his father's landlord had convinced or compelled Jones to enlist in the Royal Navy. Jones served on HMS <i>Warspite</i>, <i>Inconstant</i>, and <i>Harlequin</i>, a dutiful if sullen mizen top mastman and seaman, whom the newspapers occasionally recalled to public eye because of his compulsion to jump overboard for no logical reason. Jones remained under government scrutiny: as late as 1846 Lord John Russell's cabinet discussed the problem he posed. Jones's last known sighting as a sailor was during celebrations for the queen's birthday in 1847, when, off the coast of Syria, he was displayed for the amusement of visitors.<br>
<br>At this point Jones faded into obscurity, though by one account he settled in Perth, Western Australia, became a town crier, and was continually tormented by the children of the city because of his youthful intrusions. According to this account Jones died about 1896  (Lucy, 1.160).<br>
<br>The Boy Jones's three breathtaking and unprecedented journeys from the slums of Westminster to Buckingham Palace made him a household name among the early Victorians, and an emblem of persistent, if inappropriate, ambition.<br>
