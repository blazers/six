<div class="para">
<span class="headword">McCheyne,  Robert Murray</span>  (1813&#150;1843), <span class="occ">Church of Scotland minister</span>, was born on 21 May 1813 at 14 Dublin Street, Edinburgh, the youngest of the five children of Adam McCheyne (<i>d</i>. 1854), lawyer and writer to the signet, and his wife, Lockhart Murray Dickson (<i>d</i>. 1854), youngest daughter of David Dickson, proprietor of Nether Locharwood, in Dumfries. While Robert was recovering from scarlet fever at the age of four, his father taught him to read and write the Greek alphabet. The following year he was sent to George Knight's school. Two years later the family moved to 56 Queen Street, Edinburgh, and sixteen years later to 20 Hill Street. From October 1821 McCheyne attended Infirmary Street high school, Edinburgh. He matriculated at Edinburgh University in 1827. In 1831 he entered the Divinity Hall. At university he won prizes in all his classes. He had a particular love for natural scenery, and many of his letters are illustrated by sketches that testify to his skill in drawing.<br>
<br>On 8 July 1831 McCheyne's brother David died at the age of twenty-six&#151;of the effects of a cold caught while hill walking. The two brothers had been close, and David often shared his evangelical Christian faith with Robert. David's death strongly contributed to Robert's conversion, which occurred soon afterwards. In 1835 he went before Edinburgh presbytery for his licence to preach. He later wrote that, &#145;For a good hour &hellip; all heckled me, like so many terriers on a rat&#146;  (Smellie, 45). However, because the Edinburgh presbytery was so busy, McCheyne undertook further examinations, and was instead licensed by the presbytery of Annan on 1 July 1835, and became, as he expressed it, &#145;a preacher of the Gospel, an honour to which I cannot name an equal&#146;  (ibid., 46). In November he became assistant to John Bonar in the parishes of Larbert and Dunipace, near Stirling.<br>
<br>McCheyne's fame as a preacher spread quickly and, along with Andrew Bonar and Alexander Somerville, he was considered by the new church of St Peter in Dundee. It was McCheyne who was called and he was ordained there on 24 November 1836. From the start of his ministry the church was full, with some 1100 people attending, many having to stand. People were not drawn by his oratory or voice, but by the power, simplicity, freeness, and sufficiency of the gospel he preached. As one of his contemporaries, a Mr Hamilton of Regent Square, London, commented, &#145;few ministers preach with the fervour, the Christ-exalting simplicity, and the prayerful expectancy of Robert McCheyne&#146;  (Bonar, 172). In his first year of ministry he received three further calls offering far more than the &pound;200 yearly stipend he was receiving, but he rejected each one. He became actively involved in the cause of church extension, and in 1837 became secretary to the Forfarshire Association.<br>
<br>In late 1838, being thoroughly exhausted, McCheyne was forced to leave Dundee and return to his family's Edinburgh home. A little later he joined the Church of Scotland's mission of inquiry to Israel, its remit being to inquire into the number, condition, and character of the Jews. The mission left England on 29 March 1839, and returned on 6 November. The details of its visit were recorded and subsequently published in the <span class="italic">Narrative of a Mission of Enquiry to the Jews from the Church of Scotland, in 1839</span> (1842). McCheyne had been worried about leaving his congregation during his visit to Israel, but he was relieved when William C. Burns successfully took his place.<br>
<br>In November 1842 McCheyne was a member of the convocation and would have led his church into the Free Church had he lived to see the Disruption. In early 1843 he took part in a number of evangelistic missions, one of which crossed the border into Northumberland. In February 1843 he journeyed to the north-east of Scotland, to the districts of Deer and Ellon, where he preached and spoke twenty-seven times in twenty-four different places.<br>
<br>McCheyne never married, but he was twice engaged. His first fianc&eacute;e was a Miss Maxwell, the daughter of a Dundee physician; possibly her parents prevented the marriage. He was later engaged to Jessie Thain of Heath Park near Blairgowrie.<br>
<br>In 1843 typhus was prevalent in Dundee, but McCheyne visited freely among the sick. Being weak himself, he soon caught the infection and quickly became gravely ill. On Saturday 25 March, in his own bedroom with Dr James Gibson beside him, McCheyne died while raising his hands as if to pronounce the benediction. All Dundee was moved by the news of his death. His parents agreed to the wish of St Peter's that McCheyne be buried in St Peter's graveyard, rather than in the family's own burial-ground in Edinburgh. He was buried on Thursday 30 March, with perhaps 7000 people attending the funeral.<br>
<br>McCheyne was esteemed by his contemporaries for the remarkable results of his short period of ministry, the hymns he wrote (including &#145;Jehovah Tsidkenu&#146; and &#145;The Barren Fig-Tree&#146;), and his published diary and sermons, collected in A. A. Bonar's <span class="italic">Memoir and Remains</span> (1844; 2nd edn, 1892). Some indication of the success of, and interest in, McCheyne's life and ministry may be seen in the fact that this work had, by 1910, sold more than 500,000 copies.<br>
