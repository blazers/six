<span class="headword">Ashton,  Thomas Gair</span>, first Baron Ashton of Hyde  (1855&#150;1933), <span class="occ">industrialist and politician</span>, was born at Ashfield, Fallowfield, Lancashire, on 5 February 1855, the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/50518/', "Thomas Ashton (1818&#150;1898)")</script>, cotton manufacturer, of Hyde, Cheshire, and his wife, Elizabeth (1831&#150;1914), daughter of Samuel Stillman Gair, of Rhode Island, USA, and Penketh Hall, Liverpool. Thomas Ashton's second daughter became the wife of James (later Viscount) Bryce. The Ashtons had for generations been known for their singularly humane treatment of the workers in their cotton mills, and, after his education at Rugby School, 1868&#150;74, and University College, Oxford, 1874&#150;7 (of which he was elected an honorary fellow in 1923), Thomas Gair Ashton was connected with the family business in Manchester and Hyde for forty years, carrying on this tradition, which coloured his whole life. He married on 2 December 1886 Eva Margaret (<i>d</i>. 1938), second daughter of John Henry James, of Watford, who belonged to a Cumberland family. They had two sons, the elder of whom died as a child, and two daughters.<br>
<br>He was Liberal member of parliament for the Hyde division from 1885 to 1886, when he lost the seat (failing to regain it in 1892), and for the Luton division from 1895 to 1911. During that period he sat on various royal commissions, was chairman of the House of Commons railway and canal traffic committee in 1909, and of the standing orders committee in 1910, and became notable in the house for his wide knowledge of finance.<br>
<br>Ashton's care for education was also displayed by his guarantee to make good any losses sustained in its first three years by the county secondary school at Hyde, and by his support of the Hyde Technical School and the free library, both for a time dependent on his generosity. He was a governor of Manchester University, the first honorary secretary of the Manchester Technical School, and a member of the governing body of the Whitworth Institute. He also took a keen interest in the history and antiquities of Sussex, where he lived after 1902.<br>
<br>Ashton was raised to the peerage in 1911 as Baron Ashton of Hyde, and, during the First World War he was chairman of the cotton exports committee, which controlled the amount of cotton allowed to pass through the blockade to neutral nations bordering Germany. The importance of this work lay in the fact that cotton was then a raw material for munitions.<br>
<br>Ashton was sagacious, far-sighted, widely read, and widely travelled, with excellent judgement of men and affairs, and an immense capacity for work, but his extreme reserve and modesty hid his real capabilities from those not closely acquainted with him. He had a most exacting sense of duty in all public affairs, and was entirely incapable of self-advertisement, never pushing his own claims and interests. Nor for one moment did he support any views merely because of their popularity. For instance, he advocated home rule for Ireland before W. E. Gladstone pronounced in its favour. But, owing to his profound shyness, he struck even those who knew him well as curiously impersonal, a fact which perhaps militated against due recognition of his deep feeling for the causes which he served so faithfully. He died at his home, Vinehall, Mountfield, Robertsbridge, in Sussex, on 1 May 1933 and was buried three days later at Hyde Chapel in Cheshire. He was succeeded as second baron by his younger son, Thomas Henry Raymond (1901&#150;1983).<br>
