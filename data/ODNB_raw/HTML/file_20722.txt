<span class="headword">Oliver,  George</span>  (1782&#150;1867), <span class="occ">antiquary and writer on freemasonry</span>, was born on 5 November 1782 at Papplewick, Nottinghamshire, the eldest son of Samuel Oliver (1756&#150;1847), schoolmaster and, after 1842, rector of Lambley, Nottinghamshire. His mother was Elizabeth, daughter of George Whitehead of Blyth Spital in the same county. He had eight siblings. The family claimed descent from an ancient Scottish family, some members of which moved to England in the reign of James I and later settled at Clipstone Park, Nottinghamshire. Oliver attended his father's school in Lutterworth, Leicestershire, and perhaps another in Nottingham. In 1803 he became usher of the grammar school at Caistor, Lincolnshire. In 1805 he married Mary Ann (1785/6&#150;1856), daughter of Thomas Beverley. They had three sons and two daughters.<br>
<br>From 1809 to 1826 Oliver was headmaster of King Edward's Grammar School at Great Grimsby and, after being ordained deacon in 1812 and priest in 1813, he was curate of Grimsby from 1815 to 1831. In addition he had the living of Clee, but never lived there. As a young man, probably in 1802, he became a freemason, joining the Peterborough lodge of which his father was member and chaplain. In Grimsby he started a new lodge, of which he was master for ten years. In 1831, having lost the curacy at Grimsby, he became rector of Scopwick, Lincolnshire, which he held until his death. He was happy there and energetically rebuilt the vicarage, restored the church, and started a school. In 1814 he entered Trinity College, Cambridge, as a &#145;ten year man&#146;, but never took a degree there, though he was awarded a Lambeth DD in 1835. From 1834 to 1846 he was perpetual curate of St Peter's collegiate church, Wolverhampton. He intended to divide his time between Wolverhampton and Scopwick, but after bitter disputes with his churchwardens in Wolverhampton, particularly over church rates, he left the church in the care of a curate after 1841. He was also domestic chaplain to Lord Kensington and, in 1846, was made rector of South Hykeham, Lincolnshire.<br>
<br>From early life Oliver was a prolific author; he wrote mainly on topographical subjects and freemasonry, but also published some religious works. His most important topographical work was his <span class="italic">History and Antiquities of the Town and Minster of Beverley</span> (1829), which incorporated material collected earlier by the publisher Matthew Turner. It was, however, remaindered in 1839 after the publication of a rival history, George Poulson's <span class="italic">Beverlac</span> (1829 or 1830), which was thought to be superior. Oliver produced other works on the monuments and histories of the places in which he lived and worked, namely Grimsby (1825, 1829), Wolverhampton (1836), and Sleaford and Lincoln (1837, 1846).<br>
<br>Oliver also published more than thirty works on freemasonry, of which he considered <span class="italic">The Symbol of Glory</span> (1850) his best; it was as a freemason that he achieved greatest prominence. He regarded masonry as a universal moral code instituted by God at the creation, and his life's work, or &#145;grand design&#146;, was to prove that masonry was necessarily Christian, or rather protestant. This was a concern that he had inherited from his father and on which he expounded in contorted books and regular contributions to the <span class="italic">Freemasons' Quarterly Review</span>, which attracted wide notice and earned him the name the Sage of Masonry. In 1833 he became deputy provincial grand master of Lincolnshire. He was dismissed from this post in 1842 after public support for Robert Crucefix, editor of the <span class="italic">Review</span>, who had come into conflict with the masonic hierarchy over support for a new charity. It is likely, however, that Oliver's dismissal reflected the opposition of the duke of Sussex, the grand master, who, in an effort to unify the movement, was working to make masonic rites less Christian. Oliver attracted considerable sympathy in the row that ensued, and in 1846 supporters elected him honorary member of the grand lodge of Massachusetts, with the rank of past deputy grand master. Oliver and Crucefix subsequently organized the ancient and accepted rite of freemasons as a Christian body.<br>
<br>In 1854, as his health began to fail, Oliver left his parishes in the hands of curates and retired to Lincoln, where he died on 3 March 1867. He was buried on 7 March with masonic rites in the cemetery attached to the church of St Swithin, Lincoln.<br>
