<span class="headword">Boyd,  Edward <span class="st"> [Eddie]</span></span>  (1916&#150;1989), <span class="occ">playwright and scriptwriter</span>, was born on 11 May 1916 at 5 Townhead Street, Stevenston, Ayrshire, probably the eldest of four children known to have been born to Samuel Joseph Boyd, dynamite worker (whose father, Edward, was from co. Antrim, Ireland), and his wife, Mary Chapman Gardiner (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1925). When Eddie was seven his younger twin brothers died at three months; two years on, first another brother and then his mother died of diphtheria within twelve hours of each other.<br>
<br>After attending Ardrossan Academy, at fifteen Boyd went to London with 1<i>s</i>. 2<i>d</i>. in his pocket, and spent four nights sleeping on a bench on the Embankment and several months in a home for the destitute. While in London he wrote a short story entitled &#145;Home is the sailor&#146;, later accepted by the <span class="italic">Manchester Guardian</span>. He received a cheque for 3 guineas, which he did not know how to cash. He served in the Royal Air Force from September 1939 to November 1945, as what he called their &#145;worst navigator&#146;  (Davidson). During the war years he married, but no details of the union are known; he called it &#145;a fleeting piece of war-time frivolity&#146;  (Davidson). After the war he worked as a part-time editor for Collins, and became involved with the left-wing Unity Theatre in Glasgow as stage manager, actor, and producer, beginning an enduring association with the actor Roddy McMillan. On 9 September 1948 he married Kathleen Maxwell or Donaldson (<i>b</i>. 1924/5), actress, daughter of Joseph Harrison Maxwell, school teacher, with whom he had a daughter, Susan. After fourteen years the marriage ended acrimoniously. He lived with his third wife, Catherine Cassidy Thomson (<i>b</i>. 1946), college lecturer, daughter of William Thomson, iron moulder, for twenty years, and had a second daughter, Rachel (the union was formalized on 24 September 1987).<br>
<br>For most of his career Boyd was a freelance writer, who became associated with BBC radio in Scotland and worked for four years as a contract writer with Granada Television. His radio career began with the acclaimed play <span class="italic">The Candle of Darkness</span> (1954). In the 1960s he wrote a crime drama, <span class="italic">The Odd Man</span> (1962), which was much admired, and a surreal thriller, <span class="italic">The Corridor People</span> (1966), which was likened to <span class="italic">The Avengers</span> and <span class="italic">The Prisoner</span>. Both were for Granada. His script of <span class="italic">Robbery</span> (1967), a film starring Stanley Baker, was a co-winner of the Screen Writers' Guild award. In 1971 he was praised for his radio play <span class="italic">The Wolf Far Hence</span>. A one-off television drama entitled <span class="italic">Good Morning Yesterday</span> led to his most celebrated work, the BBC series <span class="italic">The View from Daniel Pyke</span> (1971&#150;3), in which Roddy McMillan excelled as a superficially tough Glaswegian private detective. In 1978 Boyd had further success with a television adaptation of John Buchan's <span class="italic">Huntingtower</span>.<br>
<br>Boyd was inspired by the blues and <i>film noir</i>. Recalling Raymond Chandler, he said that he wanted to create art &#145;where it is least expected&#146;  (Davidson). A tall, stooped figure with the face of a Roman Stoic but with the learning of an erudite anarchist, he had a sense of humour at once dry and surreal, and a reputation for being both outspoken and enigmatic. The care and psychological depth he brought to the atmospheric thriller exercised a considerable influence on Scottish writing. He continued to write and to express independent views (including the view that Scottish theatre was dead) until the end of his life. Following several years of poor health he suffered a stroke in his home at 23 Hillhead Street, Glasgow, and died in Gartnavel General Hospital on 17 December 1989.<br>
