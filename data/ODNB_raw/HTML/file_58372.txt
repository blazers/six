<span class="headword">Margoliouth <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Smith]</span>,  Jessie Payne</span>  (1856&#150;1933), <span class="occ">Syriac scholar</span>, was born on 23 February 1856, at 27 Kensington Square, Kensington, London, the second of four daughters and two sons of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21660/', "Robert Payne Smith (1818&#150;1895)")</script>, dean of Canterbury and orientalist, and his wife, Catherine, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Freeman (<i>d</i>. 1894). Brought up in Oxford and (from 1871) Canterbury, she was trained in both Syriac and lexicography by her father, and proceeded to assist him in the production of his monumental <span class="italic">Thesaurus Syriacus</span> (1868&#150;1901), one of the truly great works of British lexicography and one that is unlikely to be superseded. On his death she took over responsibility for the <span class="italic">Thesaurus</span> and saw it, and its final 293 columns, through to completion in 1901. In this she was assisted by <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/34874/', "David Samuel Margoliouth (1858&#150;1940)")</script>, the Laudian professor of Arabic in Oxford, whom she had married in London on 25 April 1896 (they had no children). Even her marriage can be attributed to her devotion to the <span class="italic">Thesaurus</span>, for in a letter a friend quotes her as saying:<blockquote>She finds Professor Margoliouth of Oxford so very kind and useful in helping her with her Father's book, &#145;that she is going to marry him so that they can work at it together&#146;&#151;! This is exactly as she puts the fact. (Coakley, 393, n. 303)</blockquote>In 1927 she completed this great lexical endeavour with her <span class="italic">Supplement to the &#145;Thesaurus Syriacus&#146;</span>, an important volume which contains some 345 pages of new entries.<br>
<br>In 1903 Margoliouth published her <span class="italic">Compendious Syriac Dictionary</span> (which has been frequently reprinted), an abridgement of her father's work with words rearranged in alphabetical order, rather than being listed by their Semitic roots, and with English rather than Latin translations. It has been an essential tool for successive generations of Syriac students, and has encouraged many to take up the study of this rich language and literature. Margoliouth's own enthusiasm for Syriac culture, as well as her strong Christian faith and humour, can be detected in the short Syriac imprecations that begin each section of the dictionary, playing as they do with words and roots beginning with the appropriate letters of the alphabet. Her lexical work required her to read an extraordinary range of published and unpublished Syriac texts, leading one eminent contemporary orientalist to comment after visiting her: &#145;the house is not a <i>house</i> but a <i>store-house</i> of erudition, where Mrs. Margoliouth, with her extensive Syriac knowledge, supplies the last volume of a living encyclopaedia&#146;  (Mingana, 218).<br>
<br>This Syriac expertise led to Margoliouth's involvement, from the 1880s, with the Archbishop of Canterbury's Mission to the Assyrian Christians in Turkey and Persia, which had as its purpose not conversion, which its statutes forbade, but the strengthening of faith and religious practice. At first a consultant, she later became a member of the mission committee, and in 1913 edited a selection of accounts of the mission, <span class="italic">Kurds and Christians</span>, with the Revd F. N. Heazell. Her own devotion to the Assyrian cause was strengthened by an extended tour of the mission and surrounding regions with her husband in 1901. On the orders of the War Office the couple spent the First World War lecturing in India (he returned in 1917, she in 1918). This was followed by a lengthy stay in Iraq, from which time both were active in their support of the persecuted and massacred Assyrians and Armenians.<br>
<br>In 1931 Margoliouth and her husband moved from 88 Woodstock Road, Oxford, to Romney, Boars Hill, near Oxford, where she died on 18 August 1933. She was buried on 21 August at Hoop Lane cemetery, Golders Green, London.<br>
