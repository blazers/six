<span class="headword">Blount,  William</span>, fourth Baron Mountjoy  (<em>c.</em>1478&#150;1534), <span class="occ">courtier and literary patron</span>, was born in the parish of Barton Blount, Derbyshire. His father, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2690/', "John Blount, third Baron Mountjoy")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2700/', "Blount, Walter, first Baron Mountjoy")</script>], died in 1485 and William succeeded to the title as a minor. His uncle Sir James Blount was granted the custody of his lands and marriage and he did not enter into his inheritance until 31 January 1500. After his father's death his mother, Lora Berkeley (<i>d</i>. 1501), married first Sir Thomas Montgomery (<i>d</i>. 1495) and then Thomas Butler, seventh earl of Ormond (<i>d</i>. 1515), who was a grandfather of Thomas Boleyn.<br>
<br>It is unlikely that Mountjoy went to Paris as early as 1496, as tradition relates. In 1497 he was involved in the suppression of the Cornish uprising and about Easter that year he married Elizabeth Say, daughter and coheir of Sir William Say of Essenden, Hertfordshire. She was probably too young to begin living with him and did not go with him to Paris in 1498. He was, however, accompanied by Richard Whitford, a fellow of Queens' College, Cambridge, who would later become his chaplain and to whom he would act as a supporter throughout his life. In Paris he made the acquaintance of Erasmus, who had been acting as tutor to Thomas Grey and sharing accommodation with him. Erasmus became Mountjoy's tutor in turn and when Mountjoy returned to England in 1499 he asked Erasmus to join him. Erasmus, who stated himself willing to follow Mountjoy even to the lower world itself, complied and soon established himself in his patron's household, which was generally perceived as a haven to scholars. Although his father had in his will specifically warned his sons of the dangers of desiring &#145;to be grete about princes&#146;, Mountjoy became a <i>socius studiorum</i> to Prince Henry at this time, perhaps through the influence of his stepfather Ormond, who was chamberlain to Queen Elizabeth of York, and Elizabeth seems to have had the primary responsibility for her son's education. In the dedicatory epistle to Charles Blount of his 1531 edition of Livy, written some thirty years later, Erasmus would recall that the principal subject studied by the young men had been history. Mountjoy arranged for both Erasmus and Thomas More to visit the royal nursery at Eltham in 1499, and in later years Erasmus claimed that the reason Henry's written style was similar to his own was because Mountjoy encouraged Henry to read his works at an early age. With Mountjoy's encouragement Erasmus began compiling his <span class="italic">Adagia</span>, which was first published after his return to Paris in 1500 and dedicated to his pupil. In 1499 Mountjoy requested Erasmus to produce an expanded form of <span class="italic">De conscribendis epistolis</span>, which had been written for his pupils in Paris, and the new version was dedicated to him.<br>
<br>In 1500 Mountjoy was in Calais with Henry VII and in 1501 he was present at Prince Arthur's marriage to Katherine of Aragon. In 1504, through the mediation of their mutual acquaintance John Colet, Erasmus let it be known that he would welcome renewed patronage from Mountjoy. Mountjoy duly invited him back to England and provided him with an annuity of 100 crowns. Although Erasmus's stay in England was brief, from late 1505 until June 1506, his praises for Mountjoy were renewed and he claimed that &#145;the sun never shone on a truer friend of scholars&#146;  (Mynors and others, ep. 186). Before 1507 Mountjoy was a member of Henry VII's council and Henry visited him in 1508. His first wife died before 21 July 1506 and was buried at Essenden.<br>
<br>At the coronation of Henry VIII on 23 June 1509 Mountjoy was created a knight of the Bath and on 9 July he was made master of the mint. Before the end of July he married Inez de Venegas (sometimes Anglicized as Agnes Vanegas), who had been one of the attendants of Katherine of Aragon as princess of Wales. Henry wrote to Ferdinand II of Aragon supporting her claim to a legacy from Queen Isabella. On 6 October Mountjoy was appointed lieutenant of the castle of Hammes, near Calais, for twenty years and thereafter during pleasure, a position his father had occupied before him. Mountjoy was keenly enthusiastic about the new dispensation under Henry and his most famous letter to Erasmus, dated 27 May 1509 (and probably composed by Andrea Ammonio who was acting as his secretary), is a panegyric to the king: &#145;Heaven smiles, earth rejoices; all is milk and honey and nectar. Tight-fistedness is well and truly banished. Generosity scatters wealth with unstinting hand&#146;  (Mynors and others, ep. 215). Erasmus did in fact return to England soon afterwards as Mountjoy had hoped, but Mountjoy himself was much occupied on the continent during this period. In late 1511 Erasmus wrote to Ammonio and Colet from Cambridge to enquire about Mountjoy's whereabouts, but even after Mountjoy came back to England in November Erasmus avoided his household because of the presence of &#145;Cerberus&#146;, perhaps the French poet Bernard Andr&eacute;, to whom he owed money.<br>
<br>By May 1512 Mountjoy had succeeded Ormond as Katherine of Aragon's chamberlain, and in that office received an annuity of &pound;66 13<i>s</i>. 4<i>d</i>. In March of the following year he was at the court of Spain. He was then put in charge of transport for the war against France and in September departed for Calais with a force of 500 men. After the capture of Tournai he was made acting lieutenant, bailiff, and, in January 1515, governor of the city. In that capacity he was responsible for the beginnings of works on a citadel within the town, intended to provide a separate stronghold for the English garrison there. Unfinished when Mountjoy was replaced, it was never fully completed. Erasmus visited Mountjoy in Tournai in the spring of 1515 <i>en route</i> for England. Richard Sampson, Wolsey's vicar-general in Tournai, became involved with Mountjoy in an attempt to secure a prebend for Erasmus at this time, although the plan did not succeed. Once he reached London, Erasmus wrote to Cardinal Domenico Grimani complaining that &#145;the oldest patron of my studies, has been so overwhelmed by the burdens of war that his help fell short of his affection&#146;  (Mynors and others, ep. 334). In 1516 Mountjoy informed Wolsey that he would like to be replaced as governor, but this did not occur until January 1517 and he returned to England in that year.<br>
<br>It is not known when his second wife died, but by February 1515 Mountjoy had married Alice (<i>d</i>. 1521), daughter of Henry Keble of St Mary Aldermary, and widow of William Brown; among their children was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2682/', "Charles Blount")</script>, courtier and patron of learning. She was with Mountjoy in the entourage of Katherine of Aragon at the Field of Cloth of Gold in 1520. In May 1521 he was one of the peers who tried the third duke of Buckingham and in August he was at Bruges for the meeting of Wolsey with the emperor Charles. In 1521 Henry VIII was much involved in the Lutheran controversy and Mountjoy wrote to Erasmus asking him to declare his own position on Luther. Alice died on 8 June 1521 and was buried in the church of the London Greyfriars. The next year Mountjoy was present at Henry's meeting with Charles at Canterbury.<br>
<br>In 1523 Mountjoy accompanied Charles Brandon, duke of Suffolk, on his invasion of France. On 30 January 1523 Erasmus wrote to Johann von Botzheim, noting that his panegyric on marriage much impressed Mountjoy as a young man&#151;&#145;He has been married three times, and is now a widower; but perhaps he will marry a fourth time&#151;so easy is it to push the wagon on the way it already wants to go&#146;  (Mynors and others, ep. 1341a)&#151;and before 29 July 1523 he married Dorothy, widow of Robert, Lord Willoughby, and daughter of Thomas Grey, marquess of Dorset, Erasmus's former pupil in Paris. She outlived him and did not die until 1553. In 1525 Mountjoy solicited a treatise on the subject of marriage from Erasmus on Queen Katherine's behalf. Erasmus complied, and in 1526 published the <span class="italic">Christiani matrimonii institutio</span>, dedicated to Katherine. The presentation copy survives in Emmanuel College, Cambridge. In 1526 Mountjoy was elected a knight of the Garter and in the subsidy of 1527 he was rated at &pound;1000. About 1529 he was elected steward of Cambridge University. After his twenty-year appointment as lieutenant of Hammes was completed in 1529, Henry permitted him to sell the office to William, Lord Grey of Wilton, and he surrendered his patent in May 1531.<br>
<br>Although Mountjoy was one of the lords signing the open letter to Pope Clement VII urging the divorce in 1530 he remained Katherine's chamberlain. Chapuys wrote in April 1533 that he had been ordered to stay with Katherine to prevent her escaping from England. In July he was head of the delegation that went to see Katherine at Ampthill to persuade her to submit to the consequences of the king's new marriage and acknowledge herself dowager princess. Katherine spurned all their conditions, and Cromwell later declared to Chapuys that if Katherine had been a man she would have surpassed all the heroes of history. After this failed mission, no doubt repugnant to him, Mountjoy requested to be replaced as chamberlain and on 10 October 1533 he wrote to Cromwell that &#145;hit is not my parte, nor for me this often to vexe or unquyet her whom the kynges grace cawsed to be sworne unto and truly to serve her to my power&#146;  (<span class="italic">State Papers, Henry VIII</span>, 1.408). After his death he was not replaced in that office.<br>
<br>In July 1534 Mountjoy was on the panel of lords at the treason trial of William, Lord Dacre. He died on 8 November following at Sutton on the Hill, near Barton Blount, Derbyshire, and was buried at his own request at Barton Blount. In his will, dated 14 October 1534, he asked patience of his creditors, considering that he had impoverished himself to provide for his son and that he had often been called abroad in service of the king to whom he had been a &#145;slender suter&#146;  (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/25, fol. 243<i>v</i>). His house in London was on Silver Street.<br>
<br>The mother of Mountjoy's daughter Gertrude was his first wife Elizabeth Say. Gertrude married on 25 October 1519 Henry Courtenay, who was created marquess of Exeter on 18 June 1525 and executed in 1539. She was close to Princess Mary and when the latter came to the throne she was rehabilitated and made a lady-in-waiting. The mother of his eldest son and heir, Charles, and his daughter Catherine (later Champernown and Berkeley) was Mountjoy's third wife, Alice Keble. His fourth wife, Dorothy Grey, was the mother of his son John, who was her principal beneficiary, and his daughters Dorothy (later Blewett) and Mary (later Dennys). Henry VIII's mistress Elizabeth Blount, who had been a lady-in-waiting to Katherine and who was the mother of Henry Fitzroy, was Mountjoy's cousin.<br>
