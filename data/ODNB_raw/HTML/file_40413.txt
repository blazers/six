<span class="headword">Carrick,  William</span>  (1827&#150;1878), <span class="occ">photographer</span>, was born on 31 December 1827 in Edinburgh, the eldest of the three children who survived into adulthood of Andrew Carrick (1802&#150;1860), a timber and rope merchant, and his wife, Jessie, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Lauder (1810&#150;1876). A few weeks after his birth the family moved to Kronstadt, the naval base on the Gulf of Finland of St Petersburg, where the Carricks had been trading since the late eighteenth century. They stayed there for sixteen years, during which time Carrick's brother, George Lyon (1840&#150;1908), and sister, Jessie-Mary (1842&#150;1924), were born.<br>
<br>In 1844 the Carrick family moved into the heart of the Russian capital. Their relocation coincided with Carrick's enrolment at the St Petersburg Academy of Arts as a student of architecture under the tutelage of Alexander Bryullov, a leading Russian architect and watercolourist. This entrance into the art world was made possible through the agency of a close family friend, the Polish painter Xavier Jan Kaniewski. In 1853 Carrick was awarded the title of &#145;unclassified artist with the right to undertake building&#146;, upon receipt of which he departed for three years of further study in Rome. There he concentrated on creating watercolour portraits and studies of architectural monuments.<br>
<br>Following the end of the Crimean War and the collapse of the family business, in 1856 Carrick returned to St Petersburg and determined to become a photographer. Initially he was engaged with Ivan Hoch, a long-standing acquaintance who had studied art with him at the Academy and in Rome. By the summer of 1857 he and his siblings had departed for Edinburgh to further their education. Carrick briefly studied photography under James Good Tunny, met the photographic technician John MacGregor, and in October 1857 went back to St Petersburg to establish himself as a professional photographer. In 1859 he opened his atelier at 19 Malaya Morskaya Street and was joined by MacGregor as his assistant.<br>
<br>Carrick, himself a striking man of six feet four inches with bushy beard and wavy hair, achieved some success as the commercial portrait photographer he set out to be. However, he really found his niche as a photographer of Russian folk scenes, both urban and rural, and of painting. These two fields were brought together through his association with many artists connected to the progressive Itinerant Art Exhibition Society (the Peredvizhniki) whose aim was to popularize painting, not least by taking it to the provinces and elevating humble genres. Anticipating the Itinerants' interests, by the early 1860s he had begun to print card sets of photographs of Russian &#145;types&#146; for sale as souvenirs. He was to continue making and adding to these for the next decade and a half. They included St Petersburg hawkers (<i>raznoschiki</i>) as well as other workers and peasants from both town and country. For a set of eighty such images which he had given to the liberal but sickly heir apparent, Grand Duke Nicholas, in 1862, he was presented with a diamond ring. Among those he photographed in the atelier were a boy abacus seller, a milkmaid, a cooper, a glazier, buskers, a knife-grinder, a nurseryman, a glove seller, a chimney sweep, soldiers, and various armed Caucasians in national costume. Often classically posing his models, he gained renown for his evocation of dignity in labour. In addition he also took street scenes and travelled through the Russian provinces, notably to regions around the cities of Simbirsk (subsequently Ulyanovsk), Novgorod, Kostroma, Kazan, Nizhniy Novgorod, Yaroslavl, Tver, and, of course, St Petersburg, where he took numerous images of country life. Carrick thus pioneered Russian ethnographic photography, and left a great legacy of hundreds of photographs. Yet, in keeping with the Itinerants' principles for painting, these photographs were defined by an acute sensitivity to location and character, an unsentimentalized empathy with the people and the intrinsic qualities of their lives, and the ability to capture and subtly to convey the beauty of the mundane. His best-known set was a collection of albumen prints, <span class="italic">Peasant Characters from Simbirsk Province</span>, which he created in the early 1870s while staying on the estate of his friend Vice-Admiral Nikolay Sokovnin, a designer of unrealized airships. These and others were to be utilized by the Itinerants for their painterly depictions of peasant life.<br>
<br>As early as 1863 Carrick had begun a collaboration with Count Mihaly Zichy, a court painter in St Petersburg. Zichy, who had previously worked as a retoucher in Russia's first daguerreotype studio, commissioned Carrick to take photographs of his watercolours which were then to be sold as prints. This marked the start of Carrick's pioneering role in the development of the photographic reproduction of Russian art. His <span class="italic">Album of Russian Artists</span>, published posthumously in 1879, featured the work of such foremost Itinerant painters as Nikolay Ge, Ivan Kramskoy, and Viktor Vasnetsov.<br>
<br>In 1868, in a civil ceremony in St Petersburg, Carrick married Aleksandra Grigorievna Markelova (1832&#150;1916), a leading member of the populist movement and radical writer. The couple had two sons, Dmitry (<i>b</i>. 1867) and Valery (1869&#150;1943), the latter becoming a renowned caricaturist. Carrick also adopted Markelova's son from an earlier relationship, Grigory (1862&#150;1887?), and trained him in the photography of art.<br>
<br>Following MacGregor's death in 1872 Carrick moved to the Fifth Line of St Basil's Island, close to the Academy of Arts. He was appointed photographer of the academy in 1876 and given a studio in the academy building. His works were shown, to considerable acclaim, at the academy's exhibition of 1869, and the international exhibitions in London (1876) and Paris (1878). He died suddenly in St Petersburg, after an attack of pneumonia, on 11 November 1878.<br>
