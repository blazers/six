<span class="headword">Plumptre,  Henry</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1680, <em>d.</em> 1746), <span class="occ">physician</span>, born in Nottingham, was baptized at St Peter's, Nottingham, on 21 February 1680, the second son of Henry Plumptre (1644?&#150;1693), of Nottingham, and his second wife, Joyce (<i>d</i>. 1708), daughter of Henry Sacheverell of Barton, probably sister of William Sacheverell (1638&#150;1691), and widow of John Milward of Snitterton, Derbyshire. Plumptre's grandfather Huntingdon Plumptre was &#145;accounted the best physician at Nottingham&#146;, while <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22406/', "Robert Plumptre (1723&#150;1788)")</script> was his nephew.<br>
<br>Plumptre was admitted a pensioner of Queens' College, Cambridge, on 19 January 1698, and graduated BA in 1702, MA in 1705, and MD <i>per literas regias</i> in 1706. In that year he was among those appointed by the university to carry a complimentary letter to the University of Frankfurt am Main on the occasion of its jubilee. On 15 February 1703 he was elected fellow of his college, but vacated the office by not taking orders on 4 July 1707.<br>
<br>Plumptre was admitted a candidate of the Royal College of Physicians on 22 December 1707, and a fellow on 23 December 1708. He delivered the Goulstonian lectures in 1711 and the Harveian oration in 1722, and on 19 March 1733 was appointed Lumleian lecturer. He served as censor in 1717, 1722, 1723, and 1726, and as registrar from 1718 to 1722; he was appointed treasurer on 13 July 1725, and was consiliarius in 1735, 1738, and 1739. He was named an elect on 5 May 1727, and served as president for six years from 1740 to 1745. He was also physician at St Thomas's Hospital, London, a post he resigned in 1736. He died on 26 November 1746 of an ulcer in his bladder.<br>
<br>Plumptre was author of <span class="italic">Dissertatio medico-physica de Carolinis thermis</span> (1695), and of <span class="italic">Oratio anniversaria Harvaeana</span> (1722). He is also said to have written a pamphlet entitled <span class="italic">A Serious Conference between Scaramouch and Harlequin</span>, with reference to the controversy then raging between John Woodward and John Freind. He devoted much time and energy to the fifth <span class="italic">Pharmacopoeia Londinensis</span>, which appeared in 1746.<br>
<br>Henry Plumptre's son, <a name="cosubject_22407"></a><span class="headword">Russell Plumptre</span>  (1709&#150;1793), <span class="occ">physician</span>, born on 4 January 1709, was admitted pensioner of Queens' College, Cambridge, on 12 June 1728, and proceeded MB in 1733, and MD in 1738. He was admitted a candidate of the Royal College of Physicians on 30 September 1738, and fellow on 1 October 1739. He became a fellow of Queens' College, Cambridge, and in 1741 he was appointed regius professor of physic at Cambridge. He died in Cambridge on 15 October 1793.<br>
