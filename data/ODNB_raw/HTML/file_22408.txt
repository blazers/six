<span class="headword">Plumridge, Sir  James Hanway</span>  (1787&#150;1863), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, the son of James Plumridge of Littleworth, Berkshire, an architect in London, and his wife, the daughter of Mr Hanway, of Hertford Street, Mayfair, was born in Hertford Street, and educated at the naval academy, Chelsea. He entered the navy in September 1799 on board the sloop <i>Osprey</i> on the home station. He afterwards served in the <i>Leda</i> in the expedition to Egypt, with Captain George Hope, whom he followed to the <i>Defence</i>; in her he was present at the battle of Trafalgar. He was then for a few months in the <i>Melpomene</i> with Captain Peter Parker, and again with Hope in the <i>Theseus</i>. On 20 August 1806 he was promoted to the rank of lieutenant, and served throughout the war in various ships, including the <i>Melpomene</i> in 1809, the <i>Menelaus</i> in 1810 (again with Parker), and the <i>Caledonia</i>, as flag-lieutenant to Sir Edward Pellew. On 23 May 1809 the <i>Melpomene</i>, then becalmed in the Danish Strait, was attacked by twenty Danish gunboats. After an action lasting seven days the gunboats were driven off, but the ship was so severely damaged that she had to be sold out of the service. This incident left a lasting impression on Plumridge. On 7 June 1814 he was promoted to the command of the sloop <i>Crocus</i>, and in July he was appointed to the <i>Philomel</i>, in which he went to the East Indies. In 1817 he returned to England as acting captain of the <i>Amphitrite</i>. The promotion was not confirmed, and from 1818 to 1821 he commanded the brig <i>Sappho</i> at St Helena, and afterwards on the Irish station. In 1821 he married a daughter of Rear-Admiral Hart; she died on 31 July 1827.<br>
<br>Plumridge was advanced to post rank on 9 October 1822. From 1831 to 1835 he commanded the frigate <i>Magicienne</i> in the East Indies. In 1835 he married Harriet Agnes, daughter of the Rt Hon. H. Elliot, and they had children. She died on 17 April 1845. From 1837 to 1841 he was superintendent of the Falmouth packets, and from 1842 to 1847 was storekeeper of the ordnance. From 1841 to 1847 he was Liberal MP for Falmouth. In 1846&#150;7 he was seriously considered for a seat on the Board of Admiralty, but was not deemed sufficiently reliable politically. In 1847 he was appointed to the frigate <i>Cambrian</i>, for service in the East Indies, and on 13 October was ordered to wear a broad pennant as second in command on the station. In 1849 he married a daughter of Colonel Skinner of the Royal Artillery.<br>
<br>Plumridge returned to England towards the end of 1850, and on 7 October 1852 was promoted to be rear-admiral. In 1854, with his flag in the <i>Leopard</i>, he commanded the flying squadron in the Baltic, and especially in the Gulf of Bothnia. His predatory operations against Finnish towns along the Bothnian coast resulted in the destruction of large quantities of shipbuilding material, only part of which was owned by the Russian government, and even less of which was in process of being worked up into the gunboats he was seeking. On 10 June 1854 his forces received a severe repulse at Gamla Carleby, where they attempted to land out of sight of the ships. These operations provoked a storm of anti-British protest in Scandinavia and north Germany, and were little better received by the fleet: their notoriety, and the fact that Plumridge outranked the new commander-in-chief, Rear-Admiral Sir Richard Dundas, meant that he could not return to the Baltic in 1855.<br>
<br>In February 1855 Plumridge was appointed superintendent of the Devonport Dockyard, and on 5 July was nominated a KCB. In November 1857 he was promoted to be vice-admiral, and left the dockyard. He had no further service, and died at his home, Hopton Hall, near Lowestoft, Suffolk, on 29 November 1863.<br>
<br>Having earned his promotions through professional excellence alone, Plumridge was fortunate to obtain a sea-going command in wartime, but his misplaced zeal and lack of political weight brought his term to a premature end. In consequence, he returned to the administrative posts where he had spent most of his post-1815 service.<br>
