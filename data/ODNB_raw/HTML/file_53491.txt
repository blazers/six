<span class="headword">Paget, Sir  Augustus Berkeley</span>  (1823&#150;1896), <span class="occ">diplomatist</span>, the fourth son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21101/', "Sir Arthur Paget (1771&#150;1840)")</script>, diplomatist, and his wife, Augusta Jane, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Fane, was born on 16 April 1823. The father was the third son of the first earl of Uxbridge, and a brother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21112/', "Henry William Paget, first marquess of Anglesey")</script>, and of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21106/', "Sir Edward Paget")</script>. Augustus Paget was privately educated, and in 1840 entered the service of the crown as clerk in the secretary's department of the General Post Office, soon transferring to the Audit Office, and again on 21 August 1841 to the Foreign Office.<br>
<br>Paget then decided to enter the diplomatic service, and on 2 December 1843 was appointed temporary attach&eacute; at Madrid, where he remained until 1846. On 6 February 1846 he was appointed pr&eacute;cis writer to the foreign secretary, Lord Aberdeen, but on 26 June became second paid attach&eacute; to the British embassy at Paris. Here he witnessed the <i>coup d'&eacute;tat</i> of 1848, and the establishment of the Second Empire; on 18 December 1851 he became first paid attach&eacute;. On 12 February 1852 he was promoted to be secretary of legation at Athens at a time when diplomatic relations with Greece were more or less in abeyance, so that his position was peculiar and required much tact. From the end of the same year, Paget succeeded to a number of important diplomatic posts: in Egypt (1852&#150;3); The Hague (1854&#150;7); Lisbon (1857&#150;8); Berlin (1858&#150;9); and Copenhagen (1859&#150;66). He was created CB on 10 February and KCB on 16 March 1863.<br>
<br>As minister at Copenhagen, Paget saw the accession of Christian IX at the close of 1863, and had to play a leading part with respect to the Schleswig-Holstein difficulty in 1864; nor was his position much less difficult when in 1866 Prussia meditated war against Austria. On 9 June 1866 he was sent to Portugal as envoy-extraordinary. Appointed on 6 July 1867 to Italy as envoy-extraordinary and minister-plenipotentiary to Victor Emmanuel, he represented Great Britain in Italy during one of the most critical periods of Italian history; he saw the entry of the Italian troops into Rome and the beginning of a new era of national life there. In that trying period his tact was conspicuous. He remained in Italy for a long time, becoming ambassador-extraordinary on 24 March 1876, the same year in which he was sworn of the privy council in London. On 12 September 1883 he relinquished his post in Rome and, after a short period of leave, became ambassador at Vienna on 1 January 1884. From that post he retired on 1 July 1893. He devoted much of the leisure which now came to him to the preparation of his father's memoirs, <span class="italic">The Paget Papers</span> (2 vols., 1898).<br>
<br>On 20 October 1860, Paget married the <a name="cosubject_53491"></a><span class="headword">Countess Walpurga Ehrengarde Helena  de Hohenthal</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1929)<span class="occ"></span>, eldest daughter of Charles Frederick Anthony de Hohenthal, count of the Austrian empire. They had two sons and a daughter. Lady Paget was maid of honour to Queen Victoria's eldest daughter, Princess Victoria, crown princess of Prussia, who called her &#145;Wally&#146;, finding her, at least in 1869, &#145;prettier than ever &hellip; but I regret that she is a little affected and grand sometimes&#146;  (<span class="italic">Your dear letter</span>, 248). The princess thought Lady Paget and her husband unsuited for Vienna, where &#145;she is not likely to be well or cordially received&#146; and regretted the &#145;36 naked little boys and girls&#146; with which she decorated the embassy  (<span class="italic">Beloved mama</span>, 157). Lady Paget entertainingly recorded embassy life in <span class="italic">Embassies of other Days</span> (2 vols., 1923) and other books. A woman of progressive views, she was a vegetarian and an anti-vivisectionist; she also wrote an introduction for <span class="italic">Talks about Girls</span> (1905) in the <span class="roman">Kirk Sex Series</span>.<br>
<br>Augustus Paget died suddenly on 11 July 1896 while visiting Lord Salisbury at Hatfield House. He was buried at Tardebigge, Bromsgrove.<br>
