<span class="headword">Marshal,  Richard</span>, sixth earl of Pembroke  (<em>d.</em> 1234), <span class="occ">magnate and courtier</span>, lord of Leinster, Longueville, and Orbec, was born in the early 1190s, the second son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18126/', "William (I) Marshal, earl of Pembroke and Striguil")</script>, regent of England, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/47208/', "Isabel de Clare")</script>, daughter and eventual heir of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5447/', "Richard de Clare (Strongbow)")</script> and his wife, Eva, daughter of Diarmait Mac Murchadha, king of Leinster. First mentioned in 1203, Richard Marshal occasionally appeared in the background of the great events of King John's reign in which his father participated. In 1207, when relations between the king and Earl William were deteriorating and the earl wished to visit his Irish lands, King John, who already held the earl's eldest son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18127/', "William (II) Marshal")</script>, as a hostage, demanded Richard as a second surety for his father's behaviour. Except for a short interval Richard remained in royal custody until 1212. In 1214 he accompanied King John on the disastrous Poitevin expedition and nearly died from sickness there. He is not known to have participated in the baronial wars of 1215&#150;17; indeed, at his father's death in May 1219 he was at the court of King Philip Augustus of France, where he was probably preparing to inherit the Marshal lands in Normandy.<br>
<br>After the death of Richard's mother, Isabel, in 1220, her eldest son, William (II) Marshal, ceded these Norman lands to his brother Richard. After paying a heavy relief to Philip Augustus, Richard Marshal thus became the lord of the Norman honours of Longueville-sur-Scie and Orbec, and until 1231 he was primarily a French nobleman. In November 1226, for instance, after the sudden death of Louis VIII, the regency council of France wrote to him and ten other leading Norman nobles, appealing to them to aid the accession and coronation of the young Louis IX. One English annalist said that Richard was the marshal of the French royal army, another that he learned the skills of warfare in French battles. Moreover, about 1222 Richard married Gervaise (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1239), daughter and heir of Alain de Dinan (<i>d</i>. 1198), one of the greatest nobles of Brittany; Gervaise was also the widow of Juhel de Mayenne, the greatest nobleman in Maine, and of another great Breton noble, Geoffroi, vicomte de Rohan. Such a match raised Richard to an important position in Brittany, and in May 1225 he was present at a great gathering of the Breton nobles with their duke, Pierre Mauclerc, at Nantes.<br>
<br>Yet at the same time Richard Marshal continued to hold his mother's manor of Long Crendon, Buckinghamshire, and he successfully claimed the manors of Ringwood, Hampshire, and Burton Latimer, Northamptonshire, to which Gervaise de Dinan had long-standing claims. To hold lands in England and France simultaneously was a mark of royal favour to his family, which Richard exploited to secure privileges in England for Norman merchants. However, continuing Anglo-French hostility created political difficulties at times for Richard and embarrassed his elder brother, William (II) Marshal. During the Anglo-French war of 1224&#150;7 Richard's English manors were taken into royal hands for a while. Fresh problems arose when Henry III landed in Brittany in May 1230 and occupied Richard's castle of Dinan. Richard appears to have had some initial involvement in the English expedition, but he earned the hostility of Henry III because he did not renounce his allegiance to the king of France.<br>
<br>When William (II) Marshal died in England at Easter 1231, Richard Marshal was at the Norman exchequer in Rouen, and Henry III at first prevented his succession to the Marshal lands, warning the port bailiffs to refuse him entry into England. In view of Richard's French fealty, this was a natural precaution; but according to Wendover, when he came to England to seek his inheritance, Hubert de Burgh, the justiciar, encouraged King Henry to spurn his offer of homage and to order him to leave England at once. Undaunted, the Marshal roused his family's followers in Ireland and Pembrokeshire into revolt, so forcing the king to accept his succession. This story should be treated with some caution. Certainly the king felt constrained to justify his confiscation of the Marshal lands in a letter to the barons of Ireland; but in the same letter he accepted that Richard Marshal was the rightful heir of William (II) Marshal. The good offices of the priory of Notley and the earl of Chester secured a safe conduct for Richard Marshal to come to the king in late June, and the king invested him as earl of Pembroke and lord of Leinster early in August. From then until his death Richard Marshal was at the heart of English politics.<br>
<br>In November 1232 the Marshal was one of four earls assigned to guard the now disgraced Hubert de Burgh at Devizes Castle. The king also conferred the manor and hundred of Awre, Gloucestershire, upon the Marshal. Yet the harmony between the king and the Marshal was short-lived. Richard put up some resistance to providing sufficient dower for his brother's widow, Eleanor, the king's sister; he eventually agreed to pay her the crippling sum of &pound;400 a year for her dower rights in Ireland and south Wales, but by June 1233 he was defaulting on payments. By then the king had fallen under the influence of the bishop of Winchester, Peter des Roches, and his kinsman Peter de Rivallis. From Christmas 1232 these so-called &#145;Poitevins&#146; and the new justiciar, Stephen of Seagrave, seemed to be monopolizing the distribution of royal patronage, and among the officials they ousted was William of Rowden, Richard Marshal's deputy marshal at court. Throughout the spring of 1233 tensions were rising between the Poitevins and members of the Marshal's affinity, particularly Gilbert Basset and his brothers and Richard Siward; and the Marshal was drawn, probably against his will, into armed protest and eventually a calamitous revolt. Some English chroniclers chose to portray Richard Marshal, hitherto a French nobleman, as a champion of English liberties against the king's foreign counsellors. Yet the revolt was not a struggle between the &#145;natural-born&#146; barons and &#145;alien&#146; favourites of Henry III, nor was it a constitutional dispute, although the king's disregard of the rule of law served to stoke the rebellion. Rather, it was a factional conflict over patronage and access to the king, and the descent into war was a startling indication of the mistrust that had built up at court against the king's advisers.<br>
<br>By mid-June Gilbert Basset was in arms against the king. On 9 July Richard Marshal, Basset, and Richard Siward are said to have retired in anger from the royal court because the king had denied justice to Basset and Siward. There are conflicting accounts of what happened next. Wendover claimed that before 1 August the Marshal fled to Wales, warned by his sister, the countess of Cornwall, that his enemies were plotting to have him arrested at court; he rebelled and the king ordered the destruction of his property and formally &#145;defied&#146; him (renounced the ties of lordship). More likely, the Marshal was not yet prepared to lead an open revolt. He attempted to organize an armed gathering at Gilbert Basset's manor of Wycombe, Buckinghamshire, in early August, but most sympathizers recoiled from the brink of revolt, leaving the Marshal isolated outside the Welsh marches. In mid-August, when the king was still so unaware of this simmering discontent that he was preparing to go to Ireland, the Marshal's more ardent followers seized the castles of Hay and Ewyas Lacy, and Basset and Siward renounced their homage to the king. In reply Henry III turned upon the Marshal, confiscating his English manors and besieging his castle at Usk. The Marshal had no choice but to make terms, giving pledges for faithful service on 8 September.<br>
<br>The first phase of the conflict was over, although the Marshal was by now at war with Morgan ap Hywel of Caerleon, his family's traditional enemy. A settlement with the king and court might have been within reach, but the Bassets and Siward remained outlawed, raiding the estates of the bishop of Winchester with particular glee&#151;and possibly with the Marshal's connivance. Meanwhile, no doubt mistrusting the intentions of the king and his counsellors and lacking active support from the English baronage, the Marshal negotiated an alliance with Llywelyn ab Iorwerth, reversing his family's former hostility to the Welsh prince. In early October, perhaps to appease his still outlawed followers and fearful of royal support for Morgan, the Marshal launched a campaign to seize Glamorgan. In response King Henry ordered the confiscation of all the Marshal's English castles and manors on 18 October, and their destruction ten days later. As open war erupted along the marches, the daring rescue of Hubert de Burgh from Devizes on 29 October by Siward and the Bassets served only to deepen King Henry's fury. Henry, who by then had certainly &#145;defied&#146; the Marshal, gathered an army at Hereford and invaded the Marshal lands in south Wales.<br>
<br>The desperate rebels successfully held the royalists at bay, though they could not hope for victory. On the evening of 11 November the Marshal's Welshmen surprised the royal forces at Grosmont, Herefordshire, and succeeded, it was said, in stealing 500 packhorses, the Marshal refusing to attack the king himself. Although Richard narrowly escaped capture during a bloody skirmish outside Monmouth on 25 November, another ambush against the royal army on 26 December prevented further royal advances. Early in January 1234 the Marshal and Llywelyn devastated Shropshire and even burnt part of Shrewsbury; but the next month some of their allies were repulsed with heavy loss from Carmarthen. From Welsh bases, meanwhile, Siward and the Bassets continued to plunder their enemies' manors in England with impunity until May. King Henry's fury knew no bounds, and he demanded that the Marshal should come to him with a rope round his neck to plead for mercy. But the two sides had in reality reached a stalemate; and the English and Welsh bishops, who had already tried to intervene in the autumn of 1233, now stepped into the breach. In February 1234, led by Edmund of Abingdon, archbishop-elect of Canterbury, the bishops told the king that only the removal of the bishop of Winchester and his allies from his counsels would end the crisis. The king eventually yielded, and a truce with Richard Marshal and Llywelyn was arranged late in March; this heralded the fall from grace of the Poitevins and Seagrave in April.<br>
<br>Meanwhile, however, war had broken out in Ireland between the Marshal's brothers and the partisans of the king, including the justiciar of Ireland, Maurice Fitzgerald, the Lacys, and Richard de Burgh. So Richard Marshal crossed to Ireland in February or March to retrieve the situation. There disaster overtook him. On 1 April 1234 he met his enemies in open battle in the Curragh, a plain near Kildare; he was defeated and captured, and died from his wounds in his castle at Kilkenny on 16 April, while the victors divided his lands. Such are the bare details recorded in the Irish sources; but, owing to the popularity of the Marshal and the cause with which he was associated, the English and Welsh chroniclers retold his death as a heroic epic, and it is impossible to separate the truth of the affair from the literary motifs which immediately became attached to the event. Richard Marshal, it was said, was tricked into attending a parley on the Curragh by Geoffrey Marsh, who was secretly in league with Fitzgerald; but the royalists came not to confer but to fight, while Marsh and all the Marshal's Irish knights deserted their lord. Richard could have escaped, but he preferred to fight and &#145;die with honour for the sake of justice&#146;  (<span class="italic">Flores historiarum</span>, 3, 84) than to turn tail upon his enemies. He had a mere 15 faithful marcher knights whereas his enemies numbered 140: he fought on until almost alone, when he was mortally wounded from behind, taken prisoner, and borne stricken to his castle. An inept or treacherous surgeon caused the wound to fester, and he died. He was buried at Kilkenny, either in the Dominican convent founded by his brother or, less probably, the Franciscan convent.<br>
<br>The news of Richard Marshal's death shocked the English court and compounded the disgrace of the Poitevins. Henry III was reported to have bemoaned his passing like David mourning Saul and Jonathan; and the story soon spread that the Poitevins had forged the royal letters that had provoked the Irish war. But the king's true attitude is more clearly revealed in the gratitude he expressed to the Marshal's killers for their resistance to the earl, and in the heavy pledges and ransoms which he took from the Marshal's Irish supporters, including Geoffrey Marsh, who was nothing more than a convenient scapegoat for the chroniclers.<br>
<br>Richard Marshal was held in almost universal esteem by contemporary writers, not only for his courage in arms but also for his refinement and erudition, as his friendship with Robert Grosseteste demonstrates. Matthew Paris called him &#145;the flower of knighthood in our times&#146;  (Paris, <span class="italic">Chron</span>., 3.289). In part the Marshal was singled out for such repeated praise because he seemed to be the &#145;native-born&#146; champion whom contemporary writers keenly pitted against the hated &#145;aliens&#146;, notwithstanding the Marshal's own French career and connections. Yet his violent death in an essentially factional struggle should not obscure his undoubted abilities, which reminded contemporaries forcefully of his great father; it was Richard Marshal's misfortune that events were simply too much for him. He was also a benefactor of a number of religious houses in Normandy, Brittany, England, and Ireland.<br>
<br>Richard Marshal died childless, but his brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18121/', "Gilbert Marshal")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18127/', "Marshal, William (II), fifth earl of Pembroke")</script>] was permitted to inherit the earldom of Pembroke and the other Marshal lands in England, the Welsh marches, and Ireland. The family never recovered its lands in Normandy, which Louis IX had seized on Richard's death.<br>
