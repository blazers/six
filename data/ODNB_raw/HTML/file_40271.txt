<span class="headword">Hartley <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Laffan]</span>,  Mary <span class="st"> [May]</span></span>  (<em>c.</em>1850&#150;1916), <span class="occ">novelist and short-story writer</span>, was born in Dublin, the elder daughter of Michael Laffan, custom house officer of Blackrock, co. Dublin, and his wife, Ellen Fitzgibbon, who was related to <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9594/', "Gerald Fitzgibbon (1793&#150;1882)")</script>. Not much of her earlier life is known. The family was Catholic and probably middle-class, and she was brought up in Blackrock and educated at a convent school. Throughout her life she seems to have been called May rather than Mary.<br>
<br>May Laffan began publishing anonymously in June 1874 with an attack on her Catholic education in an essay in <span class="italic">Fraser's</span>. Her first novel, <span class="italic">Hogan, M.P.</span> (1876), the story of the rise and fall of a political opportunist, gave a detailed and satirical insight into Dublin society. It also strongly criticized Catholic education as detrimental to social climbing, leading to petty intrigues, social manoeuvres, gossip, and scandal. One reviewer commented that:<blockquote>if instead of refined, delicate and pungent satire, there is too much of rather broad and coarse caricature in the filling up, still we must admit that the descriptions generally have truth and point, more especially in the sketches of society &hellip; (<span class="italic">Dublin University Magazine</span>)</blockquote>Apparently the book caused a stir in Dublin, since it dealt with contemporary events, and it was assumed that it had been written by a man.<br>
<br>Laffan's next novel, <span class="italic">The Hon. Miss Ferrard</span> (1877), was an attack on a typical Irish middle-class household, exposing its vulgarity, pretension, and extravagance. In <span class="italic">Christy Carew</span> (1878) she criticized the Catholic church's discouragement of mixed marriages. <span class="italic">Flitters, Tatters and the Counsellor</span> (1879) contained four stories: the first two about Dublin slum children, the third about Glasgow slum life, and the last about conspiracy and murder in a county district. These stories are characterized by their social realism, and show the brutalizing effect of poverty and slum life. It is her most acclaimed work (John Ruskin admired it) and went through three Irish editions before being published in England. The Tauchnitz edition of 1881 had three extra stories. &#145;The Game Hen&#146; and &#145;Baubie Clark&#146; had been published separately in 1880. In 1880 Laffan produced <span class="italic">No Relations</span>, a translation of a French novel by Hector Malat.<br>
<br>On 4 July 1882 May Laffan married a protestant, Walter Noel Hartley (1846&#150;1913), the distinguished professor of chemistry at the Royal College of Science in Dublin who was knighted for his services to science in 1911. When he lectured at King's College, London, the couple lived in London. May Hartley published <span class="italic">A Singer's Story</span> in 1885. Her last novel was <span class="italic">Ismay's Children</span> (1887), a fictional account of the lives of a group of men who join the Fenian movement.<br>
<br>Hartley was described as &#145;a most witty and delightful woman&#146;  (<span class="italic">Irish Book Lover</span>). But she suddenly stopped publishing, probably because of public anger about and strong clerical opposition to her criticism of the Catholic education system and her support for mixed marriages. There were also rumours of a nervous breakdown and a separation from her husband. The obituaries in <span class="italic">The Times</span> and <span class="italic">Irish Times</span> for Sir Walter, who died on 11 September 1913 at Braemar, did not mention his family at all, which does point to an estrangement. However, an unpublished memorandum on education from about 1895 shows that she continued writing.<br>
<br>Mary Hartley died on 23 June 1916 at her home, 10 Elgin Road, Dublin, shortly after her only son was killed at Gallipoli. The death notice in the <span class="italic">Irish Times</span> declared that the funeral was private. It did not mention her literary achievements, and there was no obituary. It seems that the life and work of this powerful social critic of Irish Catholic life had already been forgotten, and some ninety years later her works continued to be neglected by writers on Irish literature.<br>
