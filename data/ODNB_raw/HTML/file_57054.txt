<span class="headword">Enthoven <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Romaine]</span>,  (Augusta) Gabrielle Eden</span>  (1868&#150;1950), <span class="occ">theatre archivist and playwright</span>, was born at 21 New Street, Spring Gardens, Westminster, London, on 12 January 1868, the daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/24037/', "William Govett Romaine (1815&#150;1893)")</script>, secretary to the Admiralty, and his wife, Frances Phoebe, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Tennant (1822/3&#150;1909). Her father, a barrister and public administrator, went on to serve in India and Egypt, where his family accompanied him on his postings until his retirement in 1879, when they returned to Britain and settled near Windsor. There Gabrielle Romaine attended garden parties, regattas, dinner parties, and balls. She also took part in theatricals and was a member of several amateur societies including the Windsor Strollers and the Old Stagers. From an early age she wrote plays, stories, and scenarios. In later life she reminisced about being invited to Windsor Castle to play with Princess Mary of Teck and of once having slapped the young princess  (Enthoven biographical file, V&amp;A). A friend of Oscar Wilde, she recorded the stories which he told her between 1890 and 1893, and had a limited edition of the stories privately printed under the title <span class="italic">Echoes</span>. These versions of the stories, and variations on them, subsequently appeared in <span class="italic">The Mask</span>, the magazine published by her friend Edward Gordon Craig, and were later reprinted in Vyvyan Holland's <span class="italic">Son of Oscar Wilde</span> (1954).<br>
<br>She married on 28 December 1893 Charles Henfrey Enthoven (1866&#150;1910), a captain in the Royal Engineers; he was the son of James Henry Enthoven, metal merchant. They moved to Cadogan Gardens, London, where she entertained with style. Soon after her marriage she:<blockquote>began pasting up in scrapbooks various press cuttings dealing with the theatre. The idea of starting a collection of playbills came into my head when I purchased a quantity of them, two hundred I think, from a naval officer which was the foundation of my collection. (Enthoven biographical file, V&amp;A)</blockquote>Her husband, who served as a general staff officer at the War Office, retired with the rank of major early in 1910, and was appointed chief officer of the London county council parks department, but died shortly afterwards. There were no children of the marriage.<br>
<br>After her husband's death Enthoven's collecting and theatrical endeavours gathered pace. She appeared as a graduate in <span class="italic">A Pageant of Great Women</span> produced by the Actresses' Franchise League. In 1911 she became a founding member and president of the Pioneer Players, a feminist theatre company that aimed to present plays of &#145;interest and ideas&#146; that dealt with current social, political, and moral issues. That year she launched a campaign to establish a national collection for the performing arts. Writing to <span class="italic">The Observer</span>, she outlined a scheme for:<blockquote>a comprehensive theatrical section in an existing museum to comprise specimens of all the different branches necessary to the workings of a play from the construction of the theatre, the designing of the scenery and costumes, to the smallest workings necessary in the house. (Rogers, xii)</blockquote>In 1912 Enthoven had her first play, <span class="italic">Montmartre</span>, produced at the Alhambra. In 1916, <span class="italic">Ellen Young</span>, which she wrote with Edmund Goulding, was produced by the Pioneer Players at the Savoy to good reviews.<br>
<br>At the outbreak of the First World War, Enthoven undertook war work in addition to her theatre activities. From August 1914 to December 1915 she was chief of records for the War Refugees Committee, a voluntary body which organized the reception of mainly Belgian refugees fleeing mainland Europe. From the end of 1915 she was with the Red Cross, and became chief of the records department of its Central Prisoners of War and Missing Persons Committee, dealing with British prisoners of war held by the central powers. She left the Red Cross in August 1920 because of ill health and was awarded an OBE in recognition of her services.<br>
<br>By 1921 Enthoven was in America, where she lived in Manhattan with Cecile Sartoris, co-adapter and translator of Gabriele d'Annunzio's <span class="italic">The Honeysuckle</span>, produced at the Lyceum Theatre, New York, in that year. The couple had a studio in Washington Square and offered a free room to No&euml;l Coward, who was trying to make his name in America. Coward recalled that the three of them were very poor and often &#145;dined quietly in pyjamas&#146;  (Coward, 122). By 1923 she was back in London, and executed one of her proudest achievements, bringing over the great Italian actress Eleonora Duse to England for her last engagement.<br>
<br>In 1924 Enthoven crowned this by finally persuading the Victoria and Albert Museum to accept her collection of more than 50,000 playbills, prints, books, and engravings in order to establish a national collection of the performing arts. With characteristic determination and generosity she established herself in an office in the V&amp;A with the collection and continued to pay for acquisitions and staff from her own funds. Her connections with theatrical society in London and New York proved invaluable in providing material and spreading word of the collection's permanent home.<br>
<br>Enthoven was at the centre of a smart London lesbian set, and was associated particularly with Edith Craig, Mercedes de Acosta, and Radclyffe Hall, though the latter apparently ended her friendship with Enthoven for &#145;repudiating her own kind when it is opportune to do so&#146;  (Souhami, 167). The abject failure of an adaptation of Colette's <span class="italic">Ch&eacute;ri</span> (1930) by Hall's partner Una Vincent Troubridge, in which Enthoven played the leading role, also contributed to the end of the friendship.<br>
<br>Despite being repudiated by Hall and Troubridge, Enthoven was generally regarded as kind and generous. George Nash, who succeeded her as the theatre curator at the V&amp;A, noted her bluff kindness to staff of all grades within the museum, except those she considered inattentive or lazy. After the depression she thought herself too poor to take a taxi to the museum and so walked in all weathers, but continued to lavish gifts on staff and friends. On the outbreak of the Second World War she returned to the War Office to head the records department of the Central Prisoners of War. She died at her home, 99 Cadogan Gardens, Chelsea, London, on 18 August 1950. Her will, in which she bequeathed artworks and money to a long list of friends and staff, stipulated &#145;that my body shall be cremated without the celebration of any funeral service in the cheapest possible manner as my Trustees shall decide&#146;, to maximize the amount to be left to the V&amp;A to continue cataloguing and acquiring material for the theatre collection.<br>
