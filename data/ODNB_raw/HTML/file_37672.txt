<span class="headword">Lewis,  James</span>  (1750/51&#150;1820), <span class="occ">architect</span>, was probably born in Brecon in south Wales. In 1770, at the age of nineteen, he went to Italy, and a volume of drawings of friezes, urns, and classical ornaments which he made in Rome is preserved in the Paul Mellon collection. He later told the diarist Joseph Farington that he had become well acquainted with Piranesi, and that while abroad he had kept a journal written in Italian but had subsequently destroyed it because he was embarrassed by its poor linguistic quality. After returning to Britain in December 1772, he exhibited at the Society of Artists from 1774 to 1778 and his first recorded employment&#151;minor work in London&#151;belongs to this period; then in 1779&#150;80 he published a volume of <span class="italic">Original Designs in Architecture, Consisting of Plans &hellip; for Villas, Mansions, Town Houses</span>, which was evidently intended as an advertisement for his talents, and thereafter he developed a modestly successful practice mainly as a country house architect in the south-east of England. In 1797 he published a second volume of designs which, in contrast to the first, included a significant proportion of executed projects, the product of this practice.<br>
<br>In 1792, however, Lewis was elected surveyor to Christ's Hospital and in the following year he was appointed to the corresponding post at the Bridewell and Bethlem hospitals: from then on these institutional responsibilities appear to have formed the principal element in his career. For Christ's Hospital he designed the new grammar school (1793; dem.)&#151;receiving a gratuity of 100 guineas &#145;for his great attention during the building&#146; because he had charged at a rate of only two and a half per cent instead of the usual five per cent&#151;and additions to the school in Hertford (1800), and also made designs for various ambitious unexecuted schemes for redeveloping the main buildings.<br>
<br>Regarding the Bethlem Hospital, in 1810 a competition was held for designs for a new hospital in St George's Fields, Southwark; in the event none of the entries which gained the premiums was actually adopted, and instead Lewis was instructed to incorporate their best features in a new design of his own. The result, erected in 1812&#150;15, was Lewis's largest undertaking. His best work, however, lies in the products of his private practice, in the series of houses such as Bletchingdon Park, Oxfordshire (1782), Eydon Hall, Northamptonshire (1788&#150;9), Lavington Park, Sussex (1790&#150;94), and Hackthorn Hall, Lincolnshire (1793&#150;5), which are elegant neo-classical versions of the Palladian villa form, with interior decoration in the manner of Robert Adam.<br>
<br>Lewis was one of the fifteen original members of the Architects' Club, founded in 1791. Persistent ill health induced him to give up the surveyorship at Christ's Hospital in January 1816 and that of the Bethlem Hospital the following year. To his two sons and two daughters he left a &#145;good fortune&#146;, and he died in Powis Place, London, on 16 July 1820.<br>
