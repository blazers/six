<span class="headword">Fagg,  William <span class="st"> [Bill]</span>  Buller</span>  (1914&#150;1992), <span class="occ">ethnologist and art historian</span>, was born on 28 April 1914 at 24 St Aubyn's Road, Upper Norwood, London, the elder son and first of two children of William Percy Fagg (<i>d</i>. 1939), antiquarian bookseller, and his wife, Lilian, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Buller. He attended nearby Dulwich College and then went to Magdalene College, Cambridge, where he studied classics (1933&#150;6) and archaeology and anthropology (1936&#150;7), obtaining two BA degrees and prizes for Latin hexameters and epigrams.<br>
<br>In 1938 Fagg started work as an assistant keeper in the ethnography department of the British Museum, which employed him until he retired, save for the wartime years 1940&#150;45, when he monitored corduroy output for the industries and manufactures department of the Board of Trade. At the close of the war, when the British Museum reconstructed its exhibitions, the ethnography department decided that individual curators should take responsibility for the collections from specific continents. Africa was assigned to Fagg, probably because none of his superiors wanted it. As he reviewed the artefacts coming out of storage to choose the best for display, however, he developed a deep love for African art that led to his lifelong immersion in its study. West Africa had produced masterpieces of sculpture, he felt, whose greatness deserved acclaim without qualification. They received from him the kind of scholarly attention hitherto reserved for European works. One of his first concerns, indeed, was to establish that some of the finest examples were of purely African inspiration and execution. Seized during the British punitive expedition of 1897, the Benin bronzes in the British Museum appeared so sophisticated that European experts had tried to argue that the Edo-speakers who created them must have been influenced by the Portuguese. Fagg devised a chronology of the Benin treasures that represented the first serious attempt to classify African art historically and stylistically.<br>
<br>Fagg led a quiet home life with his widowed mother in the suburb of Barnes, whence he cycled to the museum in Bloomsbury each day. He grew friendly with artists such as Jacob Epstein, Fred Uhlman, and Josef Herman, who shared his admiration for African art, and Leon Underwood taught him the practicalities of lost-wax casting, the process most often used in Africa. While accumulating an encyclopaedic knowledge of tribal pieces in other museums and private collections, he also secured much fresh information from fieldwork. The great majority of African sculptures surviving from past centuries came from Nigeria, so it was there that his endeavours were concentrated&#151;with visits in 1949&#150;50, 1953, 1958&#150;9, 1971, 1974, and 1981&#151;though his research also took him to the Belgian Congo, Mali, and Cameroon. His brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/67869/', "Bernard Fagg (1915&#150;1987)")</script>, a colonial service official, founded the first museums in Nigeria and then headed the federal department of antiquities in Lagos (1957&#150;63). Bill aimed to identify the distinctive artistic styles, not merely of various tribes, but of villages, workshops, and individuals. Among the artists whose output he recorded were Bamgboye of Odo-Owa, Areogun of Osi-Ilorin, and, above all, Olowe of Ise (<i>c</i>.1875&#150;1938), sculptor to the kings of Yorubaland. Where no name could be ascertained, he devised sobriquets which became widely accepted, such as the Master of the Buli or the Master of the Circled Cross.<br>
<br>Promoted to deputy keeper of the ethnographical collections at the British Museum in 1955, Fagg was a long-standing member of the Royal Anthropological Institute, serving as honorary secretary (1939&#150;56) and vice-president (1963&#150;73) as well as meticulously editing its journal <span class="italic">Man</span> from 1945 until 1965. The controversies that divided British anthropologists did not greatly exercise him, though the separation of physical and social anthropology into discrete disciplines seemed to him undesirable. He judged it the role of scholars to appreciate the achievements of other cultures as well as to analyse them: connoisseurship need never conflict with social science. He sought to place African art within the context of African social history.<br>
<br>Fagg was a portly, bespectacled man with blunt, heavy features. The marked slowness of his utterance concealed his intelligence from strangers (and this had nothing to do with the mild stroke that he suffered in 1967). There was an air of torpor about him which could prove downright exasperating for people of vigorous temperament, along with his habit of whistling classical music. A dull lecturer, he came across best at small gatherings, where he enjoyed sharing his expertise in unhurried conversation. His interests included literature and religion. He was a practising Roman Catholic.<br>
<br>A late riser by preference, Fagg wrote his articles and books at night, slowly and eloquently, making use of his large collection of photographs. <span class="italic">The Sculpture of Africa</span> (1958), <span class="italic">Afro-Portuguese Ivories</span> (1959), and <span class="italic">Nigerian Images</span> (1963) earned him recognition as the principal English-speaking authority on African sculpture. In 1960 he organized an exhibition for the Arts Council to mark Nigerian independence, and his contribution in 1966 to the First World Congress of Negro Arts and Cultures held in Dakar, Senegal, led to his being appointed CMG in 1967. The Museum of Primitive Art in New York (later part of the Metropolitan Museum) engaged him as a consulting fellow (1957&#150;70), and other major museums invited him to weed out fakes and &#145;tourist art&#146; from their holdings.<br>
<br>Fagg was keeper of the ethnography department of the British Museum from 1969 to 1974. With the help of Bryan Cranstone (1918&#150;1989), his deputy, he oversaw its full relocation to 6 Burlington Gardens, off Piccadilly, where it reopened in 1972 as the Museum of Mankind. There it was possible to present changing exhibitions in specially made &#145;environments&#146;, starting with one of Benin art, set in a partial reconstruction of the Benin palace.<br>
<br>After his retirement in 1974 Fagg acted as a consultant for Christies auction house until 1990. Unlike some museum curators, he had never shown any antagonism towards private collectors. He did insist, though, that catalogues refer to &#145;tribal art&#146; rather than &#145;primitive art&#146;. His last major publication was <span class="italic">Africa and the Renaissance: Art in Ivory</span> (1988), written with Ezio Bassani to accompany a display at the Center for African Art in New York. He died of a cerebral thrombosis at his home, 6 Galata Road, Barnes, London, on 10 July 1992. He was unmarried.<br>
<br>Fagg received some criticism from younger scholars for his adherence to the concept of tribality and his readiness to make &#145;objective&#146; aesthetic pronouncements. It was natural that the pioneer should be challenged by his successors, but nobody disputed his status as an originator of the systematic study of African art.<br>
