<div class="para">
<span class="headword">O'Neill,  Terence Marne</span>, Baron O'Neill of the Maine  (1914&#150;1990), <span class="occ">prime minister of Northern Ireland</span>, was born on 10 September 1914 at 29 Ennismore Gardens, Hyde Park, London, the third son and youngest of the five children of Captain Arthur Edward Bruce O'Neill (1876&#150;1914), of Shane's Castle, Randalstown, co. Antrim, Unionist MP for Mid-Antrim, and his wife, Lady Annabel Hungerford Crewe-Milnes (1881&#150;1948), the eldest daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32628/', "Robert Offley Ashburton Crewe-Milnes, marquess of Crewe")</script>, politician. His maternal grandfather was of Liberal stock, and was appointed viceroy of Ireland in 1892 by Gladstone's pro-home rule administration. His paternal grandfather, Edward Chichester, later O'Neill, second Baron O'Neill, was Conservative MP for co. Antrim from 1863 to 1880. O'Neill was less than two months old when his father became the first MP to be killed in action in the First World War, on 6 November 1914. His mother married, second, on 9 February 1922, Major James Hugh Hamilton Dodds, later Crewe (<i>d</i>. 1956), a consular official.<br>
<br>After quitting active politics, O'Neill made much of his Gaelic heritage, both out of pride in lineage and to indicate a special rapport with Northern Ireland's Catholics. Indeed, the dynasty of O'Neill could be traced back to a Tyrone prince killed in battle in 1283, and by tradition the line included Niall of the Nine Hostages, high king of Ireland from <i>c</i>.379 to <i>c</i>.409. O'Neill, however, was descended through an heiress from a protestant branch of O'Neills which had retained its estates and found a place in plantation Ulster after the &#145;flight of the earls&#146; in 1607; furthermore, in the male line he was descended from the settler family of Chichester.<br>
<br>O'Neill spent his youth in London and the British consulate in Addis Ababa. He was educated at West Downs School, in Winchester, and at Eton College. Thereafter he spent a year in France and Germany, and then found work in the City of London and, briefly, South Australia. Only summer holidays were spent in Shane's Castle, the family home in Ulster. In May 1940 O'Neill received his commission at Sandhurst and joined the 2nd battalion of the Irish Guards. While waiting for the invasion of Europe, on 4 February 1944 he married <a href="#cosubject_99433">(Katharine) Jean Whitaker [<i>see below</i>]</a>. They had one son, Patrick (<i>b</i>. 1945), and one daughter, Penelope (<i>b</i>. 1947). Once in Europe O'Neill served as intelligence officer of the 2nd battalion. In September 1944, near Nijmegen in the Netherlands, he was injured during shelling and evacuated back to England. Friends close to him died in action, including David Peel, best man at his wedding, as well as both his brothers, Shane Edward Robert O'Neill, third Baron O'Neill (1907&#150;1944), and Brian Arthur O'Neill (1911&#150;1940).<br>
<br>At the end of 1945 O'Neill and his family finally went to live in Northern Ireland, in Glebe House, a converted Regency rectory near Ahoghill, co. Antrim. He would have preferred a Westminster seat, but settled for the Stormont constituency of Bannside, to which he was returned unopposed in October 1946. In February 1948 the prime minister, Lord Brookeborough, appointed him parliamentary secretary to the minister of health. In 1953 he was moved to the post of chairman of ways and means (leader of the house), then in 1955 he became a joint parliamentary secretary to the minister of home affairs and dealt with a controversial rent de-restriction bill. He showed his facility in negotiating the timetable of the bill with his opposite number at Westminster, Enoch Powell. Following a ministerial reshuffle in 1956 he finally reached cabinet level as minister of home affairs and was sworn of the privy council (Northern Ireland). Six months later he took on the finance portfolio, and shortly afterwards he divested himself of home affairs.<br>
<br>O'Neill's tenure as minister of finance coincided with a severe economic crisis. Employment in the Belfast shipyards, for example, contracted by 40 per cent between 1961 and 1964. This was reflected in a swing towards the Northern Ireland Labour Party (NILP), particularly in Belfast. The government's policy was to seek support from Britain for the traditional, though declining, industries of textiles and heavy engineering. However, a joint exchequer working party, chaired by Sir Robert Hall, published a report in October 1962 that seemed decisively to reject throwing good money after bad. O'Neill at first had little idea how to approach the crisis. However, the Northern Ireland civil service autonomously developed a scheme of infrastructural development, concentrating on road building and the promotion of new towns. The Matthew plan, published in February 1963, thus made a more positive case for British subvention. O'Neill was quick to realize the significance of this new approach. It chimed in with his familiar refrain, at first born of Treasury cheese-paring, that Northern Ireland should rely upon self-help. Now he argued, notably in a speech to the Pottinger Unionist Association, Belfast, in February 1963, for generous pump-priming with British funds.<br>
<br>When Lord Brookeborough, by now seen as excessively rigid in his approach to the economy, retired in March 1963, O'Neill was well placed to don the mantle of technocratic modernization. His support, however, was not overwhelming in the parliamentary Unionist Party at Stormont. There was discontentment that he was not elected prime minister by the party, but appointed by the governor. He immediately set about modernizing the administration of devolution in Northern Ireland with some vigour. A series of schemes to rationalize railways, build motorways, encourage growth points, clear slums, reorganize ministries, establish a new university, create a new city, and reach a concordat with the trade unions to facilitate quasi-corporate planning were all designed to wring funds from Britain. Public investment per head of population doubled between 1958 and 1969, with particularly large increases in housing stock, roads, education, and training. Per capita public expenditure in Northern Ireland rose from 88 to 118 per cent of per capita public expenditure in England in the same period. Nevertheless, the economy continued to suffer from the pressures of chronic dependence on declining industries, and resumed a pattern of crisis in the 1970s.<br>
<br>O'Neill's stated ambition to change the face of Ulster had the effect of stealing the thunder of the NILP. Though economic planning was largely cosmetic, it was sufficient to secure a swing to the Unionist Party in the Stormont general election of 1965, and the NILP lost two of its four seats in Belfast. Nevertheless, modernization brought its own political problems, notably by making the economy seem amenable to government manipulation, and thereby convincing Catholics that their relative socio-economic disadvantage was a consequence of deliberate government discrimination. Indeed, there is something to this. A cabal of Unionist leaders in Londonderry, the second city of Northern Ireland, with a Catholic majority but a Unionist corporation, lobbied against the new university coming to the city for fear of upsetting delicately gerrymandered constituencies. Instead it went to the town of Coleraine. Similarly, the new city of Craigavon was planned with an eye to maintaining the integrity of Unionist electorates. The Labour government in Britain, led by Harold Wilson since 1964 and increasingly conscious of the cost of the rising economic subsidy to the province, was anxious to see such abuses reformed.<br>
<br>O'Neill, however, feared that substantive reform would serve only to provoke the ultra-loyalists, who possessed an able leader in waiting in the clerical politician Ian Paisley, and was well aware of the potential for disorder. During the Westminster general election of October 1964 there were three days of rioting on the Falls Road in Belfast, the worst disorder since 1935. O'Neill preferred carefully symbolic gestures. These included visiting Catholic schools and, more dramatically, meeting with the taoiseach of the Irish Republic, Sean Lemass, at Stormont on 14 January 1965. By such a dramatic gesture, made in his own name since he had not consulted his cabinet, O'Neill hoped not only to encourage Catholic acceptance of the state, but also to outflank ambitious rivals within the Unionist Party. Brian Faulkner, the able minister of commerce, was chief of these. O'Neill's poor interpersonal skills and evident distaste for his colleagues, however, meant that his every move tended to aggravate factional opposition within the parliamentary Unionist Party.<br>
<br>Republican commemorations in 1966 of the fiftieth anniversary of the Easter 1916 rising were handled deftly; though illegal, they were allowed to go ahead under the watchful eyes of the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC). However, an increasingly large protestant constituency was concerned that O'Neill was weak on the constitution. The very grandeur of his modernization of the economic infrastructure further generated tensions from those who felt excluded from government largess. In September 1966 it emerged that at least twelve out of thirty-six Unionist back-bench MPs at Stormont had signed a petition demanding his removal as prime minister. It was testimony to his political skills that he rode out this conspiracy. He did this by accentuating his already presidential status and appealing to moderate opinion outside the party. The Ulster Unionists, traditionally assertive in the middle ranks, felt ill-handled.<br>
<br>1967 appeared to be a lull before the storm, though O'Neill himself was notably weary of the burdens of office and ill at ease with his party. Catholic demands for full civil rights were increasingly heard, and, though O'Neill did his best to keep his counsel, gently pushing for mild reform behind the scenes, the issue became increasingly politicized. He hoped to generate local pride to divert attention from polarizing issues of state, and thus encouraged civic weeks.<br>
<br>When, on 5 October 1968, a civil-rights march was attacked by the RUC in Londonderry, a mass movement erupted, primarily of Catholics, demanding civil rights. Under pressure from the British government, O'Neill rushed to convince his cabinet colleagues of the need for concessions, even in the face of street demonstrations. On 22 November he unveiled a programme of reforms, notably the closing down of the gerrymandered Londonderry corporation. However, the local government rate-based franchise was for the time untouched. In a famous television broadcast on the night of 9 December 1968 O'Neill warned that Northern Ireland stood at the crossroads. He condemned those Unionists who would defy the pro-reform British government and demanded an end to street demonstrations. Subsequently he sacked his right-wing minister of home affairs, William Craig. O'Neill enjoyed a massive surge of public support, but the fragile peace was broken by a radical civil-rights march from Belfast to Londonderry, attacked by loyalists at Burntollet Bridge on 4 January 1969. In the following week a civil-rights march in Newry degenerated into violence.<br>
<br>The seeming inability of O'Neill to maintain Unionist authority led to ministerial resignations, most significantly that of Brian Faulkner on 24 January 1969. A coterie of hard-line Unionist MPs was increasingly vocal for O'Neill's resignation. To bolster his position he called an election for 24 February. Dramatically, he refused to campaign for official Unionist candidates opposed to his leadership and lent his support to independent candidates undertaking to support him personally. For the first time, a Unionist leader explicitly called for Catholic votes, to be deployed to overwhelm protestant ultras. This gambit produced confused results, but no clear-cut victory for O'Neill. Most significantly, there was little evidence of Catholics voting in great number for pro-O'Neill Unionists. This fatally undermined the promise of O'Neillism: that economic progress and ameliorative rhetoric would win Catholics from their traditional nationalist loyalties. O'Neill soldiered on as prime minister until, amid a renewal of street violence and a campaign of bombing by loyalist <i>agents provocateurs</i>, he announced his resignation on 28 April 1969. He employed the last of his political capital in securing one person, one vote, in place of the ratepayers' franchise in local elections. His casting vote ensured that he was succeeded by the relatively loyal, though hardly adequate, James Chichester-Clark rather than Brian Faulkner.<br>
<br>O'Neill rapidly faded from political view. He was made a life peer, as Baron O'Neill of the Maine, in 1970 and moved to Lisle Court, Lymington, Hampshire, though he continued to speak on the problems of Northern Ireland in the House of Lords, where he sat as a cross-bencher. He was also a trustee of the Winston Churchill Memorial Trust. He died at his home, Lisle Court, of cancer on 12 June 1990.<br>
<br>O'Neill worked better with civil servants, notably James Malley and Sir Kenneth Bloomfield, than with politicians. His attempts to reform Northern Irish politics depended upon administrative reform and quasi-presidential rhetoric rather than refashioning the party he led. Himself distinctly Anglo-Irish, he underestimated the fierce identity politics of both Catholic and protestant communities. He viewed popular protestant opinion warily, suspecting it of atavistic sectarianism, and regarded Catholics patronizingly as degraded with a slave mentality. He assumed that his natural supporters were the middle classes and thought them capable of pioneering enlightened public opinion. His final, disillusioned, conclusion was that the &#145;good men&#146; of politics preferred &#145;playing golf&#146; to confronting the &#145;wild men&#146;. His efforts to subsume ethnic passions within a constructive civic society were gratingly patrician, though decent in motivation and sincere.<br>
<br>O'Neill's wife, <a name="cosubject_99433"></a><span class="headword">(Katharine) Jean O'Neill <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Whitaker]</span></span>, Lady O'Neill of the Maine  (1915&#150;2008), <span class="occ">horticulturist</span>, was born on 16 January 1915 at 41 Upper Brook Street, Mayfair, London, the fourth daughter and youngest of five children of (William) Ingham Whitaker (1866&#150;1936), and his wife, Hilda Guilhermina, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Dundas (1877&#150;1971), daughter of Charles Saunders Melville Dundas, sixth Viscount Melville. She grew up at Pylewell Park, near Lymington, Hampshire, which had been bought by her paternal grandfather with a fortune derived from the import of Marsala wine. Her father, who inherited the estate in 1893, was a keen horticulturist and traveller, who brought back various Asian and Australian plants and created a renowned garden at Pylewell. She was educated at home, but most enjoyed helping the head gardener, and mucking about on a small sailing boat. In 1937 she toured Europe with a friend in a Ford V8, and met Unity Mitford and Joseph Goebbels, neither of whom impressed her. During the Second World War she served as a Voluntary Aid Detachment nurse. After her marriage, as well as bringing up her two young children and acting as a dutiful politician's wife, she cultivated a five acre garden at Glebe House, Ahoghill, near Ballymena, advised the National Trust on the restoration of its gardens at Rowallane, Mount Stewart, and Castle Ward, and served as the first president of the Rose Society of Northern Ireland. On the family's return to the mainland in 1970 she created a new garden of rare plants at Lisle Court (in the grounds of Pylewell Park), many of them collected on her travels, particularly to Australia, where her son had settled. She also researched horticultural history, publishing many articles in <span class="italic">Country Life</span>, the <span class="italic">Garden History Journal</span>, and the <span class="italic">Journal of Natural History</span>. Her biography of Peter Collinson, the eighteenth-century collector, written jointly with Elizabeth McLean, was published posthumously in 2008. She was a fellow of the Linnean Society and in 2000 was awarded the Veitch memorial medal of the Royal Horticultural Society. Her last expedition, undertaken at the age of eighty-eight, was a two-week excursion down the Amazon. She was a devout Christian and had disliked the sectarian atmosphere of Northern Ireland. She died of a stroke on 15 July 2008 and was survived by her two children.<br>
