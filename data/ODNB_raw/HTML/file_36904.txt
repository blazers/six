<span class="headword">Wilkinson,  (Henry) Spenser</span>  (1853&#150;1937), <span class="occ">military historian</span>, was born on 1 May 1853 at 9 Wilberforce Terrace, Preston Street, Hulme, the second son of Thomas Read Wilkinson, a banker, and his wife, Emma Wolfenden. He was educated at Owens College, Manchester, and (from 1873 to 1877/8) Merton College, Oxford. He read for the bar at Lincoln's Inn and was called in 1880. In 1888 he married Victoria, the eldest daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6824/', "Sir Joseph Archer Crowe (1825&#150;1896)")</script>. There were six children of the marriage: two sons and four daughters. The marriage was close and loving, and Victoria's death in 1929 was a devastating blow to Wilkinson from which he never completely recovered.<br>
<br>In 1874, while on vacation from Oxford, Wilkinson chanced to read an article upon European armies. This inspired a lifelong interest in military affairs. He had joined the volunteers at Oxford, and took a commission when he returned to Manchester in 1880. With six other enthusiasts, in 1881 Wilkinson founded the Manchester Tactical Society. This was intended to remedy the volunteers' ignorance of military theory and to improve their outdated drill. Wilkinson, by selecting and translating suitable foreign texts, provided more realistic tactical exercises. While still extending and enhancing his own military education, he established his reputation as the volunteers' spokesman.<br>
<br>Wilkinson had supposed that he would earn his living as a lawyer, but for more than a quarter of a century journalism was his principal vocation, providing both an income and a platform from which to promote his ideas. From 1881 he had contributed the occasional article on military subjects to the <span class="italic">Manchester Guardian</span>, and in 1883 C. P. Scott offered him a short-term engagement to cover Wolseley's Egyptian campaign. His unique gift as a newspaper writer who understood military matters was immediately recognized, even by the army's high command. Nevertheless, Scott doubted whether Wilkinson ought to be retained by the <span class="italic">Manchester Guardian</span>. W. T. Arnold, who taught Wilkinson the art of leader writing, took his part against Scott. Wilkinson's formidable command of detail rested upon exhaustive researches and he wrote with care on a range of disparate subjects. But in 1892 Scott decided Wilkinson had to leave because of his &#145;lack of a real hold of Liberal principles&#146;  (Ayerst, 239). Wilkinson was not sympathetic to every nuance of the radicalism that inspired the columns of the <span class="italic">Guardian</span>. He was no Gladstonian Liberal, nor was he always the easiest of colleagues. But his work had undoubtedly added distinction to the columns of the <span class="italic">Guardian</span>, while his comments upon military affairs were counted influential. Several years of penury as a freelance journalist followed.<br>
<br>It was his friend Lord Roberts who eventually helped Wilkinson to secure a place with the <span class="italic">Morning Post</span>, where he rapidly established himself as chief leader writer on imperial and military affairs. The <span class="italic">Post</span>'s traditions&#151;high tory, patrician, self-consciously English, and blatantly imperialist&#151;were the opposite of those that informed the <span class="italic">Guardian</span>. This did not discomfort Wilkinson, who could, on occasion, as over the infamous Kruger telegram (4 January 1896), play the ardent jingoist. Lord Glenesk, the owner of the <span class="italic">Morning Post</span>, was a sympathetic, loyal supporter and friend to Wilkinson. Not so his daughter Lilias Bathurst, who succeeded her father as proprietor. At the behest of Fabian Ware, the rabid tariff-reform editor of the <span class="italic">Post</span>, she allowed Wilkinson's copy to be censured. Ware accused Wilkinson of holding destructive views and providing material that was stale and out of date. Though Wilkinson continued writing for the <span class="italic">Morning Post</span> until 1914, he did so with waning enthusiasm.<br>
<br>Ware's comments had not been without substance. Until the South African War, a pragmatic progression had been evident in Wilkinson's thinking and writing. This was reflected, first, in his desire to improve the efficiency of the volunteers. Then he sought to solve the problems of leadership at command level by seeking inspiration from Germany's example. Next, imperial defence absorbed his thoughts, and then naval theory, to which he applied his earlier thinking on the functions of a general staff. Imperial defence questions necessarily involved him in the controversy over India. Finally, all problems combined in the one consuming question &#145;How might the nation best conduct the affairs and responsibilities of its great empire?&#146; For years, often alone, Wilkinson condemned public and governmental indifference and demanded that the diplomatic, naval, and military consequences of Britain's changing imperial and global responsibilities be addressed seriously. He argued that naval and military preparations were inappropriate and insufficient. But it was only the initial defeats of the South African War that provided &#145;the political education &hellip; that has been utterly neglected&#146;. Now Wilkinson enjoyed his greatest influence with the army, the &#145;thinking officers&#146; rejoicing at his well-aimed censures. His influence extended to the Foreign Office, where his work was much admired, particularly by his brother-in-law Sir Eyre Crowe. Crowe's seminal memorandum of 1 January 1907 on British relations with France and Germany was in large part a summary of Wilkinson's main arguments in <span class="italic">The Nation's Awakening</span> (1896).<br>
<br>Among the many other books Wilkinson wrote before the South African War, the most important and influential were: <span class="italic">Citizen Soldiers</span> (1884), concerning the volunteers; <span class="italic">The Brain of an Army</span> (1890), his <i>magnum opus</i>, a brilliant description and analysis of the working of the German general staff system; and <span class="italic">Imperial Defence</span> (1891), which was written in collaboration with Sir Charles Dilke and demonstrated Wilkinson's thinking on naval power. Although Wilkinson's attempts to reorganize the Admiralty proved futile, he became a moving spirit in the foundation of the Navy League (1894), whose subsequent actions and campaigns he did not altogether approve. It is notable that although he was encouraged and supported particularly by Lord Roberts, and despite his long-standing, frequent, and trenchant campaigns in print to improve the volunteers, it was not until 1904 that Wilkinson was at last given an official voice when appointed a member of the Norfolk commission. He used that rare opportunity effectively, if without immediate result.<br>
<br>In 1909 Wilkinson was elected to a fellowship of All Souls, and became the first Chichele professor of military history at Oxford University. For years he had hoped for an academic appointment and since the South African War his interests had turned increasingly to history. He enjoyed teaching and could inspire the able and dedicated. They, sadly, proved fewer at Oxford than he had expected. His lectures, abstract and detailed, were delivered in a monotone, and made even less intelligible by his habit of chewing his beard. He wrote much. As a historian he was thorough, direct, and honest. He emphasized the practical and eschewed theory, aiming to prepare his students for the direction of war.<br>
<br>The years of the First World War cast a tragic blight upon Wilkinson. Time and again he volunteered his services to the Admiralty and War Office only to be turned down. He grew ever more frustrated and disheartened by this cruel official neglect that confirmed he was now one of &#145;yesterday's men&#146;. He had the ear of neither Westminster nor Whitehall. His lectures were attended by dwindling audiences. Deep personal pain was added to frustration when one of his sons was killed in action. All that was left was to make patriotic speeches and seek mental and spiritual consolation by looking backwards in his researches to earlier wars. Though he retired from Oxford in 1923, he continued writing military history until 1930, when he completed a trilogy on the Napoleonic wars. In 1932 he confided to Basil Liddell Hart that he was &#145;getting rather tired of war&#146;, and instead was writing his recollections and translating Homer. An autobiographical fragment, <span class="italic">Thirty-Five Years, 1874&#150;1909</span>, was duly published in 1933, and in the year he died Wilkinson completed a translation in blank verse of the <span class="italic">Odyssey</span>. He died at the Acland Home, Banbury Road, Oxford, on 31 January 1937.<br>
<br>Wilkinson was a prolific and influential military writer. As a reformer, his bent was always practical rather than theoretical, and his overriding preoccupation, to establish the appropriate mechanism&#151;a properly organized general staff&#151;to decide questions of tactics and strategy. A unique pedagogic distinction was that Wilkinson was both a pioneer of university military education and, in Sir John Colomb's words, &#145;the greatest instructor of the public mind&#146;.<br>
