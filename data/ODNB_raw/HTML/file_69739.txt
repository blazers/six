<span class="headword">Hastings <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Dudley]</span>,  Katherine</span>, countess of Huntingdon  (<em>c.</em>1538&#150;1620), <span class="occ">noblewoman</span>, was one of the youngest of the thirteen children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8156/', "John Dudley, duke of Northumberland (1504&#150;1553)")</script>, and his wife, Jane (<i>c</i>.1509&#150;1555), daughter of Sir Edward Guildford. On 25 May 1553, four days after the marriage of Guildford Dudley to Lady Jane Grey, Northumberland celebrated Katherine's wedding to <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/12574/', "Henry Hastings (1536?&#150;1595)")</script>, the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/12566/', "Francis Hastings, second earl of Huntingdon")</script>. Within a year the bride saw her father executed and her husband imprisoned in the Tower for their involvement in the attempt to divert the succession in favour of Lady Jane Grey, though Mary quickly pardoned Lord Hastings, great-nephew of her archbishop of Canterbury, Cardinal Pole. Elizabeth's promotion of Robert Dudley immediately after her accession further reinforced the young couple's connections with the court.<br>
<br>The premature death of the second earl of Huntingdon in June 1560 placed upon the new earl responsibility for the education and settlement of his nine brothers and sisters, while the countess increasingly concerned herself over her husband's financial difficulties. Both having been introduced to protestantism at an early age, as soon as they came into their inheritance they set about creating a godly household at Ashby-de-la-Zouch in Leicestershire under the guidance of the former Genevan exile Anthony Gilby. In 1570 Gilby published for the use of their family his translation of Calvin as <span class="italic">Commentaries &hellip; upon the Prophet Daniell</span>, following it in 1580 with another translation from Beza, <span class="italic">The Psalmes of David Truely Opened and Explaned</span>, intended specifically for Lady Katherine.<br>
<br>When Elizabeth fell ill with smallpox in November 1562, the protestant party looked to Huntingdon as her successor, on which account his wife received a &#145;privy nippe&#146; from the queen the following spring  (BL, Harley MS 787, fol. 16). Handicapped by his birth, Huntingdon obtained no major public office until 1569, when the queen employed him to guard Mary, queen of Scots. Then, late in 1572, she appointed him president of the council in the north and the countess, while still frequently attending court, assumed charge of the viceregal household at the King's Manor in York. Although she had no children of her own (she may have suffered a miscarriage in early 1566), she showed a particular interest in the training of young people. As he lay dying in Dublin in 1576, the first earl of Essex entrusted his two daughters and younger son to the earl and his wife at York, where they also welcomed the countess's favourite nephew, Thomas Sidney, after his father's death in 1586. The household established at Hackness in Yorkshire at the turn of the century by Margaret Hoby with its round of public and private religious observances almost certainly mirrors the practices she learned from her mistress the countess of Huntingdon, who at this time received the dedications of Nathaniel Gilby's translation of G. Sohn as <span class="italic">A Briefe and Learned Treatise &hellip; of the Antichrist</span> (1592), John Stockwood's translation of L. Daneau entitled <span class="italic">A Fruitfull Commentarie upon the Twelve Small Prophets</span> (1594), and Francis Bunny's <span class="italic">A Comparison betweene the Auncient Fayth of the Romans, and the New Romish Religion</span> (1595).<br>
<br>The earl of Huntingdon was planning to join his wife at court when he died unexpectedly at York on 14 December 1595. Despite the great care the queen took over breaking the news, the countess was devastated by grief. Refusing to accept the administration of her husband's much encumbered estate, she settled in Chelsea and remained very close to Elizabeth until the queen's death. In her widowhood she devoted herself to advancing the career of Sir Robert Sidney, delighting in having his young children in her care during his embassies abroad. Theological writers also continued to seek her patronage, and books dedicated to her in her latter years included Henry Holland, <span class="italic">The Workes &hellip; of M. Richard Greenham</span> (1599), Thomas Savile, <span class="italic">The Raising of them that are Fallen</span> (1606), and Thomas Collins, <span class="italic">The Penitent Publican</span> (1610). Approaching eighty in 1618, she still prided herself on her ability &#145;to breed and govern yong gentlewomen&#146;  (<span class="italic">Rutland MSS</span>, 1.99). She died at Chelsea, and was buried in her mother's tomb in Chelsea Old Church on 14 August 1620.<br>
