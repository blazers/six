<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Beatty, Sir  Edward Wentworth</span>  (1877&#150;1943), <span class="occ">railway entrepreneur in Canada</span>, was born at Thorold, Ontario, on 16 October 1877, the third son and fourth child of Henry Beatty, shipowner, and his wife, Harriett M. Powell. He was educated at Upper Canada College and at the Harbord Collegiate and Parkdale Collegiate Institute (now the University of Toronto).<br>
<br>After studying at Osgoode Hall law school, Beatty was called to the bar of Ontario in 1901, when he joined the legal department of the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR), almost twenty years after his father had sold his Great Lakes shipping company to the railway, and where he remained as general shipping manager afterwards. Beatty moved rapidly through the ranks becoming general counsel for the railway in 1913, vice-president in 1914, and a director in 1916. Two years later the outgoing CPR president, Sir Thomas Shaughnessy, chose Beatty as his successor in preference to older and more experienced officials. Beatty's youth, as well as his lack of practical railway experience, made this one of the most controversial decisions of the day, and throughout the inter-war years the CPR's profitability fell in the face of vigorous competition from the newly nationalized Canadian National Railway (CNR) and the emerging highway trucking systems. Beatty was blamed by many for CPR's problems, and he was little helped by unsympathetic comparisons to his chief rival, Henry Thornton, the charismatic and outgoing president of the CNR.<br>
<br>Beatty always resented what he viewed as wasteful and unfair competition from the state-backed CNR. He laboured to end it through a merger of the two systems, free from direct state control, and it was a bitter blow to him when a royal commission permanently blocked his attempt at a Canadian railway monopoly in 1932. On the more positive side, Beatty tried to improve CPR's profitability by cutting railway expenses, expanding its more remunerative shipping operations, and moving into passenger airline services. The CPR was in fact beginning to recover when Beatty suffered a massive stroke in 1941, forcing him to retire from the presidency a year later.<br>
<br>A life-long bachelor, Beatty volunteered much of his time, abilities, and money to various causes. He served as chancellor of Queen's University (1919&#150;23). As chancellor of McGill University (1921&#150;43), he did not hesitate to use his position to remove prominent leftist academics from the faculty as part of his ongoing battle against socialism and state ownership. He was also chairman of the Rhodes scholarship committee for the province of Quebec, trustee and president of the Royal Victoria Hospital in Montreal, president of the Boy Scout Association of Canada, and president and chief financial mainstay of the Boys' Farm and Training School at Shawbridge, Quebec. In 1935 he was appointed GBE and made an honorary bencher of the Middle Temple. He became a Dominion KC in 1915 and received honorary degrees from twelve universities.<br>
<br>Beatty died at the Royal Victoria Hospital in Montreal on 23 March 1943.<br>
