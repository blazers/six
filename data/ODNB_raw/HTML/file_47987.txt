<span class="headword">Beaumont,  Huntingdon</span>  (1561&#150;1624), <span class="occ">coal owner</span>, was born probably at Coleorton, Leicestershire, the fourth and youngest son of Nicholas Beaumont (<i>d</i>. 1585), and Anne (<i>d</i>. 1581), daughter of William Saunders, of Welford, Northamptonshire. He had three brothers, the second of whom died in infancy, and two sisters. His father owned the Coleorton estate, and by exploiting its extensive coal reserves had become the largest colliery owner in the county. Described as unmarried in 1616, Beaumont must have wed shortly afterwards since he was survived by a wife, Joan, and three small children. Nothing is known of his early education, though he received a thorough training in the management of the family business: he was described in 1622 as &#145;a man reputed to be very skyllful in Coalworkes, having spent a great part of his life and tyme in suchlyke works&#146;  (Smith, <span class="italic">Early Coal-Mining</span>, 66). It has also been suggested that he obtained his knowledge of advanced mining technology from a visit to Germany in his youth; but it is more likely that this was acquired through a familiarity both with Agricola's renowned mining text, <span class="italic">De re metallica</span>, and with English metal-mining practices, which had been introduced into the midland coalmines from Cornwall and Derbyshire.<br>
<br>The landed gentry played a key role in the rapid development of the coal industry in the sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries. Sufficient profits could be made to attract investment, but it was one of the most risky of industries. Management of profitable family mines at Coleorton and at Bedworth in Warwickshire encouraged Beaumont to seek a personal fortune, first in the larger Nottinghamshire coalfield and ultimately in the north-east, the heart of the industry. Beaumont was an ambitious gentry businessman who attempted to overcome the formidable challenges of the coal industry with boldness and flair&#151;to the point of recklessness, according to his critics.<br>
<br>For an individual colliery owner one of the chief obstacles to business advancement in the late 1500s was that the market for coal suffered both from severe economic fluctuations and from a longer-term tendency to over-production and excessive competition. Beaumont attempted to overcome this obstacle by a variety of techniques. In the east midlands he created a local monopoly, and when this failed he attempted to tap a national market. In the north-east, however, he introduced new technology which he hoped would give the business a cost advantage over its rivals, in the short term at least. He also tried to eliminate competition and create a monopoly either by paying rivals to cease production or by buying them out. In 1599 Sir Percy Willoughby was paid &pound;100 a year to close Foleshill colliery, which was competing with Bedworth (mined by Beaumont jointly with his brother <a href="#cosubject_47987">Thomas [<i>see below</i>]</a>). As a result Bedworth dominated the Warwickshire coal market with an annual output of about 20,000 tons a year. In 1601 Beaumont took over control of Wollaton colliery in Nottinghamshire. He paid the same gentry rival 2<i>s</i>. a rook on sales and two years later gained control of the neighbouring and competing Strelley mines by leasing them from Sir John Byron. In 1604, in an attempt to maintain prices and profitability in the face of trade depression, Wollaton colliery was closed and production became concentrated at Strelley. Consideration was then given to the possibility of purchasing and &#145;laying down&#146; four other competing mines. However, the plan to &#145;ingrosse or overthrowe most of the best coalmines in the countree&#146;  (Smith, <span class="italic">Early Coal-Mining</span>, 68) was not implemented, probably because of insufficient capital, and was soon superseded by an attempt to break through the ceiling on regional sales by entering the largest single market, that of the metropolis, which was dominated by its coastal trade with the north-east. Coal was to be shipped down the River Trent to Hull and thence, like Newcastle coal, down the coast to London. In July 1604 Beaumont entered into partnership with Sir Percival Willoughby, London merchant John Bate, and Hugh Lenton, a Newark merchant, to deliver 7000 loads each year to Nottingham Bridges for transportation down the Trent to London. A number of boats were purchased for the purpose, but the scheme was defeated by the cost of trans-shipment from the land-locked Strelley colliery; coal from Strelley could not profitably be sold for less than &pound;1 a ton in London, which compared unfavourably with Newcastle coal at 15<i>s</i>. Even after the construction of Britain's first wagon way, for 2 miles of the journey to the Trent (from Strelley through Wollaton to Wollaton Lane, Lenton), the price differential remained.<br>
<br>Following the failure of these marketing strategies in Nottinghamshire, Beaumont determined in 1605 to exploit the London market by the alternative method of becoming one of the foremost colliery owners in the north-east. As William Gray in his <span class="italic">Chorographia</span> of 1649 put it:<blockquote>Master Beaumont, a gentleman of great ingenuity and rare parts, adventured into our mines with his twenty thousand pounds; who brought with him many rare engines, not known then in these parts, as the art to boore with iron rods to try the deepnes and thickness of the cole, rare engines to draw water out of the pits; waggons with one horse to carry down water from the pits to the staithes to the river etc. (<span class="italic">History of Northumberland</span>, p. 228)</blockquote>Beaumont acquired the leases of mines at Bedlington and also of mines and salt pans at Cowpen and Bebside, in partnership with three London merchants, Robert and William Angell, and Robert Bowyer, and he took up residence at Bebside Hall. By 1609 the partnership had expanded to include Edward Rotherham, a London draper, and John Bate. The partners invested &pound;1000 each, but Beaumont, despite his expertise and talent for technological innovation, &#145;could not bring the workes to any perfection&#146;  (Smith, <span class="italic">Early Coal-Mining</span>, 70). In 1612 Beaumont and his nephew-in-law, Sir John Ashburnham (<i>d</i>. 1620), purchased the partnership by agreeing to pay the others &pound;1050 a year for the remaining term of the leases. They defaulted on the first payment and the enterprise was abandoned altogether in 1614 as a total loss.<br>
<br>Beaumont the innovator now sought to overcome the limitations of the market by the use of economies of scale to increase production at the Strelley mine. He determined to capture as large a slice of the Nottinghamshire, east Leicestershire, and Trent valley markets as possible by introducing round-the-clock working; double shifts and double corfs replaced the twelve-hour single-shift, single-corf system, which had been the traditional practice at the coalfield. This new system meant that four times as much coal per day could be produced, and an unprecedented annual output of over 20,000 tons was achieved. Despite its competitive price, depressed trading conditions prevented all the coal from being sold, and profits were insufficient to keep Beaumont's creditors at bay indefinitely. In the spring of 1618, the partners in the northern venture took action against Beaumont and Ashburnham for failing to pay their instalments, and they seized control of Strelley to work the mine for their own profit. In October 1618 Beaumont was committed to Nottingham prison until his debts should be paid, and he died from an unknown illness, without gaining his freedom from captivity, on 17 March 1624. He died a bankrupt, and was buried at the expense of his former business partner, Sir Percy Willoughby, at Bilborough, Nottingham, where he had been latterly residing.<br>
<br>Huntingdon Beaumont has been characterized, perhaps unjustly, as a reckless adventurer who squandered the family fortune on desperate business gambles. Yet he should be seen rather as an ambitious younger son of a gentry family who, since he would not inherit the estate, acted entrepreneurially. He deployed impressive technical and managerial skills, which were used to the utmost in a hazardous industry that was subject to the twin dangers of the physical exhaustion of the product and of market instability. These ultimately defeated Beaumont's expertise and drive, particularly in the north-eastern venture in which he and Sir John Ashburnham &#145;were utterly overthrown and in a manner whooly buried the estate in the said coalmynes&#146;  (Smith, <span class="italic">Early Coal-Mining</span>, 80).<br>
<br>Huntingdon's brother, <a name="cosubject_47987"></a><span class="headword">Sir Thomas Beaumont</span>  (<em>c.</em>1555&#150;1614)<span class="occ"></span>, who was his associate in a number of business ventures, was equally entrepreneurial. Thomas was the third born but second surviving son of Nicholas, and was also probably born at Coleorton. About 1575 he married Catherine Farnham (<i>d</i>. 1621) and thereby succeeded to the lordship of the manor of Stoughton in Leicestershire. He also inherited the estate of Henry Beaumont of Giltsham, Devon, on the latter's death without issue. Thomas was knighted in 1603. He and Catherine had three sons and seven daughters. His daughter Elizabeth married Sir John Ashburnham, who died in 1620 in the Fleet debtors' prison in London.<br>
<br>The brothers' joint business activity commenced in 1597 when coal was leased from the crown at Bedworth and Griff, Warwickshire, at which time a large mine was opened at Bedworth. To guarantee the profitability of their heavy investment the brothers began purchasing coal reserves in adjoining estates, and by 1602 they had &#145;engrossed all the mynes neere thereunto adjoyning, six myles compas on everye side&#146;  (Nef, 1.15). With a virtual monopoly of the north Warwickshire market, the mine made a profit of at least &pound;3000 a year, but it was abandoned following extensive flooding in 1610. By then, &pound;10,000 had been invested in the mine, much of it borrowed from other members of the family, including the third brother, Francis. None the less, Sir Thomas continued to support Huntingdon's mining activities. In 1610 he took over the lease of the coal at Strelley, to work it for his own profit until the &pound;2000 which he had lent Huntingdon (probably for his Bedlington enterprise) had been repaid. Sir Thomas made strenuous efforts to increase output and profits by expanding the market in the Trent valley, but the loan had still not been repaid in full by the time of his death on 27 November 1614. He was succeeded by his eldest son and heir, Sir Henry Beaumont, who was never able to recover the debt. Sir Thomas had found, like his brother, that investment in coalmining ultimately meant that &#145;Instead of dreining the water, ther pockets are dreined&#146;  (Stone, 340).<br>
