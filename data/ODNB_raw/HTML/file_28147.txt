<span class="headword">Vaughan, Sir  Thomas</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1483), <span class="occ">courtier</span>, was the son of Robert Vaughan of Monmouth and his wife, Margaret; claims that he was related to the Vaughans of Brecknockshire are not substantiated [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/48656/', "Vaughan family (per. c.1400&#150;c.1504)")</script>]. He entered royal service, perhaps with Beaufort patronage&#151;on 30 March 1443 John Beaufort, earl of Somerset (<i>d</i>. 1444), urged his grant of denizenship. In 1446, as king's esquire, he was appointed steward and receiver of the Beauchamp estates in Herefordshire and the marches, but by 1450 he had moved to London as an esquire for the body, and (18 July) master of the king's ordnance for life. He was well rewarded, became a king's serjeant, and acquired a house named Garlick in Stepney which was a meeting-place of the influential. By 1456 he was a councillor of the king's half-brother, Jasper Tudor (<i>d</i>. 1495). Vaughan was employed as an envoy to Burgundy (1457&#150;8), and he sat as MP for Marlborough (1455&#150;6) and JP for Middlesex (1457&#150;8). In 1459 the approaching conflict between Queen Margaret and Richard, duke of York, made him reassess his loyalties, and it was later alleged that he entered into a conspiracy with York's friends (4 July). He was among the Yorkists dispersed at Ludford Bridge (12 October), and was attainted in the Coventry parliament in December; but he returned with the Yorkist lords from Calais in 1460. Once they had captured Henry VI at Northampton (10 July), Vaughan resumed mastership of the ordnance and became keeper of the great wardrobe. He soon&#151;between 28 July and 18 October&#151;married Eleanor, daughter of Sir Thomas Arundel of Betchworth, Surrey, and widow of the Lancastrian Sir Thomas Brown; for &pound;1000 Vaughan secured Brown's forfeited estates in south-east England. Queen Margaret's victory at St Albans (17 February 1461) caused him to flee with York's treasure, but he was captured at sea by French pirates.<br>
<br>Louis XI resisted Margaret's request that he hand Vaughan over to her, and in October 1461 Edward IV contributed &pound;200 to his ransom. He returned to Yorkist service in 1462 as esquire for the body and (June 1465) keeper of the great wardrobe, treasurer of the chamber, and master of the king's jewels. Thereafter he was a favoured and protected royal servant, who was again employed on embassies to Burgundy, France, and the Hanse, and was appointed JP in Kent, Surrey, and Sussex (1464&#150;6), and sheriff of Surrey&#150;Sussex (1466&#150;7). In January 1469 he became keeper of the hanaper.<br>
<br>Vaughan may have shared Edward IV's exile in 1470&#150;71; after the king's return he assumed further responsibilities, especially in royal estate management. In July 1471 he was appointed chamberlain and councillor of the prince of Wales, and was prominent in supervising his estates and his upbringing. In the 1470s he was a central figure in exploiting the estates that fell to the crown, including those of Mowbray (1477) and Clarence (1478), and in developing the prince's council in the marches of Wales; as a king's councillor he was knighted in 1475 and was MP for Cornwall in 1478. Vaughan had close relations with prominent nobles, including the Woodvilles and Richard of Gloucester&#151;the latter resided at Garlick in 1473&#150;4; at Westminster he built a mansion (<i>c</i>.1474) which seems to have served as a residence for the prince. When Edward IV died (9 April 1483) Vaughan was with the prince at Ludlow. He was in the party which left on 24 April to accompany Edward V to his coronation. They were intercepted by Gloucester and the duke of Buckingham, and Vaughan, along with Richard Grey and Sir Richard Haute, was arrested in the king's lodgings at Stony Stratford on 30 April, accused of plotting against Gloucester. By now an &#145;aged knight&#146;  (<span class="italic">Crowland Chronicle Continuations</span>), he was confined at Pontefract. Some weeks later, he was condemned and on 25 June executed, a victim of Edward IV's trust and Richard of Gloucester's ambition.<br>
