<span class="headword">Fleming,  Malcolm</span>, first earl of Wigtown  (<em>d.</em> in or before 1363), <span class="occ">magnate</span>, was the elder son of Robert Fleming of Cumbernauld. He married, probably before <i>c</i>.1310, Marjorie (<i>d</i>. in or before 1361), a lady of unknown family. They had three known children: an unnamed son, for whose marriage in 1329 Fleming had a gift of money from the king and who died before 1351, leaving a son, <a href="#cosubject_54185">Thomas [<i>see below</i>]</a>; Marjorie, who married William Fawside; and Evota, who married John Ramsay.<br>
<br>Fleming rose in the service of the Bruce kings. Before 1321 he received Kirkintilloch from Robert I and properties in the Lennox, Ayrshire, and Wigtownshire, while before February 1327 he was appointed sheriff of Dumbarton and keeper of Dumbarton Castle. He was bailie of Carrick from at least February 1327 and steward of the royal household from August 1328 until June 1329. In 1324 his wife became nurse to the future David II, from whom, after 1341, she had various substantial grants of property in her own right.<br>
<br>One of the few important Scots to survive the battle of Halidon Hill on 19 July 1333, Fleming escaped to Dumbarton, which he held thereafter for the Bruce cause. He welcomed David II and his queen there and in May 1334 arranged their passage to France. Following David's return in May 1341 Fleming joined the king's inner circle of councillors and was a regular charter witness. On 9 November 1341 his loyalty was rewarded by the grant of the lands of the sheriffdom of Wigtown and his creation as earl of Wigtown, with rights of regality and special judicial powers that were designed to enable him to re-establish Bruce control over this strongly pro-Balliol territory, a role for which his long-standing links with Carrick suited him.<br>
<br>In autumn 1346 Fleming took part in David's invasion of northern England, but on 17 October he was one of several leading Scots captured with the king at Nevilles Cross. Early in 1347, however, having escaped from the custody of Sir Robert Bertram, he was again at liberty. His escape was arranged by one of his captors, Robert Vale, whom Fleming repaid with properties in Lanarkshire and the Lennox. Apart from his attendance at the Dundee parliament of 1350, there is little evidence of further political activity until in 1357 he served as a commissioner in the negotiations leading to the treaty of Berwick that year. He then appears to have retired from political life&#151;he had been replaced as sheriff of Dumbarton by 1359&#151;and was dead before March 1363; he was probably buried in the Franciscan friary at Ayr, of which he had been a generous benefactor.<br>
<br>Malcolm Fleming was succeeded in his hereditary property and titles by his grandson, <a name="cosubject_54185"></a><span class="headword">Thomas Fleming</span>  (<em>d.</em> in or after 1382)<span class="occ"></span>. Thomas was named heir to the earldom as early as September 1351, when he was a hostage during David II's visit on parole to Scotland. Again a hostage under the treaty of Berwick from 1357, he suffered a prolonged captivity following David's suspension of ransom payments in 1360. The financial problems which dogged him thereafter probably stemmed from the expense of securing his release. In January 1367, by which time Fleming was free, he had a regrant of Wigtown, but was deprived of his rights of regality. Money difficulties and disputes with local lords, perhaps exacerbated by his own extended absences from the region, led him in February 1372 to sell the earldom lands to Archibald Douglas, lord of Galloway, and further finance was obtained through the grant of extended tacks or wadsets on other properties. Family possession of the residue of his estates was secured in November 1372, when his cousin Malcolm Fleming of Biggar received assignation of a wadset on the lands of Lenzie. On 20 September 1382 this Malcolm was given charters confirming the grant of Lenzie, which Thomas had resigned to the crown. There is no indication that Thomas Fleming ever married. The date of his death is unknown.<br>
