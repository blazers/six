<span class="headword">Bonar,  John</span>  (1721&#150;1761), <span class="occ">Church of Scotland minister</span>, was born at Clackmannan on 4 November 1721, the eldest son of John Bonar (1696&#150;1752), then a tutor in the family of Colonel Bruce at Kennet, and Jean Smith (<i>b</i>. 1695), daughter of William Smith of Alloa, Clackmannanshire. Following his father's ordination as minister of Fetlar and North Yell in Shetland in 1729 he was sent for his primary education to the parish school at Torphichen, Linlithgowshire, where his grandfather, John Bonar (1671&#150;1747), was the minister, and then to the University of Edinburgh, where he graduated MA on 27 April 1742. Bonar of Torphichen was a prominent evangelical leader who preached at the famous Cambuslang revival in 1742, and his grandson is said to have left behind manuscript accounts of two visits that he made there. He completed the divinity course at Edinburgh and was licensed to preach the gospel by the presbytery of Glasgow on 5 June 1745. On 29 January 1746 he was presented by Archibald Cockburn of Cockpen to the little parish of Cockpen in Edinburghshire, where he was ordained on 22 August. Three months later he married, on 18 November 1746, Christian (1724&#150;1771), daughter of Andrew Currier of Edinburgh, writer to the signet. They had a large family, with eight children who survived infancy, including <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2817/', "John Bonar (1747&#150;1807)")</script>, a solicitor of the excise who was among the six co-founders of the Speculative Society at the University of Edinburgh; <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2813/', "Archibald Bonar (1753&#150;1816)")</script>, minister of Cramond; and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2815/', "James Bonar (1757&#150;1821)")</script>, also a solicitor of the excise, whose life of Archibald, in the second volume of the latter's <span class="italic">Sermons</span> (1815&#150;17), is not always reliable as a source of information about their father.<br>
<br>John Bonar was allied with the orthodox or popular party in ecclesiastical affairs, but was well versed in secular as well as scriptural learning. His first publication, a pamphlet entitled <span class="italic">Observations on the Conduct and Character of Judas Iscariot</span>, appeared in 1750, went to a second edition in 1752, and was reprinted with a memoir of the author in 1822. Said to be &#145;one of the most popular preachers in the Church&#146;  (Somerville, 169), he was invited to preach the annual sermon before the Society in Scotland for Propagating Christian Knowledge on 6 January 1752, published one month later as <span class="italic">The Nature and Necessity of a Religious Education</span>. In its passionate affirmation of &#145;useful knowledge&#146; in association with religious knowledge, the sermon prefigures Bonar's later work on behalf of educational academies. Another passage asserts that magistrates must use their authority to restrain &#145;open immoralities,&#151;a contempt of religion,&#151;and the immoderate use of public diversions&#146;  (pp. 6&#150;9, 22), anticipating another important theme in Bonar's career. On 26 May 1755 he published an anonymous pamphlet, <span class="italic">An analysis of the moral and religious sentiments contained in the writings of Sopho and David Hume, esq.</span>, designed to persuade the members of the general assembly of that year to take action against<blockquote>the public attack which in this country has of late been made on the great principles and duties of natural and revealed religion, in the works of David Hume; and in the essays of an author who has been distinguished by the name of Sopho [Lord Kames]. (p. 2)</blockquote>Bonar may have acquired his zeal for purifying the kirk from his grandfather, who wrote in a work published in 1743 of the need to &#145;shun the company of such as are either of unsound Principles or unsuitable Conversations&#146;  (Bonar and Willison, 31). Shortly after the campaign against Hume and Kames failed in the general assembly Bonar was involved in an attempt, successful in his presbytery but eventually overturned in the synod, to censure Alexander Carlyle for attending a performance of the tragedy of <span class="italic">Douglas</span> in December 1756. Even Carlyle, however, acknowledged that Bonar &#145;was a man of sense&#151;an excellent preacher; he was temperate in his opposition&#146;  (<span class="italic">Autobiography</span>, ed. Burton, 247).<br>
<br>In January 1756 Bonar was presented to Jedburgh through the influence of the fourth marquess of Lothian, but he was never translated due to opposition from the parishioners, who had already committed themselves to Thomas Boston. Bonar was soon called to the second charge at Perth (later the West Church), where he was translated and admitted on 29 July 1756. On 16 April 1760 he preached a sermon before the synod of Perth and Stirling, &#145;The nature and tendency of the ecclesiastic constitution in Scotland&#146;, which was published later that year and was also in the first volume of <span class="italic">The Scotch Preacher</span> (1775); it praised the presbyterian system of the Church of Scotland for its tendency to support ecclesiastical and civil liberty and order, as well as doctrinal purity. The following year Bonar wrote his &#145;Memorial relative to the academy in Perth&#146;, dated 11 November 1761, which argued warmly against an educational system based on &#145;the Grammatical knowledge of Dead Languages and a skill in Metaphysical Subtiltys&#146; and in favour of an alternative system grounded in practical scientific applications tending towards &#145;the Improvement of the Merchant, Mechanick and Farmer in their respective Arts&#146;. Although never published it was an important expression of the philosophy of practical education that helped to define the pedagogical policy and curriculum of Perth Academy and similar institutions.<br>
<br>Scarcely one month later, on 21 December 1761, Bonar died at the age of forty from what his son James called &#145;an inflammatory fever&#146;  (Bonar, xxv). His surviving manuscripts include several sermons and an unfinished book, &#145;History of Tyre&#146;, intended to show that &#145;national punishment has been, and ever must be the Consequence of National Guilt&#146;.<br>
