<span class="headword">Toller,  Thomas Northcote</span>  (1844&#150;1930), <span class="occ">philologist and lexicographer</span>, was born on 1 September 1844 at Kettering, Northamptonshire. The son of Joseph Toller (1810&#150;1903) of Kettering, a printer, and his wife, Caroline, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Wallis (1814/15&#150;1904), he was named after his grandfather, Thomas Northcote Toller (1756&#150;1821), minister of the Independent chapel in the same town. His only known sibling was a sister who outlived him. Having attended Kettering grammar school, he became a pensioner at Christ's College, Cambridge, on 14 April 1862, and was ranked seventh wrangler in the mathematical tripos four years later, graduating BA in 1866 and MA in 1869. He subsequently taught pupils at Cambridge until he was elected a fellow of his college in 1872, in which year he was appointed to a teaching post in English language at Owens College, Manchester (from 1880 the Victoria University of Manchester). Toller was initially appointed as assistant lecturer for a three-year term, and then promoted to a full lectureship which he held until 1880 when he became the first Smith professor of English Language.<br>
<br>Toller married, on 2 November 1889, Edith (1854&#150;1935), widow of the Hon. Henry Romilly, and eldest daughter of Benson Rathbone of Liverpool. Edith had a daughter from her previous marriage, Sophie Katharine, who predeceased her mother, dying of a cerebral haemorrhage on 8 December 1904 aged twenty-five. Later, in her memory, Toller and his wife established the Katharine Romilly scholarship, a bursary and entrance scholarship for students at Ashburne Hall, the first women's hall of residence at the University of Manchester. Toller continued to take an active interest in the hall for the rest of his life and donated his library to it at his death. He was awarded honorary doctorates by the University of Oxford in 1908 and by the University of Manchester in 1912.<br>
<br>Toller resigned his chair in 1903 to devote himself to the increasing demands of his lexicographic work. In 1878 the Clarendon Press in Oxford had invited him to complete a new edition of Joseph Bosworth's <span class="italic">A Dictionary of the Anglo-Saxon Language</span>, which had been published by Longman between 1838 and 1844. At the time of his death in 1876 Bosworth was engaged on a revised dictionary, for which the delegates of the Clarendon Press had purchased the copyright. In 1878, Toller, then a young and untried scholar, set to work on Bosworth's papers and in 1882 produced <span class="italic">An Anglo-Saxon Dictionary Based on the Manuscript Collections of the Late Joseph Bosworth</span>, parts 1 and 2 (A&#150;Hwi), his first publication of any significance. The dictionary from A to near the end of G was almost wholly based on Bosworth's own materials (the sheets for A&#150;F having already been at press by the time of Bosworth's death in 1876), and it was severely criticized on publication by reviewers.<br>
<br>As a result of the hostile reception, Toller added a great deal of new material in subsequent entries as he had done in the preparation of H in part 2, and his alterations in the arrangement of the material&#151;particularly in the division of meaning along etymological lines&#151;suggest that he was influenced by the newly emerging <span class="italic">Oxford English Dictionary</span>, which itself was to become dependent on Toller's work for its pre-conquest references. Toller's enlarged form of Bosworth's dictionary was published in two further parts, and the complete book appeared in 1898. Reviews of the finished dictionary were more favourable, but both lexicographer and publisher now having realized the shortcomings of the work on the early part of the alphabet, Toller immediately began work on a supplement which in fact consisted of a wholesale revision of A&#150;G. The supplement, which was also published in parts, appeared between 1908 and 1921, though Toller, now a septuagenarian, continued to add material and corrections in notes in the <span class="italic">Modern Language Review</span> (1922 and 1924).<br>
<br>Some indication of the effect that criticism of his work had on Toller himself may be gauged from the concluding sentence of his preface to the main dictionary in 1898: &#145;To compile an Anglo-Saxon Dictionary calls for so much in the compiler that some leniency towards shortcomings may perhaps be looked for by any one who attempts the labour.&#146; In fact he was a dedicated, exact, and exacting scholar who, after a faltering start, and having inherited materials that wiser and more experienced heads had suggested should be abandoned, produced a dictionary for which no leniency of judgement is required, one that was entirely appropriate to the period in which it was produced and that has continued to serve the academic community well for a great many years. His quiet and self-effacing manner, apparent through his surviving correspondence, suggests that he would have been the first to describe himself as both harmless and a drudge. Yet the dictionary, but for A&#150;F of part 1, is wholly his creation, and although the work of later generations of lexicographers will progressively decrease its relevance to the modern scholar, it made a lasting contribution to the study of Anglo-Saxon throughout the twentieth century and will continue to do so for much of the twenty-first. It was, as Toller himself would have put it, a job well done.<br>
<br>Toller's other publications are insignificant by comparison with the <span class="italic">Anglo-Saxon Dictionary</span>. They consist of an inaugural lecture, <span class="italic">The Oldest English Poetry</span> (1880), an edition of <span class="italic">The Correspondence of Edward, Third Earl of Derby, during the years 24 to 31, Henry VIII</span> for the Chetham Society (1890), again a work begun by others, and a textbook for students, <span class="italic">Outlines of the History of the English Language</span> (1900). He died on 2 March 1930 at Lansdowne House, Didsbury, Manchester, where he had lived since 1909, and was cremated on 5 March at Manchester crematorium.<br>
