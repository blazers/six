<span class="headword">Waterhouse,  George</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1602), <span class="occ">musician</span>, is of unknown parentage and education. The record of his admission as a gentleman of Elizabeth I's Chapel Royal in July 1588 noted that he was &#145;from Lincoln&#146;. His erstwhile occupation there is unknown; he was not associated with the music or choir of the cathedral. On 7 July 1592 he supplicated the University of Oxford for admission to the degree of bachelor of music; there is no record of its having been conferred. His stated qualification for this award lay in his having spent many years in the study of theoretical and practical music.<br>
<br>The only surviving example of Waterhouse's composition is an extraordinary collection of canons upon the plainsong antiphon <span class="italic">Miserere mihi, domine</span>, occupying over 400 pages of closely written manuscript and numbered as 1163 individual pieces. Almost all are composed two parts in one above their subject, whose twenty-six-note theme is laid out at diverse pitches in notional semibreves. As well as plain canon they employ, in various permutations, the conventional techniques of inversion, augmentation, and equalization, and engage a robust diversity of intervals between the canonic voices; there are also quasi-mensuration canons and &#145;enigma&#146; canons. The performance method envisaged was vocalization.<br>
<br>In moderation such exercises were a commonplace of musical education, and though Waterhouse's excess may seem &#145;a useless monument of patience and ingenuity&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>), it was regarded with admiration in its day. His Chapel Royal &#145;friend and fellow&#146; Thomas Morley knew well &#145;those never enough praised travailes of master Waterhouse&#146;, wherein he &#145;for varietie surpassed all who ever laboured in that kinde of studie&#146;. Waterhouse's industry and resourcefulness were indeed remarkable, and there can be little dispute with Morley's judgement that the composer's efforts were &#145;sufficient to quench the thirst of the most insaciate scholler whatsoever&#146;  (Morley, 115, 183). In 1636 two manuscript copies of the canons were bequeathed by one Henry Bury to the universities; that destined for Cambridge, in a late sixteenth-century hand, was placed in the university library. Still a gentleman of the Chapel Royal, Waterhouse died on 18 February 1602.<br>
