<span class="headword">Owen <span class="st"> [Owens]</span>,  Thomas</span>  (<em>c.</em>1556&#150;1618), <span class="occ">Jesuit</span>, was born in Winchester &#145;of an ancient Catholic family&#146;, according to contemporaries  (Foley, 7.562). He studied at Winchester and Douai, then read civil and canon law, 1575&#150;8, at Paris. He entered the Society of Jesus at Lyons in 1579. He taught humanities and philosophy at Avignon, 1584&#150;6, and at Tournai, 1586&#150;95, where, despite frail health, he was appointed dean of the language curriculum and professor of logic. He read theology at the Collegio Bradensi, Milan, in 1596&#150;7 prior to taking up his post at the English College in Rome. From 1597 he served at the college as confessor, consultor, and minister under the rectorship of Robert Persons, who urged that he be named his successor. Owen was duly appointed rector on 23 April 1610.<br>
<br>Within two years of his appointment Owen published three English versions of works by two leading French controversialists. Two were by a Jesuit friend, Pierre Coton: <span class="italic">A Letter of a Catholike Man &hellip; [on] the Imputation of the Death of Henry IIII</span> in 1610, then in 1611 <span class="italic">The Copie of a Letter &hellip; an Answere to &hellip; the Anti-Coton</span>, an abridged version of his reply. His last effort was Cardinal Du Perron's initial confrontation with James I. In 1612 appeared his <span class="italic">Letter Written from Paris &hellip; to Monsr. Casaubon in England</span>.<br>
<br>In 1598 Claudio Acquaviva established an administrative structure for the English Jesuits that was unique in the society; this was based upon the document &#145;The office and rules of a prefect&#146;. His actions were unpopular with provincials in Spain and the Spanish Netherlands because the document created a type of ecclesiastical peculiar outside their jurisdiction yet within their geographical provinces. Their protests were rejected by Acquaviva and Owen was named prefect on 27 January 1612. However, at the general congregation convened on Acquaviva's death in 1615 they secured a decree which reduced Owen's powers as specified in &#145;The office and rules&#146;. For three years Owen challenged the legality of the change, citing the authority of Clement VIII and of the previous general, who had established the unique status of the mission and its separate houses to prepare properly a clergy for the unusual problems in England. After Owen's death at the English College, Rome, on 6 December 1618 his views were vindicated since the mission was preserved in a new rank of a vice-province. At his burial in the vault of the church of the English College, Pope Paul V paid tribute to him as a &#145;man of distinguished prudence and a solid religious&#146;  (Foley, 6.224, 531).<br>
