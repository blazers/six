<span class="headword">Harrison family</span>  (<em>per. </em>1715&#150;<em>c.</em>1790), <span class="occ">gun-founders</span>, came to prominence with <a name="cosubject_49090"></a><span class="headword">William Harrison</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1745)<span class="occ"></span>. He and his sons, Andrews and John, were the main suppliers of guns and shot in Britain in the mid-eighteenth century. The origins of William Harrison are unknown, but he is mentioned in Board of Ordnance records in 1715 acting first as surety for Richard Jones, iron-founder in Southwark, then completing his contracts for him. In 1717 he lodged a bond for &pound;1000 with the Treasury before delivering his guns and two years later he was put on the same footing as other contractors. Within a short time he became the most important founder, supplying guns, shot, or cast-iron wheels to the board almost every year until his death. From 1718 until 1744 Harrison had a virtual monopoly selling guns and ammunition to the East India Company. A large part of his business was supplying guns for the company's ships, as well as for other merchantmen; and he also bought old guns from the East India Company and the board, indicating he had access to an air furnace to melt them down.<br>
<br>Harrison had a wide network of partners. Early on he worked with Richard Jones, Samuel Gott, and Stephen Peters, and with William Jukes he leased Robertsbridge furnace, Sussex. He is frequently mentioned in John Fuller's letters, selling guns which had failed proof or lending others to complete contracts for payment. In 1741 Harrison formed a partnership with Samuel Remnant, master smith at Woolwich and Fuller's agent, and John Legas and William Gott of Lamberhurst, between them controlling five wealden furnaces: Lamberhurst, Waldron, Brede, Conster, and Hamsell. Remnant got the most profitable contracts for his partners and the least for Fuller. With so many orders, the partners were able to plan casting programmes, using the capability of each furnace, always having at least one furnace working all year with access to the sea while another was devoted to producing shot. In 1743, out of a total of 752 guns supplied to the board, 591 were from the partners and the following year 324 out of 519. Moreover, since the board paid for the actual weight of iron, Harrison made his guns as heavy as possible within the acceptable limits to maximize his profits. Although owning property in Sussex, Harrison remained in London, living at New Broad Street and leasing Stone Wharf, Southwark, from which he carried out his trade in guns.<br>
<br>William Harrison died in London in January 1745 at New Broad Street, and under his will Remnant and Legas looked after the business interests of his two sons, while Harrison's clerk, Robert Bagshaw, was named guardian. The elder son, <a name="cosubject_49091"></a><span class="headword">Andrews Harrison</span>  (1725&#150;<em>c.</em>1786)<span class="occ"></span>, was born in London on 14 November 1725. His brother <a name="cosubject_49092"></a><span class="headword">John Harrison</span>  (<em>b. </em>1729, <em>d.</em> before 1792)<span class="occ"></span> was also born there, in November 1729. Their father's partnership was dissolved when John came of age in 1750. The board began prosecuting Remnant for stealing iron over many years and accused Legas and the Harrisons of colluding with him to keep the price of iron artificially high. From then on the Harrisons were only employed by the board in time of war. Having also lost their father's monopoly of East India Company business, they concentrated on guns for the export and merchant market.<br>
<br>When the Seven Years' War started in 1756 the board was forced to order guns, shot, and trucks from the Harrisons, now in partnership with Bagshaw and Richard Tapsell, Legas's nephew, because they still controlled more furnaces than anyone else. The Harrison business reached its apogee in 1760, supplying 864 guns out of 1991. Again the numbers derived from intelligent use of several furnaces, rather than from any technical improvements, although they were the only founders willing to cast the very large 42-pounder guns.<br>
<br>At the end of the war the board was in a financial crisis, delaying payments to contractors. Tapsell was declared bankrupt and the Harrisons began to withdraw from casting iron, and let go their furnaces to concentrate on selling instead. This mirrored what was happening generally in the iron industry, where a shortage of skilled labour had led to a slowdown in the spread of gun-founding on a large scale, and caused the closure of many wealden furnaces after the end of the Seven Years' War. This gave competitors a chance to recruit skilled founders, and the war marked the end of the dominance of the wealden gun-founders. For the first time Welsh and midlands founders supplied ordnance. The board believed that again the iron-founders had conspired to keep the cost of iron up, and used the low price offered by the Carron Company of Scotland to force other gun-founders to lower their price. The Harrisons refused to do this.<br>
<br>In the 1770s the business took new directions; the Harrison brothers formed a new company with Samuel Ambrose and Joseph Stanley. They used their old contacts in an important new venture; by 1775 they became agents for John Wilkinson (1728&#150;1808) and his new solid-bored guns with both the Board of Ordnance and the East India Company. During the American War of Independence Wilkinson became one of the most reliable suppliers of guns, consistently producing high-quality guns in large numbers. However the company suffered when the board abruptly cancelled orders, and yet again drastically lowered the price for iron guns at the end of the war. Again the Harrisons refused on behalf of Wilkinson to lower their prices to those offered by the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/47503/', "Walker")</script> family of Rotherham, and again lost the contracts.<br>
<br>During the same period the business changed direction and became increasingly involved in wrought-iron production, taking on new premises in Deptford for anchor making and in Skinnerburn, north-east England, for nail-making. It continued to have some part in the gun trade through its ships' chandlery business at Lime Street, near the Thames. By 1786 a member of the Gordon family replaced Ambrose as a partner. By this time the Harrisons were playing a smaller part in the business; Andrews died about 1786 and John was dead by 1792. The new firm of Gordon and Stanley continued to represent John Wilkinson until 1797, after which it gave up the gun trade. It remained in maritime ironmongery, and under the name of Gordon Brothers it was able to enter the new industry of building iron ships at its yards in Deptford from 1828 until 1843.<br>
