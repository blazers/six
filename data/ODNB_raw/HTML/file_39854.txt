<span class="headword">Paget,  Reginald Thomas Guy Des Voeux</span>, Baron Paget of Northampton  (1908&#150;1990), <span class="occ">politician, barrister, and master of foxhounds</span>, was born on 2 September 1908 at Sulby Hall, Northamptonshire, the younger son and second of three children of Major Thomas Guy Frederick Paget, sometime independent tory MP for the Bosworth division of Leicestershire, and his wife, (Emma) Bettine, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32795/', "Sir (George) William Des Voeux")</script>, colonial governor. He was educated at Eton College and at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he read law, receiving a third class in part one of the tripos in 1928. He then decided to read for an ordinary degree and passed parts one and two of military studies, which would have enabled him to achieve an ordinary BA, for which, however, he never presented himself. It was while an undergraduate at Cambridge that he joined the Labour Party, a decision not unusual in the political climate of the time but made perhaps more striking in his case by the fact that the previous five generations of his family had all been tory MPs. During the 1930s he practised as a barrister, having been called to the bar in 1934.<br>
<br>Within the Labour Party, for which Paget fought his first (unsuccessful) parliamentary election at Northampton in 1935, he was always something of an anomaly. Once he reached Westminster in 1945, winning Northampton at his second attempt, he contrived to represent the voice of the squirearchy far more convincingly than anyone on the Conservative benches. His socialism was essentially paternalistic, and it was typical of him that he should have thought nothing of receiving a delegation of trade unionists while still dressed in his full hunting kit. He took silk in 1947.<br>
<br>Before becoming a life peer in 1974, Paget sat in the House of Commons for twenty-nine years. In all that time he was only briefly the recipient of preferment from his party. From 1960 to 1964 he was a junior opposition spokesman first for the Royal Navy (during the Second World War he had served in the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve before being invalided out in 1943) and then for the army; but the death of Hugh Gaitskell in 1963 put paid to any hopes he may have held of progressing to government office. An outspoken critic of Harold Wilson during the leadership election which followed Gaitskell's death, he never relented in his belief that Wilson was quite the wrong man to lead the Labour Party or, indeed, to be prime minister.<br>
<br>In appearance and diction more like a whig grandee from an earlier age, Paget was nevertheless a man of parts. Said to be the slowest speaker in the house, Paget had a long chin and beetling brows. An intrepid yachtsman, a fearless rider to hounds (he must have been the only Labour MP ever to become master of the Pytchley, a position he held from 1968 to 1971), he was also a competent amateur painter (he held his first exhibition at the Fine Arts Gallery at Ebury Street, London, in 1988), as well as being the author of three books. The first, <span class="italic">Manstein, his Campaigns and his Trial</span> (1951), commemorated his spirited defence of Field Marshal Fritz Erich von Manstein, for which he waived his normal barrister's fees, before one of the last war crimes tribunals in 1949; the second, co-authored with his fellow Labour MP Sydney Silverman, arose in part out of the Christopher Craig and Derek Bentley murder case of 1953 and conveyed its message in its title <span class="italic">Hanged&#151;and Innocent?</span> (1953); while the third, and far the most ambitious, <span class="italic">The Human Journey</span>, published in 1979 well after his retirement from the Commons, represented an attempt to tell the whole story of the human race.<br>
<br>Courage, sometimes leading to recklessness, was in fact the hallmark of Paget's career. In 1963, after a row in the Commons over the extradition of Chief Enahoro of Nigeria who, he argued, should properly have been regarded as a political refugee, he insisted on reporting the attorney-general of the day, Sir John Hobson, to the inn (the Inner Temple) to which they both belonged, almost certainly the first time a queen's counsel (and fellow bencher) had taken such action against a law officer of the crown. But then no one was ever less a respecter of rank, station, or person, and it was this total lack of deference in his otherwise patrician character which clinched Paget's claim to be considered a genuine radical.<br>
<br>In 1931 Paget married Sybil Helen (Nancy), daughter of Sills Clifford Gibbons, of Scaynes Hill, Sussex, widow of Sir John Bridger Shiffner, sixth baronet, and former wife of Sir Victor Basil John Seely, fourth baronet. They had no children of their own. In London Paget tended to lead a faintly eighteenth-century bachelor life. But his roots were in the country and in particular at his family home, Lubenham Lodge, Market Harborough, where he and his wife brought up four adopted children, two boys and two girls. They were the offspring of an RAF pilot, whose wife died when the children were young. Paget adopted them because the father did not want them split up, and, when the father retired from the RAF, gave him a job and took him into the household too. He separated from his wife before his death and entered into a relationship with Diana Spearman (formerly of the Conservative Research Department), the widow of Sir Alexander (Alec) Spearman, Conservative MP for Scarborough and Whitby, which caused some embarrassment to his country friends. He died on 2 January 1990, at his London home, 9 Grosvenor Cottages.<br>
