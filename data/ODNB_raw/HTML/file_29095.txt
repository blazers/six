<span class="headword">West,  Richard</span>  (1716&#150;1742), <span class="occ">poet</span>, was the only son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29094/', "Richard West (c.1691&#150;1726)")</script>, lawyer, playwright, and politician, and Elizabeth Burnet (1692&#150;1748), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4061/', "Gilbert Burnet")</script>. He was educated at Eton College with Thomas Ashton, Thomas Gray, and Horace Walpole, forming a &#145;quadruple alliance&#146; of friendship, and was known among them as Favonius. In youth he was &#145;tall and slim, of a pale and meagre look and complexion&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works of Thomas Gray</span>, 1.cv), and he was then reckoned a more brilliant genius than Gray  (Mason, 3). The rest of the friends went to Cambridge, but West matriculated from Christ Church, Oxford, on 22 May 1735 at the age of nineteen.<br>
<br>West was from his youth marked out for the profession of the bar, through the influential positions of his father and his uncle, Sir Thomas Burnet, and he was admitted a student at the Inner Temple between November 1732 and November 1733  (<span class="italic">Calendar of Inner Temple Records</span>). On 21 February 1738 he was at Dartmouth Street, Westminster; by the following April he had left Oxford, and was studying at the Inner Temple. Gray went to London in September 1738 to join him at the bar, but was drawn off into travelling to France and Italy with Horace Walpole. West wearied of legal study, and moved out of lodgings at the Inner Temple in June 1740. West wrote to Gray from Bond Street to inform him of his move (5 June 1740); Gray wrote back from Florence (16 July 1740), encouraging West to persevere with the law  (<span class="italic">Correspondence of Thomas Gray</span>, 1.164, 167&#150;70). West then thought of the army as a profession, but his strength was failing, and in September 1741 Gray found his friend ill and weary in London.<br>
<br>In March 1742 West was at Pope's (or Popes), 2 miles to the west of Hatfield in Hertfordshire, the seat of David Mitchell. He wrote to Gray from Pope's (4 April 1742), enclosing Latin verses he wrote at 4 a.m., being unable to sleep for chronic coughing  (<span class="italic">Correspondence of Thomas Gray</span>, 1.189&#150;91). He died at Pope's of &#145;a consumption&#146;  (Horace Walpole, letter to Sir Horace Mann, 24 June 1742, Walpole, <span class="italic">Corr.</span>, 17.468&#150;9) on 1 June 1742. He was buried in the chancel of Hatfield church, immediately before the altar-rails, and a gravestone to his memory was placed in the floor. Thomas Ashton wrote an elegy on his death, which was printed in the <span class="italic">London Magazine</span> in June 1742 (11.305). The elegy was later reprinted in the <span class="italic">European Magazine</span> in January 1798 (7.45). Before reading of West's death, Gray sent him a letter enclosing his &#145;Ode on the Spring&#146;. This letter was returned unopened. In response to West's death Gray wrote an English sonnet (&#145;In vain to me the smiling mornings shine&#146;) and elegiac verses in Latin with which he abruptly concluded &#145;De principiis cogitandi&#146;, a poem addressed to West.<br>
<br>Most of West's small output of poetry was enclosed in letters to Gray. &#145;Ad amicos&#146;, an imitation of Tibullus (book 3, elegy 5) was sent from Christ Church, Oxford (4 July 1737). An elegiac epistle in heroic couplets, it describes the poet's isolation and anticipates his early death in obscurity. He expresses the desire only to raise his tomb in the breasts of his friends. Two Latin elegies were sent in later letters, and an &#145;Ode to May&#146; (&#145;Dear Gray, that always in my heart&#146;) on 5 May 1742. The &#145;Ode to May&#146;, which invokes Gray to join West in summoning the &#145;tardy May&#146; to resume her reign, produced Gray's &#145;Ode on the Spring&#146; in response. These poems by West were published in Robert Anderson's collection (1795; 10.237&#150;9). West also wrote a &#145;Monody on the Death of Queen Caroline&#146;, which was published in Robert Dodsley's <span class="italic">Collection of Poems by Several Hands</span> (1748; 2.269&#150;75). Gray and John Mitford both intended to collect and publish West's remains, but did not carry out their projects. West's works are included in section 2 of Duncan C. Tovey's <span class="italic">Gray and his Friends</span> (1890).<br>
<br>West's letters to Gray were first published in Mason's edition of <span class="italic">The Poems of Mr. Gray</span> (1775). The standard modern edition is <span class="italic">Correspondence of Thomas Gray</span>, ed. Paget Toynbee and Leonard Whibley (3 vols., 1935; with corrections and additions by H. W. Starr, 1971, vol. 1). West's letters to Walpole and Ashton, in addition to those to Gray, were published in <span class="italic">The Correspondence of Gray, Walpole, West and Ashton</span> (ed. Paget Toynbee, 2 vols., 1915). The standard edition of West's letters to and from Walpole is <span class="italic">Horace Walpole's Correspondence</span> (ed. W. S. Lewis, vol. 13, ed. George L. Lam and Charles H. Bennett, 1948, 90&#150;250). Appendix 6 (14.249&#150;55) of the Lam and Bennett volume also includes extant parts of West's unfinished play <span class="italic">Pausanias</span>.<br>
<br>West's premature death limited his writings to a small number of poems. But Edmund Gosse commented that they &#145;are of sufficient merit to permit us to believe that had he lived he might have achieved a reputation among the minor poets of his age&#146;  (Gosse, 5). As it is, his name lives in his friend Gray's poetry, and in his letters to the members of the Quadruple Alliance.<br>
