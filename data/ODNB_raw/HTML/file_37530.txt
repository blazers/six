<span class="headword">Bray,  Henry</span>  (<em>b. </em>before 1248, <em>d.</em> 1311<span class="mult">x</span>13), <span class="occ">administrator</span>, first appears in surviving records, but already in a responsible position, in 1269. He is therefore likely to have been born some years before 1248. He was the son of William de Bray of Hinton, near Woodford Halse in Northamptonshire. His use of the title <i>magister</i> indicates that he had received a university education, presumably at Oxford. In the late 1260s and early 1270s he is to be found as the business agent of the west midland baron John de Verdon.<br>
<br>In 1273 Bray became a king's clerk. His first royal commission was levying arrears of a clerical tenth granted to the king. Later the same year he was appointed to the custody of various Welsh castles and honours that had come into the king's hands on the death of George de Cantilupe, lord of Abergavenny, at about the beginning of November. In 1275 he surrendered custody of Cilgerran but retained Abergavenny itself until 1281, and was embroiled during this period in a number of disputes with the tenants of the honour. In 1281 he was commissioned by the king to search the chirograph chests for all deeds relating to Jewish debts which had come into the king's hands through the forfeiture of the creditors concerned, and then to levy those debts for the king. Shortly afterwards he was also given the status of a justice of the Jews. He was paid as such until 1287, and in 1290 was still in possession of a key to the Jewish treasury, but it is doubtful whether he actually served as a justice for most of this period, since in February 1283 he was appointed to the full-time position of escheator of England south of Trent.<br>
<br>Bray held this position until May 1290, when he was arrested and sent to the Tower of London and his lands seized, probably as the result of an allegation made against him in the course of the &#145;state trials&#146; of 1289&#150;93. The contemporary chronicler Bartholomew Cotton records that Bray attempted to drown himself <i>en route</i> for the Tower, and that he also tried to dash his brains out while in custody, but he came to no harm and by October had been released and begun paying a fine. By Easter term 1292, however, he was back in the Tower and his lands once more in the king's hands, apparently after a second conviction. Although the amount of his fine was fixed at 2000 marks as early as October 1292, he remained in prison in the Tower, and later in Winchester Castle, until 1294, when his release was obtained in return for a promise by Bray and his sureties to pay the fine off at the rate of 300 marks a year. In 1299 he reached an agreement with the king, granting the latter some of the Northamptonshire lands he had acquired in return for a remission of all the king's financial claims against him. He was never again employed directly by the king.<br>
<br>There is no evidence that Henry Bray was ever married, and by 1284 he had taken orders in the church that were incompatible with married status. He is, however, known to have had a son, also named Henry. He was still alive at the end of 1311 but was dead by September 1313.<br>
