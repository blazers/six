<span class="headword">Arundell,  Blanche</span> <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Lady Blanche Somerset]</span>, Lady Arundell of Wardour  (1583/4&#150;1649), <span class="occ">royalist noblewoman</span>, was the sixth daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26005/', "Edward Somerset, fourth earl of Worcester (c.1550&#150;1628)")</script>, and his wife, Lady Elizabeth Hastings (<i>d</i>. 1621), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/12566/', "Francis Hastings, second earl of Huntingdon")</script>. Nothing is known of her early life. In 1607 (the settlement made following the marriage was dated 11 May) she married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/727/', "Thomas Arundell (c.1586&#150;1643)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/726/', "Arundell, Thomas (c.1560&#150;1639)")</script>], eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/726/', "Thomas Arundell, first Baron Arundell of Wardour")</script>, who succeeded to the title in 1639. Their eldest son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/716/', "Henry Arundell")</script>, was baptized on 23 February 1608 at St Andrew's, Holborn. The Arundells were living at their chief residence of Wardour Castle, Wiltshire, when the civil war broke out. Lord Arundell raised a regiment of horse for the king; he was wounded at the battle of Stratton on 16 May 1643 and died three days later at Oxford.<br>
<br>About the same time Lady Arundell was engaged in her own battle to hold Wardour Castle for the king. Originally built by John Lovell, fifth Lord Lovell, at the turn of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, the castle had been extensively modified about 1578 by Lord Arundell's grandfather Sir Matthew Arundell. These changes, including the construction of windows, had reduced its effectiveness as a fortress, yet it remained a formidable stronghold and its defences were reinforced in the early months of the civil war. In her husband's absence Lady Arundell was in command; also at Wardour was her daughter-in-law, Cicely Compton, wife of her son Henry, with her three young sons. On 2 May 1643 parliamentarian forces under Sir Edward Hungerford and Colonel William Stroud arrived before the castle, offering terms of surrender which allegedly denied quarter to its adult male occupants. Lady Blanche refused: &#145;she had a command from her Lord to keep it, and she would obey his command&#146;. Her defence inspired much purple prose, not least from the royalist propagandist Bruno Ryves. In the castle were &#145;but twenty-five fighting men to make good the place against an army of 1300&#146;, though the maidservants, &#145;valiant beyond their sex&#146;, helped them load the muskets. The constant bombardment day and night for six days left the defenders &#145;so distracted between hunger and want of rest, that when the hand endeavoured to administer food, surprised with sleep it forgot its employment, the morsels falling from their hands&#146;  (Ryves, 1.448).<br>
<br>The future regicide Edmund Ludlow, then a captain of a troop of horse in Hungerford's regiment, arrived the day the castle fell, 8 May, and was appointed its governor. He provides a rather more sardonic and ungenerous account of the fall of the castle. After nearly a week the parliamentarians' two small field pieces had done no more than damage one of the house's chimneys. However:<blockquote>there being a vault on each side of the castle, for the conveying away of filth, two or three barrels of powder were put into one of them, and being fired blew up some part of it; which with the grazing of a bullet upon the face of one of the servants, and the threatening of the besiegers to spring the other mine, and then to storm it, if it was not surrendered before an hour glass, which they had turned up, was run out, so terrified the ladies within, whereof there was great number, that they agreed to surrender it. (<span class="italic">Memoirs of Edmund Ludlow</span>, 1.51)</blockquote>Conceding that none of the defenders was killed, royalist correspondents were incensed by the plundering of the house, contrary to the articles of surrender. Bruno Ryves was especially exercised by the fate of &#145;one extraordinary chimney piece, valued at two thousand pounds&#146;, whose elaborate carvings the roundheads found offensive. &#145;Five cart loads of their richest hangings&#146; were taken, together with full wardrobes, leaving &#145;neither the ladies nor the servants nor any other wearing clothes but what was on their backs&#146;  (Ryves, 1.449). To the writers of the parliamentarian newsbooks, however, Wardour was not a private house cruelly violated, but rather a castle, which had acted as a storehouse for the wealth of the Wiltshire royalists: discovered within was &#145;great wealth in plate and money, which all the nobility and gentry in those parts had brought hither for safeguard, amongst which Lord Cottington's is the chief&#146;  (<span class="italic">Certaine Informations</span>, 18.140). A further charge, that the house was a centre for papists, cannot in this instance simply be dismissed as propaganda, for the Arundell family had a long record of fidelity to the Catholic religion. John Falconer, nephew and namesake of a leading Jesuit missioner, was chaplain at Wardour during the siege and drew up the articles of surrender.<br>
<br>After the fall of Wardour the prisoners were taken to Shaftesbury. Lady Arundell was already ill, and because epidemic disease was rife in Bath it was decided to send them to Dorchester instead, &#145;a place&#146;, Ryves observed darkly, &#145;no less dangerous for the infection of schism and rebellion than bath for the plague and small pox&#146;  (Ryves, 1.451). The prisoners were separated and her grandchildren exchanged in May 1644 for the children of a parliamentarian peer. Lady Arundell was released, probably before the end of May, and allowed to proceed to Salisbury, where she was provided with accommodation by the royalist commander, the marquess of Hertford; shortly after her arrival she heard of the death of her husband. In September 1643 her son Henry, now third Baron Arundell, laid siege to Edmund Ludlow's garrison in Wardour Castle, retaking it in March 1644. Lady Blanche died on 28 October 1649 at Winchester, aged sixty-five, and was buried at Tisbury beside her husband. Her will was dated 28 September and proved on 2 November 1649.<br>
