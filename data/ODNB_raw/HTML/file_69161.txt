<span class="headword">Williamson,  John</span> <span class="st"> [<em>nicknamed </em>Johnny Notions]</span>  (<em>c.</em>1730&#150;<em>c.</em>1796), <span class="occ">smallpox inoculator</span>, was the son of Andrew Williamson; otherwise his parentage and place of birth are obscure. From the late 1740s at least, Williamson lived at Hamnavoe, Esha Ness, in the north-west of the Shetland mainland. A tenant of the most prosperous merchant&#150;landlord in the islands, Williamson had a reasonably sized farm by Shetland standards (10 arable acres), and was well placed geographically for deep-sea fishing, a condition of tenure in Shetland at that time. He married Christian Nicolson, and they had at least five children.<br>
<br>Since 1700 the Shetlands had been afflicted by devastating visitations of smallpox, which (because of the islands' remoteness, and the inability of the inhabitants to acquire immunity) killed children and adults alike. These epidemics arrived every twenty years, and Williamson may have caught the disease himself, as most children did, in a particularly severe outbreak in 1740. There was no inoculation in the islands until 1758, and even then it was available only for the well-off. It was not until the late 1760s that popular inoculators began to practise in the islands.<br>
<br>By that time Williamson was turning away from the sea to new interests. He seems to have succeeded in a series of occupations: he was, said an observer, &#145;a tailor, a joiner, a clock and watch-mender, a blacksmith, and a physician&#146;  (Dishington, 543). Williamson now turned his attention to inoculation. He used the not too invasive method perfected by his contemporary Daniel Sutton in Essex, with interesting local elaborations. To lessen the virulence of his smallpox matter he dried it in peat smoke and then buried it with camphor. He seems to have collected large amounts of matter, because there is evidence that he sometimes buried it for seven or eight years. &#145;This self-taught practitioner&#146;, wrote a local clergyman, &#145;finds from experience, that it always proves milder to the patient, when it has lost a considerable degree of its strength&#146;  (ibid.). Williamson rejected a lancet in favour of a home-made knife. With it he made the smallest possible incision in the outer skin of his patient's arm, without releasing blood, and inserted a tiny amount of matter. He immediately replaced the skin, and, said the clergyman, &#145;the only plaister he uses, for healing the wound, is a bit of cabbage leaf&#146;  (ibid.).<br>
<br>Williamson was an extremely successful inoculator. There are reports that he inoculated several thousand subjects without losing a single patient. According to Arthur Edmondston, the son of Shetland's pioneer inoculator, Williamson &#145;met with such unexampled success in his practice, that were I not able to bear testimony to its truth, I should myself be disposed to be sceptical on the subject&#146;  (Edmondston, 2.87). For Edmondston:<blockquote>The most extraordinary part of the proceeding is, the purification of the matter, which, under his management, seems to resist the influence of powers which destroy the very contagion itself. Had every practitioner been as uniformly successful in the disease as he was, the small-pox might have been banished from the face of the earth. (ibid.)</blockquote>The efforts of Williamson, and other plebeian inoculators in the Shetlands, had an important effect on the islands' demography and economy, which had been restricted by regular smallpox epidemics earlier in the century.<br>
<br>In his later years Williamson was in business at Hamnavoe as a joiner&#150;carpenter and tailor, but he also entered into contracts with landowners to inoculate their tenantry. He seems to have died on Shetland about 1796, and was buried in an unmarked grave in the churchyard at Esha Ness. The semi-derisive nickname bestowed on him during his life, and still used today&#151;Johnny Notions&#151;suggests that, notwithstanding his ability, his contemporaries were a little wary of the remarkable man who saved so many lives on the islands.<br>
