<span class="headword">Ashenden,  John</span>  (<em>d.</em> in or before 1368?), <span class="occ">astrologer</span>, was a Northumbrian who became a fellow of Merton College, Oxford; he spoke of events in Northumberland as &#145;in partibus meis&#146;  (Ashenden, fol. 121<i>v</i>). It is likely that he was a native of Ashington, not too far removed from the church appropriated by Merton College at Ponteland. He first appears in an account of disbursements to Merton fellows dated February 1337. He took an active part in college affairs, helping secure Merton's rights to the church at Embleton in 1341 and supervising activities at the college's northern properties in the 1350s. In a college document of 1340 he is styled <i>magister</i>. After his MA Ashenden studied medicine and theology, but is not recorded as having taken an advanced degree. Nevertheless, he belonged to a scholarly circle, based on Merton College, which was devoted to the study of astronomy and astrology. The members of this group included Simon Bredon, Reginald Lambourne, William Merle, William Rede, and Nicholas Sandwich.<br>
<br>Ashenden specialized in making astrological judgements of eclipses and the conjunctions of planets. The first of his treatises (which are preserved as <span class="italic">Pronosticationes</span> in Bodl. Oxf., MS Digby 176) concerned a lunar eclipse and a conjunction of Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn which had occurred in March 1345. From these events he divined mayhem, warfare, and &#145;great mortality&#146;. The battles of Cr&eacute;cy and Nevilles Cross in 1346 and the arrival of the black death in 1348 appeared dramatically to confirm his predictions. Early in 1349 he drafted another treatise in which he argued that &#145;dry&#146; celestial influences would neutralize the &#145;cold-wet&#146; nature of the plague. The disease would become less contagious and would finally disappear. Again the course of events seemed to follow his general prognostication. Two later tracts dealt with eclipses and planetary conjunctions occurring in 1357 and 1365 respectively. In keeping with the theory of great conjunctions as enunciated by Abu Ma&#145;shar (Albumasar), Ashenden considered the alignment of Jupiter and Saturn in 1365 to be particularly significant. He believed that the celestial event strongly indicated victory over the French in the Hundred Years' War, the destruction of Islam through a glorious crusade, troubles for the pope, and the emergence of a new religious sect. Although he took account of the possibility of religious turmoil, he was careful to deny that eschatological or millenarian speculation could be validated through astrology.<br>
<br>In 1346 Ashenden began to compile his most ambitious work, the <span class="italic">Summa astrologiae judicialis de accidentibus mundi</span>, which he completed in December 1348. His purpose was to elucidate the theories of celestial influence upon large-scale terrestrial events (usually catastrophic in nature&#151;wars, epidemics, famines, great storms) and the astrological methods of predicting these events. The <span class="italic">Summa</span> contains very little material original to Ashenden; it is instead an exhaustive sourcebook of astrological writings of such traditional authorities as Ptolemy, Abu Ma&#145;shar, al-Qabi&#145;si (Alcabitius), and Ali ibn Abi 'l-Rijal (Haly Abenragel). Ashenden also utilized the writings of contemporaries such as Thomas Bradwardine, Simon Bredon, William Merle, and Walter Oddington, and numerous other sources. He copied the original texts so faithfully that the manuscripts he used which are now extant can often be identified. The <span class="italic">Summa</span> is a fine example of the plagiaristic &#145;cut-and-paste&#146; style of academic writing common in the fourteenth century. And for the next two hundred years the <span class="italic">Summa</span> was valued as an astrological reference book, gaining wide European distribution in manuscript and in printed form. In the fifteenth century it was rendered into Middle English  (Cambridge, Trinity College, MS O.5.26; Bodl. Oxf., MS Ashmole 396) and Middle Dutch  (Haarlem, Stadsbibliotheek, MS 187 D 4, dated 1480). Johannes Lucilius Santritter prepared the printed Latin edition of 1489 in Venice.<br>
<br>Ashenden was a purely academic astrologer. There is no evidence that he sought to exploit his astrological predictions for advancement in ecclesiastical or royal service. In fact, he spent his entire career at Oxford University and was recorded among the fellows of Merton in 1355. Although he may have vacated his fellowship shortly thereafter, he dedicated his 1357 and 1365 treatises to the exercise and recreation of his associates at Merton. He was probably dead by 1368, as he is not mentioned in the will of his friend Simon Bredon, which was drawn up in that year. In addition to the writings noted above, a medical recipe  (Parma, Misti MS B 26, fols. 27<i>v</i>&#150;29<i>r</i>) and a tract entitled <span class="italic">De tribus conjunctionibus</span>  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Ashmole 393, fols. 79&#150;80) have been dubiously ascribed to Ashenden.<br>
