<span class="headword">Benson, Sir  Reginald Lindsay <span class="st"> [Rex]</span></span>  (1889&#150;1968), <span class="occ">army officer and merchant banker</span>, was born on 20 August 1889 at 16 South Street, Mayfair, London, the second of the five children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/48999/', "Robert Henry Benson (1850&#150;1929)")</script>, merchant banker and art collector, and his wife, Evelyn Mary (1856&#150;1943), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37559/', "Robert Stayner Holford (1808&#150;1892)")</script>, art collector and MP, of Westonbirt, Gloucestershire, and Dorchester House. He had two brothers and two sisters and was educated at Ludgrove School, Wokingham, at Eton College, where he was captain of cricket and president of Pop, and at Balliol College, Oxford.<br>
<br>Benson's career as a soldier began in 1909 when, having overcome his father's opposition, he left Oxford after only a year and entered into an attachment with the Life Guards. In 1910 he was gazetted a subaltern in the 9th Queen's Royal Lancers. Impatient to join the regiment he could not bear to wait for its imminent return from South Africa and so paid for the journey out by working as a stoker on a Union Castle steamer. In 1913 he was appointed aide-de-camp to the viceroy of India, Sir Charles Hardinge; he was able to score some notable polo victories in India, in the same year winning the coveted Calcutta cup with fellow aide-de-camp John Astor, against a team of Indian princes.<br>
<br>Rex Benson rejoined his regiment, which formed part of the 2nd cavalry brigade, in France in August 1914; he survived the battle of the Aisne despite, he wrote to Hardinge, having &#145;had two horses shot, and my pipe taken out of my mouth by a shrapnel bullet&#146;  (private information). After serving at Ypres and then Messines, where he and three others defended the regimental aid post (housing the wounded) for forty-six hours under continual fire from the Germans who were within 50 yards, he was awarded one of the first Military Crosses. In May 1915, during the second battle of Ypres, he was severely gassed and wounded by a bullet that destroyed the brachial artery and the nerves of his right arm, after which he endured numerous operations at Dorchester House, which was turned into a hospital for the duration of the war.<br>
<br>From there, with his arm still in a sling, Benson was sent officially as liaison officer with the <i>minist&egrave;re de la marine</i> in Paris but unofficially as representative of the head of the secret service (MIIC). This involved some curious work with the head of the French <i>s&ucirc;ret&eacute;</i>. After service in Ireland during the 1916 uprising he returned to France as liaison officer with General Franchet D'Esperay, commanding the <i>groupe des arm&eacute;es du nord</i>, and then with Marshal Petain at the French headquarters at Compi&egrave;gne. The success of his role was acknowledged by the French, who awarded him the Croix de Guerre and made him a member of the L&eacute;gion d'honneur. After the armistice he became chief of the British Mission and was attached to the staff of Sir Henry Wilson at the peace conference. While in France he had also been appointed to the DSO and mentioned four times in dispatches.<br>
<br>Promoted major in 1920 Benson next accepted the post of military secretary to the governor of Bombay, Sir George Lloyd, and in 1922 he helped to organize the highly successful official tour of the prince of Wales, for which he became MVO. On his return home that year he resigned his commission and was almost immediately entrusted with a covert mission by Lloyd George to try to reopen trade with post-revolutionary Russia. He was given a large cargo of tea, among other basic commodities, and sent to Batumi without possessing a word of Russian. It turned out to be a language it was then much safer not to know: his Russian-speaking companion, Tommy Carr, was flung into gaol, leaving Benson, dressed as a Russian, to travel across country to Moscow. Undaunted he proceeded to sell &pound;10,000 of goods, hiding the payment in banknotes inside his boots. He was searched at the Russian&#150;Polish frontier but, fortunately, not asked to remove his boots. The Bank of England duly honoured the bundle of notes without question, even though they appeared somewhat worn and full of holes.<br>
<br>Benson's father, however, decided that such escapades were no substitute for a career and that Rex should learn the business of banking at the family firm of Robert Benson &amp; Co. In 1924 the partnership was reconstituted to include Rex Benson and his two brothers and, after his father's death in 1929, Benson set about trying to modernize the firm and improve its profitability. The Bensons' personal and banking exposure to US securities was large at the time of the Wall Street crash, with the result that their investment management business&#151;the mainstay of the firm&#151;faded to nothing, and the whole office sat idle. Despite this Rex Benson and his brothers refused to make any staff redundant, indeed they rewarded them with bonuses for having worked so well during a trying period.<br>
<br>Conditions improved, however, to the extent that by 1934 the firm had recovered almost all of its lost capital as the performance of its stable of investment trusts had improved. In 1928 Benson had been given by his father a dormant investment trust, the English and New York, to revitalize. Its capital of &pound;750,000 plummeted in the depression but by 1935 Benson, through hard work and enthusiasm coupled with the skill and experience of his chosen co-directors, had increased its capital to &pound;1.35 million. He also made many business trips to North America, where he vigorously exploited the firm's long-standing connections and developed underwriting and new-issue business. He was, in the words of a colleague at Bensons, &#145;a devil for work&#146;, and in 1936 he succeeded his elder brother Guy as chairman of Robert Benson &amp; Co. In November 1932 he married Leslie, formerly wife of the publisher Cond&eacute; Nast, and daughter of Albert Volney Foster, investment banker, of Lake Forest, Illinois. They raised a daughter from her previous marriage and their two sons.<br>
<br>In September 1939, though aged fifty and despondent at the outbreak of another war, Benson served as liaison officer to the French First Army until the evacuation from Dunkirk. He was appointed chairman of the inter-allied timber commission in 1940, and then in 1941 he became, with the rank of colonel, military attach&eacute; at the British embassy in Washington, under Lord Halifax. The appointment owed much to his excellent high-level connections in America and, with a brief to try to persuade America to enter the war on the allied side, he immediately undertook a series of speaking engagements throughout the country. Wherever Benson went he knew people, but he always knew more by the time he left. He possessed a delightful way of getting on with everybody&#151;literally from the lift operator to the chairman or prime minister.<br>
<br>After the war Benson returned to the chairmanship of Bensons and oversaw the resurgence of its investment banking business. The problem of inadequate capitalization was resolved in 1947 by merging with the Lonsdale Investment Trust, a quoted public company, to form Robert Benson Lonsdale &amp; Co. (RBL) under his chairmanship. He continued to concentrate on the firm's American investment holdings, remembering his father's adage, &#145;to keep on the inside track with management&#146;, by travelling over twice a year to see brokers and directors of companies in which RBL had an interest. Although he had no formal training or technical expertise, he was an astute banker; he was adept at identifying investment opportunities, especially in smaller North American companies, and at finding the talent to run them. He valued people and excelled in personnel management. Despite the increase in staff at Bensons he continued to know everyone who worked for him. As Jim Deacon, a long-serving commissionaire, pointed out, &#145;I don't work for Sir Rex, he works for me&#146;. He was decisive, sometimes too impulsive, and an excellent communicator.<br>
<br>In 1958 Benson was knighted for his contribution to the work of the English Speaking Union, of which he had been honorary treasurer for thirty-three years and joint deputy chairman since 1957. He was a trustee of, and instrumental in starting, the Winston Churchill Memorial Trust, for which he personally met the development cost in the early years. To these and the many other organizations and projects with which he was involved he brought a strength of purpose, an inexhaustible enthusiasm, and an endearing modesty: he never spoke of his many exploits or achievements because his mind was entirely focused on the future and on what he could do next. Whether it was international polo&#151;he played to a 7 handicap and picked, purchased, and managed the ponies for the British teams; or sheep farming&#151;he improved the stock at his farm in Singleton, Sussex, to win two championships at the royal show in 1960 and 1968&#151;he devoted himself with unquenchable energy and panache to the task at hand.<br>
<br>Benson possessed a talent for friendship. His bright blue eyes would sparkle with high spirits and a wide smile would crease his aquiline features as he entered a room. His warmth and gaiety were exhilarating and he was wonderful company. He played the piano impeccably by ear, often singing songs by Cole Porter, whom he had known well in Paris at the end of the First World War.<br>
<br>Under Benson's chairmanship RBL achieved growth and greater profitability, and it moved up the league table of City issuing houses. In March 1959 he retired from the chairmanship aged seventy, but he remained on the board until 1961. He thus oversaw the merger that year between Robert Benson Lonsdale and Kleinwort Sons &amp; Co. to form Kleinwort Benson Lonsdale Ltd, of which he was a director. Sir Rex Benson died suddenly from a heart attack, while on board an aeroplane awaiting take-off at Naples airport, on 26 September 1968. He was survived by his wife.<br>
