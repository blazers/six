<span class="headword">Franklin,  William</span>  (1730/31&#150;1813), <span class="occ">colonial governor</span>, was born after November 1730 in Philadelphia, the eldest child of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/52466/', "Benjamin Franklin (1706&#150;1790)")</script>, inventor and statesman, and either his common-law wife, Deborah Read Rogers (1705?&#150;1774), the daughter of John Read and his wife, Sarah, or a mistress. He grew up above his father's printing shop on lower Market Street with his siblings Francis and Sarah.<br>
<br>Franklin was educated locally at Annand's classical academy, Philadelphia, from 1738 to 1743, then, thwarted in his wish to go to sea, in 1746 enlisted for a military campaign in Canada. Later he joined an Indian treaty expedition in the Ohio territory. He no longer lived in the Franklin household, and Deborah publicly and &#145;in the foulest terms&#146; was heard to call him &#145;the greatest Villain upon Earth&#146;  (&#145;Diary of Daniel Fisher&#146;, 276)&#151;unlikely maternal sentiments. He studied law, and in the early 1750s, when Benjamin Franklin was elected to the Pennsylvania assembly, he turned over to his son its clerkship and, later, other colonial offices. Franklin became grand secretary of Philadelphia's masonic lodge. In 1752 he joined his father in the famous kite experiment with electricity, and in 1754 accompanied him to the Albany conference on colonial defence and the following year to confer with General Braddock, whom Franklin assisted in procuring military provisions.<br>
<br>Firm opponents of Pennsylvania's proprietors, Franklin and his father departed for London in 1757 on the elder's mission to counter them. The Franklins lodged at 7 Craven Street, Strand. After studying at the Middle Temple, Franklin was called to the bar on 10 November 1758 and then travelled with his father through Britain and Europe. When his father received an honorary doctorate from Oxford on 30 April 1762, Franklin was awarded an honorary MA, being described as &#145;learned in municipal law&#146;  (<span class="italic">Papers</span>, 10.76). Tall and handsome, he plunged into social life, one result being the birth of a son, William Temple Franklin, probably in 1760, to an unknown mother. When his father left for Philadelphia in 1762, he remained in London and received the royal governorship of New Jersey, probably through the agency of the earl of Bute. He took the oaths on 9 September 1762, five days after marrying Elizabeth Downes (<i>bap</i>. 1728, <i>d</i>. 1777).<br>
<br>The governor and his wife arrived in America in February 1763 and settled in Burlington, New Jersey. Caught between the demands of London and those of his colony, Franklin erroneously believed that the 1765 <span class="roman">Stamp Act</span> could &#145;be quietly carried into Execution throughout&#146; New Jersey  (TNA: PRO, CO 5/987), while, later, he was castigated by London for not thwarting local action against the <span class="roman">Townshend Acts</span>. Vigorously using his position to forward private enrichment schemes, in 1766 he led the way in forming the Illinois Company, which vainly sought a massive grant of land from the crown. He built a grand house facing the Delaware River and farmed 600 acres outside Burlington. He practised his Anglican faith as religiously as befitted his position and in 1772 was elected a member of the London-based Society for the Propagation of the Gospel.<br>
<br>For several years Franklin provided his father, now back in England, with colonial intelligence. As he continued to oppose Pennsylvania's proprietors, Franklin was challenged to a duel&#151;which never took place. In 1768 he attended the Fort Stanwix conference, where the representatives of the Six Nations named him Sagorighweyoghsta: &#145;dispenser or arbiter of justice&#146;. From 1772 onwards his relations with the New Jersey assembly deteriorated, and he began lobbying for the governorship of Barbados. However, with Lord Dartmouth's appointment as head of the Board of Trade, London became far less critical of him: he had, said Dartmouth, &#145;kept his Province in good Order, during Times of Difficulty&#146;  (<span class="italic">Papers</span>, 19.360). He owed much of his advancement to the influence of his father, who in 1771 had addressed his <span class="italic">Autobiography</span> to Franklin. Yet by 1774 Franklin was steering a course that placed an unbridgeable gulf between them. His fervent support of parliament's policy towards Massachusetts in the wake of the Boston Tea Party caused his father to call him &#145;a thorough Courtier&#146; who saw &#145;every thing with Government Eyes&#146;  (<span class="italic">Papers</span>, 21.287).<br>
<br>When the Continental Congress met in Philadelphia in September 1774, Franklin began sending highly secret intelligence to Lord Dartmouth. Remaining steadfastly at his post while other governors fled, he became the <i>b&ecirc;te noire</i> of American radical leaders. He was a &#145;madman&#146;, who might well be tarred and feathered  (Reed MSS, 4.1). When in January 1776 he prepared a further confidential report, it was intercepted and his house was broken into. By June he was arrested as an &#145;enemy to the liberties of this country&#146;  (<span class="italic">Minutes of the Provincial Congress</span>, 456). &#145;New Jersey have dethroned Franklyn&#146;, reported one gleeful member of the Continental Congress  (Smith, 4.210). To his tormentors he firmly restated his loyalty to the king: &#145;<i>Pro Rege et Patria</i> was the Motto I assumed when I first commenced my Political Life, and I am resolved to retain it till Death&#146;  (Revolutionary Era MSS). He was held captive in Connecticut for over two years, on one occasion beaten, on another nearly hit by musket shot. When his wife, now in British-controlled New York city, became seriously ill, he was refused permission to visit her, and she died &#145;broken hearted&#146; in July 1777  (<span class="italic">Papers</span>, 25.553).<br>
<br>Late in 1778 Franklin was freed. In New York, where he was awarded an annuity from the British Treasury, he was the acknowledged leader of the American loyalists, for whom he struggled to secure aid. He also built up an unofficial yet active spy network. Deeply embittered and seeking revenge, he was appointed in 1780 president of the Board of Associated Loyalists, which organized bands to plunder rebel areas. This created havoc in official British relations with the rebels and was disbanded, and a discredited Franklin departed for London in August 1782.<br>
<br>In England, Franklin sought to ensure that the peace settlement provided recompense for loyalist losses in America. His father, however, was a chief negotiator of the treaty, and his hatred of loyalists in general, and the leading role played by his son in particular, was unyielding. Parliament in 1788 granted Franklin but a fraction of his claims. Mortified, he made unavailing attempts to recoup moneys he had earlier sunk into western land schemes and faded from the political scene.<br>
<br>On 14 August 1788 Franklin married his Irish-born London landlady, Mary D'Evelyn (<i>c</i>.1753&#150;1811). Two years after she died, on 3 September 1811, Franklin, suffering from angina pectoris and influenza, died, aged eighty-two, at his home, 28A Norton Street, Marylebone, on 16 November 1813. He was buried in the churchyard of St Pancras Old Church on 25 November. Effectively disinherited by his father, with whom he had never been reconciled, his bequests totalled about &pound;600.<br>
