<span class="headword">Kennett,  Brackley</span>  (<em>c.</em>1713&#150;1782), <span class="occ">wine merchant and local politician</span>, was born in Putney, Surrey, the son of John &#145;Kinnick&#146;, a waterman in Putney. Little is known about his business career, but it is likely that he began working on the rougher side of the tavern trade. He emerged as a wine merchant in Pall Mall; respectability and civic office came by way of his membership of the Vintners' Company, of which he was master in 1768. He was sheriff of the City of London in 1765&#150;6, and was elected alderman of Cornhill ward in 1767. He was elected lord mayor in 1779, and was thus in office during the Gordon riots of 1780, when a campaign by Lord George Gordon for the repeal of the <span class="roman">Catholic Relief Act</span> of 1778 led to a week of mob rule.<br>
<br>The lord mayor's ineffectiveness was unfavourably portrayed by Charles Dickens in <span class="italic">Barnaby Rudge</span> (1841). The evidence is partial, but it seems that Kennett was timid to the point of indifference. When he was asked on 3 June to protect the Catholics in Moorfields, he is said to have replied: &#145;You do not know anything of the business. I have orders to employ the military if necessary, but I must be cautious what I do lest I bring the mob to my house. I can assure you that there are very great people at the bottom of the riot&#146;  (Castro, 51). Next day, when the mob was destroying the Catholic chapel in Moorfields, he apparently turned a deaf ear to requests for orders from the soldiers and the fire officers in attendance; and when the rioters' work was done he uttered the mildest of rebukes: &#145;That's pretty well, gentlemen, for one day; I hope you will now go to your own homes&#146;  (ibid., 52). On 5 June he is said to have ignored a request from a Catholic merchant for protection for his family in the Mansion House; and he stirred himself only when the Bank of England was reported to be in the mob's sights.<br>
<br>Kennett was charged with criminal neglect of duty, and his case was tried before Lord Mansfield in March 1781. After a little hesitation on the part of the jury, he was found guilty. Another charge, relating to the release of some rioters apprehended during an attack on a prison, was dropped. Kennett died on 12 May 1782 with his sentence for neglect of duty, and a suit for defamation brought by Thomas Howard, third earl of Effingham (whom Kennett had alleged to have been one of the rioters), still outstanding. The possibility of suicide cannot be ruled out. His first marriage was to Frances Boure. He was survived by his second wife, Hannah, and two sons. Two girls took his surname, but were either illegitimate or adopted. He was buried in Putney church.<br>
