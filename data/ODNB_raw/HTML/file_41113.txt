<span class="headword">Hornor,  Thomas</span>  (1785&#150;1844), <span class="occ">surveyor and panoramist</span>, was born on 12 June 1785 at Lowgate, Hull, where his family were Quaker grocers. He was taught surveying and engineering by his brother-in-law William Johnson. In the early 1800s he was in Manchester, surveying the property of the free grammar school, but by 1807 he was in London, living first in Kentish Town and later that year in Chancery Lane. That same year he was appointed by the vestry of St James's, Clerkenwell, to draw a large-scale plan of the parish. On 19 October 1808, well ahead of his deadline, he presented them with a huge plan measuring 81 in. by 72 in., which shows him to have been a skilled and assiduous surveyor and cartographer. The vestry was well satisfied, and Hornor particularly impressed William Cook, a local improving landowner. Under Cook's patronage Hornor set up in business at 3 Church Court, Inner Temple, from where he undertook the survey and valuation of landed properties, the division of commons, and the levelling for canals and drains. In 1813 he published a version of his Clerkenwell map, which, though decorative, remained informative and accurate. He advertised himself as a promoter of picturesque landscape gardening, having devised a new method of drawing estate plans which he called &#145;panoramic chorometry&#146;. He elaborated on this technique, which he claimed reunited the arts of surveying and landscape painting, in his <span class="italic">Description of an Improved Method of Delineating Estates</span> (1813).<br>
<br>By 1814 Hornor was in Wales, advertising for business as a &#145;Pictural Delineator of Estates&#146;. He produced some 300 to 400 watercolours, hinged cut-out books after the manner of Humphry Repton's red books, panoramas of estates, and at least four huge maps, all of which attest to his skills as surveyor, artist, and entrepreneur. He mixed with his clients as equals and grew very wealthy.<br>
<br>Having returned to London in 1820, Hornor lived in 2 Robert Street, Adelphi, and after 1825 at 10 Royal (or Adelphi) Terrace. Having been an irregular worshipper in Manchester, he stopped attending meeting altogether in London, and in 1822 the Society of Friends disowned him. His artistic ambitions grew with his social status and he began his most spectacular project, that of a 360 degree panorama of London with the summit of St Paul's as the viewpoint. In a cabin precariously balanced on scaffolding erected in connection with repairs to the cathedral, he sketched and measured. Although he attracted considerable publicity for his enterprise and admiration for his courage, few subscribed to his initial scheme of publishing the work as a series of prints. However, the MP and banker Rowland Stephenson sponsored the construction in Regent's Park of a dome by Decimus Burton, second in size in England only to that of St Paul's, in which Hornor's work was to be displayed. In it in 1825 the artist E. T. Parris began the daunting task of transferring views from flat sheets to 42,000 square feet of curved canvas. It was due for completion in 1827 but was far from finished by the end of 1828 when Stephenson absconded to the USA, deeply in debt. In January 1829 Hornor threw open the unfinished Colosseum to the public, who could enjoy the panorama at various levels, riding upwards in the &#145;ascending room&#146;, the first passenger lift in England and Hornor's own design. Income was large, but costs were larger yet, and later that year Hornor also absconded to the USA. There he did some second-rate work before dying in penury (and possibly insane) in New York city on 14 March 1844. He was interred at the Friends' burial-ground there.<br>
<br>The Colosseum was finished in 1831 and visitors could take delight in Hornor's pleasure gardens as well as his panorama: but, after a series of proprietors had failed to make it pay, the building and its contents were auctioned in 1868. There were no bidders for Hornor's panorama and it remained in place until 1874, when it was brought up to date and shipped to America for display on Broadway.<br>
<br>Hornor fell into obscurity, not least as many of his finest works remained in private hands in Wales. He was recognized as a considerable artist in the later twentieth century, when his Welsh watercolours and prints came to light, but, despite his claims to have reunited the plan and the prospect, he had no followers. He remains more a curiosity than a pioneer, and his works &#145;a supreme example of misdirected genius&#146;  (Hyde, &#145;Hornor&#146;, 32).<br>
