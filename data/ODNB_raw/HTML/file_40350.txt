<span class="headword">Muirhead,  Roland Eugene</span>  (1868&#150;1964), <span class="occ">Scottish nationalist and businessman</span>, was born on 24 July 1868 at Lochwinnoch, Renfrewshire, Scotland, the second son of Andrew Muirhead (<i>d</i>. 1885), the owner of the Gryffe tannery, and his wife, Isabella Reid. He was educated in Glasgow high school and at the age of fifteen he started a four-year apprenticeship at his father's tannery. When he was nineteen he emigrated to South America and worked as a cattlehand, and eventually moved north to the United States to live in an Owenite colony in Washington state. He subsequently claimed that this experience had shaped his belief in socialism.<br>
<br>Muirhead returned to the United Kingdom in 1891 and after a short period of running a co-operative tannery in London moved north to take over the family business. He was drawn into radical politics both by his own personal experiences and by family influence. His elder sister, Alice Margaret, was an advocate of women's suffrage, and his elder brother, Robert Franklin, was a member of the Socialist Land and Labour League. Through Robert, Roland came into contact with a number of eminent socialists, such as Andreas Schau, R. B. Cunninghame Graham, and Keir Hardie. In 1897 he reorganized the family business to give the workers a share in ownership. His business practice paid dividends and the tannery was successful, which allowed him to channel funds into a wide variety of political and cultural causes.<br>
<br>In 1901 Muirhead joined the Young Scots' Society (YSS), a radical Liberal organization which had been formed in response to the wave of jingoism which had swept the country following the South African War and the crushing defeat of the Liberal Party at the general election of 1900. Although the YSS had formal ties to the Liberal Party, Muirhead worked hard to turn it into a coalition of progressive political movements in Scotland and consistently argued that the society should back candidates at elections who were the most &#145;progressive&#146;, irrespective of party. In 1906 he provided funding for the socialist weekly, <span class="italic">The Forward</span>, edited by Thomas Johnston. He also initiated a number of debates between the Fabian Society, the Independent Labour Party, and progressive Liberals in an endeavour to achieve common ground for the progressive cause in Scotland. A wide range of radical campaigns such as railway nationalization, women's suffrage, the Peace Society, and land nationalization received his support. In spite of his endeavours the YSS remained firmly attached to the Liberal camp, and his dissatisfaction with it grew after 1910, when the society failed to back Labour candidates at by-elections.<br>
<br>Muirhead's commitment to radical interventionist policies shaped his support for Scottish home rule. He believed that a Scottish parliament would implement more advanced policies of social reform than could be achieved by Westminster. From 1910 until the outbreak of the First World War he advocated the creation of a Scottish parliament as the top priority for Scottish radicals, as this would be the best way to deliver advanced social and economic policies. At this point in his political career he believed that his political objectives could best be achieved by putting pressure on the Liberal Party, and he questioned the need for a separate socialist party. He viewed nationalists, labourists, socialists, and radical Liberals as belonging to the &#145;progressive movement&#146; and believed that they could win the Scottish Liberal Party over to their way of thinking. This &#145;common cause&#146; approach to politics, in which issues and ideals were more important than party, would remain one of his key beliefs.<br>
<br>The onset of war, however, initiated a break with the YSS as the society supported the government, which contradicted Muirhead's pacifist principles. In 1918 he joined the ILP, serving as secretary of the Lochwinnoch branch, and set about re-creating the Scottish Home Rule Association (SHRA), of which he became national secretary. He hoped that the SHRA would be able to emulate some of the qualities that he had tried to instil into the YSS. He wanted to make the organization cross-party in order to maximize support for home rule and retained the pre-war radical faith that ideas of principle could transcend party loyalties. However, such faith was misplaced. He failed to stop the Scottish Trades Union Congress and the Labour Party taking over the association through its use of affiliated membership. When the private member's bill on Scottish home rule, introduced by the Labour MP George Buchanan, failed in 1924 through a lack of parliamentary time, Muirhead and other nationalists within the SHRA wanted to pursue a more vigorous policy&#151;only to find their endeavours blocked by Labour loyalists within the association.<br>
<br>From 1924 to 1928, when increasing calls were made for the formation of an independent nationalist party, Muirhead began to find common cause with other nationalist organizations. In early 1928 he announced that he would stand as an independent home rule candidate, hoping that Labour would turn a blind eye to this. When they did not he called on all like-minded individuals within the SHRA to follow his lead into the National Party of Scotland, which was formed in April 1928, and of which he was the first chairman. He believed that if the party could make a good showing at the polls it would sting the Labour Party into taking the issue of home rule seriously. The National Party, however, failed to make its breakthrough; Muirhead himself was unsuccessful on the three occasions (1929, 1931, and 1935) when he stood as a nationalist parliamentary candidate for Western Renfrewshire. Lack of electoral success led to serious infighting which saw the party take on a more moderate hue, which was not to Muirhead's liking. This dissatisfaction grew with the formation of the Scottish National Party (SNP) in 1934, which was an amalgam of the NPS and the right-wing Scottish Party. Muirhead was elected honorary president of the SNP in 1936, but played little part in policy formulation. He disliked the party's rightward shift, and its &#145;moderation of principles&#146; led him to fund the publication of the <span class="italic">Scots Independent</span>, which provided a forum for radical and anti-leadership views. He also endorsed the anti-conscription campaign run by a number of activists following the start of the Second World War. Muirhead lent his support to the radical wing of the SNP, which eventually triumphed in 1942 and ousted the moderates led by John MacCormick, who went on to found the Scottish National Convention, a cross-party organization designed to promote Scottish home rule.<br>
<br>Frustrated with the lack of direction in the nationalist movement during the post-war era, Muirhead founded his own Scottish National Congress in 1950. He continued to provide funding for nationalist pamphlets and literature through the Scottish Secretariat, which he formed in 1926. On 31 October 1945 he married his housekeeper, Flora Ferrier. A tall and austere figure with sharp features, Muirhead retained the common personality characteristics of the early Scottish socialist movement and was rather dour and serious. He died at Lochwinnoch, Renfrewshire, on 2 August 1964; he was buried there and was survived by his wife.<br>
