<span class="headword">Horne,  (Charles) Silvester</span>  (1865&#150;1914), <span class="occ">Congregational minister and politician</span>, was born in Cuckfield, Sussex, on 15 April 1865, the youngest of three sons and four children of Charles Horne (1829&#150;1903), Congregational minister and later editor of the <span class="italic">Newport Advertiser</span>, and his wife, Harriet Simpson, daughter of the superintendent of government tobacco warehouses in Liverpool. Educated at Newport grammar school, Horne joined Newport's Congregational church, and, with the ministry in mind, went to Glasgow University (MA, 1886) and then Mansfield College, Oxford, where he took the three-year college course in theology. In 1887 he was invited to Kensington chapel, where he was ordained on 17 October 1889: determined that Horne should be its minister, Kensington waited eighteen months for him to complete his course. In August 1892 he married Katharine Maria (1870&#150;1958), elder daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32605/', "Sir Herbert Hardy (later first Baron) Cozens-Hardy")</script> MP, later master of the rolls. They had three sons and four daughters.<br>
<br>Horne arrived at Kensington the freshest star in the nonconformist firmament; he left heir presumptive to Hugh Price Hughes and John Clifford. He galvanized his congregation, as admired for his campaigns to students or country towns as for his commemorative services. He wrote a novel, <span class="italic">A Modern Heretic</span> (1893), as well as <span class="italic">A Manual of Church Fellowship</span> (1893) and popular histories of the London Missionary Society (1895) and the free churches (1903). Thus he became known, and he declined repeated calls to important churches before accepting the challenge of the debt-burdened Whitefield's Tabernacle in Tottenham Court Road, London.<br>
<br>Horne moved there in September 1903 to promote a mission modelled on Wesleyan central halls. The Whitefield's combination of Congregationalism and club-cum-business house for Christ, captured in its banner (a knight ascending to shining towers burdened by a broken comrade) and its motto &#145;No quest, no conquest&#146;, appeared to be effortless.<br>
<br>In 1910, at the height of the New Theology controversy, Horne became chairman of the Congregational Union of England and Wales, his friendship with the chief protagonists preventing undue bloodletting. He was now a national figure, a passive resister, pro-Boer, and a rumbustious electioneer, fighting as a Progressive in London and being urged to fight in Birmingham. In December 1909 invitations to become their MP came from both Merthyr and Ipswich. Encouraged by friends who saw him as a nonconformist Lord Hugh Cecil (later Baron Quickswood), Horne stood for Ipswich.<br>
<br>Horne sat from January 1910, the first nonconformist MP in pastoral charge since Praisegod Barebones. He gained no instant parliamentary fame, although he was a useful back-bencher; and there is some evidence that his arguments were instrumental in moving the mind of Asquith (a distant connection of Katharine Horne) towards the granting of universal suffrage. His maiden speech was on the Congo and his last was on home rule for Ireland. In between he delivered speeches on peace, colonial exploitation, and Welsh disestablishment.<br>
<br>Horne, whose passion was golf, seemed forever off in a taxi to address a meeting somewhere. He attracted children and men, but women were less at ease with him. He was a poor but amusing correspondent. Oddly for so fluent a man he wrote his sermons in advance of delivery, and he also prayed with his eyes open, which added to the impact of his public prayer. In London he lived at Campden Hill Gardens and later at Ampthill Square. He built The Bluff at Sheringham and the White House at Church Stretton, whose architect, P. R. Morley Horder, collaborated with him in plans and designs for <span class="italic">The Institutional Church</span> (1906). His youngest son was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37568/', "(Charles) Kenneth Horne (1907&#150;1969)")</script>, a notable radio comedian.<br>
<br>By 1914 Horne was faltering, for his effortlessness was illusory. The voice which had charmed his early hearers grew hoarse. The techniques of the pulpit were too dominant for Westminster, and those of the platform worried Whitefield's. Their doubts shook him. He resigned from Whitefield's and intended to resign from parliament, and went to lecture at Yale University on &#145;The romance of preaching&#146;. After Yale he travelled to Canada. He died on 2 May 1914 while standing on deck as his steamer entered Toronto harbour. His body was returned to Church Stretton for burial, where he was also commemorated by a village institute designed by Morley Horder.<br>
