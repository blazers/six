<span class="headword">Yeldham,  Florence Annie</span>  (1877&#150;1945), <span class="occ">schoolteacher and historian of arithmetic</span>, was born at School House, Brightling, Battle, Sussex, on 30 October 1877, the second daughter and second of at least seven children of Thomas Yeldham (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1853) of Bromley, Kent, a schoolteacher who later became a school inspector, and his wife, Elizabeth Ann Chesterfield (<i>b</i>. 1854) of Leicestershire. With the family's move to London, Yeldham and three sisters had the opportunity to attend a school run by a charitable foundation, James Allen's Girls' School, Dulwich; the school awarded her an exhibition to Bedford College, University of London, where she matriculated in 1895. Meanwhile two of her brothers attended Alleyn's School, part of the same foundation, but none of the rest of her family had an extended education: one sister left school at the age of sixteen, and the other siblings even earlier. Yeldham graduated with a BSc (division two) in 1900, having chosen papers in pure mathematics, experimental physics, and zoology. She is listed as having gained honours, which one would have expected, but no details can be found.<br>
<br>Yeldham was appointed to her first post as a teacher by the London county council at Peckham county secondary school, London, in 1901. While there in 1913 she produced her first printed work: <span class="italic">Percentage Tables</span> (Pitman). The British Library copy comprises just one sheet (double folio size) containing the table itself, with instructions for how it should be used&#151;not what it was for. It is clearly a very specialized type of ready reckoner, and probably provided a practical solution to some problem which had cropped up in the classroom, but its purpose today is no longer obvious.<br>
<br>Yeldham moved in April 1914 to the girls' county secondary school in Streatham, London, and remained there for some years, though her teaching career after 1918 is undocumented. In 1922, however, she provided evidence of the progressive educational outlook of that school, describing how it had recently introduced the Dalton plan (a scheme of work giving pupils more responsibility for their own learning, which later became quite widely adopted): she wrote an article in the <span class="italic">Mathematical Gazette</span> (reprinted in a centenary edition of 1971) describing, with some enthusiasm, its impact on her teaching in both pure and applied mathematics and physics. Everything indicates that she was a dedicated teacher.<br>
<br>It can be inferred from her 1922 article that Yeldham was an early advocate of the history of mathematics as a stimulus in teaching mathematics. Despite her somewhat unremarkable classroom career, she possessed a most unusual characteristic: having deplored the lack of suitable books for her pupils (and their teachers)&#151;as background reading or for the library&#151;she acted positively to become an expert in order to write them herself. In 1923, at the age of forty-five, she enrolled as a PhD student of Dr Charles Singer in the history of science department of University College, London, becoming one of its earliest formal students. Her first book, <span class="italic">The Story of Reckoning in the Middle Ages</span> (1926), was submitted as part of her dissertation&#151;which dealt with arithmetical methods up to the thirteenth century&#151;as were four other (unpublished) papers, dealing with minor topics that had evidently intrigued her. In that book she describes Singer as &#145;my friend and tutor&#146;.<br>
<br>Yeldham's second book, which appeared in 1936, was <span class="italic">The Teaching of Arithmetic through Four Hundred Years (1535&#150;1935)</span>. In the early twenty-first century both books were still well regarded and quite frequently cited, since she included material that was not readily available, while her critical comments, particularly on the later period, give a good sense of the unsuspected difficulties that slowed the development of arithmetic. Her treatment of the subject is generally episodic, being more factual than interpretative, but the books must certainly have met the needs of her intended readership.<br>
<br>In retirement Yeldham lived in Banstead, Surrey. Her last years must have been passed in some discomfort owing to chronic arthritis, probably compounded by the deprivations of wartime. She spent at least the final six months of her life in the Metropolitan Convalescent Home, Walton-on-Thames, Surrey, and died there on 10 January 1945.<br>
