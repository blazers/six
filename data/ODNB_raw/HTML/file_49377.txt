<span class="headword">Margaret</span>, countess of Kent  (1187<span class="mult">x</span>95&#150;1259), <span class="occ">princess</span>, was the eldest daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29452/', "William the Lion, king of Scots (d. 1214)")</script>, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/49356/', "Ermengarde de Beaumont (d. 1233)")</script>. She was born at an unknown date between early 1187 and April or May 1195, when her father's illness caused a succession crisis in Scotland. She was perhaps recognized then as his heir; by another account it was proposed by the English court that she should marry Richard I's nephew Otto, duke of Saxony (<i>d</i>. 1218), but the Scottish magnates objected because the king's younger brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/49365/', "David, earl of Huntingdon (d. 1219)")</script>, was a suitable heir. But the king recovered, and Margaret's expectations changed again in 1198 when her brother, the future <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/322/', "King Alexander II")</script>, was born. Nothing more is known about her until August 1209 when, as a consequence of the treaty of Norham, she was sent south as a possible bride for the future King Henry III of England. But nothing came of these proposals, and clause 59 of <span class="roman">Magna Carta</span> suggests that there had subsequently been pressure for her being returned to Scotland. But this, too, had no effect, and on 3 October 1221 she was married at London to <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/3991/', "Hubert de Burgh (c.1170&#150;1243)")</script>, justiciar of England. Henry III gave her away, but the match was a disparagement; de Burgh was of gentry stock and was not ennobled, as earl of Kent, until February 1227. Their only child, Megotta (Margaret), was probably born in the early 1220s. In 1232 de Burgh was reported to be planning to divorce Margaret, but in the same year he fell from royal favour, was stripped of his offices, and was imprisoned; Margaret, deprived of personal treasures and possessions, took sanctuary at Bury St Edmunds until her husband and the king were partly reconciled in 1234, when Henry III made grants for her maintenance. At Bury, Margaret organized the secret marriage of Megotta to Richard de Clare (<i>d</i>. 1262), a boy of about the same age and heir to the wealthy honours of Clare and Gloucester. De Burgh may not have known of this; its discovery in 1236 reopened the breach with the king, and Megotta's death in 1237 made no difference; de Burgh was completely out of public life by 1239 and died in 1243. Margaret succeeded to lands in which they had been jointly seised and held them until her death in the autumn (before 25 November) of 1259; like her husband, she was buried at Blackfriars in London.<br>
