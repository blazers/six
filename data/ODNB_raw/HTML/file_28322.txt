<span class="headword">Vines,  Richard</span>  (1599/1600&#150;1656), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, was born at Blaston, Leicestershire; his parents' names are unknown. In 1619 he matriculated sizar from Magdalene College, Cambridge, where he was an excellent Greek scholar, and he graduated BA in 1623 and proceeded MA in 1627. He was ordained deacon and priest at Peterborough on 23 and 24 May 1624. That year he became schoolmaster at Hinckley, Leicestershire, and married Katherine (<i>d</i>. in or after 1656), daughter of Humphrey Adderley of Weddington, Warwickshire, and granddaughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/56705/', "Humphrey Adderley (1512&#150;1598)")</script>. He was schoolmaster until 11 March 1628 when he was presented by his father-in-law to the rectory of Weddington, and on 10 June 1630 to the neighbouring rectory of Caldecote. When Thomas Jacombe preached Vines's funeral sermon twenty-six years later he had this comment on his schoolmastering phase: &#145;let this be no disparagement&#146; [how else could it have been taken?], he could instance but &#145;rare instruments of Gods glory in the Church of Christ, who began with that employment&#146;  (Jacombe, 39). In that funeral sermon Jacombe alluded to two common criticisms that were levelled at Vines: that he was restless and covetous. Since he held both his livings, worth together &pound;80 a year, while the parish register at Hinckley shows that he was still living there in 1640 and, in addition, conducted a well-attended fortnightly lecture at Nuneaton, these early career moves may have been the foundation of the later criticisms. However, at the time Vines was well regarded among the godly of Warwickshire and was, for instance, a close friend of the theologian George Abbot, stepson of the militant puritan William Purefoy of Caldecote.<br>
<br>When the civil war broke out Vines left Hinckley and was presented as one of the &#145;orthodox divines&#146; to be consulted by parliament &#145;touching the reformation of church government and liturgie&#146;. Another sign of his rising status was the frequency of invitations from the Long Parliament for him to preach to them. They liked his message: a warning against liberalism to popery which could be a &#145;Trojan horse&#146;  (<span class="italic">Calebs Integrity</span>, 1646, preached on 30 Nov 1642); a readiness (like Luther) to take on the sects even if they could be mobilized as allies against the Catholics  (<span class="italic">The Impostures of Seducing Teachers</span>, 1656, preached on 23 April 1644); a dismay at religion's being debased into &#145;a kind of Philosophy of Opinions&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Posture of Davids Spirit</span>, 1656, preached on 22 Oct 1644); and a plea to Independent ministers to break with the sects  (<span class="italic">The Authour, Nature, and Danger of Heresie</span>, 1662, preached on 10 March 1646). They may also have liked the way that the message was delivered. The fast sermons are, in general, by their nature ephemeral, but some of Vines's phrases were made to last. In the latter sermon, for instance, he has this striking observation: &#145;to make conscience the final judge of actions, is to wipe out the hand-writing of the Word of God&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Authour, Nature, and Danger of Heresie</span>, 45). There is also a certain equivocation, of having it both ways. Thus in the same sermon he does not condemn Calvin for the execution of Servetus, but quotes approvingly Calvin's comment that Servetus &#145;might have saved his life had he been but modest&#146;. Still, it would have been better to have fought heresy by light, not fire&#151;leave the fire to the papists. Papists can join Jews, Turks, and other heretics by being given the right to live in the kingdom, but it is another matter to allow them liberty to trade, and open up shops, for the purpose of disseminating their &#145;destructive&#146; ideas  (ibid., 48, 50).<br>
<br>From 1643, having been ejected from his livings, Vines joined other puritan exiles (including Cornelius Burges and Richard Baxter) in Coventry, and established a daily lecture there at St Michael's. He was nominated a member of the Westminster assembly of divines by the ordinance of 12 June 1643, was sent up to London, and was placed in the rectory of St Clement Danes; it was later alleged that he preached there only when the assembly was in session. One of his parishioners was the earl of Essex. Vines's funeral oration for him on 22 October 1646 was later published as <span class="italic">The Hearse of the Renowned</span>. His respect for the godly magistrate comes out in his tribute to Essex: &#145;he was a Justice that would scatter the drunkards from the Ale-bench&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Hearse of the Renowned</span>, 15). Death for Vines was not the great leveller. True, we rot equally in the grave, and yet &#145;honour will follow after worth and merit even into its grave&#146;. Again the gift for the striking phrase comes out in his claim that &#145;we do not buy up the carkasse of every Cole-ship with that respect as that of Drakes was&#146;  (ibid., 16). This is more than a conventional defence of hierarchy; it is also a defence of the funeral sermon. Like other English puritans he championed the funeral sermon as a genre for education; the Scottish presbyterians shunned it because they knew that it elevated personal merit above the insight that all of us rot in the grave equally&#151;and deserve to do so.<br>
<br>Vines's contributions to debate in the Westminster assembly are well brought out in the minutes. Vines defended on 13 September 1643 the right of a colleague (Cornelius Burges) to sit in the assembly, even though he had opposed the solemn league and covenant. A day later he expressed his worries about an over-rigid Calvinism, which might fall short of full-scale antinomianism but which could be equally dangerous. Although he made common cause with a like-minded ecumenical spirit in the Independent minister Philip Nye, he nevertheless reminded him that agreement had to be rooted &#145;in things that are well not only in terms and notions&#146;. But the role of his Scottish presbyterian colleagues was equally firmly circumscribed: &#145;counsellors&#146;, not &#145;dictators&#146;  (&#145;Minutes of the Westminster assembly&#146;, 1, 1.238<i>v</i>). Like his Erastian colleague John Selden he was sceptical of divine-right claims from any quarter&#151;episcopalian or presbyterian. The claims made for the Hebrew Sanhedrin were a &#145;fiction&#146;, he said on 13 December 1643  (ibid., 1, 2.268<i>v</i>). Vines's own position in that assembly came under scrutiny on 8 July 1644. He had been sought for the mastership of Pembroke College, Cambridge. The debate focused on whether he should be forced to leave Coventry by a parliamentary ordinance, even though he was reluctant to take up the Cambridge job. The presbyterian minister Herbert Palmer, commented: &#145;I have not heard any piece of newes that troubles me more than this&#146;  (ibid., 2.155<i>v</i>). In the event Vines showed administrative flair in his mastership of Pembroke College and his reputation in the assembly itself continued to rise.<br>
<br>It was a mark of colleagues' esteem that Vines was placed on the parliamentary &#145;committee of accommodation&#146; on 13 September 1644, and was chosen as chairman a week later of the acting subcommittee. Although himself episcopally ordained, he defended the validity of ordination by presbyterians while simultaneously deflating the excessive claims for &#145;a classical presbytery&#146; from the Scots  (&#145;Minutes of the Westminster assembly&#146;, 2.43). He was one of the assisting divines at the Uxbridge conference (30 January&#150;18 February 1645). He resigned St Clement Danes on being presented to the rectory of Walton, Hertfordshire, on 22 May 1645. He was placed on the assembly's committee (12 May 1645) for drafting the confession of faith produced in 1647. He recalled that time in a letter years later to Richard Baxter, arguing justly that his compromise proposals then had avoided the overemphasis on works which was to bring so much criticism on Baxter's head. That criticism had focused on Baxter's first published work, <span class="italic">The Aphorismes of Justification</span> (1649), which he had (perhaps brashly) dedicated to Vines and Anthony Burgess. Burgess was so incensed by it that he wrote against it. Baxter claimed, in contrast, that &#145;Mr Vines wrote to me applaudingly of it&#146;  (<span class="italic">Reliquiae Baxterianae</span>, 1.107). The actual letter is more opaque than that would indicate. Vines repeats a list of current criticisms that Baxter had gone soft on Arminianism under the cover of the honest reporter, using the phrase &#145;This is said&#146;. He even said that it draws &#145;too near Socinianisme&#146; in places  (Keeble and Nuttall, 1.58).<br>
<br>Nevertheless, Vines and Baxter were puritans who could work with &#145;moderate&#146; episcopalians (that is, those who did not subscribe to Laudian <i>jure divino</i> claims for the office). Baxter, Vines, and Cornelius Burges were among a group of ministers and parliamentarians who had met twice a week in the early 1640s and who were &#145;not one for total abolishing of all, or any, but usurped Episcopacy&#146;  (Keeble and Nuttall, 1.409). Vines had sympathized with Burges's scruples about taking the covenant. Vines had his own scruples about the selling of church lands. Vines told Baxter that this was sacrilege (of interest to Burges, who had purchased Wells deanery and part of the cathedral estates). He explained to Baxter on 21 July 1649 that was why &#145;I could not maintain the cause as on the parliamentary side&#146; with reference to the debate between the parliamentary commissioners and Charles I on this issue at Newport, Isle of Wight, in 1648. At those crucial last-ditch negotiations for monarchy Vines struck up a personal rapport with the king. It is significant that, on the morning of the king's execution, Vines was one of the puritan divines who proffered religious services to Charles.<br>
<br>It was logical then that Vines declined the engagement in 1649; in 1650 it cost him his mastership of Pembroke and the rectory of Walton. It was, perhaps, less logical that Baxter joined him on this issue. They debated the matter together by letter, and both thought that the Commonwealth was constitutionally improper. But there is a personal quality to Vines's support for monarchy which is lacking in Baxter's position. This is well brought out many years later. At the turn of the century Thomas Carte was trying to kill off the rumours&#151;and he blamed Baxter principally for purveying them&#151;that Charles I had been mixed up in a popish plot. He then played his master-card: &#145;you may remember the character which Mr. Vines after the Treaty in the Isle of Wight gave the King to Mr. Gilbert the Presbyterian of Coventry &hellip; Of all the Kings of Israel and Judah there was none like him&#146;  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Carte 223, fols. 276&#150;7).<br>
<br>These sentiments did not hold Vines back for long. In 1650 the parishioners of St Lawrence Jewry called him to be their minister, and he was invited to hold the living. The parishioners rebuilt the vicarage-house for him at a cost of &pound;500; a few years later his stipend was &pound;180 per annum. With his propensity to acquire offices, he was also chosen as one of the weekly lecturers at St Michael Cornhill. Baxter later recalled an occasion when he preached at St Lawrence Jewry to a church so packed that &#145;Mr. Vines himself was fain to get up into the Pulpit, and sit behind me, and I to stand between his legs&#146;  (<span class="italic">Reliquiae Baxterianae</span>, 1.111&#150;12).<br>
<br>Vines and Baxter had a common hero in Archbishop James Ussher, whose 1641 scheme for a &#145;reduced episcopacy&#146; was pressed in the 1650s by both men. When Baxter recommended to the tireless ecumenist John Durie the setting up of a committee of four each of &#145;Episcopalian&#146;, &#145;Presbyterian&#146;, &#145;Independent&#146;, and &#145;Erastian&#146; groups, he placed Vines in the presbyterian camp (Ussher in the episcopalian). Baxter (substituting for Ussher) and Vines were among the ministers assisting the committee of ten to advise Cromwell on articles 36&#150;38 of the &#145;Instrument of government&#146;. After Ussher's death Vines recommended Bishop Ralph Brownrig of Exeter to Baxter as his likely spiritual heir, but Brownrig was less flexible than Ussher and Baxter by then was himself moving to Cromwellian sympathies which would have shocked Vines.<br>
<br>But Vines himself had died by then, at the age of fifty-six; he was survived by his wife and buried at St Lawrence Jewry. As Jacombe in his funeral sermon put it pithily: on 4 February 1656 &#145;Vines died suddenly. He went well to bed, slept and died.&#146; Jacombe deplored a contemporary cheap shot: &#145;since extempore prayer, more extempore death&#146;  (Jacombe, 43). Baxter read his death differently. By dying so soon after administering the sacrament of the Lord's supper, Vines had joined that select band for whom mortality struck &#145;in the midst of some holy exercise&#146;  (Keeble and Nuttall, 1.204).<br>
<br>In another way Vines's was an appropriate end. The last work that he published was <span class="italic">A treatise of the institution, right administration and receiving of the sacrament of the Lords supper</span> (1656). He took on in debate the Erastian lawyer, William Prynne, who had argued that qualifications for admission to communion were over-rigorous. Vines disagreed: he argued that it was better that those who could should be elevated to the ordinance than that the ordinance should be lowered to them (free admission). Vines's treatise had been approved by Baxter. Yet Vines's line of defence was that discipline was necessary when the help of the civil magistrate was withdrawn. Thus the church under a heathen emperor (or no emperor at all), had no other way of &#145;self-preservation from scandals of members, but purging them out&#146;. The alternative way of preventing scandal&#151;a partnership between church and magistrate&#151;was what Baxter urged in his <span class="italic">Holy Commonwealth</span> of 1659. At the time of Vines's death such a hypothesis would have been unthinkable for either man and&#151;given Vines's feelings for monarch and monarchy&#151;would have gone on being unthinkable for Vines. But when Baxter consulted three divines before publishing his Confession in 1654, such was then their unity that (Baxter said) none of them wanted him to change a word of it. Baxter brought the three together (in execrable verse) in his final obituary tribute to Vines:<blockquote>
<div>If but three such in all our times<br>
</div>
<div>as USHER, GATAKER and VINES.<br>
</div> (<span class="italic">A Treatise of &hellip; the Lords Supper</span>, 1656, preface)</blockquote>
