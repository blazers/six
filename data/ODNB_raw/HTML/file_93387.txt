<span class="headword">Bishop,  Maurice Rupert</span>  (1944&#150;1983), <span class="occ">prime minister of Grenada</span>, was born on 29 May 1944 in Aruba, the son of Rupert Bishop (<i>d</i>. 1974) and his wife, Alimenta, both of whom had emigrated to work at the island's Standard Oil refinery. On their return to Grenada in 1951 Bishop's father established a successful import and real estate agency, which provided his family with a place in the prosperous &#145;brown&#146; middle class. The family's middle-class status was further enhanced by the fact that Bishop's mother was a direct descendant of Louis la Grenade, a substantial free coloured landholder who had supported the British during the 1795 rebellion that sought to return the colony to the French.<br>
<br>Bishop was educated at Wesley Hall primary school and the Roman Catholic school in St George's before attending Presentation Brothers' College, St George's, on a scholarship. Before leaving for England to study law in 1963 he had already demonstrated an interest in public affairs. Earlier that year he co-founded a forum for the discussion of contemporary issues, the Grenada Assembly of Youth after Truth, with another student, Bernard Coard.<br>
<br>During his six-year sojourn in London Bishop was radicalized by the cumulative effect of current political developments and ideas. He was influenced by the anti-colonial movement throughout the third world, especially the struggle for African independence, and Julius Nyerere's African socialism and the <i>ujamaa</i> village system in Tanzania. His views were also shaped by developments in the American civil rights movement, particularly black power ideas and the Caribbean variants in Jamaica and Trinidad. Bishop was, moreover, exposed to the Marxist writings of C. L. R. James and the ideology of the Cuban revolution. His politicization took practical form, and his awareness of the plight of the West Indian community in London prompted him to assist in establishing a legal aid clinic in Notting Hill Gate. In 1969 he was called to the bar by Gray's Inn and, after a brief spell in the British civil service, returned to Grenada in 1970. He took with him his wife, Angela Constance Jemina, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Redhead (<i>b</i>. 1944/5), a nurse whom he had married at the Roman Catholic church of Our Lady of Lourdes, Acton, on 26 November 1966, and with whom he had two children, John (<i>b</i>. 1968), and Nadia (<i>b</i>. 1971).<br>
<br>Once home Bishop started a law practice and became involved in political activities, first in support of the 1970 black power &#145;February revolution&#146; in Trinidad and eventually in opposition to Eric Gairy, Grenada's chief minister. Gairy had tightened his grip on political power and responded to challenges to his increasingly authoritarian rule with repression and intimidation, relying on the paramilitary &#145;Mongoose gang&#146; as agents of terror. In 1972 Bishop organized, with his childhood friend and law partner, Kenrick Radix, the Movement for the Assemblies of People, which was merged in the following year with JEWEL (Joint Endeavour for Welfare, Education and Liberation) to form the New Jewel Movement (NJM). The early appeal of this anti-Gairy organization is explained by the growth of an urban-based middle class (made possible by increased educational opportunities, the development of tourism, and an expanded civil service) open to the idea of change. JEWEL brought to the new political alliance the complementary strengths of an organization with a rural base.<br>
<br>In the years after 1973 the NJM emerged as Gairy's most effective opposition, broadening its following in the process. A key component of its political strategy was to organize a series of demonstrations around issues guaranteed to command public attention. These ranged from agitating for public access to a beach on a property owned by an absentee English landlord to opposing Grenadian independence, which the NJM and its supporters feared would remove any external check on Gairy's rule. The NJM attracted support and sympathy from the general populace when their anti-Gairy campaign met with renewed efforts to suppress dissent. In 1973, for example, Bishop and five of his NJM colleagues were detained and badly beaten, and in January 1974 his father was murdered by Gairy's police during an anti-independence demonstration. (Grenada nevertheless became independent the following month, February 1974.) As early as 1973 the NJM attracted cross-class support from a group of businessmen, professionals, and religious leaders who called for an island-wide strike to protest against the beatings and to demand an inquiry into police conduct. The protests and demonstrations organized by the NJM eventually involved a wide cross-section of Grenadian society.<br>
<br>During this period of political turmoil Bishop became widely recognized as the leader of the anti-Gairy opposition. The basis of his popularity was his courage in challenging Gairy, his charm, oratorical skills, and easy rapport with ordinary people. His middle-class origins also made him acceptable to businessmen who viewed Gairy as too erratic a supporter of their interests. There was, moreover, little in the NJM's manifesto to cause alarm to the business establishment. It directed attention to the colony's problems and offered a detailed programme for social, economic, and political reconstruction. Its most original proposal was for the replacement of the existing system of parliamentary government by a more direct democracy. By 1976 the NJM had established itself as a credible alternative to Gairyism. In that year's election it joined an anti-Gairy political alliance, the People's Alliance, and secured three of the fifteen seats in the legislature, with Bishop as the leader of the opposition.<br>
<br>On 13 March 1979 the NJM seized power while Gairy was in New York for a meeting of the United Nations. Bishop proclaimed a People's revolutionary government (PRG), suspended the constitution, replaced the army with the People's Revolutionary Army (PRA), and promised an early return to democratic elections. He declared himself prime minister and Bernard Coard (who had returned permanently to Grenada in 1976, having qualified as an economist) was appointed minister of finance. Between 1974 and 1976 the NJM had secretly adopted Marxism-Leninism but Grenadians assumed that it was a conventional, if radical, political party.<br>
<br>Although the NJM's seizure of state power was the work of a small group rather than a popular uprising Grenadians greeted the change in government with enthusiasm. The PRG was thus able to mobilize the people's support for national reconstruction. Gairy had left the economy and society in tatters and the PRG quickly turned its attention to reversing decades of neglect, with the participation of the private sector. Public investment in infrastructure development increased and health and education services were improved. The PRG provided free education and health care at all levels. The government constructed low-cost housing and offered grants for home improvement. It also made efforts to revitalize agriculture and to diversify the economy by promoting manufacturing. Its most ambitious project was the construction of an international airport (funded by Cuba), essential for tourism and for linking the island with external markets. The chronically high unemployment rate, estimated at 50 per cent in 1979, was reduced to 15 per cent by 1983. These successes were due mainly to a sharp increase in foreign aid and the PRG's careful financial management.<br>
<br>The PRG's domestic policy was marked by pragmatism, but its foreign policy represented a sharp break with the pro-American line of most Anglophone Caribbean nations. On 13 April 1979 Bishop adopted a position of anti-imperialism and non-alignment in a speech that challenged American hegemony in the region. The PRG established diplomatic relations with Cuba, increasingly aligned itself with the Soviet Union, and identified with militant third world politics in international organizations. This stance attracted aid from Cuba, North Korea, Libya, Iraq, and the Soviet Union, but earned American hostility, and relations between the two countries deteriorated. The USA viewed closer relations with Cuba and the Soviet bloc as evidence of increased communist influence and the airport's potential for military use as a threat to its national security.<br>
<br>By 1983 the euphoria of the revolution's early years had dissipated. There was popular resentment of the imprisonment of the PRG's political opponents without trial, the use of torture, the failure to hold elections, limitations on the activities of rival political parties, and the curtailment of press freedom&#151;all indications that the authoritarianism associated with Gairy had persisted. Falling attendance at political rallies and a reluctance to undertake voluntary work reflected the waning popular enthusiasm for the revolution. Nevertheless, despite the growing hostility to the PRG, Grenadians retained confidence in Bishop's leadership.<br>
<br>In 1983 Bishop's charismatic leadership was challenged by Coard, then deputy prime minister, and his allies on the NJM's governing central committee. Until that point there had been a tacit power-sharing agreement between them, with Coard operating as the tactician and ideologue and Bishop as the popular leader and the face of the revolution internationally. Coard's primary concern was that the balance of power had shifted in Bishop's favour. The proposal for joint leadership of the party advanced in October 1983 by Coard and his supporters on the central committee (from which most of Bishop's allies had been removed) was intended to pre-empt the consolidation of Bishop's rule as a personalist leader. Bishop's rejection of this proposal led to his house arrest on 13 October. On 19 October he was released by supporters who took him to Fort Rupert, St George's, where a confrontation with the PRA culminated in the execution of Bishop and trusted associates, among them his long-time mistress (also a minister in the PRG) Jacqueline Creft, who was pregnant with their second child (she and Bishop had already had a son, Vladimir). Bishop's body was subsequently burned, leaving no identifiable remains. He was survived by his mother, his wife, Angela, and their two children (who had emigrated to Canada in 1981), and his son Vladimir (1978&#150;1994). After Bishop's death Hudson Austin, leader of the PRA, established a military government, but this was overthrown six days later by an American-led invasion force.<br>
