<span class="headword">Villiers,  George Bussy</span>, fourth earl of Jersey  (1735&#150;1805), <span class="occ">courtier</span>, was born on 9 June 1735 and baptized on 6 July at St George's, Hanover Square, London, the second but only surviving son of William Villiers, third earl of Jersey (<i>d</i>. 1769), and Anne (<i>d</i>. 1762), daughter of Scrope Egerton, first duke of Bridgewater, and widow of Wriothesley Russell, third duke of Bedford. Styled Viscount Villiers from 1742, he was educated at home by his tutor, the future poet laureate William Whitehead, and then from 1754 to 1756 he and Lord Nuneham toured Germany, Switzerland, and Italy, Whitehead acting as tutor to both young men. In 1756 he succeeded his uncle Thomas Villiers as MP for Tamworth, a seat he retained until 1765. He then sat first as MP for Aldborough, Yorkshire (1765&#150;8), and later for Dover from 1768 until his elevation to the peerage on his father's death on 28 August 1769. A close friend of the duke of Grafton, he followed his political lead in both the Commons and Lords. He first held office as a lord of the Admiralty in the duke of Newcastle's ministry from 1761 but was dismissed in autumn 1762 for voting against Lord Bute's peace preliminaries. He returned to office as vice-chamberlain in Rockingham's ministry in 1765, and held a succession of court posts until 1800, apart from during the period 1777&#150;82 when he was in opposition. He was sworn of the privy council on 11 July 1765 and was elected a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries in 1787.<br>
<br>In the month that Villiers took his seat in the Lords as fourth earl of Jersey he married, on 26 March 1770, Frances (1753&#150;1821) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/63969/', "Villiers, Frances")</script>], daughter of Philip Twysden, bishop of Raphoe, and Frances Carter. They had at least ten children but his wife was notoriously unfaithful and had a string of affairs, the most significant of which was her liaison with the prince of Wales from 1793. It was undoubtedly through her influence that Jersey was appointed master of the horse to the prince of Wales in 1795 and after she had fallen out of favour in 1799, Jersey was dismissed from his post in January 1800. At court Jersey gained a reputation as a fop and was noted for his ostentatious etiquette that bordered on sycophancy; Elizabeth Montagu dubbed him &#145;the Prince of Maccaronies&#146;.<br>
<br>Jersey died suddenly, probably from a heart attack, on 22 August 1805 while walking with his eldest son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28296/', "George Villiers")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/40795/', "Villiers, Sarah Sophia Child-")</script>], near his son's house, Prospect Lodge, in Tunbridge Wells. He was buried at the family seat, Middleton Stoney, Oxfordshire, and was survived by his wife.<br>
