<span class="headword">Raynald <span class="st"> [Raynalde]</span>,  Thomas</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1539&#150;1552?), <span class="occ">printer</span>, was active from 1539. He used printing material that had previously belonged to the Southwark printer Peter Treveris. A deposition by three of his former servants on 20 August 1540, which noted that Raynald was recently resident at Hallywell near Finsbury, listed a number of books and engraved plates then in his possession, including an anatomical print &#145;graven in copper the one the man the other woman with their Intrayles thereto belonging&#146;  (Plomer, 21). <span class="italic">STC</span> suggests that his earliest printed work may have been an edition of Colet's <span class="italic">Accidence</span>, probably printed in 1539. In 1540 he published <span class="italic">The Byrth of Mankynde</span>, a translation of Eucharius Roesslin's midwifery manual and the first such text published in English; it was also the first work in England to include copper engravings.<br>
<br>The printer should be distinguished from his namesake, the <span class="occ">physician</span> <a name="cosubject_103408"></a><span class="headword">Thomas Raynalde <span class="st"> [Raynold]</span></span>  (<em>fl. </em>1545&#150;1551), whose name appears on the title page of the 1545 edition of <span class="italic">The Byrth of Mankynde</span> (which was also published by Raynald the printer) as having &#145;corrected and augmented&#146; the work. The systematic and extensive revisions, including corrections to the earlier edition's medical terminology, make it highly likely that the printer and the physician were different men. In the prologue to women readers Raynalde claimed that the book was being read out loud at confinements &#145;before the midwife and the rest of the women then being present&#146; and the listeners were pleased &#145;to hear the book read by some other, or else, such as could, to read it themselves&#146;  (Hobby, 21&#150;2). The work became the standard midwifery text, going through a total of thirteen editions before it was superseded in the 1650s. Raynalde also wrote <span class="italic">A Compendious Declaration of the Excellent Vertues of a Certain Lateli Inventid Oile</span>, which was published in Venice in 1551&#151;a further indication that the printer and physician were different men.<br>
<br>A namesake, and possibly a son of the printer, <a name="cosubject_23405"></a><span class="headword">Thomas Raynald</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1542&#150;1552)<span class="occ"></span>, was an apprentice of the London printer and member of the Drapers' Company, Thomas Petyt, between 1542 and his freedom as Thomas Reynolds in 1548. Distinguishing the works of the two printers is not straightforward, although it seems that the presumably younger man may have been responsible for a number of religious and theological publications between 1548 and 1552, including works by John Bale, Thomas Becon, Erasmus, John Mardeley, William Tyndale, and Zwingli as well as an edition of the Matthew <span class="roman">Bible</span> in 1549. If so, he was based first in the parish of St Andrew by the Wardrobe from 1548 to 1549, and at the sign of the Star in St Paul's Churchyard from 1549 to 1551. It is not clear which of the two printers published the 1552 edition of <span class="italic">The Byrth of Mankynde</span>. No further biographical details are known about any of these three men.<br>
