<span class="headword">Young,  Margaret Paulin</span>  (1864&#150;1953), <span class="occ">headmistress</span>, was born on 4 December 1864 in Lilliesleaf, Roxburghshire, where her father, the Revd William Langlands Young (<i>d</i>. 1907), had been United Presbyterian minister since 1857. Her mother was Margaret Brown Paulin. Her vivacious family circle included two sisters; J. M. Barrie was a cousin. In 1874 William Young was inducted as minister at Parkhead United Presbyterian Church and the family moved to Glasgow. In 1880 Margaret Young went to the Park School, Glasgow, enrolling on the second day of the new school. Remembered as a gay, lively schoolgirl, she was also one of the oldest pupils and soon became head girl. On finishing her schooling she went to London to attend the Training College for Teachers in Middle and Higher Schools for Girls (from 1885 the Maria Grey College), then the only institution in Britain providing such training.<br>
<br>In 1884 Margaret Young obtained her first teaching post, at the Oxford High School for Girls, where she taught classics for two years. In 1886 she returned to the Park School as an assistant mistress, teaching English, mathematics, and Latin. She was especially good at making dry subjects interesting, enlivening her lessons with amusing stories and racy comments. If she taught a double lesson she let the girls run round at half-time and even joined in playing &#145;prisoners' base&#146;.<br>
<br>Miss Young was also obvious headmistress material and was groomed for such a post by the Park headmistress Miss Georgina Kinnear. In 1897 the Glasgow Girls' School Trust opened a third school at Kilmacolm (later St Columba's School) and Margaret Young was appointed the first headmistress at a salary of &pound;200.<br>
<br>Three years later, having firmly established the new school at Kilmacolm, Miss Young was appointed headmistress at the Park School following the retirement of Miss Kinnear, a post she held until 1929. Her first task was to advise the school directors on modernizing the school facilities. During her headship pupil numbers continued to grow, specialized courses in science and art were established, and a domestic science department was added. Miss Young also actively supported the introduction of hockey at the Park School about 1901, attending all subsequent school matches, regardless of the weather. She approved the establishment of a school council, which resulted in the introduction of a school uniform, and she introduced the house system to the school. She encouraged the former pupils' club, the Park School Students' Association (PSSA), to undertake social projects and was herself active in the Glasgow section of the Girls' Guildry (a non-denominational organization linked to local churches), of which she was president for five years. During her last year as headmistress Miss Young initiated a London branch of the PSSA; after her retirement she remained an active member of the association and was for two years its president.<br>
<br>As one of the original pupils, assistant mistress for eleven years, and head for twenty-nine, Miss Young became so involved in the Park School that on her retirement she admitted finding it difficult to think of herself and the school as separate entities. The pupils presented her with a portrait by James Gunn as a leaving present and the board of directors established a fund of &pound;500 to be used for an annual prize for the school dux.<br>
<br>Miss Young's lively, outgoing personality was always combined with a sense of responsibility. As a young teacher she was tall and slim, with an encouraging smile, brown hair drawn rather severely back, and a &#145;delicious laugh&#146;, which bubbled up irrepressibly in the midst of the serious business of the hour. In later years she had a more motherly appeal and was remembered for her pungent wit, gracious courtesy, gaiety, and dignity. She was always beautifully dressed, with a habit of passing the long strings of beads she wore between her hands as she talked. Her leisure interests included needlework, motoring, and photography. Margaret Young died on 15 January 1953 at her home, 64 Hillhead Street, Hillhead, Glasgow, and was buried on 19 January at the Maryhill crematorium following a burial service at Claremont North, Church of Scotland.<br>
