<span class="headword">Sorell,  William</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1773, <em>d.</em> 1848), <span class="occ">army officer and administrator in Australia</span>, the son of Jane and Lieutenant-General William Alexander Sorell, was baptized at St Mary's Church, Marylebone, Middlesex, on 2 September 1773, by the rite of the Church of England, his lifelong formal allegiance. After attending Westminster School, he joined the army in 1790. In the ensuing decade he fought in the West Indies and Europe. He became a major in 1804 (later lieutenant-colonel) and trained under Sir John Moore. In 1807 he went to the Cape of Good Hope, where he excelled as deputy adjutant-general. Yet in 1811 he returned to Britain and the following year resigned from the army.<br>
<br>These moves resulted from strange personal circumstances. Between 1800 and 1807 Sorell had seven children with Harriet Coleman, an illiterate. The couple were married in 1807, but Harriet did not accompany her husband to the Cape. There Sorell entered into a liaison with the wife of a fellow officer, Louisa Matilda Kent, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Cox. From 1811 or 1812 the couple lived as man and wife, and by 1824 they had eight children.<br>
<br>Backed by superiors and patrons, Sorell in 1816 was appointed lieutenant-governor of Van Diemen's Land. The move coincided with official rethinking as to the Australian colonies finding a larger imperial role. Sorell's new post was a challenging one, since the mixed population of Van Diemen's Land consisted of about 600 convicts still under bond, 3000 free white people (largely former convicts), and probably as many Aborigines. Runaway convicts (&#145;bushrangers&#146;) formed an alternative society, ignoring and challenging authority, while sloth and corruption permeated officialdom.<br>
<br>Sorell, accompanied by Louisa Kent and her children of mixed paternity, assumed government in April 1817. He attended first to the bushrangers, and then to the fundamentals of colonial expansion: arbitrating disputes, harrying bureaucrats into efficiency, and fostering economic growth. Convicts now started arriving direct from Britain in considerable numbers (1397 in 1820). Sorell distributed most of these as &#145;assigned&#146; labourers to the likewise increasing free immigrants, generally boasting some social standing and/or ambition. All this was done with great efficiency: Sorell was an exemplar of how the wars provided training for a generation of outstanding imperial managers.<br>
<br>At times Sorell could appear ruthless. He had no qualms in punishing miscreants: the station he established at Macquarie Harbour for further disciplining convicts became a byword of cruel severity. Towards Aborigines, suffering as a result of European expansion, he evinced some philanthropy, but he gave them little place in either policies or dispatches. He rightly perceived that his major problems lay elsewhere. Regional particularism proved salient in Tasmanian affairs: Sorell found it difficult to bring a sub-colony in the island's north under his sway, and became fierce in denouncing the local commandant, Captain Gilbert Cimitiere. Likewise he had to confront potentially over-mighty subjects. Chief among these was Anthony Fenn Kemp, formerly captain of the New South Wales Corps and now a leading merchant and grazier in Van Diemen's Land, who was evidently ready to repeat his role in deposing Governor William Bligh in Sydney in 1808.<br>
<br>Generally, however, Sorell succeeded in overcoming problems and critics. His gracious manner and accessibility, coupled with a sense of humanity, even of natural justice, proved valuable assets, but the irregularity of his union with Louisa Kent proved his downfall. In 1817 Lieutenant Kent won &pound;3000 in damages against Sorell. Kemp and other opponents cited the matter when fighting the lieutenant-governor, notably in writing to British authorities. Harriet Sorell proved to the secretary of state, Lord Bathurst, that her husband had broken promises to sustain their family, and Bathurst put Sorell's private life before J. T. Bigge, whom he sent out in 1819 on a general commission of Australian inquiry. Bigge found much to admire in Sorell, as both man and governor, but added his own moral rebuke. Essentially because of these matters, Bathurst recalled Sorell.<br>
<br>Uniquely in Australian history, such news aroused more dismay than pleasure among colonists affected. Leading citizens petitioned for Sorell's continuance; ironically A. F. Kemp inspired this move. It was to no avail, however, and Sorell resigned office on 13 May 1824. He retained some influence in Australian affairs, provoking Ralph Darling&#151;the tory governor of New South Wales from 1825 to 1831&#151;to disparage &#145;the Convenient pliancy of his disposition [which] made him a favourite at Van Diemen's Land&#146;  (<span class="italic">Historical Records of Australia</span>, 1st ser., 13.190). However, Sorell's hopes for renewed appointment bore fruit only in his service as consul at Porto in 1832&#150;3. After periods living in Europe and Ireland he died in London on 4 June 1848. His estate of &pound;200 went to Louisa Kent, described as his widow (they had probably married about 1840).<br>
<br>In 1823 Harriet's eldest child with Sorell, William, joined his father in Hobart. He settled, and in 1825 married a daughter of A. F. Kemp. Their daughter Julia married Thomas Arnold junior in Hobart in 1850. Descendants of that marriage included Mary Augusta Ward, Janet Penrose Trevelyan, and Julian and Aldous Huxley.<br>
