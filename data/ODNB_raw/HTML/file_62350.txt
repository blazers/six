<span class="headword">Chamberlain <span class="st"> [<em>married name </em>Petts]</span>,  Brenda Irene</span>  (1912&#150;1971), <span class="occ">painter and writer</span>, was born on 17 March 1912 at 4 Euston Road, Bangor, Caernarvonshire, the elder child of Francis Thomas Chamberlain, originally from Hill Ridware, Staffordshire, and then employed as an inspector of bridges for the London, Midland, and Scottish Railway, and his wife, Elsie, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Cooil (<i>d</i>. 1972), who as a Labour councillor served as mayor of Bangor. Brenda Chamberlain was educated privately and at Bangor County School for Girls, where she showed such artistic ability that she was sent for lessons at the Royal Cambrian Academy in Conwy. On leaving school, she spent six months in Copenhagen, discovering the early work of Gauguin and exploring that fiercely independent style of living which she was to follow for the rest of her life. In 1931 she won a place at the Royal Academy Schools in London, where she met and, on 11 May 1935, married, the artist&#150;craftsman John Petts (1914&#150;1991); they shared a studio flat in Redcliffe Road, South Kensington.<br>
<br>The following year, drawn by their love of mountains, Chamberlain and her husband returned to Wales, making their home at T&#375;'r Mynydd, a pair of cottages high above the village of Rachub, near Llanllechid, in northern Caernarvonshire. Determined to live by their art, albeit frugally, they bought an Adana printing machine and founded the Caseg Press, originally producing hand-coloured greetings cards from their own woodcuts and engravings. Their first joint exhibition was held in Bangor in 1937. The coming of war in September 1939 and the growing rivalry between them as artists strained their marriage, particularly after John Petts became a conscientious objector and left to join a field ambulance unit in Europe and the Middle East; his wife remained in Snowdonia, working as a mountain guide for the Red Cross. Between November 1941 and June 1942, at the suggestion of the poet Alun Lewis, they printed (though not on the primitive Caseg Press) a series of six broadsheets in editions of 500 copies featuring poems by Dylan Thomas, Alun Lewis, Lynette Roberts, and Brenda Chamberlain; the story of this venture is told in her book <span class="italic">Alun Lewis and the Making of the Caseg Broadsheets</span> (1969). She and Petts separated in 1943 and were divorced three years later.<br>
<br>In 1946 Brenda Chamberlain paid a six-week visit to Germany, where she stayed with Karl von Laer, a German whom she had known in Bangor before the war. On her return to Wales she settled on Bardsey, a sparsely populated island a few miles off the extreme tip of the Ll&#375;n peninsula in north-west Wales; her companion there was a Frenchman, Jean van der Bijl. She resumed painting and writing, determined to achieve recognition as an artist in her own right, painting canvases such as <span class="italic">Children on the Seashore</span>, <span class="italic">The Cristin Children</span>, and <span class="italic">Man with a John Dory</span>. Exhibitions of her work were held at the Gimpel Fils and Zwemmers galleries in London and she won the gold medal for fine art at the national eisteddfodau of 1951 and 1953. Her first collection of poems, <span class="italic">The Green Heart</span> (1958), was dedicated to Karl von Laer, and was followed by <span class="italic">Tide-Race</span> (1962), a journal of life on Bardsey. The latter book, although a sympathetic portrait of the island, touches on the social tensions of the small community of crofter-fishermen and gave offence to some; when the writer eventually severed her connection with the place it was at the request of the owner, Lord Newborough.<br>
<br>In 1963 Brenda Chamberlain went to the island of Ydra in the Sardinia Gulf, where she was to live intermittently for the next five years; her time there was spent in the writing of a novel, <span class="italic">The Water-Castle</span> (1964), which draws on her relationship with Karl von Laer, and <span class="italic">A Rope of Vines</span> (1965), an account of her life on Ydra. The colonels' <i>coup d'&eacute;tat</i> of 1967 filled her with despair, and in November of that year she left Greece, although not before writing a play, <span class="italic">The Protagonists</span>, based on a visit to a detention centre for political prisoners. The play was performed in Bangor in October 1968, but her plans for taking it to London, together with an exhibition of the paintings she had done on Ydra, failed through lack of funds. Her last home was at 10 Menai View Terrace, Bangor.<br>
<br>Brenda Chamberlain was physically tough and self-sufficient; she had a small, boyish frame, a long bony jaw, heavy forehead, aquiline nose, and a childlike rather than feminine sensibility. Towards her friends she was kind, generous, and extremely loyal, and her nature was innocent, fervent, deeply fatalistic, and vulnerable. But she was also, towards the end of her life, frustrated in her artistic ambitions, desperately lonely, short of money, and given to bouts of depression. In 1969, shortly after the publication of <span class="italic">Poems with Drawings</span>, she suffered a nervous breakdown and spent some time in hospital. In 1970 her last exhibition, &#145;Word + image&#146;, work done on Ydra in collaboration with the composer Halim al-Dabh, was organized by the Welsh Arts Council. On 9 July 1971 she told a neighbour that she had done &#145;a very foolish thing&#146; in taking eighteen sleeping tablets and that this was &#145;a <i>cri de coeur</i>&#146;. She was rushed to Caernarfon and Anglesey Hospital but lost consciousness and died on 11 July. The coroner's verdict was accidental death, and after a service at St Peter's Church she was buried in Glanadda cemetery, Ffordd Caernarfon, Bangor, where her tombstone is inscribed with the words: &#145;I was born to live; I was born to die.&#146;<br>
