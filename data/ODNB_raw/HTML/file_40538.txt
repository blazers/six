<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Curtis, Dame  Myra</span>  (1886&#150;1971), <span class="occ">civil servant and college head</span>, was born on 2 October 1886 at 11 Belle Vue Road, Sunderland, co. Durham, one of three daughters of George Curtis, a telegraphist in the Post Office, and his wife, Annie Johnson, an elementary school teacher. Her forebears were north-country working-class, and she was brought up in a hard-working, close-knit family, which valued education. As a young girl she attended Dame Allan's endowed school at Newcastle upon Tyne until the family moved to Winchester, where she attended Winchester School for Girls. In 1904, with the assistance of a Charlotte Yonge scholarship from her school and a county scholarship, she entered Newnham College, Cambridge. At Newnham she formed enduring friendships and found the college &#145;a place of liberation and intellectual stimulus&#146;  (M. E. G., 54). She read for the classical tripos, being ranked in the first division of the second class in 1907. After leaving Cambridge she spent seven years as an assistant editor for the <span class="roman">Victoria History of the Counties of England</span> and also undertook private teaching.<br>
<br>In 1915 Curtis became a temporary civil servant in the war trade intelligence department, moving in 1917 to the Ministry of Food, where she remained until 1922. She attained permanent status in 1923 after completing the necessary special examination for the administrative class and worked in the Ministry of Pensions. From 1928 to 1937 she was superintendent at the savings bank department of the Post Office, where she introduced a machine accounting system to remove the drudgery of compiling the manuscript ledgers used for bookkeeping since the savings bank had been instituted in 1861. Although she had no business training&#151;she endorsed the generalist ethos of the British civil service that &#145;if you can do one thing you can do anything&#146;  (M. E. G., 54)&#151;her system was regarded as a model of its kind. In 1937 she moved to the Treasury as assistant secretary and director of women's establishments, where she was known as a &#145;firm disciplinarian&#146;  (ibid.).<br>
<br>Following her retirement from the civil service in 1941 Curtis, who had retained her links with Cambridge as a member of the university's women's appointments board (from 1938), was elected principal of Newnham College, taking office in January 1942. She continued to undertake public work as commissioner in the War Damage Commission (1943&#150;50), a member of the Central Land Board (1947&#150;59), and a member of the General Medical Council (1955&#150;66).<br>
<br>In November 1944 Curtis was appointed by Herbert Morrison, the home secretary, a member of a committee chaired by Sir Godfrey Russell Vick to investigate conditions in remand homes administered by the London county council, following critical comments by John Watson, a juvenile court magistrate. The inquiry began her interest in addressing the needs of the nation's problem children. Although the report on remand homes (published in February 1945) was regarded by some critics as a whitewash, she was appointed in March 1945, also at Morrison's recommendation, to head an interdepartmental committee to inquire into the care of deprived children. The setting up of the Curtis committee reflected an acknowledgement by the government of shortcomings in its treatment of orphans and other children in need of state care. Government departments were already considering the problem of children left homeless when wartime evacuation schemes were wound up, and were aware that the abolition of the poor law recommended by the Beveridge report in 1942 required new arrangements for the thousands of children currently looked after by public assistance authorities. But the decisive intervention was made by Lady Allen of Hurtwood (Marjory Allen), who had investigated the plight of children in local authority homes and found that there was no single government department with responsibility for the care of such children. Allen's letter to <span class="italic">The Times</span>, published on 15 July 1944, exposing the isolation, neglect, and lack of affection suffered by children in care, caused a sensation and public opinion forced the government to institute an inquiry. The decision was reinforced by the outcry following the death in January 1945 of Dennis O'Neill, a twelve-year-old boy in local authority care, from abuse and beatings by his foster parents.<br>
<br>The Curtis committee undertook &#145;the first enquiry in this country directed specifically to the care of children deprived of a normal home life, and covering all groups of such children&#146;  (&#145;Report of the care of children committee&#146;, <span class="italic">Parl. papers</span>, 1945&#150;6, 10.5, Cmd 6922). When it published its final report, in September 1946, the committee had heard over 200 witnesses and visited more than 400 institutions, bringing to light the extent of &#145;the physical, emotional and intellectual deprivation suffered by some of the children in public care&#146;  (Cretney, 218). Its inquiries showed that the existing divided responsibilities assumed by several government agencies were not working to the benefit of the children in the state's care. The Curtis committee insisted on the need to establish personal links in the care of children, and recommended the appointment by local authorities of children's officers: qualified women who would specialize in childcare and take a personal interest in each individual child. A single central department would have responsibility for maintaining standards in homes run by both local authorities and voluntary organizations. The latter issue gave rise to an exchange of letters in <span class="italic">The Times</span>, in October and November 1946, between Lady Allen and Curtis. Allen complained that the committee had insufficiently addressed the shortcomings of the voluntary sector, which she disliked as carrying the stigma of charity. While there was an ideological basis to the exchange, since Allen preferred centralized state control of childcare, it also stemmed from her resentment at not being invited to chair the inquiry which her campaigning had brought about.<br>
<br>The recommendations of the Curtis committee were embodied in the path-breaking <span class="roman">Children's Act</span> of 1948, which vested in the Home Office responsibility for overseeing the care of homeless or deprived children, though provision of care and inspection of homes rested with local authorities. Its provisions for trained professionals to staff institutions and to ensure that children received the most appropriate care were important in opening and securing the status of a new vocation for educated women. In recognition of her work on the inquiry, Curtis, who had been made CBE in 1942, was appointed DBE in 1949.<br>
<br>As principal of Newnham, Curtis enabled the college to carry on in the face of wartime and immediate post-war restrictions, and &#145;injected business efficiency into the academic habits of <i>laissez-faire</i>, not without some passive resistance&#146;  (M. E. G., 55). She continued, however, to be frustrated and at times exasperated by what she regarded as the &#145;indecisiveness&#146; of academic administration. Nevertheless, at the request of the fellows, she postponed her retirement for two years, until 1954. She played an important part in the negotiations on behalf of the women's colleges which resulted in women being admitted as full members of Cambridge University in 1948. In 1952 she was the first woman elected to the council of the senate at Cambridge, and she chaired the women's appointments board. She also chaired a committee which promoted a third foundation (in addition to Newnham and Girton) to accommodate the growing number of women at Cambridge; New Hall was granted recognition by the university and opened in October 1954.<br>
<br>Curtis's outlook was primarily that of an administrator, with an overwhelming urge &#145;to get things done and to jog the inefficient&#146;  (M. E. G., 57). Her &#145;impelling impetus was ethical, not religious&#146;, avoiding sentimentality  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 29 June 1971). She enjoyed cookery and gardening. In retirement she lived in Cranbrook, Kent, sharing her home for a short period with her friend the Irish historian Constantia Maxwell, and latterly at Chichester, Sussex. Curtis died in a nursing home at Bognor Regis, Sussex, on 27 June 1971.<br>
