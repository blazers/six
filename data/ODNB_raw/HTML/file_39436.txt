Her only brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7939/', "William Alexander Anthony Archibald Douglas-Hamilton")</script>, succeeded as eleventh duke. Her childhood was spent on the family estates in Scotland and in France, where her father sought (unsuccessfully) to claim the dukedom of Chatelherault. She was a much-indulged, attractive child, with chestnut hair and slightly protruding teeth, calling herself &#145;Toosey&#146;. She soon learned to manipulate her close-knit family by resorting to illness to avoid the consequences of her actions.<br>
<br>On 27 November 1832 she married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5686/', "Henry Pelham Fiennes Pelham-Clinton (1811&#150;1864)")</script>, then Lord Lincoln, the eldest son of the fourth duke of Newcastle. The marriage initially produced two sons&#151;Henry (<i>b</i>. 1834) and Edward (<i>b</i>. 1836)&#151;but rapidly began to break down, Lady Lincoln alleging that her husband forced sexual relations on her too soon after the births of her children. She began an affair with one of her brothers-in-law, or so her maid claimed in 1837. Lady Lincoln was removed by her indulgent parents to Paris where she became very ill, with what appears to have been the mixture of hysterical and physical ailments which were the pattern of her response to criticism. She was treated with homoeopathic cures, hypnosis, and laudanum, to which she became addicted. A reconciliation was effected, and the Lincolns travelled for some months in Germany and Italy. A daughter, also Susan, was born in 1839, and a son, Arthur, in 1840, but the marriage remained unstable. She had a series of affairs, during which she left her husband and children, but again returned to Lincoln and bore another son, Albert, in 1845. Society was divided in its response to Lady Lincoln, but Prince Albert stood sponsor for this last child, suggesting a surprising degree of ignorance or tolerance from the prudish court circle.<br>
<br>In 1848 Lady Lincoln went alone to Baden, ostensibly to seek medical attention for her deteriorating health, but in fact to join her latest lover, Horatio, Lord Walpole (1813&#150;1894), eldest son of the third earl of Orford, and a notorious rake. They travelled together to Italy, sometimes claiming to be cousins, sometimes brother and sister. Lincoln instituted discussions with his friends Sir Robert Peel, Henry Manning, and William Gladstone, as to how to persuade &#145;the errant Suzie&#146; to return, despite the scandal now attached to her name. Gladstone agreed to go to Italy, armed with letters of forgiveness; his diary records in detail the 3000 mile journey which he completed in twenty-seven days. Finding that the lady who called herself Mrs Laurence (or Laurance or Laurentz) was heavily pregnant, and having satisfied himself that she was really Lady Lincoln, Gladstone returned home without her. The baby, registered as Horatio, son of Horatio Walpole Laurent and Harriet, was born on 2 August 1849 in Verona. Lincoln finally sued for a parliamentary divorce, the bill first being heard in the House of Lords in May 1850. Many witnesses to Lady Lincoln's behaviour were called, and the divorce was finally granted on 14 August 1850.<br>
<br>Lady Lincoln, meanwhile, remained in Italy, and resumed the name Lady Susan Hamilton. Walpole soon deserted her, and she turned their son over to the care of Italian nuns. She employed a number of couriers on her various travels, and on 2 January 1860 she married the last of these, Jean Alexis Opdebeck, the son of a Belgian farmer. The marriage, which was apparently re-solemnized in 1862, was, according to Lady Susan, a happy one. By 1880 she was back in England, living at Burgess Hill, Sussex. Money had run short, despite her income from her parents' families (Opdebeck was rumoured to be a gambler); through Gladstone, one of the trustees of the Newcastle estates, her grandson, the seventh duke, was persuaded to make her an allowance of &pound;400 a year.<br>
<br>Lady Susan Opdebeck died at Burgess Hill on 28 November 1889; Jean Opdebeck, her husband of nearly thirty years, reported her death. She was buried at Burgess Hill. Her small estate was wiped out by her creditors. Of her five legitimate children, none but Lord Edward Pelham-Clinton either survived her or enjoyed a reputable career. He was eventually master of the queen's household. Her only daughter, Lady Susan (1839&#150;1875), had a marital career as turbulent as that of her mother, marrying, against her father's wishes, Lord Adolphus Vane-Tempest (1825&#150;1864), second son of the third marquess of Londonderry, who was insane and physically violent, and having an illegitimate child by Edward VII.<br>
