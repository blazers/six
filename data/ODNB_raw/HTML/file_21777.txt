<span class="headword">Peeters,  John</span>  (1666/7?&#150;1727?), <span class="occ">painter</span>, worked in England for about forty-two years, but almost all that is known of him comes from the notes of his contemporary and friend the writer George Vertue. Vertue recorded that Peeters, a relation of the marine painter Bonaventura Peeters (1614&#150;1652), came from Antwerp, having studied under &#145;Eckhart an history painter a man of good esteem&#146;  (Vertue, <span class="italic">Note books</span>, 3.33). No history painter of this name is now known. Peeters came to England in 1685 at the age of eighteen and was recommended to Sir Godfrey Kneller, under whom he studied and then assisted, painting draperies until 1712. Peeters also worked for other painters, &#145;but chiefly employed himself in drawings and the mending or repairing of damaged or old pictures., in which he was very skilful having great knowledge in the hands of several famous Italian but especially Flemish masters&#146;  (ibid.); this was presumably after leaving Kneller's studio. From his success he earned the nickname of Doctor Peeters.<br>
<br>Socially and professionally Peeters seems to have been well connected with the London art world, as a member of the artists' Rose and Crown club in London. Peeters seems to have had an especially close relationship with Vertue, a fellow member of the club, who credited him with teaching him drawing, as well as giving him advice and helping him &#145;raise up my character&#146; at the outset of the latter's career; Vertue even referred to Peeters as &#145;my grandmother&#146;  (Vertue, <span class="italic">Note books</span>, 6.32).<br>
<br>Peeters reportedly suffered from gout in his later years, did not produce much work, and became poor as a result. A &#145;lusty man of a free open temper a lover of good company and his bottle&#146;, a satirist who was fond of punch, Peeters remained single throughout his life  (Vertue, <span class="italic">Note books</span>, 3.33). Vertue recorded his death in September 1727, but there is no record to corroborate his claim that Peeters was buried in &#145;St Martin's Church Yard Westminster&#146; the same month, or indeed that year  (ibid.).<br>
