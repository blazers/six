<span class="headword">Love,  Nicholas</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1608, <em>d.</em> 1682), <span class="occ">politician and regicide</span>, was baptized on 26 October 1608 in St Swithun's, Winchester, the son of Dr Nicholas Love (<i>d</i>. 1630), headmaster of Winchester College, and his wife, Dousabell Colnett. He matriculated at Wadham College, Oxford, on 3 November 1626. On 12 November the next year he was admitted to Lincoln's Inn, whence he was called to the bar on 4 February 1636. He was created MA at Oxford on 31 August 1636. At Lincoln's Inn he appears to have formed some kind of connection with the Lenthall family of Oxfordshire, which helps explain his appointment in 1644 to one of the six clerkships, a lucrative office in the court of chancery under the master of the rolls, a post then held by the speaker of the House of Commons, William Lenthall. He was made an associate to the bench at Lincoln's Inn on 26 November 1644 and a bencher on 18 November 1648.<br>
<br>Love was active on behalf of parliament in his native Hampshire by the end of 1643 and was recruited to the House of Commons, winning election to one of the vacant seats at Winchester in November 1645. Having strongly opposed the conclusion of talks with the king at Newport in 1648, he was appointed to the high court of justice in January 1649, serving on four of its committees, including those for drawing up the charge against the king and for drafting the sentence. He was present at the sentencing of the king, though he did not sign the royal death warrant, and has been called as good a king-killer as any of the signatories [<i>see also </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/70599/', "Regicides")</script>]. Certainly he became a forward revolutionary but his express confidence, before the trial began, that the charge would be &#145;nothing, but what he knew the K[ing] could cleerely acquit himselfe of&#146;  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Clarendon 34, fol. 17<i>v</i>) suggests a more moderate spirit. It also lends some credibility to the otherwise standard self-exculpatory rhetoric of Love's plea for mercy in 1660.<br>
<br>Love was closely involved in the constitutional revolution which ran parallel with developments in the great hall at Westminster, and served energetically the kingless Commonwealth set up in the wake of the regicide and the abolition of the monarchy. In parliament he chaired the debates of the committee of the whole house which issued in the passage of the <span class="roman">Navigation Act</span> in November 1651. In the following year he shared special responsibility for the legislation annexing Scotland with his fellow Winchester MP, Lord Commissioner John Lisle. He also sat on the last three councils of state down to the interruption in 1653. In the year of Worcester he had assumed some of the conciliar responsibility for placing urgent matters of home defence and militia organization before the house. At the council board he also had a hand in Scottish and Irish affairs, foreign policy, trade, and government finance, as well as press regulation. Finally he was influential in the transformation of English political iconography witnessed under the Commonwealth.<br>
<br>It has been claimed that Love joined the angry chorus of dissent which greeted Cromwell's abrupt termination of the council of state on 20 April 1653, but an unfortunate gap in the state papers precludes confirmation of Love's presence in council on that occasion. Certainly by 1655 Major-General William Goffe, keeping a watchful eye on Hampshire, appears to have had his suspicions about Love's intentions towards the Cromwellian regime. But if he had gone into overt opposition, his hostility to the protectorate was doubtless connected with the controversial ordinance of 1654 for the reform of chancery, which abolished Love's office as one of the six clerks in chancery. At least one of his colleagues protested mightily against this arbitrary destruction of patentees' property rights.<br>
<br>The six clerks' low fortunes revived in 1659, when the Rumpers, Love included, returned to government. Yet within months the Commonwealthsmen were once again assailed by their military protectors and by December Love was at Portsmouth, where the corporation had raised the standard of opposition to the military junto. There he joined the co-ordinators of the resistance to Fleetwood and Lambert, Sir Arthur Hesilrige MP and Valentine Walton MP. All three were made burgesses of the town. In January 1660 the Rump, returned to power, elevated Love to the council of state (where he was appointed president), and gave order for repayment of his substantial expenditure for the Commonwealth cause during the stand-off at Portsmouth.<br>
<br>By 1660 Love had become too big a fish, and his appetite for church and royalist lands too rapacious, for his plea for leniency to receive special treatment from the restored Stuart regime. In the spring he arranged to embark for the continent together with Hesilrige and Robert Wallop, but when the other two changed their minds Love was left to make the voyage alone, &#145;he being resolved not to trust the mercey of enraged beastes of prey&#146;  (Ludlow, 281). He survived pirates and tempests in his passage to Hamburg via Norway before joining his friend Edmund Ludlow and other <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/70599/', "regicides")</script> in Vevey, Switzerland, where he died on 5 November 1682; he was buried in St Martin's Church there. The fate of his wife, Elizabeth (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Buggs), of Lambeth, whom Love had married on 6 October 1655, is unknown.<br>
