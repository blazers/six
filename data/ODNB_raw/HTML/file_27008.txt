<span class="headword">Taverner,  William</span>  (<em>c.</em>1677&#150;1731), <span class="occ">playwright</span>, born in London, was descended from the Taverners of Hexton in Hertfordshire. His father was Jeremiah Taverner (<i>b</i>. 1651), a successful portrait painter in the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries, who was probably the same Jeremiah Taverner who married Elizabeth Needham in April 1676. Little is known of Taverner's early life except that he trained for a legal career in Doctors' Commons, where he became a proctor of the court of arches of Canterbury. Baker records that Taverner inherited his father's &#145;genius for painting, but never exercised it with a view to profit&#146;  (Baker, 1.704). Instead, while continuing to practise as a lawyer, Taverner began to write for the stage. His first work, a masque entitled <span class="italic">Ixion</span> (1697), was performed as part of Edward Ravenscroft's <span class="italic">The Italian Husband</span> at Lincoln's Inn Fields during the winter of 1697&#150;8. Several years later Taverner produced his first full-length play, <span class="italic">The Faithful Bride of Granada</span>, which was staged at Drury Lane in the winter of 1703&#150;4. This may have been followed by a comedy entitled <span class="italic">The Lunatick</span> (1705), which is sometimes attributed to Taverner on account of its similarity to his later work <span class="italic">The Female Advocates</span> (1713). <span class="italic">The Lunatick</span> was rejected by the actors at Lincoln's Inn Fields and consequently failed to reach the stage. Taverner's next comedy, <span class="italic">The Maid the Mistress</span>, met with a half-empty house at Drury Lane in June 1708, a failure which prompted the playwright to promise &#145;never &hellip; to bring again on the Stage any more of my Scribling&#146;  (Taverner, <span class="italic">Maid the Mistress</span>, 1708, sig. A3<i>r</i>).<br>
<br>After a gap of several years Taverner began work on <span class="italic">The Female Advocates, or, The Frantic Stock-Jobber</span>, recycling a number of incidents from <span class="italic">The Lunatick</span>. The finished comedy was staged at Drury Lane on 6 January 1713. In March 1716 Taverner produced a three-act farce entitled <span class="italic">Every Body Mistaken</span>, based on Shakespeare's <span class="italic">Comedy of Errors</span>. To this he affixed a masque, <span class="italic">Presumptuous Love</span>, set to music by William Turner. A third-night benefit performance of the two pieces at Lincoln's Inn Fields on 13 March 1716 earned Taverner over &pound;75. As a result of this success, John Rich, the theatre manager at Lincoln's Inn Fields, afforded Taverner the luxury of new costumes for his next work, <span class="italic">The Artful Husband</span>, which premi&egrave;red on 11 February 1717. The central episode of <span class="italic">The Artful Husband</span>, in which the heroine disguises herself as a man, then marries her guardian's widow in order to reclaim her stolen inheritance, is taken from <span class="italic">The Counterfeit Bridegroom</span> (1677), a comedy sometimes attributed to Thomas Betterton. Further incidents in Taverner's play are lifted from Shirley's <span class="italic">The Lady of Pleasure</span> (1635). Despite the extensive borrowing, <span class="italic">The Artful Husband</span> was a success. Taverner made over &pound;84 from ticket sales on the third and sixth days of performance, but was denied a third benefit night by Rich. In the preface to the printed edition of <span class="italic">The Artful Husband</span> (1717), Taverner praises the actors but rails at what he terms &#145;a private Injustice from the Master of the House&#146;  (Taverner, <span class="italic">Artful Husband</span>, 1717, sig. A3<i>v</i>). On 3 December 1717 Taverner produced a sequel to his comedy, entitled <span class="italic">The Artful Wife</span>, which ran for three nights. A further comedy, <span class="italic">'Tis Well if it Takes</span>, was staged on 28 February 1719, and ran for five nights. Neither play matched the success of <span class="italic">The Artful Husband</span>, which was revived during the 1718&#150;19 season, and again in 1721, when Taverner finally received the benefit night owing to him. Long after Taverner's death, <span class="italic">The Artful Husband</span> was adapted by the elder George Colman and retitled <span class="italic">The Female Chevalier</span> (1778). Taverner's comedy also served as the basis for William Macready's <span class="italic">The Bank Note</span> (1795).<br>
<br>Aside from his work as a dramatist, little is known of Taverner's life. He continued to practise as a lawyer until his death on 8 January 1731 at his house in Doctors' Commons. A short obituary notice in the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> describes Taverner as a man &#145;remarkably honest in his business&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 33). His widow, Alathea Taverner, whom he had married about 1702, took out letters of administration at the prerogative court of Canterbury on 6 February 1731. Their son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27009/', "William Taverner")</script>, inherited the family talent for painting and subsequently pursued a career as an artist.<br>
