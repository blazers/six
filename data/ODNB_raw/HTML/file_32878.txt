<span class="headword">Pennant,  George Sholto Gordon  Douglas-</span>, second Baron Penrhyn  (1836&#150;1907), <span class="occ">landowner and quarry owner</span>, was born on 30 September 1836 at Linton Springs, Yorkshire, the elder son and third child of Edward Gordon Douglas (1800&#150;1886), third son of John Douglas, second son of James Douglas, sixteenth earl of Morton. His mother (his father's first wife) was Juliana Isabella Mary (1808&#150;1842), eldest daughter and coheir of George Hay Dawkins-Pennant of Penrhyn Castle. In 1841 Edward Gordon Douglas assumed the additional surname of Pennant by royal licence after his wife inherited a large estate in north Wales; he was raised to the peerage on 3 August 1866 as first Baron Penrhyn. Douglas-Pennant had a brother, four sisters, and five half-sisters. His stepmother was Maria Louisa Fitzroy (<i>d</i>. 1912), daughter of the fifth duke of Grafton.<br>
<br>Douglas-Pennant was educated at Eton College and at Christ Church, Oxford. In August 1860 he married Pamela Blanche (1839&#150;1869), daughter of Sir Charles Rushout; they had a son, Edward Sholto (1864&#150;1927), who succeeded as third Baron Penrhyn, and six daughters, the youngest of whom was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/67667/', "Violet Douglas-Pennant")</script>. Douglas-Pennant's second wife, whom he married in October 1875, was Gertrude Jessy (<i>d</i>. 1940), daughter of Henry Glynne and niece by marriage of W. E. Gladstone (who was called on to deal with several family disputes); they had two sons and six daughters. Penrhyn Castle was built by Thomas Hopper (1776&#150;1856) over the years 1820 to 1837 in the revived Norman style. The Pennants' London house was Mortimer House, Halkin Street, Belgravia, and they had country houses at Wicken, Stony Stratford, at Betws-y-coed in Caernarvonshire, and at Cairnton in Banffshire. Master of the Grafton hounds from 1882 to 1891, Douglas-Pennant enjoyed horse-racing, shooting, and fishing.<br>
<br>In 1860 Douglas-Pennant became major commanding the Caernarvonshire rifle volunteers, which was affiliated in 1881 to the 4th (militia) battalion, Royal Welch Fusiliers; he later became its honorary colonel. He was a JP, a county councillor, and the deputy lieutenant of Caernarvonshire. In 1866 he was elected unopposed as Conservative MP for Caernarvonshire, but in 1868 he was defeated by the Liberal T. L. D. Jones-Parry. He regained the seat in 1874, but lost it in 1880 to the Liberal Watkin Williams.<br>
<br>Douglas-Pennant succeeded to the peerage in 1886 as second Baron Penrhyn; his inheritance included 41,348 acres in Caernarvonshire, and Penrhyn quarry, which, with 3000 men, was the largest slate quarry in the world. He was a controversial figure in north Wales. In his evidence to the Welsh land commissioners in 1893 he described the North Wales Property Association, which he had founded in 1886, as a &#145;mutual self-protection&#146; society against the plans for land nationalization being promoted by sections of the Welsh press. He said the depression in agriculture had meant that for many years he had received from his land no income in excess of his expenditure upon it; and he indicated that in Wales land reform was linked to nationalism and to hatred of the &#145;alien&#146; race.<br>
<br>Penrhyn quarry had a history of strikes, despite the wide-ranging paternalism of the Pennants. Many of the quarrymen lived in the nonconformist stronghold of Bethesda, 5 miles from Bangor, or in small quarrying communities. Increasingly, the Pennants were regarded as divided from the workers by class, language, politics, and religion. In 1901 half the workforce spoke Welsh only, but there were political and sectarian divisions as a minority were Conservatives and Anglicans. Unity was further reduced by disparity of earnings resulting from variations in the quality of the rock allocated to different groups, which encouraged favouritism. Lord Penrhyn's first action was to terminate the Pennant Lloyd agreement of 1874, which had allowed a workers' committee to control management, wages, and prices. The North Wales Quarrymen's Union (NWQU), established in 1874, was seen by him as a means of giving control to the workers, and he refused to accept collective bargaining. Arthur Wyatt, the inefficient manager, was discreetly dismissed, and was replaced in 1886 by E. A. Young (1860&#150;1910), an energetic English businessman.<br>
<br>In August 1896 long-standing resentment over the employment of unskilled contractors flared up. On 29 September the men refused to accept their &#145;bargains&#146; (allocations of rock), and they were locked out. Their grievances included strict discipline and lack of union recognition. They hoped for intervention by the Board of Trade, but under the <span class="roman">Conciliation (Trades Disputes) Act</span> of 1896 the board had voluntary powers only. In 1897 Lord Penrhyn and Young joined the National Free Labour Association, and three attempts to reopen the quarry failed. After complicated negotiations, which involved W. J. Parry, who had been secretary and president of the NWQU, the men accepted the terms of settlement in August 1897. Belatedly they realized that these terms contained no concessions. The net profit of the quarry for the year 1898 was &pound;133,000, but uneasy labour relations prevailed.<br>
<br>The Penrhyn dispute (1900&#150;03) began on 24 October 1900 with an outbreak of violence against two unpopular contractors, one of whom was seriously injured. On 1 November there was a further riot against another contractor, and the Bangor magistrates authorized the chief constable of Caernarvonshire to call in the troops. Six of the ringleaders were found guilty and fined. The men returned to the quarry on 22 November in resentful mood, and soon walked out again. Young closed the quarry, and Bethesda was besieged by London journalists. Many of the men took trains to south Wales in search of work. Relief for the suffering families came from the <span class="italic">Daily News</span> and <span class="italic">The Clarion</span>, the Penrhyn Relief Fund, the General Federation of Trade Unions, the NWQU, and the Penrhyn choirs. Bethesda was improbably promoted as a holiday resort. On 11 June 1901 the quarry was reopened with about 600 men, whose individual applications had been vetted. Lord Penrhyn met the men and applauded their courage. Each was given a gold sovereign and a pay rise at the end of the day. At the mass meeting in the Bethesda market hall that night, a decision was taken to display notices in Welsh in the strikers' windows reading, &#145;There is no traitor in this house.&#146;<br>
<br>In July 1901 W. J. Parry accused Lord Penrhyn of causing the death-rate to rise in Bethesda, although no rise had occurred. Penrhyn brought a successful libel action against Parry, and was awarded &pound;500 damages in March 1903. Violence between the two sides erupted frequently, especially at holiday times when the strikers returned home, and on three occasions troops were brought in. Extra police were provided to escort the workers to and from the quarry. In March and April 1903 the Liberal Party and the Labour Party vied with each other in debates in the House of Commons in supporting the strikers and reviling Lord Penrhyn. The drying-up of funds finally forced the men to surrender, and on 14 November 1903 Henry Jones, chairman of the regular mass meetings, wrote to Lord Penrhyn that the struggle was at an end. Penrhyn acknowledged this letter briefly, and wrote to a friend that he had fought to deter &#145;socialist agitators&#146; from &#145;deluding the working classes&#146;. The steady decline in the slate industry reduced the number of jobs available, and many of the strikers were not re-employed. Union membership in the quarry almost collapsed, but Bethesda nursed its grievances and the divisions never completely healed.<br>
<br>A tall, spare, bearded figure, with a long, narrow face and melancholy eyes, Lord Penrhyn was slightly deaf. He died suddenly of influenza at Mortimer House on 10 March 1907, and was buried at St John's Church near Wicken.<br>
