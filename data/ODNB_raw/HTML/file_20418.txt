<span class="headword">Nye,  Stephen</span>  (1647/8&#150;1719), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and religious controversialist</span>, was the elder son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20415/', "John Nye (bap. 1620, d. 1686?)")</script>, Church of England clergyman, and his first wife, Elizabeth Marshall (<i>d</i>. 1654). Nye's parentage linked him to leading puritan figures of the 1640s: his father's uncle was Philip Nye (whom the father was assisting at Acton, Middlesex, about the time of Stephen's birth), and his mother's father, Stephen Marshall. Ironically, John Nye was the author of an anti-Socinian tract.<br>
<br>Nye went to school in Cambridge before being admitted sizar at Magdalene College, Cambridge, on 11 March 1662, aged fourteen. After graduating BA in 1666, he was ordained deacon by the bishop of London in March 1667 and ordained priest by the bishop of Ely on 24 December 1671. On 25 March 1679 he became rector of Little Hormead, Hertfordshire, a poor living with a population of about 100 inhabitants. Here he spent the rest of his life, and here on 15 February 1690 he baptized his only child with his wife, Mary (<i>d</i>. 1713/14). Nye regularly read the service, preached &#145;once every Lord's day&#146;, and had &#145;an opportunity very seldom lacking of supplying some neighbouring cure&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>). It is clear from his will that he possessed a library of books, of which he undoubtedly made good use.<br>
<br>Nye early counted the businessman and philanthropist Thomas Firmin a close friend, and influenced his theological stance in the trinitarian controversy prompted by Sherlock's <span class="italic">Vindication of the Doctrine of the Trinity</span> (1690). He wrote a number of tracts which were published at Firmin's expense. A ready and erudite writer, he adopted a Sabellian attitude, regarding the persons of the Trinity as several modes of the one God. At the same time he stoutly defended his right to adhere to the Church of England. Publishing anonymously, as was then necessary to avoid legal punishment and social discrimination, he was the first writer to employ the term &#145;unitarian&#146; in the English language. This was in his <span class="italic">Brief History of the Unitarians, called also Socinians, in Four Letters to a Friend</span> (1687). The friend was Firmin, and an appended letter was by Henry Hedworth, layman and pamphleteer and follower of John Biddle (Bidle). Biddle had published the <span class="italic">Racovian Catechism</span> (in Latin) in 1652, a work based upon the writings of the Italian reformer Faustus Socinus, who denied both the deity and the pre-existence of Christ.<br>
<br>The so-called <span class="italic">Unitarian Tracts</span> (from 1694 onwards), to which Nye (and possibly also John Locke) contributed, were published and bound into at least five collections. Nye's <span class="italic">Considerations on the Explications of the Doctrine of the Trinity</span> (1694), addressed to Hedworth, and his <span class="italic">Institutions Considering the Holy Trinity</span> (1703), which the author considered his most mature work, were widely circulated. Nye was also the author of <span class="italic">Some Thoughts upon Dr Sherlock's Vindication of the Doctrine of the Holy Trinity</span> (1696), using phrases and quotations from Socinian scholars. In this tract he wrote, characteristically:<blockquote>I am neither a Papist nor a Lutheran, a Calvinist nor a Socinian &hellip; I am a Christian. I side only with Truth &hellip; and take shelter in the bosom of that Catholic Church which stands independently of anything under the name of a Party. (p. 18)</blockquote>Nye's intention throughout was to define the doctrine of the Trinity in a way acceptable to the growing number of Anglican clergymen who found themselves unable to accept a doctrine capable of a tritheistic interpretation. Like John Locke, he believed in the truth and reasonableness of Christianity and not in metaphysical dogma. The writers of the tracts invariably used the term &#145;unitarian&#146; in an inclusive sense, covering Sebellians, Arians, unitarianism, and Socinians, though the last of these names was regularly employed by the orthodox as a term of reproach and abuse. Nye is notable for propounding the principle common to unitarians and the Dutch and Irish remonstrants, that consciences ought to be free in matters of faith.<br>
<br>In 1712 Nye drew up a manuscript account of the glebe and tithes of Little Hormead, about which there had been disputes. His health declined, and he died on 6 January 1719. He was buried at Little Hormead four days later. In his will he remembered not only his family but his &#145;trusty friends and neighbours&#146; and showed his concern for &#145;the poor&#146;. His wife, Mary, predeceased him by five years.<br>
