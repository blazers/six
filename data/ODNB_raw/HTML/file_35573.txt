<span class="headword">Pope,  Samuel</span>  (1826&#150;1901), <span class="occ">barrister</span>, born in Manchester on 11 December 1826, was the eldest son of Samuel Pope, a merchant of London and Manchester, and his wife, Phebe, daughter of William Rushton, merchant, of Liverpool. After private education Pope was employed in business, and in his leisure he attended debating societies, developing an aptitude for public speaking. He studied at London University, and entered at the Middle Temple on 13 November 1855.<br>
<br>During the 1850s Pope became a member of the temperance organization, the Alliance, of which he later became secretary. At the 1857 election, Pope stood as a candidate for the Alliance at Stoke-on-Trent, withdrawing before the poll because of failing support for a permissive bill. Two years later in 1859 Pope once again unsuccessfully contested Stoke, this time as a Liberal candidate.<br>
<br>On 7 June 1858, Pope was called to the bar. For a few years he practised with success in Manchester, but he moved to London in 1865. In the same year, and again in 1868, he unsuccessfully contested Bolton as a Liberal candidate. In 1869 he was, however, made recorder of the town and took silk. He was noted for his eloquence and commanding personality and in London he soon devoted himself to parliamentary practice; in particular he acted as parliamentary counsel for several railway companies. By the time of his death in 1901 he was the leader of the parliamentary bar. He was chosen a bencher of his inn on 27 January 1870, and was treasurer in 1888&#150;9, when he made a valuable donation of books to the library.<br>
<br>During his career, Pope held several company posts, including chairman of the England Association of American Bond and Share-Holders and also of the New York Belting and Packing Company. He was also a freemason, becoming senior grand deacon in grand lodge in 1886. He was married to Hannah, daughter of Thomas Bury of Timperley Lodge, Cheshire, in 1848; she predeceased him in 1880, leaving no children. Pope died at his home, 74 Ashley Gardens, Westminster, on 22 July 1901, and was buried at Llanbedr in Merioneth, of which county he was a JP and deputy lieutenant.<br>
