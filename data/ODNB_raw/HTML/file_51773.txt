<span class="headword">Appleton <span class="st"> [<em>married name </em>Lachlan]</span>,  Elizabeth</span>  (<em>c.</em>1790&#150;1849), <span class="occ">educationist and author</span>, was the fourth, but third living, child of a large, impecunious family. Her mother, the eldest daughter of a respectable Warwick family, married her father in Worcester in 1785 or 1788 and lived in Warwick. They moved to Castle Street, Bristol, where Elizabeth was born. Her father was interested in little but the arts, primarily music, and quickly went through his wife's fortune and his own property. His dedication to Elizabeth's eldest brother, whom he believed was a musical genius, caused him to move the family to London, where, unfortunately, the boy died before fulfilling his father's dreams. Her father, who was employed in some capacity at the Kidbrook Park estate, Sussex, died about 1802. The family's fluctuating financial situation resulted in a peripatetic existence and perpetual instability. For Elizabeth, this was reflected in the vagaries of her education, which ranged from being schooled at home by her mother, through being a charity student in a school run by a distant relative, to being a day student at a large and fashionable London school. At the age of fourteen she accompanied her former governess, Miss Shepherd, to France when the teacher attempted to move her school there in the interlude between the revolutionary wars.<br>
<br>Elizabeth Appleton's quick intelligence and love of reading were recognized and encouraged by her family, who believed that her future independence lay in teaching. Her unhappiness as a charity student sensitized her to the needs of timid and socially insecure students, while her appreciation of the failings of contemporary educational practice persuaded her of the merits of systematic, cumulative learning based on carefully directed, personal tutorial teaching. As an adolescent she spent weekends and holidays with affluent relatives in the West End of London, where she was introduced to elevated and cosmopolitan society. About 1811, after an argument with her mother, these relatives supplied her with the means to accompany her closest friend and her family to the continent for a trip that was ultimately to last three years. She left England without telling her mother and, years later, after her own conversion, this disobedience would prey upon her and be reinterpreted as a fundamental sin. The fact that her mother had become staunchly evangelical by the time that she returned to England seems likely to have been influential.<br>
<br>Once in England again, Elizabeth Appleton became a governess. She was employed to teach the daughters of a number of noble families, including those of the countess of Leven and Melville, to whom she dedicated the publication of <span class="italic">Private Education, or, A Practical Plan for the Studies of Young Ladies: with an address to parents, private governesses, and young ladies</span> (1815; 2nd edn, 1816), the book that was to establish her reputation as an educationist. Her ideas about women's education drew upon those of reforming educationists such as Mrs Trimmer. Young ladies' education should be thorough and balanced, she maintained, including serious subjects such as geography, arithmetic, and astronomy. In particular, it should aim to inculcate morality and religion. What made her publications popular was her ability to translate these ideas into specific details and practical systems. She gave governesses and parents models to follow, recommending subjects, texts, and methodologies for students of different ages and abilities. She also laid particular importance on the part played by the teacher or &#145;preceptress&#146; as an example of knowledge and morality. While only women who could meet these high standards should be encouraged to teach, she argued, the best deserved better pay, more appreciation, and either an annuity or a pension to allow them to retire comfortably.<br>
<br>The success of <span class="italic">Private Education</span> encouraged Elizabeth Appleton to continue writing, and a number of other publications ensued. These included <span class="italic">Early Education, or, The Management of Children Considered with a View to their Future Character</span> (2nd edn, 1821) and <span class="italic">The Youth's Guide to the French Language</span> (1824). By 1825, according to the editor of her last publications, she was earning &pound;4000 p.a. from the school she had established for young ladies in Portland Place, London. She had been consulted about the education of Princess Charlotte and purportedly even asked to be the governess of Princess Victoria. Even with allowance for exaggeration, however, she was undoubtedly doing well by the time she married a poor curate, the Revd John Lachlan, in 1825. She immediately sought to improve his situation by purchasing him an advowson. Unfortunately, her finances became entangled with those of her uncle who was managing the purchase of the living of West Moulsey, Surrey. When he went bankrupt before the deal was finalized, she and her husband were financially ruined.<br>
<br>This marked the beginning of a depressing decline in Elizabeth's fortunes. Writing under her married name, as Mrs Elizabeth Lachlan, she published <span class="italic">Leonora, or, The Presentation at Court: being the first of a series of narratives called young ladies' tales</span> (2 vols., 1829); however, her family situation steadily deteriorated, and by 1832 her husband had fled to Dunkirk to escape his debts. Although she continued to seek ecclesiastical preferment for him, and also made numerous attempts to re-establish her school in less expensive venues, she remained unsuccessful. This was due, in part, to the fact that her reputation as an educationist had been irreparably damaged after her religious conversion about 1830. Her excessive&#151;and increasing&#151;evangelicalism had led contemporaries to denounce her as a fanatic. The last years of her life were given over to proselytization and writing and disseminating religious tracts. She died of cholera at Rathbone Place, London, on 8 September 1849. Her last works, <span class="italic">Magdalena's Voyages and Travels through the Kingdom of this World into the Kingdom of Grace</span> (1850) and <span class="italic">Jehovah Jireh</span> (1850), the latter collected and edited by an unnamed physician, were published shortly after her death. Grimly moralistic and, especially in the case of the brief autobiographical sketch included in <span class="italic">Jehovah Jireh</span>, unremittingly self-critical and arguably even unbalanced, these books are a far cry from her earlier educational texts.<br>
