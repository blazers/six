<span class="headword">Cooke,  Sophia</span>  (1814&#150;1895), <span class="occ">missionary and schoolmistress</span>, was born in the Norfolk village of Hilborough, on 27 February 1814, attended school in Bury St Edmunds, and was a governess in Suffolk for twenty years before leaving England in March 1853 to become superintendent of the Chinese Girls' School in Singapore as agent for the Society for Promoting Female Education in the East. Tall, blonde, blue-eyed, with a lively sense of humour, she was immediately welcomed into the expatriate British community, but felt her main mission was among Asians. The only other protestant missionary in Singapore at that time was a self-supporting independent, Benjamin Keasberry, who worked among the Malays.<br>
<br>In 1856 Sophia Cooke (a lifelong Anglican) persuaded the Anglican chaplain to begin mission work among the Chinese and invited a presbyterian Chinese catechist from Amoy (Xiamen) to conduct Singapore's first Chinese-language services in her school compound. Providing a sound general education, along with Christian teaching and practical housewifery skills, the Chinese Girls' School was also a refuge for orphans and adolescents rescued from prostitution. Many school leavers went on to spread the Christian message and minister to the poor and sick in Singapore, China, and as far afield as Korea. Except for her own salary Sophia Cooke had to raise all the funds for the school and for outside charity work. Much came from bazaars of handwork provided by well wishers in Britain, with whom Sophia Cooke kept up an indefatigable correspondence, while expatriate Singapore businessmen gave willingly to her good causes.<br>
<br>The school was the most important of many charitable works. Sophia Cooke organized regular <span class="roman">Bible</span> classes for Chinese women, policemen, soldiers, and others, and each week she devoted one day to visiting Asian wards in the general and military hospitals. In 1865 she established the first of two &#145;ragged schools&#146; for indigent mothers and children, and ten years later she started the YWCA in Singapore on an informal basis. In 1882 she opened the Sailors' Rest near the docks; this offered cheerful surroundings, cheap beds, and food, as well as <span class="roman">Bible</span> classes which she conducted herself, winning many converts.<br>
<br>Initially enjoying excellent health, it was nearly ten years before Sophia Cooke took her first home leave, but in 1869 she became seriously ill and subsequently had to spend extended periods of sick leave in England. Defying acute rheumatism and failing sight, she continued to work a six-day week, holding <span class="roman">Bible</span> readings and visiting the sick. Too frail to climb the stairs to Chinese tenements, she was carried upstairs by police constables.<br>
<br>After being confined to bed for just a fortnight, Sophia Cooke died of erysipelas in Singapore on 14 September 1895 and was buried the same day. With policemen as pall bearers, the funeral was attended by many soldiers, sailors, and Chinese families, in addition to leading officials and clergy of all denominations. The following Sunday a memorial service was held in St Andrew's Cathedral, Singapore.<br>
<br>Sophia Cooke was a capable, practical missionary, admired and respected alike by pupils, policemen, sailors, soldiers, officials, and business people, and encouraging all Christians to work together for the welfare of others.<br>
