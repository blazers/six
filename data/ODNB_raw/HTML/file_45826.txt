<span class="headword">Squire,  Jane</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1686, <em>d.</em> 1743), <span class="occ">scientific writer</span>, was born in York and baptized in the city at St Michael-le-Belfrey on 6 May 1686. She was the second daughter of Robert Squire (1648&#150;1707) of York and his wife, Priscilla, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Bower (1660&#150;1711), daughter of Edward Bower, a merchant of Bridlington Quay. Her parents had married on 13 December 1684, and also had an older daughter, Priscilla (1685&#150;1731), and a son, Robert, who died in infancy in 1688. Robert Squire was a proctor of the civil law who owned a number of properties, including profitable lead and alum mines in Yorkshire, and sat as MP for Scarborough from 1705. Following the death of their father in 1707 and of their mother four years later, Jane Squire and her sister each received a substantial inheritance, which provided them with an unusual degree of independence. In 1711 Priscilla married Bryan Cooke (<i>d</i>. 1734) of Doncaster, who had been elected MP for East Retford in January of that year and who succeeded his father as fourth baronet in 1732.<br>
<br>By at least 1721 Jane Squire was recorded as living in Westminster, London  (TNA: PRO, <i>Squire v. Burnaby</i>, C11/2689/17). A year later she brought a lawsuit against twelve individuals, including Edward Harley, second earl of Oxford and Mortimer, and Thomas, Lord Harley. The lawsuit sought greater transparency over an expedition of two ships sent in 1721 to &#145;fish upon wrecks&#146; (that is, to conduct maritime salvage) in which Squire had invested thousands of pounds with no return. Two others named in the lawsuit&#151;John Burnaby and Branson Oulson&#151;had captained the expedition's ships while another defendant, John Hutchinson, had acted as a middleman and had received Squire's investment. It was not unusual for women during this period to participate in lawsuits, but it was rare for a woman to lodge such a detailed and vehement complaint and one against individuals as powerful as the Harleys. Hutchinson's initial response, accusing Squire of chasing &#145;adventures&#146; or risky investments, was followed in 1725 with a more damaging testimony that Squire no longer had the right to be heard in court since she was a &#145;Popish recusant convict&#146;  (TNA: PRO, <i>Squire v. Burnaby</i>, C11/303/19). Though an accusation of Roman Catholic worship had been lodged against Squire in September 1722&#151;suspiciously soon after she began her action&#151;this had been dismissed  (Middlesex session rolls, LMA, MJ/SR/2394). With the failure of her lawsuit Squire was committed to the Fleet prison, London, for debt on 15 July 1726. She appears to have owed &pound;3400 to a couple named Bower (or Bowers), who may have been maternal relatives  (TNA: PRO, PRIS 1/3 127). Following the passage of an <span class="roman">Act for the Relief of Insolvent Debtors</span>, she was freed on 23 July 1729.<br>
<br>On her release Squire dedicated herself to developing an improved method of finding the longitude co-ordinate of a ship at sea. She was motivated by the <span class="roman">Longitude Act</span> of 1714, which offered rewards of up to &pound;20,000 for methods that could determine longitude within a certain degree of accuracy and specifically on a trial voyage to the West Indies as well as near the coastlines.<br>
<br>While basic astronomy was increasingly viewed as an appropriate female pastime, the longitude problem's confluence of navigation, mathematics, and financial interest was not. No other woman is known to have openly pursued the British longitude rewards and funds, though at least one&#151;Sir Joshua Reynolds's sister, Elizabeth Johnson&#151;did so anonymously in the 1780s.<br>
<br>In 1731 Squire had the attorney-general, Sir Philip Yorke, read the 1714 act aloud to her prior to beginning work on her proposal. She discussed her ideas with Hans Sloane, president of the Royal Society and a commissioner of longitude, and with the mathematician Abraham de Moivre. Both directed her to Edmond Halley, who as astronomer royal was perhaps the most influential of the commissioners; however, he did not acknowledge her approaches. In response, Squire sent a printed copy of her proposal to each commissioner and to de Moivre in August 1731.<br>
<br>Squire's scheme was rooted in her Roman Catholic faith, about which she was unusually open. She proposed a new universal language and system of measurement with which&#151;by fostering universal communication and understanding&#151;she sought to move humanity closer to the state before the fall of the Tower of Babel. Squire described her plan as a &#145;simple easy Method&#146; of navigation suitable for sailors with little mathematical knowledge  (Squire, <span class="italic">Proposal for Discovering Our Longitude</span>, 8). It involved dividing the heavens into more than one million equal segments, each centred on a constellation with a zenith point. This would allow sailors to take a precise reading as they navigated, with an astral clock to help correct the difference between apparent and mean solar time. Once the meridian was reset to Bethlehem, ships that stayed true to their course could be piloted by matching the skies to specialist cards based on the star catalogues of the astronomer John Flamsteed. Squire also proposed the use of a &#145;Speaking-Trumpet&#146; to announce local time from &#145;the Top of a Church or some other appointed Place&#146;, and the deployment of artificial sea creatures as regularly spaced buoys to aid mapping  (ibid., 4). Though such details sound fantastical they reflect Squire's familiarity with contemporary intellectual and utilitarian pursuits: attempts to develop universal languages and systems of measurement were relatively common, as was the proposed use of regularly spaced man-made landmarks to address the longitude and similar problems.<br>
<br>In subsequent letters, and in conversation with individual commissioners, Squire expressed anger that a sitting board of longitude had not met since 1714 to consider proposed solutions. The officials had instead continued to act as independent experts until specific proposals proved sufficiently promising to deserve communal attention and financial support. Some of the commissioners first met in 1737 to offer funds to the clockmaker John Harrison, a meeting of which Squire and many others were unaware. In response to her ongoing complaints, Sir Thomas Hanmer, one of the few remaining original commissioners of 1714, encouraged Squire to publish her ideas which &#145;if they carry that Demonstration which you think they do, Mankind will greedily receive&#146;  (Squire, <span class="italic">Proposal for Discovering Our Longitude</span>, 22). Squire believed that the opposition she encountered was in large part due to her gender. In January 1733 she wrote to Hanmer of her lifelong interest in more than the traditional female pastimes:<blockquote>I do not remember any Play-thing, that does not appear to me a mathematical Instrument; nor any mathematical Instrument, that does not appear to me a Play-thing: I see not, therefore, why I should confine myself to Needles, Cards, and Dice. (ibid., 20)</blockquote>In later correspondence Hanmer acknowledged &#145;that you are to expect to lye under some Prejudice upon account of your Sex&#146;  (27 July 1741, in Squire, <span class="italic">Proposal for Discovering Our Longitude</span>, 54).<br>
<br>In the wake of the second <span class="roman">Longitude Act</span> of 1740 Squire tried once more to interest the commissioners in her scheme, but with little success. On 16 January 1742 she wrote angrily to them concerning rumours that the scientific instrument maker George Graham was to present them with an astral clock patterned after her own design. Later that year she turned to publishing her method. Squire's <span class="italic">A Proposal for Discovering our Longitude</span> elaborated on her explanation of 1731 and included a selection of her correspondence with commissioners and others. It was published in English and French in 1742 with a second edition, in English only, in the following year.<br>
<br>Both editions were printed and bound to an unusually high standard for a longitude proposal and included a large fold-out chart summarizing the scheme. Their leather bindings, featuring star symbols invented by the author, may have been the first in England to be decorated with symbols specific to the text  (Miller, 10&#150;11). Squire's <span class="italic">Proposal</span> attracted much attention, given her gender and the quality of the volumes. The work prompted praise for its author's learning and dedication, as well as confusion&#151;as when the poet Elizabeth Carter complained to Catherine Talbot of the book's incomprehensibility:<blockquote>I am told the project is thought ingenious, and if you should happen to be of that opinion, 'tis ten to one but I may take up the book again, which I have at present thrown by in a great rage (at my own stupidity) and study myself half mad to find out the meaning of it. (Elizabeth Carter to Catherine Talbot, 13 July 1743, <span class="italic">Series of Letters</span>, 1.35)</blockquote>Squire died, unmarried, in London on 4 April 1743 shortly after the publication of the second edition of her <span class="italic">Proposal</span>. Despite her wish to be buried at St Pancras, her funeral took place on 7 April at St Marylebone, &#145;attended only with a Hearse and one Coach; which was the more surprising, as she was nearly related to the Chief Nobility and Gentry of this Kingdom&#146;  (<span class="italic">Daily Post</span>, 13 April 1743). An obituary notice in the <span class="italic">Daily Post</span> commended her as &#145;a Lady excellently well vers'd in Astronomy, Philosophy, and most Parts of polite Literature [who] led a most moral Life, and was often more charitable than her Circumstances would permit&#146;.<br>
<br>A copy of the <span class="italic">Proposal</span> was sent to the court of Pope Benedict XIV, either by Squire or by another person shortly after her death. The pope sought the opinion of the Bologna Academy of Sciences whose members, unaware of Squire's death, advised Benedict not to fund the scheme but to inform its author of his support for women's participation in the mathematical sciences. Squire herself remained committed to her proposal. Her will directed that, after payment of her debts, sums of &pound;1000 each were to be left to a maternal relative and to three friends &#145;out of the premium or reward I look on my Self Intitled to for the Method for discovering the Longitude&#146;  (Sheff. Arch., CWM/1400).<br>
