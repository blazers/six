<span class="headword">Bowles,  John</span>  (1751&#150;1819), <span class="occ">barrister and author</span>, was the son of John Bowles, a printseller in Cornhill in the City of London. He is said to have received a bachelor of laws degree from the University of Douai on 25 March 1779 and to have been licensed by the same university on 11 May 1781. While he was reading for the bar he often attended the Robin Hood Debating Society in London with his friend John Taylor, where he was a well-respected speaker. Bowles later also practised as a magistrate in Surrey. He married but his wife's identity remains unknown.<br>
<br>Bowles wrote at least thirty-three pamphlets between 1791 and 1817, most notably and prolifically on the subject of the British wars against revolutionary France. He produced sixteen pamphlets on this conflict, including <span class="italic">The Real Grounds of the Present War with France</span> (1793), and he also wrote for the <span class="italic">Anti-Jacobin Review</span>. He was a committee member and leading pamphleteer for the Crown and Anchor Loyal Association, and from 1792 he received government secret service pay for his efforts. He was also made a commissioner of bankrupts, and in 1795 he was appointed a commissioner for the sale of Dutch prize ships. By the mid-1790s, when his writing career was at its height, he had abandoned the legal profession. Despite his various emoluments, his opinions on the war went beyond those of mainstream loyalism, which generally supported the government through thick and thin, and he urged instead a more hardline, Burkean war strategy; that is to say, he was convinced that no peace could be had until revolutionary principles were extinguished in France itself. These views drew him into friendship with men such as John Reeves, John Gifford, William Windham, and William Cobbett. His other writings dealt with such matters as the freedom or restraint of the press, morality, the education of the poor, savings banks, temperance, and the authority of the Church of England.<br>
<br>Bowles's fierce anti-Jacobinism was partly driven by his belief that religious and moral degeneracy were at the root of Britain's political and social troubles. By 1804, when he revised the 1801 edition of his <span class="italic">Reflections on the Moral and Political State of Society at the Close of the Eighteenth Century</span>, he explicitly declared Britain's moral danger to be greater than that posed by a French invasion. One of the circle of high-churchmen surrounding Joshua Watson and the developing &#145;Hackney Phalanx&#146;, Bowles was briefly, in 1802, a member of the Proclamation Society. Within a year of its foundation (also in 1802) he joined the Society for the Suppression of Vice, and until 1809 he was probably its most active executive member. He led the group within the society which supported the obtaining of evidence against, for example, traders in obscene literature, using somewhat dubious means; this policy led to the alienation of William Wilberforce and other evangelicals from the society's activities.<br>
<br>The controversy over the society's activities was compounded in 1809 by the scandal which surrounded Bowles and the other four Dutch prize commissioners. Allegations of fraud were brought against them in the House of Commons, as part of the anti-corruption drive of the later years of the war which centred around the accusation that the duke of York's mistress had sold army promotions. The commissioners' case was eventually decided against them in the court of exchequer in May 1819. During the ten intervening years Bowles continued to be energetic in public work, such as the foundation, in 1811, of the National Society for the Education of the Poor, but now less conspicuously. He was intensely loyal to his friends although he lost a number of them through his aggressive moralism and his disgrace after 1809. Bowles died on 30 October 1819 at Bath, and a tablet was placed in his memory in the abbey church there. He was survived by his wife.<br>
