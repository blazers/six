<span class="headword">Sibthorp,  John</span>  (1758&#150;1796), <span class="occ">botanist</span>, was born in Oxford on 28 October 1758, the only son of Humphrey Sibthorp (1713?&#150;1797), Sherardian professor of botany at Oxford, and his second wife, Elizabeth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Gibbes (<i>d</i>. 1780). The elder Sibthorp, a fellow of Magdalen College, Oxford, in 1734&#150;44, took his MB in 1743 and his MD in 1745. Tradition has it that as holder of the Sherardian chair from 1747 to 1783 he presented but one lecture, which was not a notable success. He was said to have done more for botany by raising his son than through any research or writing of his own. Linnaeus, one of the senior Sibthorp's botanical correspondents, named <i>Sibthorpia europaea</i> (Cornish moneywort), a small creeping plant with tiny flowers, after him.<br>
<br>John Sibthorp attended Magdalen College School and Lincoln grammar school, and went on to Lincoln College, Oxford, where he earned his BA in 1777 when he was nineteen. He studied medicine for a year (1778&#150;9) at the University of Edinburgh and took his MA at Oxford in 1780. His mother died in 1780, leaving him a considerable legacy which took the form of a substantial allowance from his father. During the year 1781&#150;2 Sibthorp studied botany with Antoine Laurent de Jussieu at the Jardin des Plantes in Paris. This was followed by ten months of further botanical study with Auguste Brissonet at Montpellier University. On his return to Oxford in October 1783 he received a &pound;300 a year Radcliffe travelling fellowship. Two months later his father, who had earlier inherited property from an older brother in Canwick, Lincolnshire, resigned his chair in his son's favour. Sibthorp took his MD at Oxford in January 1784, and in March, aged twenty-five, was named Sherardian professor. It is not known whether there were other aspirants for this position. In that year he attempted to buy the library and collections of Linnaeus for Oxford, but his friend, the botanist James Edward Smith (1759&#150;1828), outbid him; these materials later went to the Linnean Society of London.<br>
<br>Having no immediate desire to teach, Sibthorp turned his instructional responsibilities over to George Shaw (1751&#150;1813), the very capable departmental lecturer, later keeper of the natural history section at the British Museum. Sibthorp spent the winter of 1784&#150;5 studying at G&ouml;ttingen, and the summer of 1785 herborizing (Sibthorp's term) in Germany. In the autumn of 1785, while working with Nikolaus Joseph von Jacquin in Vienna, he was shown a fifth-century copy (now in the Botany School Library at Oxford) of the <span class="italic">Materia medica</span> of Pedacius Dioscorides, a first-century Greek army surgeon. Sibthorp decided to study the Greek flora, identify all 700 plants mentioned by Dioscorides, and ascertain their medicinal value. He taught himself modern Greek so that he could converse with local residents concerning plant life. With the Austrian Ferdinand Bauer (1760&#150;1826), who became one of the greatest botanical artists of all time, he visited Cyprus, Crete, Athens, mounts Parnassus and Athos, Salonika, many of the Greek islands, Izmir, and Bithynia between March 1786 and September 1787. Uncertain political conditions, the threat of war in the region, and the onset of plague in Thessaly precluded Sibthorp's travelling through the Greek mainland. He returned to England with some 2000 plants, together with many mammal, bird, and fish specimens. During the period from 1787 to 1794, he lectured according to the advanced taxonomic principles of Linnaeus, added many specimens to the Sherardian herbarium, and completed his father's catalogue of the university's botanical garden. There were insufficient funds to improve the garden, but he did some planting, exchanging some specimens with Kew Gardens. He published <span class="italic">Flora Oxoniensis</span> (1794), a student's guide describing some 1200 plant species of Oxfordshire, and cared for an estate he had purchased at South Leigh, outside Oxford. One of the founding members of the Linnean Society of London in 1788, he was named a fellow. In that same year, he also was elected a fellow of the Royal Society. Although Sibthorp periodically suffered from malaria, contracted on his first Greek expedition, he was determined to return for additional specimens for a projected <span class="italic">Flora Graeca</span>. Since Bauer would not accompany him (Sibthorp treated Bauer as a servant, which the younger man bitterly resented) Sibthorp left England in March 1794 with Francis Barone, a congenial young botanical assistant. They took two months to reach Constantinople overland; having arrived there exhausted and ill, Sibthorp was obliged to spend the summer recovering from his journey, after which they moved on to Athens. Barone was killed in an accident there while sleepwalking in their quarters, but Sibthorp was joined by an English friend, John Hawkins (1758&#150;1841). The two men spent the autumn of 1794 visiting Troy and Athens before overwintering on the island of Zakinthos. March and April 1795 were spent botanizing in the south central Peloponnese.<br>
<br>Sibthorp set sail for England at the beginning of May while Hawkins remained in Greece, but his trip was arduous in the extreme. Sibthorp was obliged to spend two miserable weeks in a small Adriatic island hut owing to violent storms. He had begun his trip with a bad cold and fever, which grew worse and was complicated by dysentery. After landing in central Italy he completed his journey home by road, but on arrival in England in July he was suffering from tuberculosis. He survived six months, dying, unmarried, at Bath, Somerset, on 8 February 1796 at the age of thirty-seven. He was buried in Bath Abbey. His plant collections, including the 3000 species upon which the <span class="italic">Flora Graeca</span> was later based, are still retained at Oxford. Much of his correspondence, which had been kept by his father and then his sister, Lady Sewell, was sold as waste paper following the death of the latter.<br>
<br>In his will Sibthorp left his estate to Oxford University, but directed that his three executors, Hawkins, Thomas Platt, and the Hon. Thomas Wenman, arrange for the completion of the <span class="italic">Flora Graeca</span>. With the aid of Sir Joseph Banks, Smith was engaged, at a salary of &pound;150 per annum, to draft the text of the <span class="italic">Flora</span>, and was expected to finish this task within eleven years. Smith began working in 1799 but his assignment was still incomplete when he died in 1828 after twenty-nine years' labour. The entire task ultimately consumed more than forty years. Sibthorp's handwriting was execrable, he had not completed the correlation of his field notes with his specimens, and some of the latter were not labelled. Hawkins would in 1800 commiserate with Smith by writing, &#145;it is certainly a pity that Dr. Sibthorp did not mark all his specimens, but he trusted to his memory and dreamed not of dying&#146;  (Stearn, &#145;Sibthorp, Smith&#146;, 170). Smith completed six lavishly illustrated volumes and part of the seventh (published 1806&#150;32) before his death. The remainder of the seventh and the final three volumes, which appeared between 1832 and 1840, were authored by the botanist John Lindley (1799&#150;1865). All volumes were published in two fascicles. The faithful Hawkins, who with his surviving co-executor Platt had loyally carried out his deceased friend's charge since 1796, died early in 1841. No less faithful was Ferdinand Bauer, who, despite his treatment by the cosmopolitan and erudite Sibthorp, completed all the illustrations for <span class="italic">Flora Graeca</span>. Only twenty-five sets of <span class="italic">Flora Graeca</span>, containing 966 plates, were finally published by the Oxford University Press, at a cost of &pound;620 each. These were sold to subscribers for &pound;239 8<i>s</i>. Sibthorp's estate made up the deficit of more than &pound;9000. The publisher Henry Bohn later bought the remaining oddments of text and plates from the University Press, reprinted what was missing, and produced another forty sets in 1845 and 1846, which he sold for &pound;63 apiece. No more were printed. The overburdened Smith also produced a four-part <span class="italic">Florae Gracae prodromus</span>, without illustrations, which appeared in two volumes between 1806 and 1816. Sibthorp willed that on completion of <span class="italic">Flora Graeca</span> the balance of his estate should endow a Sibthorpian chair of rural economy to be held by the professor of botany. Only the additional stipend (&pound;200) would secure a dedicated botanist for the university. The prospect induced Charles Daubeny to seek the botany chair in 1834, and he became first Sibthorpian professor in 1840.<br>
