<span class="headword">Marshall <span class="st"> [Martial]</span>,  Richard</span>  (<em>b. </em>1517, <em>d.</em> in or after 1575), <span class="occ">dean of Christ Church, Oxford, and Roman Catholic priest</span>, was born in Kent, probably the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18153/', "William Marshall (d. 1540?)")</script>, the anti-Catholic polemicist. He entered Corpus Christi College, Oxford, in 1532, and was a probationary fellow from 1538 to 1540. He was one of a group of younger members of the college (called &#145;neo-Christiani&#146; by their seniors) who supported Henrician religious policy, and in 1538 he caused offence by striking out the word &#145;papa&#146; from the library's edition of the works of St Gregory: in 1535 the government had ordered the removal of the word from all service books, and college conservatives complained that the instruction did not apply to &#145;profane books&#146;  (<span class="italic">Miscellaneous Writings</span>, 382). He was in trouble in 1539 for breaking the prohibition on eating meat in Lent.<br>
<br>Marshall took his BA degree in 1537 and MA in 1540, but was in financial difficulties: in 1539 he asked Thomas Cromwell for assistance, reporting that his father could no longer afford to support him and enclosing his own Latin poem on adversity, &#145;Sustine et abstine&#146;. Marshall was given an exhibition funded by the new Westminster Cathedral. In 1545 the exhibition was switched to the embryonic Christ Church, and at the foundation of the college in 1546 he was elected a senior &#145;student&#146; (or fellow). He proceeded BD in 1544 and DD in 1552; he seems to have been a popular tutor, with six pupils in 1550. He was elected vice-chancellor of Oxford in October 1552, and is said to have been a reformer under Edward VI, but at some point he must have shown Catholic sympathies, and his career took off under Mary. He became chaplain to the earl of Arundel, dean of Christ Church, on 14 September 1553, canon of Winchester and then St Paul's, vicar of Pyrton, Oxfordshire, and rector of Westbourne, Sussex (an Arundel living). He served as vice-chancellor in 1554 and 1555: he presided at the Oxford disputation against Thomas Cranmer, Nicholas Ridley, and Hugh Latimer; appeared as a witness at Cranmer's trial; took part in the degradation of Ridley; and, as a commissioner at the burning of Ridley and Latimer on 16 October 1555, silenced Ridley's attempt to respond to the official preacher. Little is known of his rule at Christ Church, the Marian records of the house having been removed by Anthony Wood. He was described by a college contemporary as &#145;parum sobrius et furiosus&#146; (&#145;a raging drunkard&#146;; Calfhill, sig. A3), and it was said that Marshall &#145;regnavit tyrannice&#146; (&#145;ruled tyrannically&#146;; Humphrey, 81). Within a year he had provoked disobedience from the senior students of Christ Church. Later, on the orders of Cardinal Pole, he had the body of Peter Martyr's wife removed from her grave in the cathedral, and apparently reburied it in the deanery dunghill&#151;an event which brought opprobrium later.<br>
<br>The accession of Elizabeth brought an end to Marshall's promising ecclesiastical career: he refused to recognize the authority of the royal visitors, and was deprived or forced to resign as dean by May 1559. Marshall then became an underground Catholic priest in the north of England, and stayed for a time with the earl of Cumberland and with Christopher Metcalf in Wensleydale. At some point he was arrested, and, on the orders of the privy council, sent to confer with Bishop Grindal: he was persuaded to subscribe to the <span class="roman">Thirty-Nine Articles</span>, probably on 21 December 1563. Earlier authorities (including the <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span>) declare that he died in prison in 1563: he did not. Presumably his subscription secured release, and by 1568 he was again operating as a Catholic priest, in Lancashire. In February 1568 the sheriff of Lancashire was instructed to seek out a number of recusant priests working in the area, including &#145;Marshall, once dean of Christ Church in Oxford&#146;, and from 1568 to 1570 &#145;Marshall alias Bradfield&#146; was listed among the priests. His name disappears from these lists in 1571; he seems to have gone into exile at Louvain, and to have moved to Douai by 1575. He probably died soon after.<br>
<br>Marshall was castigated by Lawrence Humphrey in 1573 as &#145;homo versipellis&#146; (&#145;a chameleon&#146;), and was later condemned as the turncoat dean who went from Romanist to reformer to Romanist to reformer. In fact, his public sympathies under Edward VI followed naturally from his youthful radicalism and, except for his subscription under pressure, he was a consistent Catholic from 1553. Marshall changed his adult religion only once, less than most of his contemporaries. He might have become an academic elder statesman, an Oxford Andrew Perne: instead, and perhaps surprisingly, he sacrificed his career for a secret pastorate and exile.<br>
