<span class="headword">Seddon,  Felix John Vaughan</span>  (1798&#150;1865), <span class="occ">orientalist</span>, was a younger son among the fourteen children of William Seddon (1756/7&#150;1808), attorney in Manchester, and his wife, Penelope, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Watson. He was probably born at his parents' residence in Pendleton, and was educated at Manchester grammar school from 1806. In 1815 he went to India in the service of the East India Company, and while there devoted himself to the study of oriental languages, particularly Persian and Hindustani. After passing the revenue board examinations he was in 1820 appointed registrar of Rangpur, Bengal, where he familiarized himself with Bengali and Sanskrit. At the outbreak of the First Anglo-Burmese War, in 1824, he accompanied the army to Assam as translator and accountant to the governor-general's agent on the north-eastern frontier. He was chosen because of his ability, through the medium of Sanskrit, to acquire the local languages, especially Manipuri, which he was the first European to learn. He translated the articles of war and artillery exercise for use of the Manipuri levy, and prepared a grammar and dictionary of Assamese. In 1830 failing health forced him to return to England and abandon his work on a comparative dictionary of Manipuri, Thai, and Burmese.<br>
<br>On 12 July 1833 Seddon was elected professor of oriental languages at King's College, London, and in 1835 published <span class="italic">An Address Delivered in King's College &hellip; on the Languages and Literature of Asia</span>. He also assisted in translating the <span class="roman">Bible</span> into some Eastern languages. In 1837 he returned to India, intending to found a college at Lucknow, with the support of William IV, but when he arrived there he found that the king of Oudh was dead, and his successor was opposed to the plan. This and other difficulties obliged him to abandon the undertaking. He was afterwards appointed preceptor to the titular nawab of Bengal. The latter part of his life was spent at Murshidabad, Bengal, where he died, unmarried, on 25 November 1865.<br>
