<span class="headword">Castrucci,  Pietro</span>  (1679&#150;1752), <span class="occ">violinist and composer</span>, was born in Rome, the elder of the two known children of Domenico Castrucci (<i>d</i>. in or after 1709). Details of his early life are scarce, but his father was a violinist, and together they were in the employment of Francesco, Marchese Ruspoli, during Handel's periodic visits to Rome (<i>c</i>.1707&#150;9). Together with his younger brother, the violinist Prospero Castrucci (1690?&#150;1760), Castrucci was a pupil of Archangelo Corelli. Richard Boyle, third earl of Burlington, another Corelli pupil and an English patron of Handel, took the brothers to London. From their arrival in May 1715 until 1721 or later, they resided at his home in Piccadilly.<br>
<br>At his first public appearance in London (23 July 1715) Castrucci performed &#145;several Solos on the Violin, intirely New&#146;  (Avery, 1.363). By 1716 he had become a member of the orchestra at the King's Theatre, Haymarket. In 1718 Castrucci became leader of the newly established Royal Academy of Music, a post in which he remained until 1737. Handel became &#145;master of the orchestra&#146; in November 1719, and many of his subsequent works featured the Castrucci brothers prominently. The operas <span class="italic">Sosarme</span> (1732), <span class="italic">Ezio</span> (1732), and <span class="italic">Orlando</span> (1733), together with the oratorio <span class="italic">Deborah</span> (1733), all indicate the involvement of an instrument called the <i>violetta marina</i>. This was probably a viola d'amore with sympathetic strings like that described by Leopold Mozart as an &#145;English violet&#146;  (Mozart, 12). Burney suggests that Castrucci invented this instrument, first playing it at his own benefit concert in 1732. Desirous of making an impression, Castrucci often included novelty attractions at his benefits. On 26 February 1731, for example, he advertised his intention to execute &#145;twenty-four notes with one bow&#146;  (Burney, <span class="italic">Hist. mus.</span>, 2.770), probably in the giga of his sonata op. 2 no. 2. This was parodied the following day in an advertisement which suggested that a solo would be played by &#145;the last violin of Goodman's Field's playhouse&#146; including &#145;twenty-five notes with one bow&#146;  (ibid.).<br>
<br>Most contemporary commentators speak favourably of Castrucci's playing. Sir John Clerk of Penicuik, who attended the last night of <span class="italic">Orlando</span> on 5 May 1733, noted that the violins &#145;made a terrible noise &amp; often drown'd the voices&#146;, but singled out the Castrucci brothers &#145;who play'd with great dexterity&#146;  (Dean and Knapp, 33). Sir John Hawkins likewise thought Castrucci &#145;an excellent performer on the violin&#146;  (Hawkins, 891), but Burney suggests that &#145;he was long thought insane &hellip; his compositions were too mad for his own age&#146;, but &#145;too sober for the present&#146;  (Burney, <span class="italic">Hist. mus.</span>, 2.1004). Burney's ascription of Castrucci as the subject of Hogarth's <span class="italic">Enraged Musician</span> is now considered unlikely by Hogarth experts, and the subject is more likely to be the German oboist and flautist John Festing although this identification has also been questioned.<br>
<br>Castrucci was extremely active outside the opera, performing frequently at various London concert venues and theatres. However, anecdotal accounts of his later years suggest that his playing declined significantly. In 1737 Handel seemingly decided to replace him as leader of the opera orchestra, Castrucci's reluctance leading Handel to devise a scheme to shame him into resignation:<blockquote>Handel &hellip; composed a concerto, in which the second concertino was contrived, as to require an equal degree of execution with the first; this he gave to Clegg, who in the performance of it gave such proofs of his superiority, as reduced Castrucci to the necessity of yielding the palm to his rival. (Hawkins, 891)</blockquote>This dismissal did not signal the end of his career, and on 28 August 1739 Castrucci became one of the original subscribers to the Royal Society of Musicians. Little is known of his activities during the 1740s, although he advertised a yearly benefit concert in the <span class="italic">General Advertiser</span> for 30 March 1748.<br>
<br>Burney observed &#145;that among the many passages of Corelli and Handel&#146; in Castrucci's compositions, there are &#145;several of his own&#146;, but qualified this caustic comment with the statement that they nevertheless show Castrucci &#145;to have been a man of genius, well acquainted with the bow and finger-board of his instrument&#146;  (Burney, <span class="italic">Hist. mus.</span>, 2.1004). In collaboration with his friend Francesco Geminiani, a fellow Roman and pupil of Corelli, Castrucci produced <span class="italic">Six Sonatas or Solos &hellip; for a Flute and a Bass</span> (<i>c</i>.1720), of which he probably wrote the first four. His other significant extant published works include two further sets of twelve violin sonatas and a set of twelve concerti grossi which Hawkins described as &#145;hardly known&#146; but having &#145;great merit&#146;  (Hawkins, 891). Castrucci's op. 1 sonatas, dedicated to his patron Lord Burlington, are remarkably similar to, but much shorter than, Corelli's op. 5 sonatas, and together with op. 2 call for a number of extended techniques including <i>bariolage</i>, multiple stops, scordatura tunings, and &#145;battute&#146;. Many of the movements also have descriptive titles, such as &#145;Venetiana&#146;, &#145;Commodo alla francese&#146;, or &#145;Corni da cacci&#146;. The concerti grossi op. 3 are much more simplistic, bearing a close resemblance to those by Geminiani. Some of Castrucci's music manuscripts are in the British Library and the Gesellschaft der Musikfreunde, Vienna.<br>
<br>In 1750 Castrucci went to Dublin, where he appeared at the Charitable Musical Society at the Fishamble Street Music Hall on 5 October. Two of his concertos were performed at the Philharmonic Society later that year, and he held a benefit concert on 21 February 1751. He died in Dublin between 7 February and 7 March 1752, probably of natural causes. His funeral took place on 10 March at St Mary's Church, Dublin, and despite his extreme poverty, it was a magnificent event. <span class="italic">Faulkner's Journal</span> reported that his cort&egrave;ge included &#145;the whole Band of Musick from the New Gardens in Great Britain St., who will perform the Dead March in Saul, composed by Mr Handel&#146;  (Highfill, Burnim &amp; Langhans, <span class="italic">BDA</span>, 3.105). He was buried in St Mary's.<br>
