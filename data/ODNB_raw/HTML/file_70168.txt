<span class="headword">Sowle,  Andrew</span>  (1628&#150;1695), <span class="occ">printer</span>, was the son of Francis Sowle, yeoman of the parish of St Sepulchre, London. From 1646 to 1653 he was apprenticed to Ruth Raworth, a widow who was known for printing radical and reforming works. Some time before 1655 he married a woman named <a href="#cosubject_70168">Jane [<i>see below</i>]</a>, whose maiden name is not known. The couple had at least ten children, but only three daughters are known to have lived to adulthood; all three of these daughters became Quaker printers in their own right. Jane, the eldest daughter (<i>bap</i>. 6 August 1655), married Jonas Hinde of Shoreditch in 1679. After Hinde died she married John Bradford, a family apprentice, and set up as a printer, managing the business after Bradford's death. Elizabeth Sowle married another family apprentice, William Bradford, in 1685, and emigrated with him to Pennsylvania, where they became the first Quaker printers in the American colonies. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/67077/', "Tace Sowle")</script>, born on 29 March 1666, succeeded her father as head of the Sowle press in 1691.<br>
<br>While Andrew Sowle began printing for the Quakers some time before the Restoration, the details of his early activities are not known. Early Quaker publications were perceived as posing a serious threat to the social order, and printers rarely showed their name in imprints. Sowle's name does not appear in imprints before 1680. From that year until 1690 imprints show that he retailed works at his home in Shoreditch &#145;at the sign of the Crooked Billet&#146; and also at &#145;Devonshire New Buildings&#146; near Bishopsgate Street, the site of the first public Quaker meetings in London. In 1687 he added a third outlet in Gracechurch Street, near the main Quaker meeting-house. The papers of Quaker leader William Penn, however, reveal that Sowle was printing for the Society of Friends on a regular basis by 1672, and in 1674 minutes of the Quaker morning meeting name him as one of their official printers. Sowle managed to hide his press from government authorities until 1678. His name is conspicuously absent from a government list  (&#145;List of the severall printing houses taken the 24 of July 1668&#146;, TNA: PRO, SP 29/243/126) and, seven years later, &#145;Andrew Sole a Quaker&#146; is recorded in &#145;A list of the several printing-houses taken the 29th of March 1675&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 29/369/97) but the location of his press is not recorded. In 1678 the warden of the Stationers' Company, Thomas Vere, searched Sowle's residence in Shoreditch and discovered there &#145;a Private Printing Press &hellip; in two upper Rooms to which there was no passage but through Trapp-doores to it&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 29/403/59, 19 April 1678). Sowle was charged with illegal printing at the Middlesex sessions, but on 9 December a jury declared him not guilty.<br>
<br>As a printer of nonconformist literature Sowle suffered severe treatment and losses at the hands of government agents. In a testimony of 1701 concerning Sowle in <span class="italic">Piety Promoted, in a Collection of the Dying Sayings of many of the People called Quakers</span>, William Penn records how his friend &#145;freely gave himself up to the service&#146; of the Quaker movement:<blockquote>even in times of the hottest persecution, believing it his duty so to do, though therein he should hazard not only his life but also that outward substance God had blessed him with: being for several years together in continual danger upon that account. (Tomkins, 121)</blockquote>Early in his career, in 1664, Sowle was arrested under the <span class="roman">Conventicle Act</span>. Upon learning that Sowle was a printer Alderman Sir Richard Browne is reputed to have threatened to send him to the same fate as &#145;his brother Twyn&#146;, the printer John Twyn executed that year for treason  (Hetet, 143).<br>
<br>In 1691 Tace Sowle succeeded her father, and from this date on her name replaces his in imprints. On 26 December 1695 Andrew Sowle died at his home in Holloway Lane, Shoreditch, from consumption, attended by William Penn. He was buried at Checker Alley, London. His will leaves small sums to his daughters Jane Bradford and Elizabeth Bradford and their children, and designates his unmarried daughter, Tace, and wife, Jane, joint executors and residuary legatees of his modest estate.<br>
<br>The Sowle press was the primary channel through which early Quaker works were published, and Andrew Sowle printed works by nearly all of the founders of Quakerism, including authors such as George Fox, Robert Barclay, George Whitehead, Isaac Penington, and William Penn. (Sowle is estimated, for instance, to have printed more than 90 per cent of Penn's works.) During the eleven years that his name appears in imprints Sowle published well over eighty works for the Friends. The Quakers also relied on the Sowles to organize the distribution of their publications; in this regard, the Sowle press is an important exception to the rule in this period that printing houses generally did not retail their own products. From its beginnings some time near the Restoration until 1829 when it can no longer be traced under any variation of name, this unique publishing operation flourished not only in London but also, through the Bradford connection, in America.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_70168"></a><span class="headword">Jane Sowle</span>  (<em>c.</em>1631&#150;1711)<span class="occ"></span> played a key role in the Sowle press both during her marriage to Andrew and for sixteen years after his death. While Tace Sowle officially succeeded her father, Jane remained an important force in the family business. When Tace eventually married in 1706 she ensured that her mother would retain command of her house. At the age of seventy-four Jane Sowle became the nominal head of the business, and imprints after this date read &#145;J. Sowle&#146;. Even after Jane died at Clapton, Hackney, on 18 June 1711, aged about eighty, Tace (now Tace Raylton) continued to use her mother's name in imprints. From 1711 to 1735 imprints show &#145;assigns of J. Sowle&#146; (that is, Tace). Jane Sowle is also remembered for having contributed a testimony to the collectively authored <span class="italic">Piety Promoted by Faithfulness &hellip; Concerning Ann Whitehead</span> (1686). She was buried at Bunhill Fields, London, two days after her death.<br>
