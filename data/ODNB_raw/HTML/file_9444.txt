<span class="headword">Finch,  William</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1613), <span class="occ">merchant</span>, was a native of London and a servant to Master Johnson in Cheapside. He was agent to an expedition sent in 1607 by the East India Company, under captains Hawkins and Keeling, to treat with the Mughal emperor of India, Jehanghir, known to the English as the great Mughal. On 24 August 1608 Hawkins and Finch landed at Surat in the <i>Hector</i>, the first vessel to display the English flag on the Indian coast. Although they were violently opposed by the Portuguese, Finch obtained permission to dispose of the goods they had brought, even though the natives, under Portuguese incitement, were chary of dealing with the English. Finch, ill with the flux, remained in Surat, and Hawkins proceeded to Agra alone. In a letter of 12 July 1609 Finch gave Hawkins an accurate, if cautious, estimate of the capacity of the Indian market in commodities such as broadcloths, kerseys, quicksilver, tin, ivory, coral, and sword blades. He also listed the Indian cloths that would yield most profit in the markets of the Levant and the Barbary coast, and be of use in England for fine quilts and wall hangings.<br>
<br>Finch joined Hawkins at Agra on 14 April 1610, but refused tempting offers to attach himself permanently to the service of Jehanghir. For at least six months (February&#150;August 1610) Finch was in Lahore, a city second only to Agra in importance in the Mughal empire. Then, on an expedition to Bayana later in the same year, he dared to outbid the agent of the emperor's mother for a supply of indigo, so compromising Hawkins's position at the Mughal court. The two men quarrelled, and Hawkins confiscated the indigo which Finch wanted to move by caravan to Aleppo. Finch, disillusioned about the possibility of establishing English trade in India, decided to return to England and made his way overland to Baghdad, where he died in August 1613 from drinking infected water. His journal was later forwarded to the East India Company and was printed by Purchas; it gave valuable descriptions of Agra and the routes from Agra to Surat and from Lahore to Kabul and Srinagar, gleaned from his own travels or from diligent enquiry of others.<br>
