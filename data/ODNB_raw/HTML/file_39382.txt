<span class="headword">Soldene,  Emily</span> <span class="st"> [<em>performing name </em>Miss FitzHenry]</span>  (1838?&#150;1912), <span class="occ">singer and theatre manager</span>, was allegedly born in Clerkenwell on 30 September 1838, and was brought up as the daughter of Edward Fuller Solden (1805&#150;1873) and his apparently bigamous wife, Priscilla, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Swain (1812&#150;1900). She married law clerk John Powell (1834?&#150;1881) on 17 March 1859, and was a mother before she began to study singing (1861) with William Howard Glover. She made her first public appearance in a concert given by Glover in 1862, and her professional d&eacute;but, performing operatic selections and mezzo-soprano ballads at the Oxford Music Hall under the name Miss FitzHenry, in 1863. Miss FitzHenry established herself as one of the outstanding vocalists of the 1860s music halls, and Miss Soldene's classical career was allowed to fade away.<br>
<br>In 1869, with the first vernacular productions of French <i>op&eacute;ra bouffe</i> being mounted in England, attractive actresses who could combine sophisticated comedy and vocal talents of an operatic level were at a premium, and Miss FitzHenry was hired from the halls by Covent Garden's John Russell to take over the star role in his tour of <span class="italic">La grande-duchesse</span>. For the occasion she returned to being Miss Emily Soldene. She scored a hit, and Miss FitzHenry was duly buried.<br>
<br>Soldene made her West End theatre d&eacute;but in 1870, playing Marguerite in Herv&eacute;'s <i>op&eacute;ra bouffe</i> <span class="italic">Le petit Faust</span>, but superstardom came only in 1871, when Charles Morton produced Offenbach's <span class="italic">Genevi&egrave;ve de Brabant</span> at the Islington Philharmonic. The show caused a sensation, the theatre became the Mecca of high society and the well-heeled theatregoer, and Emily Soldene, who played the star role of the little pastry-cook Drogan, became the toast of the London musical stage. She confirmed this success as the lusciously plotting Mlle Lange in <span class="italic">La fille de Madame Angot</span> (1873), before leading a company playing both shows, along with <span class="italic">La grande-duchesse</span>, Herv&eacute;'s <span class="italic">Chilp&eacute;ric</span>, and Offenbach's new <span class="italic">Madame l'archiduc</span>, to America (1874&#150;5) to similar triumph.<br>
<br>In the following years Soldene toured her repertory through Britain, America, and, with memorable success, New Zealand and Australia (1877&#150;8), adding, at various times, <span class="italic">Barbe-Bleue</span>, <span class="italic">La belle H&eacute;l&egrave;ne</span>, <span class="italic">Trial by Jury</span>, <span class="italic">The Waterman</span>, <span class="italic">Poulet et Poulette</span>, <span class="italic">Girofl&eacute;-Girofla</span>, <span class="italic">La P&eacute;richole</span>, and <span class="italic">La jolie parfumeuse</span> to her list of shows. On returning to Britain in 1879 she starred in three productions at the Alhambra before taking her own company on the road, memorably introducing the English-language version of Bizet's <span class="italic">Carmen</span> to the British provinces.<br>
<br>The death of Soldene's husband, an underfunded and unsuccessful third tour of America, and an ill-fated attempt to run the Gaiety Theatre, Hastings (1883), put a temporary hitch in her career, but she continued successfully and starrily to tour her hit shows, until age and embonpoint forced her to abandon the sexy sophistications of <i>op&eacute;ra bouffe</i>. She was forty-eight years old and 13 stone when she switched to playing a character role for the first time, in <span class="italic">Frivoli</span> at Drury Lane (1886). Hired out of <span class="italic">Frivoli</span> by America's top musical manager, John McCaull, she returned to America and played there in comic opera, vaudeville, variety musical, and briefly on Broadway in a self-adapted French melodrama, before settling in San Francisco, where from 1890 to 1892 she played heavy ladies in comic opera repertoire at the Tivoli and the Orpheum.<br>
<br>In 1892 Emily Soldene was persuaded to return to the scene of her 1877 triumphs, Australia, for a season, but the venture was a disaster and the underfunded singer had to look for alternative employment. An old admirer, a well-connected newspaper man, got her hired as music and drama critic on the Sydney <span class="italic">Evening News</span>, and Emily Soldene&#151;Madame, as she was fondly known to all&#151;stepped out of the theatre and into journalism. For the next seventeen years she turned out several heavily bylined weekly columns of cheerful, idiosyncratic London social chatter for the <span class="italic">Evening News</span> and later <span class="italic">The Sun</span> in a second career almost as successful as her first. She died at her lodgings, 21 Upper Woburn Place, Bloomsbury, on 8 April 1912, while her last column was in the mail to Sydney.<br>
