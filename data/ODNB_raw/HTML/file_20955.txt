<span class="headword">Ouseley, Sir  Gore</span>, first baronet  (1770&#150;1844), <span class="occ">diplomatist</span>, second son of Captain Ralph Ouseley (<i>d</i>. 1804) of Limerick, whose family had originated in Shropshire, and his first wife, Elizabeth, daughter of Henry Holland, also of Limerick, was born on 24 June 1770 at Limerick. He was educated at home with his brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20957/', "William Ouseley")</script>, and his cousin <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20954/', "Gideon Ouseley")</script>, under a tutor, Dr Robinson. His father, to whom he was attached, took an active interest in the boys' education. Ouseley was an assiduous pupil, also possessed of athletic ability.<br>
<br>In 1787 Ouseley left for India, where he busied himself in commercial affairs. By 1792 he had settled at &#145;Bygonbarree&#146; in the Dacca province of Bengal where, along the banks of the River Brahmaputra, he established a factory producing baftas (fine cloths) which were sold more cheaply than elsewhere in the province. He lived a relatively solitary existence and spent his leisure time studying Persian, Bengalese Hindi, Arabic, and Sanskrit. He became an elegant speaker and writer of Persian. In addition to his linguistic and literary pursuits he concerned himself deeply with music, an accomplishment he passed on to his son the composer <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20953/', "Frederick Arthur Gore Ouseley")</script>, and improved his skill at drawing. He made the acquaintance of the eminent orientalist Sir William James in 1794.<br>
<br>In the first years of the next century a move to Lucknow resulted in Ouseley's acquiring more insight into and experience of public and political service through his friendship with and attachment to Nawab Shuja ud-Daula, wazir of Oudh, as his major commandant and confidant. Anglo-French rivalry in India increased as a result of Napoleon's invasion of Egypt in mid-1798 when Marquess Wellesley took counter-measures to defend the British position, including a policy of subsidiary treaties with local princes. Within this strategic context, Ouseley earned Wellesley's approval for his well-judged attempts to cultivate good relations between the state of Oudh and the British power. This resulted crucially in Wellesley's later furthering of Ouseley's career. Ouseley returned to England in 1805. On 12 April 1806 he married Harriet Georgina, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29300/', "John Whitelocke")</script>, army officer. They had two sons, Wellesley Abbas Ouseley and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20953/', "Frederick Arthur Gore Ouseley")</script>, and three daughters, Mary Jane, Eliza Shirin, who died an infant, and Alexandrina Perceval. Ouseley was created baronet on 3 October 1808. In 1809, on the recommendation of Wellesley as secretary of state for foreign affairs, he was nominated <i>mehmendar</i>, guide and host to Mirza Abul Hasan, the Persian ambassador to Britain.<br>
<br>In 1810, following the British missions to Persia of John Malcolm and Harford Jones, Ouseley was appointed ambassador-extraordinary to the court of Fath Ali Shah. Accompanying Mirza Abul Hasan, Ouseley left England in July 1810 and reached Bombay before landing at Bushehr on 1 March 1811. He passed through Shiraz and Esfahan, and reached Tehran on 9 November where a treaty was signed on 14 March 1812. It had been preceded by many disagreements over etiquette and substance, but in spite of difficulties and misunderstandings Wellesley was pleased and entirely approved of Ouseley's conduct. Fath Ali Shah was no less enthusiastic and commended Ouseley to the prince regent. Ouseley received the decoration of the Lion and Sun. Because of some objections in London the treaty was not finally ratified until some further revisions had been negotiated by Meorier and Elis, the British plenipotentiaries, on 25 November 1814. There was further reciprocal respect when Ouseley met Abbas Muza, the prince royal, in Tabriz in 1812. Ouseley was instructed to use his good offices to mediate in the Perso-Russian hostilities. This culminated in the treaty of Gulistan on 13 October 1813. Ouseley left Tehran for Russia in mid-1814. He received the gratitude of the tsar, Alexander I, for his role and was honoured with the grand cordon of the order of St Alexander Nevsky.<br>
<br>Ouseley was sworn of the privy council on 10 October 1820. He enjoyed the favour of the prince regent, assisted at his coronation in 1820, and was made knight grand cross of the Royal Guelphic Order in 1831. Granted a pension of &pound;2000 a year, he retired from public life, though he was appointed high sheriff of Buckinghamshire in 1835. Thereafter he devoted himself to family affairs and his literary and antiquarian interests. He was one of those responsible for the founding of the Royal Asiatic Society in London in 1823 and was associated with the formation of the oriental translation committee, of which he was elected chairman. He became president of the Society for the Publication of Oriental Texts, formed in 1842. In later life he suffered from ill health. He died of intestinal problems at his country residence, Hall Barn Park, Beaconsfield, which he had purchased in 1832, on 18 November 1844; he was survived by his wife. The place of his burial is unknown but his wife erected a monument to him in Hertingfordbury church.<br>
<br>Ouseley was a loyal, capable, and devoted practical public servant. He was also a notable oriental scholar at a time when that subject was in its infancy and he did much to encourage its emergence through his complementary literary and archaeological interests. It was not just his linguistic skill that was remarkable: his cultural sympathy was noticeable. He was attentive to those in his service and concerned for their welfare. Conciliatory and respectful, he was prepared to stand on his dignity when the occasion demanded it. Of middle stature, he was neat and trim in appearance. His spiritual integrity and moral behaviour were accompanied by a deep respect for the Anglican church and regular religious observances. His concern both for religion and for oriental scholarship was demonstrated by the assistance he gave, while at Shiraz, to Henry Martyn, missionary and first translator of the <span class="roman">New Testament</span> into Persian.<br>
