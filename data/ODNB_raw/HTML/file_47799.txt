<span class="headword">Schloss,  David Frederick</span>  (1850&#150;1912), <span class="occ">economist and civil servant</span>, was born in West Derby, Lancashire, on 5 April 1850, the first son of Sigismund Schloss, merchant, of West Derby, and his wife, Rebecca Mocatta. He was educated at Manchester grammar school before matriculating at Corpus Christi College, Oxford, in 1869. He was one of the first Jews to be elected to a college scholarship, which he held from 1869 until 1874, when he graduated BA. His college career was illustrious: he was placed in the first class of classical moderations in 1871 and in the first class of <i>literae humaniores</i> in 1873. He was called to the bar of Lincoln's Inn in 1875. On 14 April 1886 Schloss, aged thirty-six, then resident at 17 Davies Street, Berkeley Square, London, and already established as a barrister, married Rachel Sophia Waley, aged twenty-one, at the West London Synagogue, Marylebone. She was the daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28458/', "Professor Jacob Waley")</script>. Schloss was well connected in Anglo-Jewish circles: the philanthropist F. D. Mocatta was his uncle and the banker Leonard Lionel Cohen became his brother-in-law.<br>
<br>Schloss demonstrated in intellectual and practical ways his concern for the lives of the poor of London and particularly for those of Jewish immigrants. In 1885 he printed &#145;The homes of the poor&#146; in <span class="italic">Time</span>, addressing the implications of the recent royal commission's report. In 1887 Schloss served as treasurer of the East London Tailoresses' Union and was active in the movement promoting the foundation of women's trade unions. He also supported a short-lived co-operative tailors' workshop, managed by a Mr Risenbury of Backchurch Lane. Schloss's interest in tailoring stemmed from his activities as a member of the Jewish Board of Guardians. He had regular contact with the Charity Organization Society and published several articles on &#145;sweating&#146; in the <span class="italic">Charity Organisation Review</span>.<br>
<br>In October 1887 Beatrice Potter, hoping for information about &#145;sweating practices&#146;, obtained an interview with Schloss in his role of sanitary inspector (1884&#150;1912) for the Jewish Board of Guardians. She was disappointed, although he did introduce her to the chief rabbi and his wife. Potter described Schloss as &#145;Gentleman Jew &hellip; Ugly little swarthy fellow, with loud and familiar manners and very full of his own importance but a good natured little soul&#146;  (Beatrice Potter's holograph diary, BLPES). Schloss's reluctance to help her stemmed perhaps from his own essay on &#145;The sweating system&#146; in the <span class="italic">Fortnightly Review</span> and his understandable unwillingness that she should steal his thunder. Charles Booth was sufficiently impressed to employ him to study the East End boot and shoe trades for <span class="italic">Life and Labour of the People in London</span>. Assisted by Jesse Argyle, Schloss's investigation comprised over 220 interviews, and he spent much time himself in precise observation of the workers of Mr Fox's workshop in Ogle Street. He collected a good deal of material about women's work in the trade.<br>
<br>Schloss is best described as a &#145;social radical&#146;, a member of the Fabian Society who criticized Gladstonian Liberalism and proposed in 1892 the formation of a fourth party, focusing on MPs such as R. B. Haldane and A. H. D. Acland, which was not socialist but progressive. By the early 1890s he had also established for himself a reputation as an economist whose work was based upon minute observation of carefully collected statistics. In 1893 Hubert Llewellyn Smith, a former associate of Charles Booth and commissioner for labour in the Board of Trade since 1892, appointed Schloss to a position of investigator in the labour department of the Board of Trade. In 1893 Schloss presented to the Royal Statistical Society, of which he was a fellow, a paper entitled &#145;The reorganisation of our labour department&#146;, which caused something of a stir in government circles. He produced several official reports for the department, including <span class="italic">Foreign Immigration to the USA</span> (1893), <span class="italic">Profit Sharing</span> (1894), <span class="italic">Gain-Sharing</span>, <span class="italic">Strikes and Lockouts of 1898</span>, and the <span class="italic">Report on Trade Unions in 1898</span> (1900). He was promoted to senior investigator in 1903 before becoming director of the census production office in 1907. A founder member of the London Economic Club, his highly regarded <span class="italic">Insurance Against Unemployment</span> (1909) and <span class="italic">Methods of Industrial Remuneration</span> (in its several editions from 1892) were both in use at Cambridge until the 1930s. He was also a regular and respected reviewer for the <span class="italic">Economic Journal</span>. Schloss died on 15 October 1912 at his home, 18 Hornton Court, Kensington, London, and was survived by his wife and three sons, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36684/', "(Sigismund) David Waley")</script>, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36683/', "Arthur David Waley")</script>, and Hubert David Waley (1892&#150;1968), all of whom assumed the family name of their mother in 1914.<br>
