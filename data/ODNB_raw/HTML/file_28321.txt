<span class="headword">Vines,  Richard</span>  (1597/8&#150;1651), <span class="occ">colonist in America and the West Indies</span>, was born in London. Nothing is known about his parents and very little about his early years, and his date of birth is derived from his statement that he was fifty in 1648, when he witnessed a will. Some time before 1630 Sir Ferdinando Gorges dispatched Vines to explore lands claimed by Gorges in New England. Vines lived for a time in London, where his son was born in 1626, but he had migrated to North America by the summer of 1630. He settled near the Saco River, and spent a decade and a half in Maine as an agent and deputy governor for Gorges. A leading promoter of colonization, Gorges held a series of grants from the British crown capped by a charter for the province of Maine in 1639. An operator of a trading post and a large landowner, Vines also explored the province he helped to govern. Although a frequent correspondent with Massachusetts Bay governor John Winthrop, Vines remained a conforming member of the Church of England. His biggest challenge was defending the Gorges' interests against the claims of George Cleeve, an agent for Sir Alexander Rigby, a member of parliament who had secured the title to lands within territory granted to Gorges. Because his own property was within the tract claimed by Rigby, Vines decided to leave Maine when it appeared that a parliamentary inquiry which began in 1643 would rule in Rigby's favour. Parliament did so in 1646, but by then he had sold his lands and had sailed for the English colony of Barbados. On that prosperous sugar-producing island he acquired about 50 acres. By summer 1647 he could report that he was making a profit from the cultivation of tobacco and cotton and from his medical practice. Within four years he was able to make the transition to sugar cultivation. This modestly successful planter died on the island on 19 April 1651 and was buried in St Michael's Church. His wife, Joane, and four children, named Richard, Margaret, Elizabeth, and Joan, survived him. Although he spent his last six years in the West Indies, Vines's most notable contribution was in the early development of Maine.<br>
