<span class="headword">Pickering,  Thomas</span>  (1621?&#150;1679), <span class="occ">Benedictine monk and victim of the Popish Plot</span>, was probably born in 1621 as a member of the Pickering family of the barony of Kendal in Westmorland. His father was killed during the civil wars. He made his profession as a lay brother of St Gregory's Priory, Douai, in 1660, and in 1665 was sent to London to assist his fellow monks in the royal chapel at St James's Palace provided by Charles II for his Catholic queen, Catherine of Braganza. He acted as steward and doorkeeper and when Catholic priests were banished in 1675 he, as a lay brother, was allowed to stay, presumably continuing to enjoy his generous stipend of &pound;50 per annum. He was arrested on 29 September 1678, following the accusations of Titus Oates, as being a crucial figure in the supposed Popish Plot, the man chosen to shoot the king, for which he was to have 30,000 masses said for his soul. Put on trial on 17 December 1678 along with John Grove and William Ireland, Pickering was alleged, with Grove, to have lain &#145;in wait for the King several times in <i>St James's Park</i> and other places&#146; and<blockquote>that once in particular, it had been done by <i>Pickering</i>; if it had not pleased God to have prevented it by an Accident unforeseen. The Flint of his Pistol being loose, he durst not then attempt it, though he had an Opportunity; for which neglect &hellip; he underwent the penance of 20 or 30 strokes. (<span class="italic">Tryals</span>, 12)</blockquote>Pickering was an unlikely assassin.<blockquote>His conversation was so mild and his constitution so weak and delicate that the Queen speaking of him said she did not believe in the truth of his conspiracy, since they have accused Br Pickering, for added the Queen, &#145;I should have more fear to be alone in my chamber with a mouse than with him&#146;. (Allanson, 12)</blockquote>Nevertheless he was found guilty of treason and, after being reprieved many times, was finally hanged, drawn, and quartered at Tyburn on 9 May 1679. He died with a smile on his face, claiming his innocence to the end: &#145;Is this&#146;, said he, &#145;the countenance of a man that dies under so gross a guilt?&#146;  (Allanson, 93). He was buried on the same day in the parish of St Giles-in-the-Fields and was beatified as a martyr by Pope Pius XI on 15 December 1929.<br>
