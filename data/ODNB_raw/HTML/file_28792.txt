<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Warren,  Samuel</span>  (1807&#150;1877), <span class="occ">lawyer and writer</span>, was born on 23 May 1807 near Wrexham, Denbighshire, the elder son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28791/', "Dr Samuel Warren (1781&#150;1862)")</script>, clergyman, and his first wife, Anne (1778&#150;1823), daughter of Richard and Elizabeth Williams. Little is known about Samuel Warren's early education except his statement in the preface to <span class="italic">Passages from the Diary of a Late Physician</span> that he was for six years before 1827 &#145;actively engaged in the practical study of physic&#146;  (&#145;Preface to fifth edition&#146;, edn of 1837 <span class="italic">Passages</span> in Warren, <span class="italic">Works</span>, 1854&#150;5, vol. 1), perhaps as an apothecary's apprentice. From 1826 to 1828 Warren attended the University of Edinburgh where he studied various subjects and won prizes in comparative jurisprudence and poetry, but did not obtain a degree. His poetry prize led to introductions to Christopher North (John Wilson), and to Thomas De Quincey, two of the leading lights in <span class="italic">Blackwood's Magazine</span>.<br>
<br>Warren was admitted to the Inner Temple, London, in 1828; he studied law and worked as a special pleader there until 1837, when he was called to the bar. In 1831 he had married Eliza Ballinger (<i>c</i>.1802&#150;1868); they had two sons and a daughter. This period also saw the serialization in <span class="italic">Blackwood's Magazine</span> of the work that made his literary reputation, <span class="italic">Passages from the Diary of a Late Physician</span> (1831&#150;7). He later described his views and feelings in writing the book as &#145;those not of a Novelist, but of a Moralist&#146; whose &#145;steady purpose &hellip; was to exhibit deathbeds&#146;  (&#145;Preface&#146;, 1854 edn of <span class="italic">Passages</span> in Warren, <span class="italic">Works</span>, 1854&#150;5, vol. 1). The success of the book depended on the sensational and melodramatic atmosphere of the stories which parade the horrors of debauchery, disease, madness, and death with an almost erotic fascination.<br>
<br>Warren had not restricted his writing to creative efforts during this time; he also published the first edition of <span class="italic">A Popular Introduction to Law Studies</span> (1835), a guide for those intending to become law students. In 1837 Warren, with John William Smith, published <span class="italic">Select Extracts from Blackstone's Commentaries</span>, and he was later to publish a much extended <span class="italic">Blackstone's</span> in 1855 and 1856.<br>
<br>Warren's second novel, published in <span class="italic">Blackwood's Magazine</span> from 1839 to 1841, was <span class="italic">Ten Thousand a-Year</span>. The novel, which was an immediate best-seller, concerns a firm of attorneys who discover that Tittlebat Titmouse, a poor draper's clerk, may have a claim to the large estate of Yatton. The attorneys commence an action which results in Titmouse displacing the unbelievably pious John Aubrey as the owner of the estate, and its annual income of &pound;10,000. Titmouse revels in his new found wealth, until a new round of litigation is commenced which returns Aubrey to his place as squire of Yatton. Titmouse is disgraced, and ends his life in a lunatic asylum. The narrator repeatedly tells the reader that the English legal system is close to perfection, but the actual workings of the law in <span class="italic">Ten Thousand a-Year</span> paint a more negative picture.<br>
<br>Dickens seems to have read Warren's fiction and non-fiction, and to have borrowed images and ideas. Sir Leicester Dedlock and the solicitor Vholes in <span class="italic">Bleak House</span> (1852&#150;3) resemble the earl of Dreddlington and Gammon, Titmouse's principal lawyer, in <span class="italic">Ten Thousand a-Year</span>. The striking picture of barristers in court bobbing up and down like hammers in a pianoforte in the first chapter of <span class="italic">Bleak House</span> is similar to an image in chapter nine of the second edition of <span class="italic">A Popular Introduction to Law Studies</span> (1845). Wemmick's habit of collecting mementos from Jaggers's criminal clients in <span class="italic">Great Expectations</span> parallels Quirk's practice in <span class="italic">Ten Thousand a-Year</span>. Warren may have returned the favour by using elements of the Bardell v. Pickwick case in <span class="italic">Ten Thousand a-Year</span>.<br>
<br>Warren's third novel, <span class="italic">Now and then</span> (1847), tells the story of Adam Ayliffe who is convicted unjustly of murder, although his death sentence is commuted to transportation. The novel leaps forward twenty years to reveal that Adam was innocent of the murder, and we are told by the parish priest, a character apparently incapable of irony, that the wrongful conviction resulted from &#145;the unavoidably imperfect administration of justice&#146;  (ch. 18). Much of the novel is taken up with the struggle by the priest to convince the victim's father, the proud and vengeful earl of Milverstoke, that he should show Christian mercy and forgiveness to Ayliffe. The earl (and the reader) eventually gets the point. The broader religious goal of the novel is to justify God's ways to humanity, but Warren relies on assertion and sermonizing to urge the reader to faith.<br>
<br>In 1848 Warren published a series of four lectures, originally given to students and young attorneys at the Law Society, as <span class="italic">The Moral, Social, and Professional Duties of Attorneys and Solicitors</span> (1848). The book is a mixture of ethical advice, tips on practising law, and assurances that attorneys can, with effort, learn how to behave like gentlemen. Warren assures his audience that attorneys are not inferior to barristers, although he is less egalitarian elsewhere. Other legal publications included the second and third editions of <span class="italic">Law Studies</span> (1845, 1863) and two books on election law (1852, 1853). Warren continued to practise law until the mid-1850s and became a queen's counsel in 1851, but found it difficult to attract business. He achieved some success within the Inner Temple where he was elected as a bencher in 1851.<br>
<br>Warren continued to explore philosophical and religious issues in his creative work, especially in <span class="italic">The Lily and the Bee: an Apologue of the Crystal Palace of 1851</span> (1851), <span class="italic">The Intellectual and Moral Development of the Present Age</span> (1853), and &#145;Speculators among the stars&#146; (1854). These texts are interesting as a catalogue of one religious Victorian's terrified vision of a world without Christianity: dark, amoral, determinist, animalistic, despairing, sinful, a charnel house of decayed and decaying opinions, a &#145;mental and moral shipwreck&#146;  (<span class="italic">Intellectual and Moral Development</span>).<br>
<br>William Blackwood &amp; Sons published <span class="italic">Miscellanies: Critical, Imaginative, and Juridical</span> in 1854, and a collected <span class="italic">Works</span> in five volumes in 1854 and 1855. Warren's political fidelity, as well as his writing, were recognized when he was in 1853 made an honorary DCL of the University of Oxford, with Bulwer-Lytton and others, on the occasion of Lord Derby's installation as chancellor of the university. His Conservative political sentiments led him to support the policies of Peel and later Lord Derby in a series of books and articles. In 1856 Warren was elected to the House of Commons for the borough of Midhurst (Sussex). He held the seat until 1859 when he was appointed a master in lunacy &#145;at a munificent &pound;2,000 a year stipend&#146;  (Sutherland, 660). The <span class="roman">Lunatics Acts</span> of the mid-nineteenth century empowered the masters in lunacy to make decisions about persons of unsound mind, including the management of their property. Most contemporary observers praised Warren's handling of the mastership. Warren became reader at the Inner Temple in 1865, and treasurer in 1866. He also held the judicial post of recorder of Hull from 1852 to 1874.<br>
<br>Warren's first marriage had been happy, and he was deeply affected by the loss of his wife on 29 August 1868. Some three years later, on 23 August 1871, he married Louisa Beaumont. Warren died on 29 July 1877 at his home at 16 Manchester Square, London. He was survived by his second wife, and was buried on 3 August 1877 at Christ Church, Esher, Surrey, where his son was rector.<br>
