<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Dansey, Sir  Claude Edward Marjoribanks</span>  (1876&#150;1947), <span class="occ">intelligence officer</span>, was born at 14 Cromwell Place, South Kensington, London, on 10 September 1876, the second child and eldest son in the family of four sons and five daughters of Edward Mashiter Dansey, captain and later lieutenant-colonel in the 1st Life Guards, and his wife, Eleanore, daughter of Robert Francis Gifford, second Baron Gifford. His parents removed him from Wellington College in 1891, following a diphtheria epidemic, to a school in Bruges, whence too he was removed after a homosexual scandal. In childhood he acquired fluent French, a language he often pretended hardly to speak.<br>
<br>In 1895 Dansey went to the new colony of Rhodesia and became a trooper in the Matabeleland regiment of the British South Africa police. He helped suppress the Matabele (Ndebele) uprising in 1896, and learned the elements of scouting and intelligence gathering. In 1898 he returned to England and secured a militia commission in the Lancashire Fusiliers.<br>
<br>Dansey spent ten weeks in the winter of 1899&#150;1900 with the British North Borneo Company police force as a sub-commandant, in operations against Muhammad Salleh, before rejoining his regiment in South Africa in 1900. He took part in the relief of Mafeking, was briefly a fellow-subaltern with Winston Churchill in the South African light horse, and spent the rest of the war in the field intelligence department. In 1900 he received a regular commission as lieutenant in the 6th battalion of the Lancashire Fusiliers. He stayed in South Africa, on intelligence duties, until 1904, and then spent five years in British Somaliland as a political officer, trying to counter Muhammad bin Abdullah, known as the Mad Mullah.<br>
<br>While in England on sick leave Dansey was recruited into the security branch of the secret service. He spent three years in New York state as resident secretary of the Sleepy Hollow Country Club, a rich men's recreation park on the Hudson River, whence he could keep an eye on wealthy Irish-Americans.<br>
<br>In August 1914 Dansey was recalled to England, and placed in charge of port security. He revisited the USA in 1917 to play a decisive part in helping to set up the first official American military intelligence service. He was promoted lieutenant-colonel and transferred to the Secret Intelligence Service (SIS) to unravel a disastrous muddle in the Netherlands. He next took over SIS's organization in Switzerland.<br>
<br>In 1919 the service's staff was cut back; Dansey spent most of the 1920s in private business ventures on both sides of the Atlantic. From 1929 to 1936 he was re-employed, under the cover of passport control officer, in Rome. His chief, &#145;C&#146; (Sir Hugh Sinclair), then realized that German secret police had penetrated several SIS stations. Dansey left Rome in 1936; word seeped out that he had been caught with his hand in the till and sacked. He settled into an export&#150;import office in Bush House in the Strand, and set up parallel networks of secret intelligence agents to cover the penetrated areas, using the codename Z and avoiding the use of wireless.<br>
<br>In September 1939 Z's networks amalgamated with C's, and Dansey went back to Bern. In November C died; Dansey returned to London, and became assistant chief to his friend Stewart Menzies, the new C. He was in charge of all active espionage until 1945. All the arrangements for stay-behind agents in north-west Europe collapsed, but Dansey was able to charm most of the governments in exile in London into recruiting spies.<br>
<br>Dansey was closely involved with the Special Operations Executive in its early stages&#151;Frank Nelson, its first executive head, had been a Z agent. Dansey did not seek to influence its policy, so long as it kept out of his agents' way. He often used to display there his sharp tongue, as notorious as his charm. He also kept a keen eye on MI9, the secret escape service. At the end of the war he was persuaded to retire, to Bathampton Manor, near Bath.<br>
<br>Dansey was appointed CMG in 1918 and KCMG in 1943. In 1915 he married Mrs Pauline Monroe Cory Ulman, daughter of David Cory, doctor of medicine, of New York. She separated from him in 1929 and later divorced him. His second wife, whom he married in 1945, was Mrs Frances Gurney Rylander, daughter of Dr D. F. K. Wilson. There were no children of either marriage but he had a stepdaughter from each. He died in the Lansdown Grove Hospital, Bath, on 11 June 1947.<br>
