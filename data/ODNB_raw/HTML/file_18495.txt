<span class="headword">Medhurst, Sir  Walter Henry</span>  (1822&#150;1885), <span class="occ">consul in China</span>, was born in Batavia, Java, the son of the missionary <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18494/', "Walter Henry Medhurst (1796&#150;1857)")</script> and his wife, Elizabeth Braun, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Martin (1794&#150;1874). Educated at Macau, he was appointed Chinese secretary to the British superintendent of trade in China in October 1840. Britain's consular officials in the Far East in the mid-nineteenth century generally owed more to government patronage than to their knowledge of China or the Chinese language. Almost by accident, some of the appointees turned out to be men of great ability. W. H. Medhurst was one of those few. He proved to be a capable, energetic, and willing official, who spoke with ease Dutch, Chinese, and Malay. His career spanned a crucial period in the history of China; a period which saw the gradual, though reluctant, opening of the country to Western influence. Indeed, Medhurst entered the consular service at a critical moment, just after the outbreak of the First Opium War.<br>
<br>In February 1841 Medhurst accompanied Captain George Elliot, Britain's outgoing plenipotentiary to China, to take possession of and inspect the newly acquired Hong Kong, then a small, barren island, but also the centre of opium smuggling into China. In August 1841 he joined the suite of Colonel Sir Henry Pottinger, the new plenipotentiary to China, moving north with him as the third phase of the war began. He was present when Amoy (Xiamen) was occupied at the end of the month and later, in October, when Chushan was taken. Medhurst's linguistic skills soon attracted Pottinger's attention, and he was attached to the garrison at Chushan as interpreter between October 1841 and December 1842. He was later decorated with the Opium War medal for the services he rendered to the Chushan garrison.<br>
<br>Medhurst's knowledge of Chinese continued to stand him in good stead: in October 1843 he was appointed consular interpreter at Shanghai, just after that place, along with four other ports, was first opened to foreign trade under the treaty of Nanking (Nanjing) of August 1842. He continued to serve in his new function for seven years. Having also been acting vice-consul at Amoy between 1848 and 1849, he became Chinese secretary to the British superintendency of trade in China in August 1850. In November 1854 he was promoted to the consulship at Foochow (Fuzhou) in Fukien (Fujian) province, where he remained for four years. Medhurst's next posting was to Hangchow (Hangzhou) in December 1858, though he was repeatedly left in charge of Foochow and Shanghai as well. His linguistic services were called upon again in 1861 when he was attached to the British contingent of the Anglo-French expeditionary corps at Shanghai, which was sent to China in response to the Taiping uprising.<br>
<br>Life in China was notoriously difficult for European women. Medhurst married three times. On 20 October 1847, while in London, he married the sixteen-year-old Ellen Gilbert, daughter of James Woodward Cooper; she died in China in December 1848. His second wife, whom he married in February 1854, was the daughter of the US consul in Macau; she too died after a year, in February 1855. In 1858 he married Juliana Tryphena, daughter of Henry Burningham, who survived until 1881, and with whom he had a son and two daughters.<br>
<br>In January 1864 Medhurst was transferred to Hankow (Hankou), a major treaty port on the Yangtze (Yangzi) River in Hupeh (Hubei) province. In his new post he fought staunchly for British treaty rights, and was contemptuous of Mandarin officials, but never anti-Chinese, as so many Westerners were at that time. Medhurst was one of the &#145;warrior consuls&#146;, an advocate of gunboat diplomacy, the method much preferred by Britain's minister-plenipotentiary to China, Sir Rutherford Alcock, of exerting pressure locally to solve disputes with local authorities in the absence of a strong Chinese central government. In August 1868 the minister at Peking (Beijing) dispatched Medhurst on such a mission. With four gunboats the consul sailed down the Yangtze to Nanking, the provincial capital of Kiangsu (Jiangsu), to pressurize the governor-general to cashier some Chinese officials at Yangchow (Yangzhou) who had condoned the plundering and burning of a missionary station there. Medhurst's mission was successful and compensation was duly paid; but the British government later condemned the action as rash and contrary to Britain's established China policy. None the less, later in 1868 Medhurst was sent to Shanghai as acting consul. When his posting to Shanghai was made permanent in January 1871 Medhurst had reached the peak of the Chinese consular service. Six years previously, when that same post had fallen vacant, Medhurst failed to secure promotion to the much coveted Shanghai consulship. Aggrieved, he considered resigning from the service, only to stay on after the Treasury disputed his pension rights.<br>
<br>Medhurst eventually retired from the service on 1 January 1877 on grounds of ill health, and was knighted in March of the same year. He returned to south-east Asia in 1881 to take part in the formation of the British North Borneo Company. From 1882 he resided for two years in Hong Kong to organize the emigration of Chinese labourers to the new company's territories. In 1884 Medhurst finally returned to England to live at Formosa, Torquay, where he died of apoplexy on 26 December 1885. In 1872 Medhurst had published <span class="italic">The Foreigner in Far Cathay</span>.<br>
