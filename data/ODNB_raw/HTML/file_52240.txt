<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Mackendrick,  Alexander</span>  (1912&#150;1993), <span class="occ">film director</span>, was born in Boston, Massachusetts, on 8 September 1912, the only son of Francis Robert (Frank) Mackendrick (<i>d</i>. 1918), shipbuilding draughtsman and civil engineer, and his wife, Martha, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Doig. Both parents were Scottish. His father died in the influenza epidemic of 1918, and his mother, attempting to establish a career as a dress designer, agreed to Alexander's returning to Scotland with his grandfather. He was educated at Hillhead School, Glasgow, until 1926, when his outstanding drawing talents enabled him to enrol at the Glasgow School of Art. He left in 1929 without taking his degree, and travelled to London to work for the advertising agency J. Walter Thompson. He rose to become one of the agency's top art directors, but his fascination with the cinema led him to collaborate with his cousin Roger MacDougall on a script, &#145;War on Wednesday&#146;, that was filmed in 1937 as <span class="italic">Midnight Menace</span>. For J. Walter Thompson he scripted and storyboarded five Horlicks commercials, which were filmed by the Hungarian animated film-maker George Pal. On 24 March 1934 he married Eileen Mary Ascroft (1914&#150;1962), a women's magazine journalist.<br>
<br>During the Second World War Mackendrick made propaganda films for the Ministry of Information, and in 1943 joined a psychological warfare unit headed by the future Labour minister Richard Crossman. In 1944 he was given the task of monitoring film production in Italy, giving official approval to Roberto Rossellini's <span class="italic">Rome&#151;Open City</span> (1945) and organizing documentary reportage of the uncovering of the Fosse Ardeantine massacre for <span class="italic">Giorni di gloria</span> (1945). When the war was over he spent a brief period with MacDougall making Ministry of Information documentaries and then joined <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/93789', "Ealing Studios")</script> as a scriptwriter and sketch artist. After storyboarding and co-scripting Basil Dearden's <span class="italic">Saraband for Dead Lovers</span> (1948) and Charles Crichton's <span class="italic">Another Shore</span> (1948) he was given the opportunity to direct a low-budget comedy, <span class="italic">Whisky Galore!</span> (1949), filmed on the island of Barra in 1948. The film was only modestly successful in Britain but was hugely popular in both America (as <span class="italic">Tight Little Island</span>) and France (as <span class="italic">Whisky &agrave; Gogo</span>). His first marriage having ended in divorce in 1943, Mackendrick married Hilary Lloyd (<i>b</i>. 1924/5), a film publicity worker, on Christmas eve 1948, while the success of <span class="italic">Whisky Galore!</span> was still uncertain.<br>
<br>After acting as second unit director on Basil Dearden's <span class="italic">The Blue Lamp</span> (1950) and Charles Crichton's <span class="italic">Dance Hall</span> (1950) Mackendrick began work on his second film as director, <span class="italic">The Man in the White Suit</span> (1951), based on an unperformed play by Roger MacDougall about a man who invents a material that never gets dirty and never wears out. Though it failed to emulate the international success of <span class="italic">Whisky Galore!</span> it was generally well received, and its satirical attack on the timid obscurantism of British industry contradicts the idea of Ealing comedy as cosy, nostalgic, and reassuring. Three further films followed at Ealing: <span class="italic">Mandy</span> (1952), <span class="italic">The Maggie</span> (1954), and <span class="italic">The Ladykillers</span> (1955), all projects over which Mackendrick was able to exert considerable personal control and all confirming him as a talented and original director.<br>
<br>In October 1955 Ealing Studios was sold to the BBC, and Mackendrick went to Hollywood to make an adaptation of Bernard Shaw's <span class="italic">The Devil's Disciple</span>. When casting problems delayed production he was assigned a tough New York black comedy, <span class="italic">Sweet Smell of Success</span> (1957). Putting Tony Curtis in a role that destroyed his matin&eacute;e-idol image did little for the film's commercial prospects but Mackendrick won critical admiration for his evocation of a dark, slick, sleazy world, and the reputation of the film has continued to grow. He returned to England for the filming of <span class="italic">The Devil's Disciple</span> (1959) but disagreements with the film's two leading actors, Kirk Douglas and Burt Lancaster, led to his being replaced. Further disappointment followed when he was ousted as the director of the expensive wartime epic <span class="italic">The Guns of Navarone</span> (1961). What had seemed an extremely promising career now looked in jeopardy. He was rescued by his mentor at Ealing, Michael Balcon, who entrusted him with <span class="italic">Sammy Going South</span> (1963), an ambitious Technicolor epic about a ten-year-old boy's journey through Africa from Port Said (where his parents have been killed in a British bombing raid) to Durban. The film is unique in its uncondescending picture of Africa in the last days of British colonialism, but in 1963 it seemed irrelevant to the new world of the Beatles and Mary Quant, and failed to arouse much interest.<br>
<br>After making an episode of the American television series <span class="italic">The Defenders</span> (&#145;The hidden fury&#146;, 1964) Mackendrick worked with John Osborne on a version of <span class="italic">Moll Flanders</span> and with Tony Hancock on an adaptation of Eugene Ionesco's <span class="italic">Rhinoceros</span>. Neither project prospered, but a long-standing ambition to film Richard Hughes's novel <span class="italic">A High Wind in Jamaica</span> was unexpectedly realized in 1965. Mackendrick had proved his ability to inspire fine performances from children in <span class="italic">Mandy</span>, <span class="italic">The Maggie</span>, and <span class="italic">Sammy Going South</span>, and was a natural choice for a story that centred upon a group of children being kidnapped by pirates. Unfortunately what the film's backer, Twentieth Century Fox, wanted was a Disney-like adventure story that would ignore the sinister intimations of Hughes's novel, and Mackendrick needed all his patience, guile, and persistence to make a film that remained true to the spirit of the book. Twentieth Century Fox took their revenge by cutting the film down from 135 to 103 minutes, but it remained a disturbing, significant, and visually sophisticated film.<br>
<br>Mackendrick's next&#151;and last&#151;feature film, <span class="italic">Don't Make Waves</span> (1967), also suffered from producer interference, but here the script was much weaker and Mackendrick himself regarded it as irredeemable. In 1969, after his plans for a personal and idiosyncratic version of the Mary, queen of Scots, story was aborted by the abrupt withdrawal of American financial support from British film production, he accepted the post of dean of the California Institute of the Arts film school. He remained as dean until 1978, and after stepping down continued to teach there until his death, in Los Angeles on 22 December 1993. He was survived by his wife, Hilary.<br>
<br>Mackendrick was always reluctant to regard himself as a victim, and blamed his inadequacy as deal-maker for his difficulties. He told one interviewer that:<blockquote>To spend, say 50 per cent of your time trying to get the job, and 50 per cent of your time doing the job&#151;that's a fair break. If you spend 95 per cent of your time trying to get the job, and only five per cent doing it, you're in the wrong business. (Kemp, <span class="italic">Lethal Innocence</span>, 236)</blockquote>It remains a matter of shame and regret that a director of his stature should abandon film-making. But his decision to quit meant that for over twenty years he enjoyed a second career as a teacher of film, which brought both him and his pupils immense satisfaction.The variety of Mackendrick's work and the fact that his best-loved films&#151;<span class="italic">Whisky Galore!</span> and <span class="italic">The Ladykillers</span>&#151;were comedies has militated against his being considered one of the great film directors. He himself never made the mistake of not taking comedy seriously, arguing that &#145;To be frivolous about trivial things is childish&#151;but to make fun of things that really scare you, that if you like is the basis of truth in comedy&#146;  (Kemp, &#145;Saving grace&#146;, 149). Even his most congenial comedy, <span class="italic">Whisky Galore!</span>, has a sharp edge, and the affection for the quaint and eccentric in <span class="italic">The Ladykillers</span> masks a thrillingly macabre story. Once they are set against a wider framework than that offered by Ealing, Mackendrick's comedies, together with <span class="italic">Mandy</span>, <span class="italic">The Sweet Smell of Success</span>, <span class="italic">Sammy Going South</span>, and <span class="italic">A High Wind in Jamaica</span>, can be seen as part of a body of work that is full of insight, wisdom, and humanity.<br>
