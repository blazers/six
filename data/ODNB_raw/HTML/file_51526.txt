</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Wilson,  John Burgess</span> <span class="st"> [<em>pseud. </em>Anthony Burgess]</span>  (1917&#150;1993), <span class="occ">writer and composer</span>, was born on 25 February 1917 at Carisbrook Street, Harpurhey, Manchester, the only son of Joseph Wilson (1883&#150;1938) and his wife, Elisabeth Burgess (<i>d</i>. 1919). Joe Wilson was a bookkeeper who played the piano in picture houses and pubs; his wife was Beautiful Belle Burgess of the local music-halls. Both parents came from recusant Catholic stock&#151;he Lancastrian, she Scots&#151;and they met playing the halls.<h2>
<a name="Earlylifeeducationandwarservice"></a>Early life, education, and war service</h2>Belle died of influenza in 1919; the eighteen-month-old boy was found next to her body and that of his sister, born in 1914. Joe remarried, but neither he nor his new wife, Maggie Dwyer, a publican, cared much for the child. In 1924 they gave up the pub and crossed town to run a tobacconist's shop at 21 Princess Road, Moss Side. The memory of Maggie informs the cruel muses and dominatrices who recur in Burgess's writing.<br>
<br>Although educated at Xaverian College, Manchester (1928&#150;37), and Manchester University (1937&#150;40), Burgess was self-taught in his lifelong disciplines: linguistics and music. Xaverian was a Jesuit school the purpose of which, Burgess implied many years later, was simply &#145;to get you through this world with a pass into the next&#146;  (<span class="italic">Celebration</span>, Granada Television, 1980). He lost his faith while still at school. For a &#145;cradle&#146; Catholic to leave the church, he explained, was like the draining of the contents of the skull; but he never lost his belief in original sin nor his faith in the unexpected revelations of everyday life.<br>
<br>Burgess most wanted to be a composer. Manchester was a musical city, and at twelve Burgess built a crystal radio through which he first heard Debussy's <span class="italic">L'apr&egrave;s-midi d'un faune</span>. Although his father would not pay for piano lessons, he took him to the Mancunian world premi&egrave;re of Constant Lambert's jazzy <span class="italic">Rio Grande</span> in the same year, and this confirmed Burgess as a kind of eclectic musical impressionist with a passion for counterpoint. Before even leaving school, he had written a cello concerto and a symphony, but he was unable to read music at Manchester University because he had failed physics, then thought essential for understanding acoustics. Instead, he read English for a BA honours degree, emerging with a second in 1940.<br>
<br>Between 1940 and 1946 Burgess served in the British army education corps. Sergeant-Major Burgess taught &#145;The British way and purpose&#146; to prepare squaddies for the egalitarian peace none of them&#151;least of all himself&#151;believed in. Earlier he had managed to be musical director of the 54th division entertainment sector.<br>
<br>On 22 January 1942 Burgess married Llewela Isherwood Jones (1920/21&#150;1968), whom he had met at university. Known as Lynne, she was half-Lancastrian, half-Welsh. It was a stormy and very public marriage, much of it conducted in home counties pubs and the bars of Soho and Chiswick, with vigorous infidelity on both sides. While he was serving in Gibraltar, Lynne was beaten up by four American deserters in the London black-out and lost the child she was carrying&#151;the bitter aftershock resounds, unmistakably, in <span class="italic">A Clockwork Orange</span>. She became alcoholic, dying from cirrhosis of the liver on 20 March 1968; Burgess, close to alcoholism as Lynne grew worse, pulled clear of it after her death. He remembered writing in the 1960s as &#145;an agony mitigated by drink&#146;  (Burgess, <span class="italic">You've had your Time</span>, pt 2).<h2>
<a name="Teachingcareerandfirstnovels"></a>Teaching career and first novels</h2>After the war Burgess taught for fourteen years, first with the Central Advisory Council for Forces Education, then at Banbury grammar school. He wrote the first of thirty-one novels in 1949, but <span class="italic">A Vision of Battlements</span> was rejected by publishers in London on the grounds that it was a &#145;second&#146; novel, not a first. He was advised to go away and write the first one first.<br>
<br>From 1954 to 1959 Burgess was an education officer in Malaya and Brunei, training teachers, and himself teaching at the Malay College, Kuala Kangia, &#145;the Eton of the East&#146;. He loved the diversity of Malaya, then undergoing a violent war of independence from the British. More than anything else, Malaya was the experience that turned John Wilson the teacher into Anthony Burgess the writer. Anthony was his confirmation name and was first used on <span class="italic">Time for a Tiger</span> (1956).<br>
<br>The Malayan trilogy of novels&#151;<span class="italic">Time for a Tiger</span>, <span class="italic">The Enemy in the Blanket</span> (1958), and <span class="italic">Beds in the East</span> (1959), eventually assembled under the title <span class="italic">The Long Day Wanes</span>&#151;chronicles the end of empire. Burgess's Malaya takes its place alongside Forster's India, Waugh's Africa, and Greene's Indo-China. But two distinctions set Burgess apart. The first is the protean comedy of speech, which leads a riotous, uncontrollably resourceful life of its own; the second is a pagan sense of nature and mankind sharing one common life, which owes more to Asia than to Europe. Burgess would write more rigorous and experimental fiction than <span class="italic">The Long Day Wanes</span>&#151;novels containing poems, film treatments, transcripts of television shows, music, and librettos&#151;and it became commonplace to assert that he was more interested in form than in people. But the Malayan trilogy denies this: the broad sympathies, tuned ear, and unsleeping eye for detail of the born novelist are evident throughout.<br>
<br>In 1959 doctors were said to have diagnosed an inoperable brain tumour, giving Burgess twelve months to live. Whether they ever did is unclear, since many years later he told one journalist that he heard the diagnosis only from his wife Lynne. He wrote five novels in the following year, to provide royalties for his future widow, and even when the diagnosis proved incorrect, he continued to write as if writing were always a race against time. The diagnosis got him out of Malaya and back home&#151;which may also have been intentional. The Burgesses settled in Sussex, first in Hove, then in the village of Etchingham.<br>
<br>Since no single publisher could publish as fast as he could write, Burgess began to publish under two imprints and two names: his own and Joseph Kell, striking an exotic, <i>Mittel</i>-European note. When Anthony Burgess reviewed Joseph Kell's <span class="italic">Inside Mr Enderby</span> (1963) for the <span class="italic">Yorkshire Post</span>, he did so with commendably cautious approval (&#145;This is, in many ways, a dirty book&#146;). He lost the job, and became a Grub Street legend overnight.<h2>
<a name="AClockworkOrangeandtheEnderbynovels"></a>A Clockwork Orange and the Enderby novels</h2>
<span class="italic">A Clockwork Orange</span> (1962), the short, violent novel which became his most celebrated book, invented a potent myth for the last years of the twentieth century. The story of Alex, the intelligent young thug, and his gang of Droogs who terrorize a dim, dystopian London of the future, touched a fear and a nerve that gave the book success in languages across the world, despite being written in a devised polyglot English composed partly of Cockney and Russian slang (with a glossary at the end).<br>
<br>The popular notoriety of <span class="italic">A Clockwork Orange</span> arose from the scandal of Stanley Kubrick's powerful film version in 1971. Kubrick was accused of glamorizing Burgess's original with sado-eroticism and the emotional use of Beethoven's ninth symphony (Alex's passion) and Purcell's funeral music for Queen Mary. Burgess did not care for it. Both men came to feel they had opened a Pandora's box and Kubrick withdrew the film completely. In its view of human nature, its scepticism over earthly solutions, and its picture of collusion between murderers, politicians, and police, <span class="italic">A Clockwork Orange</span> is a deeply pessimistic tale.<br>
<br>Much of Burgess's fiction proceeds simultaneously on the broadest planes&#151;language, death, God, guilt, sin&#151;and on the most confessional, as he plays endless variations on the theme of himself. In four comedies&#151;<span class="italic">Inside Mr Enderby</span> (1963), <span class="italic">Enderby Outside</span> (1968), <span class="italic">The Clockwork Testament</span> (1974), and <span class="italic">Enderby's Dark Lady</span> (1984)&#151;he turned a distorting fairground mirror on his own progress and the events of his career.<br>
<br>The adventures of Enderby, a stained and flatulent <i>alter ego</i>, are often repetitive, and ring with revenge and the settling of old scores. But they are also very funny. For Burgess the Enderby quartet was a device through which he could let his paranoia out on a longer leash than would have been wise in the world where he had to make a living, and could air unfashionable opinions&#151;on black writing, American students, lesbians, women in general, pop stars, the Shakespeare industry, and the protestant Reformation&#151;with the robustness allowed by a fictional mask.<br>
<br>Enderby understands that to be a writer is to fight battles, to be anarchic, absurd. He envies &#145;nobody but the great, proved dead&#146;, and Burgess himself chose only an exalted brotherhood of the past in his fictions of other writers' lives: Shakespeare (<span class="italic">Nothing Like the Sun</span>, 1964), Keats (<span class="italic">Abba Abba</span>, 1977), Marlowe (<span class="italic">A Dead Man in Deptford</span>, 1993), and Byron (<span class="italic">Byrne</span>, 1996). Burgess creates, with true tenderness, a possessed, bisexual Shakespeare, while the death of John Keats is no less moving because much of <span class="italic">Abba Abba</span> plays Anglo-Italian word games and floats yet another parallel fiction to the career of John Burgess Wilson. As well as the great, proved, dead of Britain, Burgess took on the lions of Europe&#151;Tolstoy, Napoleon, and Beethoven&#151;and survived with no more than a few scratches. <span class="italic">Napoleon Symphony</span> (1974) narrates the life of the emperor in a prose and verse approximation to the form of the &#145;Eroica&#146; symphony.<h2>
<a name="SecondmarriageandlifeinEurope"></a>Second marriage and life in Europe</h2>Burgess claimed to write better in the heat, and after his second marriage, on 9 September 1968, to Countess Liliana Macellari 
    (formerly Liliana Johnson; 1929&#150;2007)
  , daughter of Gilberto Macellari, an actor, he lived most of the time abroad: Malta, Rome, Bracciano, Monaco. &#145;I have no friend except my wife&#146;, he told the psychiatrist Anthony Clare in 1988  (<span class="italic">In the Psychiatrist's Chair</span>, BBC Radio 4, 1988). Burgess and Macellari&#151;known as Liana&#151;were wonderfully well suited. Their son, Andrew 
    (Andrea; <i>d</i>. 2002)
  , Burgess's only child, was already four when they married. Liana had been a research student at Cambridge and became, in effect, Burgess's watchdog, manager, agent, and greatest fan. His work became more disciplined, more adventurous, and more European; while his productivity&#151;books, music, reviewing&#151;remained phenomenal.<br>
<br>Burgess adapted Greek, Russian, and French plays, notably Rostand's <span class="italic">Cyrano de Bergerac</span> for the Royal Shakespeare Company, which enjoyed great success in London and New York in the mid-1980s. For Scottish Opera he translated <span class="italic">Carmen</span> and wrote a new libretto to Weber's <span class="italic">Oberon</span>. As a composer himself, he wrote more than 175 pieces, embracing not only concertos, symphonies, and quartets, but also music for jazz groups, dance bands, opera, Broadway, and the movies. He rarely composed with thought of performance, but rather for pleasure, and as therapy. (He liked to emulate Bach and lay out the exposition of a new fugue every day.) Most of the scores written before 1970 are thought to have disappeared. The $500 royalties he earned for the incidental music to his version of <span class="italic">Cyrano de Bergerac</span>, produced at Minneapolis in 1971, gave him enormous pride, and when his third symphony was premi&egrave;red four years later by the University of Iowa orchestra, which had commissioned it, he said it was the truly great artistic moment of his career to date. Burgess's modernism in literature was never matched by a zeal for experiment in his own music or in his response to the visual arts. As a composer, he was most drawn to Debussy, Elgar, Holst, and Vaughan Williams.<br>
<br>Between 1971 and 1976 the Burgess family lived in Rome, where to his prodigious workload he added hack work for Cinecitta Studios. Movie scripts included <span class="italic">Will!</span>, a Hollywood musical about Shakespeare (unmade) and <span class="italic">Jesus of Nazareth</span> (1977) for Franco Zeffirelli, in which he aimed to replace the gentle Jesus of popular piety with a fiery &#145;Christ the Tiger&#146;. He genuinely believed that you had to write an enormous amount in order to leave anything of value at all, and thus came to be patronized as &#145;a great writer who never wrote a great book&#146;. All his gifts and amplitude of spirit came together in the 1980s, when he produced two richly remembered volumes of &#145;confessions&#146;&#151;<span class="italic">Little Wilson and Big God</span> (1987) and <span class="italic">You've Had Your Time</span> (1990)&#151;and <span class="italic">Earthly Powers</span> (1981), a fictional hellfire tract on the freedoms and horrors of the twentieth century. In this, his most acclaimed and successful novel after <span class="italic">A Clockwork Orange</span>, Burgess combined the disciplines of sermon, tall story, parody, and cabaret spot into a narrative of one century and two men: Ken Toomey, writer and sinner; and Carlo Campanati, dead pope and possible saint. The message that the devil is not only in man but actually is man has rarely been delivered with such zest. <span class="italic">Earthly Powers</span> was Burgess's best chance to win the Booker prize for fiction, but he was beaten by William Golding's <span class="italic">Rites of Passage</span>.<h2>
<a name="Criticalwritingandfinalyears"></a>Critical writing and final years</h2>Burgess was a superb and remarkably fair critic, of tireless curiosity and range. He became one of the last weekly broadsheet &#145;star&#146; reviewers in Britain with his love of literature and respect for the critical craft. He was always eager to take on something new (a huge life of St Anselm, the <span class="italic">Oxford English Dictionary</span> on CD-ROM), always well-mannered, punctilious with deadlines, length, and copy: a Burgess review almost always went in unchanged. Careless sub-editing was keenly monitored by both Burgesses from their Monaco redoubt, but even carelessness was a matter for pained reproach rather than anything more aggressive. Arcane words were employed with absolute precision, and patiently explained. The best neologisms filled gaps in the language no one had noticed before. There is a huge amount to enjoy&#151;and learn from&#151;in the collections taken from nearly four decades of newspaper and magazine writing: <span class="italic">Urgent Copy</span> (1968), <span class="italic">Homage to Quert Yuiop</span> (1986), and <span class="italic">One Man's Chorus</span> (1998).<br>
<br>In two books on words&#151;<span class="italic">Language Made Plain</span> (1964) and <span class="italic">A Mouthful of Air</span> (1992)&#151;and in his work on James Joyce, Burgess shared his gift of spontaneous communication with the adventurous general reader. He wrote two fluent and enticing critical introductions to Joyce and his language: <span class="italic">Here Comes Everybody</span> (1964) and <span class="italic">Joysprick</span> (1973). Burgess wrote a successful radio musical&#151;<span class="italic">Blooms of Dublin</span>&#151;for the Joyce centenary in 1982.<br>
<br>Burgess was made an honorary DLitt of Manchester University (1982), a commandeur de m&eacute;rite culturel of Monaco (1986), and a commandeur des arts et des lettres of France (1986). But he received no honours from the British state, which was bewildered by his absence and failed, entirely, to place him. In his final years there was a growing consensus that Anthony Burgess was the most original British writer alive. France had long revered him, and <span class="italic">Le Monde</span> ran a front-page article on his seventieth birthday in 1987.<br>
<br>Burgess had a splendid voice: robust, rich, boozy, and well-smoked, perfect for melodrama and denunciation. He rarely indulged in either (except on the subject of Graham Greene, whom he considered overrated), but he would sometimes pronounce mock-pompously on literature and contemporary life in the company of younger English writers, to whom he was both Socrates and Falstaff. He looked as though he might once have been in a terrible fight, and his face&#151;beneath its strange slick of stray hair&#151;not quite put back together properly. But he combined his pugilism with grace, and the best photographers saw this. On early snapshots the face is pale and hostile, but in the portraits of later years, Jane Bown of <span class="italic">The Observer</span> and Denis Waugh (National Portrait Gallery) relished the watchful, crumbling grandeur and cigar smoke. The older and wilder he appeared, the more photogenic he became: Enderby as angry, cunning bard. A natural performer, like his parents, he appeared on television talk shows, playing the role of &#145;The writer Anthony Burgess&#146; with a raffish exactness. Interviewers rarely got behind the performance.<br>
<br>By the early 1990s death really was at Burgess's heels, and his body wracked by the most fearful coughing. Like Mozart and Schubert at the end of their lives, he was driven to start new assignments, but continued to smoke his Schimmelpenninck Duets with prodigious ease. He seemed to acquire in old age a humility which placed the passion for experiment above the mere temptation to succeed. Anthony Burgess died of lung cancer on 22 November 1993 at the Hospital of St John and St Elizabeth, Westminster, London. A celebration of readings, memories, and music took place at St Paul's Church, Covent Garden, on Bloomsday, 16 June 1994. It was an elegiac but affectionate occasion, made doubly so by the unscheduled arrival of a buskers' brass band in the piazza outside as it came to a close. To the sounds of &#145;Roll out the barrel&#146; John Burgess Wilson, Joseph Kell, F. X. Enderby, and Anthony Burgess were triumphed on their way.<br>
<br>After his death, <span class="italic">The Times</span> mourned the loss of a &#145;great moralist&#146;. An Anthony Burgess Center was set up at the University of Angers on the Loire, directed by Ben Forkner, and publishing an <span class="italic">Anthony Burgess Newsletter</span> twice a year. The centre includes most of his libraries from Monte Carlo and Malta, his desk, typewriter, briefcase, electronic organ, and cigar box. In April 2000 an Anthony Burgess Society was founded near Saumur, under the sponsorship of local winegrowers and the Salon du Vin et du Livre, a festival inspired by Burgess hero and <i>genus loci</i>, Fran&ccedil;ois Rabelais.<br>
