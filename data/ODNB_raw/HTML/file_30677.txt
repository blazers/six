<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Beit, Sir  Otto John</span>, first baronet  (1865&#150;1930), <span class="occ">financier, philanthropist, and art connoisseur</span>, was born on 7 December 1865 in Hamburg, Germany, twelve years after his brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30676/', "Alfred Beit")</script>. He was the third son of Siegfried Beit (1818&#150;1881), silk merchant, and his wife, Laura Caroline Hahn (<i>b</i>. 1819). The Beits, who were of Sephardic Jewish descent, had settled in Hamburg in the seventeenth century. After completing his education Otto joined in 1888 the London branch of Jules Porg&egrave;s &amp; Co., which in 1890 became Wernher, Beit &amp; Co. He was first sent to Kimberley to learn the diamond business and then to Wernher Beit's Johannesburg branch, H. Eckstein &amp; Co. (&#145;the Corner House&#146;), to handle the firm's share business. He was a member of the Johannesburg stock exchange and was elected its deputy chairman in March 1896.<br>
<br>On his return to London the same year, Beit acquired British citizenship and became a partner in the stockbroking firm L. Hirsch &amp; Co. which represented Wernher Beit on the Paris bourse. Surprisingly, he never became a partner in his brother's company nor a director of its successor, the Central Mining and Investment Corporation Ltd, despite being a major shareholder. In 1897 he married Lilian (<i>d</i>. 1946), daughter of the American Thomas Lane Carter, manager of one of the Corner House mines, and niece of Hamilton Smith, a well-known mining engineer on the Witwatersrand. Like his brother Alfred, Beit was a staunch supporter of Cecil John Rhodes and a close friend of Leander Starr Jameson. However, he was not implicated in the Jameson raid which, coincidentally, occurred while he was staying at Groote Schuur with Rhodes, whom he accompanied to England in 1896. He succeeded his brother as a Rhodes trustee as well as director of the British South Africa Company and of Rhodesia Railways Ltd. He succeeded Lord Milner as chairman of the Rhodes Trust.<br>
<br>After Alfred Beit's death on 16 July 1906 Otto Beit retired from active business to administer the Beit Trust and its endowment of &pound;1,200,000; this had doubled by 1927 when the trust, established mainly to promote education, transport, and communication in central and southern Africa, came of age. Alfred had nominated three trustees: his brother Otto, who knew him better than anyone else and possessed all the desirable qualities for the position, his former partner Sir Julius Charles Wernher (1906&#150;1912), and Bourchier Francis Hawksley (1906&#150;1915), legal adviser to the British South Africa Company. But Otto Beit was the dominant spirit and mainly responsible for the bridge building programme, the first being the Beit Memorial Bridge linking Rhodesia and South Africa, which was opened on 31 August 1929. Having completed the bridge building programme, the trustees turned to education, mainly bursaries, scholarships, and training. Alfred Beit's bequest of &pound;200,000 to the University of Johannesburg, which was diverted to Cape Town, was augmented by &pound;250,000 from Sir Julius Wernher and &pound;50,000 from Otto, who in 1920 received the honorary degree of LLD from the universities of Cape Town and Edinburgh. Otto Beit was a benefactor of the Imperial College of Science and Technology in London and in 1909 established the Beit memorial fellowship for medical research and became FRC. His philanthropic work earned him a knighthood in 1920 and a baronetcy in 1924.<br>
<br>Beit was an unassuming and reserved man who lived quietly and unostentatiously in his house full of great treasures at 49 Belgrave Square and at Tewin Water, Welwyn, Hertfordshire, where his brother Alfred's art collection and part of his own collection were housed. He contributed &pound;10,000 to the Johannesburg Art Gallery and presented the Otto Beit Convalescent Home to Johannesburg in March 1914. His health declined rapidly in his fifties and he died of pernicious anaemia at 49 Belgrave Square on 7 December 1930, his sixty-fifth birthday, leaving his wife, two daughters, and a son. Their elder son, Theodore Hamilton, had died on 27 January 1917.<br>
<br>Their younger son, <a name="cosubject_55887"></a><span class="headword">Sir Alfred Lane Beit</span>, second baronet  (1903&#150;1994), <span class="occ">politician, philanthropist, and art collector</span>, was born in London on 19 January 1903. Educated at Eton College and at Christ Church, Oxford, he succeeded to the baronetcy on the death of his father in 1930. As Beit trustee from 1930 to 1994 he ensured that the trust became a major source for the development of Zimbabwe, Zambia, and Malawi. In 1939 he married Clementine Mabel Kitty Mitford (1915&#150;2005), second daughter of Major the Honourable Clement Mitford and cousin of the famous Mitford sisters. He was the Conservative member of parliament for South-East St Pancras from 1931 to 1945, and served as parliamentary private secretary to the secretary of state for the colonies (1944&#150;5), but lost his seat in the 1945 election.<br>
<br>After serving with the RAF as a squadron leader during the Second World War, Beit and his wife settled in Cape Town, South Africa, in 1945. However, in 1952 the Beits, who were opposed to the Nationalist government's racial policies, left South Africa to live at Russborough, co. Wicklow, Ireland. The restored Palladian mansion was a suitable setting for one of the world's greatest private art collections and was the headquarters of the Alfred Beit Foundation from 1976. In 1986, after the house was burgled a second time&#151;the first burglary had occurred in 1974&#151;Beit donated seventeen old masterpieces to the National Gallery of Ireland, and the rest of the collection was given to the foundation in 1987. The Irish government awarded Sir Alfred and Lady Beit honorary citizenship on 11 May 1993, and in the same year Beit received an honorary fellowship from the Imperial College for Science, Technology and Medicine.<br>
<br>Tall and fair, Beit was a charming and generous man with wide interests, a lover of art and music, and founder of the Wexford operatic festival. He predeceased his wife, dying at Mount Carmel Hospital, Churchtown, Ireland, on 12 May 1994, aged ninety-one. As he had no children, the baronetcy became extinct. A funeral service was held at Christ Church in Dublin on 16 May 1994.<br>
