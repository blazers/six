<span class="headword">Williams,  Margaret Lindsay</span>  (1888&#150;1960), <span class="occ">portrait and historical subject painter</span>, was born on 18 June 1888 at 33 Gordon Road, St John, Cardiff, the elder of two daughters of Samuel A. Williams, shipbroker of Barry Dock, and his wife, Martha Margaret Lindsay, who was of Scottish descent.<br>
<br>Educated privately at home first in Cardiff and then in Barry, where the family moved when she was nine, Margaret Lindsay Williams showed great talent as a painter from a very young age. In 1902, aged thirteen, she entered Cardiff Art School as a student; she competed successfully in competitions and local eisteddfodau, culminating in her winning the school gold medal in art in 1904. In 1905 she went to the Pelham Street School of Art in Kensington, which was run by the academicians Arthur Cope and George Clausen and by J. Watson Nicholl, to prepare for the Royal Academy entrance examination. In 1906, aged eighteen, she entered the Royal Academy Schools, where she was soon recognized as a brilliant student, winning four silver medals, the Creswick prize for landscape (1910) and the academy's greatest prize, the gold medal in art in 1911 for a large historical painting, <span class="italic">The City of Refuge</span> (priv. coll.). She was, at twenty-three, the youngest student to win the gold medal and the first Welsh artist to do so. She completed her studies with travels in France, Italy, and Holland, a tour she undertook on the advice of her favourite teacher and her single greatest influence, John Singer Sargent.<br>
<br>Margaret Lindsay Williams was an elegant and fine-looking woman with dark hair and large brown eyes. There was nothing of the bohemian about her. The academic and formal style of her painting divorced her from the avant-garde world of contemporary art and she mixed little with her fellow artists. She was a very private person, whose life was dedicated to her work. Her native city of Cardiff was extremely proud of her. She remained in Wales during the First World War, having been turned down as an official war artist on the ground that women were not allowed at the front. It was during the war that her career began to blossom and she received major commissions, which led to such works as <span class="italic">Care of Wounded Soldiers at Cardiff Royal Infirmary during the Great War</span> (1916; University Hospital of Wales Healthcare Trust, Cardiff), commissioned by the industrialist Sir William James Thomas, one of Wales's leading benefactors; <span class="italic">David Lloyd George Unveiling the Historical Sculpture in City Hall Cardiff</span> (1918; Cardiff city hall), commissioned by Alderman J. C. Meggitt, a south Wales businessman, and <span class="italic">Welsh National War Service in Westminster Abbey</span> (<i>c</i>.1921; law courts, Cardiff), which was presented to the city by Lord Glanely. The execution of the latter two paintings, containing as they did 114 and 150 small portraits respectively, made stringent demands on her but her portraitist's skills, capturing each individual likeness, give these works an energy unusual in such large formal paintings.<br>
<br>It is as a society painter and royal portraitist that Williams made her reputation. By the early 1920s she had moved permanently to London. There, for the most part, she abandoned the large historical works that had been seminal to her early career and concentrated her efforts on portrait painting. She produced commissioned portraits of Queen Alexandra, Queen Mary (exh. RA, 1938), the young princesses Elizabeth and Margaret, and at least five portraits of Elizabeth II. Her other sitters included the American president Warren Harding, Henry Ford, and Field Marshal Slim. In style her portraiture was somewhat conservative but her painterly skills, reminiscent of Sargent's, lift many of these likenesses above the level of mere competence. Having chosen portraiture, at which she was highly skilled, as her m&eacute;tier, Margaret Lindsay Williams was unusual among women artists in that she made a successful living from her work.<br>
<br>Williams's links with Wales became more tenuous over the years, but she remained a lifelong Welsh Congregationalist. She died, unmarried, on 4 June 1960 at her home, 108 Hamilton Terrace, St John's Wood. Her funeral took place on 10 June at Windsor Road Congregational Church in Barry and she was buried in the town's cemetery on the same day.<br>
