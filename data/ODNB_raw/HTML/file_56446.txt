<span class="headword">Peele,  James</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1585), <span class="occ">writer on bookkeeping</span>, whose origins are obscure, described himself in 1569 as &#145;Cittizen and Salter of London, Clercke of Christes Hospitall, practizer and teacher of the same&#146; (that is, bookkeeping). He was appointed clerk of Christ's Hospital, London, in 1562, and continued working there until his death in 1585. His duties included those of bookkeeper. He introduced the double-entry system in the hospital's bookkeeping, and entries in several of the surviving ledgers are in his hand. There is indirect evidence that he was called in by merchants to settle disputes that involved accounts; and that he also taught bookkeeping.<br>
<br>Peele wrote two books on double-entry bookkeeping. The first, <span class="italic">The maner and fourme how to kepe a perfecte reconyng, after the order of the moste worthie and notable accompte, of debitour and creditour</span>, was published in London in 1553. It is a short book, dedicated to Sir William Densell, governor of the Company of Merchant Adventurers. Its treatment of the subject owes much to earlier published works, but includes some novelties. The second book, <span class="italic">The Pathe Waye to Perfectnes, in th'Accomptes of Debitour, and Creditour</span>, was published in London in 1569. It is a larger book than the earlier work, and is of much greater originality. The didactic part is presented in the form of a dialogue between a schoolmaster and a scholar, the latter a servant sent by a merchant to acquire a knowledge of double-entry bookkeeping. Peele displayed a thorough understanding of merchants' accounts, and he included a fully worked-out example of the division of the ledger between a secret or private ledger and the ordinary ledger for use in the ordinary course of business, on the lines proposed by John Weddington two years earlier.<br>
<br>Though some later authors, notably John Mellis in his <span class="italic">A Briefe Instruction</span> of 1588, borrowed from Peele's books, their influence seems to have been limited in spite of the high quality especially of his second book. However, Richard Dafforne recalled his name in 1635: &#145;Want of love to this Art [double-entry bookkeeping], is the cause why James Peele, and others that have written in English upon this subject, are known by Name only, &amp; not by Imitation&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Merchants Mirrour</span>, 1635, epistle dedicatory).<br>
<br>The title-page of Peele's second book includes an illustration of a man seated at a table; on the basis of the coat of arms displayed, this is said to be a representation of the author. His son <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21768/', "George Peele (bap. 1556, d. 1596)")</script>, from his marriage to his first wife, Anne (<i>d</i>. 1579), became well known as a playwright and poet.<br>
