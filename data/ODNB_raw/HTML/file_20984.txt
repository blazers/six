<span class="headword">Owen <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Wilkes]</span>,  Alice</span>  (1547&#150;1613), <span class="occ">philanthropist</span>, was the third child of Thomas Wilkes, a rich landowner of Islington. Nothing is known of her childhood apart from the story of her narrow escape from death on the archery fields of Islington; this first appeared in Stow's <span class="italic">Survey of London</span> and was subsequently embellished several times. She was playing with some other children when a stray arrow pierced her hat, providentially missing her head. Stow says that the almshouses and the school which she later founded were a thank-offering for her survival. In 1570 Alice Wilkes married Henry Robinson (<i>d</i>. 1585), a member of the Brewers' Company, with whom she had six sons and five daughters. Her second husband was William Elkin (1523&#150;1593), an alderman of the City of London, with whom she had one daughter who was baptized in 1587. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21032/', "Thomas Owen (d. 1598)")</script>, a judge of the court of common pleas, became her third husband in 1594 or 1595. Alice Owen was left sizeable sums of money in her husbands' wills.<br>
<br>Stow lists benefactions that Alice Owen made in her lifetime to a number of institutions, including &pound;200 to Oxford University (in fact &pound;100) and &pound;60 to Christ's Hospital. The latter was recorded in 1598. However, the most significant of her charitable activities were focused on the foundation of her almshouses for ten poor women, and her free school for thirty boys from Islington and Clerkenwell. She opened discussions with the governors of Christ's Hospital in February 1607 on her proposals, but her plans changed. Having purchased 11 acres of ground where her accident took place (known as Hermitage Fields) and property in Charterhouse Closes in 1609, she reached an agreement with the Brewers' Company, which became trustees for the almshouses, using the income from the property to fund expenses. In 1610 Alice obtained a royal patent to erect a chapel and a house for a master to &#145;read to the widows and teach the sons and daughters of the poor&#146;  (Dare, 19), and permission to buy lands to support this foundation.<br>
<br>Alice Owen drew up detailed rules for the conduct of both the school and the almshouses in 1613. The schoolmaster was to be single, of good conduct, and able to teach grammar, writing, and arithmetic to prepare his pupils for apprenticeships or other honest employment. He was to be paid &pound;5 quarterly, live rent free, and be supplied with fuel for heating, an arrangement which compares favourably with other foundations of the period. The master also had responsibilities in the almshouses where he had to read prayers to the almswomen twice a day and take any disciplinary measures necessary. The widows admitted to the almshouses were to be given money, seacoal, a new gown every two years, and additional small benefits. Strict rules of conduct had to be adhered to, and if an almswoman married she had to leave.<br>
<br>At the time of Alice Owen's death the purchase of the property to fund the school had not yet been made and it was left to her executor, her son-in-law Robert Rich, to buy 40 acres at Orsett in Essex in 1617. The account books of the foundation for the first half of the seventeenth century show that the balance was often negative, which gave rise to a rather tart comment in one Brewers' Company file that the company had to find the difference. This was only partly due to an underestimate on Alice Owen's part: an allowance of &pound;1 10<i>s</i>. for an annual inspection dinner for the Brewers' Company was by the 1630s being overspent regularly by as much as &pound;10 while the London rents remained fixed.<br>
<br>In addition to her charitable bequests Alice Owen's will made generous provision for her daughters, godchildren, and grandchildren. Her servants were given money and her &#145;worser&#146; clothes. There were also new benefactions including &pound;8 to poor prisoners, &pound;20 for a stock of coals and wood for the poor of the parish of St Michael Bassishaw, and &pound;60 for sixty poor women. She died on 26 November 1613 and was buried in St Mary's, Islington, where a magnificent tomb was erected with an effigy of her reading a book, with smaller figures of her children and grandchildren in relief. The church was pulled down in 1742 and her body reinterred in the crypt. It was removed to Finchley cemetery in 1903 when further work was undertaken on the church. After its uncertain financial start Alice Owen's foundation became profitable. A substantial rebuilding of both the school and the almshouses was carried out in 1841 on a new site in Owen Street, Islington. This was rapidly followed by a review of the school in 1865 under the Taunton commission which investigated endowed grammar schools. A scheme was finally approved in 1878 which allowed for the demolition of the almshouses and their replacement by pensions for the occupants, the construction of a new boys' school, and the opening of a school for girls. Between 1971 and 1976 the move to the present site in Potters Bar was completed, the two schools having amalgamated as Dame Alice Owen's School in 1973.<br>
