<span class="headword">Vane,  William Harry</span>, first duke of Cleveland  (1766&#150;1842), <span class="occ">aristocrat</span>, was the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/95325/', "Henry Vane, second earl of Darlington (1726/7&#150;1792)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/53274/', "Vane, Henry, first earl of Darlington")</script>], and Margaret (<i>bap</i>. 1733, <i>d</i>. 1800), daughter of Robert Lowther and sister of James Lowther, first earl of Lonsdale. He was born on 27 July 1766 in St James's Square, London, and was educated by a private tutor, William Lipscomb, and at Christ Church, Oxford, where he matriculated in 1783. He married, first, on 17 September 1787, Lady Katherine Margaret (1766&#150;1807), second daughter and coheir of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21617/', "Harry Powlett or Paulet, sixth duke of Bolton")</script>; they had three sons and five daughters. He married, second, on 27 July 1813, Elizabeth (1777&#150;1861), daughter of Robert Russell, market gardener, of Newton, Yorkshire. His second wife had been his mistress for some years, and previously that of Thomas Coutts, the banker. She inherited substantially under her husband's will.<br>
<br>As Viscount Barnard he was MP for Totnes in 1788&#150;90, and for Winchelsea (which his father had recently purchased) in 1790&#150;92. His political allegiances fluctuated; he started as a whig, but generally supported Pitt, until succeeding as earl of Darlington on 8 September 1792. Thereafter he became increasingly alienated from Pitt, who was unwilling to elevate Darlington in the peerage. He supported the ministries of Canning and Wellington as an independent. Although he seldom spoke in the House of Lords, he was an advocate of political reform, and presented there a petition from South Shields on the subject on 3 March 1829. He proved himself throughout an influential supporter of the bill, and willing enough to abandon his six borough seats. Indeed, he was said to have purchased the seats to ensure his marquessate, and given them up to gain a dukedom: he was created marquess of Cleveland in 1827 and duke of Cleveland in 1833. However, his support for reform was such that he disinherited his elder sons (who had become tories) in favour of his youngest son, Lord Harry Vane, who remained a whig.<br>
<br>The duke was more notable as a sportsman than as a politician. Living at Raby Castle, co. Durham, for a considerable portion of every year, he proved himself an enthusiastic upholder of every form of sport. He began to hunt his father's hounds in 1787, and spared no expense on his kennel. His hounds were renowned for their speed, and were divided into two packs, one of large breed and one of small; with these he hunted on alternate days. After each day's hunting it was his habit to enter an account of the day's sport in a diary, portions of which were privately published at the close of every season. He paid considerable sums of money to his tenants for the preservation of foxes, and on their behalf he successfully opposed the first Stockton and Darlington Railway in 1820, because in its course it encroached on a favourite cover. In 1835 he divided his celebrated pack between his son-in-law, Mark Milbanke, and himself, and the old district of the hunt was at the same time apportioned. Almost equally enthusiastic in his patronage of the turf, he maintained a magnificent stud, and was rewarded by winning the St Leger with his horse Chorister in 1831.<br>
<br>The duke of Cleveland died in Cleveland House, St James's Square, on 29 January 1842, and was buried in Staindrop church, co. Durham, where a monument was erected to his memory. He was succeeded in the title by each of his three sons in turn, none of whom had any legitimate heirs. Lord Brougham, whom Cleveland had introduced to the House of Commons as member for Winchelsea and who was a lifelong friend, was one of the executors of a will that left almost &pound;1 million in addition to huge estates, around &pound;1,250,000 in consols, and plate and jewels to the value of a further &pound;1 million.<br>
