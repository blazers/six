</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Riddell,  George Allardice</span>, Baron Riddell  (1865&#150;1934), <span class="occ">newspaper proprietor</span>, was born at 2 Stanhope Place, Loughborough Road, Brixton Heath, London, on 25 May 1865, the only son of James Riddell, photographer, and his wife, Isabel Young. Educated privately, he was first employed as a clerk by a Bloomsbury solicitor who, impressed by Riddell's ability and promise, gave him his articles. In his final examinations he was placed first in all England and was admitted a solicitor in 1888. He became obsessively absorbed in his legal work. Later he developed a similar, all-consuming interest in the newspaper business. He told a friend that he had suddenly realized he was a slave to his work and was missing out on much life had to offer. He determined never to return to his office. Soon afterwards, the friend observed he devoted himself instead to the <span class="italic">News of the World</span>.<br>
<br>Riddell's association with the <span class="italic">News of the World</span> dated from 1891, when he had been the legal consultant to the consortium that purchased the ailing Sunday newspaper. He had already acquired a holding in the <span class="italic">Western Mail</span>. Shrewdly and constantly Riddell enhanced his shareholding in the <span class="italic">News of the World</span> and by 1903 was the managing director. In 1910 he secured the controlling interest in the failing publishing firm of George Newnes, and in quick succession added the publications <span class="italic">Country Life</span> and <span class="italic">John O'London's Weekly</span>. Before the First World War he secured most of the capital in C. Arthur Pearson Ltd, and in 1921 combined this firm with Newnes to which he later added London Opinion Ltd in 1924, and in 1929 Leach's Publications Ltd. But it was the <span class="italic">News of the World</span> that was the cornerstone of Riddell's fortune and influence. It was his ingenuity and enterprise, particularly his appointment of agents to sell the paper directly throughout the country, that gave the first boost to sales. The paper's invariable priority was the &#145;solid, careful, objective presentation of police court reports of rape, seduction, violence and marital infidelity&#146;  (Williams, 235). Despite Riddell's support of the <span class="roman">Judicial Proceedings (Regulation of Reports) Bill</span> in 1926, designed to restrict the reporting of divorce case details, circulation continued to boom, from 30,000 copies when the newspaper was first acquired to more than 7 million.<br>
<br>Riddell's contribution to the paper's success was widely recognized by informed critics, as one acknowledged in 1933: &#145;The paper is uncommonly well managed with as perfect an organisation as can be made&#146;  (Blumenfeld, 161). Yet Riddell never readily acknowledged his connection with a newspaper that emphasized the sensational and the salacious. If, when he reached the gates of Heaven, St Peter frowned upon his association with the <span class="italic">News of the World</span>, he told Hamilton Fyfe, &#145;I will urge in extenuation my connection with <span class="italic">John O'London's Weekly</span> and <span class="italic">Country Life</span>&#146;  (Fyfe, 107&#150;8).<br>
<br>In 1909 Herbert Asquith, advised that the support of the <span class="italic">News of the World</span> was a valuable asset to the Liberals, gave Riddell the knighthood he had been seeking. Among those who pressed the prime minister to reward Riddell was David Lloyd George. The politician and the newspaper proprietor were close friends for twenty years. Both men acknowledged, though no bargain was ever struck, the mutual advantage in working together. Riddell made himself indispensable to Lloyd George. He kept him well informed of all press gossip; he provided hospitality, holidays, a car, a house, the free tenancy of two country mansions, a golfing partner, and not least, constant, shrewd support in his newspaper. Lloyd George availed himself of his friend's consummate skills as a negotiator. In 1912 Riddell drafted the memorandum that settled the miners' strike and was the basis for the <span class="roman">Miners' Minimum Wage Act</span>. During the First World War, Riddell liaised between government and press, frequently chairing the press committee. At the peace conference he continued his work, establishing smooth relations between the British delegation and the press at various European locations in 1919, at Washington in 1921, and in 1927 at Geneva. For his public and private services Riddell was decorated by the French and Italian governments, and in 1918 made a baronet.<br>
<br>On 13 December 1888 Riddell had married Grace Edith Williams. They were divorced on 29 October 1900. Riddell never publicly acknowledged his first marriage. On 2 November 1900 he married his cousin, Annie Molison Allardice. In 1915, during the course of a heated newspaper exchange, Sir Hedley Le Bas made public Riddell's first marriage. Subsequently, George V rejected Riddell's nomination as a peer because he had been the guilty party in a divorce action. Lloyd George insisted upon his friend's elevation, and the king's reservations were finally overcome by letters from other press lords protesting Riddell's virtues as chairman of the Newspaper Proprietors' Association. He received a barony in 1920. So Riddell became the first divorced peer to enter the Lords, breaking a social and constitutional convention that, until then, had bound both houses of parliament.<br>
<br>After the Paris peace conference a rift began to develop between Lloyd George, who became bitterly anti-French, and Riddell, who was pro-French and disapproved of the government's Near Eastern policy. There is some dispute as to the cause of the final breach  (R. Blake, <span class="italic">The Unknown Prime Minister: the Life and Times of Andrew Bonar Law, 1858&#150;1923</span>, 1955), but the friendship was never repaired. Lloyd George resented Riddell's support for Andrew Bonar Law, and was persuaded, unfairly, that his erstwhile friend had no use for him once he had ceased to be prime minister  (A. J. P. Taylor, ed., <span class="italic">Lloyd George: a Diary</span>, 1971).<br>
<br>No longer so engaged in the fortunes of high politics, Riddell concentrated his energies more upon his business interests, charitable activities, and least successfully upon writing. For someone who had, for years, contributed a regular newspaper column that was frequently lively and always informed, his books are surprisingly pedestrian, often as banal and jejune as their titles suggest, as in <span class="italic">Some Things that Matter</span> (1922) and <span class="italic">More Things that Matter</span> (1925). He churned out biography, company history, and a monograph on medical ethics. Altogether different in kind, style, and quality are the diaries he kept from 1908 to 1923, and published shortly before the end of his life in three volumes: <span class="italic">Lord Riddell's War Diary</span> (1933), <span class="italic">Lord Riddell's Intimate Diary of the Peace Conference and After</span> (1933), and <span class="italic">More Pages from my Diary, 1908&#150;1914</span> (1934). They afford a most valuable guide to the politics of the period generally and to the career of Lloyd George in particular. The detailed retailing of conversations, while not always appreciated by Riddell's interlocutors, has provided rich and entertaining pickings for historians.<br>
<br>Riddell's work for charity and his munificence were legion. He served as president, chairman, or treasurer on the boards of a score of disparate charitable boards. He had a particular concern for medical charities, and provided handsome endowments for the Royal Free Hospital, London, and the Eastman Dental Clinic. He was a generous and caring patron of the printing industry and a founder of the London School of Printing. Golf was his great recreation, and he wished that others might have the opportunity to share his passion for the game. With Sir Emsley Carr he founded the Artisans' Golf Association. He was closely associated with the golf course at Walton Heath, Surrey, and much preferred an austere room in the club house to any in his palatial mansion that overlooked St James's Park.<br>
<br>Riddell died at his home, Walton Heath House, Walton on the Hill, Banstead, Surrey, on 5 December 1934. Employees and friends alike remembered with affection the strange contradictions of Riddell's character. He was masterful yet extraordinarily considerate; sure of his own judgement yet always open to persuasion. Few rich men had so few wants. He was keenly interested in making money, but not in spending it upon himself. His clothes were shabby, he drank little, was indifferent to food, but smoked incessantly. A man of amazing industry, he had an insatiable curiosity, made manifest by cross-examining everyone with whom he came into contact. An editor noted that Riddell &#145;had an infinite capacity for asking never answering questions&#146;  (Dark, 18). He was consistently appreciative of service and good work by his employees. To his friends he was kindly, shrewd, invariably understanding, and helpful.<br>
