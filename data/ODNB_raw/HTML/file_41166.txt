<span class="headword">Aleyn,  John</span> <span class="st"> [J. Alanus]</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1373), <span class="occ">composer</span>, probably came from Pattishall, Northamptonshire. He is first recorded on 29 April 1361 in possession of a chantry in the church of St James Garlickhythe, London. By Michaelmas 1362 he was a clerk and chaplain in the household chapel of Edward III, and on 25 September of that year he was presented to a canonry at Windsor, which he held until his death. This was the most important of his numerous ecclesiastical preferments, and he bequeathed to St George's Chapel at Windsor a roll of music (<i>unus rotulus de cantu musicali</i>) which may well have contained polyphonic works. Aleyn also appears to have undertaken a number of administrative tasks in royal service. In 1366 he was sent to Oxford by Queen Philippa to seek out one of her own clerks; he was paid on 20 October 1367 for transporting a quantity of the king's money to Westminster; and he later served as a receiver of loans from religious houses in Kent. Aleyn's most important work is the three-voice Latin motet <span class="italic">Sub Arturo plebs / Fons citharizancium / In omnem terram</span>  (<span class="italic">Motets of French Provenance</span>, ed. F. L. Harrison, 172ff.). Each voice carries a different verbal text: one of the two upper voices (which are of equal range) names fourteen contemporary singers and musicians, nine of whom served in the household chapels of Edward III or of the Black Prince during the 1360s; the other names four music theorists, beginning with Tubal, and identifies the motet's composer as Alani, J. This work is the only complete English representative of the mid- and late fourteenth-century tradition of &#145;musicians' motets&#146;, and it was almost certainly inspired by earlier French models. Composed probably in the late 1360s or early 1370s (it was once thought to be earlier), <span class="italic">Sub Arturo plebs</span> enjoyed an extensive continental circulation well into the fifteenth century. Four secular songs which survive in a variety of contrafact versions (that is, in versions where new sets of words have replaced the originals, but the music remains unchanged), variously attributed to &#145;Alanus&#146; and to &#145;Magister Alanus&#146;, may also be the work of Aleyn, as may a three-voice <span class="roman">Gloria</span> setting in the Old Hall manuscript  (BL, Add. MS 57950) attributed to &#145;Aleyn&#146; . Aleyn, who is commonly identified with the composer J. Alanus, died between 29 September and 7 December 1373.<br>
