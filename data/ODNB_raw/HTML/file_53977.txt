<span class="headword">Ridley,  (William) Arnold</span>  (1896&#150;1984), <span class="occ">actor and playwright</span>, was born on 7 January 1896 at 4 Pera Place, Bath, the son of William Robert Ridley, drill instructor, and his wife, Rosa Caroline Morrish. The author of <span class="italic">The Ghost Train</span>, one of the most popular plays, and later films, of the first half of the twentieth century, Ridley had virtually a second coming when, in his seventies and eighties, he played the &#145;doddery and doubtfully continent&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 14 March 1984) Private Godfrey in the long-running BBC television series <span class="italic">Dad's Army</span>.<br>
<br>Ridley was educated at Clarendon School, Widcombe, and the City of Bath secondary school before studying for a certificate of the Board of Education in the elementary training department at Bristol University from 1914 to 1916. His first stage appearance was at the Theatre Royal, Bristol, in 1914 in <span class="italic">Prunella</span> by Laurence Housman and H. Granville Barker. Ridley enlisted in the Somerset light infantry in 1916, saw active service in France and in 1917 was discharged with injuries that left him prone to black-outs. He taught for a short period before joining first Birmingham Repertory Company (1918&#150;20) and then the Plymouth Repertory Company (1920&#150;21), but the severity of his war wounds led him to begin writing.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">The Ghost Train</span>, Ridley's second play, a comedy thriller, was written in 1923 while he was working as manager of his father's boot shop in Manvers Street, Bath, and was reputedly prompted by a four-hour wait at Mangotsfield Junction Station, Gloucestershire. Originally rejected, it was first put on at the Theatre Royal, Brighton, on 22 June 1925, and on the London stage at St Martin's Theatre on 23 November 1925. It transferred first to the Garrick Theatre, then to the Comedy Theatre, and in all ran for 655 West End performances. It became a favourite with provincial repertory companies and amateur dramatic groups, and was adapted as a musical, <span class="italic">Happy Holiday</span>.<br>
<br>Arnold Ridley wrote some thirty further plays, sometimes in collaboration with others. Among the most successful were <span class="italic">Third Time Lucky</span> (originally <span class="italic">Unholy Orders</span>), <span class="italic">Easy Money</span>, in which he played the original Philip Stafford, at the Grand Theatre, Blackpool, on 24 February 1947, and <span class="italic">Beggar My Neighbour</span>, all of which became films. His plays were described as &#145;tightly plotted, witty, compassionate, often exciting, about ordinary people doing extraordinary things&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Guardian</span>, 10 Jan 1976). In 1935 he formed his own short-lived film company, which produced <span class="italic">Royal Eagle</span>. His first marriage, to Hilda Mary Cooke, was followed by another, to Isola Strong.<br>
<br>Ridley enlisted in 1939 and went with the British expeditionary force to France as a public relations officer with the rank of major but was invalided out. For a few weeks in the 1940s he was a member of the Local Defence Volunteers at Caterham in Surrey. He joined the Entertainment National Service Association (ENSA) for which he directed <span class="italic">The Ghost Train</span>. Through this he met his third wife, Althea Parker, an actress; they were married in 1947 and had a son, Nicholas.<br>
<br>From 1942 to 1944 Ridley directed productions of the Malvern Company. He continued to act, sometimes in his own plays, and in 1953 took the part of Walter Gabriel in the stage adaptation of the BBC radio serial <span class="italic">The Archers</span> at the Theatre Royal, Birmingham; in the 1960s and 1970s he was heard as Doughy Hood in the radio broadcasts of the same serial. He was also the vicar in the television series <span class="italic">Crossroads</span>. His stage appearances included Juror no. 9 in <span class="italic">12 Angry Men</span> at the Queen's Theatre, London, in July 1964.<br>
<br>Ridley played Private Godfrey in the eighty <span class="italic">Dad's Army</span> television programmes, recorded between April 1969 and July 1977; in the stage version at the Shaftesbury Theatre, London, from 2 October 1975; and in its subsequent 27-week provincial tour. Ridley was the subject of the television programme <span class="italic">This is your Life</span> in March 1976. He was made an OBE in 1982.<br>
<br>Arnold Ridley described himself as &#145;always a repertory actor at heart&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 8 Jan 1976). He was regarded in the theatre as a &#145;disciplined person&#146; who &#145;learnt his lines and moves very quickly&#146;  (Pertwee, 54). He claimed never to have missed a performance or arrived late for a rehearsal, and once said &#145;the one thing I can't stand is inefficiency&#146;  (<span class="italic">Freshview</span>, 5 Jan 1970). Off-stage his speech was &#145;brisk and schoolmasterly&#146; and his eyes &#145;danced with humour and irony&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Guardian</span>, 10 Jan 1976).<br>
<br>Ridley had a lifelong interest in rugby football, joining Bath rugby club as a schoolboy in 1908. As its match secretary from 1929 to 1936 he &#145;did much to revise the fixture list and bring in the London clubs&#146;  (<span class="italic">Bath and West Evening Chronicle</span>). Ridley was its president from 1950 to 1952 and continued to support the side until 1982. He died on 12 March 1984 in hospital in Northwood; his funeral was held at St Anne's Church, Highgate, London, a week later.<br>
