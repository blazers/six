<span class="headword">Hindley,  Charles</span>  (1796&#150;1857), <span class="occ">politician and factory reformer</span>, was born on 25 June 1796 at the Fairfield Moravian Settlement, Droylsden, near Manchester. He was the third son of Ignatius Hindley (1756&#150;1803), a muslin manufacturer in Dukinfield, Cheshire, and his wife, Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Ambler (1762&#150;1801).<br>
<br>Hindley was educated within the Moravian community, first at the academy at Fairfield, then at Fulneck, near Leeds. He went on to study with the Revd C. A. Pohlman at Haverfordwest in Wales before becoming classical and mathematical tutor at the Moravian settlement at Gracehill, Ireland. He was intended for the Moravian ministry and had started to preach locally when the death of his elder brother in 1819 led to his return to manage the family's two cotton mills. The Hindleys were among the earliest mill owners in Dukinfield and Charles obviously inherited their entrepreneurial spirit as the business expanded in the 1820s.<br>
<br>Hindley married Hannah Buckley (1801&#150;1837), a Mossley mill owner's daughter, in September 1822. They had six children, but only two daughters, Hannah (1830&#150;1857) and Susan (1835&#150;1846), survived infancy. These girls were brought up by Hindley's second wife, Ann (1805&#150;1854), whom he married in 1839. She was the daughter of Richard Fort of Read Hall, Lancashire. Ann became a Moravian and was involved in many of her husband's interests, including the Ashton under Lyne Mechanics' Institute. She predeceased him on 16 December 1854. Hindley's daughter Hannah was the author of two locally published books which describe the family's travels in the Holy Land. She married Henry Woods, who became MP for Wigan, and she died on 12 July 1857.<br>
<br>Hindley was involved in social concerns from the 1820s, when he helped set up the Ashton Mechanics' Institute (1825), of which he was president until his death. By the early 1830s he had made his fortune and had begun to devote his mind and wealth to social and political concerns, adopting the cause of factory reform. His speeches show humanitarian concern for the health and educational welfare of children working in the mills. After an agitation in which he was involved, Ashton became a parliamentary constituency and he unsuccessfully contested the seat in December 1832, but was elected in January 1835 and remained Liberal MP until his death.<br>
<br>Althorp's <span class="roman">Factory Act</span> had become law in 1833, but was proving ineffective and Hindley's entrance to parliament was seen by the factory reformers as a chance to remedy this. He introduced a new bill designed gradually to introduce a ten-hour day for workers under the age of twenty-one, but this was felt to be too cautious by many in the factory movement, especially Richard Oastler. They were further disillusioned when Hindley dropped the bill in return for a government promise to enforce the 1833 act more rigorously. In 1834 and 1836 legal proceedings were taken against Hindley's own mill (the day-to-day running of which was in the hands of his nephew) for breaches of the <span class="roman">Factory Act</span> and long hours were still being worked there in 1848. As a result Hindley became an ambivalent figure, and he never regained the trust of some factory reformers, in particular Joseph Rayner Stephens, whose denunciations of him as untrustworthy coloured Hindley's subsequent reputation.<br>
<br>Hindley continued to support factory reform and in 1843 served on a select committee inquiring into the operation of the <span class="roman">Factory Acts</span>. He had Chartist sympathies and has been credited with helping to draw up the <span class="roman">People's Charter</span>, but, although he was one of several MPs involved in the early stages, he was not connected with the final draft. He voted for the ballot in 1853. He was also president of the Universal Peace Society in the 1840s and presided over the first International Peace Congress in London.<br>
<br>Hindley died of heart disease on 1 December 1857 at his home, Dartmouth House, Queen Street, Westminster, and was buried four days later in the Moravian cemetery, Chelsea. His final illness and its treatment were the subject of a pamphlet by the physician Augustus Bozzi Granville, <span class="italic">Dr Todd and the Late Member for Ashton: Fatal Effect of the stimulating Treatment of Disease</span> (1860).<br>
