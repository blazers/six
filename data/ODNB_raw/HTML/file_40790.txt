<span class="headword">Day,  James  Wentworth</span>  (1899&#150;1983), <span class="occ">journalist</span>, was born on 21 April 1899 at Marsh House, Exning, Suffolk, the elder son of James Thomas Wentworth Day (1862&#150;1906) of Wicken, Cambridgeshire, and his wife, Martha Ethel, daughter of Llewellyn Hatch Staples of Bourn, in Cambridgeshire. Wentworth Day, who was known to his friends as Jim, was educated at Newton College, Newton Abbot, and read English as an extramural student at Cambridge University under Sir Arthur Quiller-Couch. After service in the First World War (in 1917&#150;18) he became a journalist, learning his craft on the <span class="italic">Cambridge Daily News</span> and then in Fleet Street as a reporter on the <span class="italic">Daily Express</span>, where in 1923 he was promoted to publicity manager after only five days. From 1924 to 1925 he was make-up sub-editor of both the <span class="italic">Sunday Express</span> and <span class="italic">Daily Express</span>. He also edited a monthly sporting publication called <span class="italic">English Life</span>, and became Lord Beaverbrook's personal assistant. He was assistant editor of <span class="italic">Country Life</span> at the age of twenty-six and acting editor of <span class="italic">The Field</span> (1930&#150;31).<br>
<br>A high tory patriot of extreme right wing views, in 1933 Wentworth Day became the personal representative of the eccentric pro-fascist Lady Houston, and was involved with her sponsorship of the duke of Hamilton's first flight over Mount Everest. Once, when involved with one of Lady Houston's political meetings, he was attacked and received a black eye. A few days later in a West End club Churchill walked in with a friend to whom he introduced Wentworth Day as Lady Houston's kept man&#151;&#145;Observe the love token in his eye&#146;. Although impressed by Mussolini, Wentworth Day persistently warned of the danger posed by German ambitions and criticized the Nazi regime.<br>
<br>After editing the <span class="italic">Illustrated Sporting and Dramatic News</span> from 1935 to 1937 Wentworth Day made a sudden switch of career to become propaganda adviser to the government of Egypt, providing material for a book, <span class="italic">Sport in Egypt</span> (1938). He served as a war correspondent in the Second World War but was invalided out in 1943.<br>
<br>Wentworth Day was a self-styled politician though never a member of parliament, having unsuccessfully contested Hornchurch (in 1950 and 1951) and campaigned in seven other by-elections. He listed among his recreations in <span class="italic">Who's Who</span> &#145;taking the left wing intelligentsia at its own valuation&#146;, and to this end he acted as an <i>agent provocateur</i> at a political meeting in Newark during the 1945 general election. While the marxist Harold Laski, then chairman of the Labour Party, was in Newark giving a political address, Wentworth Day put some leading questions to him, making sure that someone from the <span class="italic">Newark Advertiser</span> reported them. Laski sued the newspaper for suggesting that he had advocated revolution by violent means, but the jury found for the paper and Laski's career was seriously damaged. He also threatened to thrash the Christian socialist vicar of Thaxted, Conrad Noel, if the latter removed a union flag from the church.<br>
<br>Wentworth Day was the author of many books, including biographies of Queen Elizabeth, the queen mother (1967), Princess Marina, duchess of Kent (1962), Sir Malcolm Campbell (1931), and Lady Houston (1958). He contributed to various journals such as <span class="italic">Country Life</span> on ghosts, farming, wildfowling, and on his beloved East Anglia; he also published many books on these topics, including <span class="italic">Essex Ghosts</span> (1973), <span class="italic">Farming Adventure: a Thousand Miles through England on a Horse</span> (1975), <span class="italic">The Modern Fowler</span> (1934), and <span class="italic">Norwich and the Broads</span> (1953). From 1962 to 1966 he edited <span class="italic">East Anglia Life</span>, a job for which he was eminently suitable, but quarrelled with the proprietor and resigned.<br>
<br>Wentworth Day was married three times: his first wife was Helen Alexia Gardom, whom he married on 12 December 1925. They were divorced in 1934, and he married (Elizabeth) Nerina Shute (1908&#150;2004) on 24 November 1936. This relationship also ended in divorce in 1943, whereupon he married Marion Edith McLean of New Zealand, with whom he had a daughter. Wentworth Day was a caricature of a reactionary English country gentleman of the old school. He was often irascible and difficult to deal with, defects aggravated by old age and near blindness. He died at his splendid house at Ingatestone, in Essex, on 4 January 1983.<br>
