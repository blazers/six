<span class="headword">Fitzgerald,  John  fitz Edmund</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1589), <span class="occ">landowner and rebel</span>, was the son of Edmund fitz Maurice Fitzgerald, seneschal of Imokilly, and Shylie, daughter of Mulroney O'Carroll, lord of Ely O'Carroll. He married Honora, daughter of James fitz Maurice Fitzgerald, with whom he had two sons, Edmund, who succeeded to Castlemartyr, and Richard, and two daughters, Catherine and Eleanor. Honora married, second, Edmund, eldest son of Sir John fitz Edmund Fitzgerald of Cloyne.<br>
<br>The barony of Imokilly, to the east of Cork city, came into the possession of the earls of Desmond in the 1420s, and James, the sixth earl, appointed an illegitimate son of the Fitzgerald knight of Kerry to be his seneschal in the barony, the position becoming hereditary among his descendants. In this role John fitz Edmund Fitzgerald was the earl's chief officer within the barony, and emerged as one of the key military men within the earldom of Desmond between the 1560s and 1580s. He supported the rebellion of James fitz Maurice Fitzgerald in 1569 and as a consequence the lord deputy, Sir Henry Sidney, besieged his castle at Castlemartyr, co. Cork, destroying part of the curtain wall with a demi-culverin. Faced with imminent defeat, John and his men escaped during the night through a bog which adjoined the castle. In late October he was captured, and appears not to have been prominent in the rebellion thereafter. He did, however, facilitate the ending of the rebellion in 1573 when he brought fitz Maurice's son to the lord president, Sir John Perrot; two days later, on 23 February 1573, fitz Maurice submitted to Perrot at Kilmallock, co. Limerick.<br>
<br>In November 1573 Gerald fitz James Fitzgerald, fourteenth earl of Desmond, escaped from detention in Dublin and made his way to Munster where he gathered his forces to resist the lord deputy, Sir William Fitzwilliam. On 18 July 1574 John fitz Edmund was one of Desmond's kinsmen and counsellors who signed the &#145;Desmond combination&#146; by which they promised to support Desmond against Fitzwilliam, but, following a brief campaign by Fitzwilliam, Desmond submitted in September. Munster was finally pacified. In March 1575 John accompanied fitz Maurice into exile in France, their stated aim being to get the French king to intervene with Elizabeth on their behalf in relation to lands they claimed; but John and a few others returned to Ireland in July, and after examination he was allowed back to Imokilly. In November 1576 he was complaining of Desmond's levying of exactions upon his lands, but this did not affect his good relationship with the earl. John was pardoned three times in the 1570s for his actions&#151;in September 1574, May 1576, and May 1577.<br>
<br>In July 1579 fitz Maurice ignited the second Desmond rebellion (1579&#150;83) when he landed at Dingle with a force of approximately sixty men, declaring a religious war to rid Ireland of the heretical Queen Elizabeth. John fitz Edmund was to be extremely active over the next four years, proving an able and committed confederate of Desmond. He participated in the latter's attack on the town of Youghal in November 1579, and narrowly escaped death when Thomas Butler, tenth earl of Ormond, burnt Imokilly the following month. He was similarly fortunate in early 1580 when, during his escape from the siege of Strancally Castle across the Blackwater River, a number of men in his boat were killed while he was uninjured. He unsuccessfully attempted to ambush Sir Walter Ralegh in co. Cork in February 1581, and took part in a raid on the barony of Decies, co. Waterford, in mid-1581 in which the rebel forces were believed to number over 1300. By 1583, however, the tide had turned in favour of the crown forces under the command of Ormond, who before 5 May captured John's mother in co. Cork and had her executed. During the final year of the conflict attempts were made to use John to broker Desmond's submission, but these proved fruitless. With the rebellion virtually over, John submitted on 11 June 1583, Ormond subsequently praising him for his courage as an opponent and his honesty as a reformed rebel, and on 14 May 1585 he was pardoned. By then the decision had been taken to settle English planters in Munster, and over the next few years efforts were made to agree a division of Imokilly between planters and John. He was arrested soon after 8 March 1587 and placed in Dublin Castle, remaining there until January 1589 when he was again pardoned and informed he would receive the income of his lands for the period of his detention. Within days, however, the turbulent life of this key supporter of Desmond was over; he was dead by 26 January.<br>
