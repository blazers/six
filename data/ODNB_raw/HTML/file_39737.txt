<span class="headword">Rawlinson,  Alfred Edward John <span class="st"> [Jack]</span></span>  (1884&#150;1960), <span class="occ">bishop of Derby and theologian</span>, was born at Park Road, Newton-le-Willows, Lancashire, on 17 July 1884, the first son of Alfred John Rawlinson (<i>b</i>. 1865), accountant, and his second wife, Anna Margaret Marshall of Sekondi, Gold Coast. After education at Dulwich College, in 1900&#150;03, he became an exhibitioner and later scholar at Corpus Christi College, Oxford. Although his parents were Congregationalists he adopted a non-dogmatic Anglo-Catholicism at Oxford. After graduating with a first in mods and Greats in 1907, he won the Liddon and Denyer and Johnson scholarships, achieving a first in theology in 1908. He trained at Cuddesdon and was ordained to a tutorship at Keble in 1909, where he contributed to the controversial volume <span class="italic">Foundations</span> (1912). In 1913 he became lecturer in theology, and from 1914 to 1929 was student and tutor, at Christ Church. He was a popular tutor, visited by students with religious doubts who &#145;soon discovered that their &hellip; uncertainties were but a drop in the bucket compared with his, and departed much reassured&#146;  (H. Chadwick, 446). He was chaplain to the forces during 1915&#150;17, becoming priest-in-charge of St John's, Wilton Road, London (1917&#150;18). In 1919 he married Mildred Ansley Ellis (&#145;Cuckoo&#146;), daughter of the Revd Ansley Ellis, a missionary with the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel.<br>
<br>During the 1920s Rawlinson gave the Paddock lectures, published as <span class="italic">Authority and Freedom</span>, in New York (1923), contributed to <span class="italic">Essays Catholic and Critical</span> (1926), and edited <span class="italic">Essays on the Trinity and the Incarnation</span> (1928). He was well versed in German theology, assessing both Catholic modernism and liberal protestantism in his Bampton lectures, <span class="italic">The New Testament Doctrine of Christ</span> (1926). In 1925 he published his widely read textual commentary on <span class="roman">St Mark</span>, one of the first &#145;form-critical&#146; works in English. He took part in the Anglo-German theological conferences at Canterbury (1925), Wartburg (1928), and Chichester (1931), and continued to write on the authority of the church. He was much in demand as a lecturer and preacher, becoming select preacher at both Oxford (1923&#150;5, 1941&#150;2) and Cambridge (1924, 1928, 1937). He was awarded DDs at Oxford (1925) and Durham (1931), and served on the archbishops' doctrine commission from 1922. Nevertheless, he failed to secure both the Oxford Lady Margaret chair in 1927 (losing by two votes to his friend N. P. Williams) and the regius chair in 1943.<br>
<br>In 1929 Rawlinson became archdeacon of Auckland and canon of Durham under Hensley Henson, who found him &#145;able and amiable&#146;  (Henson, 2.250). Rawlinson's brand of liberal Catholicism, which denied any claim to absolute truth, made him a natural ecumenist, and in 1934 he helped establish ecumenical relations with the Finnish church. In 1936 he became second bishop of Derby, one of the few theologians on the bench. According to Michael Ramsey, &#145;If you walked from Humber to Severn and dodged Derby, you would not find a bishop who could read or write&#146;  (O. Chadwick, 76). His primary charge called for increased clergy discipline, which helped make him unpopular in the diocese. He seldom visited rural parishes and often dealt with pastoral matters in a heavy-handed fashion. He continued to play a leading role in ecumenical discussions with the free churches and the Church of Scotland, staunchly defended the Church of South India scheme, and was an official delegate to the Russian Orthodox church in 1956. He was a frequent speaker in the House of Lords, where, although maintaining conservative attitudes on moral issues, he was outspoken on social issues. He retired on 11 April 1959, dying at St Bartholomew's Hospital, London, on 17 July 1960. His ashes were interred at Derby Cathedral on 17 September.<br>
<br>Throughout his life Rawlinson remained a scholar, displaying an aloofness and shyness which made him unsuited to episcopal life. He was a man of contradictions: although he taught a liberal theology of authority he exercised episcopal authoritarianism; although he stressed religious experience, he was &#145;without an ounce of mysticism&#146;  (Dell, 154). A man of small stature, he was often overshadowed by his wife, an extrovert and dominant personality. Potentially one of the leading theologians of his generation, he was not served well by either his church or university.<br>
