<span class="headword">Hay,  George Campbell</span> <span class="st"> [Mac Iain De&ograve;rsa]</span>  (1915&#150;1984), <span class="occ">poet</span>, was born on 8 December 1915 at the manse, Elderslie, Renfrewshire, where his father was a minister. His father, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/40322/', "John MacDougall Hay (1879&#150;1919)")</script>, was born in Tarbert, Loch Fyne, and based his novel <span class="italic">Gillespie</span> there. George Campbell Hay regarded Tarbert and Kintyre as his home territory, frequently staying there, learning Gaelic in his teens, and sharing the life of the local fishermen. His mother, Catherine, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Campbell (<i>b</i>. 1883), had Islay connections, and had some knowledge of Gaelic. His father died in 1919 and the family lived in Edinburgh from 1925. In 1934 Hay won a major scholarship in classics and took a degree at Corpus Christi College, Oxford, afterwards taking a teacher's training course at Edinburgh and teaching briefly at the Royal High School there.<br>
<br>On the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939 Hay refused conscription (apparently on Scottish nationalist grounds, like his contemporary Douglas Young), spent some time &#145;on the run&#146; in the Argyll hills, and finally joined the Royal Army Ordnance Corps. During the war he served in north Africa, Italy, and Macedonia, where he learned modern Greek. He was suspected of acting as a communist agitator there, simply because of his friendship with Greek people, and suffered a violent attack. This led to his being invalided out of the army and to severe traumatization in later years, when he developed a drinking problem. He returned to Edinburgh, spending some time in hospitals, and working in the National Library of Scotland for some years.<br>
<br>A versatile linguist, Hay published poetry in Scots, English, and Gaelic, with occasional pieces in French and Norwegian, and he translated from modern Greek, Croatian, Arabic, Italian, Finnish, Icelandic, Irish, and Welsh. In his metrics he was deeply influenced by medieval and early modern Irish verse.<br>
<br>Hay's second book was <span class="italic">Wind on Loch Fyne</span> (1948), and it is here that he includes his wide-ranging translations, and also a good number of poems in Scots, whether on Loch Fyne and Kintyre subjects or on Edinburgh:<blockquote>
<div>A windy toon o cloods an' sunny glints;<br>
</div>
<div>pinnacled, turreted, stey an' steep grey toon;<br>
</div>
<div>her soughin' gables sing their norlan' rants<br>
</div>
<div>tae sant an' caller blufferts on her croon.<br>
</div>
</blockquote>Hay had published a Gaelic collection in the previous year: <span class="italic">Fuaran sl&egrave;ibh</span> (&#145;Upland spring&#146;) (1947), and this has some evocative poems on Kintyre and the Argyll countryside, as well as a series of poems modelled on Irish courtly love poetry and deeply influenced by its metrics. There are humorous and philosophic poems here too, and the highly effective &#145;Tilleadh Uiliseis&#146; (&#145;The return of Ulysses&#146;), a dramatic interpretation of the classical story.<br>
<br>Hay's next volume, <span class="italic">O na ceithir &agrave;irdean</span> (&#145;From the Four Airts&#146;) appeared in 1952, and here his war experiences, especially in north Africa, and his reflections on the devastation war has caused throughout Europe, are powerfully deployed, producing some of his most memorable poems such as &#145;Truaighe na h-E&ograve;rpa&#146; (&#145;Europe's wretchedness&#146;), &#145;Atman&#146;, and &#145;Bisearta&#146; (&#145;Bizerta&#146;). This collection also includes a large number of translations from Italian, Greek, Croatian, and Arabic verse.<br>
<br>Hay's reputation, especially as a Gaelic poet, became firmly established, but there was to be a long wait for another collection. He published spasmodically in periodicals, for example, in the <span class="italic">Akros</span> anthology of contemporary Gaelic verse (1976) and in <span class="italic">Gairm</span> over many years, latterly developing very effectively a series of poems/songs in the folk style, founded on surviving fragments. He also published Scots and English verse of a strongly nationalistic sort in the <span class="italic">Scots Independent</span>.<br>
<br>In the early 1980s it transpired that Hay had written a long poem or sequence in the latter part of the war and early post-war period (writing in Italy, Macedonia, and Tarbert), but had never completed it. He gave permission for this to be published in its unfinished state, and it appeared in 1982 under the title <span class="italic">Mocht&agrave;r is D&ugrave;ghall</span> (&#145;Mochtar and Dougall&#146;). The original purpose may have been to compare and contrast these two civilizations that had attracted him so strongly: the Arabic and Gaelic ones. But it is only the Arabic section that was virtually completed, while only preliminary sections of the Gaelic one were composed. This Arabic section gives an extraordinarily vivid and colourful account of three generations of an Arab family in the African desert and elsewhere, and this can well be regarded as Hay's most powerful achievement. It is fortunate that it has survived the sad but buoyant chaos of this poet's life. Hay died alone in his house, 6 Maxwell Street, Edinburgh, a victim of alcoholism, on 25 March 1984.<br>
