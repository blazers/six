<span class="headword">Martineau,  Russell</span>  (1831&#150;1898), <span class="occ">Hebraist and librarian</span>, was born on 18 January 1831 in Dublin, the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18229/', "James Martineau (1805&#150;1900)")</script>, Unitarian minister, and Helen (1804&#150;1877), eldest daughter of Edward Higginson. He was educated at home and in Germany before entering University College, London, where he gained a BA degree in 1850 and an MA in classics in 1854. However, his London affiliation was punctuated by studies at the universities of Berlin (whence his family had temporarily moved) and G&ouml;ttingen, where he studied under Heinrich Ewald. He continued his studies during the years 1854&#150;7, when he was employed as a private family tutor. By the time that he was appointed to the staff of the British Museum Library and to a lectureship in Hebrew at Manchester New College, London, in 1857, his linguistic accomplishments included Sanskrit, Arabic, and Persian, in addition to the classical languages and German.<br>
<br>It was typical of Martineau's all-round abilities that, though he was not employed in the British Museum in any area in which he had previously specialized, he none the less made a significant contribution to the work of the library; this was recognized by successive promotions until he reached the rank of assistant keeper in 1884. He retired from this post in 1896 in accordance with civil-service superannuation rules. At the library he specialized in early printed books: he collected first editions of Luther's works for the museum, contributed significantly to the scheme for cataloguing the library, and completed the heading &#145;<span class="roman">Bible</span>&#146; in the catalogue.<br>
<br>Martineau's appointment to Manchester New College was on the recommendation of Heinrich Ewald, who was the colossus of German <span class="roman">Old Testament</span> scholarship at that time, and Martineau was promoted to full professor in 1866, resigning from the college in 1874. Because Manchester New College had a strong, though not exclusive, unitarian tradition, Martineau was able to teach the results of critical scholarship freely, and there was probably no other lecture room at that time in Britain where students were kept so well informed of the latest results of critical research. His lecture notes indicate a strong dependence upon Ewald's moderately critical position, though the researches of Bishop J. W. Colenso, which called into question the historical accuracy of some <span class="roman">Old Testament</span> narratives and which proposed radical theories of the authorship of biblical books, were carefully assessed. Martineau was a presenter of critical scholarship rather than an original contributor to it, and his importance in the development of critical scholarship in Britain lay in his translation work. He took responsibility for the English translation of the first two volumes of Ewald's <span class="italic">History of Israel</span> (1867) and advised on the translation of later volumes, as the initiator and financial supporter of the project, Charlotte Lupton, wished to remain anonymous. In 1877 he published <span class="italic">Mythology among the Hebrews</span>, a translation of a work by Ignaz Goldziher. He also worked on the textual criticism of the <span class="roman">Song of Solomon</span>, on which he published two books, in 1892 and 1896, reprinted from articles in the <span class="italic">American Journal of Philology</span>.<br>
<br>Martineau appears to have had a complex, almost contradictory character. On the one hand there is abundant evidence of his wide interests and talents, for, in addition to the accomplishments already mentioned, Martineau was an expert conchologist, an enthusiastic botanist, and a considerable musician, in which latter capacity he helped to edit and compose new tunes for his father's <span class="italic">Hymns of Praise and Prayer</span> (1876). He also contributed to James Murray's <span class="italic">New English Dictionary</span> and published notes on the pronunciation of English vowels in the seventeenth century. Yet he seems to have had few social graces and few friends. As a teacher he did not appreciate the limitations of his students and was more effective in informal situations than in the lecture hall. Increasingly bad health, which interrupted his normal work, left its mark upon his appearance, and he developed a speech impediment that hindered him from expressing his thoughts fluently. A tendency to epilepsy is mentioned. At the same time those who came to know him well appreciated his humour, warm-heartedness, and loyalty. Martineau married Frances (<i>b</i>. 1836/7), daughter of Edward Bailey, an ironmonger, on 26 March 1861, and they enjoyed a relationship of mutual support and deep affection. There were no children. Martineau's latter years were marked by declining health and he died at Glen View, Sidmouth, Devon on 14 December 1898. He was survived by his wife.<br>
