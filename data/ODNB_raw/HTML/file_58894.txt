<span class="headword">Talbert,  Bruce James</span>  (1838&#150;1881), <span class="occ">architect and designer</span>, was born in Dundee, the son of a merchant, James Talbert. On leaving Dundee high school he was apprenticed first to a woodcarver called Millar and then to the architect Charles Edwards. His only known work in that area was heraldic decoration in the Kinnaird Hall, Dundee, now demolished. In 1856 Talbert moved to Glasgow, where he worked in two architectural practices: W. N. Tait of Govan and, from 1860, Campbell Douglas and Stevenson. During his time with the latter he was awarded two prizes: the Architectural Design medal and, in 1862, the Edinburgh Architectural Association medal, for a perspective drawing of a church belfry. In the same year he moved to Manchester to work for the cabinet-makers Doveston, Bird, and Hull. This proved a turning point in his career as a commercial designer, and within a short time his range of interests began to widen. Soon afterwards he took up a post in Coventry, designing silver and wrought-iron work for Francis Skidmore's Art Manufactures Company. He was employed as an &#145;architectural and perspective draughtsman and colourist&#146; at 4 guineas a week  (as advertised in <span class="italic">The Builder</span>, 18 Oct 1862) and his work included making detailed drawings from Sir George Gilbert Scott's designs for the gates of the Albert Memorial and the screen in Hereford Cathedral, one of the major exhibits of the 1862 International Exhibition (now in the V&amp;A). This is likely to have been Talbert's last salaried position, as there is evidence that he had already begun to work on a freelance basis before leaving Coventry for London in 1865 or 1866.<br>
<br>Talbert's reputation as a gifted and versatile designer began to develop. He succeeded in winning the competition for a new masthead for the <span class="italic">Building News</span>, which also published a number of his designs. In 1867 the prestigious firm of cabinet-makers Holland &amp; Co. commissioned him to design their stand at the Paris Exhibition, for which they were awarded the silver medal. At the time he was also supplying designs to the ecclesiastical firm of Cox &amp; Sons and, possibly, to Gillows of Lancaster. In the same year he published the first volume of his book <span class="italic">Gothic Forms Applied to Furniture, Metal Work and Decoration for Domestic Purposes</span>. The second volume was published in 1868 at Dundee, where he had returned to recover from a period of ill health. Dedicated to the architect G. E. Street, the publication was not the first book published to offer advice on the decoration of domestic interiors (C. L. Eastlake's <span class="italic">Hints on Household Taste</span> had appeared between 1864 and 1866) but proved more influential than its predecessors, as it was &#145;not so much addressed to the public as to the furniture trades&#146;  (Day, 194). It advised on the decor for each room in the house, including stained glass, furniture, carpeting, and drapery for decorating walls, ceilings, and floors. His overall aesthetic view even extended to the user, whose &#145;ever changing curves&#146; he believed would provide adequate contrast to the horizontals and verticals of the static decoration.<br>
<br>The book became influential with cabinet-makers, furnishers, and interior designers in Britain and America, and Talbert's &#145;style became immediately the fashion&#146;  (Day, 194). His favoured style was based on medieval decoration of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, as can be seen in his furniture designs of that time. He cautioned against copying medieval decoration, believing that it gave furniture an undesirable monumental character. Instead he rescaled gables, coves, columns, and trefoil arches, using angular brackets, trestles, and spindles, which he believed displayed honest construction regardless of functional form.<br>
<br>By 1870 Talbert had returned to London, and it was there that he set up a design studio with a number of assistants. Despite this he continued to list himself as an architect. He lived and worked from a number of different addresses, but in 1875 moved to 5 Euston Square, where he settled for the rest of his life with his wife, Amy Adkins, the daughter of a Birmingham maltster, whom he had married in the previous year. There he produced an enormous number of designs for many different manufacturers and shops. As well as for Holland &amp; Sons and Gillows he also produced furniture designs for Marsh, Jones, and Cribb, of Leeds, and for the London shops Collinson and Lock, and Jackson and Graham, for whom he designed the &#145;Juno&#146; cabinet (V&amp;A), which was a prizewinner at Paris in 1878. Of framed construction, his later furniture was decorated with pierced work, low-relief carving, geometric inlays, and occasional small enamels. He disliked veneer and the glossy finishes produced by French polish and staining.<br>
<br>Throughout the 1870s Talbert designed for many forms of the decorative arts. He worked briefly with Daniel Cottier, an old friend from his Glasgow days whose business produced furniture, stained glass, and tiles, and he continued to design metalwork, including Cox &amp; Sons' prize-winning Society of Arts entry in 1870, and cast iron for the Coalbrookdale Company.<br>
<br>In 1876 Talbert published his second book on interior design, <span class="italic">Examples of Ancient and Modern Furniture, Metalwork, Tapestries, Decoration etc</span>. This shows a marked change in the style advocated, from the Gothic of his earlier publication to a number of later historical influences, including &#145;Old English&#146;, Queen Anne, and Jacobean&#151;his favourite. The book finally established Talbert as one of the major commercial designers of the nineteenth century, &#145;recognised as the first man in his profession and various firms in London and the provinces competed for designs from his pencil&#146;  (<span class="italic">Cabinet Maker and Art Furnisher</span>, 2, 1 July 1881, 5).<br>
<br>Talbert's interests were not restricted to three-dimensional objects, and he designed a wide range of repeating patterns for wallpapers and textiles. He was astute in recognizing potentially fashionable trends and produced some of the most characteristic aesthetic movement designs of the 1870s and 1880s. These included his sunflower wallpapers for Jeffrey &amp; Co. (one of which won a gold medal in Paris in 1878) and a series of designs for woven silks. Though little is known today about Talbert's work for textile manufacturers this became a lucrative part of his studio's output. He sold designs for carpets to Brintons of Kidderminster, and for silk and woollen curtains and porti&egrave;res to Cowlishall, Nichol &amp; Co. of Manchester, J. W. and C. Ward of Halifax, and Templetons of Glasgow. All reveal the harmony of pattern and colour advocated in his publications. The silks made by Warners of Spitalfields, London, are quite different, and, like his wallpapers, show the influence of Japanese design, but depicted in a particularly British way with natural background foliage such as willow. He also designed embossed leathers and flocked papers as well as velvets and stamped plushes, examples of which have survived as upholstery on dining chairs.<br>
<br>It is not known how much of his studio's output of textile designs was Talbert's own work. George C. Hait&eacute;, George Charles, and Henry W. Batley were assistants who became popular and successful designers in their own right after they had left Talbert's employment. It is also doubtful that Talbert could have produced the bulk of designs credited to him in the later part of the 1870s, for on 28 January 1881 he died, of alcoholism, at his home in Euston Square. He was buried in Kensal Green cemetery on 1 February. He left his modest estate to his wife, Amy, who sold the house and contents in May of the same year. His artistic legacy proved far greater. His obituary in the <span class="italic">Building News</span> (reprinted in the <span class="italic">Cabinet Maker</span>) claimed that &#145;he made a name as a designer of furniture which has not been equalled in England since the days of Chippendale and Adams [<i>sic</i>]&#146;  (<span class="italic">Cabinet Maker and Art Furnisher</span>, 1 Aug 1881, 24&#150;5). This reputation did not diminish with his death, especially within the trades that he worked for. Manufacturers continued to use his designs, and his publications proved essential reading for new designers. Examples of his designs, furniture, and textiles are in the Victoria and Albert Museum, London.<br>
