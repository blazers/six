<span class="headword">Beresford,  William Marcus Joseph</span>  (1797/8&#150;1883), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born in Ireland on 17 April 1797, or possibly in 1798 after the death of his father. He was the youngest in the family of two sons and two daughters of Marcus Beresford MP (grandson of Marcus Beresford, first earl of Tyrone and counsel to the Irish revenue commissioners), and his wife, Lady Frances Arabella, daughter of Joseph Leeson, first earl of Milltown. His father died on 16 November 1797. He was educated at Eton College and St Mary Hall, Oxford, where he took his BA in 1819.<br>
<br>In 1822 he was commissioned as lieutenant in the 9th (Royal) Dragoons, transferring to the 12th lancers in 1826. He served in the Lisbon expedition of 1826 and retired on half pay in January 1831 with the rank of major. For some years he lived on his estate at Ballinastow in co. Wicklow, where he was high sheriff in 1835. After contesting Waterford City in 1837, he was elected MP for Harwich in 1841. He kept this seat until 1847, when he became MP for North Essex. In public life his guiding principles were protestantism and protectionism. He opposed the <span class="roman">Maynooth Bill</span> of Sir Robert Peel in 1845 and was made chief whip of the protectionist party early in 1846. As such he was responsible both for the retirement of Lord George Bentinck from its leadership in 1847, after his vote for Jewish emancipation, and for the resumption of the title &#145;Conservative&#146; for his party in 1848. While initially suspicious of Benjamin Disraeli, he recognized his talents and served loyally under him from 1849. In Lord Derby's ministry he became secretary for war (February&#150;December 1852) and was party manager in the following general election. Subsequent parliamentary inquiries into improper electoral practices involved him in some censure, and this enabled Disraeli, who never liked him, to make fresh arrangements for the management of the party in opposition. In 1859 Beresford headed a protest against the Derby ministry's Reform Bill but did not press his opposition to a vote. Defeat in the general election of 1865 ended his parliamentary career.<br>
<br>Under William IV and Victoria he held court appointments as groom of the privy chamber and from 1823 master of the tennis court. His several business interests included the chairmanship of the Northern Counties Union Railway and various directorships. A tall, rough, hot-tempered Irishman, given to profanity, Beresford was more popular with back-benchers than with his leaders. His encouragement to the tory press to take a strong protestant and anti-Peelite line contributed to the perpetuation of the 1846 disruption. He assisted nevertheless in keeping the protectionist party together in a difficult period, with few resources and little help from his leaders.<br>
<br>In 1833 he married Catherine, youngest daughter of George Robert Heneage, of Hainton Hall, Lincolnshire; they had two sons and a daughter. Beresford died at his home, 40 Eccleston Square, London, on 6 October 1883.<br>
