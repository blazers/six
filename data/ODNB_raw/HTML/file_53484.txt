<span class="headword">Fland <span class="st"> [Flanders]</span>,  Robert</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1335&#150;1370), <span class="occ">logician</span>, may have been of Flemish origin. He has left three treatises (<span class="italic">Consequentiae</span>, <span class="italic">Insolubilia</span>, and <span class="italic">Obligationes</span>), preserved in codex 497 of the Stadsbibliothek at Bruges. This manuscript provides most of the very limited information there is concerning Fland. The explicits of each of these surviving treatises speak of them as works of Robert Fland, or simply Fland. Fland in each case is followed by an abbreviation sign, suggesting that Fland is an abbreviation&#151;perhaps for Flandriae, that is Robert of Flanders. Fland's <span class="italic">Insolubilia</span> fixes the dates within which he wrote. This work quotes the opening chapter of William Heytesbury's <span class="italic">Regulae solvendi sophismata</span>, written in 1335, and seems itself to be quoted by Ralph Strode in his <span class="italic">De insolubilibus</span>, produced about 1370. It is most likely that all three treatises were written, then, between 1335 and 1370. The sources and uses of his work also suggest that he was associated with Oxford University.<br>
<br>Fland's <span class="italic">Consequentiae</span> shows a dependence on William Ockham for its theory of material consequences, where the consequence holds precisely because of the terms which make up a consequent, and not because of the logical structure of the discourse. This happens in the case, for instance, where there exists a necessary consequent. A necessary consequent is true because of the necessary truth its terms express, no matter what the antecedent might be: for instance, &#145;If a man is running, God exists&#146;. Fland's <span class="italic">Obligationes</span> presents a history of the competing theories concerning &#145;obligations&#146;. The traditional theory or <i>antiqua responsio</i>, held by William Sherwood, Walter Burley, Ralph Strode, Albert von Sachsen, Pierre d'Ailly, and Paolo da Pergola, accentuated the importance of the order in which the opponent presented his statements, and this order set the stage for determining the correctness of the respondent's reply. The <i>nova responsio</i>, defended by Roger Swineshead and his close follower, Richard Lavenham, plays down the order in which the statements are presented, since the new response has developed rules that render the order of subsequent statements irrelevant. Although the old response remained dominant, Fland saw the new position of Swineshead as just as plausible as the old procedure.<br>
<br>Fland also traces two traditions in his <span class="italic">Insolubilia</span>, and finds each of them equally acceptable. The first tradition (represented for example by Thomas Bradwardine) contends that an insoluble is a statement that declares in the first place and principally what in reality is the case (for instance, &#145;I am a liar&#146;), and also signifies <i>ex consequenti</i> or secondarily that the statement is a true statement. The second tradition (represented for example by Richard Swineshead) holds an insoluble statement to be one that likewise declares in the first place and principally what is in reality the case, and <i>ex consequenti</i> or secondarily signifies something that is otherwise than what is in reality the case. From a study of his works it seems that Robert Fland fills in some gaps in our information concerning the topics discussed in these three treatises, as they were presented in the mid-fourteenth century. The positions he holds, although not original, are referred to by a few contemporary authors; yet the present state of knowledge indicates that he is not cited by name, and thus that the positions could be ones which he held in common with others.<br>
