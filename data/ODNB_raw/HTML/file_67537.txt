<span class="headword">Gifford <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Galpin]</span>,  Hannah</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1629&#150;1668), <span class="occ">schoolmistress</span>, was one of at least five children of Bernard Galpin (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1565) of Dorchester, Dorset, shoemaker. In 1629 she married Robert Gifford, also of Dorchester and, like her family, a member of the town's self-consciously &#145;godly&#146; community. When her father, several siblings, and numerous kin sailed on the <i>Mary and John</i> to New England in 1630, Hannah and her husband remained behind. They brought up several children in some degree of poverty: in the 1640s Robert Gifford was a recipient of Richard Bushrod's bequest, distributed annually to the godly poor.<br>
<br>As part of its drive for spiritual and moral reformation in the town, in October 1651 the corporation of Dorchester decided to establish a school for the education of poor children. Hannah was selected as teacher, and allocated a salary of &pound;10 a year if there were fewer than thirty children attending and &pound;12 if there were more. In the event, the school was instantly popular, and numbers had to be restricted to sixty, although a few dropped out once they had received free new clothing. Hannah proved a conscientious schoolmistress: &#145;she taught reading and later the catechism, being commended by the Corporation for her &#147;extraordinary pains&#148; in this&#146;  (Underdown, 225). The school, supplied by local booksellers John Long and William Churchill with books and bibles paid for by the corporation from donations given at gunpowder treason anniversary services, &#145;was one of the most striking achievements of puritan Dorchester&#146;  (ibid., 226). It was still functioning with Hannah as teacher in 1668, but by 1676 it seems to have discontinued. It is not known when Hannah died.<br>
