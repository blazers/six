<span class="headword">Thrale,  Henry</span>  (1728&#150;1781), <span class="occ">brewer and politician</span>, was the only son of Ralph Thrale (<i>d</i>. 1758), a wealthy brewer of Southwark who was master of the Brewers' Company, high sheriff of Surrey, and MP for Southwark in 1741&#150;7. Thrale's grandfather was a &#145;yeoman&#146; of Offley, Hertfordshire. Thrale's father was head clerk of the Anchor Brewery in Southwark, a leading London brewery founded in 1616. He doubtless secured the appointment through family connections: he was a cousin of Anne Halsey, sister of the then owner of the Anchor, Edmund Halsey, and subsequently his heir, who married Richard Temple, first Baron Cobham, uncle to the Grenvilles and the Lytteltons. After a number of years Ralph Thrale was able to buy the brewery for &pound;30,000 from Anne Halsey's executors, paying for it out of the profits over eleven years.<br>
<br>Ralph Thrale's lavish social spending caused some attrition to the business, which was increased under his son, who, unlike other prominent brewers such as Samuel Whitbread and Benjamin Truman, was born and brought up to affluence in the trade. Henry Thrale was sent to University College, Oxford, in 1744 (at the age of fifteen) with the princely allowance of &pound;1000 p.a., and thereafter on a grand tour in the company of W. H. Lyttelton (Lord Westcote), who had family links with the Thrales. Henry nevertheless developed an ambition to become the greatest brewer in London.<br>
<br>When Ralph Thrale died in 1758 the assets of the firm were valued at &pound;56,200 (a considerable decline over recent years) and annual output was 32,600 barrels, the Anchor Brewery lying about sixth in the league table of London porterhouses. Great expansion then ensued to a temporary peak of 87,000 barrels in 1778, when only Samuel Whitbread and John Calvert remained ahead of Thrale. Expansion, however, was far from smooth. Extravagant spending caused a series of crises within the family, particularly when coinciding with business depressions (1772), boom conditions (1778), and a personal crisis compounding Thrale's own health, and the death and bankruptcy in June 1779 of his brother-in-law, Arnold Nesbitt, to whom Thrale was said to be committed financially for over &pound;200,000. On these occasions both Thrale's family and his wife's relations helped out with loans.<br>
<br>Thrale married Hester Lynch Salusbury (1741&#150;1821) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22309/', "Piozzi, Hester Lynch")</script>], a fashionable, literary lady with good family connections, on 11 October 1763 (supposedly at the urging of her uncle, Sir Thomas Salusbury, as the condition of his making a settlement on her). Henry and Hester Thrale had two sons, the elder dying in 1776 aged nine and the younger in 1775 aged two, and ten daughters. Only five daughters survived to benefit from Thrale's will, each receiving &pound;20,000. The eldest daughter, Hester Maria [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8743/', "Elphinstone, Hester Maria")</script>], became Viscountess Keith.<br>
<br>The Thrales lived in style with a house at the brewery (which Mrs Thrale hated), a country house at Streatham Place, a hunting box (with a pack of hounds) near Croydon, and a further property at Brighton. Thrale was elected MP for the borough of Southwark in December 1765 having failed previously as a candidate for Abingdon and Camelford. He kept his seat at Southwark, almost a fief of the brewery, until defeated in 1780, when he was already prostrate and dying. As an MP he voted regularly with the administration but spoke mainly on brewing matters.<br>
<br>The Thrales were &#145;an ill-assorted couple: she, highly intelligent, with literary ambitions, hard and masculine, yet sentimental; he, matter-of-fact and unemotional, though kindly, sensual and a glutton &hellip; he could not be her hero, and she felt wasted on him&#146;  (HoP, <span class="italic">Commons</span>, 529). Although Thrale may have elicited such a harsh judgement from his wife, Samuel Johnson described his manners as those &#145;of a plain independent English squire&#146;  (ibid., 529). Thrale's friendship with Johnson began in 1764 through Hester Thrale, who made Southwark and Streatham Place lively literary salons. Johnson lived with the Thrales for periods at a time and accompanied them on various tours in England and to France. At times of crisis, and then as executor following Thrale's death, Johnson was drawn into the affairs of the brewery, assisting Mrs Thrale, who perforce had to cope with the business in alliance with the salaried manager, John Perkins.<br>
<br>Thrale had an apoplectic nature, from over-indulgence, which meant that he was threatened with seizures at times of stress in the brewery. He suffered a severe attack in June and again in the autumn of 1779, with a further stroke on 21 February 1780 from which he never fully recovered. The economic effects of the Anglo-American War were damaging the trade but a more immediate crisis arrived in June, when Thrale was in Brighton. At one point during the Gordon riots a mob attacked the brewery, but John Perkins placated them with porter until the troops arrived.<br>
<br>The lack of a male heir at Thrale's death on 4 April 1781 forced the sale of the brewery. As Johnson commented, &#145;what can misses do with a brewhouse. Lands are fitter for daughters than trade&#146;  (Boswell, 2, 69). Johnson presided over the sale as an executor (&#145;we are not here to sell a parcel of boilers and vats but the potentiality of becoming rich beyond the dreams of avarice&#146;  (ibid., 397), and the brewery was bought for &pound;135,000 by John Perkins and the rich Quaker relatives of his wife&#151;Robert Barclay, David Barclay, and Sylvanus Bevan.<br>
<br>The Anchor Brewery prospered mightily under this new family dispensation. It took the lead in the London porter trade after 1800, Quaker dynasties like the Hanburys and the Buxtons at the Black Eagle Brewery in Spitalfields providing greater direct family continuity than either Thrale or Truman.<br>
