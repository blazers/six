<span class="headword">Fermor <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Jeffreys]</span>,  Henrietta Louisa</span>, countess of Pomfret  (1698&#150;1761), <span class="occ">letter writer and diarist</span>, was born on 15 November 1698 at Lisle Street, Leicester Square, London, the only surviving child of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/14704/', "John Jeffreys, second Baron Jeffreys (bap. 1673, d. 1702)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/14702/', "Jeffreys, George, first Baron Jeffreys")</script>], and his wife, Lady Charlotte Herbert (1674/5&#150;1733), daughter and heir of Philip, seventh earl of Pembroke and fourth earl of Montgomery.<br>
<br>Henrietta's drunkard father's death in 1702, her mother's remarriage to Thomas, Lord Windsor, fifteen months later (which produced five children), and her own attentive mothering of ten offer insight into an otherwise under-documented childhood. Her diaries do report that, though baptized by Bishop Thomas Sprat, she &#145;unwillingly&#146; attended Roman Catholic mass with her mother until Lady Charlotte &#145;renounced the errors of the Church of Rome&#146; in 1718  (Finch MS DG7/D4 ii, entered after her mother's death in 1733). One apparent outcome was Henrietta's active concern with convents and churches both Anglican and Roman, during extended continental sojourns with her own family.<br>
<br>On 14 July 1720 in London, Henrietta married Thomas Fermor, second Baron Leominster (1698?&#150;1753), and travelled next day to his home at Easton Neston, Northamptonshire. Their first child, Sophia, was born on 29 May 1721 at their new London home in Hanover Square; Thomas was created earl of Pomfret, or Pontefract, Yorkshire, on 27 December 1721. The prince and princess of Wales were godparents to their second child, George, and Henrietta herself was named lady of the bedchamber to the princess in May 1725, her husband KB the next month and master of the horse to Queen Caroline on 28 October 1727. In 1732 their two eldest children starred with other titled pre-teens reciting Dryden in that <span class="italic">Performance of The Indian Emperor, or, The Conquest of Mexico</span> painted by Hogarth. Other courtly functions&#151;accompanying Princess Amelia to Bath and Tunbridge Wells, waiting as lady of the bedchamber on Princess Augusta of Wales at her 1736 wedding&#151;allowed the Pomfrets, under assumed names, a month's appetizing tour of Leiden, Brussels, and sundry attractions of the Low Countries, during June and July 1736.<br>
<br>On Caroline's death in 1737 the Pomfrets and Henrietta's friend Frances, countess of Hertford, retired from court. With three sons surviving and six daughters, a reduced income, and some debts, financial prudence prompted the Pomfrets to begin in September 1738 a three-year continental residence with their eldest daughters, Sophia and Charlotte. This initiated a correspondence which created a closer rapport between Henrietta and Lady Hertford and Lady Mary Wortley Montagu. Sojourns of several months each at Monts near Paris, at Siena, and then Florence, enabled the family to exchange hospitality with local as well as touring celebrities&#151;notably Lady Mary, Lord Lincoln, and Horace Walpole, at the Pomfrets' leased Florentine residence, the Palazzo Ridolfi, via della Scala 75. Unknown to Lady Henrietta, her friendship at this uncertain period in Lady Mary's relationship with Algarotti seems (for Pomfret letters are lost) to have proved steadying. Pomfret's letters to Hertford assumed fresh energy and keenness for details from March to July 1741, as her family and entourage returned via Rome, Venice, Bolsano, Augsburg, the Rhine, and Brussels, to their home in New Bond Street, London. Her diaries record a briefer trip to France for her health in 1749.<br>
<br>Her husband's death on 8 July 1753 enabled their spendthrift son George, as second earl of Pomfret, so to reduce his estate that Lady Henrietta bought from him the 135 statues or fragments of the Arundelian collection purchased by his paternal grandfather. Her gift of these to Oxford University in 1755 occasioned a warm response. On her death, in Marlborough, Wiltshire, on 17 December 1761, <i>en route</i> for Bath, she was buried on 2 January 1762 not with her husband at Easton Neston, as she requested in her will, but in St Mary's Church, Oxford.<br>
<br>During the 1730s Lady Pomfret's diary had named, by rank, some 230 female acquaintances, describing the auspices of each introduction  (DG7/D4 ii). That circle was enlarged by the publication in 1772 of two of her letters, then in 1805 by three volumes of the <span class="italic">Correspondence between Frances, countess of Hartford &hellip; and Henrietta Louisa &hellip; between &hellip; 1738 and 1741</span>. Well-bred posturings and S&eacute;vign&eacute;-esque banter wane as this epistolary relationship palpably warms, both women confronting their ageing. Walpole's constant scorn (even after her burial) for Pomfret's humourless intellectual pretensions merits measurement against these two correspondents' candid respect for non-aristocratic women achievers they had met: Elizabeth Carter, the Bolognese philosophy professor Dr Laura Bassi, the Venetian painter Rosalba Carriera. Pomfret's concern about her own ancestry and her daughters' marriages, and Walpole's mockery of that, may both stem from the brutalities of her grandfather Judge Jeffreys. Her diary's library inventory, and straightforward accounts of taking leave of Queen Caroline in 1736, with her own stormy channel crossing thereafter, exemplify an intelligence that can readily be reconciled with Walpole's unverifiable attributions to her of unpublished work on a translation of Froissart, and a study of Van Dyck's life and art.<br>
