<span class="headword">Blomefylde <span class="st"> [Blomefield]</span>,  Myles</span>  (1525&#150;1603), <span class="occ">medical practitioner and alchemist</span>, was born on 5 April 1525 in Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, the son of John Blomefilde and his wife, Anne. He is said to have been a scholar at St John's College, Cambridge, but records show only that in 1552 the university awarded him a licence to practise medicine. His father died in 1549, leaving him and his mother as executors of a small estate. By 1559 he must have married and been resident in Bury, since his daughter Elizabeth was baptized in St Mary's Church on 16 September that year. Sometime in the 1560s he probably moved his medical practice to Chelmsford, Essex, though 1568 saw him in Venice. Certainly by 1572 he was securely established in Chelmsford; in the 1570s he often served as juror in manorial courts, and between 1582 and 1590 was a prominent churchwarden. In the 1591 survey of the manor of Chelmsford he is &#145;Myles Blomefielde, gent&#146;  (Essex RO, D/bnp1), holding a substantial house and 10 acres of land adjoining the churchyard, as a freehold of the manor.<br>
<br>For centuries after his death, Blomefylde's annotated collection of alchemical manuscripts led him to be mistakenly identified with an admired alchemist and probable kinsman, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/53658/', "William Blomfild")</script>. Myles himself was a &#145;cunning man&#146; whose felonious activities&#151;prophesying the recovery of a certain George Freeman's mare and showing in a looking-glass the stealer of one Sybil Brown's laundry&#151;brought him before the Essex court of quarter sessions in 1578. The legal repercussions of his soothsaying are unknown, but the future churchwarden and &#145;gentleman&#146; apparently incurred no enduring ill repute.<br>
<br>Blomefylde's importance lies mainly in his small but significant book collection. Beyond the alchemical manuscripts that he copied, illustrated, and annotated, he owned some unique late medieval dramatic manuscripts, the only complete copy of Medwall's <span class="italic">Fulgens and Lucres</span> (printed by J. Rastell, <i>c</i>.1513&#150;19), and some twenty other volumes (devotional and polemical works, prose narratives, books on language, travel, history, mathematics, medicine, and surgery). Notes in his Sarum <span class="italic">horae</span> imply that he was once a devout Roman Catholic, and his possession of manuscript plays such as &#145;Mary Magdalen&#146; may suggest, even during his years as an Anglican churchwarden, a continuing affection for the old faith. From his varied library and its characteristically flamboyant and self-referential marginalia, and from his circumstantial and sometimes pompous churchwarden's accounts, Blomefylde emerges as a person intellectually curious and self-concerned, rather smugly proud of his community, and quite pleased with his substantial place in it. He died at his home in Chelmsford in 1603 and was buried at the parish church there on 29 November 1603.<br>
