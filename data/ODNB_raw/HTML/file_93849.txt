<span class="headword">Young,  Percy Marshall</span>  (1912&#150;2004), <span class="occ">music teacher and writer</span>, was born on 17 May 1912 at 12 David Street, Northwich, Cheshire. His father, William Joseph Young, was a clerk in a chemical works and was twice mayor of the town, and his mother, Annie, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Marshall, was later a Conservative Party councillor. He was educated at Sir John Deane's Grammar School in Northwich before winning a scholarship to Christ's Hospital, near Horsham, Sussex. In 1930 he went as an organ scholar to Selwyn College, Cambridge, where he read English, history, and music, graduating BA in 1933 and MusB in 1934. His first job was as director of music at the Stranmillis teacher training college in Belfast. On 7 August 1937, at Loughbrickland, co. Down, he married Anna Letitia (Netta) Carson, the daughter of James Carson, schoolteacher; they had three sons and a daughter. In the same year the family left Northern Ireland following Young's appointment as music adviser to the local education authority of Stoke-on-Trent. He stayed until 1944 when he was appointed director of music at Wolverhampton College of Technology. There he not only developed a choir specializing in some of the lesser-known works of Handel but began a series of choral and orchestral concerts together with broadcasts on the BBC on music in schools. It was during the twenty-two years he spent at Wolverhampton that he began a writing and publishing career that produced over fifty books, many of them brought out by the publisher Dennis Dobson, with whom Young formed a lasting relationship.<br>
<br>An early work was the volume on Handel in Dent's <span class="roman">Master Musician series</span> (1947), which was followed by books on a range of composers including Thomas Arne, Ralph Vaughan Williams, Robert Schumann, Zolt&aacute;n Kod&aacute;ly, and Arthur Sullivan. He also produced <span class="italic">A Concise History of British Music</span> (1974) and many short guides for younger readers whose subjects included Beethoven, Britten, Handel, and Mozart. His <span class="italic">The Bachs, 1500&#150;1850</span> (1970) was a substantial work. Young had a long-standing fascination with Edward Elgar that was reflected in his life and works study, <span class="italic">Elgar OM</span> (1955), and underlined when he edited two collections of Elgar's letters, the first published in 1956 and the second in 1965. He also produced a volume of the lectures that Elgar delivered while professor of music at the University of Birmingham. He wrote a biography of Elgar's wife, <span class="italic">Alice Elgar, Enigma of a Victorian Lady</span> (1977), and worked for many years from the brief notes and jottings that Elgar left to complete his unfinished opera <span class="italic">The Spanish Lady</span>, which was performed for the first time, to mixed reviews, at the Cambridge Elgar Festival in 1994. When the <span class="italic">New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians</span> was launched Young not only contributed several of the entries but was also commissioned to write an accompanying biography of its Victorian founder, Sir George Grove, published in 1980.<br>
<br>For much of his time at Wolverhampton Young was also actively engaged in composition. At least twenty of his works were published, including a concerto for two pianos (1954), a <span class="italic">Festival Te Deum</span> (1961), and the <span class="italic">Elegy</span> for string orchestra. This last work was commissioned for the 1960 Zwickau Festival in Germany and was played at the composer's ninetieth birthday celebrations in 2002. A good orchestrator and arranger, Young was still producing scholarly works up to his death, including a catalogue of the musical holdings of Lichfield Cathedral and a two-volume edition of the Gilbert and Sullivan opera <span class="italic">HMS Pinafore</span>.<br>
<br>But music was not Young's only passion. In football it had a competitor for his enthusiasm, especially during the first six decades of his life. Young had supported Northwich Victoria in the Cheshire league as a boy in the 1920s. Living in Staffordshire for much of his life gave him the opportunity to follow Port Vale, Stoke City, and eventually Wolverhampton Wanderers. He liked to stand on the terraces but how he could do that and read Somerset Maugham at half-time on those packed grounds he never explained. He wrote his first two short books on the game in the early 1950s, at a time when football seemed unalterably working class. Sir Stanley Rous, secretary of the Football Association, was worried about the division between sport and culture and conscious that the educated &eacute;lites had been deserting the sport. One reason was that, unlike cricket, it had not been buttressed by a literature that claimed it was an art. Young thought it was and in <span class="italic">The Appreciation of Football</span> (1951) and <span class="italic">Football Facts and Fancies</span> (1950) he began the sport's long day's journey into art. Young was football's Neville Cardus; he compared full-backs with bass singers, thought tenors like centre-forwards, and referees like orchestral conductors. His style was whimsical and he had a gift for the pungent anecdote. Later he would make the first attempt at a more serious history that placed football in its socio-cultural context or, as he put it, &#145;relating one national institution to every other sort of institution&#146;  (<span class="italic">A History of British Football</span>, 1968, xii). It was one of thirteen books he wrote about the people's game.<br>
<br>Percy Young had great energy and industry, producing a phenomenal amount of work in his long life. He was an organist, scholar, editor, composer, teacher, adjudicator, writer, and broadcaster; his astonishing output of books may not have achieved the height of scholarship reached by his successors but they were always readable and easy to digest. It is no criticism to say that he was a great popularizer who undoubtedly influenced, inspired, and nurtured many generations of musicians, and also many more general readers. He also found the time to be, briefly, a Labour Party councillor in Wolverhampton and an active school governor, and he chaired the local community relations committee. He was the recipient of many honours, including the freedom of Halle (2002), whose Handel Festival he attended consecutively for forty years, an honorary doctorate of music from the University of Birmingham (1985), and an honorary fellowship of Selwyn College, Cambridge (1998). Following the death of his first wife, in 1969 he married Ren&eacute;e Morris. He died on 9 May 2004 at York Hospital, having contracted pneumonia after an operation on a broken thigh. He was survived by his wife and his four children from his first marriage.<br>
