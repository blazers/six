<span class="headword">Orger <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Ivers]</span>,  Mary Ann</span>  (1788&#150;1849), <span class="occ">actress</span>, was born in London on 25 February 1788, one of the three daughters of William Ivers, a musician in a provincial company. Her mother was occasionally seen on the stage with her husband in Henry Thornton's company, and carried her infant daughter on as the child in <span class="italic">King Henry VIII</span>. The first record of Mary Ann performing is on a bill of the Newbury Theatre when she was five, as the Boy in <span class="italic">Children in the Wood</span>, although she had probably already acted several other parts under her father's instruction. She played this role for several years. When she was about nine years old she sang in concerts in Brighton and at about eleven was the Gypsy at a f&ecirc;te given by Queen Charlotte at Frogmore. She then acted with Thornton, and appeared in Croydon, Reading, Windsor, Gosport, Newbury, and Chelmsford. George III was a frequent visitor to the Windsor theatre at this time. When she was fifteen, in 1803, Thomas Orger, the son of George Orger of High Wycombe, and a man of literary tastes, fell in love with her. He was a Quaker and had to renounce this affiliation when he married her in July 1804. He agreed to her returning to the stage, and she played in 1805 in Glasgow with Master Betty and in Edinburgh, where her benefit on the last night of the season, 7 May 1806, brought her &pound;78. She also performed in other Scottish towns. In Glasgow in the summer of 1807 she appeared as Caroline Sedley in James Kenney's <span class="italic">False Alarm</span> at Rosoman Mountain's benefit.<br>
<br>Mrs Orger met John Bannister in Aberdeen in the summer of 1808 and played Nell to his Jobson in <span class="italic">The Devil to Pay</span> and Ann Lovely to his Colonel Feignwell in <span class="italic">A Bold Stroke for a Wife</span>. He recommended her for Drury Lane, and she made her first appearance there as Lydia Languish in <span class="italic">The Rivals</span> on 4 October 1808. She remained at Drury Lane until 1831, while also taking engagements at minor theatres during the summer months. After the destruction of the theatre by fire on 24 February 1809 she went with the company to the Lyceum, where she played an original part in <span class="italic">Temper, or, The Domestic Tyrant</span>. On 20 November 1809 she was the original Mrs Lovell in <span class="italic">Not at Home</span>, and she had another original part, as Madge in S. J. Arnold's comic opera <span class="italic">Up All Night, or, The Smuggler's Cave</span>. She distinguished herself as Patty Larkins in <span class="italic">The Highgate Tunnel</span> in 1812. A dispute then arose between her and the management of Drury Lane, who prohibited her from appearing at the Lyceum; her correspondence with Arnold and Douglas Kinnaird MP of the management was published. When the Victoria Theatre opened Mrs Orger performed there, but at the same time continued at Drury Lane and at the Haymarket, where she was the original Mrs Sophia Smith in <span class="italic">Mrs Smith, or, The Wife and the Widow</span>. On leaving Drury Lane she was engaged by Madame Vestris for the Olympic, where she was, in 1832, Mrs Deputy Butts in Dance's farce <span class="italic">The Water Party</span>. She remained there during Madame Vestris's management, playing with complete success a series of parts suited to her talents, which included a capacity for imitating various local accents. She moved with Madame Vestris to Covent Garden, and just before the sudden closing of the theatre in 1843 she attempted what was for her a new type of character, Old Lady Lambert in Isaac Bickerstaff's <span class="italic">The Hypocrite</span>.<br>
<br>When the Strand Theatre opened under Maywood, Mrs Orger accepted an engagement which she was prevented by illness from fulfilling, and shortly afterwards, in 1845, her physician recommended that she retire from the stage. The Drury Lane Theatrical Fund provided her with a pension of &pound;120 a year, which enabled her to enjoy in comfort the company of her numerous circle of friends and literary men of the day. She was herself the author of a farce, <span class="italic">Change Partners</span>, which was produced at Drury Lane on 10 March 1825. She died on 1 October 1849. She left one daughter, Caroline [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/59338/', "Reinagle, Caroline")</script>], a pianist and composer. Mary Ann Orger was very pretty, above medium height, with a fair complexion, light brown hair, and hazel eyes.<br>
