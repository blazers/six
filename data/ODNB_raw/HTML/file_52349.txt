<span class="headword">Eadgifu <span class="st"> [Eddeua]</span> the Fair <span class="st"> [the Rich]</span></span>  (<em>fl. </em>1066), <span class="occ">magnate</span>, held over 270 hides of land (or the equivalent) on the eve of the conquest, making her one of the richest English magnates at that time and giving rise to her alternative name of Eadgifu the Rich. Most of her estates lay in Cambridgeshire, but she also held property in Buckinghamshire, Hertfordshire, Essex, and Suffolk, and men whose lands were tributary to other magnates took her as their lord. Her estates passed after 1066 to Ralph de Gael. It has been suggested that Eadgifu was his mother, and wife to Ralph the Staller, but the <span class="roman">Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</span> specifically says that Ralph de Gael's mother was a Breton. One of Eadgifu's manors was Mentmore, in Buckinghamshire, and she might be the widow (or perhaps daughter) of Leofwine of Mentmore, whom the <span class="roman">Domesday Book</span> mentions in passing.<br>
<br>It has also been suggested that Eadgifu was the first wife (or mistress) of Harold Godwineson [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/12360/', "Harold II")</script>]. The chronicle of Waltham Abbey, of which Harold was patron, describes how his body was identified on the field of Hastings by his former concubine, Eadgyth Swanneshals (&#145;Edith Swanneck&#146;). Although Eadgifu and Eadgyth are different names, the forms (Eddeua and Eddid or Edied respectively) are sometimes confused, and the abbey of St Benet of Hulme, Norfolk, which had close connections with Harold, remembered an Eadgifu Swanneshals among its patrons. An unnamed concubine of Harold's held property in Canterbury, but this need not be Eadgifu the Fair; he probably had more than one.<br>
<br>
<span class="roman">Domesday Book</span> gives some indications of a connection between Eadgifu the Fair and Harold: she held a manor in the vill of Harkstead, Suffolk, land which was attached to Harold's manor of Brightlingsea, Essex; and some of the Suffolk lands held by her men were tributary to Harold's manor of East Bergholt. Moreover, when Earl Ralph de Gael forfeited his property in 1075, most of Eadgifu's land went to Count Alan Rufus (Alan the Red), lord of Richmond, Yorkshire, who in 1093 carried off Gunnhild, Harold's daughter, from Wilton. When Count Alan died soon afterwards, Gunnhild became the mistress of his brother and heir, Alan Niger (Alan the Black), though Archbishop Anselm attempted to dissuade her. If Gunnhild was the child of Harold's first wife, and if the identification of that wife with Eadgifu the Fair is accepted, then she was the heir of Eadgifu, whose lands Alan Rufus held. It is odd that Gunnhild was not taken to Denmark by her grandmother Gytha along with her sister, the younger Gytha, in 1068; but Gunnhild apparently suffered from a tumour of the eyes, healed by Wulfstan of Worcester (<i>d</i>. 1095), which might explain why she was left at Wilton.<br>
