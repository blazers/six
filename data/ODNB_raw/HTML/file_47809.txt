<span class="headword">Devas,  Charles Stanton</span>  (1848&#150;1906), <span class="occ">political economist</span>, was born on 26 August 1848 at Long Ditton, Surrey, the second son of William Devas (<i>d</i>. 1870), a merchant, later of Old Windsor, Berkshire, and his wife, Martha Anne (<i>d</i>. 1894), daughter of Charles Stanton of Upfield, Stroud, Gloucestershire. He was educated at Eton College and from 1867 at Balliol College, Oxford, where he graduated in 1871 with first-class honours in the school of law and modern history. He entered Lincoln's Inn (1870) but was never called to the bar. The rest of his life was devoted to study, writing, and lecturing. He had become a Roman Catholic in 1867 and in 1876 was appointed as tutor in constitutional history and political economy at the short-lived Catholic University College in Kensington, founded by Cardinal Manning. He remained there until 1878 but did not obtain a professorship, although he is usually referred to as being professor of political economy. It seems that his only other salaried post was as external examiner in political economy at the Royal University of Ireland, a position he held for nine years. In 1874 he married Eliza Mary Katherine, daughter of Francis Ridout Ward of 26 Hyde Park Street, Westminster; they lived in London at 8 Inverness Gardens, Kensington, and had six sons and two daughters. Three of the sons became Roman Catholic priests and served as chaplains in the First World War, during which they won awards for gallantry; all three were appointed OBE after the war. A fourth son, Bertrand, became a writer and was for a time assistant editor of the <span class="italic">Dublin Review</span>.<br>
<br>Devas's most ambitious work was his <span class="italic">Groundwork of Economics</span>, published in 1883; the most influential was his <span class="italic">Political Economy</span>, published in 1892. This went into a third, revised, edition in 1907 (prepared by the author just before his death) and was also translated into German; it was recommended for many years by the Catholic Social Guild. Other subjects covered in his books and pamphlets included the Christian family, the historical importance of the Catholic church, the relationship between labour and capital, socialism, Christian democracy, and free trade. He contributed articles and reviews to the <span class="italic">Dublin Review</span>, the <span class="italic">International Journal of Ethics</span>, and the <span class="italic">Economic Journal</span>, and presented papers to the British Association (in 1894 and 1901), the Manchester Statistical Society, and various Catholic conferences.<br>
<br>Devas was concerned to find an alternative to both socialism and <i>laissez-faire</i> individualism. He admitted that socialism had a number of attractive features, and there is a welcome absence from his writings of the simplistic dismissal of it frequently found in contemporary Catholic writings. He was no dreamy-eyed medievalist and welcomed modern industrialized society; the challenge was to structure it so as to benefit all its citizens. Socialism was not the answer: its view of humanity was fundamentally unhistorical, its programmes would be unworkable, and, above all, there was total incompatibility between it and the family. The family was the basic unit of society, with rights and duties anterior to those of the state, to be protected at all costs. The solution lay in the establishment of a Christian democracy. This would not provide easy answers, but would protect labour by supporting trade unions and end cut-throat competition among employers: &#145;there must be regulated trading and collective bargaining&#146;  (C. S. Devas, <span class="italic">The Meaning and Aims of Christian Democracy</span>, 1899, 13). He condemned international free trade as a &#145;vampire [that] sucked the very life-blood of the nation&#146;  (introduction to J. Byles, <span class="italic">Sophisms of Free Trade</span>, 1904). Economics, he insisted, must be essentially ethical. There was some criticism of the dogmatism of his more overtly Catholic writings, but all praised the fairness with which he treated the views of opponents.<br>
<br>Devas died suddenly of a heart attack on 6 November 1906 at Mount Pleasant, Farningham, Kent, while visiting his elder brother.<br>
