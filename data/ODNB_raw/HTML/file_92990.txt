<span class="headword">Redmond <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Mallick]</span>,  Bridget Mary</span>  (1904&#150;1952), <span class="occ">landowner and politician</span>, was born at The Curragh, co. Kildare, on 13 October 1904, the eldest daughter of John Mallick, hotel proprietor, and his wife, Bridget Mary. John Mallick was a well-known judge of horses and his racing colours were familiar at meetings in Ireland and England. His daughter inherited from him a love of horses and riding to hounds. She was educated at the Ursuline convent in Waterford. On 18 November 1930 she married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/65858/', "William Archer Redmond (1886&#150;1932)")</script>, the heir of the Redmond family's dwindling political dynasty. He had attempted to represent the remnants of his father's Irish Parliamentary Party during the 1920s, before finally joining Cumann na nGaedheal in 1931.<br>
<br>After her husband's death Bridget Redmond took on political life in earnest, being returned to her husband's former seat of Waterford in 1933. She initially stood as a Cumann na nGaedheal candidate, but became a member of Fine Gael when it was launched after a merger of Cumann na nGaedheal and several smaller organizations. In representing Waterford she maintained the Redmonds' connection with the city as the constituency had been represented by a member of that family continuously since 1891. She retained the seat at each subsequent election until her death.<br>
<br>Bridget Redmond played a comparatively active role in parliamentary politics and was especially interested in housing and social conditions. She also spoke on issues which directly affected Waterford. Little has been written about her political career and she is often lumped into the general category of women who entered Irish political life in the shadow of dead male relatives. She has been belittled as one of the &#145;silent sisters&#146;, a reference to some of the women in post-independence Irish parliamentary politics who contributed little to debates. This is a harsh assessment of Redmond, who made at least two rather interesting contributions to parliamentary debate. She was one of the few public figures to object to the teaching of all subjects through the medium of the Irish language, describing in 1936 the attempt to introduce such a measure as part of a &#145;wave of insanity&#146; which had swept over the country. She also objected to controversial clauses relating to the position of Irish women in the 1937 constitution. She did not present her objections with real vigour, but she was one of the very few female politicians who objected at all. She died of pulmonary tuberculosis at The Curragh, co. Kildare, on 3 May 1952.<br>
