<span class="headword">Baedeker,  Karl</span>  (1801&#150;1859), <span class="occ">publisher</span>, was born in Essen on 3 November 1801, the son of Gottschalk Diederich Baedeker (1778&#150;1841), bookseller, and his wife, Marianne (1781&#150;1847), daughter of bookseller Gehra of Neuwied. The family had a wide range of business activities connected to books, including publishing, bookselling, printing, and editing newspapers. After attending Heidelberg University and gaining experience in bookselling firms in Heidelberg and Berlin, Baedeker founded his own bookselling firm in Koblenz in 1827. The Romantic movement in Germany had given a new impetus to travel, which on the Rhine was particularly encouraged by the establishment in 1827 of regular steamboat excursions. In 1828 Baedeker bought the rights to J. A. Klein's <span class="italic">Rheinreise von Mainz bis K&ouml;ln</span> and, after the death of the author, Baedeker himself revised and updated the work, recreating it for a new market. Using his own travel experiences he guided the tourist to the principal attractions in each place, saving travellers the expense of hiring their own guide. He thus created a new type of guidebook, which was widely copied throughout Europe and opened up tourism to a new class of visitor. The reliability of the information was ensured by annual journeys by Baedeker himself and by reference to respected published sources and expert scholars.<br>
<br>On 4 October 1829 Baedeker married Emilie (1808&#150;1879), daughter of Heinrich Heintzmann, a civil servant of Essen, and his wife, Leopoldine von Paczenski und Tenczin. They had ten children. By the time of Baedeker's death in Koblenz on 4 October 1859 his firm had published guidebooks to several countries in continental Europe, and his sons, including <a name="cosubject_59340"></a><span class="headword">Fritz Baedeker</span>  (1844&#150;1925)<span class="occ"></span>, took over a flourishing business. Fritz was born on 4 December 1844 in Koblenz and entered the family firm. Under his guidance the range of guidebooks continued to expand, and increasing emphasis was put on simultaneous French and English editions. These were not simply literal translations: each was adapted to the needs, preferences, and experiences of travellers from each country, but all had a strong emphasis on cultural sites, supplying accurate details of art galleries, cathedrals, and churches at a time when few individual guides were available. In 1872 the Baedeker firm with its cartographers H. Wagner and E. Debes, whose high-quality maps contributed considerably to the guides, moved to Leipzig, then the centre of the German book trade. On 18 June 1873 in Koblenz Baedeker married Florentine 
    (Fl&ouml;ry; 1849&#150;1916)
  , daughter of Dietrich Wilhelm Landfermann, a civil servant.<br>
<br>The period 1870&#150;1914 has been described as the firm's golden age, and it was in this period that Baedeker's impact on British tourism was most marked, marginalizing John Murray's <span class="roman">Handbooks</span>, hitherto the standard series for travel at home and abroad. For the serious tourist a <span class="roman">Baedeker</span> was indispensable, its tone, especially with respect to southern Europeans, assuring northerners of their superiority, and suggesting ways of avoiding dangers. When Lucy Honeychurch finds herself &#145;In Santa Croce with no <span class="roman">Baedeker</span>&#146; in E. M. Forster's <span class="italic">A Room with a View</span> (1908) she is entirely lost. Like so many others, she relies on Baedeker to make the unfamiliar manageable, and to enable her to see foreign places while minimizing contact with foreigners. Her <span class="roman">Baedeker</span> tells her not only what she should see but also how she should respond to it. It was thus in the widest sense that the Baedeker family shaped the travel experiences of several generations of British tourists.<br>
<br>After 1914 the Baedeker firm laid particular emphasis on the British market. Fritz Baedeker died on 9 April 1925 in Leipzig, but the firm continued to prosper in family hands, with new ventures such as the publication of the first motoring guide in 1938. However, in 1943 Baedeker's archive and that of their cartographers were destroyed in a bombing raid, and after the war Leipzig was the wrong side of the iron curtain for a firm promoting international travel. The firm was refounded in 1948 in Hamburg, but its revised handbooks were more regional geographies than travel guides, with scant practical information. The firm never regained its pre-eminence in what had become a very competitive market, and certainly never regained its hold on the British imagination.<br>
