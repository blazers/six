<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Henshaw,  Alexander Adolphus Dumphries <span class="st"> [Alex]</span></span>  (1912&#150;2007), <span class="occ">aviator</span>, was born on 7 November 1912 in Peterborough, Northamptonshire, one of four children of Albert Henshaw (1888&#150;1964), a wealthy entrepreneur in agriculture, property, and the holiday industry in Lincolnshire. He was educated at Lincoln grammar school and King Edward VI Grammar School, Stratford upon Avon. While still a boy he received a Royal Humane Society award for saving another boy from the River Witham. Although his first interest was in engineering, he opted instead to join the family agricultural business.<br>
<br>Henshaw first became attracted to flying early in 1932 when captivated by Royal Air Force aircraft performing low-level aerobatics. After an intensive flying course that year with the Skegness and East Lincolnshire Aero Club, and first flying solo on 7 May, he gained his private pilot's licence on 6 June, and his air-minded father bought him a second-hand de Havilland Moth biplane for &pound;300. He soon aspired to aerobatics himself, and this led to the purchase of a new Comper Swift single-seat monoplane with which, after only thirty-five hours of flying, he became one of the youngest ever competitors in the prestigious 1933 king's cup air race. He was also the youngest pilot to win the Siddeley challenge trophy&#151;awarded to the light aeroplane club whose representative pilot in the race was the first to complete the 831 mile course&#151;having averaged 128 m.p.h. He purchased a larger, passenger-carrying de Havilland Leopard Moth for the 1934 race, but was not placed. Together with his father, he also honed his skills in dead reckoning navigation and blind flying around Europe before replacing the Swift with the one and only prototype Arrow Active I light racing biplane in May 1935.<br>
<br>For the 1935 royal jubilee year king's cup race Henshaw purchased a specially built Miles Hawk Major monoplane. However, a crankshaft failure forced him to ditch in the Irish Sea and he was fortunate to be rescued by the steamer <i>Manx Queen</i>. Then, while he was aerobatting the Arrow Active later that year, the engine caught fire, forcing him to bale out, using the parachute that his father had bought him for his birthday only four weeks earlier. After flying the Leopard Moth in the 1936 king's cup race, and having had to retire with low oil pressure, he swapped it for a much faster Percival Mew Gull single-seat monoplane G-AEXF. He entered the 1937 king's cup race but suffered from oiled-up plugs. Nothing daunted, in 1938 he finally won the trophy with the suitably modified Mew Gull, setting an average speed of 236.25 m.p.h., the fastest time then recorded, over a course of 1012 miles&#151;a record which still stood at the time of his death.<br>
<br>Henshaw then set his sights on the formidable objective of setting a new record flight to Cape Town and back. With his father he surveyed the route in the spring of 1938, checking routings down both sides of Africa. Opting to fly the western side, with the further modified Mew Gull, he departed from Gravesend on 5 February 1939. Without radio or navigation aids, he made fuel stops in Algeria, the Belgian Congo, and Angola before reaching Cape Town in just under forty hours, having flown 6377 miles. After only twenty-eight hours there, he followed a similar return route, landing completely exhausted at Gravesend on 9 February&#151;four days, ten hours, and sixteen minutes after his original departure. He had broken the homeward record, established in November 1937 with a twin-engined aircraft flown by two pilots, by seven hours, and the out-and-back time by almost thirty-one hours. However, this truly epic achievement was overshadowed by the imminence of war and Henshaw received no public recognition at all.<br>
<br>Volunteering for war service with the RAF as a fighter pilot on the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939, Henshaw accepted an invitation to join Vickers-Armstrongs as a test pilot. In June 1940 he was posted to the newly opened Vickers-Supermarine Spitfire shadow factory at Castle Bromwich, near Birmingham, becoming chief production test pilot for the huge output of Spitfire fighters, and later Avro Lancaster heavy bombers, built there between 1940 and the end of the war in 1945. With a production rate rising to ten Spitfires a day in 1943, he often flight-tested twenty aircraft in a single day. In one instance in 1943, while ferrying a Spitfire from the satellite unit at nearby Cosford in bad weather, and suffering engine failure over the outskirts of Coventry, his hurried forced landing largely demolished a small house but fortunately he suffered only minor injuries and no one else was hurt. On another occasion he was forced to abandon his aircraft when the engine exploded: despite his badly torn parachute, he still managed to land safely. Often called upon to demonstrate the Spitfire to groups of visiting VIPs, he notably made a virtuoso display before the highly air-minded wartime prime minister, Winston Churchill. The authorities were less pleased when he flew a Spitfire (inverted) down Birmingham's Broad Street. He also test-flew Lancasters and was reputed to be the only pilot able to barrel-roll the bomber.<br>
<br>Altogether 11,694 Spitfires and Seafires (the naval sibling) and 305 Lancaster bombers were built and repaired at Castle Bromwich and the local dispersal factories at Cosford and Desford. Under Henshaw's intensely active leadership together with twenty-five short-stay RAF officers, 37,023 test flights were logged there. Henshaw himself test-flew some 2360 individual Spitfires and Seafires, amounting to more than 10 per cent of the overall total of 22,749 of these aircraft built anywhere.<br>
<br>On 17 February 1940 Henshaw had married Countess Barbara Maude de Chateaubrun (1916&#150;1996), the widow of Count Guy de Chateaubrun, who had been killed in an air accident. She was the daughter of Sidney Harris Denman. They had one son, also named Alex. After the war, and a period in South Africa as a director of Miles Aircraft, in 1948 Henshaw rejoined his family's farming and holiday business, giving up flying in deference to his wife and the loss of her first husband. He then developed six miles of the Lincolnshire coastline, which had been requisitioned during the war, incorporating a residential estate at Sandilands, Sutton-on-Sea, with the main avenue bearing his name and all the streets and roads being named after the various aircraft he had flown. Yet despite his preoccupation with his diverse business interests, his abiding passion was for aviation and he remained in great demand at aviation functions for the rest of his life.<br>
<br>After his only national recognition with the somewhat meagre award of the MBE in 1944, in 1953 Henshaw was awarded the queen's commendation for bravery for his rescue work during the great floods of that year. Always taking great interest in promoting &#145;airmindedness&#146; in young people, in 1997 he was awarded the Air League's Jeffrey Quill medal. In 2003, the centenary of flight year, the duke of Edinburgh invested him as a companion of the Air League. He became an honorary fellow of the Royal Aeronautical Society the same year. He captured his aviation life for posterity in four graphically descriptive books, and in many lectures and magazine articles. In 2005 he donated his papers, photographs, trophies, and specially commissioned aviation art collection to the RAF Museum at Hendon. He died on 24 February 2007 at his home, Arborfield, Fordham Road, Newmarket, of heart disease. He was survived by his son, Alex.<br>
