<span class="headword">Warenne,  William (III)  de</span>, third earl of Surrey <span class="st"> [Earl Warenne]</span>  (<em>c.</em>1119&#150;1148), <span class="occ">magnate and crusader</span>, was the eldest of the five children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28737/', "William (II) de Warenne (d. 1138)")</script> and Isabel de Vermandois (<i>d</i>. 1147). His younger siblings included <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/50012/', "Ada, later countess of Huntingdon and Northumberland")</script>, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/47230/', "Reginald de Warenne")</script>. It was through his mother that he made the two most important family connections in his life: his eldest half-brother, Waleran, count of Meulan, the elder of the well-known Beaumont twins, and his distant cousin, Louis VII of France. Warenne married Ela, the daughter of Guillaume Talvas, count of Ponthieu, and Ela, daughter of Odo Borel, duke of Burgundy. She died on 4 October 1174. Their only child and Warenne's heir was a daughter, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28733/', "Isabel de Warenne (d. 1203)")</script>, who married William, son of King Stephen, and after his death, Hamelin, half-brother of King Henry II.<br>
<br>Between 1130 and 1138 Warenne appeared with his brother Ralph as co-grantor or witness in several of their father's charters, but his first known independent action was one which presaged a life of military misfortune. He was among those &#145;hot-headed youths&#146; (as Orderic Vitalis called them) who deserted King Stephen during his unsuccessful attempt to take Normandy in 1137. Probably in 1138 Warenne's father died, and he succeeded as earl of Surrey, though he consistently styled himself as Earl Warenne. In the summer of 1138 he or his father witnessed and possibly acted as guarantor for Roger, earl of Warwick, in an important charter in which Roger, husband of William (III)'s sister Gundreda, settled marriage arrangements between Roger's daughter and the chamberlain Geoffrey of Clinton. By the end of the year he had joined Waleran in Normandy and acted along with him as a witness to an agreement made in Rouen on 18 December. The brothers proceeded to their kinsman King Louis's court on an embassy from Stephen. By no later than 1139 Warenne had returned to England, probably with Waleran, most likely to attend his sister Ada's marriage to Henry, son of King David of Scotland. At that time he began his attendance at Stephen's court, where he became a regular witness to royal charters (at least a dozen between then and 1147) and began a career of unbroken, if not always distinguished, service to that troubled monarch.<br>
<br>The low point in Warenne's service to Stephen was at the battle of Lincoln on 2 February 1141, at which he and Waleran were among those who panicked and ran when they faced the first charge of Earl Robert of Gloucester's army, leaving the king to be captured. That it was panic rather than treachery that caused the flight could be seen by their support of Queen Matilda during Stephen's captivity and Warenne's appearance at the king's court after his release. Warenne redeemed himself on 14 September of that year and achieved the brightest moment of his military career when he led the Flemish mercenaries (usually under the command of William of Ypres) in taking Robert of Gloucester prisoner at Stockbridge. His activities in the following years included an appearance at Stephen's Christmas court, held at Canterbury, and an expedition against the town of St Albans, which he and three of the king's other captains were kept from burning by the payment of a rich bribe by Abbot Geoffrey of St Albans.<br>
<br>The next word of Warenne's military activity came in January 1144, during the king's last effort to win Normandy from Geoffrey of Anjou. When the city of Rouen surrendered to Geoffrey's forces, Stephen's men refused to give up the royal castle, and, led by Warenne's mercenaries, they held out for another three months before surrendering the castle of Neufch&acirc;tel-en-Bray. A double irony of this event is that Earl William was not identified specifically as having been present at this exercise in gallant futility, and that one of the leaders to whom his men surrendered was Count Waleran, that half-brother who had most guided his early career and who had been forced by then to take the Angevin side to defend his Norman holdings. If Warenne was indeed in Normandy at some time during the year, he left for England, where he was present on two occasions at the royal court during 1144 and 1145.<br>
<br>On 24 March, Palm Sunday of 1146, motivated perhaps by the example of his royal cousin and of Count Waleran, or by the rhetoric of an emotionally moving occasion, or by the desire to leave behind bad memories of the Anglo-Norman war, Warenne took the cross near V&eacute;zelay. After making some confirmatory grants to Lewes Priory and making his brother Reginald administrator of the honour of Warenne in his absence, he departed in June 1147, and met up with the French king, Louis, at Worms on the Rhine. He served in the king's personal guard, in which capacity he suffered loss of men and materials in an early encounter with the enemy. On 19 January 1148 he was among those in Louis's rearguard who were butchered in the defiles of Laodicea, and neither the wishful thinking of his brother Reginald nor the rumours of his survival that reached the northern chronicler John of Hexham would bring Warenne home again.<br>
<br>Although his short life meant that Warenne could not compete with his comital contemporaries in the field of religious benefactions, he did fulfil his obligations with donations to the family foundations of Lewes Priory and, to a lesser extent, Castle Acre Priory. He also made grants to the abbey of St Mary, York, and the templars at Saddlescombe, and he founded the priory of the Holy Sepulchre, Thetford, and possibly Thetford Hospital as well. He issued confirmations to Battle Abbey and Coxford and Nostell priories.<br>
