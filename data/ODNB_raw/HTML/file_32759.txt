<span class="headword">Deacon,  George Frederick</span>  (1843&#150;1909), <span class="occ">civil engineer</span>, was born at Bridgwater, Somerset, on 26 July 1843, the eldest son of Frederick Deacon, a solicitor of that town, who afterwards practised in Preston and was at one time sheriff of Lancashire. His mother was Katharine, third daughter of William H. Charlton, vicar of St Mary's, Bryanston Square, London. He was educated at Heversham grammar school and apprenticed at seventeen to Robert Napier &amp; Sons of Glasgow. During his apprenticeship he studied at Glasgow University under Professor W. J. Macquorn Rankine and Professor William Thomson.<br>
<br>On Thomson's recommendation Deacon was appointed assistant to Cromwell Fleetwood Varley, engineer to the Atlantic Telegraph Company, and under him he took part in 1865 in the laying of the second Atlantic cable by the steamship <i>Great Eastern</i>. The cable was lost off Newfoundland and Deacon was subsequently occupied in London on schemes for its recovery. From late 1865 to 1871 he practised at Liverpool as a consulting engineer, making so special a study of the Mersey estuary as to become a recognized authority in regard to it. He also lectured on civil engineering and mechanics at Queen's College, Liverpool. Between 1871 to 1880 he was borough and water engineer of Liverpool, a dual appointment which he held for eight years.<br>
<br>As borough engineer Deacon was responsible for the construction or reconstruction of about 70 miles of sewerage and he set up a rubbish-disposal system for the town. He laid the inner-circle tramway rails in 1877, on a system of his own, besides introducing wood pavement into Liverpool and improving the method of set paving by adopting a solid concrete foundation for the wearing surface. For this achievement he was awarded the Institution of Civil Engineers' Watt medal and a Telford premium.<br>
<br>As water engineer his work was of even greater importance. In 1873 he invented the Deacon waste-water meter, which enabled sources of leakage and waste to be located. In 1875 he was awarded a second Telford medal and premium. He also devised forms of electrical meters for river currents. In 1880 new sources of water supply for Liverpool became necessary, and Deacon projected a scheme, which was adopted in 1879, for the utilization of the River Vyrnwy in north Wales. Thereupon he resigned the duties of borough engineer in order to devote himself entirely to those of water engineer, which he discharged until 1890.<br>
<br>The works which Deacon designed, in conjunction with Thomas Hawksley, included the fine masonry dam in the valley of the Vyrnwy, forming a lake 1121 acres in extent and having an average depth of 70 feet&#151;the first reservoir in Great Britain closed by a high masonry dam. The dam had a maximum height to the overflow level of 144 feet, and impounded about 13,000 million gallons of water. From this lake the water was conveyed to Liverpool by an aqueduct 76 miles in length, which traversed three mountain tunnels and crossed under or over several railways and beneath a number of canals and rivers, including the Mersey. Hawksley and Deacon were joint engineers of the undertaking until 1885, when Hawksley retired and the undivided responsibility fell upon Deacon. The works, opened by the duke of Connaught in July 1892, gained for Deacon the Institution of Civil Engineers' George Stephenson medal and a Telford premium.<br>
<br>In both branches of his work in Liverpool, Deacon won for himself a high reputation. Every question or problem was studied with the scientific thoroughness with which his former teacher and lifelong friend, William Thomson (who became Lord Kelvin in 1892), had imbued him. He regarded no practical detail as too small for earnest study and attention. He recognized, too, the aesthetic claims of constructional work.<br>
<br>In 1890 Deacon established a consulting practice in Westminster. In that capacity he constructed waterworks for Kendal, Merthyr Tudful, Todmorden, Biggleswade, Milton (Kent), and other places. At his death he was engaged upon the plans of works, subsequently constructed, for supplying Birkenhead from the River Alwen, and of new works for Ebbw Vale. He reported in 1890 to the international Niagara commissioners on the utilization of the falls; in 1897, in conjunction with Sir Benjamin Baker, to the London county council on the water supply of London; and in the same year, in conjunction with Dr W. C. Unwin and John Carruthers, on the Coolgardie, Australia, water supply scheme.<br>
<br>Deacon was elected an associate of the Institution of Civil Engineers on 3 December 1872, became a full member on 6 January 1874, and was a member of the council from November 1900 until his death. He was also a member of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers and a fellow, from 1893, of the Royal Meteorological Society. He was president of the mechanical science section of the British Association at its Toronto meeting in 1897, as well as of many professional societies. In 1902 the University of Glasgow conferred upon him the honorary degree of LLD.<br>
<br>Deacon had considerable artistic talent and in all his works attempted to combine utility with beauty and harmony with the surroundings. As a parliamentary witness he was in frequent demand and, having taken pains to master his subjects, his evidence carried weight. Indefatigable himself, he drew the best from his assistants.<br>
<br>He married first, on 16 November 1869, at Douglas, Isle of Man, Emily Zo&euml;, eldest daughter of Peter Thomson, of Bombay, and second Ada Emma (<i>d</i>. 1912), eldest daughter of Robert Pearce of Bury St Edmunds. A son and three daughters were born of the first marriage. Deacon died suddenly at his office, 16 Great George Street, Westminster, on 17 June 1909, and was buried at Addington, Surrey, near his country residence. In 1910 two memorial windows were placed in Llanwddyn church, near Vyrnwy Lake, one by members and officials of the corporation of Liverpool, and the other by his family.<br>
