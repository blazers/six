<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Speke,  John Hanning</span>  (1827&#150;1864), <span class="occ">explorer in Africa</span>, was born on 4 May 1827 at Orleigh Court in the parish of Buckland Brewer, near Bideford, Devon, the second son of William Speke (1798&#150;1887), an army captain in the 14th dragoons and landowner, and his wife, Georgina Elizabeth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Hanning. The family later moved to Jordans in Somerset.<h2>
<a name="Educationandentryintothearmy"></a>Education and entry into the army</h2>Speke attended Barnstaple grammar school and then Blackheath proprietary school. He detested his schooling, possibly partly because of a latent tubercular condition which caused eye troubles, which were to affect him again in 1858. It seems that he had little aptitude for languages; nor, later, was his written English beyond reproach. On the other hand, he had the ability to calculate longitudes from observed lunar distances and was to take the trouble to enhance his understanding of other sciences when preparing for his Nile expedition in 1859. At the age of seventeen, in 1844, he was accepted for a commission in the Indian army and joined the 46th native Bengal infantry. He took part in the First and Second Anglo-Sikh wars of 1845&#150;6 and 1848&#150;9. There is little information on his military career, but he remarked that peacetime soldiering bored him. Consequently, from 1848 onwards, the young lieutenant spent all the time he could on hunting trips in Tibet, combining his avid collecting of trophies to send home with a little geographical enquiry. James Augustus Grant was with him on at least one of these trips and provides some information.<br>
<br>At the end of his first ten-year commission in 1854 Speke wished to extend his trophy hunting to Africa, and was fortunate in finding that a Bombay presidency expedition under Richard Burton was just leaving Aden for the Somali coast opposite. The plan was to penetrate southwards into east Africa, but the only success was Burton's solo venture westwards to Harar. Given the task of reconnoitring the area south of Bunder Gori, Speke found his inexperience told against him: he became involved in clan disputes he did not understand, although he eventually realized that his guide and &#145;protector&#146; was using the trip for his own purposes. At least there were some useful lessons about the realities of African travel, but little ground was explored. Speke rejoined the rest of the expedition at Berbera, where they were attacked in April 1855 by the Har Owel tribe. Speke was captured and escaped but had been so badly wounded that he almost died. In the longer run it was even more significant that, at one point in the m&ecirc;l&eacute;e, Burton seemed to accuse him of cowardice. This rankled as the first of the breaches between them which were so greatly to affect the careers of both men.<h2>
<a name="TheexpeditiontothegreatlakesofeastAfrica18561859"></a>The expedition to the great lakes of east Africa, 1856&#150;1859</h2>Although he was invalided to England in June 1855, Speke almost immediately volunteered for the Crimea, where he was attached to a Turkish regiment just before the war's end. In the midst of his plans for a hunting trip to the Caucasus came news of the chance to rejoin Burton on another east African venture. This was being organized by the Royal Geographical Society (RGS) with limited financial and logistical support from the British and Indian governments. A new era was beginning in Britain's relations with east Africa, this coinciding with important internal developments. The RGS was now powerful and influential enough to contemplate solving the problems of east Africa's geography, about which &#145;armchair geographers&#146; such as Cooley and McQueen had speculated and upon which the missionary Krapf and his companions based near Mombasa had thrown some limited but confusing light. A large lake or lakes, snow-capped mountains, and, above all, the possible source of the Nile seemed to exist in the interior. Although the Foreign Office said it was simply &#145;supporting geographical science&#146;, with the Suez route in use and the Suez Canal soon to open, the western Indian Ocean region was becoming of much greater concern to both the Indian and British governments, who needed more information on political and economic realities in the region&#151;not forgetting the slave trade to which David Livingstone was currently drawing attention. Whatever the motives of those involved, the days of solo travels such as those Burton had hitherto undertaken were over; comparatively large and well-equipped expeditions imitating Zanzibar Arab trade caravans seemed appropriate. This was all the more necessary as east Africa itself was becoming more disturbed and prone to violence as Indian-financed Arabs undercut African traders, new forms of political authority based on force developed, and Ngoni groups from the south taught how to live by war and plunder.<br>
<br>The expedition, with both men now holding captaincies, set off from the coast opposite Zanzibar in June 1857 and reached Lake Tanganyika in February 1858. Both Europeans were ill with the effects of malaria or relapsing fever, and Speke's ophthalmic problems recurred so that he could not properly see the lake. During his attempt to cross it by canoe, Speke also suffered when a beetle entered his ear, causing intense discomfort and longer-term problems of deafness. No boat large enough to examine the lake properly could be secured and so the possibility of an outlet to the north could not be tested, thus leaving scope for Burton later to be able to claim that &#145;his&#146; Lake Tanganyika was the source of the Nile. By the time the explorers were back in Tabora, the Arab traders' headquarters, Burton remained ill but Speke was sufficiently recovered to want to make a trip northwards to another reported lake. Directly in charge now of his own sub-expedition, Speke reached the southern end of what he christened Lake Victoria on 3 August 1858. He immediately decided that this lake must be the source of the Nile. Local political rivalries prevented him from exploring very extensively in the area and he regained Tabora, whence the whole expedition returned to the coast. Burton's previously tolerant and friendly attitude to Speke began to change; he could not accept the Nile claims, and there were differences of opinion about how much the porters deserved to be paid and about how the deficit in the funding of the whole venture should be made up from their own pockets. Underneath these arguments there lay the problem of incompatibility between the socially unconventional and highly intellectual Burton and the rather unimaginative and certainly unintellectual Speke. The difficulties were compounded when Speke returned to England before Burton in May 1859 and, probably as a result of mischief-making counsel from Laurence Oliphant and the anxiety of Roderick Murchison to have a hero for the RGS, made his Nile claims public. This, in effect, belittled Burton's achievement. Speke published his account of the expedition in <span class="italic">Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine</span> and the breach with Burton became almost complete.<h2>
<a name="TheNileexpedition18601863"></a>The Nile expedition, 1860&#150;1863</h2>Although the RGS offered Burton the chance to return to east Africa, their first priority for an expedition was clearly to send Speke back to prove his Nile claims. They obtained &pound;2500 from the government and raised a public subscription of &pound;1200 to enable the Nile ivory trader John Petherick to meet Speke with supplies at Gondokoro on the upper Nile. J. A. Grant was invited to join Speke. In addition, mules and an escort of Cape mounted riflemen were provided by Sir George Grey, the governor of Cape Colony, although they proved unsuitable and had to be sent back.<br>
<br>The expedition left the coast in September 1860 with 176 men, including Bombay and Baraka, two former slaves who had learned Hindi and so could act as interpreters and negotiators for Speke. Unfortunately, these two talented men were frequently at loggerheads and their disputes complicated management problems in the caravan and the all-important business of negotiating with local political leaders through whose jurisdictions the expedition had to pass. Most difficult was the situation at Tabora, where the relationship between the Arab traders and the Nyamwezi chiefdom of Unyanyembe had broken down, with the result that Speke found it difficult to recruit porters and get supplies. He was not powerful enough to impose a solution but he did try to arbitrate. However, Manua Sera, the chief whom the Arabs had deposed, wanted unequivocal support, which the explorer could not afford to give knowing that he still needed Arab help. As in many similar situations, Speke had to learn to be patient and act in the light of the advice of Bombay and Baraka. Negotiating a way northwards towards the western shores of Lake Victoria continued difficult, with Speke and Grant forced to separate for long periods, and it took until November 1861 to reach Karagwe and its friendly king, Rumanika.<br>
<br>The nature of the problems then began to change. The powerful kings of the &#145;interlacustrine&#146; region could disregard Arabs or petty chiefs and provide an easy passage for the travellers&#151;if it suited them to do so. In fact, Speke's presence and his petitions for permission to go on northwards presented them with dilemmas. Here was someone representing a power apparently even greater than Zanzibar or Egypt. Would that power be deployed? Speke's constant questions about his friend Petherick and his Nile boats suggested it might be. More immediately, should Rumanika help him to open a Nile route if that diminished his own importance as &#145;gatekeeper&#146; on the route from the south? Yet he could not risk displeasing Mutesa, the <i>kabaka</i> of the most powerful kingdom, Buganda, by keeping Speke back. Mutesa himself was also worried about the Nile route, since this would enhance the importance of the rival kingdom of Bunyoro. And the rulers of Buganda and Bunyoro were already both worried by the encroachments of the Khartoum-based slave and ivory traders from the north. In short, Speke's presence presented something of a foreign-policy dilemma for all these potentates, and this largely explains the long delays between the arrival of the travellers in Karagwe in November 1861 and their emergence from the lake region in February 1863 to reach Gondokoro, where they expected Petherick to be waiting. For his part, Speke was fascinated by the peoples and especially their rulers. These, surely, were different in race and history from their subjects and from other Africans in east Africa. He encouraged their claims that they were an aristocracy who had come from the north. So was born the &#145;Hamitic myth&#146; which helped to direct particular European attention to this region as having potential collaborators who would be receptive to European economic, political, or religious initiatives&#151;initiatives which Speke himself was later to try to develop.<br>
<br>From November 1861 Speke remained in Karagwe, learning much of the kingdom and hearing Rumanika's testimonies on the geography of the region. Then in February 1862 came Mutesa's peremptory order for him to proceed to Buganda, although Grant had to remain with an ulcerated leg until May. Mutesa presided over a court system which involved constant intrigue and competition between the country's great men. Both consciously and unconsciously, Speke became part of the system, seeking various favours from Mutesa, including permission to go on to the Nile, and sometimes playing off the queen mother's court against her son's. For his part, Mutesa was fascinated by Speke's guns and also by the knowledge Speke imparted to him. He used Speke in his own political ploys, for example, against the priests of certain cults. What Speke learned in Buganda was perhaps as significant a &#145;discovery&#146; as the source of the Nile. Eventually Speke was allowed to go on to that source&#151;the point where the Nile issues from Lake Victoria&#151;which he reached on 28 July 1862 and which he named Ripon Falls. This was the crowning moment of the expedition and of Speke's career. Unfortunately, Grant, who was still suffering with his leg, had been sent off directly north and so did not confirm the discovery, no doubt to his own disappointment and certainly to the detriment of Speke's subsequent reputation. Nor did the party follow the Nile stream closely as they went north to Bunyoro and beyond. Although this left scope for Samuel Baker to discover Lake Albert a few months later, it also allowed critics to question whether Speke's river really was the Nile. In Bunyoro the ruler Kamurasi's distrust of anyone who had come from Buganda and his fears about a rival allied with Nile traders meant further delays, but the expedition reached Gondokoro in February 1863. This was long after the November 1861 target date set with Petherick, who had left supplies but was trading elsewhere. Before he returned, it was Baker who now welcomed Speke and provided material help. Speke reacted to Petherick's absence in a very intemperate and unfair way, subsequently destroying the man's career by his vilification. By May 1863 the explorers, with eighteen remaining &#145;faithfuls&#146; from the porters, had reached Cairo and let the world know that the Nile was &#145;settled&#146;.<h2>
<a name="ThereturnhomeandthedisputewithBurton"></a>The return home and the dispute with Burton</h2>Having returned to London, Speke certainly became the &#145;lion&#146;; windows were broken as crowds tried to get into the special meeting of the RGS, and there was an enthusiastic welcome at his father's home in Somerset. The situation was to change. The <span class="italic">Journal of the Discovery of the Source of the Nile</span> was published in December 1863. Speke's draft had been very heavily &#145;improved&#146; for grammar and bowdlerized of its too sexually explicit passages by John Hill Burton, who also made Speke appear more in charge of situations than had actually been the case. The book was not a literary landmark and ultimately did not sell as well as Blackwood hoped. Its first edition included a large historical error. McQueen, a friend of Petherick's father-in-law, wrote a very hostile review, and Burton began to question the Nile discovery, especially after Speke republished in 1864, as a book entitled <span class="italic">What Led to the Discovery of the Source of the Nile</span>, his own accounts of the earlier Somali and Lake Tanganyika expeditions. Murchison became lukewarm, partly because of the Petherick affair but mainly because Speke had chosen to publish his account through Blackwood and not the RGS. Murchison's wavering support almost certainly explains why Speke received no honour from the crown and perhaps why Speke's own plans for the &#145;regeneration&#146; of Africa received no significant institutional support. Even so, it was probably mischievous or worse for Murchison and the RGS to arrange that the geographical section of the British Association's September 1864 meeting include a debate on the Nile question between Burton and Speke. The two men were now completely estranged. On 15 September, the day before the planned debate, Speke left a lunch where Burton was present and went off to shoot partridges at Neston Park, his uncle's nearby estate at Corsham, Wiltshire. In getting over a wall with his gun cocked he shot himself, with fatal result. Ever since 1864 it has continued to be asserted that Speke, knowing that Burton was almost certain to worst him in debate, must have committed suicide. The evidence, although not incontrovertible, is very much against this possibility. The tragic death and the attendant controversy further undermined Speke's credibility. Although Murchison immediately relented, attending the funeral at Dowlish Wake church, near Jordans, on 26 September and later arranging for the erection of a memorial in Kensington Gardens, the doubts about both Speke's geography and his character remained. Even the wording on the memorial is equivocal: Speke is not described as the discoverer of the source of the Nile.<h2>
<a name="Spekeslaterreputation"></a>Speke's later reputation</h2>It was not until about twelve years later that the work of H. M. Stanley and others made it clear that Speke was right about Lake Victoria and the Nile.<br>
<br>Speke, who was &#145;the boldest explorer of the age&#146; and than whom no man was &#145;safer for immortality&#146;, according to one of his obituaries  (<span class="italic">Blackwood</span>, 514&#150;16), has, nevertheless, not become a household name. By 133 years after his death there had been only one book-length biography. It is true that he burnt many of his personal and exploration papers. It is also arguable that his books have little literary merit and that their cause has not been helped by reprints which are either ill-edited or based on the corrupt <span class="roman">Everyman</span> edition of his <span class="italic">Journal</span>. Yet there are adequate manuscript records of his correspondence and exploratory activities, and his work was important in the history of discovery and, to some extent, in the history of Africa. The reasons for Speke's comparative eclipse have something to do with the peculiar circumstances of his discoveries and of his death, but perhaps also something to do with his character. It has been said that he was a repressed homosexual with a mother fixation and a death drive, that he was fastidious and priggish and full of egotism and intolerance. Modern observers find his slaughter of animals&#151;in which there seems to have been something of a ritual element&#151;especially unattractive. On the other hand, the only substantial evidence on his sexuality is that he fathered a child in Buganda, and there is much contemporary testimony that he was liked by children, respected by adults, whether African or European, and had a genuine scientific interest in the fauna of Africa.<br>
<br>In retrospect it can be seen that, even if Speke was not altogether a great man, he was a great discoverer whose achievement was a landmark in the systemization of knowledge about the world. The source of the Nile itself became a great focus for European strategic interests twenty-five years after his visit, while his making known the existence of Buganda and its people had even greater implications for both European imperialists and the Ganda themselves. More generally, Speke's accounts of his expeditions remain absolutely vital sources of evidence on the history of east Africa in the nineteenth century.<br>
