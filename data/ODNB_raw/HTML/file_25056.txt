<span class="headword">Sellar,  William Young</span>  (1825&#150;1890), <span class="occ">classical scholar</span>, was born at Morvich, Sutherland, on 22 February 1825, the third son of the seven boys and two girls of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25055/', "Patrick Sellar (1780&#150;1851)")</script>, who was notorious as factor to the duke of Sutherland during the highland clearances, and his wife, Anne Craig. At the early age of seven he joined the youngest class in the Edinburgh Academy, then under its first headmaster, John Williams. At the age of fourteen he was dux, or head boy, of the school. From there he went to Glasgow University (1839&#150;42), where Edmund Law Lushington was professor of Greek and William Ramsay (1806&#150;1865) was professor of Latin. Under these teachers and friends Sellar advanced in classical learning. He gained a Snell exhibition and a Balliol scholarship, matriculating on 1 December 1842, and was a contemporary of his friends Matthew Arnold and Principal Shairp, and a pupil and friend of Benjamin Jowett. After taking a first class in <i>literae humaniores</i>, and graduating BA in 1847 (MA in 1850), Sellar was elected to a fellowship at Oriel in 1848, which he held until his marriage (1 June 1852) to Eleanor Mary (<i>b</i>. 1829), daughter of Alex Dennistoun, a Glasgow merchant and radical MP for Dunbartonshire (1835&#150;7).<br>
<br>After teaching for a short time in the University of Durham (1850&#150;51) Sellar went to assist Professor Ramsay in the Latin chair at Glasgow (1851&#150;3). From 1853 to 1859 he was assistant professor of Greek at St Andrews. From 1859 to 1863 he held the Greek chair in that university, where his nephew Andrew Lang was a pupil, and from 1863 until his death was professor of Latin in the University of Edinburgh. He took a keen interest in politics as a Liberal and then, opposing Irish home rule, a staunch unionist. Short-sightedness contributed to a rather distant manner. Sellar died at Kenbank, Dalry, Kirkcudbrightshire, on 12 October 1890, and was buried in the churchyard at Dalry. His widow and their children survived him.<br>
<br>The least permanent, though perhaps the most important, part of Sellar's work was academic. A sound though not, in his own judgement, a brilliant, scholar, his appreciation of classical literature was keen and contagious. His modesty, humour, and generous sentiments aroused the affection of his pupils, many of whom had distinguished careers, while his learning secured their respect. He contributed the essays &#145;Lucretius&#146; and &#145;Characteristics of Thucydides&#146; to <span class="italic">Oxford Essays</span> (1855, 1857). His other works were <span class="italic">The Roman Poets of the Republic</span> (1863), <span class="italic">The Roman Poets of the Augustan Age: Virgil</span> (1877), and <span class="italic">Horace and the Elegiac Poets</span>, edited by W. P. Ker (1892). These were all remarkable examples of sound and sensitive literary criticism.<br>
