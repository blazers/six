<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Stone, Sir  (John) Richard Nicholas</span>  (1913&#150;1991), <span class="occ">economist and statistician</span>, was born on 30 August 1913, at 19 York Mansions, Battersea, London, the only child of Sir Gilbert Stone (1886&#150;1967) and his wife, Elsie Lawton Scott (1884&#150;1969). His father was a barrister who became a high court judge in Madras in 1930 and was knighted by Edward VIII in 1936. After attending Cliveden Place preparatory school and Westminster School, Stone spent a happy year in India and the Far East with his parents before going to Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, in 1931 to read law. But he was unable to sustain an interest in the subject, any more than he had been enthused by classics at school. In his second year he started to read economics texts and he changed to study economics at the end of his second year in 1933 and read part two of the tripos, graduating in 1935 with a first-class degree. Even as an undergraduate Stone attempted a statistical analysis of the link between inputs of labour and capital and the output to which they gave rise. He showed this to the professor of political economy in Cambridge, A. C. Pigou, who admitted that he had no real understanding of the exercise.<br>
<br>On graduating Stone joined a firm of Lloyd's brokers, C. E. Heath &amp; Co., and on 29 May 1936 he married Winifred Mary Jenkins, known as Pix (1912/13&#150;2000), who graduated from Newnham College in economics in the same year as Stone. But Stone did not lose touch with economics; he and his wife took over from another of his teachers, Colin Clark, the production of <span class="italic">Trends</span>. This appeared as a supplement to the monthly <span class="italic">Industry Illustrated</span> and provided a regular survey of data on the British economy. It was a forerunner of <span class="italic">Economic Trends</span>, one of the most important publications of the Office for National Statistics. Stone was divorced in 1940.<h2>
<a name="Wartimeeconomist"></a>Wartime economist</h2>The start of the Second World War led the government to recruit a large number of economists and, instead of military service, Stone was assigned to the Ministry of Economic Warfare. He was given the job of following shipping movements. As he said, it was assumed that he knew about shipping because he had worked in insurance. He was involved in tracking Italian shipping and, in May 1940 noticed that Italian ships were heading for neutral ports. He plotted the date when the last Italian ship was expected to reach port and forecast that Italy would declare war on 10 June. His forecast was correct but it offended his superiors and the Italophile part of the Foreign Office.<br>
<br>However, Stone was able to move to a job more suited to his skills. In 1940 Keynes had published a classic essay on war finance, <span class="italic">How to Pay for the War</span>. At much the same time an Oxford economist and subsequent Nobel prizewinner, James Meade, had returned from a post at the League of Nations in Geneva. Meade argued that, in order to use Keynes's framework, it was necessary to set out tables of income and expenditure for the major sectors of the economy. Only by doing this could one hope to work out where there were the spare resources needed for fighting the war, or consider how the capacity might be created. However, Meade's conceptual tables needed filling out and Stone was made available to him as an assistant to put numbers round them.<br>
<br>The result was the appearance of the first national accounts for the United Kingdom. These were published as a white paper alongside the 1941 budget and formed the beginning of regular national income accounting throughout the world. Other countries had, of course, produced regular economic statistics and worked out their own measures of national income. The key contribution of Meade and Stone was to show how the various transactions in the economy were interrelated&#151;hence the distinction between national accounts and the concept of national income, studied by many, including Colin Clark. Meade related how Stone gradually took over the development of national accounting; he remained in the economic section of the Cabinet Office which he subsequently directed, while Stone worked in the central statistical office set up by Churchill in 1941. He also ran a research project at the National Institute of Economic and Social Research and married its secretary, Feodora Sonya Leontinoff, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Radetsky (1909&#150;1956) on 22 November 1941. Their daughter and Stone's only child, Caroline Elizabeth Miranda, was born on 10 September 1946.<br>
<br>The fact that national accounting was a data framework meant that, in 1942, it was possible for Stone to set out national accounts for the United States. In 1944 he was discussing with Canadian and United States statisticians the question of harmonizing concepts so that international comparisons of national accounts would be facilitated. In 1945 he left the civil service to become the first director of the department of applied economics in Cambridge.<h2>
<a name="Academiceconomistnationalaccounts"></a>Academic economist: national accounts</h2>At Cambridge there were two main thrusts of Stone's research. One was the development of econometric techniques. For example, simple methods of fitting lines to data had been known for many years, but it was increasingly realized that such methods, when applied to observations for successive years or quarters, could be highly misleading. The work in Cambridge was the beginning of the development of techniques to remedy this problem and also, along with work done by the Cowles commission at Yale University, the beginning of the formal study of econometrics. Such work continues fruitfully as an increasingly distinctive branch of economics.<br>
<br>The second strand continued Stone's interest in national accounts. To measure what is going on in the economy is best done with properly structured data collection systems. But Stone was interested in producing national accounts for the period before 1938 (the first year studied in his earlier work), and set about reviewing such data sources as existed so that these could be consolidated into the national accounting framework. The work, involving many other researchers, produced six volumes of data with careful descriptions of their sources.<br>
<br>The first volume of this series included detailed estimates of consumer spending, item by item, for the British economy for the period 1920 to 1938. There was also a great deal of careful econometric analysis looking at influences on the composition of spending. But the data in the book gave rise to a paper which was certainly of equal importance to Stone's work on national accounting. Economists had long used the concept of utility and considered how this might be expressed as a function of the goods and services that people consume. But the concept had remained abstract and unconnected with empirical work. In &#145;Linear expenditure systems and demand analysis: an application to the pattern of British demand&#146;, (<span class="italic">Economic Journal</span>, 255, 1954, 511&#150;27), Stone showed that, on the one hand, with an appropriate specification of a utility function, it was possible to estimate the parameters of this function from his consumption data. These parameters depended on the sensitivity of spending patterns to price changes. On the other hand, this was the first empirical application of the concept of a representative consumer in empirical work. Both the analysis of patterns of demand derived from utility functions and the analysis of the empirical phenomena using the tool of a representative consumer became mainstays of research in economics, providing a structure for empirical work which otherwise would be limited to the analysis of regularities in the data.<br>
<br>Work on international comparability of national accounts continued with a group Stone ran in Cambridge, producing reports on the structure of national accounts in 1950 and 1952 for the Organization for European Economic Co-operation (the precursor of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development). In 1953 Stone chaired the production of a more substantial United Nations report, <span class="italic">A System of National Accounts and Supporting Tables</span>.<h2>
<a name="Laterwork"></a>Later work</h2>Stone's work in the department of applied economics, for all its revolutionary characteristics, did not prove popular with some of his colleagues in the faculty of economics. In particular, Joan Robinson and one of his former teachers, Richard Kahn, doubted the value of his econometric work and his demand analysis. In 1955 Stone was appointed to the P. D. Leake chair of accounting and finance; accepting this chair meant giving up the directorship of the department. Stone nevertheless continued to work with a substantial group of researchers there. In the same year he was president of the Econometric Society, an international body designed to further the development of formal techniques of economic analysis. More sadly, a year later, in 1956, his wife died leaving him with their daughter to look after.<br>
<br>He continued his work on the demand for goods and services, using the framework he had pioneered. One study looked at the importance of durable goods and showed a link between this and the effects of habit on the demand for non-durable goods. He was becoming increasingly interested in the link between these behavioural models and the working of the economic system as a whole. In 1959 <span class="italic">Social Accounting and Economic Models</span> appeared, showing how his consumption model could fit into a framework which represented all the transactions shown in his national accounting system. This was co-authored by Giovanna Catarina Andreina Vassilissa Croft-Murray, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Saffi (<i>b</i>. 1919), whom he married on 16 May 1960. Giovanna became a supportive partner in much of his subsequent work.<br>
<br>Stone's colleague Alan Brown encouraged him to take his analysis further and in 1960 the Cambridge growth project was set up with the goal of modelling the economy in a coherent manner which was consistent both with detailed behavioural models and with the constraints imposed by the national accounting structure on the economy as a whole. This project ran for more than twenty years and gave an opportunity for a number of researchers to develop their skills while benefiting from Stone's kind encouragement. Perhaps the most widely known of this group was Mervyn King, deputy governor of the Bank of England, while Angus Deaton, who carried on Stone's work on consumer demand, also developed his own outstanding international reputation. In 1968 the project of maintaining international standards for national accounts took up Stone's time yet again. A new <span class="italic">System of National Accounts</span> was prepared by the United Nations as a revision of the 1954 manual. Stone was the author of the first four chapters.<br>
<br>While Stone continued to work on econometric problems, he developed a new interest in demographic data, with the idea that these, like economic data, could be set out in an accounting framework. This eventually led to a UN manual, <span class="italic">Towards a System of Social and Demographic Statistics</span>, published by the United Nations in 1975; the work did not have the same impact as that on economic accounting.<h2>
<a name="RetirementandNobelprize"></a>Retirement and Nobel prize</h2>Stone was appointed a knight bachelor in 1978. In 1980 he was president of the Royal Economic Society. He retired in the same year saying that it would make little difference because he had always worked most happily from his house at 13 Millington Road, Cambridge, where he and his wife enjoyed entertaining their friends. The award of the Nobel prize for economics in 1984 referred to his &#145;fundamental contributions to the development of national accounts&#146;. It gave great pleasure to everyone who knew him and probably to none more than James Meade, a close friend since they had worked together in 1940. The importance of the achievement can be judged by the fact that national accounts are now only rarely attributed to Stone: they are simply taken for granted.<br>
<br>Although plagued by ill health in his retirement, Stone accepted an invitation from the Banca Commerciale Italiana to give the Raffaele Mattioli lectures in 1986. His chosen subject was later published as <span class="italic">Some British Empiricists in the Social Sciences, 1650&#150;1900</span> (1997). He died on 6 December 1991 at his home, 13 Millington Road, Cambridge, and was buried at St Mark's Church, Cambridge, on 10 December. Thanks to the work of his wife these lovely essays covering characters such as William Petty (the first national accountant) and Florence Nightingale, who found statistics &#145;more enlivening than a novel&#146;, were published in 1997. One suspects that, in noting this, Stone saw reflected his own enthusiasm for empirical work built round a rigorous theoretical framework.<br>
