<span class="headword">Pontoise <span class="st"> [Pontissara]</span>,  John  de</span>  (<em>c.</em>1240&#150;1304), <span class="occ">bishop of Winchester</span>, was apparently an Englishman, though the family no doubt derived from Pontoise. At some stage during his early career he and his mother, Joan, were granted the manor of Eastington on the Isle of Purbeck, Dorset, by the priory of Christ Church, Twynham, to be held for their lifetimes. He probably studied at Oxford, though the evidence is indirect: his executors endowed 200 marks to establish a loan chest for the masters and scholars and, no doubt because he was a benefactor, his obit was to be observed by the university. Certainly he trained at Bologna and was a doctor of civil law by <i>c</i>.1270, when he was invited to lecture on civil law for a year by the city of Modena in northern Italy. He was already beneficed in the diocese of York, for in 1264 he had obtained a papal dispensation to hold the rectory of Welwick in Holderness with two other benefices with cure of souls. It is interesting that he should have first obtained benefices in the north; in the late thirteenth century very many royal clerks were beneficed in the province of York, and it is clear that he was in the king's service by 1262, acting as a proctor for Henry III in the French court.<br>
<br>Pontoise became a canon of Exeter Cathedral in May 1274 and archdeacon of Exeter in December, obtaining also the rectory of Tawstock, diocese of Exeter, in 1275. He was soon in demand as a proctor in Rome, where he must have spent much of his time, acting for the clergy of the province of Canterbury and also for the bishop of Exeter in 1277, and for John Peckham, archbishop of Canterbury, between 1279 and 1282. He was a papal chaplain by 1281, and, following two disputed elections to the bishopric of Winchester, he was appointed by papal provision to this see on 9 June 1282. He was consecrated by the cardinal-bishop of Ostia and Velletri before 15 June, returned to England to profess obedience to the archbishop of Canterbury on 1 August, was granted the temporalities of the bishopric on 11 August, and was enthroned in his cathedral church in September.<br>
<br>At first Pontoise's relations as bishop with Edward I were tense (partly no doubt because the king had wanted the extremely wealthy bishopric of Winchester for his chancellor, Robert Burnell), and he began his career of high office in the English church in close alliance with the archbishop of Canterbury, John Peckham. But matters soon changed, for he was to become one of the king's leading and most active councillors and diplomats: on royal service in Paris in 1285, with the king in Gascony in 1287&#150;9, presiding with Burnell and others over the trial of royal ministers following the return from Gascony, negotiating for peace in France and Rome in 1296&#150;8 and in France in 1299, back in Rome and Paris in 1300&#150;01, and in Paris again in 1303. His legal training and knowledge of the workings of the Roman curia were put tirelessly at the service of the crown. His work for both king and pope marked him out, along with the bishop of Lincoln, for the unpopular role of chief assessor and collector of the famous papal taxes initiated in 1291/2 for the king's planned but unexecuted crusade.<br>
<br>Despite all this external activity Pontoise spent long periods of time in his diocese, active in every facet of ecclesiastical administration, as is revealed by his register, the first to survive for the diocese of Winchester. There is no lack of evidence here for his concern for the welfare of his cathedral church and of the monasteries and churches of his diocese; but this occasionally confused register suggests, even so, a bishop with political and financial interests that extended beyond routine local and parochial concerns, for it includes many documents that show his close interest in international political developments. He stands in contrast to those prelates of his day, often trained in theology, who shunned close involvement in secular government, and even openly opposed royal policies. He had, for example, little in common with Robert Winchelsey, Peckham's successor at Canterbury, the champion of ecclesiastical liberties in the face, as he saw it, of the encroachments of the crown. His aloofness from Winchelsey was demonstrated by the rare exemption of his diocese from the jurisdiction of the archbishop, obtained from Pope Boniface VIII in 1297. As a man of affairs and political influence it is not surprising that he had his opponents. An anonymous memorandum sent to Rome just after his death accused him of storing up great wealth, and even of having profited from the neglect of the episcopal estates, accusations that cannot be substantiated though they may not have been complete fabrications. Pontoise died on 4 December 1304 at his manor at Wolvesey, close to his newly founded college dedicated to St Elizabeth of Hungary, and was buried on the north side of the choir of his cathedral church.<br>
