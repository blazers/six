<span class="headword">Dickenson,  John</span>  (<em>c.</em>1570&#150;1635/6), <span class="occ">author and government official</span>, began and ended his career in London but spent much of his adult life in the Low Countries and Germany. Nothing is known of his early life. He probably studied at Cambridge and may be identified with a pensioner at Clare College who matriculated in Easter term 1586.<br>
<br>In 1591 Dickenson published his first work, <span class="italic">Deorum concessus</span> (&#145;The Assembly of the Gods&#146;), a scholastic satire in Latin hexameters. This was followed by three English works, of which the most rewarding is <span class="italic">Arisbas: Euphues amongst his Slumbers</span> (1594). Although the title points to John Lyly, the erudite dedication to Sir Edward Dyer and the epistle to the reader tout the work's more substantial Sidneian lineage. The work itself mingles Sir Philip Sidney and dashes of Heliodorus, Apuleius, and Ovid in an Arcadian dreamscape. Interspersed are elegant lyrics which include avant-garde trochaic and classical metres: poetically Dickenson is fluent and up to date. <span class="italic">Arisbas</span> manages a compendious breadth of contemporary and classical literary reference, often by avowed digression.<br>
<br>A similar pastoral dream vision frames Dickenson's <span class="italic">The Shepheardes Complaint: a Passionate Eclogue, Written in English Hexameters</span>. The work's date is unknown; it is usually given as 1596, but references to recent publications at the work's start, and allusions to this work in <span class="italic">Arisbas</span>, suggest 1592&#150;3. Three of its lyrics were reprinted in <span class="italic">Englands Helicon</span> (1600).<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">Greene in Conceipt</span> (1598) is now remembered for its title-page depiction of Robert Greene scribbling in his winding-sheet. The work raises Greene &#145;from his grave to write the tragique historie of faire <i>Valeria</i> of London&#146; and owes as much again to Geoffrey Chaucer and Boccaccio, managing a calculatedly absurd density of similes, proverbs, and adduced exempla per page. Five more lyrics, one in classical hexameters, enliven the racy exemplary narrative of an old man and his young wife. Other works may be lost&#151;the author mentions &#145;some sleight translations of generall novelties&#146; in the epistle to <span class="italic">Greene in Conceipt</span>.<br>
<br>In 1598 Dickenson was hired by the bookseller Adam Islip to translate Louis Leroy's French version of Aristotle's <span class="italic">Politics</span> (1568; 1576), complete with Leroy's discursive introduction and massive commentary (based primarily on comparison to Plato and to classical and recent history). Dickenson dedicated the work to Sir Robert Sidney, and allowed his own name to be printed only in the presentation copy, now at Shrewsbury School (in all other copies the dedicatory epistle is signed only &#145;I.D.&#146;, the initials which the self-effacing Dickenson liked all his title-pages to bear). <span class="italic">Aristotles Politiques, or, Discourses of Government</span> advertises not only Dickenson's mastery of Latin, Greek, and French (the diplomatic language of the Low Countries), but also his familiarity with political theory and history. Dickenson may have already been employed as a spy in the Low Countries  (<span class="italic">Salisbury MSS</span>, 5.254). But Aristotle seems to have been the passport to the next stage of his career.<br>
<br>As governor of Flushing, Robert Sidney may have been responsible for Dickenson's employment as secretary to George Gilpin, the queen's agent at The Hague. Dickenson later called Gilpin his Maecenas, for the post afforded him time to write his <span class="italic">Speculum tragicum</span>, printed at Delft in 1601. Dedicated to Gilpin, the <span class="italic">Speculum</span> offers Latin prose accounts of the most spectacular downfalls of kings and princes in the previous century, and includes a full account of the last days of the earl of Essex. When Gilpin died on 4 September 1602 Dickenson first wrote to Cecil and then hastened to London to learn his fate. By November, Ralph Winwood had been appointed Gilpin's successor, and Dudley Carleton had spoken to him to secure Dickenson's position. Ever-expanding editions of the <span class="italic">Speculum</span> were published in 1602, 1603, 1605, and 1611, adding an epitaph for Gilpin, verses to friends, and a set of &#145;Parallela tragica&#146; (for instance Xerxes and Tamburlaine, Ariadne and Rosamund). At Leiden in 1606, Elzevier, who had taken over the publication of <span class="italic">Speculum</span> in 1602, printed Dickenson's <span class="italic">Miscellanea ex historiis Anglicanis concinnata</span>, a work of imaginary letters and orations of figures from English history in Latin verse; those between lovers have a marked affinity to Drayton's <span class="italic">England's Heroical Epistles</span>. According to an autograph note in a gift copy of the <span class="italic">Miscellanea</span> (Bodl. Oxf., MS Wood 332), a French translation of the <span class="italic">Speculum</span> was printed but subsequently called in; it does not appear to have survived.<br>
<br>After this period Dickenson's literary activities ceased and his political experience started to prove more useful to England. Through correspondence and travel he had acquired a grasp of the complexities of the Low Countries and the Holy Roman empire which few could match. The focus of England's diplomatic efforts was shifting from the now independent Dutch United Provinces (for his efforts the states presented Dickenson with a chain and medal worth &pound;60) to the German protestant states. And in November 1610 Dickenson was appointed to act as the English agent to the princes possessioners of the disputed and strategically important J&uuml;lich&#150;Cleves territories, Ernest, marquess of Brandenburg and Wolfgang William of Palatinate&#150;Neuberg, arriving in D&uuml;sseldorf in mid-December. A long letter to Winwood records his first meeting with the two princes, and the Latin address he prepared for them. Despite his ability to negotiate with them in French and Italian, his &#145;credence&#146;, he admitted to the marquess, was in Latin  (Sawyer, 3.243). Many of his letters from these years survive, most notably in the collection of his diplomatic colleague William Trumbull.<br>
<br>In 1613 Dickenson attended Princess Elizabeth from Arnhem to Cologne, meeting and then corresponding with Robert Sidney, and received the dedication of John Stephens's play <span class="italic">Cinthias Revenge</span>. Henry Wotton was sent to The Hague in 1614 to negotiate the J&uuml;lich&#150;Cleves succession, and, soon discouraged, he asked to be joined by Dickenson, &#145;who through his long experience in these countries (where men's minds are not very transparent) will be of great use to me&#146;. The treaty of Xanten concluded, Dickenson returned to London at the end of the year, with a covering note from Wotton to Secretary Winwood: &#145;This bearer is a full dispatch of himself, in whose conversation and erudition we have all taken singular contentment.&#146; Without Dickenson, Wotton admitted, &#145;I had been very naked&#146;  (Smith, 2.53, 67).<br>
<br>On 28 July 1615 James sent Dickenson on a mission to Poland to persuade Sigismund III to suppress the <span class="italic">Alloquiorum Osiecensium &hellip; libri quinque</span> of the Jesuit apologist Gaspar Cichocki, with its inflammatory account of James's career and family history. On 20 October Dickenson delivered his customary Latin address to the king; he may have had further instructions to contribute to a Polish&#150;Swedish conference over Pomerania. It is likely that he married some time after his return, for he now settled in London, being sworn a clerk of the privy council extraordinary on 10 May 1618. The first rumblings of the Thirty Years' War disturbed his domestication: with each vain mission to Brussels to protect the Palatinate and preserve peace (Conway and Weston in 1620; Digby in 1621; Weston in 1622) Dickenson went along as secretary. In June 1626, as Christian IV prepared to invade the empire for the second time, Dickenson was readied for a mission to Denmark via the Netherlands; one rumour was that he was taking a million florins, although the trip may have been overtaken by events. On 7 November 1622 he had been granted one of the four ordinary clerkships of the privy council, a post he kept to his death and which allowed time for business ventures with his friend John More, in part directed to paying off the debts of their late master, Secretary Winwood. The letters to the Trumbulls from this period show a warmer, wittier, and happier man than is previously apparent. He had four children, all of whom survived him: Joanna (<i>b</i>. 1618); John (<i>b</i>. 1622); George; and Elizabeth (<i>b</i>. 1627). His wife, Elizabeth, died after giving birth to her namesake, and was buried in the church of St Martin-in-the-Fields on 1 June 1627. Dickenson was buried beside her on 11 January 1636. The council acted to sort the papers in his study in the Strand; administration of his estate was granted to the surveyor-general, Charles Harbord, on 7 March.<br>
<br>Learned and analytical, Dickenson is in his literary writings as in his political letters a master of the small details. His polyglot talents sometimes lead to verbosity, and those of his often colourful letters not in Latin are peppered with Latin tags. But his ability to unpick the wording of treaties, where ambiguous syntax and confusions of translation were rife, and his insightful analyses of people and politics, were valued. The veteran French diplomat Jean Hotman feared diverting Dickenson from his studies when the two lodged together in D&uuml;sseldorf. Dickenson himself complained about only one kind of diplomatic duty, as he wrote to his colleague Trumbull: &#145;for what have we to doe with Germane complements and daily drinking?&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 72283, fol. 11<i>r</i>). His Latinity and circumspection have hindered his reputation as an author: only recently has it become clear that the English author Dickenson was identical with the Latin poet Dickensonus, and <span class="italic">Aristotles Politiques</span> has not previously been identified as his. His role in the movement for English verses in classical metres has been largely ignored. In the broad view his literary achievements show a deep talent and facility, and their function as preparation for a career of state service is notable.<br>
