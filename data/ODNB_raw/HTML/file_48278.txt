<span class="headword">Dyer,  Elinor Mary  Brent-</span>  (1894&#150;1969), <span class="occ">children's writer</span>, was born on 6 April 1894 at 52 Winchester Street, South Shields, co. Durham, the name on her birth certificate being Gladys Eleanor May Dyer. The elder of the two children of Charles Morris Brent Dyer (1856&#150;1911), a surveyor at Lloyds, and his second wife, Eleanor Watson, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Rutherford (1869&#150;1957), she was throughout her life secretive about her background, which was strikingly different from the backgrounds of her fictional heroines. Her childhood home was without garden or inside sanitation, and her parents had separated when she was three&#151;a fact that her mother strove to conceal, representing herself as a widow. She was educated privately at a small local school (1900&#150;12), later attending the City of Leeds Teacher Training College (1915&#150;17). She then worked in a variety of state and private schools; taught, at different times, English, history, Latin, and class-singing, coached hockey and folk-dancing, and ran a Girl Guide company. She also spent a brief period (late 1920s) studying music with Edgar Bainton at the Newcastle Conservatoire. Finally, after five years as a family governess, she founded and ran her own school, the Margaret Roper School (1938&#150;48) in Hereford, where she had settled in 1933.<br>
<br>Despite the many demands on her time, Brent-Dyer published a total of 101 books. Her first, <span class="italic">Gerry Goes to School</span>, was published in 1922, and her output during the ensuing forty-eight years included, in addition to school stories, family, historical, Girl Guide, adventure, and animal stories, a cookery book, and four educational readers. She also wrote plays (several were performed at local theatres), short stories, numerous unpublished poems, and a romantic novel, <span class="italic">Jean of Storms</span>. (This story, originally serialized during 1930 in the <span class="italic">Shields Gazette</span> and rediscovered by chance sixty-five years later, was published in book form in 1996.)<br>
<br>Unquestionably, though, it is Brent-Dyer's <span class="roman">Chalet School</span> series of fifty-nine books, with numerous related titles, which has kept her name alive. Not only have the stories been continuously in print since the first book, <span class="italic">The School at the Chalet</span>, appeared in 1925, but in the late 1990s nearly 100,000 <span class="roman">Chalet School</span> paperbacks were still being sold each year. The 1990s also saw the <span class="roman">Chalet School</span> feature in broadcasts and university theses, and the growth of fan clubs numbering over 1000 members in fifteen different countries. The continuing popularity of these books about the fictional Chalet School, with its trilingual, international, and interdenominational traditions, may owe something to the attractively described settings (Austria, Guernsey, Herefordshire, Wales, Switzerland), but is due mainly to the author's having created, early in the series, a cast of recognizable characters, who reappear in book after book and gradually achieve a kind of reality for the reader, foremost among them being Joey Bettany/Maynard of the unruly black hair. Joey, when portrayed as an impulsive schoolgirl, frequently in trouble and with plenty of faults to balance her many talents, is convincingly drawn; and, although she later becomes far less credible, the comments expressed over the years in fan mail suggest that interest in Joey has undoubtedly helped the <span class="roman">Chalet School</span> to outlive other school stories.<br>
<br>As was common in the genre, the books frequently emphasized religious values, but they are unusual in portraying Roman Catholic girls associating on equal terms with protestants. Brent-Dyer was herself brought up a practising Anglican but converted to Roman Catholicism in 1930, and her stories demonstrate a remarkably ecumenical attitude for the period.<br>
<br>A large, untidy, and heavy-featured woman, described by a former pupil as &#145;a very eccentric and different sort of person&#146;, Brent-Dyer appears to have aroused widely varying reactions in different people. One found her &#145;occasionally tiresome and exhausting&#146;. Another, &#145;a deeply kind and generous woman&#151;surprisingly understanding&#146;. All seem agreed that her &#145;imagination and vitality were amazing&#146;.<br>
<br>Brent-Dyer's final years were spent at 56 Woodlands Road, Redhill, Surrey, where she moved in 1964 to share a house with friends, Phyllis and Sydney Matthewman. Here she died peacefully in her sleep on 20 September 1969. Her grave in Redstone Hill cemetery was marked with a headstone specially commissioned by <span class="roman">Chalet School</span> fans during the 1994 celebrations of her centenary, which also saw commemorative plaques erected in South Shields, Hereford, and the Tyrolean village of Pertisau am Achensee, where Brent-Dyer had spent the holiday that inspired her <span class="roman">Chalet School</span> series.<br>
