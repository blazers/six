<span class="headword">Wilson,  John Gideon</span>  (1876&#150;1963), <span class="occ">bookseller</span>, was born in Glasgow on 9 January 1876, the third of the eight children of James Wilson, a journeyman bookbinder, and his wife, Margaret Miller, who worked as a sheet-folder in the same workshop. He was educated at a board school in Glasgow until his thirteenth year, when he was apprenticed to the bookselling firm of John Smith &amp; Son, Glasgow, an excellent training ground for young booksellers. Here he began the practice of his immense reading, choosing with independent judgement the best of English prose and poetry.<br>
<br>On 9 January 1908 Wilson married Catherine Smart Provan (they had a son and four daughters), after which he went south for the rest of his life. For two years he worked with the publishing firm of Constable &amp; Co., London, and then returned to bookselling with the City firm of Jones and Evans. From 1916 to 1919 he served as a soldier in France, winning the medal for meritorious service. He returned to Jones and Evans until 1923, when at the invitation of the proprietors, Messrs Debenham and Freebody, he went to manage the bookshop of J. and E. Bumpus Ltd.<br>
<br>Wilson's years at Jones and Evans were perhaps the happiest in his experience. The modest premises in the City served as a rendezvous for leading figures in the literary world and Wilson followed the tradition of Evans in regarding bookselling not so much as a matter of retail trade as a service in which bookseller and customer met and shared the experience of contact with the precious manifestations of the spirit of man. It was essentially an affair of individuals, and he became the friend and counsellor of many of the finest creative writers of the time.<br>
<br>In the gracious Old Court House at the corner of Marylebone Lane in Oxford Street, Wilson was to work on a larger stage with growing fame and growing responsibilities. John Wilson of Bumpus emerged as the most famous English bookseller of his time. Presently a fine room was added to the shop in which he organized notable book exhibitions.<br>
<br>In 1935 the lease of the premises expired and was not renewed, the Court House was demolished, and, Debenhams having lost interest in the bookshop, Wilson resolved to re-establish Bumpus as his own enterprise. Helped with capital by his friends he acquired the business, and as chairman and managing director moved to a site in Oxford Street near Marble Arch. The move did not benefit the business, and Wilson had taken on administrative and financial responsibilities which were uncongenial. He maintained his belief in exact attention to detail and, after the shop was closed, might be found for two hours in a small room writing orders for books, notes, and, it was said, addressing labels. This practice obscured his vision of more important aspects of management, and latterly perhaps afforded a refuge from the pressure of financial cares. He found it hard to delegate responsibility, discouraging it in members of his staff; and his generosity in granting credit was abused.<br>
<br>The practice of bookselling was changing: mass production, bulk selling, self-service, and the shadow of the oncoming computer era were warnings that the traditional personal relations of bookseller and customer were &#145;not for the fashion of these times&#146;. The business dwindled; no provision had been made to meet the renewal of the lease on more arduous terms, there were difficulties which the removal of the shop to Baker Street did not resolve, and in 1959, when approaches were being made for the purchase of the firm, the Oracle of the Book Trade in his eighty-third year retired and went home to his books at Pinner, Middlesex, where, shortly before his death, his sight failed him.<br>
<br>Described as &#145;massively wise and unassumedly learned&#146;, this lovable man was endowed with a rare simplicity. In his shop Wilson might be found conversing with the poet laureate or wrapping up the purchase of a schoolboy. His assessment of authors and their books was quick and sure, and his advice, always valid, was freely given to authors, publishers, and his fellow booksellers.<br>
<br>As chairman of the educational board of the Associated Booksellers of Great Britain and Ireland, Wilson designed the training syllabus for young booksellers, and his manual <span class="italic">The Business of Bookselling</span> (1930) remains a treasury of good counsel. For some years he edited <span class="italic">The Odd Volume</span>, an annual miscellany published in support of the Book Trade Provident Society. In 1948 he was appointed CBE. Wilson died at his home, 29 West End Avenue, Pinner, on 6 September 1963.<br>
