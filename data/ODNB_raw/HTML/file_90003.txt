<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Sandford,  (Christopher) Jeremy</span>  (1930&#150;2003), <span class="occ">writer</span>, was born in London on 5 December 1930, the only son (there were two daughters) of Christopher Sandford (1902&#150;1983), typographer and publisher, and his wife, Lettice Mackintosh, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Rate (1902&#150;1993), wood engraver and illustrator. His father owned and ran the Golden Cockerel Press from 1933 to 1959, publishing fine books illustrated with wood engravings, many of them by Lettice Sandford; in later life she also became an authority on corn dollies.<br>
<br>Sandford was brought up in the beautiful surroundings of Eye Manor, near Leominster, Herefordshire. He was educated at Eton College and New College, Oxford, where he read English and was regarded as one of the most flamboyant undergraduates of his generation. He graduated with a second-class degree in 1954. He was already fond of music at school and played the clarinet in an RAF band during his national service. This inspired an early radio play, <span class="italic">Dreaming Bandsmen</span> (1956). On 14 February 1957, at St Patrick's Church, Westminster, he married the twenty-year-old Nell Mary Dunn, writer, and daughter of Philip Dunn, a millionaire Canadian industrialist. The wedding reception was held at the Ritz Hotel but the couple then moved across the Thames to live in the largely working-class district of Battersea, where Nell Dunn took a job in a sweet factory while writing her novels <span class="italic">Up the Junction</span> (1963) and <span class="italic">Poor Cow</span> (1967). They had three sons, Roc, Reuben, and Jem.<br>
<br>Sandford himself became famous after the showing in 1966 of the television play <span class="italic">Cathy Come Home</span>, which highlighted the plight of the homeless in Britain. The original inspiration was the story of a Battersea neighbour. The play, written by Sandford and directed by Ken Loach, won prizes around the world and was a factor in the growth of Shelter, the campaign for the homeless. It was described almost forty years later as &#145;surely the most talked-about television play ever&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Guardian</span>, 15 May 2003). Sandford's next television play, <span class="italic">Edna the Inebriate Woman</span> (1971), based on a woman he had met while carrying out research in a Salvation Army hostel in east London, did not arouse the same public sympathy for alcoholics that his earlier play had for the homeless, although it won several awards. There was to have been a third play on Gypsies to form a trilogy but it was never completed.<br>
<br>Sandford was intrigued by Romany Gypsies as well as &#145;New (Age) Travellers&#146;&#151;house-dwellers who left home and took to the road to live in the style of traditional Gypsies. His paternal grandmother, Mary, the widow of the ninth Baron Carbery before marrying Arthur Wellesley Sandford, had travelled on the road and been a member of the Gypsy Lore Society. In her old age Sandford's father brought her and her caravan to Herefordshire. Later Sandford edited her diary as <span class="italic">Mary Carbery's West Cork Journals</span> (1998).<br>
<br>Sandford attended the first World Romany Congress, held near London in 1971. He then became involved with the Gypsy Council and for a short time was editor of its magazine, <span class="italic">Romano Drom</span>. He felt obliged to resign this unpaid position after he was criticized for giving space in its pages to a rival organization, the Romany Guild. He continued his involvement with the community, however, carrying out a series of interviews with a number of Gypsies and Travellers, the result being the book <span class="italic">Gypsies</span> (1973), republished in 1999 as <span class="italic">Rokkering to the Gorjios</span> (&#145;Talking to the non-Gypsies&#146;). Sandford's other publications at this time included the books <span class="italic">Prostitutes</span> (1975) and <span class="italic">In Search of the Magic Mushroom</span> (1972), as well as articles for both tabloids and broadsheets. He continued to write for radio, again taking up the cause of outsiders in society. A Nigerian who was found drowned in a river in Leeds in unexplained circumstances was the subject of the radio play <span class="italic">Smiling David</span> (1975).<br>
<br>Sandford's marriage to Nell Dunn ended in 1986 and on 27 September the same year he married Philippa Sophia Finnis, a 31-year-old singer, and daughter of John Frank Finnis, antique dealer. They moved from London to Hatfield Court, a large Jacobean house near Leominster where the extensive grounds provided a regular stopping place for New Age Travellers in their caravans and buses. The interior was as sparsely furnished as had been his Battersea home. His association with the Gypsy Council was resurrected after the election of a new committee. He worked with its chairman, the poet Charles Smith, on a CD/video of songs, <span class="italic">Spirit of the Gypsies</span> (1999), and edited a book of Travellers' songs, <span class="italic">Songs from the Roadside: 100 Years of Gypsy Music</span> (1995).<br>
<br>Sandford never lost his interest in music and as well as the clarinet he could also play the tin whistle, but he mainly performed on the accordion. He led a band accompanying so-called circle or sacred dance and played at gatherings of the Rainbow family and other alternative groups. One of the campers was later to write in the book of condolences opened at Hatfield Court after Sandford's death: &#145;we danced to your wonderful playing and had the joy of your company around the fire&#146;  (&#145;Remembering Jeremy Sandford&#146;). In 2002 he suffered a stroke but continued to work on his autobiography and&#151;together with Philippa&#151;a film about schizophrenia. By then he and Philippa had separated, though they remained in close contact, as did Sandford and Nell Dunn. He died in his sleep at Hatfield Court on 12 May 2003 of heart failure and was buried at Eye church on 19 May. He was survived by his three sons. He was remembered by his friends as a man of great charm with a wide variety of interests. For the general public his legacy was <span class="italic">Cathy Come Home</span>, and his efforts to publicize the problems of the less fortunate members of society.<br>
