<span class="headword">Perkins <span class="st"> [Maundeville]</span>,  William</span> <span class="st"> [<em>alias </em>Jack Sharp of Wigmoreland]</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1431), <span class="occ">rebel and alleged Lollard</span>, was the bailiff of Abingdon, whose name is recorded in official documents as William Perkins but given in some chronicles as Maundeville. His public appearance as a rebel under the name Jack Sharp covers only a few days in 1431, but he may have been a man accused by an approver in 1424, and was almost certainly identical with one whose arrest was ordered in 1427 to answer to &#145;divers transgressions&#146;. In neither of these earlier cases, however, is there any suspicion that he was accused of heresy. The troubles of 1431 apparently began in London in March, but there were more widespread manifestations of discontent in the south midlands and as far north as Coventry. Plots were afoot at Abingdon in April, and on 9 May open disorder broke out at Salisbury. Perkins may have been present at the Salisbury riots, but his main share in the revolt was six days later, when he led a group of rebels from East Hendred to attack Abingdon Abbey. The troubles created considerable alarm in government circles, for the protector, Humphrey, duke of Gloucester (<i>d</i>. 1447), found it necessary to ride from Greenwich to Oxford to deal with the rising personally. After its failure Perkins took flight, but he was captured in Oxford, tried before Gloucester, condemned, and beheaded&#151;an appropriate fate for a traitor&#151;with seven others. His prominence in the rising, which is suggested by the chroniclers, is confirmed by the fact that his head was set on London Bridge as a deterrent to other rebels.<br>
<br>The nature of &#145;Sharp's revolt&#146; is uncertain. It was strongly anti-clerical, because bills were circulated in the form of a petition to parliament, based on the Lollard disendowment bill of 1410, which in turn looked back to proposals voiced in 1395. There is however little evidence of doctrinal irregularity, and it is significant that Perkins was executed rather than burnt. Only one chronicle source refers to a case of eucharistic heresy during the upheaval, and there was nothing to connect Perkins with this. The pseudonym &#145;Jack Sharp of Wigmoreland&#146;, which he assumed, has both social and political overtones. The first half echoes such names as &#145;Jack Straw&#146; with the implication of peasant discontent, while the second may well be hinting at the Mortimer territorial base inherited by Richard, duke of York (<i>d</i>. 1460), who represented an alternative claim to the throne. It may well have been these latter elements, as much as the anti-clerical tone of the manifesto, that prompted the authorities to suppress it so ruthlessly.<br>
