<span class="headword">Berkeley,  Walter  of</span>  (<em>d.</em> <em>c.</em>1193), <span class="occ">administrator</span>, was one of a number of Anglo-Norman knights from south-west England who went to seek their fortunes in Scotland during the middle decades of the twelfth century. His parentage is unknown, but he was almost certainly named after the village of Berkley, near Frome, in Somerset. He arrived in Scotland with his brother Robert <i>c</i>.1165, immediately entered royal service, and was appointed to succeed Philip de Valognes as chief chamberlain of William the Lion <i>c</i>.1171. He held this office until his death, when it reverted to his predecessor. Walter of Berkeley was regularly at King William's court before and after his appointment, but almost nothing is known in detail about his important financial functions as chamberlain. Robert, who became lord of Maxton, Roxburghshire, probably by marriage to a native heiress, also frequently attended on William the Lion, often at Walter's side. Walter fought in William's campaigns against northern England in 1173&#150;4, and in December 1174 was named among the twenty earls and barons of Scotland required to find hostages under the treaty of Falaise.<br>
<br>Royal favour had by 1182 brought Berkeley sizeable estates to be held for knight-service, most notably Inverkeilor, Angus, later the barony of Redcastle, and Newton, near Hawick, later the barony of Chamberlain Newton. Robert of London, a kinsman from Somerset, gave him property at St Boswells and the land of Plenmeller, near Haltwhistle, in the Scots king's liberty of Tynedale. Walter carried Scottish royal influence into the semi-independent province of Galloway, where he was endowed with the large lordship of Urr by Uhtred, son of Fergus, <i>c</i>.1170 and very likely built Urr's great motte-and-bailey castle, the most impressive of all surviving Scottish earthworks of this type. He was a benefactor of the Tironensian monks of Arbroath Abbey, and was reconciled shortly before his death with the Cistercian abbey of Holm Cultram, Cumberland, part of whose territory in Galloway he had engrossed. It is possible, though by no means certain, that he married first an unidentified lady who was the heir of Ardoyne, Aberdeenshire. Walter's (second?) wife, Eve, may have been a daughter of his patron Uhtred, lord of Galloway. She was subsequently married to Robert de Quincy, justiciar of Lothian, after whose death <i>c</i>.1200 she purchased land at Stenton, Haddingtonshire, and granted it to Melrose Abbey for the salvation of the souls of her two husbands and of her brother, Roland, perhaps Uhtred's son and successor of that name.<br>
<br>Walter and Eve had a son called John who must have died young, and Walter was succeeded by two daughters. Of these, Agatha surrendered her claims to Ardoyne in return for land in Laurencekirk, Mearns, after her marriage by <i>c</i>.1190 to Humphrey, son of Theobald de Adeville (probably Addeville, near St L&ocirc;, in Normandy). Humphrey took the surname of Berkeley, and from them descend nearly all the Scottish Barclays. The other daughter, of unknown name, carried Urr and Inverkeilor to her husband, Enguerrand de Balliol, probably a younger son of Eustace de Balliol (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1208) of Bywell. The date of Walter's death is not recorded, but <i>c</i>.1193 can be inferred from the fact that his name then disappears from the witness-clauses of Scottish royal charters.<br>
