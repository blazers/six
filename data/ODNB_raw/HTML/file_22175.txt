<span class="headword">Phillips,  Thomas</span>  (1760&#150;1851), <span class="occ">philanthropist and surgeon</span>, was born on 6 July 1760 in London, the son of Thomas Phillips, an officer in the excise revenue department. The family originated from Radnorshire, and Phillips was sent to live in that county as a boy because of his ill health in London; he later attributed his longevity to his hill-climbing youth in mid-Wales. He completed his schooling at Kempston in Bedfordshire, before serving an apprenticeship with an apothecary at Hay in Brecknockshire, and later being a pupil of the celebrated London surgeon John Hunter of Jermyn Street. In 1780 Phillips entered the King's Naval Service (the medical service of the Royal Navy), travelling to Canadian waters. On his return to England he joined the East India Company, qualifying as a member of the Company (later the Royal College) of Surgeons on 6 June 1782. He then worked in Calcutta and in 1796 he was sent to inspect hospitals in Botany Bay, Australia. He returned to England in 1798, and in 1800 he married Althea Edwards, daughter of the rector of Cusop in Herefordshire. There were no children of the marriage.<br>
<br>In 1802 Phillips and his wife sailed to India, where he became superintending surgeon and a member of the Bengal medical board. In India he sought to wean soldiers from undesirable habits by providing them with books, establishing small libraries in mess rooms. In 1817 he returned to live in London, a rich man from his commercial undertakings in India and with a full-pay pension of &pound;1500.<br>
<br>Phillips devoted his remaining years to philanthropic and educational works, being anxious to give away as much money as possible before he died, so that he could see it well used. His relatives, to whom he was known as the Nabob, were well cared for, but Phillips's main interest was in buying books on a vast scale and giving them away to reading rooms and scientific institutes all over England and Wales. At the time of his death there were more than 50,000 books in his house awaiting distribution. St David's College in Lampeter, Cardiganshire, benefited greatly from Phillips's philanthropy. He sent over 22,500 books there from 1834, he endowed six scholarships in the college, and he established in his will a chair of natural science. He was, however, so distressed by the college's refusal to accept his offer of an endowed chair in Welsh that in 1847 he founded the Welsh Educational Institution (later Llandovery College) at Llandovery, Carmarthenshire; there Welsh had a strong place. He endowed closed scholarships at Jesus College, Oxford, for Llandovery pupils and he gave 7000 books to the school.<br>
<br>Phillips died on 13 June 1851 at 5 Brunswick Square, his London home. He was in his ninety-first year and had been ill for less than a month before his death. He made his will on 3 June 1851, leaving &pound;52,433. He was buried in the crypt of St Pancras Church, London, next to his wife, who had died on 13 September 1841.<br>
