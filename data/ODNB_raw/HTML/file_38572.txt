<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Campoli,  Alfredo</span>  (1906&#150;1991), <span class="occ">violinist</span>, was born on 20 October 1906 in Rome, the son of Romeo Campoli, an orchestral leader and violin professor at the Accademia di Santa Cecilia, and his wife, Elvira, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Celi, an opera singer. From the age of four he was taught the violin by his father, who had him listen to recordings of the Italian baritone singer Mattia Battistini in order to acquire a bel canto style of playing. The family moved to London in 1911, and at the age of ten the young prodigy made his d&eacute;but as a soloist. He then gave recitals, and won several first prizes and two gold medals, one of which was at the London music festival in 1919 for his performance of Mendelssohn's violin concerto. In the same year he gave a brilliant first recital at the Wigmore Hall, and in 1921 a series of six impressive recitals there resulted in his engagement to play for the International Celebrity Concerts. So, at the age of fifteen, he toured the British Isles with the singers Dame Nellie Melba and Dame Clara Butt. He became a very successful concert artist over the next few years. He also spent time in light music, and in 1926 was asked to form a small group to record light classics, of which a serenade by Heykins became a great favourite. Campoli's Salon Orchestra played at the Trocadero Grill Room in 1927 and at the Dorchester Hotel in 1931. This experience proved useful because during the depression of the 1930s, when life was difficult for most classical musicians, Campoli managed to earn a living with his Salon Orchestra, which gained immense popularity through its hundreds of broadcasts of light music, public concerts, and many recordings. The serious side of his career was maintained by giving recitals and performances of concertos throughout the country, and he first appeared at the Henry Wood Promenade Concerts in 1938, when he performed Paganini's concerto no. 1.<br>
<br>Regarded as an enemy alien when the Second World War broke out in 1939, Campoli was barred from performing in public, but he obtained British naturalization in the same year, disbanded his orchestra, and spent the war years playing in concerts for the troops at home and overseas. At the same time he worked at expanding his classical repertory. In 1942 he married Joy Burbridge, who had been Sir Adrian Boult's secretary. Campoli performed the Brahms violin concerto at a Prom concert in 1944 and the Tchaikovsky concerto the following year.<br>
<br>After the war Campoli resumed his classical concert career and, despite some initial snobbery by those who regarded him simply as a &#145;salon&#146; player, he soon gained a reputation for his artistry and fine interpretations and appeared under such conductors as Sir Thomas Beecham, Sir Adrian Boult, Sir Malcolm Sargent, and Sir John Barbirolli. He also played abroad, and in 1950 he toured Australia and New Zealand. He made his American d&eacute;but in 1953 with the New York Philharmonic at Carnegie Hall, playing Lalo's <span class="italic">Symphonie espagnole</span>, then toured America and Canada. In Russia in 1956 he performed the Walton concerto, and he became very popular there. At one concert in Leningrad an enthusiastic audience had him play eleven encores. In 1955 he gave the premi&egrave;re in Moscow of the Bliss concerto, which was dedicated to him. He gave many recitals with the pianist Gerald Moore, and during the 1960s formed a duo with the pianist Valerie Tryon. In 1978 he gave a recital at the Wigmore Hall.<br>
<br>When he retired at the age of seventy-five his wife said that Campoli put his Dragonetti Stradivarius of 1700 &#145;away and never took it out of the case again&#146;  (<span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span>, 30 March 1991). Unusually, this Stradivarius still had its original peg-holes and neck. Campoli continued to teach at his Highgate home, was an excellent croquet and bridge player, read books on music, bridge, and tennis, and owned more than 2000 records. When younger, he played tennis and table tennis and was south London junior snooker champion. His sense of humour was revealed by Monica Parkhurst: his reason for being known professionally as Campoli was that &#145;when it was announced &#147;Alfredo Campoli is now going to play &hellip;&#148;, he believed people tended to hear &#147;I'm afraid old Campoli is now going to play &hellip;&#148;&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Independent</span>, 5 April 1991).<br>
<br>Campoli was a greatly loved and respected performer whose Italian singing style of playing was coupled with a dazzling technique and a warm, sweet, beautiful tone. He kept all four fingers on the bow (except, of course, for <i>sautill&eacute;</i>), would not use a shoulder-rest, disliked gymnastics, and practised every day. From his many recordings a number of gems, such as the Bruch, Mendelssohn, and Elgar concertos, have been reissued on CD. He died on 27 March 1991 at Princes Risborough, survived by his wife.<br>
