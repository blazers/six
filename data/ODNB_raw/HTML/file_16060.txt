<span class="headword">Lanyon, Sir  (William) Owen</span>  (1842&#150;1887), <span class="occ">army officer and colonial official</span>, born in co. Antrim, Ireland, on 21 July 1842, was the son of the civil engineer and architect <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16059/', "Sir Charles Lanyon (1813&#150;1889)")</script> of The Abbey, White Abbey, near Belfast, co. Antrim, and his wife, Elizabeth Helen (<i>d</i>. 1858), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21011/', "Jacob Owen")</script> of the board of works, Dublin. Like his brothers, Lanyon was educated at Bromsgrove School, Worcestershire (1855&#150;9), which then took many boys from Ireland. On 21 December 1860 he was commissioned ensign by purchase in the 6th Royal Warwickshire regiment, with which he served in Jamaica during the 1865 insurrection. The same year he was appointed aide-de-camp to the general commanding in the West Indies. He purchased his lieutenancy, 6th foot, in 1866, exchanged to the 2nd West India regiment, and in 1868 purchased a company. He was aide-de-camp and private secretary to Sir John Peter Grant, governor of Jamaica from 1868 to 1873. In 1873, and until invalided in January 1874, Lanyon served as aide-de-camp to Sir Garnet Wolseley in the Second Anglo-Asante War, suffering fever and gaining Wolseley's praise (brevet of major). In 1874 he was sent by the Colonial Office to the Gold Coast on a special mission connected with the abolition of slavery, for which he was in August 1875 made CMG. From September 1875 to April 1880 he was administrator of the diamond fields territory, Griqualand West. He improved the finances and raised and commanded the volunteer force there during the Griqua rebellion and the 1878 invasion of the Batlapin chief, Botlasitsie, whom he defeated and subdued. He was thanked by the home government and the Cape legislature (CB, November 1878, brevet of lieutenant-colonel).<br>
<br>Appointed by Sir Michael Hicks Beach (colonial secretary, 1878&#150;80), from March 1879 Lanyon was administrator of the Transvaal under the successive high commissioners Wolseley and Sir George Colley. Lanyon assisted Sir Bartle Frere in his negotiations with the Transvaal Boers. Wolseley was glad to leave the Transvaal administration in &#145;Billy's competent hands&#146;  (Lehmann, <span class="italic">First Boer War</span>, 63). Lanyon concentrated on tax gathering in which he was, if sometimes acting arbitrarily and illegally, notably successful. He claimed to have produced a surplus in the former bankrupt republic. This was disputed: according to Lord Kimberley there was an &#145;enormous and hopeless deficit&#146;  (de Kiewiet, 279). On Wolseley's recommendation Lanyon was made KCMG in April 1880: disliking the name William, he called himself Sir Owen.<br>
<br>Lanyon, like Wolseley, despised the Boers, whom he considered a &#145;semi-civilized people&#146;. Distant and overbearing, he ignored their wishes. They disliked him. He was tall, dark, tanned, and swarthy, and they knew of his West Indian service. They believed he had African blood, was a &#145;West Indian bastard&#146;, and that they were being oppressed by a &#145;kaffir&#146;&#151;a further British insult. Kruger wrote in his memoirs that Lanyon was &#145;absolutely unfitted for this difficult task&#146;  (Kruger, 1.154). The new Gladstone government (April 1880) retained Lanyon in post. He responded to local press criticism by imposing restrictions on newspapers. As Boer unrest increased he assured the Colonial Office that they were contented, and requested a substantial salary increase. Following his reports the imperial government reduced British troops in the Transvaal; Lanyon also sent volunteers away to the Basuto &#145;gun war&#146;. In December rebel Boers declared their republic and attacked British troops (the Anglo-Transvaal War, 1880&#150;81). A few days before, Lanyon had written to Colley that the Boers were &#145;mortal cowards, so anything they do will be but a spark in the pan&#146;  (Lehmann, <span class="italic">First Boer War</span>, 101), and in January 1881 he wrote to the Colonial Office that &#145;the collapse will be as sudden as the outbreak&#146;  (ibid., 102). The British in Pretoria were blockaded rather than besieged. The troops there were commanded by Colonel William Bellairs, an experienced and cautious officer. In February, Lanyon urged an offensive against the Boers; Bellairs believed it imprudent but acquiesced. The attack (Red House laager, 12 February) was a disaster, with heavy British casualties. After the war, in April 1881, Lanyon was recalled and replaced by Bellairs. Lanyon's failure in the Transvaal ruined his reputation and effectively ended his career. He was criticized in the British press and later by historians: according to C. W. de Kiewiet, Lanyon was guilty of &#145;stupid ignorance&#146; of the Boers, and &#145;his conduct as a soldier was conceited, fatuous and shortsighted&#146;  (de Kiewiet, 273). He never again held a Colonial Office post.<br>
<br>Lanyon served in the 1882 Egyptian campaign as colonel on the staff and base commander at Isma&#145;iliyyah (third class Osmanieh), and also served with the Gordon relief expedition (1884&#150;5). In 1882 he married Florence, daughter of J. M. Levy of Grosvenor Street, London; she died in 1883. Lanyon died of cancer at New York, after a long and painful illness, on 6 April 1887, aged forty-four.<br>
