<span class="headword">Sievier,  Robert William</span>  (1794&#150;1865), <span class="occ">engraver, sculptor, and scientist</span>, was born in London on 24 July 1794. He decided to become an engraver after gaining a silver medal from the Society of Arts in 1812 for a pen-and-ink drawing. He trained under John Young and afterwards with Edward Scriven, and on 8 January 1818 entered the Royal Academy Schools. He produced at this time a large number of stipple engravings after artists such as Hans Holbein, Sir Thomas Lawrence, William Etty, and G. S. Newton.<br>
<br>To improve his knowledge of the figure Sievier learned to model in clay and studied anatomy under Joshua Brookes. Subsequently, around 1823, he gave up engraving in favour of sculpture. &#145;Rapidly improving&#146;, according to Redgrave, &#145;his great facility of seizing the likeness and characteristic expression of his sitters led many persons of distinction to his studio&#146;  (Redgrave, <span class="italic">Artists</span>, 394). His portrait busts included those of Lord Chancellor Eldon (exh. RA, 1825), Sir Thomas Lawrence (1830; Soane Museum, London), and Prince Albert, the prince consort (1842; Royal Collection). He also executed several memorial statues, including those of the physician Edward Jenner (1825; Gloucester Cathedral) and William Harcourt, third Earl Harcourt (1832; St Michael, Stanton Harcourt, Oxfordshire), and a large number of church monuments. He exhibited at the Royal Academy from 1822 to 1844, at the British Institution from 1825 to 1831, and at the Society of British Artists from 1829 to 1843. Sievier's portraiture was characterized by a bold naturalism which sometimes tended towards exaggeration, especially in the depiction of facial expressions and fleshy form&#151;a manner in which his work is comparable to that of his contemporary Samuel Joseph. He had an eye for detail&#151;for example, in his reliefs for monuments&#151;gained from his training as an engraver. Sievier also designed some &#145;ideal&#146; works, including figures of a <span class="italic">Bacchante Asleep</span> (1824) and <span class="italic">Musidora</span> (1830), which were formerly in the collection of Joseph Neeld at Grittleton House, Wiltshire, <span class="italic">The Three Graces</span> (1824; Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery), after Canova, and genre subjects such as <span class="italic">Boy and Tortoise</span> (exh. RA, 1829). His chimney-piece figures of <span class="italic">Bacchus</span> and <span class="italic">Ariadne</span> (1833) are at Chatsworth, Derbyshire.<br>
<br>In the latter part of his life Sievier abandoned sculpture and devoted himself to science, being involved in rubber production and in the early development of electric telegraphy. According to Redgrave he was &#145;of an active inventive mind &hellip; and distinguished also by his manners and power of conversation&#146;  (Redgrave, <span class="italic">Artists</span>, 395). He was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1841. Sievier died on 28 April 1865 at his home, 35 Rochester Road, Camden Town, London, and was buried in Kensal Green cemetery. With his wife, Ann Eliza (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1811), Sievier had a son, Robert Moore Sievier (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1827), who was admitted to the Royal Academy Schools on 2 April 1845 to study sculpture.<br>
