<span class="headword">Starkey,  Thomas</span>  (<em>c.</em>1498&#150;1538), <span class="occ">humanist and royal servant</span>, was born in Cheshire to another Thomas Starkey, probably at Wrenbury, where the family was prominent. His father probably held office in Wales and was wealthy enough to pay for his son's education. His mother, Maud, was a daughter of Sir John Mainwaring, one of the wealthiest men in the palatinate.<h2>
<a name="EducationinEnglandandItaly"></a>Education in England and Italy</h2>Starkey may have gone to Magdalen College School before taking both his BA (30 June 1516) and MA (18 March 1521) at Magdalen College, Oxford. From 1518 to 1522 he was a fellow of Magdalen. He was friendly with the noted grammarian Robert Whittington, and also knew Edward Wotton, Thomas Lupset, and, above all, Reginald Pole, at Oxford, to all three of whom he became very close. Starkey may have absorbed from Whittington the Ciceronian vocabulary that was fundamental to his later political thought. In 1522 Starkey gave his regent lectures on natural philosophy and Thomas Wolsey appointed him a university proctor for six months. Possibly through Lupset, Starkey came in contact with John Colet's Pauline and Augustinian ideas about disdain for the world in preference for a Christian community, as well as about the need for justification by faith followed by an active life.<br>
<br>Probably in 1523 Starkey went with Lupset to Padua, where he is certainly recorded on 10 April 1525 when he witnessed Wotton's MD examination. Although there is no direct evidence that he joined Pole's household, he knew Pole's principal tutor Niccol&ograve; Leonico well. It looks very much as if Starkey must also have known Pietro Bembo, former papal secretary and one of the most important poets and theorists of language of the early sixteenth century; Bembo was one of the first people Pole had met in Padua. It may be that Bembo's <span class="italic">Prose della volgar lingua</span> (1526; &#145;On prose written in the vernacular&#146;) inspired Starkey's decision to write his most important work in English. Leonico included Starkey together with his old friends Cuthbert Tunstall and William Latimer in a greeting of March 1529. By then Starkey had certainly entered Pole's service as secretary. Starkey accompanied Pole to Paris in 1529&#150;30 (immediately after their return Starkey became rector of Great Mongeham, Kent, on 31 July 1530), and at that time and during Pole's retirement to Sheen thereafter, Starkey drafted his most famous work, the &#145;Dialogue between Pole and Lupset&#146;. It was largely completed in its single manuscript&#151;probably not the first draft&#151;by 1532, with a few later touches added.<h2>
<a name="TheDialogue"></a>The Dialogue</h2>A broad and syncretic humanist education manifests itself throughout the &#145;Dialogue&#146;. Starkey's dialogue, the first in English to deal with serious matters of the commonwealth, was nevertheless a playful creation. Carefully honed rhetorical skills allowed Starkey to play constantly with language, fulfilling the humanist demand for copiousness. Key terms were repeatedly defined in slightly different fashion, as Starkey used language as much to coax a new world into existence as to analyse an existing one. The work rested on the most extensive use known of the slippery metaphor of the body politic, reflecting Starkey's twin interests in natural philosophy and civil science. Originally intending the work for his patron Pole in order to persuade him to take his proper place at (or near) the head of the English commonwealth, Starkey later changed his aim and tried unsuccessfully to redirect the work to Henry VIII. This change of audience produced several major instabilities in the work's interpretation, since Henry in no way resembled the elective monarch surrounded by his properly trained noble counsellors that Starkey had in mind.<br>
<br>Starkey derived his system of interlocking councils designed to check royal (and papal) power from a typically complex set of sources. One was the Venetian government, making Starkey's perhaps the earliest use of a model that would become pervasive in seventeenth-century England. He almost certainly knew the Florentine republican exile Donato Giannotti's explication of the Venetian constitution, written in Padua during Starkey's time there and with Leonico cast as the principal speaker. He must also have been familiar with the ideas behind the work of Pole's patron Gasparo Contarini, <span class="italic">De magistratibus et republica Venetorum</span> (&#145;On the magistrates and republic of the Venetians&#146;). Native late medieval English ideas of baronial government probably also entered in. This mixture produced an apparent precocity that has often led the central ideas in Starkey's work to be fathered on Marsilio of Padua, the fourteenth-century political thinker who developed a naturalistic view of civil society designed to exclude papal power. In fact, Starkey had no need of Marsilio's example, since they drew in common on Aristotle, whose idea that the mixed constitution was superior because of its combination of all three of the perfect forms of government (monarchy, aristocracy, and democracy) undergirded the &#145;Dialogue&#146;. Like Aristotle, he placed greatest emphasis on the aristocratic component. Starkey further drew from Aristotle the tenet that happiness depended on the unity of body and soul, and required both friends and material goods for its completion.<br>
<br>In addition to its proposals to restrict the monarch's power, the reformist edge of the &#145;Dialogue&#146; most sharply challenged the nobility. Noble education needed a complete overhaul in order to fit it for service to the common weal. Perhaps Starkey's most radical individual proposal was that civil law should replace common law, thereby effectively overthrowing the Norman yoke, a concept with which he was familiar, even if he did not yet use the term. Only the gentry and nobility were to be trained as lawyers; dissolved monasteries, especially St Albans, rich and convenient to London, would become their academies. Starkey proposed a similar scheme for ecclesiastical government where an aristocratic mixed constitution would limit the pope's power in the same way as the king's. This, too, has been blamed on Marsilio, but again Starkey had no need of his ideas since, as before, they were working in a common tradition in which the latter's position was much more conservative and mainstream. Starkey was especially well acquainted with Parisian conciliarism, a school of thought stressing the importance of general councils to the church's government, and was exposed to it at just the time he began to write his work. Starkey's commitment to conciliarism later led him to propose resolving Henry's divorce through the council's agency, which may have been a scheme originally floated in Pole's circles, given Henry Cole's suggestion of the same solution.<h2>
<a name="Furtherstudies"></a>Further studies</h2>While Starkey continued to polish the &#145;Dialogue&#146; for another year or two, he also acted to put its principles into effect in his own career. In company with Pole, he went to Avignon in 1532 and began to study civil law, probably with Gianfrancesco Sannazaro della Ripa, who like Starkey viewed the church as an oligarchy. Pole proceeded to Padua, where Starkey rejoined him and studied privately probably with Marco Mantova Benavides. Mantova belonged to the vibrant Paduan tradition of conciliarism taken straight from its most distinguished representative, Francesco Zabarella, light of the Council of Constance (1414&#150;17) and in philosophy with Marcantonio de Genova, a leading Aristotelian. Starkey moved in the highest circles of the Paduan and Venetian intellectual aristocracy, having as friends the prominent Ciceronian Lazzaro Bonamico (object during Starkey's stay of a dispute involving Pole over whether Bonamico should become a theologian); Benedetto Lampridio, a noted Greek poet, much in demand as tutor in both Padua and Mantua; Contarini; Giovanni Battista Egnazio, a Venetian educator and early polygraph; and the Fleming Jan van Kampen, whose lectures on biblical hermeneutics Starkey undoubtedly attended. All of these friends and teachers as well as Pole, with the possible exception of Bonamico, shared with Starkey similarly evangelical (but not protestant) religious views, which may account for the marked turn towards religion in the last part of the &#145;Dialogue&#146;.<br>
<br>Starkey must have continued in Pole's household, given his close friendship with many of its inmates. These included Henry Cole and George Lily, the second of whom, while rejecting Starkey's advice to study civil law nevertheless demonstrated for Starkey that he thought ancient Rome the perfect model for England. He also knew Richard Morison, who was on the fringes of Pole's circle. Morison repeatedly begged Starkey for patronage after Starkey's return to England, and Starkey acted as intermediary for Morison to his own patron, Henry's chief minister, Thomas Cromwell. Starkey was especially close to Pole's butler Bernardino Sandro, copyist of many Greek manuscripts including a large number belonging to Pole, and to whom Starkey entrusted his books when he left Venice, and the unofficial English ambassador to Venice, Edmund Harvel.<h2>
<a name="ReturntoEnglandtheviamedia"></a>Return to England; the via media</h2>Although lacking a patron in England, Starkey returned home in late 1534. Pole evidently recommended him to his mother, the countess of Salisbury, and her eldest son, Henry Pole, Lord Montague, in whose house in Dowgate, London, Starkey lived for a time. In early 1535 he caught Cromwell's eye, and became a royal familiar, in an unknown capacity. A royal chaplaincy may have come about the same time. Cromwell used Starkey in two capacities: he handled intelligence from Italy, for which he constantly badgered his correspondents; and he wrote propaganda for use in England. Starkey's most important assignment in the first role was a lengthy correspondence with Pole beginning in February 1535 in the course of which Starkey tried to get Pole to give his opinion of Henry's divorce and the supreme headship. In the second role, Starkey began with a failure when he could not persuade the Carthusian Richard Reynolds to cease his opposition to the royal supremacy. Starkey made good use of ideas he had developed in the &#145;Dialogue&#146; in both cases. Cromwell was well enough satisfied to ask Starkey to describe for him &#145;What is policy after the sentence [opinion] of Aristotle&#146;. Starkey converted this task into a rhetorical exercise, making &#145;What is policy&#146; into an oration intended for popular consumption. The speech was constructed around the body politic and Aristotle's mixed constitution, but Starkey wisely omitted the dangerous implications he had drawn from them in the &#145;Dialogue&#146;.<br>
<br>Throughout late 1535 and early 1536 Starkey's career flourished. He succeeded in inducing Pole to begin writing his <span class="italic">Pro ecclesiasticae unitatis defensione</span> (<span class="italic">De unitate</span>; &#145;Defence of the unity of the church&#146;), although it turned out to be scarcely what Henry or Cromwell wanted, and he continued to write himself. He began <span class="italic">An Exhortation to the People Instructing them to Unity and Obedience</span> (1536) in summer 1535, without a commission. Cromwell, eager to quiet the discontent following on the executions of John Fisher and Thomas More, soon took an interest. The work argued a religious case for civil obedience drawn from the apostle Paul. Starkey grounded his point in the concept of <i>adiaphora</i>, things indifferent or morally neutral, and claimed that the prince therefore had the right to command them without inspiring opposition from his subjects. Following Cromwell's lead, Starkey deployed the fundamental Aristotelian concept of the mean, arguing that England had set out to strike just such a balance intermediate between the pope's Catholicism and more radical protestantism. Starkey, no more than Cromwell, did not worry much about doctrine, contenting himself with arguing on the most disputed question the Coletian conclusion that both faith and works were necessary, and suggesting, in a rather Erasmian turn, that the most succinct formulation of faith was best. For Starkey, this was the Nicene creed. Not by coincidence, this statement derived from the Council of Nicaea in which the emperor Constantine, one of Henry's favourite ancient precursors, had taken a leading role. This precedent naturally evolved into an extended attack on papal primacy during which Starkey argued that most of the pope's power should be shifted to secular rulers and, echoing the preamble to the <span class="roman">Act in Restraint of Appeals</span>, to &#145;a whole congregation and perfect &hellip; our nation&#146;.<br>
<br>Starkey's development of the <i>via media</i> in the <span class="italic">Exhortation</span> has been taken as one of the fundamental documents of this peculiarly Anglican concept, yet the idea was in wide circulation before 1535, and most of the incentive to build it into the work came from Cromwell. The reception of the <span class="italic">Exhortation</span> underscores its long-term lack of importance. The Elizabethans never mentioned it, nor did their late Stuart and Georgian successors, who gave a great deal of attention to the <i>via media</i>. Even in the short term, <span class="italic">An Exhortation</span> was overshadowed by Morison's pithier (and shorter) propaganda aimed at the Pilgrimage of Grace. Starkey's efforts to write propaganda against the pilgrims amounted only to a three-page draft, perhaps because of latent sympathy with them.<h2>
<a name="Realigningtotheright"></a>Realigning to the right</h2>Shortly after the publication of <span class="italic">An Exhortation</span>, the manuscript of Pole's <span class="italic">De unitate</span> arrived in England. Its violent attacks on Henry caused Starkey difficulties, but Cromwell accepted Pole's suggestion that Starkey be included in a committee to read the work. Henry suspected Starkey of having prevaricated about his knowledge of Pole's thinking, and Cromwell accused him of both duplicity and seditious preaching. Nevertheless, Starkey still hoped to put some of his plans into effect, and drafted a long letter to the king about the opportunities open to him in the wake of Anne Boleyn's disgrace, especially how he might use the proceeds of the dissolution of the monasteries, and perhaps about now dusted off the &#145;Dialogue&#146; for Henry. But just to be safe, Starkey had then withdrawn to his benefice of warden of St Mary's chantry (held since 13 May 1531) in Bosham, Sussex. Henry restored Starkey to his good graces faster than Cromwell did, if indeed that ever happened. In December 1536 the king gave him the mastership of the important collegiate church of St Laurence Pountney in London, not far from Dowgate; the patron could have been the marquess of Exeter, although the wealthy London alderman Paul Withypoll probably had more to do with the appointment.<br>
<br>His standing with Cromwell largely destroyed, Starkey turned his writing in other directions and went back to Latin instead of the vernacular. He planned two massive projects in the last biennium of his life, although neither got past the stage of notes. Both seem intended to steer a personal <i>via media</i>. The first, a florilegium from the <span class="roman">Old Testament</span>, may have been collected in preparation for an opening to Pole, perhaps even a defence of him. It is in keeping with the tone of Starkey's final conciliatory letter to Pole of 16 January 1537. Henry did not get off so lightly. The work contains various criticisms of royal policy, most of them resting on the exegetical principle that what the prophets had said about kings still applied, a dangerous echo of one of Pole's basic strategies in <span class="italic">De unitate</span>. For example, Starkey wrote that &#145;God admonished kings [through] prophets, but they did not hear, whence they perished. Manasseh sinned and shed much innocent blood&#146;  (Mayer, 256). Ezekiel had promised &#145;punishment for those who kill citizens without mercy&#146;, which must be an at least implicit response to the recent executions of Fisher and More. One of the most explicit morals was drawn from King David who &#145;fell into sedition and hatred and infinite evils on account of one sin&#146;, adultery  (ibid., 257). The parallel to Henry could hardly be clearer. Starkey, moving ever closer to the conservatives, insisted that &#145;the status of the commonweal must not be changed on account of errors and abuses&#146;  (ibid., 250). In a marked parallel to Pole's work, Starkey went out of his way to draw from Pole's favourite prophet <span class="roman">Ezekiel</span> the maxim that bad princes were a divine punishment; but unlike Pole, Starkey left no remedy against them, not even the nobility of the &#145;Dialogue&#146;. The only recourse was penance, as it had been for David, the same point Pole had reached. The most important purpose of these notes, however, was to record the completion of Starkey's turn to a spiritual religion and profound faith in divine providence, once again the same point that Pole reached at the same time. The colophon, dated 14 October 1537, flatly rejected Starkey's earlier interest in natural science. He did not therefore give up his Coletian criticism of the clergy nor his allegiance to conciliarism, neither in the <span class="roman">Old Testament</span> sketch, nor more importantly in another outline for a refutation of Albert Pighe's <span class="italic">Hierarchiae ecclesiasticae assertio</span> (&#145;Assertion of the ecclesiastical hierarchy&#146;) (1538). Pighe worried the English because he had made Henry and his divorce a special target, and the <span class="italic">Assertio</span> particularly alarmed Starkey because of its full-scale assault on conciliarism. His notes are also significant since Pighe said a great deal about Marsilio, and Starkey largely ignored it.<h2>
<a name="Crisisanddeath"></a>Crisis and death</h2>Starkey preserved a semblance of a public career as well. In March 1537 the king ordered him to confer with the bishops about some of the articles to be included in the <span class="roman">Bishops' Book</span>. In January 1538 he served on a commission investigating a case of witchcraft, before preaching for the king in March. Probably shortly thereafter Starkey left London and went to North Petherton, Somerset. His motive was almost certainly prudential. As emerged from the investigation of the so-called Courtenay conspiracy, Starkey was deeply involved in leaking information about moves against Pole to his brothers Henry and Sir Geoffrey Pole. The investigators focused on Starkey in their second and third interrogations of Sir Geoffrey. They learned that he had passed on the official response to <span class="italic">De unitate</span> and the warning that only the king could prevent Cromwell's vengeance on the Pole family. It also emerged that Starkey's servant had carried letters from abroad for the exile John Helyar, who would be attainted in the same act as the Courtenay conspirators. Starkey's name was singled out in the margin of the transcript in the same fashion as were those of all the others later indicted. Somehow he escaped. He died on 25 August 1538, perhaps of plague, naming his servant Robert Sigbroke and Wotton, who also received all of Starkey's books, as his executors. His largest bequest, &pound;40, went to his father in repayment for his education. He requested burial in the chancel of St Mary's, North Petherton, where a small brass of a cleric may be his memorial. Perhaps because of uncertainties arising out of the Courtenay conspiracy investigations, his will did not pass through probate until 1544.<br>
