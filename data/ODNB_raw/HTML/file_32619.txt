<span class="headword">Crawford,  Osbert Guy Stanhope</span>  (1886&#150;1957), <span class="occ">archaeologist</span>, was born on 28 October 1886 at Breech Candy, Bombay, where his father, Charles Edward Gordon Crawford, was an Indian civil servant; he was later a judge at Ratnagiri. His mother, Alice Luscombe Mackenzie, died a few days after his birth, and his father in 1894. He was brought up by two of his father's unmarried sisters, first in London, then in Hampshire, near Newbury. He went to school at Park House, Reading, then Marlborough College, which he considered an internment, on one occasion running away. Despite this, it was his membership of the Marlborough natural history society and its archaeological section which first encouraged his interest in the countryside and its antiquities.<br>
<br>Crawford went up to Keble College, Oxford, where he obtained a third class in honour moderations (1907), began reading for <i>literae humaniores</i>, but changed to the diploma in geography. By this time his interest in archaeology was developing strongly, and his change of course owed something to the influence of H. J. E. Peake, whom Crawford first met in the autumn of 1908. &#145;Going from Greats to Geography&#146;, he wrote, &#145;was like leaving the parlour for the basement; one lost caste but one did see life&#146;  (Crawford, 44). He rowed for his college and was captain of boats in his last year. He graduated in 1910 and was offered by A. J. Herbertson the post of junior demonstrator in the school of geography which he held until the end of 1911. At Oxford, J. L. Myres, R. R. Marett, Arthur Evans, and Herbertson were the main formative influences; outside, Peake and J. P. Williams-Freeman, whose &#145;solid commonsense and scientific outlook&#146; Crawford greatly valued  (ibid., 64).<br>
<br>In 1913 Crawford set out on a three-year expedition to Easter Island led by Mr and Mrs Scoresby Routledge, but quarrelled with them and left the ship at St Vincent. In the same year he joined the excavation staff of Henry Wellcome in Sudan, working at Jebel Moya and Abu Geili. Crawford always retained an interest in Sudan, and particularly the Fungs, publishing in 1951 <span class="italic">The Fung Kingdom of Sennar</span>. In 1914 he excavated (with E. A. Hooton) an unchambered long barrow on Wexcombe Down, and was digging when the First World War broke out. He enlisted in the London Scottish, went to France in November 1914, and transferred in 1915 to the survey division of the Third Army, serving as a photographer. In 1917 he joined the Royal Flying Corps as an observer and was shot down and captured in February 1918. He was a prisoner of war at Holzminden, from which, as at Marlborough, he tried to escape, though he later claimed to have been happier at the former than the latter.<br>
<br>After the war a period of uncertainty and odd jobs followed, which ended in October 1920 when Sir Charles (Arden-) Close appointed Crawford the first holder of the post of archaeology officer in the Ordnance Survey. It was a role for which he was pre-eminently suited, and which he held until his retirement in 1946. His job was to revise and compile the Ordnance Survey maps from the point of view of archaeological information; but in addition to this work on the standard topographical maps he started a special survey of megalithic monuments, and initiated a series of period maps beginning with the <span class="italic">Map of Roman Britain</span> (1924). His megalithic surveys led him to write <span class="italic">The Long Barrows of the Cotswolds</span> (1925). One of his many ideas was to publish geographical memoirs for the Ordnance Survey sheets, but this did not get beyond the first memoir: <span class="italic">The Andover District</span> (1922), which he wrote himself.<br>
<br>In and out of his professional occupation and throughout his life Crawford was a field archaeologist <i>par excellence</i> in the sense defined by Williams-Freeman in his <span class="italic">Field Archaeology as Illustrated by Hampshire</span> (1915): his prime interest was the face of the countryside in its archaeological aspects. He summarized his ideas on this subject in <span class="italic">Field Archaeology</span> (1932) and <span class="italic">Archaeology in the Field</span> (1953). A keen and very gifted photographer, he had taken panorama photographs during the war, and soon realized the value of air photography to archaeologists and historians. He gave an important lecture on this &#145;powerful new technique of discovery&#146;  (Crawford, 168) at the Royal Geographical Society in March 1922, illustrating his talk with a batch of aerial photographs taken mostly of Celtic field systems in Hampshire. The lecture helped to establish his reputation as an archaeologist and as a pioneer in the development of the civilian use of aerial photography, and he went on to write <span class="italic">Air Survey and Archaeology</span> (1924), <span class="italic">Air Photography for Archaeologists</span> (1929), and, with Alexander Keiller, <span class="italic">Wessex from the Air</span> (1928).<br>
<br>Crawford was particularly anxious to interest others in the remote past and archaeological remains of humankind, and to relate these studies to the whole general study of human existence. <span class="italic">Man and his Past</span> (1921), which he began writing during the war, sets out his credo in these matters. In 1927 he founded <span class="italic">Antiquity: A Quarterly Review of Archaeology</span> which he edited for thirty years until his death. It was, and remained, the only independent archaeological journal in the world. In <span class="italic">Antiquity</span> he was able to publish many aerial photographs, articles on archaeology from all parts of the world, and examples of modern folk culture and the culture of modern primitive peoples to illumine the mute documents of the past. A man of strong character, likes and dislikes, prejudices and enthusiasms, he found in the editorial columns of his journal a place to vent his views, to the delight and fury of a wide circle of readers.<br>
<br>Crawford was elected FBA in 1947 and appointed CBE in 1950; he received the Victoria medal of the Royal Geographical Society in 1940 and honorary degrees from Cambridge (1952) and Southampton (1955). He was president of the Prehistoric Society in 1938, and a member of the Royal Commission on Historical Monuments (England) from 1939 to 1946. His last two books&#151;<span class="italic">Castles and Churches in the Middle Nile Region</span> (1953) and <span class="italic">The Eye Goddess</span> (1957)&#151;reflect the width of his interests as an enthusiastic and untiring traveller. In 1951 he was presented with a Festschrift edited by W. F. Grimes, <span class="italic">Aspects of Archaeology in Britain and Beyond</span>, which included an account of his career by his former teacher, Sir John Myres, entitled &#145;The man and his past&#146;. The foreword to this volume begins: &#145;No single scholar has done more than O. G. S. Crawford to place the study of the remoter past, and of the past of Britain in particular, on the secure and sound basis upon which it now rests&#146;  (Grimes, iii). Crawford was one of the handful of British archaeologists&#151;Sir Cyril Fox, Sir Mortimer Wheeler, Sir Thomas Kendrick&#151;who revolutionized and revivified British archaeology in the decade after 1918. Wheeler wrote of him: &#145;He was our greatest archaeological publicist, he taught the world about scholarship, and scholars about one another&#146;  (<span class="italic">Antiquity</span>, March 1958, 4).<br>
<br>In 1955 Crawford published <span class="italic">Said and Done</span>, a vivacious and amusing autobiography in which his character comes clearly through. A bachelor, he lived with a housekeeper and his cats at Nursling, Hampshire; one of his last acts was to give a broadcast entitled &#145;The language of cats&#146;. He died at his home, Hope Villa, Nursling, in his sleep on the night of 28&#150;9 November 1957 and was buried at Nursling. Crawford did not suffer fools gladly but had a great capacity for friendship, a genuine delight in encouraging and helping young archaeologists, and an infectious enthusiasm for anyone who shared his interest in aerial photographs and field archaeology, or his belief that archaeology, properly studied as a branch of world history and anthropology, was one of the most important subjects. To old and young alike, friends and foes, he was known as Ogs or Uncle Ogs.<br>
