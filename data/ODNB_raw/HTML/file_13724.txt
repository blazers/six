<span class="headword">Hope,  James</span>  (1801&#150;1841), <span class="occ">physician and cardiologist</span>, was born at Stockport, Cheshire, on 23 February 1801, son of Thomas and Ann Hope. His father was a wealthy merchant and manufacturer. After attending Macclesfield grammar school from 1815 to 1818 Hope entered Edinburgh University in 1820, received his medical degree in 1825, and immediately spent some months at St Bartholomew's Hospital in London, whence he obtained a year later the diploma of the Royal College of Surgeons. This was followed by a year at La Charit&eacute; in Paris as a clinical clerk of M. Chomel. He subsequently spent another year on a medical tour of the continent, visiting Switzerland, Germany, Italy, and the Netherlands. Having returned to England in 1828 he rapidly established himself in practice in the fashionable part of London, at 13 Lower Seymour Street, Portman Square. At the same time he continued his studies as a pupil at St George's Hospital and passed with ease the Royal College of Physicians examinations as a licentiate. Having learned of the value of La&euml;nnec's discovery of auscultation while in Paris, Hope championed its use from his very first days in practice. His acute hearing and aptitude for discerning the nuances of musical tones and rhythms worked to his advantage in the new art of auscultation.<br>
<br>Hope's interests encompassed the exciting and rapidly developing elements of physical diagnosis, clinicopathological correlations, and a pathophysiological approach to clinical diagnosis. What La&euml;nnec did for the clinical diagnosis of pulmonary disease, Hope did for diseases of the heart and aorta.<br>
<br>Hope's doctoral thesis, &#145;Aneurism of the aorta&#146;, contained illustrations and descriptions rivalling those of Scarpa in scope and accuracy of anatomical details. While engaged as house physician and house surgeon to the Royal Infirmary, Edinburgh, he completed in 1829 four papers on aneurisms of the aorta for publication in the <span class="italic">London Medical Gazette</span>, based on his personal observations. The same journal published a year later four more papers dealing chiefly with the sounds of the heart and their physiological basis. On 10 March 1831 he married Anne (1809&#150;1887) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13714/', "Hope, Anne")</script>], the well-educated daughter of John Williamson Fulton, a prosperous merchant then of Harley Street, London, and his wife, Anne, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Robertson.<br>
<br>Meanwhile Hope was busy with his own private dispensary. He also discharged his duties as physician to the Marylebone Infirmary where, from 1831, he was in charge of ninety beds, and gave lectures in his home, at St George's Hospital, where he was assistant physician from 1834, and at the Aldersgate Street school of medicine. Despite this heavy load, which eventually took a toll on his health, he managed to publish during 1833 and the following year his <span class="italic">Principles and Illustrations of Morbid Anatomy</span>. It is ironic that this great physician, who described so well so many anatomical abnormalities, had a marked aversion to dissection, but through unremitting discipline made dissection part of his daily routine.<br>
<br>Hope was the first accurately to time the first and second heart sounds. His report that the second sound was related to the closure of the aortic and pulmonic valves antedated phonocardiographic and electrocardiographic evidence. Hope's continuing investigations into the cause of heart sounds involved vivisection, which led to a controversy in 1835 with C. J. B. Williams. Four years later this controversy erupted into opposition, albeit briefly, on the part of Williams towards the appointment of Hope as full physician at St George's Hospital. From this time on Hope's health declined dramatically owing to consumption, until he was unable finally to fulfil his duties.<br>
<br>Hope was well aware of the different physiological pathways for the development of myocardial dilatation or hypertrophy. He agreed with his contemporaries that a stenosed valve caused thickening of the muscle because of the increased force needed to drive the blood through the constricted orifice, while a valve that leaked during diastole brought about a softening of the muscle wall due to volume overload and the wall's stretching, with a resultant dilatation of the chamber. However, he was unaware that a common cause of hypertrophy was systemic hypertension. He introduced semantic confusion with the term &#145;myosclerosis&#146;. Acknowledging it as another cause of myocardial enlargement, he failed to delineate precisely what the term meant or what its aetiology was.<br>
<br>Hope's most important contribution was probably his tome on cardiovascular physiology and clinicopathological correlations. Published initially in 1832 it was entitled <span class="italic">A treatise on the diseases of the heart and great vessels, comprising a new view of the heart's action</span>. It was widely acclaimed and went through three editions during his lifetime. A fourth edition was published eight years after his death in a much reduced form and without the highly valued plates of the previous editions. The treatise was based on a thousand cases, and is a good example of how systematic clinical observation can be used to further the understanding of pathophysiology. Of note was the detailed information on acute pericarditis and inflammatory pericardial effusion and the association of both with rheumatic fever. He also emphasized that mitral stenosis was often associated with an irregular pulse. The text described in detail the volume and contour of the arterial pulse in the presence of other valvular lesions, and outlined the quantitative relationship between the aortic and mitral lesions and pulse volume. Corrigan's classic account of the rapid pulse of aortic insufficiency was anticipated by Hope. He was also the first to note the early diastolic pulmonary murmur heard in association with pulmonary hypertension, later called the Graham&#150;Steell murmur. At one time this murmur carried the eponym of Hope. He antedated apex cardiography with his excellent descriptions of precordial movements in the presence of aortic aneurism as well as in a number of cardiac abnormalities. Hope also described the employment of the fingers as a pleximeter in percussion of the chest, considering it superior to all other methods; his method is still in use today. Finally, the treatise contained a clear presentation of the materia medica favoured in the treatment of heart disease at the time. However, he followed the blood-letting practice of the age.<br>
<br>Hope was elected FRS in 1832; he was also a fellow of the Royal College of Physicians and a corresponding member of several foreign societies. His non-cardiological publications included <span class="italic">Inflammation of the Brain</span>, which appeared in Tweedie's <span class="roman">Library of Medicine</span>, and <span class="italic">Notes on the Treatment of Chronic Pleurisy</span>, which he finished just four days before his death, on 13 May 1841 at Clare House, Hampstead, from pulmonary tuberculosis. He was buried at Highgate cemetery. His widow wrote a memoir that went through four editions. Sir Theodore Cracraft Hope (1831&#150;1915) was their only surviving child.<br>
