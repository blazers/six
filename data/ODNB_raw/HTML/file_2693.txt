<span class="headword">Blount,  Richard</span>  (<em>c.</em>1565&#150;1638), <span class="occ">Jesuit</span>, probably the son of William Blount and Frances Blount (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Love or Pope), was the younger brother of Sir Thomas Pope Blount, of Osbaston, Leicestershire, and Tittenhanger, Hertfordshire, and grandson of Walter, son of John Blount, of Blunt's Hall, Staffordshire. Born in Osbaston, Leicestershire, Blount matriculated at Balliol College, Oxford, in 1581. Awarded a BA on 29 November 1582, he was ejected shortly thereafter apparently for religious reasons. His aunt Elizabeth, Lady Paulet, granted Blount a fellowship at Trinity College, Oxford, founded by her late husband, Sir Thomas Pope. He held it for a few weeks before leaving England for the continent. He arrived at the English College in Rheims on 22 July 1583; by 15 April 1584 he was at the English College in Rome where he was ordained priest on 1 April 1589. In October he was at the recently founded English College in Valladolid, moving to Seville in early 1591. With eleven others Blount left Seville for England on 1 April 1591. To facilitate their return Robert Persons devised a wonderful masquerade. Appropriately dressed, they were presented as English sailors captured during the earl of Essex's expedition against Spain and now duly released. William, Lord Howard of Effingham, lord admiral, examined Blount upon his arrival: after two or three days of examination he was rewarded and released. He was placed at Scotney Castle, Sussex, home of the Darell family.<br>
<br>Blount entered the Jesuits in England in September of 1596. He was a Jesuit novice when he made his celebrated escape from government agents at Scotney Castle in either 1597 or 1598. He completed his noviceship on 7 September 1598. Some time after his escape Blount moved to London. In 1609 he ministered to Thomas Howard, earl of Arundel; his mother, Anne (Dacre) Howard, countess of Arundel; Elizabeth (Hastings) Somerset, countess of Worcester, and her family; Anne (Rivett) Windsor, Lady Windsor; and others. Father Morris cited a report that George Abbot, archbishop of Canterbury, knew Blount's residence but refused to disclose it in memory of their time together in Oxford, and because of the archbishop's respect for Blount's hostess  (Morris, 192&#150;3). Most likely his London base was a house belonging to the Arundels. In London, perhaps at the same residence, he pronounced his final vows on 1 May 1609.<br>
<br>On 17 April 1619 Blount succeeded Michael Walpole as superior of Jesuits in England. Three months later, on 6 July 1619, he was named vice-provincial of the recently established Jesuit vice-province of England that included England, Wales, and English Jesuit foundations in the Spanish Netherlands. England was elevated to full provincial status on 21 January 1623 with Blount as provincial, a position he retained until the summer of 1635.<br>
<br>During his term the province thrived: from 242 members, 138 of whom worked in England and Wales, in 1623, it grew to 359 Jesuits, 188 working in the kingdom, in 1636, with a new mission to Maryland established in 1633 and proposals for new colleges on the continent (Osnabr&uuml;ck). The growth was subsidized by generous benefactions from patrons such as the countess of Arundel; George Talbot, earl of Shrewsbury; Henry Somerset, earl and later marquess of Worcester; William, Lord Petre; and Thomas Sackville, younger son of Thomas Sackville, earl of Dorset, whom Blount reconciled to the Roman church shortly before the earl's death. Blount guided the society through various crises, including a prolonged theological battle with secular clergy over the rights and prerogatives of Richard Smith, bishop of Chalcedon, John Gerard's controversial support for Mary Ward and her revolutionary &#145;English Ladies&#146;, and the dismissal (albeit temporary) from the society of Thomas Poulton because of offensive remarks against Cardinal Richelieu.<br>
<br>Some time after the completion of his term Blount petitioned Charles I that as a Roman Catholic priest he should be imprisoned, and recommended that he be confined at his brother's house at Tittenhanger. It is uncertain whether his request was granted. On Passion Sunday in 1638 he suffered an apoplectic seizure that left him partially paralysed. He died in London on Pentecost, 13 May 1638, and was buried in Queen Henrietta Maria's Catholic chapel at Somerset House. Robert Catesby once said of him: &#145;Here comes Father Blount, who is everybody's favourite, and has no favourites himself&#146;  (Morris, 204). Of many compliments paid to him, at least one is incontestably true: an unsigned evaluation compiled prior to Blount's final profession sang his praises. Among his many gifts, &#145;he is fit for government and for all the duties of the Society&#146;  (Morris, 205).<br>
