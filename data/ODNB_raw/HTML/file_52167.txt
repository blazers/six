<span class="headword">Corbet,  Gabriel</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1427&#150;1454), <span class="occ">merchant</span>, was a Venetian mariner, perhaps originally called Gabriele Corbizzi, who was already established as a trader in Southampton by 1427. In 1431, after petitioning parliament, he was granted letters of denization by the crown, ostensibly because of the service he had done for Henry V and Henry VI upon the seas, but he also paid 40<i>s</i>. into the hanaper for the privilege. He spent the rest of his life in Southampton, and evidently became a modestly successful merchant and respected citizen of the town. Some time before 1440 he married Mabilla, but there is no record of whether she, too, was of Italian birth. They do not appear to have had any children; a Thomas Corbet who was living and trading in Southampton at the same time as Gabriel, but who was probably not a burgess of the town, may possibly have been a brother or a cousin.<br>
<br>Corbet's business as a merchant shows little evidence of specialization in either commodities or markets. In the earliest surviving Southampton port book, that for 1427/8, he appears as mainly concerned with the coastwise trade in wheat, although he also imported some five tuns of wine in a Genoese carrack. His interest in the wine trade continued into the 1430s but he can also be found trading in oil, pepper, kerseys, salt herring, and other fish. On occasion he also acted as pledge for the customs and other dues of some of the Genoese visiting Southampton. His inland customers were spread out over the south of England, from Wells to London, but were most commonly located in Salisbury or Alton.<br>
<br>In 1440 Corbet and his wife were jointly granted by John Fyssmark and his wife, Isabella, a large property called The Cheynes in Coleye Lane in Southampton; this was, in fact, a stone warehouse with cellars beneath, adjacent to the Town Quay on the Southampton waterfront, a good location for a merchant. It was also very near the shop over the Watergate belonging to William Soper (<i>d</i>. 1459), a leading citizen and keeper of the king's ships (1420&#150;42). Corbet himself lived in a house rented from Soper in English Street, not far from the Franciscan church, even though he owned in his own right two small houses further up English Street near St Lawrence's Church. It was perhaps Corbet's association with Soper and his friends and associates, Robert Aylward and Walter Fetplace, that ensured his election to office in the corporation of Southampton. He was first a collector of the subsidy in the parish of the Holy Rood in 1434&#150;5, and later town steward in 1441 and 1442 and water bailiff (collector of the local customs and port dues) in 1443.<br>
<br>Corbet's rise to prosperity in the years around 1440 should probably be associated with the determination of the Southampton merchants at that time to capture the Italian trade at London's expense. And his most important office, that of sheriff, to which he was elected in 1453, when Aylward was mayor, needs to be seen in a similar context. A. A. Ruddock has connected Aylward's mayoralty with a struggle which seems to have gone on in the 1450s within the ruling oligarchy of Southampton merchants, between those who shared the anti-alien feelings then sweeping through merchant circles in London, and those who wished to remain on good terms with the Italian community. Aylward and Fetplace (who was mayor when Corbet was water bailiff) had unusually close connections with the foreign merchants, and would have seen Corbet as a natural supporter of their party in the town.<br>
<br>Corbet was unusual among the Italians living and working in Southampton at this period in taking out letters of denization and becoming involved in the public life of the town. This may have been because in his early life as a mariner he had become involved with Soper in the affairs of the king's ships, and, encouraged by a group of powerful friends in the town, had subsequently taken the decision to settle permanently in England. In the Southampton terrier of 1454 Corbet was recorded as living on English Street, Southampton. It is not known when or where he died.<br>
