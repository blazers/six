<span class="headword">Sargrove,  John Adolph</span>  (1906&#150;1975), <span class="occ">electrical engineer</span>, was born at 25 Delamere Terrace, St Pancras, London, on 23 May 1906, the son of Arpad Szabadi, an electrician, of Hungarian origin, and his wife, Cissie Lily, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Solomons. He was baptized John Adolph Szabadi but changed his name to Sargrove in 1938. Soon after his birth he was taken to Budapest, the home of his parents, and received his early schooling in that city. After returning to London in 1920, he studied at the polytechnic in Regent Street, while undertaking an apprenticeship with several small engineering firms in the London area. In 1930 he was employed by Tungsram Electric Lamps Ltd (later British Tungsram Radio Works Ltd) as a patent researcher. This provided a valuable background for the innovator he was to become, his importance being marked by the large number of British and foreign patents filed under his names. In 1933 he became chief technical engineer of British Tungsram, a post which he held until 1940. During this time he contributed much to the development of new and improved types of thermionic valves. His technical interests, already broadened by experience as a patent researcher, extended into what was later known as electronics with his appointment in 1940 as chief engineer with Electro-Physical Laboratories and with Mervyn Sound and Vision Ltd. He spent the war years (1939&#150;45) mainly with these companies, developing photoelectric devices. Towards the end of this period he began to make contributions in special research on electronic automation equipment for the armaments industry, which led directly to his post-war plans in automatic production equipment for the radio industry.<br>
<br>Sargrove's wide interests in radio, electronic, and production techniques at this time determined his professional involvement, and led him in the technical direction that dominated his later career. The professional interests of most engineers are served by membership of an appropriate organization; Sargrove gained membership of and contributed fully to four of these institutions. In 1939 he became a member (and later a fellow) of the Institute of Radio and Electronic Engineers, to the activities of which he contributed for the rest of his life; from 1965 to 1968 he served on its council, and in 1966 he was elected vice-president. He was also accepted as a member of the Institution of Electrical Engineers in 1942 (he became a fellow in 1949). Finally, he gained membership of both the Institution of Mechanical Engineers and the Institution of Production Engineers. He showed much talent in the technical direction of projects involving electronics allied with automation within a number of specialized companies, several of which he founded himself. This culminated in Electronic Circuit Making Equipment (ECME), which aroused enormous interest in 1946&#150;7 and gained Sargrove the first Clerk-Maxwell premium of the Institution of Radio and Electronic Engineers.<br>
<br>The basic idea of ECME was to eliminate the conventional assembly and wiring of a multitude of individual components mounted on a metal chassis, which was the common method of receiver construction at that time. Instead, Sargrove proposed to make the wiring and components an integral part of a moulded plastic panel, with only the valves, loudspeaker, and electrolytic capacitors inserted as plug-in elements. In this way he was to produce the complete radio receiver in a single production machine with very little assembly-line labour. This brilliant invention, ahead of its time and dogged by political problems, was never taken up generally. It was, however, the first modern approach to automatic operation in electronic manufacture and was acknowledged as &#145;the first automatic factory&#146; by the Stanford Research Institute in a leading article under this title in the magazine <span class="italic">Fortune</span> in 1948.<br>
<br>In 1955 Sargrove moved on to introduce automation into many industries, and founded his own company, Automatic Consultants and Associates, of which he became technical director and, later, chairman. While with this firm he made major contributions to the new and growing field of automation technology and assisted in the work of organizations such as the joint services technical committee, the technical committee of the British Standards Institution, and the United Kingdom Automation Council. Sargrove can justifiably be considered as one of the pioneers of automation in the United Kingdom. He foresaw the immense advantages that the application of electronics would give to machine control and applied his ideas successfully to a number of automatic production processes. Many of his ideas found common acceptance, particularly in the automatic production of electronic equipment, such as computer systems, which became an essential part of twentieth-century technological infrastructure.<br>
<br>Sargrove died of cancer on 9 January 1975, at the Nuffield Home, Shores Road, Woking, Surrey, leaving a widow, Mildred Rose Sargrove. They had made their home at Flat 3, The Leys, Esher Road, Hersham.<br>
