<span class="headword">Manning <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em> de Roux]</span>,  Marie</span>  (1821&#150;1849), <span class="occ">murderer</span>, was born in Geneva, Switzerland, and went into domestic service in England. Among her employers were Lady Palk of Haldon House, Devon, and Lady Blantyre at Stafford House, London. When travelling to Boulogne to join her mistress in 1846, Marie met Patrick O'Connor, a well-off, retired gauger in the London docks and moneylender. On 27 May 1847 she married at St James's Church, Piccadilly, a former railway guard named Frederick George (sometimes given as George Frederick) Manning (<i>d</i>. 1849), who had left the railway service when suspected of involvement in a bullion robbery and who kept the White Hart inn in Taunton. They shortly moved back to London, where Marie continued her close friendship with O'Connor. On 9 August 1849 O'Connor dined with the Mannings at their house, 3 Miniver Place, Bermondsey, where, in accordance with a premeditated plan, the couple murdered him, she with a pistol and he with a crowbar. They buried the body in quicklime in a grave they had prepared under the flagstones of the kitchen. The next day Marie Manning visited O'Connor's lodgings in Greenwood Street, Mile End Road, and stole the certificates of his railway shares (worth about &pound;4000) and &pound;300 in cash, thus realizing the objects of the murder. The body was discovered on 17 August 1849, and soon afterwards the Mannings were arrested. By then she was in Edinburgh (using the name of Smith), where she had gone to make enquiries with a stockbroker about selling the shares. Manning had gone to Jersey where he was very indiscreet, giving his real name and mentioning a former lodger, Massey, a medical student, from whom he had asked for information about various topics related to the projected murder.<br>
<br>The Mannings were tried for the murder at the Old Bailey on 25 and 26 October 1849, where Manning tried to put all the blame on his wife, saying that she had first shot O'Connor before he used the crowbar to finish him off. She made a plea that as a foreigner she was not subject to the jurisdiction of an English court; this was dismissed because of her marriage to a British subject. They pleaded not guilty, Marie appearing in court in a gaudy shawl, mainly blue, and primrose gloves, with a white lace veil on her head. A great deal of evidence was brought forward, including a medical report of bloodstains on her dress. They were both found guilty and Marie became hysterical about her husband's accusations. The Mannings were, however, reputed to have kissed and made up half an hour before their execution by William Calcraft, which took place on the roof of Horsemonger Lane gaol on 13 November. A vast and unruly mob gathered to witness the scene. Charles Dickens, who based the character of Hortense, Lady Dedlock's waiting woman in <span class="italic">Bleak House</span>, on Mrs Manning, wrote a letter to <span class="italic">The Times</span> on the wickedness of permitting such a mob. Mrs Manning wore a black satin dress for the occasion, rendering that material unpopular for many years thereafter.<br>
