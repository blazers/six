<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Wickham,  William Arthur</span>  (1849&#150;1929), <span class="occ">photographer and Church of England clergyman</span>, was born on 3 February 1849 at Trowbridge, the eldest of the five children of William Wickham (1806&#150;1865), grocer, of Trowbridge, and Emma Sophia (1815&#150;1905), daughter of John Rumming, farmer, of Wingfield, Wiltshire. He was educated privately in Trowbridge until shortly after his father's death, and first earned his living as a schoolteacher at Highgate, Middlesex. There followed itinerant work as a tutor. Wickham inherited his parents' religiosity and later recalled his confirmation as his &#145;greatest blessing&#146;. In 1873 he entered Lichfield Theological College, and was ordained deacon in 1874 and priest in 1875. Between 1874 and 1878 he held a curacy in the Staffordshire colliery parish of Talke-o'-th'-Hill.<br>
<br>In 1878 Wickham rejected a good living in the west country in favour of a new district in the parish of Wigan, beginning his ministry as vicar of St Andrew's on 3 November. At that time public worship was conducted in a school&#150;church, the benefice was worth less than &pound;200, and there was no vicarage. It was a poor district on the edge of a large industrial town. Wickham achieved much at St Andrew's. He had a church built and consecrated within four years and cleared the debt by 1886. Parish schools and a vicarage followed. His work grew with the population, including the establishment of a host of parish organizations and a parish magazine. His prohibition of drink (and raffles) at bazaars, among parishioners for whom drink was itself a religion, illustrates his principles. During the coal strike of 1893 he established a soup kitchen to alleviate distress. He aired his views on labour relations and on education (as a vociferous opponent of secular board schools), opposed Welsh disestablishment, and was criticized for high-churchmanship.<br>
<br>Wickham was interested in photography as a young man, and his earliest images date from 1869. During the 1880s he put on public lantern shows, using mainly borrowed slides. In 1891, however, he had the idea of using photographs of his parishioners and their surroundings. At the first of these shows on 5 October it was reported that the local views &#145;were received by the audience with constant rounds of applause as they recognized their friends and neighbours&#146;. This was Wickham's brief period of documentary photography. The most remarkable of these slides (made from dry quarter-plates produced with a bellows camera) were of photographs taken in Wickham's local colliery, Douglas Bank, and &#145;were examined with the greatest interest, being quite unique in the neighbourhood&#146;. He may have got the idea for these from Arthur Sopwith, whom Wickham might have met while at Talke and who had experimented with flash-lit photography in the Staffordshire pits during the 1880s. Wickham's plates of this type convey graphically the cramped, dirty, and arduous conditions faced daily by the miners. The images of working people above ground are epitomized by a series depicting the St Andrew's soup kitchen. Others include colliers squatting, washing, and awaiting their pay, and some vivid individual portraits of domestic and other occupations, such as those of street vendors. The photographs were deposited with the Wigan Archives Service.<br>
<br>Wickham also undertook ecclesiological researches, producing a number of papers, most of them published by the Historic Society of Lancashire and Cheshire between 1907 and 1916. Typical of these is &#145;Some notes on Hindley Chappell&#146; (1910).<br>
<br>On 21 June 1892 Wickham married Clara (1862&#150;1926), daughter of John Henry Peck, oilcloth manufacturer of Wigan, and his wife, Martha, at St Andrew's. They had one son, Bernard (<i>d</i>. 1917), and four daughters&#151;Myrtle, Cicely, Monica, and Caroline&#151;who all survived, unmarried, into their eighties, keen to keep alive the memory of their father's achievements. Wickham was described as having a generous disposition and was self-effacing in his career. He was also said to possess a &#145;domineering will power&#146; and an inability to compromise. His strict teetotalism was well attested, as was his keen and ironical sense of humour.<br>
<br>Failing health and increasing work caused Wickham to leave Wigan in November 1916 for the quiet parish of Ampton, Suffolk, where he remained rector until his death, at the rectory, on 30 May 1929, aged eighty. He was buried on 1 June at Ampton church next to his wife.<br>
<br>In his own time Wickham was known as an industrious clergyman and an ecclesiastical antiquary. His photographic work was not widely known, nor did he ever regard it as other than a hobby and a means to entertain his parishioners and raise funds for the parish. Wickham was no Frank Sutcliffe, certainly, but none the less his lasting significance lies principally in the small but fine legacy of photographic images of working people that his hobby bequeathed, and in his pioneering efforts in underground photography.<br>
