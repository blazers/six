<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Pakenham, Sir  William Christopher</span>  (1861&#150;1933), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, was born in London on 10 July 1861, the second son of Rear-Admiral Thomas Alexander Pakenham (1820&#150;1889), the third son of the second earl of Longford, and his wife, Sophia Frances (<i>d</i>. 1898), the third daughter of Sir Tatton Sykes, fourth baronet, of Sledmere. He entered the training ship HMS <i>Britannia</i> as a naval cadet in 1874 and, having passed out two years later, went to sea in the <i>Monarch</i> in the Mediterranean, being promoted midshipman in 1876. The following year he was transferred to the frigate <i>Raleigh</i>. Together with an able seaman he was highly commended for gallantry in plunging into the sea and rescuing a coxswain who had fallen overboard as the ship was leaving Larnaka, Cyprus, in August 1878. In September 1879 he joined the <i>Alexandra</i>, the flagship of Sir Geoffrey Hornby, and remained in her when Sir F. B. P. Seymour succeeded to the command until he was promoted sub-lieutenant in October 1880. Having undergone the usual gunnery course in the <i>Excellent</i> at Portsmouth he was in December 1882 again appointed to the <i>Alexandra</i> (still the flagship of Lord Alcester); but soon after Lord John Hay had assumed the command he was transferred in April 1883 to the corvette <i>Canada</i>, destined to join the North America squadron. In this ship he was a strict though benevolent autocrat of the gun-room mess in which Prince George (afterwards George V) was serving as midshipman. He was promoted lieutenant in October 1883, and was soon brought home again, having been chosen as flag-lieutenant by Rear-Admiral George Tryon (flag in the <i>Nelson</i>) during the three years (1884&#150;7) of his command of the new Australia station.<br>
<br>Pakenham's remaining nine years as lieutenant were spent mainly as gunnery officer of the small cruisers <i>Calypso</i>, <i>Garnet</i>, and <i>Sybille</i> in the training squadron, and on the Pacific and Mediterranean stations. While in the <i>Calypso</i> he again distinguished himself by a brave attempt to save the life of a petty officer who had fallen into the sea from the foreyard during drill in Kiel harbour.<br>
<br>After being promoted commander in June 1896, Pakenham served for nine months in the old <i>Galatea</i> (a coastguard ship at Hull) and for eighteen months in the <i>Venus</i> under Sir Berkeley Milne in the Mediterranean. He had qualified as an interpreter in French while on half pay in 1884, and was selected for duty in the naval intelligence department from August 1899 until March 1901. He then commanded the sloop <i>Daphne</i> on the China station, and, after being lent to Rear-Admiral Harry Tremenheere Grenfell's flagship <i>Albion</i> as acting captain early in 1902, returned home in June of that year. He was promoted captain in June 1903.<br>
<br>The outbreak of war between Russia and Japan was imminent, and Pakenham's experience in intelligence work and his linguistic abilities (although he never learned the difficult Japanese language) marked him out as the officer to succeed Captain Troubridge, who was due for relief in 1904 as naval attach&eacute; in Japan. War broke out on 6 February 1904 and Pakenham relieved Troubridge in March, taking his place on board the battleship <i>Asahi</i>, in which he remained continuously until after the final Japanese victory at Tsushima on 27 May 1905. His reports to the Admiralty throughout the war were brilliantly written and revealed a thorough appreciation of the strategic, tactical, and technical implications of the events and situations which he described. His cool daring in exposing himself to danger in order more completely to observe the proceedings of the great battle much impressed the Japanese, and led the emperor of Japan, on Admiral Togo's recommendation, to confer on him the second class of the order of the Rising Sun. He was specially appointed CB (military division) soon after the battle.<br>
<br>After returning to England in 1906 Pakenham commanded the cruiser <i>Antrim</i> for two years in the Atlantic Fleet, and then the <i>Glory</i> and the <i>Triumph</i> (a battleship bought from Chile in 1904) in the Mediterranean until January 1910, when he came home to take command of the new battleship <i>Collingwood</i> in the Home Fleet, until December 1911. Winston Churchill, in reconstituting his board soon after taking office as first lord of the Admiralty, selected Pakenham to be fourth sea lord, being impressed by his reputation as an officer of strong character and his unique experience of modern naval warfare. Before Pakenham left the board two years later he had in June 1913 reached flag rank, and in December he took command of the 3rd cruiser squadron of the Home Fleet, with his flag in his old ship <i>Antrim</i>. In March 1915, with his flag in the <i>Australia</i>, he took charge of one of the two battle-cruiser squadrons which belonged to the Australian commonwealth and had been willingly lent for service in the Grand Fleet after the victory of the Falkland Islands (8 December 1914) had disposed of German danger in the Pacific. He thus had the titular appointment of rear-admiral commanding the Australian fleet. In the battle of Jutland (31 May 1916) Pakenham's flag was flown in the <i>New Zealand</i>, the <i>Australia</i> being under repair at Devonport after a collision with the <i>New Zealand</i> in fog on 22 April. His remaining ship, the <i>Indefatigable</i>, was blown up and lost early in the battle. Pakenham distinguished himself by able support of Vice-Admiral Sir David Beatty and was rewarded by appointment as KCB (1916); he was personally decorated with that order and also as KCVO by the king on the occasion of his visit to the fleet at Rosyth in 1917. In November 1916 Beatty became commander-in-chief in succession to Sir John Jellicoe, and on his insistent recommendation Pakenham was appointed to succeed him in the command of the battle-cruiser force (there were many officers with strong claims senior to him but who had seen less service with battle cruisers). He transferred his flag from the <i>Australia</i> to the <i>Lion</i> in January 1917 and retained the command until April 1919, having been promoted acting vice-admiral in June 1917 and been confirmed in that rank in September 1918, and having been present at the surrender of the German fleet in the Forth at the end of the war.<br>
<br>After a well-deserved rest on half pay Pakenham was appointed president of the Royal Naval College, Greenwich, in August 1919, but at his own request was given another command afloat as commander-in-chief of the North America and West Indies station in October 1920. After two and a half years he returned home. He had been promoted admiral in April 1922 and retired at his own request in March 1926. He long maintained correspondence with his Japanese friends and made a great impression at Geneva in 1927 by travelling from England for the sole purpose of calling upon Admiral Viscount Saito, who had been minister of marine in 1905. He was appointed GCB in 1925 and succeeded Sir C. C. Monro as Bath king of arms in 1930. He resigned from this post only a few days before his death, which took place at San Sebastian, Spain, on 28 July 1933. He was unmarried.<br>
<br>Pakenham was appointed KCMG (1919), made chevalier of the L&eacute;gion d'honneur, and given the Croix de Guerre (bronze palms), the first class of the Japanese order of the Rising Sun, the grand cordon of the Chinese order of the Excellent Crop, and the DSM of the United States of America in the post-war award of honours.<br>
<br>Pakenham was a strong-minded, somewhat austere, able, and well-read officer, wholeheartedly devoted to the service. He was also something of a character, with his faultless care of his personal appearance and dress, his quiet sense of caustic humour, and his studiously polite, if somewhat elaborate, manners. Churchill paid him a notable tribute in <span class="italic">The World Crisis</span> (1923).<br>
<br>Numerous stories are told of Pakenham, as that during the battle of Tsushima the casemate on which he was stationed was struck by a shell, with resulting casualties, and his white uniform was splashed with blood. He quietly left the deck and returned in a few minutes with spotless attire and resumed his notes of the battle. It is also related that while in the Grand Fleet he always slept fully dressed as in daytime, and that he had all the furniture of the admiral's quarters burnt, together with all inflammable articles in the ship, including the deck corticine and the companion ladder, in order to minimize the danger of fire during an action; and he kept only a chair in his bridge cabin.<br>
