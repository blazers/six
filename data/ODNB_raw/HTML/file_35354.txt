<span class="headword">Paget, Sir  Bernard Charles Tolver</span>  (1887&#150;1961), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was born on 15 September 1887 at Oxford, the third son and fourth of the six children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35355/', "Francis Paget (1851&#150;1911)")</script>, regius professor of pastoral theology and canon of Christ Church, Oxford, 1885&#150;92, and bishop of Oxford from 1901, and his wife, Helen Beatrice (<i>d</i>. 1900), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5389/', "Richard William Church (1815&#150;1890)")</script>, dean of St Paul's. He was educated at Shrewsbury School, and the Royal Military College, Sandhurst (1905&#150;7), and was commissioned into the Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire light infantry on 13 November 1907.<br>
<br>After a winter with the 2nd battalion at Tidworth, Paget joined the 1st battalion in India in February 1908, and was promoted lieutenant in 1910. He returned to England on leave in 1914, and on the outbreak of war was appointed adjutant of the new 5th (service) battalion, which he helped form, and with which he went to France in May 1915 and remained until November 1915 when he became brigade major 42nd infantry brigade, 14th light division (MC November 1915.) In October 1917 he was employed as a general staff officer, grade 2 (GSO 2), first with the 62nd division, and then on the general headquarters staff of Sir Douglas Haig.<br>
<br>During the German advance in March 1918 Paget was wounded for the third time, severely in the elbow, which rendered his left arm virtually useless for the rest of his life. He had been appointed DSO in January 1918 and was four times mentioned in dispatches.<br>
<br>There followed a series of staff appointments, graduation at the Staff College, Camberley, in 1920, and promotion to major in 1924 and brevet lieutenant-colonel in 1925. In April 1925 he rejoined the 1st battalion of his regiment as a company commander in Cologne; he left in January 1926 to become an instructor at the Staff College, and in January 1929 he became a student at the Imperial Defence College. He was promoted colonel in 1929. Paget's last regimental appointment was commander of the depot at Cowley barracks, Oxford, in 1930, where he instituted many improvements. One achievement then, which he always recalled with pride, was the dedication of the regimental chapel in Christ Church Cathedral, Oxford.<br>
<br>The normal three-year tenure of his command was reduced to two, with Paget's return to India as chief instructor (GSO 1) at the Staff College, Quetta (1932&#150;4); he won distinction for his role following a disastrous earthquake. At the War Office, 1934&#150;6, he commanded the 4th Quetta infantry brigade, was promoted major-general in December 1937, and returned to England to become commandant of the Staff College, Camberley (1938&#150;9).<br>
<br>In November 1939 he took over command of the 18th division, then in East Anglia, from which he was summoned &#145;literally at a moment's notice&#146; in April 1940 to take part in the ill-fated Norwegian campaign. German superiority, both on the ground and in the air, was overwhelming, the ship carrying the British troops' artillery and transport had been sunk, and the prospects were hopeless. When the cabinet, unwilling to face further losses of ships, and unable to provide the reinforcements for which Paget asked, decided on evacuation, he fought a series of skilful rearguard actions, worthy of his distinguished predecessor, Sir John Moore, and succeeded not only in extricating his troops but also in inflicting heavy losses on the enemy. His achievement brought not only the public praise of the prime minister, but also promotion, though he never again had a fighting command.<br>
<br>After Dunkirk, Paget was for a short time chief of staff, home forces (1940), and when a German invasion seemed imminent, would never permit the airing of pessimistic views or contemplate the possibility of defeat.<br>
<br>When south-eastern command was formed in 1941 Paget was appointed general officer commanding-in-chief and promoted lieutenant-general. At the end of 1941 he succeeded Sir Alan Brooke as commander-in-chief, home forces, a command he held until July 1943, when, having been promoted general, he was assigned to form the twenty-first army group of fifteen divisions, in preparation for the Normandy invasion. However, he never commanded in the field the force he trained; the appointment went to General Sir Bernard Montgomery, fresh from his campaigns in north Africa and Italy. Montgomery, who had been at Sandhurst with Paget and become his friend, had a high regard for Paget and praised his training of the force.<br>
<br>Paget was very disappointed but he may go down in history as the greatest trainer of British soldiers since Sir John Moore, teaching them how to overcome the difficulties of attacking against modern firepower&#151;&#145;to bridge&#146;, as he described it, &#145;the gap between the barrage and the bayonet&#146;. To further this he established a school of infantry, with divisional battle schools, in which he aimed at creating &#145;a true offensive spirit, combined with the will-power which will not recognize defeat&#146;, as well as battle inoculation using live ammunition.<br>
<br>Shortly after Paget's death, papers which he had refused to allow to be published disclosed details of operation &#145;skyscraper&#146;, prepared by him in the spring of 1943 as a detailed study of the proposed invasion of north-western Europe. It was described as &#145;a blueprint for the D-day operations of 1944; there were the same beaches, and the same objectives, while the problems of an opposed landing had all been fully assessed &hellip; the first key plan of the invasion&#146;.<br>
<br>In January 1944 Paget became general officer commanding-in-chief Middle East forces in succession to Sir Henry Wilson, where he remained until October 1946, when he retired from the army at his own request. During this command, while no active service was involved, there were many difficulties, and in dealing with these he enhanced his reputation. Again he was successful in a tough assignment, and few could have handled so adroitly such varied problems as the administration of the Polish base and the April 1944 Greek mutiny in Egypt. He was &#145;the only man who really understood the problem&#146;, observed a prominent Greek official afterwards. Paget was appointed CB in 1940, KCB in 1942, and GCB in 1946. In the Second World War he received honours from Greece, Belgium, the United States of America, Czechoslovakia, and Norway&#151;the last the grand cross of the order of St Olaf. He was also an honorary MA (Oxon), Christ Church, Oxford.<br>
<br>Paget married, on 7 February 1918, Winifred Nora (<i>b</i>. 13 Aug 1896), his cousin, daughter of Sir John Rahere Paget, second baronet, and they had two sons, both of whom served with distinction in the Second World War. The younger, Lieutenant Anthony Francis Macleod Paget (<i>b</i>. 5 Nov 1924), Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire light infantry, died on 5 March 1945 of wounds received in a gallant action in the Reichswald, Germany, for which he was awarded a posthumous DSO and recommended for the VC.<br>
<br>Paget's retirement was far from idle. Already colonel commandant of the Reconnaissance Corps and the intelligence corps (1943&#150;52), he became in October 1946 colonel of his regiment (1946&#150;55), which gave him pride and pleasure. He was principal of Ashridge College (1946&#150;9), then devoted to adult education in citizenship, until he became, to his delight, governor of the Royal Hospital, Chelsea (October 1949&#150;1957).<br>
<br>There were other activities as well, all of which reflected his care for the soldier, to whom, despite crippling arthritis, the legacy of his wounds, he devoted his last years. Among these were his work for the Forces Help Society, of which he was national chairman, the Lord Roberts Workshops, and not least the Royal Commonwealth Society for the Blind, his efforts for which raised nearly &pound;400,000. He was also governor of the corps of commissionaires.<br>
<br>Shortly before going into complete retirement, in 1956, he took his last parade, a passing out of national servicemen at Cowley barracks, to whom he paid a moving tribute. Afterwards, to the officers in the mess, he said retirement would mean that, for the first time in his life, he would be living in his own house and have to clean his own shoes; nevertheless, he was looking forward to it.<br>
<br>To those who served with him in the regiment, he was its greatest soldier of the century. To many, especially the junior officers, he was rather a frightening person to meet: &#145;his eyes seemed to bore holes in you&#146; and he made no secret of his dislike of things which he considered to be &#145;sloppy&#146;. Innately shy, and so apparently not entirely at his ease when talking to men, he was a champion of private soldiers, and, if their conditions were not as good as he thought they should be, &#145;the fur flew&#146;. He was reportedly without fear, either physical or moral, deeply religious, selfless, and devoted to his country.<br>
<br>Paget died suddenly at his home, the Old Orchard, Heath Road, Petersfield, Hampshire, on 16 February 1961.<br>
