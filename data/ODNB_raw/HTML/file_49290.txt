<span class="headword">Carr,  Jonathan Thomas</span>  (1845&#150;1915), <span class="occ">property developer</span>, was born in Dublin, the eldest son among the ten children of Jonathan Carr (<i>d</i>. 1881), a wholesale woollen draper of Cumbrian origin with a business in the West End of London, and his Irish wife. The family was liberal in outlook, art loving, and gregarious: one brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/46761/', "Joseph William Comyns Carr (1849&#150;1916)")</script>, became known as an art critic and minor dramatist; another, David Alexander Carr (1847&#150;1920), and a sister, Kate (Hastings), both studied at the Slade School of Art and became painters.<br>
<br>Carr was brought up in Barnes and in Devonshire Street, St Marylebone, before going to Bruce Castle School, Tottenham, and then King's College, London. He attached himself to John Stuart Mill during his Westminster election campaign of 1865 as a &#145;political secretary&#146;; he evidently harboured ambitions in radical politics, but for the time being joined his father's firm.<br>
<br>In 1873 Carr married Agnes Fulton (1849&#150;1902), daughter of the civil engineer Hamilton Henry Fulton (1813&#150;1886), who owned 24 acres close to the new railway station of Turnham Green in suburban west London. This from 1875 became the core of Bedford Park, Carr's first and most successful venture into enlightened property development. Observing that most Victorian estate development was authoritarian in management and gloomy in appearance, Carr harnessed the rising demand for middle-class homes in the suburbs with the fashion for the Queen Anne style in architecture and the aesthetic art-furnishing movement. Bedford Park's layout was not novel, but Carr employed some of the best domestic architects of the day, such as E. W. Godwin, Norman Shaw, and E. J. May, to design the pretty and well-planned houses that line the streets. As well as the customary church, an inn, stores, a club with a library, and even an art school were provided. Minor artists, actors, literati, and liberal emigr&eacute;s from continental Europe flocked to Bedford Park, which was shrewdly puffed in the periodicals. It became admired and lampooned as an aesthetic community, and was satirized in the &#145;Ballad of Bedford Park&#146;, which appeared in the <span class="italic">St James's Gazette</span>. It proved a genuine social and architectural novelty, and the chief middle-class precursor of the later garden suburb. Carr built himself a handsome house to Norman Shaw's designs, Tower House (1878&#150;9), in the centre of the development. He presided over Bedford Park as its sole promoter, though the Carr and Fulton families were much involved in its finances.<br>
<br>In 1881 Carr turned Bedford Park into a limited company and sought new fields of endeavour. The first was Kensington Court, begun in 1882, an effort to shake up London town-house development just as Bedford Park had improved the suburban estate. Special attention was paid to the services: hydraulic lifts were to replace back stairs, and every house was to be electrically lit. He again employed a fashionable architect, J. J. Stevenson, but Kensington Court was never finished to Carr's plans and its fortunes became involved with the larger scheme which caused his downfall. This was Whitehall Court, a huge block of apartments on a prime tract of crown-owned land overlooking the Thames. Carr agreed in November 1883 to take this site, sharing it with the newly founded National Liberal Club, with which he had connections, but the scale of the development was too big for his amateurish methods of finance. In January 1886, with the building hardly begun, Carr and his development company, Whitehall Court Ltd, were saved only by selling out to associates of Jabez Balfour.<br>
<br>Though Carr escaped bankruptcy his indebtedness was severe and his reputation did not recover. Bedford Park Ltd was wound up in 1886, and in the next year he and his fellow directors in Whitehall Court Ltd were found guilty of gross breach of trust for paying themselves salaries when the company had no dividend. He managed to stay on at Tower House until after his wife's death, according to Lucien Oldershaw &#145;with the bailiff as his butler. He and his equally impoverished brother would spend long hours playing cards together and getting highly excited when three shillings changed hands&#146;  (Ward, 25). Carr was called as a witness at the celebrated Jabez Balfour trial in 1895, when irregularities about the Whitehall Court rescue came out. In 1902 Carr tried to promote a fanciful scheme for a second Bedford Park, to be called Burlingwick, on Chiswick meadows, but this came to nothing. He died at 13 Queen Anne's Grove, Bedford Park, on 1 February 1915, following a bout of influenza.<br>
<br>Like many property developers, Carr had a sanguine, genial, and persuasive temperament. He had original ideas, imagination, and courage, but was not averse to cutting corners and attracted a reputation for less than complete probity. He may have intended his career in property as a prelude to one in radical politics. The one known photograph of Carr shows him in middle age, with a piercing eye and a full beard. He is said to have indulged in radical and aesthetic dress, notably red ties and velvet jackets. He had two sons, Horace Fulton Carr (<i>d</i>. 1900) and Jonathan Fulton Carr.<br>
