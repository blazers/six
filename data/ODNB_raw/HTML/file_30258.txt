<span class="headword">Young, Sir  Charles George</span>  (1795&#150;1869), <span class="occ">herald</span>, was born on 6 April 1795 in the parish of St Mary, Lambeth, the eldest of three children, all sons, of Jonathan Young (1762&#150;1826), a member of the Royal College of Surgeons, and his wife, Mary Waring (1778&#150;1845), an illegitimate daughter of Charles Howard, eleventh duke of Norfolk and earl marshal (1746&#150;1815). He was educated at Charterhouse School from 1807 to 1811 and was one of the esquires to Viscount Strangford at his installation as a knight of the Bath 1812. On 23 September 1813 he was appointed Rouge Dragon pursuivant on the nomination of his maternal grandfather, the earl marshal, and he was promoted to the post of York herald on 30 May 1820. He was appointed registrar of the College of Arms on 2 July 1822, an office he resigned upon his appointment on 6 August 1842 as Garter principal king of arms in succession to Sir William Woods. As became the usual custom, he was knighted (27 August) following his appointment.<br>
<br>Young accompanied ten missions to foreign sovereigns with the Order of the Garter, three when York herald as secretary to the missions to Denmark (1822), Portugal (1823), and France (1825), and seven as Garter and joint commissioner to Saxony (1842), Turkey (1856), Portugal (1858), Prussia (1861), Denmark (1865), Belgium (1866), and Austria (1867). He took an active part in the funerals of George III, George IV, and William IV, the coronations of George IV, William IV, and Queen Victoria, and the marriage of the prince of Wales in 1863. As Garter he was responsible under the earl marshal for the public funeral of the duke of Wellington in 1852.<br>
<br>Young, who was elected FSA on 21 March 1822 and was created DCL by the University of Oxford on 28 June 1854, married on 2 August 1854 Frances Susannah (<i>d</i>. 1876), sister of Sir Astley Paston Cooper, second baronet, and widow of Frederick Tyrrell, but had no children. His will (effects under &pound;60,000) was proved by his brother Henry Young, a solicitor, and the latter's son Francis Young, a barrister-at-law who married Sir Charles's stepdaughter.<br>
<br>A distinguished scholar and highly competent man of business, Young rescued the finances of the Society of Antiquaries of London as chairman of its finance committee 1846&#150;52. He had a similarly beneficial influence on the College of Arms as registrar for twenty years and Garter king of arms for twenty-seven years, and as one of the committee responsible for planning and building the new record room completed in 1844. In the gallery of the record room a special press contains most of the 922 volumes of his books and papers, which came to the College of Arms on his death in accordance with a memorandum found among his papers. Many are written in his own hand and the collection includes 250 volumes of peerage claims in which he had an extensive practice, 114 of pedigrees, 87 of will abstracts and lists, and 10 relating to precedence, on which he wrote several pamphlets and &#145;a subject with which no modern writer has dealt with greater scholarship&#146;  (Wagner, <span class="italic">Heralds</span>, 497).<br>
<br>In 1835 the committee of baronets presented two petitions to the king claiming certain privileges. These were referred to the College of Arms, and the report of October 1835 dismissing the claims was signed by Young as registrar and subsequently privately printed by him with a brief introduction. Young's other privately printed pamphlets included <span class="italic">The Order of Precedence with Authorities and Remarks</span> (1851), <span class="italic">Privy Councillors and their Precedence</span> (1860), and <span class="italic">The Lord Lieutenant and High Sheriff and their Precedence</span> (1860); he also had printed for private circulation <span class="italic">The Catalogue of the Arundel Manuscripts in the Library of the College of Arms</span> (1829), which he had employed William Henry Black to prepare.<br>
<br>Young died of apoplexy at his home, 9 Princes Terrace, Hyde Park Gate, London, on 31 August 1869. He had been ill for some months, and had last attended the monthly chapter meeting of the College of Arms on 1 October 1868. He was buried at Kensal Green cemetery on 6 September 1869. Writing in <span class="italic">The Herald and Genealogist</span> John Gough Nichols remarked on the &#145;uniform kindness and alacrity with which the late Garter had for a very long course of years encouraged and effectually aided his genealogical inquiries&#146; and added that he was<blockquote>thoroughly devoted to the best interests of his profession as a branch of our social policy, giving that counsel and advice which on many occasions was required of him by various high Officers of the State in an enlarged and liberal spirit &hellip; Though not himself the author of any great work, he was the constant and never failing promoter of the labours of others. His services to Surtees, to Raine, to Hunter and other topographers were important and continual. More particularly he must ever be remembered as the best friend of Sir Harris Nicolas &hellip; who acknowledges his aid in nearly every preface of his numerous works.</blockquote>
