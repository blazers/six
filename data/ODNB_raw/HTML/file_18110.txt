<span class="headword">Marsh, Sir  Henry</span>, first baronet  (1790&#150;1860), <span class="occ">physician</span>, was born at Loughrea, co. Galway, son of Robert Marsh, rector of Killinane, co. Galway, and Sophia, daughter of William Wolseley, rector of Tullycorbet, co. Monaghan. Marsh's mother was a granddaughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18927/', "Sir Thomas Molyneux")</script>, physician and patriot. His paternal ancestry consisted of a long line of Anglican divines, the most celebrated being Dr Francis Marsh, originally from Gloucestershire, who was archbishop of Dublin from 1682 to 1693. Marsh was educated locally in Loughrea and then entered the University of Dublin as a pensioner in 1807; he graduated BA in 1812 and went on to study for holy orders. However, he came under the influence of the &#145;Walkerites&#146;, a sect named after the Revd John Walker, a fellow of Trinity College, Dublin, and separated from the Anglican communion.<br>
<br>On 9 March 1813 Marsh was indentured to his relative, Philip Crampton (1777&#150;1858), then one of the surgeons at the Meath Hospital, Dublin. In 1818 Marsh received a dissecting wound, which resulted in the amputation of the forefinger of his right hand and the abandonment of surgery as a career. Later in the same year he graduated in medicine from the University of Dublin and obtained the licence of the King and Queen's College of Physicians in Ireland. He spent the next two years studying on the continent, chiefly in Paris.<br>
<br>In 1820 Marsh was appointed assistant physician to Dr Steevens' Hospital, Dublin. In the following year he was one of the founders of the Pitt Street Hospital for Diseases of Children, and in 1824 he helped to establish the Park Street school of medicine, where he lectured on the principles and practice of medicine. In 1828 he was appointed professor of medicine at the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, but he resigned his chair in 1832 because of the demands of his expanding private practice. In 1837 he was appointed physician-in-ordinary to the queen in Ireland, and he was created a baronet on 13 March 1839. He was elected a fellow of the King and Queen's College of Physicians in the following October. He served as president of the college for three sessions: 1841&#150;2, 1845&#150;6, and 1857&#150;8.<br>
<br>Marsh acquired all the trappings of a successful Dublin medical practice&#151;a house in Merrion Square, a seat in the country, and a baronetcy. Contemporaries attributed his success to his determination, energy, and intelligence, rather than to any originality on his part, still less to his contributions to the medical journals of the day. The relative paucity of his publications was a matter of contemporary comment. In 1820 Marsh had married Anne, daughter of Thomas Crowe, Ennis, co. Clare, and widow of William Arthur; their only child, Henry Marsh, was born on 3 April 1821, and she died on 2 November 1846. Marsh was married a second time, on 28 August 1856, to Mary Henrietta, daughter of the Revd Robert Jelly, and widow of Thomas Kemmis, of Shane House, Queen's county (later co. Laois).<br>
<br>Marsh died suddenly at his house in Merrion Square on 1 December 1860 and was buried in Mount Jerome cemetery, Dublin. After his death a memorial fund was launched. It was decided to commission a full-length marble figure by John H. Foley (1818&#150;1874), Ireland's leading nineteenth-century sculptor, and to place it in the main hall of the King and Queen's College of Physicians in Kildare Street, Dublin. The inauguration took place on 9 November 1866. Sir Dominic Corrigan, the chairman of the organizing committee, eulogized Marsh's contribution to medicine and his commitment to the dignity and propriety of the profession. Its members were indebted to Marsh, he said, for his exemplary tact and courtesy, and his humanity and charity. According to Corrigan these qualities were &#145;exhibited in the profession in Dublin to a degree not excelled throughout Europe&#146;.<br>
<br>Marsh's personal estate and effects amounted to &pound;18,520 10<i>s</i>. 7<i>d</i>. His son Henry, then a major in the 3rd regiment of dragoon guards, succeeded to the title, to most of the personal estate, and to property in co. Kilkenny, which had a net annual value of &pound;819 9<i>s</i>. 5<i>d</i>. He died unmarried and without issue on 27 May 1868 and the baronetcy became extinct.<br>
