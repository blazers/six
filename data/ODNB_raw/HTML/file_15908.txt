<span class="headword">Lalor,  Peter Fintan</span>  (1827&#150;1889), <span class="occ">politician in Australia</span>, was born on 5 February 1827 at Tenakill, Queen's county, Ireland, the last of the eleven children of Patrick Lalor (1781&#150;1856), a tenant farmer and MP, and his wife, Anne Dillon (<i>d</i>. 1835). One of his brothers was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15906/', "James Fintan Lalor")</script>. He was baptized on 11 February 1827, and was educated at Raheen primary school. From 1845 onwards the family fortunes worsened with the onset of the great famine. After the discovery of gold in Australia, Lalor sailed for Melbourne in 1852 with his brother Richard (1823&#150;1892), Richard's wife, Margaret, and their sister Margaret and cousin Maria Lalor. From October 1852 to December 1853, together with another Irishman, they operated as Phelan, Lalor &amp; Co., &#145;wine, spirit, and provision merchants&#146;, at the corner of Elizabeth and La Trobe streets in Melbourne. In late December 1853, Lalor travelled to the goldfields at Ballarat, taking with him liquor supplies at wholesale rates costing &pound;804, as well as general store items costing &pound;202. Under cover of a miner's licence, he operated a &#145;sly grog&#146; store. The rest of the family, however, returned to Tenakill. In December 1854 a rebellion by goldminers broke out at Ballarat. By law, diggers had to pay a monthly licence to the government, but at a meeting on 29 November 1854 it was decided not to pay the licence, and many licences were burnt. Known to the insurgents, most of them Irish, through his sly grog dealings, Lalor was elected commander-in-chief of the insurgents at the Eureka stockade, where a stand was taken for &#145;liberty&#146;, and, in particular, equality before the law. The stockaders objected to the acquittal of a former convict, James Bentley, the owner of the biggest hotel on the Ballarat diggings, for the murder of a miner, James Scobie, and sought to substitute a gold tax for the licence system. For Lalor, it was a stand based chiefly on conscience.<br>
<br>Parties of the 12th and 40th regiments, accompanied by police, attacked the miners on 3 December at the Eureka stockade, when twenty-four of the rebels were killed and twelve wounded. 125 were taken prisoner. Lalor was wounded by gunfire, resulting in the amputation of his left arm. Assisted by Father Patrick Smyth, Lalor escaped to Geelong, to his future wife, the schoolteacher Alicia Dunne (<i>d</i>. 1887). He recovered, and they married on 10 July 1855. He was described as being 5 feet 11 inches tall, with blue-grey eyes, and &#145;rather good looking&#146;. A reward of &pound;200 offered for his capture did not result in his arrest.<br>
<br>Representation was later given to the goldfields. On 10 November 1855 Lalor was elected without opposition as member for Ballarat, but he was uneasy on either side of the house. He was, however, appointed inspector of railways. Because he refused to vote for manhood suffrage, at the next election, in 1856, he was returned for the more conservative seat of South Grant, which he represented until 1871 and again from 1875 to 1888. In August 1875 he was appointed commissioner for customs in Graham Berry's first radical administration. As chairman of the Clunes water commission, through his efforts a bill was carried in 1871 for the Clunes waterworks, which cost &pound;70,000. In 1877 Lalor was appointed commissioner for trade and customs, and in 1878 he became postmaster-general as well. In 1880 he was elected speaker of the house, a post which he filled with distinction until September 1887, when he retired in consequence of ill health. He was thereupon awarded a grant of &pound;4000. He died at his home, Goodwood Street, Richmond, Melbourne, on 9 February 1889, having outlived his daughter Anne Lempriere and his wife. He was buried in Melbourne general cemetery. He was survived by his son Joseph P. Lalor, a medical doctor.<br>
