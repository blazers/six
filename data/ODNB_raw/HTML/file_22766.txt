<span class="headword">Price,  Thomas</span> <span class="st"> [Tomos Prys]</span>  (<em>c.</em>1564&#150;1634), <span class="occ">adventurer and Welsh-language poet</span>, was the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22748/', "Dr Ellis Price (c.1505&#150;1594)")</script>, the notorious Red Doctor, and Ellyw Poole. He could trace his lineage to Marchweithan, the head of one of Gwynedd's fifteen tribes. His great-grandfather was Rhys ap Maredudd, who is reputed to have carried Henry Tudor's standard in the battle of Bosworth. Very little is known about Thomas Price's early years, but he is unlikely to have received any formal education.<br>
<br>Despite a lack of firm historical evidence regarding Price's life as a soldier it is possible to conclude a considerable amount from his poems, his <i>cywyddau</i> in particular. In 1585 he was a member of the earl of Leicester's force in the Netherlands. He was also present in Tilbury in 1588 as a member of the army assembled there to oppose the armada. He fought in France, probably during the French civil war in 1585&#150;9, and in Ireland, probably during the nine-year war between 1594 and 1603, when Hugh o'Neill, earl of Tyrone, rebelled against the English. It is difficult to ascertain whether he ventured to Spain, although as a privateer he sailed around the Spanish coast and in one of his most famous poems he describes in macaronic language his trials and tribulations as a privateer. Later in life, following the death of his father, in 1595 he returned to live at Plas Iolyn, in the parish of Ysbyty Ifan, Denbighshire, but his adventurous spirit did not diminish, as he continued to plunder and pillage ships from the Isle of Bardsey.<br>
<br>One of Price's contemporaries and colleagues, William Myddleton, was also a privateer, and it is reputed that Price, William Myddleton, and a gentleman named Thomas Koet were the first to smoke tobacco on the streets of London. Price spent much of his time in London and he composed two memorable poems about the city. None the less his time in London was a period of conflicting emotions. In 1613 he was imprisoned in the Fleet prison for allegedly raping his niece, and in one of his poems he sends the nightingale to Wales from his prison cell, bitterly proclaiming his innocence. Price was also involved in a number of other legal wranglings, and his contempt towards the legal profession is frequently expressed in his works.<br>
<br>Price married twice. His first wife was Margaret, daughter of William Gruffydd of Penrhyn, with whom he had three children. His second marriage was with Jane, daughter of Hugh Gwynne of Berth-ddu, with whom he had five sons and five daughters. His heir, Ellis Price, died suddenly in London in 1610, as did his cousin William Gruffydd, son of Pyrs Gruffydd, his brother-in-law, and one of his closest companions, and Price composed an elegy to lament their untimely deaths.<br>
<br>More than 200 of Price's poems have survived, more than 100 each of <i>cywyddau</i> and <i>englynion</i>, and seven odes. Much of the poetry is conventional, <i>cywyddau gofyn</i>, <i>cywyddau diolch</i>, eulogies, and <i>ymryson</i>, as well as love poems in the style of Dafydd ap Gwilym, which are mainly the products of his early years as their lack of originality and imagination testify.<br>
<br>Price belonged to a group of poets &#145;a ganai ar eu bwyd eu hunain&#146; (&#145;who sang on their own food&#146;). These composed poems for pleasure rather than for a living, as they did not receive any patronage. As a consequence he often treated traditional themes in an unconventional way, and a great use is made of satire and wit, with Price shifting effortlessly between light-heartedness and pensiveness. One notable element of his work is that he is at his best when he sings about his own personal experiences&#151;his experiences in London, on the sea, or when expressing his frustration with lawyers. Before his time the sea did not figure prominently in Welsh literature.<br>
<br>Lewis Morris, among others, was critical of Price's use of English words, stating that &#145;his incorrectness and carelessness in his orthography in writing prose, must be attributed to his military &amp; wandring Life in his younger years&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 14872, 6<i>r</i>). But it is interesting to note that these English words are much more apparent in those poems which deal with his own adventures, rather than in his more traditional poems. His elegies, in particular those to his sons and Pyrs Gruffydd, are some of his best works.<br>
<br>Until recently there has been a tendency to appraise Thomas Price in the context of his predecessors, poets such as Dafydd ap Gwilym or Tudur Aled. But it is difficult to do this as he is such a unique and original poet. At worst he can be mundane and uninspiring, but at best highly original and memorable. He embodies the traditional and the original, frequently singing on the same subjects as his predecessors but treating them in his own innovative way. Indeed he epitomized all of the characteristics of his period and his personality in his poetry. For the first time the spirit of the sea and the bohemian life of London became a central part of Welsh strict-metre poetry. He stands as a bridge between the professional poets and the more informal and personal poetry that followed. He invigorated a system which was in decline, and although he did not exert a significant influence on those who followed him, with his sparkling personality and his individual muse he left his mark on the poetic tradition in Wales. It is noteworthy that he composed a Welsh grammar  (BL, Add. MS 14872, fols. 130<i>v</i>&#150;169<i>v</i>) in which he endeavoured to instruct his fellow gentry in the mysteries of Welsh versecraft. Despite the wealth of his ancestors Price died a comparatively poor man. He had a number of outstanding debts: his legal troubles and extravagance (referred to frequently by Rhys Wyn) were two reasons. Thomas Price died on 22 August 1634 and was buried the following day in the family's traditional burial place, St John's Church, Ysbyty Ifan.<br>
