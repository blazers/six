<span class="headword">Merrick <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>Miller]</span>,  Leonard William</span>  (1864&#150;1939), <span class="occ">writer</span>, was born on 21 February 1864 at 51 Belsize Park, London. His early years are clouded in obscurity, but he seems to have been the only son of William Miller and Esther Davis. His father, a businessman, and his family&#151;of Jewish origin&#151;planned his education in private schools, at Heidelberg University, and in law, but Merrick's father lost money in a business venture, and Merrick left his school, Brighton College, early. At the age of eighteen he was sent to South Africa and to the Kimberley goldfield area, where initially he superintended black labourers; later he worked as a magistrate's clerk, finally entering a Kimberley solicitor's office. A serious attack of camp fever nearly killed him. These experiences form the setting for Merrick's <span class="italic">The Worldlings</span> (1900).<br>
<br>After his return to London in the 1880s, he changed his name by deed poll to Merrick, and for two years toured England as an actor, playing largely in melodramas. Disillusioned with acting, he then turned to writing short stories for a London paper, <span class="italic">Wit and Wisdom</span>. His first novel, <span class="italic">Mr Bazalgette's Agent</span> (1888), although critically and commercially unsuccessful, is remarkable for its use of the selective confessional diary form in the voice of what must be the first female detective. A depressed Merrick went to New York to seek his fortune on the stage with a borrowed &pound;50, but while unemployed there he wrote his second novel, <span class="italic">Violet Moses</span> (1891), which satirically draws upon the Anglo-Jewish background of the St John's Wood and Maida Vale areas of late Victorian London. He returned to London in 1891 to discover that the novel had achieved limited critical recognition. On 1 February 1894, at St Pancras parish church, London, Merrick married Hope Sarah Augusta Butler-Wilkins (<i>d</i>. 1917), of Northampton, the daughter of a dentist and the author of at least two novels, <span class="italic">When a Girl's Engaged</span> (1905) and the posthumously published <span class="italic">Mary-Girl</span> (<i>c</i>.1920). Between 1891 and 1911, when his last novel, <span class="italic">The Position of Peggy Harper</span>, was published, Merrick wrote nine other novels, and many short stories, and he collaborated in the writing of at least ten plays. After 1911 he concentrated his creative energies on writing short stories for high-paying magazines.<br>
<br>Merrick's work is characterized by an obsession with style. Michael Sadleir observes in his <span class="italic">XIX Century Fiction: a Bibliographical Record</span> (1951) that the uniform edition of Merrick's writing published in 1918&#150;19 by Hodder and Stoughton in London<blockquote>represented an attempt by a group of fellow-writers to force on public notice and appreciation a delicate and conscientious artist in fiction, whose merits had never been recognized as they deserved. It is sad to record that the generous undertaking failed of its purpose. Merrick was, remained, and still is an &#145;author's author&#146;. (Sadleir, 1.262&#150;3)</blockquote>Among the writers contributing introductions to the works in this edition were Sir James Barrie (for <span class="italic">Conrad in Search of his Youth</span>, 1903), Sir Arthur Pinero (for <span class="italic">The Position of Peggy Harper</span>), Neil Munro (for <span class="italic">The Worldlings</span>), Maurice Hewlitt (for <span class="italic">Cynthia, a Daughter of the Philistines</span>, 1896), Granville Barker (for <span class="italic">One Man's View</span>, 1897), and G. K. Chesterton (for <span class="italic">The House of Lynch</span>, 1907). Each introduction stressed Merrick's craftsmanship, his use of theatrical setting, his realism, and his concern to expose fraud. A late collection of short stories, <span class="italic">Four Stories</span> (1925), draws skilfully upon the bohemian latin quarter of Paris where Merrick spent some of his last years. He had moved there with his only daughter, Lesley, after the death of his wife in 1917, as he found it cheaper and more comfortable than London. During the late 1920s and 1930s he made several round-the-world cruises with his daughter, who left a vivid photographically illustrated account of them, in her <span class="italic">A Good Time</span> (1936).<br>
<br>H. G. Wells noted in his introduction to Merrick's <span class="italic">The Quaint Companions</span> (1903) that the book<blockquote>is about the tragedy of racial miscegenation. It is, perhaps, the most sympathetic and understanding novel, in its intimate everyday way, about the clash of colour and race prejudice and racial quality that has ever been written in England, and its merits make its limitation of length and scope more regrettable. (Wells, ix)</blockquote>Indeed it is George Orwell in his introduction to a projected 1945 reprint of <span class="italic">The Position of Peggy Harper</span> who summed up the reason why Merrick's work failed to achieve either best-seller status or critical acclaim: his gloomy works primarily focus on artists. Yet Merrick's realism, his concern for the outsider, and his originality of plotting ensure him a permanent place in British literary history.<br>
<br>From all accounts Merrick was shy and diffident, rarely seen at the Savage, his London club. His opposition to hunting seems to have been one of his few firm public stances. His hobbies were, according to his obituary in the <span class="italic">New York Times</span>, &#145;music, reading other persons' novels, and seeing other persons' plays&#146;. In his <span class="italic">Contemporary Portraits</span> Frank Harris described him as &#145;a small, handsome man, slight but wiry and healthy, with melancholy, dark brooding eyes, long and straight nose, and large black moustache&#146;  (Harris, 94). Merrick died in a London nursing home at 3 Courtfield Gardens on 7 August 1939 and was cremated at Golders Green, Middlesex. His daughter edited a posthumous collection of his short stories, <span class="italic">The Leonard Merrick Omnibus</span> (1950).<br>
