<span class="headword">Norman,  Leslie Armande</span>  (1911&#150;1993), <span class="occ">film director and producer</span>, was born at 7A Dunraven Road, Shepherds Bush, London, on 25 February 1911, the son of Jacob Norman, a Jewish chiropodist, and his cockney wife, Evelyn Maria, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Wootton. After education at Cork Street elementary school, south London, until the age of fourteen, he worked at various short-term jobs until, at sixteen, he entered the film industry as a sweeper in the cutting-room at Ealing Studios, which had been sold to General Film Renters. He soon rose to become a film editor, and on 3 January 1931 he married Elizabeth Jessie Crafford (1908&#150;1998), who also worked in the film cutting-rooms, as an assistant film editor. She was the daughter of Harry Crafford, boot and shoe dealer, and had for a time been the girlfriend of Ray Milland. They had two sons, Barry (<i>b</i>. 1933) and Richard (<i>b</i>. 1938), and a daughter, Valerie (<i>b</i>. 1946).<br>
<br>Throughout the 1930s Norman edited films across the decade's characteristic range of genres: there were crime yarns such as <span class="italic">Facing the Music</span> (1933), with Stanley Lupino; a mistaken identity comedy, <span class="italic">I Spy</span> (1933), with Ben Lyon; a Dickens adaptation, <span class="italic">The Old Curiosity Shop</span> (1934), for the veteran director Thomas Bentley; a Max Miller farce, <span class="italic">Everything Happens to Me</span> (1938); and more than his share of Ruritanian or Viennese musical romances, including two with Richard Tauber, <span class="italic">Blossom Time</span> (1934) and <span class="italic">Heart's Desire</span> (1935). He won a high reputation as an editor, mainly for British International Pictures at Elstree and for Warner Brothers at Teddington. In 1939 he co-directed (with Anthony Hankey) a modest thriller, <span class="italic">Too Dangerous to Live</span> (1939).<br>
<br>During the Second World War, Norman became a major with the army's &#145;sonic warfare unit&#146;. His skills as editor and sound editor enabled him to produce recordings of supposed military activity, which were then used to fool the enemy into thinking that British troops were where they were not. The actual army would then attack the deceived foe. After some quite dangerous manoeuvres involving the Japanese in the jungles of Burma, Norman was released from the army at the behest of the head of production at Ealing, Michael Balcon, who needed his skills as editor. Balcon later described him as &#145;one of the best film editors in the business&#146;  (Balcon, 156). The director Harry Watt had made a near-documentary film about a cattle drive across northern Australia (prompted by the threat of Japanese invasion) and Norman was called in to give it narrative shape and drama. The result was Ealing's highly successful <span class="italic">The Overlanders</span> (1946). Norman was also associated with Ealing's next two Australian-set features, as associate producer and editor on <span class="italic">Eureka Stockade</span> (1948), and as associate producer on <span class="italic">Bitter Springs</span> (1950). Neither was as successful as <span class="italic">The Overlanders</span> and Balcon cooled to the idea of an Australian production arm.<br>
<br>By this time Norman had proved himself a very useful addition to the Ealing team. He produced two of its finest films in the early 1950s: the moving drama of the education of a deaf child <span class="italic">Mandy</span> (1952), and the hugely popular war drama <span class="italic">The Cruel Sea</span> (1953), both notable for their avoidance of cheap sentimentality or easy melodrama. (Norman was technically the assistant producer of both: Balcon always took the credit as producer but the associate producer did the real work.) He was back in the Commonwealth&#151;Africa this time&#151;as co-screenwriter and associate producer of <span class="italic">Where No Vultures Fly</span> (1951), the royal command performance film of 1951, and its sequel, <span class="italic">West of Zanzibar</span> (1954). Nevertheless he was slow in getting his first director's credit, and much later, in 1992, he struck an unusually acerbic note about Ealing, about which most recollections had verged on the cosy, in ascribing this delay to Balcon: &#145;I had a council-school education, hadn't been to university and Mick Balcon was a real academic snob&#151;anyone who had a degree <i>must</i> be good, he thought. So that slowed me down&#146;  (McFarlane, 440). When he did get the chance, he made the thriller <span class="italic">The Night My Number Came Up</span> (1955), a brilliantly unsettling account of a nightmare that seems to be coming true. His other Ealing films included Peter Finch's favourite among his films, the Australian-set adventure <span class="italic">The Shiralee</span> (1957), about a swagman's growing affection for the daughter he had previously abandoned, and <span class="italic">Dunkirk</span> (1958), a study in cross-class consensualism, in which the group matters more than the individual. It was a qualified success as a war film but very much a product of the Ealing ethos.<br>
<br>Outside the protective confines of Ealing, Norman had variable success. He made the science-fiction horror film <span class="italic">X the Unknown</span> (1956) for Hammer, which was cashing in on its box-office success with <span class="italic">The Quatermass Xperiment</span>. He filmed Willis Hall's Royal Court stage success <span class="italic">The Long and the Short and the Tall</span> (1960), for which he had wanted its theatre lead, the then unknown Peter O'Toole, rather than the star he got, Laurence Harvey, and had also wanted locations rather than a studio jungle set. He directed Max Bygraves in <span class="italic">Spare the Rod</span> (1961), a mild British variant of <span class="italic">The Blackboard Jungle</span>, and the pop star Adam Faith in <span class="italic">Mix Me a Person</span> (1962), a self-consciously contemporary drama of disturbed youth. He was back in Australia to film Ray Lawler's breakthrough play, <span class="italic">Summer of the Seventeenth Doll</span> (1961), which foundered on eclectic international casting (including John Mills, Anne Baxter, and Ernest Borgnine), with only Vincent Ball and (from the original stage cast) Ethel Gabriel providing authentic indigenous resonances. &#145;That picture broke my heart&#146;, he said in 1992; he knew it wasn't &#145;&#147;Australian&#148; enough&#146;  (McFarlane, 441). As the film was being made for the American company Hecht-Hill-Lancaster Norman would have had difficulty in holding out for what he saw as the play's strongly local qualities.<br>
<br>Norman was replaced shortly after filming began on <span class="italic">The Lost Continent</span> (1968), a Hammer horror adventure, and, disillusioned with trends in cinema in the 1960s, he found a new career in television. He directed episodes of such popular series as <span class="italic">The Saint</span> (eighteen episodes from 1965 to 1968) and <span class="italic">The Persuaders</span> (six episodes in 1971). He was forced to retire for health reasons in 1978, after directing five episodes of <span class="italic">Return of the Saint</span>. He underwent a laryngectomy, and with considerable courage taught himself to speak again. He died of a heart attack at 27 Stevenage Road, Knebworth, Hertfordshire, where he lived, on 18 February 1993. He was survived by his wife, Elizabeth, and their three children, Barry, a popular film critic on BBC TV, Richard, a chartered accountant, and Valerie, script supervisor on several dozen film and television programmes. Few filmmakers of his generation could have boasted a more varied career than Norman, but his name is rightly associated with Ealing Studios, one of the most distinctive production centres in one of the most productive periods of British cinema history.<br>
