<span class="headword">Goldfaden,  Avrom</span>  (1840&#150;1908), <span class="occ">playwright and theatre director</span>, was born in Old Constantine, Ukraine, on 12 July 1840, one of four sons born to Khayim Lipe Goldenfodem, a watchmaker, and his wife, Khane Rivke. Like his brothers, he was apprenticed to his father, but in an effort to take advantage of a new tsarist decree offering the sons of Jewish families an alternative to conscription, he was sent to the rabbinical academy in Zhitomir from 1857 to 1866. By the time he completed his studies he was already a published poet, having submitted verse to the Hebrew literary journal <span class="italic">Hamelits</span> and its Yiddish offshoot, <span class="italic">Kol mevaser</span>. In the mid- to late 1860s he published one volume of Hebrew poems and two collections in Yiddish, which he issued under the more German-sounding surname of Goldfaden, the name by which he became well known to Yiddish-speakers worldwide.<br>
<br>Although Goldfaden continued publishing verse throughout his life, it was primarily as a playwright that he made his name. His second volume of Yiddish writing included a three-act play, <span class="italic">Di mume Sosye</span>, written in the tradition of salon dramas by Jewish intellectuals dating back to the 1790s (indeed, the play in question was essentially an adaptation of Shloyme Etinger's comedy <span class="italic">Serkele</span>, in which Goldfaden had starred in a rabbinical school production). At the time the play was published there was no professional forum for staging Yiddish plays, but Goldfaden soon changed that.<br>
<br>After completing his rabbinical studies Goldfaden married Paulina Verbl, daughter of the writer Eliyohu Verbl, who befriended and influenced his son in-law. Goldfaden drifted from one job to another for nearly a decade, culminating in a short-lived newspaper venture in Bucharest with his friend and former classmate the writer Yitskhok Linetski. At loose ends in Romania, Goldfaden began writing sketches for local performers, an undertaking that soon led to the formation of a professional company that began touring Romania and Russia in 1876. Goldfaden's career as a playwright progressed in several distinct phases, whose form and content were affected by a combination of the socio-political situation of eastern European Jewry and the evolving theatrical conditions of the Yiddish stage. In the first phase, from 1876 to approximately 1880, he wrote primarily light comedies that tended to satirize religious fanaticism and champion the agenda of the Jewish enlightenment, or Haskalah. Best-known among these works are the farces <span class="italic">Shmendrik</span> (1877) and <span class="italic">Di tsvey Kuni Leml</span> (1880) and the comic operetta <span class="italic">Di kishefmakherin</span> (1879).<br>
<br>As the condition of the Jews of the Russian empire rapidly deteriorated in the early 1880s, Goldfaden set aside his agenda of social reform within the Jewish community and turned to building national morale with operettas of the heroic Jewish past. This new outlook bred several of his most successful and popular works, including: <span class="italic">Shulamis</span> (1881), an epic story set in late antiquity and following the fortunes of a shepherdess and the soldier who falls in love with, abandons, and ultimately returns to her; <span class="italic">Doctor Almasada</span> (1881), a tale of persecution and redemption of the Jews in Renaissance Italy; and <span class="italic">Bar Kokhba</span> (1883), based on the true story of a suicidal Jewish uprising against the Roman empire in the second century.<br>
<br>If the legend that the ban imposed on Yiddish theatre in the Russian empire was imposed as a direct response to the production of <span class="italic">Bar Kokhba</span>, then Alexander III and his advisers must be credited with a reasonable degree of acuity as theatre critics. In any case, the ban, which officially remained in place until after the first Russian revolution of 1905, made life impossible for all but the handful of Yiddish troupes who continued to perform in Russia through a combination of stealth, bribery, and cajolery. Goldfaden and his actors were not among them, and for the rest of his life, he never remained in one country for more than a few years at a time. He first proceeded to Poland, where his company performed in Warsaw and later in &#321;&oacute;d&#378;, and then emigrated in 1887 to New York. There he composed his successful biblical dramas <span class="italic">Akeydes Yitskhok</span> (1887) and <span class="italic">Kenig Akhashveyresh</span> (1887), but did not get the welcome he expected from colleagues, and ultimately left for London. He led a troupe at the Princess Club Theatre for several months during 1889, but soon moved to Paris and then on to Lemberg (Lw&oacute;w), his primary city of residence for most of the 1890s.<br>
<br>Goldfaden made a dramatic return to London in 1900 as Paris delegate to the World Zionist Congress. Although his plays had long been ubiquitous on the Yiddish stage&#151;and indeed remained so for decades&#151;Goldfaden and his wife spent most of their final years in dire financial straits, and on his sixtieth birthday a fund was established in London to support the couple. His final years brought continued wandering and declining health, ultimately bringing him to his deathbed as his last play, <span class="italic">Ben Ami</span>, was running in the New York theatres in the closing weeks of 1907. He died in New York a few weeks into the run, on 9 January 1908, survived by his wife. On the following day 100,000 spectators were said to have greeted his funeral procession to Washington cemetery, New York, where he was buried.<br>
