<span class="headword">Statham <span class="st"> [Stathum]</span>,  Nicholas</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1472), <span class="occ">lawyer</span>, was the third son of John Statham (<i>d</i>. 1454) of Morley, Derbyshire. He had become a member of Lincoln's Inn by 1449, serving as pensioner of the inn in 1455&#150;6 and as a governor intermittently from 1456. The Statham mentioned as a member of the inn in 1420 may have been his father. Nicholas Statham was a bencher by 1466, and his only recorded reading, during Lent 1472 (a few months before his death), was probably his second; an undated reading on the <span class="roman">Statute of Marlborough</span>, &#145;secundum Stathum&#146;, is still extant. From 1458 until his death he was a justice of the peace for Derbyshire, and he served twice in parliament (for Old Sarum in 1467&#150;8, and for an unknown constituency in 1470&#150;71). He was admitted to the Mercers' Company in 1468 as a man of court. Although he attained the important post of attorney-general to the duchy of Lancaster, he held it only for one year before his early death in July or August 1472. He had by then already been appointed second baron of the exchequer in reversion, but he died before the reversion fell in. Clearly he was a lawyer of some promise, cut off in his prime. His wife, Anne, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Shelley, and an infant daughter of the same name survived him.<br>
<br>Statham is chiefly remembered for an abridgement of cases printed anonymously in Rouen, for Richard Pynson, about 1490. This book, the first example of a printed abridgement, and the first major enterprise by Pynson, bears no title; but it has been known since early Tudor times as <span class="italic">Statham</span> and there is no other candidate for the attribution. The abridgement is of a type which became common in the 1450s, and contains no material later than 1461. It could have been a book merely owned by Statham; and yet a legal joke from Derbyshire (concerning the miller of Matlock), under the heading &#145;Toll&#146;, might be taken to afford some confirmation of Statham's involvement in its compilation. The abridgement was never reprinted, being soon overtaken by the larger abridgements of Fitzherbert and Brooke. Stow recorded a monument formerly in St James Garlickhythe, where Statham was buried, in London.<br>
