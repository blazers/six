<span class="headword">Damory <span class="st"> [Amory]</span>, Sir  Roger</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1322), <span class="occ">baron and courtier</span>, was the younger son of Sir Robert Damory, of Bucknell and Woodperry, Oxfordshire, Thornborough, Buckinghamshire, and Ubley in Somerset, who died in or before 1285. Although his family was one of well-established county gentry, Damory's position as a younger son probably justified the description of him in the <span class="italic">Vita Edwardi secundi</span> as by origin &#145;a poor and needy knight&#146;  (p. 123). It was initially his elder brother, Sir Richard Damory, who was more prominent. As sheriff of Oxford and Buckingham from 1308 to 1310, forester of Whittlewood Forest in Buckinghamshire from 1308, constable of Oxford Castle from 1311 to 1321, and steward of the royal household from 1311 to 1325, Richard Damory moved from local administration to the centre of power and may have been responsible for introducing Roger to royal service.<br>
<br>Roger Damory first appears in 1309 as the retainer of Gilbert de Clare, eighth earl of Gloucester. It was perhaps as a member of Gloucester's retinue that he fought at Bannockburn in June 1314, where Gloucester was killed; and his performance in the battle, for which he was later rewarded with land worth 100 marks a year, may have brought him to Edward II's notice. From then on his rise was rapid and within three years he had become the supreme influence at Edward's court. The royal grant of the castle and honour of Knaresborough, Yorkshire, in December 1314 was the first favour to come his way. By January 1315 he was a knight of the royal household and in the next two years he received various grants of lands, wardships, and money. Damory's progress was crowned in April 1317 by his marriage to <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5435/', "Elizabeth de Clare (1294/5&#150;1360)")</script>, one of the three sisters and coheirs of the former earl of Gloucester, for which again he had Edward to thank. His wife's share in the partition of the vast Gloucester estates made him one of the leading territorial magnates and led to his being summoned to parliament from November 1317.<br>
<br>From the later months of 1316 Damory became the leading member of a group of royal favourites, two of whom, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7554/', "Hugh Despenser the younger")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37134/', "Hugh Audley")</script>, were also married to Gloucester's sisters. The royal patronage lavished on them, at a time of general distress caused by famine and Scottish attacks, brought them the enmity of Thomas, earl of Lancaster, the greatest of the magnates, who was determined to purge the court and to overturn Edward's indulgent grants. From 1316 to 1319 Lancaster's feud with the courtiers dominated English politics. In October 1317 the earl seized the royal castles of Knaresborough and Alton, Staffordshire, then in Damory's custody, and he was later to accuse Damory of plotting against his life. As the most avaricious of the courtiers Damory was put under restraint in November 1317 by Aymer de Valence, earl of Pembroke, and Bartholomew Badlesmere, both of them moderates among Edward's associates, who imposed on Damory a written undertaking not to profit excessively from the king's generosity nor to permit others to do so. After long negotiations a fragile settlement between Lancaster and the king's friends was reached in August 1318 by the treaty of Leake, where Lancaster and Damory were temporarily reconciled. Damory's promise to pay Lancaster just over &pound;600 may help to account for both this reconciliation and a subsequent review of royal grants which allowed Damory to keep virtually all that he had gained.<br>
<br>Within a few months Damory's position came under threat from a new direction. In 1318&#150;19 the rise of Hugh Despenser the younger gradually displaced Damory from his standing at the centre of the court. Although Edward apparently promised him the captaincy of Berwick in September 1319, during the English siege of the town, and grants continued to come his way during 1320, his allegiance was soon to be severed by the ambitions of Despenser, whose attempts in 1320&#150;21 to enlarge his share of the Gloucester inheritance in south Wales raised the whole march against him. Damory and Audley, the husbands of the other two coheiresses, were vulnerable to Despenser's expansionism and in the early months of 1321 they and the other marchers turned to Lancaster for help. Damory was present at Lancaster's assembly at Sherburn, Yorkshire, in June 1321, when the earl tried to put together a coalition against Despenser and his father. In the brief civil war that followed he took Worcester for the rebels in January 1322, but was captured by the king's forces at Tutbury, Staffordshire, on 11 March. He was tried and condemned to death, but spared because of Edward's former affection for him and because of his marriage to the king's niece. Sick or mortally wounded, he died in Tutbury on 13 or 14 March 1322 and was buried in Ware, Hertfordshire. He left a daughter, Elizabeth, born in May 1318. He had been at the head of the factional politics of Edward II's middle years, and his rapid rise and precipitate fall typified the fate of others who had had the misfortune to enjoy Edward's patronage.<br>
