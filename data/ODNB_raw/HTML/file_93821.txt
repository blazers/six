<span class="headword">Conchobar mac Donnchada</span>  (<em>d.</em> 833), <span class="occ">high-king of Ireland</span>, was a son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/50108/', "Donnchad mac Domnaill, high-king of Ireland (733&#150;797)")</script> and Fuirseach, daughter of Congal of the D&aacute;l nAraidi. His recorded career began in 802, when the high-king &Aacute;ed Oirdnide mac N&eacute;ill of Cen&eacute;l n&Eacute;ogain, the husband of Conchobar's sister Euginis, divided lordship over Clann Cholm&aacute;in of the southern U&iacute; N&eacute;ill between Conchobar and his brother Ailill following the death of their uncle Muiredach. The next year Conchobar attacked and killed Ailill at Rathconnell.<br>
<br>Five years later Conchobar attempted to seize the high-kingship. With his ally Muirgus mac Tommaltaig, the king of Connacht, he camped for three days at the U&iacute; N&eacute;ill ceremonial site of Tailtiu (Teltown), an action that implied overlordship. They fled &#145;like young goats&#146;, according to the annals of Ulster, when &Aacute;ed appeared with his army. In revenge, &Aacute;ed ravaged some of the lands of Conchobar, whose misfortunes continued when his son Cin&aacute;ed was slain during a raid on Iveagh that year.<br>
<br>Conchobar remained formidable, however, and on &Aacute;ed's death in 819 he was recognized as high-king. His main rival was &Aacute;ed's cousin Murchad mac M&aacute;ele D&uacute;in, who led an army to Drimnagh in 820 to challenge the new high-king. Conchobar confronted him, but the clergy prevented battle. So Conchobar retaliated with raids around Armagh the following year. Murchad then made a secret alliance with some of Conchobar's subjects, the S&iacute;l n&Aacute;eda Sl&aacute;ine of Brega. Conchobar reacted forcefully when he discovered the treachery, twice attacking the traitors, with an especially horrific slaughter on 1 November 822.<br>
<br>Conchobar employed the church in his political machinations, as may be seen in the career of his son Artr&iacute;, born of his marriage to Land, daughter of &Aacute;ed Oirdnide. Artr&iacute; belonged to the church at Armagh, and was its sometime head. In 823 he allied with the southern Irish prince Feidlimid mac Crimthainn, king of Munster, to proclaim the &#145;law of St Patrick&#146; over Munster. Artr&iacute; had made the same proclamation in Connacht in 818, and did so again in 825. Armagh was now recognized as the head of the southern Irish churches, and control of it was so important that in 827 Conchobar intervened there on Artr&iacute;'s behalf, when he &#145;dishonoured&#146; a rival named Eogan, the candidate of his old foes the Cen&eacute;l n&Eacute;ogain.<br>
<br>For four years Conchobar was harassed on all sides. The minor clan of Gailenga attempted to hold the fair of Tailtiu in 827 without his permission, and the high-king promptly dispersed the gathering. In southern Ireland Feidlimid began campaigns for supremacy, and to forestall a confrontation Conchobar negotiated a peace with him in 827 at Birr. But any alliance or accommodation had ended by 830, when Feidlimid's subjects killed Conchobar's brother Folloman. The following year Feidlimid raided as far north as Fennor with an army that included troops from Leinster, a province that became a battleground between northern and southern princes. Conchobar responded by plundering the valley of the River Liffey. Adding to the turmoil were disturbances at the fair of Tailtiu, leading to many deaths, and Conchobar's return to Armagh where he imprisoned the retinue of Artr&iacute;'s rival Eogan.<br>
<br>From 831 to his death in 833, however, Conchobar's reign was quiet, partly due to the escalation of viking attacks, especially in the regions of the rivers Boyne and Liffey. Conchobar is buried at Clonard, Meath. He had four known sons: Artr&iacute;, who died in the same month as his father; Cathal (<i>d</i>. 842); Eoch&oacute;can; and Cin&aacute;ed. While his career spanned a turbulent period of Ireland's history, it was considered a success, and is described in <span class="italic">Baile in sc&aacute;il</span> as &#145;showers of prosperity&#146;  (Meyer, 234).<br>
