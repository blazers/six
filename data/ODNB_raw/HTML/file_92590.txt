<span class="headword">Morgan,  Peter Henry Geoffrey</span>  (1919&#150;2003), <span class="occ">motor manufacturer</span>, was born at Chestnut Villa, Worcester Road, Malvern, Worcestershire, on 3 November 1919, the only son (there were four daughters) of Henry Frederick Stanley Morgan (1881&#150;1959) and his wife, (Hilda) Ruth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Day. His father, &#145;HFS&#146;, had been born into a well-to-do ecclesiastical family, but as a child he had developed an interest in engineering, which, with his father's support, led to successful study at Crystal Palace Engineering College, followed by a Great Western Railway engineering apprenticeship. He became an enthusiastic motorist and with a friend set up a &#145;garage and motor works&#146; in Malvern. With the help of the engineering master at Malvern School, William Stephenson-Peach, and facilities he made available, and with commercial engineering assistance H. F. S. Morgan produced his prototype Morgan three-wheeler Runabout car in 1909. The enthusiasm of his friends and the support of his father led to the establishment of the Morgan Motor Co. and the public appearance of the &#145;car for one person&#146; at the 1910 Olympia Motor Cycle Show. So in the decade before Peter Morgan's birth the foundations of a specialist motor manufacturer, operating in a niche market, had been laid. The firm continued into the next century under the control of three successive generations of the Morgan family, producing hand-crafted sports cars of classic appearance, which were joined by the distinctive new Aero 8 in 2000. As the son of the founder, Peter's special contribution was to ensure the company's survival through a variety of adverse circumstances, especially those caused by changing markets and the external economic situation.<br>
<br>Like his father, Peter Morgan had an education that equipped him for a life's work in engineering, at Oundle public school, with its reputation for mechanical subjects, and at Chelsea College of Automobile and Aeronautical Engineering (1937&#150;40). By this time he was already involved with Morgan as a co-driver with his father in trials, and his active participation in motor sport at the wheel of a Morgan resumed in post-war years: given the market to which Morgan appealed, this was a crucial contribution to the company's prosperity. In 1939, while still a student, he married Jane Christie (<i>d</i>. 2003); they had two daughters and a son. After college, a brief spell with the British Ermeto Corporation was followed by wartime military service in the Royal Army Service Corps, eventually in charge of workshops in Nairobi, with the rank of captain. After demobilization he spent a brief period with the United Africa Co. before he joined the family firm in 1947, at a time when the model F three-wheeler was declining in market appeal and the future lay with the Morgan 4/4 (four-wheeled, four cylinder) sports car, which HFS had developed in 1934 from the model F. Peter Morgan's initial position was as draughtsman and development engineer and his early years on the staff coincided with the dwindling of three-wheeler production, to end in 1951&#150;2. The 4/4 model underwent development in the late 1940s, on which Peter Morgan worked, to emerge in 1950 as the more powerful Plus-4, with a Standard Vanguard engine, the prototype being driven by him in the 1950 London&#150;Exeter trial.<br>
<br>Morgan became managing director of the Morgan Motor Co. in 1958 and on the death of his father in 1959 became chairman as well. HFS had left the company to his daughters and to Peter, who was faced with problems with the Inland Revenue on the one hand and some family scepticism about the company's future on the other  (Miller, 97). With gentlemanly determination and a strong commitment to the family firm, which was a constant feature of his life, he carried the business into the next generation. Active involvement of Morgan cars in motor sport continued, highlighted by their win in the 2 litre class at Le Mans in 1962. One major move must, however, be counted a failure: the Plus Four Plus, launched in 1963, was a closed, glass-fibre-bodied version of the Plus 4. It had been developed as the result of an enquiry from Greece for a streamlined body (and had been preceded by individual special-bodied Morgans), but the car's departure from the traditional Morgan, and possibly its higher price, deprived it of a strong market, only some 26 being built  (Bowden, 94). This was at a time when total annual Morgan sales amounted to 434 (in 1964), of which 374 were exported, some 250 to the United States, although this market was to present future problems in the form of safety and emissions regulations.<br>
<br>Undeterred by the relative failure of the Plus Four Plus, the company under Peter Morgan's &#145;steady leadership&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 24 Oct 2003) went on to launch in 1968 the Plus 8, which remained in production at the time of his death. He was particularly proud of his part, together with Maurice Owen, a racing engineer, in the development of this more powerful car, the need for which had arisen when the Triumph engine which had powered the Plus 4 had had to be replaced. Morgan had always bought in engines, the company enjoying a positive relationship with their various suppliers, and for the Plus 8 Morgan successfully negotiated with Peter Wilks of Rover for the supply of the Buick-originated but Rover-manufactured V8 engine.<br>
<br>Morgan came to the attention of a wider public with the BBC television series <span class="italic">Trouble Shooter</span> in 1990, in which the management expert Sir John Harvey-Jones visited a number of companies which in different ways might have been considered to be in need of his analytical and prescriptive skills. In the case of Morgan there seems to have been less than a meeting of minds: implicit in Harvey-Jones's approach was the concept of the standard production line and the consequent increasing of production to remove a waiting list of indeterminate but undoubtedly long duration. The company did not wholly ignore the analysis and prescription, however, as production was increased and productivity improved. On a return visit Harvey-Jones praised what he saw, and a radical new model, the all-aluminium Aero 8, for which a new assembly building had been built, was introduced in 2000.<br>
<br>Morgan's first marriage was dissolved in 1972, and on 23 January 1982 he married Heather Mary Williams, secretary, and daughter of Arthur Williams, shoe repairer. He retired as managing director in 1999 but continued to come into the office until shortly before his death, on 20 October 2003 at Worcestershire Royal Hospital, Worcester, of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and acute renal failure. He was survived by his second wife, Heather, and the three children of his first marriage. His son, Charles (<i>b</i>. 1951), had left a career in television in 1985 to join the company. He was made managing director in 1999 and on his father's death succeeded him as chairman.<br>
