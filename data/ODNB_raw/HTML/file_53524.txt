<span class="headword">Vavasour,  Thomas</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1585), <span class="occ">physician and recusant</span>, was a younger son of Sir Peter Vavasour (<i>d</i>. in or after 1556) of Spaldington, Yorkshire, and Elizabeth Windsor; the family was a cadet branch of the Vavasours of Hazelwood Castle. Thomas Vavasour was educated at St John's College, Cambridge, in the 1530s (BA, 1536; MA, 1538). Elected a fellow of Clare College in 1539, he transferred to Henry VIII's new foundation of Trinity College in 1547, serving first as steward and then as junior bursar. His religious commitment first became apparent in the course of Nicholas Ridley's visitation of the university in June 1549, during which Vavasour was a thorn in the bishop of Rochester's flesh. He was listed second among eight senior fellows of Trinity who were described as a nest of papists, posted a Latin pasquinade against the visitors, and extemporized a marvellous counter to one of Ridley's arguments during the famous public disputation about the eucharist. Ridley advanced a pointed sorites: &#145;what Christ took, that he blessed; what he blessed, that he brake; what he brake, that he gave; ergo, what he received [that is, bread], he gave, etc.&#146; Vavasour immediately cut in:<blockquote>God took a rib out of Adam's side; what he took, he built; what he built, he brought; what he brought, he gave to Adam to be his wife; but he took a rib: ergo, he gave a rib to Adam to wife. (<span class="italic">Acts and Monuments</span>, 6.331)</blockquote>Many years later, Edmund Grindal, then archbishop of York, was to remind William Cecil of the character of this man&#151;they had been contemporaries at St John's in the 1530s. Vavasour was now making trouble for him in York, and Grindal recalled him as &#145;sophistical, disdainful, and eluding arguments with irrision&#146;  (Nicholson, 350).<br>
<br>Soon after the disputation Vavasour left England for Italy. While his later career suggests that his motives may have been as much religious as professional, his avowed purpose&#151;to study medicine&#151;was legitimate enough for him to remain in receipt of his stipend from Trinity. Having graduated MD at Venice in December 1553 he returned to England with Mary Tudor upon the throne and the mass once more upon the altar. He continues to appear in the Trinity College accounts until 1555 (the accounts for 1556&#150;9 are unfortunately lost), but presumably resigned his fellowship by November 1556, when he was licensed for medical practice by the recently founded Royal College of Physicians. By 1561 he was married to Dorothy Kent, and in the 1560s took up residence with his wife in the parish of Holy Trinity Goodramgate, York. Their house stood on Common School Lane, beside Archbishop Holgate's School.<br>
<br>The &#145;alteration of religion&#146; under Queen Elizabeth was coolly received in York, and Thomas Vavasour was from the start a ringleader of Catholic survival and resistance. The arrival of more determined ecclesiastical leadership in the later 1560s, beginning with Matthew Hutton's appointment as dean in 1567, led to a clamp-down on Catholic activities. Vavasour was summoned before the York high commission in 1568, but, as later reported to William Cecil, his influential friends ensured that officials turned a blind eye, and the oft-repeated summons proved impossible to serve. In due course he was excommunicated for contumacy, and no doubt savoured the irony of the penalty. With the outbreak of the rising of the northern earls (1569), however, he found it expedient to go into hiding. Eventually, in 1574, he was pinned down at his York residence in what seems to have been England's earliest priest's hole. He was in effect starved out, and after his arrest he was in due course brought before the high commission. In Grindal's words, the commissioners:<blockquote>knowing his disposition to talk, thought it not good to commit the said Dr Vavasour to the castle of York, where some other like affected remain prisoners; but rather to a solitary prison in the Queen's majesty's castle at Hull, where he shall only talk to the walls. (Nicholson, 351)</blockquote>Apart from a period of house arrest in 1575&#150;7 and a brief release on parole in 1579, he spent the rest of his life there. Ministering to the sick of the gaol during an outbreak of disease, he himself fell ill and died on 12 May 1585. He was buried in Drypool churchyard, Hull.<br>
<br>Under Vavasour's wife, Dorothy, the household remained a centre of York Catholicism until the 1580s. Edmund Campion said mass there during his sensational tour of England in 1580. Two of their sons, Thomas and James, went abroad to study for the priesthood in the Catholic seminaries. Thomas died tragically in 1587, murdered by his guide in Puglia while on a fund-raising trip for the English College at Rome. Dorothy herself was arrested in 1581, in the aftermath of Campion's tour, and spent the rest of her life in the gaols of the Ousegate Bridge in York, together with other female recusants. There she contracted gaol fever, and died on 26 October 1587, with her companions Mary Hutton and Alice Oldcorne dying the day before and the day after. Those who die in gaol are not usually accorded the title of martyr, but there can be little doubt that the Vavasours gave up everything for their faith, undergoing not a short agony, but years of hardship and suffering and the disintegration of their immediate family. Yet not in vain: descendants and relatives of the Vavasours remained prominent in Yorkshire recusancy well into the seventeenth century.<br>
