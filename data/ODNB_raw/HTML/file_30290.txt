<span class="headword">Yule, Sir  Henry</span>  (1820&#150;1889), <span class="occ">geographer</span>, born on 1 May 1820 at Inveresk, near Edinburgh, was the youngest son of Major William Yule (1764&#150;1839) and Elizabeth Paterson (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1827) of Braehead in Ayrshire. The Yule family had for several generations been tenant farmers at Dirleton in East Lothian. Their name was reputed to be of Scandinavian origin. Through his service in the East India Company, Major William Yule gained some knowledge of oriental literature. He retired from India in 1806, and his valuable collection of Persian and Arabic manuscripts was subsequently presented to the British Museum. In 1832 he had privately printed a lithographed edition of the <span class="italic">Apothegms of Ali, the Son of Abu Talib</span>, in Arabic, with an old Persian version and an English translation. <br>
<br>All three of Major William Yule's sons were to follow him to India. The eldest son, <a name="cosubject_30290"></a><span class="headword">Sir George Udny Yule</span>  (1813&#150;1886), was a distinguished Indian civilian and a famous <i>shikari</i>. During the 1857 conflict, with a corps of mounted European volunteers, he was responsible throughout the division of Bhagalpur, keeping open the navigation of the Ganges, while preventing communication between the rebels in East and West Bihar. He subsequently served as chief commissioner of Oudh, as resident at Hyderabad, and finally on the governor-general's council, from which he retired in 1869. In 1862 he married Henrietta Peach, daughter of Captain Robert Boileau Pemberton. Yule was created KCSI and CB before his death in 1886. The statistician <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37086/', "George Udny Yule (1871&#150;1951)")</script> was his son. Major William Yule's second son, <a name="cosubject_30292"></a><span class="headword">Robert Yule</span>  (1817&#150;1857), published a treatise <span class="italic">On Cavalry Movements</span> (1856) as well as some minor writings in prose and verse. After much active service in Persia and Afghanistan he fell near Delhi while leading his regiment, the 9th lancers, during the Indian mutiny.<br>
<br>Henry Yule was educated at the high school in Edinburgh, and later became a pupil of Henry Parr Hamilton, subsequently the dean of Salisbury, and James Challis, who was afterwards appointed as the Plumian professor at Cambridge. His fellow pupils at this time included John Mason Neale and Harvey Goodwin, later bishop of Carlisle. Goodwin later recalled that Yule's intellectual development had been extraordinary for his age, noting in particular that he had &#145;showed much more liking for Greek plays and for German than for mathematics, though he had considerable geometrical ingenuity&#146;  (Trotter, xliv). After a brief and unrewarding spell at University College, London, Yule decided to pursue a career in the army rather than in the law, as his father had originally intended. In 1837 he joined the East India Company's Military College, at Addiscombe, and having passed out at the head of the college in 1838, he spent a year training at the headquarters of the Royal Engineers at Chatham. In 1840 he was appointed to the Bengal Engineers. His first assignment in India was in the Kasia hills, a remote region on the north-east frontier of Bengal inhabited by people of Mongolian descent. Although the official objective of this mission (to establish means of transporting local coal to the plains) was unsuccessful, Yule's fascination with the Kasia led him to publish two accounts of the region and its people.<br>
<br>In 1843 Yule took leave from India to marry his cousin Anna Maria (<i>d</i>. 1875), daughter of General Martin White of the Bengal army. She initially joined him in India, but was soon forced to return to Britain because of ill health. For six years Yule served with men such as Robert Napier, William Baker, and Richard Strachey in the restoration and development of the Mughal irrigation system in the North-Western Provinces. In addition to his role in the organization of extensive engineering works, he was also involved in an official inquiry into the relationship between irrigation and public health in the area of the proposed Ganges Canal. During this period, he also saw active service in the Anglo-Sikh wars of 1845&#150;6 and 1848&#150;9. He then took extended leave, returning to Edinburgh to live with his wife for three years. During this period he lectured at the Scottish Military Academy and published an authoritative volume on fortification (1851), which was translated into French in 1858. Other publications, illustrating his diverse interests at this time, included a polemical defence of the role of the navy in the suppression of the east African slave trade (1850), and an article on Tibet for <span class="italic">Blackwood's Magazine</span>.<br>
<br>A few weeks after the birth of his only child, Amy, in 1852, Yule returned to service in Bengal. Having fulfilled various tasks, including reports on the relatively inaccessible country between Aracan and Burma, and on the defences of Singapore, he was appointed under-secretary to the newly formed department of public works, with particular responsibility for the development of the railway system. His work on the railways was interrupted by an appointment in 1855 as secretary to Colonel Arthur Phayre's mission to Burma, which resulted in Yule's first widely acclaimed publication, <span class="italic">A Narrative of the Mission &hellip; to &hellip; Ava</span> (1858), illustrated by his own sketches. His ordinary duties were considerably augmented by the violent conflict of 1857, which led to a large influx of troops into India. While his relations with the governors-general during this period (Dalhousie and Canning) appear to have been close, Yule seems to have become increasingly disenchanted with his work in India and in 1862 he retired from the army for good. Canning's death in the same year reduced his chances of securing an official appointment in London, but through the influence of Sir Roderick Murchison he was in 1863 created CB.<br>
<br>After spending some time in Switzerland, Tuscany, and Savoy (where he met John Ruskin), Yule and his family eventually settled at Palermo, in Sicily. The location suited his wife, by now an invalid, and also provided ample opportunities for further study in the richly stocked public libraries. Two publications for the Hakluyt Society (<span class="italic">Mirabilia descripta: the Wonders of the East</span> (1863), a translation from the Latin of Friar Jordanus's fourteenth-century narrative, and <span class="italic">Cathay and the Way Thither</span> (1866), a substantial compendium of extracts from other travellers) established his reputation as a scholar of medieval European literature on the East. But it was his new edition of the <span class="italic">Travels of Marco Polo</span>, published in 1871 (for which he was awarded the gold medal of the Italian Geographical Society and the founder's medal of the Royal Geographical Society), which secured him lasting fame. This two-volume work, long in gestation, represented the fruit not only of his own extensive researches in Palermo, Venice, Florence, Paris, and London, but also of extensive correspondence with scholars throughout the world, including Cristoforo Negri (founder of the Italian Geographical Society) and George Perkins Marsh. It has long been considered an authoritative, if somewhat voluminous, source on Marco Polo's travels.<br>
<br>Yule returned to England in 1875, following the death of his first wife, and soon afterwards was appointed to the Council of India, on which he continued to serve until shortly before his death. During the years which followed the publication of his <i>magnum opus</i>, an enlarged edition of which appeared in 1875, Yule was considered to be one of the leading authorities on the historical geography of central Asia in general and the history of medieval travel writing in particular. Some contemporaries even compared central Asia before Yule to central Africa before Livingstone. Yule's pioneering and meticulous scholarship was certainly unrivalled, perhaps extravagant. He had an encyclopaedic memory, and, as his daughter later observed, he was always restless away from his books. He was president of the Hakluyt Society (1877&#150;89) and of the Asiatic Society (1885&#150;7), and, late in his life, became a vice-president of the Royal Geographical Society (1887&#150;9). He would probably have become president of this last society earlier in his career, were it not for his protest against its decision in 1878 to provide a formal welcome for Henry Morton Stanley, whose violent methods of exploration in central Africa had attracted considerable criticism. Yule's protest, in which he was joined by the young H. M. Hyndman, led to his resignation from the council. In this, and in other matters, his characteristic integrity was combined with a single-mindedness which could strain even the closest of his friendships.<br>
<br>Yule's edition of Marco Polo was succeeded by several other scholarly works, including a fine essay on the topography of the Upper Oxus region (for a new edition of John Wood's <span class="italic">Journey to the Oxus</span>, 1872), and introductions to Nikolay Przhevalsky's <span class="italic">Mongolia</span> (1876) and Captain William Gill's account of the vast river system originating in eastern Tibet, <span class="italic">The River of Golden Sand</span> (1880). During the last fifteen years of his life, he devoted his energies to a range of works, including a series of astute biographical notices (mainly for the <span class="italic">Royal Engineers' Journal</span>) and a number of geographical entries for the <span class="italic">Encyclopaedia Britannica</span>. His last major publication was a three-volume edition of the <span class="italic">Diary of Sir William Hedges</span> (1887) for the Hakluyt Society, a work which provides considerable insight into the working of the East India Company, and much else besides. However, Yule's reputation rests less on these scholarly writings than on his authorship (with A. C. Burnell) of an extraordinary glossary of Anglo-Indian colloquial words and phrases, published under the felicitous title <span class="italic">Hobson-Jobson</span>, in 1886. This encyclopaedic work, which has been reprinted several times since, provides modern historians with a unique view of the everyday language of British officers in colonial India. Yule was fascinated by the complex history of the incorporation of Hindustani, Bengali, and other Indian terms into English usage, and his rendering of this history in the form of an idiosyncratic yet highly engaging glossary has proved, perhaps ironically, to be his most enduring literary contribution.<br>
<br>Yule's second marriage in 1877 to Mary Wilhelmina Skipwith, daughter of Fulwar Skipwith of the Bengal civil service, was cut short by her death on 26 April 1881. He received the honorary degree of LLD from Edinburgh in 1884, served as a royal commissioner for the Indian and Colonial Exhibition of 1886, and was created KCSI in 1889. He died at his residence 3 Pen-y-Wern Road, Earls Court, London on 30 December 1889, and was buried on 3 January 1890 at Tunbridge Wells. Shortly before his death he received the news that he had been nominated as a corresponding member of the Institut de France. His reply, dictated through his daughter, was composed with characteristic grace and economy: &#145;Reddo gratias, Illustrissimi Domini, ob honores tanto nimios quanto immeritos. Mihi robora deficiunt, vita collabitur, accipiatis voluntatem pro facto. Cum corde pleno et gratissimo moriturus vos, illustrissimi domini, saluto. Yule&#146;  (Yule, lxx&#150;lxxi). While his obituarists treated these noble words as a fitting epitaph, a no less telling assessment of Yule's singular character is to be found in Clements Markham's manuscript history of the Royal Geographical Society, where it is recorded that:<blockquote>Sir Henry Yule was a linguist and an accomplished scholar. He was deeply versed in historical geography. He loved intricate research and wandering into the bye paths of history &hellip; Tyranny and cruelty aroused his scorn and indignation, and he made a strong protest against H. M. Stanley's methods. Next to cruelty what aroused his anger most was the neglect of an author to make an index to his work. (Markham, 461)</blockquote>
