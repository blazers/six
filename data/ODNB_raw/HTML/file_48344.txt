<span class="headword">Tiarks,  Frank Cyril</span>  (1874&#150;1952), <span class="occ">merchant banker</span>, was born on 9 July 1874 in Balham, London, the fourth of the eleven children of Henry Frederic Tiarks (1832&#150;1911), merchant banker, and his wife, Agnes Morris. His grandfather, the Revd Johann Gerhard Tiarks (1794&#150;1858), from Jever in the duchy of Oldenburg, was the pastor of the Reformed Lutheran church in east London from 1827 until his death; he was also chaplain to the duchess of Kent and a prominent figure in Anglo-German circles. In 1847 Henry Tiarks joined the merchant bank J. Henry Schroder &amp; Co., sponsored by a parishioner of his father who was a partner in the firm. In 1862 he married Agnes Morris, the adopted daughter of Alexander Schl&uuml;sser, another partner and a distant relation of the Schr&ouml;der family; in the same year he was promoted to office manager. In 1871, upon Schl&uuml;sser's retirement, Henry Tiarks was made a partner.<br>
<br>The 1870s were prosperous years for Schroders and in 1877 Henry Tiarks and his family moved to Foxbury, a forty-room house with 170 acres at Chislehurst, Kent. Henry Tiarks retired at the end of 1905 and died in 1911. His legacy was not only an estate worth &pound;0.5 million, but the establishment of a dynastic partnership with the Schr&ouml;der family that continued for two more generations and lasted altogether for more than a century.<br>
<br>Frank Tiarks's education began at a private school in Greenwich and continued, from 1887, at HMS <i>Britannia</i>, the naval training college. Commissioned as a lieutenant he joined HMS <i>Warspite</i>, but he left the navy in 1894 following the death of his elder brother, who had been intended for the Schroder partnership. Now it fell to Frank to become the banker.<br>
<br>Tiarks's career as a merchant banker began in the traditional manner. After becoming acquainted with the procedures of the London office, he worked as an unpaid &#145;volunteer&#146; in several firms with which Schroders had close connections, in Le Havre, New York, and Hamburg. While in Hamburg he fell in love with Emmy Broedermann (<i>d</i>. 1943), the daughter of a Hamburg banker, and they were married in 1899. In 1902, aged twenty-eight, Tiarks was made a partner, joining his father and Baron Sir John Henry Schr&ouml;der, the senior partner, who were both in their sixties, and the senior partner's nephew, Bruno Schr&ouml;der, aged thirty-five. Within a few years the two younger partners had taken over the running of the firm.<br>
<br>Tiarks quickly established a formidable reputation in the City. He was appointed to the court of the Bank of England in 1912, having been obliged to decline an earlier invitation because Baron Sir John Henry Schr&ouml;der objected to his &#145;wasting time on outside business&#146;  (<span class="italic">DBB</span>). Ironically, just two years later, in August 1914, it was Tiarks's influence at the Bank of England that saved Schroders from seizure as enemy property, by arranging the hurried naturalization of Baron Bruno Schr&ouml;der, by then the firm's principal proprietor, three days after the outbreak of war. In recognition of this service, the new partnership agreement drawn up in 1919 gave Tiarks a one-third interest in the firm's profits, which was considerably greater than his contribution to capital.<br>
<br>In the early part of the war Tiarks actively assisted the governor of the Bank of England in handling the disruptions to the City caused by the conflict, particularly the non-repayment of credits by German clients to British banks. In May 1917 he rejoined the navy, working in naval intelligence. In 1919 he served as financial adviser to the British army of occupation in Germany.<br>
<br>In the 1920s Tiarks played a leading role in the development of Schroders' business, along with Baron Bruno Schr&ouml;der and Major Albert Pam. Tiarks was particularly active in the development of the corporate finance side of the business. Notable among his achievements in these years were the establishment of the Pressed Steel Company of Great Britain Ltd at Cowley, Oxford, which pioneered the cold steel pressing process for car bodies in Britain, and the formation of Schroders' New York investment banking business, the J. Henry Schroder Banking Corporation. In 1926 his son <a href="#cosubject_57971">Henry [<i>see below</i>]</a>, the eldest of his five children, joined him in the partnership.<br>
<br>Schroders' business in the finance of international trade expanded greatly in the 1920s, by serving the desperate credit needs of banks and businesses in Germany and central Europe. By the early 1930s approximately four-fifths of Schroders' acceptance business was with such clients. Thus the German suspension of international payments in July 1931 was potentially disastrous. Tiarks's knowledge and experience made him ideally qualified to act as chairman of the body established to make terms for the recovery of British credits. These negotiations produced the first &#145;standstill agreement&#146; of September 1931, and Tiarks played a leading part in the discussions which led to its annual renewals over the decade. From 1934 he was also chairman of the International Committee of Creditors.<br>
<br>Like many prominent British nationals with strong German ties, Tiarks hoped for a reconciliation between Britain and Germany. Thus in 1935 he participated in the foundation of the Anglo-German Fellowship to promote mutual trust and understanding. A visit to Cologne in March 1939 to address the fellowship was attacked by critics of appeasement, though his words were unobjectionable.<br>
<br>Aged sixty-five in 1939, Tiarks's retirement from active involvement in Schroders' affairs coincided with the lull in business brought about by the Second World War. Tiarks stepped down from the court of the Bank of England in 1945 and from the Schroders partnership in 1948. The latter year also saw his retirement from the board of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, upon which he had served from 1917 and on whose behalf he paid two visits to Iran in the 1940s. His distinguished career and his public services were recognized by appointment as OBE, as a lieutenant of the City of London from 1911, and as high sheriff of Kent in 1927.<br>
<br>Energy, common sense, decisiveness, and humour were the qualities commonly ascribed to Frank Tiarks. Henry Andrews, a manager at Schroders in the 1920s, recalled:<blockquote>[Tiarks] had a strong personality and no doubt those who did not regularly come into contact with him may have thought he was rather frightening because he was also very quick. The strongest impression was one of vitality and gaiety. He laughed for sheer enjoyment and his laugh had a gay ring and you could watch the images and ideas forming themselves on his face and those thoughts always led to a conclusion. (<span class="italic">DBB</span>)</blockquote>Prentiss Gray, an American colleague, esteemed him the best &#145;closer&#146; of a deal he had ever met. &#145;Toughness tempered by human graces&#146;, wrote his obituarist in <span class="italic">The Times</span>, &#145;made him a first-rate banker, a resourceful negotiator, and at all times the best of company.&#146;<br>
<br>Tiarks spent most of the last decade of his life in Somerset, having sold Foxbury in 1936. He enjoyed country pursuits and with his brother founded the Mendip foxhounds, of which he was joint master for forty years. In his youth he was a keen polo player, and he was responsible for the introduction of the game to Germany in 1898; he had maintained two polo grounds and a riding school at Foxbury. In later life he took an enthusiastic interest in the Webbington cricket club. His wife predeceased him, dying in 1943. Tiarks died on 7 April 1952, at his home, North Lodge, Loxton, Somerset.<br>
<br>Tiarks's eldest son, <a name="cosubject_57971"></a><span class="headword">Henry Frederic Tiarks</span>  (1900&#150;1995), <span class="occ">merchant banker</span>, was born on 8 September 1900 at Foxbury and educated at Eton College (1913&#150;18), where he acquired his lifelong interest in astronomy. He served briefly as a midshipman in the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve in 1918, then gained banking experience overseas, represented Schroders in Chile and Bolivia, and in 1926 joined the partnership. On 28 April 1930 he married Lady Millicent Olivia Mary (<i>d</i>. 1975), only daughter of Geoffrey Thomas Taylour, fourth marquess of Headfort; they had one son. The marriage was dissolved in 1936, and on 3 October 1936 Tiarks married Joan (1903&#150;1989), daughter of Francis Marshman-Bell and, until her marriage, a popular West End and film actress under the name Joan Barry; they had one son and one daughter. In the Second World War, Tiarks served as an RAF officer and had charge of London barrage balloons, but was invalided out by tuberculosis and returned to Schroders as a senior partner. Used to a different lifestyle, he disliked the modern professional City and adopted an ambassadorial role, cultivating new clients and government contacts. He was a director of companies linked with Schroders (including Pressed Steel and Joseph Lucas) and led overseas delegations for the board of trade. He resigned as an executive of Schroders a few months after it merged with Helbert Wagg in 1962, but remained on the board until 1965. Tiarks was tall, dark, and slim, and among his interests (besides astronomy) were nature conservation, polo, and golf. He retired for health and tax reasons to Marbella, Spain, and died there on 2 July 1995. He was survived by his daughter, Henrietta, who in 1961 married the marquess of Tavistock; his two sons predeceased him.<br>
