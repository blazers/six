</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Wolfson, Sir  Isaac</span>, first baronet  (1897&#150;1991), <span class="occ">businessman and philanthropist</span>, was born on 1 October 1897 at 12 Kidston Street, Glasgow, the second of three sons and one of nine children of Solomon Wolfson (1868&#150;1941), a poor Orthodox Jewish immigrant from Russian Poland, who worked in Glasgow as a maker of picture frames and later became a JP, and his wife, Necho or Naelia, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Wilemson or Williamovsky (<i>d</i>. 1943). Isaac Wolfson's parents had emigrated from Bia&#322;ystok, Russian Poland, in the 1890s. Wolfson's recorded formal education was slight; he left Queen's Park School, Glasgow, as soon as possible, at the age of fourteen, to augment the family income. But he also had the advantages of a strong religious home life and upbringing, which instilled in him the virtues of thrift, self-help, and charity; these characteristics helped him to rise above and to overcome the social deprivation which surrounded him, and they stayed with him all his life.<br>
<br>Wolfson's first job was to assist in his father's workshop. Later he took to the road as a salesman, first on his father's behalf but subsequently on his own account, selling clocks and mirrors. On 14 February 1926, at the Central Synagogue, London, he married Edith (1906&#150;1981), daughter of Ralph Specterman, a cinema proprietor; they had one son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/103360/', "Leonard Gordon Wolfson (1927&#150;2010)")</script>. It was also in 1926, in Manchester, that he met and impressed the head of an undistinguished mail-order company, who engaged him as a buyer. The firm&#151;Universal Stores&#151;specialized in what was known as &#145;club trading&#146;. Its agents formed clubs into which members paid small amounts of money; when these totalled &pound;1, the member was entitled to select goods from the company's catalogue. In 1930 the company was renamed Great Universal Stores (GUS); Wolfson became its merchandise controller in 1932 and (having purchased a majority share in the company) its joint managing director in 1933. In 1946 he became chairman of GUS, and he remained its sole chairman until 1981. From then until 1986 the chairmanship was divided between himself and his son, Leonard.<br>
<br>Wolfson did not make the mistake of permitting GUS to depend solely on its mail-order foundations, nor did he display the merchandising complacency which characterized so many family-owned mail-order companies at this time. He bought new companies in the mail-order and &#145;tallyman&#146; businesses, and diversified into other retail markets, seizing the opportunity presented by the wartime and post-war financial weakness of rival companies to buy them out. His use of class &#145;A&#146; ordinary shares&#151;which lacked voting rights&#151;to fund many of these endeavours later proved controversial. Use of these shares, which were at the time highly popular on account of the profitability of GUS, enabled Wolfson to retain family control of the company, and to avoid paying cash for his business acquisitions. Through a series of take-overs during and immediately after the Second World War, GUS had by the 1950s become the largest mail-order business outside the USA, and it was estimated that a quarter of the population of Britain were customers. Wolfson also controlled 2 per cent of Britain's shoe shops, 5 per cent of its furniture business, a number of fashion stores, a supermarket chain, a housing construction company, and a travel agency. In 1968 Wolfson made a successful bid of &pound;12.5 million in cash and shares for the Times Furnishing-Willerby group, thus adding 170 shops to the GUS empire, in menswear retailing and furnishing. At the time of his death Wolfson had turned GUS into the fifth wealthiest retail undertaking in the country, enjoying profits of more than &pound;400 million annually and a stock-market value of some &pound;3 billion; about half its profits still came from mail order, while almost 30 per cent came from finance.<br>
<br>Wolfson's leadership of the company was characterized by an unfailing appreciation of changes in consumer tastes&#151;specifically the tastes of GUS's clientele, which was mainly working and lower-middle class&#151;and by an instinctive grasp of the potential for lending money, the significance of property values, and the realizable potential of company assets. But it was underpinned by the belief that the acquisition of wealth could be justified only if it contributed to the public good&#151;a reflection of the Orthodox Jewish ethos in which he had been brought up. Wolfson was a prodigious maker of charitable donations, beyond as well as within the Jewish world. Through the Wolfson Foundation which he established with his wife and son, and of which he was trustee from 1955 to 1991, he helped to establish the two postgraduate colleges which bear his family name, in 1966 at Oxford and in 1977 at Cambridge, while the foundation continued to support a wide variety of other grant-giving activities, more especially in the fields of health and education. By the time of his death the foundation&#151; of which he was chairman from 1963 to 1972, president from 1972 to 1986, and honorary life president from 1986 to 1991&#151;had disbursed some &pound;130 million, making its founder Britain's biggest private benefactor since Lord Nuffield.<br>
<br>Wolfson became an avid collector of art. But he himself was a shy man, who lived without ostentation and who neither smoked nor drank. His major personal interests sprang from his Jewish upbringing. An enthusiastic and unapologetic exponent of Orthodoxy, he was a regular synagogue attender and was conscientious in his observance of Jewish dietary laws. He quickly rose through the ranks of the London-based United Synagogue, established by act of parliament in 1870, whose religious leader was the chief rabbi. The United Synagogue had been dominated first by the Rothschilds and then by the male heads of other wealthy semi-aristocratic titled Anglo-Jewish families, who had for the most part abandoned their Orthodox roots. In 1962 Wolfson was elected president of the United Synagogue&#151;the first practising Orthodox holder of that office&#151;and by virtue of holding this office he also became the chairman of the chief rabbinate council. His accession to these positions symbolized the transfer of power within Anglo-Jewry from the old, Anglicized families to the children of the eastern-European immigrants of the late nineteenth century. Wolfson did not regard these posts as mere sinecures, however. In 1964 he took the initiative in persuading the United Synagogue to dismiss the entire board of management of the New West End Synagogue, London, following that board's decision to appoint as their minister Rabbi Dr Louis Jacobs, whom the then chief rabbi, Sir Israel Brodie, had branded a heretic. Two years later Wolfson was primarily responsible for the election of Dr Immanuel Jakobovits as the United Synagogue's chief rabbi in succession to Brodie.<br>
<br>Wolfson was also&#151;again, unlike previous lay heads of the United Synagogue&#151;a committed Zionist. He owned many companies in Israel, including Paz Oil, the profits from which were applied exclusively to charitable causes. He paid for the building, in Jerusalem, of the Hechal Shlomo&#151;the Sanctuary of Solomon, named in memory of his father&#151;which houses the offices of the chief rabbinate of Israel. Wolfson's money also built fifty synagogues in Israel and supported a number of important housing developments in Jerusalem and Acre, as well as the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and the Weizmann Institute of Science at Rehovot. Wolfson and his family lived in London, but also in Rehovot, near the Weizmann Institute, and it was to Rehovot that he retired to live out his final years.<br>
<br>In 1986 Wolfson stepped down from the joint chairmanship of GUS, which had come in for criticism on account of its perceived lack of initiative and innovation and its over-reliance on cash holdings. Wolfson adamantly refused to support the enfranchisement of non-voting shareholders, and it was suggested at the time that &#145;his influence was largely responsible for&#146; the company's &#145;lacklustre though financially solid performance in the early 1980s&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>). In 1986 an agreement concerning business credit was reached with Harris Queensway, whose chairman, Sir Philip Harris, joined the board of GUS. Wolfson's son and heir, Leonard Wolfson, became sole chairman; Isaac Wolfson himself became its honorary life president.<br>
<br>During his lifetime Wolfson amassed many honours, including a string of honorary degrees, and in 1963 he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society; he was also a freeman of the city of Glasgow (1971), founder fellow of Wolfson College, Oxford, and honorary fellow of the Weizmann Institute of Science, Israel. On 19 February 1962 he was created baronet, as Sir Isaac Wolfson of St Marylebone, but the expected peerage eluded him. Wolfson died in Rehovot on 20 June 1991, and was buried in Israel. He was succeeded as second baronet by his son, Leonard, who had been created a life peer in 1985.<br>
