<span class="headword">Dodd, Sir  Edward James</span>  (1909&#150;1966), <span class="occ">police officer</span>, was born at 111 Wantage Road, Reading, Berkshire, on 19 October 1909, the son of James Dodd, a council meat inspector, and his wife, Alice, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Razzall (whose father was the archbishop of York's gardener). He attended Reading School, 1920&#150;25. A family seagoing tradition led to his becoming a cadet on HMS <i>Conway</i> and then with the Cunard company. Having obtained his second mate's certificate and risen to fourth mate and a sub-lieutenant in the Royal Navy Reserve, he judged that the shipping depression meant there would be few opportunities in the merchant service and he decided to join the Metropolitan Police.<br>
<br>Ted Dodd, as he was known, attested constable in October 1932 and served first at Tottenham Court Road. Benefiting from Lord Trenchard's police college scheme, he was selected in 1934 (in the category reserved for serving officers) for the first of the Hendon courses. Devoid of the more advantaged social and educational background of some of his peers, Dodd shone by reason of his personality, intelligence, and the confidence he had acquired from his time in the merchant service. He later reflected that his time spent at sea equipped him better for his police career than a university education would have done  (<span class="italic">Birmingham Post</span>, 2 Sept 1963). He was the leader of a party of three (including Joseph Simpson, later metropolitan commissioner) that visited the Paris Police in August 1934. After graduating in September 1935, he served as second in charge at Blackheath and Vine Street, was promoted station inspector in April 1938, and then sub-divisional inspector in charge of the Gray's Inn Road sub-division from December 1938. He married Evelyn Mary Mackenzie, a dancing mistress, aged twenty-six, at St Peter's, Early, Berkshire, on 10 July 1937. His wife, the daughter of Henry James Mackenzie, came from a well-to-do Reading family and provided social as well as personal support. They had a son and a daughter.<br>
<br>In 1941 Dodd was the most junior member on a short list of seven for the post of second assistant chief constable at Birmingham, then one of the largest city forces and with a good reputation under its chief constable William Johnson. Dodd was successful and took up his post in a city about which&#151;he later admitted&#151;he knew little. The first assistant chief constable being called away in 1943 on war service, Dodd took his place&#151;in January 1945 substantively. Later in 1945 Johnson was called to HM inspectorate, and the Birmingham watch committee advertised for a successor. Appalled by the low calibre of the applicants except for Dodd, the watch committee badgered the Home Office to be allowed to appoint Dodd and this was, exceptionally, permitted, despite his relatively young age (thirty-five).<br>
<br>Among Dodd's most pressing priorities was to build up a force both when its strength had become much run down during the war and when it had to battle for recruits in an adverse labour market. He set about this with his customary energy and far-sightedness. He was particularly supportive of the police cadet system which he introduced and which was designed to prepare school leavers from the age of fifteen for attestation at eighteen. (Cadets at one time produced 40 per cent a year of his constable recruits.) He widened the curriculum and fostered &#145;outward bound&#146; activities and participation in the duke of Edinburgh's award scheme. He persuaded the council to give priority to the provision of police housing, and found money for improving social, sporting, and recreational facilities. He sought and always readily responded to speaking invitations in Birmingham, where his engaging style won friends and understanding for his force. Entirely without side (he made it clear, for example, that he was not a mason and did not wish to be), he had a direct personal manner, which exuded friendliness and approachability within a confident and firm management style. At a retirement interview, he could take the trouble to convince a senior but unpromoted constable that his service had been of real value and his contribution genuinely appreciated. When his chauffeured car met a Birmingham traffic jam, he did not think it beneath him to leap out, take point, and get things moving again. His encouragement helped to equip his best men for senior posts throughout the service, including as chief constables and, in two cases, as HM chief inspector of constabulary.<br>
<br>Dodd's personality and evident competence played well with the Birmingham watch committee, then a group of the most senior city councillors and, like all watch committees, with considerable authority over the day-to-day running of the force until their powers were clipped by the <span class="roman">Police Act</span> 1964. He also played an increasingly national role which was recognized as early as 1949 by his appointment as CBE. His most important operational innovation&#151;based on the experiment of setting up a Birmingham-wide crime squad&#151;was to create a cross-force detective squad where his charm and determination persuaded neighbouring chief constables to second detective officers to a wholly new form of joint working. The resulting Midlands crime squad became the pattern for a system that went national in 1964 shortly after Dodd arrived at the Home Office. Much crime might be local but a good deal was not.<br>
<br>Dodd was the dominant figure in his regional conference area (which became known as &#145;Dodd's own country&#146;). His many other roles included work at police training centres, in traffic committees, on the advisory board of what became the Bramshill Police College, and in the chief constables' association newly put together in 1949 from two formerly separate organizations. He was one of the leaders in the preparation and presentation of the Association of Chief Police Officers' evidence to the Willink royal commission on the police service, 1960&#150;62. Representing an association many of whose members came from small forces entailed playing a conservative hand, which stressed the value of the really local and the relationship with the immediate local authority. Although the commission's recommendations on force areas favoured the views of the Lancashire chief constable Eric St Johnston, who argued for fewer and larger forces, the commission accepted the proposals favoured by Dodd and his colleagues as to the position of chief constables <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> watch committees and the desirability of strengthening the role and resources of the inspectorate.<br>
<br>Willink recommended that there should be a chief inspector of constabulary supported by a large staff and overseeing a research and planning branch. Although there had been a power to appoint such an officer since 1945, it had not been used. When it became public knowledge that the Home Office intended now to make such an appointment, speculation veered between Dodd and St Johnston as the most likely appointee. The officials involved probably never considered recommending anyone other than Dodd. From the beginning at Birmingham he had won unreserved praise from HM inspectors, who observed also how he ran not only an effective ship, but one where morale was high.<br>
<br>Appointed chief inspector of constabulary with effect from 1 September 1963, Dodd reorganized the inspectors on a more professional footing with designated offices in the provinces and staff support. Retirements allowed him to bring into the inspectorate trusted former colleagues like Peter Brodie and Stanley Peck, chief constables of Warwickshire and Staffordshire respectively. He set up the police research and planning branch to create strategic focus for policing operations. Entering into Whitehall, he played an influential part in the post-Willink settlement as principal professional adviser, working harmoniously with officials and three home secretaries. He was knighted in 1964. He was associated also with the introduction of personal radios, experiments with helicopters, and other improvements in police equipment of lasting importance.<br>
<br>Dodd suffered from asthma which had necessitated hospital treatment in the UK and then in Switzerland. On a second visit to a Swiss clinic, at Heiligenschwendi, for treatment, he died in a wheelchair on 16 September 1966 before reaching his room. Reckoned &#145;one of the most dynamic and effective police officers of his generation&#146;  (<span class="italic">Birmingham Mail</span>, 19 Sept 1966), he was thought to have sacrificed himself in accepting his final post and had taken it only out of a sense of public duty: &#145;He brought tremendous reserves of energy to the task of remoulding the police service in the new conditions created by the <span class="roman">Police Act</span>, 1964 to meet the growing menace of organized crime&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 19 Sept 1966). He was cremated at Mortlake on 23 September, and there were memorial services at St Margaret's, Westminster, and at St Martin's, Birmingham, the city force's church.<br>
<br>Dodd's career typified, and to many vindicated, the product of the short-lived experiment of the Hendon Police College which closed in 1939. Many of its graduates later took on some of the most demanding senior roles in the service. Dodd defended the college: &#145;You have to have officers and leaders in any organisation and an &#147;officer class&#148; surely means people who are capable of carrying out higher responsibilities.&#146;  (<span class="italic">Birmingham Post</span>, 2 Sept 1963). Hendon accelerated his ascent and made possible his appointment to a senior role in a major city force at an early age. The new role of chief inspector could not have been given a better start, even in the short time that proved available to its incumbent.<br>
