<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Drummond family</span>  (<em>per. </em>1363&#150;1518), <span class="occ">nobility</span>, was a Perthshire family of purely local importance until the mid-fourteenth century. Their rise began when <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/54287/', "Margaret (n&#233;e Drummond)")</script>, widow of John Logie, became the second consort of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/3726/', "King David II")</script> in 1363. Thereafter David promoted the interests of his new wife's relatives, including her nephew <a name="cosubject_54171"></a><span class="headword">Sir Malcolm Drummond</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1402?)<span class="occ"></span>, who benefited from a series of grants of Perthshire lands. The Drummond family's growing importance at David's court undoubtedly explains the marriage of Malcolm's sister <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8063/', "Annabella")</script>, between 13 March 1366 and 31 May 1367, to the king's likely successor, John Stewart of Kyle, the future earl of Carrick and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/23714/', "King Robert III")</script>. The exact date of Drummond's own prestigious marriage to Isabella (<i>d</i>. 1408), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7924/', "William Douglas, first earl of Douglas")</script>, is unknown, but may also have dated from the period of Queen Margaret's influence at the heart of royal government. The political ascendancy of the Drummond family was threatened first by David's decision to divorce Queen Margaret (who had failed to produce an heir in the late 1360s), and then by the king's own early death on 22 February 1371. Despite these setbacks, Drummond retained a number of powerful political allies after 1371, and in particular he enjoyed a close relationship with his two brothers-in-law, John Stewart, earl of Carrick, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7890/', "James Douglas, second earl of Douglas")</script>. In the 1380s, by now a knight, Sir Malcolm was an active participant in the border raids and Anglo-Scottish warfare promoted by Carrick and Douglas. In 1385 he received 400 livres tournais from a French war subsidy designed to encourage and reward Scottish noblemen involved in that year's joint Franco-Scottish assault on northern England. In August 1388 Drummond was a member of a raiding force led by the earl of Douglas which encountered and defeated a northern English army at Otterburn, and was said to have played a leading role in the battle.<br>
<br>The death of the second earl of Douglas at Otterburn had a profound effect on Sir Malcolm Drummond's career. Earl James died childless and Drummond, as the husband of James's sister, had a powerful claim to control the extensive estates, titles, and offices of the Douglas earls by right of his wife. Moreover, his claims were supported by Carrick, at that stage guardian of the kingdom on behalf of the incapacitated Robert II. Despite this powerful backing, Drummond lost out in the struggle for possession of the Douglas lordships to Archibald Douglas, lord of Galloway, who became third earl of Douglas in April 1389 on the basis of an earlier entail of the Douglas estates. Drummond stayed away from the council meeting which ruled against him, claiming to fear for his life, and may even have hoped to recover his losses with English support&#151;a possibility ruled out by an Anglo-Scottish truce shortly afterwards. He was more successful in upholding his wife's claim to estates in the earldom of Mar, and by October 1393 at the latest he was accorded the courtesy title lord of Mar.<br>
<br>In the 1390s Drummond offered consistent support to the political ambitions of his nephew <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26468/', "David Stewart, earl of Carrick (later duke of Rothesay)")</script>, the eldest son and heir of Robert III. In 1399 he and his sister Queen Annabella acquiesced in a coup which saw Rothesay established as lieutenant and guardian of the kingdom at the expense of Robert III. Late in 1401, however, having alienated many of the most powerful magnates in the kingdom, Rothesay was arrested on the orders of his uncle the duke of Albany, and imprisoned in Falkland Castle, where he died in March 1402. Drummond may well have been arrested at about the same time as his nephew, as part of a campaign to neutralize Rothesay's supporters. The chronicler Wyntoun records that Sir Malcolm was surprised and captured (by unspecified persons) and kept in close confinement under conditions which eventually caused his death. The exact date of his demise is unknown, but he was certainly dead by 8 November 1402.<br>
<br>There were no children of Drummond's marriage to Isabella Douglas, who in 1404 married Alexander Stewart, son of the earl of Buchan and a nephew of Robert III. Consequently the main line of the family descended through Malcolm's brother John Drummond of Cargill (<i>d</i>. 1424). John, his son Sir Walter (<i>d</i>. 1455), and his grandson Sir Malcolm (<i>d</i>. 1470), were once again of only local consequence. But the second Sir Malcolm's son <a name="cosubject_8076"></a><span class="headword">John Drummond</span>, first Lord Drummond  (<em>d.</em> 1518)<span class="occ"></span>, restored the family to national prominence, beginning in the 1470s. On 20 March 1474 King James III confirmed the resignation by Maurice Drummond of Concraig of his hereditary right to the offices of steward, coroner, and forester of the earldom of Strathearn in favour of his kinsman John Drummond of Cargill. The Strathearn offices had, however, been occupied since <i>c</i>.1437 by members of the Murray of Tullibardine family who immediately objected to the new grant. By September 1475 James III had reversed his decision and revoked his earlier grant. Although John Drummond was occasionally to be found in royal service thereafter, most notably as one of the men appointed to negotiate a peace treaty and marriage alliance between James III and Richard III of England in 1484, his relationship with James never seems to have recovered from the events of 1474&#150;5. On 29 January 1488, when he was facing intense political opposition, the king made John a lord of parliament with the title of first Lord Drummond. If the creation was designed to secure his loyalty to James's regime, then it was in vain. In the spring of 1488 Drummond joined the rebellion against James III which was nominally led by the latter's own son and heir, the future James IV. James III's death at the battle of Sauchieburn on 11 June paved the way for Prince James's supporters to dominate the new royal establishment, and Drummond immediately displaced Sir William Murray of Tullibardine as steward of Strathearn and organized the removal of Murray's kinsmen from royal lands in the earldom. A fierce feud ensued, culminating in 1490 in the massacre of twenty of Sir William's men in the kirk of Monzievaird by a party of Drummonds led by John's son David. Lord Drummond and Sir William Murray were briefly taken into royal custody in 1491 in an effort to contain the dispute, while David Drummond seems to have been executed by May 1492. Drummond's influence in James IV's administration may have waned briefly as a result of this dispute, but a revival of his fortunes during 1495 saw him appointed as royal justiciar in February (an office he held until 1501) and confirmed in the disputed Strathearn offices in October. His place in the young king's favour was secured by the romantic liaison between James and Drummond's daughter <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8079/', "Margaret Drummond")</script> who was resident in the royal castle of Stirling by June 1496, and who bore the king an illegitimate daughter in the following year.<br>
<br>John Drummond appears to have retained the goodwill of James IV (despite the ending of the king's liaison with Margaret in 1498) until the end of the king's reign and life at the battle of Flodden in 1513. One of the few Scottish lords of note to escape unscathed from Flodden, Drummond soon became embroiled in the faction-fighting of the minority of James V. He was identified with the pro-English faction headed by his own grandson Archibald Douglas, sixth earl of Angus, and supported Angus's marriage in 1514 to James IV's widow, Margaret. A reaction against Angus's influence saw John, duke of Albany, appointed as regent and tutor to the young James V. When Sir William Cumming, Lyon king of arms, was sent by Albany to summon Angus before the regency council, John Drummond struck him. Drummond was tried before parliament in July 1515 for, among other things, his violent conduct against the royal herald. Found guilty, he was forfeited and imprisoned in Blackness Castle. However, in 1516 he pledged his support to Albany's regime and on 22 November was pardoned and restored to some of his estates. Drummond died shortly thereafter, perhaps on or about 4 August 1518. He was reputedly buried in the kirk of Innerpeffray.<br>
<br>John Drummond was married before 3 February 1483 to Elizabeth Lindsay, thought to have been the daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16678/', "Alexander Lindsay, fourth earl of Crawford")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/54265/', "Lindsay family, earls of Crawford")</script>]. They had several children. Three of their sons, Malcolm, William, and David, predeceased their father, as did William's eldest son, Walter. John was thus succeeded by his great-grandson David, who became second Lord Drummond. Of their daughters the most famous was Margaret, the mistress of James IV, who seems to have died <i>c</i>.1502. Another, Elizabeth, married George Douglas, master of Angus, as her second husband, and was the mother of the sixth earl of Angus.<br>
