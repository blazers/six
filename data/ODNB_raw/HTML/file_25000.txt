<span class="headword">Seckford,  Thomas</span>  (1515/16&#150;1587), <span class="occ">lawyer and administrator</span>, was the second son of Thomas Seckford (<i>c</i>.1495&#150;1575), of Great Bealings in Suffolk, and Margaret, daughter of Sir John Wingfield of Letheringham in the same county. A monument erected by him to his parents at Great Bealings reveals his age as sixty-seven in 1583. The Seckfords had been lords of the manor of Great Bealings since the fourteenth century, and the elder Thomas rebuilt Seckford Hall there. The son was admitted to Gray's Inn in 1540, at the same time as William Cecil (later Lord Burghley), perhaps after a spell at Cambridge and an inn of chancery. Although he was called to the bar, and in 1556 delivered a reading and became a bencher, little is known of his legal practice save that he is mentioned as counsel in the court of requests in the 1550s. He became a member of parliament in 1554 and served (for four different constituencies) in seven parliaments between then and 1572. On 6 September 1558 he was appointed deputy chief steward of the duchy of Lancaster, for the northern parts, and on 9 December 1558 the new queen appointed him a master of requests, which was followed by the stewardship of the Marshalsea. At about the same time he was added to the commissions of the peace for Middlesex and Suffolk, and he was also put on the high commission for ecclesiastical causes. Indeed, he became an indefatigable administrator, arbitrator, interrogator, and commissioner in all kinds of business.<br>
<br>Rather late in life, in 1567, Seckford married Elizabeth, daughter of Thomas Harlow and widow successively of William Billingsley and Sir Martin Bowes (<i>d</i>. 1566); she predeceased him in 1586. In 1579 he acquired another lucrative office, as general surveyor of the court of wards and liveries under Burghley's mastership. In that capacity he became involved with the cartographer Christopher Saxton, whom he employed at his own expense to prepare between 1573 and 1579 the celebrated county maps, which bear Seckford's arms. They were the first of their kind. He also assisted William Harrison in his description of Britain, and Harrison dedicated to him his &#145;Description of Scotland&#146; in Holinshed's <span class="italic">Chronicles</span>. It was no doubt through his offices and his land dealings that he acquired his considerable fortune, which he used in building the Great House (or Seckford House) in St Matthew's parish, Ipswich, and two houses in Clerkenwell, Middlesex, one of them next to St John's Priory. He bought the dissolved priory of Felixstowe, and owned various manors and lands in Suffolk. After his wife's death, without children, he made the plans for founding the Seckford Almshouse for thirteen poor men at Woodbridge, Suffolk, which was supported by the revenue from the Clerkenwell properties; the trustees were, in addition, to make grants to Woodbridge School. Seckford was also responsible, as steward of the liberty of St Etheldreda, for building the new sessions house in Woodbridge, which is now part of the shire hall and still displays his arms. He died at Clerkenwell on 19 December 1587 and, after a temporary burial at Clerkenwell, was reinterred in the family vault at Woodbridge. The plain tomb, without inscription, which he had built before his death in the north aisle, was broken up in 1839.<br>
