<span class="headword">Jackson,  John</span>  (1881&#150;1952), <span class="occ">classical scholar</span>, was born at Great Asby in Westmorland on 17 October 1881, the first son of Robert Jackson, farmer, and his wife, Elizabeth Austin. He was educated at Appleby grammar school and in 1899 matriculated as a Hastings exhibitioner at Queen's College, Oxford, where the tutors included Albert Curtis Clark and Thomas William Allen. A first class in classical honour moderations (1901) was followed by a third in Greats (1903), but he won the Ireland scholarship in 1901 and was elected Craven fellow in 1903. His lack of success in finals did not prevent him from being elected to a fellowship at Magdalen College in 1903; the competition was stiff, as the other candidates included Alexander Dunlop Lindsay. However, his career did not develop as expected, since he vacated his fellowship at the end of his probationary year. From the notebooks of the president, Herbert Warren, it appears that Jackson's behaviour had caused unfavourable comment, leading to a complaint by the college staff to the president, who issued a warning to Jackson, evidently without achieving the desired effect.<br>
<br>Jackson's fellowship was not confirmed and he went to live on the family farm at Caldbeck in Cumberland, where he spent almost all the rest of his life. Although most of his energy was devoted to the farm, and he lacked access to a library, his publications were substantial. They included expert translations of Latin and Greek authors&#151;the <span class="italic">Annals</span> of Tacitus in the <span class="roman">Loeb Classical Library</span> was particularly well received&#151;and articles in the learned journals on the textual criticism of a wide range of Greek authors. His most important work is a posthumous publication which saw the light of day largely thanks to the efforts of Eduard Fraenkel, <span class="italic">Marginalia scaenica</span>, issued by the Oxford Press in 1955. It contains numerous discussions of difficult passages in Greek tragedy and Aristophanes, and proves that Jackson was a textual critic of the highest order, who would certainly have made an even greater name for himself had he been able to follow a more normal career. He died at the Royal Infirmary, Sheffield, of peritonitis on 20 November 1952, and his ashes were interred at Caldbeck.<br>
