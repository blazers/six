<span class="headword">Flackes,  William David</span>  (1921&#150;1993), <span class="occ">journalist</span>, was born on 14 March 1921 at Bogay, All Saints, near Burt, co. Donegal, the eldest of the three children of William David Flackes, coachman, motor mechanic, and gardener, and his wife, Kathleen Jane, <i>n&eacute;e</i> McGarvey. Soon after his birth the family moved to Jordanstown, near Belfast, where Flackes attended Whiteabbey public elementary school. At Belfast Technical College he studied bookkeeping and electrical engineering, and then worked as a telephone engineer. For a journalist this was an unusual start, but he was soon contributing to several local newspapers, and in 1942 he edited a <span class="italic">Whiteabbey and District Year Book</span>. There followed a succession of reporting jobs with local Ulster papers, until in 1945 he joined the <span class="italic">Belfast News-Letter</span>, Northern Ireland's main Unionist newspaper, for which he covered parliamentary debates at Stormont. In 1946 he published (with Michael McGill) a biography of Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery.<br>
<br>In 1947 Flackes joined the Press Association's parliamentary staff at Westminster, remaining there until 1957. He mastered an idiosyncratic shorthand&#151;200 words a minute was occasionally required&#151;became an addict of the political process and its personalities, and wrote works of science fiction under pseudonyms including Vektis Brack. In 1957 he returned to Northern Ireland at John Sayers's invitation as news editor, and later chief leader writer, of the <span class="italic">Belfast Telegraph</span>. He also wrote a biography of Viscount Brookeborough, <span class="italic">The Enduring Premier</span> (1962), and began contributing political commentaries to UTV, the new commercial television station in Belfast. Meanwhile, on 29 December 1948 he had married Mary Dougan (<i>b</i>. 1923/4), daughter of James Dougan, breadserver, of Armagh. They had one daughter.<br>
<br>In 1964 Flackes became (almost inevitably) the BBC's first Northern Ireland political correspondent. At the time this appointment had only local significance, but from 1966, and much more after 1968, Flackes became the daily face of BBC reporting from a province which had declined into political turmoil and terrorist violence, and which from 1972 had a direct UK government presence and a constant stream of more or less unsuccessful political initiatives. For years at a time Flackes was kept close to the radio and television studios in Belfast, and increasingly in London. His strong Ulster accent, his machine-gun speed of delivery, his zest, his stamina, and his capacity for simple exposition of developments in a very complex situation made him a familiar national, indeed international figure. (Once when he and his wife had managed a holiday to Leningrad he was actually recognized and addressed by a passer-by.) His journalism succeeded because it was very factual. He did not come between his story and the listener, nor push a particular political line, if indeed he ever had one. To a remarkable extent he was trusted by politicians of all shades to keep confidences and report fairly.<br>
<br>In 1980 Flackes published the first edition of <span class="italic">Northern Ireland: a Political Directory</span>. This at once established itself as a reliable guide, described by <span class="italic">The Times</span> as &#145;a unique compendium of Ulster's Byzantine politics&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 4 Aug 1993). It grew in successive editions, latterly in collaboration with Sydney Elliott. In 1981 he was made an OBE and in 1982 he retired from the BBC. In retirement he served on the board of RTE (the Republic of Ireland's broadcasting service), expanded the <span class="italic">Political Directory</span>, and continued broadcasting, including contributions to the &#145;History Makers&#146; series on Radio Ulster.<br>
<br>&#145;Billy&#146; Flackes was a small man of plain habits, solidly built but not a pound overweight; a non-smoker who never took more than one gin and tonic before lunch. He never walked when he could run. His stamina was legendary, as were his enthusiasm and affability. When he entered a room his presence was instantly felt.<br>
<br>Flackes developed motor neurone disease in 1993 and died at the Royal Victoria Hospital, Belfast, on 1 August 1993, following a stroke. He was a member of the Presbyterian Church in Ireland and was buried on 3 August 1993 at Lisburn new cemetery, Blaris. There was a memorial service at St Anne's Cathedral, Belfast, on 22 November 1993. He was survived by his wife, Mary, and their daughter.<br>
