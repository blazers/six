<span class="headword">Badeley,  Henry John Fanshawe</span>, Baron Badeley  (1874&#150;1951), <span class="occ">civil servant and engraver</span>, was born at Elswick, Newcastle upon Tyne, on 27 June 1874, the elder child and only son of Captain Henry Badeley (1842&#150;1881), of Guy Harlings, Chelmsford, and his wife, Blanche (<i>d</i>. 1929), daughter of Christian Augustus Henry Allhusen of Elswick Hall and of Stoke Court, Stoke Poges. He was educated at Radley College and Trinity College, Oxford. A small energetic figure, he represented Oxford against Cambridge in athletics in the years 1895 to 1897, running in the quarter mile. He was also an accomplished oarsman, although golf remained his favourite form of relaxation. In 1902 he sold Guy Harlings, the family estate which he had inherited from his father.<br>
<br>In 1897 Badeley won first place in a civil service competition for a clerkship in the parliament office and left Oxford without taking a degree. His career was remarkable for its loyalty to, and affection for, the institution which he served. He developed an interest in matters parliamentary, legal, and heraldic. After studying under Frank Short at the Royal College of Art he was elected an associate of the Royal Society of Painter-Etchers and Engravers, and was almost at once appointed honorary secretary (1911&#150;21). In 1914 he was elected a fellow and exhibited regularly until his death. His combined interest in heraldry and line engraving turned his talent for the latter towards the engraving of bookplates. His work in this field became widely known and he executed commissions for a large number of individuals and institutions, which included plates for the library of the House of Lords.<br>
<br>In 1919 Badeley became principal clerk of the judicial office and judicial taxing officer of the House of Lords. Here his energy and capacity for making personal contacts soon enabled him to break through formalities, and he became the adviser both of the lord chancellor of the day and of the law lords, as well as of all those members of the legal profession whose business brought them to the house.<br>
<br>The turning point of Badeley's career came in 1930 when he was appointed clerk assistant of the parliaments, while retaining the principal judicial clerkship. This was the first known promotion to the table of the House of Lords from the staff of the parliament office, and it opened for Badeley himself and for his successors an avenue to the top of their profession. Badeley reached this pinnacle in four years, becoming clerk of the parliaments in 1934. He was clearly suited for this office, although his qualifications differed somewhat from those of his predecessors. His strength lay in the force of his personality, coupled with a quick intelligence and a broad practical knowledge of parliamentary affairs.<br>
<br>Badeley was appointed KCB in 1935. He had also been made CBE in 1920 for his work as county director of auxiliary hospitals and Voluntary Aid Detachments in the county of London (1917&#150;19). From 1919 to 1923 he was president of the county of London branch of the British Red Cross Society.<br>
<br>On reaching the age of seventy in 1944 Badeley was due to retire, but he was granted by the crown an extension of five years. When this final term of service was completed he was created, in 1949, a member of the house he had served so well with the title of Baron Badeley of Badley in the county of Suffolk. Badeley took a devout interest in religious questions, and held pronounced Anglo-Catholic views. He was uncompromising in his attachment to his religious beliefs, and this formed a side of his character that was unsuspected by those who knew him on casual acquaintance only. In 1948 he was made an honorary fellow of Trinity College, Oxford. Badeley died at 35 Weymouth Street, London, on 27 September 1951. He was unmarried and the peerage became extinct.<br>
