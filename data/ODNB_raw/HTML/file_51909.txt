<span class="headword">Feldberg,  Wilhelm Siegmund</span>  (1900&#150;1993), <span class="occ">pharmacologist and physiologist</span>, was born on 19 November 1900 in Hamburg, the third child of (Emil) Daniel Feldberg (<i>d</i>. 1914), draper, and his wife, Amilie, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Bacharach (<i>d</i>. 1928). His older sister, Lore (<i>b</i>. 1895), died in London in 1965; his brother, Alexander (<i>b</i>. 1899), emigrated to Paraguay and Argentina. The Feldberg family was Jewish and well-to-do. His father and uncle Solly founded a shop selling women's clothing and later owned several stores in Hamburg.<br>
<br>Feldberg graduated from the Heinrich Hertz <i>Realgymnasium</i> in Hamburg in May 1918. From June 1918 he served as a private in the machine-gun company of the 76th infantry regiment of the German army, until the revolution in November. He started his medical studies in Hamburg and Heidelberg and after completing his preclinical period went to Munich and Berlin. He qualified in medicine in Munich in 1923. He then spent six months in the Physiological Institute of the University of Berlin and six months in the medical university clinic at the Charit&eacute;. He received his MD from the University of Berlin in 1925, having presented a thesis: &#145;The action of adrenalin on the sweat glands of the horse&#146;. The same year he married Katherine Scheffler (1897&#150;1976), daughter of the art historian Karl Scheffler. She was a chemist trained at the Technische Hochschule in Berlin. They had two children: Lore, a paediatric cardiologist, and (Karl) Johann David, a maker of harpsichords.<br>
<br>As a medical student in Berlin Feldberg had worked in the vacation with his physiology professor, E. Schilf, who had translated John Newport Langley's book <span class="italic">The Autonomic Nervous System</span> (1921) into German. After graduation in 1925 Feldberg joined Langley and Joseph Barcroft in Cambridge. Alas, Langley died the following year, but Feldberg was able to join Henry Dale at the famous laboratory F4 in the National Institute for Medical Research in Hampstead. In 1927 he returned to the Physiological Institute in Berlin as an <i>Assistent</i>. He passed his <i>Habilitation</i> to become a <i>Privatdozent</i> in 1930 in the institute, which was then directed by Professor W. Trendelenburg, with a thesis, &#145;The bloodflow in the veins during circulatory failure&#146;.<br>
<br>In May 1933 Feldberg was called into the director's office and told that as he was a non-Aryan the Prussian ministry for science required that he should be dismissed with immediate effect; a request from the dean and the head of department that he should be allowed to finish the work he had in progress was denied. In June he was allowed leave for one month to visit Dale in London. As a result, at Dale's invitation and with a grant from the Rockefeller Foundation, he was able to return to Hampstead in September 1933. With a grant from the Carnegie Foundation he spent 1936&#150;8 with Charles Kellaway at the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute in Melbourne, Australia. In 1938 he came back to England as Rockefeller lecturer in physiology at the University of Cambridge. He was promoted reader in physiology in 1947. In 1949 he returned to the National Institute for Medical Research (by then translated to Mill Hill) as head of the division of physiology and pharmacology. He retired from this post in 1965 but continued to work at Mill Hill until 1990, when he was forced finally to give up his scientific work as a consequence of attacks by anti-vivisectionists. In 1961 his appointment in Berlin was restored and he received restitution payment of back salary and continuing salary and pension rights. He used this to set up a foundation under German law, the Feldberg Foundation for German-English Exchange for Experimental Medical Research (Austausch f&uuml;r Experimentelle Medizinsche Forschung, Hamburg). This body has joint British and German members and has arranged annual visits of distinguished scientists between the two countries since 1961.<br>
<br>Feldberg's major scientific contributions were the establishment of acetylcholine as a chemical transmitter in the nervous system, and the pharmacology of histamine. The first areas for which the transmitter role of acetylcholine was established were at autonomic endings; some of these were unexpected, such as sweat glands, which Feldberg showed were cholinergic even though they were anatomically sympathetic. With Lindor Brown he extended the concept to autonomic ganglia by showing release of acetylcholine when the preganglionic nerves were stimulated, as well as the sensitivity of the ganglion cells to acetylcholine; this met with the opposition of many neurophysiologists who believed that transmission across these synapses was due to circulating currents. Next he produced evidence with Dale and Brown for cholinergic transmission at the neuromuscular junction and finally for a variety of functional areas in the central nervous system. These discoveries involved devising methods for identifying the release of acetylcholine when the nerves were stimulated, for delivering acetylcholine rapidly close to its postulated site of action, and showing that acetylcholine was synthesized in the neurones and was rapidly removed after release by being broken down by cholinesterase. Notably with T. Mann he developed the acetone powder, cell free system for acetylcholine synthesis. He mapped the distribution of acetylcholine, the acetylase, and cholinesterase in the nervous system, and reached the conclusion that acetylcholine had a function on many but not all neurones. During the Second World War, with Edgar Douglas Adrian and B. A. Kilby, he identified the mode of action of the poisonous organophosphorus compounds, DFP and Parathion, produced in Germany as insecticides and possible war gases, and showed that they were potent inhibitors of cholinesterase. Much of his later work was concerned with investigations of the activity of the cholinergic system in identified areas and functions of the central nervous system by local application of drugs to defined areas. In the course of this work he uncovered a number of interesting activities of acetylcholine on temperature control, the regulation of blood pressure and the level of blood sugar, and the release of the hormones of the posterior lobe of the pituitary gland. In short, Feldberg was a founding father of neuropharmacology.<br>
<br>Feldberg's second major area of research was on histamine, a subject which had also been initiated by Dale, who had suggested its role in anaphylaxis. His initial work was on the circulatory effects, where it caused capillary dilatation but arteriolar constriction. On his return to Berlin he concentrated on anaphylaxis in the lung and was able to show the release of a substance from the perfused lung identifiable by bioassay as histamine. With Schilf he published an authoritative monograph, <span class="italic">Histamin, seine Pharmakologie und Bedeutung f&uuml;r die humorale Physiologie</span> (1930). Later, with Kellaway, he showed histamine to be released by snake venoms, and with N. Emmelin he showed that histamine was a component of nettle stings, along with acetylcholine and 5-hydroxytryptamine.<br>
<br>During his second Cambridge period Feldberg was an enthusiastic and much appreciated teacher of students; his part two lecture-demonstrations were particularly popular and it was rare if his presentations did not offer some humorous stories as well as showing his profound knowledge of the relevant science. He worked very intensively and was a prolific author, producing some 350 papers over sixty-five years.<br>
<br>Feldberg was a warm and friendly person, especially concerned with the welfare of his younger colleagues. His house, Lavenham, was a place of hospitality where music and fine German wines were offered in a room enriched with lithographs by Toulouse-Lautrec. His work was recognized by the award of some ten honorary degrees; his appointment as fellow of the Royal Society (1947), CBE (1963), and fellow of the Royal College of Physicians of London (1978); and the award of a grand cross, order of merit of the Federal Republic of Germany (1961).<br>
<br>Feldberg's first wife, Katherine, died in 1976. On 28 September 1977 he married Kathleen Marguerite (Kim) O'Rourke (<i>b</i>. 1924/5), daughter of Charles John Alfred O'Rourke, a regimental sergeant-major in the Royal Artillery. She had for many years been his secretary at Mill Hill. She died in 1981. Feldberg himself died at his home, Lavenham, 74 Marsh Lane, Mill Hill, London, of old age, on 23 October 1993. He was survived by his daughter, Lore, his son having predeceased him.<br>
