<span class="headword">Marsh,  Richard</span> <span class="st"> [Richard  de Marisco]</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1226), <span class="occ">administrator and bishop of Durham</span>, was of unknown origins. The fact that he was styled <i>magister</i> indicates that he attended a university, but it is not known where. He first appears in royal records in 1196/7, when he accounted for the issues of the vacant bishopric of Durham on behalf of the appointed custodians, Gilbert fitz Reinfrey and Richard Brewer. In that same year he also paid into the treasury two large sums on behalf of Archbishop Hubert Walter. It appears, therefore, that he was already developing the expertise in financial administration that would characterize his later career. Under King John, Marsh became first a chamber clerk (by 1207), and then, from 1209, senior chancery clerk, with occasional custody of the great seal. He continued as clerk of the chamber, however, until 29 October 1214, when he was appointed chancellor. Yet even as chancellor Marsh continued to be closely involved with both the chamber and the exchequer until 1217, when he left the court to become bishop of Durham. Although Marsh remained titular chancellor until his death in 1226, from November 1218 it was Ralph de Neville who, as keeper of the new king's seal, performed the day-to-day functions of the chancellor's office.<br>
<br>Like most of John's clerical administrators, Marsh remained at the king's side throughout the interdict, and was rewarded for his loyalty with a series of ecclesiastical positions and promotions. In 1209 he became canon of Exeter and rector of Bampton, Oxfordshire; in 1212 he was appointed to the vicarage at Kempsey, Worcestershire. By November 1211 he was archdeacon of Northumberland, and in February 1213 he became archdeacon of Richmond, offices he held concurrently until his appointment as bishop of Durham in 1217.<br>
<br>There is no doubt of Marsh's influence with King John. Along with William Brewer, Robert of Thornham, and Reginald of Cornhill, he was named specifically as one of the &#145;evil counsellors&#146; who encouraged John's exactions from the Cistercian order in 1210. He was named again among the king's most influential advisers in 1211. During Michaelmas term 1212, when rumours of incipient rebellion reached the king, it was Marsh whom John sent to supervise the exchequer. During this same year he also served as sheriff of Somerset and Dorset, yet another sign of the trust the king reposed in him. Years later a monk of St Albans reported a dream in which King John appeared before him, lamenting the sins that Richard Marsh had encouraged him to commit against the church during the interdict.<br>
<br>When the interdict was finally lifted, Archbishop Stephen Langton threatened Marsh with suspension from his ecclesiastical benefices. In August 1213 Marsh went personally to Rome to explain himself to the pope, and also to negotiate on the king's behalf the final terms for ending the interdict. He succeeded on both counts. In February 1214 he left Rome with letters of special papal protection for all his ecclesiastical benefices, and with the terms for ending the interdict substantially modified in the king's favour.<br>
<br>Upon his return from Rome Marsh quickly resumed his administrative duties at court. He went first to Poitou, where he assisted in organizing John's military campaign of 1214. During this time, between April and June 1214, John attempted to have him elected bishop of Winchester in succession to Peter des Roches, whom the king hoped to postulate to York. Nothing came of this scheme, however, and by June 1214 Marsh was back in England, advising on the munitioning of castles, and compelling monastic houses to seal blank charters surrendering their claims to compensation for their losses during the interdict. Marsh was also active during these years in pressing the king's candidates upon monastic electors, most famously in the disputed election of Hugh of Northwold to the abbacy of Bury St Edmunds. In October 1214 John appointed Marsh chancellor, official confirmation of the position he had already attained as one of the principal men upon whom the king relied in governing England.<br>
<br>Marsh remained a loyal supporter of King John throughout the <span class="roman">Magna Carta</span> rebellion. In August 1215 he was in Poitou, attempting to raise troops for John's service. In September he went on another mission to Rome, where he secured the suspension of Archbishop Langton. After John's death, Marsh continued as chancellor in the new regency government, and in this capacity sealed the November 1217 version of <span class="roman">Magna Carta</span>. By this date, however, he had already become bishop of Durham. Appointed in May 1217 by the legate Guala, with the support of Pope Honorius III (<i>r</i>. 1216&#150;27), Marsh was consecrated at Gloucester on 2 July 1217 by Archbishop Walter de Gray of York. From that date on he spent most of his time in his northern diocese. Marsh remained in close touch with the royal government, however, acting as a diplomatic intermediary with the king of Scotland and serving, from December 1218 to April 1219, as justice on eyre in Yorkshire and Northumberland. He remained, at least formally, a member of the royal council, and he continued to insist upon his dignity as chancellor, angrily rejecting Ralph de Neville's claims to be officially the vice-chancellor.<br>
<br>As bishop of Durham, Marsh was engaged in almost constant conflict, first with Philip of Oldcotes, the wartime custodian of the vacant bishopric, and then with the prior and convent of Durham over the proper division of revenues between priory and bishop. Marsh's methods in pursuing these conflicts were brutal. Oldcotes's estates were attacked, his houses burnt, and his men imprisoned. The monks of Durham accused Marsh before the pope of bloodshed, adultery, simony, robbery, and sacrilege, and complained to the king that he was violating their rights under <span class="roman">Magna Carta</span>. The pope ordered the bishops of Salisbury and Ely to investigate the charges against him, but Marsh appealed to Rome, and after great expense to all parties the case was remanded to England for a hearing at London. It was on his journey south to attend this hearing that Marsh died in his sleep, without warning, at Peterborough Abbey on 1 May 1226, leaving behind him a heavy burden of indebtedness upon both priory and bishopric, and a personal reputation for heavy drinking. His heir was his nephew <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/95/', "Adam Marsh")</script>, subsequently a notable theologian, to whom he bequeathed his library.<br>
