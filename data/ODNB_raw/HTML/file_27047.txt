<span class="headword">Taylor,  John</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1704, <em>d.</em> 1766), <span class="occ">classical scholar and Church of England clergyman</span>, was baptized on 22 June 1704 at St Alkmund's Church in Shrewsbury, where his father, John Taylor, was a barber. He was educated under Richard Lloyd at Shrewsbury School, where his grandfather John Taylor (<i>bap</i>. 1629, <i>d</i>. 1688) had been third master from 1659 to 1688. A bookish boy, he was noticed by one of his father's customers, Edward Owen of Condover, who decided to fund his education at university. On 7 June 1721 he was admitted a sizar at his grandfather's college&#151;St John's, Cambridge&#151;whence he graduated BA in 1725 and proceeded MA in 1728. He became a fellow and tutor of his college in 1726. In 1730 he delivered the Latin oration in Great St Mary's Church on the anniversary of Charles I's execution, and the music speech at the public commencement in July; both were published. In March 1732 he was appointed university librarian, an office that he exchanged for that of registrar in 1734.<br>
<br>Taylor, who shared his family's tory allegiance, had found himself increasingly at odds with his patron's Jacobitism, and broke with Owen when he refused to join in a Jacobite toast, thus dashing his hopes of benefiting from the considerable church preferment at Owen's disposal. Taylor therefore concentrated on establishing his reputation as a classicist. In 1732 he issued the prospectus for a new edition of Lysias, which appeared in 1739. In the following year he took the degree of LLD, and in 1741 he published an edition of <span class="italic">Demosthenes contra Leptinem</span>, which he intended as a specimen of a projected complete edition of Demosthenes and Aeschines. He published the third volume of the work in 1748 and the second in 1757, but he failed to complete the first volume, which is represented only by the notes that Anthony Askew gave to Johann Jacob Reiske. He henceforth was known as Demosthenes Taylor.<br>
<br>A scholar not only of Greek oratory but also of Greek law, it is unsurprising that Taylor turned to the law as an alternative career to the church. He was admitted to Doctors' Commons in 1742 and began to practise in the court of arches as an advocate later in that year. About this time he gained the favour of a valuable patron, Lord Carteret (later Lord Granville), who in 1742 seems to have considered making Taylor his under-secretary of state. Instead Taylor was appointed chancellor of the diocese of Lincoln in 1744, having been introduced to the bishop, Dr John Thomas, by Carteret. He remained in office until 1766.<br>
<br>Taylor returned to his first choice of career&#151;the church&#151;when he was ordained deacon and priest in September 1747 at Lincoln, resigning from Doctors' Commons that year. He received the college living of Lawford, Essex, in April 1751 and became archdeacon of Buckingham in January 1753; he resigned as registrar of Cambridge University in 1751. In 1752&#150;3 he tutored Granville's grandsons the third Viscount Weymouth (1734&#150;1796) and Henry Frederick Thynne (1735&#150;1796) while they were undergraduates at St John's College, Cambridge. In response to Granville's request that his grandsons received a thorough grounding in the principles of civil law Taylor drew up extensive notes on the subject, amply illustrated by quotations from classical texts. These notes were published as <span class="italic">Elements of the Civil Law</span> (1755; 2nd edn, 1769) and in an abridged version as <span class="italic">Summary of the Roman Law</span> (1773). His account of the persecution of the early Christians was severely attacked by William Warburton, who took great offence when Taylor reportedly declared that Warburton was &#145;no scholar&#146;. Taylor also contributed to the second edition of John Foster's <span class="italic">Essay on the Different Nature of Accent and Quantity</span> (1763) and began an appendix to Suidas.<br>
<br>In July 1757 Taylor was appointed a canon residentiary of St Paul's Cathedral, once again thanks to the good offices of Granville. He moved to London, where he took part in the learned societies; elected fellow of the Royal Society and of the Society of Antiquaries, he contributed to the transactions of the former and served as director and vice-president of the latter. He died at his house in Amen Corner, Paternoster Row, on 4 April 1766 and was buried in the vault under St Paul's Cathedral. He bequeathed his extensive library to his old school, which could then boast of having the best school library after Eton College, and a fund to found an exhibition at St John's. His manuscripts and annotated books were left to Anthony Askew, his executor, most of which are now in the Bodleian Library, Cambridge University Library, and the British Library.<br>
