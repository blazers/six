<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Morrison,  Arthur George</span>  (1863&#150;1945), <span class="occ">writer and novelist</span>, was born at 14 John Street, Poplar, in the East End of London, on 1 November 1863, one of the three children of George Richard Morrison (<i>d</i>. 1871), an engine fitter in the docks, and his wife, Jane, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Cooper. These details about his birth conflict with the biographical details that Morrison himself later supplied&#151;he maintained that he had been born in Kent, the son of a &#145;professional man&#146;, and had been educated at private schools. These details are only the first of the false trails that Morrison laid for future scholars, in a largely successful attempt to conceal the extent of his working-class origins from his contemporaries.<br>
<br>Little is known about Morrison's childhood or education, but he probably spent most of his adolescence in the East End; in 1879 he worked as an office boy at the architect's department of the London school board, where he earned 7<i>s</i>. a week. A year later his mother took over a haberdasher's shop in Grundy Street, and it was at about this time that Morrison began submitting comic verse to the magazine <span class="italic">Cycling</span>. He became involved in boxing and cycling, and contributed to various cycling journals. His first serious journalism, however, was published in <span class="italic">The Globe</span> in 1885. A year later, at twenty-three, he was working as a clerk to the Beaumont Trustees, a charitable trust that administered the People's Palace, in Mile End, in the East End of London. The People's Palace was designed as an educational and cultural centre for the community, and consisted of the Queen's Hall, a library, a swimming bath, a gymnasium, and a winter garden as well as schools. Lectures and exhibitions were held at the palace, in addition to concerts and recitals. Morrison became sub-editor of the house paper, the <span class="italic">Palace Journal</span>, and reprinted in it pieces that he had already published as Cockney Corners in <span class="italic">The People</span>. It was Morrison's work with the People's Palace that later allowed him to describe his previous employment as &#145;the secretary of an old Charity Trust&#146; or a &#145;civil servant&#146;, &#145;both of which terms are half-truths calculated to add social respectability to the post he actually held&#146;  (Keating, &#145;Biographical study&#146;, 11). And yet this post was also useful in defending the realism of Morrison's depiction of the East End in his novels, as it meant that he could disguise his personal and autobiographical connections to the slums; he could subsume them by references to his professional connection.<br>
<br>Morrison left the People's Palace at the end of September 1890, and joined the editorial staff of the evening <span class="italic">Globe</span>. He also freelanced, and in 1891 published his first book, <span class="italic">The Shadows around Us</span>, a collection of supernatural tales originally printed in <span class="italic">The People</span>. More significantly, however, in October 1891 he contributed a story called &#145;A Street&#146; to <span class="italic">Macmillan's</span>. Its conciseness and distinct lack of sentimentality in its portrayal of the East End were praised, and its positive reception encouraged Morrison over the next year to submit fourteen tales in a similar vein to his friend W. E. Henley, editor of the <span class="italic">National Observer</span>. On 22 August 1892 Morrison married Eliza Adelaide (Elizabeth) Thatcher (1864/5&#150;1956) at Forest Gate; they lived at Chingford, and then at Salcombe House, Loughton, Essex. In 1893 they had a son, Guy (<i>d</i>. 1921). A year later Morrison collected and reprinted the East End tales, and published them as <span class="italic">Tales of Mean Streets</span> (1894), dedicated to Henley, their first publisher. While the volume was a success, running into several editions, and prompting a great deal of discussion about new developments in English realism, many of the reviews focused on the violence of one tale in particular, &#145;Lizerunt&#146;, and there was a backlash. The book was removed from Clerkenwell Library by local authorities, and W. H. Smith temporarily refused to supply it to circulating libraries.<br>
<br>Although angry at the negative characterization of the collection based on only one of its tales, Morrison went on to write next the novel for which he is most famous: <span class="italic">A Child of the Jago</span> (1896), the violence of which led to similar critical charges. Not content to base his work solely on his own experience of the East End, Morrison did a significant amount of research in the parish of the Revd A. Osborne Jay, vicar of Holy Trinity, Shoreditch, and author of <span class="italic">Life in Darkest London</span> (1891) and <span class="italic">The Social Problem: its Possible Solution</span> (1893). Jay had written to Morrison after reading <span class="italic">Tales of Mean Streets</span>, praising it but pointing out that monotony and attempted respectability were certainly not features of his own parish, which demonstrated problems more akin to those of the alcoholism, domestic violence, and crime portrayed in &#145;Lizerunt&#146;. The impact of his visit to Jay's parish led Morrison to a determination to write a novel in which &#145;I should tell the story of a boy who, but for his environment, would have become a good citizen&#146;  (Keating, &#145;Biographical study&#146;, 23). The novel is a powerful evocation of life in an east London slum, with extreme violence, crime, riots, and an absolute sense of the impossibility of escape for its inhabitants. The novel is indebted to <span class="italic">Oliver Twist</span>, and yet represents a darker vision of themes and characters presented in that novel&#151;Dicky Perrott, the &#145;child of the Jago&#146;, is not rescued by providence or by the discovery of providentially rich relatives; he instead is a &#145;Jago rat&#146;, unredeemed and dying at the end of the book, with his last breath adhering to the Jago code, and refusing to &#145;nark&#146; on the boy who has killed him. In this vision of the slum, death represents the only &#145;'nother way out&#151;better&#146; for this anti-Oliver of the late nineteenth century  (Morrison, <span class="italic">A Child of the Jago</span>, ed. Miles, 173).<br>
<br>The book came in for a great deal of criticism, much of it focusing on the naturalistic handling of violence and slum life. <span class="italic">A Child of the Jago</span> became a document in the debate over the nature and merits of late Victorian realism, and one of the most vehement criticisms was found in H. D. Traill's article in the <span class="italic">Fortnightly Review</span> (67, 1897, 63&#150;73), in which he both doubted the veracity of Morrison's observations and took issue with his method of presentation. Morrison felt it necessary to answer the charges of such an eminent critic personally, and his reply was to form the preface to the third edition of <span class="italic">A Child of the Jago</span>, in which Morrison maintained the right of the author to present scenes of ugliness and, indeed, stated that such a right was also a duty: &#145;If the community have left horrible places and horrible lives before his eyes, then the fault is the community's; and to picture these places and these lives becomes not merely his privilege, but his duty&#146;  (Morrison, <span class="italic">A Child of the Jago</span>, ed. Miles, 5).<br>
<br>Morrison went on to write another novel set in the East End, <span class="italic">To London Town</span> (1899), but this had neither the critical nor the popular success of his previous two East End fictions. He also produced a detective novel, <span class="italic">The Dorrington Deed-Box</span> (1897), which complemented his earlier works of detective fiction written in the Conan Doyle vein, which had featured a detective called Martin Hewitt who &#145;shrewdly solved many crimes in a manner that would have done credit to the Great Detective himself&#146;  (<span class="italic">Martin Hewitt: Investigator</span>, new edn, 1971, dust-jacket). A historical novel, <span class="italic">Cunning Murrell</span> (1900), dealing with witchcraft in mid-nineteenth-century Essex, was skilfully written, and <span class="italic">The Hole in the Wall</span> (1902), another East End novel, but this time set in the 1860s and 1870s, represents some of his finest writing. Four more collections of stories followed: <span class="italic">The Red Triangle</span> (1903), <span class="italic">The Green Eye of Goona</span> (1904), <span class="italic">Divers Vanities</span> (1905), and <span class="italic">Green Ginger</span> (1909).<br>
<br>By 1913 Morrison had retired from writing fiction and journalism, and settled down in a house at High Beach, Essex, to devote time to his amateur passion: collecting and studying Chinese and Japanese works of art. He had begun his collection as early as 1890, and in 1902 published a series of articles on the subject in the <span class="italic">Monthly Review</span>. The culmination of his work in this area was his two-volume <span class="italic">The Painters of Japan</span> (1911), largely illustrated from his own collection. Two years later Sir Watkin Gwynne purchased the bulk of his Chinese and Japanese prints, and presented them to the British Museum, where they were the subject of a catalogue and placed on public exhibition in 1914.<br>
<br>During the First World War, Morrison's son, Guy, served in the army, and Morrison himself served in the Essex special constabulary; in this capacity he had the distinction of phoning in the news of the first Zeppelin raid on London. After the war the Morrisons moved to Cavendish Square, London, where in 1921 Guy died of malaria that he had contracted while on active duty. Almost as little is known of Morrison's later life as is known of his early life. In 1924 he was made a member of the Royal Society of Literature, and in 1930 he moved to High Barn, Amersham Road, Chalfont St Peter, Buckinghamshire, where he lived quietly until his death fifteen years later. He was a freemason and a member of the Japanese Art Association. Arthur Morrison died at High Barn on 4 December 1945, a wealthy but little-known figure. After his death his wife, acting on his instructions, sold his library and burnt all his papers apart from the manuscript of <span class="italic">A Child of the Jago</span>, which he had presented to the Bethnal Green Library in 1936. A collection of 140 Japanese paintings and woodcuts and a collection of tea ceremony porcelain was bequeathed to the British Museum.<br>
<br>At the time of his death Morrison had slipped into relative literary obscurity: as J. Bell wrote, Morrison &#145;was one of those contemporary bestsellers who could be found on every Edwardian bookshelf, but who vanished in the Great War and were unknown to the new and changed generation which followed&#146;  (Miles, xxvi). V. S. Pritchett, however, wrote an enthusiastic article, &#145;An East End novelist&#146;, in the <span class="italic">New Statesman</span> in 1944 which inspired a slight revival of interest in his work, and <span class="italic">A Child of the Jago</span> has attracted a great deal of late twentieth- and early twenty-first-century critical and popular attention, as its uncompromising view of late nineteenth-century slum life continues to strike a chord. An opera by Shirley Thompson, based on the novel, was staged at the Royal Festival Hall, London, in 1997.<br>
