<span class="headword">Disbrowe <span class="st"> [Desborough]</span>,  John</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1608, <em>d.</em> 1680), <span class="occ">parliamentarian army officer and politician</span>, was baptized at Eltisley, Cambridgeshire, on 13 November 1608, the second son of James Disbrowe (1582&#150;1638) and his wife, Elizabeth Marshall (<i>d</i>. 1628/9). His brother was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7543/', "Samuel Desborough [Disbrowe]")</script>, politician and administrator. Their father was a gentleman and owner of the advowson of Eltisley, where the family had lived for at least three generations, and at the time of John's birth was living in the parsonage house. <br>
<br>Although he did not attend either English university or any of the London inns of court, Disbrowe is said to have practised as an attorney, and combined this with farming an estate worth &pound;70 per annum settled on him by his father. On 23 June 1636 he married Jane Cromwell (<i>bap</i>. 1606, <i>d</i>. 1656). She was the sister of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6765/', "Oliver Cromwell")</script>, who at that time enjoyed no more than local importance, but on the outbreak of the civil war Disbrowe was among the earliest members of his brother-in-law's troop of horse, a unit of the parliamentarian army of the earl of Essex. Disbrowe was quartermaster or adjutant, receiving from as early as September 1642 sums from the treasurer-at-war to pay the soldiers. <h2>
<a name="Armyofficer"></a>Army officer</h2>From April 1643 Disbrowe captained his own troop of horse in Cromwell's regiment. An ordinance of 2 May 1643 named Disbrowe among prominent soldiers of the eastern association empowered to sequester the goods of royalists. It is likely that the high reputation of the regiment for military efficiency and godly commitment attracted recruits from beyond the immediate confines of East Anglia: the minister and commentator Richard Baxter noted that to his knowledge Disbrowe and his men never once fell back before the enemy. After the New Model Army was established Disbrowe became major of the first horse regiment, that of Sir Thomas Fairfax, when Edward Whalley was promoted to command a regiment of his own. On 14 June 1645 Disbrowe saw action at Naseby, where his regiment led the final charge, and his troop was prominent at the battle of Langport on 10 July. On 8 August, Disbrowe was dispatched by Fairfax to quell troublesome &#145;clubmen&#146; at Shaftesbury: leading a charge at Hambledon Hill with spectacular success, he captured their ringleader and took 300 prisoners. From December 1645 he was quartered in Oxfordshire, first taking part in the siege of Oxford, and negotiating the surrender of Woodstock House to parliament on 26 April 1646. <br>
<br>During May 1647 Disbrowe acted as an intermediary between parliament and his regiment, when parliament had resolved on plans to reduce the size of the army and ship certain units to Ireland. He was among the officers chosen to present the grievances of the whole army to parliamentary commissioners. At Saffron Walden church on 16 May, Disbrowe reported to the council of officers that six days earlier, after representing the parliamentary plans to the troops of his regiment, they had convinced him that some of their grievances were &#145;very sober things&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 1.50). He pressed the council of officers to ask the regiment to confirm that these discontents were widespread, evidently in the conviction that they were, and a paper emanating from the regiment confirmed his view. On 2 July, Disbrowe was one of the army officers that met with commissioners of parliament at High Wycombe; at the council of war at Reading the following week he was clearly pressing for the army not to delay in its march on London. Fairfax appointed him to meet with the agitators, representatives of the rank and file, to complete proposals for settling a peace. During the army's advance to the capital Disbrowe was involved in a surprise raid on troops of the presbyterian Robert Pye, at Deptford, and in August he drilled a thousand cavalry in Hyde Park. There is no doubt that he was an Independent in politics, sharing the impatience of many in the New Model with repeated attempts at a compromise settlement with the king. In May 1648 he suppressed a royalist insurrection at Bury St Edmunds, and was among the besieging party at the protracted siege of Colchester. On 15 September, Fairfax appointed Disbrowe governor of Yarmouth, a commission which took him from the centre of events during the political crisis of the winter of 1648&#150;9, and removed him temporarily from a field regiment. <h2>
<a name="Firsttourofthewesterncounties"></a>First tour of the western counties</h2>In September 1649, during the first year of the new republic, Disbrowe was given command of what had been the horse regiment of Oliver Cromwell, assigned to guard the western counties of England. This marked the beginning of Disbrowe's association with the west of England, which persisted for most of the 1650s, and confirmed his closeness to his brother-in-law, the lord general. Disbrowe wrote to Cromwell in September 1650, reminding him of the need for those in public life to heed the voice of God: &#145;Sir, high places are slippery, except God establisheth our goings; he hath been very faithful to us, and I trust will still do us good himself, help us to trust in him, and then, I am sure, we shall not be ashamed&#146;  (Firth and Davies, 1.205). Late in 1649 he quelled a mutiny at Plymouth garrison, but he also gave the charge to the grand jury at the Devon quarter sessions, an indication that he would not confine himself to the military sphere. Disbrowe attempted a reform of public life in the counties of his charge from his first tour, and demonstrated a willingness to work closely and in detail with the justices of the peace and other agents of the traditional structure of local government. By August 1650 he had been given the title major-general. His regiment marched north to participate in the battle of Worcester in September 1651, but moved quickly back to the south-west, in time for the escaping Charles Stuart to pass close to him incognito at Shaftesbury in October. His appointment to the Hale commission on law reform in January 1652 acknowledged the range of his interests in public affairs as well as his original calling, though he himself was no radical reformer. He supported a policy of leniency towards former royalists, enshrined in the Rump's act of oblivion (February 1652), and that summer supported Cromwell in cautioning the army officers against precipitate action against parliament when the pace of reform seemed to have grown slack. After the Rump Parliament was expelled in exasperation by Cromwell in April 1653, Disbrowe defended his own volte-face. His comment on his earlier support for the Rump against the army officers was &#145;if ever he drolled [i.e. jested] in his life, he had drolled then&#146;  (<span class="italic">Memoirs of Edmund Ludlow</span>, 1.356). <h2>
<a name="Highcivilandmilitaryoffice"></a>High civil and military office</h2>Further civil and military commissions now fell to Disbrowe. He was among the appointees to Cromwell's first council of state (29 April 1653), having apparently rejected offers to become general of the army in Scotland. On 5 July he was co-opted to sit in the nominated assembly, and he played an active role in its proceedings. On 28 July he was made a commissioner for the admiralty and navy, and by September he had replaced Edmund Prideaux, attorney-general, as <i>custos rotulorum</i> of Devon. He retained this distinction until 1660. He sat on a parliamentary committee charged with reforming the law, but was no more radical in his outlook there than on the Hale commission, and became identified with the socially conservative element in the house. Nevertheless he continued in office as a judge of probate during this administration, having been appointed in the last month of the Rump's sitting. He came third in the ballot for sixteen places on the new council of state on 1 November; on 3 December was approved by the house as one of the generals-at-sea, and retained his place as an admiralty commissioner. The growing gulf between the radicals and their critics had become unbridgeable, however, and on 12 December he used his prominence in the house on behalf of the conservative majority to play a leading part in the dissolution of the nominated assembly. He was among those who signed the warrant to the lord mayor of London to proclaim Cromwell lord protector. Nearly a year later, on 10 November 1654, he reminded MPs in the first protectorate parliament that the lord protector could have kept all power to himself, and that they should reflect on that before tampering with the &#145;Instrument of government&#146;. <br>
<br>As a relative and close associate of Cromwell's, Disbrowe rose even further in standing during the protectorate, and by 1658 it was reported that public office brought him an annual income of over &pound;6000. On 24 April 1654 he was granted the office of constable of St Briavel's hundred, in the Forest of Dean, which confirmed his policing authority there: during the time of the nominated assembly he had tried to advance the interests of Gloucestershire tobacco planters on the other side of the Severn from the forest. In elections to the first protectorate parliament, which met in September 1654, he was returned for Cambridgeshire, and for two seats in the west country, Somerset and Totnes: he chose to sit for his native county. In October he and William Penn quelled unrest among seamen at Portsmouth, Disbrowe having kept the naval offices bestowed upon him before the protectorate was established. He never served at sea, however, and his contribution to the navy lay in the areas of discipline and logistics. He was the principal organizer of supply to the ill-fated western design, a naval expedition to the West Indies which sailed in December 1654. Even before it left England its leader, Robert Venables, quarrelled with Disbrowe over inadequate supplies, and when it failed disastrously Venables ensured that the general-at-sea received his share of the blame. <h2>
<a name="Amajorgeneral"></a>A major-general</h2>In January 1655 Disbrowe's interventions in parliament were all strongly in support of the lord protector and his executive, and he kept a close eye on home intelligence matters. When, in March, the rebellion in the west country known as Penruddock's rising broke out, Disbrowe was the natural choice to be commissioned to suppress it. A few days later he was also given wide powers of policing in the Isle of Ely in his home region. During this tour of the west he again worked closely with local government. These developments, and Disbrowe's interest in compiling lists of those disaffected to the government, provided a blueprint for what in the summer of that year became the expedient of rule by major-generals. Disbrowe received the first commission of its type on 28 May 1655, gaining the widest civil and military authority in the counties of Gloucester, Somerset, Wiltshire, Dorset, Devon, and Cornwall. He reformed the militia, galvanized justices of the peace into implementing legislation on offences that were abominable to the godly, and did what he could to reform juries. He intervened in the affairs of the corporations of Bristol, Tewkesbury, Gloucester, and Tiverton to remove councillors considered hostile. <br>
<br>Despite his purges of boroughs Disbrowe's style was, overall, not particularly confrontational; he preferred to work with sympathetic figures among the gentry, the &#145;honest people in every county&#146;  (Thurloe, 5.303). He was able to intervene to settle disputes among the clergy, and to support congregations&#151;notably that of the Baptists in Exeter. His sympathies towards protestant minorities seem to have been generally recognized. Although he was expected by some to release the Quakers imprisoned at Launceston he found himself unable to comply because their demeanour, and particularly that of George Fox, convinced him that they would not live peaceably. His reports to John Thurloe reveal his concern to receive the proper authorization for his actions. Nevertheless, despite his sometimes tentative approach to his task, a measure of his achievement is the surviving volume, preserved in the British Library, of names of about 5000 individuals who came to his attention for a variety of negative reasons during his tour of duty. <br>
<br>Like the other major-generals, Disbrowe worked hard to ensure that candidates sympathetic to the government were successful in the parliamentary elections of 1656. He himself was returned for Somerset, Gloucester, King's Lynn, and Bridgwater, choosing to sit for the county. During the protracted debates on the Quaker James Nayler he took a consistent, moderate line, agreeing that his offence was blasphemy, but aware of the constitutional implications for the secular authority of entering the hazardous territory of theological nuances. He opposed the death penalty for Nayler, &#145;for life is precious&#146;  (<span class="italic">Diary of Thomas Burton</span>, 1.39). There is little doubt that Disbrowe was voicing the views of the lord protector on Nayler, but the brothers-in-law by no means spoke with one voice. It was fitting that on Christmas day 1656 Disbrowe, as the pioneer of the major-generals' regime, should promote the continuation of the decimation tax on royalists: &#145;I have a short bill to offer you, for continuance of a tax upon some people, for the maintenance of the militia&#146;  (ibid., 1.230). But to Cromwell's scorn, the bill was rejected and the expedient fell. This was an indication that Disbrowe still kept open channels to the leading army officers, as well as to the Cromwellian household. <br>
<br>A frequent speaker in the second Cromwellian parliament, Disbrowe remained silent in the house during the debates on the <span class="italic">Humble Petition and Advice</span> that would have bestowed the crown on the protector. It is clear that he opposed this development. He and Charles Fleetwood, his fellow grandee in the army, confronted Cromwell, who was attracted to the kingship, with their view that its promoters were royalist fellow-travellers. In one account of this exchange Disbrowe is reported to have viewed it as a watershed in his relations with Cromwell: &#145;though he was resolved never to act against him, yet he would not act for him after that time&#146;  (<span class="italic">Memoirs of Edmund Ludlow</span>, 2.24). It seems likely that Disbrowe's intervention contributed significantly to Cromwell's eventual rejection of the crown, but his loyalties to the protector and to the basic principles of the protectorate ran deep, and he accepted a place in the new second chamber on 11 December 1657 without demur. At the opening of the second session of the parliament on 18 January 1658 Disbrowe carried the sword ahead of the protector in the solemn procession. On 25 March 1658 he married Anne Everard, his first wife, Jane Cromwell, having died in 1656. <h2>
<a name="Thefalloftheprotectorateandtherestorationofmonarchy"></a>The fall of the protectorate and the restoration of monarchy</h2>There were a number of reports that Disbrowe was discussing future constitutional options with army colleagues during 1658, but, on the death of Oliver Cromwell, Disbrowe was at least superficially an enthusiast for the rule of his nephew <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6768/', "Richard Cromwell")</script>. But his feud with Edward Montagu was ominous. Disbrowe and Montagu, a naval administrator and devotee of the protectorate, had been on opposing sides during the kingship debates, and now openly clashed in council, when Disbrowe alleged a plot by Montagu to have him kidnapped. By 6 April 1659 the officers had grown impatient of the lack of attention in parliament to issues regarding army pay, and, on 18 April, Disbrowe rather brutally told his nephew to step down or be removed from power. On 7 May, Disbrowe was named to the committee of safety, and on 13 May, when the Rump Parliament was recalled, he secured a place on the new council of state. In July his military commission was confirmed in parliament, but only after he had expressed scepticism about its supposed superiority to one bestowed by the army itself, and by 5 October strains between the leading army officers and parliament were evident. Disbrowe had been proposed as lieutenant-general of horse by the regiment of John Lambert, and remained of the view that the Rump Parliament had nothing more to offer. On 8 November he sought finance for an army-run regime from the City of London. Before parliament was restored again on 26 December 1659 he proposed a new select senate of sixty to exercise a veto on a new assembly. He nevertheless preferred the Rump to a restored monarchy, and on 29 December wrote a letter of apology to the speaker for his disobedience. <br>
<br>The tide now began to run strongly against the Wallingford House group of disaffected senior officers, and on 9 January 1660 Disbrowe and other leading officers were confined to their country houses. By March he and Charles Fleetwood were objects of popular derision. He accepted the order of the council of state to remain quiescent, but that summer it was inconceivable that prominent republicans would simply be left alone by the restored monarchy, and in May he was arrested and brought to London while making his way through Essex to take ship. Humiliated by the jeers of youths on his way to be interrogated, he was nevertheless treated relatively well because of his critical attitude towards the restored Rump. In the <span class="roman">Act of Indemnity and Oblivion</span> of 13 June 1660 he was disqualified from public office for life. He was imprisoned briefly in the Tower of London for allegedly plotting the death of the king and the queen mother, and escaped to Holland. Thereafter he was never absent from the nervous government's list of alleged plotters, though it is unlikely there was any determined purpose in his meetings with old comrades-in-arms. On 9 April 1665 a proclamation was issued demanding his return to England on pain of being declared a traitor, and on his return, by 13 July, he was imprisoned in Dover Castle, and then in the Tower. Released on 23 February 1667, he was seen walking in London on 17 April by Samuel Pepys, who observed that Disbrowe &#145;looks well, and just as he used to do heretofore&#146;  (Pepys, 8.169). He lived afterwards quietly at Hackney, where he and other former army officers attended the Independent conventicle of John Owen. He died, probably at Hackney, in 1680. By his will, made on 26 March 1678 and proved on 20 September 1680, he left lands in Cambridgeshire (including the manor of Eltisley), Essex, and Lincolnshire. <h2>
<a name="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2>There is a contrast between Disbrowe's conscientious, effective, and generally conciliatory style as a police officer in the provinces and his demeanour during the crisis of 1659&#150;60 when he was pugnacious, perhaps quarrelsome, and seemed reluctant to consider the drift of political events, even when warned by subtler colleagues, such as Bulstrode Whitelocke. He was a soldier with the soldier's simple belief in military strength and security. Attacks on him in the popular press as &#145;a perfect clown&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Mystery of the Good Old Cause Briefly Unfolded</span>, 8) had begun as early as 1654, intensified on the eve of the Restoration, and persisted both in cheap lampoons and more sophisticated literary works such as Samuel Butler's <span class="italic">Hudibras</span>. But though he could certainly be blunt in his manner, his royalist critics, in social and political sneers, exaggerated his supposed rusticity, and doubtless dwelt on his shortcomings because of his kinship ties and personal affinity with Oliver Cromwell. His many cogent letters to John Thurloe during 1655&#150;6 reveal a man convinced of the importance of completing not only reforms but simple administrative tasks; his speeches in parliament, one who appreciated the virtues of strong government tempered by reconciliation for those willing to conform.<br>
