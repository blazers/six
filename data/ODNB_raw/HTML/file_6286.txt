<span class="headword">Corbet,  Edward</span>  (1601<span class="mult">x</span>3&#150;1658), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, was born at Pontesbury in Shropshire; his parents' names are unknown. He matriculated at Merton College, Oxford, on 16 November 1621, when he was said to be aged nineteen, graduated BA on 4 December 1622, was made a fellow in 1624, and proceeded MA on 25 June 1628. He became proctor on 4 April 1638. In the late 1630s he distinguished himself at Merton, where he became sub-warden under <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/3324/', "Sir Nathanael Brent")</script>, by his resistance to the innovations of Archbishop Laud. In particular, Corbet consistently refused to bow before the communion table.<br>
<br>Corbet, who like Brent was absent from Merton by the time the king arrived in Oxford in 1642, was chosen as a member of the Westminster assembly of divines and as a parliamentary preacher. On 28 December 1642 he preached before the Commons a sermon entitled <span class="italic">God's Providence</span> (1643), which demonstrates his speculative approach to theology. When Isaac Bargrave died in January 1643 the rectory at Chartham, Kent, was left vacant, but Laud, who at that time was in the Tower, refused to grant Corbet the living. In the resulting dispute parliament bypassed Laud's authority and instituted Corbet in the rectory by ordinance in May. The next month, citing Corbet's case, parliament sequestered Laud's &#145;estate&#146; pending the resolution of the charges against him. Like Brent, Corbet subsequently gave evidence at Laud's trial, detailing newly erected crucifixes as well as the command to bow upon entering the chapel at Merton.<br>
<br>Corbet continued at Chartham until 1646 when he returned to Oxford as one of the seven ministers appointed by parliament to preach royalist scholars into obedience, an assignment he found little to his liking. He was also elected one of the visitors of the university, &#145;yet seldom or never sat among them&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>: <span class="italic">Fasti</span>, 2.117). In January 1648 Corbet was installed as public orator and canon of the second stall in Christ Church, in place of Henry Hammond, who had been ejected by the visitors, but being &#145;a person of conscience and honesty&#146;  (ibid.), he resigned both places the following August. On 12 April 1648 he proceeded DD. On the death of Thomas Soame, Corbet was presented to the valuable rectory of Great Hasely, near Oxford.<br>
<br>By early 1649 Corbet had married Nathaniel Brent's daughter, Margaret. Together they had three children, Edward (who matriculated at Oxford on 16 November 1666 at the age of seventeen), Martha, and Margaret. His wife, Margaret, died in 1657, &#145;little above 28 years of age&#146; and was described by Henry Wilkinson in his funeral sermon for her as both loving and wise. Corbet himself died in London on 5 January 1658 aged about fifty-five. He was buried on 14 January in the chancel of Great Hasely, near his wife, having requested that John Conant, rector of Exeter College, preach his funeral sermon. By his will he bequeathed books to the Bodleian Library and libraries of Merton College and Shrewsbury School, and left the education of his son to Henry Wilkinson and of his daughters to his cousin Elizabeth, wife of Sir Francis Butler of Hertford.<br>
