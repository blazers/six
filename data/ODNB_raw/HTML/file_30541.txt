<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Bairnsfather,  (Charles) Bruce</span>  (1887&#150;1959), <span class="occ">cartoonist and writer</span>, was born at Strawberry Bank Cottage, Murree, Punjab, India, on 9 July 1887, the eldest son of Lieutenant (later Major) Thomas Henry (Tom) Bairnsfather (<i>d</i>. 1945), a Scottish officer in the Indian army, and Amelia Jane Eliza (Janie) Every (<i>d</i>. 1959), daughter of a former deputy lieutenant of Derbyshire. Both of Bairnsfather's parents were descended from a common grandfather, Sir Edward Every, eighth baronet. His mother was a talented amateur painter, specializing in birds on silk, and his father also composed comic songs. He had two younger brothers: Malcolm Harvey Bairnsfather (1890&#150;1891), who died of meningitis when a baby, and Thomas Duncan Bairnsfather (<i>b</i>. 1897), who died in the Second World War.<br>
<br>Bairnsfather was brought to England in 1895 and stayed with his mother's brother, the rector of Thornbury, near Bromyard, Herefordshire, before being enrolled at Rudyard Kipling's old school, the United Services College, Westward Ho!, Devon (1898&#150;1904). Frequently caned for doodling in his books, he was a failure academically though he won a prize for drawing. His parents returned to England in 1899 and he was transferred to an army crammer, Trinity College, Stratford upon Avon, in 1904 while also attending evening classes in art at Stratford Technical College. At the age of seventeen he sold his first drawing, an advertisement for Player's navy mixture, for 2 guineas. Having chosen the army as a career, he failed the entrance exams to Sandhurst and Woolwich officer cadet schools but eventually managed to gain a commission as a second lieutenant in his father's old regiment, the Cheshires.<br>
<br>Disillusioned with military life, however, Bairnsfather resigned in 1907 to become an artist, studying under Charles van Havermaet and Dudley Hardy at the John Hassall School of Art in Earls Court, London. Unsuccessful as a professional poster artist, he returned to the family home at Bishopton, Warwickshire, and took a job as an electrical engineer at Spensers Ltd, Stratford, specialists in gas and electric country-house lighting. Beginning as a junior installing lighting at the Old Memorial Theatre, Stratford, he later travelled widely for the company. During this period he took part in a number of amateur theatrical productions, specializing in female impersonations, and was &#145;discovered&#146; by Marie Corelli, the novelist, who lived locally and who arranged for him to audition for Sir Edward Moss's Empire music-hall group. (Bairnsfather backed out.) She also introduced him to the &#145;tea king&#146;, Sir Thomas Lipton, and he subsequently drew advertisements for Liptons, Player's cigarettes, Keene's mustard, and Beechams, and won a poster competition organized by an opera company.<br>
<br>In the First World War Bairnsfather served as machine-gun officer with the 1st battalion Royal 1st Warwickshires in France, eventually attaining the rank of captain. While stationed near Armenti&egrave;res he drew the first of his famous <span class="italic">Fragments from France</span> cartoons  (&#145;Where did that one go to?&#146;, <span class="italic">The Bystander</span>, January 1915) but did not see it published until he was hospitalized in April 1915 after suffering shell-shock and damage to the hearing in his left ear during the second battle of Ypres. Later, when posted to 34th division headquarters at Sutton Veney, Salisbury Plain, he drew his most celebrated cartoon, &#145;Well, if you knows of a better 'ole, go to it&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Bystander</span>, 24 Nov 1915), featuring two soldiers in a shell-hole during a bombardment. His best-known character, the pipe-smoking, walrus-moustached Midlands Tommy &#145;Old Bill&#146; Busby&#151;&#145;dim, dull and honest&#146; and usually wearing a scarf and balaclava helmet with his uniform&#151;first appeared in &#145;When the 'ell is it going to be strawberry?&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Bystander</span>, 15 Sept 1915). Though very popular with the troops (<span class="italic">The Bystander</span>'s sales rocketed and in 1916 alone more than 250,000 copies were sold of <span class="italic">Fragments from France</span>, the first of eight collections of his drawings), the establishment objected strongly to &#145;these vulgar caricatures of our heroes&#146; and questions were asked in parliament. None the less his works so improved morale that he was promoted officer-cartoonist and transferred to the intelligence department of the War Office to draw similar cartoons for the French, Italian, and American forces. In 1921 he married a 34-year-old Australian-born divorcee, the Hon. Mrs Cecilia Agnes (Ceal) Scott, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Bruton (1886/7&#150;1966), the former wife of the Hon. Michael Scott OBE (fifth son of the third earl of Eldon) and sister of the stage writer Helen Jerome. They had one daughter, Barbara Bruce Bairnsfather (<i>b</i>. 1922), and he had a stepdaughter, Heather Scott (<i>b</i>. 1908).<br>
<br>The &#145;Old Bill&#146; character, along with his younger friends Bert and Alf, was immensely popular both during and after the war, and Bairnsfather's celebrity continued to be such that he was the subject of one of the first talking motion pictures (1927), took part in the first experimental television transmissions from Alexandra Palace in north London (1936), and was invited to write, direct, and produce Canada's first major movie, <span class="italic">Carry on, Sergeant!</span> (1928). &#145;Old Bill&#146; himself appeared in books, plays, musicals (including C. B. Cochran's <span class="italic">The Better 'Ole</span> in 1917, which gave Sybil Thorndike her first West End role), silent and talking films (including <span class="italic">The Better 'Ole</span> in 1926, featuring Charlie Chaplin's brother Syd, and Alexander Korda's <span class="italic">Old Bill and Son</span> in 1941, co-starring John Mills), and comic strips (<span class="italic">Daily Graphic</span>, <span class="italic">Passing Show</span>, <span class="italic">The Illustrated</span>, and <span class="italic">Judge</span>), and was reproduced on pottery, playing cards, jigsaw puzzles, postcards, and other merchandise. &#145;Old Bill&#146; dolls were manufactured, a waxwork of the character appeared in Madame Tussaud's (1930), and a bus named after him became part of the collection of the Imperial War Museum in London (complete with &#145;Old Bill&#146; radiator mascot). However, perhaps surprisingly, he was not used in government poster campaigns until the Second World War. Bairnsfather's characters also had considerable influence on the work of other cartoonists, notably (during the Second World War) the American Bill Mauldin (&#145;Willie &amp; Joe&#146;) and the Welshman W. J. P. Jones (&#145;The Two Types&#146;). Sir David Low's &#145;Colonel Blimp&#146; (created in the 1930s) later attracted similar censure by the military and government authorities.<br>
<br>Although Bairnsfather repeatedly denied that &#145;Old Bill&#146; was based on a single person&#151;as he said, &#145;he was simply a hieroglyphic for a most prevalent type&#146;  (Bairnsfather, <span class="italic">Carry on, Sergeant!</span>, 54)&#151;many suggestions have been made regarding his original model. Bairnsfather was not a good businessman (he was sued for bankruptcy in 1932) and benefited less than others from royalties on his work. However, he supplemented his earnings from cartoons by numerous lecture tours in Great Britain, the United States, and Canada; music-hall variety acts; illustrated journalism in, for example, <span class="italic">The Graphic</span>, <span class="italic">The Tatler</span>, <span class="italic">Life</span>, and <span class="italic">New Yorker</span>; scriptwriting; and by producing books of light-hearted memoirs. He also edited his own popular weekly magazine for the <span class="italic">Bystander</span> group, <span class="italic">Fragments</span> (1919&#150;20).<br>
<br>Early in 1942, after the USA had entered the Second World War, Bairnsfather was appointed official cartoonist to the American forces in Europe. He held the rank of captain and wore an American uniform. As well as contributing to <span class="italic">Stars and Stripes</span> and <span class="italic">Yank</span> he also drew cartoons at American bases and as nose art on aircraft. <span class="italic">Old Bill Does It Again!</span> was published in 1940, followed by <span class="italic">Old Bill &amp; Son</span> (1940), <span class="italic">Jeeps and Jests</span> (1943), and <span class="italic">No Kiddin'</span> (1944). After the war he continued his lecture tours, talks, and other work but as an artist and performer never succeeded in breaking away from &#145;Old Bill&#146; in his many incarnations.<br>
<br>In appearance Bairnsfather was clean-shaven, with brown eyes and prematurely thinning hair (he often wore a cap or trilby to hide this.) Also, unusually for one of his background, he had tattoos&#151;a cobra on one arm and a butterfly on the other. He disliked describing his work as &#145;cartoons&#146;, preferring &#145;pictures&#146; or &#145;drawings&#146;, and he once said that his religious beliefs were &#145;a mixture of The Sermon on the Mount, Kipling's &#147;If&#148;, Omar Khayyam and Astronomy&#146;  (Holt and Holt, 39). Bruce Bairnsfather died on 29 September 1959 in the Royal Infirmary, Worcester, of acute renal failure after treatment for cancer of the bladder. He was survived by his wife. Cremated at Cheltenham crematorium, his memorial plaque mistakenly gives his age as seventy-one (he was seventy-two). In 1980 a blue plaque was erected to his memory at 1 Stirling Street, Kensington, London (one of his London studios).<br>
