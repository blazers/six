<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Novello,  (Joseph) Alfred</span>  (1810&#150;1896), <span class="occ">music publisher</span>, was born in London on 12 August 1810, the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20377/', "Vincent Novello (1781&#150;1861)")</script>, music publisher, arranger, and composer, and Mary Sabilla Novello, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Hehl (1789&#150;1854). Apprenticed to the York music dealer, John Robinson, from 1824 to 1829, he commenced business in Frith Street, Soho, in 1830. Initially, he inherited the catalogue already established by his father and one of his most important early ventures was to complete publication of Vincent Novello's arrangement of Purcell's <span class="italic">Sacred Works</span> (1832). In 1836 he both secured the copyright to Mendelssohn's <span class="italic">St Paul</span> and launched the <span class="italic">Musical World</span>, perhaps England's first modern music periodical, actions which much enhanced his reputation. A fine bass singer, he performed in concerts and at provincial festivals and was a member of the Lincoln's Inn chapel choir. His <span class="italic">Concise Explanation of the Gregorian Note</span> (1842) was a useful contribution to the growing interest in plainsong.<br>
<br>Novello's reputation ultimately rests, however, on his work as a publisher of &#145;cheap&#146; music. In 1842 he published Joseph Mainzer's sight-singing manual <span class="italic">Singing for the Million</span> and the weekly <span class="italic">Mainzer's Musical Times and Singing-Class Circular</span>. These were central texts of the mass singing-class movement, enthusiastically supported by those concerned with working-class morality in an age of political and industrial radicalism. He took over Mainzer's journal in 1844, including in its pages a musical supplement in the octavo format, adopted as the company standard from 1847. As the <span class="italic">Musical Times</span>, the journal eventually became a major periodical, especially for amateurs. These ventures propelled Novello's business toward mass production, a process encouraged by his growing awareness of the burgeoning amateur choral movement that he encountered on promotional tours in the provinces. In August 1846 he made the first of many price reductions, publishing the vocal score and keyboard accompaniment for <span class="italic">Messiah</span> for 6<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>.: previously, a <span class="italic">Messiah</span> piano score could cost up to 1 guinea. Further reductions followed and by 1859 a pocket edition of <span class="italic">Messiah</span> and other major oratorios was available for 1<i>s</i>. 4<i>d</i>., with shilling editions following from 1862.<br>
<br>Novello established his own printing company in 1847 and, following the example of William Clowes, he opted to use musical type rather than engraved prints. This method, although expensive, facilitated the extended print runs upon which his pricing policy depended. He was opposed in this by London printing unions and he utilized non-union labour in order to circumvent their objections. In the late 1840s and 1850s he campaigned vigorously against the &#145;taxes on knowledge&#146; (duties on paper, advertisements, and other tax burdens), although the claims made by later writers associated with the Novello Company that he was &#145;largely&#146; or &#145;solely&#146; responsible for their eventual abolition, were hugely exaggerated.<br>
<br>After Novello announced his retirement in October 1856 the business gradually passed to Henry Littleton, a senior employee who became a partner in 1861 and sole proprietor in 1866. It has been suggested that Novello's appetite for business was largely fuelled by devotion to his mother and the desire to fulfil ambitions she held for him; her death in 1854 released him from any such obligations. Novello retired with his father and sisters Mary and Sabilla, first to Nice and then, in 1861, to Genoa. Although maintaining an editorial interest in the <span class="italic">Musical Times</span> until 1863, he devoted ever more time to gardening and the scientific and technological experimentation that had long interested him. He died in Genoa on 16 July 1896, leaving an estate of &pound;63,386, money accrued not only from his publishing business but from well-considered investment in the railway and steel industries. Hagiographic literature of the late nineteenth century tended to portray Novello as the philanthropically inspired inventor of the Victorian choral tradition. Rather, he was an extremely astute businessman, albeit one guided by a strong sense of moral purpose, who recognized the strength of an existing market and nourished and expanded it with determination and skill.<br>
