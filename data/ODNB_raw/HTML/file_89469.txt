</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Wilberforce,  Richard Orme</span>, Baron Wilberforce  (1907&#150;2003), <span class="occ">judge</span>, was born on 11 March 1907 at Jullundur, India, the son of Samuel Wilberforce (1874&#150;1954), a member of the Indian Civil Service, and later a judge of the High Court in Lahore, and his wife, Catherine (<i>d</i>. 1963), daughter of John Sheepshanks, bishop of Norwich. His grandfather, Reginald Wilberforce, as a young ensign in the 52nd light infantry, had reached India just in time for the outbreak of the mutiny in May 1857; he fought in the retaking of Delhi and in the suppression of the mutiny. Reginald's father was Samuel Wilberforce, the disputatious bishop of Oxford (and later of Winchester). The bishop's father was William Wilberforce, the emancipator. Wilberforce was proud of his ancestry&#151;publishing the letters of his father and the mutiny chapter written by his grandfather, and anxious to defend his great-grandfather from crude misrepresentation in the Darwin controversy. But undoubtedly the greatest influence was William Wilberforce. Wilberforce studied the life and works of his ancestor William and placed him on a pinnacle.<h2>
<a name="Earlylifeandthebar"></a>Early life and the bar</h2>Two days after Wilberforce's birth his father wrote home admiringly to his own mother:<blockquote>I had no idea that babies could be so nice, but I don't suppose that they generally are &hellip; He has well formed features and a most determined mouth and chin and a big head. I shall be very surprised if he does not turn out full of brains and resolutions. (Wilberforce, <span class="italic">Reflections</span>, 2&#150;3)</blockquote>As a boy Wilberforce spent the first seven years of his life in India. In 1914, with the outbreak of the First World War, he was sent back to England with his younger sister. They were looked after by their maternal grandmother and their Aunt Doll. He attended five preparatory schools, the last being Sandroyd, which he regarded as the best investment his parents ever made: &#145;with only two years they brought me up to scholarship level&#146;  (ibid., 10). Thus equipped he was sent in June 1920 to sit the exam at Winchester. He won a place in college.<br>
<br>Wilberforce was happy at Winchester College and started to do well in his studies, especially in mathematics. The headmaster, Monty Rendall, played a decisive role in persuading him to drop mathematics and switch to classics:<blockquote>Wilberforce (he said), you are doing well with Maths, and I've no doubt that you could go on to Cambridge, become a Wrangler, most probably a Professor; these are good but narrow options. If you want a wider choice and greater opportunities in public life, you must go for the humanities. (<span class="italic">Reflections</span>, 13)</blockquote>Wilberforce accepted this advice, dropped maths, and threw himself into the classics. By the time he left Winchester he had achieved all four of the so-called &#145;medal tasks&#146; (the top prizes for composition of both prose and poetry, in Latin and Greek). He later acknowledged that the decision to switch from mathematics had been right. But his original interest was ineradicable. His mind constantly reverted to mathematical problems and scientific discoveries. As he later wrote, &#145;It is certainly remarkable how, in sleep or waking condition, my thoughts tend to circle round mathematical discoveries and problems&#146;  (ibid., 85).<br>
<br>From Winchester, Wilberforce moved effortlessly to New College, Oxford, where he was assured of a place and a scholarship on his academic record. He read the classics. As expected, in 1928 he got a first in classical moderations, followed two years later by a first in <i>literae humaniores</i>. He won the leading prizes in classics: the Craven, Hertford, and Ireland scholarships. He then moved to London and studied for the bar at the Middle Temple; he was called in 1931. He had the good fortune to be accepted as a pupil by the legendary Wilfred Hunt, for many years the busiest junior at the chancery bar. A co-pupil was his friend Herbert Hart.<br>
<br>In 1932, on his third attempt, Wilberforce was elected a prize fellow of All Souls College, Oxford. It was a year for some unfortunate asides, which were overheard by the candidates. At the candidates' dinner, when the port decanter was being circulated, the glass stopper fell from Wilberforce's nerveless grasp and smashed his dessert plate. A large slice slid across the table into the lap of Sir Charles Oman, who was heard to observe, &#145;That was one of the old plates&#146;  (<span class="italic">Reflections</span>, 20). Another candidate was Isaiah Berlin. As he left the room after the formal viva he heard the warden say to the senior fellow, &#145;I hope we don't have to have that one&#146;  (ibid., 183). Fate decreed otherwise. The successful candidates (unusually, three rather than two) were Berlin, Patrick Reilly (who subsequently had a distinguished career as a diplomat), and Wilberforce. He remained a fellow&#151;in one category or another&#151;until his death, over seventy years after his first election.<br>
<br>Eschewing an academic career, Wilberforce spent the rest of the 1930s establishing a practice at the chancery bar in the chambers of Andrew Clark. It was a struggle&#151;he had no family connections and very modest chances of inheriting work from others in the chambers. His earnings were meagre, though the work flow began to pick up by the end of the period. During this time he regularly kept a diary, which was privately printed in 1996 as <span class="italic">Thirty in the Thirties</span>. Naturally there is information about his attempts to establish a practice. What is of extraordinary fascination, however, is the account given in the diary of his social, intellectual, and cultural life. Although he was not well off, everything seems to have been within his grasp&#151;opera (Covent Garden and Glyndebourne), ballet (including Diaghilev), theatre, films, and foreign travel. He was fluent in French and German. Having visited Germany as a schoolboy, he went again in 1932 and as late as 1938. There were many visits to France and Italy.<h2>
<a name="Warservice"></a>War service</h2>The dark background to Wilberforce's diary account was the rise of Nazi Germany, leading on to the seizure of Czechoslovakia and Austria. Wilberforce deplored the weakness of the response by Britain and other countries, and came to fear that war was inevitable. He joined the reserves in 1938 after Munich and on the outbreak of the Second World War in September 1939 volunteered for service in the army, ignoring advice that it was not in his interests to do so.<br>
<br>Norway was the scene of Wilberforce's first military exploit. The war cabinet decided in the spring of 1940 that Britain must go to the aid of Norway, which had been invaded by Germany. Major-General Bernard Paget was put in charge of the expeditionary force. Paget was a brilliant soldier with wide experience of staff work. His aide-de-camp was Second Lieutenant Richard Wilberforce, Royal Artillery, who had no experience as a staff officer. The venture lasted three weeks. Wilberforce regarded them as the best three weeks of his life. The British intervention was, of course, doomed from the start. It was too little and too late. Wilberforce's diary records his admiration for Paget, in particular his integrity in dealing with the Norwegian army commanders. At the other end of the scale from admiration were his views about the &#145;dugouts&#146; in the War Office who were supposed to have planned the operation.<br>
<br>Paget was clearly impressed by Wilberforce in action in Norway, and invited him to accompany him to France. But the trip was aborted by the loss of a destroyer and by Dunkirk. Deprived of a French campaign, Wilberforce was deployed in various staff appointments until&#151;<i>mirabile dictu</i>&#151;he was made a lieutenant-colonel at the War Office in charge of army entertainments: he was supposed to bring order into amateur chaos. Then in 1944 he joined the supreme headquarters of the allied expeditionary force (SHAEF) in a unit under another fellow of All Souls, John Foster. The role of Foster's unit was to take over the administration of Germany after its hoped-for surrender. At SHAEF Wilberforce met and played bridge with Eisenhower, whom he admired. He also had a spell under Field Marshal Montgomery, and was &#145;struck by his limitless egoism and naivety&#151;rather likeable&#146;  (<span class="italic">Reflections</span>, 157).<br>
<br>By 2 May 1945 Germany was seen to be falling apart. Hitler's death was announced, and Doenitz proclaimed his own succession. The next day Wilberforce was instructed to draft appropriate surrender documents to cover what he called in his diary &#145;various eventualities&#146;, that is different types of surrender. He duly drafted three documents, covering total surrender, a military surrender, and merely an agreement to meet later and discuss. The second was the one actually adopted and it was signed in Berlin on 8 May by Field Marshal Wilhelm Keitel and others.<br>
<br>After the German surrender Wilberforce became head of the British legal section of the four-power Control Commission for the administration of Germany. He held the rank of brigadier and worked in Berlin with his equal-ranking American, Russian, and French counterparts. They had vast powers and responsibilities&#151;broadly to sweep away all traces of the Nazi regime, by abolishing or denazifying the existing laws, and by replacing its officials, judges, professors, trade union officials, and so on with &#145;clean&#146; substitutes. Needless to say the search for such people after twelve or so years of totalitarian rule was no easy task. One day a new French counterpart arrived, Roger Lenoan, an academic lawyer recently appointed as a judge of the cour de cassation. With him came his daughter, Captain Yvette Marie Lenoan. Two years later Wilberforce and Yvette were engaged and they married in July 1947. They had two children, Anne Catherine and Samuel (Sam). In 1946 Wilberforce had left the Control Commission in Berlin and become a civil servant in London with the rank of under-secretary at the Control Office for Germany and Austria. He spoke of this as the best civil service job in the world.<h2>
<a name="Returntothebar"></a>Return to the bar</h2>The Control Office was abolished in 1947, so Wilberforce returned to the bar&#151;a year too late. The old set of chambers had disappeared but Wilberforce managed to get accommodation of a sort together with Andrew Clark and Duff Dunbar. For the next few years he eked out an existence with Foreign Office cases (including <i>Corfu Straits</i> and <i>Norwegian Fisheries</i>) and was appointed as British legal member of the International Civil Aviation Authority. The practice built up and he took silk in 1954. In 1956 he was the lead author of <span class="italic">The Law of Restrictive Practices</span>, for many years the authoritative text, and was appointed CMG for his services in connection with the Warsaw convention on international carriage by air. Famous cases now came his way, such as <i>J. Bollinger v. Costa Brava Wine Company</i> (the so-called &#145;Spanish champagne&#146; case) in 1960. In the meantime, in 1950, he had stood as Conservative candidate for Central Hull&#151;the city which William Wilberforce had represented. Fortunately he lost&#151;fortunately, because the opening of a new career in parliament might have deprived the law of one of its great luminaries. Hull was later to capture him in another role, as chancellor of the university (1978&#150;94).<h2>
<a name="Chanceryjudgeandlawlord"></a>Chancery judge and law lord</h2>Wilberforce was appointed a chancery judge (and knighted) in 1961. After a mere three and a half years (most unusually without any intervening appointment to the Court of Appeal) he was elevated direct to the House of Lords, where he sat as a law lord for the next eighteen years. (Notwithstanding that speedy advance, there is a half self-mocking, half serious complaint in one of his autobiographical notes that if only he had been made a chancery judge a little bit earlier he could have sat in the Lords until he was ninety.) As a law lord he heard 465 appeals. He gave individual judgments in very many of them. Of this vast body of work one may fairly say that as a judge at the highest level he left a corpus of judgments, covering a huge area of the law, which stand comparison for their scope and brilliance with the judgments of any other British judge of the twentieth century.<br>
<br>It is scarcely possible in a short space to give any sort of impression of the richness and power of this corpus of decisions. Any selection will appear entirely arbitrary to others with knowledge of his achievement. There would perhaps be unanimity however on the point that the most important decision that Wilberforce rendered while a judge in the chancery court was in striking down the well-established retention and transfer system that governed the livelihoods of all professional footballers in the United Kingdom. The case was <i>Eastham v. Newcastle United Football Club and others</i> (1964). The &#145;others&#146; included the Football Association and the Football League. In the teeth of the opposition of these big battalions Wilberforce held that the long-accepted system imposed an unjustifiable restraint on the freedom of individual footballers to further their own careers and was thus contrary to public policy. In a characteristic passage he said:<blockquote>The transfer system has been stigmatised by the plaintiff's counsel [Gerald Gardiner QC] as a relic from the Middle Ages, involving the buying and selling of human beings as chattels; and, indeed, to anyone not hardened to the acceptance of the practice it would seem inhuman, and incongruous to the spirit of a national sport.</blockquote>No appeal was brought against this decision notwithstanding its profound economic repercussions for the football industry.Illustrative cases from the House of Lords records demonstrating Wilberforce's logical thought, clarity of expression, and imaginative insight include: <i>Prenn v. Simmonds</i> (1971), giving guidance as to how contractual documents are to be construed in the light of the factual background known to the parties when they contract, and with reference to the aim and genesis of the transaction; <i>Ebrahimi v. Westbourne Galleries</i> (1973), elucidating the concept of winding up a company on &#145;just and equitable&#146; ground and recognizing the role to be played by equitable considerations in affecting legal rights; <i>General Tire v. Firestone</i> (1975), restating the classical basis for the award of damages for infringement of a patent and repudiating a heretical <i>tertium quid</i> basis (what ought the infringer fairly to have paid?); <i>Hesperides Hotels v. Aegean Holidays</i> (1979), reasserting the established rule that English courts will not entertain actions claiming damages for trespass to foreign land or claims of conspiracy to commit such trespass; and <i>British Steel Corporation v. Granada TV</i> (1981), rejecting (notwithstanding the dissent of Lord Salmon) a plea that journalists were in a privileged position and were entitled to refuse to disclose the sources of their information.<br>
<br>During his lifetime Wilberforce's decisions were held in high regard and regularly cited with approval. One exception was his attempt in <i>Anns v. Merton London Borough Council</i> (1978) to restate the law of negligence as a simple double test applicable to cases where a local authority had responsibilities in relation to (say) the inspection of the foundations of newly built houses. His test was ultimately found to give rise to more problems than it solved and a seven-man panel of law lords finally declared it to be erroneous in <i>Murphy v. Brentwood District Council</i> (1991).<br>
<br>From the viewpoint of the advocate, Wilberforce was as close to perfection as it was possible to get: ever courteous, totally in command of the facts and the relevant law, never intervening to show his superior knowledge, never bullying, always encouraging, questioning in order to direct or sharpen the argument, not to deflate or crush. Sometimes he would give a prod to hasten the progress of a case or cut short a hopeless argument. But it was done with such grace and charm that no feathers were ruffled.<br>
<br>In 1971, when Wilberforce had been a law lord for some seven years, he was asked to be the chairman of an inquiry into the pay and conditions of electricity workers. He took on the job and resolved the dispute. Some thought he had been too generous but on the whole his work met with praise. In February 1972 a new and more formidable task was committed to him. This was to find a solution to the long-running miners' strike. It was clear that the government urgently needed an end to the strike. The country was paralysed, industry was at a standstill, hospitals and patients were at risk. Seven days after he was appointed Wilberforce and his two colleagues handed their report to the government, recommending a new pay structure for the miners on the basis that they were a special case. The feat was achieved by Wilberforce's relentless energy and stamina. The effort (including lack of sleep) imposed a very serious strain on his health. The report ended the strike, but the scale of the wage increases for miners which the committee recommended was much criticized in public and savagely in private by ministers and mandarins. Wilberforce felt that his supreme effort was regarded with contempt and that he himself had been banished from the ranks of the great and the good. It was years before he was again asked to undertake any sort of extra-judicial inquiry. When asked, he declined.<h2>
<a name="DebatesintheHouseofLordsandotheractivities"></a>Debates in the House of Lords and other activities</h2>In the House of Lords Wilberforce contributed often to debates on the floor of the house. He was a voice of authority and he was heard with deep respect. He was a passionate supporter of the institution and its works. After his eighteen years as a law lord he continued as an active member of the Lords for a further twenty-one years, regularly taking part in its debates. Even when a law lord he was not over-impressed by fashionable arguments about the separation of powers. With a strongly pragmatic approach to problems, he saw no harm in a law lord initiating a debate on, or intervening in, such topics as law reform, higher education, treaty implementation, or the protection of the weak&#151;to name but four matters where his interests were heavily involved. He would never allow himself to sit judicially in any cause where he might conceivably be thought to be <i>parti pris</i>. Short of abolition the worst thing that he thought could happen to the Lords was that it should be infiltrated by elected members.<br>
<br>His maiden speech was made on 1 April 1965 on what was an ideal occasion for him&#151;the second reading debate on a bill to set up the two law commissions, one for England and Wales and a second for Scotland. Naturally he was an enthusiastic supporter of the bill, and with his range of knowledge and imaginative insight he was able to make a persuasive case for it. He argued that there was a need for a standing body to undertake law reform; that the existing <i>ad hoc</i> committees, though doing excellent work, were inadequate; that there was much to be done as regards codification of the law; and that comparison with other legal systems was essential, to prevent insularity and widen the options. Though he welcomed the idea of academic lawyers serving on the commission, he wanted a lay element: &#145;If the generals will forgive me for pirating the expression, law reform is much too serious a matter to be entrusted to the lawyers&#146;  (<span class="italic">Hansard 5L</span>, 1 April 1965, 264.117). Apart from law reform another frequent subject for Wilberforce's speeches was slavery, ancient and modern. Indeed, both his last two speeches&#151;delivered on 13 March and 25 June 2002&#151;were directed against the trade of trafficking human beings: victims of exploitation and forced labour, enforced mercenaries, and so on. He accepted that it was more difficult to stamp out the modern form of slavery. As he said, &#145;Anyone can recognise a slave; it is not so easy to recognise a victim of trafficking.&#146;<br>
<br>Wilberforce had joined the Anti-Slavery Society as a member in 1932. In 1934 he was asked to serve on the general committee. He rose to become a vice-president and then joint president in 1970, and he remained president until his death. When the City of London gave a dinner in 1972 to celebrate the bicentenary of the decision in the case of James Somerset (the slave whom Lord Mansfield, with some hesitancy, refused to return to his owner) Wilberforce was asked to propose one of the toasts. He worked tirelessly and to the end of his life in the interests of the society&#151;fund-raising, travelling abroad, speaking in parliament, and giving advice.<br>
<br>Wilberforce was also active in numerous professional bodies, including the International Law Association, whose executive committee he chaired from 1966 to 1988. He was president of the F&eacute;d&eacute;ration Internationale du Droit Europ&eacute;en in 1978, and a member of the Permanent Court of Arbitration at The Hague. An interest in music saw him made joint vice-president of the Royal College of Music, and an honorary fellow. He received honorary degrees from Oxford, London, Hull, and Bristol universities; and he was high steward of Oxford University and visitor of Wolfson and Linacre colleges.<h2>
<a name="Characterandassessment"></a>Character and assessment</h2>Perhaps the secret of perpetual youth is endless curiosity. Wilberforce made his own collection of quotations in a &#145;not so commonplace&#146; book. He included one from Walter Pater: &#145;To burn always with this hard gemlike flame, to maintain this ecstasy, is success in life. Failure is&#151;to form habits, for habit is relative to a stereotyped world.&#146; He never formed such habits. Everything new held a fascination for him: new people (he always wanted to sit next to the latest prize fellows at All Souls: as he talked no age barrier existed); the latest scientific ideas, be they about black holes, DNA, or a &#145;beautiful&#146; proof of a difficult theorem; the latest exhibition at the Royal Academy; or difficult music, such as by Stockhausen and others. When the Eurostar service to Paris opened he was on the first available train. And so with the Jubilee line: Wilberforce was on the first train, and getting out at every station to study the architecture.<br>
<br>Wilberforce had a combination of qualities that was, among his contemporaries, probably unique. With a superb mind and a retentive memory; imaginative; humorous; sensitive in art and music; and sensitive in all human contacts, he was extremely modest and entirely lacking in arrogance or self-importance, enabling him to talk without condescension and on easy terms to fellow peers and small children, to the clever and the not so clever.<br>
<br>Suffering from prostate cancer, Wilberforce died on 15 February 2003 at the Royal Marsden Hospital, Chelsea, London, of a chest infection. He was survived by his wife, Yvette, his daughter, Anne Catherine, and his son, Samuel. His funeral service was held on 22 February; memorial services were held at St Margaret's, Westminster, on 15 May 2003, the University of Hull on 20 May 2003, All Souls College on 26 October 2003, and the Temple Church on 27 October 2003. His <span class="italic">Reflections on My Life</span>, edited by his son, was published posthumously in 2003.<br>
