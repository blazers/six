<span class="headword">Khaliquzzaman, Choudhry</span>  (1889&#150;1973), <span class="occ">politician in India and Pakistan</span>, was born on 25 December 1889 in Chunar, in the district of Mirzapur, of the North-Western Provinces of India. He was the fourth of the eight children of Sheikh Mohammad Zaman, an assistant <i>tahsildar</i> in British service, and his second wife, Maqboolunnisa Begum, the youngest daughter of Choudhri Riyasat Ali of Bhilwal. He had five brothers and two sisters. Khaliquzzaman was educated at the Jubilee High School, Lucknow, and the Muhammadan Anglo-Oriental College, Aligarh, from which he graduated finally with a BA and LLB in 1916.<br>
<br>At Aligarh, Khaliquzzaman formed friendships with young Muslims like himself who were to push the All-India Muslim League in a radical direction; he also came under the influence of the charismatic pan-Islamist politician Muhammad Ali. In 1912&#150;13 he joined Dr Ansari's Red Crescent mission to assist the Turkish wounded in the Tripoli war. In 1916 he both joined the Indian National Congress and became joint secretary of the All-India Muslim League. In 1917 he began to practise as junior to Muhammad Nasim, the leader of the Oudh bar. In 1919 he assisted the <i>&#145;ulama&#146;</i> of Firangi Mahal in setting up the central <i>khilafat</i> committee to press for the protection of the Turkish caliphate and the holy places of Islam. In the non-co-operation movement which followed, in alliance with the Congress led by Gandhi, Khaliquzzaman was the leading political figure in Lucknow, presiding over its Congress committee and going to gaol from December 1921 to December 1922 for his civil disobedience activities.<br>
<br>From 1922 to 1937 Khaliquzzaman took a nationalist stance. He regarded Motilal Nehru as his leader, supporting Nehru's Swaraj Party. At the same time he was chairman of the Lucknow municipal board, 1923&#150;5 and 1929&#150;32. In 1928 he supported Nehru's proposals for a constitutional future for India (the Nehru report) without separate electorates for minorities. In 1929 he was secretary of Dr Ansari's newly formed Muslim Nationalist Party, which was to fight for Muslim interests within the Congress; and in 1930 he was nominated president of the Congress at a time when government had declared it illegal. From 1932 he was secretary of the Muslim Unity Board, which won one third of the Muslim seats in the 1934 elections to the central legislative assembly. In 1936 he helped to make a deal with M. A. Jinnah on behalf of the board which permitted anti-landlord elements in Muslim politics to have a major voice on the Muslim League parliamentary board. Through this arrangement on 8 February 1935, Khaliquzzaman rejoined the League.<br>
<br>The events surrounding the 1937 general elections were a defining moment in the life of Khaliquzzaman and also in the fortunes of the All-India Muslim League. After the Congress won a substantial victory in the United Provinces, it refused Khaliquzzaman's offer of a coalition with the League, the talks breaking down in part over the number of places to be found for Leaguers in the cabinet, but in the main because the Congress insisted on completely absorbing the League party in the assembly. From now on Khaliquzzaman was leader of the opposition and devoted his energies to the revival of the All-India Muslim League, seconding its <span class="roman">Pakistan Resolution</span> on 23 March 1940. He was a League member of the United Provinces legislative assembly until 1947 and a key figure in the leadership at all-India level. After partition Khaliquzzaman did not immediately go to Pakistan, being elected to the Indian constituent assembly and accepting from Jinnah the leadership of the Muslims of independent India. In October 1947, however, he migrated to Pakistan.<br>
<br>Khaliquzzaman's career in Pakistan was less successful. From 1948 to 1950 he was president of the Muslim League. In 1950 he launched his abortive Islamistan movement to create a confederation of Muslim countries. In 1953 he was made governor of East Pakistan but resigned in 1954 when governor's rule was proclaimed there. He was ambassador to Indonesia in 1954&#150;6 and founded the Convention Muslim League in 1962 to support President Ayub Khan and the new Pakistan constitution.<br>
<br>Khaliquzzaman was married first in 1910 to his cousin Fasih-un-Nisa, daughter of Muhammad Nasim, and second in 1930 to Zahida Khatoon, the niece of Haji Istafa Khan, the owner of the well-known Lucknow perfumers Asghar Ali Muhammad Ali. Both wives migrated to Pakistan, the first living the life of a traditional Muslim housewife in Larkana, Sind, and the second living with her husband in Karachi. After falling into a coma, Khaliquzzaman died in Karachi on 17 May 1973 and was buried in the Mewa Shah graveyard there. He was survived by five sons and four daughters from his marriages; his second wife was a poet and minister in the West Pakistan government. Khaliquzzaman was of medium build, habitually wore a moustache, and was known by his friends as Khaliq. He was widely respected as a shrewd, tough, individualistic and, at times, controversial politician. In his frank autobiography, <span class="italic">Pathway to Pakistan</span> (1961), in which he was critical of Jinnah, he also declared that &#145;the greatest sacrifice I made for the Muslim cause was my dissociation with my loving and affectionate Hindu friends&#146;  (Khaliquzzaman, 342).<br>
