<span class="headword">Haynes,  Hezekiah</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1693), <span class="occ">parliamentarian army officer and deputy major-general</span>, was the second son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/12779/', "John Haynes (1594&#150;1654)")</script> of Copford Hall in Essex and Mary Thornton, daughter of Robert Thornton of Nottingham. A staunch puritan, John Haynes emigrated to New England in 1633 and was later governor of both Massachusetts and Connecticut. Hezekiah returned from New England in 1637 to supervise the sale of some family property. On the outbreak of the first civil war he joined the parliamentarian forces, serving as a captain in Colonel Holborne's regiment of foot. By early 1645 he had risen to the rank of major in Charles Fleetwood's cavalry regiment. He fought at the battle of Preston in 1648, and commanded Fleetwood's regiment at Dunbar in 1650. He probably fought at Worcester in 1651. During the early 1650s he was stationed with Fleetwood's regiment in Essex. In this period he was appointed a JP for Essex, and married Anne, daughter of Thomas Smithsby, former saddler to Charles I. He also purchased some crown lands in Norfolk and Suffolk, but sold these again before the Restoration, though he may have retained some crown property in Essex. Throughout the 1640s and 1650s he was a close friend of the minister of Earls Colne in Essex, Ralph Josselin, who frequently mentions him and his family in his diary.<br>
<br>From the early 1650s Haynes began to carry out administrative as well as military duties for the Commonwealth. In 1653 he served on the committee which investigated how the official posts could be better regulated and the same year he was appointed to the committee charged with reducing the various government treasuries into a single fund. In 1654 he was named a treasury commissioner and a commissioner for the ejection of scandalous ministers and schoolmasters in Essex and Norfolk. Following the royalist risings of March 1655 Haynes supervised the government's response in Essex and secured a number of prominent royalists who were considered to be major security risks. He remained active in East Anglia throughout the summer, disarming royalist suspects and supervising the raising of the new county troops of horse militia, and on the appointment of the major-generals in the autumn of 1655 he was chosen to act as Charles Fleetwood's deputy in Norfolk, Suffolk, Essex, Cambridgeshire, and the Isle of Ely.<br>
<br>Haynes began work as deputy major-general in early November in Norfolk and over the next few months supervised the taking of security from the royalists of East Anglia and the assessment and imposition of the decimation tax upon them. Among those decimated in Essex was his elder brother, Robert. He also arrested a number of individuals who he believed represented a particular security risk, including the royalist poet John Cleveland, whom he described as &#145;a most desperate enemy to God and good men&#146;  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Rawl. A 32, fols. 647&#150;50). At the end of 1655 he intervened in the election of the chief municipal officers in Colchester, purging the electorate to ensure the return of individuals who supported the government. In July and August 1656 he did all he could to secure the election to the second protectorate parliament of those supportive of Cromwell's regime, but the voters largely rejected his favoured candidates and returned those whom he considered to be the enemies of the godly cause. His letters to John Thurloe, Cromwell's secretary of state, during this period reveal his deep disappointment at the outcome of the election.<br>
<br>Haynes was alarmed by the threat posed by the Quakers in East Anglia, who he reported had held &#145;considerable meetings&#146; and &#145;greatly molested&#146; his counties. In the summer of 1656 he arrested a large number and imprisoned them at Bury St Edmunds in Suffolk. He informed Thurloe that some of the local clergy believed the Quakers were &#145;ripe to cutt throates&#146;, and added: &#145;I thinke their principles would let them if they dared&#146;  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Rawl. A 40, fols. 121&#150;4). Haynes sat for Essex in the 1656 parliament. In December, after the house had narrowly rejected a proposal that the Quaker James Nayler should be executed for his blasphemy at Bristol, he suggested that &#145;his tongue might be slit or bored through, and that he might be stigmatized with the letter B&#146;  (<span class="italic">Diary of Thomas Burton</span>, 1.153). He is not recorded as having taken part in the debates on the <span class="roman">Decimation Bill</span> in December 1656 and January 1657. Later in 1657 his elder brother died and left him the family seat of Copford Hall.<br>
<br>Following Oliver Cromwell's death Haynes joined with his commanding officer, Charles Fleetwood, in opposing Richard Cromwell and his parliament and in calling for the return of the Rump Parliament. Later in 1659 he backed Fleetwood and Lambert in their struggle with the Rump and supported its forcible closure by the army in October. After the Rump's re-assembly in December he lost his commission and was ordered to return home to Essex. He remained there during the summer months of 1660 but was arrested in November on suspicion of involvement in subversive activities and held in the Tower of London for the next eighteen months. He was released in April 1662 after signing a bond of &pound;5000 for his future good behaviour. Following his release he lived quietly at Copford Hall until 1684, when he made the property over to his son and moved to Coggeshall. He died there on 26 August 1693.<br>
