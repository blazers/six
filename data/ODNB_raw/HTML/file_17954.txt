<span class="headword">Manners,  George</span>  (1778&#150;1853), <span class="occ">journal editor and diplomatist</span>, was the fourth son of Robert Manners of Kentish Town, London. Of his mother and his early education nothing is known. He entered Lincoln's Inn on 7 March 1793, but evidently discovered activities more congenial to him than study for the bar. In 1806 he published a five-act play in verse, <span class="italic">Edgar, or, Caledonian Feuds</span>, and in October 1807 he started a paper, <span class="italic">The Satirist, or, Monthly Meteor</span>, which was, by his own subsequent description, &#145;devoted to the purposes of exposing and castigating every species of literary and moral turpitude&#146;  (G. Manners, <span class="italic">Vindiciae satiricae</span>, 1809, 5). The journal was strongly tory in its politics, and sought to promulgate this line through satirical articles, stories, and verses: the coloured cartoons that featured in early editions were soon dropped. William Cobbett, Francis Burdett, and Samuel Whitbread were notable targets of its often scurrilous attacks on reformers, while the less prominent William Hallett, the radical candidate for Berkshire at the election of 1812, was the object of a sustained campaign of invective.<br>
<br>The tone, if not the politics, of <span class="italic">The Satirist</span> was clearly unpalatable to the establishment. On 12 June 1812 Manners was required by the bar, which had declined to hear his final exercise, to explain &#145;numerous instances of libellous and unjustifiable attacks on private character, evidently inserted [in the paper] with a view to profit&#146;. It was noted that he had been prosecuted and imprisoned for three months for one libel; that his conduct in another case of February 1809 had been &#145;highly disrespectable&#146;, and that a further action was pending. Manners justified his libels on &#145;public grounds&#146; and cited the plaudits he had received from Sir James Mansfield, the trial judge in the 1809 case. Evidently his persuasive powers were strong, and he was duly, if belatedly, called to the bar  (<span class="italic">Black Books</span>). Very shortly afterwards he sold <span class="italic">The Satirist</span>, and its premises at 267 Strand, to the journalist William Jerdan, who toned down its content, a move that did not have the desired effect upon its profitability. The paper ceased publication in 1814 (it is not to be confused with the similar title founded in 1831 by Barnard Gregory).<br>
<br>Thereafter Manners appears to have practised law in London: he is listed as a special pleader in 1815 and 1817 at addresses in Gray's Inn and at 22 St James's Place, Westminster. In 1819 he became British consul at Boston, an appointment which he held until 1839. In 1825 he published (in Boston) <span class="italic">The Conflagration: a Poem</span>, which was written to aid victims of Canadian fires. Jerdan, who had not benefited from his business dealings with Manners, none the less described him as &#145;a gentleman in every sense, full of fancy and talent, acute and well informed&#146;  (Jerdan, 1.108). The sixth Baron Monson remembered him as &#145;a remarkably tall distinguished looking man&#146;, and recalled his appearance at a masquerade breakfast at the height of his journalistic infamy, dressed as an itinerant preacher &#145;standing inside of a tub, which hid his own legs, [with] short false ones attached before him&#146;. He kept up an ironic tirade against &#145;luxury and gluttony&#146;, in which he occasionally paused &#145;for the purpose of stretching his hand behind him to the refreshments, and helping himself to wine and dainties&#146;  (<span class="italic">N&amp;Q</span>, 2nd ser., 1, 1856, 361). Manners died at Coburg, Upper Canada, on 18 February 1853.<br>
