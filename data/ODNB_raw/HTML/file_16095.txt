<span class="headword">Latham,  Simon</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1649?), <span class="occ">writer on falconry</span>, has left virtually no record of his life. Although the precise relationship cannot be established, he may have been the nephew of, and was almost certainly connected with, Lewis Latham of Elveston, Bedfordshire, a professional falconer who rose through the ranks to become serjeant of his majesty's hawks in 1627. Simon Latham dedicated his treatise on falconry to Sir Thomas Monson, master of the king's hawks, but there is no evidence in the state records to support suggestions that he was employed as a royal falconer. He may, however, have been the Simon Latham who received a bequest of 5<i>s</i>. from his brother, William, in 1632. Although Latham is described as a gentleman in his book, the Lathams are not recorded as gentry in the visitations. It is more probable that he was the Simon Latham, yeoman of Bletsoe, whose will was proved in Bedfordshire in 1649. That would explain why he was not mentioned in the 1655 will of Lewis Latham.<br>
<br>Latham acknowledged that he was introduced to falconry by Henry Sadleir of Eversley, the third son of Sir Ralph Sadleir of Standon, master of the hawks, and that he wrote about falconry in response to the suggestion of a friend. He claimed no literary skill and indeed the verses which he included in his treatise are somewhat crude. His treatise, <span class="italic">Latham's Falconry, or, The Faulcons Lure and Cure in Two Books</span> appeared in two parts in 1614 and 1618 and was subsequently reissued in 1633, 1658, and 1665. Unlike many examples of the genre, it was original, practical, and of lasting value. Although he referred in passing to Geoffrey Turbeville, he claimed correctly that his book did not draw on traditional printed sources. The first part was a highly specialized study of how to train the haggard peregrine, that is, a falcon which has been trapped as an adult as distinct from one taken from the nest before it can fly. This was followed by a more conventional review of methods to prevent and treat disease in hawks and the discussion was extended to include goshawks, sparrowhawks, and lanner falcons.<br>
