<span class="headword">Hood, Sir  Samuel</span>, first baronet  (1762&#150;1814), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, third son of Samuel Hood of Kingsland, Dorset, and Anne (<i>d</i>. 1775), daughter of James Bere of Westbury, Wiltshire, was born on 27 November 1762. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13670/', "Captain Alexander Hood (1758&#150;1798)")</script> was his brother. He entered the navy in 1776 on the <i>Courageux</i> with his cousin Samuel (afterwards Lord) Hood. In 1778 he was moved to the <i>Robust</i> with Alexander Hood, the future Lord Bridport, and was present at the action off Ushant on 27 July. In 1779&#150;80 he served in the sloop <i>Lively</i> in the channel. When Sir Samuel Hood was appointed second in command in the West Indies he took Samuel into his flagship, the <i>Barfleur</i>, on which he was promoted lieutenant on 11 October 1780. He was present in the several actions with De Grasse&#151;off Martinique on 29 April 1781; at the Chesapeake on 5 September 1781; and at St Kitts on 25&#150;6 January 1782.<br>
<br>On 31 January 1782 Hood was promoted by his cousin to the nominal command of the sloop <i>Renard</i>, then a hospital ship at Antigua. Hood remained in the <i>Barfleur</i> as a volunteer until the end of the war, and was thus at the actions off Dominica on 9 April, at the battle of the Saintes on 12 April, and in the Mona passage on 19 April 1782. He brought the <i>Renard</i> back to England at the end of the war. He lived two years in France, acquiring an intimate knowledge of the language. In 1785 he was appointed to the sloop <i>Weasel</i> on the Halifax station, where he surveyed the coasts and harbours, and on 24 May 1788 he was posted to the command of the frigate <i>Thisbe</i>, which he brought home and paid off in the autumn of 1789. In May 1790 he commissioned the frigate <i>Juno</i> (32 guns) in which he went out to Jamaica. On 3 February 1791, while lying in St Anne's harbour, he rescued three men from a wreck during a violent storm. With his bargemen reluctant to man his captain's barge, Hood himself jumped in, saying, &#145;I never gave an order to a sailor in my life that I was not ready to undertake and execute myself&#146;, and shoved off. For this the house of assembly of Jamaica voted 100 guineas for a sword to be presented to him.<br>
<br>The <i>Juno</i> returned to England in the summer of 1791, and through the autumn and the following year was stationed at Weymouth, in attendance on the king. Early in 1793 she went out to the Mediterranean with the fleet under Lord Hood, and was with it at the occupation of Toulon. However, the <i>Juno</i> was absent at Malta when Toulon fell, and Hood, unaware of developments, brought her back to the inner harbour on the dark and drizzling night of 9 January 1794; but then he made a dashing escape, under fire.<br>
<br>Soon after this Hood was engaged in the operations on the coast of Corsica, and after the capture of S. Fiorenzo Lord Hood transferred him to the fine frigate <i>L'Aigle</i> (36 guns), and sent him in 1795 in command of a small squadron into the archipelago to protect the trade and watch some French frigates which had taken refuge in Smyrna. In April 1796 Hood was moved into the <i>Zealous</i> (74 guns), one of the fleet with Sir John Jervis (afterwards the earl of St Vincent) off Toulon, and in 1797 off Cadiz. He won the confidence of his new commander (who had little love for Hood's cousins) by establishing discipline in a previously disorderly ship. He missed the battle of Cape St Vincent because the <i>Zealous</i> was refitting at Lisbon; but in July she was one of the squadron with Nelson in his disastrous attack on Santa Cruz. With the assault force almost out of ammunition and surrounded in a square, Hood was employed by Troubridge to conduct the extraordinary negotiations which extricated the survivors. Hood demanded of the Spanish governor that they be provided with boats to return to their squadron within ten minutes or they would burn the town; he stood with watch in hand until the Spaniard backed down.<br>
<br>In early 1798 the <i>Zealous</i> was in the Bay of Biscay and off Rochefort; but having again joined the fleet before Cadiz, she was one of the ships sent in May to reinforce Nelson in the Mediterranean [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/96379', "Nelson's band of brothers")</script>]. In the battle of Abu Qir Bay the <i>Zealous</i>'s role was particularly brilliant: closely following the <i>Goliath</i>, Hood let go his anchor on the bow of the <i>Guerrier</i>, the leading French ship; he than heartened the oncoming British line by dismasting her within twelve minutes. After a three-hour pounding <i>Guerrier</i> surrendered, completely shattered, and Hood passed on to engage other ships. When Nelson quitted the coast of Egypt, Hood was senior officer commanding the squadron which continued to blockade the French army, and captured or destroyed some thirty of their transports. In February 1799 he rejoined Nelson at Palermo, and was employed during the spring in the defence of Salerno, and afterwards as governor of Castel Nuovo at Naples. The king of the Two Sicilies awarded him the order of St Ferdinand and of Merit.<br>
<br>In May 1800 the <i>Zealous</i> was paid off, and Hood was appointed to the <i>Courageux</i>, in the squadron under Sir John Borlase Warren off Ferrol. In January 1801 he was moved into the <i>Venerable</i>, which after a few months in the channel joined Sir James Saumarez (afterwards Lord de Saumarez) in time to take prominent parts in the unfortunate action at Algeciras on 6 July, and in the brilliant victory in the straits on 12 July. When leading the pursuit next day, the <i>Venerable</i> had all her masts shot away; she went ashore, and was later refloated with difficulty. The <i>Venerable</i> was paid off at the peace, and in October 1802 Hood was sent out as joint-commissioner for the government of Trinidad. By the death of Rear-Admiral Totty he became commander-in-chief of the Leeward Islands station, hoisting a broad pennant on board the <i>Centaur</i>; and on the renewal of the war he captured, together with the land forces, the islands of St Lucia and Tobago in June 1803, and, on the mainland, Demerara, Essequibo, and Berbice (September), and Surinam (May 1804). Under his command also a large number of the enemy's privateers and warships were captured or destroyed, to the great advantage of the English trade; and in January 1804 the Diamond Rock at the entrance to Fort Royal harbour, Martinique, was occupied, armed, and commissioned as &#145;a sloop of war&#146;. Hood's services were acknowledged by complimentary addresses from the legislative assemblies of the islands, and the present of plate of the value of 300 guineas; he was also nominated a KB (26 September 1804). On 6 November he married the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26521/', "Hon. Mary Elizabeth Frederica Mackenzie (1783&#150;1862)")</script>, eldest daughter of Lord Seaforth, governor of Barbados; they had no children.<br>
<br>Early in 1805 Hood returned to England, where he was further rewarded with a colonelcy of the marines; continuing in the <i>Centaur</i> he was sent off Rochefort in command of a squadron of six battleships. On 25 September he fell in with a French squadron of five large frigates and two brigs bound for the West Indies with troops, but while his ships were capturing the four largest of these Hood's right elbow was smashed by a musket ball, entailing the amputation of the arm; for this he was awarded a pension of &pound;500 per annum. In the 1806 election the government nominated him a &#145;naval hero&#146; candidate for the Westminster seat once held by Lord Hood, and he topped the poll. His lust for active service afloat led him to decline a proffered seat on the Admiralty board. At the May 1807 election his friend Sir Evan Nepean provided him with a seat, Bridport, which he was to hold until 1812. Hood returned to sea in the <i>Centaur</i> in 1807, and was in Lord Gambier's fleet at Copenhagen. On 2 October Hood was promoted rear-admiral of the blue, and later, with his flag in the <i>Centaur</i>, he had naval command of the force which captured Madeira on 26 December 1807. In the following year he advanced to rear-admiral of the white and was second in command of the fleet in the Baltic, under Sir James Saumarez. On 26 August the <i>Centaur</i> was with the <i>Implacable</i> (Captain Thomas Byam Martin), pursuing far ahead of the Swedish fleet to which they were attached; Hood cut off the <i>Sevolod</i> (80 guns) from the Russian line, and captured her after a stubborn defence in which the two ships, locked together, ran aground. The <i>Sevolod</i> had to be burnt, but the <i>Centaur</i> was saved from the Russian fleet by Byam Martin's intervention. The king of Sweden awarded him the grand cross of the order of the Sword.<br>
<br>In January 1809 Hood was second in command at Corunna during the re-embarkation of the army, for which he received the tumultuous thanks of the House of Commons in his seat as member for Bridport. He was created a baronet on 13 April 1809, and for the next two years he commanded a division in the Mediterranean. On 31 July 1810 he became rear-admiral of the red. On 1 August 1811 he was advanced to vice-admiral of the blue, and towards the end of the year was appointed commander-in-chief in the East Indies, where he arrived in the early summer of 1812. His command was uneventful, the war having been brought to an end with the capture of Java and Mauritius; and the time was mainly occupied in regulating and reforming points of organization or discipline and the methods of victualling, in which his reforms reportedly effected a saving to the government of something like 30 per cent. On 4 January 1814 he was appointed vice-admiral of the white. He died at Madras on 24 December 1814, of malaria, after three days' illness.<br>
<br>A life which, with few and short intermissions, was spent in active service left Hood short of social polish. Even service friends thought him &#145;reserved to a distressing degree&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters and Papers of &hellip; Thos. Byam Martin</span>, 1.154) and &#145;awkward and ungraceful&#146;  (Hotham, 1.270). The latter thought him the only man he ever knew &#145;who appeared to like a sea life <i>par excellence</i>, and who was never happy out of it&#146;  (ibid., 1.269). In his own element he was a thorough professional and a popular commander with all ranks. The &#145;occasional streak of obstinacy about him if what he heard did not coincide with his opinion or suit his wishes&#146;  (ibid., 1.269), also made him an unrelenting opponent in combat, the archetypal fighting captain that commanders wanted when action loomed. Because Hood died without children, the baronetcy, by a special clause in the patent, passed to the son of his brother Alexander.<br>
