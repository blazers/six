<span class="headword">Mosley <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Freeman-Mitford; <em>other married name </em>Guinness]</span>,  Diana</span>, Lady Mosley  (1910&#150;2003), <span class="occ">Nazi sympathizer and author</span>, was born on 17 June 1910 at 1 Graham Street (now Graham Terrace), Belgravia, London, the fourth child and third of the six daughters of David Bertram Ogilvy Freeman-Mitford, later second Baron Redesdale (1878&#150;1958), and his wife, Sydney (1880&#150;1963), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32005/', "Thomas Gibson Bowles")</script>, politician. Her eldest sister was the novelist <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/31450/', "Nancy Freeman-Mitford")</script>&#151;who portrayed her as Linda in <span class="italic">The Pursuit of Love</span> (1945) and <span class="italic">Love in a Cold Climate</span> (1949)&#151;and her younger sisters included <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/58824/', "Unity Freeman-Mitford")</script>, Nazi sympathizer, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/60652/', "Jessica Freeman-Mitford")</script>, left-wing author and journalist. She was educated at home (first at Malcolm House, on the Batsford Park estate in Gloucestershire, then by governesses at the family home of Asthall Manor in Oxfordshire) before attending a day school in Paris for six months at the age of sixteen.<br>
<br>She was the most beautiful of six good-looking sisters&#151;James Lees-Milne, who professed himself in love with her all his life, described her as &#145;the nearest thing to Botticelli's Venus that I have ever seen&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Independent</span>, 13 Aug 2003). Her blue-eyed, blonde looks were immortalized in the Boris Anrep mosaic on the first floor of the National Gallery and in portraits by Augustus John, Pavel Tchelitchew, and Henry Lamb. From early adolescence she longed to leave the small Cotswold village of Swinbrook (to which the family had moved from Asthall) for the wider world of art, music, and letters. When <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/51246/', "Bryan Walter Guinness (1905&#150;1992)")</script>, poet, novelist, heir to the Guinness fortune, and later second Baron Moyne, fell in love with her during her first season she persuaded her parents to allow her to marry him (on 30 January 1929) despite their well-founded reservations that she was too young to know her own mind. The Guinnesses' house in Buckingham Street quickly became a centre for the &#145;clever and amusing people who could chat endlessly&#146; that Diana had always wanted to meet  (de Courcy, 42)&#151;among them Robert Byron, Harold Acton, John Betjeman, Cecil Beaton, and Evelyn Waugh, who fell deeply in love with her and dedicated his novel <span class="italic">Vile Bodies</span> to her. After her first son, Jonathan, was born in 1930, her father-in-law bought the young couple Biddesden House in Wiltshire. Their second son, Desmond, was born in 1931.<br>
<br>In February 1932, at a twenty-first birthday party dinner given by one of her best friends, she met the politician <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/31477/', "Sir Oswald Ernald Mosley (1896&#150;1980)")</script>, then married to Lord Curzon's daughter, Cynthia (Cimmie). She was soon enthralled both by the man and his cause&#151;initially, largely, the alleviation of the chronic unemployment of the thirties, about which she felt strongly. By the time he launched the British Union of Fascists on 1 October 1932 her dedication to his political ideas was complete. She left Bryan Guinness, and set herself up in 2 Eaton Square, London (on 1 January 1933), as Mosley's mistress, Mosley having told her he would never leave his wife. In May 1933 Cimmie Mosley died, and almost immediately Mosley began an affair with her sister Baba (Lady Alexandra Metcalfe). Later that year Diana took her sister Unity to Munich to see at first hand the first Nazi party rally since Hitler's accession to power. In 1934 her own marriage was dissolved. Throughout the 1930s she visited Germany constantly, becoming a close friend of Hitler. She and Mosley married on 6 October 1936 in the Berlin drawing room of Hitler's propaganda minister, Joseph Goebbels. Hitler's wedding present was a signed photograph in a silver frame. News of the marriage was kept from family and friends&#151;and Baba Metcalfe&#151;until November 1938, after the birth of their first son, Alexander.<br>
<br>On the outbreak of the Second World War in September 1939 Sir Oswald Mosley was interned under defence regulation 18B. In July 1940, eleven weeks after the birth of their second son, Max, Diana&#151;who hastily stuffed Hitler's photograph under Max's cot mattress when the police came to arrest her&#151;was interned in Holloway prison, where Mosley was allowed to join her in December 1941 in makeshift married quarters. They grew vegetables in the deserted garden, Diana's sister Nancy sent in parcels of books, and, like all the detainees, they could order (off-ration) food from outside.<br>
<br>The Mosleys' release in November 1943 on grounds of Sir Oswald's ill health triggered widespread demonstrations of anger. They remained under house arrest until the end of the war, after which they were so ostracized that they decided to live abroad. They bought a house in co. Galway, Ireland, which burned down after two years; from 1951 they settled permanently at La Temple de la Gloire, a classical mini-ch&acirc;teau outside Paris where they entertained constantly, with a steady stream of visitors from England. Diana Mosley joined her husband in an unsuccessful publishing venture, Euphorion Books, edited a far-right magazine, <span class="italic">The European</span>, for six years, and supported his attempts to re-enter British politics, this time by exploiting anti-immigrant sentiment. An avid reader, she published many book reviews and several books, including her memoirs, <span class="italic">A Life of Contrasts</span> (1977), a biography of her Parisian neighbour and friend, <span class="italic">The Duchess of Windsor</span> (1980), and sketches of other friends, <span class="italic">Loved Ones</span> (1985). To the last she was beautiful, witty, adored (or hated), a profuse letter writer with a spiky, elegant style, fiercely defensive of her husband's views, and unrepentant about her friendship with Hitler. Her appearance on <span class="italic">Desert Island Discs</span> (choosing Wagner's <span class="italic">Ride of the Valkyries</span> as one of her records) on 26 November 1989 aroused strong and unfavourable reaction. She died in Paris on 11 August 2003 of a heart attack, a week after suffering a stroke, and was survived by her four sons.<br>
