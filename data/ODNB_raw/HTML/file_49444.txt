<span class="headword">Timbrell,  Benjamin</span>  (<em>c.</em>1683&#150;1754), <span class="occ">carpenter and builder</span>, was one of the most noted master builders working in London in the first half of the eighteenth century. He may have been the son of Benjamin and Elizabeth Timbrell, who were living in Westminster in the mid-1680s, but his date and place of birth have not been traced. On 21 December 1707, when he was about twenty-four years old and living in the parish of St James, Piccadilly, he married Mary Salter at St James's Church. They had several children, a number of whom died in infancy.<br>
<br>Timbrell took part in most of the major developments which led to a vast expansion of west London in the early Georgian period. What tended to set his work apart from that of the generality of speculative builders was the size and splendour of the houses he erected in the vicinity of Hanover Square, on the Grosvenor estate (where he built at least ten very substantial houses including two in Grosvenor Square), in Sackville Street, and on the Burlington estate near Piccadilly, and in St James's Square.<br>
<br>As a carpenter he worked (with Thomas Phillips) on the construction of St Peter's Church, Vere Street (1721&#150;4) and St Martin-in-the-Fields (1722&#150;6). He was one of the initial vestrymen of the parish of St George, Hanover Square, and helped to erect several buildings for the parish. Like many another master builder, he was perfectly capable of designing a building, as at nos. 1&#150;3 Crown Office Row, Inner Temple (dem.), which he built in 1737&#150;8, and, of the four developers who undertook the construction of the charming Grosvenor Chapel in South Audley Street in 1730&#150;31, he is the most likely to have provided the design. He was also responsible in 1743 for the fitting up of Leicester House, Leicester Square, for the prince of Wales, and in 1750 for alterations to Charterhouse School in Clerkenwell. Although the vast bulk of his work was in London, he is known to have undertaken some work elsewhere, as at Huntingdon, where he built the town hall, possibly to his own designs, in 1745.<br>
<br>Timbrell lived from 1729 to 1751 at 12 Upper Grosvenor Street, Mayfair, a house built, naturally, by himself. He died on 6 January 1754, and was buried on 25 January, probably at St George's, Hanover Square. His wife had shortly predeceased him, and he had six surviving children. His eldest son, William, followed his father's trade of carpenter and builder. One of his daughters, Martha, who had also married a builder, claimed in a lawsuit that at his death Benjamin Timbrell had owned freehold land and houses to the value of &pound;1000 per annum, and leasehold property (including &#145;several large and magnificent dwelling houses&#146;) and personal effects worth &pound;20,000, but that his executors were defrauding her by pretending that he died in mean and low circumstances  (TNA: PRO, C12/356/33). It is likely that he did own a considerable amount of property, but that, as was often the case even with successful builders, it was heavily mortgaged.<br>
