<span class="headword">Rainier,  Peter</span>  (1741&#150;1808), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, was born on 24 November 1741 at the parish of St Mary's, Sandwich, the son of Peter Rainier of Sandwich and Sarah (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Spratt). His grandfather was Daniel Rainier, a Huguenot refugee who settled in Ramsgate following the revocation of the edict of Nantes and established himself as a merchant in the surrounding area.<br>
<br>Rainier attended a school in Tonbridge in 1754. He entered the navy in 1756, joining the <i>Oxford</i> from which, in February 1758, he moved to the <i>Yarmouth</i> and, on her arrival in the East Indies in March 1758, to the <i>Tiger</i> (60 guns) in which he was present in the actions of 29 April and 3 August 1758 and 10 September 1759 fought off the Coromandel coast against the French admiral the comte d'Ach&eacute;. In June 1760 he was moved to the <i>Norfolk</i>, flagship of Rear-Admiral Charles Steevens at the siege of Pondicherry. Steevens died in April 1761 and was succeeded by Vice-Admiral Samuel Cornish, who commanded at the reduction of Manila in September to October 1762, continuing to use the <i>Norfolk</i> as his flagship. The <i>Norfolk</i> returned to England in 1764 and was paid off. Rainier had no further service in the navy until 1774 and it is possible that he was employed by the East India Company during this time. He passed his lieutenant's examination on 2 February 1768 and was promoted lieutenant on 26 May 1768, and appointed to the <i>Maidstone</i> (under Captain Alan Gardner) in the West Indies in January 1774.<br>
<br>On 3 May 1777 Rainier was promoted by Vice-Admiral Clark Gayton to command the sloop <i>Ostrich</i> and in her he captured a large American privateer on 8 July 1778 after a hard fought action in which he was severely wounded. In approval of his conduct the Admiralty promoted him post captain on 29 October 1778 and appointed him to the <i>Burford</i> (64 guns) in January 1779. The <i>Burford</i> was part of Sir Edward Hughes's squadron which sailed for the East Indies on 7 March 1779. The <i>Burford</i> took part in all the operations of the war against Haidar Ali including the reduction of Negapatam in November 1781 and Trincomalee in January 1782, where a large quantity of military stores was captured. After the arrival of Admiral Suffren five major actions were fought against the French, a series unique in naval history where the same commanders and mostly the same ships confronted each other in this way. After the peace the <i>Burford</i> returned to England and Rainier went on half pay.<br>
<br>In 1790&#150;91 Rainier commanded the <i>Monarch</i> in the channel and then, early in 1793, he commissioned the <i>Suffolk</i> (74 guns), in which, in the following year, he went to the East Indies as commodore and commander-in-chief. He took with him a large convoy completing a remarkable passage in which he arrived at Madras in November 1794 having made no landfall during the voyage. He remained on the East India station as commander-in-chief until 1805 during which time he assisted at the reduction of Trincomalee, which led to the surrender of all the Dutch posts in Ceylon, in August 1795, and took possession of Amboyna on 10 February 1796 and Banda Neira on 8 March. These captures produced vast booty, the admiral's share of which laid the foundation of his princely fortune. His principal duty in this command, which he discharged effectively, was to provide for the safety of the British settlements and the security of the British trade. Rainier was promoted vice-admiral of the blue on 14 February 1799 and vice-admiral of the red on 23 April 1804. Following his return to England in 1805 and retirement from active service, he continued to be consulted by the ministry on questions relating to the East India station. In the Trafalgar promotion of 9 November 1805 he was made admiral of the blue.<br>
<br>Rainier was returned to parliament in May 1807 as member for Sandwich. He died at his house in Great George Street, Westminster, on 7 April 1808 and was buried in Sandwich, probably at St Mary's Church. Rainier died an immensely wealthy man. Probate was given for &pound;250,000  (PROB 11/1480) and, after some minor bequests, he gave one-tenth of his fortune towards a reduction of the national debt in gratitude for his service with the navy in the East Indies where he &#145;acquired the principal part of my fortune I now have which has far exceeded my merits and pretensions&#146;  (PROB 11/1480). Rainier was not married and he left the bulk of his fortune to his nephews, Admiral John Spratt Rainier (<i>d</i>. 1822) and Captain Peter Rainier CB (<i>d</i>. 1836).<br>
