<span class="headword">Urquhart,  Robert Elliott <span class="st"> [Roy]</span></span>  (1901&#150;1988), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was born in Shepperton on 28 November 1901, the eldest in the family of three sons and one daughter of Alexander Urquhart MD, physician, and his wife, Isabel Gillespie. After attending St Paul's School and the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, he was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Highland light infantry in 1920. Two years at the Staff College, Camberley (1936&#150;7), were followed by staff appointments in India&#151;staff captain (1938), deputy adjutant and quartermaster-general at army headquarters (1939&#150;40), and deputy assistant adjutant-general and assistant adjutant and quartermaster-general, 3rd division (1940&#150;41), until he was given command of the 2nd battalion of the Duke of Cornwall's light infantry in 1941. In 1942 he became general staff officer grade 1 of the 51st Highland division and went through the campaign in north Africa which destroyed the Afrika Korps. He was given command of 231st brigade in Malta in 1943, and its distinguished performance in Sicily and Italy brought him appointment to the DSO.<br>
<br>Urquhart was then brigadier, general staff, of 12th corps and was chosen in 1944 for command of the 1st airborne division. He led it in operation Market Garden, which was designed to cross three main river obstacles in the Netherlands in September 1944 and to join up with 30th corps arriving from the south, to swing through into the German industrial heartland. Since Urquhart was over 6 feet tall, of robust build, and possibly at forty-two rather too old for parachuting, he moved into battle by glider. He faced immediate difficulties. British troops arrived in a piecemeal fashion over three days and had to move 5 miles to their allotted positions around Arnhem. Their route was blocked by German armour reorganizing after Normandy, and, to compound the difficulties, the Germans captured the plans of the entire operation on the body of an American soldier shot down in a glider. Communications were rarely satisfactory and the weather was atrocious, making air support and replenishment difficult. The worst stroke of ill luck was Urquhart's enforced absence (he was obliged to take refuge in the attic of a house surrounded by German troops) from his headquarters for thirty-six hours soon after his arrival, when decisive command was imperative and was lacking. Urquhart made mistakes: the high ground at Wester Bouwing, for example, dominating the divisional bridgehead, and the heavy ferry at Heveadorp were never secured, but he fought a great battle. The high morale of the troops under his command reflected his own, but the battle of Arnhem was a defeat for the British and the advance of 30th corps was delayed. The remnants of Urquhart's division, withdrawn on 25 September 1944 across the lower Rhine, numbered some 2600 men of the 10,000 he had brought in.<br>
<br>Urquhart, appointed CB after Arnhem (1944), was next used to command an <i>ad hoc</i> airborne force, styled 1st airborne division, which was sent to Norway to rescue King Haakon, but his division was never reconstituted and was disbanded in November 1945. He became a colonel in 1945 and major-general in 1946. He was awarded the Netherlands Bronze Lion (1944) and Norwegian order of St Olaf (1945).<br>
<br>Urquhart's career thereafter puzzled and disappointed many who knew his qualities. For fourteen months while the Territorial Army was being reorganized he was its director-general (1945&#150;6). He was general officer commanding, 16th airborne division, Territorial Army (1947&#150;8), and commander, lowland district (1948&#150;50). In 1950 he was given command of 17th Gurkha division in Malaya and in the same year became general officer commanding, Malaya. He moved to Austria in 1952 for three years as general officer commanding-in-chief of British troops, in an agreeable if uninspiring assignment which was his last in the service. From 1954 he was colonel of his regiment, the Highland light infantry, but when the army council decreed its amalgamation with the Royal Scots Fusiliers in 1957 he became embroiled in a disagreement which concerned style, title, and above all dress. Would the new regiment be in kilt or trews? The two colonels negotiated an agreement, with the lord Lyon's support, that the kilt should be worn with the tartan dress Erskine. The War Office insisted on trews and both colonels had to go (1958).<br>
<br>After Urquhart's retirement from the army in December 1955 he lived for some years at Drymen in Stirlingshire and thereafter at Bigram, Port of Menteith, nearby. In 1957 he joined the Davy and United Engineering Co., where his sound judgement and administrative experience found useful scope, first as personnel manager and then as director, in an industrial environment whose technical aspects were not perhaps among his deepest interests. He moved into complete retirement in 1970.<br>
<br>In 1939 Urquhart, always known as Roy, married Pamela, daughter of Brigadier William Edmund Hunt Condon, of the Indian army. They had one son and three daughters. Urquhart died on 13 December 1988 at his home in Port of Menteith. He was survived by his wife.<br>
