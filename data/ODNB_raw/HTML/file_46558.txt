<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Hill,  Georgiana</span>  (1858&#150;1924), <span class="occ">historian and women's rights activist</span>, was born at 9 Mount View, Lambeth, London, on 8 December 1858, the younger daughter of George Hill (1822&#150;1897), a master printer, journalist, and newspaper proprietor, and his wife, Emily, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Kitson (1815&#150;1894). Her father was founder and editor of a local newspaper, the <span class="italic">Westminster and Lambeth Gazette</span>, and was active in local politics, representing Lambeth on the Metropolitan Board of Works. Nothing is known of her early education, but the family was clearly close-knit, and Georgiana lived and worked for the rest of her life with her elder sister, Emily Hill (1851/2&#150;1936): neither ever married. Both the Hill sisters became involved in a wide range of social and philanthropic movements, but also in the work of their father's business: on 15 January 1890, the <span class="italic">Englishwoman's Review</span> recorded that they had added a new department to his printing business, and were training women in composition, proof-reading, journalism, and other related trades. Georgiana and Emily were apparently already working as journalists themselves and were responsible for the &#145;Woman's Page&#146; in the <span class="italic">Westminster and Lambeth Gazette</span> until 1891, when their father retired.<br>
<br>Radical women's journals of the late Victorian period provide evidence of Georgiana Hill's advocacy of the rights of women workers. In September 1889 the <span class="italic">Englishwoman's Review</span> carried her letter urging the French municipal authorities to provide equal funding for women workers to attend the exhibition of that year in order to improve their skills. In 1896 <span class="italic">Hearth and Home</span> recorded that Georgiana had attended the Women's Congress in Berlin to give a paper on women poor law guardians (her father read it out for her); the journal's report of the congress was written by Emily. In the later 1890s, following the example of her father, Georgiana Hill headed a sustained campaign to get female representation on the board of management of the Royal Hospital for the Incurables, which was reported in the <span class="italic">Woman's Signal</span>. Her paper at the 1900 conference of the National Union of Women Workers focused on the issue of the work of women on hospital and other boards; it was jointly written with Louisa Stevenson, who sat on the women's sub-committee at the Royal Hospital.<br>
<br>In 1893 Hill published <span class="italic">A History of English Dress from the Saxon Period to the Present Day</span>, a classic example of the cultural and social history publications characteristic of late nineteenth-century amateur women historians. Despite the title Hill's history did give brief coverage of Irish, Welsh, and Scottish costumes (at least until the eighteenth century), as well as limited attention to armour and ecclesiastical dress; she was also attentive to the distinctions between classes, recognizing that practicality and economy always dictated the dress of the lower orders (not necessarily to their disadvantage). She was systematically critical of extravagant, uncomfortable, and inconvenient fashions, suggesting that she was influenced by the late nineteenth-century dress reform movement. She praised seventeenth-century dress for both sexes as the most elegant and comfortable produced in the modern period, and suggested provocatively that medieval women's dress, which largely conformed to antique models, both following and flattering the figure, was to be preferred to modern modes.<br>
<br>Like her contemporary Charlotte Carmichael Stopes, Hill moved from criticism of women's dress to criticism of their historical and social position. In 1896 she published <span class="italic">Women in English Life from Medieval to Modern Times</span>, covering women's historical experience both chronologically and thematically, and exhibiting a particular interest in women's education and work. While Hill offered a largely liberal and progressivist narrative, in which the industrial revolution brought substantial benefits for her sex, she was as critical of modern as of medieval developments, and particularly sensitive to the varying experiences of women from different classes. She considered both feudalism and the medieval church as often negative in their impact on women's lives, believing both kept women in a position of inferiority, while even chivalry (which put women on a pedestal) failed to set them in the proper place&#151;as the companions and equals of men. Nevertheless, she identified the potential opportunities for medieval women of status in managing large estates, households, and religious communities, and praised convents for offering employment and education to single women, as well as social services to their surrounding communities (paralleling here the arguments of Lina Eckenstein, whose work on medieval female monasticism was published in the same year). She was even more impressed with medieval guilds which (despite their sometimes restrictive practices) treated women as the equals of men: here she drew on the work of the medievalist Lucy Toulmin-Smith.<br>
<br>While conscious of the increasing educational possibilities for &eacute;lite women during the Renaissance, Hill highlighted the negative effects of the dissolution of religious communities on women's education, highlighting in particular the absence of literacy among women from the lower orders. She was also critical of post-Reformation religion for failing to provide the opportunities for public social work which she believed the medieval church had afforded them, and to protect them from the consequences of both puritan fanaticism and superstitious belief in witchcraft. Although critical of many of the social tendencies of the seventeenth century (in particular the declining quality of &eacute;lite women's education and the poor role models for womanhood at the court of Charles II), she reserved her deepest condemnation for the eighteenth century, a period when she felt that advances in material prosperity were unmatched by any widespread improvement in women's intellectual or moral condition.<br>
<br>When she turned to the modern period in her second volume Hill was profoundly critical of the tendency of industrialization to limit working opportunities for middle class women by confining them to the domestic sphere, just as technological developments were emancipating them from household drudgery. Equally she was critical of the industrial exploitation of working-class women, who were&#151;in her opinion&#151;severed from their families and homes. She believed that the role of woman was both a public and a private one, as was also the case for her equal and companion, man: she was an equal rights, rather than a complementary, feminist. The second volume also offered, however, a wide-ranging description of the increasing opportunities open to middle-class women by the end of the century in the fields of education, exploration, medicine and nursing, literature and the arts, philanthropy, administration and local government, and business and trade. However, Hill did not offer an uncomplicated celebration of women's emancipation in her own era. She commented ironically on how nineteenth-century women had to fight to regain rights and opportunities that had previously been accorded them.<br>
<br>Hill's recognition of the costs as well as the benefits of increasing professionalization for women is a constant, contradictory antiphony to her catalogue of late Victorian women's achievements: she praises the emergence of institutions providing secondary and higher education for young women, but deplores the culture of &#145;cramming&#146; that participation in the examination system brings, suggesting that such &eacute;lite icons of sixteenth-century humanistic education as Lady Jane Grey had more genuine love of knowledge and deeper learning than contemporary female students. Similarly she suggests that the nineteenth-century professionalization of nursing, while largely a positive development, nevertheless prevented many women from continuing to exercise their traditional role as home apothecaries and domestic nurses for their own families and friends.<br>
<br>Many of Hill's insights into the losses as well as the gains of women over time&#151;which add critical nuance to what could have been a liberal narrative of progress&#151;have been confirmed by later historians of gender: her account of the disempowerment of the midwife as her work was professionalized and colonized by men, and her recognition that more women had access to the franchise in some way before nineteenth-century franchise reforms than after, have both been confirmed by more recent scholarship. The shaded optimism of Hill's account is particularly apparent in her final chapter, where she described the still unsuccessful campaign for women's suffrage.<br>
<br>In the early twentieth century Hill became a supporter of the ethical movement, and was a member of the committee of the Ethical Church, founded in a former Methodist chapel in Bayswater by the American-born freethinker and women's suffragist Stanton Coit. Following their parents' deaths she and her sister Emily, together with their cousin Emily Walton Fyfe (1853&#150;1926), a former headmistress of a girls' high school and lecturer at a college of physical education, formed a household in Wandsworth. Described as &#145;animated in manner and very good-looking&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 1 April 1924), she was a popular public speaker, largely on the history of costume. An address by her on wigs was broadcast on radio early in March 1924, shortly before her death, of pneumonia, at her home, 3 Blenkarne Road, Wandsworth, London, on 29 March 1924. She was buried in Wandsworth cemetery.<br>
<br>Georgiana Hill's contribution to the development of women's history was largely neglected until, in 1985, Joan Thirsk pointed out her omission from the original <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span>, and celebrated the &#145;clarity, force, and considered judgement&#146;  (Thirsk, xvi) apparent in her work (while understandably confusing her with her near contemporary, the cookery-book writer Georgiana Hill (1825&#150;1903)). Thirsk saw her as &#145;a bridge between those who had concentrated on royalty and those who were next to explore the history of middle- and working-class women&#146;  (ibid.). As a successor to the Strickland sisters and Mary Anne Everett Green, and the foremother of Alice Clark and Eileen Power, Hill was indeed aptly placed.<br>
