<span class="headword">Felton,  Thomas</span>  (1566<span class="mult">x</span>8&#150;1588), <span class="occ">Franciscan friar and martyr</span>, was born at Bermondsey Abbey, Surrey, the only son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9272/', "John Felton (d. 1570)")</script>, Catholic martyr, of Bermondsey Abbey, and his wife, a maid of honour to Mary I. His father was one of the wealthiest gentlemen in Surrey. His uncle was Edmund Felton. John Felton was executed in 1570 for nailing the papal bull <span class="italic">Regnans in excelsis</span> excommunicating Elizabeth I to the door of the bishop of London's palace. Thomas Felton had a sister.<br>
<br>As a boy, Felton served as a page to the Catholic gentlewoman Lady Elizabeth Lovel. His family sent him to be educated at the English College at Douai, then in exile at Rheims, when he was still very young. He progressed quickly, however, and received his clerical tonsure from Cardinal Louis de Guise, archbishop of Rheims, in 1583. He entered the order of Minims at Rheims, but shortly afterwards returned to England, in order to dispose of some possessions before settling at the monastery, or perhaps because he had become ill in the austere living conditions. Having recuperated, he tried to return to the continent, but was arrested and imprisoned in the Poultry compter, where he remained for about two years. He was finally released through the influence of an aunt, Mary Blount. Felton tried again to travel to France or Italy soon afterwards but was again apprehended and placed in Bridewell prison. This time Lady Lovel, by then herself a prisoner for her recusancy, was able to have him freed, but he was arrested again almost immediately while making a final attempt to flee to the continent. He was returned to Bridewell, and severely tortured, but refused to recant or submit to the authority of the queen.<br>
<br>At his trial at Newgate prison, Felton proclaimed that &#145;he had read divers chronicles, but never read that God ordained a woman should be supreme head of the Church&#146;  (Challoner, 140). He was found guilty and sentenced to death. He may have actually left his order by this time. On 28 August 1588 aged but twenty or twenty-one, he was hanged, drawn, and quartered near Brentford, Middlesex, alongside a priest named James Claxton or Clarkson. His family had secured the promise of a pardon for him, but it may have entailed compromising conditions, since Felton refused to accept it. He was perhaps inspired to persist in his beliefs by the example of his martyr father. His name appears on a 1588 official list of &#145;Persons to be executed&#146; with the note &#145;cul. refuse pardon&#146; (&#145;guilty, refused pardon&#146;; Pollen, 290). Felton's execution was part of the large-scale acceleration in the persecution of Catholics that immediately followed the defeat of the Spanish Armada, when the issue of recusants' conflict between religious and national loyalties became especially volatile.<br>
