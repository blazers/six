</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">MacMillan, Sir  Kenneth</span>  (1929&#150;1992), <span class="occ">choreographer</span>, was born on 11 December 1929 at Dunfermline, Fife, the youngest of five children (one of whom died in infancy) of William MacMillan (1891&#150;1946), labourer and cook, and his wife, Edith (1888&#150;1942), daughter of George Shreeve, of Ormesby (near Great Yarmouth) and his wife, Mary Anne (known as Raya).<h2>
<a name="Earlyyears"></a>Early years</h2>Kenneth MacMillan's parents met in Norfolk during the First World War, when his father's Scottish regiment was posted at Ormesby. William MacMillan took his growing family back to Scotland but moved to Great Yarmouth in 1935, in search of work. Kenneth went to Northgate infants' school, which was evacuated in 1940 to Upper Broughton in Nottinghamshire; homesick, he insisted on returning to Yarmouth, which was severely bombed during the battle of Britain. He won a scholarship at the age of eleven to Great Yarmouth grammar school, which had been evacuated to Retford, Nottinghamshire, but which allowed its pupils to return home in the holidays in spite of the continued bombing.<br>
<br>It was in Retford that MacMillan discovered ballet, thanks to a local dance teacher, Jean Thomas. He had learned Scottish dancing as a small child in Dunfermline and tap as a boy in Yarmouth, where he performed in end-of-the-pier talent shows and amateur concert parties to entertain the troops. Miss Thomas taught him ballet as well as tap and encouraged him to read about ballet in the local library. &#145;I was transported into a world which seemed so exotic to me, living at a time when death and destruction was an everyday occurrence&#146;  (<span class="italic">Shropshire Star</span>).<br>
<br>Later, when he became a choreographer, he was determined that the ballets he created should reflect the whole of human experience&#151;death, distress, political oppression, extreme psychological states, as well as the symbolic truths contained in fairy-tale ballets. His boyhood wartime memories inform certain of his works, such as <span class="italic">The Burrow</span> (1958), <span class="italic">Valley of Shadows</span> (1983), and <span class="italic">Gloria</span> (1980), which is dedicated to his father, gassed during the First World War. His mother's death in 1942, when he was twelve, also affected him deeply.<br>
<br>During term time in Retford, MacMillan performed in Jean Thomas's dance concerts as well as taking part in school plays. He kept his dancing activities as secret as he could from his schoolmates, although by the age of fourteen he was already determined to become a ballet dancer. When his grammar school returned to Great Yarmouth in 1944, he sought out a ballet teacher there, Phyllis Adams, who helped ensure that he was accepted by the Sadler's Wells Ballet School (later the Royal Ballet School) in 1945, when he was fifteen. On his return visits to Yarmouth he would try his hand at choreographing dances for Miss Adams's pupils. He saw his first ballets, danced by Ninette De Valois's Sadler's Wells company, at the New Theatre in London. When the company moved into the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, in 1946, he appeared, while still a student, in <span class="italic">The Sleeping Beauty</span>, which reopened the opera house.<h2>
<a name="Earlyprofessionalcareer19461954"></a>Early professional career, 1946&#150;1954</h2>His father died just as MacMillan became a founder member of De Valois's new junior company, first known as the Sadler's Wells Opera Ballet, then Theatre Ballet. It was originally intended as a nursery for young dancers and choreographers, who would then move to the senior company at Covent Garden&#151;as MacMillan did in 1948. He went on its first American tour, dancing the role of Florestan in the last act <i>pas de trois</i> in <span class="italic">The Sleeping Beauty</span> on the company's triumphant opening night in New York in 1949.<br>
<br>Although his career as a dancer was advancing well, MacMillan suffered increasingly from stage fright. De Valois granted him leave of absence early in 1952 and suggested he perform more informally with a small group headed by the young South African choreographer John Cranko. Their performances in Henley-on-Thames helped save the neglected Kenton Theatre, which had been restored by the artist John Piper. During the successful summer season Cranko encouraged MacMillan's interest in choreography&#151;an ambition deferred in favour of dancing.<br>
<br>Cured of his stage fright, MacMillan rejoined the touring company, the Sadler's Wells Theatre Ballet, in September 1952. Opportunities to choreograph soon arose when the company set up a Sunday workshop under the direction of David Poole. MacMillan's first ballet, <span class="italic">Somnambulism</span>, was made at short notice in 1953, when a colleague dropped out of the first workshop performance. &#145;It even surprised me what it was like&#146;, MacMillan said in an interview  (Gruen). &#145;I thought when I started doing choreography it was going to be like things that everyone else had done. In point of fact, it came out unlike anything anybody had ever done&#146;  (ibid.).<br>
<br>Although dancers of this period, such as Maryon Lane and Pirmin Trecu, confirm that the spiky choreography was new-minted, MacMillan was influenced in his early work by modern ballets of the forties and fifties&#151;in particular, those by Roland Petit and Janine Charrat, danced by visiting French companies, and by Jerome Robbins and Antony Tudor, performed by Ballet Theatre (soon to become American Ballet Theatre). MacMillan also acknowledged the influence of Frederick Ashton, the Royal Ballet's founder-choreographer. &#145;I certainly learned craftsmanship from him since, when I was a dancer, I was in a lot of his ballets and I saw how a ballet was made&#146;  (MacMillan, 9).<br>
<br>MacMillan soon consolidated his initial success by creating <span class="italic">Laiderette</span> (1954) for the Choreographic Group. Although De Valois found its harpischord music by Frank Martin unsuitable for inclusion in the touring company's repertory, Marie Rambert snapped up <span class="italic">Laiderette</span> for her Ballet Rambert, which continued to perform it, to recorded music, until 1967. De Valois promptly commissioned MacMillan's first work for Sadler's Wells Theatre Ballet, <span class="italic">Danses concertantes</span> (1955), to Igor Stravinsky's music of the same name. Designs by Nicholas Georgiadis, then a young theatre designer at the Slade School of Art, marked the start of a long collaboration between the two men.<h2>
<a name="Choreography19551965"></a>Choreography, 1955&#150;1965</h2>
<blockquote>His professional debut with <span class="italic">Danses concertantes</span> showed a talent seething with ideas, bursting to find new ways of using the classical vocabulary &hellip; the intoxicating feeling of dance that bubbled wittily and imaginatively, and in such profusion. (Crisp, &#145;Kenneth MacMillan&#146;, 6)</blockquote>Confident that MacMillan had found his vocation, De Valois agreed that he should give up dancing and become a resident choreographer for the touring company. It presented a programme entirely of his work, including <span class="italic">House of Birds</span> and <span class="italic">Solitaire</span>, in June 1956. &#145;The evening left one in no doubt of MacMillan's arrival among the few creative choreographers&#146;, in the opinion of a reviewer  (<span class="italic">Ballet Annual</span>). He was commissioned to create <span class="italic">Noctambules</span>, his first work for the senior Covent Garden company, in 1956, before taking leave of absence to work with American Ballet Theatre, choreographing <span class="italic">Winter's Eve</span> and <span class="italic">Journey</span> for that company's dramatic ballerina, Nora Kaye.<br>
<br>On his return after five months in New York, MacMillan set about creating <span class="italic">The Burrow</span> (1958), the first of his signature flesh-and-blood ballets. It was also the first time he used Lynn Seymour, the Canadian dancer who was to become his muse. <span class="italic">The Burrow</span>, which deals with a group of oppressed people living in terror of &#145;the knock on the door&#146;, has similarities with the story of Anne Frank. It was also a response to the new realism of films and plays of the time.<blockquote>Little of what I was seeing then [in ballet] had any contact with a real world of feeling and human behaviour. I wanted to make ballets in which an audience would become caught up with the fate of the characters I showed them. (Crisp, &#145;The man who makes&#146;)</blockquote>Audiences and critics responded enthusiastically: &#145;Controversial and stimulating&#146;, wrote Clive Barnes, &#145;this piece [<span class="italic">The Burrow</span>] seems a landmark destined to do for ballet what <span class="italic">Look Back in Anger</span> did for the theatre&#146;  (<span class="italic">Daily Express</span>).<br>
<br>Although MacMillan went on to choreograph <span class="italic">The Invitation</span> (1960), with its graphic depiction of the rape of a young girl (Lynn Seymour), he had also made <span class="italic">Le baiser de la f&eacute;e</span> in the same year with Seymour&#151;a response to Stravinsky's score, whose fairy-tale scenario deals with the isolation of the artist from human relationships. However emotionally searing MacMillan's work became in the years that followed, he never totally abandoned the conventions of classical ballet. The two seemingly divergent strands of gritty expressionism and other-worldly fantasy coincided towards the end of his life, when he choreographed <span class="italic">Prince of the Pagodas</span> (1989), with another elusive fairy-tale scenario, and <span class="italic">The Judas Tree</span> (1992), which includes a gang rape and a lynching.<br>
<br>MacMillan developed yet a third strand, the plotless ballet, almost as non-representational as its music. After the early <span class="italic">Danses concertantes</span> he went on to choreograph the pure-dance <span class="italic">Diversions</span> and <span class="italic">Symphony</span> in the sixties, as well as two big, ambitious ballets, <span class="italic">The Rite of Spring</span> and <span class="italic">Song of the Earth</span>. The Royal Opera House board of governors objected to the use of Mahler's music for a ballet, so MacMillan created <span class="italic">Song of the Earth</span> for the Stuttgart Ballet in 1965, before it was brought into the Royal Ballet's repertory a year later. The same objections were later raised against his use of Faur&eacute;'s music for <span class="italic">Requiem</span> (1976), his memorial to John Cranko, late artistic director of the Stuttgart Ballet (MacMillan created six works in all for the Stuttgart company). <span class="italic">Requiem</span> was eventually danced by the Royal Ballet in 1983.<br>
<br>In an interview in 1963 MacMillan recognized a prevailing theme in his ballets: &#145;The more I look at my work, the more it seems that, unwittingly, I choose the lonely, outcast, rejected figure &hellip; it seems to happen unconsciously, as a sort of leitmotif&#146;  (MacMillan, 6). His first three-act ballet, however, commissioned by the Royal Ballet for February 1965, was based on the familiar story of <span class="italic">Romeo and Juliet</span>, to Prokofiev's score. MacMillan already knew Cranko's version for Stuttgart and the Russian production by Leonid Lavrovsky, which had been one of the hits of the Bolshoi's first London season in 1956. But he was determined to bring his own vision of Shakespeare's tragedy to the Royal Opera House stage, with Lynn Seymour and Christopher Gable as the young lovers. &#145;Their&#146; <span class="italic">Romeo and Juliet</span> was to be as emotionally immediate as <span class="italic">West Side Story</span>, while retaining the formal grandeur of a classical ballet. Georgiadis was once again MacMillan's choice of designer.<br>
<br>Seymour and Gable worked closely with the choreographer: their ideas, as well as their physiques and personalities, formed the way the ballet evolved. However, Rudolf Nureyev and Margot Fonteyn were the first-night Romeo and Juliet. Such starry casting in an unproven full-length ballet was a condition for the company's forthcoming American tour, as well as for Paul Czinner's film of the production, made a few months after the premi&egrave;re.<br>
<br>Although <span class="italic">Romeo and Juliet</span> was a huge success with Fonteyn and Nureyev (and the casts that followed), MacMillan felt betrayed by the Royal Ballet management, as did Seymour. Gable, equally disillusioned, gave up dancing for an acting career. MacMillan accepted an offer from the Deutsche Oper in West Berlin to run its ballet company&#151;a decision endorsed by Sir Frederick Ashton, then director of the Royal Ballet. &#145;I might not have gone if Fred had said I was too valuable to lose&#146;, MacMillan told a friend, Gilbert Vernon, &#145;but he didn't even try to stop me&#146;  (private information).<h2>
<a name="Choreography19661980"></a>Choreography, 1966&#150;1980</h2>MacMillan left for Berlin in 1966, taking several colleagues with him, including Seymour as his new company's ballerina. It was not a happy experience, though MacMillan created works for the company, including <span class="italic">Concerto</span> and <span class="italic">Anastasia</span> (the one-act version) that have been performed by many companies, as well as mounting his own productions of <span class="italic">Swan Lake</span> and <span class="italic">The Sleeping Beauty</span>. He found the bureaucracy of a German opera house hard to handle, especially since ballet did not seem a priority. He did not speak German, so he felt cut off from films, theatre, and the outside world: Berlin was a divided city, the western part an allied-controlled enclave. MacMillan became increasingly isolated as his imported entourage moved away to live independent lives.<br>
<br>He had been consulting a psychiatrist before he left for Berlin, suffering from the depression and anxiety attacks that were to dog him all his life. Berlin exacerbated his problems, as did his dependence on alcohol and cigarettes. He had a minor stroke in 1969 from which he soon recovered, shortly after the end of his Berlin appointment. He had already been designated the next artistic director of the Royal Ballet in 1970, after Sir Frederick Ashton's reluctant retirement.<br>
<br>Relations with the Royal Ballet's staff and dancers during the difficult period of transition had been made even more awkward for MacMillan by the opera house management's decision to reorganize its two ballet companies. The touring company was reduced to a small group of soloists: jobs were lost; the re-formed administrative structure of the merged companies was ambiguous, leading to rows and resignations.<br>
<br>MacMillan succeeded, however, in broadening the Royal Ballet's repertory still further by introducing works by other choreographers. Many of his own creations, including a three-act version of <span class="italic">Anastasia</span>, were not initially well received. As they were revived, they were viewed more favourably. None the less, it would take seventeen years before his <span class="italic">Manon</span> (1974) was regarded as a modern classic, danced by companies all over the world. Critics of the time were sharply divided over his achievements: his ballets and his artistic policy were attacked by sections of the press in Britain and the United States. During this testing period, he met Deborah Williams, an Australian artist; they married in 1973 following the birth of their daughter, Charlotte.<br>
<br>After seven years as director of the Royal Ballet, MacMillan resigned in 1977 in order to concentrate on choreography. His fourth full-length ballet, <span class="italic">Mayerling</span> (1978), investigated the tormented psyche of Crown Prince Rudolf and his suicide pact with his young mistress, Mary Vetsera. Scenarios for MacMillan's new one-act ballets were also dark: a disturbed family in <span class="italic">My Brother my Sisters</span>, a lunatic asylum in <span class="italic">Playground; Valley of Shadows</span> (based on the novel and film of Giorgio Bassani's <span class="italic">The Garden of the Finzi-Continis</span>) included scenes in a Nazi concentration camp. <span class="italic">Different Drummer</span> told the story of George B&uuml;chner's <span class="italic">Woyzeck</span>, another example of man's inhumanity to man.<br>
<br>MacMillan's dance-drama <span class="italic">Isadora</span> (1981), recreating Isadora Duncan's extravagant life in dance and dialogue, was regarded as an experiment that failed. Although his ballets during this period elicited fine performances, they were not to the taste of an increasingly conservative audience at the Royal Opera House. Televised versions of his work were more successful, including a documentary about <span class="italic">Mayerling</span> (London Weekend Television, 1978), and another, <span class="italic">A Lot of Happiness</span> (Granada, 1981), about the process of creating choreography. MacMillan also directed professional theatre productions of August Strindberg's <span class="italic">The Dance of Death</span> and Tennessee Williams's <span class="italic">Kingdom of Earth</span>, with mixed results.<br>
<br>MacMillan was knighted in 1983 but felt increasingly that his work, challenging the boundaries of ballet, was ill-appreciated in Britain. He accepted an invitation in 1984 to become artistic associate of American Ballet Theatre, where Mikhail Baryshnikov was then artistic director. MacMillan travelled to the United States to supervise American Ballet Theatre's stagings of his ballets, including <span class="italic">Romeo and Juliet</span> and a production of <span class="italic">The Sleeping Beauty</span>, as well as two new works for the company, <span class="italic">Wild Boy</span> and <span class="italic">Requiem</span> (to Andrew Lloyd Webber's music). He retained his links with the Royal Ballet, remaining its principal choreographer, while forging new ones with the Australian Ballet and Houston Ballet. During this period of frequent travel, his health deteriorated and he suffered a heart attack in Australia in 1988.<h2>
<a name="Lastyears19891992"></a>Last years, 1989&#150;1992</h2>Aware that he was living on borrowed time, MacMillan returned to enter a new creative phase with the Royal Ballet. He started work on a long-deferred three-act ballet, <span class="italic">Prince of the Pagodas</span>, to Benjamin Britten's score. It was to star nineteen-year-old Darcey Bussell in her first major role in 1989. He acquired yet another muse in the former Bolshoi principal dancer, Irek Mukhamedov, who joined the Royal Ballet in 1991. MacMillan choreographed a gala <i>pas de deux</i> for Bussell and Mukhamedov, which became the core of his <span class="italic">Winter Dreams</span> ballet. His last creation, apart from the dances for the National Theatre's 1992 production of the musical <span class="italic">Carousel</span>, was <span class="italic">The Judas Tree</span>, with Mukhamedov as the brutal anti-hero. Controversial to the end, MacMillan invented a tortured, symbolic scenario, built around guilt, betrayal, and murder on a construction site by Canary Wharf, then under development in the East End of London.<br>
<br>By the time of his death MacMillan's reputation as a choreographer had spread worldwide. His ballets, particularly the dramatic, narrative works, have been danced by an increasing number of companies. Roles such as Juliet, Manon, Rudolf, and Mary Vetsera have proved open to interpretation by many dancers from different backgrounds. The Royal Ballet has continued to claim him as its great creative force, along with Frederick Ashton; their ballets have forged its distinctive identity. He was awarded an honorary doctorate by Edinburgh University in 1976 and by the Royal College of Art in 1992.<br>
<br>MacMillan died of a heart attack, backstage, during the first night of the Royal Ballet's revival of <span class="italic">Mayerling</span> in the Royal Opera House on 29 October 1992. The announcement of his death was made on stage at the end of the ballet&#151;an extraordinarily dramatic, public conclusion to a life in the theatre. He was cremated in London on 6 November 1992; a memorial service was held in Westminster Abbey on 17 February 1993.<br>
