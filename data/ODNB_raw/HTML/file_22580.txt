<span class="headword">Porter,  Walter</span>  (<em>c.</em>1587&#150;1659), <span class="occ">composer and church musician</span>, was, according to Anthony Wood, the son of Henry Porter, who graduated BMus from Christ Church, Oxford, in 1600. The year of his birth is uncertain, for although he signed a petition to the governors of Westminster School (probably in 1658) in which he described himself as &#145;being 70:tie and odd yeeres of age his strength and faculties decayed&#146;, he may be the Walter Porter for whom there is a marriage licence dated 1630, in which case he was born in 1594 or 1595.<br>
<br>As a chorister of Westminster Abbey, Porter sang at the funeral of Queen Elizabeth in 1603, and, after his voice broke, as a tenor in George Chapman's Middle Temple and Lincoln's Inn masque (1613). He was promised the next tenor vacancy in the Chapel Royal on 5 January 1617, and the following year was duly sworn in (1 February). Already he may have travelled to Italy to study under &#145;my good Friend and Maestro <i>Monteverde</i>&#146; (as he stated in the preface to his <span class="italic">Mottets</span>), for his madrigal on the death of Lady Arabella Stuart (<i>d</i>. 1615), &#145;Wake sorrow, wake&#146;, shows signs of a new approach to madrigal writing which he would have experienced in Italy.<br>
<br>Porter was granted a licence to travel abroad for three years on 12 March 1622, but this was probably in connection with the earl of Bristol's embassy to Madrid to arrange the &#145;Spanish match&#146;. In gratitude &#145;for all your rare goodnesse in my attendance in <i>Spaine</i>&#146; Porter dedicated his <span class="italic">Madrigales and Ayres</span> (1632) to the earl. As a member of the Chapel Royal, Porter went to Scotland for the coronation of Charles I in 1633, and in February 1634 took part in Shirley's masque <span class="italic">The Triumph of Peace</span>, as both a singer and a theorbo player. In 1639 he was appointed master of the choristers of Westminster Abbey.<br>
<br>With the disbandment of musical services at both the Chapel Royal and the abbey during and following the civil war, Porter lived in the household of Sir Edward Spencer between 1644 and 1656. His <span class="italic">Mottets of Two Voyces</span> were published in 1657.<br>
<br>Porter wrote anthems, madrigals, and two-part settings of metrical psalms. Only one of the anthems survives complete&#151;the verse anthem &#145;O praise the Lord&#146;, with which the book of madrigals opens. It includes florid solo writing and reflects Italian influences, albeit applied to English words. The madrigals, too, borrow <i>concertato</i> techniques, mixing solo, duet, and dialogue textures. They include passages of quasi-recitative and virtuoso solo writing embellished with the Italian <i>trillo</i>. The &#145;continued base&#146; (in effect, basso continuo) is copiously figured and intended for realization on &#145;Harpesechord, Lutes, Theorbos&#146;. Full passages are doubled by instruments&#151;two violins and bass&#151;which also play introductory sinfonias, ritornellos, and &#145;toccatos&#146;, the last being sectional pieces that are virtually trio sonatas. Madrigals for two or three voices are in the Italian chamber style, while there are some airs or partsongs that are more traditional and tuneful. The <span class="italic">Mottets</span> are less interesting musically, and set metrical psalms by George Sandys in a rather dry declamatory style intended for domestic performance.<br>
<br>Porter's last years were spent in poverty, hence the petition already mentioned, in which he offered &#145;to sett up a meeting for Musick once a fortnight and to traine up two or three boyes in the Art of Musick &hellip; out of Westmr Schoole&#146;. He was buried at St Margaret's, Westminster, on 30 November 1659.<br>
