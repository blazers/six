</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Farquharson,  Joseph</span>  (1846&#150;1935), <span class="occ">landscape painter</span>, was born in Edinburgh on 4 May 1846, the fourth of at least five sons of Francis Farquharson (1802/3&#150;1876) and his first wife, Alison Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Ainslie (<i>d</i>. 1863). His father, laird of Finzean, Aberdeenshire, and by profession a doctor, in 1864 married his second wife, Mary Anne Girdwood. Francis Farquharson was a keen amateur artist whose own ambitions had been curtailed, on the grounds that painting was neither a dependable nor a lucrative profession. He encouraged his son's artistic talents, allowing Joseph to use his studio at weekends, when he was not attending to his more conventional schooling.<br>
<br>Joseph Farquharson's professional training began at the Board of Manufacturers School in Edinburgh and the life class run by the Royal Scottish Academy, where, at the age of thirteen, his first painting was exhibited, <span class="italic">A Study from Nature</span>, inspired by the woods at Finzean in the Dee valley. At the outset of his career he was influenced in his choice of subject and style by the established Scottish landscape painter and friend of the family Peter Graham (1836&#150;1921). From 1880 he spent three or four winters in the Paris atelier of the successful society portraitist Charles &Eacute;mile Auguste Duran, where he befriended the American painter John Singer Sargent. In the atelier Farquharson worked in oils directly from the life model, concentrating on colour and form. Landscape was not taught but many students visited the forest of Fontainebleau, made famous by the Barbizon school, to practise <i>plein air</i> painting, which required working directly from nature.<br>
<br>A trip to the Netherlands in 1874 with his fellow Scottish artist George Paul Chalmers was crucial to Farquharson's artistic development. He met the distinguished Hague school painter Jozef Isra&euml;ls, who was much admired in Scotland, and who introduced him to human pathos as an artistic subject. Farquharson was similarly struck by the daily tragedy of life, developing as his signature idiom not the suffering of men but the hardships endured by animals in the highlands. Farquharson's sheep in snowy landscapes, bathed in the glow of a setting sun or more rarely moonlight, secured his lasting fame; large editions of coloured prints published by Frost and Reed indicate that he captured the public's imagination. His trademark subject earned him the sobriquet Frozen Mutton Farquharson. <span class="italic">The Joyless Winter Day</span> (1883; Tate collection), bought by the Chantrey Bequest fund for &pound;250, exemplifies the genre:<blockquote>on a bleak and barren snow-covered Scotch moor a shepherd is driving home his flock. Muffled in his plaid the man seeks to save himself from the swirl of the eddying snow flakes, while the sheep half blinded by the darkened atmosphere yield ready obedience to his guidance. (Jackson, 154)</blockquote>To achieve a realistic result Farquharson used &#145;imitation&#146; sheep, made for him by William Wilson of Monymusk, which could be placed in a setting of his choice. A windowed hut, equipped with wheels and a stove, enabled him to paint in all weathers. By the 1920s he had several of these huts dotted about the Finzean woodlands, allowing him to work on a number of canvases simultaneously and thereby capturing changing light and atmospheric conditions. His desire to render modulated light may stem from his interest in photography; he was preoccupied by shadows, silhouettes, and the Scottish crepuscular &#145;gloaming&#146;. He often chose the glow of a setting sun to create his desired lighting and atmospheric effects, as suggested by such titles as <span class="italic">Day's Dying Glow</span> (1873; Aberdeen Art Gallery), <span class="italic">The Yellow Sun Declines, and with Long Rays and Shades the Landscape Shines</span> (1899; Leeds Art Gallery), <span class="italic">The Shortening Winter's Day is Near a Close</span> (1903; Lady Lever Art Gallery), <span class="italic">The Sun had Closed the Winter Day</span> (1904; Towneley Hall, Burnley), <span class="italic">When the West with Evening Glows</span> (1910; Bristol City Museum and Art Gallery), and <span class="italic">Afterglow</span> (1912; Aberdeen Art Gallery).<br>
<br>Farquharson's first work was accepted at the Royal Academy in 1873. Thenceforth he was a constant and prolific exhibitor, sending six works to the annual summer show in 1933. It was a heavy blow when, in 1914, his agent failed to deliver by the due date the five paintings he was entitled to exhibit. It was the only year from 1873 to 1935 that he was not represented. That his works were not considered &#145;great art&#146; may account for his late admission to the Royal Academy: he was elected an associate in 1900, academician as late as 1915, and senior Royal Academician in 1922. <span class="italic">When Snow the Pasture Sheets</span>, his diploma work accepted in 1915, illustrates his genuine feeling for nature, which found its fullest expression in the representation of the bleakness of winter.<br>
<br>Farquharson was aware of his limits, readily referring to himself as a &#145;commercial&#146; artist; a gillie opined, &#145;Mr Farquharson's pictures are just grand, they are almost as good as photographs&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 16 April 1935). This resemblance did not deter sales; the Fine Art Society of New Bond Street held a show of seventy highland and lowland Scottish scenes in 1893. His snowy sheep were also admired by Walter Sickert, who considered their on-the-spot vividness superior to Gustave Courbet's realist landscapes, though Farquharson was a &#145;guilty pleasure&#146;  (Sitwell, 205&#150;6). From 1885 he made several trips to Egypt in the company of his stepmother, and captured scenes of human activity, in markets and mosques, though even there he could not resist a depiction of sheep: in <span class="italic">He Drove them Wandering o'er the Sandy Way</span> (1891) the red heat of the sun, rather than snow, is distressing the flock.<br>
<br>Aged sixty-nine Farquharson married, at Banchory on 14 September 1914, Violet Evelyn (1888&#150;1971), daughter of James Toner Hay of Blackhall Castle, Banchory, Kincardineshire. In 1918 Farquharson succeeded his elder brother, Robert Farquharson (1836&#150;1918), a physician and Gladstonian Liberal MP for West Aberdeenshire (1880&#150;1906), as laird of Finzean. He managed the estates with the businesslike spirit with which he had conducted his artistic career, and held various offices including those of deputy-lieutenant of Aberdeenshire and chief of the Farquharson clan. In later years his subjects were increasingly restricted to his gardens at Finzean. He died at Finzean on 15 April 1935, and was buried at Birse. His work is held in numerous public collections. Aberdeen Art Gallery honoured Farquharson with an exhibition in 1985, also shown at the Fine Arts Society, to mark the fiftieth anniversary of his death; during his life Farquharson presented several works to the gallery. <span class="italic">The Silence of the Snows</span>, a film on the life and work of the artist, was commissioned at the same time.<br>
