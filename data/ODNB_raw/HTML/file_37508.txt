<span class="headword">Hythe <span class="st"> [Hethe]</span>,  Hamo</span>  (<em>b. </em><em>c.</em>1270, <em>d.</em> in or after 1357), <span class="occ">bishop of Rochester</span>, was born in the parish of St Leonard, Hythe, about 1270, the son of Gilbert and Alice Noble; his brothers were John and William (<i>d</i>. 1328). Professed as a Benedictine monk about 1302, in 1307 he became chaplain to Bishop Thomas Wouldham of Rochester. On the resignation of John Greenstreet in May 1314 he became prior of Rochester, and although rivals procured a visitation from the archbishop of Canterbury to the chapter, they failed to overturn his appointment.<br>
<br>Following Wouldham's death the monks of Rochester elected Hythe as bishop on 18 March 1317. On 19 March, however, Pope John XXII (<i>r</i>. 1316&#150;34) reserved the see for Giovanni di Puzzuoli, chaplain of Edward II's queen, Isabella. The contest between the two candidates was first fought out before cardinals Gaucelin and Luca (Fieschi) in England, but in 1318 the case was revoked to the papal curia at Avignon, where Hythe was himself constrained to go in early 1319. His biographer, as represented by the <span class="italic">Historia Roffensis</span>, attributes the protracted proceedings there to Hythe's unwillingness to bribe the cardinals (although it is clear that he retained at least Cardinal Guillaume Testa at the curia), as well as to the proliferation of other candidates with royal support. His election was confirmed on 21 July 1319, and he was consecrated at Avignon on 26 August. By the end of the year he had obtained livery of his spiritualities and temporalities, receiving the latter from Archbishop Walter Reynolds on 2 December and from the king on 5 December. He was enthroned on 13 January 1320. However he was engaged in a protracted and bitter dispute for over a year with Archbishop Reynolds over the sums Hythe claimed as due to him from the period during which the see of Rochester had been in the archbishop's hands. During this time Hythe was desperately pressed with debts and with the payment of his common service of 1450 florins to the curia, which he effected by February 1321.<br>
<br>Nothing in Hythe's episcopate matches the activity surrounding his election. His natural caution kept him on the political sidelines, although he was well placed to know what was going on at the highest level, as the <span class="italic">Historia Roffensis</span>, written by a clerk in his entourage, demonstrates. He excused himself from diplomatic assignments on the grounds of (often genuine) ill health and the poverty of his bishopric, and spent much time improving episcopal residences, especially at Halling and Trottiscliffe (both in north Kent). He appears as sympathetic to the regime of Edward II's last years and clearly distrusted the baronial opposition in 1321. In 1326 he advised the king against an attempt to divorce his wife, and was especially commended by Edward to Hugh Despenser the younger (<i>d</i>. 1326). Caught in London during the revolution of that year, he refused to join either John Stratford, bishop of Winchester (<i>d</i>. 1348), or the archbishop of Canterbury in embassies to Queen Isabella, and fled to Rochester. He was one of four prelates who refused to do fealty to Edward III in January 1327, although he took part in the new king's coronation in February. He is said to have affirmed his support for the new fourth clause of the coronation oath, under which the king swore to observe such laws and customs as should be approved by the community of the realm, at this time.<br>
<br>Hythe soon made his peace with the new regime, meeting the queen and the young king when they went on pilgrimage to Canterbury in Lent 1327. He refused to join Archbishop Simon Mepham (<i>d</i>. 1333) in his precipitate support for the opposition to the Mortimer regime. But when in June 1329 he was urged by Roger Mortimer, first earl of March (<i>d</i>. 1330), to serve on the council, he declined. In Lent 1330 he opposed a grant of clerical taxation to the regime of Mortimer and Isabella. His biographer comments that Hythe might have become treasurer in 1332 but for his reluctance to buy the office. In 1333 he rallied the men of the Cinque Ports to defend the country during Edward III's absence in Scotland, and throughout the early stages of the Hundred Years' War was inevitably involved in the organization of coastal defence. But he firmly eschewed political involvement and devoted his time to his diocese and to building. The new bell-tower at Rochester Cathedral was raised under his auspices. He clashed with the monks of Rochester on several occasions, and in Mepham's visitation of 1329 was accused of not preaching and of being impatient and irascible. But he supported Mepham in 1332 when the other prelates appealed to the curia. In 1333 he made a rare journey abroad to deliver the pallium to the new archbishop of Canterbury, John Stratford, at Rue in Ponthieu. From 1331 to 1336 he was engaged in a bitter dispute with Bishop William Airmyn of Norwich (<i>d</i>. 1336).<br>
<br>Illness prompted Hythe's resignation of the bishopric no later than 1352. He was succeeded by John Sheppey (<i>d</i>. 1360), whom he had himself chosen as prior in 1333. In June 1353, at Sheppey's request, Hythe was granted a papal pension of &pound;40. The grant specifies that he was more than eighty years old. He was still living in May 1357.<br>
