<span class="headword">Ventners,  Lawrence</span>  (<em>c.</em>1880&#150;1947), <span class="occ">bookmaker</span>, was a well-known figure in the Garscube Road area of Glasgow, but nothing is known about his birth or parents. In common with a significant number of other bookies locally, Ventners was a Roman Catholic. He was popularly known as Lawrie.<br>
<br>Since the passing of the <span class="roman">Betting Houses Act</span> in 1853 it had been unlawful to accept bets for cash in premises away from a racecourse. Bookmakers evaded the law by taking bets on the street, a practice which was outlawed by the <span class="roman">Street Betting Act</span> of 1906. To avoid capture by the police, bookies then moved their operations into more secluded spots, and Ventners, like other Glasgow bookmakers, worked in closes, the entrances to tenement buildings. These were well used and easily approached by &#145;punters&#146; (betters) but they could be well guarded by &#145;watchers&#146; (look-outs).<br>
<br>In a city rent by sectarianism and discrimination bookmakers, like public house owners, &#145;came disproportionately from among the first or second generation Irish Catholic immigrants&#146;  (McGlennan to Chinn, letter 1, 2). Condemned by establishment leaders in church and local government (but not by the Roman Catholic church) as immoral and unchristian, bookies were also depicted as parasites who leached off the working class and who encouraged unwise expenditure. Yet the life of Lawrie Ventners is in stark contrast to that bleak and unflattering portrayal. Ordinary Glaswegians, according to later oral testimony, looked on him as &#145;the &#147;patron saint&#148; of the neighbourhood&#146;  (Ditty to Chinn, letter 2, 2). He was recalled as being a man &#145;who was always helping someone with their financial troubles&#146;; and when he died &#145;the streets were black with mourners&#146;  (Moir to Chinn, letter 2, 5; <span class="italic">Daily Record</span> cutting). This positive view of Ventners was emphasized by a reporter who witnessed his funeral: the crowd was so great that mourners were six to eight deep on both sides of the street for its whole length. Every window was crammed with spectators and special police were on duty. The reporter learned that this was not just a gathering of Ventners' clients, it was &#145;the massed tribute of his friends, the humble folk of Garscube Road and the congested area around&#146;. People spoke of how Ventners had sent food to families in difficulties, of how he had saved others from eviction, and of how &#145;every week without fail a cripple received an envelope with enough in it to keep a roof over his head&#146;  (<span class="italic">Sunday Sun</span>, 15 June 1947).<br>
<br>A latter-day Robin Hood and working-class &#145;folk hero&#146;, Lawrie Ventners died in June 1947 and was buried in Glasgow on 15 June 1947.<br>
