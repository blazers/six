<span class="headword">Dickson,  James Douglas Hamilton</span>  (1849&#150;1931), <span class="occ">mathematician</span>, was born on 1 May 1849 at 144 Bath Street, Glasgow, the son of John Robert Dickson, physician; he was the elder brother of Lord Scott Dickson. Dickson attended Hale School. He was fifteen when he matriculated at Glasgow University, where he studied from 1864 to 1869 and graduated in 1870. During his time there, he studied Latin, Greek, logic, mathematics, natural philosophy, and ethics. After taking the degree of master of arts, with second-class honours in mathematics and natural philosophy from Glasgow, he was awarded the Eglington fellowship of Glasgow University from 1870 to 1871. At Glasgow he was under the tutelage of William Thomson. In 1867 Thomson employed Dickson in his laboratory for mathematical work on electricity to determine the relation between electromagnetic and electrostatic units of electricity. Together with W. F. King of Edinburgh and C. Cuttriss of Boston, Massachusetts, Dickson devised the apparatus and made the preliminary experimentation for Thomson's determination of &#145;V&#146; (the ratio of the electromagnetic to the electrostatic unit of electricity). Dickson also assisted Thomson with his work on deep-sea cables. Thomson made the first attempt to lay the French transatlantic cable in 1857, and until its completion in 1866 Dickson was engineer-in-charge, during which time he assisted Thomson to develop the siphon recorder for telegraph signals.<br>
<br>In 1870 Thomson urged Dickson to resign his appointment and go up to Peterhouse, Cambridge, to read mathematics. During much of the nineteenth century Peterhouse was a popular college for Scottish students and also had the reputation of being mathematical; Dickson was admitted as a pensioner on 4 July 1870, was coached for the mathematical tripos by Cambridge's chief mathematical coach, Edward John Routh (who was also at the college), and was bracketed fifth wrangler in 1874. Dickson rowed in the college boats and played in the cricket eleven. On 29 October 1874 he was elected to a fellowship which he held for life. When James Porter became master of Peterhouse in 1876, Dickson succeeded him as tutor and held this office from 1877 to 1897; he became senior fellow when Lord Kelvin died in 1907. Probably about 1878, he married Isabella Catherine, daughter of James Banks, an Edinburgh printer; they had a son and a daughter. (Dickson's brother and the chemist James Dewar married Banks's other two daughters.)<br>
<br>Dickson was also able to assist the statistician and eugenicist Francis Galton when the latter was working on his index of correlation and his regression coefficient. After Galton plotted the regression line from his mid-parental data, he discovered that the data took on the shape of two ellipses; he then wanted to find a single formula to express the results of this table from the ellipses. As he could not remember all the formulae of conic sections, he went up to Cambridge to meet Dickson who examined mathematically the system of concentric ellipses that would correspond to the ellipses described by Galton in his 1885 paper, &#145;Regression towards mediocrity in heredity stature&#146;. Dickson's calculations confirmed Galton's theory that the value of the mid-parental regression was very nearly one-third.<br>
<br>Dickson published occasional papers, principally on thermodynamics and thermoelectricity, which appeared in the <span class="italic">Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh</span>, <span class="italic">Philosophical Magazine</span>, and the <span class="italic">Proceedings of the London Mathematical Society</span>. He was also one of the three literary executors to whom was entrusted the publication of the collected papers of Sir James Dewar. He was a fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, and a member of the London Mathematical Society and of the Royal Institution.<br>
<br>Dickson's interests were varied. He became involved in a special study of Japan and the Japanese and assisted Genjiro Yamazaki (who was a student at Peterhouse) in the preparation of catalogues of the Japanese sword-hilts contained in Cambridge and Edinburgh. He contributed biographies of E. J. Routh, P. G. Tait, J. Hamblin Smith, and James Porter (all of whom were mathematicians and fellows at Peterhouse) to the <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span>. He was an enthusiastic musician who was for many years president of the Peterhouse Musical Society. Dickson died on 6 February 1931 at his home, 6 Cranmer Road, Cambridge, and was buried three days later in the chapel at Peterhouse. He was survived by his wife.<br>
