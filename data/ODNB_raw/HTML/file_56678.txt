<span class="headword">Stout,  William</span>  (1665&#150;1752), <span class="occ">grocer and ironmonger</span>, was born in March 1665 at Bolton Holmes, Lancashire, the second son and third of seven children born to William Stout (<i>d</i>. 1681), yeoman of Bolton Holmes, and his second wife, Elizabeth Dickinson (<i>c</i>.1632&#150;1716). William was baptized at Bolton-le-Sands, Lancashire, on 26 March 1665. He attended the free school at Bolton until he was fourteen, then from 1679 a school in Heversham, Westmorland, and finally, in 1681, Lancaster grammar school. His skill at arithmetic caused his father to apprentice him to Henry Coward, a grocer and ironmonger.<br>
<br>Coward was a prominent member of the local Society of Friends, and during his apprenticeship Stout attended the illegal meetings which were held at Coward's house. At one in 1685 he was so convinced by a &#145;plaine country farmer of Craven in Yorkshire&#146;  (<span class="italic">Autobiography</span>, 83) that he joined the Quakers, regardless of the possible adverse effect upon his career. For the rest of his life his moral conduct and motivation were shaped by this religious group.<br>
<br>At the end of his seven-year apprenticeship in 1687 Stout rented premises in Lancaster. Travelling with other local shopkeepers for mutual protection against highway robbery, he went to London, Northampton, Leicester, Sheffield, and Birmingham to purchase goods for setting up shop. From an outlay of &pound;300 he made &pound;50 profit in his first year. Stout took on an apprentice in 1690, and expanded his trade by buying up the goods of several retiring or insolvent shopkeepers. He increased his rented accommodation, and his sister Ellen, despite ill health, became his housekeeper and occasional shop assistant.<br>
<br>Stout's reputation for being honest and conscientious led to his frequent appointment as an executor of wills, an office to which he devoted considerable care and attention over many years. From 1698 to 1734 he was clerk and treasurer to the Lancaster Friends' monthly meeting, and local representative at the quarterly meetings. While these activities involved much clerical work, as well as accountancy and travel on behalf of the Friends, especially those who were imprisoned because of their beliefs, they also kept him informed about trade and industry throughout the country and particularly in the north-west. Furthermore his Quaker contacts assured him of reliability and integrity, an enviable strength for a tradesman.<br>
<br>Having averaged a profit of about &pound;100 a year in nine years' trading, Stout sold the shop to his finishing apprentice in 1697. From that time he occasionally speculated in overseas ventures, generally in the Virginian and West Indian trade, with one Norwegian voyage, but his investments were never very profitable. Several times he returned to retailing, once to help an old friend and twice to save two of his former apprentices from bankruptcy; and he increased his property ownership both by purchase and building. Stout never married, having failed in the one courtship he attempted, but was generous and long suffering&#151;if critical&#151;in support of his siblings and their families.<br>
<br>Stout's autobiography was probably written in later life from contemporary notes. It was first published in book form in 1851, having been serialized in the <span class="italic">Manchester Guardian</span>; it was republished in 1967. It provides a unique account of the life of an early modern shopkeeper. The manuscript reveals his preferred manner of trading: not taking his former master's customers, plain dealing with his purchasers, set prices with no bargaining. It also illuminates a host of other topics&#151;the relationship between industrial growth and dissent, the financial and ethical practices of retailers as well as their routines, the financial implications of the French war, the development of local industries, and the problems of the depreciation and recoinage. In it Stout shows the pragmatic measures adopted by community and family for physical and social survival, and notes price fluctuations in the same detached way that he comments on his neighbours; &#145;negligent and careless&#146;, &#145;indolent and sottish&#146; are his terms of condemnation, while &#145;improving&#146; is his greatest approbation.<br>
<br>Stout attributed his lifelong excellent health to a good plain diet, and at the age of seventy-eight made a remarkable recovery from injuries caused by a bolting horse. He died on 15 January 1752 at Lancaster and was buried in the Lancaster Friends' burial-ground on 19 January.<br>
