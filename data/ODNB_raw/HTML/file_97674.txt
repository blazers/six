<span class="headword">Rees,  Charles Wayne</span>  (1927&#150;2006), <span class="occ">organic chemist</span>, was born on 15 October 1927 in Cairo, Egypt, the son of a serving British soldier, later a civil servant, Percival Charles Rees, and his wife, Daisy Alice, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Beck. He was educated at Farnham grammar school. Working subsequently for the Royal Aircraft Establishment at nearby Farnborough as a laboratory technician, he developed a love for chemistry, obtained his higher school certificate (mainly by evening study), and became a chemistry undergraduate at the University College of Southampton. He gained a first-class honours degree in 1950 and then began work for a PhD under the supervision of Norman B. Chapman. Later studies under Adrien Albert (of the Australian National University, which had an outpost in London) led to the award of his PhD (Southampton) in 1953. On 19 December the same year he commenced a happy and enduring marriage to Patricia Mary (Tricia) Francis, the 22-year-old daughter of George Walter Francis, a representative of the tobacco manufacturers W. D. and H. O. Wills. They had three sons (David, George, and Michael). For years the family lived in Kensington after his appointment as assistant lecturer at Birkbeck College, London, in 1955.<br>
<br>After two years at Birkbeck, Rees moved to King's College, London, where he spent eight years (1957&#150;65) in the department chaired by the pioneer of free radical chemistry, Donald Hey. Free radicals are transient intermediates in chemical reactions where each molecule has an odd unpaired electron. Rees's later interest in free radicals must have dated from those years, though he also worked with Hey on different aspects of a branch of chemistry that he was later to make specially his own, that of heterocyclic compounds. In 1965 he was appointed professor of organic chemistry at the University of Leicester, and in 1969 moved to become professor of organic chemistry at Liverpool, succeeding George Kenner as Heath Harrison professor of organic chemistry in 1977. After one year as Harrison professor he was translated to the chair at Imperial College, London, named after another great pioneer in organic chemistry, A. W. Hofmann. He succeeded the Nobel laureate Sir Derek Barton, and finally retired from the chair in 1993. He was appointed emeritus professor and thereafter spent much time in his laboratory, unrestricted by regular teaching commitments.<br>
<br>Charles Rees was a rare example of a distinguished organic chemist who was popular with a wide range of chemists and historians of chemistry. He was closely associated with the Royal Society of Chemistry, formerly the Chemical Society. He delivered the Tilden lecture in 1974 and the Pedler lecture (reported in <span class="italic">Chemical Society Reviews</span>) ten years later. He served on many of its committees, including as chairman of its publication and information board for four years, and in 1982 became president of the Perkin division of the society, concerned with organic chemistry. The ultimate token of esteem came with his election to the presidency of the Royal Society of Chemistry itself (1992&#150;4). As president he went to great lengths to attend meetings of the smaller groups of the society and became widely known as a friend to all.<br>
<br>Rees's great preoccupation was with that sub-group of organic substances known as heterocyclic compounds. They are substances whose molecules contain a ring of atoms, one at least of these being other than carbon. He became familiar with the properties of many heterocyclic ring systems, not least the aziridines and azoles in their many forms. Many of the new compounds contained other elements in their rings as well as nitrogen, for instance sulphur or even selenium. He was particularly interested in the decomposition of heterocyclic compounds, including their responses to heating. For his work in this field he was awarded the Royal Society of Chemistry award in heterocyclic chemistry in 1980 and the International Society of Heterocyclic Chemistry senior award in 1995. This research frequently involved surprising reactions; they often seemed to proceed through a transient intermediate as a derivative of benzyne (C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>4</sub>). In 1965 Rees obtained evidence for benzyne in the oxidation of the heterocycle 1-aminobenzotriazine, and in the early 1970s he discovered a new route to benzynes using low temperatures. Sometimes other intermediates were identified, as free radicals like carbenes (by then well known elsewhere), or the less familiar nitrenes. He obtained these by pyrolysis of aziridines and showed their key role in many heterocyclic decompositions, employing them in several important syntheses.<br>
<br>Beyond the field of strict heterocyclic chemistry Rees was also concerned with aromaticity (a kind of stability, due to a number, usually six, of &#960;-electrons in the molecule). In that connection he succeeded in preparing for the first time derivatives of [10]annulene (or cyclodecapentaene) and other non-heterocyclic compounds to put current theories to rigorous test. Other work was centred on derivatives of the &#145;square&#146; molecule, cyclobutadiene, that showed the strange phenomenon of &#145;valence isomerism&#146;.<br>
<br>Much of Rees's work was entirely academic, yet even basic research in heterocyclic chemistry is relevant to living systems. Occasionally this became obvious, as when he participated in the discovery of cimetidine, a synthetic drug once used widely in the treatment of gastric ulcers. He claimed that this discovery saved the National Health Service a billion pounds and showed that academic chemistry, pursued for its own ends, could sometimes have important industrial or social consequences. Several other compounds of biological importance were also isolated.<br>
<br>Rees published about 500 papers, generally in collaboration with his research staff and others, and the <span class="italic">Annual Reports</span> of chemical progress for many years rarely failed to report his research. Some of these references were to prove immensely important for others in their future work. He contributed to many books and was a co-author of the seminal <span class="italic">Organic Reaction Mechanisms</span> (three volumes, 1965&#150;9), <span class="italic">Carbenes, Nitrenes and Arynes</span> (1969), the multi-volume <span class="italic">Comprehensive Heterocyclic Chemistry</span> (1984 and 1996), and <span class="italic">Organic Functional Group Transformations</span> (1995). Elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1974, he became president of the chemistry section of the British Association for the Advancement of Science in 1984. He received honorary doctorates from the universities of Leicester (1994), Sunderland (2000), and London (2003) and was appointed CBE in 1995.<br>
<br>Rees's devotion to academic chemistry showed itself in his frequent impromptu remarks at heterocyclic conferences, where his interventions were nearly always helpful, and in his lecturing technique, which was brilliant and deeply appreciated. He was always approachable and given to generous hospitality. Rarely seen in public without his customary bow-tie, he had a great sense of humour and was highly regarded by all who met him. He appreciated excellence in wine, music, and theatre. He died at his home, 67 Hillgate Place, Kensington, London, from cardiac arrest on 21 September 2006, and was survived by his wife, Tricia, and their three sons.<br>
