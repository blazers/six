<span class="headword">Harris,  Edmund Robert</span>  (1803&#150;1877), <span class="occ">lawyer and benefactor</span>, was born on 6 September 1803, probably at Preston, Lancashire, one of four children (three boys and a girl) of Robert Harris (1764&#150;1862), a Cambridge graduate and vicar of St George's Church, Preston (1798 to death), and headmaster of Preston grammar school (1788&#150;1835), and his wife, Nancy (1774&#150;1837), daughter of Edmund Lodge and Elizabeth Eccleston. He was probably educated at his father's school before he and his younger brother, Thomas (the oldest brother, Robert, died in infancy), were articled to their uncles Edmund and Jonathan Lodge's firm of solicitors in Chapel Street, Preston; the practice eventually passed to the two brothers. A solicitor from 1827, in 1848 Edmund Robert was appointed deputy prothonotary to the court of common pleas for Lancashire, which gave him responsibility for the general official business of the court. One of the superior courts in the county and sitting at the Lancaster assizes, the court of common pleas dealt with actions concerning lands, personal actions of Lancashire residents, and actions against corporations in the county. In 1865 Harris became the court's acting prothonotary and associate, assuming full title four years later. However, his responsibilities were reduced as new offices for the court were opened in Liverpool and Manchester, presumably in response to an expansion in business at a time of marked population growth. He was left in charge of the court's Preston office, with jurisdiction for the county's northern division.<br>
<br>On the death of their father in 1862 Edmund Robert Harris and his brother Thomas, neither of whom had married, moved from Ribblesdale Place in Preston to the town's newly emerging suburb of Ashton-on-Ribble. There they resided at Whinfield, an imposing, classical-style detached house in extensive grounds, with kitchen garden, orchard, fowl yard, and aviary. By the early 1870s, however, Robert Edmund's health was beginning to fail&#151;he suffered from bronchial and heart problems&#151;and before his retirement in 1874 he relinquished some of his more demanding duties. He died at his home on 27 May 1877 in his seventy-fourth year, and was buried on 1 June in St Andrew's churchyard, Ashton, Preston.<br>
<br>According to Harris's close and long-standing friend the Revd C. H. Wood, Harris was a most punctilious man with regard to business matters, always paying very close attention to detail and following established procedures&#151;ideal qualities, Wood believed, for a lawyer. Harris was also a very private man, preferring to go about his work in a quiet, unostentatious manner and shunning public office, though, in 1854, he did become a member of the general committee for establishing a free library in Preston. Not least through his charitable bequests he was regarded as a benevolent person, as well as a kind and considerate employer.<br>
<br>Harris's death caused considerable interest in Preston, not only because he was the last in his family line&#151;neither his brother nor sister had children&#151;but also because he was very wealthy. He had inherited money from his parents, uncles, and siblings, pursued a successful legal career, and acquired railway stock and real estate. Rumour abounded as to how the proceeds from realizing his estate, thought to be worth &pound;250,000, would be spent. He had already made numerous charitable bequests, including &pound;7000 to erect an infectious disease ward at Preston Infirmary, and though some people believed that the bulk of his fortune would be left to Queen Anne's Bounty for augmenting the livings of poor clergy, others anticipated that local charities and local people would be the main beneficiaries. The will stipulated that the Harris money was to be used to establish educational and/or charitable institutions in Preston, which would perpetuate the memory of the Harris family. During the 1880s and 1890s the Harris bequest financed three such institutions, namely the Harris Orphanage (1888), the Harris Free Library and Museum (1893), and the Harris Technical School (1897). The orphanage and technical school eventually became part of the University of Central Lancashire. In 1912 it was reported that the solicitors of the Harris trustees estimated that the value of the benefactions made to Preston under Harris's will amounted to no less than &pound;311,000.<br>
