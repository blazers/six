<span class="headword">King, Sir  John</span>  (1639&#150;1677), <span class="occ">lawyer</span>, was born at St Albans, Hertfordshire, on 5 February 1639, the eldest son of John King (1604&#150;1681), physician, of Aldersgate Street, London, and his second wife, Elizabeth (1611&#150;1661/2), youngest daughter of Barne Roberts of Willesden, Middlesex. His grandfather, John Le Roy, had moved to England from France in 1572, and then changed his name to King. King was educated at St Albans Free School and Eton College (<i>c</i>.1652&#150;1655) before matriculating in 1655 at Queens' College, Cambridge. Although originally intended for the church, King chose the law instead. In November 1660 he entered the Inner Temple, being called to the bar on 9 February 1668. By this date he had married, on 20 February 1666 or 1667, Joyce (<i>d</i>. 1688), daughter and heir of William Bennett of High Rothing, Essex. They had two sons and five daughters (four of whom died young).<br>
<br>King made his initial impact as a lawyer in the fire court set up following the fire of London, but soon progressed to chancery cases. He was knighted on 10 December 1674 and became a king's counsel on 23 January 1675, saving for his office as solicitor-general of the duke of York. In 1676 he was the top practiser in chancery, earning &pound;4700,<blockquote>for he was cut out by nature and formed by education for that business. He had the most of an orator and was withal the most polite and affable gentleman that I ever knew wear a gown. His principal care was to be instructed and then his performance was easy. (North, 1.380)</blockquote>North felt that King was overworked, and that an unhappy marriage kept him out late in the taverns of the town. Burnet hinted at other pressures, believing that King was being groomed by the court as a successor to Sir William Jones, the attorney-general. At any event King died relatively young.<br>
<br>King made his will on 27 June 1677, &#145;sick in body&#146;, and died on the 29th at his house in Salisbury Court, London. He was buried on 4 July 1677 at the Temple Church, Inner Temple, where there is an inscription in the triforium and a stone in the churchyard to his memory. His wife, in her will of 1 July 1684, remembered her husband as &#145;the most tenderly affectionate husband that ever woman was blessed withal&#146;, and following her death was buried on 20 April 1688, also in the Inner Temple.<br>
