<span class="headword">Birtwistle,  Thomas</span>  (1833&#150;1912), <span class="occ">trade unionist and factory inspector</span>, was born at Great Harwood, Lancashire, on 16 October 1833, the son of Jonathan Birtwistle, a calico printer, and Ann Birtwistle, a hand-loom weaver. Put to the hand-loom at the age of six, he became a power-loom weaver when he was fourteen and married a fellow weaver, Ellen Butterworth (who predeceased him), when he was twenty. Despite only a rudimentary formal education, Birtwistle showed a natural facility for mathematics, and became expert at calculating the complex piece-rates which formed the basis of a cotton weaver's wages. It was this rare ability which led to his involvement in the nascent trade union movement of the north Lancashire weaving towns during the later 1850s.<br>
<br>The aim of the early cotton weavers' unions, which Birtwistle later pursued consistently, was to secure an agreed list of weaving piece-rates from the leading employers and to enforce its uniform observance throughout the weaving districts. For this purpose, close co-operation between weavers' organizations in the different towns was essential. Having become a leading figure in his local union during the 1858 lock-out at Great Harwood, Birtwistle was elected to the council of the newly established North-East Lancashire Powerloom Weavers' Association (the so-called &#145;first amalgamation&#146;) during subsequent strikes at Padiham (1859) and Colne (1860), and in February 1861 he was appointed its full-time secretary, a post which he held for the next thirty-one years.<br>
<br>Birtwistle's union career could hardly have begun at a less opportune time. The year-long Colne strike had ended in defeat, and the cotton famine of the early 1860s caused a sharp decline in the amalgamation's membership. However, it escaped complete collapse, and the subsequent revival and expansion of cotton weavers' unionism owed much to Birtwistle's quiet, pragmatic persistence. Growth was slow and erratic, none the less: the industry-wide lock-out during the depression of 1878 demonstrated yet again both the fragility of inter-union co-operation and the hostility of many employers to collective bargaining. The Northern Counties Amalgamated Weavers' Association of 1884 (the &#145;second amalgamation&#146;) eventually provided the strong central organization the weavers needed for effective wage negotiations. Birtwistle served as its secretary during its early months, and although he was later overshadowed by the association's more assertive president, David Holmes, he had the ultimate satisfaction of negotiating the first uniform weaving price-list for the cotton industry in 1892.<br>
<br>Birtwistle's role in trade union history went far beyond brokering intricate back-stage deals between high-handed employers and truculent local union officials in Lancashire's smaller mill-towns. He represented the first amalgamation at the Trades Union Congress from 1872, served continuously on its parliamentary committee between 1875 and 1889, and took his turn as its chairman in 1882. Along with his younger counterpart, James Mawdsley, the spinners' leader, Birtwistle helped to forge the alliance between coal and cotton unions which largely determined the TUC's cautious and &#145;anti-political&#146; stance in the 1880s and 1890s. Finally, he was a leading figure in the cotton workers' repeated attempts to extend the scope of the <span class="roman">Factory Acts</span>. Beginning with the nine-hours movement, Birtwistle successfully developed the art of lobbying local MPs which extracted favourable legislation from both Conservative and Liberal administrations in the 1870s and 1880s. As secretary of the United Textile Factory Workers' Association, he was mainly responsible for securing&#151;in collaboration with Sir Henry James, the Unionist MP for Bury (later Lord James of Hereford)&#151;the <span class="roman">Factory Acts</span> extensions of 1889 (which regulated the unhealthy practice of &#145;steaming&#146; to increase the humidity of cotton-weaving factories) and 1891 (which obliged employers to provide their weavers with detailed printed &#145;particulars&#146; of each piece of work they received). At the same time, he became increasingly hostile to the idea&#151;frequently mooted at the TUC in the late 1880s&#151;of a legally-enforced eight-hour working day, on the grounds that it would either lead to lower wages or damage the cotton industry's international competitiveness.<br>
<br>Birtwistle's growing importance in industrial affairs, both locally and nationally, earned him public recognition in the course of the 1880s. He was appointed to the royal commission on the depression of trade and industry in 1885, and became one of the country's first working-class JPs in the same year. In the immediate aftermath of the third reform act there were suggestions that he might stand as a &#145;labour&#146; candidate for a Lancashire constituency; but his well-known Conservative sympathies were at odds with the predominant radical-Liberal tendencies of the weaving communities. In June 1892, however, he surprised his fellow union leaders (and offended some) by accepting a government appointment as a factory inspector, with specific responsibility for implementing the &#145;particulars clause&#146; of the 1891 <span class="roman">Factory Act</span>. Although this was an appropriate and adventurous appointment, given his long experience of the intricacies of piece-rates in the cotton industry, the suspicion remained that it was a political reward for services rendered to class collaboration in general, and to Lancashire Conservatism in particular. Despite this, his subsequent work as a factory inspector seems to have given satisfaction to his superiors and to employers and workers alike in the cotton industry.<br>
<br>Birtwistle retired as an inspector on reaching his seventieth birthday in 1903, and died at his home, 17 St James's Street, Accrington, on 22 March 1912; he was buried in Accrington cemetery on the 26th. He was survived by his second wife, Mary. By that time, although he was still something of a local celebrity, the details of his earlier record as a union leader had been effectively written out of the weavers' collective memory. Nevertheless, to have linked the worlds of Joseph Raynor Stephens (1805&#150;1879) and David Shackleton (1863&#150;1938), as Birtwistle did, was no mean achievement; and few careers better illustrate the extent to which British trade unions gained recognition, respectability, and responsibility during the second half of the nineteenth century.<br>
