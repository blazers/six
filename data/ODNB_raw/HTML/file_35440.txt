<span class="headword">Pearson, Sir  Charles John</span>, Lord Pearson  (1843&#150;1910), <span class="occ">judge</span>, born at Edinburgh on 6 November 1843, was the second son of Charles Pearson, chartered accountant, of Edinburgh, and his wife, Margaret, daughter of John Dalziel, solicitor, of Earlston, Berwickshire. After attending Edinburgh Academy he proceeded to the University of St Andrews, and then to Corpus Christi College, Oxford, where he distinguished himself in classics, winning the Gaisford Greek prizes for prose (1862) and verse (1863). He graduated BA with a first class in the final classical school in 1865. He afterwards attended law lectures in Edinburgh and became a member of the Juridical Society, of which he was librarian in 1872&#150;3, and of the Speculative Society. He was called to the English bar (from the Inner Temple) on 10 June 1870, and on 19 July 1870 he passed to the Scottish bar, where he rapidly obtained a large practice. On 23 July 1873 he married Elizabeth, daughter of M. Grayhurst Hewat of St Cuthbert's, Norwood, with whom he had three sons.<br>
<br>Although Pearson was not one of the crown counsel for Scotland, he was specially retained for the prosecution at the trial of the directors of the City of Glasgow Bank in 1879. He became sheriff of Chancery in 1885, and procurator and cashier for the Church of Scotland in 1886. In 1887 he was knighted, and he was appointed sheriff of Renfrew and Bute in 1888, and of Perthshire in 1889. He was a Conservative in politics, and in 1890 he was appointed solicitor-general for Scotland in Lord Salisbury's second administration: concomitantly, he was elected unopposed as MP for Edinburgh and St Andrews universities, and in the same year he became a QC. In 1891 he succeeded James Patrick Bannerman Robertson, Lord Robertson, as lord advocate. At the general election of 1892 he was again returned unopposed for Edinburgh and St Andrews universities, but after the subsequent fall of Lord Salisbury's ministry he ceased to be lord advocate, and was chosen dean of the Faculty of Advocates.<br>
<br>Pearson received the honorary degree of LLD from Edinburgh University in 1894, and on the return of the Conservatives to power in the following year he became again lord advocate, and resigned the deanship. In 1896 he was appointed to the bench, from which he retired, owing to bad health, in 1909. He died at Edinburgh on 15 August 1910, and was buried in the Dean cemetery there. His wife survived him.<br>
