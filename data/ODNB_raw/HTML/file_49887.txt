<span class="headword">Mann,  Frederick Alexander <span class="st"> [Francis]</span></span>  (1907&#150;1991), <span class="occ">jurist</span>, was born at Frankenthal, Rhenish palatinate, Germany, on 11 August 1907, the only child of Richard Mann (1873&#150;1953), lawyer, and his wife, Ida, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Oppenheim (1877&#150;1936). Both parents were from Jewish families which had been settled near the Rhine in Germany for many generations. Mann was brought up by his father, a successful provincial lawyer, and by his mother's sister. His mother had disappeared from the boy's life at an early age, having suffered a breakdown, and spent the rest of her days in an institution. It was a lonely and austere childhood. But Mann derived from the companionship of his father the personal and professional ethic which sustained him through disappointment and disaster to ultimate honour and success.<br>
<br>Mann's schooling and time at university took place during the turbulent years of the Weimar republic and, above all, of the German inflation, which left a permanent mark on him. He attended the universities of Geneva, Munich, and Berlin. At Berlin in 1930 he became an assistant in the law faculty, a mark of unusual distinction, and in the following year he took a doctoral degree. It was there also that he met his wife, Eleonore (Lore) Ehrlich (1907&#150;1980), a girl from Breslau whose academic record promised as much as his own. They both looked forward to their professional careers, and Mann himself decided to combine academic work with an advocate's practice, as was not unusual in Germany. But his life and prospects were destroyed when Hitler came to power in January 1933. Both he and Eleonore were impatient with those who thought the nightmare would soon pass, and they decided immediately that they must leave. Arrangements were made for him to open an office in London where, in the first instance, he would practise German law. He returned to Berlin in October 1933 to rejoin Eleonore and take his final examinations. They were married on 12 October under the ubiquitous picture of Hitler, and left Berlin at once for London.<br>
<br>Mann was forced to start again from scratch in an alien land. His wife had to defer her own career to his, and it was not until 1966 that she was able to start her pioneering legal practice for poor persons in the Portobello Road. His intention (a reluctant one, driven by the need to earn a living as quickly as possible: he would have preferred to have continued his academic work) was to practise as a solicitor, but he could not do so until he became a British subject by naturalization in 1946. In the meantime he acted as a consultant in German law to the solicitors' firm of Swann Hardman &amp; Co., of 10 Norfolk Street, London. Between 1936 and 1938 he worked on a book on the law of money, the manuscript for which he submitted as a doctoral thesis to the University of London. The book was published by Oxford University Press under the title <span class="italic">The Legal Aspect of Money</span> (1938) and received highly favourable notices. It was the first systematic study of the law of money in the English language, and a work of monumental erudition. It was also one of the first textbooks to break the convention that the works of living academic writers should not be quoted in court. Uniquely among writers of English legal textbooks, the author was able to draw copiously from his own knowledge of comparative material from other jurisdictions.<br>
<br>In 1946 Mann returned to Berlin with the Allied Control Commission to help remove the imprint of Nazism from German law. He wore the uniform of a lieutenant-colonel. It was bitter for him that he had not been able to wear an army uniform in wartime. But he had become an enemy alien, and it was only because the police turned a blind eye to his case that he was not interned. After the war, he became a partner in the Norfolk Street firm, which changed its name to Hardman, Phillips and Mann. His practice developed rapidly, and in 1958 the firm was merged with the large City practice of Herbert Smith &amp; Co., of which he remained a working member until the day of his death. He became well known as a forceful and tactically ingenious litigating solicitor with an enviable following. His clients included many international corporations, as well as such diverse characters as Somerset Maugham, Nubar Gulbenkian, and Baron Thyssen. At the same time his writings on international law were increasingly admired not only in England and Germany but elsewhere in Europe, the United States, and more widely. It was a rare combination of academic and practical distinction.<br>
<br>Although he had been educated first in the civil law tradition, Mann came to have a great admiration for the administration of justice in England. But this did not inhibit his legendary criticisms in the learned journals of any judicial decision which fell short of his own exacting standards. Underlying all his work, both practical and academic, was the pursuit of the unifying legal principle. This is perhaps why, of all his admirers among the judges, none gave place to Lord Denning, who described him in his own book, <span class="italic">The Due Process of Law</span> (1980), as the most learned of all his learned friends.<br>
<br>Mann (who was known in England as Francis, though he published as F. A. Mann) was one of that unique generation of German Jewish refugees who pulled themselves up by their own efforts and enriched and varied the qualities of English life in the 1930s and beyond. He did not practise the Jewish religion but he felt the force and separateness of his cultural inheritance. In his attitude to Israel and Germany he showed the adamantine quality of his integrity. He refused to condone the abduction of Adolf Eichmann from Argentina so that he could stand trial in Jerusalem, because in his view the kidnapping fatally flawed the trial.<br>
<br>Mann was forthright in his opinions. His confidence in his own legal judgement made him reject compromise as weakness, and seem intolerant of other views. But he was in truth a modest man with a genuine horror of the parade of his own attainments. Both inside and outside the law he possessed the life force, a man of energy and enthusiasm. There was a wide European culture in his make-up, with a special and discriminating love of music. It is ironic that his career and achievements were honoured in the country from which he was exiled long before they were fairly recognized in England. In 1977 the president of the Federal Republic of Germany conferred on him the grand cross of the order of merit. As early as 1960 he was appointed visiting professor at the University of Bonn, to give an annual series of lectures and seminars, whereas he never held an established post at an English university. In 1974 he was elected a fellow of the British Academy. He received honorary degrees from the universities of Z&uuml;rich and Kiel, and, in 1989, from Oxford. In 1980 he was appointed CBE. In the last year of his life he became the first practising solicitor to be appointed an honorary queen's counsel and to be elected an honorary bencher of Gray's Inn.<br>
<br>Apart from <span class="italic">The Legal Aspect of Money</span>, Mann published two volumes of <span class="italic">Studies in International Law</span> (1973 and 1990) and a shorter book, <span class="italic">Foreign Affairs in English Courts</span> (1986), as well as hundreds of writings on international and monetary law. He died of a heart attack on 16 September 1991 at his flat at 56 Manchester Street, London, while he was correcting the proofs of the fifth edition of his book on the law of money. His body was cremated at Hammersmith cemetery on 20 September. He left one son, David (<i>b</i>. 1935), and two daughters, Jessica (<i>b</i>. 1937) and Nicola (<i>b</i>. 1944). His wife predeceased him in 1980.<br>
