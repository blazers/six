<span class="headword">Goodyear,  Hugh</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1588, <em>d.</em> 1661), <span class="occ">Reformed minister in the Netherlands</span>, was born at Manchester and baptized there on 28 May 1588, the son of Thomas Goodyear (<i>d</i>. 1599), a wealthy cloth merchant, and his first wife, Ellen Proudlove (<i>d</i>. 1592). Admitted to Emmanuel College, Cambridge, in 1608, he graduated BA in 1613 and proceeded MA in 1616. After Cambridge he left for the Netherlands, travelling on a privy council pass issued on 26 October 1616. He settled at Leiden, a crossroads for travel through the Low Countries, where he lodged with Thomas Brewer, the puritan separatist book publisher. On 14 January 1617 Goodyear enrolled as a theology student at Leiden University.<br>
<br>Preaching opportunities abounded for Goodyear at Leiden because of the death in 1616 of Robert Durie, the pastor of the English&#151;Scottish church. The church turned to him to be the new preacher, and on 16 November 1617 the city magistrates approved him and provided an annual salary of 400 guilders&#151;he held the position for the rest of his life. Not being previously ordained in England, and distrusting episcopal ordinations, Goodyear arranged for a quick ordination from the French Calvinist preacher of Leiden. His English-speaking congregation of more than 200 families was a state-supported Reformed church in communion with the Dutch Reformed church, and as such was distinct from the other, rival, English church of the city, John Robinson's separatist church, which was entirely self-supporting and independent. Goodyear's church attracted many visitors, and in 1627 he appealed successfully to the city magistrates for a rise in salary because of the heavy entertaining he had to do because &#145;foreign preachers and church members ordinarily come addressed to him from other kingdoms&#146;  (reg. kerk. zaken., no. 2150, fol. 114<i>v</i>, gemeente archiev, Leiden). On 11 June 1627 he married his first wife, Sara Jansdochter van Wassenberch (<i>d</i>. 1642).<br>
<br>Goodyear's theological position was Calvinistic. In Dutch affairs he supported the contra-remonstrants and opposed the Arminians; in all matters pertaining to English religion, he sided with puritans. His friends included both presbyterians like John Paget and Robert Paget, and Independents such as William Ames and Hugh Peter, but he always condemned separatism. In his own congregation he emphasized preaching, discipline, strict sabbath observance, and simplicity of worship. Ceremonialism and the English prayer book were abhorrent to him; he never allowed them in his church. Many of the surrounding Dutch Reformed pastors considered him too strict in church discipline, especially on sabbath practice. For many years he stayed aloof from the Dutch Reformed classis, but, feeling isolated and in need of fellowship after the deaths of many of his English friends, he eventually compromised and took membership in 1655. Two years earlier his second wife, Cornelia Aertsdochter Schoor, whom he had married in 1648, had also died. There were no children from either marriage.<br>
<br>Although Goodyear had connections with various publishers, which he exploited to facilitate other people's publications, he did not publish any books himself. Nevertheless he achieved considerable standing in puritan circles for his scholarship and sturdy defence of orthodox doctrine and he corresponded widely with church leaders of his puritan persuasion in Europe, England, and America. His manuscript collection contains sermon notes, economic records, and letters from John Cotton, Hugh Peter, John Paget, and many others. At his death his library of 1063 titles had to be sold; the sellers printed an auction catalogue (1662) of thirty-six pages, listing each book, which is of great interest for examination of Reformed, puritan tastes in books. Goodyear died on 8 November 1661 and was buried in the Pieterskerk at Leiden on 11 November. His will directed that one-third of his property should go to the poor of his church and the remainder to relatives who lived in England and America.<br>
