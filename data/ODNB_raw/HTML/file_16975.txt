<span class="headword">Long,  Roger</span>  (1680&#150;1770), <span class="occ">astronomer</span>, was born on 2 February 1680 at Croxton Park, Norfolk, the son of Thomas Long, a gentleman. Following an early education at Norwich grammar school he was admitted as a sizar at Pembroke College, Cambridge, on 4 March 1697. He graduated BA in 1701, was elected fellow in 1703, and graduated MA in 1704.<br>
<br>At the commencement of 1714 Long delivered a &#145;music speech&#146; in Latin prose and English verse as a petition on behalf of Cambridge women who had previously been able to sit in that part of the university church known as the throne, but who had recently been forced to sit in the chancel, out of sight and unable to view the proceedings. The speech was well received and continued to be reprinted well into the nineteenth century, because in addressing the vice-chancellor, whom university wags usually styled &#145;Miss Greene&#146;, he assumed his native Norfolk dialect and, instead of saying &#145;Domine Procancellarie&#146;, &#145;did very archly pronounce the words thus, <i>Domina Procancellaria</i>, which occasioned a general smile in that grave Auditory&#146;  (Nichols, liv).<br>
<br>Long was ordained deacon at Lincoln on 25 September 1716 and priest at Norwich on 23 December 1716. He was rector of Overton Waterville, Huntingdonshire, from 1716 to 1751, then of Bradwell-on-Sea, Essex. He had become DD in 1728, and was appointed vicar of Cherry Hinton, Cambridgeshire, in 1729, the same year he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society. On commencement Sunday June 1728 Long preached a sermon entitled &#145;The Blessedness of Believing&#146;. He declared that<blockquote>vain therefore are all our attempts to conceive or explain, further than the Scripture will bear us out, the mysteries of faith: as well may we hope to measure the Heavens with a span, as with the short line of human reason to fathom the depths of them. (Long, <span class="italic">Blessedness</span>, 18)</blockquote>His faith did not preclude his later astronomical work, some of which did involve measurement; at the beginning of his <span class="italic">Astronomy in Five Books</span> he quoted an ancient source, noting that &#145;it is an observation of a philosopher that mathematical sciences have a tendency to purify the soul&#146;  (Long, <span class="italic">Astronomy</span>, 1.vii).<br>
<br>Long was master of Pembroke College from 1733 to 1770 and vice-chancellor of the University of Cambridge in 1733&#150;4. He was elected the first Lowndean professor of astronomy and geometry in 1750. A broadside was published, apparently in the 1760s and presumably written by Long, protesting the encumbrance of Lowndes's estate by the Admiralty, which prevented the university from benefiting fully from his bequest.<br>
<br>Long's <span class="italic">Astronomy, in Five Books</span> took some time to be completed: the first volume was published in 1742, part of the second in 1764, the remainder, posthumously, in 1784, having been prepared for publication by Richard Dunthorne (who served as butler and astronomer at Pembroke under Long) and the astronomer and mathematician William Wales. The astronomer royal, Nevil Maskelyne, offered his help as well.<br>
<br>Long was very interested in teaching devices. In the first volume of his <span class="italic">Astronomy</span> he described what he referred to as &#145;an astronomical apparatus&#146;, a hoop about 20 feet in diameter and 3 feet in breadth, which he had installed at Pembroke, &#145;whereon are delineated the constellations of the zodiac, with the ecliptic and such other circles as I thought proper&#146;  (Long, <span class="italic">Astronomy</span>, 1.x). He went on to describe in some detail his ideas for a similarly sized celestial sphere, which would rotate around a stage and which could be used to demonstrate astronomical phenomena to younger members of the university. Noting that he had little reason to expect encouragement in such an undertaking, he did eventually build such a sphere at Pembroke. Called the &#145;Uranium&#146;, the sphere was 18 feet in diameter and capable of seating thirty people; it was entered by climbing steps situated at the south pole. The inner surface was painted to represent the stars and constellations, there was a planetarium in the middle, and the entire sphere could be turned by a winch. The sum of &pound;6 was set aside annually to pay for someone, generally an undergraduate, to look after the sphere, which stood until it was torn down some time after 1871. Photographs (in Pembroke College archives), as well as a sketch by William Stukeley  (Bodl. Oxf., Gough maps 230, fol. 12), survive. Long's enthusiasm for teaching apparently extended to the very young; his commonplace book (in Pembroke College Library) contains &#145;An essay concerning teaching children to know their letters by a pack of cards&#146;, with various games described.<br>
<br>Long was a member of the Gentlemen's Society at Spalding, Lincolnshire. Several amusing anecdotes were published, including the following, in the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span>:<blockquote>That [Mr Bonfoy] and Dr Long walking together in Cambridge, in a dusky evening, and coming to a short post fixed in the pavement, which Mr B. in the midst of chat and inattention took to be a boy standing in his way, he said in a hurry, &#145;Get out of my way, boy.&#146; That boy, Sir (said the Doctor very calmly and slily), is a post-boy, who turns out of his way for nobody. (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 924)</blockquote>Long died on 16 December 1770. His portrait, conveying a pleasant visage, hangs in Pembroke College, and suggests the sense of humour for which he was known.<br>
