<span class="headword">Ward,  Michael</span>  (1683&#150;1759), <span class="occ">judge</span>, was the second but eldest surviving son of Bernard Ward (1654&#150;1690), landowner, of Castle Ward, co. Down, and of Anne, daughter of Richard Ward of Newcastle under Lyme and sister of Michael Ward, bishop of Derry. A child when his father was killed in a duel at Downpatrick, Ward attended the school of a Mr Jones in Dublin before matriculation at Trinity College in 1699. Entered as a student in the Inner Temple the next year, he was called to the Irish bar in 1705. Four years later he married Anne Catherine (1690/91&#150;1760), daughter and coheir of James Hamilton of Bangor, co. Down. While the match was initially opposed, seemingly by both families, it added considerably to Ward's wealth. Ward was returned as an MP for County Down in 1715 and again in 1727. During his parliamentary career he complained twice over intrusion of his proprietorial rights during &#145;a time of privilege&#146;: trespass at his manor in Bangor and interference with rights of tithe. Ward was named a judge of the Irish king's bench in October 1727, though his patent was not sealed until two years later. His long judicial tenure won Ward a reputation for probity and assiduity, but criticism was voiced too, over his conduct during the Munster assizes in 1733 and over his rebuke of counsel at Monaghan in 1740 when counsel opposed Ward's insistence that an Irish interpreter be present at the hearing of a malicious injuries claim.<br>
<br>Ward also acquired a reputation as an agriculturist. The layout of the grounds at Castle Ward is his legacy. He oversaw the excavation of the ornamental lake (Temple water), and chose the various trees and shrubs for planting. His wife planned the walled garden. Marl was found on the estate in 1707 and was immediately put to use as a fertilizer. Crop rotation, too, was introduced, and Ward found an unusual source of power to drive his new corn-mill:<blockquote>On the bay that opens to the garden is a singular contrivance for supplying a mill with water. A dead wall is carried across the gut in which are two arches, and in them two flood-gates fixed, the one to admit the tide, and the other to keep it in or out, as occasion serves. (Harris, <span class="italic">The Ancient and Present State</span>, 41)</blockquote>Ward supported the burgeoning linen trade and, to facilitate the export of grain, constructed a harbour at Killough. Killough was where Ward also started a charter school. Ward served on the committee assembling in Dublin in 1731 that led to the establishment of the Dublin society &#145;for improving husbandry, manufactures and other useful arts&#146;. Ward can thus be counted among what H. F. Berry in his <span class="italic">A History of the Royal Dublin Society</span> (1915) calls that &#145;small band of patriotic reformers, actuated by the purest and noblest motives&#146;  (p. 5).<br>
<br>Ward and his wife had three children. Bernard, Ward's only son and heir, built the house that now stands at Castle Ward; he was subsequently created Viscount Bangor. Ward's correspondence provides great insight into the management of a large eighteenth-century estate; it also reveals the judge handling the problem of impecunious relatives and aligning himself with his tenants in disputes over tithe and &#145;trade money&#146; with the established church. Illness prevented Ward travelling circuit in his last years. He died at Castle Ward on 19 February 1759.<br>
