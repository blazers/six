<span class="headword">Birkenhead <span class="st"> [Berkenhead]</span>, Sir  John</span>  (1617&#150;1679), <span class="occ">journalist and poet</span>, was born on 24 March 1617 in Northwich, Cheshire, the sixth child of Randall Birkenhead (1581&#150;1633), a saddler, alehouse-keeper, and chapel clerk, and his wife, Margaret, of whom little is known. John attended the free Witton grammar school.<br>
<br>In 1632 Birkenhead entered Oriel College, Oxford, as a servitor. His tutor was Humphrey Lloyd; otherwise, his early university career is scantly documented. Evidently, he flourished; years later an anonymous enemy, calling him &#145;a Student in the Law&#146;, would backhandedly acknowledge that Birkenhead &#145;hath learned very well, and is become as good a Scholler as his Tutors, &amp; Professours&#146;  (<span class="italic">True Character of Mercurius Aulicus</span>, 1645, 2&#150;3).<br>
<br>In August 1636 Archbishop Laud, visiting the university, &#145;had occasion to have some things well transcribed, and this Birkenhead was recommended to him, who performed his businesse so well, that the archbishop recommended him to All Soules' College to be a fellow&#146;  (<span class="italic">Brief Lives</span>, 1.104). In January 1637 he was admitted for his BA degree, awarded <i>in absentia</i> the following month, when he was at Lambeth performing scribal and probably more substantive duties for Laud.<br>
<br>The patronage of the archbishop&#151;and the circumstances and events of the looming civil war&#151;were to determine Birkenhead's career and forever fix his identity as an arch-royalist, as the quasi-official spokesman for king and court Mercurius Aulicus. He was granted the MA degree in 1639, by Laud's petition, and concurrently became a full fellow of All Souls.<br>
<br>In 1641, parliament having committed the archbishop to the Tower, Birkenhead again took up residence at Oxford, associating with other Laudians, whose patron was Dr Brian Duppa. The most notable member of that &#145;knot of the choicest Oxford Wits always together&#146;  (D. Lloyd, <span class="italic">Memoires</span>, 1668, 425) was the poet and playwright William Cartwright. Those young royalists contributed prolifically to the several university miscellanies commemorating royal births, weddings, and other occasions. Birkenhead wrote poems for two such collections in 1643.<br>
<br>By then, the embattled king and his court had sought refuge at Oxford, from where the doomed military effort&#151;and whatever else of the king's state functions remained&#151;were conducted. One crucial, ongoing engagement of the civil war was the struggle to win the hearts and minds of the public. At Oxford the royalist propaganda machine discovered John Birkenhead, not only a fierce loyalist but also an emerging genius at satire and polemic.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">Mercurius Aulicus</span>, the weekly &#145;intelligencer&#146; of the king's party, and England's first official newsbook, ran from January 1643 to September 1645, with only a few interruptions&#151;118 numbers in all, some 1700 closely printed pages. For the first few issues Birkenhead assisted the principal author, Peter Heylin, whose style was comparatively tame. However, from mid-1643 onward rival newsbooks recognized Birkenhead as the person responsible for the lively amalgam of factual information, witty invective, brilliant satire, and all the modern weapons in a relentless war of words: the &#145;inside&#146; story, the embarrassing quotation, the &#145;planted&#146; idea, the not-quite denied rumour. The various rebel factions were forced to respond with newsbooks of their own, two dozen of them, the most important being <span class="italic">Mercurius Britanicus</span> (1643&#150;6), whose misspelt title <span class="italic">Aulicus</span> did not fail to deride. None, however, was able to rival Birkenhead in facile style, wit, vitriol, or even the presentation of accurate news; after all, he had the best &#145;sources&#146;, the king's entire bureaucracy and spy network.<br>
<br>Besides the newsbooks, on which his reputation principally rests, Birkenhead also published a number of polemic and satiric pamphlets. His contemporaneous fame is attested not only by the frequency with which adversaries singled him out for denunciation or grudging praise but also by his contributions to others' publications, including prefaces to Richard Whitlock's <span class="italic">Zo&ouml;tomia</span> (1654) and the 1655 edition of John Denham's <span class="italic">Cooper's Hill</span>.<br>
<br>Birkenhead's talent as a poet has perhaps been unfairly minimized, even by his modern biographer, P. W. Thomas, who did so much to elucidate the facts of his life and to define the nature of his satiric genius. Only twenty-three poems survive. Some are sophisticated creations, especially his commendatory poems, including ones for the first folio of Beaumont and Fletcher's <span class="italic">Comedies and Tragedies</span> (1647), for his friend Cartwright's posthumous <span class="italic">Comedies, Tragi-Comedies, with other Poems</span> (1651), and for Henry Lawes's <span class="italic">Second Book of Ayres</span> (1655). At their best moments, those poems compare favourably with the most famous examples of their minor genre, such as Ben Jonson's on Shakespeare and Thomas Carew's on Donne. Birkenhead's tribute to Cartwright is not only his best poem, it is also the longest commendatory poem in existence, at 240 lines. Henry Lawes set several of Birkenhead's lyric poems to music. Three of those, translations from the Greek <span class="italic">Anacreontea</span>, are arguably superior to better-known translations by Birkenhead's contemporaries Robert Herrick, Thomas Stanley, and Abraham Cowley. A 240-line monody on the beheading of King Charles, <span class="italic">Loyalties Tears Flowing</span>, published twice as a booklet in the regicide year (1649), exhibits less of the satirical stridency that characterizes much of Birkenhead's writing and more a sense of controlled indignation and genuine sorrow.<br>
<br>At the Restoration, Birkenhead's loyalty and diligence in the cause of the martyred king were rewarded. He regained his Oxford fellowship, and in April 1661, on the recommendation of Charles II, he was awarded a doctorate of civil law. From 1660 to 1663 he held the office of licenser of the press, a function that coincided with his editorship of the new official newsbook, <span class="italic">Mercurius Publicus</span>.<br>
<br>Birkenhead was elected to parliament from Wilton, Wiltshire, in June 1661. In November 1662 the king knighted him. The following June he became one of the founding members of the Royal Society, sitting on the committee to improve the use of the English language. His acquaintances were prominent literary figures of the age: James Shirley, Edmund Waller, Henry Vaughan, Jeremy Taylor, Henry More, John Evelyn, Thomas Sprat. In the famous coterie of Katherine Phillips, &#145;The Matchless Orinda&#146;, Birkenhead was nicknamed Cratander, after the title character in Cartwright's play <span class="italic">The Royal Slave</span>. In 1668 John Dryden referred to him as &#145;my worthy friend&#146;  (J. Dryden, <span class="italic">Essays</span>, ed. W. Ker, 1926, 1.122).<br>
<br>Never married, and childless, Birkenhead died on 4 December 1679, at his lodgings in Whitehall, after a humiliating rebuff in his attempt to hold his parliamentary seat. He was buried &#145;near to the School door&#146; in the churchyard of St Martin-in-the-Fields, Westminster  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, new edn, 1813&#150;20, 3.1205). No marker or memorial remains.<br>
