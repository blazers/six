<span class="headword">Davis,  Samuel</span>  (1760&#150;1819), <span class="occ">East India Company servant and orientalist</span>, was born in the West Indies, the younger son of John Davis, who held the post there of commissary-general, and his Welsh wife (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Phillips). He went to England with his mother and two sisters after the death of his father. Despite the evident poverty of the family, Davis appears to have received a good education, although the details are lost.<br>
<br>In 1778 he was nominated a cadet for Madras by Laurence Sulivan, a director of the East India Company, and sailed for India in the <i>Earl of Oxford</i>, arriving at Madras in 1780. In 1783 he was selected by Warren Hastings to accompany a second mission to Bhutan and Tibet as &#145;Draftsman and Surveyor&#146;. The purpose of the mission, led by Hastings's kinsman Samuel Turner, was to renew British contact with the court of the Panchen Lama first established in 1774 by George Bogle. The Tibetan authorities, however, refused to allow a greater number into their territory than had accompanied the Bogle mission. Davis, whose surveying skills may have excited Tibetan suspicions, was left behind in Bhutan and returned to India alone, though not before he had made a very careful documentation in watercolour and pencil of Bhutanese architecture and topography. The qualities of visual accuracy and warm sympathy apparent in his drawings are found also in the diary he kept in Bhutan, extracts of which appeared posthumously in <span class="italic">Remarks on the Religious and Social Institutions of the Bouteas, or Inhabitants of Boutan</span> (1830). In this he provided a useful account of &#145;the handsomest race I ever saw&#146;, their theocratic government, and many aspects of their Buddhist culture and society. (He was far less happy with the appearance of Bhutanese women and their customary treatment by men.)<br>
<br>In August 1783 Davis was appointed to a writership in Calcutta, and this was soon followed by the post of assistant to the collector of Bhagalpur and registrar of the <i>adalat</i> there. He was promoted first assistant in 1787 and factor in 1788, before becoming collector of Burdwan in 1793. It was at the beginning of his career at Bhagalpur that he first made the acquaintance of the brilliant scholar and lawyer, Sir William Jones, whose intimate friend and collaborator he now became. Davis was an active member of the Asiatic Society of Bengal, founded by Jones, and he emerged in due course as the acknowledged expert of the period on Indian astronomy (<i>jyotisa</i>). Basing himself mainly on the modern <span class="italic">Suryasiddhanta</span> and its commentary, he produced two papers of a superb technical quality in the society's <span class="italic">Asiatick Researches</span>: &#145;On the astronomical computations of the Hindus&#146; (1790) and &#145;On the Indian cycle of sixty years&#146; (1792). Among Jones's surviving letters there are more addressed to Davis than to any other individual, and it is clear that it was only in their close relationship that the main purpose of the Asiatic Society, as envisioned by Jones, in encouraging systematic, collaborative research was actually achieved. In 1792 he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society at the initiative of Sir Joseph Banks. He also became friends at this time with Thomas Daniell and his nephew William, perhaps the greatest of British painters in the East in this period, whom he had earlier known in London. Much later, in 1813, William Daniell produced six aquatints based on Davis's Bhutan paintings, and a further six in 1816 based on his views of the island of St Helena. While sketching with the Daniells at the ancient city of Gaur, Davis was attacked by a bear and left lame for life. (He shot the bear as soon as he had recovered sufficiently from his wounds.) While still at Burdwan, in August 1794 Davis married Henrietta Boileau, who was from an aristocratic French family that had settled in England as refugees early in the century. They were to have four sons and seven daughters. The eldest son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7287/', "Sir John Francis Davis (1795&#150;1890)")</script>, became the first governor of Hong Kong. During Davis's next posting as magistrate at Benares, 1795&#150;1800, he had to face an insurrection by the deposed nawab of Oudh, Wazir Ali. On finding his house attacked, he placed his family on the roof and, unaided, guarded the only access to it with the aid of a pike. (His prot&eacute;g&eacute; Mountstuart Elphinstone would visit Davis's widow every year in London on the anniversary of the insurrection to do puja to the pike.)<br>
<br>The remainder of Davis's Indian career was spent in a succession of posts in Calcutta, ending as accountant-general of India in 1804. In 1806 he retired and left with his family for England. He was elected a director of the East India Company in 1810 and re-elected in 1814 and 1819. As co-author (with James Cumming) of the fifth report on East India Company affairs (1812), Davis's talents and reforming zeal were fully employed in the attempt to reconsider the foundations of the company's rule of India. He died at his home, Birdhurst Lodge, near Croydon, on 16 June 1819.<br>
