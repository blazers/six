<span class="headword">Clark, Sir  George Norman</span>  (1890&#150;1979), <span class="occ">historian</span>, was born in Halifax, Yorkshire, on 27 February 1890, the second son in the family of three sons and two daughters of James Walker Clark CBE JP (1858&#150;1936), draper, a leading citizen of Halifax and successful businessman, and his wife, Mary, daughter of Alderman S. T. Midgley JP, of Halifax. His family was a cultured one with strong intellectual interests: his elder brother, James, became professor of German at Glasgow University, and his sister Barbara Callow a leading expert on nutrition; his mother's sister had married the Dutch philologist A. J. Barnouw. Clark was educated at Bootham School, York, and later at Manchester grammar school, to prepare him for Cambridge University. It was to Oxford, however, that he went. In 1908 he was elected to a Brackenbury scholarship at Balliol College, and placed in the first class in <i>literae humaniores</i> in 1911, and in modern history in 1912. Election to a prize fellowship at All Souls in 1912 enabled him to spend some time abroad perfecting his languages. A former member of the university Officers' Training Corps, which he joined after carefully rejecting pacifist views, he was commissioned when war broke out in the 1st battalion of the Post Office Rifles, wounded twice, and taken prisoner in May 1916, at Vimy Ridge. His years of captivity at G&uuml;tersloh and then at Krefeld were profitably spent learning languages, reading widely, and working on Netherlands history when on parole in The Hague with his aunt and uncle by marriage.<br>
<br>On his return to Britain Clark was elected, in 1919, a fellow of Oriel College, Oxford. On 21 June that year he married Barbara, daughter of William Brock Keen, chartered accountant, and the sister of a Balliol friend (William Allan Keen) killed in the war; they had a son and a daughter. Clark's appointment as editor of the <span class="italic">English Historical Review</span> in 1920 recognized one of his outstanding skills; he was to resume this role, after resigning in 1926, from 1938 to 1939. He took a renewed interest in the Oxford Fabian Society, of which, before the war, he had been a member with G. D. H. Cole; he spoke at Labour meetings about the general strike in 1926, and was invited to stand as Labour candidate for Oxford. In his radical sympathies he was joined by his wife, who had worked actively for the Women's Trade Union League. In 1927 he became a university lecturer in modern history and was proctor in 1929&#150;30. His steadily growing reputation as a historian led to his election in 1931 to the newly established Chichele professorship of economic history, tenable at All Souls. He remained there until, after the Munich crisis, he joined those working at Chatham House, where his specialized knowledge of the Low Countries could be profitably used. He returned to full-time academic life, however, in 1943, when he became regius professor of modern history at Cambridge, and a fellow of Trinity College.<br>
<br>Clark's previous experience made him an excellent choice to edit the <span class="roman">Oxford History of England</span>, an ambitious and largely successful project. He wrote the first volume to be published, <span class="italic">The Later Stuarts, 1660&#150;1714</span> (1934), a work of remarkable scholarship, and continued to edit the series down to the last volume published in 1965. He later undertook to edit the <span class="roman">New Cambridge Modern History</span>, for the most part following the original scheme devised by Lord Acton, but also arranging for chapters on areas and subjects which had no place in the earlier work. He was also editor of the <span class="roman">Home University Library of Modern Knowledge</span>. He was for some time a delegate of the Clarendon Press.<br>
<br>Clark returned to Oxford in 1947 upon election as provost of Oriel, and soon became immersed again in university business. Outside Oxford he was also busy, as a trustee of the British Museum (1949&#150;60), a member of the University Grants Committee (1951&#150;8), and from 1954 to 1958 as president of the British Academy, of which he had been a fellow since 1936. A knighthood in 1953 marked recognition of his many services to learning and public life. His retirement in 1957 gave him more time for scholarship. He was delighted in 1960 to be invited to write <span class="italic">A History of the Royal College of Physicians</span> (2 vols., 1964&#150;6) and his election as honorary fellow of that college (1966) gave him particular pleasure. He remained a dedicated and disciplined worker until just before his death.<br>
<br>As a historian Clark was workmanlike and lucid; his judgements were carefully balanced and judiciously set out, and he tried above all to be fair. He was not interested in flights of fancy; he preferred to stick closely to the evidence and, in the main, the questions he posed were down to earth rather than speculative, though conversation with him made it clear how deeply he thought about problems of all kinds. He could combine clear narrative with crisp comment to excellent effect. The finest of his books, <span class="italic">The Seventeenth Century</span> (1929; rev. edn, 1947), displays another of his strengths: his capacity for comparative history, based on careful analysis and a sensitive awareness of cultural similarities and differences. This remarkable survey broke new ground, and nothing similar to it, or its equal in learning, was to appear for a quarter of a century. Clark's writings on Anglo-Dutch relations also remain valuable. His many invitations to deliver special lectures, and his many honorary degrees&#151;including DLitt from Oxford (1947) and Cambridge (1961)&#151;reflected his high reputation as a scholar. He had honorary fellowships at Balliol and Oriel (both 1957) and was re-elected to an All Souls fellowship in 1961.<br>
<br>Clark never lost some of the characteristics of the reserved north-countryman. He had many friends, enjoyed social life, and was an excellent and witty conversationalist, but could appear somewhat aloof with mere acquaintances. Known as James or Jas to his intimates, he was G. N. to historians everywhere. Of medium height and sturdily built, he might well have been mistaken for one of his yeoman&#150;farmer ancestors from the East Riding, or even for a Dutch businessman (some erroneously believed that he was partly Dutch). After starting life as a nonconformist, he became a member of the Church of England in 1936. But like others of his generation he owed much to the intellectual vigour and sturdy independence of his dissenting family background. Clark died in the Radcliffe Infirmary, Oxford, on 6 February 1979.<br>
