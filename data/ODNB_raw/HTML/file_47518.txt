<span class="headword">Gibbs,  Herbert Cokayne</span>, first Baron Hunsdon of Hunsdon  (1854&#150;1935), <span class="occ">merchant banker</span>, was born on 14 May 1854 at Frognal, Hampstead, Middlesex, the fourth son of merchant banker <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/33386/', "Henry Hucks Gibbs, first Baron Aldenham (1819&#150;1907)")</script>, and Louisa Anne (1818&#150;1897), daughter of William Adams. After schooling at Winchester College (1868&#150;71), he attended Trinity College, Cambridge (BA, 1877). Following a course of training (1877&#150;9), in 1879 he joined Antony Gibbs &amp; Sons, the family firm, at 22 Bishopsgate, London. He married Anna Maria (1862&#150;1938), daughter of Richard Durant, of High Canons, Hertfordshire, in 1885. The couple had three sons and three daughters.<br>
<br>Founded in 1808 the Gibbs firm originally had connections with Spain, and by 1820 it had adopted the west coast of South America as a field for its activities. Guano became its main interest from 1842, transforming the house from a small mercantile establishment to a prominent City merchant bank. When Gibbs joined, output of guano was declining, successfully substituted by the new nitrate fertilizers. The firm became a major participant in the financing, production, and trade of Chilean nitrate when Chile annexed the rich Peruvian province of Tarapac&aacute; during the Pacific War at the end of 1880. Gibbs was sent to Valpara&iacute;so (March 1880 to 1881) to supervise the closure of the Peruvian branches and the investment in nitrate <i>oficinas</i>. After 1881 the house also had widespread interests in Australasian businesses, mainly in shipping, import trading, and mining; and it later became involved in other mining ventures elsewhere, through participation in the Exploration Company.<br>
<br>During the second half of the nineteenth century Antony Gibbs &amp; Sons underwent substantial transformation. In the 1860s it had carried on an enormously profitable commission business, with annual profits of up to &pound;137,000. Later it was forced by a decline in this trade into enterprises in which it had no experience. Its main staple remained nitrate but this was extraordinarily speculative and unprofitable, especially in the last two decades of the century when annual profits dropped as low as &pound;15,000. Over the same period there was also a sharp decline in the capital base of the firm (due to heavy withdrawals by partners). &#145;Could any depositor who was not a relation leave his money with us if he knew the position?&#146; argued Gibbs in 1902  (Gibbs MS 11044/2, fol. 284). His father had entered parliament in 1891, representing the City of London; and other Gibbs partners were similarly distracted by parliamentary commitments. This dangerous lack of active leadership was to be ended by Herbert Gibbs: a full partner and director from 1882, he was to be the key figure in the company from 1900 to 1933. He was responsible for the nitrate side of the business, which became the supplier of thousands of tons of nitrate required by the Ministry of Munitions during the First World War. When the Nitrate and Soda Executive was formed to co-ordinate purchases among the allies in 1917, Gibbs was appointed director of purchases for Europe, and the firm kept its complicated accounts without charge. In recognition of his war services the French government conferred on him the L&eacute;gion d'honneur in 1918. He was created Baron Hunsdon of Hunsdon in 1923.<br>
<br>Under Gibbs's firm leadership, the fortunes of the firm recovered. By the early 1920s the capital of Antony Gibbs &amp; Sons stood at over &pound;2 million. However, in 1920, when wartime demand had ceased, the nitrate industry was suffering a severe crisis. While supply increased rapidly, consumption stagnated. To counter the threat of German synthetic nitrate, to stabilize prices, and to improve consumption, Gibbs organized a pool of European nitrate-holders in February 1921. He was elected chairman and his firm appointed as agents. Of the million tons held by the pool only 100,000 tons were sold in the first half of 1921. After unsuccessful negotiations with the Chilean Association of Nitrate Producers concerning prices, in the face of a deteriorating social and financial situation in Chile President Alessandri invited Gibbs to an emergency meeting. Gibbs sailed on 25 August 1921 and in October an agreement was reached: the association would reduce prices to 14<i>s</i>. to stimulate sales, but it would compensate the pool by reimbursing &pound;1.5 million.<br>
<br>These and related events constituted a major difficulty for Antony Gibbs &amp; Sons. The firm suffered a severe loss of working capital, and new developments were sharply restricted. In 1930, under a special act of the Chilean government, the Compa&ntilde;&iacute;a de Salitre de Chile (Cosach) was organized; this became the sole producer of nitrate and iodine. Nationalization put an end to what was still the main business of the house, the management of <i>oficinas</i> and supply stores. Exports of nitrate were also monopolized and the firm ceased to have any interests in nitrate business, except as credit managers for the group of London banks who helped to finance Cosach's activities and as agents for the sale of iodine.<br>
<br>In addition to his role in the family firm, Gibbs was chairman of the Alianza Nitrate Company from 1895 to 1928, and of the Pan de Az&uacute;car Nitrate Company from 1901 to 1926. He was a director of the Rio de Janeiro City Improvement Company from 1884, and its chairman from 1905 to 1935. From 1908 he also sat on the board of the Australian Mutual Provident Society.<br>
<br>A dynamic member of the business community, Gibbs was described as &#145;shrewd and capable, but above all transparently honest&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 27 May 1935). Active on behalf of the Conservative Party, Gibbs was also chairman of the City of London Conservative Association from 1912 to 1932. He shared his political interests with his wife, who was president of the women's branch of the association. From 1924 to 1932 he was president of the 1912 Club, his brainchild, created to combat socialism and radicalism in the East End constituencies. Under his leadership, in 1924 the association protested against the formation of a Labour government; and it denounced the depressing effect of the December 1923 general election on the real value of the British government's long-dated securities, as a warning to the Liberals over collaboration with MacDonald.<br>
<br>In 1914 Gibbs had opposed Irish home rule: &#145;No compromise is possible in this question. The <span class="roman">Home Rule Bill</span> must go; for the only alternatives are national dishonour or civil war&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 8 April 1914); and he raised funds for the Ulster Union Defence League. He combated modern social legislation which &#145;relieved individuals from responsibility and weakened the character of the nation&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 3 April 1924). The changes introduced since 1907 by successive governments in taxation methods were also regrettable, according to Gibbs. He condemned the heavy consequences of death taxes and of super-tax for British industry and trade, and favoured a constitutional review that would put an end to the Commons' sole control over finance.<br>
<br>Gibbs took part in the parliamentary delegation sent to Russia in 1912, returning the visit of the Duma. In 1919 he was member of the Indemnity Committee, concerned with war debts, and the war cabinet agreed he should be one of the delegates to the Paris peace conference; he was replaced at the last moment by Lord Sumner. He then delivered a speech on German indemnity, and a copy of this was taken to Paris by the delegates. In 1926 Gibbs helped to create and was first chairman of the Empires Industries Association, to increase trade within the empire after the dissolution of the British Commonwealth Union. A commissioner of the Public Works Loan Board from 1884, he served as deputy chairman in 1908, and chairman from 1921. Some sixty-five Labour MPs voted in 1930&#151;unsuccessfully&#151;against the continuance of Gibbs in this office, remembering that during the 1926 strike he had said that the miners were the enemies and that starvation was a proper weapon to be used against them.<br>
<br>Gibbs published a number of works dealing with genealogy, currency, and taxation. In 1908 he had bought a country house, Briggens, in the manor of Hunsdon, near Ware, Hertfordshire. This fueled his interest in local history, and led to his publication of <span class="italic">The Parish Register of Hunsdon</span> (1915) and the <span class="italic">History of Gibbs of Fenton, in Dartington</span> (1925). Although more concerned about the practice of business than about economic theory, Gibbs was a convinced bimetallist, writing <span class="italic">A Bimetallic Primer</span> (1894), <span class="italic">Address on Bimetallism</span> (1895), and several letters and articles. He shared his views with his father, a fervent advocate of bimetallism, and founder, along with Henry Riversdale Grenfell, of the Bimetallic League in the early 1880s, and later its president.<br>
<br>Appointed an income tax commissioner in 1886, Gibbs became increasingly interested in fiscal matters, publishing on the subject several pamphlets, articles, and letters in the press. In <span class="italic">The Incidence of Income Tax and Wasting Securities</span> (1904), he exposed the anomalies of the law over assets which became exhausted after a period of time, such as quarries or mines, and campaigned to bring up the question of these depreciating funds. In 1920 he gave evidence on &#145;wasting assets abroad&#146; before the royal commission on income tax. In these questions and many other public topics he was a valued correspondent of <span class="italic">The Times</span>.<br>
<br>Like his brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/33388/', "Vicary Gibbs")</script>, Herbert Gibbs was an accomplished gardener and an excellent shot. A lifelong fly-fisher he later took up painting watercolours and sketching. He was a Hertfordshire magistrate and also served as high sheriff of the county in 1913. Gibbs died after a short illness on 22 May 1935 at his home, Briggens, Hertfordshire. He was buried at St Dunstan's Church, Hunsdon, on 25 May.<br>
