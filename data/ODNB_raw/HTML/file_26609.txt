</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Stow,  David</span>  (1793&#150;1864), <span class="occ">school founder and educationist</span>, was born in Paisley on 17 May 1793, the son of William Stow and his wife, Agnes Smith. William Stow was a prosperous Paisley merchant and magistrate but the family was partly of English descent; David Stow's grandfather had been a landed proprietor in co. Durham. Stow's mother was a woman of great piety whose household routine revolved around family prayers and scripture reading. He attended the Paisley grammar school, where he was a good but not outstanding pupil. His biographer describes him in his schooldays as a handsome, fair boy, naturally high-spirited but too gentle-natured to take much interest in the rougher games.<br>
<br>In 1811, at the age of eighteen, Stow was sent to Glasgow to work for a silk merchant. Avoiding the society of the city's worldly social clubs, Stow spent his leisure in study and conversation with other devout young men and quickly became interested in the spiritual reclamation of the urban poor. Industrial growth had doubled the population of Glasgow in a very short time, creating an ill-housed, under-nourished, and hopeless proletariat that seemed bereft of any spiritual authority. On his daily walk from his home south of the River Clyde to his place of business, he had to pass through the Saltmarket, an area of appalling squalor. He began his charitable work by distributing money to impoverished old men, but soon learned that they were too settled in their ways for easy reformation.<br>
<br>Recognizing that much human behaviour is the product of habit and example, Stow turned his attention to the reclamation of the very young. In the recent past, education of the poor had been viewed with suspicion by the authorities, and indeed Stow's own father had been ordered to give details of a Sabbath school founded in Paisley to the sheriff of Renfrewshire, who feared sedition. Although this attitude had relaxed considerably by the time David Stow opened his first Sabbath school, it may explain his constant eagerness to demonstrate the moral benefits of education and his comparative lack of interest in its intellectual dimension. Stow was not the only one to try to offer Sabbath schooling to the children of the Glasgow poor, but he was the boldest in entering backstreets and alleys, searching for the poorest families, an activity he called &#145;deep-sea fishing&#146;  (Fraser, 25). He started his first small school with children drawn from about seventy families living in two lanes in the Saltmarket district. By concentrating on one small neighbourhood he ensured that he could get to know each family and gain the co-operation of the parents. Stow's efforts attracted the interest and support of Dr Chalmers, minister of the Tron Church (1815) and founder of the Tron Parish Sabbath School Society (1816). Stow was an elder in Chalmers's Tron parish and in 1821 became an elder of St John's parish, where Chalmers was minister.<br>
<br>Stow proved to be an extraordinarily gifted teacher, with an instinctive knowledge of what would gain children's interest and help them remember information, and an appreciation of the value of play in social and moral development. In 1820 Stow visited Samuel Wilderspin's recently opened infant school in Spitalfields, which was to provide him with a model for a programme of infant education along Christian lines. Scots at the time were aware of the work of Robert Owen, but distrusted his atheism. In his capacity as secretary of the newly formed Glasgow Infant School Society, he invited Wilderspin to Glasgow to advise on infant education. Wilderspin helped him to launch the Drygate model school in April 1828 and went on to deliver a series of lectures on infant education all over Scotland. This tour established Wilderspin's reputation as an &#145;educational entrepreneur&#146;, and taught Stow much about the current trends in infant education. Several of Stow's most famous ideas, such as &#145;sympathy of numbers&#146; (good behaviour reinforced by the opinion of one's peers) and &#145;picturing out&#146; (fixing lessons in the mind by means of vivid word-pictures), came from Wilderspin. One history has described the difference between the two men thus: &#145;Stow's ideal pupil [was] an infant saint with some knowledge, and Wilderspin's an infant prodigy with some religion&#146;  (Salmon and Hindshaw, 73).<br>
<br>As a result of his overwhelming concern with children's moral development, Stow rejected Bell's and Lancaster's system of sketchily trained young monitors in favour of more mature trained teachers, both male and female. From its inception the Drygate school trained some teachers, although initially the course of training was very short. Stow believed in the importance of co-education, feeling that it stimulated intellectual effort among the girls and good behaviour among the boys. His emphasis upon the formation of good habits early in life, and his doubt that these could be sustained in the backstreets of Glasgow, led him to admit children as young as two years of age to his school at a time when formal education usually commenced at age seven.<br>
<br>The Drygate model school (and, after 1837, its affiliated training college) offered a very different environment for learning from the traditional parish school. The Drygate school opened in a cottage adapted to include a gallery with tiered seats so that all of the children could see the teacher. The building was spacious, light, and clean. Pupils themselves were expected to be as clean and tidy as possible. Perhaps because the children he undertook to teach were very young Stow seldom used books, and taught scripture by means of vivid storytelling, followed by questions. This encouraged the children not only to remember but to understand what they had heard. Coloured beads were used for teaching counting and mnemonic rhymes helped teach the multiplication tables. Natural history lessons included tours of the playground to observe the plants growing there.<br>
<br>Stow had learned a great deal from watching Wilderspin's frantic efforts to keep order in the early weeks of his Spitalfields school. Out of the realization that small children need a great deal of physical activity came Stow's emphasis on the important role of play. The playground, which he called the &#145;uncovered school&#146;, became more than an outlet for excess energy, however, as Stow became convinced that it was there that children learned such important social skills as good manners, co-operation, and the ability to share. Stow's Drygate school included a large playground and he insisted that all schools must have a play area, even if it had to be made by fencing in an area of the roof. Inside the classroom children were seldom required to sit still for more than fifteen minutes at a time. Marching, singing, and clapping games punctuated lessons, giving children the chance to move about. Masters took part in games, which gave them the opportunity not only to observe acts of kindness or cruelty for later class discussion but also to learn a great deal about the character of individuals&#151;to identify the natural leaders, followers, and loners, for instance. Stow had never used corporal punishment in his schools; he elaborated a system of peer criticism in which actions observed in the playground were put before the class (anonymously) for judgement. On the other hand, Stow avoided giving prizes or assigning class rankings, believing they led to jealousy and unwholesome competition. One modern writer on Stow comments that the novelty of substituting kindness and reason for corporal punishment can hardly be overstated in a society which used the expression &#145;Fa fuppit the laddie?&#146; (Who whipped the boy?) to mean &#145;Who was his teacher?&#146;  (Cruikshank, 213).<br>
<br>Stow published a series of articles explaining his training system to a popular audience. Presumably to appeal to the working-class parent or to emphasize the essential Scottishness of the enterprise, these took the form of a dialogue in Scottish dialect between Granny and her daughter-in-law, Leezy. Granny is represented as the voice of tradition (asking, for instance, why the master joins in play or why the traditional shorter catechism is not used). Leezy, the hard-pressed but dutiful mother, represents the parent who is not quite sure about the school and its modern philosophy but is pleased by the effect it has upon her children. Through Granny's persistent questioning and the master's patient replies, Stow enunciates the principles of his educational system for the general reader.<br>
<br>Although Stow was neither the first to offer infant education nor the first to train teachers in Scotland (James Buchanan, a disciple of Owen who recruited Wilderspin to teaching, had trained teachers on a small scale), he can justly claim to have founded the first teacher training college in the British Isles and to have most systematically promoted the use of trained adults as teachers.<br>
<br>Until 1835 Stow had funded most of his schools' work. As they grew this became impossible and in that year they passed to the control of the Glasgow Educational Society, of which he was the joint secretary. Like Chalmers he believed the established church should control education, supported by the state, and he was a strong opponent of the voluntaries (who attacked government-aided church schooling). The Glasgow society, which also produced George Lewis's famous critique <span class="italic">Scotland, a Half-Educated Nation</span> to discredit the voluntaries, promoted Stow's ideas for teacher training and called for increased state financial assistance to schools. Under the society's direction Stow's schools were re-formed as the Normal Seminary, which opened in November 1837 at Dundas Vale, Glasgow. The Normal Seminary received its first government grant in 1841, conditional upon its being transferred to the general assembly of the Church of Scotland. In this period Dr Kay (later Kay-Shuttleworth), who was an admirer of Stow's work, tried to recruit him as one of the first inspectors of schools for Scotland. He declined on the grounds of an aversion to receiving pay for his work coupled with ill health, brought on by overwork.<br>
<br>In 1843, when the Disruption shattered the Church of Scotland, Stow, together with his mentor, Dr Chalmers, and most of the Normal College staff joined the Free Church. At first Stow hoped that they might be able to stay at their posts but the general assembly decreed that all staff must be adherents to the Church of Scotland. In May 1845, in a dramatic gesture of repudiation, Stow and his fellow directors, teachers, fifty students, and 700 pupils assembled in the Normal College. With Stow slightly flushed with emotion, others in tears, the company left the building in a procession, joined by the old janitor and his wife, who locked the door behind them. They walked through crowded streets to their new premises, where they carried on as usual, conducting classes in tents until new buildings could be erected. Thereafter the Free Church Normal College and the Glasgow Normal Seminary trained teachers side by side. Later they formed the nucleus of Glasgow's Jordanhill Training College.<br>
<br>Stow continued to guide the college for the remainder of his life, but developments in educational policy depressed him. He felt that the instructors trained under the system of pupil teachers created by the minutes of 1864 could have little status as moral leaders, and he disliked the emphasis placed on secular learning over moral training both by the schools and the training colleges. As the Scottish intellectual tradition reasserted itself, the demand for formally trained teachers ensured the success of the normal colleges, but the emphasis on very young children's emotional and developmental needs was lost, only to be rediscovered in the twentieth century. Stow continued to command respect as an authority on education in his lifetime, and in 1862 a selection of his writing was awarded a medal for merit at the London exhibition. After about 1860 ill health prevented him from taking an active part in the life of the college.<br>
<br>Stow's family life was pious and happy, but it brought him a series of bereavements which threatened to overwhelm him. On 12 March 1822 he married Marion Freebairn. It was a happy marriage and they had three sons and a daughter. When she fell ill and died on 30 July 1831 Stow was so devastated that he was unable to carry on with his work for a year afterwards. In 1841 he married Elizabeth MacArthur, again a happy marriage that was cut short by her death on 24 May 1847. Both his two eldest sons died in 1852; the eldest was a clergyman and the second had entered his father's business. Stow died at his home at Bridge of Allan, Stirlingshire, on 6 November 1864.<br>
<br>Stow is remembered as a humane and practical teacher, and a skilled adapter of other men's theories rather than an original thinker such as Rousseau or Pestalozzi. He is remembered as the spiritual founder of the Jordanhill Training College, whose oldest building bears his name. In his own time he was inclined to underemphasize the influence of other educationists, especially Wilderspin, upon his thought. He was apt to present as original insights very fundamental instruments of human learning, such as picturing out and sympathy of numbers. Many of his methods are obsolete&#151;he employed more verbal questioning and his class sizes were much larger than is fashionable today. Nevertheless, his outstanding contributions to the education of the very young include the avoidance of corporal punishment, and the idea that education should be a happy experience and the relationship between teacher and pupil a friendly one. Stow promoted these and other essentially modern innovations, such as the recognition of the importance of play and the necessity of a clean, pleasant environment for learning. He introduced the most systematic training for teachers in the British Isles in his time and offered thoughtful and considerate support to some of the poorest citizens of Glasgow.<br>
