<span class="headword">Shepherd <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Morgan]</span>,  Pamela</span> <span class="st"> [<em>known as </em>Mother Shepherd]</span>  (1836&#150;1930), <span class="occ">evangelist</span>, was born on 19 March 1836 in Tal-y-waun, near Newport, Monmouthshire. She was the eldest of the four surviving children of Benjamin Morgan (<i>b</i>. 1806), a blacksmith active in Chartist politics, and Margaret Evans (<i>b</i>. 1811), a Welsh Baptist and daughter of Hugh Evans, a Cardiganshire farmer. Her father's political activities made his position in south Wales increasingly difficult, and the family moved to London in 1845 as Benjamin Morgan sought work on the Great Western Railway. As the fortunes of Chartism waned Pamela's father took to drink, and her mother took in washing to support her family. Pamela Morgan married William (Bill) Shepherd, a carter, about 1860 and moved to Poplar. Her parents and siblings returned to Wales in 1861. Deprived of her close relations and faced with a feckless and irregular husband, Pamela Shepherd had to rely on the charity of her in-laws in the early years of her marriage to support herself and her young daughters. Although a self-confessed &#145;drunkard&#146; she worked hard for her children, first as a laundress, then as a rag sorter. Conscious of her own lack of education (she admitted at the age of forty-two that she could read but not write), she arranged for her older daughters to receive some schooling.<br>
<br>Pamela Shepherd encountered the Salvation Army, or the Christian Mission as it was then known, in 1867 and was eventually converted by the preaching of James Dowdle. Dubbed the &#145;Hallelujah Washerwoman&#146; she was soon employed on mission business, giving her testimony around London. In 1868 she was employed for a time in the household of William and Catherine Booth, the mission's founders, and from 1869 she assisted at the mission's Limehouse centre, a converted music-hall renamed the Penny Gaff. It was around this time that she became known as Mother Shepherd, the title which would remain with her for the rest of her life. A dedicated and enthusiastic worker, she was appointed hallkeeper and cook at the mission's Whitechapel headquarters in 1876.<br>
<br>In 1878 Mother Shepherd, as a native speaker of Welsh, was sent to begin work in Aberd&acirc;r, Glamorgan; her two eldest daughters served as her assistants. The period from 1878 to 1883 was one of unprecedented growth for the Salvation Army, and during that time Shepherd opened seven new stations. About 1883 she retired from full-time evangelism, but was later recalled to London by Florence Booth to superintend one of the army's rescue homes. Around 1891 she was given charge of the new Cardiff rescue home (housed in a building donated by Richard Cory). Aged fifty-seven, she retired from the Salvation Army, but continued to play an active part in Aberd&acirc;r philanthropic and moral reform causes. She was for fourteen years (1893&#150;1907) a police court missionary, and after the introduction of the <span class="roman">Probation of Offenders Act</span> in 1907 she became the first probation officer in her area. Mother Shepherd was the founder and head of two missions: Cwm (<i>c</i>.1894&#150;1908) and Pentwyn Bach at Trecynon (1908&#150;25), which became known as Mother Shepherd's Mission. She died at her home, The Nook, at 7 East Avenue, Aberd&acirc;r, on 24 February 1930, and was buried on St David's day in Aberd&acirc;r old cemetery. She was accorded a public funeral, with members of the south Wales constabulary as her pallbearers, and Salvation Army officers and eminent Aberd&acirc;r ministers conducting the services.<br>
