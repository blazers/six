<span class="headword">Gruffudd ap Rhys</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1201), <span class="occ">prince of Deheubarth</span>, was the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/23464/', "Rhys ap Gruffudd (the Lord Rhys) (1131/2&#150;1197)")</script>. Gruffudd was the ancestor of a lineage that shared lordship over the patrimony of Rhys ap Gruffudd until the virtual extinction of the dynasty during Edward I's conquest of Wales.<h2>
<a name="GruffuddapRhys"></a>Gruffudd ap Rhys</h2>Gruffudd, a son of Rhys and his wife, Gwenllian, daughter of Madog ap Maredudd (<i>d</i>. 1160) of Powys, was the eldest of Rhys's legitimate sons. He appears to have been the designated heir to the patrimony and he was married to Matilda (<i>d</i>. 1210), daughter of William (III) de Briouze (<i>d</i>. 1211), the most powerful of the marcher lords of the late twelfth century. The impending succession had led to conflict within the family as early as 1189 when Rhys is known to have encountered resistance from his eldest but illegitimate son, <a name="cosubject_59912"></a><span class="headword">Maelgwn ap Rhys</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1231)<span class="occ"></span>, who was to found a second important lineage. Rhys placed Maelgwn in Briouze's prison but he escaped in 1192 and joined his father at the siege of the castle of Swansea, an offensive that occasioned the summoning of a large English army. Maelgwn's presence was still troublesome and, during the continuing internecine conflict, Rhys ap Gruffudd was himself incarcerated by Maelgwn and another son in 1194. Promptly upon Rhys's death in 1197 Gruffudd went to Richard I to secure recognition of his succession and he made his peace with the bishop of St David's, consenting to be scourged as penance for an outrage upon the bishop with which his father had been charged. Gruffudd immediately faced strenuous conflict with Maelgwn who, forming an alliance with Gwenwynwyn ab Owain (<i>fl</i>. 1186&#150;1216) of Powys, wrested possession of Ceredigion from him. Gruffudd was captured and placed first in Gwenwynwyn's prison and then transferred to the king's custody in Corfe Castle. Released in 1198, he scored considerable success in asserting his authority in Ceredigion, and Maelgwn incurred the Welsh annalist's censure when, in 1199, he sold Cardigan Castle to the English so as to deny it to his brother. Gruffudd was also engaged to good purpose in Ystrad Tywi, taking the castle of Llandovery and Cantref Bychan. He had done much to secure his patrimony when he died on 25 July 1201. The annalist's encomium of Gruffudd, who was buried at the Cistercian abbey of Strata Florida, reflects his highly favourable estimation of the son of Rhys ap Gruffudd who was by Welsh right a true prince and heir, and conveys his critical regard for Maelgwn who, though once extolled for his valour, had recently incurred much adverse comment.<h2>
<a name="ThesonsofGruffuddapRhys"></a>The sons of Gruffudd ap Rhys</h2>Gruffudd's young sons, Rhys (<i>d</i>. 1222) and <a name="cosubject_59913"></a><span class="headword">Owain ap Gruffudd</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1235)<span class="occ"></span>, maintained the struggle for the inheritance with the other two main contenders, Maelgwn ap Rhys and <a name="cosubject_59914"></a><span class="headword">Rhys Gryg</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1233)<span class="occ"></span>, another son of Rhys ap Gruffudd, who founded a third important lineage. In the early years of the thirteenth century, with the benefit of the support of Llywelyn ab Iorwerth (<i>d</i>. 1240), prince of Gwynedd, Rhys and Owain vigorously contested possession of Ceredigion and deprived their adversaries of the key castles of Dinefwr and Llandovery in Ystrad Tywi. They shared Llywelyn's discomfiture following John's invasion of Gwynedd in 1211 and were forced to yield their territory in Ceredigion, where Falkes de Br&eacute;aut&eacute; fortified the castle of Aberystwyth for the king. When, during the next year, Maelgwn ap Rhys and Rhys Gryg joined Llywelyn in fierce resistance to John, Rhys and Owain found themselves dependent upon the king's support. This proved to be of little avail and the successes of the previous years were placed in jeopardy. It was only in 1215 that the contenders for supremacy in Deheubarth were reconciled when, for the first time, all the surviving descendants of Rhys ap Gruffudd were allied with Llywelyn against John. At a gathering at Aberdyfi the next year Deheubarth was partitioned. The sons of Gruffudd ap Rhys secured the greater part of Ceredigion, Rhys Gryg won the main part of Ystrad Tywi, including the castle of Dinefwr, and Maelgwn received lands in Dyfed and the remaining parts of Ceredigion and Ystrad Tywi. Adjustments were made in 1222, upon the death of Rhys ap Gruffudd, and again in 1225. Rhys Gryg held the whole of Ystrad Tywi, which after his death came to be shared between his sons Rhys Mechyll and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/48557/', "Maredudd ap Rhys Gryg (d. 1271)")</script>. In Ceredigion the distribution which initially gave Maelgwn the southern portion and Owain the northern portion came to be much changed. Ultimately the descendants of Owain secured an extensive estate in the southern and middle commotes (Is Coed, Gwynionydd, Caerwedros, Mabwynion, Pennardd, Anhuniog, and Mefenydd), while those of Maelgwn were confined to a much smaller estate in the north (Creuddyn, Perfedd, and Genau'r-glyn). Their fortunes, and particularly their relations with the successive princes of Gwynedd, Llywelyn ab Iorwerth, Dafydd ap Llywelyn (<i>d</i>. 1246), and Llywelyn ap Gruffudd (<i>d</i>. 1282), are recorded by successive annalists at Strata Florida.<h2>
<a name="ThelineageofMaelgwnapRhys"></a>The lineage of Maelgwn ap Rhys</h2>Maelgwn ap Rhys was succeeded in 1231 by his son <a name="cosubject_59915"></a><span class="headword">Maelgwn Fychan</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1257)<span class="occ"></span>, who had to struggle to safeguard the interests of his house in the vicissitudes of the period following the death of Llywelyn ab Iorwerth in 1240. His difficulties were particularly acute during the conflicts of 1244&#150;6 when royal officers were able to exploit differences among the princes to further their purposes. Maelgwn was forced to flee to Gwynedd where he joined its princes in a defiant resistance in the mountains which was likened by the annalist to the valour of the Maccabees. He returned to an estate further diminished by the crown's annexation of the commote of Perfedd. Predeceased by his son Rhys ap Maelgwn (<i>d</i>. 1255), Maelgwn Fychan was succeeded by his grandson <a name="cosubject_59916"></a><span class="headword">Rhys Fychan ap Rhys ap Maelgwn</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1302)<span class="occ"></span>. A sworn man of Llywelyn ap Gruffudd, Rhys Fychan was confronted in 1277 with the advance of a powerful royal army into his lands. Following his submission in early May he was among the lords of Deheubarth sent to the king to do homage, but his troubles were not ended. Shortly afterwards, with a royal castle being built at Llanbadarn Fawr and his authority destroyed, he, like his grandfather before him, took refuge in Gwynedd. Under the terms of the treaty of Aberconwy in November, Rhys Fychan became one of five lords whose homage Llywelyn ap Gruffudd was allowed to retain, but he remained exiled from his estates in Ceredigion. He participated in the war of 1282&#150;3 in the alliance of Welsh princes against Edward I and briefly endeavoured to reassert his position in northern Ceredigion. He withdrew to Gwynedd once more, but then submitted to the king and served in his forces. As late as May 1283 he received a grant of the cantref of Penweddig (the three commotes of northern Ceredigion) from Dafydd ap Gruffudd, but, with the king's forces already well entrenched there, the charter was of no practical significance and was probably made in an attempt to wean Rhys from the king's alliance. He broke with the king yet again, but by August 1283 he had been captured and dispatched for perpetual imprisonment. On his death in 1302 he was accorded the honour of a burial in Windsor at the king's expense.<h2>
<a name="ThelineageofOwainapGruffudd"></a>The lineage of Owain ap Gruffudd</h2>The lineage of Owain ap Gruffudd (<i>d</i>. 1235) was represented in the middle years of the century by <a name="cosubject_59917"></a><span class="headword">Maredudd ab Owain</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1265)<span class="occ"></span>, a substantial figure who, at his death, was commemorated by the poet Y Prydydd Bychan (<i>fl</i>. 1222&#150;1268) and described by the Welsh annalist as &#145;defender of all Deheubarth and counsellor of all Wales&#146;  (<span class="italic">Brut: Peniarth MS 20</span>, 114). In the period following the death of Llywelyn ab Iorwerth his allegiance was sought by Dafydd ap Llywelyn and the crown. Maredudd's importance can be gauged by the attempts that were made by the king's commanders in south-west Wales to wean him from his attachment to Dafydd ap Llywelyn in 1244&#150;6. They were conscious that &#145;it is not easy to control the Welsh except through one of their own nation [<i>lingua</i>]&#146;  (Edwards, <span class="italic">Calendar</span>, 48), and urged that terms be agreed with Maredudd that would bring him into the king's allegiance. He was enticed with the prospect that he might benefit from Maelgwn Fychan's disinheritance. His adherence to Llywelyn ap Gruffudd upon his advance into Deheubarth at the end of 1256 ensured the prince's supremacy in Ceredigion. He was among the prince's leading magnates, sharing in his military achievements and participating in his councils. Married to a daughter of Gilbert de Vall of Dale in the earldom of Pembroke, for whom he made dower provision much in accord with English practice, Maredudd ruled a substantial and stable barony. At his death, however, his lands were divided among his sons. Owain ap Maredudd died in 1275, leaving as his heir <a name="cosubject_59918"></a><span class="headword">Llywelyn ab Owain</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1275&#150;1283)<span class="occ"></span>, whose young age enabled him to survive the tumultuous years which saw his kinsmen's lordship erased. <a name="cosubject_59919"></a><span class="headword">Cynan ap Maredudd</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1277&#150;1297)<span class="occ"></span> and <a name="cosubject_59920"></a><span class="headword">Gruffudd ap Maredudd</span>  (<em>d.</em> in or before 1319) submitted to the king's commander in May 1277 and were sent to Edward I to do homage. They were reinstated in their lands but, finding the extension of royal authority in Ceredigion irksome, they were among the princes in rebellion in 1282. In their statement to Archbishop Pecham they alleged that Robert de Tibetot (<i>d</i>. 1298), justice of west Wales from 1280, had undermined their jurisdiction over their patrimony. Whereas, they insisted, all Christian men enjoyed their laws and customs in their lands, they had been denied the laws of Wales, which had remained inviolate until the imposition of royal authority after the war of 1277. At the start of renewed conflict in March 1282 Gruffudd ap Maredudd and his third cousin, Rhys Fychan ap Rhys ap Maelgwn, attacked the castle of Llanbadarn Fawr. They maintained their resistance and forced the king's commanders to send a contingent to take their castle of Trefilan in September. Gruffudd remained in arms, a member of the small cohort of princes allied with Dafydd ap Gruffudd until, in June 1283, he and his nephew Llywelyn ab Owain surrendered. Cynan and Rhys Fychan were serving with the king's forces in the spring but later resumed an active resistance which they maintained until their surrender in August. Gruffudd, Cynan, and Rhys Fychan were detained at various English castles, including Bridgnorth, Nottingham, Bamburgh, and Newcastle, Northumberland. They were in time allowed to be counted among the &#145;king's Welshmen&#146; in the royal household, and Gruffudd and Cynan served in the Flanders campaign in 1297. Gruffudd, who was dead by 1319, and Cynan were allowed an income from the manor of Edwinstowe, Nottinghamshire, but they never returned to the lands of their forebears.<h2>
<a name="Thefamilyslegacy"></a>The family's legacy</h2>By the end of the conflict the only territory allowed to any member of the lineages of Gruffudd ap Rhys and Maelgwn ap Rhys was the estate in Is Coed and Mabwynion held by Llywelyn ab Owain. In the mid-fourteenth century this was divided between his granddaughters, one of whom, Elen, was the mother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/10816/', "Owain Glyn D&#373;r")</script>. He came to her share of the estate and through his mother he was thus linked with the princes who had once ruled Deheubarth in its entirety.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">Brut y tywysogyon</span>, containing numerous references to the activities of members of the lineages and notices of their burial in the chapter house, reflects the close association between the Cistercian convent of Strata Florida and those who exercised lordship in Ceredigion. Secular patronage is indicated in charters of Maelgwn ap Rhys and Maelgwn Fychan, Rhys ap Gruffudd, and Cynan ap Maredudd, which refer to gifts by other members of their family. Literary associations are illustrated in poetry addressed by Phylip Brydydd to Rhys ap Gruffudd and by Y Prydydd Bychan's estimation of the valour and generosity of Owain ap Gruffudd, Rhys ap Gruffudd, and Maredudd ab Owain. The later years of the thirteenth century bring evidence of lay interest in prose works. Madog ap Selyf, a cleric or possibly a monk, translated the legendary chronicle of Turpin from Latin into Welsh at the request of Gruffudd ap Maredudd. Brother Gruffudd Bola translated the Athanasian creed into Welsh at the request of <a name="cosubject_48543"></a><span class="headword">Efa ferch Maredudd</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1300)<span class="occ"></span>, daughter of Maredudd ab Owain, a task he undertook out of love for her and in her honour. She was one of the first Welsh women whose ability to read is documented, and her descendants were patrons of devotional treatises in Welsh in the fourteenth century. Brother Gruffudd and Madog ap Selyf may have been members of the convent at Strata Florida where, late in the century, a major corpus of court poetry of the period of the princes, the Hendregadredd manuscript, was written. No surviving manuscript of <span class="italic">Brut y tywysogyon</span> can be shown to have been written in the abbey scriptorium, but both the lost Latin text on which the surviving Welsh versions were based, and one of the Welsh texts, may well have been composed there.<br>
