</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Nevinson,  Henry Woodd</span>  (1856&#150;1941), <span class="occ">social activist and journalist</span>, was born at 5 South Fields Place, Leicester, on 11 October 1856, the second son of George Nevinson, a solicitor, and his wife, Maria Jane, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Woodd, who raised him in a strictly evangelical atmosphere. In 1872 he won a scholarship at Shrewsbury School and later a junior studentship at Christ Church, Oxford, where he matriculated on 10 May 1875. He was placed in the second class in both classical moderations (1877) and <i>literae humaniores</i>, graduating BA in 1879. He retained an interest in the classics, especially Greek drama.<br>
<br>After taking his degree, and spending a short time at Westminster School teaching Greek, Nevinson studied German literature during two sojourns in Germany (mainly at Jena). His first book, <span class="italic">A Sketch of Herder and his Times</span> (1884), was followed by a volume on Schiller (1889) and, many years afterwards, by another on Goethe (1932). As a child Nevinson had developed a keen interest in military affairs, which led him, as a young man, to study the German army, to advocate conscription, and, after training, to command a company of cadets in the East End of London. Although he grew to hate war, he never lost his academic interest in military history.<br>
<br>At Oxford, Nevinson had been deeply influenced by the principles of Christian socialists and the impressive personality of John Ruskin, and after returning to England from Germany he worked at Toynbee Hall, settling in Whitechapel in London. He also lectured on history at Bedford College, and acted as secretary to the London Playing Fields Committee. He gradually became more radical through his exposure to the miseries of poverty, and by 1889 had joined the Social Democratic Federation of H. M. Hyndman; Marxism, however, was never congenial to him. As an agnostic who disliked all dogmatic systems, his ethical and political outlook was similar to that of his friends Peter Kropotkin and Edward Carpenter. On 18 April 1884 Nevinson married Margaret Wynne Jones (1858&#150;1932) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/45464/', "Nevinson, Margaret Wynne")</script>], with whom he had one daughter and one son, the painter <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35205/', "Christopher Richard Wynne Nevinson")</script>. After her death he married, on 18 January 1933, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37950/', "Evelyn Jane Sharp (1869&#150;1955)")</script>, suffragette and novelist. He spent time living among the working classes and depicted the life of the labouring people in <span class="italic">Neighbours of Ours</span> (1895), which was written in cockney dialect. In later years he joined the Labour Party.<br>
<br>In 1897 Nevinson was made the <span class="italic">Daily Chronicle</span>'s correspondent in the Graeco-Turkish War. For the next thirty years he chronicled, mainly through eyewitness reports, most of the wars and civil disturbances of the day. He was sent by the <span class="italic">Daily Chronicle</span> to report on the South African War, visited Russia during the abortive revolutionary movement of 1905&#150;6, went to India for the <span class="italic">Manchester Guardian</span> in 1907&#150;8, and was with the Bulgarians during the First Balkan War. During the First World War he was a correspondent on the western front and at the Dardanelles, where he was wounded. He published <span class="italic">The Dardanelles Campaign</span> in 1918. In 1926, at the age of seventy, he went to Palestine, Syria, and Iraq to report for the <span class="italic">Manchester Guardian</span>.<br>
<br>As a war correspondent Nevinson was always scrupulously careful in gathering his facts, and his writing often inspired those struggling towards freedom. However, writing was not his only form of service. He helped to organize relief for the Macedonians (1903) and the Albanians (1911), and worked with his son for the Friends' Ambulance Unit in Flanders in late 1914. When incensed at the outrages of the Black and Tans in Ireland he used the platform as well as the printed page in order to rouse public protest. The most difficult, however, of all his crusades was that which he conducted against what he saw as the virtual slavery of bonded labourers in Portuguese Angola. After a journey into the interior in 1904&#150;5 he returned to the malaria-infested plantations of S&atilde;o Tom&eacute; and Principe, encountering skeletons of perished slaves along the way. His writings aimed to make clear to the consciences of his fellow Englishmen the human price of their taste for cocoa. Eventually the leading cocoa firms boycotted the produce of those islands; some of the slaves were repatriated, and, after prolonged controversy, the accusations which he had made in <span class="italic">A Modern Slavery</span> (1906) were confirmed by the government's white paper published in 1914. Nevinson suffered from a painful tropical disease for many years after the journey.<br>
<br>A strong supporter of female suffrage, Nevinson was friends with the suffragette Evelyn Sharp for many years before they married. In 1907 he was a founder member of the Men's League for Women's Suffrage and two years later he helped to found, and became chairman of, the more militant Men's Political Union for Women's Enfranchisement. In the same year he resigned from the <span class="italic">Daily News</span> (along with his colleague Henry Brailsford) as a protest against its stance on the forcible feeding of women prisoners.<br>
<br>Nevinson wrote good and clear prose. His <span class="italic">Plea of Pan</span> (1901) was perhaps his most accomplished piece of writing. From 1907 to 1923, while Massingham was editing <span class="italic">The Nation</span>, Nevinson, whenever he was in England, contributed &#145;middle&#146; articles (essays written to order and to a prescribed space). He wrote well on an astonishing variety of topics, ranging from humour to grave commentary on history and life. His travel articles appeared throughout his more than thirty published works, of which the best-known were <span class="italic">Essays in Freedom</span> (1909), <span class="italic">Essays in Rebellion</span> (1913), <span class="italic">Between the Wars</span> (1936), and <span class="italic">Running Accompaniments</span> (1936). He also published two books of poetry. A selection of his work was published posthumously as <span class="italic">Essays, Poems and Tales of Henry W. Nevinson</span> (1948). His personal experiences were recorded in three autobiographical volumes: <span class="italic">Changes and Chances</span> (1923), <span class="italic">More Changes, More Chances</span> (1925), and <span class="italic">Last Changes, Last Chances</span> (1928); the latter two volumes were abridged by Ellis Roberts in <span class="italic">Fire of Life</span> (1935).<br>
<br>Nevinson was a handsome man, who carried himself with a noble air which earned him the nickname of the Grand Duke. His blend of humanity, compassion, and daring made him a popular figure in his own lifetime. Twice in his old age friends arranged a banquet in his honour and made him a presentation. In 1937 he was president of the English PEN Club; he received the honorary degree of LLD from the University of Liverpool in 1935, and that of LittD from the University of Dublin in 1936. In 1939 he was elected an honorary student of Christ Church, Oxford. In October of the following year the Nevinsons' house in Hampstead was bombed and the couple moved to the vicarage at Chipping Campden, Gloucestershire. It was here that Nevinson died, aged 85, on 9 November 1941. His funeral was held at Golders Green crematorium and was followed by a memorial meeting at Caxton Hall, London, on 11 December.<br>
