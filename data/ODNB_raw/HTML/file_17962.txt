<span class="headword">Manners,  Roger</span>, fifth earl of Rutland  (1576&#150;1612), <span class="occ">nobleman</span>, was born on 6 October 1576 at Kirk Deighton, Yorkshire, where he was baptized on 19 November. He was the eldest surviving son of John Manners, fourth earl of Rutland (<i>d</i>. 1588), and his wife, Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1595), fourth daughter of Francis Charleton of Apley Castle, Shropshire, and nephew of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17952/', "Edward Manners, third earl of Rutland")</script>. Roger was one of a large family and his mother was again pregnant at the time of her husband's death on 24 February 1588. Manners was only eleven when he became fifth earl of Rutland. The short time which had elapsed since the death of the third earl meant that his inheritance was encumbered by the conflicting and burdensome demands of two wills and jointures for two dowager countesses. Rutland's wardship was promised to the earl of Leicester, but the latter's sudden death in September 1588 meant that, like his cousin Elizabeth Manners, daughter of the third earl and heir to his barony of Ros, Rutland became a ward of Lord Burghley. The marriage of Lady Ros to Burghley's grandson in 1589 cemented ties between the Manners and Cecil families, but also created long-lasting tensions over property and the Ros barony. Rutland was educated at Cambridge, arriving at Queens' College to study with the vice-president, John Jegon, in late 1587. He followed Jegon to Corpus Christi College in 1590. He was created MA in February 1595, as part of a grand spectacle at Cambridge which was stage-managed by Robert Devereux, second earl of Essex, the queen's favourite and the late Leicester's stepson. Rutland soon became an adherent of Essex.<br>
<br>Although he had received approval from the queen to travel on the continent in December 1594, Rutland's plans were disrupted by the death of his mother in April 1595 and he did not leave until October 1595. Essex summoned his own cousin, Robert Vernon, from Oxford to accompany Rutland on the initial stages of his journey. Essex also wrote Rutland at least three private letters of travel advice, of which only the third (dated 16 October 1595) is known to survive. These provided the inspiration for a quite separate document which was framed as a letter of travel advice from Essex to Rutland but intended for public circulation, and which may have been written by Essex's secretariat or by Francis Bacon. It was designed as political propaganda to demonstrate Essex's statesmanlike qualities and proved remarkably successful. Rutland toured through the Low Countries, Germany, and Switzerland. He matriculated at Padua University in 1596, but fell dangerously ill there in July. The writer Robert Dallington was among his servants by this time. Rutland travelled in France during 1597, before rushing back to Plymouth to join Essex's Azores expedition in July. He returned from that unhappy voyage in November, and was admitted to Gray's Inn on 2 February 1598. He married Essex's stepdaughter, Elizabeth Sidney (1585?&#150;1612), the only child of Sir Philip Sidney, in early 1599. Shortly afterwards he went to join Essex's expedition in Ireland, even though the queen had repeatedly denied him permission to go. Rutland served as an infantry officer but received a peremptory summons from Elizabeth to return to England. Before his return he was knighted by Essex at Cahir Castle on 30 May. Claiming ill health and aided by the intercession of friends such as Sir Robert Cecil, he narrowly avoided imprisonment for his defiance of the queen.<br>
<br>In July 1600 Rutland again went abroad in search of military action, spending several months in the Low Countries before returning to London in October. He was soon caught up in the paranoia of Essex and his few remaining followers. Although he was not involved in the planning for an Essexian coup Rutland probably knew more about the plans of the earl and his partisans than he later admitted. On 8 February 1601, allegedly in the belief that Essex was about to be murdered, he joined the earl's disastrous attempt to secure armed support in London. Two of his younger brothers, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17953/', "Francis Manners (1578&#150;1632)")</script> and Sir George Manners, also participated. Rutland was arrested and imprisoned in the Tower. He was spared indictment but fined &pound;30,000, which was reduced to &pound;20,000 on 10 June. Released from the Tower on 8 August, he was subsequently confined to the house of his great-uncle <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/40609/', "Roger Manners")</script> at Uffington, Lincolnshire, until January 1602. By the time of Elizabeth's death in March 1603, Rutland was on the point of full rehabilitation, but the accession of James I further boosted his fortunes. A highly successful visit by James to the earl's seat, Belvoir Castle, on 22&#150;23 April secured Rutland the new king's favour. His fine (still largely unpaid) was remitted and in June&#150;August 1603 he travelled to Denmark to bestow the Garter upon Christian IV and attend the baptism of the latter's son on James's behalf. Soon after his return he was made lord lieutenant of Lincolnshire and steward of Queen Anne's manor of Grantham. These posts complemented various other local offices (especially in Nottinghamshire) which Rutland had already received from Elizabeth and James and reinforced his status as a magnate in the east midlands.<br>
<br>Although he participated in the entertainments for the visiting Christian IV in 1606 and the creation of Henry as prince of Wales in 1610, Rutland spent an increasing amount of his time on his country estates. His health may have been weak and he may also have been sensitive to comment about his infertility (the result of disease contracted during his continental tour, according to Ben Jonson; Herford and Simpson, 1.138). Rutland's marriage was also increasingly strained. Jonson observed that the countess lived as &#145;a widow'd wife&#146;, stirring an intense but apparently unrequited passion in Sir Thomas Overbury  (ibid., 8.224&#150;5; 11.88). In an elegy written upon her death, Francis Beaumont claimed that &#145;the chief blessing of women, marriage, was to thee nought but a sacrament of misery&#146;  (Dyce, 11.508). Rutland failed to attend parliament in 1610 and was so sick by May 1612 that he moved to Cambridge for specialist treatment. After suffering what seems to have been one or more strokes during May and June, he died in Cambridge on 26 June 1612. He was buried beside previous earls of Rutland at Bottesford, Leicestershire, on 22 July. He was succeeded as earl of Rutland by his brother Sir Francis Manners. Rutland's widow died within a fortnight of her husband's funeral, occasioning wild rumours that she had been poisoned by medicine supplied by Sir Walter Ralegh. Pointedly, she chose to be buried privately at St Paul's near her father rather than accept burial with her husband at Bottesford.<br>
