<span class="headword">Murray,  Eunice Guthrie</span>  (1878&#150;1960), <span class="occ">suffragist and author</span>, was born on 21 January 1878 at Moore Park, Cardross, Dunbartonshire, the third and youngest daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/50273/', "David Murray (1842&#150;1928)")</script>, a lawyer, and his wife, Frances Porter Stoddard (<i>d</i>. 1919). Frances Murray, whose parents on both sides were American with strong links to the abolitionist movement, shared with her husband an interest in all aspects of the women's movement. Eunice Murray was educated at St Leonard's School, St Andrews. Her two older sisters, Dorothy and Sylvia, graduated MA at Glasgow University and BA at Girton College, Cambridge, respectively.<br>
<br>In the late nineteenth century Eunice Murray became involved in philanthropic activities. She was active in the local branch of the League of Pity, volunteered regularly at a local settlement, and was an advocate for temperance. On 9 November 1896 she recorded reading about the formation of the National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies, commenting: &#145;I should like to join such a society for the question of the emancipation of my sex is a stirring one and leads to vital matters&#146;  (Murray, journals).<br>
<br>After the militant movement reached Scotland Murray, her mother, and sister Sylvia joined the Women's Freedom League (WFL). The WFL had a strong presence in Scotland, and from 1909 onwards Murray was the secretary for &#145;scattered members&#146;&#151;all those who did not live in Edinburgh, Glasgow, or Dundee. She was one of the three Scottish members on the WFL's national executive committee and in 1913 was described as president for Scotland of the WFL.<br>
<br>In June 1908 Teresa Billington-Greig asked Murray to ascertain the views of her neighbours toward women's suffrage. She received such a discouraging response that she concluded: &#145;If Cardross is an example 'twill be our great great great grandchildren that will vote&#146;  (Murray, journals). Nevertheless, she threw herself wholeheartedly into the campaign. She was articulate and persuasive both in print and in person, and her letters appeared regularly in the press. She went on to write suffrage pamphlets, including <span class="italic">The Illogical Sex</span>, <span class="italic">Prejudices Old and New</span>, and her most popular one, <span class="italic">Liberal Cant</span>, all published by the Scottish council of the WFL.<br>
<br>A telling response to Murray's oratory comes from a letter published in the <span class="italic">Glasgow Herald</span> on 17 July 1913 from a John Hunter in Rothesay, who had been disappointed when he learned that Murray would be appearing instead of the usual WFL speaker: &#145;but once I heard her convincing, eloquent and logical speech I was quite delighted, and feel persuaded if people had the opportunity of hearing her, and if Cabinet Ministers had that privilege, the vote would be won without delay&#146;.<br>
<br>In 1913 Murray attended the International Woman Suffrage Alliance conference in Budapest. After her return, on 17 November, she was arrested for obstruction after attempting to address a meeting near Downing Street. Although she could not have contemplated taking part in the arson and destruction campaign of the Women's Social and Political Union&#151;&#145;my type of mind could never do the things they do&#146;&#151;she was aware that those tactics brought awareness of the issues to everyone, and she laid no blame on the women&#151;&#145;No&#151;I blame the Government&#146;  (Murray, journals).<br>
<br>At the beginning of the war in August 1914 many women were thrown out of work, and their plight was a major concern of the WFL. A Women's Suffrage National Aid Corps was formed, with branches in Edinburgh and Glasgow, and Murray was on the executive committee. The WFL continued to campaign for the vote during the war years. In speeches and articles Murray stressed the dangers women would face in the labour market when the war ended, and also spoke about the changes brought about by the war in the attitudes of women previously in domestic service and other subservient positions. She also wrote a suffrage pamphlet, published by the WFL, about all the praise women were getting for their efforts during the war, entitled <span class="italic">Woman: the New Discovery</span>.<br>
<br>Murray had works published in a number of genres, including novels, local histories, and a memoir of her mother. In 1930, when most Scottish historians were interested only in political history, she published <span class="italic">Scottish Women of Bygone Days</span>, in which she broke with the traditional approach and discussed social and domestic life, including witchcraft, education, and sports. The book was dedicated <span class="italic">To the Women of All Ages who Defied Convention and Held Aloft the Banner of Progress</span>. In 1935 she turned to an older model and produced biographies in <span class="italic">A Gallery of Scottish Women</span>. An interest in social history developed later in Scotland than in many other countries, but again Eunice Murray was a pioneer. <span class="italic">Scottish Homespun</span> (1947) was a fascinating account of Scottish traditional costumes, and was illustrated by photographs of dolls (many of whose clothes were made by Murray herself). In the conclusion to this work Murray wrote that: &#145;Women have a two-fold calling, for not only are we as wives and mothers the guardians of the future, but we are also the custodians of the past&#146;  (<span class="italic">Scottish Homespun</span>, 105).<br>
<br>In 1918 Murray had the distinction of being the first woman to stand in a parliamentary election in Scotland&#151;as an independent candidate at Glasgow (Bridgeton)&#151;but she was unsuccessful. In 1923 she was elected on to Dunbartonshire county council, and in the same year she became the first president of the local Scottish Women's Rural Institute. But she did not restrict herself to campaigning on local issues, for she was involved with the National Trust for Scotland soon after its inception, serving on its council and executive committee from 1931, and donating generously to many of its appeals. Murray, who never married, was appointed MBE in 1945. She died on 26 March 1960 of cardiovascular degeneration and cerebral thrombosis at her family home, Moore Park, Cardross, Dunbartonshire.<br>
