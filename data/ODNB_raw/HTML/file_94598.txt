<span class="headword">Pantridge,  James Francis <span class="st"> [Frank]</span></span>  (1916&#150;2004), <span class="occ">cardiologist and inventor</span>, was born on 3 October 1916 on the outskirts of the village of Hillsborough, co. Down, Northern Ireland, the son of Robert James Pantridge, a small landowner and farmer who died when Pantridge was ten years old, and his wife, Elizabeth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> McCandless. He had one younger brother, Herbert, and a sister, Emily. He was educated at the village school and then at the Friends' school in the nearby market town of Lisburn. He entered Queen's University, Belfast, in 1934 to study medicine, qualifying in June 1939. He was a talented medical student who had the highest principles and did not suffer some of his teachers' shortcomings easily. In his final clinical examination in medicine he made a diagnosis of pleural effusion, but was told by the examiner that he was wrong&#151;that the patient had pneumonia. Failure in this case would have meant that he would fail the entire examination. Convinced that he was right, he persuaded the house officer on the ward to perform a pleural tap and took the resultant fluid that evening to the home of the professor of medicine. He handed the specimen to the maid at the door with a note summarizing the situation. He passed with honours.<br>
<br>Pantridge started as house physician at the Royal Victoria Hospital in Belfast on 1 August 1939. The Second World War was declared a month later on 3 September and the next day Pantridge was among eleven of the thirteen house officers who volunteered at the local military recruiting centre. They were made to wait for six months to acquire some clinical experience before being called up. In April 1940 Pantridge was posted to Singapore as medical officer to the second battalion, the Gordon Highlanders. He remained with the battalion right through the Japanese invasion of Malaya and the fall of Singapore on 15 February 1942. He was highly critical of the British politicians and military authorities and their strategy in the region. In contrast he remembered<blockquote>a remarkable <i>esprit de corps</i> in that officers' mess. I had never seen it before and I have never come across it since. It did not exist in any RAMC fraternity or army hospital and certainly not among the staff of any National Health Service hospital I was to encounter later. (<span class="italic">An Unquiet Life</span>, 17)</blockquote>During the campaign he was awarded the Military Cross, an honour rarely awarded to doctors in the field. The citation to support this award read:<blockquote>During the operations in Johore and Singapore &hellip; as medical officer attached to the second Gordons, this officer worked unceasingly under the most adverse conditions of continuous bombing and shelling and was an inspiring example to all with whom he came in contact. He was absolutely cool under the heaviest fire and completely regardless of his own personal safety at all times. (<span class="italic">An Unquiet Life</span>, preface by M. G. McGeown and A. H. G. Love, ix)</blockquote>After being taken prisoner of war Pantridge continued as medical officer for those building the Siam&#150;Burma railway in the &#145;death camp&#146; of Tambalya in Thailand, subsequently made famous in the film <span class="italic">Bridge over the River Kwai</span>. Conditions were unimaginable but he was a thorn in the flesh of his captors throughout his incarceration. Upon liberation in August 1945 he was described by a fellow medical officer from the Royal Victoria Hospital, Tom Millikin:<blockquote>I found Pantridge in one of the many huts &hellip; The upper half of his body was emaciated, skin and bones. The lower half was bloated with the dropsy of beri-beri. The most striking thing was the blue eyes that blazed with defiance. He was a physical wreck but his spirit was obviously unbroken. The eyes said it was indestructible. (<span class="italic">Unquiet Life</span>, x&#150;xi)</blockquote>He weighed just under 80 lb (30 kg).<br>
<br>After the war Pantridge returned to Northern Ireland to complete his year as a house officer at the Royal Victoria. He quickly graduated MD in 1946 and was admitted MRCP in 1947 and specialized in cardiology. He gained a scholarship to work at the University of Michigan with Frank Wilson, who was the world leader in electrocardiography at the time. He was very happy there and acquired a good knowledge of electronics which was to stand him in good stead later. He returned to Belfast in 1949 as a registrar and was appointed consultant physician and cardiologist in 1951.<br>
<br>In the early 1960s Pantridge reflected on the appalling mortality after myocardial infarction, noting that most deaths occurred in the first twelve hours and the majority in the first three hours. Patients suffering from symptoms of myocardial infarction were not usually admitted to hospital until twelve hours had elapsed. It was known that the initial rhythm in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest frequently was ventricular fibrillation and that this could be treated by prompt electrical defibrillation. He decided that the way forward was to bring intensive care facilities to the patient in the community, and with John Geddes, his senior house officer at the time, he created a mobile resuscitation team of doctors and nurses from the cardiac department who would travel with resuscitation equipment including a primitive defibrillator from the Royal Victoria Hospital in Belfast to the patient at the request of a general practitioner. A hundred thousand people lived within one mile of the hospital. At that time, defibrillation could only be provided by a mains powered device delivering a shock of alternating current (AC). Working with his technician, Alfred Mawhinney, Pantridge developed a &#145;portable&#146; defibrillator powered by two twelve-volt car batteries with a static converter to deliver 230 volts AC. This weighed 70 kg and could deliver a countershock within the ambulance but on occasions the heroic team had to manhandle it into a patient's home. During the ensuing years Pantridge and his team developed the first rechargeable miniature defibrillator, which weighed only 3.2 kg and delivered a direct current (DC) shock, which was much more effective in converting ventricular fibrillation.<br>
<br>Pantridge presented his results to the Association of Physicians (and published them in <span class="italic">The Lancet</span>) in 1967. He received a cool reception which he described later: &#145;We were disbelieved and indeed, to some extent ridiculed. The unfavourable comments emphasised the lack of need for pre-hospital coronary care, the prohibitive costs and the danger of moving a patient who had had a recent coronary attack&#146;  (<span class="italic">Unquiet Life</span>, 88). This was fairly typical of the &#145;can't do it&#146; mentality among many physicians and administrators in the UK at the time. Most physicians in the UK did not offer official support for portable defibrillators until 1975 and the Department of Health dithered until the 1980s when Sir Donald Acheson, an Ulsterman by birth, became its chief medical officer and lent his official support to the concept. The reception in the outside world was in sharp contrast. Leaders in the United States were quick to introduce the concept of mobile coronary care. Pantridge received accolades and honours galore in the United States, including a citation in the records of the House of Representatives.<br>
<br>Pantridge pulled no punches to achieve his mission and, while he could sometimes be difficult to work with, his achievements were always respected by his colleagues. His dedication to his patients was paramount and he would not tolerate anything that stood in the way of this, including laborious and ineffective administration, strikes by hospital staff, or the activities of paramilitary terrorist groups in Northern Ireland. He was effective in stirring the hearts and minds of the public and was able to raise funds and support for his mobile coronary care service in the community. He always acknowledged the considerable contribution of John Geddes to the development of the portable defibrillator. Two other prot&eacute;g&eacute;s, John Kernohan and Charles Wilson, had set up similar community cardiac services in other parts of Northern Ireland and produced data to support Pantridge's results. In the late 1960s Belfast was described as the &#145;safest place to have a heart attack&#146;.<br>
<br>Frank Pantridge was a sociable person, always happy to share a drink (not small or single) with amiable colleagues. He had a fund of stories from his &#145;unquiet life&#146;&#151;the title of his autobiography, published in 1989. He was great company with invariably stimulating conversation, a biting wit, and a unique and demonstrative body language. He enjoyed salmon fishing and was unmarried. He died on Boxing day, 26 December 2004, at the Royal Victoria Hospital, Belfast, of heart failure. He was cremated and his ashes were scattered in Hillsborough, where he was born, and where he had lived latterly in Corcreeny Road. A statue of him was erected in Lisburn, the town of his schooling. By the time of his death his pioneering work had saved countless lives all over the world. The Pantridge Trust was established in his name with the goal of improving cardiac care.<br>
