<span class="headword">Wightman <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>James]</span>,  Julia Bainbrigge</span>  (1817&#150;1898), <span class="occ">temperance activist and author</span>, was born on 23 January 1817 in the Bengal Residency, Cawnpore, India, third daughter of William James, lieutenant-colonel of the East India Company, of Saltford House, Somerset, and his wife, Mary Marshall, daughter of Lieutenant-General Sir Dyson Marshall. Following her mother's death in India, her father returned to England with his family about 1821 and settled at Saltford House, Saltford, Devon. Julia James met and married, on 1 December 1842 in Saltford church, Charles Edward Leopold Wightman (1816&#150;1896), the son of the Revd John Wightman and his wife, Elizabeth Gagaine. With him she moved to Shrewsbury, where his father had the living of St Alkmund's. Charles Wightman was appointed vicar of St Alkmund's Church and took responsibility for the parish. Julia Wightman devoted herself to parish work, including Sunday school and <span class="roman">Bible</span> classes. Her first philanthropic undertaking was the rescue of fallen young women: in 1843 she formed a local fund-raising committee, which initially sent girls to local penitentiaries. However, she disliked the existing penitentiary system, with its compulsory two-year residence and regimes of solitary confinement and haircuts upon admittance; after the Chester diocese declined to participate in a joint home with Shrewsbury, she organized the purchase of a house in Wyle Cop, the Salop Home, and was able to use her influence to discontinue such practices. Six years later the penitentiary moved to larger premises on Dogpole, and was eventually taken over by the St Julien's Home in 1866.<br>
<br>Julia Wightman is better known, however, for her temperance work and her book <span class="italic">Haste to the Rescue!</span>, an account of her temperance activities in Shrewsbury in the form of letters written to her sister, originally published in 1859. A temperance advocate from the early days of her marriage, after she found the cook drunk in the kitchen, both she and her husband attempted a teetotal way of life, although doctors continually prescribed alcohol for her delicate health. Julia Wightman's temperance work in the Shrewsbury community was inspired partly by reading Catherine Marsh's <span class="italic">English Hearts and Minds</span> (1858), an account of Marsh's work with navvies employed on the construction of the Crystal Palace, and partly by her own experience of the poverty, drunkenness, and associated problems of Butcher's Row, the working-class area of Shrewsbury around St Alkmund's Church. Her own book highlighted the extent of the drink problem and made many aware of the role of total abstinence in alleviating the effects of drink among the working classes.<br>
<br>Throughout her life Julia Wightman was scrupulous in linking all her work with Church of England doctrine and basing it, as she did all her philanthropic activities, around St Alkmund's Church. Despite this Christian-based approach to temperance she did not receive encouragement or support in the early days from the church, but was advised to discontinue the work. However, she was later credited with being one of the major influences in the establishment of the Church of England Temperance Society, founded after the National Temperance League had circulated all clergymen in the Church of England with a copy of her work. Determined to provide an alternative to the public house, Julia Wightman planned a Working Men's Hall to be a &#145;public house without the drink&#146;, first appealing for funds in June 1861. The site of The Fox inn, Shrewsbury, and its adjacent premises were purchased the following year for &pound;700. Royalties from <span class="italic">Haste to the Rescue!</span> contributed &pound;550 to the fund. The hall opened in April 1863 with further rooms planned. The total cost of the hall, including land, conversion, and new buildings, was to total over &pound;5000. Its opening was a cause for celebration in the town and was attended by 1000 people, including the bishop and a number of clergymen, gaining it the approval of the Church of England. All connected with the hall had to be total abstainers: the conveyance for the former Fox Inn and the new buildings contained clauses ensuring that the hall keepers should be total abstainers and specifying that all members of the executive committee should be members of the Church of England. The main buildings still exist.<br>
<br>The hall became the venue for many of Julia Wightman's Christian and philanthropic activities, including <span class="roman">Bible</span> classes for postmen and policemen, mothers' meetings, sewing classes, and temperance meetings; the church ragged school, founded in 1862, was transferred to it, all teachers and superintendents of the school being required to be teetotallers. After investigating the Irwell Dining Hall in Manchester, which provided cheap meals, Mrs Wightman ensured that the hall would provide a similar service for market people, as well as housing a club and coffee house. It became the venue for meetings of other philanthropic organizations, but no meetings could be held on the premises that condemned the Church of England. The last phase to be built included baths let to members of the public.<br>
<br>Having suffered from delicate health all her life Julia Wightman became unwell for the period 1868 to 1875. Despite her enforced absences from the parish she continued her interest in temperance and other philanthropic activities, writing letters to be read at meetings. After her recovery, in 1882, inspired by a visit from Ellice Hopkins, she founded the Shrewsbury Association for Friendless Girls, making it part of the Lichfield Diocesan Association. She also arranged the purchase of a former eye and ear hospital for conversion into a training school for servants and a free registry for those seeking jobs. Christianity and teetotalism was the bedrock of the training received by the girls. She was instrumental in founding branches of the YMCA and YWCA, despite the fact that she disagreed with the organizations' non-sectarian stance. These, like her other societies, were affiliated to St Alkmund's. In 1882 she began <span class="roman">Bible</span> classes for young businesswomen, and continued to be interested in these classes, writing letters to be read at meetings, until shortly before her death.<br>
<br>Julia Wightman played a significant role in making temperance work an acceptable activity for women. Mrs Sewell and Anna Sewell were inspired by her achievements, and as a result took up aggressive temperance work in Wick. Eleanor Harford Battersby added Christianity to her temperance work after reading <span class="italic">Haste to the Rescue!</span> and W. S. Caine (1842&#150;1903), later member of the executive of the United Kingdom Alliance, came to visit her and, despite his initial scepticism over the value of teetotalism, signed the pledge with her in 1858.<br>
<br>Julia Wightman's influence on the local Church of England community was great. In 1881 she intervened in the school board elections. There were nine seats available with eleven candidates; five churchmen, five nonconformists, and a Roman Catholic priest. A strong wave of anti-churchmen feeling existed; Mrs Wightman spoke on the issue at the Sunday meeting before the election and sent a letter on the subject to the Revd J. M. J. Fletcher, who circulated it as a handbill. She encouraged all to vote for the principle of religious instruction according to the established church, and, in the event, the five churchmen headed the poll. A firm sectarian, she would not tolerate criticism of the Church of England. Within her work there had to be conversion to the Church of England; unsectarian work was &#145;spiritual lawlessness&#146;. Her beliefs remained essentially conservative to the end: she was a fervent anti-Darwinist, producing a booklet <span class="italic">Evolution or Special Creation: which?</span> (n.d.) intended to vindicate the accepted biblical concept of creation. This was inspired by reading sermons advocating Darwinism preached by the bishops of Carlisle, Manchester, and Bedford at the Manchester meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science, and was published at the time of the Darwin memorial appeal in Shrewsbury.<br>
<br>Julia Wightman was supported in all her work by her husband, the Revd Prebendary Wightman: he assisted in the foundation of the St Alkmund's schools and did the administrative work in the purchase of the Fox Inn for the Working Men's Temperance Hall. He became a trustee of the hall, and as vicar of St Alkmunds was chairman of the committee for the building of the hall. He remained vicar of St Alkmunds, despite being offered other livings, until two years prior to his death in 1896. After an eleven-day illness Julia Wightman died of cardiac dilation and exhaustion following bronchitis on 14 January 1898 at The Crescent, Shrewsbury. She was buried with her husband in general cemetery, Roman Road, Shrewsbury, on 25 January.<br>
