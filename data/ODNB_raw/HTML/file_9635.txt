<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Fitzroy,  Henry</span>, duke of Richmond and Somerset  (1519&#150;1536), <span class="occ">royal bastard</span>, was born in 1519, probably in June and at the priory of St Lawrence, Blackmore, near Ingatestone, Essex, the illegitimate son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/12955/', "Henry VIII (1491&#150;1547)")</script> and his mistress <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/73234/', "Elizabeth Blount (c.1500&#150;1539x41)")</script>. As the king's only male issue at the time of his birth the child was a valuable asset. Arrangements for his care were initially entrusted to his godfather, Thomas Wolsey. Plans for his elevation were possibly already in hand by April 1525. On 7 June in that year he was elected knight of the Garter (installed on the 25th). On 18 June 1525 he was created earl of Nottingham and on the same day he received the unprecedented honour of a double dukedom. As duke of Richmond and Somerset he was endowed with lands whose revenues amounted to &pound;4845 in the first year. On 16 July 1525 he became lord admiral of England.<br>
<br>His advancement provoked speculation that the king intended to make Richmond his heir. However his appointment as warden-general of the marches toward Scotland on 22 June 1525 was part of a more immediate policy. From 28 August 1525 to 16 June 1529 he lived principally in Yorkshire, at Sheriff Hutton or at Pontefract, at the centre of a full-scale ducal household, in his capacity as head of the newly resurrected council of the north. Although well educated in Latin, Greek, French, and music, by tutors who included John Palsgrave, Richard Croke, and William Saunders, he was an active child who much preferred outdoor pursuits and had to be bribed to settle to his books. His marriage was first mooted in February 1527 to counter the interest of Henri, duc d'Orl&eacute;ans, and James V of Scotland in the hand of Catherine de' Medici. In March 1527 hopes that a match with the Infanta Maria of Portugal might be a means to fracture a Franco-imperial alliance led to rumours he was to be made king of Ireland. This speculation was fuelled when he became lord lieutenant of Ireland on 22 June 1529. An innovative method of government using an executive board in Dublin was later abandoned when the appointment of a deputy on 22 June 1530 saw a return to the traditional model. On 9 August 1529 he was summoned to parliament, often attending the sessions in person. In his role as a magnate he was treated as if he were adult and great care was taken to see that his authority was respected.<br>
<br>After Thomas Wolsey's downfall, in October 1529, responsibility for the care of Richmond passed to Thomas Howard, third duke of Norfolk. This choice was no doubt influenced by Anne Boleyn. At the same time negotiations began for his marriage to one of Norfolk's daughters. From April 1530 he was often resident at Windsor where Henry Howard, earl of Surrey, was among his companions. In October 1532 he accompanied Henry VIII to Calais for his meeting with Fran&ccedil;ois I. As a result of negotiations between them he was sent to reside at the French court. Accepted as a member of the king's privy chamber and lodged with the dauphin, he spent the winter in Paris before accompanying the court on its summer progress. He was recalled on 25 August 1533, and after his return to England he married, on 26 November 1533, Mary Howard  [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9638/', "Fitzroy, Mary (c.1519&#150;1555?)")</script>], younger daughter of the duke of Norfolk and his second wife, Elizabeth Stafford, with a dispensation for relation in the fourth degree of consanguinity. Due to their youth the union was never consummated. Nevertheless Henry's continuing usefulness was demonstrated in a range of responsibilities including lieutenancy of the Order of the Garter (17 May 1534). In November 1534 he hosted a feast in honour of the French admiral, and in February 1535 he entertained the imperial ambassador. His presence at the execution of the Carthusians on 4 May 1535 and of Anne Boleyn on 19 May 1536 was taken as a sign of royal approval in these events.<br>
<br>The terms of the 1536 <span class="roman">Succession Act</span> renewed interest in the possibility of Richmond's succeeding his father. In many respects he was an ideal candidate. Widely reported to be as intelligent, articulate, and as athletic as his father, the danger of a minority was fast receding. His relationship with Henry VIII was consistently good. Numerous gifts and letters were indications of a genuine affection between them. However, still confident in his ability to produce a legitimate son, Henry VIII never chose to recognize him as his heir. There is no sign that his premature death was anticipated: his only previous indisposition was a brief illness in January 1532. His appointments as chamberlain of Chester and north Wales, lord warden of the Cinque Ports, and constable of Dover Castle in May 1536 provide evidence of continuing royal favour. At his last recorded public appearance, on 8 June 1536 at the opening of parliament, his health gave no cause for concern. His only known portrait is a miniature attributed to Lucas Horenbout, which shows Richmond bareheaded and in his shirt. Sometimes supposed to have been painted on his deathbed, it was probably taken about 1533&#150;4, and was intended as an <i>aide-m&eacute;moire</i> for Richmond's inclusion in the illustrations, assigned to Horenbout, for the new register of the Order of the Garter.<br>
<br>The first notice of Richmond's illness occurs on 8 July 1536. He died barely two weeks later, on the 23rd, of a pulmonary infection, at St James's Palace. Arrangements for his funeral were entrusted to the duke of Norfolk. It seems the intention was to attract as little notice as possible. The wooden coffin was hidden in straw and taken in secret to be quietly laid to rest some distance from the capital. He was buried at Thetford Priory, and after that house's dissolution was interred in St Michael's Church, Framlingham, Suffolk.<br>
