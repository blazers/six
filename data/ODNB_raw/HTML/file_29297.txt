<span class="headword">Whitelocke,  Bulstrode</span>, appointed Lord Whitelocke under the protectorate  (1605&#150;1675), <span class="occ">lawyer and politician</span>, was the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29299/', "Sir James Whitelocke (1570&#150;1632)")</script>, judge, and his wife, Elizabeth (1575&#150;1631), daughter of Edward and Cecily Bulstrode of Hedgerly Bulstrode. He was born in Fleet Street, London, on 6 August 1605, at the home of his mother's uncle, Sir George Croke. The second of seven children, only he and two sisters survived childhood.<h2>
<a name="Earlylife"></a>Early life</h2>Much of what is known about Whitelocke is drawn from his own writings; he kept a diary, which begins autobiographically with a record of his birth and early years, before turning into yearly, then daily records of his public and private life. He gave another version of events up to 1660, in &#145;Annales of his own life dedicated to his children&#146;. At Whitelocke's baptism, at St Dunstan-in-the-West on 19 August, his unpredictable uncle and godfather, Edmund Whitelocke, announced that the baby's name was Bulstrode; offering Elizabeth when asked for an alternative, he said he was resolved the boy should have one of his mother's names. Taught by his mother, Whitelocke was reading by the age of four and at seven was sent to boarding-school during his father's brief imprisonment. About 1614 he was sent to Eton College, but about 1615 transferred to Merchant Taylors' School. He led a gang of boys in street-fighting against boys from St Paul's School and &#145;many a blacke eye and bloudy nose was had among them&#146; before the twelve-year-old Whitelocke acted as &#145;ambassador&#146; in an &#145;Ambassy for peace&#146; arranged by the masters (a foretaste of the future) and gave them an oration, in Latin, on the miseries of civil war and the benefits of peace. In 1619 he went to St John's College, Oxford, and was taught philosophy and logic by the president, William Laud, and by his tutor, Philip Parsons, but was prevented from taking his degree by an accident. Unable to afford a horse for hunting, he followed on foot; on one occasion he injured his leg and lay in a meadow near Islip for about two hours until taken by coach, in &#145;unspeakable torment&#146;, to his parents' home at Fawley Court near Henley-on-Thames.<br>
<br>In 1622 Whitelocke entered the Middle Temple. He developed an ambition to go on the grand tour but his father persuaded him to explore his own country first and he followed the judges' circuits, being handsomely entertained, studying legal cases, and visiting places of interest. Through his father's influence, he was returned an MP for both Stafford and Boroughbridge in 1626, choosing to represent the former. The following year he was called to the bar and undertook another tour, of the west country and Wales, including visits to Stonehenge, Old Sarum, Maiden Castle, Sandfoot Castle, Penzance, Land's End, Glastonbury, and Wookey Hole by candle-light. At twenty-three, he was chosen master of the revels at the Middle Temple by his colleagues. When the formal revels began, attended by courtiers and others, he entertained lavishly and by Christmas was deeply in debt. He dared not tell his father and his only escape was to earn money as a barrister. He made &pound;152 16<i>s</i>. in one year on the Oxfordshire circuit and, by 1632, was appointed recorder of Abingdon and counsel for the corporation of Henley. That year his legal fees brought in &pound;310 11<i>s</i>. and, with an allowance from his father of &pound;400, he cleared his debts. In 1630 his marriage had been arranged to the charming but unstable Rebecca Benet 
    (Bennet; 1609&#150;1634)
  , daughter of alderman Thomas Benet, sheriff of London. Their only child, James, was born in 1631. Whitelocke's mother died the same year and his father the next and, in obedience to a clause in his father's will, he had an impressive monument to them erected in Fawley church. His inheritance left him well off, and he lived at Fawley Court with his family. He was put in charge of the music for a royal masque, <span class="italic">The Triumph of Peace</span>, to be presented by the inns of court in the banqueting hall, Whitehall, for Candlemas 1634. He composed a coranto in collaboration with Simon Ive; Queen Henrietta Maria said she could not believe such a lively tune was by an Englishman, and Whitelocke claimed that it remained popular for the next thirty years.<br>
<br>Early in 1634 Rebecca Whitelocke's condition deteriorated; she became violent and was placed in the care of a doctor who claimed he could cure her, provided no one visited her for about six months. Greatly distressed, Whitelocke left for France with a friend. Two innkeepers' wives showed concern for the sad young Englishman; he was guarded in his record as to what this implied, but wrote to a discreet friend in England, asking him to send 72 yards of coloured ribbon &#145;for a lady to whom I am much ingaged&#146;  (Longleat, Whitelocke MSS, vi, fol. 93). Friends in England kept in touch, including his close friend at the time, Edward Hyde. Dr Bartlett wrote that Rebecca's condition improved until her mother insisted on seeing her and talking to her in private, after which Rebecca stopped eating. She died on 9 May. Mrs Benet announced that she would petition for custody of her grandchild and for profits from Whitelocke's estate to be paid to her, until it was known whether he was still alive. He immediately returned to England, shrewdly defeating a plot by French sailors to throw him and his companion overboard and keep their luggage.<br>
<br>Whitelocke wrote that he was now a new beginner in the world. He was twenty-nine, a single father, and owner of a large estate. William Cooke, a tenant farmer, told his young landlord bluntly that he was entertaining too lavishly, his belongings were being sold in Henley market, and the house needed a good wife to look after it. He mentioned Frances Willoughby (1614&#150;1649), daughter of William, third Lord Willoughby of Parham, and niece of the dowager countess of Sunderland, who was staying with her aunt at Hambleden. Whitelocke found a pretext for calling on the countess. He claimed he was so far from thoughts of wooing that he went in shabby clothes with untrimmed hair and beard, but when Frances Willoughby appeared it was love at first sight. The courtship developed with the countess's approval, and that of three-year-old James, who called Frances his lady. Soon Whitelocke was summoned to London, charged by the council with being &#145;disaffected to the church&#146; because of his refusal, as recorder of Abingdon, to take action against nonconformists. Back in Fawley he called on Frances but during his absence her uncle and trustee, George Manners, earl of Rutland, had announced that his niece could not marry a commoner. The couple exchanged secret notes, and arranged an elopement. They were married in Fawley Court chapel, then were driven to The Ship in Fleet Street for their honeymoon. London society rallied round, eventually Frances's family became reconciled, and from 1 August 1635 the couple actually stayed with Rutland at Belvoir Castle. At first they delighted in the grandeur, but they soon grew weary of great feasting and ceremony and went home. They enjoyed fourteen years of happiness together and brought up six daughters and three sons. Whitelocke later expressed amazement that, with no political training, Frances could give such wise advice, and he claimed that there was never a cross word between them.<h2>
<a name="Civilwar"></a>Civil war</h2>Whitelocke began to be recognized at the Berkshire, Buckinghamshire, and Oxfordshire assizes. As chairman of the quarter sessions in Oxford, he spoke in support of the temporal courts against the encroachments of ecclesiastical jurisdiction, and gained local popularity by resisting the extension of Wychwood Forest and supporting John Hampden's opposition to the second ship-money writ of 1635. In 1640 he was elected to the Long Parliament for Marlow. Reluctantly he accepted chairmanship of the select committee to prepare the impeachment of Thomas Wentworth, earl of Strafford. He drafted the bill ensuring that the Long Parliament could not be adjourned or dissolved without consent of both houses and joined in proceedings against illegal decrees by convocation. He spent some time with Frances and their children at Fawley Court, and at Abingdon quarter sessions. Early in 1642 he was appointed a deputy lieutenant of Buckinghamshire and of Oxfordshire but accepted military posts with misgivings. In the Commons he favoured the joint authority of king and parliament over the militia and spoke against raising an army, stressing the miseries of civil war. He urged parliament to send propositions of peace to the king. In the summer of 1642 he found people around Fawley terrified at the prospect of parliament raising an army. They were arming themselves and he did so too. In August he and others wrote to the speaker, warning of plans to implement the king's commission of array at Watlington to secure recruits for the royal army. He and a troop of horsemen attacked, capturing some royalists. He advised Lord Saye to garrison Oxford before the king's army did so, but his advice was ignored and in due course royalists seized the city. Other royalist troops under Sir John Byron captured Fawley Court and despite orders not to plunder they ravaged the house, breaking open chests, burning books, and lighting their pipes on Whitelocke's manuscripts. Yet Whitelocke refused to see either party as wholly in the right or in the wrong and worked continuously to promote peace. He was appointed governor of Henley garrison; later, in 1644, he declined the command of the forces of the associated counties of Berkshire, Buckinghamshire, and Oxfordshire. In 1643 he was chosen as one of parliament's commissioners to carry propositions of peace to the king in Oxford. In his account of their stay in the city and of the negotiations, he recorded that he thought Charles showed ability and judgement, but trusted other people's judgement more than his own, causing him to change his mind overnight. Attending parliament again, Whitelocke moved with his family to Highgate. He was there when he heard that his property, The Bell inn, Henley, had been set on fire, and that parliament's soldiers, garrisoned at Phyllis Court, another estate of his near Henley, had plundered the place although he was a parliament man, &#145;butt bruitish soldiers make no distinctions&#146;. In the Commons he often wore a long coat like a cassock, causing MPs to call &#145;in Drollery &hellip; Mr Deane, Mr Deane&#146;; Cromwell called him that &#145;in mirth&#146;. By September 1644, with no rents from his plundered estates and earning no legal fees, Whitelocke had to sell his coach and horses.<br>
<br>In November 1644 Whitelocke was once again sent to the king by parliament, to arrange for fresh peace talks. After waiting four hours in the cold, apparently on Headington Hill, the commissioners were allowed to enter Oxford. Dirt and stones were thrown at their coaches; they were abused as rogues, traitors, and rebels, and were lodged in a squalid inn. Despite the commissioners' safe conduct their servants were attacked by two royalist officers, whom Whitelocke and Denzil Holles managed to disarm; the governor duly imprisoned the offenders and placed a guard at the door. The commissioners read parliament's propositions to the king, who said he would consider them. Next day, casually encountering Whitelocke and Holles, the king asked them to write down, unofficially, what they thought he should answer. Embarrassed, they wrote (in an assumed hand) that he should go to parliament immediately, but instead, he wrote expressing his desire for peace. In December 1644, at Westminster, Whitelocke and Maynard were summoned by the earl of Essex to a private meeting, attended by the Scottish commissioners and others wishing &#145;to rid Cromwell out of the way&#146; as a contentious &#145;incendiary&#146;. The two lawyers firmly opposed bringing this charge unless adequate proof were available. Late in January 1645 he joined in the attempt to negotiate a treaty at Uxbridge, where accommodation was even worse than in Oxford. He was sent to parliament on 17 February to report on the difficult negotiations but with parliament unable to find any solutions to avert an impasse the talks broke down. In July Whitelocke and Holles were accused by Thomas Savile, earl of Sussex, of high treason because of their private dealings with the king in Oxford. Both were cleared of the charge and told that they could, if they wished, prosecute Savile (by then in the Tower) for damages. By May 1646 Whitelocke was on very good terms with Cromwell. A year later he spoke against parliament's plans to disband the New Model Army, arguing that a victorious army, unemployed, was liable to assume power over its leaders. In this he opposed Holles, against whom the army once more brought accusations relating to the 1644 contacts with the king, in which Whitelocke had also been involved. In the meantime, having recovered his Fawley estate, Whitelocke moved his ever-growing family to Phyllis Court, attending more to his legal business than to parliament. He had been appointed attorney to the duchy of Lancaster and in March 1648 the Commons voted him a keeper of the great seal, for one year, at a salary of &pound;1000.<h2>
<a name="Thekingsexecutionandtheprotectorate"></a>The king's execution and the protectorate</h2>Whitelocke kept busy in his judicial post during the army's seizure of power at the end of 1648, though in late December he and his colleague Sir Thomas Widdrington did discuss with Cromwell the future of the nation, and worked on plans for a compromise settlement between army and parliament. On 23 December he was appointed to a committee of thirty-eight to prepare charges against King Charles. He never attended it: he had spoken in the Commons against the trial and &#145;resolved to hazard all, rather then to goe contrary to his conscience&#146;. On 30 January 1649, the day of Charles's execution, he &#145;stayed all day att home, troubled att the death of the King this day, &amp; praying to God to keep his judgements from us&#146;. On 14 February he was appointed to the new council of state, but avoided giving approval of recent events, which was at first required of members. He opposed the abolition of the House of Lords but was compelled to draft the bill enacting it. He tried to refuse appointment as a commissioner of the great seal of the Commonwealth; the Commons rejected his excuses and he defended his decision to continue on grounds of &#145;necessity&#146; and the need to preserve the course of the law.<br>
<br>On 16 May 1649 Whitelocke's wife Frances died; he was distraught. After he returned to work, sometimes in tears, he was put in charge of the late king's rare books and medals in St James's Library. In November 1649 he denounced proposals to expel lawyers from parliament, and took part in law reform (including the conduct of legal proceedings in English). He was a constant defender of the common law and his profession. By 1650 friends had begun to introduce him to eligible widows, but he would only consider marrying somebody who would be kind to his ten children. Within days of the February funeral of Rowland Wilson MP, friends suggested Whitelocke should approach his childless widow, Mary (<i>d</i>. 1684), daughter of Bigley Carleton, a London grocer, but he thought it too soon. In April 1650 her chaplain, the Independent minister George Cokayn, brought them together in London and in June the couple met at the home of Cokayn's parents at Cotton End, Bedfordshire, and the courtship began. Mary said she liked Whitelocke's honesty in saying that his money and estates must go to his ten children, while if he and Mary had children she must support them from the fortune left to her by Wilson. On 5 August they rode to Bromham church and were married secretly and on 5 September they were married again, in Hackney church, the speaker and other MPs attending the ceremony. Mary was as tender towards her ten stepchildren as if they were her own, but was in some ways more indulgent than an &#145;own Mother&#146;. Her first child, Samuel (for whom she later wrote &#145;Advice to her son Samuel&#146;), was born on 30 May 1651; four more sons and two daughters followed.<br>
<br>In September 1651 parliament sent Whitelocke and three others to congratulate Cromwell on his victory at Worcester against the future Charles II. In November, when Cromwell asked him to support a relative's case in chancery, Whitelocke said he could only follow his conscience and heard later that Cromwell had expected more compliance. The same thing occurred when Cromwell consulted him about the settlement of the nation, as a republic or a modified monarchy; Whitelocke favoured mixed monarchy. In June 1652 he was offered the profitable post of commissioner for the government of Ireland but refused it, believing Cromwell and others wanted him out of the way. Walking in St James's Park in November Whitelocke chanced to meet Cromwell, who respectfully asked his opinion on the state of the country. Whitelocke said that the army was too powerful while many MPs were corrupt, with nobody to control them. Suddenly Cromwell asked &#145;What if a man should take uppon him to be King?&#146; Whitelocke rejected the idea, saying that Cromwell had as much power as a king, without the title, but that if there were to be a monarch Charles Stuart, king of the Scots, was now so weak that he would accept any terms. Cromwell's manner changed. In April 1653 Whitelocke opposed plans to dissolve the Rump Parliament. In Cromwell's speech at the forced dissolution he was reported as &#145;looking sometimes and pointing upon particular persons&#146; including Whitelocke, &#145;to whom he gave very sharp language, though he named them not&#146;  (R. Blencave, ed., <span class="italic">Sydney Papers</span>, 1825, 140). In August 1653 Whitelocke was named as ambassador-extraordinary to Queen Kristina of Sweden. Mary, who was pregnant, begged him not to go, interpreting the appointment as a punishment for having confronted Cromwell, for refusing to judge the king, and for championing the law and the people's rights. His mission was to secure a treaty of amity and the freedom of the Sound. In November he sailed for Sweden with six ships, some ninety-seven men, three laundry-women, and a coach and horses. They landed in G&ouml;teborg and on 30 November, with local saddle-horses and wagons, the convoy set off for Uppsala, to be greeted ceremoniously on 20 December. Whitelocke's charm and diplomacy worked well with the young queen. He recorded their conversations in direct speech, including Kristina's confiding in him her decision to abdicate, and his attempt to dissuade her. They became friendly enough to joke and tease each other. Whitelocke negotiated a treaty of amity, which has never been revoked, and was knighted by Kristina. Other matters were postponed for future negotiation. Cromwell, meanwhile, was proclaimed lord protector. Whitelocke and his retinue left Uppsala in May 1654, travelling home via Germany. At a party in Hamburg he was taken very ill. His doctor suspected poison. After nearly being shipwrecked Whitelocke's vessel anchored near Gravesend on 30 June. He disembarked the next day and joined his family in Chelsea, to an emotional welcome, after eight months' absence.<br>
<br>Cromwell welcomed his return and, two days later, greeted Whitelocke in Whitehall with a show of affection. On 14 July Whitelocke took the oath as a commissioner of the new great seal. He was elected for Buckinghamshire in the first protectorate parliament, which met on 3 September 1654. He reported to the house on his embassy, and was voted &pound;2000 to cover arrears. After Cromwell summarily dissolved parliament on 22 January 1655 Whitelocke was approached by the Leveller John Wildman, inviting him to join in a conspiracy against Cromwell, but although he thought the conspirators' declaration on liberty and justice was sound he refused to take part. Cromwell instructed the keepers of the great seal to endorse an ordinance to reform chancery, which he and his council had prepared. Whitelocke and Widdrington objected, claiming that only parliament had authority to alter matters of law. They were dismissed on 8 June, losing a substantial part of their income. Conscious that they had exercised liberty of conscience, Cromwell recompensed them, on 2 July, by renewing their appointments as commissioners of the treasury, at &pound;1000 a year each. Later that month Whitelocke was appointed, with two others, to welcome the Swedish ambassador, who came to negotiate a trade agreement, which was duly concluded. A member of the committee for trade and navigation, Whitelocke was consulted by Cromwell on foreign affairs. In the second protectorate parliament, which assembled on 17 September 1656, he was again returned for Buckinghamshire. On 27 January 1657 Speaker Widdrington was too ill to take the chair and the house appointed Whitelocke to take his place. He described it as the most difficult, troublesome employment he had ever experienced. Friends said he kept them to the point in debates and dispatched more business than in all previous weeks. He was cordially thanked by the house, and paid &pound;500. Ironically, in view of his earlier advice, Whitelocke was appointed chairman of the committee presenting &#145;The humble petition and advice&#146;, asking the protector to take the title of king. Cromwell refused. At a second attempt he appeared to be amenable, then changed his mind since it might cause mutiny in the army. About this time he often consulted Whitelocke and others behind closed doors. After three or four hours they would relax, and he and Whitelocke would smoke their pipes. Whitelocke welcomed the freedom conferred by the adjournment of parliament from 26 June 1657, but started suffering from kidney stones. On 10 December he received a writ of summons to the protector's new upper house as Lord Whitelocke, and he reported his refusal of Cromwell's offer of a viscountcy. Whitelocke had protested in vain at the suppression of Christmas worship by soldiers, arguing that this was contrary to liberty of conscience.<br>
<br>Cromwell died on 3 September 1658, his son Richard succeeding as lord protector. Whitelocke was often consulted by Richard Cromwell (whom he refers to by his first name) and wrote of Richard's behaving discreetly and better than was expected. At the old protector's funeral, on 23 November, Whitelocke was one of twelve pallbearers. Unsolicited, Richard reappointed him a keeper of the great seal. By May 1659 the regime had collapsed and army officers took it on themselves to invite back members of the Rump of the Long Parliament, without a king, a single person, or House of Lords. Whitelocke was elected a member of the new council of state, but lost his commissionership of the great seal, and refused the post of a commissioner to mediate peace between Sweden and Denmark, at their negotiations over the Sound. Thomas Scott, the regicide, hinted falsely that Whitelocke was corresponding with Charles II or one of his ministers. In July and August, as president of the council, Whitelocke received reports of insurrections, including that of Sir George Booth, in Lancashire and Cheshire, which was suppressed; he received a letter begging him to spare the rebel's life, which he did. On 13 October the discontented army expelled parliament and Whitelocke was sent for by the council of state to face the officers. To avoid bloodshed, it was agreed that parliament would not sit, the general council of officers would provide for preservation of peace, and a new form of government would be devised. The officers chose Whitelocke, with twenty-two others, to govern under the title the committee of safety. He consented, believing this was better than to have soldiers governing with the sword. He was chosen, with five others, to plan a form of commonwealth government, and was appointed keeper of the great seal. By the end of November he sensed that George Monck intended to restore the king; he wanted Monck checked but was ignored. Instructed by the council of officers, he sealed a proclamation, in December, summoning a parliament for 4 January, without a king or House of Lords, but when the officers tried to stipulate election methods and MPs' qualifications, he insisted it would be contrary to his oath to seal such writs.<h2>
<a name="Restorationandlatercareer"></a>Restoration and later career</h2>Restoration being inevitable, Whitelocke was asked to urge Fleetwood to send someone trustworthy to the king to negotiate reasonable terms, rather than allow Monck to arrange an unconditional restoration. Charles Fleetwood, the commander-in-chief, asked Whitelocke whether he would go and Whitelocke agreed, but shortly afterwards Vane and Desborough made Fleetwood change his mind. The Rump Parliament reassembled yet again on 26 December, with Monck's support. Whitelocke knew he would meet with hostility, having served on the committee of safety, and stayed away. A note from Speaker Lenthall reminded him of his duty to attend but when he did so he found some former friends were very reserved. There was talk of sending him to the Tower. Disguised in a long coat, on the snowy evening of 30 December he rode out of London with a servant of Samuel Wilson (Mary's brother-in-law). Soon Whitelocke pulled off the road to put on a periwig, as further disguise, and they made their way to Hunsdon House, Hertfordshire, home of William Willoughby, where he arrived without warning but was welcomed and protected. On Whitelocke's instructions, Mary returned the great seal to the speaker, who commended the action. She wrote to her husband through Willoughby, reporting, on 10 January 1660, that parliament was planning to consider the case of MPs who had served on the committee of safety. He returned to London but decided it was too dangerous to appear in parliament. Mary brought him news of events, and on 24 January he was summoned to attend the house in a week's time, or be fined &pound;20. He was undaunted, but hoped Monck's expected arrival might alter parliament's plans, which it did. On 18 February Monck indicated that he favoured the readmission of MPs excluded in 1648. Despite this, Whitelocke expected to be arrested.<br>
<br>On 1 May 1660 Charles II's declaration of Breda was brought to parliament, granting free pardon to all who applied within forty days, apart from any whom parliament might except. The king entered London ceremoniously on 29 May 1660. In June Whitelocke wrote an impressive defence of his political record&#151;he was in jeopardy from people he had opposed in court or parliament, who now wanted revenge. Monck, a former friend whom he had helped, asserted (with others) that, under the second exception of the <span class="roman">Act of Pardon and Oblivion</span>, Whitelocke should be disabled from ever again holding office. Whitelocke visited Monck, who acknowledged that they had been friends but said that Whitelocke's telling the common council that he, Monck, was planning the Restoration might have ruined the whole enterprise. Whitelocke obtained a certificate, addressed to the Commons and signed by several royalists, confirming acts of kindness he had done for them when they were in trouble and he in power. But there were demands for money: the earl of Berkshire, whose daughter had been imprisoned by order of the committee of safety, demanded &pound;500; if the money was not forthcoming, he would persuade the Lords to have Whitelocke excepted. Thomas Napper, Whitelocke's former clerk and later a royalist colonel, fulfilled his promise to help Whitelocke in return for past kindnesses and arranged an interview with the king in June 1660. This went well; Whitelocke restored the treasures from the royal library, telling the king he could have sold the fifth-century <span class="roman">Codex Alexandrinus</span> for &pound;4000 overseas, but saved it for his majesty. This valuable introduction appeared to be a friendly gesture, but the following year Napper came for his reward, expecting at least &pound;500. Whitelocke paid &pound;250, which was accepted disdainfully. In parliament Whitelocke's pardon was carried by fifty voices in June 1660; he wished to have this confirmed under the great seal but had to send the chancellor (former friend Ned Hyde) a &#145;present&#146; of &pound;250, plus &#145;fees&#146; totalling &pound;37 18<i>s</i>. 8<i>d</i>.<br>
<br>In July 1660 Whitelocke and his family moved to a house in Coleman Street, returning sometimes to Fawley Court. He was in the country in January 1661 when news came of the Coleman Street riot, led by the Fifth Monarchist Thomas Venner. Soldiers raided his Coleman Street house and enemies told the king, falsely, that Whitelocke lived in Coleman Street to advise the &#145;fanatics&#146;. Some days later, Charles announced that Whitelocke was unfit to serve as a governor of Sutton Hospital. In due course Whitelocke moved to Chancery Lane, closer to his Middle Temple chambers; he also purchased Chilton Lodge, near Hungerford, with Mary's money. Unsolicited, he had decided to write a treatise for King Charles, entitled &#145;Whitelockes notes uppon the kings writt for choosing members of parliament&#146; (published posthumously in 1766). He handed the work, one volume at a time, to the chancellor who told him, on receiving the second of three volumes in April 1661, that the king was very pleased with the first. In March 1663 the king sent a message asking Whitelocke to write his opinion on the royal prerogative in matters ecclesiastical (following parliament's rejection of his first declaration of indulgence). There was no suggestion of payment, but Whitelocke had welcomed Charles's promise, at Breda, to allow freedom of conscience. By 25 March he finished &#145;The kings right to graunt indulgence in matters of religion&#146;. Although his monthly earnings were small, in December 1663 he sealed the lease on a large house in Fleet Street, giving up the one in Chancery Lane.<br>
<br>Whitelocke's diary entries grow shorter from this time, with references to family illnesses and discontent. Although suffering from kidney stones, dropsy, and piles, he continued his legal work. Prince Rupert consulted him in June 1671 on his rights as constable of Windsor Castle, saying that an opinion in Whitelocke's hand would satisfy the king. Fees from clients are noted monthly in the diary, ranging from 5 shillings for a servant, to &pound;20 on one occasion, but usually 10 shillings or &pound;1. In June 1675, ill though he was, he earned &pound;5. In July, the month in which he died, he entered two fees of 10 shillings. In the last ten years of his life, with a restricted income from rents and fees, and with some of his children at home young enough to be grandchildren, he still spent money improving his land. Active as ever with his writing, besides his diary, which he continued until a week before he died, he wrote fair copies of sermons he preached to the family. He sometimes attended the local church before conducting a conventicle at Chilton Lodge, which was open house to outsiders wishing to attend; the church sometimes sent a spy. He often preached, as did the popular Independent minister, George Cokayn. A young client, the Quaker William Penn, sometimes came to hear Whitelocke, sometimes to preach himself. Years later Penn published <span class="italic">Quench not the Spirit</span> (1711), a selection of Whitelocke's sermons, describing him as &#145;one of the most accomplished Men of the Age&#146; and quoting his definition of religion as &#145;the Work of the Spirit of God in the Hearts and Souls of Men&#146;. Whitelocke died on 28 July 1675, a few days before his seventieth birthday, and was buried, as he wished, unostentatiously in Fawley church on 6 August. The pleasures and concerns of family life weave in and out of his public life, in his diary and &#145;Annales&#146;, but were expunged by the editor of &#145;Annales&#146;, Arthur Annesley, earl of Anglesey, when publishing them as <span class="italic">Memorials of the English Affairs</span> in 1682. An edition of <span class="italic">The Diary of Bulstrode Whitelocke, 1605&#150;1675</span> was published in 1990.<h2>
<a name="Assessmentsoftheman"></a>Assessments of the man</h2>A &#145;trimmer&#146;, who swam with the tide, or a man who spoke up for law and freedom of conscience? Whitelocke was despised by some historians down to the late twentieth century. Thomas Carlyle labelled him &#145;Dryasdust&#146;, &#145;our Pedant friend&#146; who showed &#145;occasional friskiness; most unexpected, as if the hippopotamus should show a tendency to dance&#146;. Charles Morton, editing the first edition of Whitelocke's <span class="italic">Journal of the Swedish Ambassy</span> (1772), described him as &#145;a man of sense, learning, integrity, spirit, temper &hellip; and knowledge of the world&#146;. Sir Charles Firth in the <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span> considered his work was &#145;greatly overestimated by Whig writers&#146;. Whitelocke emerges from his own records as highly intelligent, musical, flamboyant, with a good opinion of himself, very loving, refusing to toe a party line if he thought it was wrong, and consistently a staunch defender of freedom.<br>
