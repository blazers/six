<span class="headword">Whitaker,  Thomas Dunham</span>  (1759&#150;1821), <span class="occ">topographer and antiquary</span>, was born on 8 June 1759 at the rectory, East Raynham, Norfolk, son of William Whitaker (1730&#150;1782) and his wife, Lucy (<i>d</i>. 1788), daughter of Robert Dunham and widow of Ambrose Allen. His father had been curate of East and West Raynham from 1756, but in 1760 he succeeded to his family's ancestral estate at Holme in Cliviger, between Burnley and Todmorden in Lancashire. In November 1766 Whitaker was sent to board at Rochdale grammar school, then run by the Revd John Shaw, and he remained there until November 1774. After a brief period of private tuition with the Revd William Sheepshanks of Grassington in the West Riding, he was in October 1775 admitted to St John's College, Cambridge. In November 1781 he took the degree of LLB and seemed destined for a legal career, but the untimely death of his father in June 1782 put paid to that ambition, although in 1801 he received his LLD. On 13 January 1783 at Leeds parish church he married Lucy Thursby (1759&#150;1837), daughter of Thomas Thursby, a relative of the Yorkshire antiquary Ralph Thoresby, both descendants of Ralph's great-grandfather. Whitaker and his wife had six children. He returned to Cliviger and assumed the mantle of a country squire. His passion for the ancestral property and the neighbouring countryside was a driving force for the rest of his life. He determined to enter the church, but with no ambition beyond that of ruling in the locality. Although ordained in 1785 he sought no living, but in the same year paid &pound;400 to obtain the right of presentation to the chapel at Cliviger. In 1788 he had the old chapel demolished and, at a cost to himself of &pound;870, a new one was built and consecrated in 1794.<br>
<br>The first part of Whitaker's strategy was concluded in 1797, when, as patron of the living, he licensed himself to the perpetual curacy of Holme in Cliviger on the death of the curate, William Halliwell. It is clear, however, that for some years he had been, <i>de facto</i>, in control of the chapel and all its affairs. In 1809 he fulfilled his next great ambition, when he became vicar of the great parish of Whalley, which covered much of east Lancashire and was the second largest (and one of the most populous) in England. In November 1818 his already very considerable local position and status were greatly augmented when he became, in plurality, vicar of Blackburn. In the interim, from 1813 to 1819, he had also been rector of Heysham, near Lancaster.<br>
<br>All this might imply that Whitaker was interested merely in aggrandizement, financial and social, but that was not the case. He was an assiduous and meticulous pastor, and proudly claimed that he preached at least once a year in each of the churches and chapels of his great personal empire. In 1799 he was appointed a county magistrate for Lancashire and in 1800 for the West Riding, and from 1815 to 1821 presided over the Cliviger select vestry. His great personal authority was employed in 1820, when, as vicar and the leading local magistrate, he drove into Burnley during a bloody strike by local miners and, rather than order the military out (with the likelihood of further bloodshed) addressed the strikers and persuaded them to return home. He was known as a severe and demanding man, possessed of abundant energies and intolerant of the failings or weaknesses of others, reactionary in his views of class and social status, perhaps respected rather than loved. His attention to detail, and to intellectual curiosity, is exemplified by the registers of Holme in Cliviger, which he wrote in person from 1791 until 1815. The pre-1812 register contains remarkable detail, of great interest to social and economic historians, giving the age, residence, occupation, and cause of death of almost all those buried, and the occupation of the father in all baptism entries. For 1795 and 1805&#150;12 it also includes tabular statistical analyses of age at death. His love of the Lancashire and Yorkshire Pennines is emphasized by his landscape &#145;improvements&#146; in the Cliviger area. He undertook large-scale schemes for planting and beautifying the wild moorland and impressive gorge, according to the most fashionable taste&#151;he planted about half a million trees between 1785 and 1815, and his work is still the prevailing influence upon the scenery in the valley.<br>
<br>For posterity these many legacies are eclipsed by the results of Whitaker's other great love&#151;topography and antiquarian studies. In the early 1790s, influenced by his friend and patron Charles Towneley of Towneley Hall, 2 miles from Holme, he began work on a monumental history of the parish of Whalley, a project which fuelled his growing ambition to become vicar of that parish and which was researched extensively from original sources. The history was published, as a subscription work, in 1801 and was an immediate success: a second edition appeared in 1806 and a third in 1818. Whitaker's <span class="italic">Whalley</span> is among the most important and valuable topographical-cum-antiquarian histories of the early nineteenth century, and its interest is greatly enhanced by the author's employment of the young J. M. W. Turner to illustrate the book. Turner was introduced to Whitaker through their mutual friend Charles Towneley, and he visited the Whalley area to paint a number of watercolours from which the published engravings were made. The success of <span class="italic">Whalley</span> encouraged Whitaker to extend his geographical scope. In 1805 he published his <span class="italic">History of Craven</span>, which went into a second edition in 1812; in 1816 came <span class="italic">Loidis and Elmete</span>, a history of the area around Leeds, including lower Wharfedale and Airedale; and in 1823, posthumously, <span class="italic">The History of Richmondshire</span>, the first and only part of a projected history of Yorkshire. The last two were also illustrated by Turner, their value today being associated more with the artist than the author. Whitaker also published a number of other minor works, including twenty-eight articles in the <span class="italic">Quarterly Review</span>, but it is the topographical histories which remain his monument.<br>
<br>Whitaker died at the vicarage in Blackburn on 18 December 1821 and was buried at Holme in Cliviger chapel on 24 December in a coffin made from one of the larch trees which he had planted on the estate thirty-five years before. One of his sons, Robert Nowell Whitaker, succeeded him as perpetual curate of Holme in Cliviger in 1830.<br>
