<span class="headword">D'Eichthal,  Gustave</span>  (1804&#150;1886), <span class="occ">visionary and social observer</span>, was born in Nancy, the son of Louis D'Eichthal (1780&#150;1840), a Jewish banker, and his wife, Fleurette, <i>n&eacute;e</i> L&eacute;vy (<i>d</i>. 1837). Raised as a Catholic from 1817, when he was baptized at De&uuml;il, near Versailles, he was educated in Paris, first at a Catholic boarding-school and then at the Lyc&eacute;e Henri IV. Late in 1822 he became the young Auguste Comte's first disciple, and was responsible for introducing Comte's work to Hegel and other German philosophers in 1824. During the next few years, while working in commerce, he began to drift away from Comte and was drawn instead to the Saint-Simonians; he was fully converted in 1829, and for the next three years was a leading member and benefactor of the Saint-Simonian sect. Comte regarded this as a betrayal.<br>
<br>D'Eichthal made an extended visit to Britain in 1828, and recorded his observations in the form of extensive notes, which were first published by his son some three-quarters of a century later. These notes have been unduly neglected, perhaps, by historians of nineteenth-century Britain. D'Eichthal stayed for eight months, mostly in London, but he also made a two-month trip to the industrial north and to Scotland. The title under which his notes were published in 1902 implied that he was primarily interested in working-class life, but that bias is not apparent in the full text of his notes; neither is there much justification for the assertion that he was shocked by what he saw of working-class living standards in industrial Britain. He recorded his observations in a matter-of-fact tone. D'Eichthal's main interest, then and for the rest of his life, was religion, and his notes are peppered with observations on religious practice. He was not greatly impressed by &#145;the apparent respect the English show for religious matters&#146;, which he thought a matter of habit rather than conviction  (Ratcliffe and Chaloner, 31).<br>
<br>It is sometimes said that D'Eichthal was interested in Britain because, as a Saint-Simonian, he regarded the birthplace of the industrial revolution as being in the vanguard of history. This interpretation is open to dispute. He saw Britain in 1828 as an <i>ancien r&eacute;gime</i> in its last years. &#145;Privilege and monopoly&#146;, he thought, &#145;are the basis of the entire constitution&#146;, and he was thinking not just of the privileges of the aristocracy and the gentry, of the clergy and the municipalities, rather, &#145;the keystone of this whole edifice of privilege, which in my opinion has made its survival possible for so long, is the privilege enjoyed by the poor who <i>have a right</i> to relief from the rich, according to the level of their wages and the number of children in their families&#146;  (Ratcliffe and Chaloner, 40&#150;41). He drew an explicit comparison between the situation in England in 1828 and the state of France on the eve of the revolution of 1789. D'Eichthal did not think of England as the epitome of modernity in all respects; he did see it as a society ripe for conversion to Saint-Simonism, and that belief was to account for his next visit in 1832.<br>
<br>Conversations with bankers and economists in England influenced the monograph on government finance which D'Eichthal completed on his return to France in 1829. Influenced by the work of the House of Commons finance committee, he argued for the desirability of government loans and stressed the absurdity of a sinking fund. He was also impressed by the savings bank movement, and proposed the creation of similar institutions in France as a means of improving the working-class standard of living.<br>
<br>During the visit to Britain D'Eichthal had met J. S. Mill, who became perhaps his closest English friend. He introduced Mill to Comte's work, and Mill and D'Eichthal began a lengthy correspondence. Another of his notable English contacts was Francis Place, with whom he had lengthy conversations about the machinery question. On his return to France D'Eichthal had planned to write a book on Britain, and he wrote to Place and Mill about it. The project never came to fruition. It was during this period that he also began to correspond with Thomas Carlyle, who had come to his attention as the author of &#145;Signs of the times&#146; in the <span class="italic">Edinburgh Review</span>. He viewed Carlyle as a likely convert: somewhat optimistically, since Carlyle, though sympathetic to Saint-Simonian social and historical philosophy, was unable to see it as a religion.<br>
<br>D'Eichthal visited England again in January 1832, when with Duveyrier he undertook a Saint-Simonian &#145;mission&#146;. On the eve of the visit he wrote that Britain&#151;in the midst of reform agitation&#151;was ripe for conversion: the last bastions of feudalism were on the point of collapse, and circumstances were propitious for the new Saint-Simonian doctrine to take hold. In the event the apostles were spectacularly unsuccessful in winning converts, though they attracted press attention and reinforced the celebrity, or notoriety, of the Saint-Simonian sect. Carlyle, who finally met his correspondent, thought the two missionaries &#145;the greatest Babblers I have ever heard&#146;  (<span class="italic">Collected Letters</span>, 6.127). The sect was denounced in <span class="italic">The Times</span>, and in organs as different as the <span class="italic">Quarterly Review</span> and the <span class="italic">Westminster Review</span>. In the same year the new religion collapsed as several of its leaders were successfully prosecuted in Paris. D'Eichthal was one of the last of the leaders to abandon the sect, in November 1832, and the Saint-Simonian conception of history exercised a lifelong influence on his thinking.<br>
<br>Thereafter, D'Eichthal's active interest in Britain subsided, although he continued to correspond with Mill. D'Eichthal also pinned his hopes on Greece for a while, and in 1834&#150;5 served in the new state's political economy office, which had been set up at his suggestion to look into the land question. He was an enthusiast for the promotion of Greek as an international language, and thought that its adoption as the official language could be a solution to the nationality question in the Habsburg monarchy. But his chief interest was religion: he published a number of penetrating works of biblical criticism, both on the gospels and on the <span class="roman">Pentateuch</span>. He also devoted himself to promoting the unity of the human race through a new synthesis of the three great &#145;Mediterranean&#146; religions. This project was not successful. He married a Jewess, F&eacute;licit&eacute; Rodrigues-Henriques, who came from a Sephardic family of stockbrokers who had converted to Catholicism. Their eldest son, Eug&egrave;ne, became director of the &Eacute;cole Libre des Sciences Politiques in Paris. D'Eichthal died in Paris on 9 April 1886.<br>
