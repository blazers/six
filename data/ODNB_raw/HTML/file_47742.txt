<span class="headword">Amrit Kaur</span> <span class="st"> [Rajkumari Amrit Kaur]</span>  (1889&#150;1964), <span class="occ">politician and advocate of women's rights</span>, was born on 2 February 1889 at Kapurthala Palace, Lucknow. She was the only daughter among the six children of Sir Harnam Singh (1851&#150;1930), youngest son of Sir Raja Randher Singh Bahadur GCSI of Kapurthala, a small princely kingdom in the Punjab, and Rani Harnam Singh, daughter of Gokal Nath, a Bengali Christian. The original surname of the family was Ahluwalia, which is a surname of families of Rajput descent (princely families dropped the use of surnames). As a result of his conversion to Christianity, Harnam Singh lost the right of succession to the Kapurthala throne, but he and his sons occupied important positions in the British administration. Amrit Kaur grew up amid the lavish splendour of a royal household. She was sent to England for her education and studied at the Sherborne School for Girls in Dorset. She was not a particularly bright student and her interests were in sports and games. She was captain of the school hockey and cricket teams and won many tennis tournaments. After leaving Sherborne, she spent some time in a school in London and later at Oxford University, but did not sit for any examination.<br>
<br>On her return to India Amrit Kaur lived with her parents in Jullundur and never married. While her family had close connections with the raj, and was influenced by English culture, at the same time it had its roots in Indian traditions. Her father, though Anglicized and loyal to the British, maintained close contacts with several nationalist leaders, among them Gopal Krishna Gokhale, who frequently visited their home. It was from Gokhale that Amrit Kaur first heard of Gandhi and was inspired to devote herself to the service of the country. Gandhi's first public speech in India delivered after his return from South Africa in 1915 deeply moved her. She came to know him personally when he came to their home in Jullundur in 1919 to recuperate from injuries suffered during the Punjab disturbances following the Jallianwalla Bagh tragedy. She felt a growing urge to join Gandhi's Sabarmati ashram but bowed to family pressure to stay at home. She joined Gandhi's Sevagram ashram in 1936, at the age of forty-seven, after the death of both her parents, and worked as his secretary. She gave up all her finery and started wearing <i>khadi</i>. Her relationship with Gandhi was close and humane, but she retained a sharp independence of mind. She continued to spend part of the year in her palatial family house, Manorville, in Simla. She served on the board of trustees of the All-India Spinners' Association and of the Hindustani Talim Sangh, two Gandhian institutions, during Gandhi's lifetime.<br>
<br>Amrit Kaur was deeply committed to improving the status of women in India, opposing purdah, polygamy, and child marriage and wanting to promote women's education. She was a founder member of the All-India Women's Conference (AIWC; 1927) and its president in 1937. She was also a founder member of the All-India Women's Education Fund Association and was responsible for starting Lady Irwin College in New Delhi. On behalf of the AIWC she appeared before Lord Lothian's franchise committee in 1932 and the joint select committee of the British parliament in 1933, and voiced her disapproval of separate electorates for women as well as of communal electorates. Together with the AIWC she took a firm stand against the British communal award (1932).<br>
<br>At the time of the third round-table conference, Rajkumari Amrit Kaur, together with Dr Muthulakshmi Reddy and Begum Hamida Ali went to London to put the demands of Indian women regarding franchise before the joint select committee of parliament. The three Indian women established contacts with various British women's groups who were sympathetic to the demands of Indian women. Before leaving for India, Rajkumari suggested that a liaison group be formed so that a lasting link between British and Indian women could be maintained. As a result the Liaison Group of Women's Societies was formed in 1922 comprising five societies&#151;the British Commonwealth League, Six Points Group, Women's Freedom League, Women's International League, and St John's Social and Political Alliance. On the Indian side was the AIWC, which appointed Rajkumari Amrit Kaur as the liaison officer. The British groups asked Mrs Grace Lankester to act as their liaison officer. The Liaison Group continued to function until 1951. She was on the subcommittee of the AIWC which formulated an Indian women's charter of rights in 1946. She was also a member of the constituent assembly subcommittee on minorities, and objected to the guarantee of freedom of religious propaganda and practice, reacting obviously to the Muslim League propaganda for Pakistan in 1946&#150;7, and wanted freedom of religion to be limited to religious worship only. She championed the cause of a uniform civil code relating to marriage, inheritance, divorce, and guardianship. She was a member of the advisory board on education of the government of India under the chairmanship of Sir John Sargent, and a deputy leader of the Indian delegation to UNESCO in London (1945) and Paris (1946).<br>
<br>Amrit Kaur's political work also involved her in opposition to the British. She went to Bannu in the North-West Frontier Province to advocate the cause of the Indian National Congress, and was arrested and convicted on 16 July 1937 by the assistant commissioner on a charge of sedition. She was sentenced to imprisonment until the rising of the court and fined 50 rupees. She was active during the Quit India movement in 1942 and processions led by her were subjected to lathi (baton) charges. She was arrested in Kalka and lodged in Ambala gaol, but owing to ill health she was transferred to Simla and put under house arrest.<br>
<br>After independence Amrit Kaur became India's first health minister and remained so until 1957, after which she was a member of the Rajya Sabha (upper house). As health minister she was responsible for starting the prestigious All-India Institute of Medical Sciences in New Delhi, whose outpatients' department is named after her. She laboured hard to raise money from New Zealand, Australia, West Germany, Sweden, the Rockefeller Foundation, and others for various wings and activities of the institute. She and her brother Shamsher Singh donated their family home, Manorville, as a holiday home for the staff and nurses of the hospital.<br>
<br>Amrit Kaur chaired the Indian Red Cross Society for fourteen years and was elected president of the International Red Cross conference in New Delhi in 1957. As health minister she led the Indian delegation to the World Health Assembly in 1948, 1949, 1951, and 1953, and played a role in the establishment of the first regional office of the World Health Organization in south-east Asia and in 1948 was its chair. She was the first woman and the first Asian to be elected president of the World Health Assembly (third assembly, 1950). She was also an honorary fellow of the American Public Health Association. She took a keen interest in the training of nurses and helped in the development of the College of Nursing and was vice-patron of the Nurses' Training Association. Her love of sports manifested itself in her starting the National Sports Club of India, of which she was president from 1948 to 1959. She was vice-president of the All-India Council of Sports for several years, and chairman of the board of governors of the National Institute of Sports. The sports coaching scheme named after her was her idea. She was president of the All-India Lawn Tennis Association (1954&#150;9) and of the Table Tennis Federation of India (1955&#150;61).<br>
<br>Amrit Kaur was closely associated with YWCA in Delhi and at the All-India level. Though a Christian, she was not a regular churchgoer. To her the essence of Christianity was selfless service. She received the Rene Sand memorial award from the International Conference of Social Work, Rome; the Count Bernadotte gold medals of the League of Red Cross Societies of various European countries; and was a dame grand cross of the order of St John of Jerusalem. Rajkumari Amrit Kaur died on 6 February 1964 at her residence at 2 Willingdon Crescent, New Delhi. She was cremated according to old Hindu family tradition. The archbishop of Delhi held a service at her residence and another at Nigambodh Ghat on the banks of the Jumna River in Delhi, where the funeral pyre was lit by her brother Kanwar Singh.<br>
