<span class="headword">Martin,  Sarah</span>  (1791&#150;1843), <span class="occ">prison visitor</span>, was born in June 1791 at Caister on the Norfolk coast. She was an only child and her father, a local tradesman, and her mother both died in her infancy. She was brought up by her widowed grandmother, a glove maker, and attended Caister village school. From the age of twelve Sarah Martin read well-known classics obtained from a local library; from the age of fourteen she walked to work at Great Yarmouth, 3 miles away, as a dressmaker, an occupation which maintained her for most of her life. At the age of nineteen she heard a sermon at a Church of England meeting-house in Yarmouth and, though previously having a deep distrust of religion, she became a dedicated convert, and by 1811 had learned much of the <span class="roman">Bible</span> by heart. In 1826 her grandmother died, leaving her about &pound;250, which produced an income of &pound;10&#150;12 per year. Sarah Martin left Caister to live with a poor widow in Great Yarmouth. From 1811 she had been teaching in the local Sunday school and reading the <span class="roman">Bible</span> in the local poor-house infirmary.<br>
<br>Great Yarmouth borough gaol and house of correction was severely criticized by James Neild in his 1812 survey of English prisons. The prison, which consisted of seven underground dungeons and a day-room, was filthy, disease-ridden, and infested with vermin. The poorly fed prisoners were unsupervised and allowed to tyrannize over each other; the prison lacked heating and medical care, and the regime indulged those with funds in gambling, drunkenness, and vice, eschewing any of the protective or rehabilitative programmes which, following the work of John Howard in the late eighteenth century, had become received wisdom in prison government.<br>
<br>From 1810 Sarah Martin had reflected on the prison which she passed daily on her way to work. In August 1819, however, she heard that a woman had been committed there for cruelty to her child and she visited her. The meeting was painful, for the woman was very distressed at injuring her own child, but Martin persevered in her visits and began to meet the male prisoners also. They were at first contemptuous towards her, but her regular visits became accepted by staff and prisoners as well as by the borough councillors of Great Yarmouth who, embarrassed by James Neild's revelations, were initially most reluctant to allow her access. She was to continue work at the prison until her death a quarter of a century later.<br>
<br>Sarah Martin's methods involved a combination of biblical instruction, personal friendship, and practical aid. She was a persistent visitor of individual prisoners, with whom she would talk about their own human needs, the evil of crime, and the consolations of religion, building up many deep and abiding relationships. She would make contact with prisoners' families outside, either by visits or correspondence, to prepare for release, and she would fund prisoners, from her own income or later charitable donations, who had no food or resources to get them home. This was at times problematic: as Great Yarmouth was a seaport, families would arrive from far away searching for their menfolk, or released prisoners who were sailors would need a great deal of help to get a vessel to take them home. Sarah Martin aimed to appeal to the heart of the prisoner and was frank in her expectation that promises to desist from criminality would be kept after release, on occasion making simple contracts with prisoners to that effect. On every Sunday she held at least one collective religious service in the prison at which <span class="roman">Bible</span> reading and a sermon were a major element. In addition she taught selected prisoners to read and write using children's books and religious literature which she obtained from the Society For Promoting Christian Knowledge. In particular she taught them to memorize scripture as she had memorized it as a young woman. She also taught women prisoners her own needlework skills and provided useful work, such as bookbinding or making of bone spoons, for the men: the articles thus made were sold and the profit given to each prisoner on discharge. Martin would also find work for prisoners on release. Finally she would visit or correspond with former prisoners. Central to all her methods was constant reference to the Christian faith.<br>
<br>In 1824 the council extended the prison adding improved accommodation above ground. Sarah increased her attendance until, by the late 1830s, she was at the prison every day. Up to 1838 Sarah depended on her own trade and local donations to resource this work; she refused all offers of finance from the borough until 1841, when &pound;12 a year was granted her. She also received funds from Elizabeth Fry's British Ladies' Society. By now her work was becoming well known, as the inspector of prisons appointed under the 1835 <span class="roman">Prison Act</span> for the north and east, Captain William John Williams, had viewed her activities with astonishment and recorded her progress in detail: these reports were published as part of the annual reports of the prison inspectors. By this time she was receiving assistance from the Hon. Revd Pellew, chaplain to the borough; just after her death a prison chaplain and schoolmaster were appointed.<br>
<br>Sarah Martin's theology&#151;inseparable from her mission&#151;emphasized three tenets. Firstly she insisted that there was an inseparable connection between sin and sorrow, arguing that vice and crime, however alluring, invariably led to sorrow and pain. Secondly she insisted on a similar indissoluble connection between goodness and happiness. Thirdly she urged with great passion that by the sacrifice of Christ on the cross atonement and redemption were available to all and that by faith in Christ even those most sunk in sin could find peace and salvation. All were lost to the temptation of sin, she argued, unless they turned to Christ to be reborn spiritually and thus delivered from the wrath of God. She believed most strongly that where love and charitable bonds failed, the malice and corruption of Satan instantly entered in.<br>
<br>Sarah Martin provided an unyielding and dedicated model of the prison missionary, persisting in visiting those who rebuffed her or fell back on old ways. She believed that even the most hardened would soften when shown love and compassion in the context of Christian consolation, and was especially attentive to the women and children in prison. Her innermost beliefs were revealed in her religious poetry, which emphasized the all-protecting offer of life eternal to the faithful and the demonic snares of Satan awaiting all who reject their Saviour. A persistent theme in her poetry is the suffering of sin and the importance of the missionary rescuer.<br>
<br>Towards the end of her life Sarah Martin also superintended a school for pauper children and set up classes for factory women on two nights a week in St Nicholas' Church, Great Yarmouth. She became ill in the winter of 1842, although she continued to visit the prison until April 1843. Thereafter she suffered intense agony and did not leave her sickbed, consoling herself writing appropriate poetry. This, with other verse, was published after her death as <span class="italic">Selections from the Poetical Remains of Miss S. Martin</span> (1845). She died on 15 October 1843 at Great Yarmouth and was buried at Caister by the side of her grandmother.<br>
<br>Sarah Martin is difficult to classify. She was plainly closely in tune with the Quaker and Anglican evangelical approach to the reform and the consolation of prisoners represented by Elizabeth Fry and the London-based Prison Discipline Society, and yet she was far from the wealthy banking network of Mrs Fry's family and friends. She began her work at about the same time as Elizabeth Fry and cannot be regarded as a mere imitator. She did not move on any national stage, for she was intensely bound to Caister and Great Yarmouth and never ventured more than a few miles from them. Of humble birth, she left no mission or movement. She was remembered, however, for the depth of her faith and for the genuine unostentatious love she held for prisoners and other neglected groups. A woman of great feeling, she appears to have had a remarkable capacity for entering into the sufferings of others. Practical and energetic, she wanted prisoners to be busy learning new skills and active rather than slothful and despairing.<br>
