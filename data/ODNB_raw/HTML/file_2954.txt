<span class="headword">Boswell, Sir  William</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1650), <span class="occ">diplomat and patron of learning</span>, was born in Suffolk. He matriculated from Jesus College, Cambridge, in 1600, graduating BA in 1604, becoming a fellow in 1606, and proceeding MA in 1607; he was incorporated at Oxford in 1608. In December 1614 he was granted a pass to travel abroad for three years but he remained absent from England for a total of eight despite remaining a fellow of Jesus until 1629. From at least April 1619 to July 1621 Boswell served as chief secretary to the English ambassador in Paris, Edward Herbert, Lord Herbert of Cherbury; Boswell and the poet George Herbert were dedicatees of Herbert's <span class="italic">De veritate</span> in December 1622.<br>
<br>Following his return to England Boswell became secretary to the new lord keeper, John Williams, bishop of Lincoln, dealing especially with episcopal revenues. On 11 November 1622 he was appointed clerk to the privy council in extraordinary, specializing in military and naval matters. He also served as MP for Boston, Lincolnshire, in 1624 and 1625, and acted as senior proctor for the University of Cambridge in 1624&#150;5, during which time he liaised with Sir Dudley Carleton in an attempt to persuade the Dutch humanist Gerardus Joannes Vossius to take up a lectureship in history and political science at Cambridge. As secretary, he accompanied James Hay, earl of Carlisle, on two diplomatic missions: to France in 1624, and to Savoy (via Switzerland, Flanders, the Low Countries, and France) from May 1628 to February 1629. Soon after returning he married his cousin Margaret Boswell or Bosvile, a relation of Sir Ralph Bosvile of Eynsford in Kent, described as already &#145;well advanced in years&#146;  (Davies, 25), although probably aged thirty-four; the marriage appears to have been childless. During 1630 Boswell was absorbed by the appeal of his brother Thomas to be made proctor of Cambridge University. On 21 January 1631 Boswell, Inigo Jones, and Patrick Young were charged with the ordering of the king's ancient coins and medals, while on 12 April 1632, with Peter de Liques, he was created receiver-general of revenues from America. His services were also in demand by the privy council as &#145;a kind of literary intelligence officer&#146;  (Rees, lxxiv), employed in the verification of documents, and in seizing and examining the libraries of Sir Robert Cotton, Captain Henry Bell, Denzil Holles, Sir John Eliot, and John Selden.<br>
<br>Boswell's most important appointment came in July 1632, when he succeeded Sir Dudley Carleton as England's resident agent in the United Provinces at The Hague, arriving in September 1632 and remaining until 1650 (excepting visits to England in 1634 and 1640). On 25 July 1633 he was knighted by Lord Vere at Bokstel, in Brabant. Intimately involved in the household of Elizabeth of Bohemia, he was recalled to England to discuss the case of Elizabeth's servant Francis Nethersole in 1634, and in early 1635 travelled to Germany to invest the elector palatine Charles Louis with the Order of the Garter. Boswell was instrumental in the publication of a tract describing a Jesuit plot to incite Scotland to rebel and overthrow Charles I, which was brought to his attention by Andreas ab Habernfeld; Boswell communicated it to Archbishop Laud, and received royal praise for his actions. He was also active in local religious controversy, although he collaborated with Vossius, professor of history at the new Athenaeum Illustre in Amsterdam. After civil war broke out in England Walter Strickland was dispatched by Cromwell to ensure the Netherlands' support for the parliamentary party; Boswell, an ardent royalist, used his influence to secure the country's neutrality; he also attempted to raise funds by pawning the queen's jewels, and to induce Dutch supporters to land an army in England.<br>
<br>A respected diplomat, Boswell was also noted as a patron of learning, bibliophile and manuscript collector, and the hub of an impressive continental network of lettered men. He attributed &#145;all his proficiency in learning, whatever it be, to the goodness&#146; of John Dee's preface to Euclid,  (Worthington, <span class="italic">Diary</span>, 59&#150;60): and was remembered as &#145;an excellent philosopher and mathematician&#146;  (Worthington, preface), but his interests ranged more widely: from Anglo-Saxon and oriental literatures to the latest scientific experiments. One of the early followers of Galileo in England, Boswell counted among his intellectual contacts William Camden, James Ussher, Henry and John Spelman, John Selden, Thomas Lydiat, Theodore Haak, John Pell, Lodewijck Huygens, Robert Cotton, G. P. Vossius, Fabri de Peiresc, Joseph Mede, Pierre Dupuy, Henry Wotton, Samuel Hartlib, John de Laet, Meric Casaubon, and Simonds D'Ewes; only a tiny proportion of his correspondence survives in two volumes in the British Library (Add. MSS 6394, 6395). Boswell was renowned for his manuscript collection, which contained prized and as yet unpublished works by John Dee, William Gilbert, and Francis Bacon, who had appointed him his literary executor; some of these passed after his death to Isaac Gruter, who published them with the Elsevier press in Amsterdam.<br>
<br>By the time of Charles I's execution Boswell was ill; he died at The Hague in May 1650; much of his library apparently disappeared. His widow, Margaret, died in 1682 at the age of eighty-seven, leaving two Sir William Boswell scholarships to Sevenoaks School boys to attend her late husband's college in Cambridge. In Dr John Worthington's words, Boswell was &#145;a learned man, a great encourager of learning, zealous for the Church of England, faithful in the execution of his embassy, and highly valued by eminent persons&#146;  (Worthington, <span class="italic">Diary</span>, 59&#150;60).<br>
