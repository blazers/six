<span class="headword">Alexander,  David Lindo</span>  (1842&#150;1922), <span class="occ">lawyer and Jewish community leader</span>, was born at 6 South Street, London, on 5 October 1842, second son in the large family of solicitor Joshua Alexander and his wife, Jemima (<i>b</i>. 1819), one of eighteen children of David Abarbanel Lindo (1772&#150;1852) and Sarah Mocatta (1777&#150;1852). He was educated at the City of London School and Trinity College, Cambridge, from where he graduated in mathematics among the wranglers in 1864. He was one of the first Jews to benefit from legislation passed in 1856 which abolished the Anglican religious test at Cambridge that had prevented Jews from matriculating. His obvious aptitude for mathematics notwithstanding (he had won prizes for this subject throughout his scholastic career), Alexander was elected by his college to a three-year studentship in law. He was destined to follow in the professional footsteps of his father and, like him, to enter Jewish communal life.<br>
<br>Alexander was called to the bar at Lincoln's Inn in 1866, took silk in 1892, was elected a bencher of his inn in 1895, and retired from legal practice around 1907. His family were well connected to the &eacute;lite &#145;cousinhood&#146; of Anglo-Jewry, a fortunate advantage for a specialist in conveyancing law. In his youth the family were resident in South Street, Finsbury, and later moved to Wimpole Street in the heart of the West End. Two of his sisters married into the wealthy Beddington clan. Alexander never moved outside the smarter parts of London.<br>
<br>In 1886 the eligible bachelor married Hester (1845&#150;1913), daughter of Simeon Joseph, a member of the London stock exchange. The couple, who lived at York Gate, Regent's Park, had three children, two sons and a daughter. The promising younger son, George Simeon, died young after being called to the bar at Lincoln's Inn. Hester herself became &#145;a confirmed invalid&#146; soon after their marriage, and her husband cared for her with great devotion until her death on 29 May 1913.<br>
<br>Alexander was the product of an Ashkenazi&#150;Sephardi union. On the maternal side he was a direct descendant of Isaac Lindo (<i>d</i>. 1712), one of the earliest &#145;Jew brokers&#146; on the London stock exchange. His maternal grandfather, David Abarbanel Lindo (an uncle of Benjamin Disraeli), was prominent in the affairs of the Bevis Marks Spanish and Portuguese Synagogue, the oldest congregation in Britain, and was a staunch opponent of Jewish religious reform. Alexander's parents were apparently traditional in outlook. While he was at Cambridge his father arranged for him to dine with a local Jewish family rather than in hall, thus enabling Alexander to observe the Jewish dietary laws. His parents were members of the Ashkenazi Central Synagogue in Great Portland Street, London, and he started his own forty-year communal career in 1877 as one of its representatives on the Board of Deputies of British Jews. He was also associated with the New West End Synagogue in Bayswater. Both of these synagogues were prestigious &#145;cathedrals&#146; of the establishment United Synagogue. Among other communal posts, Alexander served as vice-president of the Anglo-Jewish Association, on the council of Jews' College, and, most importantly, as president of the Board of Deputies between 1903 and 1917. His youngest brother, Lionel, was a president of the Jewish Board of Guardians, the premier welfare agency within the Jewish community.<br>
<br>As board president, Alexander was closely identified with the native Anglo-Jewish &#145;establishment&#146; at a time when its hegemony was being increasingly challenged by the mass immigration of Jewish refugees from eastern Europe. Yiddish-speaking foreign-born Jews, crowded into the slums of the East End and equivalent metropolitan districts, had little in common with their English-speaking acculturated co-religionists, whose &eacute;lite Alexander typified.<br>
<br>Almost from the beginning Alexander's presidency was criticized for being out of touch. On foreign policy matters dear to the heart of the immigrants, Alexander protested with reticence against atrocities in Russia at the time of the Kishinyov pogrom (1903) and he half-heartedly welcomed the liberal February revolution in 1917. Nearer home Alexander was attacked for the evidence he gave before the royal commission on divorce (1910). Rather than uphold freedom of religious conscience, he preferred to denounce &#145;foreign rabbis&#146; in Britain who granted religious divorces (<i>gittin</i>) to couples still married according to civil law. He consistently adopted what the <span class="italic">Jewish Chronicle</span> dismissed as a &#145;no khaki, no soup&#146; policy towards immigrant Russian Jews who refused to serve in the British army during the First World War.<br>
<br>Alexander is best remembered as co-signatory of a letter to <span class="italic">The Times</span> on 24 May 1917, framed by the leading Anglo-Jewish ideologue of Liberal Judaism and anti-Zionism, Claude G. Montefiore, president of the Anglo-Jewish Association. The letter stated that &#145;Emancipated Jews in this country regard themselves primarily as a religious community&#146; with &#145;no separate aspirations in a political sense&#146;. They were not &#145;a homeless nationality&#146; that aimed to set up its own territorial centre. Indeed, such an aspiration would only undermine the struggle for equal rights everywhere and would brand all Jews &#145;as strangers in their native lands&#146;. This manifesto was intended as a riposte to the Zionists who, led by the Russian-born Chaim Weizmann, were then conducting negotiations with the British government which resulted in the Balfour declaration on Palestine of 2 November 1917. The letter provoked a &#145;communal revolution&#146; in Anglo-Jewry. The issue at stake was less the well-known anti-Zionism of the communal grandees than the manner in which their broadside had been delivered, without reference to ordinary members of the board. Alexander's presidency was denounced as secretive and autocratic. On 17 June the letter was condemned in a vote of censure by fifty-six votes to fifty-one, and Alexander was forced to resign. His departure did not mean that Zionist ascendancy of the board had been achieved. It did mean that the time for constitutional reform was at hand. The representative base of the Board of Deputies was broadened in 1919.<br>
<br>Although he joined the anti-Zionist League of British Jews formed in the aftermath of the declaration, Alexander's resignation in 1917 effectively marked the end of his political career. He died on 29 April 1922, aged seventy-nine, at his home, 50 Harrington Gardens, South Kensington, London, and was buried next to his wife at Willesden Jewish cemetery on 2 May.<br>
