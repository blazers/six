<span class="headword">Lindley, Sir  William Heerlein</span>  (1853&#150;1917), <span class="occ">civil engineer</span>, was born on 30 January 1853 at 50 Ferdinand Strasse, Hamburg, Germany, the eldest son in a family of four children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16676/', "William Lindley (1808&#150;1900)")</script>, an English civil engineer, and his wife, Jeanne Julie (1828&#150;1862), daughter of Martin Edward Heerlein, a Hamburg merchant. He was educated in London at private schools in Greenwich and Blackheath and matriculated at London University in 1869.<br>
<br>In 1870 Lindley began his practical training as a pupil of his father, who was working on the construction of new waterworks at Budapest. During his father's absence he was left in charge of the work. In 1873 he became his father's assistant at Frankfurt am Main in Germany, and from 1874 to 1879 he acted as his father's representative and as resident engineer there. His father retired in 1879 and Lindley became chief engineer of the sewerage works in the city. On 24 March of that year he married Fanny Henriette Getz (1858&#150;1923), the daughter of a well-established physician in Frankfurt; their three children, two daughters and a son, were all born in the city. In 1882 the direction of Frankfurt's water supply was also entrusted to Lindley and later in the same year his appointment as the city's chief engineer meant that all its engineering works came under his direction.<br>
<br>During twenty-two years in this post Lindley carried out numerous works: these included construction work on the harbour, new quay walls along the river and embankments with storehouses, and also the conversion of the old stone Main&#150;Neckar railway bridge into a road bridge (the Wilhelmsbr&uuml;cke). In the course of the latter project he developed a system of boring numerous small tube wells down into fine sand in a long row and coupling them to a suction pipe, and this was subsequently widely copied. Lastly, in 1889, he designed a new electrical supply works. In 1891 he served as a member of the commission of experts, and also as president of the jury at the great Frankfurt Electro-Technical Exhibition.<br>
<br>At the end of 1879 Lindley had also taken over his father's civil engineering practice outside Frankfurt and abroad, extending to at least forty-eight cities. In this capacity he was responsible for the design of waterworks for Moscow, Tiflis, Trieste, Jassy, Bucharest, Craiova, Ploesti, Pitesti, and Warsaw, but only the last four were actually built. He was also consulted as to the water supply of Vienna, Amsterdam, Dorpat, Kovno (Kaunas), &#321;&oacute;d&#378;, and St Petersburg. Designs for drainage systems were also prepared and executed in Prague, W&uuml;rzburg, Mannheim, T&ouml;lz, Hanau, Homburg, Elberfeld, Samara, Ploesti, and W&#322;oc&#322;awek.<br>
<br>Lindley was a prominent figure in the engineering profession. President of the German commission on electric stray currents and of the standardization committee of the German Gas and Water Engineers, he also represented Germany in the international pipe-threads standardization committee. Other bodies on which he served included the commission for the regulation of the Danube and the German commission of the government board of health. Appreciation of the value of his work was shown by the presentation to him of diplomas at technological exhibitions in Turin (1890), Dijon (1893), Chicago (1893), and Lw&oacute;w (Lemberg) (1894). In 1893 he was made a knight of the iron crown of Austria, and in 1894 the order of the Corona d'Italia was conferred on him. His professional expertise was also recognized in Britain. He served on the royal commission on canals and waterways in 1906, and was honoured with a knighthood in 1911.<br>
<br>Lindley became a member of thirty-two prestigious organizations, including the Institution of Civil Engineers (1878), the French Society of Sanitary Engineers (1897), and the Society of German Gas and Water Engineers. In 1914 the University of Darmstadt presented him with the honorary degree of doctor of engineering. Lindley's last great undertaking was the construction of a water supply system in the city of Baku in the Caucasus. These works were completed in February 1917, just before the outbreak of the Russian revolution, and led to his being presented with the freedom of Baku. In July 1917 he returned to London. He died at his home, 74 Hazlewell Road, Putney, on 30 December 1917. He was buried at Putney Vale cemetery, on 2 January 1918.<br>
