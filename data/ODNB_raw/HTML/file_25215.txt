<span class="headword">Sharp,  Michael William</span>  (1776/7&#150;1840), <span class="occ">portrait and subject painter</span>, was born in the parish of St Paul's, Covent Garden, London, the son of Michael Sharp (1750/51&#150;1800), a principal oboe player at the Theatre Royal, Covent Garden, and music master, and his wife, an actress. He was almost certainly the Michael William Sharp who was baptized on 9 May 1779 at St Paul's, Covent Garden, the son of Michael Sharp and Elizabeth. The family moved to Norwich about 1783 or 1784. Sharp originally studied music with his father, but showed a talent for painting and may have taken lessons from the Norwich school artist, John Crome. At the age of twenty he went to London where he entered the Royal Academy Schools on 21 October 1797. By 1799 he was studying with William Beechey, whom he accompanied to Windsor Castle when Beechey was commissioned to paint portraits of the royal family. Here Sharp came to the attention of George III, who is reported to have requested many of the nobility to sit to Sharp, and &#145;The consequence was that Mr Sharp is said in a few days to have orders for 140 Pictures of Persons of the Highest Rank&#146;  (<span class="italic">Norwich Mercury</span>, 1 May 1802). These included members of the royal family.<br>
<br>Sharp first exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1801 from a London address, and continued to exhibit there until 1836. He appears to have married by 1805 when he exhibited a portrait entitled <span class="italic">Mrs Sharp</span> at the Royal Academy. He also exhibited from 1806 to 1830 with the British Institution, gaining the premium in the familiar life class for his painting <span class="italic">The Music-Master</span> in 1809. In 1808 he joined the Society for the Study of Epic and Pastoral Design (formerly the Sketching Society), whose members included the brothers John James Chalon and Alfred Edward Chalon, Francis Stevens, and Cornelius Varley. He remained with the society for a year. Sharp retained his links with Norwich and with Crome, and in 1813 he exhibited for the first time with the Norwich Society of Artists. In the same year he probably painted the portraits in Norwich Castle Museum and Art Gallery of Crome and his wife, Phoebe (exh. 1814; Norwich Society of Artists), whose youngest son (<i>b</i>. 1813) was named after him. Sharp continued to exhibit with the Norwich Society until 1821, becoming vice-president in 1816 and president in 1817, the year of his wife's death. During his visits to Norwich he stayed at Crome's home and rented a studio at the Assembly House, where he carried out commissions for portraits.<br>
<br>Probably because of his family background, many of Sharp's paintings have theatrical or musical themes and include portraits of performers. An example is his exhibit with the Royal Academy in 1823, <span class="italic">Shakespeare's jubilee, with portraits of the performers of the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, Covent Garden</span>, &#145;with the exception of Mr Macready, who declined sitting&#146;  (<span class="italic">Norwich Mercury</span>, 24 May 1823). The subject paintings and portraits, usually painted on a small scale, often have humorous overtones. When he signed his work he used initials, MWS, or M. W. Sharp. His paintings were very popular in his day and he found a ready market for them. Many were engraved, including <span class="italic">Sunday Morning</span> (engraved by Charles Heath in 1820) and his portrait of the duke of Wellington (engraved in mezzotint by William Say in 1828). In 1820 he delivered a lecture to the Philosophical Society of Norwich which was published as &#145;An essay on gesture&#146; in James Elmes's <span class="italic">Annals of the Fine Arts</span>, volumes 4 and 5. He exhibited with the Society of British Artists in 1825 and 1826. Little is known of his last years. He died in France at Boulogne in 1840.<br>
