<span class="headword">Kemp, Sir  (Edward) Peter</span>  (1934&#150;2008), <span class="occ">civil servant</span>, was born on 10 October 1934 at Broadmead, Beech Road, Haslemere, Surrey, the elder son and eldest of three children of Thomas Kemp, company director, and his wife, Nancie, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Sargent. He was educated at Millfield School and the Royal Naval College, Dartmouth, following which he entered the Royal Navy as a midshipman. With his restless energy and love of the sea he was clearly destined for a promising naval career, but this was cut short when he contracted rheumatic fever. He was invalided out of the navy and became articled as a chartered accountant. A colourful period of his life then followed with accountancy work at home and abroad, notably in Paris and in British Guiana. He married at Kensington register office on 25 November 1961 Enid van Popta, a 24-year-old secretary, and daughter of Walle Melis van Popta, psychologist. They had three sons and a daughter.<br>
<br>In 1967 Kemp joined the civil service as a direct-entry principal, under a scheme designed to secure mature entrants to the administrative class of the service. It was a stiff competition and successful entrants were expected to progress to at least under-secretary level. In his relatively short civil service career Kemp far exceeded this expectation. He initially joined the finance department of the Department of Transport, where his accountancy training, capacity for hard work, and personal application saw him rise rapidly to assistant secretary. He also attracted the attention of the Treasury, and he moved there in 1973. Promoted to under-secretary in 1978 and deputy secretary in 1983, he became the Treasury's main negotiator with the civil service unions on pay and conditions of service. This was in the aftermath of the prolonged civil service strike of 1981, occasioned when the government arbitrarily scrapped the service's pay agreement which had lasted, despite vicissitudes, since 1956. Attempts to secure a new pay agreement proved to be abortive and, in the meantime, annual pay negotiations were conducted on an ad hoc basis. In these negotiations Kemp was always courteous and as fair and flexible as his rigid constraint of predetermined cash limits would allow. His atypical Treasury approach was well described in the admission he made in 2006: &#145;I was at the Treasury, probably doing my best not to help it too much&#146;  (Witness seminar, 2006). He was an unusual senior civil servant, far removed from the cool detachment normally associated with the typical Whitehall &#145;mandarin&#146;. It is, however, a significant tribute to his skill as a negotiator that in the five-year period in which he was in charge of pay there was no serious industrial relations problem in his area of responsibility.<br>
<br>In February 1988, following the publication of Sir Robin Ibbs's report on civil service efficiency, <span class="italic">Improving Management in Government: the Next Steps</span>, the government launched a radical programme designed to separate the two distinct parts of the civil service&#151;the administrative/policy work and the day-to-day delivery of direct public services. The idea was to create operational agencies of the latter, with a designated chief executive whose powers over the budget, including pay and staffing numbers in these essentially labour-intensive areas, would go far beyond what had traditionally been allowed. This idea was not new: the Fulton committee (1968) had recommended setting up &#145;accountable management units&#146;, but the intervening twenty years had seen little progress in this direction. The new initiative was christened &#145;Next Steps&#146;, and Kemp was the brilliant choice to be its director, with the rank of second permanent secretary in the Cabinet Office.<br>
<br>On the face of things, &#145;Next Steps&#146; posed immense potential difficulties by stirring up hostilities in the centre of the service and in the departments affected. At the centre the Treasury could see its powerful position under threat, while the unions, still well organized and capable of obstruction, were suspicious that this initiative was a possible precursor to the privatization or contracting-out of the services concerned. In the departments some of the permanent secretaries (but not all) were resentful at losing control of functions for which they had been traditionally responsible. Kemp's approach, a blend of enthusiastic drive, cajolery, and endless perseverance, overcame all these potential problems. In this he had the crucial support of a dominant prime minister. With the unions he worked hard to secure at least their tacit support, involving them at each stage in consultation in an open-handed and frank way that sought to allay their misgivings. In the event this approach was successful. So far as the Treasury was concerned he was less successful. As he later remarked, &#145;It turned out, as you would expect, that the trade unions were far easier to deal with than the Treasury&#146;  (Witness seminar, 2006). Nevertheless, after four years of unremitting hard work, and in a nautical analogy that he would have liked, a &#145;Next Steps&#146; armada of large ships (such as the Benefits Agency) and some cockleshell ones (such as the QE II conference centre) was successfully launched. By the time of his death about 75 per cent of the 600,000-strong civil service would eventually be in the agencies which, notwithstanding political and economic interventions, was a notable achievement in management terms. In recognition of this Kemp was knighted KCB in 1991, having been made CB in 1988.<br>
<br>Kemp's career ended abruptly in 1992, and in a surprising fashion. The reason given for his dismissal was a clash with his recently appointed minister, William Waldegrave. There were, however, other reasons, notably the enemies that he had created among some of his peer permanent secretaries in his zealous pursuit of creating agencies. He was bitterly disappointed at his cavalier treatment and had an arguable case for constructive unfair dismissal. In the event, and like the good sailor that he had trained to be, he took his departure with dignity and not too much fuss. Perhaps he was mindful that, to some extent, he was the architect of his own downfall.<br>
<br>In retirement Kemp worked for the Foundation for Accountancy and Financial Management, a charity encouraging higher standards of accountancy in the former communist countries of central and eastern Europe. He also served on the Audit Commission (1993&#150;9), did the accounts for his local church in Sydenham, and was a governor of his old school, Millfield. He died on 24 June 2008 at King's College Hospital, Denmark Hill, London, after a short illness, and was survived by his wife and four children.<br>
