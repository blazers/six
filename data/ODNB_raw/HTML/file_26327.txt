<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Staunton,  Howard</span>  (1810&#150;1874), <span class="occ">chess player and literary scholar</span>, born probably in Westmorland in April 1810, was dubiously alleged to be the natural son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13899/', "Frederick Howard, fifth earl of Carlisle (1748&#150;1825)")</script>; officially, his father was William Staunton. He had little or no formal education, but apparently received a legacy (from Carlisle or another), which he rapidly spent. He was devoted to the stage, and claimed to have acted in his early days Lorenzo to the Shylock of Edmund Kean. Later he sought to support himself by writing on chess and (increasingly a more profitable subject) the Shakespearian drama.<br>
<br>Staunton played chess from an early age, and soon acquired a skill in the game approached only by Alexander Macdonnell and J. H. Blackburne among British players. For some twenty years a great part of Staunton's time was spent in playing the game and in writing upon it. From 1836 he frequented the Divan, Huttmann's, and other public chess resorts. Between 1840 and 1851 he made his reputation, notably by beating in 1843 (at the second attempt) St Amant, a player perhaps over-rated but representative of the hitherto dominant French school. Staunton's victory did indeed bring Britain to the fore in the chess-playing world and made him &#145;unofficial chess champion of the world&#146;  (Sergeant, 57); he sought to underline this by organizing the innovative 1851 international tournament in London. Distracted by administrative pressures, he was beaten by Anderssen and by Williams; to the latter he had given odds not long before.<br>
<br>In 1853 Staunton met one of the greatest players of any period, Baron von Heydebrand und der Lasa of Berlin, and was defeated by five games to four (with three draws). He also negotiated&#151;imaginatively, if prematurely&#151;with the chess-playing German diplomatist for an internationally recognized set of rules, including much-needed time limits. Weakened by heart disease since a bout of pneumonia in 1844, Staunton played little in public after 1853. Unfortunately, he still liked to be considered a champion, which could give rise to unpleasant misunderstandings&#151;as when the American prodigy Paul Morphy visited Britain in 1858 in the belief that Staunton had agreed to a match, but this was first put off and then abandoned.<br>
<br>Meanwhile Staunton was energetically turning his knowledge of the game to account as a journalist. In 1840, the year in which his supremacy as a player was first recognized, he projected the monthly periodical the <span class="italic">Chess Player's Chronicle</span>, which he owned and edited until he sold it in August 1854. About 1844 he took charge of the chess column in the <span class="italic">Illustrated London News</span>, which had been started two years earlier, and he ran it until his death. For some time he also edited a chess column in <span class="italic">The Era</span> newspaper. Unfortunately, he might allow &#145;his own chess ambitions greatly to influence his judgement upon others&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Field</span>, 17). He became involved in vendettas, such as that against Harruitz into which he sought to enlist Johann Loewenthal. He was also a prime mover in a quarrel between the St George's and London chess clubs&#151;partly because the latter was jealous of the former's organization of the 1851 tournament, but also perhaps because Staunton found the latter to contain an inferior class of member.<br>
<br>Staunton compiled some valuable manuals on the game. Bobby Fischer enthusiastically found Staunton &#145;the most profound opening analyst of all time&#146;  (Hooper and Whyld, 391). <span class="italic">The Chess Player's Handbook</span> (1847, repr. 1985) long deserved, and still longer retained, the reputation of being the best English treatise on its subject. His <span class="italic">Chess: Theory and Practice</span> was left in manuscript at his death, and was edited in 1876 by R. B. Wormald, who succeeded him as editor of the chess column of the <span class="italic">Illustrated London News</span>.<br>
<br>Staunton's name was conferred on the set of chess pieces designed by Nathaniel Cook which are recognized as the standard type in the English-speaking world. Add this to his successful invention of the international tournament and his far-seeing ideas about standard laws, and it may well be said: &#145;Staunton may not have been the greatest player of all time, but he probably left a deeper mark on the game than any other&#146;  (Coles, 20).<br>
<br>From 1854 Staunton largely devoted his attention to the study of Shakespeare, of whose works he had been from youth an enthusiastic admirer. Between November 1857 and May 1860 he issued, with Messrs Routledge, a new edition of Shakespeare in monthly parts, with 824 illustrations by Sir John Gilbert (3 vols., repr. 1979). Staunton's text was based on a collation of the folio editions with the early quartos and with the texts of modern editors from Rowe to Dyce, rejecting the falsifications of J. Payne Collier. The conjectural emendations, which were usually sensible, were kept within narrow limits, and showed great familiarity with Elizabethan literature and modes of speech. In 1864 Staunton issued a photolithographic facsimile of the 1600 quarto of <span class="italic">Much Ado about Nothing</span> from the copy in the Ellesmere collection, and in 1866 one of the first folio edition of Shakespeare's works of 1623. Subsequently, between October 1872 and his death, he contributed a series of nineteen articles on &#145;Unsuspected corruptions of Shakespeare's text&#146; to <span class="italic">The Athenaeum</span>  (cf. <span class="italic">Notes and Queries</span>, 6th ser. (1881), 4.264). His only other literary undertaking was a carefully compiled account of the <span class="italic">Great Schools of England</span> (1865; 2nd edn, 1869), sceptical of rote learning, corporal punishment, and excessive emphasis on the classics.<br>
<br>Staunton was a brilliant talker in congenial society, prolific in anecdote and in apt quotation from Shakespeare. He married, on 23 February 1849, Frances Carpenter, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Cates or Keates (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1882), widow of W. D. Nethersole, a solicitor, who was some years his senior. He died from a heart attack, after a history of heart trouble and bronchitis, while sitting in his library at his home, 29 Elgin Road, Kensington Park, London, on 22 June 1874. He was buried at Kensal Green cemetery.<br>
