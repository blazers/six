<span class="headword">O'Reilly,  Andrew</span>, Count O'Reilly in the Austrian nobility  (1742&#150;1832), <span class="occ">army officer in the Austrian service</span>, was born at Ballinlough, co. Roscommon, on 3 August 1742, the second son of James O'Reilly of Ballinlough and his wife, Barbara, the daughter of Andrew Nugent and his wife, Catherine. The O'Reillys traced their ancestry back to Rufus Gelasius, a thirteenth-century Irish petty prince. Andrew O'Reilly entered the Austrian service as a cadet in the 54th infantry regiment (Sinc&egrave;re, later Callenberg) on 1 November 1763. He was promoted lieutenant on 7 November 1764 and advanced to first lieutenant on 1 October 1767 and to captain on 1 December 1768. On 5 July 1778, now a major, he was transferred to the general staff, and he served as an aide-de-camp during the War of the Bavarian Succession (1778&#150;9). On 17 June 1779 O'Reilly was transferred to the 2nd regiment of Carabiniers (Erzherzog Franz); he was nominated first major on 22 December 1781 and lieutenant-colonel on 24 April 1784. He married, in 1786, Countess Maria Barbara von Sweerts-Spork (1760&#150;1834). Together they owned considerable property in Bohemia and Galicia.<br>
<br>In the summer of 1787 O'Reilly killed the major of his regiment in a duel but was acquitted by a court martial. He was elevated to the rank of count (Graf) on 8 October 1787. From December 1787 he served with the Hohenzollern cuirassiers, and from 1789 to 1794 he was commanding colonel of the Modena chevauxlegers. He was present at the taking of Belgrade in 1789 during the Turkish War. In the war against revolutionary France he fought in the Low Countries (1792&#150;4) and was promoted major-general (22 July 1794). While serving with the Austrian army in Germany he distinguished himself repeatedly during the campaigns of 1796&#150;7, but he was wounded and made prisoner in April 1797.<br>
<br>After being promoted Feldmarschall-Leutnant on 6 March 1800 O'Reilly served with the Austrian army in Italy during the campaign of 1800. On 18 August 1801 he received the knight's cross of the military order of Maria Theresa, and the same year he was made imperial chamberlain. He was promoted colonel-proprietor of the 3rd regiment of chevauxlegers on 2 October 1803. In the campaign of 1805 he fought at the head of a division at the battle of Caldiero (29&#150;31 October 1805). His personal bravery won him the commander's cross of the order of Maria Theresa (April 1806). From February to May 1809 he was vice-commander of Lower Austria and in charge of the provincial militia forces, but he was then ordered back to Vienna to help organize the defence of the Austrian capital against the approaching French forces. After two days of heavy bombardment Vienna surrendered on 13 May 1809; the garrison escaped across the Danube. The thankless task of signing the capitulation fell to O'Reilly, who retired with the rank of General der Kavallerie on 7 January 1810. He died at Vienna on 5 July 1832 and was buried at the cemetery of Matzleinsdorf in Vienna. As he had no children O'Reilly had adopted as his heir John O'Reilly (<i>b</i>. 1800), the son of his elder brother Sir Hugh O'Reilly and his wife, Catherine Mary Anne Matthew; John served until 1850 as a major of hussars in the Austrian service. Andrew O'Reilly's younger brother James also entered the Austrian army.<br>
