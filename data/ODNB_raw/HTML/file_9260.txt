<span class="headword">Fell <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Askew]</span>,  Margaret</span>  (1614&#150;1702), <span class="occ">Quaker leader</span>, was born at Marsh Grange, near Dalton in Furness, Lancashire, the eldest of two daughters of John Askew, landowner, of Marsh Grange. Her father was a man of &#145;considerable estate which had been in his name and family for several generations&#146;  (Ross, 5). Her mother may have been the Margaret Pyper who married John Askew in February 1613 in Dalton in Furness, Lancashire. Very little is known of Fell's ancestry, although she had a sister who married Matthew Richardson, a Dalton attorney.<h2>
<a name="Earlyyears"></a>Early years</h2>In 1632, at seventeen, Margaret married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9262/', "Thomas Fell (bap. 1599, d. 1658)")</script>, judge and politician, of Swarthmoor Hall, Ulverston, Lancashire, then a barrister of Gray's Inn. The Fell family had achieved gentry status in Lancashire in the wake of the Henrician dissolution of the monasteries. Margaret and Thomas had nine children, of whom one son and seven daughters born between 1632 and 1653 survived to adulthood. Thomas Fell was an important figure in local society, serving as a justice of the peace, and was a parliamentary sequestrator in 1642. In 1646 he was returned to parliament in a recruiter election and served as chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster, and by 1651 he was an assize judge in north Wales and Cheshire. The Fells supported William Lampit, a former New Model Army preacher and independent minister at St Mary's, Ulverston, and also welcomed into their home itinerant preachers. In late June 1652, while Thomas Fell was away from home on legal business, a travelling minister, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/10031/', "George Fox (1624&#150;1691)")</script>, came to Swarthmoor Hall and converted Margaret Fell, her daughters, and most of her household to Quakerism. Margaret later described her experience of listening to Fox criticize those who understood scripture only with their minds: &#145;this opened me so, that it cut me to the heart; and then I saw clearly that we were all wrong&#146;  (Mack, 145). Upon his return Judge Fell was troubled by his wife's sudden conversion to this new dissenting sect, but Margaret convinced her husband of her new-found faith and introduced Fox to him. After her conversion to Quakerism she ceased to attend St Mary's, Ulverston, although her husband continued to attend regularly without her, and never converted to the sect. However, his sympathy towards Quakers was important, especially given his judicial position, and he allowed the Friends to hold their meetings at Swarthmoor Hall free from persecution.<br>
<br>At Swarthmoor Hall as early as 1653 Margaret Fell established the Kendal Fund to aid travelling Quaker missionaries and their families, particularly those in financial distress due to imprisonment. She appointed two agents to collect and disburse money to itinerant Quaker ministers. She wrote letters of encouragement to the ministers in the field as well as to Quakers in prison. In 1655 she was being addressed by fellow Quakers as &#145;a nursing mother thou art who feeds the hungry with good things, but the fat with Judgment, who kills and slays the living and raises the dead&#146;  (Mack, 40). From the mid-1650s, for a generation, the issue of persecution which inspired so many Quaker writings was a gnawing problem for the Quakers. Fell sent four letters between 1655 and 1657 to Lord Protector Oliver Cromwell. One of the two penned in 1656 reminded him of his promise of liberty of conscience, and warned of the consequences of his religious policy:<blockquote>thou art feasting and feeding with Riotous Persons, with Musick, and sporting with them; which Practices are abominable to God; as also thy upholding such an abominable Priesthood; who instead of allowing the Liberty of Conscience promised, do Persecute and Sue Men to Treble Damages for obeying Truth, and seize on their Goods, and Imprison their Persons. (Kunze, <span class="italic">Margaret Fell</span>, 132)</blockquote>Thomas Fell's death in 1658 deprived the Quakers of a judicial protector. Margaret was left a widow, aged forty-four, with eight unmarried children. She later wrote of her husband that he had been &#145;a tender loving husband to me, and a tender father to his children&#146;, and had &#145;left a good and competent estate for them&#146;  (Kunze, <span class="italic">Margaret Fell</span>, 32). Thomas Fell's will probably dealt only with unsettled property as his son and heir, George, was not mentioned. Margaret was specifically left Swarthmoor Hall and 50 adjacent acres (she had already inherited the Askew estate at Marsh Grange from her father), while she remained a widow. The remainder of her husband's real and personal estate was to be divided equally among his daughters. Thomas Fell's death allowed Margaret to become an authoritative, pro-active Quaker minister who wrote and travelled and who became a political spokeswoman of the movement. She emerged as in effect a co-leader of early Quakerism with George Fox. In the late 1650s the Quakers began to organize as a church. Under Fox's leadership mostly, but with the help of other early ministers, a multi-tiered organization of local, or &#145;particular&#146;, monthly and then quarterly regional Quaker meetings for worship and business evolved. Fell was actively involved in this organization, not least as a veritable postmistress as Swarthmoor developed into a clearing house for correspondence, particularly to and from itinerant preachers and the peripatetic Fox.<br>
<br>Fell was also active in trying to influence political events in 1659, in July signing a petition from Quaker women against tithes and in October sending an epistle to the army council. She continued this activity following the Restoration. In May or June 1660 Fell left Swarthmoor for London to try to gain the release of George Fox, who had been imprisoned in Lancaster. She wrote several letters to Charles II reminding him of the promises he had made in the declaration of Breda to allow religious liberty to &#145;tender consciences&#146;. Fell's most important statement addressed to Charles II, and delivered personally in London in June 1660, was a defence of the Quaker principle of peaceful living, and explained why Quakers opposed oath taking, hat honour, and payment of tithes: &#145;we who are the People of God called Quakers, who are hated and despised, and everywhere spoken against, as People not fit to live &hellip; we have been a Suffering People under every Power and Change &hellip; persecuted by them all&#146;. She assured the king that:<blockquote>our Intentions and Endeavours are and shall be Good, True, Honest and Peaceable &hellip; we do Love own, Honour the King and these present Governors, so far as they do Rule for God and his Truth and do not impose anything upon People's Consciences &hellip; We are a People that follow after those things that make for Peace, Love and Unity &hellip; [we] do deny and bear our testimony against all Strife and wars &hellip; Our weapons are not carnal, but Spiritual. (Kunze, <span class="italic">Margaret Fell</span>, 138)</blockquote>Thirteen early Quaker leaders signed Fell's declaration, including George Fox and Richard Hubberthorne. Fox and Hubberthorne issued a peace declaration of their own in January 1661, which was subsequently looked upon by Quakers as their official peace testimony, but which appeared seven months after Fell's declaration. Despite Fell's efforts to inform Charles II of the peaceable ideals of the movement, persecution of Quakers increased, with Friends being imprisoned for nonconformity and their refusal to take the oath of allegiance. Fell later recorded that during this period in London, &#145;I spake often with the king, and writ many Letters and Papers unto him and many books were given by our Friends to Parliament &hellip; and they were fully informed of our peaceable Principles and Practices&#146;  (Kunze, <span class="italic">Margaret Fell</span>, 17). She also sent letters to other members of the royal family, such as the dukes of York and Gloucester and Queen Henrietta Maria, to plead for the release of Quakers from prison. Fell's gentry status gave her an entr&eacute;e to court. She admitted that she was of a &#145;great family&#146; and therefore she was &#145;moved of the Lord to go to the King&#146;  (ibid., 16). As another early Quaker leader, Francis Howgill, wrote of Fell's time in London, her &#145;servise &hellip; hath been good, and that which could not have been performed by many&#146;  (ibid., 137).<br>
<br>The Fifth Monarchy uprising of January 1661 caused continued hostility towards Quakers, and Margaret delayed her return from London to continue working for the release of Quakers from prison. The king promised Margaret that the imprisoned Quakers would be freed, but the political situation, combined with the entrenched Anglicanism of the privy council and parliament, made it impossible. All her visits to the king and her papers written advocating the release could do was raise awareness of the plight of Quakers. She returned from London in September 1662.<h2>
<a name="Swarthmoorandpraemunire"></a>Swarthmoor and praemunire</h2>From 1664 until 1689 conventicle or sectarian worship was illegal in England. Despite this the Quakers continued to meet for worship, sometimes publicly but usually in private homes, thus incurring sporadic and occasionally heavy persecution from local authorities. In winter 1663&#150;4 both Fell and Fox were arrested by the local constables for holding Quaker meetings at Swarthmoor Hall. At the next assizes held at Lancaster in March 1664 both were tendered the oath of allegiance. Fell was found guilty of refusing the oath and of holding Quaker meetings in her home, and was imprisoned in Lancaster Castle. On 29 August Margaret appeared at the assizes, declaring &#145;I am clear and innocent of the wronging any man upon the Earth, as my little child that stands by me here&#146;  (Mack, 180), presumably a reference to her youngest daughter Rachel. Unimpressed, the judge handed down the sentence of <i>praemunire</i> against her, a serious matter for property holders like Fell because it meant that the convicted person's estate was forfeit to the crown and the person could be imprisoned indefinitely. She later wrote that &#145;the Great God of Heaven and Earth supported my Spirit under the severe Sentence that I was not terrified&#146;  (Kunze, <span class="italic">Margaret Fell</span>, 18). Fell's daughters continued to live at Swarthmoor during their mother's imprisonment, and George Fell took steps to keep the property within the family, and protect his interest in Swarthmoor Hall by petitioning for a grant of the forfeited estate, which was duly given him in January 1665. The Fell trial became a well-known example of a trial over the issue of refusing the oath of allegiance on the grounds that Quakers could not swear to the king of England, as their allegiance was to Christ alone. Fell's incarceration lasted from March 1664 until June 1668.<h2>
<a name="Imprisonmentandpublishedwritings"></a>Imprisonment and published writings</h2>During her imprisonment Fell wrote several tracts in defence of Quaker principles, among which was her most famous published piece, <span class="italic">Women's Speaking Justified</span> (1666). She defended the right of women to be Quaker preachers, arguing that the Quaker ministry was a spiritual and &#145;called&#146; ministry. Those persons, regardless of gender, who experienced the divine light or leading of the Holy Spirit were the true ministers of Christ. She noted some twenty-four female biblical figures to support her view that Quaker women who were in the power of the Spirit or inward spirit should preach, teach, and minister. Fell made the distinction that foolish, gossiping, carnal women were to be barred from speaking for they were not of the &#145;Seed of the Promise&#146;  (Kunze, <span class="italic">Margaret Fell</span>, 19). In theory, at least, the seed democratized the Quaker fellowship, and smashed through the political, religious, social, and gender restraints placed upon women. The concept of female ministry stirred a major debate between Quakers and most protestants. Fell's defence of women preachers was important because it was one of the first, and written by a Quaker woman. As a fervent and assertive Quaker apologist, Fell was not reticent in participating in some of the doctrinal debates of her generation. Fell's works, such as <span class="italic">A Call to the Universal Seed of God</span> (1664), and <span class="italic">A Call to the Seed of Israel</span> (1668), touched on protestant arguments over subjects such as Christology, election, revelation, millenarianism, and the conversion of Jews.<br>
<br>Fell's four-year incarceration gave her a special status among Quakers, left unaltered her will to resist persecution, and seemingly hardened her views on the clergy. Shortly after her release from Lancaster Castle in 1668 Fell wrote a tract against bishops, oath taking, ordained ministry, infant baptism, and the eucharist, addressed to the Anglican, Cambridge-educated priest Allen Smallwood of Greystoke, Cumberland. This document was her response to a sermon preached by Smallwood in 1668 in which he gave the Anglican casuistic view of the Matthean text, &#145;swear not all&#146;  (<span class="roman">Matthew</span> 5: 34). Smallwood argued that this text did not prohibit all swearing in all situations. Fell's emotional reply wasted no time with diplomacy. She stated her opinion of Smallwood, the Anglican clergy in general, and gave her interpretation on various aspects of Quaker doctrine and principle as they were developing in the 1660s. She called Smallwood a blind, ignorant priest, and she accused the clergy and bishops in general of being &#145;debauched smearmongerers&#146;, adding &#145;and what is your spiritual men and clergymen as thou calls them whether Bishops or whatsoever titles thou gives them, else what are they butt a heap of evill doers and workers off iniquity&#146;  (Kunze, <span class="italic">Margaret Fell</span>, 20). Fell's unpublished manuscript provides a contemporary expression of the Anglican&#150;Quaker antagonism of the period. She expressed only antipathy for Smallwood and his ilk who represented for her the ultimate in hypocrisy and dissimulation.<h2>
<a name="Secondmarriage"></a>Second marriage</h2>Before George Fox travelled to Ireland in May 1669 he and Margaret had agreed to marry. In mid-October 1669 the couple duly informed the Bristol meeting of their intentions, first to the men's meeting and then to a joint meeting of men and women. They married on 27 October with Margaret's daughters and their husbands present. A notable absentee was Margaret's only son, George Fell, who disapproved of the match. Mother and son were estranged in part over her marriage and in part over the ownership of Swarthmoor until George's premature death a year later. Fox signed a contract waiving his rights to Margaret's property, and her daughters, who were to inherit Swarthmoor Hall should she remarry, agreed to allow her to live there. The marriage did not impede their personal ministries, for a few days after the wedding Fox continued on his missionary visits while Margaret returned to Swarthmoor. However, the marriage removed Margaret's formal right to reside at Swarthmoor and George Fell took legal steps to regain possession, offering his mother &pound;200 per annum provided that she vacated possession. In April 1670 Margaret was imprisoned in Lancaster, possibly at the instigation of her son, and while incarcerated she was subject to a phantom pregnancy. Meanwhile George Fell died in October 1670. In April 1671 Margaret was pardoned and released and Swarthmoor was granted by the crown to Susannah and Rachel Fell. Legal proceedings continued for years as George Fell's widow, Hannah, took steps to protect her son's interest in Swarthmoor. After the death of George Fox and the majority of George Fell's son, Charles, a settlement was finally concluded in 1691 when Rachel Fell's husband, Daniel Abraham, bought out Charles Fell's share in the estate, as well as the shares of his sisters-in-law.<h2>
<a name="Womensmeetings"></a>Women's meetings</h2>Margaret was fundamental to the evolution of the Quaker women's meeting as it developed outside London. The revolutionary concept of Quaker women's separate meetings for business, according to standard Quaker literature, emerged from Fox's writings in the 1660s. He called for women as &#145;helpmeets&#146; to men to meet separately and organize for the discharging of duties of charity, care for the elderly, and the instruction of the younger women. The earliest women's meetings occurred in London in the late 1650s. Fox spoke in favour of women's meetings in 1669, and in 1671 again exhorted Quaker women to organize separate business meetings in the format of the London women's meetings with their visitations of the sick, the poor, prisoners, widows, and orphans, along with moral oversight of women. These female duties, Fox wrote, could best be handled by the women and in turn strengthen group survival. Fox's 1671 epistle preceded a journey to America; Margaret accompanied the party which saw Fox off at Gravesend, and even went on with him to the Downs near Deal. Following his departure she immediately returned to Swarthmoor and set up the Swarthmoor women's monthly meeting (SWMM). The first meeting took place at her home on 25 October 1671, and the first order of business was taking a collection for the poor. Subsequently the existence and scope of women's meetings became controversial, especially over the issue of women's meetings overseeing Quaker marriage procedure. This was part of a larger controversy involving opposition to the Fox&#150;Fell leadership, which erupted with the Wilkinson&#150;Story schism in 1674.<br>
<br>In the 1670s Margaret and the SWMM, with few precedents except the London meetings, hammered out a discipline for women to follow. The SWMM outlined in detail what it meant in daily life to &#145;walk as becomes Truth&#146;  (Kunze, <span class="italic">Margaret Fell</span>, 143). Quaker discipline was of utmost importance to the Swarthmoor women. Margaret's daughters attended the SWMM when living at or visiting Swarthmoor and <a href="#cosubject_69081">Sarah [<i>see below</i>]</a> and Rachel acted as clerks of the meeting at various times between 1671 and 1702. The SWMM became a model for Quaker women and Margaret's leadership directed Quaker women away from individual reliance on inward spiritual authority, which was characteristic of the earliest phase of the Quaker movement, to a more group-orientated authority with a stress on a deaconess-style ministry and lives of discipline and charitable service. Margaret's role was of central importance in the organization and management of the SWMM and subsequently the larger regional Lancaster women's quarterly meeting over a period of thirty years. She called the first meeting at her home; her name appeared among the signatures of regular attendees at the end of the meeting's minutes; she on occasion acted as arbitrator for internal disputes; she was innovative in her ideas on women's proper role in the certification process of Quaker marriages; and she remained involved in all the activities of the SWMM over the remaining thirty years of her life. Her leadership in this area helped to bring about internal stability in the newly emerging Quaker church order and thus helped the Quaker movement to survive and grow through an era of sectarian persecutions when religious tolerance was little valued in the wider society.<h2>
<a name="Laterlife"></a>Later life</h2>As mistress of Swarthmoor Hall Margaret continued to hold meetings at her home, for which she endured fines, or distraint of goods, as did her neighbours. Margaret kept a record over the years of the persecution of local Quakers at the hands of the local JPs and constables in the 1670s and 1680s. In June 1673 Margaret travelled to Bristol to meet George Fox on his return from America. Although Fox had endured several imprisonments during his roving ministry, one of the harshest incarcerations was in Worcester from December 1673 to February 1675, which threatened his life. Upon hearing of his serious illness Margaret travelled from Swarthmoor to Worcester in August 1674, and then went to London in October to try to secure his release. When Fox was freed in February 1675, she took him back to Swarthmoor to convalesce, his first return to Swarthmoor since his marriage. His stay of twenty-one months from June 1675 to March 1677 was his longest stay with his wife, after which he recommenced his travels. Although he returned again to recover his strength from September 1678 to March 1680, Fox chose to base his activities away from Swarthmoor. Margaret later wistfully recalled that &#145;although the Lord had provided a habitation for him, yet he was not willing to stay at it because it was so remote and far from London, where his service most lay&#146;. She had continued to live at Swarthmoor Hall &#145;where God had placed and set me&#146; for the ordering of farm and family. Thus on &#145;truth's account&#146; they denied themselves &#145;that comfort which one might have had in being together, for the sake and service of the Lord and his truth&#146;  (Kunze, <span class="italic">Margaret Fell</span>, 22). The marriage became a model of early Quaker ministry which sacrificed all in the name of &#145;Truth&#146;. Margaret understood at the beginning that marriage to a wandering, charismatic, religious leader would not be conventional or easy and her late-in-life commentary indicated she had long ago accepted that reality, albeit after some initial qualms.<br>
<br>From May to July 1681 Margaret was in London, a visit which coincided with her daughter Sarah's marriage to William Mead. In September 1683 she was arrested at Swarthmoor for holding a conventicle and imprisoned. This treatment prompted a further trip to London from November 1684 to March 1685 to lobby the crown against the persecution of Quakers. She duly had an interview with the new king, James II, who told her to return home. Margaret made what was to be her final visit to her husband in London between April and June 1690. In January 1691 she received word from William Penn of Fox's death. Her &#145;dear husband&#146; was, she wrote, &#145;the instrument of the hand of the Lord in this present age&#146;  (Kunze, <span class="italic">Margaret Fell</span>, 24). Margaret remained at Swarthmoor, apart from one trip to London in 1697. In June 1698 she wrote a letter to William III to commend him on his &#145;Gentle Government and Clemency, and Gracious Acts&#146;  (ibid., 23). One of her final epistles to Quakers, written in April 1700, criticized the emerging interest in Quaker conformity of dress. She called the grey costume that was becoming popular a &#145;silly poor gospel&#146;. The new style of dress was setting Quakers apart from the world as God's special people, and it was not an indicator of their interior spiritual religion and purity. She cautioned, &#145;Let us beware of this, of separating or looking upon ourselves to be more holy, than in deed and truth we are&#146;  (Ross, 379&#150;80). She died at Swarthmoor Hall on 23 April 1702 attended by her youngest daughter, Rachel, and was interred in the Quaker burial-ground at Swarthmoor. The Abrahams duly inherited Margaret's estate and the family lived at Swarthmoor until 1759.<h2>
<a name="Significance"></a>Significance</h2>Margaret Fell's religion was the wellspring of her life, and it superseded all other values and relationships after her conversion to Quakerism in 1652. She promoted Fox's primary leadership in the early Quaker movement. Her personal drive, social position, connections, permanence of place, practical skills, wealth, personal appeal, and longevity contributed to a significant degree to Fox's <i>primus inter pares</i> status in Quakerism. She made Swarthmoor Hall a Quaker centre early in the movement's history, and it became a repository of Quaker writings and correspondence, especially those of Fox. It is evident that her personal power was greater than traditional Quaker historiography has conceded and that she was, although less acclaimed, as significant a leader as Fox in the formative years of Quakerism. However, not all Quakers held her in high esteem. Some of the Quakers who fell foul of Margaret believed that she used her wealth and social position to dominate meetings. Thus the Quaker Thomas Rawlinson, a steward of the Fells' iron forge near Swarthmoor, thought she &#145;loves to be great in the earth and among friends &hellip; to sit as judges and to reign &hellip; even as a queen upon the people&#146;  (Kunze, <span class="italic">Margaret Fell</span>, 114). After her death Margaret's published and unpublished papers and epistles were published under the direction of her daughters and sons-in-law in 1712, as <span class="italic">A brief collection of remarkable passages and occurrences relating to the birth, education, life, conversion, travels, services, and deep sufferings of that ancient, eminent, and faithful servant of the Lord, Margaret Fell, but by her second marriage M. Fox</span>.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_69081"></a><span class="headword">Sarah Fell</span>  (1642&#150;1714), <span class="occ">Quaker preacher</span>, was born at Swarthmoor Hall in 1642, the fourth daughter of Margaret and Thomas Fell. She accompanied her mother on her missionary visit to Devon and Cornwall in May&#150;August 1663. As the eldest daughter then resident at Swarthmoor during her mother's imprisonment between 1664 and 1668, it fell to Sarah to become the chief overseer of affairs on the estate, particularly the running of the home farm. She continued with this task during her mother's frequent absences from Swarthmoor. She kept a careful record of the income and expenses from raising livestock and produce on the farm and continued to do this following Margaret's release. The record for 1673&#150;8 is extant in <span class="italic">The Household Account Book of Sarah Fell</span> (1920), which details the household economy and living patterns of the Fells. The account book gives evidence that although the Fells held on to their gentry status, their conversion to Quakerism caused a reshuffling of their social network, replacing their former county-wide gentry network with a Quaker network. It also demonstrates Sarah's role in the management of the family's iron forges, and as a local banker.<br>
<br>Sarah also acted as clerk to the Swarthmoor women's meeting and the Lancashire quarterly meeting, resigning both only when she went south upon her marriage. In June 1681 Sarah married the widowed <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18469/', "William Mead (c.1627&#150;1713)")</script>, merchant, a wealthy London linen draper of Fenchurch Street, who shortly after his marriage purchased an estate at Gooses, near Barking in Essex. This was to provide a convenient resting place for Quakers visiting London, particularly George Fox and Susannah Fell, who spent long periods living with her sister, before and after her own marriage in 1691. Sarah had one son, Nathaniel, born in May 1684, who became a prominent barrister and serjeant-at-law, was MP for Aylesbury (1715&#150;22), and was knighted in February 1715. Ensconced in Essex, Sarah took over as clerk of the Box meeting, remaining so until 1708. She survived her husband, who died on 3 April 1713. She made her will three days later and following her death on 9 June 1714 was buried with Mead in the Quaker burial-ground at Barking. According to the Dutch writer Gerard Croese, Sarah was &#145;so stupendously eloquent in discoursing and preaching and so effectual and fervent in her addresses and supplications to God, that she ravished all her beholders and hearers with admiration and wonder&#146;  (Ross, 313&#150;14).<br>
