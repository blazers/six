<span class="headword">Browne,  Kathleen Anne</span>  (1876&#150;1943), <span class="occ">politician and historian</span>, was born at Bridgetown, co. Wexford, on 31 October 1876, the eldest daughter of Michael Browne, landowner and farmer, and his wife, Mary Eleanor Stafford, of Rathronan Castle, Wexford. She was educated at the Bridgetown national school and at the Loreto convent at Wexford. Her political background was strongly nationalist, her father having been an organizer in 1898 of the centenary celebrations of the United Irishmen rising and a nationalist member of the Wexford county council.<br>
<br>Kathleen Browne became a close associate of Arthur Griffith and an active member of the Gaelic League, serving as secretary of the Wexford county committee. A committed nationalist, she was a member of Sinn F&eacute;in (1912&#150;27) and the Irish Volunteers from 1914. She lived most of her life at her family home, Rathronan Castle, from which she flew a tricolour during the Easter rising of 1916. She attempted to reach Dublin during the rising, but was arrested at Bray and incarcerated in Kilmainham and Mountjoy prisons.<br>
<br>Browne sided with the pro-treaty faction during the Irish civil war, becoming a member of the national army. In common with a number of other pro-treatyites, she became a member of Cumman na nGadeheal, representing the party in the senate of the Irish Free State from her election in June 1929. She went on to join the Army Comrades Association in 1933, an organization which upheld the Irish Free State and sought to commemorate the fallen of the Irish civil war. Its members were popularly known as Blueshirts and became strongly associated with anti-communism. Browne underlined her dedication to this organization by her insistence on wearing a blue shirt in the Irish senate. In 1934 she provoked a quarrel between the speakers of the senate and the D&aacute;il when she sought permission to bring visitors wearing blue shirts into the senate.<br>
<br>Browne was strongly associated with various aspects of Wexford life, where she was an active farmer. She served on the Wexford county council and was the county's peace commissioner from 1923. As well as her political work, Browne wrote on historical matters, focusing particularly on the history of Wexford. Her history of the county, published in 1927, became a standard primary school textbook. She was an acknowledged expert on the county's Yola dialect, and published widely in historical journals. A regular speaker in the senate on agricultural topics, she also lectured on dairying under the department of agriculture and was a member of the Wexford Agriculture Society, the Irish Countrywomen's Association, and the Irish Farmers' Union, whom she represented at the World Poultry Congress, held in London in 1930. Kathleen Browne died of cardiac failure at her home, Rathronan Castle, Bridgetown, co. Wexford, on 9 October 1943.<br>
