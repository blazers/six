<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Hordern, Sir  Michael Murray</span>  (1911&#150;1995), <span class="occ">actor</span>, was born on 4 October 1911 at The Poplars, High Street, Berkhamsted, Hertfordshire, the youngest of the three sons (he had a younger stepsister) of Captain Edward Joseph Calverley Hordern, officer in the Royal Indian Marines, and his wife, Margaret Emily, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Murray, whose family had invented Milk of Magnesia. He was educated at Windlesham House preparatory school and Brighton College, where he made his first stage appearances in Gilbert and Sullivan operettas. For much of his childhood he felt very much in the shadow of his immediately elder brother, Peter, who won a rugby blue at Oxford and went on to play for England. By the time Hordern himself was of college age family funds had run low, and he went into prep-school teaching before becoming a commercial traveller for the Educational Supply Association, selling chalk and blackboards by day and working at night in amateur theatricals at the St Pancras People's Theatre.<br>
<br>Hordern was twenty-five before he felt secure enough to abandon life as a chalk salesman and start out as an assistant stage manager at the Savoy Theatre; in the late 1930s he also found work with an East End theatre company and at the Little Theatre in Bristol. In 1940 he played PC James Hawkins, and then the Stranger, in <span class="italic">Without the Prince</span> at the Whitehall Theatre. He made his first, brief, screen appearance in 1940 with Emlyn Williams and Margaret Lockwood in the Carol Reed thriller <span class="italic">The Girl in the News</span>.<br>
<br>In 1940 Hordern joined the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve, initially as a gunner. His first ship was a merchant ship carrying 10,000 tons of munitions. He later recalled:<blockquote>the second night out the convoy in which we were sailing was attacked by U-boats. We were going with the guns all night and when the sun came up the sea was completely empty. Four of the other ships around us had gone down and the others had scattered. My second night out and almost my last. I was frightened that night. That was when I grew up. (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 25 Nov 1989)</blockquote>He subsequently served on the aircraft-carrier <i>Illustrious</i> where, with another actor, Robert Eddison, he was responsible among much else for shipboard entertainments. On 27 April 1943 he married Grace Eveline Mortimer (1914/15&#150;1986), daughter of Dudley Mortimer, schoolmaster. They had met before the war, at the Little Theatre, Bristol. They had one daughter. Hordern ended the war as a lieutenant-commander.<br>
<br>In 1946 Hordern returned to the stage as Torvald Helmer in <span class="italic">A Doll's House</span> at the Intimate Theatre, Palmer's Green. He continued to carve out an impressive classical stage career as a riotously comic Bottom in Purcell's <span class="italic">Fairy Queen</span> at Covent Garden (1946). He then played Richard Fenton in the long-running <span class="italic">Dear Murderer</span> at the Aldwych (1946), and Captain Hoyle in <span class="italic">Noose</span> at the Saville (1947). He spent two Christmases (1948 and 1949) at Stratford upon Avon as Mr Toad in <span class="italic">Toad of Toad Hall</span>, and made a celebrated appearance in the film <span class="italic">Passport to Pimlico</span> (1949), as the police inspector trying unsuccessfully to restore British authority in the inner-London republic. In 1950 he joined the Alec Clunes Company at the Arts for Chekhov's <span class="italic">Ivanov</span> (1950) and John Whiting's <span class="italic">Saint's Day</span> (1951), in which he first made his name. That in turn led him back to Stratford for a 1952 <span class="italic">As You Like It</span>, in which his Jacques was reviewed by Kenneth Tynan: &#145;a great performance, rooted in self-disgust, but with a tattered plume of merriment capering always over his head&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 4 May 1995). As so often, Tynan there caught not just a performance, but the essence of an entire career.<br>
<br>Hordern now became established on screen as a fine if sinister character actor, with parts in <span class="italic">Alexander the Great</span> (1956), <span class="italic">Cleopatra</span> (1963), and <span class="italic">The Spy who Came in from the Cold</span> (1965), but on stage his work was always more varied, even quirky; he played in the John Mortimer comedy <span class="italic">The Dock Brief</span> (1958) as well as the premi&egrave;re of Harold Pinter's <span class="italic">The Collection</span> (1962) and in equally early work by Tom Stoppard (<span class="italic">Enter a Free Man</span>, 1968), David Mercer (<span class="italic">Flint</span>, 1970), and Alan Ayckbourn (<span class="italic">Relatively Speaking</span>, 1967). His first <span class="italic">King Lear</span> was for Jonathan Miller at the Nottingham Playhouse in 1969, and then in 1972 he achieved true greatness in Tom Stoppard's complex <span class="italic">Jumpers</span> as George Moore, the philosophy don forever debating with himself and occasionally with a tortoise. He was still playing the role seven years later, but in starry 1980s revivals of <span class="italic">You Never can Tell</span> (1987) and <span class="italic">The Rivals</span> (1983) he was to prove equally impressive in period comedy. His last stage appearance was in a revival of <span class="italic">Trelawny of the Wells</span> in 1992, and on television he was seen a few months before his own death as the dying Featherstone in the BBC's acclaimed <span class="italic">Middlemarch</span> (1994).<br>
<br>Hordern's marriage was not improved by a long love affair with the actress <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/49594/', "Coral Edith Browne (1913&#150;1991)")</script>, and he shared his later life with the actress Patricia England. His other true passion was fly-fishing, which he once expounded in a lengthy television series; he lived near the river in Bagnor, near Newbury, Berkshire, where he was for many years president of the Friends of the Watermill Theatre. He was appointed CBE in 1972 and knighted in 1983. He died at the Churchill Hospital, Oxford, on 2 May 1995, and was survived by his only child, Joanna, and by the memories of millions of stage and screen audiences around the world who cherished his anarchic brilliance in both comedy and tragedy, specializing as he did in morose clergymen, bizarre diplomats, dotty generals, and tetchy fathers. A memorial service was held at St Paul's, Covent Garden, on 3 October 1995.<br>
<br>Hordern was offstage the least theatrical of leading men, yet established on stage and screen a career of considerable versatility and integrity in a golden age for British classical players. Once described, not entirely flatteringly, as &#145;the Austin Princess among British actors&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 4 May 1995), implying reliability but a faint lack of charisma, he in fact grew in later years into one of the great eccentrics of his profession, perched perilously somewhere half way between Alistair Sim and Alec Guinness. He played many of the great classical roles (Lear, Macbeth, Chekhov's Ivanov), but was equally loved by younger audiences for his Paddington Bear and Toad of Toad Hall.<br>
