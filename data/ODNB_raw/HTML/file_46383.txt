<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Sutton,  John</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1777, <em>d.</em> 1863), <span class="occ">corn dealer and seedsman</span>, was baptized at St Mary Somerset, London, on 1 June 1777, the fourth son in a family of six sons and four daughters of James Sutton (1744&#150;1789), partner in Sutton and Winckworth, flour factors, and his wife, Anne Martha (1749&#150;1789), daughter of John and Rachel Johnston, also of London. Both parents died prematurely in 1789, and the seven surviving children were brought up by the Winckworths. After apprenticeship in the firm, about 1800 John and his elder brother James moved to Reading, and ran some mills which they had inherited along the River Kennet. In 1806 John established a corn and meal business in King Street; three years later he married Sarah, daughter of Joseph Norris of Shinfield, near Reading. Three sons and three daughters survived infancy.<br>
<br>During the final decade of the Napoleonic wars, the brothers built up a thriving business. Then early in 1815 their Reading bank, Marsh and Deane, failed at the same time as a major customer in London to whom they regularly consigned substantial quantities of flour. They had very large overdrafts, which the commissioners of bankruptcy put intense pressure on them to repay. James, owing &pound;1450, had to declare himself bankrupt, and died of drink in 1826. John apparently reached an accommodation with the commissioners for the &pound;960 he owed and was able to continue trading on a modest scale. His only known portrait reveals the face, under an impressive stovepipe hat, of a man who has known genuine misfortune. During this critical period his second son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/38036/', "Martin Hope Sutton (1815&#150;1901)")</script>, was born, the name Hope expressing his parents' aspiration for better times to come.<br>
<br>Owing to indifferent health and his wife's prolonged illness before she died in 1834, John Sutton was by 1827 barely capable of managing on his own. Martin therefore had to leave school at the age of twelve, and enter the firm. From 1829 onwards he took over the counting-house, and with the help of an outside loan&#151;not paid off until 1841&#151;he restored the finances. Aware that the corn trade had only a limited commercial future, Martin soon began to deal in the more profitable line of seeds. However, his father insisted that he must carry out all seed activities, as well as the study of botanic works, outside working hours, and only after a time allowed him to open accounts with London seed wholesalers. In 1836, when Martin was twenty-one, he became a partner.<br>
<br>While Martin was energetically building up all sides of the business, John Sutton was little more than an adviser and helper. His lethargy sprang from the result of his doctor's earlier advice&#151;that he should fortify himself daily with strong drink. By 1838 he had become so forgetful, bilious, and irritable that Martin resolved to cure him of his addiction, distracting him by spending as much time with him as could be spared, and thereby restoring him to health. John Sutton finally retired in 1850.<br>
<br>John Sutton is of interest as typifying a provincial tradesman of the period: limited in his education but, by dint of reading, well up in history and public affairs, and, as a moderate whig, able to trace current political ills back to those ultimately responsible. Originally a Unitarian, he later worshipped in the established church, audibly and fervently joining in that part of the liturgy acceptable to him and ostentatiously silent when he disagreed.<br>
<br>A man of the utmost probity, John Sutton's family respected and feared rather than loved him. He had ambitions for his brighter children, training his eldest son for medicine and briefly apprenticing Martin to a surveyor. As he refused to entertain or be entertained, his three daughters never had the opportunity of marrying; after working hard in the early days, they were later condemned to idleness. They lived with him until he died at his home, Southampton Villa, Reading, on 31 May 1863. He was buried in Reading cemetery.<br>
