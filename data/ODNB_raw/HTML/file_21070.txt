<span class="headword">Packe,  Christopher</span>, appointed Lord Packe under the protectorate  (<em>c.</em>1599&#150;1682), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was the son of Thomas Packe of Kettering, Northamptonshire, and his wife, Catherine. He was bound apprentice in the Drapers' Company of London to John Kendrick, a merchant adventurer, who died in 1624 leaving Packe a legacy of &pound;100 and a &pound;300 loan to set up in business in the woollen trade. After gaining his freedom in the Drapers in 1633, Packe was admitted to the livery in 1639; he served on its governing body in 1647&#150;77 and 1679&#150;81 and was master in 1648&#150;9 and 1654&#150;5. He married three times. His first wife was his late master's granddaughter, Jane Newman (<i>d</i>. 1638), daughter of Thomas Newman of Newbury, Berkshire, a merchant and fellow draper. Anne Edmonds (<i>d</i>. 1658), daughter of Simon Edmonds, a London merchant and future alderman, was his second wife. On 13 July 1669 Packe married his third wife, Elizabeth (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1609, <i>d</i>. in or before 1681), daughter of one Richards of Berkshire and widow of Alderman Michael Herring, another prosperous London merchant. With his second wife Packe had two sons and five daughters, two of whom died in infancy; his two other marriages were childless.<br>
<br>Packe acquired considerable wealth in the 1630s by trading in cloth in English and European markets and investing in the Company of Merchant Adventurers and the East India Company. He lived close by Blackwell Hall, the headquarters for the woollen trade, in one of the substantial merchants' houses on Basinghall Street, in St Michael Bassishaw, one of the parishes nestling under the Guildhall. In the 1638 tithe assessment Packe had the fourth highest rating in the parish and he was one of the wealthy merchants in his ward listed in 1640 for a possible forced loan.<br>
<br>By 1640, therefore, Packe was an experienced and successful merchant comfortably established in the heart of the City. He played no noticeable part in London's reaction to the developing political tensions between king and parliament prior to August 1642, when he was appointed by parliament as a collector for money and plate in the ward of Bassishaw. The following December he became a ward assessor for parliamentary levies and in the summer of 1643 contributed &pound;100 towards defending the City. Once his political sympathies were known his financial expertise was soon being drawn upon by parliament. In 1643 he was called upon to advise the committee for the advance of money on raising money to supply the army in the west and he also acted as an intermediary between parliament and the City about raising money to pay the Scots. By 1643 Packe had also become a common councillor for Bassishaw, followed by promotion to ward deputy in 1645&#150;7. He served on more than a dozen common-council committees in 1643&#150;7, including the influential City lands committee in 1646&#150;7. But it was membership of more senior financial committees that increasingly drew on his energy in the 1640s, including committees for the accounts of the whole kingdom, for assessment, for customs, for bishops' lands, and for compounding.<br>
<br>A cautious pragmatism refined on the road to mercantile success may have been the key to Packe's ambiguous reactions to the divisions of presbyterians versus Independents that opened up in the mid-1640s. He would appear to have been a religious presbyterian; he acted as a lay trier for elders in the seventh London classis, was twice delegated to the London provincial assembly, and served on all the common-council committees concerned with setting up a presbyterian church. Furthermore, a leading London presbyterian divine, Dr Thomas Jacombe, was a close friend and was to be a beneficiary under Packe's 1681 will. Yet Packe's political stance was more complex for, although he was appointed to the presbyterian-dominated London militia committee of May 1647, he subsequently adopted a role as mediator between the City, parliament, and the army during the tense summer months and was one of three City representatives sent to reside with the army until the parties reached agreement. As a result, after the army's march on London he was trusted enough to be appointed to the September militia committee with its strong Independent bias. Shortly afterwards Packe joined the aldermanic bench; he was elected for Cripplegate in 1647&#150;53 and for Bassishaw in 1653&#150;60.<br>
<br>Packe was an active supporter of both the Commonwealth and the protectorate and during these years his influence and wealth grew. He attended the special session of the court of aldermen in April 1649 when the pro-royalist Mayor Reynardson was deposed from office, and was one of the fifteen aldermen who attended the formal proclamation of the abolition of monarchy on the following 30 May. The same year saw him elected as one of the London sheriffs and appointed president of the Bridewell and Bethlem hospitals; he also became a member of the indemnity committee. At the beginning of 1649 he had paid over &pound;8000 for the Huntingdonshire manor of Buckden, part of the estates of the bishop of Lincoln, and in March 1650 he was able to add the Leicestershire manors of Prestwold and Cotes. However, there was a big setback too for Packe in 1649 when he and two fellow merchants were removed from the customs committee and ordered to present their accounts. The matter of the accounts was to drag on, and surface acrimoniously on occasion, until the late 1650s.<br>
<br>Although unsuccessful in the City elections of July 1654 for the first protectorate parliament, Packe was shortly afterwards elected lord mayor and subsequently established close relations with Oliver Cromwell as they purged government opponents from City offices. Packe also helped deal with the threat of royalist plots in early 1655 as a member of a new militia committee charged with the task of raising fresh regiments. Among the actions he was responsible for as lord mayor were the arrest and commitment for trial of the Socinian John Biddle in July 1655. Following the end of his mayoralty, Packe was knighted by a grateful Cromwell. Packe's known financial and commercial expertise earned him further responsibilities in 1655 as one of the treasurers for contributions for the relief of Piedmont protestants and as a member both of the admiralty and of the trade committees. He was also appointed to a committee to consider the arguments for the readmission of the Jews, an initiative he was said to have most vehemently opposed. A proposal in January 1656 that he accompany Bulstrode Whitelocke on a mission to Sweden to further a protestant alliance was aborted shortly afterwards.<br>
<br>Packe was finally returned as a City MP in the August 1656 elections to the second protectorate parliament. He was to prove an active member, being nominated to seventy-one committees, with trade, religion, and City affairs being his principal concerns. He developed a particular animosity towards the Quakers at this stage. In the December 1656 debate over what kind of punishment should be inflicted on James Naylor, Packe initially favoured clemency, only to move in support of the motion that the house consider the death sentence when Naylor proved recalcitrant, and in the following May he was to speak out strongly in favour of a bill against Quakers. Packe became governor of the Company of Merchant Adventurers in 1656 and vociferously defended the company's monopoly of the woollen trade at the committee of trade when it later came under attack. Completing his ascension of the mercantile heights, he also joined the governing body of the East India Company in 1657. His greatest claim to fame in 1657, however, was his part in the presentation to the house on 23 February of a new constitution, the &#145;Humble petition and advice&#146;, which provided for a second chamber and held out the possibility of Cromwell's becoming king. Packe was not one of the constitution's authors, only agreeing to act for them in presenting it after Whitelocke had declined to do so, yet during the subsequent constitutional debate he voted in favour of inviting Cromwell to accept the crown. On 10 December 1657 Packe was called to the new second chamber as Lord Packe.<br>
<br>The end of the protectorate, however, was the signal for Packe's enemies to rally against him. The restored Rump considered excluding him from the <span class="roman">Act of Indemnity</span> and initiated an inquiry into any public funds still in his hands. As a result he was forced to return over &pound;10,000 of the money collected for the Piedmont protestants and later a further &pound;22,000 of customs money owed by him and a fellow commissioner was ordered to be repaid. In both cases allegations of corruption were vehemently denied and the blame placed on parliament.<br>
<br>At the Restoration, Packe formally attended the proclamation of the king in London and signed a senior City declaration on 5 June 1660 accepting the royal pardon and pledging obedience. He faced the lesser penalty of exclusion from holding public office for life and accordingly in August 1660 he was removed from the aldermanry and the presidency of the hospitals. Nevertheless, while necessarily maintaining a low profile, he continued to prosper and became one of the creditors of Charles II's government. An attempt in 1666 to procure a baronetcy for his elder son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21071/', "Christopher Packe (b. in or before 1657, d. in or after 1708)")</script>, mysteriously failed after the grant had been issued. After his third marriage in 1669 Packe retired to his manor at Cotes, where he died after a long illness on 27 May 1682. He was buried in the parish church at Prestwold, where his heir erected an impressive monument. His will, made on 10 November 1681 and proved on 26 June 1682, was that of a prosperous merchant who had diversified into land and other properties. The bulk of his estate had already been settled upon his elder son, his three surviving daughters had each received a dowry of &pound;3500 on their marriage, and his younger son, Simon, had been given &pound;1150. Packe's remaining property in London, Huntingdonshire, Leicestershire, and Devon was divided among his children and heading his numerous charitable bequests was &pound;100 for ejected godly ministers and their widows.<br>
