<span class="headword">Fenton,  Richard</span>  (1747&#150;1821), <span class="occ">topographical writer and antiquary</span>, the youngest child of Richard Fenton and his wife, Martha, was born at Rhoson, St David's, Pembrokeshire, and was baptized at St David's Cathedral on 20 February 1747, &#145;being then a month old&#146;. He received his early education at the cathedral school and Haverfordwest grammar school, and apparently entered Magdalen College, Oxford, though there is no record of his matriculation. He did not take a degree but entered the civil service as an officer of the board of customs. Unwisely, he made use of his undoubted ability as a poet to satirize his superior officers and he resigned in 1774. He became a student of the Middle Temple on 24 August 1774 and was called to the bar in January 1783.<br>
<br>In London Fenton enjoyed the life of a sociable, clubbable young gentleman and became friendly with a number of writers and painters, among them Oliver Goldsmith, David Garrick, Samuel Johnson, Sir Richard Colt Hoare, and Sir Joshua Reynolds (who is said to have painted miniatures of Fenton and his wife). He also became a member of Welsh literary and cultural societies, the Cymmrodorion (serving as treasurer for a time) and the Gwyneddigion. He was friendly with the Welsh scholar William Owen Pughe, whom he assisted in editing <span class="italic">The Myvyrian Archaiology of Wales</span> (1801) and whose daughter Elen was to marry Fenton's son John in 1814. Fenton's <span class="italic">Poems</span> (1773, and two volumes 1790) contain witty, Augustan occasional poems addressed to his friends and are a good indication of his life in London and in the country. He did not, however, lose any of his scholarly inclinations and, probably inspired by Colt Hoare, he began to contemplate the idea of researching and writing a history of Wales.<br>
<br>Fenton was then practising as a barrister on the Welsh circuits and was also invited to prepare government reports on social and political conditions in Wales. His legal skills, fluency in French, Latin, and Greek, and an ability to read Welsh, together with his wide reading and extensive cultural background, were indispensable aids to his accumulation of knowledge of Welsh life, cultural history, and topography gained in the course of his tours and professional work. His first intention had been to prepare a new and extended edition of Thomas Pennant's <span class="italic">Tours in Wales</span> (1778, 1781) but the proposed format of the book proved to be unacceptable and the plan was dropped. Aware of the growing interest in county histories in Wales and probably influenced by his friend Theophilus Jones, the historian of Brecknockshire, Fenton took up the idea of writing a history of Wales as a series of county histories and in 1788 he took a house in Machynlleth, Montgomeryshire, which he believed would be a more central location for his tours of the country. His increased affluence after the death of his father and following his marriage to Eloise (Eliza), daughter of Baron and Baroness Pillet de Moudon, about 1782, gave him the means to pursue his scholarly interests. He retired in 1792 to devote all his time to his antiquarian and historical work and to undertake, often with his friend Richard Colt Hoare, a series of tours, especially between 1804 and 1813, of Welsh counties (Caernarvonshire most thoroughly) and of Wiltshire and Somerset. His edition of George Owen's unpublished &#145;Description of Penbrokshire&#146; (1602&#150;3) from a manuscript in his possession&#151;Owen was his great-grandfather&#151;appeared in the <span class="italic">Cambrian Register</span> (1795&#150;6).<br>
<br>In 1796, following the death of Samuel Fenton, his uncle and adoptive father, Fenton moved to Fishguard, Pembrokeshire, where he inherited his uncle's commercial and property interests. He built at considerable cost a new mansion, Plas Glynamel, and developed its gardens and woodlands. <span class="italic">A Historical Tour through Pembrokeshire</span> appeared in 1811, the only county history which he succeeded in completing and publishing. His anonymously published <span class="italic">Tour in Quest of Genealogy through Several Parts of Wales, Somersetshire and Wiltshire by a Barrister</span>, a lightly written account of a tour undertaken with Colt Hoare, also appeared in 1811. In a different vein, his <span class="italic">Memoirs of an Old Wig</span>, a humorous self-deprecating satire of modish society, was published in 1815.<br>
<br>Fenton died at Plas Glynamel in November 1821 and was buried in the same month at Manorowen church, near Fishguard. He was survived by his wife and three sons. A selection from his unpublished tour journals and notes was edited by John Fisher and published in 1917. A fellow of the London Society of Antiquaries, Fenton was an assiduous researcher and antiquary. He built up a large library of books, manuscripts (including the notes of other antiquaries, such as Edward Lhuyd, Thomas Pennant, and William Williams of Llandyg&aacute;i), and records, together with his own transcripts of materials and voluminous personal notes and literary translations. He corresponded with many of the leading Welsh scholars of the day, and toured Wales extensively to visit prehistoric sites, many of which he excavated, and other features in the landscape. His books and journals, more tour literature than history, are entertaining reading, being an attractive mixture of accurate reporting and recording interspersed with personal descriptions of scenery and accounts of oral history, local legends, and substantial alfresco meals. Though he was careful to record his discoveries, his enthusiastic excavating activities have been criticized and he has been described by one reviewer as &#145;an iconoclastic gourmet who went through the land breaking up barrows and cracking cromlechs&#146;  (<span class="italic">Archaeologia Cambrensis</span>, 5th ser., 12, 1895, 159).<br>
