<span class="headword">Gardiner <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Kempe]</span>,  Dorothy</span>  (1873&#150;1957), <span class="occ">writer</span>, was born on 31 August 1873 at 197 Piccadilly, London, the eldest among the six children of Sir John Arrow Kempe (1846&#150;1928), an official in the Treasury, and his wife, Mary Jane, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Edwards (<i>d</i>. 1926). She was the niece of the mathematician <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37628/', "Sir Alfred Bray Kempe (1849&#150;1922)")</script>. She was educated, as were her two younger sisters, at the Francis Holland Church of England School for Girls, London. She excelled in drama and music, and in November 1890 launched and edited a magazine entitled, at her father's suggestion, <span class="italic">Chips and Sparks from Graham Street</span>. Her article &#145;A school of the past&#146; anticipated her later interest in the history of education. She studied at Lady Margaret Hall (LMH), Oxford, from 1895 to 1896 and in 1898, taking a third class in English. She was temporary librarian of LMH from 1899 to 1900 and then travelled widely, visiting a brother in New Zealand. Her first notable publication was a scholarly pamphlet for the Early English Text Society entitled <span class="italic">The Legend of the Holy Grail, its Sources, Character and Development</span> (1905). From 1906 to 1910 she was honorary secretary and editor of the LMH <span class="italic">Brown Book</span> and editorial secretary to the committee of women's work of the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel. Her interest in social work led her to teach at the LMH settlement in Lambeth, of which she was head from 1908 to spring 1911. Her report of 1909 expresses hopes for &#145;a Lambeth that is clean and wholesome and roomy, sober, thrifty and <i>employed</i>&#146;. In 1911 she was a vice-president of the Workers' Educational Association and from 1912 to 1913 she was an assistant inspector in the south-west division of the National Insurance Council. In 1912 she published <span class="italic">A Social History of Sussex</span>.<br>
<br>On 30 December 1913 Dorothy Kempe married Thory Gage Gardiner (1857&#150;1941), rector of Lambeth, who shared her social and educational interests. In 1917 he became a residential canon of Canterbury Cathedral and they moved from Lambeth rectory to 14 The Precincts, Canterbury. There were no children. The verse she had previously published in periodicals was collected under her maiden name in <span class="italic">Mary in the Wood with other Lyric Poems</span> (1917). An editorial note states that &#145;In social work she finds the chief business of her life; in writing, and in Nature, its chief delight&#146;. Dorothy Gardiner also published a number of distinctive guidebooks, including <span class="italic">Canterbury</span> (1923) and <span class="italic">Companion into Kent</span> (1934). Their vivid topographical description is secondary to their thorough account of historical and literary associations, presented in an engaging style.<br>
<br>Gardiner's major work, ten years in preparation, was <span class="italic">English Girlhood at School</span> (1929), a pioneering contribution to women's studies. An ambitious survey of girls' education in England over twelve centuries, Gardiner's study has enjoyed lasting significance for its unrivalled chronicling of the educational opportunities and experiences of girls before the reforms of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Acutely aware of how greatly she had benefited from the improvements in girls' education, Gardiner memorably compared &#145;the long struggle, the hope deferred&#146; that characterized female education in previous centuries with &#145;the fairy-tale&#146; of achieving access to higher education in her own day  (<span class="italic">English Girlhood at School</span>, 484). <span class="italic">The Story of Lambeth Palace</span> (1930), written at the invitation of Archbishop Davidson, was also thoroughly researched. She then edited, with detailed annotation, <span class="italic">The Oxinden Letters, 1607&#150;1662</span> (1933) and <span class="italic">The Oxinden and Peyton Letters, 1642&#150;1667</span> (1937).<br>
<br>In Canterbury Dorothy Gardiner was involved in voluntary work, and was a justice of the peace, chairman of the Canterbury Archaeological Society, a city councillor, and a member of the education committee. Her husband retired in 1937 and died in 1941. Dorothy Gardiner died at her home, Cogan House, 53 St Peter's Street, Canterbury, on 23 January 1957.<br>
