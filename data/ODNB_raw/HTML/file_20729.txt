<span class="headword">Oliver,  Peter <span class="st"> [Pierre]</span></span>  (1589&#150;1647), <span class="occ">miniature painter</span>, was the eldest son of the miniaturist <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20723/', "Isaac Oliver")</script> and his first wife, Elizabeth (<i>b</i>. 1570/71), whom he had possibly met and married in the Low Countries about 1588. She died and was buried, aged twenty-eight, on 6 September 1599. The Olivers were Huguenot refugees from Rouen who settled in Blackfriars, a district of London much favoured by immigrant artists and craftsmen because of its traditional freedom from the restrictions on trade maintained by the City livery companies. Through Isaac Oliver's second marriage, in 1602, to Sara Gheeraerts the Olivers became related to the Gheeraerts dynasty of painters and to the close community of Netherlandish artists working in London. Through his third wife, Elizabeth Harding (<i>b</i>. 1589, <i>d</i>. before 1640), whom Isaac married in 1606 and with whom he had six children, they acquired connections with the Huguenot families of Harding and Lanier, musicians at court, and with the Thames village of Isleworth, Middlesex, in which the Olivers also acquired property. Soon afterwards Peter Oliver also married a Harding, Anne (1593&#150;1672), who was the younger sister of his father's third wife, probably as she reached the age of seventeen, in 1610. Both families continued to live principally in London, Peter Oliver apparently in the north part of the parish of Blackfriars, but they maintained strong connections with Isleworth, where Anne had been born. Ultimately, in his will, Peter would describe himself as a &#145;gentleman of Isleworth&#146;.<br>
<br>Peter Oliver was brought up to the art of miniature by his father, and through the early part of his career his work is virtually indistinguishable from that of Isaac, except by signature. This was doubtless deliberate and a way of maintaining the stylistic integrity of the family studio, which was in effect bequeathed to Peter as a going concern, together with all work in progress. Among the latter was an apparently original composition of the &#145;burial of our Lord and saviour Jesus X, done upon a large table of fine abortive parchment &amp; paisted upon a well seasoned &amp; smooth board, as it is thought of Peartree&#146;  (Cordellier), which had been begun by his father and which he finished (and which is now in the Mus&eacute;e d'Angers).<br>
<br>Peter Oliver also succeeded to his father's place at court, continuing the production of official images of Charles as prince of Wales and as king, and perhaps especially of Princess Elizabeth, wife of the elector palatine and &#145;winter queen&#146; of Bohemia, together with members of her court. Three versions of a miniature portrait of Elizabeth, current <i>c</i>.1623&#150;6, one of which remains in its original enamel locket, are in the Victoria and Albert Museum, London. As a member of the royal household Peter Oliver attended the funeral of Anne of Denmark in 1619 and that of the king in 1625, when he was listed by the lord chamberlain, together with Laurence Hilliard, as an officer of the chamber of the new king, Charles I.<br>
<br>The painting of &#145;histories&#146; now became an increasingly important aspect of Peter Oliver's work, involving especially miniature copies of paintings in the Royal Collection. According to Edward Norgate:<blockquote>Histories in Lymning are strangers to us in England till of late Yeares it pleased a most excellent King to comand the Copieing of some of his owne peeces, of Titian, to be translated into English Lymning, which indeed were admirably performed by his Servant, Mr Peter Oliver. (Norgate, ed. Muller and Murrell, 89)</blockquote>Seventeenth-century European connoisseurs placed a high value on the accurate copying and, hence, comprehension of famous images; compare for example the series of small oil copies by David Teniers after paintings in the collection of Archduke Leopold Wilhelm commissioned in the 1650s for engraving and publication in one of the earliest published catalogues of great paintings, the <span class="italic">Theatrum pictorium</span> (1660; fourteen of these are now in the Courtauld Institute). Peter Oliver was undoubtedly the greatest such copyist working in England.<br>
<br>Technically Peter Oliver was the first regular professional miniaturist to adopt the practice, apparently pioneered by Balthasar Gerbier, of using pre-prepared gessoed leaves from commercial &#145;table books&#146; to support his vellum  (Murdoch, 10). Stylistically his work in portraiture evolved from the firm stipple of his father's studio towards a broader and softer touch, the effect of which was none the less always firm and clear in the delineation of features. In his miniature copies of history paintings, however, the evolution towards softness was much more extreme, especially when the intention was evidently to emulate the <i>sfumato</i> and <i>chiaroscuro</i> of the great north Italian pictures in the Royal Collection. Examples of these histories, made originally for Charles I and dispersed under the Commonwealth, are in the Victoria and Albert Museum, but the most important group, recovered for the Royal Collection after the Restoration, is at Windsor Castle. The most important of Peter Oliver's royal portraits also remain at Windsor. In the light of the increasingly soft focus of his work in miniature it is perhaps significant that he is authoritatively said by Norgate, a cousin, to have taken up the fashionable medium of pastel, which would have been highly suitable for delicate effects of light and shade. Norgate also recorded that he painted landscapes. However, neither pastels nor landscapes are known to survive.<br>
<br>Peter Oliver died at Isleworth and was buried on 22 December 1647 beside his father at the church of St Anne Blackfriars &#145;in the vault with a stone laid over him&#146;. The church, together with the tomb of the Olivers, was destroyed in the great fire of London in 1666. He had no children, and left his estate, including many miniatures by himself and his father, to his widow. She continued to live a solidly respectable life in Isleworth and died soon after her will was made on 27 July 1672. Vertue records the family tale that at the Restoration Charles II visited her, evidently trying to reconstruct what he could of the <i>ante bellum</i> court culture and see what remained of the Oliver inheritance. He chose the miniatures he wanted, offering Anne either &pound;1000 in cash or an annuity of &pound;300 a year. She chose the latter, wrongly, for when she later heard that he had given some of the miniatures to his court ladies she let it be known that she would never have sold them had she known that he would give them to &#145;whores, bastards and strumpets&#146;. The king stopped the annuity. In her will she directed that the remaining miniatures were to be sold.<br>
