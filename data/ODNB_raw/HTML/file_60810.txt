<span class="headword">Uhlman,  Manfred <span class="st"> [Fred]</span></span>  (1901&#150;1985), <span class="occ">writer and painter</span>, was born on 19 January 1901 in Stuttgart, Germany, the first of two children of Ludwig Uhlman (1869&#150;<i>c</i>.1943), textile merchant, and his wife, Johanna Grombacher (1879&#150;<i>c</i>.1943). His father, a descendant of an old-established Jewish family in Stuttgart, and his mother were killed in the concentration camp Theresienstadt. Uhlman grew up in Stuttgart. He studied law in Freiburg, Munich, and T&uuml;bingen, finishing with a doctorate in 1925. In 1927 he started to work as an attorney in Stuttgart. In the same year he joined the local group of the Social Democrat Party of Germany, became its official legal representative in 1932, working with Kurt Schumacher, later the party's president, and campaigned for the party in W&uuml;rttemberg in 1933. In March of that year, after a warning that his arrest was imminent because of his political adherence, he emigrated to Paris. There, unable to work as a lawyer and encouraged by Andr&eacute; Lh&ocirc;te, a French art critic, and Paul Westheim, a German refugee art historian, who had promoted unknown talents in the Weimar republic, Uhlman started to paint successfully in a na&iuml;ve and colourful style, such as in <span class="italic">Au palais des gourmands</span> (1935; priv. coll.). His first exhibition took place at the Galerie Le Niveau, Paris, in 1936. While he was staying in Spain in 1936 the civil war broke out. Uhlman emigrated to Britain, where he began assisting refugees from Nazism, for which he is still remembered. He was supported by <a href="#cosubject_73593">Diana Page Croft [<i>see below</i>]</a>, whom he had met in Spain and married on 4 November 1936. They found guarantors and accommodation for the refugees and even put their own home at the disposal of the photomontagist John Heartfield for six years. In 1938 Uhlman co-founded the only German artistic association of refugees in Britain, the Freier Deutscher Kulturbund, which shortly after its foundation moved into his house in Hampstead, London. At the beginning of July 1940 Uhlman, together with further refugees, was interned at Ascot and then at the Hutchinson camp, Isle of Man, where he met the Dadaist Kurt Schwitters, who portrayed him in a naturalistic way reading (1945; Hatton Gallery, University of Newcastle upon Tyne). During his internment his first child, Caroline, was born. After Uhlman's release in December 1940 he lived with his family in Bambers Green, Essex, where his son Francis was born in 1943; he returned to London in 1944. He continued to paint and had one-man exhibitions, including those at the Leicester Galleries (December 1941) and Redfern Gallery (1943), both in London. After 1945 he became internationally known, exhibiting, for example, at the Graphisches Kabinett, Bremen (1954). He also published his drawings, produced while interned, under the title <span class="italic">Captivity</span> (1946), and <span class="italic">An Artist in North Wales</span> (1947). North Wales inspired him for many of his landscape paintings, such as <span class="italic">North Wales</span> (1958; priv. coll.). From the late 1940s he wrote an autobiography, <span class="italic">The Making of an Englishman</span> (1960), and several novels, which have been translated into twelve languages. The most successful is <span class="italic">Reunion</span> (1971), a book about a German-Jewish childhood in Stuttgart in the early 1930s, which was made into a film by Harold Pinter with the same title in 1989. Although Uhlman was a member of the London Group he never really belonged to the art establishment. He died in the Royal Free Hospital, Hampstead, London, on 11 April 1985, his wife and their two children surviving him, and was buried in Yarpole, Herefordshire. His paintings are in private and public collections, such as the Hereford City Art Gallery and the Ben Uri Gallery, London. The Fred and Diana Uhlman collection of African sculptures was donated to the Hatton Gallery, University of Newcastle upon Tyne.<br>
<br>Uhlman's wife, <a name="cosubject_73593"></a><span class="headword">(Nancy) Diana Joyce Uhlman</span> <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Nancy Diana Joyce  Page Croft]</span>  (1912&#150;1999), <span class="occ">art gallery administrator</span>, was born in South Kensington, London, on 31 March 1912, the second daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32633/', "Henry Page Croft, first Baron Croft (1881&#150;1947)")</script>, politician, and his wife, Nancy Beatrice (<i>d</i>. 1949), daughter of Robert Hudson Borwick, first Baron Borwick. She attended St James's School, West Malvern, and finishing schools in Paris and Florence, and was presented at court. Rebelling against her father's conservatism, in 1936 she greeted the Jarrow marchers on their arrival in London. While holidaying in Spain the same year she met Uhlman. Her father strongly disapproved of their marriage. They helped the republican Spanish cause and she was joint secretary of the Artists' Refugee Committee, which helped artists from Germany and central Europe, including Oskar Kokoschka. From 1947 to 1957 she was secretary and administrator of the Artists' International Association, a Soho gallery which helped the careers of Edward Ardizzone and David Gentleman, among others. In the 1950s she was instrumental in saving the Croft ancestral home, the largely fourteenth-century Croft Castle, Herefordshire, from demolition. She died of cancer at the Wye Valley Nuffield Hospital, Venns Lane, Hereford, on 14 November 1999, and was survived by her son and daughter.<br>
