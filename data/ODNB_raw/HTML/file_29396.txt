<span class="headword">Wilde, Sir  Alfred Thomas</span>  (1819&#150;1878), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, of Kirby Cane Hall, Bungay, third son of Edward Archer Wilde (<i>d</i>. 1871), solicitor, of College Hill, Queen Street, London, and his wife, Marianne, daughter of William Norris, physician, was born on 1 November 1819. He was a brother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29397/', "James Plaisted Wilde, Lord Penzance")</script>, and nephew of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29401/', "Thomas Wilde, Lord Truro")</script>. Educated as a commoner at Winchester School from 1834 to 1837, he obtained a commission as ensign in the East India Company's army on 12 December 1838, and joined the 15th Madras native infantry in April 1839. He was transferred to the 19th Madras native infantry in June, was promoted to lieutenant on 9 July 1842, qualified as interpreter in Hindustani in March 1843, and served with his regiment through the 1843 disturbances on the Malabar coast.<br>
<br>In January 1847 Wilde was appointed adjutant, and in February became quartermaster and interpreter to his regiment. In March 1850 he was transferred to the adjutancy of the 3rd Punjab native infantry, and qualified as interpreter in the Telugu dialect. In April 1851 he was appointed second in command of the 4th Punjab native infantry, and was in field command of the regiment and other troops at the occupation of the Bahadur Khel valley, Kohat district, in November, receiving the thanks of government for defeating a night attack of a body of Wazirs upon the fort of Bahadur Khel. He was promoted to brevet captain on 12 December, took part in the capture of the village of Allah-dad-Khan in 1854, was promoted to captain on 23 November 1856, and was thanked by the government of India for valuable service in the great inundation of the Indus in that year.<br>
<br>In March 1857 Wilde commanded the 4th Punjab native infantry in the successful expedition under Brigadier Neville Chamberlain against the Bozdar Baluchis. His regiment remained loyal, and Wilde was engaged throughout the Indian mutiny. He was at the siege of Delhi, and in the storming parties which captured the Delhi magazine and palace on 16 and 20 September, when he was wounded. He took part in the actions of Gangari, Patial, and Mainpuri in December, and in that of Shamsabad on 27 January 1858. He was promoted to brevet major for his services at Delhi on 19 January, and was thanked by government.<br>
<br>Wilde commanded the 4th Punjabis in the first victorious assault on the entrenchments in front of Lucknow at the siege of that city in March 1858, led a storming party at the capture of the begum's palace on 14 March, and was wounded on 21 March at the attack on Goal Masjid, in the heart of the city. This secured the capture of Lucknow, and in May he went on leave to England to regain his health. He was mentioned in dispatches, promoted to brevet lieutenant-colonel on 20 July, and made CB, military division, on 16 November 1858.<br>
<br>Wilde returned to India in 1859. In March 1860 he commanded his regiment in the expedition against the Mahsud Wazirs, and was thanked for his services. He was promoted regimental major on 18 February 1861, and on 3 March 1862 he was appointed commandant of the corps of guides, and commanded them in the expedition to Ambala against the Sitana and Mandi fanatics in 1863. On 20 July he was promoted colonel in the army, made an aide-de-camp to the queen, and was given command of the 2nd brigade of the Usafzai field force, which harried the villages of Sitana and Mandi. He was promoted regimental lieutenant-colonel on 12 December 1864, and on 8 February 1865 succeeded to the command of the Punjab irregular force with the rank of brigadier-general.<br>
<br>Wilde married, in 1866, Ellen Margaret, third daughter of Colonel Godfrey T. Greene CB, Royal (late Bengal) Engineers; they had at least one daughter and three sons. On 12 June 1866 he was made CSI. In 1868 he commanded the field force in the Hazara Black Mountain expedition, and received the thanks of government for his services. He was made a KCB, military division, on 2 June 1869, and was promoted major-general on 18 July. On his final return from India in 1871 he was awarded a good-service pension. In 1877 he was appointed a member of the Council of India, and promoted lieutenant-general on 1 October 1877. He died at his residence, Donoon House, Clapham Common, London, on 7 February 1878; he was survived by his wife.<br>
