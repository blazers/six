<span class="headword">Spencer,  William Robert</span>  (1770&#150;1834), <span class="occ">poet and humorist</span>, was born in Kensington Palace, London, on 9 January 1770, the younger son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26119/', "Lord Charles Spencer (1740&#150;1820)")</script>, second son of the third duke of Marlborough [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26118/', "Spencer, Charles, third duke of Marlborough")</script>] and the Hon. Mary Beauclerk (<i>d</i>. 1812), daughter of Lord Vere. He was educated at Harrow School before matriculating on 13 October 1786 from Christ Church, Oxford. He did not take a degree, but had an exceptional memory which he proved while at Oxford by betting that &#145;he would learn a whole newspaper by heart, and recite it from beginning to end without displacing one word. He won his bet, but said he was never so bored as while preparing himself for this&#146;  (<span class="italic">Poems</span>, 11).<br>
<br>Spencer's wit and accomplishments made him very popular in London society, and he was a frequent guest of the prince of Wales. At his house in Curzon Street Pitt and Fox met, and among his other friends were R. B. Sheridan, Sydney Smith, and Francis Horner. He sought no prominence in public life, but was content with the reputation of a wit and a writer of <i>vers de soci&eacute;t&eacute;</i>. In 1796 he published a translation of B&uuml;rger's <span class="italic">Leonore</span>, which was highly thought of by Scott and others. Byron said of him that &#145;His was really what your countrymen call an elegant mind, polished, graceful and sentimental&#146;  (Staunton, 344). Wilson, in <span class="italic">Noctes Ambrosianae</span>, has Hogg say, &#145;That chiel's a poet. Thae verses hae muckle o' the auld ballant pathos and simplicity&#146;  (Wilson, 487).<br>
<br>On 13 December 1791 Spencer married Susan, widow of Count Spreti, and daughter of Count Francis Jenison Walworth, chamberlain to the elector palatine. It was rumoured that &#145;the countess was first married to an old man, who, perceiving an attachment gradually increasing between her and young Spencer, destroyed himself that he might not be a bar to their union&#146;  (<span class="italic">Portion of the Journal</span>, 294). This story was said to have suggested Madame de Souza's tale of <span class="italic">Ad&egrave;le de S&eacute;nange</span>, although the husband there dies of apoplexy.<br>
<br>Spencer had five sons and two daughters; his sons included <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26114/', "Aubrey George Spencer (1795&#150;1872)")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26126/', "George Trevor Spencer (1799&#150;1866)")</script>. His large family caused him to give up his briefly held seat in parliament to become a commissioner of stamps from 1797 until 1826. In 1825, owing to financial difficulties, Spencer withdrew to Paris, where Scott on a visit the following year invited him to breakfast. In a state of poverty and ill health he remained in Paris until his death on 22 or 23 October 1834. He was survived by his wife and six children (one son, Charles, having died in 1793), and was buried in Harrow church.<br>
<br>Spencer's work also includes <span class="italic">Urania</span>, a satire on German ghost literature which was performed at Drury Lane in 1802; <span class="italic">The Year of Sorrow</span> (1804); a volume of poems (1811); and a prologue to Miss Berry's play <span class="italic">Fashionable Friends</span> (1802).<br>
