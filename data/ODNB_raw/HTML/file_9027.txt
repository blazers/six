<span class="headword">Exton,  John</span>  (<em>c.</em>1600&#150;1668), <span class="occ">civil lawyer and judge</span>, is of obscure origins. He was admitted a pensioner at Christ's College, Cambridge, in July 1617, and migrated to Trinity Hall, Cambridge, in March 1619. He graduated BA in 1620 and MA in 1623. Exton married on 18 June 1623 Thomasina, daughter and coheir of Ralph Brooke, York herald, of London. He received the degree of LLD in 1634, and was admitted to the court of arches on 31 June 1635. On 13 February 1636 he entered Doctors' Commons, being active as an advocate in London courts 1638&#150;40. In 1647 he served as treasurer of Doctors' Commons.<br>
<br>Exton may have been an admiralty judge as early as 1647, serving with William Clark, and continued by patent from parliament in 1649. He was certainly an admiralty judge in 1651, when together with Clark he was appointed by act of parliament until 1 December 1651, but he was not one of those appointed by the act of 1653. At the Restoration the post was under the nomination of the lord high admiral and went to the pre-war incumbent Robert Zouche, who died almost upon taking office. His successor Thomas Hyde soon followed him to the grave, so on 26 October 1661 Exton was appointed.<br>
<br>Samuel Pepys heard Exton give a charge on 17 March 1663, which he found &#145;somewhat dull, though he [Exton] would seem to intend it to be very rhetorical&#146;  (Pepys, 4.76). Admiralty jurisdiction had been much curtailed by the encroachment of the common law. In 1664 Exton published <span class="italic">The Maritime Dicaeologie, or, Sea-Jurisdiction of England</span>, which made the case for a wider jurisdiction. Although it had little practical effect, it was later reprinted three times in the mid-eighteenth century because it offered a good history of the court.<br>
<br>Exton was buried on 22 October 1668 in St Benet Paul's Wharf, London. His will, with a codicil dated 12 October 1668, gives his residence as St Margaret's, Westminster. He left two-thirds of his estate to his elder son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9028/', "Sir Thomas Exton")</script>, also an admiralty judge, and one-third to his younger son, Everard.<br>
