<span class="headword">Wemyss,  David</span>, fourth earl of Wemyss <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>Lord Elcho]</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1678, <em>d.</em> 1720), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was the eldest son of Margaret, countess of Wemyss and Cromartie (1659&#150;1705), only surviving daughter of <a href="#cosubject_29034">David Wemyss, second earl [<i>see below</i>]</a>, and her first husband, Sir James Wemyss of Caskieberran (<i>d</i>. 1682), who was created a life peer as Lord Burntisland in 1672. He was baptized on 29 April 1678 and was styled Lord Elcho until his mother's death in 1705.<br>
<br>Elcho was descended from a distinguished Fife family, which included Sir David Wemyss, who signed the letter to the pope in 1320 asserting the independence of Scotland, Sir John Wemyss, who assisted in repulsing an attempt by the English to land in Fife in 1547, and Sir John Wemyss (1586&#150;1649), high commissioner to the general assembly, who was created earl of Wemyss, on 25 June 1633.<br>
<br>The first earl of Wemyss's only son, the grandfather of the fourth earl, was <a name="cosubject_29034"></a><span class="headword">David Wemyss</span>, second earl of Wemyss  (1610&#150;1679), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, whose mother was Jean Gray (<i>d</i>. 1640), daughter of Lord Gray. He was born on 6 September 1610. As Lord Elcho, a title he held between 1633 and 1649, he commanded a regiment of Fife infantry in the Scottish army which reached Newcastle upon Tyne in August 1640. On 1 September 1644, at the head of about 6000 men, he was routed by Montrose at Tippermuir, and in August 1645, as supernumerary commander to Lieutenant-General William Baillie, again suffered defeat by Montrose's forces at Kilsyth.<br>
<br>The second earl was married three times: in July 1625 to Anna (<i>d</i>. 1649), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1195/', "Robert Balfour, second Lord Balfour of Burleigh")</script>; in April 1650 to Helenor (<i>d</i>. 1652), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9703/', "John Fleming, second earl of Wigtown")</script>; and on 13 January 1653 to Margaret (<i>d</i>. 1688), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16493/', "John Leslie, sixth earl of Rothes")</script>, and widow of Francis Scott, second earl of Buccleuch. The third marriage produced one daughter, Margaret, the only child to outlive her father. He died in July 1679 at Wemyss Castle, whose estate he had done much to develop.<br>
<br>The fourth earl of Wemyss, in succession to his mother, entered parliament on 28 June 1705, and was the same year sworn of the privy council and named one of the commissioners for the treaty of Union with England. In 1706 he was appointed high admiral of Scotland, and this office having been abolished at the Union, he was then constituted vice-admiral of Scotland, and nominated one of the council of Prince George of Denmark, high admiral of Great Britain. Following the Union he was on 13 February 1707 chosen as one of the sixteen representative Scottish peers; he was re-elected in 1708.<br>
<br>The fourth earl was also married three times. His first wife, Anne (<i>d</i>. 23 Feb 1700), whom he married on 13 August 1697, was the only daughter of William Douglas, first duke of Queensberry. The marriage produced two sons, David, Lord Elcho (<i>d</i>. 1715), and James (1699&#150;1756), who became fifth earl of Wemyss. He remarried on 5 January 1709 at St Martin-in-the-Fields, London. His second wife was Mary (<i>d</i>. 1711/12), daughter of Sir John Robinson and his wife, Mary Dudley. His third wife, whom he married in July 1716, was Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1721), daughter of Henry, Lord Sinclair; they had two daughters: Elisabeth, who married William Sutherland, seventeenth earl of Sutherland, and Margaret, who married James Stewart, eighth earl of Moray.<br>
<br>Wemyss, whom Macky described as &#145;a fine personage and very beautiful&#146;, being a &#145;man of honour&#146; with &#145;good sense&#146;  (<span class="italic">Memoirs of the Secret Services</span>, 250), died at Wemyss Castle on 15 March 1720.<br>
