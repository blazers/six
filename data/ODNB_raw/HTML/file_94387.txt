<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Peel,  John</span> <span class="st"> [<em>real name </em>John Robert Parker Ravenscroft]</span>  (1939&#150;2004), <span class="occ">radio and television broadcaster</span>, was born on 30 August 1939 at Heswall Nursing Home, Heswall, Cheshire, the eldest of three sons of Robert Leslie Ravenscroft and his wife, Joan Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Swainson. His father was a successful cotton merchant and fought in north Africa during the Second World War. Peel wrote, &#145;Father, I decided, probably didn't exist at all, remaining, for the first six years of my life, a figure as remote and improbable as the characters in <span class="italic">The Blue Fairy Book</span>&#146;  (Peel and Ravenscroft, 9). As for his mother, Peel claimed that she was scared of him and told him &#145;that she was never sure what I was for&#146;  (<span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span>, 27 Oct 2004). He listened to radio news bulletins in an air raid shelter at the bottom of the garden during the war and it was his childhood ambition to broadcast for the BBC.<h2>
<a name="Introductiontomusic"></a>Introduction to music</h2>Like many involved in the 1960s counter-culture in Britain, Peel came from a comfortable middle-class background against which he eventually rebelled. From the age of seven he attended Woodlands School, Deganwy, Caernarvonshire, with his brother Francis, until the spring of 1953&#151;the year his parents separated. &#145;I think I regretted the loss of our home in Cheshire more than I regretted the divorce. People came and went, as they do, throughout our childhood, but the house was a constant&#146;  (Peel and Ravenscroft, 189). At thirteen he went to Shrewsbury School, gained four O-levels, and practised an obstinate nonconformity for which he was often beaten. His housemaster, R. H. K. Brooke, wrote in one school report, &#145;perhaps it is possible that John can form some kind of nightmarish career out of his enthusiasm for unlistenable records and his delight in writing long and facetious essays&#146;&#151;an accurate description of Peel's career  (<span class="italic">Sunday Telegraph</span>, 31 Oct 2004). Peel dedicated his posthumously published autobiography to Brooke. One lifelong obsession already in place was football. Peel supported Liverpool Football Club from the age of eleven, and it is said he once pinned a picture of Liverpool footballer Kenny Dalglish on the wall at Radio 1 with the caption &#145;God&#151;a likeness&#146; (or in other versions &#145;God&#151;an informal pose&#146;).<br>
<br>The other obsession started when the young Peel heard Elvis Presley's &#145;Heartbreak Hotel&#146; and Lonnie Donegan's &#145;Rock Island Line&#146; in 1956. Of the latter he said, &#145;It had &hellip; a kind of take-it-or-leave-it spirit that made everything that had gone before sound overcooked and claustrophobic&#146;  (Peel and Ravenscroft, 46). He described hearing Elvis as &#145;the defining moment of my life &hellip; There was something frightening, something lewd, something seriously out of control about &#147;Heartbreak Hotel&#148;, and alarmed though I was by Elvis, I knew I wanted more&#146;  (ibid., 47&#150;8). The effect of this experience remained with him. A few months before he died Peel revealed that he could envisage being a disc jockey at seventy or eighty because &#145;I'm still looking for the next Elvis. The next thing that will seem so astonishing to me that it's almost frightening&#146;  (<span class="italic">Sunday Telegraph</span>, 31 Oct 2004). Peel was soon an enthusiastic attender of concerts by the likes of Gene Vincent and Joe Brown at the Liverpool Empire.<br>
<br>After school Peel did national service in the Royal Artillery as a B2 radar operator (1957&#150;9) and then worked as a mill operative in Rochdale (1959&#150;60). At the behest of his father he was sent to the United States to gain experience for the benefit of the family business. In fact he worked in a variety of jobs there, and eventually broadcast on radio after he phoned a local Dallas station to correct a fact about the Beatles. Thereafter he broadcast as a self-styled Beatles expert throughout his time in America. More than once he &#145;interviewed&#146; George Harrison, as played by himself. One happy consequence was that:<blockquote>I was suddenly confronted by this succession of teenage girls who didn't want to know anything about me at all. All they wanted me to do was to abuse them, sexually, which of course I was only too happy to do. (<span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span>, 27 Oct 2004)</blockquote>For a time Peel had a steady girlfriend in Nancy Bowling, a seventeen-year-old student at Bryan Adams School, Dallas, whom he described as the girl (second only to his later wife, Sheila) he had loved most. Perhaps memories of this relationship explain Peel's legendary passion for the Undertones' song &#145;Teenage Kicks&#146; (1978), a record guaranteed to make him cry. It is not obvious why a raucous punk song with distorted guitars would induce tears&#151;unless it had become associated with an intense memory such as his relationship with Nancy in Dallas. Peel said he wanted the words &#145;Teenage dreams, so hard to beat&#146; from the lyrics on his gravestone. In Dallas Peel had what he called his &#145;brush with history&#146;. He exchanged a few words with John F. Kennedy and took several photographs when Kennedy drove through Dallas in 1960. When Kennedy was assassinated in 1963 Peel pretended to be a reporter from the <span class="italic">Liverpool Echo</span> to gain access first to Dealey Plaza, and later to a news conference, where he found himself next to Jack Ruby who within forty-eight hours would shoot Lee Harvey Oswald. Peel was a disc jockey at KOMA radio in Oklahoma and then KMEM radio in San Bernadino, California, for eighteen months apiece. In 1965, while in the USA, he married a fifteen-year old Texan, Shirley Anne Milburn, who had lied about her age and had been assisted in this deception by her family. Two years later Peel returned to Britain with his young wife. They lived in Fulham for a time before the relationship broke down, a divorce being granted in 1973.<h2>
<a name="Radio1"></a>Radio 1</h2>Peel's broadcasting career took off in 1967 when he joined Radio London, a pirate radio station anchored off Felixstowe, for six months. His show, <span class="italic">The Perfumed Garden</span>, broadcast from midnight to 2 a.m. In the United States he had broadcast under his birth name (or as Ravencroft while in California); at Radio London he became John Peel on the suggestion of a secretary at the station. Mindful of the <span class="roman">Marine Offences Act</span>, which would outlaw such pirate stations, he wrote to the BBC in July about their plans for a new pop music station. Of the twenty disc jockeys who turned up for work in August 1967 at Radio 1 only Peel was to last into the 1990s. Something of the pirate station ethos never entirely left him. As Billy Bragg put it, &#145;Although he became an institution at the BBC, he was, in effect, running his own pirate radio station from within the corporation&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Guardian</span>, 27 Oct 2004). He took over the Radio 1 show <span class="italic">Top Gear</span> in February 1968 with the producer John Walters.<br>
<br>In these years Peel wholeheartedly embraced the idealism of the hippy counter-culture, with the exception of drug taking. He was not a smoker, and took LSD once by choice. A second encounter with LSD came involuntarily when his drink was spiked. His biography notes, &#145;for three or four days he was incapable even of writing his own name &hellip; he described [taking LSD] as like visiting Stratford-upon-Avon: having done it once he felt no pressing need to do it again&#146;  (Peel and Ravenscroft, 173). <span class="italic">Top Gear</span>'s low-key theme tune, Grinderswitch's &#145;Picking the Blues&#146;, would be followed by a list of bands to be featured, a list that sometimes included a silly made-up name. As the names of many of the actual groups were just as unlikely the impostor was hard to spot. Peel promoted the &#145;underground&#146; bands whose music scorned commercial success. His time in America had given him first-hand knowledge of groups like Captain Beefheart, the Doors, Jefferson Airplane, and the Grateful Dead. He also featured the Incredible String Band, Soft Machine, King Crimson, Fairport Convention, and Steeleye Span, as well as comic acts like the Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band, and spoken poetry. He was allegedly the first person to play tracks by Leonard Cohen and Jimi Hendrix on the BBC. In the early 1970s he championed the art-glam band Roxy Music and the reggae of Bob Marley and the Wailers. He played Mike Oldfield's <span class="italic">Tubular Bells</span> in its entirety, the success of which helped launch Richard Branson's Virgin record label. Little of the music he played between 1967 and 1975 stayed with him in later life.<br>
<br>Eschewing the hyperventilated babble of daytime popular radio, Peel talked about music in a laconic manner, with a dry wit and self-deprecating jokes. Simply by not talking over the records, which was unusual, he implied that music mattered. Listeners got the impression that he was speaking to them, not at them, and no matter what his age Peel seemed a voice for disenfranchised youth. His audience was modest in number but loyal and perpetually renewed itself. As his fellow Radio 1 broadcaster Andy Kershaw put it, &#145;he spanned generations because he remained a fan himself. Frankly, at times the music was unlistenable to, but that wasn't the point&#151;you listened to Peel for Peel&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Guardian</span>, 13 Nov 2004). Robert Hanks described Peel's style as &#145;an extensive education in modesty, kindness and gentle sarcasm&#146;, which demonstrated that &#145;an appreciation of the music of rebellion and hate doesn't necessarily preclude grace of manner and tolerance&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Independent</span>, 27 Oct 2004). Peel broke many of the rules of broadcasting. At Radio 1 he was the first disc jockey to play a record twice in a row. He got into hot water by admitting on air in the 1969 discussion show <span class="italic">Night Ride</span> that he had once been to a VD clinic. This led to a row in which the BBC had to apologize to the prime minister, Harold Wilson.<br>
<br>A key personal and professional relationship for Peel from the late 1960s was with the guitarist&#150;singer Marc Bolan. Peel wrote in the music paper <span class="italic">Sounds</span> not long after Bolan was killed in 1977, &#145;In the late 1960s Marc and June Child were as good friends as the Pig [Peel's name for his wife, Sheila] and I had.&#146; He insisted that Bolan's acoustic duo Tyrannosaurus Rex accompany him to gigs where he was the disc jockey, and played their records despite complaints from listeners and the controller of Radio 1, who told him to stop because Bolan's bleating vibrato sounded like Larry the Lamb. He read two of Bolan's fey children's stories on the Tyrannosaurus Rex albums. Peel was overjoyed when Bolan, having gone electric and now leader of a four-piece group, scored a number one hit as T. Rex with &#145;Hot Love&#146; in March 1971. However, their relationship fractured that summer when Peel decided not to play the follow-up &#145;Get It On&#146; on his show. It was an early example of Peel's tendency to move on once bands reached a certain level of success. Bolan took offence as only someone who is struck by the first secure glow of fame can. The friendship between the two and their wives was extinguished, sharpening Peel's awareness of how success often changed people. He disliked pretension, and became a celebrity who didn't want to behave like one, who wanted to hang on to ordinariness. A happier experience was his participation at the edge of the alcohol-fuelled camaraderie of Rod Stewart's group the Faces. In 1971 the band arranged for Peel to mime playing mandolin for &#145;Maggie May&#146; on <span class="italic">Top of the Pops</span>. He sometimes said that it was the Faces who re-energized him after the laid-back hippy years.<br>
<br>For years Peel travelled across Britain as a disc jockey on the college circuit, and was often disc jockey or comp&egrave;re at rock festivals, including the long-running ones at Reading and Glastonbury. He once quipped that rock festivals were &#145;the post-war generation's substitute for National Service&#146;  (Peel and Ravenscroft, 57). Later he developed a fear of crowds after being present at the Heysel stadium football disaster in 1985. Peel's idealism also led him to try his hand at running a record label called Dandelion from 1969. The duo Medicine Head gave the label its sole top thirty single with &#145;Pictures in the Sky&#146; in the jugband boogie style of groups like Mungo Jerry and Canned Heat. The label signed singer&#150;songwriters such as Clifford T. Ward, Bridget St John, and Kevin Coyne, released twenty-six albums (later highly collectable), but closed in the early 1970s with debts.<h2>
<a name="NewwaveandRadio4"></a>New wave and Radio 4</h2>In November 1968 Peel met his second wife, Sheila Mary Gilhooly, a teacher and the daughter of Denis Gilhooly of Shipley, Yorkshire. The couple married on 31 August 1974 at Islington register office and had two sons and two daughters. For thirty-three years they lived in a seventeenth-century thatched cottage, nicknamed &#145;Peel Acres&#146;, at Great Finborough, near Stowmarket, Suffolk. He once said: &#145;It seems almost the most perfect life. I could be taller and have more hair, but that apart I cannot imagine how my life could be improved.&#146; As for his job, &#145;You get free records, you get paid for playing them on the radio, I choose all the music for my own programmes&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Guardian</span>, 27 Oct 2004).<br>
<br>Peel was the only disc jockey able to encourage much of his audience across the ideological divide in British popular music that opened in 1975&#150;6. Those who declined switched to his fellow disc jockey Bob Harris. The catalyst for this change in <span class="italic">Top Gear</span>'s programming came in 1976 when Peel was excited by the Ramones' d&eacute;but. He abandoned progressive rock and embraced the punk or new wave of the Sex Pistols, the Clash, Elvis Costello, the Fall, Joy Division, and the Undertones, for whom he provided the first radio play of &#145;Teenage Kicks&#146; in 1978. They were signed the day after. In the 1980s he promoted such groups as the Smiths, the Cure, New Order, Pulp, and the Jesus and Mary Chain. In the 1980s Peel became an unlikely co-presenter on BBC television's <span class="italic">Top of the Pops</span> chart show. He always looked as out of place as an undertaker at a wedding. Most of the fun of watching was to catch the witty barbs Peel sneaked through the programme's inanity and tinsel. On one occasion he expressed his disapproval of bands who performed in apartheid-era South Africa by introducing Queen as &#145;the boys from Sun City&#146;. Contrary to all expectation, and with the support of his producer John Walters, Peel survived periodic culls of presenters at Radio 1, his tenure at the station lasting thirty-seven years. In the 1990s his show played post-punk, jungle, Madchester bands, Brit pop, hip hop, Chicago house, Detroit techno, ambient electronica, death metal, and alternative country music. He was magnetically drawn to anything that was outside the mainstream. His fondness for obscure music was a pursuit that carried with it self-renewal; he was always catching trends early.<br>
<br>In later years Peel lent his unmistakable voice to television commercials and documentaries. In the early 1990s he wrote a column for the <span class="italic">Radio Times</span>, &#145;John Peel's family album&#146;, which eventually led in 1998 to the successful <span class="italic">Home Truths</span> programme on Radio 4, where he connected with a maturer audience. Sentimental in a typically British understated way, idiosyncratic, often moving, and wide-ranging, <span class="italic">Home Truths</span> was built around droll accounts of domesticity (including his own) and a celebration of the ordinary. The rebel became an unlikely hero of middle England. <span class="italic">Home Truths</span>, which drew a million listeners, won four Sony awards in 1999, but for Peel it was more like work than his music show. In 1989 he was interviewed on <span class="italic">Desert Island Discs</span> and on ITV's <span class="italic">This Is Your Life</span>. A decade later the BBC marked his sixtieth birthday by having a &#145;John Peel night&#146;. He received a broadcaster of the year citation in 1993, a &#145;godlike genius&#146; award from the <span class="italic">New Musical Express</span> in 1994, and was voted top disc jockey by <span class="italic">Melody Maker</span> readers eleven times. In 2002 he was awarded the Sony gold award for his outstanding contribution to broadcasting. Among his seven honorary degrees were an MA from the University of East Anglia (1989) and a DMus from Anglia Polytechnic (1999). He was appointed OBE in 1998.<br>
<br>Outside music Peel was fond of Anthony Powell's novel sequence <span class="italic">A Dance to the Music of Time</span> and the books of W. E. Johns. His self-effacing humour was illustrated by his entry under recreations in <span class="italic">Who's Who</span>: &#145;making plans to go and live in France, staring out of the window&#146;. He had a good ear for the potential comedy of verbal and written clich&eacute;s, which informed his broadcasting. Describing a school football match during which he scored two match-winning goals, he wrote, &#145;I can close my eyes and see the heavy, sodden leather ball arcing away from my heavy, sodden leather right boot and beyond what sports writers call &#147;the goalkeeper's despairing grasp&#148;&#146;  (Peel and Ravenscroft, 53).<br>
<br>In his last years Peel struggled with weight problems and he was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes in September 2001. He maintained a demanding schedule, writing the early parts of his autobiography, listening to demonstration tapes, and commuting between Suffolk and London each week. He was unhappy when his radio show was moved from 10 p.m.&#150;midnight to 11 p.m.&#150;1 a.m. and told Andy Kershaw that this timetabling was &#145;killing&#146; him. His last Radio 1 show was broadcast on 14 October 2004. Six weeks before his death he was interviewed by <span class="italic">Insight</span>, an alumni magazine of the University of Liverpool. He admitted that his greatest fear was of death:<blockquote>The fact of it and the manner of it, really. I'm one of those people who lives their life in sort of imaginary newspaper headlines. So, whenever a car goes past our house that I can't identify, because we live in quite a remote part of Suffolk, I immediately think in terms of: &#145;Torture Slaying Of Village Couple&#146;.</blockquote>He said he wanted to be remembered &#145;as quite a good Dad&#146;  (<span class="italic">Sunday Telegraph</span>, 31 Oct 2004).<br>
<br>Peel and his wife were nearing the end of a three-week holiday in Peru when he died of a heart attack on 25 October 2004 in the Inca city of Cuzco. They were having a pre-dinner drink at the lobby bar of the Hotel Monasterio. Ironically, half an hour before he died, Peel was recalling his long-time producer John Walters (who died in 2001), saying &#145;I wish I'd spent more time with him before he died&#146;  (Peel and Ravenscroft, 253). There was a history of early mortality in the Ravenscroft family (his father had died when Peel was twenty-eight). When his death was announced the BBC received over 30,000 calls and emails in a single day from all over the world. On 13 November a service was held at Bury St Edmunds Cathedral, with about 2000 members of the public outside, followed by a private funeral. He was buried in the graveyard of St Andrew's Church, Great Finborough, and was survived by his wife, Sheila, and their four children.<br>
<br>Peel had the irreverent, glum, unmalicious rebelliousness of a talented but misunderstood teenager. John Walters once said &#145;We are in real trouble if Peel ever hits puberty.&#146; Uninterested in moving beyond a fan's simple enthusiasm for the music that consumed most of his life, Peel was addicted to novelty and the next exciting new thing. While it is true that he gave airtime to a vast number of singers and bands who would not otherwise have been heard, the majority had only wafer-thin talent. The dust jacket of a biography cites his &#145;unstinting championing of musical talent&#146;, but &#145;unstinting sympathy for people who <i>thought</i> they had musical talent&#146; would be more accurate. He helped popularize a &#145;garage&#146; aesthetic in which the rougher the performance and the further from mainstream musical norms, the more &#145;authentic&#146; the music. Peel estimated that he received about 400 demonstration tapes a week:<blockquote>Disposing of these demos is just about the most depressing aspect of what we'll laughingly call &#145;my work&#146; &hellip; Last night &hellip; I was moodily carrying boxes of CDs&#151;most heard, some unheard, all at least a year old&#151;to the skip in the driveway. Amongst these are letters from and photographs of the bands. It's when you look at these that the enormity of what you're doing hits you. (Peel and Ravenscroft, 129)</blockquote>
<span class="italic">Top Gear</span> itself was a programme more acknowledged than listened to. The story that Peel once listened to the BBC's electronic buzzing test-tone and commented &#145;that sounds like something I might play on my show&#146; accurately captures how many viewed the programme, even if it is apocryphal. His death prompted much affection and some overstatement. It was an exaggeration to say, as Feargal Sharkey of the Undertones did, that Peel was &#145;the single most important broadcaster we have ever known&#146;, since there is more to broadcasting than popular music. Nor could <span class="italic">The Independent</span>'s &#145;He was the most important person in British music since the birth of rock'n'roll&#146; be true of a disc jockey. One dissenting voice among the eulogies was Kevin Myers, who wrote in <span class="italic">The Independent</span> that &#145;Only that bizarre [British] tradition of collecting meaningless things could elevate to national celebrity someone who dedicated his entire life &hellip; to trawling through thousands of hours of anguished youthful vacuity, shouted and set to drums.&#146;<br>
<br>John Peel's legacy of a life in music included an estimated 40,000 albums on vinyl and CD, as well as singles and tapes, a range of BBC Peel sessions (some commercially released), many amateur off-air recordings boxed in attics up and down the country, and thousands of letters from the musicians themselves. His uncollected columns and articles appeared in a variety of publications including <span class="italic">Oz</span>, music papers like <span class="italic">Disc</span> and <span class="italic">Sounds</span>, <span class="italic">Punch</span>, <span class="italic">Radio Times</span>, newspapers, even a piece on the Isle of Man (TT) race for a motorcycling magazine. His trip to Peru was to be the basis for a travel article in the <span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span>. He left personal diaries from 1967 to 1983 and was said to have been advanced &pound;1.6 million for an autobiography. A section of this&#151;Peel's life to the mid-1960s&#151;together with a biography written by his wife, Sheila, was published in 2005 as <span class="italic">Margrave of the Marshes</span>.<br>
