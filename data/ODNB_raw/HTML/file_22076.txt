<span class="headword">Peverel,  William</span>  (<em>b. </em><em>c.</em>1090, <em>d.</em> after 1155), <span class="occ">baron</span>, was the son of a father of the same name, an important Domesday tenant-in-chief in the north midlands, and Adeline. His father, who had custody of Nottingham Castle from 1068, and of the Castle of the Peak in Derbyshire (later named Peveril Castle), died on 28 January 1114; his mother was still alive in 1130. Their children were William, Adelise (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1080), who married Richard de Revi&egrave;res, and Matilda. Peverel witnessed <i>c</i>.1109 his father's foundation charter for the Cluniac priory at Lenton, near Nottingham, and some royal charters in the 1120s. He was twice married, first, <i>c</i>.1115, to Oddona, and second, <i>c</i>.1145, to Avice, daughter of William of Lancaster. William of Lancaster was one of the honorial barons of the honour of Lancaster, then controlled by Ranulf (II) of Chester. With Oddona, Peverel had a son William (described as his heir in a charter for Garendon Abbey), who predeceased him, a son Henry, who may also have predeceased him, and a daughter, Margaret, who married Robert de Ferrers, earl of Derby.<br>
<br>Peverel, like his father, served as a royal agent under Henry I, particularly in forest matters, though he was less frequently at court. At Northampton in September 1131, if not earlier, he would have sworn to accept the succession of the empress; but he attached himself to Stephen on his accession, and witnessed his charter of liberties of April 1136. He took a prominent part in the civil war of Stephen's reign, and ultimately suffered forfeiture for backing the wrong side. He fought for Stephen at the battle of the Standard in August 1138 and at the battle of Lincoln in February 1141, when he was captured. He thereby lost control of Nottingham Castle, which was given to Ralph Paynel, who had instigated an attack on it by Robert of Gloucester in the previous year. About this time Robert de Ferrers took the title of earl of Nottingham. In 1142 Peverel's knights recaptured the castle and town of Nottingham, and expelled from it &#145;all who were in favour of the empress&#146;  (Symeon of Durham, 2.312). These events were not forgotten when the civil war drew to its close. When Duke Henry landed in England in 1153 he granted Ranulf (II), earl of Chester, the lands of William Peverel, &#145;unless in my court he is able to clear himself of charges of wickedness and treason&#146;  (<span class="italic">Reg. RAN</span>, 3, no. 180). The reference is to the charge that Peverel had earlier attempted to poison Ranulf of Chester while a guest in his house. When Ranulf did die later in the year, the story was not forgotten.<br>
<br>Nottingham Castle had been burnt in the summer of 1153, and it may be presumed that William Peverel lost control at that time, for no security in respect of it was asked for in the peace settlement later in the year. Peverel's lands were forfeit in February 1155 when Henry, by now king, marched against him. Peverel, who had earlier taken the cowl in one of his religious houses, probably Lenton Priory, fled the area, and was not heard of again. &#145;The lands of William Peverel&#146; were accounted for separately in the pipe rolls throughout Henry II's reign.<br>
