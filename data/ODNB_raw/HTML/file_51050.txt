<span class="headword">Godfree <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>McKane]</span>,  Kathleen <span class="st"> [Kitty]</span></span>  (1896&#150;1992), <span class="occ">tennis player</span>, was born in Kensington, London, on 7 May 1896, the younger child of John McKane, pianoforte dealer, and his wife, May. She was educated first at home and later at St Paul's Girls' School, London, and St Leonard's School in St Andrews, where she learned to play tennis. She excelled at several sports. At nine she cycled from London to Berlin as part of a family outing; at ten she was awarded the National Skating Association's bronze medal; and in 1918 she was selected for the English lacrosse team to play Scotland, although the match was cancelled because of the war situation. During that war she worked first as a clerk and then as a War Office driver. In the winter of 1919&#150;20 she took up badminton and won the All-England singles title, which she retained for two further seasons and won again in 1924.<br>
<br>As a tennis player Kitty McKane joined the Kew club and made her Wimbledon d&eacute;but in 1919, when the championships were still being held at Worple Road. She reached the quarter-finals, where she lost to Suzanne Lenglen (the eventual winner). That year she won her first international title, the covered court women's doubles, with Mrs Beamish in Paris. In 1920 at the Antwerp Olympics she was a gold medallist in the women's doubles and silver medallist in the mixed doubles, with Winifred McNair and Max Woosnam respectively. She also gained a bronze medal in the women's singles, a feat that she repeated at the Paris Olympics of 1924, the last games to feature tennis until it was revived in Seoul in 1988, where Godfree attended as representative of the All-England Club. At Paris she also won a silver medal in the women's doubles, thus establishing a record for the most Olympic tennis medals won by any player.<br>
<br>A tiny figure on court, McKane usually wore a calf-length white frock and white stockings, with her hair tied back in a silk bandeau. Fast on her feet, she developed an all-court game but preferred to attack, often using the volley as her major weapon. Her skill and tenacity, combined with a composed and placid temperament, took her to three Wimbledon ladies' finals. In 1923 she lost to Suzanne Lenglen, but she won against Helen Wills in 1924, revenge for her defeat by the seventeen-year-old American in the first Wightman cup match the previous year. She was the first British winner of the ladies' event since Mrs Lambert Chambers in 1914. In 1925 she was the losing finalist in the United States championships but won the mixed doubles with J. B. Hawkes; she also lost in the finals of the French singles and women's doubles. In January 1926 she married Leslie Allison Godfree, a solicitor who had been the first player to serve on Wimbledon's centre court after it moved to Church Road in 1922. Together they won the mixed doubles at Wimbledon in 1926, the only husband-and-wife team to do so, thus regaining the title that she had previously won with Jack Gilbert in 1924. In 1926 she also recaptured the Wimbledon ladies' singles title after a final against Lili Alvarez, by changing her tactics and abandoning attack for a match of attrition in which the Spaniard tired first.<br>
<br>Kitty Godfree's last major title was the women's doubles in the American championships in 1927. She wrote two instruction books, <span class="italic">Lawn Tennis: how to Improve your Game</span> in 1923 and <span class="italic">Lawn Tennis Simplified</span> in 1928, the year before she retired temporarily from tennis to have her first child, David. Her second son, Martin, was born in 1937. She played in the Wightman cup from its inauguration in 1923 through to 1927 and again in 1930 and 1934, but never again was a prominent singles player. She reached the semi-final of the women's doubles at Wimbledon in 1934, the last of the 147 matches that she played in the championships.<br>
<br>Kitty Godfree continued to play competitive tennis into her tenth decade, including an annual mixed doubles match for the International Club of Great Britain against its Parisian counterpart, in which she usually faced Jean Borotra. They last played against each other in 1988, sixty-four years after they had both won their first Wimbledon singles titles. She died on 19 June 1992 of a chest infection, at Viera Gray House, a nursing home at 27 Ferry Road, Barnes, London. She was survived by her two sons, her husband having predeceased her.<br>
