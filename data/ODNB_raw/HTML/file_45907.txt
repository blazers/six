<span class="headword">Champion,  Henry Hyde</span>  (1859&#150;1928), <span class="occ">socialist and journalist</span>, was born on 22 January 1859 in Poona, India, the son of Major-General James Hyde Champion and his wife, Henrietta Susan, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Urquhart. He was sent to England to be educated at Marlborough College before entering the Royal Military Academy at Woolwich. He was commissioned as a lieutenant in the Royal Artillery in 1878 and served in the Second Anglo-Afghan War before resigning his commission in September 1882 as a protest against the Egyptian campaign. On 9 August 1883 he married Juliet Bennett (<i>d</i>. 17 March 1886). After reading the work of Henry George, Karl Marx, and others, Champion embraced the socialist cause, to which he devoted his fortune and his many talents.<br>
<br>In 1883 Champion aligned himself with Henry Mayers Hyndman and the Democratic Federation (later the Social Democratic Federation or SDF). He served as the SDF's first secretary and invested &pound;2000 in the Modern Press, which published <span class="italic">Justice</span>, the federation's mouthpiece. Having edited the <span class="italic">Christian Socialist</span> (1882&#150;4) and <span class="italic">To-Day</span> (1884), Champion was ideally suited to edit <span class="italic">Justice</span>, which soon became a respected and influential socialist weekly. A major figure in the early history of the federation, Champion also played an important role in establishing and maintaining the dynamism of the Clerkenwell branch of the SDF. His reputation, however, was jeopardized in the &#145;tory gold scandal&#146; of 1885, when he helped secure Conservative Party financial support for SDF candidates in the general election. On 8 February 1886, along with other SDF leaders, he participated in the demonstration of the unemployed in Trafalgar Square (for which he was arrested on charges of sedition and later acquitted) and managed in part to redeem his reputation.<br>
<br>By 1887 Champion had become disillusioned by Hyndman and the SDF, suggesting that the organization's abstract theory had converted few workers to the cause. In May he established a new monthly, <span class="italic">Common Sense</span>, in which he attacked Hyndman and suggested the need for a party that would appeal directly to workers' interests. He was expelled from the SDF in November 1888 and turned to the Labour Electoral Association in order to promote independent labour politics. Writing for a working-class readership in the <span class="italic">Labour Elector</span>, which he edited between 1888 and 1891, Champion argued in favour of immediate, practical reforms, particularly the eight-hour day. During the London Dock strike of 1889 he advised strikers on tactics and did much to secure sympathetic press coverage of the dispute.<br>
<br>Champion devoted his energy in the early 1890s to the cause of independent labour representation, and stood unsuccessfully for Aberdeen South in the general election of 1892. Although ill health prevented him from attending the conference that gave birth to the Independent Labour Party in 1893, Champion worked behind the scenes in shaping the new party. Nevertheless, many Independent Labour Party members remained suspicious of his background and tory financial connections, especially after he offered to fund the electoral campaigns of Labour candidates. By 1894 Champion's reputation was tarnished, and by choosing to emigrate to Australia, leaving behind few admirers, he ensured that the role he played in the formative days of the Independent Labour Party would soon be forgotten.<br>
<br>Champion settled in Melbourne, where he continued to promote socialist causes. Influenced by his second wife, Elsie Belle Goldstein (<i>d</i>. 1953), whom he married on 8 December 1898 and who was the younger sister of the noted Australian suffragist Vida Goldstein, he campaigned on behalf of women's suffrage. He also established the Australasian Authors' Agency in 1906 and published the work of aspiring Australian novelists. He suffered a stroke in 1901, was declared bankrupt in 1922, and died in South Yarra, Victoria, on 30 April 1928.<br>
<br>Although largely forgotten, Champion played a major role in the development of socialist thought and institutions in Britain. His many pamphlets, along with the articles he wrote between 1888 and 1892 for the <span class="italic">Nineteenth Century</span> (which he briefly edited), are evidence of his intellectual rigour, while his organizational and speaking skills were noted by many of his contemporaries. Nevertheless, his aristocratic demeanour and impetuous behaviour (he had an acerbic wit and temperamental personality), along with his dubious financial connections and his distrust of working-class ties to the Liberal Party, alienated many of his potential followers.<br>
