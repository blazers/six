<span class="headword">Masters,  Robert</span>  (1713&#150;1798), <span class="occ">historian</span>, was born on Christmas day 1713 at Hetherset, Norfolk, son of William Masters (1681&#150;1759) and his wife, Anne Fish (<i>d</i>. 1758) of Hetherset, and was descended from the royalist Sir William Masters. His parents had two other sons, who died in infancy, and a daughter. Nothing is known of his schooling; he entered Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, as a sizar in 1731, and proceeded BA in 1735, MA in 1738, and BD in 1746. He was ordained priest at Ely in September 1738, the same year that he was elected into a fellowship of his college. There he remained for twenty years, filling at times the offices of dean, bursar, and tutor; his pupils remembered his plain-speaking. In 1752 he was presented to the vicarage of St Benet, Cambridge, and he eventually became a rural parish priest in Corpus livings at Landbeach from 1756 to 1797 and Waterbeach from 1759 to 1784. Masters married at Landbeach on 12 August 1757 Constance Cory (<i>c</i>.1730&#150;1764), daughter of John Cory, vicar of Impington and Waterbeach in Cambridgeshire. She died on 29 August 1764 leaving a son, William, and three daughters: Anne, who married the Revd Andrew Sprole, Mary, who married the Revd Thomas Cooke Burroughes, and Constance, who died young.<br>
<br>Although Masters published a timely sermon entitled <span class="italic">The Mischiefs of Faction and Rebellion Considered</span>, delivered in October 1745 when a Jacobite invasion from Scotland was expected daily, his real passion was the past. He belonged to a small and intimate group of antiquaries whom William Cole dubbed the Benedictines because of their association with Benet (Corpus Christi) College. Cole, who acted very uncomfortably as Masters's curate at Waterbeach for two years, admitted that much of what he recorded about him was &#145;wrote with too much acrimony&#146;, and as a witness he is not always to be relied on. Both were strong-minded and liked their own way. That Masters had a rough edge and did not court popularity is, however, evident; his attempt to have his son elected a fellow of Corpus failed, he was embroiled in a controversy with the young architect James Essex in 1748 and appears to have been in the wrong, and he later engaged successfully in litigation about his parochial rights to tithes. Masters contributed a few papers to <span class="italic">Archaeologia</span>, the journal of the Society of Antiquaries, to which he was elected in May 1752. The first of them, a scholar's remarks on Horace Walpole's <span class="italic">Historic Doubts</span> on Richard III  (<span class="italic">Archaeologia</span>, 2, 1771, 198), only confirmed the dislike that Walpole had been taught by Cole and alienated him from the society. Masters also wrote on stone coffins and skeletons discovered at Cambridge Castle  (ibid., 8, 1785, 63), and on a stained-glass pedigree of the Stewart family  (ibid., 8, 1786, 321). He compiled <span class="italic">Memoirs of the Life and Writings of the Late Rev. Thomas Baker</span>, the nonjuror of St John's College, using materials of Zachary Grey to which he appended a catalogue of manuscripts (1784) and a <span class="italic">Catalogue of the several pictures in the public library and respective colleges in the University of Cambridge</span> (1790).<br>
<br>Of greater value than such works was Masters's first major book, which attracted favourable attention and proved durable. In 1749 he printed a biographical list of the alumni of Corpus, and was led to compile a large <span class="italic">History of the College of Corpus Christi</span> (in two parts, 1753&#150;5) which is the first published account of its kind of any college at Oxford or Cambridge. He had permission to inspect the archives and printed what by the standards of the time are well-edited documents together with a narrative history in which biographical material predominated. His interleaved and extra-illustrated copy at Corpus shows a painstaking concern. John Lamb, master of the college, continued and revised the history, bringing it down to 1831. The second pioneering historical work that Masters undertook came at the end of his life when he issued in an edition of only twenty-five copies <span class="italic">A Short Account of the Parish of Waterbeach</span> (1795) &#145;by a late vicar&#146;, which is the first separate Cambridgeshire parish history. It allowed him to settle an old score with Bishop Yorke of Ely and remains of interest for its evidence about the agriculture of a fenland parish on the eve of enclosure.<br>
<br>In typical eighteenth-century fashion, Masters resigned the living of Waterbeach in favour of his son William who, however, predeceased him, dying in 1794, and the Landbeach parish to his son-in-law, Thomas Burroughes, with whom he lived until his death at Landbeach on 5 July 1798. He was buried in Landbeach church. His considerable library had been sold by auction at London some months before he died.<br>
