<span class="headword">Clennell,  Luke</span>  (1781&#150;1840), <span class="occ">artist and wood-engraver</span>, was born on 8 April 1781 at Ulgham, near Morpeth, Northumberland, and baptized there on 11 May, the second of the seven children of John Clennell, farmer. His powerful natural gifts as a draughtsman were evident from an early age. After attending Ulgham village school he was placed briefly with his uncle, a grocer and tanner in Morpeth. His graphic talent is said to have so impressed the young Lord Morpeth, son of the earl of Carlisle, that an introduction was made to Thomas Bewick (1753&#150;1828), to whom he was indentured for seven years on his sixteenth birthday, 8 April 1797 [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/69665/', "Bewick, Thomas, apprentices")</script>]. Bewick was at the height of his powers, having just put to press his first volume of the celebrated <span class="italic">British Birds</span>. Clennell was fortunate in the timing of his training and before long was contributing to the production of the second volume of the <span class="italic">Birds</span>. His tailpiece vignettes are distinctive in the vigour of their cutting and are clearly the work of a confident hand; some are of his own design and some exquisitely finished preliminaries survive in private hands; these anticipate his success as a watercolourist during his later brief career in London.<br>
<br>During the latter part of Clennell's apprenticeship Bewick's workshop had been engraving blocks for James Wallis, a London bookseller who was publishing editions of Shakespeare's plays and Hume's <span class="italic">History of England</span>. Charlton Nesbit, a former apprentice by then working in London, had also been commissioned by Wallis, and he may have been the spur to Clennell's move south. Here Clennell flourished, securing the full fee for work from which his master had previously deducted half. He was soon introduced to a wider circle of artists and engravers and on 27 August 1809 married, at St Pancras Church, Elizabeth, the daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28774/', "Charles Warren")</script>, a leading metal-engraver employed by the book- and printsellers. They lived in London first at 9 Constitution Row, Gray's Inn Lane, and then in 1813 moved to 33 Penton Place, Pentonville. Among his commissions were wood engravings for <span class="italic">The Hive of Ancient and Modern Literature</span> (1806), William Falconer's <span class="italic">Shipwreck</span> (1808), William Beattie's <span class="italic">The Minstrel</span> (1808), John Lawrence's <span class="italic">The History and Delineation of the Horse</span> (1809), <span class="italic">The Antiquarian Itinerary</span> (1815), and <span class="italic">Recreations in Natural History</span> (1815). For the latter, and for some of the illustrations in Mrs Barbauld's edition of the <span class="italic">British Novelists</span> (1810), copperplates were engraved by various hands after Clennell. There are thirty of his drawings for the novels of Smollett, Sterne, and others, in the Victoria and Albert Museum, London, and his lively figures and the vigorously expressed narrative content show a marked contrast to the more staged and delicate work of the other illustrators of the day such as Richard Corbould and Richard Westall. His name is often remembered for the cuts he engraved after drawings by Thomas Stothard, for Samuel Rogers's <span class="italic">Pleasures of Memory</span> (1810), although these are no more than very sensitively worked reproductive engravings in the black-line manner.<br>
<br>Clennell's powers as a painter were recognized by Benjamin West, whose motif for the Highland Society of London's diploma he had engraved on wood in 1809, and it is said that it was West who encouraged him to move away from engraving. He was soon exhibiting with the various societies of painters in watercolours and in 1812 was elected an associate of the Society of Painters in Water Colours.<br>
<br>By 1814 Clennell had produced sixty-eight large drawings for most of the plates in Scott's <span class="italic">Border Antiquities</span> engraved by Storer and Greig. Examples are to be seen in the Laing Gallery, Newcastle upon Tyne, and in the Victoria and Albert Museum. They show all his skilful freedom in handling and effect, and much of the influence of Peter DeWint, and of Fran&ccedil;ois Francia and Thomas Girtin. His colouring is generally rich and sombre and his rustic figures are particularly characteristic, often with gesturing hands and prominent thumbs, and possibly reflecting what may have been his own sturdy build. Other examples of his work are rare, but some are to be found at the Paul Mellon Center for British Art, New Haven, Connecticut, the British Museum, the Natural History Society of Northumbria, Newcastle upon Tyne, and in private hands. He was given to signing his engravings and drawings within and as part of his designs, as for example on a packhorse's load or on an inn sign or turnpike notice, either simply with initials or with his name in a running hand.<br>
<br>Clennell had also taken to painting in oils. His first major subject, <span class="italic">Sportsmen Taking Refreshment at the Door of a Country Ale House</span>, was exhibited at the British Institution in 1813. His fine <span class="italic">The Baggage Waggon in a Thunderstorm</span> was shown at the Royal Academy in 1816, based on an earlier watercolour of 1810; versions of this subject can now be seen at the Laing Gallery and at the Paul Mellon Center for British Art, New Haven. In the same year he won a premium from the British Institution for his <span class="italic">Final Charge of the Life Guards at Waterloo</span>, a composition &#145;full of fire and furious movement&#146;  (Dobson, 196).<br>
<br>The most substantial work of Clennell's career brought it to a tragic end. In 1814 a banquet was held at London's Guildhall to celebrate what was thought to be the end of the Napoleonic wars, and the earl of Bridgewater commissioned Clennell to make a record of the occasion. The canvas measured 4 ft 2 in. by 6 ft 3 in. and was to contain the portraits of more than a hundred of the guests. Sketches had to be made of them, accommodating all their foibles and vanities as sitters. In 1817, when this had been accomplished and the composition established, a depression seems to have descended on Clennell, who became more and more dejected; eventually he turned the picture to the wall and refused to discuss it. He was shortly afterwards, at thirty-six, committed to a London asylum. A print of the <span class="italic">Final Charge of the Life Guards</span> engraved by W. Bromley was published in 1819, from which a subscription was raised to support Clennell's wife and four children. The incomplete picture of the 1814 banquet was later finished by other hands and is now after a long period of misattribution restored to Clennell's name in the Guildhall, London. By 1827 Clennell was living with relatives in Northumberland before his uncontrolled insanity led to his incarceration in a Newcastle asylum. He died on 9 February 1840 and was buried in St Andrew's churchyard, Newcastle upon Tyne.<br>
<br>Two self-portraits exist, one a sketch in the Laing Gallery, the other in oils as a figure in the Guildhall painting. They show a strong head but little of Clennell's figure, which the engraver Edward Willis described as &#145;small and in-kneed&#146;, adding that Clennell had &#145;a peculiar look with his eyes&#146;  (MS records for Chatto's <span class="italic">Treatise on Wood Engraving</span>, 1839, London Library). William Bell Scott described Clennell's son Luke as &#145;a short man of Herculean build and bluff face, full of energy and possessed of an impulsive mental force which I feared from the first moment I saw him&#146;; Scott went on to tell of the son's decline into insanity at the same age as his father  (<span class="italic">Autobiographical Notes</span>, 198&#150;201). It may be reasonable to suppose that the son's sturdy frame was inherited. A further, unnamed, witness spoke of how much he loved Clennell: &#145;he was always so mild, so amiable, in short, such a <span class="smallcap">GOOD</span> fellow&#146;  (Dobson, 200).<br>
<br>Some of Clennell's watercolours for tailpiece subjects are in the British Museum and the Natural History Society of Northumbria, Newcastle upon Tyne. The Victoria and Albert Museum and the Laing Art Gallery hold many of his landscape and genre watercolours, including, in the latter, several for Scott's <span class="italic">Border Antiquities</span> (1814). Examples of his oils are in the Laing Art Gallery, the Yale Center for British Art, New Haven, Connecticut, and the Guildhall Art Gallery, London. Some of his original woodblocks are in the Newberry Library, Chicago, the Central Library, Newcastle upon Tyne, and in private collections.<br>
