<span class="headword">Belcher,  John William</span>  (1905&#150;1964), <span class="occ">politician and trade unionist</span>, was born on 2 August 1905 at 12 Radington Road, Kensington, London, the first surviving child of John Thomas Belcher, an assurance agent and later a postal sorting worker, and his wife, Lillie Harriett, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Garrard. From 1912 onwards the family lived in Hammersmith, west London; John Belcher attended the local Brackenbury Road elementary school and won a scholarship to Latymer Upper School, Hammersmith, in 1916. He left school at sixteen and entered clerical employment, finding a secure job at the Smithfield goods depot of the Great Western Railway in December 1922. Soon afterwards he joined the Railway Clerks' Association (RCA) and became a trade union activist, a decision he regarded as &#145;the turning point of my life&#146;  (Belcher, &#145;How I &hellip; rose and fell&#146;). He became branch secretary about 1929, served on local and regional bodies of the RCA and the wider labour movement during the 1930s, and founded a Workers' Educational Association study group on economics among the Smithfield clerks. He took an external London University diploma in economics and social science in 1932 and became a fellow of the Royal Economic Society.<br>
<br>Belcher married Louisa Moody on 5 June 1927, when both were aged twenty-one; she was the daughter of William Moody, an engine man of Chalk Farm. He recalled that &#145;we took a chance on marrying so young, but our interests and political sentiments were so identical, and we were so much in love, that we never thought about waiting&#146;  (Belcher, &#145;John Belcher's tribute&#146;). They remained in love for the rest of their lives, although their marriage was childless until their daughter Jill was born on 22 June 1940. Shortly afterwards the family moved from Camden Town, north London, to Sydney Road in Enfield, Middlesex. The Belchers had three children.<br>
<br>Belcher suffered from poor health for much of his life. He had surgery in 1931 for intestinal problems including a duodenal ulcer and was classified disabled during the Second World War, during which he worked as a lecturer for the Ministry of Information. He was elected Labour MP for Sowerby, Yorkshire, in July 1945 and was among the first of the 1945 intake to be given a ministerial job&#151;parliamentary secretary at the Board of Trade&#151;on 12 January 1946. A large proportion of his workload lay in dealing with the complex apparatus of controls, permits, and rationing administered by the Board of Trade during the 1940s. While a popular and well-regarded minister, he suffered from severe stress, and by the middle of 1947 &#145;luncheons and dinners which I had to attend in increasing numbers became an ordeal and I only kept going by dosing myself with various powders to relieve the almost constant pain. I knew I was heading for a breakdown&#146;  (Belcher, &#145;What happens&#146;). He turned increasingly to alcohol, which worried the president of the Board of Trade, Harold Wilson, and Belcher's own civil servants. His health did indeed collapse and he spent several weeks in hospital in May 1948.<br>
<br>Belcher tried to meet as many business people as possible directly, operate controls reasonably, and win trust for the Labour government. Unfortunately he formed his closest links with a fraudster, illegal alien, and undischarged bankrupt known as Sidney Stanley. Stanley was a &#145;contact man&#146; who claimed to be able to arrange favours from government for businessmen on production of a fee. One such was Harry Sherman, an unscrupulous football pools promoter. Stanley showered Belcher with minor gifts, such as a suit, a week in a hotel in Margate, and frequent visits to the dog track. Belcher na&iuml;vely accepted these as friendly gestures. He also saw no harm in accepting gifts from other people who had dealings with the Board of Trade, such as a few Max Factor cosmetics and a prodigious amount of sherry from Maurice Bloch distillers. Stanley falsely claimed to clients that Belcher took cash bribes but pocketed the money himself.<br>
<br>Rumours started to circulate about corruption at the Board of Trade in summer 1948; Wilson called in the police on 9 October 1948 and Belcher was suspended from duty on 18 October. On 9 October the prime minister, Clement Attlee, announced the appointment of a tribunal of inquiry under Sir George Lynskey to investigate the allegations. The proceedings were highly publicized. John Belcher appeared before it and was harshly examined by the attorney-general, Sir Hartley Shawcross. Belcher's counsel conceded that the gifts were incompatible with his position as a minister of the crown, but not that his ministerial activities had been influenced. Louisa Belcher also underwent a rigorous public investigation of her finances. John Belcher resigned as a minister on 13 December 1948.<br>
<br>The tribunal's report, which was put before parliament on 22 January 1949, was harsher than the government, or Belcher, expected. It found that he had been influenced by accepting gifts, although Belcher and his ministerial and civil service colleagues continued to believe that he had not. A parallel Metropolitan Police investigation found that it would be possible to charge him and Maurice Bloch over their relationship, but Shawcross advised that if Belcher resigned his seat in parliament it would not be in the interests of justice to proceed.<br>
<br>Belcher resigned his seat in parliament just before the debate on the Lynskey report on 3 February 1949. He made a dignified resignation speech, reaffirming his belief in a business-friendly form of socialism and condemning the antisemitism that had flared up during the scandal, but he was despondent about the consequences of his mistakes, and blamed himself for damaging the labour movement. He returned to his job at the Smithfield depot. His health continued to deteriorate during the 1950s, although he found some consolation in Labour's election victory a few days before he died, on 26 October 1964, at Chase Farm Hospital in Enfield. Belcher was a bright, idealistic, working-class socialist, who was harshly treated for his na&iuml;ve attempts to forge a good relationship with business and became a martyr to the puritanical standards of conduct in public life in the austere Attlee era.<br>
