<span class="headword">Salvador,  Joseph</span>  (1716&#150;1786), <span class="occ">merchant</span>, was born on 21 January 1716 in London, the eldest son of Francis Salvador (<i>c</i>.1685&#150;1754), merchant of Lime Street, and of his wife, Rachel Mendes da Costa (<i>c</i>.1690&#150;1758). Joseph Salvador served as a warden of London's Portuguese Synagogue in 1746, 1751, 1755, and 1765. He was active in founding its infirmary, the Beth Holim, and is portrayed in an engraving attacking its committee entitled <span class="italic">The Jerusalem Infirmary: alias a Journey into the Valley of Jehosaphat</span>.<br>
<br>On 15 October 1738 Salvador married Leonora 
    (Rachel; 1716&#150;1766)
  , eldest daughter of Antonio Lopes Suasso, third baron d'Auvernes le Gras. They had two sons, who died in infancy, and five daughters. He traded in partnership with his younger brother Jacob with a joint capital of &pound;58,000. In 1749 Jacob died, leaving two sons. Salvador realized that if they too were to die their land would be forfeit to the crown, because Francis Salvador was Dutch-born. He therefore petitioned the duke of Newcastle in January 1753 for an act of parliament to enable Jews to be naturalized. He published two pamphlets in favour of this measure under the pseudonym Philo Patriae. In these he gave an interesting summary of the activities of London's Jewish merchants, arguing that it was in the national interest to encourage their residence and trade. The <span class="roman">Jewish Naturalization Bill</span> was duly enacted, but the opposition launched a fierce campaign against the measure and won in Oxfordshire at the general election 1754. The act had by then been repealed, and Salvador's ill-judged initiative set back the improvement of Jewish civil status for many years.<br>
<br>When Salvador inherited his parents' fortune, he spent &pound;2000 on buying 100,000 acres of land in South Carolina, extended his country estate at Tooting, and in 1757 built a handsome town house in White Hart Court, Bishopsgate. In 1759 he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society, and in 1764 a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries. He was the secretary of the London Committee of Deputies of British Jews on its foundation in 1760, and its president in 1778. Like his father he was, to use his own phrase, a merchant &#145;of the most extensive Trade and plumb Capitals&#146;  (Philo Patriae, <span class="italic">Further Considerations</span>, 35&#150;6): he owned ships and was a major importer of rough diamonds and bullion. In 1761 Newcastle procured Salvador's advice on floating a government loan. Under Lord Bute's ministry Salvador continued to advise the Treasury and to underwrite its new issues. He was active in mustering support for Robert Clive in the power struggle within the East India Company, and Clive employed him to market his diamonds. As he prospered, Salvador spent money on &#145;protecting&#146; expensive mistresses, first <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9489/', "Catherine Maria Fischer (Kitty Fisher)")</script> and then Margaret Caroline Rudd. He had a natural son, Joseph Salvador de Moriencourt, by the comtesse de Moriencourt.<br>
<br>In 1763 financial failures in Amsterdam caused Salvador heavy losses. George Clive wrote to Robert Clive that Salvador's capital was then reduced from &pound;200,000 to &pound;80,000. At the same time his insolvent son-in-law, Joshua Mendes da Costa, sued him over his daughter Judith's marriage contract. In 1773 another financial crisis in both Amsterdam and London destroyed most of his fortune. He sent his nephew Francis Salvador to South Carolina to manage and develop their American plantation. Francis was elected to the general assembly and then to the provincial congress and was active in the colony's struggle for independence. In 1776, leading a unit against British-armed Cherokees, Francis was shot and then scalped to death. His widow, Joseph's daughter Sarah, and their children were baptized in 1780. Joseph Salvador sold his property in England and half of his American estate and then settled on his 50,000 acre plantation at Coronaca Creek, South Carolina, in 1784. He died there on 29 December 1786 and was buried in the Da Costa Sephardi cemetery in Charleston. Joseph Salvador was an articulate, able, and ambitious merchant. Active as a Jewish leader and government adviser, he met his reverses of fortune with courage.<br>
