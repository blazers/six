<span class="headword">Charoux <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>Buchta, Charous]</span>,  Siegfried Joseph</span>  (1896&#150;1967), <span class="occ">sculptor</span>, was born at Koppstrasse 2, Vienna, Austria, on 15 November 1896, the only son of Josef Kinich (1860&#150;1916?), a civil engineer and former cadet (corporal) in the Austrian army, and Anna Buchta (1855&#150;1929), <i>n&eacute;e</i> Charous, widow of Johann Buchta and a dressmaker of Czech origin. Until 1914 Siegfried used Buchta as his surname; from 1914 he used the name Charous, which he changed to Charoux in 1926. He attended elementary and secondary schools in Vienna and was called up to serve in the Austro-Hungarian army at the beginning of 1915; after being wounded twice, he was invalided out in April 1917. A successful operation restored his paralysed right arm and saved his future as a sculptor. Two years later, after having completed some private lessons with Josef Heu, he attempted unsuccessfully to gain admission to the Hochschule f&uuml;r Angewandte Kunst in Vienna, where the Austrian sculptor Anton Hanak was teaching. In 1922 Charoux was admitted to the master class of the Akademie der Bildenden K&uuml;nste in Vienna under Hans Bitterlich, and remained there until 1924. At the same time he was engaged as a political cartoonist. On 18 December 1926 he married Margarethe Treibl (1895&#150;1985), a sales representative in the textile business; they had no children.<br>
<br>Charoux began work in the optical firm Goerz, where he had to affix lenses to telescopes with wax, and this led to his making figures in wax. He was a man of extreme political sensitivity, for which he found an outlet in the cartoons he made for the <span class="italic">Arbeiter-Zeitung</span> from 1924 to 1928. During his time as a cartoonist he used the pseudonym Chat Roux. His first exhibition was in 1927; he executed the memorial to Robert Blum (1927, Vienna), the Matteotti memorial (1929, Vienna), and the memorial to Professor Josef Herzig (unveiled 1935, University of Vienna). In the early 1930s he exhibited works in Germany, Belgium, and Italy, as well as Austria, and from 1930 to 1935 he undertook various commissions for municipal buildings in Vienna. In 1930 he won an international competition, which had eighty-three entrants, for a monument to the dramatist Gotthold Ephraim Lessing. The bronze statue, completed in 1931 and unveiled in 1935, was destroyed by the Nazis, who melted it down for armaments because of their hatred of any unusual or unconventional art. (After the Second World War he returned to Austria from England to make another.)<br>
<br>Charoux settled in England in September 1935. His early preference for the art of Auguste Rodin, expressed in his bronze group <span class="italic">Man with Lamb</span> (Art Institute of Chicago), gave way to his enthusiasm for the more tranquil qualities of Greek and Gothic sculpture at about the time of his arrival in England, where he seems to have undergone a spiritual rebirth which is clearly apparent in his work. England freed him as an artist and as a human being and he was able to explore and develop his art without fear of political persecution. An increased monumentality and an appearance of tranquillity is visible in the terracotta figure of <span class="italic">Youth: Standing Boy</span>, which was acquired under the terms of the Chantrey bequest for the Tate Gallery, London, in 1948. This work was carried out in a technique, once used by the Etruscans, of building up a hollow shell in terracotta without the reinforcement of an armature. As in his technique, Charoux was apostolically and artistically catholic about his ideas: &#145;My tolerance knows no limit&#146;, he once wrote to a friend, &#145;the fruits painted may be square, and so can be the arses, but they must be alive and carry a message&#146;  (translation from Charoux's letter to the editor, <span class="italic">Tagebuch</span>).<br>
<br>The significant commission of a terracotta figure for the novelist Hannah Cohen's garden at Durford Heath, Petersfield, Hampshire, established Charoux's career in England. He was naturalized a British subject on 16 November 1946 following his showing of a bronze bust of Sir Stafford Cripps at the Royal Academy summer exhibition in that year. In 1938 he executed stone carvings for the new school of anatomy and the engineering laboratory at Cambridge. He contributed a monumental group, <span class="italic">The Islanders</span>, to the Festival of Britain exhibition at the South Bank, London, in 1951, after which he completed nine figures, each 8 feet tall, for Salters' Hall in London, representing Manual and Spiritual Labour. His best-known work is the cycle of sculptures in London entitled <span class="italic">Civilization</span>: <span class="italic">The Judge</span> for the law courts, <span class="italic">Motor Cyclist</span> for the Shell building, and <span class="italic">The Cellist</span> for the area outside the Royal Festival Hall. He contributed to open-air exhibitions of sculptures in Battersea Park, London, in 1948, 1951, 1954, and 1960, and in Holland Park, London, in 1957.<br>
<br>Charoux was elected an ARA in 1949 and an academician in 1956. In 1948 he received the highest award for sculpture of the city of Vienna and in 1958 was made an honorary professor of the Republic of Austria. He was described as a typical Austrian in appearance: fair-haired and blue-eyed, heroic in build, and with a magnificent head like a much more amiable version of Beethoven. Almost always he wore a faded old sculptor's smock, the rolled-up sleeves revealing a massive pair of forearms and hands. He seemed happy so long as he was making something&#151;sculpture, pictures, pots, a new kiln, bread. (Jugged hare was one of his special culinary accomplishments.) He loved a good argument among friends and could be devastatingly funny, manipulating his enormous fingers to emphasize a point and wielding a shaky knowledge of English with wit and wisdom.<br>
<br>Charoux died at Manor House Hospital, Hendon, London, on 26 April 1967 and was cremated at Golders Green crematorium on 1 May. His ashes were interred at Sulz im Wienerwald, near Vienna, then in 1977 transferred to the Zentralfriedhof in Vienna.<br>
