<span class="headword">Ware,  James</span>  (1756&#150;1815), <span class="occ">surgeon and oculist</span>, born at Portsmouth on 11 February 1756, was son of Elizabeth Dale (1716&#150;1795) and Martin Ware (1717&#150;1801), who was successively the master shipbuilder of the royal dockyards of Sheerness, Plymouth, and Deptford. James Ware was educated at the Portsmouth grammar school, and went on trial to Ramsay Karr, surgeon of the King's Yard in Portsmouth on 3 July 1770. He was bound apprentice to Karr on 2 March 1771, to serve for five years from the previous July. During his apprenticeship he attended the practice of the surgeons at the Haslar naval hospital, and, as he had served a part of his time, his master allowed him, as was then usual, to go to London for the purpose of attending the medical and surgical practice of one of the general hospitals. Ware selected St Thomas's, and entered himself as a student on 25 September 1773. He remained there for three years, during the course of which he kept a diary (now in the Surrey History Centre, Woking).<br>
<br>Ware made such progress that Joseph Else appointed him in 1776 his demonstrator of anatomy. On 1 January 1777 he began to act as assistant to Jonathan Wathen, a surgeon who devoted himself principally to diseases of the eye; and on 25 March 1778 he entered into partnership with Wathen, taking a fourth share. The partnership was dissolved in 1791, after which Ware began to practise on his own account, chiefly but not entirely in ophthalmic surgery. In 1788 he became one of the founders of the Society for the Relief of the Widows and Orphans of Medical Men in London and its vicinity, a society of which he was chosen president in 1809. In 1800 he founded the school for the indigent blind, in imitation of a similar institution which had been established at Liverpool ten years earlier. He was elected a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London on 18 January 1798, and on 11 March 1802 he was admitted a fellow of the Royal Society, where his proposers included the eminent surgeons Everard Home and John Abernethy. He married in 1787 Ursula, the widow of N. Polhill, and daughter of Robert Maitland; they had a large family of sons and daughters.<br>
<br>Wathen and his pupil Ware did much to raise the status of eye surgery. Specialism in this field was long associated with quackery and regarded with suspicion in many quarters, but the efforts of men like Ware promoted its acceptance as a respected branch of the profession. Ware had a receptive and enquiring mind, and was ready to learn from any source that satisfied his critical judgement. In his day he was the best-read man in his subject, and he greatly influenced his colleagues by his practice. He was the first English surgeon to arouse any enthusiasm for Dominique Anel's syringe in the treatment of diseases of the lacrimal duct, previously much disparaged by English surgeons. After Ware's visit to Paris in 1791, the method became widely adopted. In the same year he translated Baron de Wenzel's <span class="italic">Trait&eacute; de la cataracte</span>. He freely acknowledged (although not without reservations) that he had learned more from the baron than from anyone else, even though Wenzel was often regarded as a quack. Ware himself was noted for his skill in the extraction of the lens in cataract, which was to supersede the traditional procedure of couching.<br>
<br>Ware was modest and self-critical. He did not like to talk about his philanthropic activities and, unusually for his time, he could write about his failures. <span class="italic">An Enquiry into the Causes which have Most Commonly Prevented Success in the Operation of Extracting the Cataract</span> was published in 1795. He was a prolific writer and some of his works were translated into several languages. His first book, <span class="italic">Remarks on the Ophthalmy, Psorophthalmy and Purulent Eye</span> (1780), first drew attention to the contagious nature of ophthalmia of the new-born, and its venereal origin. This work and his books on the treatment of lacrimal fistulae, as well as the translation of Wenzel, were collected and republished in 1805 in two volumes as <span class="italic">Chirurgical Observations Relative to the Eye</span>. Ware published several papers of professional importance in the <span class="italic">Transactions of the Medical Society of London</span> and the <span class="italic">Transactions of the Medical and Chirurgical Society</span>, of which the most interesting describe cases of recovery of sight after long periods of blindness. His contribution to the <span class="italic">Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society</span> made some important observations on refractive errors.<br>
<br>Ware practised in New Bridge Street, Blackfriars, and his contemporaries regarded him as one of the leaders of the profession. He died at his country house at Turnham Green, Middlesex, on 13 April 1815, and was buried on 21 April in the family tomb in the Bunhill Fields burial-ground, London.<br>
