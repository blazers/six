<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Dannreuther,  Edward George</span>  (1844&#150;1905), <span class="occ">pianist and writer</span>, was born on 4 November 1844 in Strasbourg, the first of three children of Abraham Dannreuther (1814&#150;1861), cabinet-maker and piano manufacturer, and his wife, Sophie, daughter of George Leonard Fischbacher of Strasbourg. Dannreuther spent his boyhood in Cincinnati, Ohio, whither his father had emigrated in 1846 to establish a piano manufacturing business. There he took music lessons with Frederick Louis Ritter, learning the cello and piano. In the autumn of 1859 he travelled to Leipzig, where he entered the conservatory in 1860 as a piano student with Moscheles, studying theory with Moritz Hauptmann and E. F. Richter, and numbering among his friends Grieg, Sullivan, and August Wilhelmj. In 1863 Henry Chorley, critic of <span class="italic">The Athenaeum</span>, brought Dannreuther to London, where immediately on his arrival he gave with great success the first complete English performance of Chopin's piano concerto no. 2 in F minor (11 April 1863) at the Crystal Palace; a fortnight later he performed Beethoven's concerto no. 4. In 1865 he made a tour of the United States with Carl Rosa, an account of which he was persuaded to publish by Dickens in his weekly journal <span class="italic">All the Year Round</span>. At the same time he had also fallen in love with one of his pupils, Chariclea Anthea Euterpe Ionides (1844&#150;1923), sister of Constantine Alexander Ionides, a wealthy patron of the arts. Initial opposition to their marriage from Chariclea's father led to a period of three years in which they did not see each other, but in 1870, after Dannreuther had considered returning permanently to America, they became engaged, and were married in the Greek church at London Wall on 5 August 1871. On settling in London, Dannreuther became a naturalized British citizen.<br>
<br>During the 1870s Dannreuther established a reputation in London as a musical radical, with catholic tastes and wide-ranging interests. As a pianist he continued his career as a virtuoso, giving the first English performances of concertos by Grieg, Liszt (in A), Tchaikovsky (in B[flat] minor) and Scharwenka (in B[flat] minor), as well as Parry's concerto in F&#9839; major. At his home at 12 Orme Square, Bayswater, he organized a series of semi-public chamber concerts, which began in 1876 and ceased in 1893, when the lease of the house expired. These concerts soon became known for their contemporary emphasis, with programmes consisting of works by Brahms, Sgambati, Tchaikovsky, Liszt, Wagner, Rheinberger, Richard Strauss, Parry, Stanford, and Mackenzie. But, of all contemporary composers, Dannreuther championed the work of Wagner, who was a close friend. In order to help raise money for the building of the theatre in Bayreuth he founded in 1872 the Wagner Society, two of whose series (1873&#150;4) he conducted. In 1876 he went to Bayreuth for the first performance of <span class="italic">Der Ring des Nibelungen</span>, attending all the final orchestra and stage rehearsals. In May 1877, during the Wagner Festival in London, the composer was his guest at Orme Square. There, on 17 May, in the company of George Eliot, George Lewes, Parry, Walter Bache, and Alfred Forman, Wagner recited his newly completed poem <span class="italic">Parsifal</span>. Wagner's theories of opera and drama were the subject of several of Dannreuther's articles, the most notable being &#145;Wagner and the reform of the opera&#146;. In addition, he provided a lengthy article for <span class="italic">Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians</span> and translations of three of Wagner's essays: <span class="italic">Das Kunstwerk der Zukunft</span> (1873), <span class="italic">Beethoven</span> (1880), and <span class="italic">&Uuml;ber das Dirigieren</span> (1887). Such was Dannreuther's ardour that he named his first four children&#151;Tristan, Sigmund, Wolfram, and Isolde&#151;after characters in Wagner's music dramas; his fifth child, Hubert, was named after Parry.<br>
<br>Although in the first instance Dannreuther was best known to the public as a virtuoso, it is as a teacher and writer that he is now mainly remembered. He proved to be a vital catalyst in the early career of Parry and numbered among his other pupils Fuller Maitland, Frederick Dawson, William Hurlstone, and James Friskin. In 1895 he joined the staff of the Royal College of Music. He contributed several articles to <span class="italic">Macmillan's Magazine</span> between 1875 and 1876 and wrote over thirty for <span class="italic">Grove's Dictionary</span>. For the <span class="italic">New Oxford History of Music</span> he wrote the sixth volume, <span class="italic">The Romantic Period</span> (1905), but perhaps his most enduring work was his treatise on <span class="italic">Musical Ornamentation</span> (2 pts, 1893&#150;5), which remained a standard text for many generations.<br>
<br>Dannreuther died at his home, Chester Studio, Gerald Road, Chester Square, Pimlico, on 12 February 1905, and was cremated at Golders Green.<br>
