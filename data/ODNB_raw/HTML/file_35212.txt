</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Newbolt, Sir  Henry John</span>  (1862&#150;1938), <span class="occ">poet and writer</span>, was born at St Mary's vicarage, Bilston, Staffordshire, on 6 June 1862, the elder son and eldest of the three children of Henry Francis Newbolt (1823/4&#150;1866), vicar of St Mary's Church, Bilston, and his second wife, Emily (<i>d</i>. 1921), second daughter of George Bradnock Stubbs, of Walsall and Blymhill, Staffordshire. Newbolt was educated at Clifton College and in 1881 was awarded a scholarship at Corpus Christi College, Oxford, where he took a first in classical moderations (1882) and a second in <i>literae humaniores</i> (1885). In 1887 he was called to the bar by Lincoln's Inn, London. He practised law for twelve years, contributing largely to the <span class="italic">Law Digest</span>; but during this time he was steadily tending towards literature. On 15 August 1889 Newbolt married Margaret Edina (<i>b</i>. 1867/8), fourth daughter of the Revd William Arthur Duckworth of Orchardleigh, Frome, Somerset (an estate which later formed the scene of Newbolt's romance <span class="italic">The Old Country</span>, 1906). Both courtship and marriage were unconventional, as Margaret originally refused him on the basis of her close relationship with her cousin Ella Coltman; her consent was obtained only by Newbolt's assurances that Ella would not be deserted. Ella became in effect a third member of the household, and about two years after the wedding Newbolt and she became lovers, with Margaret aware of the arrangement, and Ella moving into the house. &#145;Neither woman appeared jealous of the other, perhaps because their lover was careful to divide his favours equally&#146;  (Chitty, 91), to the extent of keeping a careful &#145;account sheet&#146;  (ibid.) of the number of nights in a month that he slept with each. Newbolt and Margaret had two children: Celia (<i>b</i>. 1890), and Francis (<i>b</i>. 1893). The details of this unconventional domestic life seem at variance with Newbolt's standard reputation as a latter-day Victorian, and suggest that he was a more complex figure than is usually supposed.<br>
<br>Newbolt's first book, <span class="italic">Taken from the Enemy</span>, appeared in 1892 and was followed by <span class="italic">Mordred</span>, a tragedy in blank verse, published in 1895; in the following year Andrew Lang printed six of Newbolt's poems in <span class="italic">Longman's Magazine</span>, and &#145;Drake's Drum&#146;, immediately famous, appeared in the <span class="italic">St James's Gazette</span>. Newbolt himself relates how after reading this poem his friend Robert Bridges declared, &#145;It isn't given to a man to write anything better than that&#146;. It was included in <span class="italic">Admirals All</span> (1897), four editions of which raced into circulation within a fortnight. Many books followed from 1898 to 1932, various in theme, but consistent in the fastidious care expended on their making. Newbolt also edited the <span class="italic">Monthly Review</span> during its brief lifetime (1900&#150;04).<br>
<br>During the First World War Newbolt served at the Admiralty and the Foreign Office, and was finally controller of wireless and cables. In 1923 he undertook the completion in two volumes (4 and 5) of the official <span class="italic">History of the Great War: Naval Operations</span>, the first three volumes of which had been written by Sir J. S. Corbett. He was conscientious in honorary service: he served on many commissions and committees, and on bodies such as the Royal Literary Fund and the Royal Society of Literature. He was a trustee of the National Portrait Gallery from 1928 to 1937. In 1915 he was knighted and appointed CH in 1922. He received honorary degrees from the universities of Bristol, Glasgow, St Andrews, Sheffield, Toronto, Oxford, and Cambridge, and in 1920 he was elected an honorary fellow of his college.<br>
<br>Newbolt's name will always be associated with the Edwardian heyday of empire. His poetry is now little read, although it still figures in anthologies, and the late twentieth century saw something of a revival of critical interest in his work, with a selected edition (1981), a critical study (1994), and a biography (1997). Poems like &#145;Drake's Drum&#146; and &#145;Vita&iuml; lampada&#146; (with its famous refrain of &#145;Play up, play up, and play the game&#146;) have always remained popular. These stirring expressions of a certain sort of Englishness remain in the national memory, alongside similar things by Kipling and Elgar. Many of Newbolt's best-known poems, like &#145;Clifton Chapel&#146;, are rooted in the ethos of the public school, though his later verse is less robust and can even be dreamy. The poets who influenced him most were Shelley, Keats, D. G. Rossetti, and William Morris. Modern poetry, even after the war, for him meant the Georgians.<br>
<br>Newbolt lived and worked in a literary world that naturally overlapped with the world of public affairs. He divided his time between his Wiltshire country house and his London base at the Athenaeum, devoting as much energy to public duties as to writing. He was known as a patriot but he was not a jingoist. In one poem he praises the <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span> as a record of Englishmen who &#145;keep the Nelson touch&#146; but in a letter of 1916 he complains that the word <i>patriot</i> &#145;ought to be forbidden&#146;. He came to regard his call to &#145;play the game&#146; as a &#145;Frankenstein's Monster that I created&#146;. W. B. Yeats told him in April 1902 that his patriotism was of the finer sort &#145;that lays burdens upon a man, &amp; not the patriotism that takes burdens off&#146;  (<span class="italic">Collected Letters</span>, 63). His chairing of the government committee which produced the Newbolt report (1921) on the teaching of English in England was innovative at the time and remains a landmark in discussions of the question.<br>
<br>Walter de la Mare recalled of Newbolt:<blockquote>His faith in Christianity and the influence of tradition, social, historical, and literary, was paramount in his mind and work. He was haunted too by the seductive problem of time, not that of the clock but of the self within, and by a &#145;sense of the past&#146; allied to the idea of the supreme consciousness, contained in a poem included in <span class="italic">A Perpetual Memory</span> (a collection of his later poems published posthumously in 1939). &#145;Pre-incarnation&#146;, so to speak, is indeed the theme of his <span class="italic">Aladore</span> (1914)&#151;love-allegory, fantasy, reverie, fairy-tale; so simple and limpid in its imposed archaic style that it may conceal its depth and its full meaning. In part for this reason it was his Benjamin among his own books.</blockquote>Newbolt was a lucid speaker and a lively conversationalist. He was not a born story-teller, but his romances have a grace of their own. In his criticism he held true to tradition, but was too urbane to be dogmatic. He was a zealous admirer of Thomas Hardy, though being himself an enthusiast by nature, who could hardly avoid a tendency to optimism. Spare in figure, aquiline in face, with a finely moulded head and a dominant nose, alert in speech and laughter, he surveyed the world from grey-blue eyes at once intent and contemplative. In spite of so many pursuits that called him away from it, poetry was his inmost and lifelong devotion. Henry Newbolt died at his London home, 29 Campden Hill Road, Kensington, on 19 April 1938.<br>
