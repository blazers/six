<span class="headword">Orde,  Cuthbert Julian</span>  (1888&#150;1968), <span class="occ">painter</span>, was born in Great Yarmouth, Norfolk, on 18 December 1888, the second son in the family of three sons and two daughters of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/97942/', "Sir Julian Walter Orde (1861&#150;1929)")</script>, secretary for twenty years and galvanizing force of the Royal Automobile Club, and his wife, Alice Georgiana Archdale (1861&#150;1945), daughter of Frederick Archdale of Baldock, Hertfordshire. Educated at Framlingham College, Suffolk, from the 1920s he was a regular exhibitor at the Royal Academy and the Royal Society of Portrait Painters in addition to showing at the Paris Salon and in commercial London galleries.<br>
<br>Orde served throughout the First World War. Commissioned into the Royal Army Service Corps as a second lieutenant on 15 August 1914, he was sent almost immediately to France and was awarded the 1914 Mons star. He transferred to the Royal Flying Corps in October of the following year, and served as an observer in France and Egypt, and as a test pilot at Martlesham Heath, Suffolk, reaching the war substantive rank of major. He relinquished his commission on 15 January 1919 on the grounds of ill health. One of his brothers was killed in action in the Dardanelles in 1915; a second brother was killed in a flying accident in 1920.<br>
<br>Between the wars Orde exhibited portraits, landscapes, and flower paintings, but with the outbreak of the Second World War his twin interests in art and the air force found a common focus. He began painting aircraft at RAF stations and four of his drawings, and a painting of a Wellington &#145;bombing up&#146;, were acquired by the War Artists' Advisory Committee and exhibited at the National Gallery in August 1940. The following month he embarked on a project proposed by the director of public relations at the Air Ministry to draw portraits of the pilots of Fighter Command. Beginning at the height of the battle of Britain in September 1940, he visited almost every operational station in the country, in his element as an airman among airmen, drawing the pilots selected for him by the station commanders. Affectionately known as Turps, Uncle Orde, or the Captain, he worked in makeshift studios, generally set up in the ladies' room in the mess, producing in all a series of some 160 drawings. A selection published by Harraps in 1942 remains of documentary interest and, formulaic as they are, these portraits show Orde at his best, conveying a real sympathy for the men and the ethos of Fighter Command.<br>
<br>A substantial number of these drawings, together with various of Orde's paintings, are in the collections of the Imperial War Museum and the RAF Museum. Others are in the National Portrait Gallery, London. Portraits were also commissioned from him for the Senior United Services Club, the RAF Club, the Royal Aeronautical Society, and the Staff College at Camberley, and among his sitters were Sir Winston Churchill (Royal Airforce College, Cranwell), Air Chief Marshal Sir John Salmond (RAF Club), and Group Captain Sir Douglas Bader (RAF Museum). His modest talent, however, fell far short of securing him a lucrative career.<br>
<br>Tall, dashing, and seeming youthful even in his later years, Orde was a man of ready friendship and devoted family loyalty. On 11 September 1916 he married Lady Eileen Wellesley (1887&#150;1952), younger daughter of Arthur Charles Wellesley, fourth duke of Wellington. Also a painter, she fell victim to Parkinson's disease not long after the First World War and lived a virtual invalid until her death in 1952. They had two daughters. In 1953 Orde married Alexandra (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Dalziel), former wife of Sir Alexander Davenport Kinloch, twelfth baronet, and daughter of Frederick Dalziel, of New York. She had two daughters from her former marriage. As his friend Group Captain Douglas Bader wrote of him in <span class="italic">The Times</span> on 28 December 1968, Orde died at his home, 1 Durham Place, London, &#145;charmingly and without fuss&#146;, a few hours after celebrating his eightieth birthday, on 19 December 1968. His funeral was held at Christ Church, Chelsea, where he was buried on 23 December. His second wife survived him.<br>
