<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Cubitt,  Lewis</span>  (1799&#150;1883), <span class="occ">architect</span>, was born in September 1799, the fourth and youngest son of Jonathan Cubitt (1760&#150;1807), a Norfolk carpenter, and Agnes Scarlett. In July 1814 his eldest brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6859/', "Thomas Cubitt (1788&#150;1855)")</script>, the most respected and successful of the nineteenth-century London builder&#150;developers, became a member of the Carpenters' Company by redemption (that is, payment of a sum of money). In February of the following year Lewis was bound to him as an apprentice and thus seven years later he also became a member of the company, this time in the traditional manner. By 1822 his eldest brother had already placed him in charge of smaller jobs, such as the construction of two houses in Berkeley Square. He also received some training in the architectural office of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/59945/', "Henry Edward Kendall (1776&#150;1875)")</script>, a former pupil of Thomas Leverton and John Nash, whose designs for town houses were well regarded. Lewis later married Kendall's daughter Sophia on 23 January 1830 at St Nicholas, Brighton, Sussex. By 1824 Lewis and two of his brothers were in partnership as &#145;Messrs. T. W. and L. Cubitt&#146;, though this union was dissolved in 1827, Lewis first working with Thomas and then with the middle brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6861/', "William Cubitt (1791&#150;1863)")</script>, whose firm Lewis joined in 1831. Later in the 1830s Lewis established his own architectural practice at 77 Great Russell Street, London. Most of the extensive residential developments built in Bloomsbury and Belgravia by the Cubitts in the 1820s were probably to designs by Lewis. In comparison with his brothers his own speculative developments were minor, for instance the series of Italianate houses on the south side of Lowndes Square which he designed and built in 1837&#150;9.<br>
<br>During the 1840s Cubitt established a substantial and well-deserved reputation as a railway architect, designing the Bricklayers Arms station, Bermondsey (1842&#150;4; dem.), and a building in Colchester originally intended to be the Victoria Hotel, but which was completed as a lunatic asylum (the Royal Counties Institution, 1843).<br>
<br>Cubitt's involvement with the railways culminated at the end of the decade in his best-known work, the terminus at Battle Bridge for the Great Northern Railway known as King's Cross Station. The Great Northern route, the second, eastern, line to the north, had opened with a temporary station to the north of Regent's Canal in 1850 in time to bring hordes of visitors to the Great Exhibition. The permanent station, on the site of the old smallpox hospital where the New (now Euston) Road intersected the Caledonian Road, was completed in 1852 with remarkable speed and economy (it cost less than the budgeted &pound;123,500). Its utilitarian character was in marked contrast to the nearby Euston Station with its Greek revival propylaeum (1837) by Philip Hardwick. At King's Cross the station consisted of two parallel sheds, each 800 feet long and 105 feet wide, with glazed roofs supported by a system of innovative laminated timber arches rising to a height of 71 feet. These timbers were replaced with curved steel girders between 1869 and 1887 without substantially altering the appearance of the interior. The sheds covered two sets of platforms, one set for departure and the other for arrival. This simple arrangement was lucidly expressed in the organization of the fa&ccedil;ade, which was constructed of London stock brick. It featured two massive glazed arches set in deep stepped reveals which were separated by an Italianate clock tower 120 feet high and buttressed at either end by severe brick pylons. In the contemporary press it was noted approvingly that &#145;great plainness prevails: the architect depends wholly for effect on the largeness of some of the features, the fitness of the structure for its purpose, and a characteristic expression of that purpose&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Builder</span>, 9/459, 1851, 731). It was precisely these qualities which caused the building to be held in high regard during that part of the twentieth century when Victorian architecture in general was held in disdain for its frivolity of ornament. Cubitt was also responsible for a number of the structures covering the 45 acres of goods yards which stretched to the north of the terminus, including a substantial granary. His Great Northern Station Hotel, to the west of the train sheds, was a curving Italianate block which in its gentility bore little relation to the sublime grandeur of the main station.<br>
<br>Cubitt seems not to have engaged in professional work after 1852, perhaps confirming the family tradition that he was &#145;the laziest and least satisfactory of the three&#146; brothers  (Colvin, <span class="italic">Archs</span>., 282). He received a bequest of &pound;10,000 following the death of his brother Thomas in 1855. He died at his home, 5 Lewes Crescent, Brighton, Sussex, on 9 June 1883, leaving three daughters, Ada, Agnes, and Ellen. His son Lewis predeceased him.<br>
