<span class="headword">Mayne,  Perry</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1697, <em>d.</em> 1761), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, was the son of Covill Mayne (<i>c</i>.1675&#150;1746), captain in the navy, and his wife, Martha Perry. Baptized at St Dunstan's, Stepney, Middlesex, he was probably a pupil at King's School, Canterbury, between 1710 and 1711. He entered the service in August 1712 in the <i>Dolphin</i>, then commanded by his father, and served, according to his passing certificate, briefly in the <i>Lynn</i>, and then (again with his father) in the <i>Prince Frederick</i>, in the Baltic, and the <i>Guernsey</i>; a John Mayne also accompanied them and was probably a relation. Perry passed for lieutenant on 21 June 1720 and was soon appointed to the <i>Ipswich</i>; in June 1721 he moved to the <i>Falkland</i>, going out to Jamaica with the broad pennant of Commodore Barrow Harris, who, on 22 March 1725, promoted him to command the sloop <i>Spence</i>. He was with her until appointed captain of the <i>Dragon</i> on 24 September 1725.<br>
<br>On his return home Mayne was appointed in March 1727 to the <i>Seaford</i>, going to the Sound with Sir John Norris's fleet, and in 1729, after home service, he went to Jamaica. In December 1730 Mayne exchanged with Captain Berkeley of the <i>Lion</i>, in which he returned home in June 1732. His next appointment was to the <i>Worcester</i> in July 1738, and he joined Edward Vernon's fleet for the West Indies, taking an important part in the attack on Portobello, bombarding the Gloria Castle. Later, as one of the senior captains of the fleet, he was put in charge of such important tasks as the landing at Cartagena. He moved to the <i>Princesa</i> in 1742, and later to the <i>Orford</i>, but she was wrecked on the voyage home, though without loss of life.<br>
<br>Mayne reached flag-rank on 23 April 1745, and was employed in the Channel Fleet until ordered to be a member of the court martial of Vice-Admiral Richard Lestock, and later at that of Admiral Thomas Mathews. Although appointed commander-in-chief at the Nore on 10 March 1746 he was engaged for much of that year, and for most of 1747, with Lestock's and Mathews's courts martial, of which he became president after the withdrawal through illness of Sir Chaloner Ogle. During Lestock's trial Mayne was himself accused of false imprisonment by a Lieutenant Frye who had been sentenced by a court martial on which Mayne had sat. The accusation brought the members of Lestock's court martial into confrontation with the chief justice of common pleas, and alarmed the Admiralty, who feared the collapse of order and government in the navy. Mayne's position was further complicated since his presidency required him to try officers of greater seniority; the final verdicts were very controversial, and were clearly heavily influenced by political pressure.<br>
<br>Although he seems to have been in good standing, and was mentioned for possible commands, Mayne did not serve again. He was superannuated in 1757 and died at home at Mortlake on 5 August 1761. Mayne apparently never married, leaving bequests to a sister and the residue to a schoolmaster friend. He was evidently in comfortable circumstances.<br>
