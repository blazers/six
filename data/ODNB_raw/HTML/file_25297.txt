</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Sheffield,  John</span>, first duke of Buckingham and Normanby  (1647&#150;1721), <span class="occ">politician and author</span>, was born on 8 September 1647, the only son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25294/', "Edmund Sheffield, second earl of Mulgrave (1611&#150;1658)")</script>, one of Oliver Cromwell's councillors and one of the peers called to the protector's upper house, and Elizabeth Cranfield (1607/8&#150;1672), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6609/', "Lionel Cranfield, first earl of Middlesex")</script>. On his father's death, he succeeded as third earl of Mulgrave. In 1661 his mother married Sir John Bennet, and Mulgrave was sent to France in the care of a private tutor, who took care that he was not caught up in Catholic practices, on one occasion preventing him from kneeling in the street as a procession carrying the host passed by. On his return to England, and to the court, in 1665 Mulgrave undertook a programme of self-education, learning Latin well enough to translate Epicurus and write a commentary on the letters of Cicero.<h2>
<a name="IntheserviceofCharlesII"></a>In the service of Charles II</h2>In 1666 Mulgrave joined the navy as a volunteer, serving on the flagship of Prince Rupert against the Dutch. On 13 June 1667, with the Dutch threatening to invade England, Mulgrave was made captain of a troop of horse. In November 1669 he challenged John Wilmot, second earl of Rochester, to a duel, believing Rochester had written a satire about him, but Rochester treated the challenge as a joke, arriving at the duel to claim that he was not in good health and unable to proceed. Mulgrave was deeply offended and subsequently held Rochester to be an enemy, although Rochester was probably obeying an order from Charles II not to carry out the duel. Mulgrave served as a volunteer with the fleet at the battle of Solebay on 28 May 1672. He continued to be promoted, becoming a gentleman of the bedchamber, and was appointed commander of the <i>Captain</i>, one of the best second-rate vessels in the fleet, in 1673. His army commission was raised to colonel of the 3rd foot, or Old Holland regiment, the same year, and he was nominated knight of the Garter on 23 April 1674, being invested on 28 May. He continued his military education by serving under Marshal Turenne in France.<br>
<br>Despite these successes, Mulgrave deeply resented that James Scott, duke of Monmouth, eldest illegitimate son of Charles II and from April 1678 captain-general of land forces, opposed his wish to command the 1st troop of Horse Guards. In revenge Mulgrave encouraged the animosity between Monmouth and James, duke of York, the king's brother, suggesting that Monmouth was planning a coup to seize the throne and was manoeuvring himself into a position to accomplish it, while intimating to Monmouth that York had sexual designs on Monmouth's wife. When York and Monmouth fell out Mulgrave benefited handsomely, accepting the positions of governor of Hull and lord lieutenant of the East Riding of Yorkshire that had been stripped from Monmouth.<br>
<br>The development of Mulgrave's career at court was accompanied by the expansion of his literary interests. He wrote a prologue to a performance at court of Elkanah Settle's <span class="italic">The Empress of Morocco</span> in July 1673, alongside another by his rival Rochester. He established a friendly relationship with John Dryden, combining the roles of patron and collaborator. Dryden benefited from Mulgrave's access to Charles II and the duke of York, as well as from financial support. Mulgrave had his attempts at verse corrected by Dryden. In 1676 Mulgrave was the dedicatee of Dryden's <span class="italic">Aureng-Zebe</span>, a play whose protagonist was a dispossessed prince; the dedication implicitly praised Mulgrave for his loyal partisanship of the duke of York's right to succeed Charles II. Subsequently, in March 1679, Mulgrave collaborated with Dryden on the translation of Ovid's letter from Helen to Paris for Dryden's <span class="italic">Ovid's Epistles</span>. Mulgrave was probably the author of the &#145;Essay on satire&#146; which circulated in manuscript in 1679 and attacked prominent figures at court including the king and Rochester; Dryden was blamed and physically assaulted, but the friendship between patron and poet survived.<br>
<br>Mulgrave continued to support the court during the exclusion crisis, winning further literary endorsement from Dryden, and consistently voted against attempts to remove the duke of York from the succession in the Lords. In 1680 he commanded a relief expedition to the English garrison at Tangier, but the mission was poorly planned and so badly supplied that it accomplished little. He incurred the king's displeasure by refusing to drink healths to Charles until he and his men were safely landed in a rotting boat they had been assigned, but redeemed himself with a carefully drawn report on the fortifications of Tangier. In 1682 he published the first edition of his <span class="italic">An Essay upon Poetry</span>, imitating Horace's <span class="italic">Ars poetica</span>; it went through several subsequent revised editions during Mulgrave's lifetime. He remained in the king's favour until November 1682, when he was banned from court after gossip circulated that he had seduced the duke of York's daughter Anne. He claimed that it was a harmless flirtation and that he was &#145;only ogling&#146; her  (Gregg, 27), but he was stripped of his offices and remained without employment until 1684, when he was restored to the Holland regiment.<h2>
<a name="JamesIIandtherevolution"></a>James II and the revolution</h2>The accession of James II brought Mulgrave back into full royal favour. In May 1685 he was appointed a gentleman of the bedchamber, on 24 July he joined the privy council, and in October was promoted to lord chamberlain of the household. After a long bachelorhood Mulgrave married at Littlecote Chapel, Ramsbury, Wiltshire, on 18 March 1686; his wife was Ursula (<i>d</i>. 1697), widow of Edward Conway, earl of Conway, eldest daughter of George Stawell and Ursula, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Austen. Her grandfather was the royalist army officer Sir John Stawell. They had no children. James made Mulgrave an ecclesiastical commissioner on 22 November 1686, replacing Laurence Hyde, earl of Rochester, and Mulgrave became closely associated with James's religious policies. He attended mass with the king, but never converted to Catholicism nor took communion. In 1687 he was reappointed lord lieutenant of the East Riding of Yorkshire and also became vice-admiral for Yorkshire and Northumberland. Later Mulgrave excused his accepting a seat on the ecclesiastical commission by claiming that he had no idea the commission was illegal, nor had he intended to take the lieutenancy of the East Riding from Charles Seymour, sixth duke of Somerset, whom James had removed for not introducing the papal nuncio at court.<br>
<br>In 1688 Mulgrave witnessed the birth of the king's son James Francis Edward, and remained at the king's side in London until James II fled on 11 December 1688. He was one of the peers who met at the Guildhall in London that day and formed the provisional government. He received praise from all sides when he rescued the Spanish ambassador from an anti-Catholic mob and saved the ambassador's house from destruction, thereby preserving England's relationship with Spain, which was sympathetic to William's invasion. He was initially loyal to James, and on learning of James's capture at Faversham led moves for his rescue. When James returned to Whitehall, Mulgrave requested a marquessate, but was rejected. Mulgrave, slighted, abandoned James, supported moves to establish the convention, and in February 1689 voted to accept William and Mary as joint sovereigns. That year he wrote an essay, &#145;Humanum est errare, or, False steps on both sides&#146;, which reflected badly on the conduct of both James and William, but it was never published; the manuscript survives in the British Library. Another essay of this period was &#145;The character of a tory, in answer to that of a trimmer&#146;, replying to the pamphlet by George Savile, marquess of Halifax.<h2>
<a name="The1690s"></a>The 1690s</h2>Mulgrave was not trusted by the new regime. He was not included in the new monarchs' privy council, although in 1691 the lord president, Thomas Osborne, marquess of Carmarthen (formerly earl of Danby), included Mulgrave on a list of candidates for the post of lord lieutenant of Ireland that was sent to William. None the less he drifted into opposition as a non-government tory. In January 1693 he supported the claim of the lords to be allowed to assess their own estates for the land tax. However later that year he opposed the <span class="roman">Triennial Bill</span>, thereby aligning himself with William, but also protested with the whig leaders Halifax and Charles Talbot, twelfth earl of Shrewsbury, against the renewal of press censorship. As part of the reconstruction of the government to accommodate Shrewsbury in spring 1694, on 3 May he was made a privy councillor, with an annual pension of &pound;3000, and on 10 May was created marquess of Normanby. He attended the cabinet and in November 1694 acted as speaker of the House of Lords during the illness of the lord keeper, Sir John Somers. On 25 January 1695 he replied for the government in the Lords against the speech of the former secretary of state Daniel Finch, second earl of Nottingham. However, following the uncovering of the Jacobite plot to assassinate William in 1696, Normanby refused to sign the association recognizing William as rightful and lawful king, and on 12 March 1696 was struck off the list of privy councillors by William's own hand.<br>
<br>Normanby's refusal to abjure James by signing the association won him the praise of Dryden in the <span class="italic">Dedication of the Aeneis</span>, but he was again out of office with little prospect of return. He emphasized that he was not a supporter of Catholic hegemony in England by publishing in 1696 <span class="italic">The Character of Charles II, King of England, with a Short Account of his being Poyson'd</span>, which insinuated that Charles had been murdered by Catholics in order to ensure the accession of the allegedly more pliant James II. In November 1696 he joined the duke of Leeds (formerly Carmarthen) in opposing the government proposal to extend the privileges of the Bank of England, and opposed the attainder of the Jacobite conspirator Sir John Fenwick. On 12 March 1699 he married his second wife, Katherine (<i>d</i>. 1704), widow of Wriothesley Noel, second earl of Gainsborough, and daughter of Fulke Greville, fifth Baron Brooke of Beauchamp's Court, and Sarah, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Dashwood. This marriage was also childless. Normanby opposed settling the English succession on the house of Hanover, and in debates on the <span class="roman">Act of Settlement</span> in 1701 suggested that Prince George of Denmark should have preference over the Hanoverians in inheriting the throne. Although frequently criticized for switching sides from James II to William and Mary, Normanby's course during the 1690s rarely led him to power and he seems to have genuinely followed his conscience, frequently to his detriment.<h2>
<a name="OfficeandoppositionunderAnne"></a>Office and opposition under Anne</h2>Normanby's allies in opposition were defenders of the high-church position, and with them he moved closer to William III following the decision of Louis XIV to recognize the son of James II as James III following the dethroned monarch's death in 1701. On 2 January 1702 Normanby proposed the Lords' address of thanks to William III, which expressed the peers' hostility to Louis. Following the accession of Queen Anne, who remembered her former admirer fondly, as well as his courtesy towards her husband, he was reappointed to the privy council on 21 April 1702, and became lord privy seal on 2 May. He also became lord lieutenant of the North Riding of Yorkshire. In cabinet he argued against Anne's orders that the Electress Sophia of Hanover be included in prayers for the royal family, and thought that England should be an auxiliary member of the grand alliance and use the war against France to improve her colonial position and avoid a lengthy entanglement on land. Nevertheless, he survived the removal of Rochester from office in February 1703, and Anne showed her continued support for him by creating him duke of Buckingham and Normanby on 23 March 1703. As the letters patent specified that he was to be &#145;duke of the county of Buckingham&#146;, he was sometimes referred to as duke of Buckinghamshire.<br>
<br>Buckingham's promotion may have been intended to show the high-church interest that they were still regarded highly by the queen, but it was seen as an inconvenience by the lord treasurer, Sidney Godolphin, first earl of Godolphin, who wanted to secure the ministry by making it more acceptable to the whigs. Sarah Churchill, duchess of Marlborough, the keeper of the queen's privy purse, also resented Buckingham's influence over court administration and the permission the queen had given him to build a town residence, Buckingham House, on the western edge of St James's Park. Buckingham was gradually forced from office during 1704; his pension ceased to be paid, rumours spread that he was intriguing with the tory opposition, and on 23 March 1705 he was dismissed from his offices. His removal was criticized in a pamphlet, <span class="italic">The Memorial of the Church of England</span> (1705), which portrayed Buckingham as a friend of the church, wronged by Anne, whose dismissal left the church open to attack from the duke of Marlborough, Godolphin, and their whig allies. It was cited in an acrimonious debate in the Lords that December, when Buckingham and Rochester were attacked as responsible for it as part of a campaign to discredit the queen and her whig ministers. In November 1705 he was one of the ringleaders of the tory scheme to embarrass the queen and ministry by inviting the Electress Sophia to reside in England. On 20 May 1707 he was removed from the privy council. Later that year Robert Harley and Godolphin planned to include him in an abortive ministerial reconstruction that would have freed the ministry from reliance on the junto whigs.<br>
<br>Buckingham's interests outside politics at this time included the construction of Buckingham House from a design executed (but perhaps not originated) by William Winde. The house was built between 1703 and 1705 and led Buckingham's enemy at court, the duchess of Marlborough, to invite him to advise on the construction of Marlborough House, also in St James's Park, in 1709. He also became a patron of the poet Alexander Pope. On 16 March 1706, at St Martin-in-the-Fields, Westminster, he married Katherine (1681/2&#150;1743), widow of James Annesley, third earl of Anglesey, and previously Lady Katherine Darnley, illegitimate daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/14593/', "James II")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25020/', "Catharine Sedley, suo jure countess of Dorchester")</script>. The new duchess was a Jacobite sympathizer, and the marriage served to identify Buckingham further with high toryism. They had two daughters and three sons, only one of whom, Edmund (1716&#150;1735), survived to adulthood. The second son was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/93088/', "Robert Sheffield, marquess of Normanby")</script>. Buckingham already had at least two children out of wedlock. A relationship with Frances Stewart, wife of Oliver Lambart, younger son of Charles, third earl of Cavan, resulted in the birth of a son, Charles Herbert, later Sir Charles Sheffield, first baronet (<i>c</i>.1706&#150;1774), who eventually inherited the Normanby estate in Lincolnshire. An illegitimate daughter from an earlier relationship, Mary Sheffield (<i>d</i>. 1729), married Arthur Annesley, fourth Baron Altham (1688/9&#150;1727), and may have been the mother of the peerage claimant James Annesley.<br>
<br>Buckingham had connections with financiers in the City of London&#151;he was a proprietor in the East India Company&#151;and Harley made use of these to secure city support for a future Harley-led ministry. Buckingham returned to office when Harley formed a tory-based ministry in 1710, becoming a privy councillor once more and lord steward of the household; in June 1711 he was promoted to lord president of the council, and also that year recovered the lord lieutenancies of the north and east ridings of Yorkshire, as well as gaining that of Middlesex. He was also appointed one of the lords justices, who were to carry out administration between the queen's death and the arrival of her successor from Hanover. Following the accession of George I he was removed from all his offices, including his place on the privy council, despite his long correspondence with the Hanoverian court.<h2>
<a name="Retirementanddeath"></a>Retirement and death</h2>Buckingham devoted the rest of his life to literary pursuits. He supported Pope's <span class="italic">Iliad</span> and in 1717 contributed verse to <span class="italic">Poems on Several Occasions</span> alongside Pope and Anne Finch, countess of Winchilsea. He also restructured Shakespeare's <span class="italic">Julius Caesar</span> in accordance with early eighteenth-century tastes, dividing it into two independent works, <span class="italic">The Tragedy of Julius Caesar</span> and <span class="italic">The Death of Marcus Brutus</span>, introducing new characters and inserting love scenes, and scaling back the importance of the Roman citizenry. Pope contributed two of the choruses placed between the acts. Buckingham's poetry was witty and cynical, as in his derisive commentary on the morals, manners, and personal hygiene of the Parisians.<br>
<br>Buckingham died at Buckingham House on 24 February 1721, and was buried in Westminster Abbey on 25 March 1721. He was succeeded as second duke of Buckingham and Normanby by his son, Edmund, upon whose death all his titles became extinct. At the request of the duchess Pope edited Buckingham's works for publication, but before Pope's edition could be published an unauthorized collection was released in 1721 by Edmund Curll. Pope's version appeared on 24 January 1723, but the books were seized by the government as &#145;in some Part of these Volumes great Reflections are cast upon the late happy Revolution&#146;  (Mack, 396), forcing the excision of &#145;Some account of the revolution&#146;, where Buckingham had insinuated that William III had come to England with the deliberate intention of seizing the throne, and &#145;A feast of the gods&#146;, where Buckingham commented that the Dutch were &#145;remarkable for industry, and for having no one good quality besides&#146;  (ibid.). The two essays were published separately&#151;in London as <span class="italic">The Castrations</span> in 1723 and in The Hague as <span class="italic">Buckingham Restor'd</span> in 1727&#151;and included in the fourth edition of Buckingham's works in 1740. Samuel Johnson wrote of him that &#145;His verses are often insipid, but his memoirs are lively and agreeable; he had the perspicuity and elegance of an historian, but not the fire and fancy of a poet&#146;  (Johnson).<br>
