<span class="headword">Penn,  James</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1727, <em>d.</em> 1800), <span class="occ">religious writer</span>, son of John Penn, stationer, of St Bride's parish, London, was baptized at St Bride's on 9 June 1727. He was admitted a scholar of Christ's Hospital, London, from the parish of St Dunstan-in-the-West in April 1736, and in 1745, as a &#145;Grecian&#146;, obtained an exhibition at Balliol College, Oxford, where he matriculated on 4 July that year. He proceeded BA in 1749 and MA in 1752. He was elected under grammar master of Christ's Hospital in 1753, and in 1761 published a Latin grammar which was used in the school well into the nineteenth century. In 1756 he was curate of St Andrew Undershaft, Leadenhall Street, and the following year was curate of the united parishes of St Anne and St Agnes and St John Zachary in Aldersgate. In those two years he published the first two of his four volumes of miscellaneous tracts and sermons, some of which show &#145;far too large a portion of controversial spirit&#146;  (Orme, 345), but also considerable humour and satire.<br>
<br>In 1760 Penn was a candidate for the upper grammar, or headmastership, of Christ's Hospital but lost the election to Peter Whalley by one vote. He was appointed by the governors of the Hospital to the vicarage of Clavering-cum-Langley in Essex, which he held until his death. In 1762 the third volume of his works appeared. Penn continued at the school until 1767, when he was dismissed after a disagreement with the governors, and because &#145;his eccentricities were not less remarkable than his talents&#146;  (Trollope, 301). That year he published <span class="italic">The Farmer's Daughter of Essex</span> and, one of his most characteristic works, <span class="italic">By Way of Prevention: a Sleepy Sermon &hellip; for the Dog-Days</span>. The amusing <span class="italic">Reasonableness of Repentance</span>, which contains a dedication to the devil as &#145;Tremendous sir&#146;, appeared in 1768; in 1769 seven sermons were published together.<br>
<br>From about 1769 until 1779 Penn was domestic chaplain to Granville Leveson-Gower, second Earl Gower. In 1779 he published <span class="italic">The Surrey Cottage</span>, a novel, and in 1781 his <span class="italic">Remarks</span> on Martin Madan's <span class="italic">Thelyphthora</span>. He married twice and had a son and a daughter, John and Mary, from his first marriage. From March 1781 until his death on 15 August 1800 he lived at Clavering. He was buried in London and was survived by his second wife, Mary.<br>
