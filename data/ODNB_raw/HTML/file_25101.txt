<span class="headword">Serlo</span>  (<em>b. </em><em>c.</em>1108, <em>d.</em> after 1206), <span class="occ">Cistercian monk</span>, a member successively of the communities of Fountains (<i>c</i>.1137) and Kirkstall (1147), where he probably died, appears only in Hugh of Kirkstall's history (<span class="italic">Narratio</span>) of Fountains, written <i>c</i>.1205/6&#150;1226. Hugh was commissioned by John of York, abbot of Fountains (1203&#150;11), and instructed to use the recollections of the near centenarian Serlo as the basis of his account. In the circumstances of its turbulent foundation in late 1132 from St Mary's, York, Fountains would seem, retrospectively, an English C&icirc;teaux, and the reformers at St Mary's the first Cistercians reborn. Serlo remarks in Hugh's <span class="italic">Narratio</span> that he was an eyewitness of the events of 1132, knew the reformers by name and in person, came from their region, was related to some of them, and was brought up (<i>nutritus</i>) with them: the word used suggests that he was an oblate at St Mary's. If so, he did not continue as a professed monk after the age of fifteen (<i>c</i>.1123): when he entered Fountains <i>c</i>.1137 he twice remarks that he did so &#145;from the world&#146;. Serlo did not identify his relatives, nor is there any indication elsewhere. This might suggest that they were humbler members of the reforming party, who did not achieve abbatial office, but &#145;died as monks&#146;. This accords with what is not known about Serlo himself: he may have been in Archbishop Thurstan's party which catalytically visited St Mary's in October 1132, but he is not named then or later as a member of the archiepiscopal household&#151;he is not to be confused with the canon of York, Serlo, who was with Thurstan, and became one of the first important recruits to Fountains shortly before Serlo's own entry. He was not, as sometimes asserted, the brother of Abbot Ralph of Louth Park; he was not the author of poems on the battle of the Standard (1138) and the death of Somerled in an early Fountains manuscript; he is Gramaticus (<i>sic</i>) only in a sixteenth-century note on the reverse of the sole surviving medieval fifteenth-century manuscript of the <span class="italic">Narratio</span> which refers to John Bale's <span class="italic">Scriptores</span> (1559). His recollection of early Fountains is slight, and his ghosted centenarian memoirs had been prefigured at Byland by those of Roger, second abbot of that house.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_25098"></a><span class="headword">Serlo</span>  (<em>fl. </em>late 10th cent.), <span class="occ">monk</span>, of St Augustine's, Canterbury, himself a shadowy figure of uncertain career, achievement, and reputation, is the most far-fetched of namesakes who have been associated with Serlo solely on the basis of his illusory literary output.<br>
