<span class="headword">Cornwallis, Sir  Kinahan</span>  (1883&#150;1959), <span class="occ">diplomatist</span>, was born on 19 February 1883 in New York, the son of Kinahan Cornwallis, journalist and writer, and his wife, Elizabeth Dickinson Chapman, of Hartford, Connecticut. He was educated at Haileybury College and at University College, Oxford; he graduated with a second-class degree in jurisprudence in 1905, before going on to study Arabic. Cornwallis was a renowned athlete, representing Oxford against Cambridge at athletics for four consecutive years, and was president of the Oxford University Athletic Club from 1904 to 1906. On leaving Oxford in 1906 he joined the Sudan civil service. After postings in Khartoum and Kassala, his knowledge of Arabic and Arab affairs was recognized by the Egyptian government, which first borrowed him in 1912 for service in the ministry of finance, and then, in 1914, made him a permanent member of their civil service. He remained there for the rest of his career, being seconded at different times to the army, the foreign office, and the Iraq government. On 14 October 1911 he married Gertrude Dorothy Bowen (<i>d</i>. 1958), second daughter of Sir Albert Edward Bowen, first baronet, businessman and public servant. There were two sons and one daughter of the marriage, which was dissolved in 1925.<br>
<br>On the outbreak of war in 1914, Gilbert Clayton at general headquarters intelligence had Cornwallis commissioned in the Egyptian army and took him into his own office; in 1915 he became a member of the Arab bureau where D. G. Hogarth was then director. A year later he accompanied Hogarth and Ronald Storrs to Jiddah in order to confirm with Sherif Hussein of Mecca the outbreak of the Arab uprising against Ottoman rule; during the event one of Hussein's sons, Feisal, accompanied by T. E. Lawrence, led an Arab force alongside allied forces in the occupation of Palestine and Syria and, specifically, in the capture of Damascus in October 1918. Cornwallis succeeded Hogarth as director of the Arab bureau in 1916, and he took over as regular editor of the <span class="italic">Arab Bulletin</span>, a series of wide-ranging summaries of confidential information on the Arab world, to which he contributed <span class="italic">Asir before World War I: a Handbook</span> (1916). Lawrence immortalized Cornwallis in his <span class="italic">Seven Pillars of Wisdom</span> (1935) as being at this stage of his career:<blockquote>a man rude to look upon, but apparently forged from one of those incredible metals with a melting point of thousands of degrees. So he could remain for months hotter than other men's white-heat, and yet look cold and hard. (Lawrence, 58)</blockquote>Cornwallis inspired trust and confidence at all levels, while his kindness, courteousness, and innate leadership evoked the loyalty of all those who served him. Having become a lieutenant-colonel in 1916, he was awarded the DSO in 1917, and appointed CBE in 1919.<br>
<br>Cornwallis's appointment in 1919 as a political officer with the Egyptian expeditionary force occupying Syria marked the beginning of a long collaboration and close friendship with Feisal. While the allies gathered at the Paris peace conference, Feisal attempted to create an independent Arab state. However, as determined by an Anglo-French agreement in 1916, and by negotiations of the allies in Paris, British forces evacuated Syria in November 1919 and left France with a free hand to expel Feisal and establish mandatory rule. Feisal protested, and Cornwallis was assigned the task of persuading him to accept a compromise. When, the following year, an uprising in Mesopotamia persuaded British officials that its inhabitants were as determined to establish self-government as Britain was to reduce its military responsibilities, Cornwallis was deputed by Lord Curzon to offer Feisal a newly created throne at Baghdad. Feisal especially asked that Cornwallis accompany him on his journey from Jiddah to his new kingdom in June 1921. This attachment lasted for fourteen years, during which Cornwallis remained permanently in Baghdad at the ministry of the interior (where he exerted influence over the political administration and the military) and acted as a personal adviser to King Feisal. While the British mandate operated, Cornwallis helped construct the new state of Iraq: his great influence with the tribes and ruling members of the Iraq government enabled him to carry on the Iraq civil service originated by Sir Arnold Wilson with the aim of training Iraqis for independence.<br>
<br>Cornwallis also worked untiringly to bring about the Anglo-Iraqi treaty of 1930, which led to the independence of Iraq while safeguarding essential British strategic interests in communications and oil. British advisers clearly continued to exert much influence in independent Iraq, and the extent to which a precarious balance was maintained at that period between King Feisal, the Iraqi government, and the British authorities is surely a testament to Cornwallis's abilities. &#145;Among us&#146;, wrote Freya Stark, &#145;he held quiet authority which no one dreamt of gainsaying, made up of wisdom and kindness and courage&#146;  (Stark, 2). During these years Cornwallis's appointment as CMG in 1926, his knighthood in 1929, and his advancement to KCMG in 1933 underlined the recognition he received in London. After the signing of the treaty Cornwallis continued at Baghdad to advise on the workings of the new state, but King Feisal died in 1933 and was succeeded by his popular, though inexperienced, son, Ghazi I. Upon the admission of Iraq to the League of Nations in 1932, there followed continuous efforts on the part of the government to reduce both the number of foreign advisers and their influence; many contracts were simply not renewed. Cornwallis retired in 1935 and, as a special mark of the royal family's appreciation for his long and distinguished service, he was invested with the first class of the order of Rafidain (order of the Two Rivers) by King Ghazi. On 19 July 1937 he married, as his second wife, Margaret (Madge) Clark, only daughter of Harry Ralph Clark, of Lymington, Hampshire.<br>
<br>The outbreak of war in 1939 found Cornwallis in the Middle East division of the Ministry of Information. In April 1941 he returned to Baghdad as ambassador, in succession to Sir Basil Newton. He arrived at a critical period: an army coup had forced the regent and the pro-British politicians to flee the capital and had brought to power an apparently pro-axis government under Rashid Ali al-Gaylani. The status of the 1930 Anglo-Iraqi treaty was of immediate concern, and Cornwallis's first task was to demand that British troops be allowed transport through the country. Realizing that the new regime was widely supported, Cornwallis proceeded with caution; but when negotiations with Rashid Ali's government deteriorated, British military intervention duly restored power to the old ruling coalition. On 31 May an armistice was signed. When the mayor of Baghdad and two officers came to surrender, and asked that the independence of the country still be respected, Cornwallis is said to have replied:<blockquote>Many years ago I fought, together with King Feisal the lamented who was my friend, for the freeing of the Arabs, and together we built up the Kingdom of Iraq. And do you think that I would willingly see destroyed what I have helped to build? (Stark, 163)</blockquote>But the crisis through which Iraq had passed would have profound repercussions: the humiliation of being placed under British military occupation for the duration of the war played a formative role in the Iraqi revolution of 1958 and the overthrow of the monarchical regime which Cornwallis had done so much to foster.<br>
<br>Cornwallis, who was advanced to GCMG in 1943, remained as ambassador until March 1945. After returning to England he continued at the Foreign Office as chairman of the Middle East committee, and in 1946 he went with Lord Stansgate to Cairo on the commission to discuss a new Egyptian treaty; but ill health beset him and he retired altogether in that year. He died at his home, Castle Mill House, North Warnborough, near Basingstoke, Hampshire, on 3 June 1959. He was survived by his second wife and by the daughter and one son of his first marriage, his younger son having been killed in action in 1945.<br>
