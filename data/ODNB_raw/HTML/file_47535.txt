<span class="headword">Croft, Sir  Richard</span>  (1429/30&#150;1509), <span class="occ">royal official</span>, was the second son of William Croft of Croft Castle, Herefordshire, and of his wife, Margaret Walwyn. Croft's father and his elder brother, John, died in 1439, and John's posthumous daughter, Joan, in 1445, bringing him the inheritance of a modest but ancient estate. His guardian was Walter Skull. He had two younger brothers (possibly half-brothers), another Richard, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/47534/', "Thomas Croft (c.1435&#150;1488)")</script>. A sister, Agnes, married Philip Domulton of Brockhampton, near Bromyard, Herefordshire. A complaint by Edward and Edmund, sons of Richard, duke of York, of &#145;the odieux rule and demenying of Richard Crofte and his brother&#146; in 1454 has been cited as evidence that he was tutor to the future Edward IV, but the reference (possibly jocular) is more likely to the younger Richard  (Davies, 243). Croft is likely to have held a post on York's estates and to have fought for him at Ludford Bridge (12 October 1459). He was pardoned in December 1459 and appointed to administer York's forfeited estates. He rejoined York's cause after the battle of Northampton (10 July 1460), and fought for Edward IV at Mortimer's Cross (2 or 3 February 1461). About this time he married Eleanor, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Cornewall (<i>d</i>. 1519), widow of Sir Hugh Mortimer of Kyre, Worcestershire (<i>d</i>. between April and June 1460). Croft was JP in Worcestershire from 1464, and became sheriff of Hereford in November 1469. That appointment was confirmed by the restored Lancastrian government in October 1470, but not renewed in November. Edward IV on his return from exile reappointed him sheriff on 11 April 1471, and he fought at Tewkesbury. Tudor sources credit him with the capture of the Lancastrian prince of Wales, though they exonerate him from responsibility for the prince's death. He was knighted after the battle and was granted lucrative and important receiverships, most notably that of the earldom of March. He was a member of the council of Edward, prince of Wales, at Ludlow, and, probably from 1473, treasurer of his household. A later tradition names his wife as &#145;governess&#146; to the prince. He was MP for Herefordshire in 1478. Despite these connections with Edward V, Richard III appointed him treasurer of his household in May 1484. There is no record of his role in the Bosworth campaign, but his appointment as sheriff of Hereford, the grant of a seven-year farm of the royal manor of Woodstock, and reappointment as treasurer of the household, all in September&#150;October 1485, suggest an understanding with Henry Tudor. His bastard, Thomas, and his stepson, John Mortimer, fought for Henry, and his brother Thomas may have helped finance Henry's campaign.<br>
<br>Croft's rivalry with Sir William Stanley erupted into violence in Hereford and in the marches in 1487. He ceased to be treasurer of the household in 1494, but was steward of the household to Arthur, prince of Wales, by February 1495, until Arthur's death in 1502. He held the March receivership and other offices in Wales and the border counties until his death on 29 July 1509. He had accumulated sufficient land, from the profits of office and advantageous marriages, to establish his three surviving legitimate sons, Edward, John, and Robert, as landed gentlemen, to arrange good marriages for his five surviving daughters, and several granddaughters, and to make modest provision for his bastard's family. Croft's success was founded on a family solidarity which encompassed his brothers, bastard, and stepson, and indeed his former guardian, Sir Walter Skull, who, after the death of his own son, arranged a series of marriages to convey his property and a large part of that of his stepdaughters to the Crofts. Croft's wife, Eleanor, survived him until 1519. She was alleged to have headed an armed force of followers and outlaws during the feud with Stanley in 1487. She and her husband are buried in St Michael and All Angels Church, Croft, in a limestone tomb of fashionable Westminster workmanship, with effigies. Originally positioned in the north chapel, the tomb was relocated near the altar in the early eighteenth century.<br>
<br>Sir Richard should be distinguished from his brother, also Richard, who appears in the records as &#145;the younger&#146; before Sir Richard's knighthood, thereafter as &#145;esquire&#146;. He was closely associated with his younger, probably full, brother, Thomas. The younger Richard was probably the Richard Crofte of the letter of 1454 cited above, and may have been a clerk in the Ludlow household. After Edward IV's accession he gained lands and offices in Oxfordshire, was MP for the county (1472&#150;5), and esquire of the body from 1482. He lost his offices with the accession of Henry VII and died on 26 May 1502.<br>
