<span class="headword">Russell,  John Francis Stanley <span class="st"> [Frank]</span></span>, second Earl Russell  (1865&#150;1931), <span class="occ">politician, motorist, and litigant</span>, was born at Alderley Park, Cheshire, on 12 August 1865, the eldest of the three children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/24324/', "John Russell, Viscount Amberley (1842&#150;1876)")</script> (eldest son of the first Earl Russell, previously Lord John Russell), and his wife, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/41338/', "Katharine Louise (Kate) Russell, Viscountess Amberley")</script>, daughter of the second Baron Stanley of Alderley. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35875/', "Bertrand Arthur William Russell (1872&#150;1970)")</script>, who succeeded as the third Earl Russell, was his younger brother.<br>
<br>In infancy Russell lived at Rodborough Manor, near Stroud, Gloucestershire, owned by his paternal grandfather, and then from 1870 at Ravenscroft (now Cleddon Hall), above Trellech in the Wye Valley, Monmouthshire. There he did much as he wished, exploring the countryside barefoot and, in accordance with his parents' democratic ideals, played with the servants' children on equal terms. Both his parents were agnostics and Russell never attended church. Following his father's death in January 1876, he became Viscount Amberley. On his grandfather's death, in 1878, he became Earl Russell.<br>
<br>Although Russell's father had wanted his sons brought up as agnostics the boys were placed in the care of his mother, Countess Russell, and other relations at Pembroke Lodge in Richmond, Surrey, where he found the atmosphere of moral rectitude and piety, &#145;a nightmare&#146;; he ran away twice  (Russell, <span class="italic">My Life</span>, 33). He was educated by a succession of governesses and tutors until the age of twelve and then, in 1878, went to R. S. Tabor's School in Cheam, followed by Winchester College, where he spent four years. He entered Balliol College, Oxford, in October 1883, and though he never graduated he regarded his two years at Oxford as the happiest of his life. He voluntarily withdrew from the university in May 1885 after the master of Balliol, Benjamin Jowett, accused him of &#145;disgusting conduct in writing some scandalous letter&#146;  (ibid., 107). Russell denied wrongdoing and refused to be punished, but never entirely escaped the shame of the &#145;Oxford incident&#146;. He next lived with a tutor in a suburban semi-detached house in Hampton and made the first of two extended visits to the USA, where he made the acquaintance of Walt Whitman and George Santayana. He was the first Englishman Santayana encountered and the two became lifelong friends.<br>
<br>In his early twenties Russell moved to Broom Hall, Teddington. Building on his childhood interests in science and engineering, and experience gained as an adolescent when he helped electrify Hatfield House, he set up an electrical contracting business with the electrical engineer James Swinburne. He later established his own company with offices in Queen Victoria Street, works at Walham Green, and a branch in Cambridge. He found it difficult to compete, however, and after three years abandoned the enterprise at considerable financial loss. For many years he was chairman of the marine engineering firm Plenty &amp; Co of Newbury, and with varying degrees of success was associated with other businesses.<br>
<br>In 1890 Russell took up residence at Amberley Cottage on the Thames near Maidenhead. He intended it to be a marital home but his first wife, Mabel Edith Scott (1869&#150;1908), whom he married on 6 February 1890, left him exactly three months later, and never lived there. She was the daughter of Sir Claud Edward Scott, fourth baronet, and his wife, Maria Selina, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Burney. Protracted litigation followed the marital break-up, including demands for judicial separation and restitution of conjugal rights. In court in 1895 Russell found himself accused of an &#145;abominable offence&#146; with an unnamed male (actually a maths teacher called Herbert Roberts) and of &#145;disgraceful conduct&#146; with other men (Russell, <span class="italic">My Life</span>, 198 and 202; Moorehead, 45). He prevailed in most of these actions, but his demand for a judicial separation on the ground of his wife's cruelty was denied by the House of Lords in 1897  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 17 July 1897). When Mabel's mother, Lady Scott, libelled Russell, alleging sexual relations with men, Russell prosecuted her and two of her associates. They were convicted and sentenced to eight months' imprisonment (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 13 Oct 1896; 9 Jan 1897).<br>
<br>Following the <span class="roman">Local Government Act</span> of 1894 Russell was persuaded to stand for Cookham parish council, and was elected and made chairman. He then became a district councillor, serving as a Progressive, poor law guardian, and Berkshire JP. From 1895 to 1904 he also sat on London county council as a Progressive, initially for West Newington, then as an alderman. Russell served on several committees and took a particular interest in asylums. Admitted to Gray's Inn in 1899, he was called to the bar in 1905 and practised for about five years.<br>
<br>While still married to his first wife Russell met Mrs Marion (Mollie) Somerville (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Cooke). In 1899 they travelled to the USA to obtain Russell a divorce and lived at Glenbrook, Nevada, to fulfil the state's six-month residence requirement. Days after the divorce they married in Reno, even though Mollie was still married to her second husband, George Somerville. In May 1900 they returned to England and Russell persuaded Mabel, with a large financial inducement, to sue for divorce. In June 1901 Russell was arrested for bigamy on the ground that while his American marriage was valid, his divorce was not. He was tried by his peers in the House of Lords, convicted in July 1901, and imprisoned for three months in Holloway as a criminal of the first division, a status that afforded him numerous privileges. Russell thought his offence purely technical and his conviction &#145;hypocritical tosh&#146;; he believed he was victimized because he was a radical and an unbeliever  (Russell, <span class="italic">My Life</span>, 283 and 289). In 1911 he gained a free pardon. His second marriage was formalized at Holborn register office on 31 October 1901, three days after his divorce from Mabel.<br>
<br>Russell sat in the House of Lords for some forty-four years. At first he had little interest in the upper house though gradually became involved in committee work. In 1902 he introduced a bill which provided for divorce after one year's separation, provided consent was mutual. The Lord Chancellor &#145;danced with rage&#146; at this prospect and described the measure as an &#145;outrage&#146;, the peers unanimously denied it a second reading (Russell, <span class="italic">My Life</span>, 324; <span class="italic">The Times</span>, 2 May 1902). Undaunted, Russell persevered with the cause of divorce reform, not least through his Divorce Reform Society and as a witness before the royal commission on divorce and matrimonial proceedings (1912&#150;13). He also espoused such unpopular causes as prisoners' and Gypsies' rights, and during the war decried the brutal treatment of conscientious objectors. Lord Birkenhead thought him a fine debater, though when Santayana saw Russell in action he found him &#145;platitudinous and partial&#146;  (Santayana, <span class="italic">The Middle Span</span>, 75). Outside the Lords he proclaimed himself an &#145;ardent feminist&#146; and often addressed women's suffrage meetings.<br>
<br>Russell had a long-standing interest in motoring and spoke in the House of Lords on motoring matters as early as 1903 and consistently thereafter. He championed the motorist, whom he believed was over-taxed and victimized by the police, but also favoured severe penalties for drunk drivers. Motor cars appealed to his wanderlust and love of things mechanical. His first vehicle was a 2&frac12; horsepower Benz. In America he bought a Haynes-Apperson car which he shipped back to Britain. Many other vehicles followed and in 1924 he claimed to have driven over 200,000 miles  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 20 Feb 1924). As chairman of the London county council's highways committee he obtained the registration plate A1 after the <span class="roman">Motor Car Act</span> 1903 made licensing compulsory. He later relinquished it because it became too well known to the Surrey police, notorious for their speed traps. He joined the Automobile Club of Great Britain and Ireland (RAC from 1907) early in its existence, served on all its committees, and acted as a steward in the 1903 Gordon Bennett race. He also was prominent in the Automobile Association from its first days but resigned when it became too &#145;cautious and respectable and refused any longer to fight the police&#146; over speed traps  (Russell, <span class="italic">My Life</span>, 295). As a barrister he obtained many briefs through his motoring connections and defended many motorists. He also served with the army motor reserve.<br>
<br>In 1915 Russell's second marriage ended in divorce on the grounds of his desertion and adultery  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 13 July 1915). Mollie's &#145;price&#146; was &pound;400 a year for life which, after Russell's death, his brother was obliged to pay. On 11 February 1916 Russell married the widowed novelist <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35883/', "Elizabeth von Arnim")</script>, who had been his lover for several years. Before her wedding Elizabeth doubted the wisdom of proceeding, and almost immediately afterwards fled. Following a brief reconciliation she left for good in 1919, though there was no divorce. She left a hostile depiction of him and their marriage in her novel <span class="italic">Vera</span> (1921). All Russell's marriages were childless, though he acquired several step-children.<br>
<br>From 1921 Russell was an active supporter of Marie Stopes's Society for Constructive Birth Control and, as such, one of the earliest of its few aristocratic champions. For many years he was a member of the Fabian Society and Labour Party. In 1929 he was appointed under-secretary of state at the India Office and parliamentary secretary to the Ministry of Transport in the second Labour government (1929&#150;31). He distinguished himself as a delegate at the round table conference on constitutional reform in India in 1930&#150;31 and was responsible for piloting the <span class="roman">Road Traffic Bill</span> 1930 through the Lords.<br>
<br>As a youth Russell was tall and slim with &#145;abundant tawny hair&#146;  (Santayana, <span class="italic">The Middle Span</span>, 51), but in later life became &#145;a big burly man with a florid complexion and steel-blue eyes, who moved slowly and carefully&#146;  (Moorehead, 190&#150;91). From childhood he loved cats and dogs and one of von Arnim's reservations about marrying him was his habit of sleeping with seven dogs on his bed. After dabbling with Buddhism he jettisoned all religious belief. His biography, <span class="italic">My Life and Adventures</span>, appeared in 1923. He died on 3 March 1931 at the Hotel Noailles, Marseilles, while returning home from the French riviera where he had been recuperating from a severe attack of influenza. He had suffered from heart trouble for some time. After cremation at the St Pierre cemetery in Marseilles, his ashes were returned to England, where they were scattered on the Sussex downs near Telegraph House, Harting, which had been his home for some thirty years. There was no religious service and mourning was not worn. Though some of his business ventures were lucrative, by 1921 he described himself as &#145;bankrupt&#146;. He left his scanty personal effects to Amy Elizabeth Otter, his executrix, whom he had met at the London county council.<br>
