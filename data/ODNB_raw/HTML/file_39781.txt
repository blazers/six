<span class="headword">Day,  John Barham</span>  (1793&#150;1860), <span class="occ">jockey and racehorse trainer</span>, was born at Houghton Down, Hampshire, the son of John Day, a local trainer and racing adviser to George, prince of Wales, and his wife, Alice, daughter of a Mr Barham of Stockbridge, Hampshire. Little is known of John Barham Day's education save that from an early stage it took second place to his career as a lightweight jockey. Unusually small, Day was able to weigh in at 7 stone until he retired from race riding about 1840. He began riding at minor tracks near his father's stables. Fees were low as was the standard of the racing, but in 1826 Day was retained by the fourth duke of Grafton on the recommendation of his brother, Lord Henry Fitzroy. In that year Day rode the duke's horses Problem and Devise to win the Two Thousand Guineas and the One Thousand Guineas respectively, for which he was awarded a &pound;20 present and a lecture on the perils of suddenly acquired wealth.<br>
<br>As a lightweight lacking real strength, particularly in a close finish, Day was a useful rather than a great jockey. It was more as a trainer that he was known. In 1835, though still riding competitively, especially in big races, he began training at Danebury, 4 miles north of Stockbridge. The stable's remoteness and its inaccessibility to newspaper touts made it ideal for a trainer fond of a bet. The rewards open to the early nineteenth-century jockey and trainer were limited without recourse to the betting ring; Day's willingness to deceive not only bookmakers but also owners earned him the sarcastic nickname Honest John Day. His first significant patron was Lord George Bentinck who spent lavishly on Danebury in the late 1830s. The pair enjoyed considerable success, especially with the outstanding Crucifix winner of both the One Thousand Guineas and the Two Thousand Guineas and the Oaks in 1840, although their most characteristic success came in the 1836 St Leger with Elis. Beaten in the Derby, though heavily backed by his connections, Elis was a warm favourite for the final classic, his Epsom conqueror being an absentee. He was priced prohibitively in the betting ring. In 1836 it took about a fortnight to move a horse north to Doncaster and with only a week to go it was known that Elis was still with Bentinck and he began to drift in the market. His owner, however, had been busy constructing one of the first horseboxes, in which he managed to transport the horse to Town Moor in just three days. Elis won the race at 7/2, rather less than the price Bentinck and Day secured.<br>
<br>The association did not, however, last. Midway through the season of 1841 Bentinck discovered, thanks to some carelessly confused letters, that Day was deceiving him about the condition of one of his horses, the better to get a good price on it. With Bentinck gone to Goodwood, Day was left searching for another patron. The first men to fill the post are best known as the Danebury confederacy, a group of professional gamblers including the prizefighter-turned-legislator John Gully, Harry Hill, William Pedley, and Joshua Arnold. In his book <span class="italic">Reminiscences of the Turf</span>, Day's son <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32758/', "William Henry Day")</script> denies that his father knew anything of the activities of these men, but that is unlikely. The formal association, whatever its nature, was ended in 1845 when Day moved to Michel Grove, Findon, Sussex, to act as private trainer to the solicitor, money-lender, and erstwhile confederacy member, Henry Padwick. Day's eldest son, John (1814&#150;1882), took over work at Danebury while William was established as a breeder at Woodyates, Cranborne Chase, Wiltshire, at his father's expense. Day's time at Findon was not without controversy and in 1855 Padwick had to surrender Day's services on finding that his excellent colt St Hubert had lost the Two Thousand Guineas, for which he had been heavily backed, thanks to an arrangement with the trainer's son which allowed William Day's Lord of the Isles to triumph. Day was promptly evicted from Michel Grove and he spent the rest of his life as a guest at Danebury, where he died on 21 March 1860.<br>
<br>Day was known to be as hard on his horses as he was on their owners, always galloping them uphill, often in rugs and blankets. His regime of sweats, drenching, purging, and even bleeding, favoured tough horses and did result in heavy casualties. But Day believed in sending his horses to post fit and with little room for improvement; Danebury runners were unusually successful first time out. Both of his sons who took to training followed his methods. Day was twice married but nothing is known of his wives except that his first wife's name was Goddard. Of his twelve children, all from his first marriage, two more rode professionally: Alfred and Samuel, who won the St Leger on Mango.<br>
<br>Day is, however, significant as more than just an indication of how loose notions of &#145;honour&#146; could be on the nineteenth-century turf. Along with the Yorkshireman John Scott he was the first trainer to prove himself as a highly skilled professional, not just another groom. He demanded and secured a good wage from influential men too aware of his talent to be overly concerned by his dishonesty. For every patron who left Danebury in disgust, plenty preferred to stay, including Lord Palmerston, whose Iliona won the 1841 Cesarewitch. As the founder of a racing dynasty which later included among its members Lester Piggott, Day is also of some note.<br>
