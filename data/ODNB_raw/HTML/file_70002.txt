<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Gunsberg,  Isidor Arthur</span>  (1854&#150;1930), <span class="occ">chess player and journalist</span>, was born in Pest, Hungary, the eldest son of Abraham Gunsberg and his wife, Katharine, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Tapart. Records kept by Hungarian rabbis suggest that Isidor was born on 1 November 1854, but he himself believed his birthday was 2 November. Abraham Gunsberg (or G&uuml;nzburg) came to London in 1863 to establish a British agency for the Polish wine grower Count Zelinski, bringing Isidor with him. Family tradition and chess sources suggest that young Isidor spent much of four years in London and Paris before returning to Hungary in 1867.<br>
<br>Isidor Gunsberg was taught chess by his father, and he was noticed as a promising player in 1867 when they visited Paris during the international chess congress. In 1876 he settled permanently in England, soon becoming a regular player at Purssell's chess rooms and Simpson's Divan. He sometimes played matches for the chess team of the Jewish Workingmen's Club in Aldgate, alongside Abraham Mocatta (1830&#150;1900), an elder of the Sephardic Bevis Marks synagogue, and Edward Nathan Frankenstein (1839&#150;1913), the Liverpool-born chess problem expert, with whom he played several published games in 1877&#150;8. Like them he eventually became a member of the City of London Chess Club.<br>
<br>Gunsberg's big chance came in 1878, when the inventor Charles Godfrey G&uuml;mpel hired him as the secret operator of his Mephisto &#145;automaton&#146;, which was exhibited publicly in London and Brighton after it controversially won the Handicap tournament at the London 1878 meeting of the Counties Chess Association. Gunsberg continued in this role periodically until about 1884. From 1881 to 1883 he also contributed articles and games as Mephisto to the chess column of <span class="italic">Knowledge</span>, the magazine edited by R. A. Proctor.<br>
<br>In his first contest with a leading opponent Gunsberg played a match for &pound;10 a side in 1881 with Joseph Blackburne, who conceded him a two-game start. After losing the first two games Gunsberg began playing like a master and the score reached 6&#150;6 before Blackburne won the decider. The result in games actually played was 7&#150;4 with three draws. At the London 1883 chess congress, Gunsberg won a casual game against the Russian champion M. I. Chigorin and then took fourth prize in the secondary tournament sponsored by the maharaja of Vizianagaram, although this was soon followed by a discouraging result in his first international tournament, at Nuremberg in July.<br>
<br>That autumn Gunsberg wrote several articles on chess for Annie Besant's magazine <span class="italic">Our Corner</span> and in October 1884 he began a column in the <span class="italic">Weekly Echo</span>, which ran for about a year. He subsequently conducted several chess columns simultaneously in newspapers and periodicals. The most important were the <span class="italic">London Evening News and Post</span> (1889&#150;94), <span class="italic">St James's Budget</span> (1893&#150;1900), the <span class="italic">Penny Illustrated Paper</span> (1894&#150;1902), the <span class="italic">Manchester Guardian</span> (1906&#150;14), and the <span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span> (1899&#150;<i>c</i>.1929). He also spent three months in 1884 as coach to the Bradford Chess Club, and (probably through acquaintance with the chess amateur Wordsworth Donisthorpe) did office work for the Liberty and Property Defence League, for whom he wrote <span class="italic">Local Option: an Argument against Teetotal Tyranny</span> (1888), a reply to the prohibitionist MP W. S. Caine.<br>
<br>Gunsberg returned to master competition in the summer of 1885, swiftly establishing himself as a chess master by winning tournaments in London and Hamburg. In 1886 a convincing match victory against Henry Bird confirmed his new position among the &eacute;lite of British chess. After he beat Blackburne 8&#150;5 in a match in 1887 his main rival became Amos Burn, with whom he shared first prize in London after an indecisive play-off. Further master tournament victories followed in Bradford (1888) and London (1889, tied with Bird), although probably a greater achievement was taking third prize in the two-month marathon New York 1889 tournament, ahead of both Blackburne and Burn, and just behind the joint winners, Chigorin and Max Weiss. There he also won the best game prize for his win against the Irish-American master James Mason. Invited to play a match with Chigorin in Havana in 1890, Gunsberg tied it 11&frac12;&#150;11&frac12;. He then challenged the world champion William Steinitz to a title match, played in New York from December 1890 to January 1891, losing by the respectable margin 10&frac12;&#150;8&frac12;.<br>
<br>Subsequently Gunsberg concentrated chiefly on his journalistic work. The first edition of his book <span class="italic">Chess Openings</span> appeared in 1895 and it remained in print for over thirty years. He performed poorly on his comeback in the great 1895 Hastings tournament but in 1900 he achieved second prize in the City of London club's invitational. He competed in master tournaments for the last time at St Petersburg in 1914. After the First World War he only contested minor events. He also did organizational work, in particular running the Ostend 1905 and 1906 international tournaments, the latter being a large multi-stage event, and the 1925 international tournament at Marienbad (Mari&aacute;nsk&eacute; L&aacute;zn&#283;).<br>
<br>Gunsberg experienced many personal losses, outliving two wives, and these vicissitudes had an adverse effect on the later course of his chess-playing career. He first married Jane (1852/3&#150;1891), daughter of Asher Isaacs, textile dealer, in the Great Synagogue, London, on 16 November 1879. Three of the six children of this marriage died in infancy, but three sons survived. The eldest, Alfred Gunsberg (1884&#150;1968), assisted his father with his literary work. His first wife died from tuberculosis in May 1891. He married, second, at St George's parish church, Bloomsbury, on 16 December 1893, Miriam (1858&#150;1897), daughter of Thomas Clarke, merchant. With his second wife, a governess from a Humberside family, he had two daughters. She conducted a chess column of her own in the <span class="italic">Lady's Pictorial</span> for two years but she also contracted tuberculosis and died in September 1897. On 1 March 1898, at St Jude's parish church, Brixton, he married, third, Agnes Jane (1862&#150;1949), daughter of Peter Ramage, a Swedenborgian minister. They had one daughter, born in 1901.<br>
<br>Gunsberg habitually lived beyond his means: police investigations during his application for naturalization (obtained on 20 May 1908) revealed a long history of financial problems and defaults. His economic situation was aggravated in 1914, when most newspapers stopped their chess columns at the outbreak of war, but in 1916 he won &pound;250 in libel damages against Associated Newspapers. Several leading players testified that an <span class="italic">Evening News</span> article had unfairly criticized errors in his <span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span> problems. After the war life became no easier for an ageing master and in July 1923 he filed for bankruptcy. In 1929 a testimonial, raised for his seventy-fifth birthday, enabled him to be discharged from bankruptcy a few weeks before he died, of heart failure, at his home, 4 Woodfield Avenue, Streatham, London, on 2 May 1930. He was buried in Streatham Park cemetery.<br>
<br>Small of stature, Gunsberg retained his distinguished good looks into later life and was apparently always popular in the chess world. He was a hard-working man with a keen intelligence who, had his family and financial situation been less precarious, might have sustained a longer career as an international chess player.<br>
