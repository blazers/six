<span class="headword">Phelps,  John</span>  (<em>b. </em>1618/19), <span class="occ">government official and regicide</span>, was the second son of Robert Phelps (<i>d</i>. 1622), gentleman, of Salisbury, and his wife, Sarah. He matriculated from Corpus Christi College, Oxford, on 20 May 1636, aged seventeen, and entered the Middle Temple in 1641. He appears to have married Jane Birt at St Margaret's, Westminster, on 25 July 1642. His first employment seems to have been that of clerk to the committee of plundered ministers. On 26 December 1648 he was appointed clerk assistant to, and temporary replacement for, Henry Elsing, clerk of the House of Commons, and on 8 January he was selected as one of the two clerks of the high court of justice which sat to try Charles I. He read out the roll-call of the commissioners and the preamble of their authorization when the trial opened on 20 January and then took minutes of the proceedings [<i>see also </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/70599/', "Regicides")</script>]. The resulting journal of the court, presented by the judges to the House of Commons, was published by John Nalson in 1682.<br>
<br>In 1650 Phelps was called to the bar at the Middle Temple. On 14 October 1652 he was made clerk of the committee of parliament chosen to confer with the deputies of Scotland on the question of the union, and the committee for plundered ministers was asked to excuse his attendance in the meantime. He was employed as official note taker at the trial of the royalist plotters Vowell and Fox in 1654 and was also concerned in the 1658 trial of the plotters Slingsby and Hewitt. He acted as clerk to the restored Rump Parliament, from 7 to 14 May 1659. By these different employments he made sufficient money to purchase the fee of the manor and honour of Hampton Court in 1652, confirmed on 15 November 1653. He is recorded on the court roll as lord of the manor from 14 May 1652 to 2 June 1654. It was bought back from him when Hampton Court was set aside for the use of the protector. On 17 May 1654 the council of state authorized a repurchase payment of &pound;750, exactly what it had cost Phelps. The deed of sale was executed by Phelps on 27 June but the money was still due when the excise commissioners ordered it paid on 31 July 1655. He also leased Steventon rectory, Berkshire, part of the sequestered lands of the dean and chapter of Westminster.<br>
<br>At the Restoration the House of Commons included Phelps and his fellow clerk Broughton among the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/70599/', "regicides")</script>, and on 14 May 1660 voted their arrest. Prynne was ordered to secure all the public documents which were among Phelps's papers and his goods were also seized. On 9 June it was further voted that he should be excepted from the <span class="roman">Act of Indemnity</span> but with his punishment to be determined in the future by some penalty less than death, apparently in the hope that he would &#145;render himselfe&#146; and provide useful information  (Ludlow, <span class="italic">Voyce</span>, 167). Phelps, who had earlier warned Edmund Ludlow of the dangers of arrest, had already &#145;resolved to provide for his safety by going beyond sea&#146;  (ibid., 150). On 1 July 1661 Phelps was attainted in company with twenty-one dead regicides. He succeeded in evading all pursuit and in 1662 was in Lausanne with Ludlow, whom he may have supplied with documents. At the close of that year he and Colonel John Biscoe bought goods at Geneva and other places and resolved to make a livelihood by trading in Germany and the Netherlands. In 1666 Phelps appears to have been in the Netherlands, and his name was included in a list of exiles in enemy service summoned on 21 July to surrender themselves within a given time to the English government. The date of his death is unknown but he presumably died at Vevey where a memorial tablet was set up near his unmarked grave at St Martin's Church by American descendants in the late nineteenth century.<br>
