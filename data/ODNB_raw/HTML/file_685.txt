<span class="headword">Arnold,  Thomas</span>  (<em>c.</em>1742&#150;1816), <span class="occ">physician and mad-doctor</span>, was born about 1742 in Leicester, the second son of William Arnold (<i>c</i>.1695&#150;<i>c</i>.1770), a baker, who was also an eminent local Anabaptist and mad-house proprietor, and his wife, Sarah, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Freer (<i>d</i>. before 1760). Thomas probably worked under Richard Pulteney before preceding him to Edinburgh University, in 1762, where he studied under William Cullen and Alexander Monro, gaining his MD in 1766. On 20 July 1766 he married Elizabeth Graham (<i>d</i>. 1802) in Edinburgh. She was the sister of fellow student James Graham and sister-in-law of Catharine Macaulay. The couple had seven children, including Thomas Graham Arnold MD, father of Thomas Kerchever Arnold; William Withering Arnold MD; Henry Hamilton Arnold, theologian and writer; and Elizabeth Henshaw Arnold.<br>
<br>Arnold returned to Leicester in 1766 and took over his father's mad-house, which he later moved to larger premises at Belle Grove. In 1771 Arnold was appointed physician to the Leicester Infirmary. He resigned five years later following an inquiry which discovered mismanagement of the hospital's accounts. He nevertheless went on to become senior physician to the infirmary and its asylum in 1784. At the height of his power Arnold held a monopoly not only on the lunacy trade in Leicestershire, but also, together with his sons, of the post of physician at Leicester Infirmary. A supporter of radical causes, Arnold's career in Leicester was marked by his involvement in struggles for social status and political influence. Professionally many of these were with his main rival, James Vaughan, a high-church tory. Arnold was the first president of the Leicester Literacy Society, founded by the radical newspaper editor Richard Phillips, and in 1790 he chaired a public meeting of dissenters which resolved to campaign for the repeal of the <span class="roman">Test Acts</span>. Arnold was also noted for his cultural interests: he was a local patron of the arts, collected books, and enjoyed musical evenings. He married for the second time at St Mary's, Nottingham, on 28 March 1803; his second wife was Mary Davison (<i>d</i>. 1843), sister-in-law of Admiral Sandford Tatham.<br>
<br>Arnold's principal medical work is the two-volume <span class="italic">Observations on the Nature, Kinds, Causes, and Prevention of Insanity, Lunacy, or Madness</span> (1782, 1786), which ran to two editions and a German translation. In it he abandoned the traditional humoral theories, basing his classification on the ideas of Locke and separating disordered sensations from disordered reasoning. He helped to pioneer a new approach to insanity based on observed symptoms, but his classification was too detailed to be practical and it never became popular. Arnold is representative of a shift towards the &#145;moral&#146; treatment of the insane. Along with Samuel Tuke, he thought that patients should be treated as children rather than as brutes, and advocated that physical restraints should be used only on violent patients. Along with William Battie, he advised that the insane should be segregated from the outside world and recommended amusements and a simple diet for them. Arnold's other writings are: <span class="italic">A Case of Hydrophobia Successfully Treated</span> (1793) and <span class="italic">Observations on the Management of the Insane</span> (1809). A letter of his was published by Thomas Fowler among his <span class="italic">Medical Reports of the Effects of Arsenic</span> (1786). Arnold died in Leicester on 2 September 1816 and was buried there at St Margaret's Church on the 6th.<br>
