<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Hoddinott,  Alun</span>  (1929&#150;2008), <span class="occ">composer</span>, was born on 11 August 1929 at 3 The Avenue, Gilfach, near Bargoed, at the head of the Rhymney valley in Glamorgan, the son of Thomas Ivor Hoddinott (1899&#150;1974), elementary school teacher, and his wife, Gertrude, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Jones (1901&#150;1966). His father was a teacher in Bargoed but moved to a post in Penlle'r-gaer, near Swansea, where Hoddinott grew up and received his early education. By all accounts his was not a very musical family but his innate gift soon showed through so that by the age of four he was already taking violin lessons and exhibiting a fine command of that instrument, along with the viola, which he later played with equal virtuosity as a first-generation member (from 1946) of the National Youth Orchestra of Wales. These talents had been nurtured at Gowerton grammar school, where he also displayed a very marked aptitude for composition and an evident will to make this the main focus of his efforts rather than pursuing a career as a performing musician.<br>
<br>That decision set the course of his later years at Gowerton and led to the award of a composition scholarship at University College, Cardiff, where he graduated in 1949. His time there had witnessed the production of numerous apprentice scores, among them some large-scale orchestral, concertante, choral, and chamber works. A good number of these were performed locally and some received national broadcast premi&egrave;res. However, Hoddinott later withdrew most of them and re-assigned their opus numbers, feeling that these were indeed apprentice pieces and not representative of his mature style. It was during this period also that he developed the capacity for sheer hard work under pressure&#151;often in response to specific commissions or demands of circumstance&#151;that added to his later (not entirely welcome) reputation for working to very tight deadlines.<br>
<br>The one notable exception to Hoddinott's veto on those early works was his 1949 clarinet concerto, written and given its first (BBC studio) performance during his third year as a student at Cardiff. A revised version of this piece enjoyed wider success and critical acclaim at its first concert performance at the Cheltenham festival five years later, with Gervase de Peyer as soloist and the Hall&eacute; Orchestra conducted by Sir John Barbirolli. Still Hoddinott thought himself in need of further expert guidance and therefore, on completing his undergraduate studies, took a series of private lessons with the Australian composer and pianist Arthur Benjamin. At the same time he continued to establish his institutional and academic home base in Cardiff, having been appointed first to a post at the Welsh College of Music and Drama in 1951 and then, in 1959, to a lectureship at University College, where he remained until his retirement (and the conferment of emeritus status) in 1987.<br>
<br>Hoddinott's marriage on 2 April 1953 to (Beti) Rhiannon Huws (<i>b</i>. 1928), a schoolteacher (daughter of Llewellyn Caradog Huws, minister of Carmel Independent Chapel, Gwauncaegurwen) and Welsh speaker, was undoubtedly the single most important event in his personal life and another clear mark of Hoddinott's attachment to the formative culture of his youth. This was despite the fact (a source of friction at times) that he never came out as a Welsh nationalist composer and was apt to make a fairly polemical point of not subscribing to any strongly nationalist&#151;folk-based or other&#151;version of the Welsh musical renaissance. Indeed he later accepted a commission for Prince Charles's investiture as prince of Wales in 1969 and produced a brief fanfare for the marriage in 2005 of Charles and Camilla Parker-Bowles. On the other hand his music often took inspiration from Anglo-Welsh and Welsh-language sources, whether by way of texts to be set or material for treatment in dramatic or extended song-cycle form. Later he was often highly vocal in his criticism of funding agencies and cultural bodies, Welsh National Opera among them, that he saw as failing in their important (if not primary) task of promoting native Welsh music.<br>
<br>From the late 1950s Hoddinott's music began to lose something of the jaunty high spirits, jazzy inflections, and at times hard-edged neo-classicism that had marked his earlier style. Thereafter that style was increasingly displaced by elements of the sombre, predominantly dark-hued (some called it Celtic) character that typified his music of the next four decades, and which found its first expression in his orchestral piece <span class="italic">Nocturne</span> of 1955. Not that he ever lost touch completely with the temperamental sources of that previous, more extrovert manner, retaining as he did a craftsman's pride in creating various &#145;occasional&#146; works of a none the less inventive and technically resourceful kind. Like his close friend Alan Rawsthorne, Hoddinott combined an impressive versatility of style, language, and technique with a genuine capacity to produce music of a powerful and sometimes emotionally disturbing character.<br>
<br>This duality became something of a hallmark and continued to characterize his music throughout the long period of Hoddinott's tenure in Cardiff. Academically that period was punctuated by his promotion from lecturer to reader (in 1965) and then to professor and head of department in 1967, a sequence of advancements due in large part to his now well-established reputation as one of the most significant British composers of his generation. His university teaching was never a sinecure but continued to occupy a large part of his working day, so that much of his composing was done at night or during what time he could take off from an otherwise demanding workaday routine.<br>
<br>Despite this Hoddinott remained highly productive and diversified his output across the whole range of genres including symphonies, concertos, choral works, chamber music, piano sonatas, and operas. Though sensitive to any imputation of over-facility he was a fluent and highly professional composer who saw no sense in the romantic idea that the artist must choose between authentic self-expression or responding to commissions from soloists, orchestras, or funding bodies. The recording companies Argo, Lyrita, and Nimbus played a major role in promulgating Hoddinott's music from the mid-1960s on, as did the various festivals and annual events&#151;chief among them the Cardiff festival of music, co-founded in 1967 by Hoddinott with his friend the pianist John Ogdon&#151;where his own compositions often received a first performance. Through its offshoot, the Cardiff festival of twentieth-century music, which he launched in 1976, Hoddinott sought to acquaint audiences with developments across a wide range of present-day &#145;conservative&#146; and &#145;modernist&#146; idioms, as well as steering a middle course between the claims of nationalist and cosmopolitan allegiance. His more than twenty concertos&#151;inventively scored for a range of solo instruments and orchestral forces&#151;likewise reflect his capacity to work within broadly traditional forms while putting them to new and imaginative ends.<br>
<br>In the best-known works of his &#145;middle&#146; period, from the early 1960s to the late 1970s, Hoddinott's music combines an exploration of complex formal devices (such as double palindromes and occasional twelve-note rows) with a continuing adherence to tonality, albeit often deployed in adventurous and ear-stretching ways. Like Bartok&#151;undoubtedly a strong influence, along with others as varied as Hindemith, Stravinsky, Sibelius, and (most revealingly in this connection) Berg&#151;Hoddinott put tonality to use not only as a source of vivid local contrasts but also as a means of sustaining long-range structural coherence. Nowhere is this more evident than in the cycle of ten symphonies&#151;in many ways his crowning achievement&#151;where Hoddinott progressively refined and extended his techniques for integrating long-breathed, arching melodic lines with tightly organized thematic and motivic development. The best-known, nos. 3, 4, and 5, were products of Hoddinott's intensely creative middle years and exhibit his keen sense of formal proportion, along with his sharp ear for subtle shifts of harmonic and rhythmic emphasis.<br>
<br>Hoddinott composed over six hundred works ranging across every major musical genre&#151;among them, not least, six operas of a diverse and often decidedly heterodox character. As the work of a Cardiff-based (as well as more broadly Welsh) composer, Hoddinott's music, in conjunction with his other activities, academic, scholarly, performance-related, and administrative, did much to establish the existence of a distinctive musical culture in south Wales, possessed of a genuine national character but none the less open to wider sources of inspiration. These aspects of Hoddinott's achievement and legacy were recognized by, among many other honours, appointment as CBE in 1983 and the Glynd&#373;r award for outstanding contribution to the arts in Wales in 1997. A further accolade in 2008 was the naming of the Hoddinott Hall, an extension to the Millennium Centre in Cardiff Bay, the home base for the BBC National Orchestra of Wales. Hoddinott underwent a heart-valve operation in November 2007. He died of multi-organ failure at Morriston Hospital, Swansea, on 11 March 2008, and was survived by his wife, Rhiannon, and their son, Ceri.<br>
