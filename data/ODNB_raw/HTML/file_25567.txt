<span class="headword">Simms,  Frederick Walter</span>  (1803&#150;1865), <span class="occ">engineer and technical writer</span>, was the seventh of nine children of William Simms (1763&#150;1828), manufacturer of scientific instruments, and his wife Sarah, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Thompson (1767&#150;1834). He was born on 24 December 1803 in the parish of St Ann Blackfriars, London. Apprenticed about 1818 to Robert Wilmott, cabinet-maker, he was turned over to his father and completed his training in 1825. He then obtained a place on the Irish Ordnance Survey, and was soon promoted to be head of the computing department. After some years in Ireland, in 1829 he was appointed assistant astronomer at the Royal Observatory, Greenwich. While there he married, in the summer of 1832, Caroline Nutting (1804&#150;1846), whose elder sister was married to his elder brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25568/', "William Simms (1793&#150;1860)")</script>. Of their five children, only Frederick Walter (1835&#150;1891) survived into adulthood.<br>
<br>Simms was poorly paid at the observatory and took on other work, teaching, and adjusting ironships' compasses. He began technical writing and left the observatory to become assistant to Henry Robinson Palmer on the South Eastern Railway and other works in 1834. In 1837&#150;8 he visited Paris as an engineer of the Asphalte Company, to study the French method of working the preparation. His next employment was under Sir William Cubitt, then engaged in laying the South Eastern railway line. In 1842 he received the Telford medal from the Institution of Civil Engineers, which he had joined in 1838, for two papers on tunnelling which were based on his work for the South Eastern line. After working on railways in England and France, including the Bordeaux&#150;Cette line, he was appointed in 1845 consulting engineer to report to the East India Company on the advisability of constructing railways in India. The Indian climate proved too much for his health, and his wife died there. Furthermore, he was overruled as to the course of the East Indian line. At the end of his five years' engagement he declined reappointment and on his return to England was appointed consulting engineer to the London, Chatham, and Dover Railway. He was unable to deal with the stress of the post, and retired from professional employment.<br>
<br>In addition to his membership of the Institution of Civil Engineers, Simms was a fellow of the Royal Astronomical and Geological societies. His most significant achievement was as the author of several important engineering textbooks, which went into many editions. These included <span class="italic">A Treatise on the Principal Mathematical Instruments Employed in Surveying, Levelling, and Astronomy</span> (1834; 8th edn, 1860) and <span class="italic">A Treatise on the Principles and Practice of Levelling</span> (1837; 6th edn, 1875), which helped to promote his brothers' instruments. He edited part of <span class="italic">Public Works of Great Britain</span> (1838) for the publisher John Weale, and became involved in a subsequent copyright dispute. His <span class="italic">Practical Tunnelling</span> was the leading authority on tunnelling techniques of the time. For the last three and a half years of his life Simms suffered from heart disease. He died at his home, 50 Torrington Square, London, on 27 February 1865.<br>
