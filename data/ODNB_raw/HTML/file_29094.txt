<span class="headword">West,  Richard</span>  (<em>c.</em>1691&#150;1726), <span class="occ">lord chancellor of Ireland</span>, was the eldest son of Richard West, a London merchant. Some sources, including O'Flanagan, suggest that he was born in 1670, but a later date is more likely, since he entered the Inner Temple in 1708 and was called to the English bar on 13 June 1714. In April that year he had married Elizabeth (1692&#150;1748), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4061/', "Gilbert Burnet")</script>, bishop of Salisbury; they had a son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29095/', "Richard West")</script>, and a daughter, Molly.<br>
<br>In addition to the impeccable whig credentials derived from his marriage, West was clearly a man of remarkable legal ability, being appointed king's counsel after only three years of practice, on 21 October 1717. He was made a bencher of the Inner Temple in the following year, although on the understanding that he was to have neither chambers in the inn nor a claim to the office of treasurer. Also in 1718, he was appointed standing counsel to the Board of Trade. He was the first appointee to this important post, which made him a legal adviser to the government on matters concerning colonial trade.<br>
<br>While at the bar West published some political pamphlets, including <span class="italic">A Discourse Concerning Treasons and Bills of Attainder</span> (1716) and <span class="italic">An Enquiry into the Origin and Manner of Creating Peers</span> (1719), in which he argued in support of the 1719 <span class="roman">Peerage Bill</span>. These pamphlets &#145;attracted much notice, and gave him strong claims to Government patronage&#146;  (O'Flanagan, 39). Accordingly, West was returned in the whig interest for the Cornish borough of Grampound in a by-election on 13 March 1721, and for the neighbouring borough of Bodmin in the general election of 1722.<br>
<br>West appears to have been fairly active in parliament, speaking on matters as diverse as army increases and elections in the City of London. His most important political role was, however, as one of the managers of the trial of Thomas Parker, first earl of Macclesfield, in 1725. In a &#145;masterly&#146; speech  (Ball, 102), delivered on 11 May, he summed up the case for impeachment with great skill and vigour, and was scathing in his condemnation of the lord chancellor's corruption and avarice  (<span class="italic">State trials</span>, 16.1057&#150;80).<br>
<br>West's legal reputation was in no way dulled by his foray into politics. In 1724 he was considered for both the Irish chief justiceship of the common pleas and the recordership of London. In the end, however, he was appointed lord chancellor of Ireland, receiving his patent on 23 July 1725. Ball considers his appointment fully justified, describing him as &#145;a man of brilliant talents, of which he had given proof by a phenomenally rapid rise in his profession&#146;  (Ball, 102). Burke, on the other hand, says his only qualification for the post was that he was a &#145;pamphleteering partizan&#146;  (Burke, 119), although in the light of his previous legal and political successes this is clearly unfair.<br>
<br>It cannot be denied, however, that West's elevation owed much to his politics and to his friendship with Hugh Boulter, archbishop of Armagh. Boulter was strongly of the view that English dominance in Ireland could be maintained only by appointing men of English birth to the great Irish offices of state. Disconcerted by the recent appointment of Thomas Carter, an Irishman, to the mastership of the rolls, Boulter lobbied strenuously for the placing of an Englishman on the Irish woolsack. As a friend of Thomas Pelham-Holles, duke of Newcastle, and one of the three lords justices of Ireland, he exerted considerable influence on crown appointments, and so it was that West became head of the Irish judiciary.<br>
<br>West's brief tenure of the Irish lord chancellorship was fairly unremarkable, although he apparently acquired a considerable understanding of Ireland and her people, and &#145;he appears &hellip; to have given much satisfaction&#146; in the execution of his office  (Burke, 119). It was his duty, as head of the Irish courts of equity, to administer the Irish parliament's penal laws against Catholics. West had previously shown some sympathy with the plight of English Catholics. In 1723, for instance, he had twice spoken against a bill which sought to raise &pound;100,000 from Catholic subjects. This sympathy was also discernible in some of his judgments from the woolsack. Thus he ruled that under the statute 9 William III c. 28 there had to be a conviction before any property could be forfeited, and it was not unknown for him to deprive protestant plaintiffs of their costs where the action, though legally required to succeed, was plainly unfair. None the less, West was by no means a champion of the Catholic cause&#151;had he been, he would hardly have acquired high Irish office&#151;and some of his judgments reflect the protestant zeal prevalent at the time. Thus in <i>Leymore v. Burke</i> he held that:<blockquote>[the] Protestant who marries a Popish wife is a more odious Papist than a real and actual Papist in profession and principle &hellip; the Acts against the growth of Popery, expressing <i>every Papist or person professing the Popish religion</i>, &amp;c., take in and regard <i>constructive</i>, as well as <i>actual</i>, Papists. (Howard, 1.261)</blockquote>West continued his literary endeavours during his chancellorship, and in 1726 he published a tragedy, <span class="italic">The Hecuba</span>. It was performed at the Theatre Royal in Drury Lane, London, but was not well received, a fact attributed by West to the gods' intimidation of the actresses and audience.<br>
<br>West had been in office for less than a year and a half when he succumbed to &#145;a fever of the most malignant type&#146;  (Burke, 119). It was hoped to the last that he would recover, but after twelve days' illness he died in Dublin on the afternoon of 3 December 1726. Archbishop Boulter wrote that &#145;his death is very much lamented by all here, but especially by the lawyers, whose good-will and esteem he had entirely gained, by his patience, civility, and great abilities&#146;  (ibid.). He was buried in St Anne's, Dublin, on 6 December.<br>
<br>West's death gave rise to some suspicion, and there were rumours to the effect that his wife, having taken West's secretary John Williams as her lover, had poisoned her husband. The rumours were never substantiated, however, and in fact Williams went on to marry West's daughter. On his death, West left &#145;little more than would answer his debts on both sides of the water&#146;  (Cruickshanks), but through the exertions of Boulter and John Carteret, second Baron Carteret, a state pension of &pound;250 per annum was granted to his widow.<br>
