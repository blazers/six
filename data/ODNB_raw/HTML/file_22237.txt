</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Piers,  William</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1580, <em>d.</em> 1670), <span class="occ">bishop of Bath and Wells</span>, was born at South Hinksey, near Oxford, and baptized at All Saints, Oxford, on 3 September 1580, the son of William Piers, haberdasher and kinsman of John Piers, archbishop of York. He matriculated at Christ Church, Oxford, on 17 August 1599, graduated BA on 7 July 1600, and proceeded MA on 7 July 1603, BD on 5 July 1610, and DD on 27 June 1614. In 1609 James I gave Piers the living of Grafton Regis, Northamptonshire, but he resigned in 1611. Licensed to preach on 31 January 1612, he afterwards became chaplain to John King, bishop of London, who had himself been a chaplain to Archbishop Piers. Through him Piers received the livings of Northolt, Middlesex, in 1611, St Christopher-le-Stocks in 1615, and in 1618 the prebend of Wildlander at St Paul's Cathedral, where he was already a reader in divinity. He became a canon of Christ Church Cathedral, Oxford, in 1616, holding this and Northolt <i>in commendam</i> until 1632. He was a chaplain-in-ordinary to James I at least by 1621 and during Charles I's reign he was one of the Lenten preachers for 1631, 1633&#150;6, and 1639. He was also rostered for 1638 but was too ill to preach.<br>
<br>From 1621 to 1624 Piers was vice-chancellor of Oxford University and in that capacity he and other college heads charged Gabriel Bridges with &#145;false and offensive doctrine&#146; after he had preached a sermon advocating the Arminian doctrine of grace. In 1622 a sermon upholding predestination, by Immanuel Bourne, rector of Ashover in Derbyshire, was dedicated to Piers. These events suggest that at this date Piers had Calvinistic sympathies, and contradict Anthony Wood's comment that while he was vice-chancellor he was &#145;too officious against such that were then called <i>anti-arminians</i>&#146;, and thereby &#145;he gained the good will of Dr. Laud&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 4.839). Probably through the influence of Bishop John Williams, in 1622 he was appointed dean of Peterborough; he was consecrated bishop of Peterborough on 24 October 1630 and installed on 14 November. In his brief time there he provided an episcopal house for the diocese. He was translated to the see of Bath and Wells in 1632.<br>
<br>In contrast to his earlier stance, during the 1630s Piers, with Matthew Wren, was the most ruthless of all bishops in supporting the Caroline and Laudian church policies. Laud reported to Charles that Piers had taken great pains to see that all his majesty's instructions had been obeyed, and that &#145;a great reformation hath been wrought there by his care and industry&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 5.349). Piers relentlessly pursued the nonconforming clergy. In Peterborough he restricted lectures for the Kettering lectureship to those who conformed, hoping to win over from their more radical ministers the chief sponsor of the lectureship, Edward, Lord Montagu, and his clergy who were moderate puritans. In Somerset he exceeded the king's instructions of 1629 on curbing lecturing, as evident in his remark in 1635, &#145;I thank God that I have not one lecturer left in my diocese&#146;. On the grounds that &#145;they may cloak their secret meetings &hellip; under pretence of market business&#146;  (Davies, 153), he not only implemented Laud's instruction for catechizing to replace the afternoon lecture, but also suppressed sermons at evensong. There was also to be no instruction on the catechism, and clergy were punished whose only offence was to pray before and after catechizing. When the <span class="roman">Book of Sports</span> was reissued in 1633 Piers gave it his wholehearted support by excommunicating or suspending those clergy who refused to read it on Sunday mornings.<br>
<br>In 1633 Justice Richardson had reissued the order prohibiting the holding of wakes, and directed this order to be read in church at Sunday services in Somerset. Laud disapproved of this and sought the help of Piers, who collected the opinion of seventy-two ministers who favoured the wakes and recreation after the evening service as it kept the laity from conventicles and alehouses. Piers's own observation was that the people generally would not have these feasts repressed. They wanted to be with &#145;their kindred and friends once a year to praise God for his blessings; &hellip; and they said they would endure the judge's penalties rather than they would break off their feast-days&#146;. However, Piers believed that the real issue was that &#145;the <i>precise sort</i> disliked the feasts as they were held on Sundays which they regarded as the Sabbath&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 6.319&#150;20).<br>
<br>Piers was the first bishop in the Canterbury province to enforce the ruling from the St Gregory's case of 1633 that the altar be placed against the eastern wall or window and be railed in. He tried to implement Charles's statement that &#145;parochiall churches should be like the cathedrall churche&#146;. He believed that his parishes fell into two groups: &#145;those whom he spoke to and they no sooner obeyed; and others which refused at first but were soon quickly satisfied and then submitted&#146;  (Davies, 226), but this does not tally with the figures for 1636 when there were only 140 churches out of 469 which had conformed. Some may have been awaiting the outcome of the Beckington appeal to the court of arches: in that parish when the churchwardens, James Wheeler and John Fry, refused to obey Piers's order to move the altar he excommunicated them. Laud supported Piers and sentenced them to a year's imprisonment and acts of public penance. Piers sought out not only puritans but also recusants&#151;a list of those presented at his visitation in 1633 was sent to Laud. For the size of the county he believed that there were not many, and &#145;for the most part of mean condition&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 5.319).<br>
<br>As visitor of Wadham College Piers supported Laud's reform for Oxford University. In 1633 he wrote to the college reproving the fellows for their dissension in the recent elections, and suggested that the officers he nominated be accepted. After his visitation in the same year he issued a series of injunctions to enforce discipline and order, and these were updated in 1637. Phyllis Hembry described Piers as &#145;meticulous, orderly, [and] a little mercenary&#146;  (Hembry, 227). He took his predecessor at Bath and Wells, Walter Curll, to court even though he himself was called to account by John Cosin at Peterborough for money which should have been spent on repairs to the cathedral. Piers paid careful attention to the accounting of his estates and kept a notebook of all income from leased and rented property. As a result of his astuteness he gained a considerable income which was augmented after the Restoration.<br>
<br>Piers was also an able administrator and held commissions in local government. As sheriff of Somerset in 1637 he dealt with disputes over payment of ship money, and when inhabitants of Wells Cathedral close, which by charter had its own liberty, requested exemption from this tax, Piers refused. His attempts to impose his authority on the dean and chapter led to accusations that he had wanted to take from &#145;the Dean and Chapter their rights by charter from the crown&#146;, and complaints that canons were cited for small misdemeanours. However, when parliament attacked cathedrals in 1640 Piers managed to patch up the dispute  (TNA: PRO, SP 16/459/45).<br>
<br>By 1640 Piers had alienated many of the Somerset gentry. For example, he clashed with Sir Francis Popham, patron of the parish of Buckland St Mary, when he appointed his own son, William, as the incumbent upon its vacancy in 1636. The articles of accusation against Piers presented to the House of Commons on 24 December 1640 also reflect this alienation. They concluded by denouncing him as a &#145;desperately prophane, impious, turbulent Pilate&#146;  (<span class="italic">Articles of Accusation</span>, 8). Yet from the Tower, Laud had stated that Piers had done nothing &#145;but what became an obedient <i>Diocesan</i> to his <i>Metropolitan</i>&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 3.243). Piers was impeached on 30 December 1640 and imprisoned. Later, he was reimprisoned in the Tower, with eleven other bishops who had petitioned the king against legislation being passed in the House of Lords during their absence. While there he preached two sermons, on Sunday 20 January or February, and 24 April 1642, telling his fellow bishops that &#145;every child of God must have some affliction to humble himself and call him home to God&#146;. However, there was a remedy for affliction&#151;prayer, and receiving God's grace which &#145;is an ever-flowing fountain&#146;  (Pierce, <span class="italic">Sermon</span>, 6, 7, 11).<br>
<br>When released Piers retired to Sunbury, Middlesex, until the death of his wife, Anne, about 1655. Later, in his will, he gave &pound;20 to St Mary, Sunbury-on-Thames, for silver altar plate in her memory. Piers then retired to Denton, near Oxford, where he married a much younger woman, Mary. At the Restoration, Piers had his episcopal see restored to him but its palace was in need of repair. He subsequently spent &pound;5000 on it and &pound;400 on the cathedral's repairs, but his wife persuaded him to retire to Walthamstow in Essex  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 4.840). His elder son from his first marriage, William, a clergyman, received prominent positions in the Bath and Wells diocese from his father, while the younger, John, was a lay prebendary at Wells Cathedral.<br>
<br>In 1668 Piers was involved in a dispute with the warden and fellows over the dismissal of a disorderly student at Wadham. Piers's sympathy with the student brought disapproval from the chancellor, Archbishop Sheldon, who chided him for not supporting the college. Eventually Piers backed down, informing Sheldon that he would do whatever his grace thought &#145;was just for him to do&#146;  (Wadham MS 2/1, fols. 132&#150;46). Piers died at Walthamstow, aged ninety, the oldest bishop in Christendom, and was buried in the parish church there on 19 May 1670. He was survived by his wife, Mary, who inherited most of his properties.<br>
