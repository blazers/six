<span class="headword">Daniell <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Drake]</span>,  Louisa</span>  (1808/9&#150;1871), <span class="occ">philanthropist</span>, was orphaned soon after her birth. She married Captain Frederic Daniell of the 18th Madras native infantry; they had two children before he died at Kotagiri on 3 April 1837. On returning to England she lived primarily in the midlands, educating her son, Frederick William, at Rugby School. Her daughter, <a name="cosubject_50746"></a><span class="headword">Georgiana Fanny Shipley Daniell</span>  (1836&#150;1894), <span class="occ">philanthropist</span>, born on 20 May 1836 in India, was sent to a school in Brighton. Distressed by the sight of so many vagrants (reportedly 14,000 a year) passing through Rugby, Louisa Daniell established missions for the destitute in the neighbourhood. Over five years she established five village missions, often with financial endowments from local noblemen: reading rooms were opened, religious tracts distributed, and <span class="roman">Bible</span> reading and sewing classes held. Her basic aims were to save souls and counteract the spread of Roman Catholicism.<br>
<br>Through this work Louisa Daniell came in contact with the County Towns Mission Society, the secretary of which, a Mr Wilson, urged her to direct her missionary zeal towards Aldershot. By the early 1860s Aldershot had a garrison of nearly 15,000 soldiers. These soldiers had few recreational facilities other than eighteen canteens on site and the twenty-five public houses and forty-seven beer houses that had been built around the camp, many of which were public brothels (approximately one-third of the soldiers were hospitalized each year with sexually transmitted diseases). Aldershot, argued Mrs Daniell, was &#145;one of Satan's strongholds&#146;  (Daniell, 26)&#151;a camp and town desperately in need of spiritual uplift. The Wesleyan Methodist Charles Henry Kelly had already opened the first soldiers' home in a small basement club-house in Chatham in 1861, but Mrs Daniell had access to more substantial funding. Supported by some of the great evangelical philanthropists&#151;the third earl of Shaftesbury, Lord Kinnaird, Stevenson Blackwood, and Robert Baxter&#151;she opened her first soldiers' home in October 1862. Baxter, Lord Radstock, and Captain E. Gardner Fishbourne RN, shared the weekly services and joined the trustees who had agreed to back the foundation of her more permanent Mission Hall and Soldiers' Home and Institute. Begun on 11 February 1863, the hall was officially opened on 11 October 1863. It eventually had a lecture hall seating up to 500 for services, a tea and coffee bar, a smoking and games room, a reading room with newspapers, and a lending library, as well as a classroom capable of holding 150 people, and several bedrooms.<br>
<br>Mrs Daniell and her daughter, Georgiana, who continued her work, regarded their task as primarily a spiritual one. Every evening, save for the weekly temperance meeting, they organized hymn singing and scripture talks in the classroom, with Sunday evening services in the hall. They also founded a mothers' meeting, a women's missionary working party, and a Band of Hope for service children. Yet their activities had a greater social impact at a time when the state (as distinct from some individual regiments) provided relatively few recreational and educational facilities for the rank and file. For those soldiers who were undeterred by the evangelical piety and by the strict prohibition of alcohol, the homes provided respectable meeting places and centres where they could repair deficiencies in their education. For soldiers' and pensioners' wives, the sewing classes taught them a skill from which they could earn as much as 3 to 4<i>s</i>. a week by the late 1870s, while the weekly savings club enabled them to put money aside for clothes, shoes, bedding, and coals. Women married &#145;off the strength&#146; (and so denied free quarters) received charity and visits from the <span class="roman">Bible</span> women of the Aldershot Mission Hall Soldiers' Wife Aid Society, founded a few years before Mrs Daniell's death.<br>
<br>Both Louisa and Georgiana Daniell were convinced that these activities contributed to improving standards of behaviour within the army. In this respect, they invested great hopes in the Total Abstinence Society, established soon after the opening of the hall in 1863. Within a year the society had 500 members and, although many lapsed either temporarily or permanently, it continued to hold regular meetings, monitored its numbers on a weekly basis, and later awarded medals for those who kept their pledge. If these endeavours hardly transformed morals within the army as a whole (for many men were driven away by the proselytizing and the temperance regime), they may have contributed to the improving standards of behaviour within the army in the later nineteenth century.<br>
<br>After Mrs Daniell died from breast cancer in Great Malvern on 16 September 1871 Georgiana continued her work, opening homes at Chatham, Weedon, London, Colchester, Manchester, Windsor, and Plymouth. For another twenty-two years she laboured on behalf of ordinary soldiers, and their wives and children, and also promoted foreign missionary activities. She earned the sobriquet the Soldiers' Friend, and her initiatives were replicated in Ireland by Elsie Sandes, who opened the first soldiers' home at Tralee in 1877, and by some churches. The state moved in a similar direction, building barracks towards the end of the century with many more recreational facilities for the other ranks. Georgiana Daniell died unmarried in the Mission Hall and Soldiers' Home, Aldershot, after a protracted illness brought on by influenza, on 24 June 1894. On 29 June her coffin was carried on a gun carriage for burial in the military cemetery at Aldershot, at which her mother's remains had earlier been interred on 26 September 1871.<br>
