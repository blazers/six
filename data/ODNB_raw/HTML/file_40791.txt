<span class="headword">Smith,  Robert William  Innes</span>  (1872&#150;1933), <span class="occ">physician and medical historian</span>, was born at North Bridge, Edinburgh, on 26 December 1872, the eldest of the three sons of William Smith (1848&#150;1931), chemist and inventor, and his wife, Louisa Selina Campbell-Colquhoun (1847&#150;1923), daughter of John Ferguson of the Lairg, Glenledknock, Perthshire. At birth his father gave him the name of Innes (referring to his own coheiress great-grandmother, a descendant of the twelfth chief of clan Innes). He used Innes as part of his surname from 1895.<br>
<br>Smith was educated in Edinburgh at Daniel Stewart's College and graduated MB CM at Edinburgh University in 1894. He qualified MRCS, LRCP, London, in 1900. He spent a period on postgraduate work at Ancoats Hospital, Manchester, and then at King's College Hospital, London, and gained his MD degree at Edinburgh in 1902. In 1896 he married Blythe Simpson Chalmers (<i>d</i>. 1957), with whom he had four children.<br>
<br>Innes Smith spent almost all of his professional life in Sheffield, in general practice. However, he also became surgeon to the major steel firm of Vickers Sons and Maxim Ltd, and was much called upon there and elsewhere as a result of the expertise he had developed as a medical referee not long after the <span class="roman">Workmen's Compensation Act</span> of 1897. At that time, in heavy industry in particular, both management and the workforce were having to adapt to the deep social impact of that act. Because of his special skill Innes Smith was called as an official witness in 1907 at the hearing of the royal commission on the poor laws and relief of distress. He was the moving force behind the initiation of the Sheffield Works Ambulance Movement, having shown that the severe injuries sustained by employees in heavy industry could justify a large firm in running its own ambulance. He was also an Admiralty surgeon for twenty years, a fellow of the Royal Society of Medicine, and a member of the Sheffield Medico-Chirurgical Society; and he was involved in many charitable organizations, becoming honorary secretary (later president) of the West Riding Medical Charitable Society and vice-president of the Royal Medical Foundation of Epsom College, for whom he raised large sums of money.<br>
<br>Throughout his dedicated and busy life Innes Smith took the keenest interest in medical history, and in 1927 he was vice-president of the section of the history of medicine at the 95th annual meeting of the British Medical Association. He wrote monographs on Sir John Eliot MD and on Dr James Mounsey of Rammerscales. He felt that insufficient credit had been awarded to Mounsey as a result of his being confused by some with the eccentric physician Messenger Monsey. Conceived during a period of illness, Innes Smith's <i>magnum opus</i> was <span class="italic">English-Speaking Students of Medicine at the University of Leyden</span> (1932), which was well received internationally at the time of its publication and which remained the standard reference work in its field. In addition to its valuable introduction, the compilation provides the names of about 2000 medical figures, usually with brief, well-researched biographical notes. The groundwork for his Leiden book also provided almost as many names of English-speaking medical practitioners who had attended other European universities. This manuscript listing was at its most developed for Padua, and less so for Rheims and Utrecht; additionally it included such student names as Innes Smith could obtain from Angers, Basel, Bologna, Bourges, Caen, Cahors, Ferrara, Franeker, Groningen, Harderwyck, Helmstadt, Montpellier, Orange, and Pisa. The records for twenty-one other universities had held no English medical names.<br>
<br>Ill health prevented Innes Smith from completing a further work from any of these concurrent researches. He died of cancer at his home, Totley Brook Road, Dore, Sheffield, on 28 April 1933, survived by his wife, and was buried in Crookes cemetery, Sheffield. His scattered manuscript notes, which comprise about 1500 medical names, remained in the archives of the Royal College of Physicians, London until they were collated and published posthumously in 1996, in computer readable form together with several bound printed sets in hard covers under the title <span class="italic">English-speaking students of medicine at continental universities: the work archive of R. W. Innes-Smith</span>. He was also the biographical subject of a FitzPatrick lecture of the Royal College of Physicians (London).<br>
<br>When his posthumous work is included Innes Smith's biographical listing has provided the best available details of medical students during those centuries when British students often had to go abroad if they sought university medical education, owing to the poor state of medical teaching at home. Innes Smith also collected <i>carmina</i> (laudatory verses) composed between 1650 and 1654 by English-speaking students, usually in Latin, in honour of the anatomist and surgeon Antonio Molinetti of Padua. A critical analysis of these <i>carmina</i> and a critique of the genre of these fashionable poems have since been published.<br>
<br>Innes Smith amassed one of the largest collections of prints of medical portraits in private hands, and in so doing he effectively illustrated his uncanny gift for remembering and being able to identify a likeness. This helped him to recognize an important portrait of Sir Charles Scarburgh which had been wrongly identified, Scarburgh having been royal physician to Charles II, James II, and Queen Mary. He bought the portrait and presented it to the Royal College of Physicians (London). Most of his iconographic collection of prints and engravings has survived and is in the care of Sheffield University, together with a part of his extensive library on medical history.<br>
<br>During his lifetime Innes Smith's research led to articles in the <span class="italic">Edinburgh Medical Journal</span> and to shorter submissions or notes to the <span class="italic">British Medical Journal</span>, <span class="italic">The Lancet</span>, and the <span class="italic">Proceedings of the Royal Society of Medicine</span>. After his death Sir Henry Wellcome asked for his cap, gown, microscope, and other items, for the Wellcome Museum.<br>
