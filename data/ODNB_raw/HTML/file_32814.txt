<span class="headword">Read,  Grantly  Dick-</span>  (1890&#150;1959), <span class="occ">obstetrician and promoter of natural childbirth</span>, was born at Beccles, Suffolk, on 26 January 1890, the son of Robert John Read (1851&#150;1920), a flour miller of Norwich, and his wife, Frances (Fanny) Maria Sayer (1855&#150;1942), of the White House, Thurlton, Norfolk, which had been in the family since 1704. Dick-Read (the hyphen was assumed in 1958) was the sixth of seven children and the second of three brothers. An unexceptional student but a good athlete, Read went from Bishop's Stortford College to St John's College, Cambridge. After obtaining a third class in part one of the natural sciences tripos in 1911 he became a clinical medical student at the London Hospital, where he came under the influence of Eardley Holland, one of the outstanding obstetricians and gynaecologists of his day. He also worked under the neurologist Sir Henry Head, whose research into pain influenced Read.<br>
<br>Less than a year after Read's arrival at the London Hospital he began treating the sick in some of the poorest areas of London. On one such visit he entered a small, damp, and poorly lit room in Whitechapel and delivered a woman of her first child. He recounted this event in his unpublished autobiography:<blockquote>As the baby's head made its appearance at the outlet of the birth canal and the dilatation of the passage was at a stage where I felt there should be discomfort and pain, I tried to persuade my patient to let me put the mask over her face so that she could inhale some chloroform. But the girl refused the mask, saying that she had no need of this help.</blockquote>Later, as he was preparing to leave, he asked the woman why she refused assistance and she responded: &#145;It didn't hurt. It wasn't meant to, was it Doctor?&#146;  (Dick-Read, 2.20&#150;21). This became his favourite story. It was also a turning point in his medical career, and although he came to influence women around the world he remained on the fringe of the medical profession.<br>
<br>Read qualified in 1914 and immediately joined the Royal Army Medical Corps. While serving in Gallipoli he was badly injured and after recuperation served out the war in France. At the end of the First World War he returned to Cambridge University to assume a research post, and for a brief time he was demonstrator in pathology. He received his MD from Cambridge in 1920 and then spent a short time in private practice in Eastbourne before moving his practice to Woking with consulting-rooms in Harley Street, London. In 1921 he married Dorothea (Thea) Cannon (1899&#150;1978), daughter of Neville Cannon, flour miller, of Bexley, Kent; they had two sons and two daughters.<br>
<br>Read's first book, <span class="italic">Natural Childbirth</span>, was published in 1933. But his most famous and popular book was <span class="italic">Revelation of Childbirth</span> published in 1942. It was published in the United States as <span class="italic">Childbirth without Fear</span> in 1944. He wrote at least eight books and more than forty articles in support of the fear&#150;tension&#150;pain theory, and his books were translated into Dutch, Danish, German, Swedish, Italian, French, Afrikaans, Norwegian, Portuguese, and Spanish. As a result, from 1933 until his death in 1959 he received an avalanche of correspondence from women in Britain and the United States, as well as from the European countries, South America, and South Africa, suggesting that his ideas had worldwide influence on how women were having babies. In these works Read introduced the concept that relaxation at the onset of labour was the most effective means of experiencing a conscious, joyful, childbirth in 95&#150;7 per cent of cases. He wrote that informing and educating women on what was happening to their bodies during pregnancy and labour would enable them to relax. Relaxation, he contended, would eliminate the fear and the tension brought on by lack of knowledge. As a result, if a woman felt pain it would not be significant enough to require drugs.<br>
<br>Read wanted to become a member of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists but refused to sit for the required examination. However, the college offered him an opportunity to open a clinic in London in which he could put his natural childbirth theories into practice. He was offered a building suitable for delivering pregnant women and for teaching his methods of natural childbirth. Dissatisfied with the condition of the premises and their location in an area away from the major London hospitals, he turned down the offer and accused the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of professional jealousy. Read had an obstinate professional attitude, which contributed to his being an outcast among his peers. This led him to popularize his childbirth theories by appealing directly to the public and further alienating himself from the medical establishment. His former teacher and mentor, Sir Eardley Holland, brought this to his attention in a letter in 1949:<blockquote>I would urge you, though, with respect, to take more thought to win the sympathies of the Profession as distinct from the Public, and give more time and take more trouble in doing so. &hellip; you seem to have alienated the sympathies of the &hellip; Gynaecological world. Have you even considered that you yourself may be to some extent to blame for that&#151;sad state of affairs? You have sometimes tried even me very severely! (E. Holland to G. D. Read, 8 Jan 1949, Wellcome L., PP/GDR/D.150)</blockquote>There is no indication that Read took this advice. In fact, his longed-for recognition in his own country and public honours from his peers and colleagues continued to elude him.<br>
<br>In 1948 Read moved his practice to South Africa. After a lengthy legal battle with the government over his licence to practise medicine he attached himself to a hospital on the outskirts of Johannesburg, the Marymount Maternity Hospital, run by Dominican nuns. Four years after arriving in South Africa he obtained a divorce from his first wife, and married in 1952 Jessica Beatrice Bennett, daughter of Leigh Cosart Winters, a businessman; he adopted her two sons.<br>
<br>In 1954 Read concluded that his work in South Africa had been completed, and, with his family, set out on a safari. His aim was to observe non-Westernized African women giving birth in their natural environment. At the end of this journey, which covered 6000 miles, he was totally satisfied that what he had said all along was true: Western civilization was responsible for the destruction of normal, natural childbirth.<br>
<br>On returning to England in 1954 Read was no longer in practice but maintained a high public profile through his worldwide lectures. He considered one of the greatest moments of his later life to be in 1956, when the pope granted him an audience and presented him with the silver papal medal for his work on natural childbirth. Also in 1956 his long-playing record of a woman experiencing natural childbirth was released and the film he made of four women giving birth naturally before he left South Africa was shown on BBC television in 1957. In 1957 and 1958 he engaged in a strenuous and lengthy lecture tour in the United States. Dick-Read died after a short illness at his home, Heronby, Beech Road, Wroxham, Norfolk, on 11 June 1959, and was buried at Eaton cemetery, Norwich, following a funeral service at St Andrew's Church, Eaton. A memorial service was held at St Martin-in-the-Fields, London, on 8 July 1959. He was survived by his wife.<br>
