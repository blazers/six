<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Young,  Hugo John Smelter</span>  (1938&#150;2003), <span class="occ">journalist</span>, was born on 13 October 1938 at 9 Shearwood Road, Sheffield, the eldest of the five children of Gerard Francis Young (1910&#150;2004), engineer and industrialist, and his wife, Diana Graham, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Murray (1915&#150;2012), daughter of Charles Graham Murray, general practitioner. His father held many posts of public service, including high sheriff of Hallamshire, lord lieutenant of south Yorkshire, pro-chancellor of Sheffield University, and member of the Prices and Incomes Board and Top Salaries Review Body.<h2>
<a name="Earlylife"></a>Early life</h2>Family business and family religion defined Young's childhood. The business&#151;the Tempered Spring Company&#151;was one of Sheffield's most respected specialist steel manufacturers (and its chairman, his father, one of Yorkshire society's most prominent figures). The religion&#151;Roman Catholicism&#151;made schooling at Ampleforth College a natural and hugely influential choice. Young, like his father and grandfather, another Smelter Young, went through all Ampleforth's stages: from Gilling Castle to Junior House to St Bede's House where, in 1955, Father Basil Hume was appointed housemaster. Hume promoted Young his first head of house and the two forged a close, natural friendship that lasted until Cardinal Hume's death in 1999. The Benedictines of Ampleforth, then as now, saw teaching as a &#145;moral undertaking&#146; where truth and faith dictated &#145;a sense of humble searching together for what is valuable, and an awareness of the quality of goodness in a life&#146;  (http://www.ampleforth.org). In his later writings Young always seemed aware of those precepts, which lent his prose a distinctive moral tone.<br>
<br>Young finished his schooling as head monitor and proceeded to Balliol College, Oxford, to read law. He was already a compelling figure: tall, ramrod straight, and precise, somehow graver and older than his years, with no trace of the accent of his native county. Fellow students thought of him as a high court judge in waiting&#151;and his interest in the bar and the workings of law remained manifest through many later articles&#151;but it was journalism in general and politics in particular that rapidly came to absorb him. He joined the student newspaper, <span class="italic">Cherwell</span>, and swiftly became its deputy editor, producing twice-weekly columns that surveyed the national as well as the university scene and sought unequivocally to distinguish right from wrong. Young at twenty-two and Young at sixty-two shared the same taste for the magisterial. He was always serious in tone and clear in judgement. Though personally often amusing company, he seldom allowed himself to experiment with humour in print.<h2>
<a name="FromOxfordtoFleetStreet"></a>From Oxford to Fleet Street</h2>Young's career path was already obvious when he left university with a second-class degree in jurisprudence in 1961. He got a trainee job on the <span class="italic">Yorkshire Post</span>, which gave him a grounding in all aspects of editorial work, and then, in 1963, won a Harkness fellowship to the United States, an experience he used the following year to secure a congressional fellowship on Capitol Hill. He learned the fundamentals of journalism and the lessons of raw politics viewed in close focus very early on. He was already a high flier. It was natural that in 1965, still only twenty-six, he should move to the <span class="italic">Sunday Times</span>, a rich and influential paper about to experience its golden age under the editorship of Harold Evans from 1967 to 1981. He became chief leader writer in 1966, and on 15 October the same year married a thirty-year-old fellow journalist, Helen Mason (<i>d</i>. 1989), daughter of James O'Brien Mason, schoolmaster. They had three daughters and one son.<br>
<br>Young remained with the <span class="italic">Sunday Times</span> until 1984, having become political editor, with column-writing responsibilities, in 1973. Though he enjoyed political reporting and, in the <span class="italic">Sunday Times</span> fashion of the time, helped produce several instant books on big political stories of the day, his interest was always more in declaring what ought to happen rather than examining what had already happened: the column was his natural habitat. Positioning and placement in newspapers define scope and content. Young was not the paper's main political columnist: that honour belonged first to William Rees-Mogg and then to Ronald Butt, their weekly wisdom dominating the page opposite the leader page. Young's article, by contrast, could be found towards the bottom of the pile, buried beneath the editorials and letters. He couldn't write about big topics that also needed editorial comment; he couldn't trample on Rees-Mogg's or Butt's patch. Therefore he needed to take a sideways look at the week's news, to highlight the peripheral and develop different perceptions. He did that with widely acknowledged brilliance; and the sideways slant, setting a different agenda, was actually turned to his advantage. He built a reputation for quirky independence and unexpected insights.<br>
<br>Then in 1978&#150;9 came the year-long strike that shut both <span class="italic">The Times</span> and the <span class="italic">Sunday Times</span> and drove Lord Thomson to sell both papers to Rupert Murdoch. By 1981 Evans had moved to edit <span class="italic">The Times</span> and wanted Young as his deputy and dauphin. But Frank Giles, the new editor at the <span class="italic">Sunday Times</span>, also demanded Young as deputy, and appealed to Murdoch. Giles won and <span class="italic">Sunday Times</span> staff saw him as their editor in waiting. Instead, when Giles went in 1983, Rupert Murdoch appointed Andrew Neil from <span class="italic">The Economist</span>. The two did not get on. &#145;Young was wary and aloof,&#146; Neil wrote,<blockquote>he was the high priest of the collectivist consensus that had already brought Britain to its knees &hellip; [but] the staff looked up to him as guardian of [the paper's] integrity &hellip; I realised early on that both of us could not survive at <span class="italic">The Sunday Times</span>. (Neil, 33&#150;4)</blockquote>Inevitably, it was Young who departed, staking out his position as a committed foe of the Murdoch papers in a final column entitled &#145;A press we don't deserve&#146; (18 March 1984). After nineteen years on the <span class="italic">Sunday Times</span>, and twice being named columnist of the year in the British press awards, he was out of a job. Hopes of an editorship had utterly faded.<h2>
<a name="MovetoTheGuardian"></a>Move to The Guardian</h2>The hiatus did not last long. Peter Preston, his old editor on <span class="italic">Cherwell</span> at Oxford, was editor of <span class="italic">The Guardian</span> now and swiftly offered Young a column there. It was not an altogether easy transition. First Young had to find a means of working alongside another renowned political columnist of the time, Peter Jenkins, who soon solved the problem for him by mounting Fleet Street's merry-go-round and departing to the <span class="italic">Sunday Times</span>; then he had to master techniques for addressing the major issues head-on. Sideways didn't work any longer. Little daunted, Young fast became an essential asset to <span class="italic">The Guardian</span>, winning two more columnist-of-the-year awards in rapid succession. His views&#151;essentially as the voice of liberal conscience&#151;fitted <span class="italic">The Guardian</span> just as snugly as they had fitted Harold Evans's <span class="italic">Sunday Times</span>. He was not a party man and never a party apologist; nor, quite explicitly, did he make close friends of politicians, though tory &#145;wets&#146; and the coming young men of New Labour both knew him well. He researched diligently, kept his distance, and pronounced in a way that the politicians who read him found compelling. He could not be an editor, but he could be a master of his trade (and perhaps of something greater).<br>
<br>For Young, 1989 was a difficult but momentous year. His wife, Helen, died of cancer after a long illness, leaving him alone to care for their four children. He was devastated but, characteristically, hid his grief and rallied his family. His major book, <span class="italic">One of Us</span>, a history of the Thatcher years, was published to critical acclaim in Britain and America, and became an international best-seller. And then an invitation to chair the Scott Trust, the close-knit grouping of great and good that owned <span class="italic">The Guardian</span> and its group, arrived out of the blue. The trustees had been brooding fruitlessly over who could replace the retiring Alastair Hetherington, when one of them, Liz Forgan, suddenly asked &#145;What about the lovely Hugo?&#146;  (personal knowledge). Within five minutes the invitation was agreed and Young became an honorary member of the newspaper proprietors' club, sitting as quasi-owner on the group board, hiring and firing editors, and&#151;as the trust deed required&#151;seeking to secure the future of <span class="italic">The Guardian</span> &#145;in perpetuity&#146;.<h2>
<a name="ScottTrustchairmanshipandthesavingofTheObserver"></a>Scott Trust chairmanship and the saving of The Observer</h2>Young took the role of chairman of the Scott Trust with customary diligence and seriousness. <span class="italic">The Guardian</span> itself, after several years of circulation and financial success during the 1980s, had been wrong-footed by the founding of <span class="italic">The Independent</span> and by years of difficult production problems after the Murdoch-owned press's move to Wapping. It had just undergone a sweeping redesign and needed resolute trust backing. Young supplied that in full measure. He was also keenly engaged by the other great challenge on the <span class="italic">Guardian</span> horizon: the fate of its natural Sunday partner, <span class="italic">The Observer</span>. Several times through the previous twenty years, <span class="italic">The Guardian</span> and <span class="italic">The Observer</span> had seemed on the brink of joining forces. It had never quite happened. Now, though, Roland (&#145;Tiny&#146;) Rowland of Lonrho was in a mood to sell as Sunday losses mounted. The only known buyer in town was <span class="italic">The Guardian</span>'s principal rival, <span class="italic">The Independent</span>, which saw an alluring way of strengthening its own struggling <span class="italic">Independent on Sunday</span>, by buying <span class="italic">The Observer</span>, then closing it, so turning two papers into one. This was a serious strategic threat to <span class="italic">The Guardian</span>, one that the editor, Preston, and his managing director, Jim Markwick, were determined to meet. But first the trust had to agree, and help find the &pound;25 million it would cost. Young, who always described himself as &#145;just a journalist&#146;, saw the imperatives of journalism and of a historic title in need of rescue. The trust was persuaded. The deal was done within forty-eight hours. But debilitating difficulties remained.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">The Observer</span>, after decades of decline, could not be turned round in a trice. One editor followed another in dispiritingly quick succession until the arrival of Roger Alton in 1998 steadied nerves; Young clearly found this side of quasi-proprietorship personally gruelling. Some appointments were relatively easy: of Bob Gavron and then Paul Myners to the group chairmanship, of Bob Phillis from the BBC as group chief executive and Alan Rusbridger as editor of <span class="italic">The Guardian</span>. But <span class="italic">The Observer</span> produced crisis after crisis. Young was much fortified through these difficult years by his marriage on 22 December 1990 to the American artist, Lucille (Lucy) Waring, daughter of Forsyth Massey, sailor.<br>
<br>&#145;Only in mid-career&#146;, Young confessed, &#145;and to my shame, did I begin to understand that, for Britain, Europe is the issue overshadowing all others&#146;  (Young, xxii). Another scholarly and passionate book&#151;<span class="italic">This Blessed Plot: Britain in Europe from Churchill to Blair</span>&#151;made good this omission in 1998 and provided a constant theme for Young's column work (which continued throughout his time as chairman of the Scott Trust). He was the most consistent and vociferous supporter of European integration in the British national press. He also found himself widely derided in other, more euro-sceptical organs. &#145;After the heady 70s and the combative 80s, pro-Europeanism had become a quite unfashionable position&#146;, he lamented in 2003  (<span class="italic">The Guardian</span>, 27 June 2003). But fashion was always anathema to Young.<br>
<br>As he prepared to give up the Scott Trust chairmanship (a term due to end in 2004), Young returned eagerly to the love of his working life: the column.<blockquote>For the most part I've been less interested in influencing events and the ministers who make them than in enlightening readers who may want to understand what is going on. I don't see myself as a player, more a watcher, a finder-out, a discloser, an alerter, a reporter. (Young, xvii&#150;xviii)</blockquote>He saw no reason why he should ever put aside this role, but one reason came suddenly. Young was diagnosed with cancer and his readers knew its seriousness because, for weeks on end, he stopped writing. In the summer of 2003, however, he was back in action: chairing trust meetings, producing columns of memorable ferocity (including one final one on 16 September denouncing Tony Blair as a failure and &#145;tragic figure&#146; who deserved no further support), and even travelling to the United States to assess the beginning of the presidential election campaign. Then the cancer returned. He died at his home, 22 Christchurch Hill, Hampstead, London, on 22 September 2003. He was survived by his wife, Lucy, and the four children of his first marriage.<h2>
<a name="Reputationandassessment"></a>Reputation and assessment</h2>Following Young's death a sense of loss across the political spectrum was instantly manifest. Tony Blair, tragic figure or not, spoke of a &#145;genuinely nice human being&#146; of &#145;exceptional ability and integrity&#146;. Gordon Brown praised Young's &#145;great intellect&#146; and said that his knowledge and wisdom &#145;shone through his writing&#146;. Lord Patten described him as &#145;one of the greatest liberal voices of our age&#146;. Lord Biffen never thought of him as a political adversary: &#145;We were jointly examining a topic in a detached and good natured manner.&#146; Jacques Delors, highlighting the &#145;central importance&#146; of <span class="italic">This Blessed Plot</span>, paid &#145;homage to a great journalist and remarkable historian&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Guardian</span>, 24 Sept 2003). Such tributes&#151;and there were many more&#151;went far beyond mere formality. They attested to a respect and to a reputation rarely found in the world of British journalism.<br>
<br>Young, as he was often the first to admit, was in no sense infallible. Some of his trust dealings with editorial management, especially over <span class="italic">The Observer</span>, bordered on the chaotic&#151;and one ex-editor at least thought him a flawed defender of editorial freedom. Sometimes his columns, especially on European themes, could seem repetitive (indeed, on one occasion, <span class="italic">The Guardian</span> printed an old one by mistake, and only Young noticed). But these, as Young himself acknowledged wryly, were proofs of his humanity, reminders of how rough and complex a trade journalism could be. Time and again he had proved himself an adornment to that trade. In private or public, his natural authority and elegantly incisive prose set him apart as a potent source of conviction and integrity.<br>
