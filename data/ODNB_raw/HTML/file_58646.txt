<span class="headword">Alexander,  William Whiteway</span>  (1852&#150;1933), <span class="occ">athletics administrator</span>, was born on 3 December 1852 at Park Hill Farm, Andover, Hampshire, the younger son of James Whiteway Alexander (<i>b</i>. 1821/2), who later became an inn-keeper. Most of his boyhood was spent on the Isle of Wight. In his teens, certainly before he was eighteen, he left home and made his way to the mainland, apparently distressed when his father remarried soon after his mother's death. He was interested in horses and worked for some years as a stable boy. Aged nineteen he was a domestic servant in the household of the vicar of Brewood, Staffordshire. He moved to Birmingham to take a job with the Post Office as a letter carrier and married, on 19 August 1877, Mary Ann Lucy (<i>b</i>. 1852/3), daughter of William Hancox. They had six children. He followed his father into the licensed trade, at Redditch and then at Halesowen, Worcestershire, where in 1901 he was manager of a public house. He later became a sub-postmaster.<br>
<br>At Brewood Alexander began to compete in local athletics meetings, and after moving to Birmingham he joined Birchfield Harriers in 1879. He developed into a good cross-country runner and finished fourth in the English championship of 1881. But after becoming secretary to the Birchfield club in 1882 and taking a place on the committee of the Midland Counties Cross Country Association, his running took second place to administration and an ambition to make Birchfield a successful club. The national and area associations had recently been formed and many new clubs were being founded. Within Birmingham there was intense rivalry between Birchfield and Moseley Harriers, and also between the men who were the driving forces behind these clubs, Alexander and Harry Oliver. The most prestigious prize in inter-club competition was the English cross-country championship, which Birchfield won for the first time in 1880. Inspired by Oliver, Moseley took the title the following four years, using the strategy of importing good runners from outside the Birmingham area.<br>
<br>When Moseley disbanded in 1886 it left Birchfield as the top club in the midlands, and Alexander set about making it the top club in the country. He did so by copying Moseley's policy and signing up some of the best runners from all around the midlands, and then, at the turn of the century, setting up club branches and feeding runners to the parent club. It proved extremely effective. Birchfield enjoyed a prolonged run of success in the cross-country championship that a century later remained the most outstanding in any branch of inter-club competition in Britain; of the forty-nine championships held from 1886 to 1939 the club won twenty-seven of them, and finished outside the first three only six times.<br>
<br>Although primarily interested in the fortunes of Birchfield, Alexander had an abiding love for cross-country and all those who took part in it. He claimed it was the purest and healthiest of pastimes, with no material reward for weekly toil and strict training. In this, he was certainly drawing a comparison with the track handicap races, where the lure of attractive prizes caused some chicanery. He was official handicapper in the midlands from 1886 until the authorities formed a handicapping board in 1901. In 1930 the Amateur Athletic Association produced a book detailing the first fifty years of organized athletics in England, and Alexander wrote the section on cross-country. He was secretary of the Midland Counties Cross Country Association (1888&#150;98), and its treasurer (1888&#150;95) and president (1903&#150;4); he was also secretary of the English Cross Country Union (1890&#150;93 and 1896&#150;8).<br>
<br>On 20 September 1926 Birchfield members were called to a meeting &#145;to consider the purchase of land for an athletics track and sports ground which will perpetuate the life work of Mr W. W. Alexander and commemorate the club's jubilee in December 1927&#146;. The motion was passed, the money raised from club funds and public subscription, and the Alexander Stadium was officially opened on 27 July 1929. It was Birchfield's home until the club moved to a new stadium (named the Birmingham Alexander Stadium) in 1977.<br>
<br>Alexander married a second time and had four children with his second wife, the last child being born when he was seventy-eight. Alexander died from bronchial pneumonia at his home, 176 Gooch Street, Birmingham, on 6 October 1933 and was buried in the cemetery of Aston parish church, Birmingham.<br>
