<span class="headword">Blacker,  Carlos Paton</span>  (1895&#150;1975), <span class="occ">psychiatrist and eugenicist</span>, was born on 8 December 1895 in Paris, the elder of the two sons of Carlos Blacker and Caroline Frost. His father, a gentleman of independent means, was descended on his maternal side from a prominent Peruvian political family, and one of Blacker's cousins, Pedro Beltran, served for a time as prime minister of Peru. Blacker's mother was the daughter of a Confederate general from St Louis who gained some distinction during the American Civil War. French was C. P. Blacker's first language and he remained bilingual throughout his life. Both Blacker and his brother were educated at Eton College, which Blacker left to serve as an officer in the Coldstream Guards from 1915 to 1919. He was wounded, and decorated with the Military Cross. Blacker's experiences during the First World War, in which his brother was killed, had an enduring impact on him and contributed to a falling away from his Roman Catholic origins and to his decision to practise psychiatry. During his last years Blacker returned in his mind to the war, writing an extensive account (unpublished) of his life in the trenches.<br>
<br>Following the war Blacker entered Balliol College, Oxford, graduating in 1922 with distinction in natural science and zoology. While at Oxford Blacker represented the university at foils and was captain of the boxing club from 1920 to 1922, establishing a pattern of vigorous physical activity that saw him still running 5 miles a day or plunging into icy waters for a swim when in his mid-sixties. Blacker, in 1923, married Helen Maud Pilkington (1894&#150;1984), the daughter of Major A. J. Pilkington, whose family was living in Florence at the time. From 1922 to 1925 he trained for medicine at Guy's Hospital, London, and obtained his MB (1927) and later his MD (1931) from Oxford. From 1927 to 1936 he was registrar of psychological medicine at Guy's. He left to join the psychiatric staff of the Maudsley Hospital, London, where, with the Second World War years excepted, he spent much of the remainder of his clinical career, retiring in 1960. Blacker's many professional publications included <span class="italic">Human Values in Psychological Medicine</span> (1933), <span class="italic">Voluntary Sterilization</span> (1934), and <span class="italic">The Chances of Morbid Inheritance</span> (1934).<br>
<br>Immediately upon the outbreak of war in 1939 Blacker rejoined the Coldstream Guards as a regimental medical officer, was evacuated at Dunkirk and was awarded the George Medal for his gallantry in rescuing a wounded fellow officer from a minefield in which two men had already been killed. In 1942 he was seconded to the Ministry of Health as adviser on population and medico-social problems to undertake a comprehensive survey of psychiatric facilities required in the post-war period. His important report, <span class="italic">Neurosis and the Mental Health Services</span> (1946), provided guidelines for both in-patient and out-patient psychiatric requirements, including special child psychiatric facilities, developed by the new National Health Service.<br>
<br>Blacker's appointment to the Ministry of Health was an acknowledgement of the reputation he enjoyed in the inter-war years not only as a psychiatrist but as an influential authority on the eugenic aspects of birth control and population. His interests in the social consequences of human heredity and variability, which led him to eugenics in the 1920s, were stimulated by his biological studies at Oxford and his reading of Sir Francis Galton, whose broad goals of eugenic improvement Blacker sought to advance as general secretary of the Eugenics Society from 1931 to 1952. Under Blacker the Eugenics Society was transformed from an unfocused, amateur propaganda agency dabbling uncertainly in the newly emerging areas of birth control and genetics, into a quasi-professional research foundation committed to family planning and the serious study of population problems.<br>
<br>Blacker's interest in birth control began when he was a medical student at Guy's Hospital. He was distressed by the large number of poor female clinic patients desperate for help in avoiding further pregnancies. He complained of the medical profession's irresponsible hostility to birth control and warned that unless doctors began to take an interest in the field it would be pre-empted by non-medical people like Marie Stopes with her &#145;flowery and highly-coloured books&#146;. The publication of <span class="italic">Birth Control and the State</span> (1926) was the first of Blacker's many books and articles advocating the medicalization of contraception and pointing out its great value for the improvement of physical, mental, and &#145;racial&#146; health. He was instrumental in founding the birth control investigation committee (BCIC) in 1927 composed of scientists and doctors committed to studying the medical and sociological effects of contraception. Blacker also persuaded a reluctant Eugenics Society to endorse birth control as a eugenic weapon and to finance the BCIC as well as the unique, decade-long efforts of the Oxford zoologist, John Baker, to find a simple, reliable contraceptive for use by the most populous and, allegedly, eugenically least desirable sectors of society.<br>
<br>In his ultimately vain efforts to win for eugenics the scientific credibility and respectability he believed it deserved as an instrument of rational demographic planning and social improvement, Blacker recruited prominent scientists, social scientists, and physicians to the cause. As an advocate of a more liberal minded, scientific, reform eugenics, Blacker persuaded the Eugenics Society, sometimes under threat of his own resignation, to forge alliances with the National Birth Control Association, later the Family Planning Association (FPA), and with new demographic research groups such as the population investigation committee (PIC) and population and economic planning, all of which the Eugenics Society agreed not only to finance, but, in the case of the PIC and FPA, to house for a time in the society's offices in Eccleston Square. Blacker served for several years as honorary secretary of the PIC.<br>
<br>The close ties that Blacker fashioned between eugenics, birth control, and population studies in the 1930s culminated in 1944 in the achievement of one of his long-term goals, the appointment of the royal commission on population (1949), whose ranks, from chairman down, contained a number of prominent eugenicists. Blacker hoped that their role on the prestigious commission would revive the scientific credibility of a eugenics movement tainted by its association with the race hygiene policies of the Nazis. But he acknowledged in a brief history, <span class="italic">Eugenics: Galton and after</span>, published in 1952 to coincide with his resignation as general secretary of the Eugenics Society, that his efforts had failed.<br>
<br>Following his resignation, Blacker became increasingly involved in international population issues, serving as the first chairman of the Simon Population Trust and playing an important role as an ally of Margaret Sanger in the founding of the International Planned Parenthood Federation in 1952. He brought to the often tempestuous international conferences many of the qualities of patience, courtesy, good humour, and compromise that made it possible for him to work so successfully throughout his life with the many difficult and contentious people who populated the birth control and eugenics movements. Tall, spare, and determined, he was to some a formidable, efficient, rather distant person who remained every inch an old Etonian and ex-Coldstream Guards officer. But to his close friends, who called him &#145;Pip&#146;, Blacker was warm, generous, and unfailingly loyal and supportive.<br>
<br>As a consulting psychiatrist to the merged Bethlem Royal and Maudsley Hospital Blacker continued to see patients at a weekly clinic until shortly before his death. As he lay dying in 1975 the Eugenics Society, which had awarded him the Galton medal in 1957, sent him a silver Galton plate commemorating his many years of service to the cause. He died before he could see it of a cerebral thrombosis on 21 April 1975 at the Royal Surrey County Hospital in Guildford, survived by his wife, one son, and two daughters, one of them the Japanese scholar <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/101471/', "Carmen Elizabeth Deidre Blacker (1924&#150;2009)")</script>. He was buried at Shamley Green, Surrey.<br>
