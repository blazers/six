<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Dixon,  Richard  Watson</span>  (1833&#150;1900), <span class="occ">ecclesiastical historian and poet</span>, was born on 5 May 1833 at Islington, London, the eldest of the six surviving children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7699/', "James Dixon (1788&#150;1871)")</script> and his third wife, Mary Watson (<i>d</i>. 1856), the only daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28858/', "Richard Watson (1781&#150;1833)")</script>. In the biography he wrote of his father, Dixon described his mother as &#145;an excellent Latin and Greek scholar, a perfect French and a sufficient Italian linguist, and an exquisite musician&#146;  (Dixon, 169). His father was a famous Wesleyan preacher, leader of his church, and president of the Methodist conference, who, said his son, &#145;lived upon a vast height of holiness&#146;  (ibid., 476). With such a father it is perhaps not surprising that Dixon was a diffident, solitary, reserved, and impressionable child.<br>
<br>As his father was obliged by Methodist practice to change the circuit of his ministry every three years, Dixon's childhood was spent successively in Islington, Liverpool, Sheffield, Manchester, and Poplar, London, and he received his early education at home. In 1847 the family moved to Birmingham and he entered King Edward VI School, where his schoolfriends included Edwin Hatch and Edward Burne-Jones. On 3 June 1852 he matriculated at Pembroke College, Oxford, and in his time there was founder of and a contributor to the <span class="italic">Oxford and Cambridge Magazine</span> (1856), modelled in part upon the Pre-Raphaelite journal <span class="italic">The Germ</span> (1848). For a few months in 1857 Dixon joined William Morris, Burne-Jones, and Dante Gabriel Rossetti at their bohemian lodgings in Red Lion Square in London to study painting, but, lacking means, confidence, and ability, he soon returned to his first intention of preparing for Anglican orders. (As both his parents were conservative Methodists who did not renounce membership in the Church of England, they did not see their son's vocation as disloyal to their own communion.)<br>
<br>Dixon was ordained in 1858, the year in which, redeeming his inglorious third class in Greats (1856), he won the Arnold historical prize at Oxford for his essay &#145;The close of the tenth century of the Christian era&#146;. The three years following his ordination he spent as a curate in the populous working-class London parishes of St Mary-the-Less, Lambeth (1858&#150;61), and St Mary's, Newington (1861). On 9 April 1861 he married a widow with three daughters&#151;Maria Thomson (1821&#150;1876), daughter of Charles Sturgeon and the former wife of William Thomson of East Lothian. Later that year he became assistant master at Highgate School, Middlesex, where he talked of John Keats by the hour to his pupils, one of whom was Gerard Manley Hopkins.<br>
<br>Dixon's first publication was a colourful Keatsian narrative, <span class="italic">The Sicilian Vespers</span> (1852). His <span class="italic">St. John in Patmos</span> (1863), another long narrative&#150;descriptive prize poem, is more restrained. <span class="roman">New Testament</span> or historical subjects are also prominent in his collections, <span class="italic">Christ's Company</span> (1861) and <span class="italic">Historical Odes</span> (1864), but the collections' most remarkable verse is found in dream lyrics exploring the psyche in terms of a private symbolism, or in brooding nature poems. This early verse was ignored or dismissed by reviewers and found so few readers that the print runs of the 1861 and 1864 volumes were not sold out until after 1935.<br>
<br>Dixon moved from London for the sake of his health and became, in turn, second master at Carlisle high school (1862&#150;8); minor canon and honorary librarian of Carlisle Cathedral (1868&#150;75) and honorary canon from 1874; vicar of Hayton, near Carlisle (1875&#150;83); and rural dean of Brampton, Cumberland (1879&#150;83). He continued to write poetry and he published essays on ecclesiastical history. His piously eulogistic biography of his father appeared in 1874, and in that year he also embarked on his major scholarly undertaking: the <span class="italic">History of the Church of England from the Abolition of the Roman Jurisdiction</span> (6 vols., 1879&#150;1902). His wife died in 1876 and he had long been separated from his Oxford friends, but he was reinvigorated when, unexpectedly, in 1878, Gerard Manley Hopkins wrote in praise of his neglected poetry. Hopkins valued it so much, in fact, that he copied out three of Dixon's long poems (&#145;St. Paul&#146;, &#145;St. John&#146;, and &#145;Love's Consolation&#146;) to keep when, as a Jesuit, he no longer owned books of his own. Hopkins introduced Dixon to Robert Bridges and the three friends formed, mostly by correspondence, a close, mutually comforting circle united by poetry. Dixon was a less skilled poet and critic than Bridges, but he perceived and appreciated the quality and power of Hopkins's innovative poetry more than Bridges could. On 9 February 1882 he married Matilda Elizabeth Routledge (1840&#150;1922), daughter of the publisher <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/24184/', "George Routledge")</script>. Two grown-up daughters of his first wife continued to live at home, but he had no children of his own from either marriage. On 30 November 1883 he was inducted as vicar of Warkworth in Northumberland, and in 1884 he was appointed rural dean of Alnwick.<br>
<br>Stimulated by Hopkins and Bridges, Dixon revised and completed <span class="italic">Mano, a Poetical History of the Time of the Close of the Tenth Century</span>, a long poem begun in 1875 and published by Routledge in 1883. A work of epic scale, more than 5000 lines long, it is written in well-controlled <i>terza rima</i>: its fictional action, a vain struggle of faith against fate, is placed within the historical setting of a savage and pious age when people lived in daily expectation of the end of the world (the age Dixon had first studied in his Arnold prize essay). Two slim volumes, <span class="italic">Odes and Eclogues</span> (1884) and <span class="italic">Lyrical Poems</span> (1887), handsomely printed by Bridges' friend C. H. O. Daniel on his private press at Worcester College, Oxford, contain Dixon's finest lyrics on nature and mutability. His verse was much clearer than in the early volumes: youthful themes of supernatural terror were replaced by more human concerns of advancing age. His third Daniel Press book, <span class="italic">The Story of Eudocia and her Brothers</span> (1888), is a competent narrative poem in heroic couplets.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">Mano</span> was admired by Algernon Charles Swinburne, who recommended Dixon for the poet laureateship after Tennyson's death in 1892; Bridges and Hopkins praised highly the imaginative penetration and freshness of <span class="italic">Lyrical Poems</span>; and reviewers were kinder to Dixon in the 1880s than they had been in the 1860s. Dixon himself, however, suffered a mental depression in 1891&#150;2 (following bouts of influenza, bronchitis, and pneumonia), which caused him to destroy his verse manuscripts and resolve to write no more poetry except on religious subjects. The only poem he subsequently sent to the press was a funeral elegy in Latin on his boyhood friend Edwin Hatch (1892). Bridges kept some manuscripts and, over the years, edited three selections of Dixon's published and unpublished poetry: <span class="italic">Songs and Odes</span> (1896); <span class="italic">Last Poems</span> (1905), with a preface by Mary Coleridge; and <span class="italic">Poems: a Selection</span> (1909), with a fine, affectionate memoir by Bridges himself.<br>
<br>Dixon's work on the <span class="italic">History of the Church of England</span> continued, much interrupted by ill health. As the four volumes published by 1891 were well reviewed and his worth as an ecclesiastical historian was widely accepted, his friends were angry that he received no church preferment. He was proposed for two lay academic appointments, the Oxford chair of poetry in 1885 and the Dixie chair of ecclesiastical history at Cambridge in 1891, but in both cases, overcome with diffidence, he withdrew before the election. However, his historical labours received overdue recognition when in October 1899 he was admitted to an honorary fellowship at Pembroke College, Oxford, and when in December the university conferred upon him the honorary degree of DD. Soon afterwards he again contracted influenza: he died of influenza and heart disease on 23 January 1900 at the vicarage at Warkworth and was interred four days later in Warkworth burial-ground. He was survived by his second wife.<br>
<br>The last two volumes (5 and 6) of the <span class="italic">History of the Church of England</span>, which brought the narrative to 1570, were published in 1902, bringing to completion a work planned on a massive scale and, in view of Dixon's parochial and decanal duties and his remoteness from good libraries, one executed with great determination and intellectual stamina. Although superseded by later scholarship, the <span class="italic">History</span> remains highly readable. Dixon writes as if from the viewpoint of a fair-minded contemporary, observing a process without any view of an end which could distort the facts or excuse injustice in the light of ultimate benefit. His narrative is continually enlivened by an unobtrusive dry humour; his frequent character studies are serious but witty, charitable but acute. Some trace of these qualities appears also in the dozen articles he wrote for the <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span> between 1886 and 1890.<br>
<br>Dixon was fairly tall and was left-handed; he was dark-complexioned and full-bearded with a good head of hair which turned white in middle age; his voice was deep, slow, and melancholy; he was an inveterate pipe-smoker (a habit that may have contributed to frequent bronchial complaints in the last decade of his life). According to H. C. Beeching, &#145;it was often remarked that Dixon had a great look of Chaucer as he appears in Hoccleve's portrait, and the resemblance was more than external, reaching to a characteristic and humorous interest in all sorts and conditions of people&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>). Bridges was struck by Dixon's humility, which with strangers passed for shyness and gaucherie, thus disguising his eager, ingenuous temper. Hopkins found something of this temper in Dixon's best verse: &#145;an extreme purity, a directness of human nature, and absence of affectation which is most rare&#146;  (<span class="italic">Hopkins to Robert Bridges</span>, 139).<br>
