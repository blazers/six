<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Blount,  Mountjoy</span>, first earl of Newport  (<em>c.</em>1597&#150;1666), <span class="occ">courtier and politician</span>, was the eldest of three illegitimate sons of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2683/', "Charles Blount, earl of Devonshire (1563&#150;1606)")</script>, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/23490/', "Lady Penelope Rich (1563&#150;1607)")</script>, daughter of Walter Devereux, first earl of Essex; his parents were eventually to marry, contrary to canon law, in 1605. He was the half-brother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/23484/', "Henry Rich, first earl of Holland (bap. 1590, d. 1649)")</script>, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/23494/', "Robert Rich, second earl of Warwick (1587&#150;1658)")</script>. When his father died in April 1606, he left him considerable estates at Wanstead, Essex, and elsewhere, worth at that time an estimated total of &pound;3000 to &pound;4000 a year; Clarendon later observed that he possessed &#145;a very plentiful revenue&#146;  (Clarendon, <span class="italic">Hist. rebellion</span>, 1.78).<h2>
<a name="Earlyyearsandsuccessasacourtier"></a>Early years and success as a courtier</h2>Blount quickly established himself as a favourite at court and was created Lord Mountjoy, baron of Mountjoy Fort in the Irish peerage, in January 1618. He went overseas at the end of that year, where his travels took him to, among other places, Turin and Venice. On 8 January 1621 he acted in a masque before King James and the French ambassador at Essex House, and in April the following year he was in Prince Charles's company at a tilt. During 1622 he also travelled with Colonel Edward Cecil to the Low Countries, where it was falsely reported that they had been slain. On 21 February 1623 Mountjoy accompanied the earl of Carlisle on a visit to the French court to request that Prince Charles might pass through Paris in disguise, on his way to Spain, without kissing the king's hand. After this, Mountjoy rode on to Spain, where he caught tertian fever. After his return he attended the Spanish ambassador, Mendoza, in London the following November. In April 1625 he was granted a pass to the United Provinces for himself or his deputy to take 100 men to serve there as horsemen.<br>
<br>Further evidence of Charles's favour came on 5 June 1627 when he created Mountjoy Baron Mountjoy of Thurveston (Derbyshire) in the English peerage, with a special clause giving him precedence over barons created since 20 May of that year. Following objections from the only two barons affected, Lord Fauconberg and Lord Lovelace, the Lords' committee for privileges ruled in April 1628 that this grant of precedence was illegal. Accordingly, on 27 July 1628 Charles created Mountjoy earl of Newport (in the Isle of Wight) in the English peerage and the following month appointed him to a command in the expedition for the relief of La Rochelle. However, Buckingham's assassination delayed the expedition's departure until October, and Newport was appointed rear-admiral of the fleet. Throughout 1629 and 1630 he petitioned for payment for his services, and a warrant for payment was finally issued on 12 May 1631. He was granted the reversion to the custodianship of Hyde Park in June 1630.<br>
<br>On 7 February 1627 Newport had married Anne Boteler (<i>d</i>. 1669), daughter of Sir John Boteler, bt (later first Baron Boteler), and Elizabeth Villiers. In 1637 Lady Newport created a sensation by converting to Catholicism. Her husband begged Laud's assistance in securing the punishment of those whom he held responsible, including Walter Montagu and Sir Toby Matthew, and the archbishop's attempts to do so led him into a major row with Queen Henrietta Maria, who vigorously defended her co-religionists. The queen successfully frustrated attempts to regulate access to her chapel, and she summoned Lady Newport and a number of other recent converts to attend mass there on Christmas day 1637. It is possible that these events help to explain Newport's subsequent alienation from the court and his association (albeit temporary) with some of the crown's leading critics in the early 1640s.<br>
<br>On 31 August 1634 Newport had been appointed master of the ordnance for life. Over the next five years he was actively involved with the ordnance office and succeeded in making large profits for himself. He was appointed a privy councillor in September 1638, and was one of the lords of the council at York who took the oath of allegiance to the king in April 1639. He became colonel of a regiment of foot the following month, and later general of the artillery in the king's army in the north. In September 1639 he sold gunpowder to the Spanish ambassador, Cardenas, for the Spanish fleet that was attacking the Dutch in the channel, at an inflated price. Arguing that &#145;the King of Spain is very rich, and it is of no importance to him how much he gives for the powder of which he is so greatly in need&#146;  (S. R. Gardiner, <span class="italic">History of England from the Accession of James I to the Outbreak of the Civil War, 1603&#150;1642</span>, 10 vols., 1883&#150;4, 9.61), Newport struck a deal whereby Charles received &pound;5000 above the value of the powder, and he himself &pound;1000. The following month he bargained with Cardenas to convey Spanish soldiers from the fleet to Dunkirk at 30<i>s</i>. a head, contrary to Charles's instruction that England remain strictly neutral in the conflict between Spain and the Dutch.<h2>
<a name="Thecomingofcivilwar"></a>The coming of civil war</h2>In the Short Parliament and the opening months of the Long Parliament, Newport aligned himself with the king's critics in the Lords. On 29 April 1640 he voted with the minority of peers in supporting the Commons' resolution that redress of grievances should precede supply, although he later tried to excuse his conduct to the king by claiming that in the heat of the moment he was so agitated that he had voted the wrong way by mistake. In April 1641 George Goring leaked intelligence of the first army plot to Newport (possibly with royal approval). The earl at once took him to see Bedford and Mandeville, who passed the news on to Pym. In an attempt to conciliate him, Charles promptly appointed Newport constable of the Tower on 6 May; however, any possible benefits to the king that might have come from this gesture were lost amid the revelations of the army plot. After the Lords had passed the bill for Strafford's attainder, and while Charles was hesitating over whether to accept it, Newport gave his assurance that in his new capacity as constable of the Tower he would ensure that Strafford was put to death even if the king refused his assent. In June Charles ordered Newport to proceed to York to safeguard munitions in the north, and on 25 June the Lords petitioned the king to permit him still to be paid as constable of the Tower in the meantime. On 18 August the houses ordered Newport to take up residence in the Tower and to make sure that it was safely guarded.<br>
<br>During the autumn of 1641 Newport continued to be identified among the more radical members of the Lords. On 9 September he was one of a minority of peers who voted against the Lords' order that &#145;the divine service be performed as it is appointed by the Acts of Parliament&#146;  (<span class="italic">JHL</span>, 4, 1628&#150;42, 395). When the Lords further resolved to publish this order before conferring with the Commons, Newport recorded his protest, together with Bedford, Warwick, Clare, Wharton, and Mandeville. The king's suspicion of him was reinforced by a report that while Charles had been in Scotland in August 1641 Newport had allegedly informed a gathering at Kensington which included Essex, Saye and Sele, Wharton, Nathaniel Fiennes, and John Pym that if it turned out that the king was hatching a plot, then &#145;here are his wife and children; insinuating the same to signify that the person of Her Majesty and her children should be seized upon&#146;. When Charles later confronted Newport with this story the earl denied it, whereupon the king replied dismissively &#145;I am sorry for your lordship's memory&#146;  (<span class="italic">JHL</span>, 4, 1628&#150;42, 490, 493).<br>
<br>Charles's growing suspicion of Newport was apparent towards the end of December 1641, when the Commons, disturbed by the king's appointment of Sir Thomas Lunsford as lieutenant of the Tower, repeated their request that Newport take up residence there. Charles's immediate response was to dismiss Newport from the constableship. At about the same time, on 27 December, Newport raised the matter of the Kensington rumours in the Lords, and the next day both houses submitted a joint petition asking the king to name his informant. On 30 December Charles replied, stating that he &#145;neither did nor do give credit to any such rumour&#146;  (<span class="italic">JHL</span>, 4, 1628&#150;42, 498). It is indeed possible that Charles had not entirely lost personal trust in Newport for that same day he gave him the keys of Whitehall Palace.<h2>
<a name="Newportsroyalismanditsconsequences"></a>Newport's royalism and its consequences</h2>The likeliest explanation of Newport's behaviour is that he was trying to retain credit with both the king and his critics within the houses. These attempts led the royalist Sir Philip Warwick to brand Newport &#145;a very weak and faithless person&#146;  (Warwick, 131). During the opening months of 1642 there were clear signs that Newport was attempting to rebuild his bridges with the king. On 5 January he accompanied Charles, together with Essex, Hamilton, and his own half-brother Holland, to the City of London in search of the five members. The following April, he allegedly advised the king to go to Hull, and was with Charles when Sir John Hotham denied him entry to the garrison. On 11 May the Lords ordered Newport to attend the house &#145;as a delinquent&#146;  (<span class="italic">JHL</span>, 5, 1642&#150;3, 59), but apparently he did not comply. On 15 June he was among the king's supporters at York who signed a declaration pledging Charles's commitment to &#145;the firm and constant settlement of the true Protestant religion, the just privileges of Parliament, the liberty of the subject, [and] the law, peace, and prosperity of this kingdom&#146;  (Clarendon, <span class="italic">Hist. rebellion</span>, 2.185&#150;6). By December 1642 he was the earl of Newcastle's lieutenant-general, but his forces arrived too late to assist the royalist assault on Tadcaster, a failure that Newcastle's wife attributed to &#145;neglect or treachery&#146;  (<span class="italic">Life of William Cavendish</span>, 16). Newport was also defeated in an engagement with Sir Hugh Cholmley in north Yorkshire in January 1643, and the following month he quarrelled with Newcastle over the latter's desire to employ Catholics in his army. That same month Newcastle attempted to arrest him at Pontefract following allegations that Newport had plotted to seize the queen on her return from the Netherlands. There is, however, no evidence to support these accusations, and the fact that he immediately afterwards fled back to the king may suggest that they were groundless.<h2>
<a name="Thecostofroyalism"></a>The cost of royalism</h2>In the event parliamentarian troops captured Newport before he reached Charles: in mid-March 1643 it was reported that he was &#145;stayed at Coventry&#146; and the Lords ordered that he be brought to London  (<span class="italic">JHL</span>, 5, 1642&#150;3, 649). On 28 March Newport surrendered himself and was committed to the custody of the gentleman usher of the Lords; on 4 April he was granted &#145;liberty to go abroad, and take the air for his health&#146;, provided that the gentleman usher accompanied him  (ibid., 692). On 11 June the Commons ordered Newport's saddle and horse-arms, and other property left in the Tower from when he had been constable, to be handed over to Sir Thomas Myddleton.<br>
<br>Newport was apparently released during the summer of 1643, and he was with the king at Oxford by November. In May 1644 he was one of Prince Rupert's commissioners at Shrewsbury, and the following month he visited Weymouth, where he went aboard the ship of his half-brother Warwick, the parliamentarian admiral. Newport was apparently present at the second battle of Newbury (27 October 1644) and marched with the king to Bath on the night after the battle. By the end of 1645 he was with the king's forces in Devon, and was taken prisoner at the fall of Dartmouth Castle on 23 January 1646. Fairfax sent him in custody to London, where he was again entrusted to the gentleman usher of the Lords. On 11 February Newport petitioned the Lords requesting &#145;leave to be confined to some private place&#146; where his maintenance would cost him &#145;a more easier charge&#146;  (<span class="italic">JHL</span>, 8, 1645&#150;6, 162). The Lords accepted a recognizance of &pound;2000 from Newport on 17 February, on condition that he would &#145;be a true prisoner, and not go out of the precincts of the liberties of the parishes of St Martin's-in-the-Fields and the Covent Garden&#146;  (ibid., 171). It seems that about this time Newport was also attempting to curry favour with the houses by suborning a lieutenant of the prince of Wales's guard to convey the prince to Westminster (although nothing came of this and the prince departed for the Isles of Scilly on 2 March 1646). On 23 March Newport was granted &#145;liberty to go abroad, and take the air, within four or five miles from London, for his health's sake&#146;. He entered into a new recognizance, again for &pound;2000, on condition that he would be &#145;a true prisoner to this House, and shall go no further than five miles from the lines of communication about London&#146;  (ibid., 226). He was later &#145;released from his bail&#146; on 22 July 1646  (ibid., 437).<br>
<br>On 30 April 1646 Newport begged to compound for his delinquency at the rate of one-tenth, equivalent to the value of two years' income from his estate. His composition fine was initially set at &pound;4579, and shortly afterwards reduced to &pound;4179 following the settlement of a debt. On 4 October 1647 the Lords accepted Newport's request that allowance be made for his loss of the office of master of the ordnance, and recommended to the Commons that his composition fine be further reduced accordingly. However, after a lengthy review his fine was confirmed at &pound;4179 on 11 April 1650. Newport's estate was apparently then discharged in 1652 upon payment of the fine.<h2>
<a name="TheinterregnumandRestoration"></a>The interregnum and Restoration</h2>Newport's activities during the interregnum remain relatively obscure. In December 1653 he presented a petition to the council of state. Two months later he and Lord Vaux were summoned before the council, having &#145;been apprehended on a warrant touching challenge&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1653&#150;4</i>, 404). In February 1655 he was reportedly one of Clarendon's chief correspondents. It is likely that the courier was the countess, who was travelling regularly between England and the Low Countries during the mid-1650s. In June 1655, in the wake of Penruddock's rising, Newport was briefly committed to the Tower on suspicion of treason, and in June 1657 the Cromwellian agent Colonel Bampfield urged that the countess be sent for and examined. In November of that year Newport attended the marriage of his great-nephew Robert Rich, grandson of the earl of Warwick, to Cromwell's daughter Frances, and reportedly &#145;danced with her Highness&#146;  (<span class="italic">Fifth Report</span>, HMC, 177).<br>
<br>After the Restoration, on 24 June 1660 Newport was formally discharged from the office of master of the ordnance, and appointed instead as a gentleman of the bedchamber. On 10 November 1662 he was granted a pension of &pound;1000 a year from this office, subsequently backdated to 24 June 1660. He died &#145;of the stone&#146;  (GEC, <span class="italic">Peerage</span>, 9.552) on 12 February 1666 at St Aldate's, Oxford, having gone there from London to avoid the plague. He was buried three days later on 15 February in the south aisle of Christ Church Cathedral. The following year his widow married Thomas Weston, fourth earl of Portland. She died on 26 May 1669, at Newport House in St Martin-in-the-Fields, and was privately buried, as a Catholic, in the chapel at Somerset House.<h2>
<a name="Assessment"></a>Assessment</h2>The overall impression of Newport's character and career is of someone who failed to live up to his early promise. Royal favour, allied to good fortune and high connections, helped him to achieve prominence at court at a notably young age. However, both before and during the civil wars he seems to have been guided principally by a wish to protect his own interests, and he apparently lacked firm political convictions. In the early 1640s he tried to maintain his links with both the king and leading parliamentarians for as long as possible, with the result that he eventually aroused suspicion on all sides. Increasingly perceived as untrustworthy, and lacking either the ability or the ambition to attain high office, his political influence was gradually eclipsed and he declined into relative obscurity from the later 1640s onwards.<br>
