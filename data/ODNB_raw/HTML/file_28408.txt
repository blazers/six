<span class="headword">Wake,  Thomas</span>, second Lord Wake  (1298&#150;1349), <span class="occ">nobleman</span>, was the son and heir of John, first Lord Wake (1268&#150;1300), and Joan (<i>d</i>. 1309), who was probably the daughter of Sir John Fitzbernard of Kingsdown, Kent. He was born about 20 March 1298. After the death of his father his lands and marriage fell into the custody of the crown and various of his estates were granted in wardship to his mother, Henry de Lacy, earl of Lincoln, Piers Gaveston, earl of Cornwall, and Queen Isabella, wife of Edward II. He married, before 9 October 1316, without the king's permission, Blanche, daughter of Henry of Lancaster, later earl of Leicester and Lancaster; Edward II, who had been hoping to organize a match with Joan, daughter of the deceased Gaveston, was initially angered at this breach of his rights and fined Wake &pound;1000. However, on 6 June 1317 the king, at the request of Wake's father-in-law, showed Thomas favour by allowing him to take seisin of his estates while still under age. Although Wake supported actions against the Despensers and had to be instructed not to attend the meeting of the king's baronial opponents summoned by his wife's uncle Thomas, earl of Lancaster, at Doncaster in November 1321, he appears to have remained loyal to the king during and after the civil war of 1322. In 1325 he was referred to as &#145;the king's cousin&#146;  (<span class="italic">CDS</span>, 3, no. 859); the marriage of his sister, Margaret, to Edward II's half-brother, Edmund, earl of Kent, in the same year, established a further link with the royal house.<br>
<br>Wake held lands in Lincolnshire, where his family had long been established at Bourne, but he also inherited important estates in Yorkshire, especially in and around Cottingham. In addition he had extensive landed interests in Westmorland and Cumberland: the castle of Liddel in the latter county was regarded as his <i>caput honoris</i>. Consequently he was much involved in the Scottish wars of Edward II and Edward III. He was regularly summoned to serve against the Scots between 1318 and 1323. He was expected to take forty men to the campaign of 1318, and although he was absent from Edward II's unsuccessful siege of Berwick in 1319, he again sent troops. In April 1323, when negotiations were under way for a thirteen-year truce, he was one of several English noblemen sent to Scotland to act as hostages for the Scots' ambassador, the earl of Moray. In December 1324 he was also summoned to serve in Aquitaine with John de Warenne, earl of Surrey (<i>d</i>. 1347), during the war of St Sardos.<br>
<br>By March 1326 the first signs of political disaffection became evident when Wake was reported to have disobeyed a summons to attend the king's council. It is not clear whether Wake was influenced by his father-in-law, by his own political judgement of the Despensers, or by his personal grievances against a regime which, by coming to terms with the Scots, had effectively deprived him of certain ancestral lands and rights north of the border. Whatever the case, Wake clearly supported the invasion of England by Queen Isabella and her lover, Roger Mortimer, in September 1326. He joined Isabella and Mortimer at Gloucester and was one of the barons who agreed on 25 October at Bristol that the king's eldest son should be made keeper of the realm. The benefits of office soon followed. Wake was justice of the forests south of the Trent from 10 November 1326 to May 1328 and keeper of the Tower of London from 9 December 1326 to April 1328; he was also appointed keeper of Hertford Castle on 9 December 1326. In the parliament that met at Westminster in January 1327 he was appointed as one of the members of a council set up under the presidency of his father-in-law to guide the administration of the realm during the youth of the new king, Edward III. It is possible that he also held the office of king's chamberlain for a short period during the early stages of the new reign.<br>
<br>Isabella and Mortimer owed much to the support of the northern barons, and it is not surprising that they quickly determined to launch a campaign against the Scots. Wake responded in person to the feudal summons issued on 5 April 1327 and served on the ensuing ill-fated expedition. He was appointed a commissioner to treat with the Scots in the resulting peace negotiations. However, the treaty made at Edinburgh and confirmed by the parliament of Northampton in 1328 was a humiliating admission of English defeat and particularly irksome to Wake and the other disinherited, since it made no specific provision for the restitution of their lands in Scotland. These personal grievances, coupled with Roger Mortimer's rapid and alarming rise to power, explain why Wake joined Henry of Lancaster in refusing to attend the parliament of Salisbury in October 1328 and acted as his father-in-law's spokesman in meetings of the discontented barons at London in December. On 29 December the king announced his intention of moving against this mounting opposition, but promised to pardon all those who submitted before 7 January. Wake joined Lancaster and others in declaring that they would not proceed against the king, but this was to no avail and on 16 January the escheators were ordered to seize the estates of the rebels. About the same time the Lancastrian party was forced to submit near Bedford; Wake was allowed seisin of his lands by orders issued on 20 February, but only on condition that he bound himself to pay the enormous sum of 15,000 marks. A year later Wake was accused of complicity in the supposed conspiracy of his brother-in-law the earl of Kent, had his lands confiscated again, and was forced to flee to France. He remained in exile until after Mortimer's fall from power and Edward III's assumption of authority in October 1330. Thereafter the king was quick to restore him to favour: Wake was summoned home, formally pardoned, had his estates restored under orders of 9 December 1330, and his unpaid fine remitted on 12 December. Finally, on 30 December 1330, Edward III demanded restitution of Wake's Scottish lands from David II, a demand repeated, though to no avail, in February 1331 and April 1332. Wake's appointment as keeper of the Channel Islands from 18 October 1331 to 3 February 1333 was another mark of Edward's confidence in his ability and loyalty: Wake was frequently referred to as the king's kinsman in instruments of Edward III.<br>
<br>In 1332 Henry Beaumont organized a campaign against the Scots on behalf of the disinherited and achieved a notable victory at Dupplin Moor. Wake's support for this enterprise is indicated by a petition he addressed to Edward III before 22 April, which declared his refusal to be bound by the treaty of Edinburgh until such time as he was restored to his Scottish lands. He was prevented from participating in the Dupplin Moor campaign by a violent feud with the abbot of Crowland. However, he took part in at least some of the later expeditions launched by Edward III against the Scots. He was summoned to the campaign of 1333 and was one of the witnesses to the letters patent of 12 June 1334 by which Edward Balliol, the English-backed claimant to the throne of Scotland, handed over sovereignty of the lowland shires to the king of England. In September 1337 he also led a twelve-day foray from Carlisle into Scotland. At the same time, however, he became increasingly involved in the diplomatic and defensive strategies that preceded the outbreak of the Hundred Years' War. In 1335 he was sent to France with the bishop of Norwich and others to discuss Anglo-French tensions and the projected crusade. Wake was part of a group of northern lords who remained in England after the king's departure for the continent in the summer of 1338 to defend the Scottish march and assist in the government of the realm. Wake became a particularly prominent member of the domestic administration after the king's brief return to England in the spring of 1340. He was appointed to the committees set up in the parliament of March&#150;May 1340 to investigate the king's finances and to receive petitions and prepare legislation. In April he was pardoned all his debts to the crown and was appointed one of the assessors in the city of London for the new tax of a ninth granted in parliament. On 28 May he was selected as a member of the council appointed to run the country under the titular regency of Edward, duke of Cornwall, when the king once more left for the Low Countries.<br>
<br>A late fourteenth-century St Albans chronicle claims that Wake was imprisoned by the king on the latter's unexpected return to England in December 1340  (<span class="italic">Chronicon Angliae</span>, 10). However, no other source mentions Wake's name among the list of ministers dismissed and/or imprisoned during this political crisis, and it seems unlikely that Wake was treated in this way. In fact, he was appointed on 12 December to inquire into grievances brought against the king's ministers and was a member of the judicial commission set up in East Anglia to hear accusations of corruption against the local agents of the crown. The real focus of the king's wrath was John Stratford, archbishop of Canterbury. Although there is no evidence of Wake's response to the king's decision to exclude Stratford from the parliament of April&#150;May 1341, Wake was one of the members of the lords' committee subsequently set up to hear Edward's charges against the archbishop; he also served on the legislative committee of 1341.<br>
<br>Wake remained active in public life during the 1340s. He was a trier of petitions in the parliaments of 1341, 1344, 1346, and January 1348. In November and December 1342 he was asked to serve with the king in Brittany; later in the same year he received wages for keeping the northern march for three months with two knights and eighteen esquires. In February 1346 his castle of Liddel was besieged and his lands seized by Sir William Douglas, but in April 1346 he was excused from going north to fight on the grounds of ill health. Liddel Castle was captured by the Scots shortly before the battle of Nevilles Cross later in the same year and its keeper, Sir Walter Selby, was put to death.<br>
<br>Wake died on 30 or 31 May 1349; although the cause of death was not specified, his demise coincided with the first outbreak of bubonic plague in England. He was buried at his own foundation of Haltemprice Priory, Yorkshire. Wake had demonstrated his personal piety by planning, and presumably undertaking, a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela in 1341&#150;2, and throughout his career he had shown a particularly keen interest in the religious orders. He had founded the Franciscan house at Ware, Hertfordshire, in 1338 and had planned to establish a house for the Crutched Friars at Kirkby Moorside, Yorkshire, in 1347&#150;8, though nothing came of the latter plan. His proposal to alienate lands for the foundation of a religious house for an unspecified order at Great Harrowden, Northamptonshire, in 1338 also proved abortive, as did his declared intention of <i>c</i>.1345 to establish a house of Dominican nuns in England. The failure of these schemes may be explained at least in part by lack of resources: Wake was often in debt, and in 1334 he was even accused of appropriating the chapel at Pontefract that contained the shrine of the unofficial saint, Thomas of Lancaster, in order to lay claim to the offerings made there. His principal foundation was therefore his first: namely a house of Augustinian canons, licensed in 1320 and first established in 1322 at Cottingham, Yorkshire, by members of the Augustinian priory of Bourne, Lincolnshire. In 1325 Wake obtained a licence from the pope, John XXII, allowing him to transfer this community to a more convenient location, and in January 1326 the canons moved to the nearby site of Haltemprice. The house, dedicated to the Virgin and Holy Cross, was intended to have a full quota of thirteen canons, but only three were recorded in 1328&#150;9; the numbers had risen to nine by 1381.<br>
<br>Thomas Wake left no children, and the Wake estates and barony passed via his sister Margaret to the earls of Kent and thence to the Holland family. His widow, Blanche, was involved in an acrimonious and violent quarrel with Thomas de Lisle, bishop of Ely, as a result of a land dispute between two of their servants. In the parliament of November 1355 Lady Wake appealed directly to Edward III for assistance, and the king announced that he was taking the matter into his own hands. He ordered the immediate seizure of the bishop's temporalities, and although his ministers successfully opposed this on the grounds that it contravened one of his own statutes of 1340, a judgment against Lisle in the king's bench in October 1356 gave Edward the legal basis he needed in order to confiscate the episcopal estates. The whole business suggests very close personal and family ties between Edward III and his cousin Lady Wake from which the latter's husband had undoubtedly benefited in his lifetime. Blanche herself died shortly before 12 July 1380 and was buried at the Franciscan convent at Stamford, Lincolnshire.<br>
