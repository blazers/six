<span class="headword">Webster,  Henry George <span class="st"> [Harry]</span></span>  (1917&#150;2007), <span class="occ">automotive engineer</span>, was born on 27 May 1917 at 53 Sir Thomas White's Road, Coventry, the only son of William George Webster, engineer (and later hotel proprietor), and his wife, Daisy Maud, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Thompson. He was educated at Welshpool county school, Montgomeryshire, after which he studied engineering at Coventry Technical College. On leaving college in 1932 he took up an apprenticeship at Coventry's Standard Motor Company. After six years he became an assistant technical engineer, a post held until 1940, when he was appointed deputy chief inspector in Standard's aircraft department. A year after the war ended he reverted to automotive engineering. Meanwhile, on 1 August 1943, at St Barbara's Church, Earlsdon, he married Margaret Alice (Peggy) Sharp (1916&#150;2003), also from Coventry, daughter of Harry Sharp, engineer. They had one daughter.<br>
<br>In 1948, under the auspices of the firm's director of engineering, Ted Grinham, Webster was appointed Standard Motor's chief chassis engineer; in 1955 he was promoted chief engineer. He was made a director of Standard Triumph International, as the firm became in 1957, while remaining chief engineer. He held these positions until 1968 when, following the creation of British Leyland (BL) through a series of mergers in the car industry, he became technical director of BL's Austin Morris division at Longbridge, Birmingham, where he remained until 1974.<br>
<br>From 1948 until 1952 Webster's prime responsibility at Standard was for the design and refinement of the Triumph sports car, which was in great need of regeneration and modernization. The TR2, launched in 1953, proved a sporting, commercial, and export success. On his subsequent appointment as director of engineering in 1957 he assembled an enthusiastic team of engineers at Standard's Canley site and between them they established a pre-eminent reputation in developing sports cars and derivatives within a short time and with limited finance. Throughout its post-war history Standard was extremely short of investment capital until it was taken over by the truck-maker Leyland in 1960&#150;61. Webster's personal relationship with the Italian car designer Giovanni Michelotti of Turin began in 1957 and lasted for many years.<br>
<br>When Standard was taken over by Leyland, Triumph sports cars were beginning to show their worth in the marketplace. Consequently Webster's superiors, including Alick Dick, Stanley Markland, and Donald Stokes, gave him their support. Crucial to Standard's success in this niche market was the advent of the Triumph Herald in 1959. The sleek lines of the Herald were Italian in origin and it was sold as a saloon, a coup&eacute;, and a convertible. Remarkably the car had a better turning circle than a London taxi. It also enjoyed an initial basic selling price of &pound;702, representing excellent value in the early 1960s. The car was designed very quickly, and with precious little finance available Webster had to prove resourceful. Normally a car of this period would have had a monocoque body and chassis unit, but the sums of money required for this were far beyond Standard's resources. To compensate for this there was a reversion to pre-Second World War technology. This involved using a strong separate chassis and then adding modern all-independent suspension. This type of thinking was considered ingenious and helped define Webster's reputation in the field of automotive engineering. Additionally the Herald helped establish Triumph cars as &#145;sexy&#146;, which was unusual for such a small firm and led to the identification and exploitation of several niche markets. From the Triumph stable then flowed a range of cars like the sporty Triumph Vitesse, the Spitfire, and the GT6. Perhaps the most remarkable was the Triumph Dolomite 2000, an executive car that rivalled both BMW and Rover as well as bringing refinement to middle-class motoring in Britain, while the TR5 was the first UK-produced vehicle to have fuel injection as a standard feature. This period represented the high point of success for Triumph, especially when in 1961 its TRS racing sports car won the team prize at Le Mans and its Spitfires claimed victory in the capacity class there.<br>
<br>On the creation of BL in 1968 Webster was transferred to Longbridge, the firm's Austin Morris division. Although BL enjoyed 33 per cent of the UK market in 1968 it had little capital and suffered from the problem of ageing models with few new ones on the immediate horizon. Within six years of its foundation the firm was all but bankrupt and taken into public ownership under the National Enterprise Board. Webster found Longbridge quite different from his Coventry base at Canley. In addition to having little money, weak management, and a seeming lack of corporate vision, the company was racked by industrial disputes. Moreover, his job at BL included confronting Sir Alec Issigonis, whose Mini 1100 and 1300 designs were technically excellent and popular but singularly unprofitable, leaving Webster little choice but to shunt Issigonis aside and put him in command of the company's research arm. This left Webster free to work on such new models as the Austin Allegro and the Morris Marina, but under financial constraints so severe that neither product was developed properly and both were failures in the marketplace. In 1974 Webster left BL to become group technical director at the automotive component manufacturer Automotive Products, based in Leamington Spa. He retired in 1983. He was chairman of SKF Steel UK from 1982 to 1987. He was a fellow of the Society of Automotive Engineers, and was appointed CBE in 1974.<br>
<br>Throughout his career Webster appears to have been a modest man and was &#145;flabbergasted&#146; when after his retirement from public life several of his vehicles were designated as &#145;classic cars&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Independent</span>, 17 Feb 2007). He himself was somewhat revered by a group of Triumph car owners who had formed the Triumph Sports Six club at Lubenham in Leicestershire, where a walkway on the premises was named Webster Way. He died of heart disease at his home, the Old School House, 2 Barrowfield Lane, Kenilworth, Warwickshire, on 6 February 2007. His daughter as well as his wife predeceased him, but he was survived by grandchildren.<br>
