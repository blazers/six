<span class="headword">Wilson,  John</span>  (1927&#150;2006), <span class="occ">police officer</span>, was born on 24 February 1927 at 25 Amos Avenue, Newton Heath, Manchester, the son of Joseph Wilson, linen salesman, and his wife, Hannah, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Pinch. The family moved to Lincoln where he was educated at the City School. Called up as the Second World War was ending he served in the intelligence corps in Palestine, a fitting background for his later career, and an experience that also gave him his first brush with terrorists when Irgun gunmen, fighting for an independent Jewish state, infiltrated his base. The terrorists, disguised as British soldiers, arrived on a jeep and planned to raid the officers' mess for hostages. Nineteen-year-old Wilson found himself lined up against a wall with a sten gun stuck in his back and later dryly recalled that the only thing he could think of was his mother.<br>
<br>Demobilized in 1948, Wilson drifted through a number of jobs, including working as an advertising salesman for the <span class="italic">Lincolnshire Echo</span> and trading in fruit and vegetables in the London docks. He started an economics course at Manchester University, which proved to be a poor choice; Wilson, uninspired, played squash by day and bridge by night. On 23 September 1950, while still a student, he married (Marjorie) Joan Suthrell (1928&#150;2003), a chiropodist. Unsure of his career, Wilson consulted his former headmaster, who advised him to join the police.<br>
<br>Wilson began his career in the Metropolitan Police at the age of twenty-seven. After two unhappy years on the beat he decided to apply for special branch. The branch was then regarded as an &eacute;lite in which officers often stayed for the rest of their careers. Formed in the 1870s as the special Irish branch to combat Fenian terrorism, the department by the 1950s covered counter-terrorism, extremism, subversion and counter-espionage, the protection of politicians and VIPs, and also ran a national ports unit monitoring passenger arrivals and departures. Wilson had been turned down when he first applied but succeeded the second time. His introduction was inauspicious; a senior officer greeted Wilson's intake by telling the young officers that they should abandon hopes of reaching high rank because none would rise above sergeant. By the late 1960s Wilson was indeed still a detective sergeant after working in the branch's C squad, watching suspected political extremists, and A squad, which provided protection for VIPs. On one embarassing occasion he was guarding General Ne Win, the Burmese dictator, and was chased round the garden of the general's London home by a curious guest who demanded to see his gun. Wilson, who loathed firearms, had left his weapon at home.<br>
<br>The re-emergence of the IRA was the spark that ignited Wilson's career after he was drafted into the branch's largely dormant B squad, devoted to Irish terrorism. In 1971 Wilson received intelligence that the Provisional IRA was planning its first major attack on London under cover of a rail strike. Extra police were poured into central London. They could not prevent car bombs from being planted outside the Old Bailey, where one man was killed, at Scotland Yard itself, and at two other establishment targets; but the bombers, the &#145;Belfast ten&#146;, were caught within hours and the chaos could have been far worse if the police had not been alerted. Wilson received commendations from the commissioner of the Metropolitan Police, Sir Robert Mark, and from the trial judge for his work.<br>
<br>Throughout the 1970s Wilson, awarded a second commissioner's commendation in 1974, was a key figure in the fight against the IRA and loyalist extremists, repairing and building strong relationships with the Royal Ulster Constabulary, the Garda Siochana, the cabinet office, and politicians. He became an acknowledged expert on Irish terrorism and in 1976 was promoted to chief superintendent and head of the Irish section. Often blunt and forthright, he was also extremely loyal and supportive of his officers. In 1977 he was appointed MBE and in 1978 became commander heading all special branch operations. He was awarded the queen's police medal shortly before he retired in 1983.<br>
<br>Wilson spent eight years as security chief for Britoil, based in Glasgow, before settling in North Walsham, Norfolk. Always loyal to his service, in retirement he lobbied against the expansion of MI5 in the 1990s into Irish counter-terrorism. He argued that other threats like Islamic extremism might be ignored. He died at his home, South Cottage, Crostwight Hall, North Walsham, Norfolk, on 6 February 2006, of alcohol poisoning, and was cremated at St Faith crematorium, Horsham St Faith, Norfolk. He was predeceased by his wife and was survived by two daughters and a son.<br>
