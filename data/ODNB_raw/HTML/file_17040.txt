<span class="headword">Love, Sir  James Frederick</span>  (1789&#150;1866), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, son of John Love and his wife, Mary (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Wyse), was born in London. Commissioned ensign in the 52nd foot (26 October 1804), he advanced to lieutenant (5 June 1805), and served with the regiment during 1808 in Sweden and in Portugal, where after the convention of Cintra (30 August 1808) he was one of 107 officers and men to escort repatriated French troops to their point of embarkation. The following year he took part in the retreat of Lieutenant-General Sir John Moore's force to Corunna, but returned to Portugal with the 1st battalion of the 52nd later in 1809, fighting with it in various engagements until 1812 and securing a captaincy (11 July 1811). On the night of 11 March 1810, with courage and initiative, Love discovered that the enemy had abandoned Pombal, and at Busaco on 27 September 1810 he took prisoner the French general Simon. On 3 April 1811 at Sabugal, with his company he recaptured a howitzer lost by the 43rd earlier in the day, and three weeks later repulsed a dangerous French attack on the Marialva Bridge. With good sense and knowledge of his men, at Aruda in October 1810 he refused to declare one soldier a deserter, and shortly afterwards was vindicated when Tobin reappeared, having escaped from captivity. At Fuentes de O&ntilde;oro, on 5 May 1811, compassionately he released an enemy sergeant who had strayed across the line, after addressing him in fluent French.<br>
<br>Having returned to England in December 1813 with the 52nd's 2nd battalion, Love joined Lieutenant-General Sir Thomas Graham's expedition to the Netherlands, and three months later was engaged in the attack on Merxem and bombardment of Antwerp, after which he commanded the rear-guard as British troops withdrew. In January 1815 he acted as Major-General Sir John Lambert's aide-de-camp during the assault on New Orleans, where he was wounded in the arm and had two horses killed under him. Promoted brevet major (16 March 1815), he rejoined the 52nd in time to fight at Waterloo, where he was wounded four times during the regiment's decisive advance against the imperial guard on the evening of 18 June. Subsequently, he served with the 52nd in North America, and was made inspecting field officer of the New Brunswick as a brevet lieutenant-colonel on half pay (5 May 1825). In 1825, also, he married Mary Heaviside of Halifax, Nova Scotia; they had no children, and she survived her husband. He resumed regular service after obtaining a majority in the 11th foot on 9 November 1830. Learning of anti-reform riots in Bristol on 31 October 1831, while commanding troops in Cardiff, he swiftly gathered 170 men, commandeered a steamer at Newport, and that evening restored order to the relief of worried citizens: &#145;Thanks, thanks, brave fellows, you are come to save us from pillage and death&#146;  (Aggett, 44). He became lieutenant-colonel of the 76th (6 September 1834), then of the 73rd foot (6 March 1835), for three years commanding it in the Mediterranean, while also acting as British resident at Zante. He took the 73rd to Canada in May 1838, where it successfully quelled unrest, and returned with the regiment to England in June 1841. Meanwhile, he had been promoted colonel (28 June 1838) and appointed CB (30 March 1839), the same year that he became KH. Back in south Wales, he deployed troops effectively during the Chartist and Rebecca riots in 1842&#150;3.<br>
<br>Love went on half pay on 23 September 1845, having surrendered nominal command of the 73rd the previous day. Promoted major-general (11 November 1851), he was appointed lieutenant-governor of Jersey (1 April 1852), becoming KCB (4 February 1856) after leaving that post. He then briefly commanded the training camp at Shorncliffe, and became colonel of the 57th foot (24 September 1856) and temporary lieutenant-general (6 January 1857). He served as inspector-general of infantry for four years from April 1857, being promoted substantive lieutenant-general on 26 September 1857. Having advanced to general (10 August 1864), he was appointed colonel of the 43rd foot (5 September 1865) and GCB that same year. He died at 17 Ovington Square, Brompton, London, on 13 January 1866.<br>
