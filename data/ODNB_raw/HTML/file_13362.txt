<span class="headword">Gruffudd Hiraethog</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1564), <span class="occ">poet and herald</span>, was born in Llangollen, the son of Mathew, the son of Mawd y Glyn and Owain Cyfeiliog. He married Catrin, the daughter of Edward ap Robert ab Ieuan ab Owain Glynd&#373;r. The warrant granted to Gruffudd in 1545/1546 on graduating as <i>disgybl pencerddaidd</i> (senior pupil) has survived, and in it Lewis Morgannwg is named as his teacher. Later on he graduated as <i>pencerdd</i>, and became <i>athro</i> (teacher) for the three bardic provinces of Aberffraw, Dinefwr, and Mathrafal. As herald he was deputy over Wales under Garter, Norroy, and Clarenceux, the first known holder of the office. A copy of the instructions issued to him by the College of Arms is extant. Among his pupils were the notable <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/48659/', "Cywyddwyr")</script> (strict-metre poets) Lewis ab Edward, &#145;Sir&#146; Owain ap Gwilym, Owain Gwynedd, Si&ocirc;n Phylip, Si&ocirc;n Tudur, Wiliam Cynwal, and Wiliam Ll&#375;n, and on account of this alone he would have secured himself a significant place in the history of bardism in Wales.<br>
<br>Of Gruffudd Hiraethog's poems, 125 compositions in the form of <i>awdlau</i> (10) and <i>cywyddau</i> (115) have been preserved in manuscripts, as well as <i>englynion</i> (stanzas). They are typical of the strict-metre poetry of 1300&#150;1650, and consist of eulogies, elegies, satires, and begging and debate poems. They are well crafted, as expected, but for the most part are not particularly memorable. Their period is <i>c</i>.1535&#150;1564, and in the main they celebrate the generosity of patrons throughout north Wales. Only two poems to patrons living in south Wales have survived.<br>
<br>Gruffudd accomplished immense work as a genealogist and herald, and his collections contain material for both north and south Wales, and beyond. He was a careful and discerning chronicler, and his contributions in these fields are well regarded.<br>
<br>The miscellany consisting of proverbs, prose, and poetry compiled by Gruffudd Hiraethog to entertain expatriate Welshmen and to preserve the language in their midst is known as <span class="italic">Lloegr drigiant ddifyrrwch Brytanaidd Gymro</span> (&#145;Entertainment for the Britannic Welshman residing in England&#146;), and is deserving of special notice. The work was dedicated to Rhisiart Mostyn of Bodysgallen (near Llandudno), himself living in exile at the time. It was never published, and perhaps was only meant to be circulated in manuscript copies.<br>
<br>Gruffudd is also significant on account of his friendship with the great Renaissance scholar William Salesbury. Among the first books printed in Welsh was Salesbury's <span class="italic">Oll synnwyr pen Kembero ygyd</span> (1547), a collection of proverbs copied from one of Hiraethog's manuscripts, and in the preface he pays a generous tribute to the poet's achievements to date. Salesbury's &#145;Llyfr rhetoreg&#146; (1552) (&#145;Book of rhetoric&#146;) is dedicated to Gruffudd Hiraethog &#145;and others of his craft&#146;. This work was not intended for publication, but rather to acquaint the Welsh poets with the art of rhetoric. Here he refers to Gruffudd as &#145;my chief companion in such matters&#146;.<br>
<br>Gruffudd died in Llangollen in May 1564, and was buried there. The elegy for him by his pupil William Ll&#375;n is deservedly well known.<br>
