<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Gallagher,  John Andrew</span>  (1919&#150;1980), <span class="occ">historian</span>, was born at the maternity hospital, Birkenhead, on 1 April 1919, the only child of Joseph Gallagher and his wife, Mary Adeline, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Welsh. His father, a working-class Irishman, had fought in the 1st Canadian contingent during the First World War, and subsequently worked in Liverpool as a warehouseman and then a railwayman during the depression. In 1937 a major open scholarship took Gallagher from the Birkenhead Institute to Trinity College, Cambridge, where he took a first class in part one of the historical tripos (1939) before his studies were interrupted by the outbreak of the Second World War. He enlisted in the Royal Tank regiment and saw action as a sergeant tank driver (he refused a commission) in north Africa, Italy, and Greece. Returning to Cambridge after the war, he took a first in part two of the tripos (1946) and by 1948 had completed a dissertation, &#145;The British penetration of west Africa&#146;, resulting in his election to a prize fellowship at Trinity in the same year. In 1950 he was appointed as lecturer in colonial studies at Cambridge.<br>
<br>Gallagher migrated to Oxford in 1963 to become Beit professor of the history of the British Commonwealth. Though he developed many friendships in Oxford and was impressed by the quality of his students, he never really settled at Balliol, and eagerly returned to Trinity and Cambridge in 1971 to accept the Vere Harmsworth professorship of imperial and naval history. Trinity, in particular, he adored, as the college in turn adored him. From 1960 to 1963 he served as its dean, and from 1972 until his death as its vice-master. Many of the most moving tributes to Gallagher came from his Trinity colleagues.<br>
<br>Gallagher was an inspirational figure. A powerful historical imagination, a prodigious memory seasoned by extensive reading and travel, and a natural facility of expression all made for exhilarating conversation. Moreover, though in many ways a secretive and lonely man&#151;he never married&#151;he gave unstintingly of himself: he was patient with undergraduates, generous to research students, and loyal to colleagues. His company was thus highly sought after, as indeed were his opinions. In an era when there was less pressure to publish, he was able to write sparingly. But when he did put pen to paper the results were always luminous and transformative. Though he is mainly (and justifiably) known as a half of an internationally famous partnership with <a href="#cosubject_72344">Ronald Robinson [<i>see below</i>]</a>, equally important work was published under his sole name. Two fields of research merit particular attention, the first being his Ford lectures of 1973, the second his contribution to modern Indian historiography.<br>
<br>The publication of the Ford lectures&#151;<span class="italic">The Decline, Revival and Fall of the British Empire</span> (1982)&#151;owed much to his Trinity colleague, Anil Seal, with whom Gallagher worked in collaboration on modern India. Cited far less frequently than the work published jointly with Ronald Robinson, in many ways it is the Ford lectures that provide the key to Gallagher's thinking. Indeed, such was the importance he attached to the lectures that they were given a trial run in Cambridge seminars during the previous year. With typical economy of expression, the period from the Napoleonic wars through to the Suez crisis is covered in a mere eighty pages, testimony to what has since been described as Gallagher's &#145;all-embracing global range&#146;  (Hyam, 84). The empire is presented as a dynamic &#145;system of power&#146; whose decline was by no means a continuous process. We are told of its shifting geographical centre, the multiple techniques of expansion by which it was sustained, the sources of its fragility, and the way its history interlocked with events elsewhere in the world. Organized with beautiful simplicity around the categories of domestic, international, and colonial factors impinging on expansion, the lectures are also full of fun&#151;literary allusions and a variety of metaphors provide the vehicles for an irreverent yet sympathetic sense of humour. They remain one of the most accessible, the most enjoyable, and the most rewarding introductions to the history of the modern British empire.<br>
<br>Gallagher's second solo contribution was to the historiography of modern India. Later in his career he gradually turned his attention away from colonial Africa toward the raj, which he had long regarded the nerve centre of the British imperial system&#151;a mainstay of its military and economic power. The so-called Cambridge school of Indian historiography drew deeply on the ideas elaborated in two of his essays&#151;&#145;Congress in decline&#146; (<span class="italic">Modern Asian Studies</span>, 7, 1973) and &#145;Nationalisms and the crisis of empire&#146; (<span class="italic">Modern Asian Studies</span>, 15, 1981). While Gallagher had already pointed to the security of the Indian empire as the reason for the creation of an east African empire in the late nineteenth century, and a Middle Eastern empire after the First World War, he now began to explore the bases of Indian nationalism and the effect of government intervention thereon. He was particularly fascinated by the complex web of relationships which linked locality, province, and nation, the ways in which resources were bargained for and distributed in each of these spheres, and the part played (unintentionally) by the British in inducing Indians to organize themselves in ever larger groups.<br>
<br>Gallagher's thesis was that after 1918 financial imperatives impelled increasing levels of bureaucratic meddling in Indian social life, thus breaking the unwritten rule of colonial administration&#151;&#145;salutary neglect&#146;. In self-defence Indians had to mobilize politically; once they had done so, policy-making became more constrained by indigenous opinion, and &#145;collaborators&#146; (that is, &#145;moderate&#146; and constitutionally-minded nationalists) more necessary than ever before. Gallagher was extremely sceptical regarding the inflated claims of Congress: Gandhi and Nehru constantly talked up the representativeness of the movement, but they spoke of a unity which neither it, nor India, in fact possessed. None the less he had a sharp eye for the circumscriptions which colonial politics imposed on the working of imperialism in the subcontinent, not least over the use of the Indian army. Hitherto deployed freely overseas as an &#145;imperial mobile reserve&#146;, by 1939 the Indian army was being bankrolled by the British taxpayer rather than by the Bombay merchant or Bengali ryot. This, as Gallagher wryly remarked, was to be the true test of Britain's will for empire.<br>
<br>Ultimately, however, Jack Gallagher's name will always be linked with his collaborator, <a name="cosubject_72344"></a><span class="headword">Ronald Edward Robinson</span>  (1920&#150;1999)<span class="occ"></span>. Robinson was born at 18 Anhalt Road, Battersea, London, on 3 September 1920, the son of William Edward Robinson, a commercial traveller, and his wife, Ada Theresa, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Goldsmith. After attending Wix's Lane elementary school and Battersea grammar school, he was awarded a major scholarship to St John's College, Cambridge, where he matriculated in 1939. Sporting prowess won him a blue as a goalkeeper of the university soccer eleven in 1941; he also captained the college cricket team. From 1941 he trained as a pilot in southern Africa, to be posted as a flight lieutenant of the 58th bomber squadron flying missions over Germany, for which he was given the Distinguished Flying Cross in 1944; later in life he regularly had his old air crew at his Cambridge home for a new year singsong. After graduating in 1946 with upper seconds in both parts of the historical tripos (1941, 1946), he worked as a research officer (on the subject of trusteeship) in the African studies branch of the Colonial Office from 1947 to 1949, when he completed his PhD.<br>
<br>Robinson returned to St John's with a fellowship in 1949, and was appointed to a university lectureship in 1953. From 1966 to 1971 he was Smuts reader in the history of the British Commonwealth at Cambridge, and from 1971 to 1987 Beit professor of the history of the British Commonwealth at Oxford and a fellow of Balliol College, as well as chairman of the modern history faculty at Oxford (1974&#150;6). Unlike Gallagher he enjoyed Balliol and almost, perhaps, became an &#145;Oxford man&#146;. He was also very much a family man, with a very happy marriage to the American newspaper correspondent Alice Josephine Denny, whom he wed at Wandsworth Unitarian Church, London, on 12 August 1948; she was the daughter of Ludwell Howard Denny, a newspaper editorial writer. They had two sons and two daughters, of whom he was extremely proud. Alice Denny's role in the publication of <span class="italic">Africa and the Victorians</span>&#151;acknowledged on the book's front cover&#151;should not be underestimated. It was she who took charge of the project and gave the two men a timetable&#151;Gallagher, in particular, did not relish the discipline of sitting down to write.<br>
<br>In appearance Jack Gallagher and Robbie, as Robinson was known, could not have been more different. Gallagher presented a well-rounded figure; &#145;the Living Buddha&#146; was how some described him. The don Johnson Fruylen (&#145;all big-headed and baldy, with spindle-shanks and a bit of a tummy&#146;) in the novel <span class="italic">My Friend Judas</span> by Andrew Sinclair, is modelled on Gallagher. Robinson, by contrast, was a beanpole&#151;tall and straight of back. But their similarities are perhaps equally striking. They were both ebullient and enthusiastic, well known for their conviviality and generous hospitality; equally elusive, both men could make themselves invisible when they wished (something that frustrated administrators in particular); they were both innately conservative, while at the same time being anti-establishment, a tendency perhaps born of their working-class roots; and they were both born communicators, with a fund of choice phrases, who delighted in words and revelled in controversy. None the less, this was a partnership of thought as much as (or more than) it was a matter of sympathetic personalities. From the beginning they shared an intense interest in Africa, its partition, and the interplay of nationalism and imperialism in the continent; they also shared an impatience with Marxist scholarship, and were eager to refute the theory that imperialism was simply the economic exploitation of the wider world by European powers.<h2>
<a name="TheRobinsonandGallagherthesis"></a>The Robinson and Gallagher &#145;thesis&#146;</h2>Robinson and Gallagher first came together in their seminal essay &#145;The imperialism of free trade&#146;, published in the <span class="italic">Economic History Review</span> in 1953. How far the ideas and themes elaborated in this essay were truly original, or had in fact been anticipated by others and merely given a new &#145;spin&#146; by Robinson and Gallagher, is a moot point for future historians to decide. Either way, it is justly acclaimed as a landmark in the study of the British empire, and remains one of the most widely cited and influential articles in any field of post-war British history. It portrayed the nineteenth century as a period of relentless expansion, taking many different forms, whereby Victorian governments worked to establish British paramountcy by whatever means seemed locally most appropriate. The preferred mode of expansion was <i>informal</i>, resulting from the forces of economic and cultural attraction; the actual annexation of overseas territory (<i>formal empire</i>) was always a last resort&#151;a departure from the normal pattern of securing British interests in the wider world, undertaken not in response to organized opinion or electoral pressures, but in response to the perceptions of a policy-making &eacute;lite (the <i>official</i> or <i>collective</i> mind). Yet this policy-making &eacute;lite did not have an entirely free hand. If the limits on the independent action of statesmen in foreign and imperial policy were far looser than in other areas of policy, Britain's pursuit of profit and power was none the less constrained by a variety of external forces, which often obstructed overseas expansion. Central to the calculations of this official mind was India. Indeed, the early nineteenth century witnessed a major and conscious shift in British imperial policy&#151;a &#145;swing to the East&#146;&#151;whereby India became the nucleus of the British empire. Its unique political, economic, and strategic value meant that Victorian statesmen were prepared not only to intervene much more directly in its affairs than in those of other colonies, but to contemplate the acquisition of territory in other parts of the world to ensure its future safety and stability.<br>
<br>These themes were elaborated in Robinson's and Gallagher's co-authored book <span class="italic">Africa and the Victorians: the Official Mind of Imperialism</span>, first published in 1961, reprinted seven times, and issued in a second edition twenty years later. The book was a fearless and frontal assault on the Marxist interpretation of the late nineteenth-century partition of Africa. As one right-wing scholar later remarked, &#145;it annoyed all the right people&#146;  (Norman Stone in the preface to C. Bayly, ed., <span class="italic">Atlas of the British Empire</span>, 1989, 6). Robinson and Gallagher argued that the main impulse for Britain's involvement in these events was not to be found in the metropolitan economy but in local crises and proto-nationalisms on the periphery and in the colonial pretensions and policies of other European powers, in particular France. Rather than a new, industrially or financially motivated drive to empire at the end of the Victorian era, Robinson and Gallagher insisted that British imperialism was, if anything, more cautious, tentative, and defensive. Certainly, public opinion played little part in producing a more forward policy, as the main calls for expansion did not emerge until the 1890s when partition was already well under way. Similarly, the records of the Foreign, India, and Colonial offices gave no ground for thinking that business or commercial opinion was capable of pressuring government into taking new territory overseas. Rather, the motives of the official mind were first and foremost strategic. It was the defence of India which provided the key to understanding when, where, and why Britain reluctantly decided to extend its African empire.<br>
<br>The idea that imperialism needed to be redefined in terms of the interconnections between its European and extra-European components was revisited by Robinson in two important essays, &#145;Non-European foundations of European imperialism&#146; (published in R. Owen and R. B. Sutcliffe, eds., <span class="italic">Studies in the Theory of Imperialism</span>, 1972), and &#145;The excentric idea of imperialism&#146; (published in W. J. Mommsen and J. Osterhammel, eds., <span class="italic">Imperialism and after: Continuities and Discontinuities</span>, 1986). These essays were typical of Robinson's social scientific frame of mind. His <i>modus operandi</i> was to test hypotheses, to probe for the general principle, and to generalize from detailed case studies. This brought both clarity and analytical rigour to his work.<br>
<br>In Robinson's writing on &#145;collaboration&#146; two main propositions were advanced. The first was that the longevity of imperialism ultimately depended on working out a basis of co-operation (or collaboration, as Robinson preferred to call it) with the local population. The second stated that not only was collaboration inherent in the imperial relationship, but the choice of collaborators determined the organization, depth, and character of colonial rule. Though the word &#145;collaboration&#146; suggested that Europe was able to profit from the divisions and rivalries which riddled African and Asian societies, this was no mere theory of &#145;divide and rule&#146;. To be sure, the balance of terms between indigenous collaborators and their imperial masters was always unequal. But if terms became too unequal, they could not for long be sustained: either collaborators were alienated from their rulers, and withdrew their co-operation, or they were alienated from their subjects, and thus of little value. In many ways, therefore, the strength of imperialism rested on identifying and encouraging an influential yet pliable collaborating &eacute;lite. This was no easy task. As Britain found to its disappointment, and sometimes cost, in Turkey, China, and parts of Africa, such collaborators were not always forthcoming, and even when they were, their improved organization frequently turned the terms of co-operation progressively in their favour. Moreover, the British public's notorious parsimony meant that it was extremely difficult to commit the resources to these relationships that might have helped to shore them up.<br>
<br>It would be difficult to overestimate the scholarly impact of Robinson and Gallagher. Dubbed by one scholar the &#145;Morecambe and Wise&#146; of imperial history  (Clarke), they were said by another to have &#145;a sort of Laurel and Hardy quality to them&#146;  (Louis, 17). The most appropriate analogy for their importance may arguably lie, however, not in the field of comedy but in another sphere of the arts. It would probably not be an understatement to say that Robinson and Gallagher were to Commonwealth-imperial history what the Beatles were to popular music. Their multifaceted theory, first outlined in 1953, set the agenda for everyone else; after the publication of &#145;The imperialism of free trade&#146; the discipline could never be the same again. Indeed, in many ways it was Robinson and Gallagher who created the subject that we know today. Hence the shift in emphasis toward periphery-based, area studies from the 1960s onwards. Hence the proliferation of essays and books which have explicitly or implicitly set out to review (and revise) their work. Hence the inclusion of regions of informal empire (the Middle East, China, and Latin America) in the new <span class="italic">Oxford History of the British Empire</span>. And hence the way in which the discipline of Commonwealth-imperial history has in recent years been developing rather differently in the USA and in the UK: the former more open to new post-colonial perspectives, but concentrating on culture (in particular race) at the expense of the material and political dimensions to Britain's imperial past; the latter so steeped in the ideas and idioms of Robinson and Gallagher that it perhaps runs the risk of ignoring some of the more innovative areas of research.<br>
<br>Gallagher, who from humble beginnings rose to become one of the twentieth century's most distinguished and most cherished historians, died tragically, of acute cardiac and renal failure, at Trinity College, Cambridge, on 5 March 1980. Much of his research on India was still to be written up. Robinson, a self-assured character who made a powerful impression on the people who knew him, died of cancer at his home, 79 Mill Road, Cambridge, on 19 June 1999. At the time of writing, several scholars are trying to chart a new course for Commonwealth-imperial history for the twenty-first century, but the future of the discipline remains uncertain. It cannot yet be said whether anyone will succeed in stepping into their shoes.<br>
