<span class="headword">Pecke,  Thomas</span>  (<em>b. </em>1637, <em>d.</em> in or after 1664), <span class="occ">epigrammatist</span>, was born at Wymondham, Norfolk, the son of James Pecke of Wymondham. His mother's maiden name was Talbot. He was educated at Norwich School, under Thomas Lovering, the recipient of one of his epigrams. He matriculated at Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, on 3 October 1655; his tutor was William Naylor. He apparently left without a degree. He was admitted to the Inner Temple on 22 June 1657 and called to the bar on 12 February 1664. His uncle Thomas Pecke of Spixworth funded Thomas at university, but he withdrew his support when his nephew refused to travel to France; presumably his uncle wanted him to complete his education at a French academy  (Pecke, <span class="italic">Parnassi</span>, 175).<br>
<br>Pecke was a friend of Francis Osborne, the author of <span class="italic">Advice to a Son</span>, and when Osborne was attacked by John Heydon, in his <span class="italic">Advice to a Daughter</span>, Pecke replied with a pamphlet entitled <span class="italic">Advice to Balaam's Ass, or, Momus Catechised</span> (1658). The second edition of <span class="italic">Advice to a Daughter</span> (1659) includes a vituperative attack on Pecke, who is accused of having written &#145;a Dialogue of Polygamy&#146;. This is a reference to <span class="italic">A Dialogue of Polygamy</span>, published in 1657, translated from the work by Bernardino Ochino; it bears a dedicatory epistle to Francis Osborne, and there would seem to be little doubt that Pecke was indeed the translator.<br>
<br>Although Pecke was training as a lawyer, poetry was his preferred study; as he wrote in <span class="italic">Balaam's Ass</span>, &#145;I am none of the Greatest Stranger to Latin and English Poetry&#146;  (Pecke, <span class="italic">Balaam's Ass</span>, 12). In 1658 he published an elegy on John Cleveland, which was, according to his own account, received with plaudits  (Pecke, <span class="italic">Parnassi</span>, sig. A3). In 1659 he published <span class="italic">Parnassi puerperium</span> (&#145;The childbed of Parnassus&#146;), a collection of English epigrams which includes translations of Latin epigrams from John Owen and Sir Thomas More, and also of Martial's epigrams, describing the rarities to be seen at Rome. It also includes original epigrams on the twelve Caesars, and another set of epigrams in which Pecke addresses friends and mentors, or draws himself to the attention of prospective patrons. The collection is prefaced by commendatory Latin verses by Payne Fisher. Some of the poems printed as Pecke's were, in fact, composed by the printer James Cottrell, such as the epigram addressed to James Howell, who is described as the poet's adopted uncle. Pecke held that &#145;if a poem be good, it consists of nothing else, but various Epigrams; cemented by a dexterous sagacity&#146;  (ibid., sig. A3). Pecke also wrote satires, but in spite of his promise to publish them, they were never to appear in print. The first of Pecke's epigrams is addressed to Richard Cromwell, the lord protector; he is compared to Augustus and his father to Julius Caesar, while Pecke hopes that he will prove his Maecenas. Pecke's last publication was a <span class="italic">Heroick Poem</span>, a pamphlet of fourteen pages, published the following year, in celebration of the Restoration. There is a portrait of Pecke facing the title-page of <span class="italic">Parnassi puerperium</span>, below which Latin verses assert optimistically that he is the greatest ornament of a distinguished family whose pen will win him eternal fame.<br>
