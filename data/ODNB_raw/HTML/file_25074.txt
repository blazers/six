<span class="headword">Sempill,  Robert</span>, third Lord Sempill  (<em>c.</em>1505&#150;1573<span class="mult">x</span>6), <span class="occ">nobleman</span>, was the elder son of William Sempill, second Lord Sempill (<i>d</i>. 1552), and his first wife, Lady Margaret (<i>d</i>. before February 1523), eldest daughter of Hugh Montgomery, first earl of Eglinton. The family lands formed the barony of Sempill in Renfrewshire, and in 1544, while Robert was still master of Sempill, his father granted him a charter of the office of sheriff of Renfrew. The following year he was rewarded with the bailiary of Paisley Abbey, after supporting its monks in a dispute with heretics. Captured by the English at the battle of Pinkie in 1547, he returned to Scotland on his release and became embroiled in a series of personal quarrels. He had a long-standing feud with the protestant Alexander Cunningham, fourth earl of Glencairn; on 9 April 1549 John Mure of Caldwell and several accomplices tried to assassinate him; and on 11 June that same year he killed William, Lord Crichton of Sanquhar, in the Edinburgh lodgings of James Hamilton, second earl of Arran, lord governor of Scotland and head of the house of Hamilton. Arrested and imprisoned in Edinburgh Castle, Sempill would have been executed, but managed to extricate himself because one of his daughters was the mistress of the influential John Hamilton, archbishop of St Andrews, Arran's half-brother.<br>
<br>In the 1550s Sempill was a loyal supporter of Mary of Guise, queen dowager and from 1554 to 1560 regent of Scotland, in her struggle against the protestant lords of the congregation. By now feuding with Arran, Sempill attacked him in 1560, and as a result the lords of the west besieged and captured Castle Sempill. Sempill himself, however, had managed to escape to the safety of Dunbar Castle, which was garrisoned by the French force sent to help Mary of Guise. When Mary, queen of Scots, returned to Scotland in 1561 he gave her his support, and in the autumn of 1565 was one of the commanders of her army when she and her husband, Lord Darnley, rode against the rebellious earl of Moray and his forces in the chaseabout raid.<br>
<br>Sempill was present at the baptism of Mary and Darnley's son, the future James VI, on 17 December 1566, and one of his own sons married Mary Livingston, one of the queen's four Maries. After the murder of Darnley in 1567, Sempill allied himself with the dead man's father, Matthew Stewart, thirteenth earl of Lennox, and saved the earl's life when he was the victim of an attack in Glasgow. Sempill's hatred of the Hamiltons provided a thread of continuity in his career which predisposed him to sympathize with Lennox, their hereditary enemy. As a conservative Roman Catholic he presumably disapproved of Mary's willingness to tolerate protestantism, and of her increasing involvement with the protestant James Hepburn, fourth earl of Bothwell, the man generally believed to be responsible for Darnley's death. On 12 April 1567 Sempill was a member of the assize which tried Bothwell for Darnley's murder, and on 15 June he commanded the vanguard of the army which opposed the queen at Carberry Hill.<br>
<br>Sempill was one of the signatories of the act authorizing Mary's imprisonment at Lochleven, and when she escaped in 1568 he fought against her at the battle of Langside on 13 May. The following year, he and his old adversary Glencairn became lieutenants of the western parts, with instructions to crush all support for the queen, and in recognition of his efforts he received the gift of the abbey of Paisley. Still pursuing his feud with the earl of Arran, in 1570 he attacked and set fire to Arran's castle at Hamilton. Seized by some of the earl's men, he was imprisoned at Draffen and then in Argyll, but he was freed in 1571 and sat in parliament and on the privy council. On 2 July 1572 he was made lieutenant-general and justiciar of the sheriffdoms of Lanark and Renfrew.<br>
<br>The following year Sempill became involved in an ecclesiastical dispute, when he tried to intrude Sir John Hamilton, a Roman Catholic priest, into the vicarage of Eastwood, and as a result he was both outlawed and excommunicated. He died between 1 August 1573 and 17 January 1576. With his first wife, Isabel, daughter of Sir William Hamilton of Sanquhar, he had four sons and two daughters, and with his second wife, Elizabeth Carlyle, he had another son. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25077/', "Sir William Sempill")</script> was probably his illegitimate son. His complicated career combined old-style personal feuding with public office, and his conservative support of the Roman Catholic church earned him the condemnation of John Knox, who called him &#145;a man sold under sin, an enemy to God&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 1.339).<br>
