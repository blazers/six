<span class="headword">Whitelaw,  Annie Watt</span>  (1875&#150;1966), <span class="occ">headmistress and educationist</span>, was born on 17 August 1875 at 37 Dundas Street, Edinburgh, one of the twelve children of George Whitelaw (<i>c</i>.1837&#150;1888), accountant and treasurer of the synod of the United Presbyterian church, and his wife, Grace Hutton (<i>c</i>.1844&#150;<i>c</i>.1926). Both her parents came originally from Perth, but lived in Glasgow until her father decided to emigrate to New Zealand in 1878. Annie, her mother, and two of her siblings joined him in Auckland the following February, while the rest of her family arrived shortly afterwards. A sensitive, thoughtful child with an insatiable appetite for reading, Annie Whitelaw grew up in a large family home in the Auckland suburb of Ponsonby, where she enjoyed a happy childhood, despite the premature death of her father and two sisters. After receiving her primary education at the local school, she attended the Auckland Girls' High School before transferring to Auckland Girls' Grammar School in September 1888. There she was a senior district scholar in 1890 and passed the medical preliminary before leaving to further her studies overseas in April 1893.<br>
<br>A talented musician, Whitelaw initially thought of studying piano in Germany but eventually chose to study mathematics at Girton College, Cambridge, which she entered in 1894. She obtained second-class honours in part one of the mathematical tripos in 1897, and joined the staff of Wycombe Abbey School in Buckinghamshire as a mathematics teacher. There she enjoyed the companionship of several Girton friends and came under the care of the headmistress, Jane Frances Dove, who recognized her leadership qualities and made her a house tutor in 1899. Whitelaw developed a close friendship with her headmistress and the two Old Girtonians travelled to Dublin together to receive their MA degrees <i>ad eundem</i> from Trinity College in July 1905.<br>
<br>Whitelaw, or A. W. as she was known, remained at Wycombe Abbey until 1906, when she was appointed headmistress of Auckland Girls' Grammar School. A forceful, dynamic young woman with &#145;bright blue eyes, wavy ash-blond hair and an engaging smile&#146;  (&#145;Tribute&#146;, 8), she returned to her old school determined to establish a routine of work and play which would equip her pupils for the &#145;responsible part&#146; they were &#145;expected to take in the development of a great Dominion&#146;  (Auckland Girls' grammar school, 21). However, a two-year delay in completing the school's new facilities meant that she had little more than a year in which to set the changes in motion before she was called back to England.<br>
<br>After returning to Wycombe Abbey as headmistress in September 1910, A. W. developed a strong relationship with her staff, who supported her &#145;questing spirit&#146; as she set about shaping the school into a &#145;closely knit community &hellip; where talents and gifts of all kinds could find their meaning in the service of something worthwhile&#146;  (&#145;Tribute&#146;, 24). As an &#145;old friend&#146; of the school  (ibid., 25), she also enjoyed the backing of its council, who financed her building projects and supported her campaign for the establishment of a school chapel.<br>
<br>A deeply religious woman, who had been confirmed as an Anglican while at Wycombe, Whitelaw regarded worship &#145;as the most important, vital, the happiest and biggest thing in life&#146; and became convinced that the school needed its own chapel  (&#145;Tribute&#146;, 25). An entertaining and imaginative scripture teacher, she inaugurated daily intercession services in &#145;Big School&#146; during the war and launched a successful chapel appeal fund in 1921. Outside the school she took an active interest in social and religious work and encouraged her pupils to do likewise. As a result, she established a Seniors Social Service Committee and supported the London mission work of Father George Potter through her involvement with the Union of Girls' Schools for Social Service in Camberwell. During her fifteen years as headmistress, she also took a keen interest in educational developments and was the founder and first president of the Association of Head Mistresses of Boarding-Schools.<br>
<br>Whitelaw resigned her post at Wycombe in 1925 to devote herself to social and religious work; she was appointed to a Colonial Office committee on native education and spent six months inspecting schools and colleges in south and central Africa in 1926. On her return to England she became the director of women's education at the Selly Oak Missionary Colleges near Birmingham and lectured there for three years before resigning and moving to London. There she was appointed warden of the Talbot Settlement, an Anglican women's mission dedicated to work in certain parishes in Camberwell, and found scope for her administrative talents; she employed her charm and charisma to fill the house with residents and raise funds to rid the settlement of its debts.<br>
<br>After returning to live with her sisters in Auckland in 1938, Whitelaw renewed contact with her old school and joined the congregation of St Mark's Church, Remuera. Although she missed her friends in England, she kept herself busy by supporting the work of the New Zealand Federation of University Women as a vice-president of its Auckland branch in 1938, 1939, and 1944, while in 1941 she was a member of a commission which examined Maori educational work under the Anglican church. Between 1941 and 1945 she also served on the board of directors of the YWCA, chairing a committee which was responsible for establishing a library for service personnel.<br>
<br>After making two extended visits to England in 1948 and 1953, Whitelaw settled back in Auckland and spent her last years living alone in her home, where she was cared for by her extended family and many devoted friends. After recovering from a stroke, she died at her home, 57 Arney Road, Remuera, Auckland, on 11 August 1966 from pulmonary oedema. Her funeral was held at St Mark's Church and her ashes were interred at Purewa cemetery, Meadowbank, Auckland. Memorial services were held for her in two countries&#151;the first attended by the staff and 1100 pupils of Auckland Girls' Grammar School at St Matthew's Church in Auckland and the second in the chapel at Wycombe Abbey, where her name lives on in the Whitelaw Memorial Library.<br>
