<span class="headword">Wenman,  Thomas</span>, second Viscount Wenman  (1596&#150;1665), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was the elder of two surviving sons of <a name="cosubject_29045"></a><span class="headword">Richard Wenman</span>, first Viscount Wenman  (1572/3&#150;1640)<span class="occ"></span>, and his first wife, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29044/', "Agnes Wenman (d. 1617)")</script>. His father was the eldest son of Sir Thomas Wenman (<i>d</i>. 1577) of Thame Park, Oxfordshire, and his wife, Jane, daughter of William West, first Baron De La Warr (of the second creation). Richard Wenman matriculated at Oxford on 8 December 1587 as a scholar of John Case, formerly fellow at St John's College, but does not seem to have taken a degree. About 1595 he married Agnes, daughter of Sir George Fermor; they had eight children. For his bravery as a volunteer at the taking of Cadiz, Richard Wenman was shortly afterwards knighted by the earl of Essex, on 22 or 27 June 1596. Following Agnes's death in the summer of 1617, on 4 November 1618 at St Bartholomew-the-Great, London, he married Anne, the reputedly rich widow of Robert Chamberlayne, and previously of Thomas Roland. Wenman was returned as one of the MPs for Oxfordshire on 20 December 1620, and again in 1625. In 1627 he acted as sheriff for Oxfordshire, and in the following year, by letters patent dated 30 July 1628, was created Baron Wenman of Kilrainham, co. Meath, and Viscount Wenman of Tuam. Anne having died, he married twice more; his third wife, Elizabeth, was buried at Twyford, Buckinghamshire, on 27 April 1629, and his fourth wife, Mary, daughter and coheir of Thomas Keble of Essex, was buried there on 28 July 1638. He died on 3 April 1640, and was buried at Twyford on 7 April.<br>
<br>Thomas Wenman matriculated from Balliol College, Oxford, on 23 November 1604, aged eight; he entered the Inner Temple as a student in 1614. Shortly before 5 July 1617 he married Margaret, second daughter and later coheir of Edmund Hampden of Wendover, Buckinghamshire, and Margaret Ball. He was knighted on 10 September 1617, and on 11 December 1620 was returned to parliament for Brackley in Northamptonshire, retaining his seat until August 1625. He was returned for Oxfordshire in February 1626 and for Brackley on 3 March 1628. In the 1630s he served in Ireland and on 20 December 1639 King Charles ordered that &#145;in return for his forwardness in serving the Crown in Ireland, his arrears of creation money be paid up, and the fee paid regularly in future&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP Ire.</span>, <i>1633&#150;47</i>, 229). It appears, however, that Wenman did not own property in Ireland, because in May 1641 his proxy vote conveyed to the earl of Thomond was contested on that basis by the peers sitting in Dublin. Perhaps soon after the death of his father in April 1640 and his succession as second viscount, Wenman had returned to England, where he was returned as MP for Oxfordshire on 28 October 1640.<br>
<br>At the outbreak of the civil war Wenman was a moderate advocate of the parliamentarian cause, but quickly gravitated to the peace party. When Charles advanced on London in late 1642, he was one of the five commissioners who met him at Colnbrook on 11 November, with a petition from parliament proposing negotiations. Wenman and his fellow commissioners proceeded to Oxford on 1 February 1643 with proposals for an accommodation. In 1644 he was appointed a commissioner to carry new peace proposals to the king, attending him at Oxford on 24 November, and was present at the end of the year during the negotiations at Uxbridge. His anxiety for peace may well have been increased by the royalists' seizure of his estates, and on 3 June he obtained from parliament a grant of &pound;4 a week for his maintenance pending their recovery. On 20 August 1646 the allowance was discharged by order of the house. In April 1647 Wenman was nominated to the parliamentary committee appointed to supervise the visitors of Oxford University. In this period he often visited Bulstrode Whitelocke's house and engaged there in discussions with other members of parliament. On 28 December 1647, Whitelocke &#145;and Mr Pierrpont dining with the Lord Wenman, they had much discourse about the Scotts proceedings in the Treaty of the Isle of Wight, and feared a new war&#146;  (<span class="italic">Diary of Bulstrode Whitelocke</span>, 203). On 1 September 1648 he was once more appointed a peace commissioner, to treat with the king at Newport, and has plausibly been characterized as prepared for a peace on almost any terms. He was one of those who voted that the terms accepted by Charles were sufficient grounds for the house to proceed upon, and for this was secluded at Pride's Purge in December, and imprisoned. On his release in 1649 he retired to Thame, employing as his chaplain there Seth Ward, later bishop of Salisbury, who had been driven from Cambridge for opposing the solemn league and covenant. After the conquest of Ireland, Wenman became one of the adventurers, subscribing &pound;600 and on 23 February 1654 received a grant of 1000 acres in the barony of Garricastle in King's county.<br>
<br>Wenman was returned for Oxfordshire in the Convention Parliament of 1660, and was introduced by proxy to the Irish house of peers on 13 July 1661 in succession to his father. He died on 25 January 1665, and was buried at Twyford two days later. He was succeeded as viscount by his brother Philip (1610&#150;1686). His wife, Margaret, had died on 1 May 1658 and been buried at Twyford. Their son Richard (<i>b</i>. 1621/2) died childless in 1646, so Wenman's substantial wealth was divided between his brother and the families of his daughters, Frances, wife of Richard Samwell of Upton, Penelope, wife of Sir Thomas Cave of Stanford in Northamptonshire, Elizabeth, wife of Sir Greville Verney of Compton Verney, Warwickshire, and Mary, wife of her cousin Sir Francis Wenman of Caswell in Oxfordshire, who was named as his father-in-law's executor.<br>
