<span class="headword">Furnival,  Elizabeth <span class="st"> [Fanny; </span></span> <span class="st"> <em>known as </em>Mrs Kemble]</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1731&#150;1752), <span class="occ">actress and singer</span>, took her first known role as Lady Grace in John Vanbrugh's and Colley Cibber's <span class="italic">The Provok'd Husband</span> on 10 February 1731 at the Haymarket Theatre, London, where she and her husband, Thomas Furnival (<i>d</i>. 1773), were engaged for the 1730&#150;31 season. According to William Chetwood, while playing at York, in 1736 Mrs Furnival was noticed by a noble person who arranged for her Drury Lane d&eacute;but in the title role of Beaumont's and Fletcher's <span class="italic">The Scornful Lady</span> on 17 March 1737. Despite performing several other parts that season, including Lady Townly in <span class="italic">The Provok'd Husband</span> for a benefit she shared with her husband and Charles Macklin, she was given little opportunity to act tragic roles and was advised to try to make a name for herself in Dublin. Following two more Drury Lane seasons, during which she performed Portia, Goneril, and Lady Fidget in William Wycherley's <span class="italic">The Country Wife</span>, she moved to the Smock Alley Theatre in Dublin, where she played over thirty parts from 1739 to 1742, including Hamlet in 1741. She also toured during this time. From 1742 to 1744, when her husband left Ireland and they presumably separated, she acted at the Aungier Street theatre in Dublin. She was performing with the United Company in 1744&#150;5; the following season the company began at Aungier Street but moved to Smock Alley in December 1745.<br>
<br>It was during this season that Furnival shared a celebrated rivalry with George Anne Bellamy. The latter wanted Furnival's role as Constance in <span class="italic">King John</span> and schemed with her influential patroness Mrs Butler to ensure poor houses until she got her way. Fanny's ill-judged revenge occurred after George Anne again took one of her parts, Cleopatra in John Dryden's <span class="italic">All for Love</span>. Relegated to Octavia (and jealous of George Anne's notices), Furnival stole the diamond-studded costume borrowed from Mrs Butler (in some accounts the dress had been given to George Anne by the princess of Wales). When she appeared on stage Thomas Sheridan was astounded by her &#145;borrowed plumes&#146;  (Bellamy, 1.83) and Mrs Butler exclaimed, &#145;Good heaven, the woman has got on my diamonds!&#146;  (ibid.). The audience cried &#145;No more Furnival!&#146; until she &#145;very prudently called fits to her aid, which incapacitated her from appearing again&#146;  (ibid., 1.84). The part was taken over by Mrs Elmy.<br>
<br>Fanny Furnival returned to Drury Lane, replacing Mrs Macklin as Lady Macbeth opposite Spranger Barry on 10 November 1746. During the rest of the season her parts included Lady Upstart in William Taverner's <span class="italic">The Artful Husband</span> and Gertrude in <span class="italic">Hamlet</span>, and she also replaced the ailing Mrs Cibber in Nicholas Rowe's <span class="italic">Jane Shore</span> at Covent Garden. She is mentioned only once in the Drury Lane bills for 1747&#150;8 but the play was not performed. Chetwood wrote that Mrs Furnival was in England in 1749 but that she would be better remembered in Dublin for her Alicia, Hermione in <span class="italic">The Distrest Mother</span> by Ambrose Philips, Lady Macbeth, and Zara in William Congreve's <span class="italic">The Mourning Bride</span>.<br>
<br>In 1752 Furnival was the leading lady in Smith's troupe at Canterbury and began a relationship with <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15325/', "Roger Kemble (1722&#150;1802)")</script> with &#145;the promise of making an actor of him&#146;. She was billed as Mrs Kemble (or Mrs Campbell), although it is unlikely that the couple ever married, and played a variety of parts as well as singing in <span class="italic">Romeo and Juliet</span> and providing entr'acte songs. Charles Lee Lewes, though writing of events before his career began, considered her &#145;far superior to any of her predecessors, possessing an elegant figure, an uncommon share of beauty, a perfect knowledge of every part she undertook and an execution scarcely excelled by any actress of that day&#146;  (Lewes, 1.87). After the 1751&#150;2 season the pair applied to John Ward at Birmingham but there was no room in the company for Fanny and she joined Quelch's Coventry troupe instead. After apparently rejecting Kemble for another man she disappears from theatrical records.<br>
