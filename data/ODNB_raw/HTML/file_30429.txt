<span class="headword">Arberry,  Arthur John</span>  (1905&#150;1969), <span class="occ">orientalist</span>, was born at 37 Beeston Street, Buckland, Portsmouth, on 12 May 1905, fourth of the five children of William Arberry, signal boatswain in the Royal Navy, and his wife, Sarah Ann Bailey. Arberry won a scholarship to Portsmouth grammar school and in 1924 went up as a scholar to Pembroke College, Cambridge. At school he had shown a talent for mathematics, but he decided to specialize in classics, having, as he wrote, &#145;read everything worth reading in Greek and Latin&#146;. At Cambridge he attended the lectures of A. E. Housman. These lectures, which for Enoch Powell opened the door into the world of scholarship, Arberry found &#145;prodigiously erudite and prodigiously dull&#146;  (Arberry, 234).<br>
<br>As an undergraduate Arberry coincided at Pembroke with the great Islamic scholar E. G. Browne, who died in 1926, and it was Browne's friend, Ellis Minns, who suggested that Arberry, who had just taken a first in both parts of the classical tripos (1925&#150;7), should apply for the newly established Browne studentship in Arabic and Persian. Financed by this and by additional scholarship awards, he took a first in both parts of the oriental languages tripos simultaneously in 1929, and, after two years' work supported by Wright and Goldsmiths' studentships, in 1931 he was elected to a research fellowship at Pembroke. In 1932 he married Sarina Simons (<i>d</i>. 1973) of Braila, Romania, and left Cambridge as he &#145;could not hope to support a wife on the slender dividend of a junior research fellow&#146;  (Arberry, 237). For two years he acted as head of the department of classics at the University of Cairo, where their only daughter was born. On their return to England in 1934 he took the post of assistant librarian at the India Office, where he remained until the outbreak of war in 1939. For most of the war he served in the Ministry of Information, but in 1944 he returned to academic life on being appointed to the chair of Persian at London University. In 1946 he became professor of Arabic and head of the Near and Middle East department, and in 1947 he left London to return to his old college at Cambridge, as Sir Thomas Adams's professor of Arabic, a post which he held for the remainder of his life.<br>
<br>The years that followed were not only the most successful but, probably, the happiest of Arberry's life. He was elected as a professorial fellow of his old college and enjoyed singing in the chapel choir and sharpening his wits among his peers, including Ellis Minns, at high table. He had already obtained the degree of LittD at Cambridge (1936), and in 1949 he was elected a fellow of the British Academy, distinctions to which were later added an honorary DLitt from the Royal University of Malta and the Persian Nishan-i-Danish, first class, in 1964. At the start of his career he had worked in the field of Arabic&#150;Greek translation, but he had been deterred by a hostile review and never returned, even though he later transcribed part of a hitherto unknown manuscript of Aristotle's <span class="italic">Nicomachaean Ethics</span>. He claimed an early enthusiasm for neo-Platonism, which developed into a general interest in mystical philosophy under the guidance of his &#145;beloved master&#146;, R. A. Nicholson, who had perhaps the deepest influence on his career. It was Nicholson's failing eyesight which convinced Arberry that textual edition in Arabic and Persian was a young man's task, and his excellent edition of the <span class="italic">Mawaqif and Mukhatabat</span> of al-Niffari had been published in his early years (1935).<br>
<br>At Cambridge, Arberry was fond of drawing a comparison between the position of Arabic and Persian studies in the West and that of classical studies at the start of the Renaissance, with huge numbers of manuscripts uncatalogued and important texts unedited or at least untranslated. As far as Western scholarship was concerned, the magnitude of the task put it out of the range of the handful of professional academics who were being produced in each generation, and to Arberry the answer lay in a broadening of the appeal of the subject to attract interest and, eventually, recruits. He wrote: &#145;The most abiding lesson taught me by my four years under Brendan Bracken [in the Ministry of Information] was the relevance of publicity, in the broadest sense of the word, to oriental studies&#146;  (Arberry, 239).<br>
<br>Arberry's personal contribution here was to be a series of translations from Persian, Arabic, and, in one case, Maltese. This played to his strength, in that he was a far faster worker than most of his colleagues and, as he would count on finishing what he was writing with a single revision of the original draft, he hoped to produce a book a year. This led to problems. He was criticized by colleagues for his easy choices, where he would pick works that had already been translated, and he left himself no time for extended analysis or the thorough development of ideas. His style as a translator was described as &#145;reminiscent of a large proportion of nineteenth century minor versifying&#146;  (private information) and, in particular, his reworking of &#145;Umar Khayyam was badly received. More importantly, however, the twelve-hour working day that he set himself could not be sustained indefinitely by his constitution, and after the completion of his translation of the <span class="roman">Koran</span> (published in 1955), considered by some as his masterwork, his health gave way. He did not stop working and at times he could show his old quickness, but he felt himself that a spark was missing.<br>
<br>Arberry had always disclaimed any liking for administration, although he threw himself into the work of planning and development which followed the acceptance by parliament in 1947 of the report of the committee on the provision for oriental studies, headed by Lord Scarbrough. Undergraduate teaching was something of a distraction; he refused to lecture on general topics and confined himself to going through set texts. By contrast his reputation attracted record numbers of research students and for those of them who knew him at his best he was an inspiring teacher. His achievements in the oriental faculty included the introduction of modern Arabic into a tripos that had until then been entirely classical, and the setting-up of a post in Turkish. Here his main hopes were centred on the establishment of a Centre for Middle Eastern Studies, which he saw as the extension of his life's work in the fields of Arabic, Persian, and Turkish. This, however, involved him in one of his two major disappointments. He had been put forward as a candidate in a Pembroke mastership election and, although he would have been in no state to act as master, he saw his failure in the election as an act of rejection and he complained that the college was no longer the friendly refuge that it had been. Then his Middle East Centre was not granted established status, which deprived it of an automatic source of funding. This he saw as a denigration of his life's work, and he could not even reflect with satisfaction on his publications. Some months before his death he is reported to have told a colleague: &#145;If I could have my time over again, I would not publish the things that I have done&#146;  (private information).<br>
<br>This sad comment reflects what many of Arberry's friends felt at the time. To set against it, however, it must not be overlooked that his sixty or so books have reached a remarkably wide audience, in Britain, the Middle East, and, more recently, in eastern Europe, where they have done for his subject exactly what he hoped. More generally, he should perhaps be seen not as a modern scholar, but as a Renaissance man&#151;a lover of music, an artist who would enliven meetings by producing lightning sketches of his colleagues, a quick talker who enjoyed suggesting exotic solutions to improbable problems that he had raised, and a man who apparently saw no limits to his powers. He enjoyed paradox, both in language and in behaviour, refusing to read J. R. R. Tolkien, who, he said, had too Celtic an imagination, but describing in matter-of-fact terms the ghosts that he claimed to see. It is this Renaissance man that his friends remembered, with his bushy moustache and eyebrows, thick spectacles, and broad full face lit with a mischievous gleam of humour. No one who met him, even at his lowest point, can have failed to be struck by the fact that this was a remarkable man. Arberry died in Cambridge on 2 October 1969.<br>
