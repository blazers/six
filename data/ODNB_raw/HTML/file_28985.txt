<span class="headword">Weld,  Thomas</span>  (1773&#150;1837), <span class="occ">cardinal</span>, was born in London on 22 January 1773, the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/39555/', "Thomas Weld (1750&#150;1810)")</script> of Lulworth Castle, Dorset, and his wife, Mary Massey Stanley (1753&#150;1830), eldest daughter of Sir John Massey Stanley of Hooton Hall, Cheshire. Weld was educated at home by Father Charles Plowden SJ, and may also have spent a year at the Jesuit academy at Li&egrave;ge. He was a keen amateur artist and musician; a French horn and a flageolet were found in his possession at his death. In the 1790s he served as a sergeant in the Dorset yeomanry. During these years he was also associated with his father in offering hospitality to French clerics and religious communities in exile. On 14 June 1796 he married, at Ugbrooke, Lucy Bridget (<i>d</i>. 1815), second daughter of Thomas Clifford of Tixall. He and his wife spent their early married life at Westbrook House, at Upwey, near Weymouth, where their only child, a daughter named Mary Lucy, was born in 1799.<br>
<br>In 1810, after the death of his father, who had provided liberally for his younger sons and his widow, Weld, as heir, was probably left with a straitened income. He decided to economize by closing Lulworth Castle and living in Clifton, near Bath, for six years. His next years were troubled ones. His financial situation worsened as the agricultural slump of the second decade of the century affected his income. In addition, Weld was drawn into the arguments between Bishop John Milner, an old family friend and political ally of his father, and the other vicars apostolic over the question of concessions to the British government in order to secure Catholic emancipation. Weld had joined the Catholic board organizing the campaign against the remaining disabilities in 1812, but resigned when Milner was expelled from it in 1814. Then, on 1 June 1815, his wife died.<br>
<br>Soon after her death Weld decided to become a priest, but before he could begin his studies several matters needed to be settled. The first was a crisis in the Cistercian monastery of St Susan, which Weld's father had established at Lulworth for emigr&eacute; French monks: a renegade monk had made several serious allegations against the monastery before local magistrates. Secretary of state Lord Sidmouth demanded that Weld close the monastery, but Weld managed to persuade him against any active measures and to induce the monks to return to France voluntarily in 1817. In addition, Weld wished to see his daughter married and his estate settled before following his vocation. Mary's marriage in September 1818 to her second cousin, Hugh Charles Clifford, later seventh Baron Clifford, removed one anxiety, but the settlement of his estate proved complicated: Lulworth was not transferred to his brother Joseph until 1828.<br>
<br>Weld began his studies for the priesthood under Abb&eacute; Carron, taking minor orders in 1820; he was ordained on 7 April 1821. In June 1822 he became assistant priest at the Chelsea mission and at St Mary's, Cadogan Street. He subsequently moved to Hammersmith, where he was spiritual director to a community of Benedictine nuns. In 1826 he was appointed coadjutor to Alexander Macdonell, bishop in Upper Canada, and was consecrated as bishop of Amycla on 6 August. However, legal business, his own frail health, and the sickness of his daughter meant that he never left for Canada. Accompanying his daughter and her family on a trip to Italy, Weld visited Rome; shortly after his arrival there he was made a cardinal by Pius VIII, being admitted to the College of Cardinals on 15 March 1830. Weld's unexpected elevation, which made him the first English cardinal since Philip Thomas Howard (1629&#150;1694), was seen as a gesture of papal goodwill towards England in the wake of the <span class="roman">Catholic Emancipation Act</span>. A Weld family legend less credibly interpreted it as a compliment to George IV: Mrs Fitzherbert, the king's mistress (or wife), was the widow of Weld's uncle. Weld is said to have received assurances from leading figures in England that his elevation was viewed favourably.<br>
<br>Weld's daughter died on 15 May 1831, but her widower and children continued to live with the cardinal, who occupied splendid apartments in the Odescalchi Palace. He was well known for his hospitality, entertaining Roman society as well as his fellow countrymen. Unable to learn Italian, he probably participated little in the management of Vatican business, appointing secretaries and advisers to assist him. But he was held to be influential in English affairs with the pope, and he acted as cardinal protector of the English College in Rome. Weld died on 19 April 1837 in Rome, and, like his daughter, was buried at the church of St Marcellus. His contemporaries were effusive in their praise of his character; Nicholas Wiseman  (389) commented that if he had a fault, it was &#145;the excessiveness of his kindness&#146;.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_28985"></a><span class="headword">Joseph Weld</span>  (1777&#150;1863)<span class="occ"></span>, younger brother of Cardinal Weld, was born on 27 January 1777 at Lulworth Castle. Educated at home, he was sent to Stonyhurst College in November 1794. In November 1802 he married Elizabeth Charlotte Stourton (1782&#150;1864), daughter of Charles Philip, sixteenth Lord Stourton; his father settled the estate of Pylewell, near the Solent, on the couple. Pylewell was situated very conveniently for the pursuit of Weld's yachting interests, and he spent over &pound;3000 on improvements to the property. In 1830 Weld received the family of Charles X, the exiled French king, at Lulworth, when the castle became their temporary refuge.<br>
<br>Yachting was Weld's main occupation: in 1815 he was a founder member of the club which later became the Royal Yacht Club, and he dominated yacht races from 1825 until 1861, winning&#151;according to his own estimate&#151;&pound;3000 in prize money. He was extremely interested in boat design: on one occasion he wrote to the Admiralty offering to build a naval brig to his own design on their approval. The successes of his yachts, particularly the <i>Arrow</i> and the <i>Alarm</i>, witnessed to his considerable expertise. He died at Lulworth Castle on 19 October 1863, survived by three sons and a daughter.<br>
