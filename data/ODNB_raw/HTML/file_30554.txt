<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Balfour <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Campbell]</span>, Lady  Frances</span>  (1858&#150;1931), <span class="occ">suffragist leader and churchwoman</span>, was born at Argyll Lodge, Kensington, London, on 22 February 1858, the fifth daughter and tenth of twelve children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4500/', "George Douglas Campbell, eighth duke of Argyll (1823&#150;1900)")</script>, and his first wife, Lady Elizabeth Georgiana Leveson-Gower (1824&#150;1878), the eldest daughter of the second duke of Sutherland. Lady Frances's youth was spent at the three Campbell residences: Inveraray Castle, the ancestral home in Argyll; Rosneath Castle in Dunbartonshire; and Argyll Lodge in London. Her formal education was provided by an English governess. However, the main method by which she learned throughout her life was by listening to and participating in the conversations, particularly at the dinner table, of her parents, in-laws, and male acquaintances, especially ministers and politicians, whose company and friendship she preferred. Lady Frances had a congenital hip dislocation, which left her with one leg shorter than the other and necessitated her wearing a built-up shoe on her right foot. Restless and energetic, she attributed her hot temper to the bedrest which she was forced to endure throughout her childhood for the pelvic disability from which she suffered all her life.<br>
<br>On 12 May 1879 Lady Frances Campbell married Eustace James Anthony Balfour (1854&#150;1911), youngest brother of Arthur James Balfour, later prime minister. Their five children were reared in their home at 32 Addison Road, Kensington. A fellow of the Royal Institute of British Architects, Eustace was a partner in the London architectural firm of Balfour and Turner Ltd. He also served as surveyor and architect of the duke of Westminster's London estate from 1890 to his retirement in 1910. In addition, he was active in the London Scottish Volunteers, which he commanded, as lieutenant-colonel from 1894 to 1903. In 1903 he was appointed an aide-de-camp to Edward VII. Since Lady Frances destroyed all Eustace's letters to her, it is difficult to discern much about their marriage. Frances's mercurial temperament, Eustace's alcoholism, his extended holidays on the continent away from his family, and his preference for the military life seem to suggest that the marriage was not particularly congenial to him. While Eustace may not have provided her with the intellectual companionship she sought, Lady Frances had great love and affection for her husband; this love and loyalty motivated her support for Eustace in his disputes with his sister Alice Balfour, concerning his excessive drinking, and explain Lady Frances's refusal to accept alcoholism as acceptable grounds for divorce when she sat as a member of the divorce commission. Frances and Eustace were opposites in temperament and interests, and thus were concerned with different spheres of activity. While Eustace turned to the volunteer movement, Lady Frances found intellectual companionship with politicians and clerics, especially her brothers-in-law Arthur and Gerald Balfour, as well as Sir Robert Finlay, Robert H. Story, Archibald Fleming, Alexander Macrae, and A. J. Milne.<br>
<br>With one exception, Frances's relations with the Balfour family were close. Her sister-in-law, Lady Betty Balfour, Gerald's wife, was her closest friend, feminist ally, and literary executor; as such, she edited and preserved Lady Frances's papers. However, relations between Lady Frances and Alice Balfour, the unmarried sister who managed Arthur Balfour's households, were often strained, not least because of their competition for Arthur's favour and approval. Lady Frances had little appreciation of the difficulties which Alice encountered in managing Arthur's very active households, and found Alice tedious and petty, while Alice had difficulty accepting Frances's candour and insensitivity to the feelings of others, especially those in her own family.<br>
<br>Like many of her generation Lady Frances first found opportunities for social service through the &#145;social purity&#146; campaigns. Thus, in 1885 she became president of the Travellers' Aid Society, which provided temporary lodging to protect young country women seeking work in the cities from the snares of white slavery procurers, and she remained president until her death in 1931.<br>
<br>In 1889 Lady Frances began her political work when she joined the campaign to secure the enfranchisement of British women. Indeed, she was one of the highest ranking members of the aristocracy to assume a leadership role in the women's suffrage movement. One of the few women of her class to agitate for votes for women from the 1880s onwards, she became a leader of the constitutional suffragists. Her feminism, like much of the rest of her political philosophy, derived from her personal experiences. In her youth and adolescence she heard the arguments against slavery advanced by members of her family (her mother and grandmother, Harriet, duchess of Sutherland, were ardent abolitionists). As a young woman she was thwarted in her desire to become a nurse and frustrated because she could observe, but not aspire to a seat in, parliament. Thus, as a feminist, Lady Frances espoused equal rights for women and was absolutely convinced that women should be permitted to study and train for careers in all the professions on the same terms as men: she eloquently supported her niece Ruth Balfour's decision to study and practise medicine. But Lady Frances wanted no part in the sex war into which the suffragettes led by the Women's Social and Political Union ventured, and deplored the tactics of the militants. While she did not believe women should be exalted on pedestals, she believed that advocates of women's rights were wrong in viewing men as &#145;enemies&#146; in order to achieve their objective of complete equality for women. Her feminism, as Olive Banks has observed, was &#145;rooted in nineteenth century concepts of freedom and democracy&#146;  (Banks, 12). In a lengthy obituary, the <span class="italic">New York Times</span> (26 February 1931, 28) noted that, &#145;[s]ince the attainment of the vote for women [Lady Frances Balfour] had sought to obtain equality of legislation relating to divorce and other matters involving both sexes, in addition to laboring for the liberty of women in various phases of industry and society&#146;.<br>
<br>Lady Frances was involved in almost every aspect of the suffragists' work. As Norman Maclean, a personal friend, noted, &#145;She had a personal magnetism and a gift of making friends no less remarkable than her courage and her crusading spirit&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>). Her contributions to the suffragist movement included marching, speaking, and writing for the cause. She helped lead the &#145;Mud March&#146; of February 1907 and was a popular speaker, averaging approximately three speeches a week to suffragist meetings from Inverness to Plymouth during 1910&#150;12. Lady Frances was, as Maclean observed, &#145;A mistress of invective, &hellip; [who] wielded the dagger of sarcastic wit with the same zest as her ancestors had wielded the broadsword&#146;.<br>
<br>Lady Frances served on the executive committee of the National Union for Women's Suffrage Society from its inception in 1897 until 1918, when British women over the age of thirty were accorded the vote. In addition, she was president of the London Society for Women's Suffrage, the largest women's suffrage society in Britain, from 1896 to 1919 and an active member of the editorial board of <span class="italic">The Englishwoman</span>, launched in 1909.<br>
<br>However, Lady Frances's most effective work for women was her less publicized personal efforts to influence British politicians and members of parliament on behalf of the &#145;cause&#146;. She was in many ways the real political heir of her father, the eighth duke of Argyll, a whig-Liberal government minister for more than twenty years and a renowned orator. Through marriage her relatives included the Princess Louise, the fourth daughter of Queen Victoria, who married Frances's eldest brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32269/', "John Douglas Sutherland Campbell, later ninth duke of Argyll, and Lord Salisbury")</script>, the prime minister, and uncle of the Balfours. While Lady Frances was constrained to observe parliament from behind the grille in the ladies' gallery, at tea time and in the hallways of parliament she lobbied members on behalf of her special cause. Her vast range of contacts in the Liberal, Conservative, and Unionist parties made her one of the most valuable participants in the suffrage fight. After her father broke with Gladstone in 1881, Lady Frances followed the duke into the ranks of the Liberal Unionists, a move which proved a workable compromise for one married into a staunchly Conservative family.<br>
<br>After the vote had been secured for women, Lady Frances's work for women's rights and equality continued through the National Council of Women. She became a member of the executive committee in 1917 and in 1921 was elevated to the presidency. Following her retirement as president in 1923, she served as one of the organization's vice-presidents until her death in 1931. In recognition of her services to women's rights, Lady Frances was named one of two female members of the royal commission on divorce and matrimonial causes which sat from 1910 to 1912. She was, in addition, the first chairman of the Lyceum Club, and a member of the executive committee of the Women's Municipal Party, which encouraged women of all parties to stand for election to councils. Honorary degrees from the University of Durham (DLitt 1919) and the University of Edinburgh (LLD 1921) provided further recognition of her service and talents.<br>
<br>Keenly interested in the religious establishment, Lady Frances included among her close acquaintances many prominent clerics. Her major religious endeavours were made on behalf of the interests of the Church of Scotland, where she was a staunch defender of tradition. Although she usually rejected and denounced such innovations as closing hymns with three Amens, she supported all church efforts to provide equal opportunities for women. Her work for women's enfranchisement within the church included serving as the only president of the Scottish Churches' League for Woman's Suffrage, an organization which she helped to establish in 1912. From 1893 until 1930 she was one of the few women who regularly attended the annual meeting of the general assembly of the Church of Scotland, becoming a familiar &#145;fixture&#146; in the Throne Gallery. Frail and infirm, she made one of her last trips to the general assembly in May 1929 to see the Church of Scotland reunited.<br>
<br>Lady Frances's most significant work on behalf of her church was undertaken from 1905 to 1909, when she effected the rebuilding of Crown Court Church in London's Covent Garden. Besides serving as the only woman on the rebuilding committee, she personally raised almost all the money to finance the project, and secured as its architect her husband Eustace and as its treasurer her brother Lord George Campbell. Lady Frances succeeded to the presidency of the Crown Court Church's Woman's Guild following the death of her sister, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/48786/', "Lady Victoria Campbell")</script>, in 1910 and served in this capacity until her death.<br>
<br>Lady Frances published numerous articles and letters in British periodicals and the daily press. After her husband's death in 1911 she wrote her first book-length publications, mainly to supplement her limited income. In addition to a two-volume autobiography in 1930, <span class="italic">Ne obliviscaris: Dinna Forget</span> (a reference to the Campbell motto), she wrote five biographies: <span class="italic">Lady Victoria Campbell</span> (1911), <span class="italic">The Life and Letters of the Reverend James MacGregor</span> (1912), <span class="italic">Dr Elsie Inglis</span> (1918), <span class="italic">The Life of George, Fourth Earl of Aberdeen</span> (2 vols., 1923), and <span class="italic">A Memoir of Lord Balfour of Burleigh</span> (1925).<br>
<br>Lady Frances Balfour died at her London home, 32 Addison Road, Kensington, on 25 February 1931 from pneumonia and heart failure. She was buried at Whittingehame, the Balfour family home in East Lothian.<br>
