<span class="headword">Master,  Streynsham</span>  (1681&#150;1724), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, was born on 7 March 1681, at Great Bartholomew Close, Smithfield, London, and baptized on the following day at St Bartholomew-the-Great, West Smithfield, the fourth but only surviving son of James Master (1626/7&#150;1702), of East Langdon, Kent, and his wife, Joyce (1645/6&#150;1719), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27886/', "Sir Christopher Turnor")</script>, baron of the exchequer. Master was originally intended for the law, being admitted on 22 May 1699 to Gray's Inn (where his father had entered in 1648). However, the influence of his brother-in-law <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4262/', "Sir George Byng")</script> (who had married his elder sister, Margaret) led him instead to embark upon a naval career.<br>
<br>With Byng as a patron, Master served on board the <i>Ranelagh</i> as a midshipman, becoming a lieutenant in 1704, and being &#145;much hurt in the leg&#146;  (Laughton, 143) during the capture of Gibraltar in July of that year. When Byng was in command in the Mediterranean, he appointed Master to command the <i>Fame</i> prize on 15 July 1709. On 22 March 1710 Sir John Norris made him captain of the <i>Ludlow Castle</i>, and on 7 December 1712 he was appointed to command the <i>Ormonde</i>. He commanded the <i>Ormonde</i> in July 1715 when it was one of the extra ships commissioned to deal with the Jacobite threat. In 1716&#150;17 he was captain of the <i>Dragon</i> serving under Byng and Norris in the Baltic. On 14 March 1718 he was in command of the <i>Superb</i> again in the Mediterranean, and on 31 July 1718 was in action at the battle of Cape Passaro. In this action he took part in the capture of the Spanish flagship and her admiral, being much lauded as the first captain to achieve that honour.<br>
<br>Master returned to England, and saw no further service. On 10 February 1724 he married Elizabeth (1691&#150;1759), only daughter of Richard Oxenden and Mary, daughter of Henry Oxenden. She was the heir of Brook, Kent. Master died on 22 June 1724 of a fever; he is not to be confused with his kinsman the Indian administrator Sir Streynsham Master, who also died in 1724 (28 April). His will, made the previous day, left Brook to his wife, but ordered other property to be sold in order to pay his seven surviving sisters &pound;1000 apiece. Interestingly, he still possessed a chamber at Gray's Inn, which was also to be sold. He was buried in the parish church of Wingham, Kent.<br>
