<span class="headword">Newlyn school</span>  (<em>act. </em>1882&#150;<em>c.</em>1900), <span class="occ">painters</span>, were based in the fishing village of Newlyn, in west Cornwall. Here they found companionship, a mild climate, and the opportunity to paint <i>en plein air</i>, using local people as models. Their paintings were tonal and silvery, combining accuracy of detail with story-painting always so dear to British hearts. Each year throughout the 1880s and 1890s an important group of paintings exhibited at the Royal Academy came from Newlyn.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_64489"></a><span class="headword">Walter Langley</span>  (1852&#150;1922)<span class="occ"></span> described himself as &#145;the first figure painter to depict incidents in the life of the fisherfolk&#146;  (Fox and Greenacre). He was born into a working-class family in Irving Street, Birmingham, on 8 June 1852, the eighth of the eleven children of William Langley, a tailor, and his wife, Mary Ann, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Robinson. He was educated at Hurst Street Unitarian Mission School, Birmingham, and at the age of thirteen was apprenticed to a lithographic printer. He trained in drawing and industrial design at the Birmingham School of Design and gained a scholarship to study decorative design at the South Kensington Schools, London, but he was increasingly drawn towards painting. On 26 August 1876 he married Clara Perkins (<i>d</i>. 1895).<br>
<br>With financial assistance from a Birmingham businessman Langley moved to Newlyn in 1882. Soon after his arrival he produced some of his finest work, effectively capturing moments of personal crisis experienced by the fishermen's families. At this time he painted almost entirely in watercolour and became a leading exhibitor with the Institute of Painters in Water Colours. In the 1890s he returned to the use of oil colour and produced such major works as <span class="italic">Never Morning Wore to Evening but some Heart did Break</span> (1894; Birmingham Museums and Art Gallery); its title was taken from Tennyson's <span class="italic">In Memoriam</span>, which proved to be one of the most popular of all late Victorian scenes of tragedy. Following the death of Clara in August 1895 Langley married secondly, in 1897, Ethel Pengelly. Langley lived in Newlyn for ten years before moving to nearby Penzance, where he died on 22 March 1922 at 18 Clarence Street.<br>
<br>Edwin Harris (1855&#150;1906), another Birmingham painter, trained with Langley at Birmingham School of Art, where he taught for two years before continuing his studies at the Royal Academy in Antwerp. He spent some months in Newlyn in 1881, and by 1883 was resident there. In contrast to the sombreness of Langley his painting depicts the quiet hours of happiness in the cottagers' lives. He left Newlyn in 1895 and spent the remainder of his life in Birmingham. Fred Hall (1860&#150;1948) went to Newlyn in late 1883 and left in 1898. He was born at Stillington, Yorkshire, where his father was a doctor. He attended Lincoln School of Art and, like Harris, the Royal Academy in Antwerp. His landscape studies are more impressionist than those of his contemporaries in Newlyn, and he also had a gift for caricature.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_67552"></a><span class="headword">Frank Bramley</span>  (1857&#150;1915)<span class="occ"></span> was arguably the most talented and dedicated of the Newlyn painters. He was born at Sibsey, Lincolnshire, on 6 May 1857, the son of Charles Bramley and his wife, Harriet. Like Hall he trained at Lincoln School of Art and the Royal Academy in Antwerp. He went to Newlyn in the winter of 1884. His principal subject was the figure, with a concern for mood and character. Trained in the discipline of northern painting his work tended more towards tonality, less towards colour. One of the finest emotional statements of late nineteenth-century art was his <span class="italic">A Hopeless Dawn</span> (1888; Chantrey Bequest, Tate collection), a scene of tragic loss set in the intimate theatre of Bramley's small room in Newlyn. In 1891 he married Katherine, daughter of John Graham of Huntingstile, Grasmere, Westmorland. In 1893 he was elected associate of the Royal Academy, of which he became academician in 1911. In 1894 he left Newlyn; his final years were spent in Grasmere. He died at Hope House, Chalford Hill, Gloucester, on 10 August 1915.<br>
<br>The arrival of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/33194/', "Stanhope Alexander Forbes (1857&#150;1947)")</script> in Newlyn in January 1884 marked a turning point for the artists' colony. Forbes was to become the leading figure in the group; he possessed a capacity for action and a practical genius that propelled their work upon a national stage. During his first months in the village he painted <span class="italic">Fish Sale on a Newlyn Beach</span> (1885; Plymouth Museum and Art Gallery), which depicts the glistening beach at low tide, a heavy sky over a slate-blue sea. The fishing fleet is anchored offshore and fish are being unloaded and offered for sale on the beach. When the painting was exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1885 it was much admired for its freshness and accuracy of observation. Forbes was the first of the Newlyn painters to be elected to the Royal Academy, as associate in 1892 and as academician in 1910.<br>
<br>Not all who came to Newlyn had the abilities or the ambitions of Langley, Bramley, or Forbes. Ralph Todd (1856&#150;1932) had little success at the Royal Academy but exhibited regularly in Birmingham. A number of other painters were not resident in Newlyn for long periods but came on visits or used it as a sketching-ground. They include William John Wainwright (1855&#150;1931) and Henry Detmold (1854&#150;1924), both from Birmingham; Leghe Suthers (1856&#150;1924) and William Banks Fortescue (<i>c</i>.1855&#150;1914), both from Southport, in Lancashire. William Teulon Blandford Fletcher (1859&#150;1936) was one of the few Londoners in the group.<br>
<br>The Slade School of Fine Art, founded as part of University College, London, attracted some of the most talented of the younger generation, including a number who went to Newlyn. Henry Scott Tuke (1858&#150;1929) made his first extended visit in 1883 but he was mainly associated with his home town of Falmouth. Thomas Cooper Gotch (1854&#150;1931) settled in Newlyn in 1887 and remained there until his death. Percy Robert Craft (1856&#150;1934) arrived in the village in February 1885 and stayed there for about two years, before joining the artists' community in St Ives. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/101045/', "Albert Chevallier Tayler (1862&#150;1925)")</script> went to Newlyn in the late summer of 1884 and was an irregular resident over a period of eleven years. Frank Wright Bourdillon (1851&#150;1924) had a painting career of about twelve years, most of it spent in Newlyn. In June 1892 he gave up painting to become a missionary.<br>
<br>
<script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/40916/', "Norman Garstin (1847&#150;1926)")</script> was born at Cahirconlish, co. Limerick. He was already thirty-one before he began to train in art at the Royal Academy in Antwerp, and in Paris, and went to Newlyn in 1886. His smaller sketches&#151;studies of sea and landscape&#151;captured the transient effects of light, but his most robust painting is undoubtedly <span class="italic">The Rain it Raineth every Day</span> (1889; Penlee Gallery and Museum, Penzance), which depicts the wide, rain-soaked expanse of the promenade between Newlyn and Penzance. Garstin also had talent as a writer; from 1895 he was a regular contributor to the <span class="italic">Studio Magazine</span> with a feature, &#145;Studio talk&#146;, in which the work of the Newlyn and St Ives artists was chronicled.<br>
<br>Elizabeth Adela Armstrong (1859&#150;1912) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/64735/', "Forbes, Elizabeth Adela")</script>] was born in Ottawa and educated in England. She studied at the South Kensington Schools, London, and at the Art Students League, New York. Later, chaperoned by her mother, she travelled to Europe and painted in Germany, France, and the Netherlands. In November 1885 she made her first visit to Newlyn, although she was not a resident there until her marriage, to Stanhope Alexander Forbes. She painted with a delicacy and clarity that few of the Newlyn painters could match and discovered a theme that she made her own&#151;the village children. Her painting <span class="italic">School is out</span> (1888), exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1889, is a sympathetic description of the children as individuals. In that year Forbes had his own success at the same exhibition, with <span class="italic">The Health of the Bride</span>, an equally warm portrayal of a village wedding; the work was purchased by Sir Henry Tate and later formed part of his gift to the nation of sixty-eight pictures that led to the formation of the Tate Gallery.<br>
<br>By the turn of the century Newlyn had changed; the harbour had been enlarged and the fishing trade greatly expanded. This commercial development made it much less interesting to the artists, and many left. Stanhope and Elizabeth Forbes made a decision to stay, and in 1899 opened a school of painting in Newlyn; this marked the beginning of a new era in the artistic life of the village. The school continued until the Second World War, surviving Elizabeth Forbes's death in 1912 and Stanhope Forbes's subsequent marriage, in 1915, to Maudie Palmer.<br>
