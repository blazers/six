<span class="headword">Lucas,  Keith</span>  (1879&#150;1916), <span class="occ">physiologist and instrument designer</span>, was born at Greenwich on 8 March 1879, the second son of Francis Robert Lucas (<i>d</i>. 1931), managing director of the Telegraph Construction and Maintenance Company of Greenwich, and inventor of improvements in submarine cables and cable laying, and his wife, Katharine Mary; she was the daughter of John Riddle, headmaster of Greenwich Hospital schools, and the granddaughter of Edward Riddle, both of whom were fellows of the Royal Astronomical Society and well known in nautical astronomy. Educated at the Revd T. Oldham's preparatory school, Blackheath, London, and at Rugby, where he was head of School House, Lucas proceeded, with a scholarship in classics, to Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1898. Abandoning classics, he gained a first class in the first part of the natural science tripos in 1901, but deferred the second part of the tripos until 1904, to make an extended visit to New Zealand. He was elected a fellow of Trinity College in 1904, and became college lecturer in natural science in 1906. Lucas married Alys, daughter of the Revd Cyril Egerton Hubbard, in 1909, living initially on the Huntingdon Road, Cambridge, before moving to Fen Ditton. They had three sons, Alan (<i>b</i>. 1910), <a href="#cosubject_66003">David [<i>see below</i>]</a>, and <a href="#cosubject_63979">Bryan [<i>see below</i>]</a>.<br>
<br>Between the years 1904 and 1914 Lucas undertook a series of studies, publishing some twenty-five papers in the <span class="italic">Journal of Physiology</span>, several in conjunction with students including A. V. Hill and E. Adrian; the results of these studies gave a fresh impetus to the study of muscle and nerve. His physiological research work was almost entirely on the physico-chemical properties of nerves and muscles. Among other discoveries, he showed that the &#145;all-or-none&#146; law, that a given stimulus evokes either the maximum contraction or no contraction at all, applied to skeletal muscle. This was a fundamental principle, which his pupil Adrian later proved to be applicable to motor nerve fibres. Lucas also determined the temperature coefficient of nerve conduction, and examined in detail the nature of the nervous impulse and its propagation, work summarized in his posthumous <span class="italic">Conduction of the Nervous Impulse</span> (1917), prepared for publication by Adrian. In the course of this work, besides formulating fundamental questions and answering them, Lucas devised instruments of remarkable ingenuity, elegance, and precision. By 1914 he was recognized as a leader in this field of science. He took his DSc in 1911, and was elected FRS in 1913, having given the Croonian lectures the preceding year.<br>
<br>Lucas had a significant advantage in his physiological researches: he had the ability to design and build very sensitive instrumentation. His designs were so remarkable that they were manufactured and marketed by the Cambridge Scientific Instrument Company, and Horace Darwin, chairman of the company, made Lucas a director in 1906. Both Lucas and Darwin followed Clerk-Maxwell's principles of geometric design in all instrument design&#151;for example, that accuracy should not deteriorate with wear.<br>
<br>In 1914, following the outbreak of war, Lucas was encouraged by Darwin, as a member of the Aeronautical Research Committee, to join the growing group of scientists being mobilized by Mervyn O'Gorman at the Royal Aircraft Factory, Farnborough. Puzzled on his first day by a Royal Flying Corps report from the western front that their aircraft compasses were useless, he started a series of ground and flight tests to examine the problems for himself. His experiments showed that severe compass error could be caused by engine vibration irrespective of the heading of the aircraft, and a more subtle heading error caused by the vertical component of the earth's magnetic field when the aircraft turned off a northerly course. This second error, of which even the Admiralty was unaware and which Lucas termed &#145;northerly turning error&#146;, explained why pilots were finding it impossible to navigate through cloud using their compass, the only aid they had at that time.<br>
<br>Lucas established new design features, which were incorporated into future aircraft compasses, including Darwin's suggestion to reverse the cup and pivot to eliminate vibration error. Turning next to bomb aiming, it was quickly obvious to him that the accuracy of any simple aiming device was affected by the aircraft's natural oscillations. He designed a photo-kymograph, using the sun as both reference and light source to measure accurately aircraft oscillations, conducting all his own flight experiments, usually piloted by R. H. Mayo; and he built the first gyroscopic aiming device. Convinced that his experimental work would benefit if he became a pilot, he attended a flying course at Upavon, where he was tragically killed in a mid-air collision on 5 October 1916.<br>
<br>Lucas was buried in the Aldershot military cemetery. After his death his wife Alys changed the family name, and, as Alys Keith-Lucas, edited a short book giving his background together with reminiscences of him and a list of his publications  (<span class="italic">Keith Lucas</span>, 1934). Following his death, Lucas's pioneering work on cloud flying and bomb aiming was continued and advanced over the next two years by F. A. Lindemann, while his photo-kymograph continued in use at Farnborough for many years.<br>
<br>Lucas's second son, <a name="cosubject_66003"></a><span class="headword">David  Keith-Lucas</span>  (1911&#150;1997), <span class="occ">aeronautical engineer</span>, was born on 25 March 1911 at Cambridge; he and his brothers adopted the surname Keith-Lucas as a memorial to their dead father. Educated at Gresham's School, Holt, from 1924 to 1929, he read engineering at Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, overlapping in his final year with an apprenticeship at Metropolitan-Vickers, which he continued at C. A. Parsons &amp; Co. In 1940 he joined Short Bros. at Rochester, where he soon rose to be chief aerodynamicist. He married in 1942 Dorothy De Bauduy Robertson (<i>d</i>. 1979); they had two sons and a daughter. After the war he accompanied Shorts to Belfast, holding successively the posts of chief designer, technical director, and research director, contributing to the design of various swept-wing and vertical take-off planes. In 1965 he was appointed professor of aircraft design in the College of Aeronautics, Cranfield (later the Cranfield Institute of Technology); in 1972 he became professor of aeronautics. He served on numerous boards and committees, notably the Roskill commission for the third London airport; he was president of the Royal Aeronautical Society in 1968 and was awarded its gold medal in 1975. In 1979, visiting the site of the world's first powered flight at Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, the Keith-Lucases were involved in a serious motor accident, which resulted in his wife's death. In 1981 he married Phyllis Marion Everard, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Whurr, whom he had known earlier at Short Bros. He died on 6 April 1997, survived by his second wife and the three children of his first marriage.<br>
<br>Lucas's third son, <a name="cosubject_63979"></a><span class="headword">Bryan  Keith-Lucas</span>  (1912&#150;1996), <span class="occ">political scientist</span>, was born on 1 August 1912 at Fen Ditton, Cambridgeshire, and was educated at Gresham's School from 1924 to 1930. He read history and economics at Pembroke College, Cambridge, then joined the town clerk's department at Kensington, west London, qualifying as a solicitor in 1937. During the Second World War he served in north Africa, Italy, and Cyprus with the Buffs and Sherwood Foresters, ending the war as a major. He then returned to local government in Nottingham. His marriage in 1946 to Mary Hardwicke brought a son and two daughters. In 1948 he moved into academic life, being appointed senior lecturer in local government at Oxford University. He was elected a fellow of Nuffield College in 1950 and domestic bursar in 1957. He served as an Oxford city councillor for the Liberal Party, sat on several governmental committees, and advised on aspects of local government for Britain's former colonies, including Sierra Leone (1954), Mauritius (1955&#150;6), Nigeria (1963), and Fiji (1975). In 1965 he was appointed professor of government in the new University of Kent, and from 1970 to 1974 he was master of Darwin College, where he and his wife played host to numerous undergraduates and visiting academics. After retirement in 1977 he taught politics part-time at King's School, Canterbury. In 1983 he was appointed CBE. Among his publications were <span class="italic">The English local government franchise</span> (1952), <span class="italic">The mayor, aldermen and councillors</span> (1961), which anticipated the much later introduction of democratically elected mayors, and (with P. G. Richards) <span class="italic">A history of local government in the 20th century</span> (1978). In 1970 he produced a second edition of Josef Redlich's and Francis Wrigley Hirst's <span class="italic">History of local government in England</span>. His wife was also a Liberal Party supporter; she served as a Canterbury councillor and as sheriff. He died at Canterbury on 7 November 1996, survived by his wife and their three children.<br>
