<span class="headword">Shelley,  George</span>  (<em>c.</em>1666&#150;<em>c.</em>1736), <span class="occ">writing-master</span>, appears to have been born in London. Nothing is known of his early life or parentage except that his poverty is suggested by his education at Christ's Hospital, a charitable institution which primarily took care of London orphans. From these humble beginnings Shelley rose to become one of the pre-eminent and most prolific penmen of his day; indeed, he was described, posthumously, as a &#145;shining figure in the common-weal of English calligraphy&#146;  (Massey, 2.131).<br>
<br>By 1708 Shelley was living at the Hand and Pen in Warwick Lane where he kept a school. Prior to that he worked as a private tutor teaching penmanship to the children of the gentility. This is evident from <span class="italic">The Penman's Magazine</span> (1705), his first published copybook, which was dedicated to his former pupils Ann and Dorothy Sharpe, the daughters of the archbishop of Canterbury. From the outset of his publishing career Shelley's preference for the most decorative genres of penmanship is clear. He was an expert flourisher, writing texts in a variety of hands which were then ornamented with patterns and fantastic figures executed with one continuous stroke of the pen. He could also show more restraint when producing utilitarian texts in &#145;round hand&#146;, the writing style best suited to business transactions. Examples of his more practical penmanship can be found in <span class="italic">Natural Writing</span> (1709?) where the trading links were made clear in Shelley's artful and, most probably, uninvited dedication to the directors of the Bank of England. In the preface to this work Shelley went to great lengths to augment his reputation by insisting on the high regard in which he was held by other writing-masters. A certain vanity can also be detected, for instead of praising the engraver George Bickham, as writing-masters usually did, Shelley tried to deter any critics by complaining that &#145;his Imitation falls short of my originals&#146;  (Shelley, preface). His motivation for such unusually self-regarding assertions was probably linked to his application, in the same year, for the prestigious position of writing-master to Christ's Hospital; a fiercely contested post, which Shelley succeeded in winning over eight rival penmen. His sense of competition can also be discerned from the lengthy and public battle which, along with Charles Snell, he waged against the writing-master John Clark. The subject of this debate was the comparative merits of &#145;sprigging&#146;&#151;the more artistic aspect of penmanship&#151;and clear hands designed for the advancement of trade. Rather ironically, although Shelley was considered a master of round hand, he was also a virtuoso of the flourish and consequently he preferred to promote this less accessible aspect of his penmanship.<br>
<br>After selling up his Warwick Lane academy to John Clark, Shelley established himself at Christ's Hospital and his next published copybook, <span class="italic">Alphabets in All the Hands</span> (1710), sold for the benefit of the &#145;orphans of Christ's Hospital&#146;, reflects his pride in his new position. Throughout the remainder of Shelley's career he continued to publish various copybooks, some of which were more biased towards the ornamental hands and decorative texts than others. Despite his many published copybooks, Shelley appears to have led a somewhat dissolute life. In 1725 he was deeply in debt and he was forced to petition the court of Christ's Hospital to advance him &pound;166 to pay his creditors. Matters obviously did not improve as, in 1726, a meeting of the Hospital's committee reported finding that Shelley had absented himself for days and sometimes weeks. Although he pleaded fear of persecution on account of his debts, the Hospital decided that they had been generous enough. Shelley was immediately discharged from his post at Christ's Hospital and was succeeded by Benjamin Durnford. Nothing is known of Shelley's last ten years but William Massey assumed that he died in &#145;low circumstances&#146; about 1736.<br>
