<span class="headword">Dyson,  Humfrey</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1633), <span class="occ">book collector</span>, was probably the son of Christopher Dyson (<i>d</i>. 1609), wax chandler of the parish of St Alban, Wood Street, London, and his wife, Mary. He was practising as a notary public by 1609, when he witnessed Christopher's will, and continued to do so until shortly before his death, drawing up wills and other documents. He was a citizen of London, as a member of the Wax Chandlers' Company, from 1603, and married Elizabeth, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26098/', "Thomas Speght (d. 1621)")</script>, the editor of Geoffrey Chaucer and John Lydgate.<br>
<br>Dyson is notable chiefly for the enormous library he amassed. No catalogue of the library is known, apart from six notebooks (All Souls College, Oxford, MS 117) listing in order of date of publication those books &#145;touching as well the State Ecclesiasticall as Temporall of the Realme of England&#146;: in 1631 these alone totalled nearly 1100. He also owned a large number of works of Elizabethan and Jacobean literature; in some instances his is now the unique surviving copy. Nearly all the extant printed proclamations of Queen Elizabeth I's reign belong to the seven sets, each of which he collected together, bound, and provided with its own specially printed title-page (1618). Dyson printed nothing else, but he collaborated in the 1633 revision of John Stow's <span class="italic">Survey of London</span>&#151;an edition that included many copies of acts of parliament and of the common council of London.<br>
<br>Dyson died between 7 January 1633, when he made his will, as a parishioner of St Olave Jewry, London, and 28 February 1633, when it was proved. In it he made monetary bequests to his four daughters and two sons, allowed the use of his professional papers to his apprentices, and gave a two-volume book of statutes to &#145;my noble friend Sir William Paddy &hellip; to be by him put and given to the library of St John's College in Oxford&#146;. He directed simply that his other books be sold by William Jumper; a great many of them were acquired by Richard Smith (<i>d</i>. 1675) and were dispersed when his library was sold in 1682. Thomas Baker wrote: &#145;There are Books (chiefly in old English) almost in every Library that have belong'd to H. Dyson, with his Name upon them&#146;  (Hearne, 7.369).<br>
