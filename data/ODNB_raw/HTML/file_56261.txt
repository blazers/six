<span class="headword">McLaren <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>M&uuml;ller]</span>,  Eva Maria</span>  (1852/3&#150;1921), <span class="occ">social reformer and political activist</span>, was the younger daughter of William M&uuml;ller, a wealthy German businessman, and an English mother, Maria Henrietta. She spent her early life in Valpara&iacute;so, Chile, and was educated by a governess and at school in London. The family travelled widely, eventually settling in Hertfordshire, with a London residence in Portland Place. She was much influenced by her mother's interest in progressive issues and by her elder sister, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/56279/', "Henrietta M&#252;ller")</script>, founding editor of the <span class="italic">Women's Penny Paper</span> and <span class="italic">Woman's Herald</span>, who was elected to the London school board in 1879. Both sisters led unusually active lives, unshackled by Victorian convention and no doubt helped greatly by their personal wealth; as young women they mountaineered in the Swiss Alps and continued to travel in later years, for example, to India and the United States. Drawn initially to organized philanthropy, at the age of twenty Eva M&uuml;ller worked with Octavia Hill in Marylebone, where her duties were to collect rents and to look after the welfare of tenants. She subsequently accepted a nurse training post at Brownlow Hill workhouse infirmary in Liverpool, but returned to London to take care of her ailing father.<br>
<br>Eva's marriage to <a name="cosubject_61721"></a><span class="headword">Walter Stowe Bright McLaren</span>  (1853&#150;1912)<span class="occ"></span> on 18 April 1883 introduced her to the politically influential Bright&#150;McLaren family, with its extensive connections to the Liberal Party and the Victorian women's movement. Walter was born in Edinburgh, the youngest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17640/', "Duncan McLaren (1800&#150;1886)")</script>, lord provost of Scotland and MP for Edinburgh, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/47643/', "Priscilla Bright McLaren (1815&#150;1906)")</script>, president of the Edinburgh National Society for Women's Suffrage and sister to John and Jacob Bright. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/34776/', "Charles Benjamin Bright McLaren")</script> was his brother, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/34778/', "John McLaren")</script> his half-brother. After an education at Craigmount School and Edinburgh University, Walter entered into business as a worsted spinner in the firm of Smith and McLaren in Keighley, and in later years became a director of numerous companies. However, his heart lay in politics, and he was subsequently elected Liberal MP for Crewe (1886&#150;95).<br>
<br>Eva and Walter were remarkably close in political outlook and aspirations, and devoted much of their married life to the attainment of women's rights. Greatly influenced by his maternal relations, Walter had written a pamphlet on women's suffrage in 1874 and was instrumental in attempting to make it part of the Liberal Party's policy on electoral reform as early as 1883. He and Eva joined the executive committee of the Manchester Society for Women's Suffrage while living in Bradford, serving from 1884 to 1895. When his parliamentary career took them to London they became increasingly involved with the central committee of the National Society for Women's Suffrage, of which Eva was already a member, with her sister, Henrietta. Walter served as joint secretary of the all-party committee of the Parliamentary Supporters of the Women's Franchise Bill, which Helen Blackburn called &#145;an authoritative nucleus of action&#146;  (Blackburn, 173). Although keenly aware of the legal disabilities of married women, they shared the view of the central committee that any successful women's suffrage bill, even a restricted measure which enfranchised only widows and spinsters, would be better than none. This was a fiercely contested issue within the suffrage movement, which split the Bright family into two camps. On the equally divisive matter of affiliation of political associations, they were instrumental in pressing for change: Walter chaired the special general meeting of the central committee in 1888 which led to the formation of the Central National Society for Women's Suffrage on whose executive committee he and Eva served for a number of years. In the same period Eva became a leading member of the Women's Liberal Federation: she was its first honorary treasurer (1887&#150;1914), honorary secretary of the Welsh Union of Women's Liberal Associations from 1894, and inaugurated several Women's Liberal Associations (WLAs), serving as president of Southport WLA and as vice-president of Crewe WLA in the 1890s. A member of the progressive faction during the split over suffrage in 1891, Eva believed that the federation's first aim should be to achieve electoral rights for women, and supported the implementation of the test question policy which obliged parliamentary candidates to declare themselves in favour of women's suffrage before they could obtain the crucial electoral assistance of constituency WLAs. She was active in a series of suffrage pressure groups within the WLA: the Union of Practical Suffragists, the Forward Suffrage Union, and the Liberal Women's Suffrage Union. She was author of <span class="italic">The History of the Women's Suffrage Movement in the Women's Liberal Federation</span> (1903).<br>
<br>Both McLarens were active members of the movement to extend women's rights in local government. Eva had been elected to the Lambeth board of guardians about 1882, and after her marriage served as poor-law guardian for the Horton district of Bradford; she continued to work for improvements in the poor law and for better conditions in workhouses. They campaigned for Lady Sandhurst and Jane Cobden in their attempt to become the first women elected to the new London county council in 1889. In the same year Eva became treasurer of the Society for Promoting the Return of Women as County Councillors, while Walter took a leading part in the affairs of its successor, the Women's Local Government Society. He introduced a successful clause into the 1894 <span class="roman">Local Government Act</span> to the effect that a woman should not be disqualified by marriage from being on the local government register of electors, provided that husband and wife were not qualified in respect of the same property. This was to be a significant landmark in improving the rights of married women. The McLaren marriage was clearly an egalitarian one&#151;insofar as the law would allow&#151;and both disliked the remnants of coverture which were still the hallmarks of a wife's legal subordination. A keen feminist, Eva rejected the conventional title of Mrs Walter McLaren and was known throughout her political career as Mrs Eva McLaren, on the grounds that &#145;it is more important to know who a woman is than whose wife she is&#146;  (<span class="italic">Women's Penny Paper</span>, 1 June 1899). They were attracted to the advanced views of Edward Carpenter on the simplification of life and were drawn to many of the social reform issues of the day. They worked with Josephine Butler in the campaign for the repeal of the <span class="roman">Contagious Diseases Acts</span>, Eva serving as secretary and then chair of the London branch of the Ladies' National Association (LNA). This led to an interest in the lives of Indian women&#151;child marriage and the effects of the <span class="roman">Contagious Diseases Acts</span> were of growing concern to a number of feminists in Britain&#151;and in 1888 Eva co-sponsored the studies of an Indian woman student at the London school of medicine, while Walter worked with other MPs to rescind the acts governing the state regulation of prostitution in India in 1888. Members of a peace society in London in the late 1880s, they advocated the concept of a court of arbitration to settle international disputes. They attended, as delegates of the LNA and central committee of the National Society for Women's Suffrage, a French government Congress on the Civil Rights of Women in 1889, and Eva subsequently published a pamphlet on this subject in 1891. Typical of many of the Liberal suffragists of the time, she also became involved in the temperance movement. Walter was the nephew of Margaret Bright Lucas, founder of the British Women's Temperance Association (BWTA), in which Eva came to national prominence as vice-president (1894&#150;1900). She fully supported Lady Henry Somerset's successful, albeit divisive, attempt to steer the BWTA away from a narrow crusade against drink and towards a broad platform of social reform, and served as superintendent of the Department of Work Among Municipal Women Voters.<br>
<br>During his first spell in the Commons from 1886 to 1895 Walter had immersed himself in legislation which chiefly affected women. In addition to suffrage and local government he had spoken favourably on the appointment of police matrons, opposed the sex discrimination implicit in the <span class="roman">Deceased Wife's Sister Bill</span>, and drafted an unsuccessful amendment to defeat the <span class="roman">Shop Hours Bill</span> of 1892 on the grounds of equality. In practice he became an unofficial whip on behalf of the late Victorian women's movement, and his removal from parliament after the general election of 1895 was a serious loss, although he remained active in a number of organizations, including the Men's League for Women's Suffrage, serving as a member of the executive committee and as a vice-president after 1907, and the Women's Local Government Society. His re-election in 1910 for Crewe Division brought renewed activity, cut short by his death from heart failure on 29 June 1912. An enormously popular MP, he had worked particularly for those interests which reflected the industrial nature of his constituency. A firm believer in conciliation in industrial disputes, he had taken a prominent part in the Miners' Conciliation Board and had helped to bring in the <span class="roman">Minimum Wage Act</span>. His support for the coalowners during the south Wales miners' strike, however, caused him to lose favour. Eva retired from the national spotlight, although she continued to represent the Home Counties Union on the Women's Liberal Federation executive committee in 1913&#150;14. When war broke out she took the courageous step of resuming her belated nursing career, and worked at a base hospital in France during the winter of 1914&#150;15. She subsequently experienced a severe breakdown in health, and died from chronic Bright's disease and uraemia on 16 August 1921 at Great Comp Cottage, Borough Green, Kent, survived by her adopted daughter, Mary Florence Campbell McLaren.<br>
