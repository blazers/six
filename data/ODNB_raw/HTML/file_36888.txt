<span class="headword">Wiggins,  Joseph</span>  (1832&#150;1905), <span class="occ">Arctic explorer and merchant navy officer</span>, born at Norwich on 3 September 1832, was the son of Joseph Wiggins (<i>d</i>. 1843) and his wife, Anne Petty (<i>d</i>. 1847). The father, a driver and later proprietor of coaches serving the London&#150;Norwich road, set up in 1838&#150;9 at Bury St Edmunds as innkeeper and coach proprietor but suffered from railway competition. At his death his widow, left with small means, returned with her six sons and three daughters to Norwich, where Joseph was sent to Farnell's School. At the age of fourteen he was apprenticed to his uncle, Joseph Potts, a Sunderland shipowner. He rose rapidly, being master of a ship at twenty-one and subsequently owning cargo vessels. In 1868 he married Annie Potts (<i>d</i>. 1904), daughter of his former master, and also became a Board of Trade examiner in navigation and seamanship at Sunderland.<br>
<br>Wiggins became interested in the possibility of establishing a trade route between western Europe and Siberia, by way of the Arctic seas and the rivers which drain into them. The overland route by sledge and caravan was slow, erratic, and expensive, but the sea route was held to be impracticable owing to ice and fog. He argued that a branch of the warm Atlantic drift ought for part of the year to open up the western entrances to the Kara Sea and (in conjunction with the outflow of the great rivers) a route through the sea itself. He chartered and fitted at his own expense a steamer of 103 tons and sailed from Dundee on 3 June 1874; but after reaching the mouth of the Ob, he was compelled to return owing to lack of provisions, expense, and the attitude of his crew. He reached Dundee on 25 September. Although his route was already used by Norwegian fishermen and had been followed by Russian traders as early as the sixteenth century, his voyage called attention to the possibility of establishing a new commercial route with large vessels. He expounded his results in lectures which won him wide fame and thenceforth occupied him when on shore.<br>
<br>In 1875, with private financial support, Wiggins fitted out a sloop of 27 tons and reached Vard&ouml; on 27 July, where he met the Russian admiral, Glassenov, and others interested in his work. He accompanied Glassenov (who promised to use his influence with the Russian government and merchants) to Archangel, where he obtained maps, rejoined his sloop, and worked her nearly to Kolguyev Island, but thence turned back, the season being spent. Private British and Russian money financed his third Siberian journey, in a steamer of 120 tons carrying an auxiliary launch. He sailed in July 1876, inspected the Kara River late in August, and by 26 September, having found the Ob inaccessible owing to winds and current, was in the estuary of the Yenisey. On 18 October his ship reached the Kureyka (a right-bank tributary of the Yenisey, which it joins close to the Arctic circle), and was there laid up for the winter. The next year he started for Siberia accompanied by Henry Seebohm the ornithologist, but his ship was wrecked shortly after reaching the Kureyka. In 1878 O. J. Cattley, a merchant in St Petersburg, sent Wiggins in command of a trading steamer to the Ob, whence a cargo of produce was successfully brought back. Other vessels performed the same feat; but in 1879&#150;80 the failure of some British and Russian trading expeditions, with which Wiggins declined to be connected (owing to the unsuitability of the vessels), checked public confidence in his schemes, and from 1880 to 1887 he acted as master mariner in other seas.<br>
<br>In 1887&#150;8 the Phoenix company sent Wiggins in the 273 ton <i>Phoenix</i> up the Yenisey River to Yeniseysk, far above what was supposed to be the head of navigation for so large a ship. He left his brother Robert, who was his chief officer, on the river as agent. Another ship followed in 1888, but this voyage and the company failed. In 1892 Wiggins was the only one of the polar explorers of the Royal Geographical Society to have confidence in Nansen's plan to explore the Arctic in the <i>Fram</i>.<br>
<br>In 1893 Wiggins, by arrangement with the Russian government, took command of the <i>Orestes</i>, a larger vessel than any which had hitherto reached the mouth of the Yenisey, and safely delivered a cargo of rails for the Trans-Siberian Railway. For this voyage he was rewarded by the Russian government. The next year, after convoying two Russian steamers to the Yenisey, he was shipwrecked near Yugor Strait and, with his companions, made a difficult land journey home, when the Royal Geographical Society awarded him the Murchison medal. In 1895 he made his last voyage to the Yenisey, and in 1896 he failed to get beyond Vard&ouml;, which involved him in some undeserved censure. From 1897 to 1903 he sailed elsewhere.<br>
<br>In 1905 the Russo-Japanese War brought famine to Siberia. The Russian government planned a large relief expedition by sea. Wiggins took as active a part in the organization of the expedition as failing health permitted, but when the ships sailed he was too ill to accompany them. He died childless at his home, Rossett View, Rossett Drive, Pannal, Harrogate, Yorkshire, on 13 September 1905, and was buried at Bishopwearmouth.<br>
