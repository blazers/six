<span class="headword">Kerseboom,  Frederick</span>  (1632&#150;1693), <span class="occ">painter</span>, was born in Solingen in Germany. His family name was Casaubon according to Samuel Pepys, who described him in a letter of 30 August 1689 to John Evelyn as &#145;one of much less name than Kneller's, and a stranger&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters and the Second Diary</span>, 204&#150;5). Kerseboom trained in Amsterdam before studying with Charles le Brun in Paris in the 1650s. He then spent fourteen years in Rome, two of them in Poussin's studio.<br>
<br>In the 1680s Kerseboom moved to London with his nephew <a href="#cosubject_65405">Johann Kerseboom [<i>see below</i>]</a>. There he executed a few Poussin-influenced history paintings, which are now known only from engravings. According to George Vertue, Kerseboom turned to portrait painting out of economic necessity  (Vertue, <span class="italic">Note books</span>, 5.50). Few of his portraits have been identified. In <span class="italic">Theophilus Leigh</span> (signed and dated 1685; Trustees of Stoneleigh Abbey Ltd, Warwickshire) Kerseboom presented his sitter with a somewhat rigid dignity, but his pendant portrait <span class="italic">The Hon. Mary Leigh</span> demonstrates that the painter could depict a female sitter with elegance, and that he was familiar with the fashionable style of Willem Wissing in ladies' portraiture. Kerseboom also produced a half-length self-portrait and worked on glass  (according to Buckeridge, 361&#150;2). Frederick Kerseboom died in London and was buried in London at St Andrew's Church, Holborn, on 30 March 1693.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_65405"></a><span class="headword">Johann <span class="st"> [John]</span> Kerseboom</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1708), <span class="occ">painter</span>, initially worked in Germany before coming to England in the 1680s with his uncle. Johann's early portrait of <span class="italic">Lady Grace Carteret</span> (Petworth House, Sussex) was engraved by John Smith. His portrait of the <span class="italic">Electress Sophia Dorothea</span> is known from an engraving by William Faithorne (impression, BM), who also executed six mezzotints after Johann Kerseboom's works.<br>
<br>While Johann Kerseboom's early works reveal the influence of Wissing, he developed his own stylistic idiosyncrasies, including a tendency to elongate the faces of his sitters. He is best-known for his portrait <span class="italic">Robert Boyle</span>, which became the standard image of the scientist. Several versions exist in the Royal Collection, at the Royal Society, the National Portrait Gallery, and elsewhere, and the portrait was engraved by, among others, John Smith in 1689.<br>
<br>Johann Kerseboom sometimes collaborated with his friend the Dutch painter&#150;engraver Jan Vander Vaart, as in the portrait <span class="italic">Gilbert, Fourth Earl of Coventry</span> (Antony, Cornwall). Dated 1704, it was signed by Kerseboom and Vander Vaart. The friends may also have worked together on the full-length portrait <span class="italic">Thomas Osborne, First Duke of Leeds</span> (1704; NPG). Johann Kerseboom died in London, where he was buried on 26 October 1708. In his will, dated 20 March 1694, Kerseboom stated:<blockquote>I stand indebted and doe owe unto my very loveing Friend John Vander Vaart of the parish of St. Paul Covent Garden in the county of Middlesex Painter a considerable sume of money which I am not at present able to pay &hellip; Therefore in Satisfaction I give and bequeath unto the said John Vander Vaart All my Estate.</blockquote>One of his witnesses was the limner Bernard Lens.<br>
