<span class="headword">Shackleton,  Abraham</span>  (1752&#150;1818), <span class="occ">schoolmaster and theologian</span>, was born on 8 December 1752 at Ballitore, co. Kildare, the eldest son of the four children of the Quaker <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25187/', "Richard Shackleton (1726&#150;1792)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25185/', "Shackleton, Abraham (1696&#150;1771)")</script>], master of Ballitore School, and his first wife, Elizabeth Fuller (1726&#150;1754), who died when Abraham was two years old. He was brought up by his stepmother, Elizabeth Carleton (1726&#150;1804) of Dublin, who married his father in 1755; they had four further children, including the writer <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16232/', "Mary Leadbeater (1758&#150;1826)")</script>, chronicler of Ballitore village.<br>
<br>Shackleton's home, Ballitore (population <i>c</i>.400), was a Quaker settlement unique in Europe. Founded in the late seventeenth century and situated in a fertile valley 40 miles south of Dublin, it was a prosperous rural community with its meeting-house (1709), gardens, and orchards. The Shackletons were leading members of the community, being farmers, millers, and owners of the famous school founded in 1726 by Abraham's Yorkshire-born grandfather <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25185/', "Abraham Shackleton (1696&#150;1771)")</script>, which offered a liberal education to boy boarders from all religious backgrounds; it included among its alumni the statesman Edmund Burke, the United Irishman James Napper Tandy, and in the nineteenth century Cardinal Paul Cullen. Shackleton's father, Richard, a classical scholar, poet, and letter-writer, was a lifelong friend of Burke and an occasional associate of his circle in London; his stepmother, Elizabeth, the school matron, was an adventurous gardener who corresponded with the Quaker plant collector John Fothergill.<br>
<br>Shackleton entered Ballitore School in 1756. He too was a classical scholar and also a keen naturalist and amateur astronomer. He became a teacher and succeeded his father as master in 1779. On 23 February of the same year he married Lydia Mellor (1749&#150;1829), an English schoolmaster's daughter from Edenderry, King's county, with whom he had nine children. He was an outspoken, deeply caring man but also a romantic; he rebuilt the family bolting mill as a castle in 1791 and kept a camel next door in the yard of his home, Griesebank.<br>
<br>Shackleton was a passionate anti-slavery campaigner and pacifist, and he gave up the use of tea, sugar, and all other produce of slave labour in his personal effort to promote the cause of abolition. During the Irish rising of 1798, when Ballitore was occupied by rebel forces, he refused at gunpoint, as a pacifist, to join them, and instead made his house a refuge for the injured of both sides. When the army regained control he negotiated for leniency on behalf of the rebels. His abhorrence of war led him in 1786 to stop teaching certain Latin authors in his school even though this meant a drop in pupil numbers (Latin was then a requirement for university entrance) and eventually the school was forced to close down temporarily in 1801. As his fellow liberal John Hancock wrote, &#145;to be in extremes was the error of this worthy man&#146;  (Hancock, 1). Thereafter he was a successful miller and a farmer given to agricultural improvement.<br>
<br>For many years Shackleton was an esteemed and active Quaker and he was still young when appointed an elder. However, he developed rationalist opinions about the <span class="roman">Bible</span> and matters of faith, similar to other Enlightenment thinkers. While admiring the poetical parts of the <span class="roman">Old Testament</span> he rejected many of its historical sections, especially that concerning the Canaanite wars. He similarly cherished the sublime morality taught by Christ but rejected the doctrine of the Trinity, expressing his views vigorously both in speech and in writing. He became identified with the New Lights, a group of liberal Quakers in Ulster who were in open rebellion against the Quaker discipline, particularly the marriage regulations. The movement spread, with Shackleton's help, to Leinster, and he was regarded as a particularly dangerous dissident because of his moral and intellectual eminence. His rebellious stand was reinforced by contact with the American Hannah Barnard, a progressive Quaker minister who was in Ireland between 1798 and 1800, and fierce opposition arose against them spearheaded by another visiting American Quaker, the evangelical David Sands, who &#145;like too many of his countrymen was fond of pushing the exercise of Church power to the uttermost extreme&#146;  (<span class="italic">Records and Collections</span>, 305). Shackleton, the friend of religious and civil liberty, became caught between the opposing forces of Enlightenment on the one hand and of evangelicalism and reaction on the other, and he was disowned by the Carlow monthly meeting in 1801. The wholesale resignations and disownments from the Society of Friends at this time became known as the Irish separation, and the society, considerably weakened by the loss of its spiritual and intellectual &eacute;lite, fell into a period of stagnation. Shackleton and his fellow liberal John Bewley accompanied Hannah Barnard to England and acted as her counsellors during her dispute with the Quakers in London, but her progress was blocked and she returned to America taking the seeds of discord with her, which in due course led to the Hicksite separation of 1827&#150;8.<br>
<br>Shackleton, who regretted the consequences of the schism, thereafter lived separate from all societies, writing great numbers of essays on philanthropic subjects, which occasionally appeared in periodicals; he also published a volume of poetry, <span class="italic">The Court of Apollo</span> (1815). Shackleton was intelligent and animated, with a light, well-proportioned physique. He died at home on 2 August 1818 after a short but painful illness, secure in his belief that &#145;God is Love&#146;, and, although a non-member, he was buried two days later in the Quaker burial-ground at Ballitore. He was survived by his wife, who died on 5 February 1829.<br>
