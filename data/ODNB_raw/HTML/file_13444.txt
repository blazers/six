<span class="headword">Hodgson,  Joseph</span>  (1788&#150;1869), <span class="occ">surgeon</span>, son of a Birmingham merchant, was born at Penrith, Cumberland, and was educated at King Edward VI Grammar School, Birmingham. After serving an apprenticeship to George Freer, a surgeon at Birmingham General Hospital, Hodgson, whose father had lost money heavily, was enabled by an uncle's generosity to commence study at St Bartholomew's Hospital, London. He obtained the diploma of the Royal College of Surgeons in 1811, and gained in the same year the Jacksonian prize for his essay, &#145;On wounds and diseases of the arteries and veins&#146;. He began practice in London at King Street, Cheapside, and also served for a short time at the York Military Hospital, Chelsea. He eked out his income by taking pupils and by writing for, and acting for some years as editor of, the <span class="italic">London Medical Review</span>; he also produced other works, including helping with the pioneering book on congenital heart disease by John Richard Farre, and his <span class="italic">Treatise on the Diseases of Arteries and Veins</span> (1815) was translated into French and German and won him an international reputation.<br>
<br>In 1818 Hodgson moved to Birmingham, and on 23 January married Mary Ann Marston Ledsam, daughter of a wealthy clergyman. Hodgson was quickly elected surgeon to the General Dispensary and, in 1822, to Birmingham General Hospital. He held the latter appointment until 1848. He took a prominent part in founding the Birmingham Eye Infirmary in 1824, and was at first the only surgeon there. He had a large practice in Birmingham, numbering among his patients, and friends, Sir Robert Peel and several members of his family. Hodgson was particularly successful at lithotomy, for which his mortality rate was strikingly low. In 1831 he was elected to the fellowship of the Royal Society, and in 1843 he became one of the original fellows of the Royal College of Surgeons. In 1832 he was present at the meeting at Worcester at which the Provincial Medical and Surgical Association, later the British Medical Association, was founded. In 1842 he performed the post-mortem examination on Thomas Arnold, the reforming headmaster of Rugby, whose premature death from coronary artery disease has been much discussed by medical historians. Such was Hodgson's reputation that, at different times, he was invited to London to join the staff of the Middlesex Hospital or to accept the chair of surgery at King's College Hospital. He declined these invitations.<br>
<br>Hodgson had lost the sight of an eye in 1841, and in 1849, because of deteriorating health, he retired to London with a considerable fortune. He was elected a member of the council of the Royal College of Surgeons, and examiner in surgery to the college and to London University. In 1851 he was president of the Medico-Chirurgical Society, and in 1864 he was president of the Royal College of Surgeons. He died at his home, 60 Westbourne Terrace, London, on 7 February 1869, aged eighty-one. His wife had died twenty-four hours earlier. He was buried in Highgate cemetery on 13 February.<br>
<br>Hodgson was an able surgeon and an accurate diagnostician but he was cautious in treatment and pessimistic in prognosis. He is said to have been a born conservative, averse to innovations, and he certainly opposed the foundation of the Birmingham medical school in 1828. Nevertheless, while declining to lecture there, he wrote wishing the school success. He also included a plea for the furtherance of physiological research in his Hunterian lecture at the Royal College of Surgeons in 1855. In later years he was remarkable for his suavity and kindness of manner.<br>
