<span class="headword">Porter, Sir  James</span>  (1710&#150;1776), <span class="occ">diplomatist</span>, was born in Dublin, the son of a captain of a troop of horse in James II's army, who changed his original name of La Roche to Porter following the failure of James's campaign in Ireland. His mother, who died on 7 January 1753, was the eldest daughter of Isaye Daubuz (1637&#150;1685), a Huguenot minister from Guienne, and his wife, Julie (<i>c</i>.1639&#150;1714); her brother was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7188/', "Charles Daubuz (1673&#150;1717)")</script>, vicar of Brotherton.<br>
<br>After a slight education Porter was placed in a business in the City of London. In his spare time he studied mathematics and became fluent in French and Italian; he also joined the Robin Hood debating society, where he distinguished himself as a speaker. Through his friend Robert Adams, who became recorder of the City of London and a baron of the exchequer, Porter was introduced to Lord Carteret and was employed by him on several secret commercial missions to the continent. While in Germany in 1736 Porter visited Count Zinzendorff's Moravian settlement near Leipzig, of which he wrote an account, later published in <span class="italic">Turkey: its History and Progress</span>. In 1741 he was sent to Vienna to assist Sir Thomas Robinson in the negotiations between Austria and Prussia; he returned the following year to Vienna on a special mission to Maria Theresa.<br>
<br>On 22 September 1746 Porter was appointed ambassador at Constantinople, where he remained until May 1762. He won praise from Sir William Jones for protecting Britain's mercantile interests in the Ottoman empire. On 7 May 1763 he was appointed minister-plenipotentiary at Brussels, and on 21 September was knighted, apparently having refused the offer of a baronetcy. Finding the expenses of maintaining his position in Brussels beyond his means, he resigned his post in 1765 and returned to England, where he divided his time between London and Ham. He had married in 1755 Clarissa Catherine (<i>d</i>. 1766), the eldest daughter of Elbert de Hochepied, second Baron de Hochepied of the kingdom of Hungary, who was the Dutch ambassador at Constantinople. They had five children: John Elbert, who died in infancy in Pera in 1756; the diarist Anna Margaretta (1758&#150;1832) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/65588/', "Larpent, Anna Margaretta")</script>], who married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16077/', "John Larpent")</script>; George (1760&#150;1828), who was born at Pera and succeeded as sixth Baron de Hochepied in February 1819; Sophia Albertini, who died unmarried; and Clarissa Catherine (1764&#150;1833), who married James Trail, secretary of state for Ireland.<br>
<br>In his retirement Porter devoted himself to scientific and literary pursuits. A fellow of the Royal Society, he declined to be nominated president in 1768, &#145;not feeling himself of sufficient consequence or rich enough to live in such a style as he conceived that the president of such a society should maintain&#146;  (Larpent, 11). He published three papers in the <span class="italic">Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society</span> on astronomical observations he had made at Constantinople and on the earthquakes he had experienced there. His journals and correspondence were published by his grandson <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16076/', "Sir George Gerard Larpent")</script>, together with a somewhat inaccurate memoir of his life, under the title of <span class="italic">Turkey: its History and Progress</span> (2 vols., 1854). Porter died in Great Marlborough Street, London, on 9 December 1776, aged sixty-six.<br>
