<span class="headword">Langton,  Robert</span>  (1470&#150;1524), <span class="occ">ecclesiastic and pilgrim</span>, was born at Appleby, Westmorland, on 25 June 1470. The names of his parents are unrecorded, but he had two brothers and five sisters. He also had powerful kinsmen in the church, for <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16045/', "Thomas Langton")</script>, who died in 1501 as archbishop-elect of Canterbury, was his uncle, and Christopher Bainbridge, who became a cardinal and archbishop of York, was his cousin. Robert owed his education and early preferments to the former. From 1487 he studied at the Queen's College, Oxford, where his uncle was provost, doubtless financing his tuition from a series of benefices which began in 1483 with a prebend in Lincoln Cathedral. Though not recorded as having taken orders, in 1485 he was also collated to a prebend in Salisbury Cathedral, and on 25 June 1486 he became archdeacon of Dorset in Salisbury diocese, where Thomas Langton was then bishop. Then on 6 April 1493 Robert Langton was recorded at Bologna, and he probably remained in Italy until he took his DCL degree at Bologna on 14 May 1498. The degree was incorporated at Oxford in 1501, the year in which Thomas Langton died.<br>
<br>His uncle's death did not prevent Langton's adding livings in Devon and Wiltshire to his collection of benefices, but his principal patron was now his cousin Bainbridge, thanks to whom he was admitted treasurer of York Minster on 24 April 1509. On 23 September following, immediately before leaving England for Rome, Bainbridge appointed Langton to a commission to administer York diocese in his absence. But Langton did not stay long in England, for on 11 October 1511 Bainbridge licensed him to go on pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, Rome, and other places. His travels were wide-ranging, in Spain, southern France, and Italy, and eventually brought him to Rome, where he was recorded in March and April 1514. He probably returned to England soon afterwards, for by May 1514 he had resigned both his archdeaconry and his treasurership, though he retained his prebends in Lincoln (until 1518) and Salisbury, and added to them prebends in York and Southwell minsters. He took up residence in the London Charterhouse.<br>
<br>A wealthy man, Langton was a benefactor to the God's House hospital in Southampton (where he maintained another residence), and above all to his alma mater at Queen's. Probably beginning in 1516, he financed the building of an ante-chapel which more than doubled the size of the college chapel, at a reported cost of &pound;300. The work was probably largely completed by 1518, a date recorded in several stained-glass panels. He also paid for work on the provost's lodgings. Langton died in 1524 in the Charterhouse, where he requested burial, between 20 June, when he drew up his will, and the 30th, when a successor was collated to his Salisbury prebend. His memorial brass at Queen's, the stylized representation of a cleric, is far removed from the portrait of him recorded as &#145;lately&#146; seen in 1858, depicting &#145;an elderly man, with white flowing beard, moustache, and hair; the features of a pronounced character, the nose being long and aquiline, and the eye piercing&#146;  (Thompson, 347). The picture, said to have come from Annesley Hall, Nottinghamshire, is not otherwise recorded.<br>
<br>Langton is also commemorated by his educational benefactions and by a book. In his will he made cash bequests totalling at least &pound;623, including &pound;10 for poor scholars at Oxford and &pound;200 to Queen's &#145;to purchase lande and to make a scole howse in Appylby where I was born&#146;  (will, fol. 166). In 1681 it was recorded that he and his younger kinsman Miles Spenser had financed the &#145;Litle Schole&#146; in front of Appleby grammar school's main building, and the two men's names were still engraved on the school seal in the 1920s. Langton's book shows him in a drier light. In 1522 he published <span class="italic">The pylgrymage of M. Robert Langton clerke to Seynt James in Compostell and in other holy places of Crystendome</span> (STC 15206). Only one copy is known to survive, in Lincoln Cathedral Library, though a modern edition appeared in 1924. It is presented in the form of a travelogue, starting at Orl&eacute;ans and listing the places, with the distances between them, visited on his journey to Santiago and beyond. The itinerary is followed by a series of glosses on many of the places named in it, providing details of their relics and images, and sometimes also of points of secular interest, such as the tomb of Dante at Ravenna and the famous statue of Laocoon (disinterred only in 1506) in Rome.<br>
<br>In 1509 Langton walked alongside John Colet in Henry VII's funeral procession, and he named Cuthbert Tunstall and Richard Pace, both members of Colet's circle of moderate humanist reformers, as supervisors of his will. Like Colet, Langton wanted to advance the provision of learning. Unlike him, he clearly believed wholeheartedly in the spiritual value of pilgrimages: in the preamble to his <span class="italic">Pylgrymage</span> Langton declares that he has lately visited Jerusalem, and the emblems on his coat of arms may indicate that he travelled to Egypt and Sinai as well. In his old-fashioned stress on the penitential benefits of pilgrimages for those who &#145;take peyne on them for Crystes sake and encrease of theyr merytes&#146;  (<span class="italic">Pilgrimage</span>, 39), and his omitting to record the indulgences associated with relics and shrines, Langton may nevertheless reflect the aspirations of Colet and his associates to recover a pre-scholastic piety. In the early 1520s, however, such a position was out of step with popular devotion, perhaps explaining the apparent failure of his book.<br>
