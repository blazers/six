<span class="headword">Tatham,  William</span>  (1752&#150;1819), <span class="occ">geographer and engineer</span>, was born on 13 April 1752 at Hutton in the Forest, Cumberland, the eldest son of Sandford Tatham (1721/2&#150;1777), rector of Hutton and vicar of Appleby, and his wife, daughter of Henry Marsden of Gisborne Hall, Yorkshire. He had one sister and three brothers, one of whom, Charlie, was to help him in his schemes in adult life. William was brought up in Lancaster in the house of his maternal grandmother until her death in 1760. His family was wealthy and well connected, being related to the earl of Lonsdale; but Tatham seems to have had a rift with his family, as in 1769 he was sent to America to seek his fortune. He became a clerk with Carter and Trent, merchants on the James River, Virginia. Early in 1776 he moved to the Watauga settlement in the Tennessee country, where he became involved in politics and from 1776 to 1781 fought intermittently in the War of Independence on the American side, further estranging himself from his family. He saw action in several parts of the country, including the south-west frontier where he was involved in several campaigns against the Cherokee and Creek peoples, who were allies of the British in the war. Between campaigns he continued his civilian activities: in 1778 he was trading in Virginia, and in 1780 he and Colonel John Todd of Kentucky prepared a &#145;History of the western country&#146; of which the manuscript has been lost.<br>
<br>By 1781 Tatham had returned to civilian life and, after trading as a merchant in Philadelphia and visiting Havana, he began to study law, being called to the bar of Virginia on 24 March 1784. In 1786 he helped establish the settlement of Lamberton, near Fayetteville, North Carolina. In 1787 he was elected to represent Robeson county in the state legislature of North Carolina, which body elected him lieutenant-colonel of militia. In 1788 he visited England, having been reconciled with his family, but returned to Virginia in 1789 where he was employed by the state government to furnish the war office with information about the south-west frontier. He was given accommodation at the public expense and had free access to the archives of state. In 1791 he published <span class="italic">A Topographical Analysis of the Commonwealth of Virginia</span> and that year he was authorized by the legislature of Virginia to raise by lottery money to complete his geographical survey of the state, which was to be part of a general topographical survey of the whole of America. In 1792 he returned to the Tennessee country where he practised law, mapped the region, and gathered material for its history. In 1796 he went to Spain as American envoy, hoping to use the geographical information and historic maps which he had collected to settle disputes which had arisen on the frontiers of Florida; but the Spanish authorities ordered him to leave, angered by his interference in the country's internal affairs.<br>
<br>Tatham arrived in England on 16 August 1796 and shortly afterwards began to publish in periodicals and pamphlets on agriculture, the construction of canals, and other engineering projects. In 1801 he was appointed superintendent of the London docks at Wapping, where he took charge of the office of works, but he left in July that year, &#145;somewhat mortified by the idea of checking his own ideas in favour of those of others&#146;  (<span class="italic">Annual Biography</span>, 157). While in England he had numerous contacts with the Society of Arts, and his relationship with the society epitomizes his character. He joined in 1802 after corresponding earlier with the society on the subject of the growing of hemp in Canada. A self-proclaimed authority on the matter, despite never having been to Canada, he successfully reshaped the system of bounties offered by the society to foster hemp growing. He became very active on committees and had grand schemes for admitting American members; but his enthusiasm and his schemes fizzled out, and by 1804 he had contacted his old friend James Munroe, who happened to be in London, with a view to obtaining a position in the US and returned there in 1805 with a letter of recommendation to James Madison.<br>
<br>Tatham was appointed commissioner for surveying the coast of North Carolina and his map of the state (1807) survives in the Library of Congress. After this he spent about five years as draughtsman and geographer in the department of state, Washington, and in 1817 Munroe secured him employment as military storekeeper at the New United States Arsenal at Richmond, Virginia. He had amassed an important collection of military models, maps, topographical descriptions, and other documents, which he offered to the United States congress, and in his offers he anticipated the importance of amassing a national library collection. At the time of his first offer in 1806 his collection contained nearly all the surveys known to have been made in America by topographical surveyors of England, France, and Spain, and he continued to collect geographical material as he moved about the country. At Richmond he turned to drink which worsened the poverty to which his restless life, estrangement from his family, and grandiose ambitions had always left him prone. He committed suicide on 22 February 1819 by stepping in front of a cannon as it was fired. He was unmarried.<br>
<br>Although well enough known in Britain to warrant long death notices, Tatham rapidly fell into almost complete obscurity there, although in the United States he remained better known, not least because of his contacts with political figures of the importance of Jefferson, Madison, and Munroe. He has been hailed as the founder of the US topographical and coast surveys, because of his own maps, charts, and plans, and schemes to extend them throughout the country; of conservation in the US, because of his concern to safeguard the natural resources of the western part of the continent; and of the idea of a Library of Congress for the benefit of the nation, amassing documents and artefacts recording the nation's history. He was short of neither ideas nor energy, but it is as an &#145;adventurer&#146;  (Boyd, 241), rather than a &#145;versatile&#146;  (Herndon, <span class="italic">William Tatham &hellip; American Versatile</span>), that he is remembered because of his failure to sustain solid achievement in any of his many fields of activity.<br>
