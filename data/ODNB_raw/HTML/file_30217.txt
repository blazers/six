<span class="headword">Yeo, Sir  James Lucas</span>  (1782&#150;1818), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, son of James Yeo (<i>d</i>. 21 Jan 1825), formerly agent victualler at Minorca, and his wife (<i>d</i>. 13 January 1822) was born at Southampton on 7 October 1782. He was briefly at the Revd Mr Walters's academy at Bishop's Waltham, Hampshire, but when little more than ten, in March 1793, he was entered as a boy volunteer on the <i>Windsor Castle</i>, which was going to the Mediterranean as flagship of Rear-Admiral Phillips Cosby, whom he followed to the <i>Alcide</i>, returning to England with him at the end of 1794. In the spring of 1795 he joined the <i>Orion</i> with Captain John Thomas Duckworth in the channel, and was shortly afterwards taken by Duckworth to the <i>Leviathan</i>, going to Jamaica. On 20 February 1797 Yeo was promoted lieutenant of the <i>Albicore</i> until, early in 1798, after a sharp attack of yellow fever, he was sent home.<br>
<br>Appointed to the <i>Veteran</i> in the North Sea, and in December 1798 to the <i>Charon</i>, going to the Mediterranean, in May 1800 he was moved to the brig <i>El Corso</i> (Commander William Ricketts) and was present at the siege of Genoa. On 26 August 1800 the brig's boats, commanded by Yeo and covered by the cutter <i>Pigmy</i>, forced their way into the harbour of Cesenatico in the Adriatic, burnt or sank thirteen merchant vessels, and burnt the piers. In February 1802 Yeo was moved to the <i>G&eacute;n&eacute;reux</i>, in which he returned to England. In February 1805 he was appointed to the <i>Loire</i> with Captain Frederick Lewis Maitland and commanded her boats on several expeditions, notably in Muros Bay on 4 June, where, after spiking the guns of a small battery, with only 50 men he stormed a closed fort in the town (garrisoned by 250 men, whose governor Yeo killed with his sabre), spiked its guns, and made it possible for the <i>Loire</i> to seize a large privateer and some other vessels lying in the bay. The privateer, unarmed but pierced for 26 guns, was commissioned for the navy under the name of <i>Confiance</i>, and Yeo was promoted to command her; his commission was dated 21 June 1805.<br>
<br>After two years on the Lisbon station Yeo was sent home with dispatches in November 1807 by Sir William Sidney Smith and on 19 December was promoted captain. He was, however, continued in the <i>Confiance</i> and sent back to the Tagus, whence in the following spring he accompanied Smith to Brazil. From Rio de Janeiro he was sent in September 1808 to Para, where he suggested to the governor the practicability of taking Cayenne and French Guiana. The governor gave Yeo such Portuguese as he could add to his force, but when he landed at Cayenne on 7 January 1809 he had in all only 400 men with whom to attack a garrison of 1200 in a strongly fortified position mounting over 200 guns. When five weeks later the place surrendered Yeo found himself with upwards of 1000 prisoners on his hands and no adequate means of securing them. For more than a month, until he received reinforcements, neither Yeo nor any of his force slept out of their clothes. Most were attacked by fever, and Yeo, after being confined to bed for two months with a severe bout of malaria, was obliged to go to England to recover. At Rio the prince regent of Portugal presented him with a valuable diamond ring and nominated him knight commander of St Benedict of Aviz, an order of a semi-religious character; it was said that Yeo was the first protestant admitted. His acceptance of the order was approved by George III, and he was knighted on 17 March 1810; he received a British knighthood on 21 June.<br>
<br>In 1811 Yeo commanded the frigate <i>Southampton</i> on the Jamaica station, and on 3 February 1812 took the <i>Amethyste</i>, a large pirate frigate stolen from the Haitian &#145;emperor&#146;, Christophe, to whom it was restored. On 22 November 1812 he captured the American brig <i>Vixen</i> (14 guns), but on the 27th, returning to Jamaica via the Crooked Island passage through the Bahamas, both the <i>Southampton</i> and its prize were wrecked on an uncharted reef 4 miles off the island of Conception.<br>
<br>On 19 March 1813 Yeo was appointed commodore and commander-in-chief of the warships on the North American lakes and reached Kingston at the foot of Lake Ontario in the early part of May. Sending subordinate commanders to the other lakes, Yeo focused on Lake Ontario, on whose control the entire British position in Upper Canada depended. By the end of the month he had assembled an efficient squadron of two ships of 24 and 20 guns, with a 14-gun brig and some smaller vessels, and had agreed with Sir George Prevost on an attack on Sackett's Harbour, where the enemy had a couple of large vessels on the stocks. American rumour had Yeo reconnoitring their base in person, disguised as a farmer selling potatoes. On the 27th troops were embarked, but when off the harbour the cautious Prevost refused to land. Two days later he was encouraged to make another attempt. This time the men were landed, had driven out the enemy, and had set fire to the two ships when Prevost's nerve again failed him and he re-embarked, permitting the enemy to reoccupy the port and extinguish the fire. In Prevost's absence Yeo took his squadron up the lake in June, capturing or destroying enemy storeships and depots and reversing the American army's invasion.<br>
<br>But by the end of July 1813 the larger of the two vessels not burnt at Sackett's Harbour was ready for service. Of 850 tons, mounting twenty-eight long 24-pounders, with a crew of 400 men, she was described as nearly a match for the whole of the British squadron. The American advantage was not only in the possession of this powerful ship, but also in the heavier and more efficient armament of the rest of the squadron; and though in an engagement near Niagara on 10 August Yeo succeeded in cutting off and capturing two of the enemy's schooners, his main ally was the caution of the American commodore. Other partial engagements took place on 11 and 28 September, in the latter of which, the so-called &#145;Burlington Races&#146;, Yeo was obliged to break off action and beat for Kingston. But the American refused close action, relying on his long guns alone, with which he could not obtain any marked success.<br>
<br>Under a more adventurous commander the American squadron on Lake Erie took full advantage of its superior force and overwhelmed the British squadron on 10 September. During the winter great exertions were made by both parties. Yeo built two large ships at Kingston, and with these added to his squadron embarked a large body of troops and attacked Oswego on 6 May 1814. After a sharp contest the place was carried, and a large quantity of ordnance stores and provisions was captured or destroyed. Yeo then blockaded Sackett's Harbour, where the enemy had also launched two large ships, which they were unable to fit out so long as the stores could be prevented from reaching them. By the end of July he was obliged to raise the blockade, and the Americans with a vastly superior force were able to drive Yeo back to Kingston and blockade him there until September. Yeo's policy was to avoid defeat and maintain his squadron in being while building the 110-gun <i>St Lawrence</i>. When he finally sailed on 15 October it was the Americans' turn to remain in harbour.<br>
<br>Yeo's position had all along been one of great difficulty, not only in consequence of the Americans' advantages for building and fitting out ships, but still more in consequence of the indisposition of Prevost to co-operate fully. Their differences came to a head after the catastrophe on Lake Champlain occasioned by Prevost's call on the navy for assistance and his neglect to support the squadron [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28492/', "Walker, James Robertson-")</script>]. The case appeared so flagrant that Yeo preferred distinct charges of gross neglect of duty, and though Prevost died before he could be brought to a court martial, the court which tried Walker and the other survivors found that the disaster was &#145;principally caused&#146; by Prevost's urging the squadron into battle when it was not &#145;in a proper state to meet the enemy&#146;, and by his not co-operating as he had promised. On 2 January 1815 Yeo was made KCB, but overwork and the marsh fever of the Kingston area played on a body debilitated by the malaria contracted in Cayenne, and he returned to Britain in May. Canadians have always regarded him as one of the heroes of the Anglo-American War of 1812&#150;14.<br>
<br>On 5 June 1815 Yeo was appointed commander-in-chief on the west coast of Africa, with a broad pennant in the <i>Inconstant</i>, and special responsibility for the anti-slavery patrol. In October 1817 he moved into the <i>Semiramis</i>, in which he went to Jamaica, and sailed thence for England. On the passage, on 21 August 1818, he died &#145;of general debility&#146;. His body was brought home and buried on 8 September in the garrison chapel at Portsmouth. He was not married.<br>
