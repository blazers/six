<span class="headword">MacLellan,  Angus</span> <span class="st"> [Aonghus Beag mac Aonghuis 'ic Eachainn 'ic Dhomhnaill 'ic Chaluim 'ic Dhomhnaill, Aonghus mac 'ill' Fhialain]</span>  (1869&#150;1966), <span class="occ">storyteller and farm worker</span>, was born at Poll Torain, Loch Eynort, South Uist, Inverness-shire, on 7 July 1869, the youngest son of Angus MacLellan, grass-keeper, and his wife, Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Wilson. The younger Angus was one of the last great traditional Gaelic storytellers of South Uist, Inverness-shire, a crofter&#150;fisherman and a skilled farm worker with horses and sheep; his sister, Mrs Neil Campbell, who lived to be 100, was said to have been the last monoglot Gaelic speaker on South Uist, and was herself the teller of pithy anecdotes and a singer of Gaelic ballads and old waulking songs.<br>
<br>A collection of forty-five of MacLellan's stories, including his version of <span class="italic">Fionn saga</span> and a number of international folk tales, was published in translation in 1961 as <span class="italic">Stories from South Uist</span>. Many other stories which he recorded have still to be transcribed and translated. His story of Conall Gulbann was published in volume 44 of the <span class="italic">Transactions of the Gaelic Society of Inverness</span> as a Gaelic text with English pr&eacute;cis by J. L. Campbell. His version of the &#145;Cattle Raid of Cooley&#146; was published by Dr Calum MacLean in <span class="italic">Arv</span> (20. 160&#150;80).<br>
<br>Much historical and sociological interest attaches to MacLellan's autobiography, published in 1962 in translation as <span class="italic">The Furrow Behind Me</span>. Taken from a recording, the Gaelic text was published in the <span class="italic">Norsk Tidsskrift for Sprogvidenskap</span> in 1972 and entitled <span class="italic">Saoghal an treobhaiche</span> (&#145;The ploughman's world&#146;). It is the longest text in colloquial Scottish Gaelic and includes his memories of life as a farm worker for Robert Menzies at Tirinie (1889&#150;93) and Thomas MacDonald at Borenich (1893&#150;4) (both farms in Perthshire), for Edward Kane at Rowardennan on Loch Lomondside (1895&#150;7), and for Duncan Fraser at Dalmally, Argyll (1898&#150;1900), in the days when farm workers in the highlands signed on to work for six months for about &pound;15 and potatoes and milk.<br>
<br>Later MacLellan went home to help his parents in Uist, and in 1908 he obtained the official status of a crofter there. His stories and his memories are told with a wealth of dialogue and characterization which would do credit to a professional novelist. MacLellan was made MBE in 1965 for his great contribution to the preservation of Gaelic oral literature and was also an honorary chieftain of the Gaelic Society of Inverness. He died unmarried at 6 Frobost, South Uist, on 19 March 1966 and was buried at Hanlainn on that island.<br>
