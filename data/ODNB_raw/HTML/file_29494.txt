</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Williams,  David</span>  (1738&#150;1816), <span class="occ">political and religious theorist and founder of the Literary Fund</span>, the son of William David (<i>d</i>. 1752), was born at Waunwaelod, near Watford, on the north slope of Caerphilly Mountain in the parish of Eglwysilan, Glamorgan, south Wales, and baptized there on 9 December 1738. His father invested his money in a shop supplying tools to mining works, but the venture ultimately failed. Three of his brothers &#145;just entering into life died of a consumption, the malady of the family&#146;  (Williams, 14); two sisters survived into adult life. He was educated locally in the school of the Revd Lewis Rogers and that of his namesake, the Revd David Williams of Pwll-y-pant, minister of Watford Independent Chapel. On his deathbed in May 1752, his father exacted a promise from his fourteen-year-old son that he would attend the dissenting academy at Carmarthen. Despite Williams's avowed &#145;indisposition to the dissenting ministry&#146;  (ibid.), he honoured his promise, and, in December 1753, assisted by a grant from the Presbyterian Fund, was taken to Carmarthen by the Revd David Williams, who had himself attended Carmarthen Academy. The academy at this time had a reputation for theological heterodoxy, and in 1757 the congregational board withdrew its financial support.<h2>
<a name="FrometoLondonandfirstwritings"></a>Frome to London and first writings</h2>After four years of study at Carmarthen, Williams left in 1758 to become minister at the Presbyterian chapel in Rook Lane, Frome, Somerset, on an annual salary of &pound;45. He was well liked by his congregation, and remained there until 1762, when he moved to the Mint chapel in Exeter. The death of his father had left his mother and sisters in some financial distress, and Williams declares that it was this which induced him to move to Exeter and kept him &#145;from making an advantageous marriage&#146;  (Williams, 14). It was at Exeter that he commenced his programme of reforming public worship, persuading his Arian congregation to adopt a liturgy modelled on the non-sectarian liturgy in use since 1763 at the Octagon Chapel, Liverpool. At Exeter, however, his reputation was tarnished by various imputations of imprudent conduct; as he himself records: &#145;I spent nineteen parts in twenty of my time among women. This seduced me into the paths of pleasure, which the eye of censure soon observed, and which soon led me &hellip; out of the narrow enclosures of my profession&#146;  (ibid., 15). Such rumours were to resurface in a series of letters by a female correspondent signing herself Sappho that appeared in the <span class="italic">St James's Chronicle</span> in 1777. In 1769 Williams left Exeter for London, establishing himself in Frith Street, Soho, probably as a private tutor. In 1770 or early 1771 he became the minister of the small Presbyterian congregation at Southwood Lane in Highgate; he claims that by the time he left, the congregation had much increased. At Highgate he also engaged in the regular tutoring of pupils. In 1771 he published (anonymously) his first work, <span class="italic">The Philosopher</span>, in which, in the form of a dialogue between a philosopher (clearly Williams's mouthpiece), a courtier, a whig, a Presbyterian minister and an Anglican clergyman, he discusses the corruption of the political and religious <i>status quo</i>, enjoining doctrinal freedom and the need for a form of public worship based on a fundamental moral deism. The work was well received, and attracted the favourable notice of the Cambridge liberal John Jebb. His second work published during his time at Highgate (again anonymously), <span class="italic">A Letter to David Garrick</span> (1772), reflects his interest in the theatre; Williams reproaches Garrick for his treatment of the actor Henry Mossop and offers a criticism of Garrick's acting and of his stranglehold on the profession. Williams left Highgate in the late spring or summer of 1773; he was not to return to the ministry. Despite the fact that he later cited financial reasons for leaving the ministry, it is clear that formal Christianity was something he no longer felt able to square with his conscience.<h2>
<a name="Liturgicalexperimentsreligiousdebatesandmarriage"></a>Liturgical experiments, religious debates, and marriage</h2>Following the warm reception of <span class="italic">The Philosopher</span>, Williams was encouraged to frame a simplified Christian liturgy. Thus in 1771 or 1772 he composed what appeared in 1774 as his <span class="italic">Liturgy on the Principles of the Christian Religion</span>, closely modelled on the Octagon Chapel liturgy. But in the light of the far more theologically bold position he adopted in <span class="italic">Essays on Public Worship</span> (1773), this liturgy had been superseded before it appeared. In the <span class="italic">Essays</span>, written against the background of the debate surrounding the dissenting petitions submitted to parliament in 1772 seeking the abolition of subscription to the <span class="roman">Thirty-Nine Articles</span>, Williams criticizes the hypocrisy and intolerance of the dissenters as well as that of the established church, stressing that unconditional philosophical liberty should be the dissenters' goal and advocating a universal form of public worship purged of sectarian doctrines and based on simple morality. The <span class="italic">Essays</span>, which were seen as coming very close to overt deism, made him notorious&#151;&#145;I was educated among the Saints; and I now live, thank God, among Sinners&#146;  (p. 24)&#151;and he was deserted &#145;not only by the negociators for a reformed plan of worship, but by almost every friend and acquaintance he had in the world&#146;  (Morris, 7). On 16 December 1773 Williams married Mary Emilia Moore (<i>d</i>. 1774), &#145;a person without the slightest fortune, solely for love&#146;  (Wendeborn, 3.371), and opened a school for young boys in Lawrence Street, Chelsea.<br>
<br>It was the <span class="italic">Essays</span> that led to a friendship in 1773 with Benjamin Franklin, who is said by Thomas Morris to have nicknamed Williams Priest of Nature. At their first meeting, attended also by Thomas Bentley, who had been instrumental in establishing the Octagon Chapel in Liverpool, they &#145;commenced a club over a neck of veal and potatoes at the Old Slaughter Coffee House, which soon amounted to thirteen and was never permitted to exceed that number&#146;  (Williams, 16). So was founded the deist Club of Thirteen or Wednesdays Club, which probably met twice a month, either at Old Slaughter's, or at The Swan on Westminster Bridge; Franklin's rooms in Craven Street were also used. Williams was asked to compose a sample liturgy, which was repeatedly revised&#151;a project that resulted in 1776 in the publication and use at Williams's Margaret Street Chapel of his <span class="italic">Liturgy on the Universal Principles of Religion and Morality</span>. It was in the context of the Club of Thirteen also, at Easter 1773, that Williams first broached the idea of the Literary Fund, which was to prove his lasting achievement. The idea was greeted with sympathy, but it was resolved that the project be postponed. This was the occasion of Franklin's famous remark to Williams:&#145;&#147;I see you will not give up a noble idea. I do not say you will not succeed, but it must be by much anxiety and trouble, and I hope the anvil will not wear out the hammer&#148;&#146;  (Williams, 43).<h2>
<a name="Theeducationist"></a>The educationist</h2>In 1774 Williams published his first signed work, his <span class="italic">Treatise on Education</span>, in which he discusses the educational theories of Locke, Milton, Rousseau, and Helvetius. It was written at a time when his wife was expecting their first child, and in it Williams insists that the ideal school should function &#145;as much like well-regulated families as possible&#146;  (<span class="italic">Treatise on Education</span>, 24). Together with his <span class="italic">Lectures on Education</span> (1789), the <span class="italic">Treatise</span> appears to reflect the practical pedagogic techniques used in his Lawrence Street school, which took about a dozen students and where the fees were high (&pound;100 per annum). Intensely aware of the impracticality of the education he himself had received, and as an educational theorist and admirer of Comenius, Williams stressed the need for a teaching method based on activity and experiment, on things rather than words, and deprecated mechanical rote-learning. Corporal punishment was made subordinate to the judgement of a pupils' court in which Williams appeared as a member but never as a judge. The final section of the <span class="italic">Treatise</span>, &#145;History of Philo and Amelia&#146;, outlines his conception of an ideal, solitary upbringing akin to that of Rousseau's <span class="italic">&Eacute;mile</span>. From 1777 he increasingly concerned himself as a teacher with the instruction of older students of &#145;defective education&#146;. Defending himself against charges of impiety in his sermons at Highgate, Williams also published in 1774 sixteen sermons under the title <span class="italic">Sermons, Chiefly upon Religious Hypocrisy</span> (2 vols.), comprising &#145;all the sermons which I have ever known to offend, and to bring me the imputation of infidelity&#146;  (<span class="italic">Sermons</span>, 1.v). In their attack on the hypocrisy, puritanism, and doctrinal wrangling of dissent, and in their insistence on Christianity as a system of morality strictly equatable with the religion of Nature, however, one can see why they might have given offence.<br>
<br>A daughter, baptized Emilia, was born in Lawrence Street on 9 December 1774; Williams's wife died on 20 December and her death signalled the closure of the Lawrence Street academy in 1775. The fate of the daughter remains a mystery, and one must assume that she died in infancy. Wendeborn claims that in his grief Williams went to Derbyshire &#145;in order to indulge his melancholy thoughts&#146;  (Wendeborn, 3.371) but Morien 
    (Owen Morgan; 1836?&#150;1921)
  , presumes that he &#145;sought consolation among his early associations at Caerphilly&#146;  (Morien, <span class="italic">Western Mail</span>, 27 May 1890, p. 2). From mid-summer 1775 to late 1776 he resided in Park Street, Grosvenor Square. It seems that a few years after the death of his wife, a lasting attachment developed between Williams and Frances Martyn, wife of the Revd Thomas Martyn, curate of St Anne's, Soho; she was to live with Williams until her death in 1812.<h2>
<a name="TheMargaretStreetexperiment"></a>The Margaret Street experiment</h2>On Easter Sunday, 7 April 1776, Williams opened a chapel in Margaret Street, Cavendish Square, and read from the <span class="italic">Liturgy on the Universal Principles of Religion and Morality</span>, the collaborative production of members of the Club of Thirteen. He later noted that at the beginning of the war against America, &#145;a spirit of discord pervading the country affected the little society formed at Dr. Franklin's, and soon dissolved it&#146;  (Williams, 17), leaving him responsible for the opening of the chapel and the introduction of the liturgy. The preface to this universalist <span class="italic">Liturgy</span> of 1776 describes the experiment as a form of social worship &#145;in which all men may join who acknowledge the existence of a supreme intelligence, and the universal obligations of morality&#146;  (<span class="italic">Liturgy</span>, x&#150;xi). Its format, containing an order for morning and for evening prayer and a collection of hymns and psalms, is reminiscent of an Anglican format, but the liturgy avoids all dogmatic statements of belief beyond an acknowledgement of the wisdom and goodness of a supreme intelligence and the moral obligations of a simple deism that celebrates nature as implying the existence of God. All specifically Christian doctrines of faith are carefully excluded. Copies of the liturgy were sent to Voltaire and Frederick the Great of Prussia, and in Paris in the summer of 1776 Bentley presented a copy to Rousseau. All three responded enthusiastically. Voltaire wrote:<blockquote>It is a great comfort to me, at the age of eighty-two years, to see the tolerance openly teach'd in your country, and the God of all mankind no more pent up in a narrow tract of land. That notable truth was worthy of your pen and of your tongue. (D. Williams, <span class="italic">Lectures on Education</span>, 3 vols., 1789, 3.302&#150;3)</blockquote>The Margaret Street venture has been seen as influencing the worship of reason and the Supreme Being in revolutionary France, and Henri Gr&eacute;goire saw it as informing French theophilanthropy under the Directory. In Gillray's cartoon &#145;New Morality&#146;, published in <span class="italic">The Anti-Jacobin</span> in July 1798, Williams, in the company of Paine, Godwin, Holcroft, Thelwall, Southey, Coleridge, and Lamb, appears as a snake slithering over his &#145;Atheistical lectures&#146;, paying homage to La R&eacute;veill&egrave;re Lepaux, one of the five members of the French directory, in St Paul's Cathedral. Accompanying the cartoon is George Canning's poem &#145;New morality, or, The promised installment of the high priest of the theophilanthropes, with the homage of Leviathan and his suite&#146;:<blockquote>
<div>All creeping creatures, venomous and low,<br>
</div>
<div>PAINE, W-LL-MS, G-DW-N, H-LC-FT, praise LE PAUX!<br>
</div>
</blockquote>1776 also saw the publication of Williams's <span class="italic">Sermon Preached at the Opening of a Chapel in Margaret-Street</span> and <span class="italic">The Morality of a Citizen</span>, which he described as &#145;an ironical Injunction to Passive Obedience&#146;  (<span class="italic">Lectures on the Universal Principles and Duties of Religion and Morality</span>, 1779). He again attacked what he saw as the tyranny of the dissenting sects in his <span class="italic">Letters to the Body of Protestant Dissenters</span> (1777), and was to repeat his criticisms of any test of opinions two years later in <span class="italic">The Nature and Extent of Intellectual Liberty</span>, addressed to Sir George Savile, and in his <span class="italic">Salutary Admonitions to the Dissenters</span> (1787). In 1778 appeared <span class="italic">Unanimity in All Parts of the British Commonwealth</span>, which contains a passionate attack on the entry of France into the American War. The same year was marked by personal enmity among the Margaret Street leadership, and personal and doctrinal dissension, together with financial difficulties, sparse attendance, and the political climate of the American War resulted in the closure of the chapel at mid-summer 1780. According to Gr&eacute;goire, Williams claimed that many members of the congregation were moving from deism to atheism. Williams defended his deism in the <span class="italic">Lectures on the Universal Principles and Duties of Religion and Morality</span> (1779), forty-six lectures delivered at Margaret Street and at the British Coffee House, Charing Cross, to which the services moved. Over the next two years he published translations of a number of Voltaire's works, including his <span class="italic">Trait&eacute; sur la tol&eacute;rance</span> and five of his comedies. Successors to the Margaret Street Chapel with which Williams was associated included a Philosophical Society, formed in 1780, and a Liberal Society, established in the mid-1780s. In 1780 he opened an Academy of Sciences and Belles-Lettres and a School of Eloquence in Carlisle House, and published his <span class="italic">Plan of Association on Constitutional Principles</span>, motivated by the anti-Catholic Gordon riots. In 1782 Williams published one of his most influential political works, <span class="italic">Letters on Political Liberty</span>, which contains a defence of the American colonists and argues for a reform of the parliamentary system with a radical extension of the vote and a system of delegation that would invest political power in the body of the people. The work was widely circulated; Jean-Pierre Brissot de Warville, who between 1782 and 1784 was attempting to establish a <i>lyc&eacute;e</i> in London and whom Williams met in 1783, arranged for a translation to be made, for which he was interrogated in the Bastille during the summer of 1784. In 1783 Williams established an occasional paper, <span class="italic">Friend of the People</span>, to promote political liberty. Having moved from Meard Street, Soho, back to Park Street, Grosvenor Square, Williams in 1785 relocated to special teaching facilities at 28 Great Russell Street, and between then and 1787 delivered three series of lectures on education.<h2>
<a name="TheLiteraryFund"></a>The Literary Fund</h2>It was the death in 1787 of the seventy-seven-year-old Floyer Sydenham, translator of Plato, who had been imprisoned for a small debt, that provided the impetus for the establishment of Williams's brainchild, the Literary Fund. In October 1786 Williams had unsuccessfully sought to bring artists within his projected scheme of a benevolent fund for authors, but this came to nothing. He unsuccessfully approached Adam Smith, Pitt, Burke, and Fox for support, but in 1788 18 guineas were subscribed to fund an advertisement; a constitution was drawn up and published as <span class="italic">Constitutions of a Society to Support Men of Genius and Learning in Distress</span>, and the fund became a reality in 1790. From 1793 the fund instituted a successful programme of anniversary dinners with glees, a band, and the recital of poetic tributes, and early beneficiaries included the widow and children of Robert Burns, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, George Dyer, and the radical pamphleteer John Oswald. Members who sat on the fund's committee during its early years included such reformers as James Martin, John Hurford Stone, Major Alexander Jardine, Thomas Christie, and William Frend. Over the course of the first decade or so of its existence, however, political reactionaries such as John Reeves, founder in 1792 of the Association for Preserving Liberty and Property Against Republicans and Levellers, William Boscawen, and W. T. Fitzgerald were prominently represented.<br>
<br>In 1788 Williams published anonymously his <span class="italic">Royal Recollections on a Tour to Cheltenham</span>, a satirical work purporting to be the journal of George III, which became his greatest commercial success, and <span class="italic">Constitutional Doubts</span>, written in reaction to the regency crisis, which recommends constitutional reform and warns the prince of Wales, who was later to become the patron of the Literary Fund, not to be deceived by Pitt. 1789 was a prolific year: in addition to the <span class="italic">Lectures on Education</span>, Williams published <span class="italic">Lectures on Political Principles</span>, in which he discussed Montesquieu's <span class="italic">De l'esprit des lois</span>; <span class="italic">Authentic Specimens of Ministerial Instructions</span>; and his <span class="italic">Apology for Professing the Religion of Nature</span>, which, together with his last attempt at a liturgy, the annexed <span class="italic">Liturgy on the Principles of Theism</span>, represents the culmination of his religious philosophy. From a position of a pared-down deism he roundly rejects what he sees as the metaphysical absurdities and morally pernicious doctrines of Christianity, scorns an anthropomorphic concept of God, whom he regards as unknowable and identifies with the laws of nature, and effects a separation of morality from religious dogma.<h2>
<a name="Revolutionandreaction"></a>Revolution and reaction</h2>In 1790 Williams addressed the prince of Wales in his <span class="italic">Lessons to a Young Prince, by an Old Statesman</span>, in which he attacks abuses of power in Britain and discusses the American constitution and the early stages of the French Revolution. The second edition contained a lengthy <i>ad hominem</i> attack on Burke as an enemy of the French Revolution and a &#145;political Swedenbourg&#146;. During 1792 he met Godwin, with whom he discussed the radical principles of Godwin's <span class="italic">Enquiry Concerning Political Justice</span> (1793). On 26 August 1792 Williams, together with Paine, Price, Priestley, Mackintosh, Wilberforce, and George Washington, was granted honorary French citizenship.<br>
<br>It was as the author of <span class="italic">Letters on Political Liberty</span>, which Williams claimed influenced French revolutionary thought, and as the mentor of Brissot, who introduced his Girondin colleagues to Williams's political ideas, that Williams was invited to Paris in November 1792 to take part in the debate on the French constitution of 1791 and in the framing of a new constitution following the <i>journ&eacute;e</i> of 10 August 1792. With Paine he had been offered a seat in the convention if he consented to &#145;[check] the rapidity of the revolution or commenced hostilities on the Jacobin Club&#146;  (Williams, 27); he declined. He arrived in Paris during the first week of December and immediately became disillusioned:<blockquote>I had not been in Paris a week when I perceived I could be of no use. The Convention was dividing into factions, while the Commune of Paris was seizing its power and the whole country crumbling into anarchy. The trial of the King, the whole of which I attended, gave me a perfect knowledge of the talents and spirit of the Convention. (Williams, 27)</blockquote>He was accused in a forged letter, produced by Chabot in the convention, of wishing to act as defence counsel to Louis XVI, and called a traitor and hypocrite by Robespierre. Amid this intrigue he was asked to write down his objections to the first French constitution, and his report was published in 1793 as <span class="italic">Observations sur la derni&egrave;re constitution de la France</span>. Diplomatic relations between France and Britain were deteriorating by the day, and Williams was asked by Brissot, Roland, and Le Brun to act as ambassador to London. He wisely rejected the offer but agreed to deliver &#145;in [his] own private character &hellip; any papers they chose to send into the hands of Lord Grenville, and say everything he would permit me to say to prevent a war&#146;  (Williams, 29). At the end of January it was again proposed that Williams deliver a letter to Grenville. In it Le Brun, suggesting an alliance between the British government and the Girondins, revealed how a war might be averted. Williams returned to London with this diplomatic commission in February 1793 but got no further than Aust, the under-secretary of state. &#145;I &hellip; did not press myself uselessly on Lord Grenville&#146;, Williams remarks, &#145;and I did not write to him, that the contents of my letter might not reach France and send the Girondist government instantly to the guillotine&#146;  (ibid., 31).<br>
<br>On his return Williams was received as &#145;a partisan of France&#146;  (Williams, 31). A contract with the miniaturist and entrepreneur Robert Bowyer to write a continuation of Hume's <span class="italic">History of England</span> fell through when Bowyer was informed that Williams had accepted French citizenship (a claim for breach of contract was settled in 1795). &#145;I withdrew from the political arena&#146;, he states, &#145;into my own private circle&#146;  (ibid., 34, 37). His experience in France certainly dealt a blow to the radical in him, and in his writings he increasingly deprecated political experimentation. Madame Roland's gracious remarks in her <span class="italic">Appel &agrave; l'impartiale post&eacute;rit&eacute;</span> (published in an English translation, <span class="italic">Appeal to Impartial Posterity</span>, in 1795) did much to rehabilitate his public image in the late 1790s: &#145;A deep thinker, and a real friend to mankind, he appeared to me to combine their means of happiness, as well as Paine feels and describes the abuses which constitute their misery&#146;  (Roland, pt 2, 42&#150;3).<br>
<br>At the suggestion of his friend the physician Dr Thomas Hooper of Pant-y-Goitre, Monmouthshire, and John Morgan of Tredegar, Williams embarked on the monumental <span class="italic">History of Monmouthshire</span>, published in 1796 with illustrations by John Gardnor; its heterogeneity reflects Williams's experience as an educator, religious philosopher, and political theorist. Williams in the same year published <span class="italic">Letter to the Right Rev. Dr Warren on his Conduct as Bishop of Bangor</span> under the pseudonym Sh&ocirc;n Gwialan at the behest of Thomas Williams, the north Wales copper magnate. In his <span class="italic">Regulations of Parochial Police</span> (1797) he responded to an expected French invasion by presenting a plan of parish security that would guard against the threat of internal malcontents. His reminiscences of Brissot, who had been executed on 31 October 1793, appeared in the second volume of <span class="italic">Biographical Anecdotes of the Founders of the French Republic</span> (1797&#150;8), and he offered an appraisal of the Girondins in his autobiography. His partnership at this time in the projected loyalist <span class="italic">Imperial Gazette</span> came to nothing. In May 1800 a decision was taken to publish a history of the Literary Fund, written by Williams, which duly appeared in 1802 as <span class="italic">Claims of Literature</span>. A celebrated quarrel resulted when one of the vice-presidents of the fund, Sir James Bland Burges, took violent exception to the moral and political principles of the work.<br>
<br>In October 1802 during the peace of Amiens, Williams returned to Paris to gauge the political climate as an agent of the British government, for which he produced a report on the Napoleonic regime. During 1802&#150;3 he was active as adviser on political and defence issues to Thomas Pelham, second earl of Chichester, home secretary in the Addington administration, who became vice-president of the Literary Fund in 1803. In that year he published <span class="italic">Egeria</span>, a collection of essays on political economy and philosophy that had appeared from 1802&#150;3 with government subvention; it again marks a retreat from his former radical beliefs. In July 1805 he secured the patronage of the prince of Wales, and moved into the premises of the Literary Fund that had been secured by the prince in 36 Gerrard Street, Soho. His final publication, <span class="italic">Preparatory Studies for Political Reformers</span>, appeared in 1810, in which he once again warns against rash political change.<h2>
<a name="Finalyearscharacterandreputation"></a>Final years, character, and reputation</h2>Williams's health had always been fragile, and during the final six years of his life he was dogged by &#145;a severe paraletic affliction&#146;  (BL, Royal Literary Fund, registered case file no. 335) and financial problems. Major strokes laid him low in 1809 and 1811. His sister Anne, wife of the Revd Walter Thomas, had died in 1809, and Williams was cared for in his declining years in Gerrard Street by his niece, Mary Watkins, daughter of Anne from a previous marriage. In July 1815 the Literary Fund voted their founder &pound;50 every six months. He died at his home, 36 Gerrard Street, on 29 June 1816 and was buried in St Anne's, Soho, on 6 July. Mary Watkins was voted &pound;50 after his death. His will bequeathed his manuscripts to his executors, the Revd Richard Yates and Thomas Whittingham, and his &#145;Bank annuities &hellip; furniture &amp; printed Books plate and Linen and all the residue of [his] Estate&#146; to his niece  (TNA: PRO, PROB 11.1582/411).<br>
<br>His contemporaries describe Williams as tall and slender (though in later years he was considered corpulent), with coiffeured and powdered hair and a languid gait. During his early years in London he seems to have dressed rather foppishly. The full-length 1774 portrait by J. F. Rigaud, now at the headquarters of the Royal Literary Fund at 3 Johnson's Court, London, shows a tall figure with an aquiline nose wearing a long blue gown over a dark suit and white shirt, with buckles on his shoes. James Boaden describes his &#145;placid countenance&#146; and the bright purple suit he wore later in life, &#145;which invested his really venerable figure&#146;  (Boaden, 1.lv). He was fair-complexioned and very short-sighted, and spoke without a Welsh accent in a voice that was considered mellifluous. In the introduction to his <span class="italic">History of Monmouthshire</span> he stated that he possessed &#145;so much knowledge of [Welsh], as to read, speak, and write, one of its dialects, with facility&#146;  (p. iv). His manner was polished but relaxed; he often seemed careless of his reputation. He was loyal and generous, but could also be querulous. He was known as a &#145;singular&#146; and maverick, and was ever a staunchly non-party man. His most original contributions lie in the field of religion, in his attempt &#145;to institutionalise and furnish with a liturgy a social and non-dogmatic religious philosophy&#146;  (Jones, 180); in political philosophy, as a thinker on political and social liberty and as a precursor of an organic approach to political theory; and in education, in his pioneering of an experiential pedagogic method. His lasting legacy is the Literary Fund, now the Royal Literary Fund, which continues to distribute funds to indigent authors.<br>
