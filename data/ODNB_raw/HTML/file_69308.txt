<span class="headword">Tildesley,  Miriam Louise</span>  (1883&#150;1979), <span class="occ">anthropologist</span>, was born on 1 July 1883 in Walsall Street, Willenhall, Staffordshire, the second daughter of William Henry Tildesley, curry-comb maker, and his wife, Rebecca, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Fisher. She was educated at King Edward's Grammar School for Girls, Aston, Birmingham (1894&#150;9) and at King Edward's High School for Girls, Birmingham (1899&#150;1902).<br>
<br>Tildesley's parents were reluctant to send her on to higher education, having done so for two of her sisters who went to Girton and to Newnham. From 1912 to 1914 she was trained as a teacher in north London, obtaining a National Froebel Union certificate. She spent three years teaching. Afterwards she was involved in wartime statistical work, under the aegis of Professor Karl Pearson, head of the department of applied statistics at University College, London. She took a six-month course in elementary statistical theory and practice. In 1918 she was appointed Crewdson Benington research student in craniometry, again under Pearson, who was also Galton professor of eugenics and head of the biometric laboratory at University College, London. A summary of her research work was published as &#145;A first study of a Burmese skull&#146; in <span class="italic">Biometrika</span> (12, 1921).<br>
<br>In 1920 Tildesley was appointed by the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research to work on the human osteological collections at the Hunterian Museum at the Royal College of Surgeons under Arthur Keith. In 1923 she was made a research assistant there in charge of the human osteological collection. Also in 1923 she produced her best-known work, &#145;Sir Thomas Browne: his skull, portraits and ancestry&#146; (originally in <span class="italic">Biometrika</span>, 15, 1&#150;76); it was also published separately with thirty-four plates and a pedigree. From this study of the disinterred skull of a seventeenth-century physician, she raised the possibility, already hinted at by similar work on the skull of Bentham, that there might be no connection between craniometric data and intelligence. Later she was appointed a curator of human osteology at the museum, and was chairman of the Comit&eacute; de Standardisation de la Technique Anthropologique during the 1930s. She wrote several articles about the anthropological and archaeological use of teeth, including &#145;Dentition as a measure of maturity&#146; (<span class="italic">British Dental Journal</span>, 1928, 1&#150;8). In 1939 she was elected a fellow of the Royal Anthropological Institute.<br>
<br>In 1921 Tildesley had obtained three months' leave from her anthropological work to make the first of several visits to Albania, her interest in which had been aroused by an American friend, Charles Telford Erickson, who had established a school of agriculture there. Later she took a leading role in the Friends of Albania Committee, established in August 1942 with the support of the deposed King Zog I. Latterly her interest in Albania was reflected in her academic work; for example &#145;The Albanian of the north and south&#146; (<span class="italic">Biometrika</span>, 25, 1930, 21&#150;9). She was appointed MBE for her services to anthropology.<br>
<br>Miriam Tildesley died, unmarried, on 31 January 1979 at Henley-on-Thames, Oxfordshire. She was cremated in Wolverhampton.<br>
