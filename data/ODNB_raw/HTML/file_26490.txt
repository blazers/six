<span class="headword">Stewart,  John</span> <span class="st"> [<em>known as </em>Lord John Stewart]</span>, Lord Darnley  (<em>c.</em>1531&#150;1563), <span class="occ">nobleman</span>, was the illegitimate son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/14591/', "King James V (1512&#150;1542)")</script> and Elizabeth (or Katherine), daughter of Sir John Carmichael. James had seven natural sons from a number of liaisons, and most of them were destined for the church from an early age; John, already proposed as a monastic superior in 1538, was in April 1541 given a large pension from Orkney diocese. On 16 August 1541, termed a clerk of St Andrews diocese and aged nine, he was provided as commendator of the Benedictine priory of Coldingham. He matriculated at St Andrews in 1545, then in July 1548 sailed to France with his young half-sister, Queen Mary, who was later to marry the dauphin. He studied at Paris until 1551 at least, possibly until 1553.<br>
<br>On 7 February 1551, before returning to Scotland, Stewart received crown legitimation, which removed most drawbacks of illegitimacy. His public career in Scotland now began, and he sat in the privy council from June 1553 and in parliament from April 1554, but little is known about him until the end of the decade. In 1560, when the Reformation crisis reached its climax, Stewart's position was equivocal. Said to be of the queen's party, which was pro-French and Catholic, and receiving letters from her, he yet co-operated with the pro-English protestant party: he joined in ratifying the treaty of Berwick of 22 February, whereby England gave military help, and in thanking Queen Elizabeth for this. He sat in the Reformation parliament of August 1560. Already in January 1560 he had been involved in military affairs round Coldingham, on the east coast near the border, and in August 1561 he was made captain of Dunbar Castle in the same region. In 1561 his tax of one-third, intended to benefit the crown and the reformed church, was remitted, on both his Orkney pension and his Coldingham revenues. During the revolt in the north-east in October 1562 he led a troop of forty horse on the government side. He was created Lord Darnley before 7 February 1563 and later that year he was in Inverness, where he died before 30 October.<br>
<br>When Mary returned to Scotland in August 1561, she and Stewart were clearly very close, despite her remaining a faithful Catholic while he had become a protestant. The reformer John Knox recorded Stewart's reception of the protestant sacrament and his protection of Mary's Catholic chaplain on the same day. Knox also strongly disapproved of his conduct, and indeed Stewart was (according to an English informant) a fun-loving, boisterous young man, which did not displease Mary, and at times rowdy. On 11 January 1562 Stewart married Lady Janet Hepburn, sister of the fourth earl of Bothwell, who was later to be Mary's husband. Mary attended the wedding at Crichton Castle and at the end of the year travelled to Dunbar to make merry with Stewart at hogmanay.<br>
<br>Stewart's status in the church requires assessment. Dispensed when still a child from the impediment of defect of birth to allow him to receive holy orders, and appointed to high-church office, he then received a fitting education. The same is true of his half-brothers: James, made commendator of Kelso and Melrose, who died before 1560, a younger <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26479/', "James Stewart")</script>, commendator of St Andrews, who was later the Regent Moray, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26504/', "Robert Stewart")</script>, commendator of Holyrood. It was hardly their choice, and most probably their father's principal motive in nominating them to Rome was financial: to receive the abbatial revenues himself during their minority and to provide for them in later life without cost to himself. Stewart's career in the later 1550s was mostly secular and he was known by the secular appellation of Lord John, though he sat in parliament and council as a spiritual lord, even after 1560. The date of his marriage is significant because, although never a monk, even as a commendator he was required to be in major holy orders and so could not contract valid marriage before 1560 in either canon or civil law. The date of birth of his illegitimate son is not known; his legitimate son <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/12999/', "Francis Stewart")</script>, who was probably born late in 1562, was commendator of Coldingham in 1565&#150;7, and in the 1580s was commendator again and created earl of Bothwell.<br>
