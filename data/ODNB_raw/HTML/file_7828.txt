<span class="headword">Doran,  John</span>  (1807&#150;1878), <span class="occ">writer and literary editor</span>, was born on 11 March 1807 in London, of Irish parentage. His father, John Doran, of Drogheda, co. Louth, left Ireland after the suppression of the rising in 1798, and settled in London, where he became a business contractor. In the course of his work he was captured by the French and detained in France for three years. He perfected his knowledge of the language, which he later passed on to his son, a precocious pupil who attended Matheson's academy in Margaret Street, off Cavendish Square, London. In 1819, aged twelve, the younger John Doran came first in French, geography, and elocution, winning a silver medal which was presented to him by the duke of Kent.<br>
<br>Before Doran was seventeen both his parents had died, forcing the youth to find employment. His excellent French immediately secured him an appointment as tutor to the first Lord Glenlyon's eldest son, George Murray, afterwards duke of Atholl. He also began to write: on 8 April 1824 his melodrama, <span class="italic">Justice, or, The Venetian Jew</span>, was produced at the Surrey Theatre, and he contributed to the London <span class="italic">Literary Chronicle</span>. Some of his Parisian sketches and Paris letters, written during his travels to Paris and other parts of the continent with his pupil, George Murray, appeared in <span class="italic">The Athenaeum</span> (into which the <span class="italic">Literary Chronicle</span> had been absorbed) in 1828, under the title &#145;Sketches and Reminiscences&#146;. From 1828 to 1837 Doran was tutor to Lord Rivers, and to the sons of Lord Harewood and of Lord Portman. After 1830 he contributed lyrical translations from French, German, Latin, and Italian to the <span class="italic">Bath Journal</span>. On 3 July 1834 he married Emma Mary Harrington, the daughter of Captain Richard Gilbert RN, at Reading, a town whose history he had been researching. His book, <span class="italic">The History and Antiquities of the Town and Borough of Reading, in Berkshire</span>, was published in both Reading and London in 1835. The Dorans lived briefly at Hay-a-Park Cottage, Knaresborough, until Doran gave up his last tutorship. He then travelled on the continent for two or three years with his &#145;young and pretty wife&#146;  (Frith, 2.265) and took his doctor's degree in the faculty of philosophy at the University of Marburg in Prussia, using his historical research on Reading.<br>
<br>After returning to England Doran adopted literature as his profession and settled in St Peter's Square, Hammersmith. In 1841 he became literary editor of the <span class="italic">Church and State Gazette</span>, receiving &pound;100 a year, and first came to public notice in 1852 for completing <span class="italic">Filia dolorosa</span>, a life of Marie Th&eacute;r&egrave;se Charlotte, duchesse d'Angoul&ecirc;me, left unfinished by the death of its chief author, Mrs Romer. In the same year he edited a new edition of Charles Anthon's text of the <span class="italic"><i>Anabasis</i></span> of Xenophon. In 1853 Doran prefixed a life of the poet the Revd Edward Young to a reissue of his <span class="italic">Night Thoughts</span>, and in 1854 rewrote his life for a new edition of Young's complete works. Reflecting on Young's line in &#145;Last Day&#146;: &#145;Man's is laborious happiness at best&#146;, Doran agreed. &#145;No doubt of it. Happiness comes by labour&#146;  (E. Young, <span class="italic">Night Thoughts</span>, 4th edn, 1864, lxiv).<br>
<br>Doran was now launched as a regular contributor to <span class="italic">The Athenaeum</span>. He became a friend of Hepworth Dixon, the editor, and during Dixon's absences acted as his substitute. Doran's first hugely successful book, <span class="italic">The Court of Fools</span> (1858), was dedicated to Dixon, &#145;In Friendly Homage from the Author&#146;. In 1854 Doran had published <span class="italic">Table Traits and Something on Them</span>, and <span class="italic">Habits and Men</span>, the latter being a history of dress and costume of men and women from the Peloponnesian War to Samuel Pepys, the son of a tailor. It must have been a labour of love, since Doran wrote: &#145;Under trial, next to trust in God, I do not know of any better anodyne, more potent balm, than literary occupation&#146;  (p. 290). He relished writing about royalty and high society, three books having preceded <span class="italic">The Court of Fools</span>: <span class="italic">The Queens of the House of Hanover</span> (1855), <span class="italic">Knights and their Days</span> (1856), and <span class="italic">Monarchs Retired from Business</span> (1857). <span class="italic">New Pictures and Old Panels</span>, published in 1859, lacked the style and verve of <span class="italic">The Court of Fools</span>, but boasted a portrait of the author engraved by Joseph Brown from a photograph. Doran is smartly dressed, with a jewelled tie-pin in his cravat and a friendly smile on his face; his signature ends with a flourish. Also in 1859 he became a member of the Society of Antiquaries of London, and in 1876 a member of its council. In 1860 he published his most elaborate work, <span class="italic">Their Majesties' Servants</span>, a historical account of the English stage from Thomas Betterton to Edmund Kean, of which a new edition was issued in 1887. Doran never lost his critical faculty; quoting Dr Johnson's famous judgement on David Garrick, &#145;His death eclipsed the gaiety of nations&#146;, Doran curtly dismissed it as &#145;nonsense&#146;  (p. 265).<br>
<br>After the retirement of William John Thoms, Doran succeeded him as editor of <span class="italic">Notes and Queries</span>. In 1873 he published <span class="italic">A Lady of the Last Century</span>, which concerned Mrs Elizabeth Montagu, whom he admired for her intelligence and wit. His next book, <span class="italic">Mann and Manners at the Court of Florence, 1740&#150;86</span> (1876), based upon the letters of Sir Horace Mann to Horace Walpole, was mainly editorial, but in 1877 he published the well-researched and engrossing <span class="italic">London in the Jacobite Times</span> (2 vols.). His conclusion was that after being a serious fact, Jacobitism became a sentiment which gradually died out  (2.411). Pressed to make a book out of his articles in <span class="italic">The Athenaeum</span> on towns which the British Association for the Advancement of Science had used for its meetings, he produced <span class="italic">Memories of our Great Towns</span>. It was typical Doran. Describing the marital adventures of Henry Cecil, first marquess, he observed: &#145;Reality, after all, is as wonderful as romance&#146;  (Doran, 165).<br>
<br>On 2 January 1878 Doran, apparently his customary, jovial self, took the corrected proofs of that book to the printer, but within two weeks he contracted pneumonia, and died at his home, 33 Lansdowne Road, Notting Hill, London, on 25 January 1878. He was buried on 29 January at Kensal Green cemetery. His wife survived him, as did a son, Alban Doran FRCS, and a daughter, Florence, who married Andreas Holtz. <span class="italic">Notes and Queries</span> described Doran as an &#145;accomplished gentleman and warm-hearted scholar&#146; and in April 1878 the president of the Society of Antiquaries referred to the &#145;kind and genial Dr. Doran, whose wonderful powers of memory made his conversations as sparkling as his writings&#146;  (<span class="italic">PRSA</span>, 1879, 384).<br>
