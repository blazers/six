<span class="headword">Halsted <span class="st"> [<em>married name </em>Atthill]</span>,  Caroline Amelia</span>  (1803/4&#150;1848), <span class="occ">historian and author</span>, was the daughter of John Halsted, a captain in the Royal Navy. She published her first work, <span class="italic">The Little Botanist, or, Steps to the Attainment of Botanical Knowledge</span>, in 1835. This was followed by <span class="italic">Investigations in a Boudoir</span> (1836), an unusual textbook in which a mother and her daughter conduct a domestic &#145;grand tour&#146; of their living room, investigating the origins and nature of the everyday objects around them. In 1839 Halsted turned to biography, publishing a <span class="italic">Life of Margaret Beaufort</span>, the mother of Henry VII. This work won her the Gresham commemoration prize for 1839, and was favourably reviewed in the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span>, where she was viewed as a worthy successor to Lucy Aikin. The reviewer commented that the biography was written with &#145;care, research, and ability&#146; and was &#145;far superior to some of the late histories by female hands&#146;  (<span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span>, 2nd ser., 12, 1839, 515). Later historians praised the biography for its recognition of Margaret Beaufort's political role and capacity, an aspect of her life neglected in preceding accounts, which had concentrated on her virtues as a patroness of religion and learning.<br>
<br>Halsted's next work was <span class="italic">Obligations of Literature to the Mothers of England</span> (1840), in which she enlarged upon a favourite theme, the importance of women's educative influence within the home for the development of English culture. This was awarded the Gresham commemoration prize for 1840. Her most significant work, however, was her <span class="italic">Life of Richard III</span>, a passionate defence of the character of the last Plantagenet king. Published in two bulky volumes in 1844, it was thoroughly researched and exhaustively argued. Building on the revisionist work of Sir George Buck, Horace Walpole, and Sharon Turner, the biography was based on a thorough knowledge of primary sources, and was the first account to make extensive use of Harleian MS 433, a register of Richard III's grants and writs. The portrait drawn of Richard as a <i>preux chevalier</i> was undeniably a romanticized one, but her rebuttal of many of the traditional charges levelled against the king&#151;including the murders of Henry VI, Edward, prince of Wales, and George, duke of Clarence&#151;was cogently argued. Examining the deaths of the princes in the tower, she decided that Richard's guilt was not proven. Many of her conclusions, including her recognition of the importance of Richard's authority in the north of England, have been confirmed by modern research. Contemporary reviewers were generally favourable: the critic of <span class="italic">The Athenaeum</span> gave her &#145;great credit for her laborious attempt to vindicate Richard's character&#146;, commenting on the &#145;patient care with which she has sought out, and marshalled her authorities&#146;  (<span class="italic">Athenaeum</span>, 10 August 1844, 731). The <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> was more critical, accusing her of &#145;an inclination for fine and sentimental writing&#146; and of paying too much deference to contemporary writers whose scholarship was inferior to her own  (<span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span>, 2nd ser., 22, 1844, 273).<br>
<br>On 8 June 1847, at Walmer in Kent, Caroline Halsted became the third wife of William Atthill (1807&#150;1884), subdean and canon of Middleham in Yorkshire, a collegiate church founded by Richard III. Their relationship seems to have begun in a scholarly exchange, when she lent some manuscripts to Atthill, who was editing <span class="italic">Documents Relating to the Foundation and Antiquities of the Collegiate Church of Middleham</span> (1847) for the Camden Society. She did not long survive the marriage, however, dying on 2 July 1848 at Middleham, aged forty-four. Continuing interest in the life and reign of Richard III means that fellow Ricardians keep Caroline Halsted's memory fresh; her <span class="italic">Richard III</span> was reprinted in 1977 by Alan Sutton.<br>
