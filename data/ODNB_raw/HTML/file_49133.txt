<span class="headword">Geach,  Charles</span>  (1808&#150;1854), <span class="occ">banker</span>, was born on 1 May 1808 probably in St Austell, Cornwall, and baptized there on 4 September. He was the sixth child and second son of George Geach (1772&#150;1850) and his wife, Grace, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Guichard (1776&#150;1839). Little is known of his early years, but at fifteen he left school and became a clerk with a draper in St Austell.<br>
<br>Geach's banking career began in 1826 when he was elected to a clerk's position at the Bank of England. This post was probably obtained through the influence of his maternal uncle, mayor of Penryn, Cornwall, and friend of the borough's MP, J. W. Freshfield, solicitor to the Bank of England. Another relative, an aunt, provided Geach with lodgings in Paddington. He made good progress in the bank and in 1828 he was chosen to go to Birmingham with Sir George Nicholls (1781&#150;1865) to establish a branch of the bank there. Working his way through the ranks in the new Birmingham branch, he became second inspector in 1831. His progress did not match his personal ambitions, however, as he later complained of the reluctance of the directors to promote to a high level those who had joined the bank at its lower levels. During these years he nevertheless acquired a thorough knowledge of both banking practice and the Birmingham business community. Geach married, in 1832, Eliza Lucy Skally (1816&#150;1876), the daughter of a schoolmaster in whose house he first lodged in Birmingham.<br>
<br>In 1836 Geach advised a group of manufacturers in Birmingham on the establishment of a new joint-stock bank, the Birmingham Town and District Bank. Against expectations, he was not offered the managership of the new bank. A second group of businessmen then approached him to form another bank and this time he was promised, and obtained, the position of manager. The confidence that the promoters of the bank had in Geach must have been considerable: he was only twenty-eight, had never managed a bank before, and would be faced with stiff rivalry from the Bank of England and other banking institutions operating in Birmingham. In his favour, he had established a reputation for outstanding ability, industry, and &#145;singularly agreeable good manners&#146;  (Edwards, 130).<br>
<br>The new Birmingham and Midland Bank (the Midland) opened for business in Union Street, Birmingham, on 22 August 1836. The first year was dominated by discussions with the Bank of England over the capital structure of Midland and about its relationship with the Bank. Geach shrewdly negotiated with his former masters to gain the best terms for Midland: in return for Midland circulating the Bank's notes rather than issuing its own, the Bank would give preferential rates. The decision to restructure the capital base of Midland in 1837 was a condition laid down by the Bank and was instrumental in its survival; many of Midland's contemporaries later collapsed due to inadequate capitalization. Midland's business was primarily of a commercial nature, especially the discounting of bills of exchange. Geach set strict rules as to the quality and security of bills that the bank would discount, and these measures prevented the young bank falling prey to bad debts.<br>
<br>As well as overseeing the financial basis of the new bank, Geach was also called upon to protect the physical security of the bank building. In 1839 during Birmingham's Bull Ring riots it seemed likely that an advancing mob would attack the bank. Geach mounted his staff on the roof, armed with missiles, and himself rode through the mob to fetch support from the barracks.<br>
<br>Geach's own business affairs were characterized by the same shrewdness and courage that had made Midland a success. In 1838 he led a group of Birmingham businessmen in purchasing the patents and works of an iron-axle manufacturer in Wednesbury. The company was reconstructed and in 1844 Geach bought out his partners. In the railway boom that followed the Patent Shaft and Axle Tree Company was transformed by the increase in demand from a small-scale operation to a large and thriving business. Similarly, in 1842 Geach bought the Parkgate Company, a failing iron manufacturing business in Rotherham. When iron prices were driven up two years later due to the demand for iron rails, the new company benefited. Geach was also an active promoter and director of the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway, and of the Shrewsbury and Birmingham Railway.<br>
<br>Geach was a Liberal, and his entry into politics coincided with the agitation for the repeal of the corn laws, with which he was heavily involved. He became an alderman of the Birmingham corporation in 1844 and mayor in 1847, his main contribution being an overhaul in the corporation's accounts and bookkeeping procedures. His civic duties forced him to resign as manager of Midland in 1847. Although relieved of responsibility for the day-to-day running of the bank, he joined the board as managing director, and thus retained an executive role. In 1851, following nomination by the National Parliamentary and Financial Reform Association, he was elected MP for Coventry. He seldom spoke in parliament, but was acknowledged as an authority on financial matters. On his election the family, including the six children, moved to Park Street, Westminster. However, Geach's parliamentary career was to be short-lived, as he died at home on 1 November 1854, after a short illness. The cause of death was stated to be a combination of chronic physical disorders, and the after-effects of a kick from a hansom cab horse. He was buried in Kensal Green cemetery.<br>
