<span class="headword">Wesham,  Roger  of</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1257), <span class="occ">bishop of Coventry and Lichfield</span>, probably derived his name from Weasenham, Norfolk. A close associate of Grosseteste, Wesham was educated in Oxford and had graduated MA by 1233. In that year he became prebendary of Elstow, Bedfordshire, and may have held this benefice until 1235&#150;6. Still a deacon, he was admitted rector of Walgrave, Northamptonshire, on 21 March 1234, but held this cure only until some time in the following year, presumably because he was pursuing a teaching career in Oxford, where he was third secular lector in theology to the Franciscan convent (1235&#150;40). This would have required the holding of benefices without cure of souls. Probably in May 1237 he became archdeacon of Oxford, an office he held until some time between 17 June and 13 July 1240. On the authority of Le Neve it is said that he was concurrently archdeacon of Rochester (from 1238), but this is unlikely, and probably the consequence of confusion with a man of the same name who was both chancellor of Oxford and archdeacon of Rochester. He held the prebend of Weldland in St Paul's for a time between 1229 and 1248, but this was probably concurrent with his next office, the deanery of Lincoln, to which he had been appointed by Grosseteste following the chapter's refusal to elect a successor to Master William of Thornac', who had resigned and become a Cistercian at Louth Park in 1239&#150;40. Wesham is first recorded as dean on 21 August 1240. In that office he became embroiled in the litigious struggle between his chapter and Grosseteste concerning the latter's right of visitation, a contest that shifted to the papal court at Lyons. The subsequent settlement, almost entirely in Grosseteste's favour, led to charges of Wesham's having betrayed the chapter. However, before this, Wesham had been provided, on Grosseteste's recommendation, to the see of Coventry and Lichfield, following yet another disputed election. Consecration by the pope occurred between 17 May and 4 July 1245, but Wesham did not receive the temporalities until 25 March 1246, which probably reflected the king's anger at his not being consulted.<br>
<br>It is hard to assess Wesham's conduct of diocesan affairs, since neither registers nor rolls were as yet kept at Lichfield. Given Wesham's close links with Grosseteste, who did keep rolls at Lincoln, this is perhaps surprising. What evidence there is suggests his engagement with the affairs of his diocese was real. As might be expected, he gathered learned men around him, for instance the Franciscan Brother Vincent, John of Basingstoke, a noted scholar of Greek, and Ralph of Sempringham, chancellor of Oxford University in the early 1250s. He arbitrated carefully in a dispute between Haughmond and Ranton abbeys concerning jurisdiction in 1247; he was careful about the endowment of Hillmorton, Warwickshire. In 1252 he issued thirty-five visitation articles, touching on every aspect of church discipline. He also prepared the <span class="italic">Instituta</span>, a document instructing his clergy in dogma and suggesting topics for sermons in the vernacular. At Lichfield he augmented the income of the senior archdeaconry, that of Chester, by annexing to it the prebend of Bolton, as well as founding the prebends of Bubbenhall and Ryton, and endowing a chantry to benefit the bishops of Lincoln and Lichfield and the deans of Lincoln.<br>
<br>By 1253 Wesham was already ill, for on 7 August 1253 he was granted a faculty to appoint a coadjutor by reason of infirmity by Pope Innocent IV (<i>r</i>. 1243&#150;54). In 1256 he was stricken with paralysis and sought permission from Alexander IV (<i>r</i>. 1254&#150;61) to resign his office. Henry of Lexinton, bishop of Lincoln (<i>d</i>. 1258), was appointed to receive his resignation, which he did at the episcopal manor of Brewood, Staffordshire, to which Wesham had retired, on 4 December 1256. He lingered there until Sunday 21 May 1257, when he died. He was buried on the following Tuesday at Lichfield, with Fulk of Sandford (<i>d</i>. 1271), archbishop of Dublin, officiating.<br>
