<span class="headword">Landor,  Robert Eyres</span>  (1781&#150;1869), <span class="occ">writer</span>, the youngest brother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15980/', "Walter Savage Landor")</script>, was born on 10 May 1781 in Warwick, near the east gate, the sixth of seven children of Walter Landor (1733&#150;1805), a physician and country gentleman, and his second wife, Elizabeth (1743&#150;1829), daughter of Charles Savage, a Warwickshire landowner. He attended Bromsgrove School, Worcestershire, until 1797 and, from that year, Worcester College, Oxford, where he graduated BA in 1801 and MA in 1802, and also held a fellowship.<br>
<br>Ordained in 1804, Landor was a curate at Wyke Regis in Dorset for the first part of 1805, but for the next decade his occupation and residence are unknown, except that he spent some time as a curate at Stockton in Warwickshire in 1813. In 1815 and 1816 he travelled with his brother Walter in France and Italy. From 1817 until 1824 or 1825, he was vicar of St Michael's at Hughenden in Buckinghamshire, and he was also briefly chaplain to the prince regent. He may have lived in Tenby in Wales for a few years after leaving Hughenden. He then moved to Birlingham in south Worcestershire, where he was rector of St James's Church in Nafford parish from 1829 until his death forty years later.<br>
<br>Originally close to his brother Walter&#151;he helped him edit the second edition of his poem <span class="italic">Gebir</span> in 1803&#151;he quarrelled with him in 1820 over money matters, and the two did not speak for twenty years.<br>
<br>Landor wrote in several genres, producing four closet dramas, two novels, one long poem, and a series of political letters on the trial of Queen Caroline. In 1824 his verse play <span class="italic">The Count Arezzi</span> won praise for its poetical language and its originality, and it sold well until Landor announced that, contrary to rumour, Lord Byron was not the author. In 1828 Landor published the narrative poem <span class="italic">The Impious Feast</span>, which was criticized for mixing romance with a biblical subject. The poem is also notable for combining rhyme with blank verse. His novel <span class="italic">The Fountain of Arethusa</span> (1848), in which two modern-day explorers engage in a series of dialogues with the ghosts of ancient Greeks and Romans, in some way resembles his brother's <span class="italic">Imaginary Conversations</span>, and in general, critics have noted a &#145;remarkable family likeness&#146; in the writing styles of the two Landors  (Saintsbury, 229).<br>
<br>Robert Landor was not well known even in his own day, and afterwards was almost totally forgotten&#151;unjustly so, according to one of his biographers, who praises his originality, his &#145;moral nobility&#146;, and his elegant prose style  (Partridge, 104, 103, 81&#150;4).<br>
<br>Landor's personality has been variously described as ebullient and crusty (Super, 133; Elwin, 363). Although reclusive, he was, according to John Forster, &#145;a really brilliant talker&#146;  (Forster, 2.502). He had the same quick grey eyes as his brother Walter and resembled him in voice, but at 6 feet 2 inches was much taller. Landor died at Birlingham, Worcestershire, on 26 January 1869, leaving behind a collection of art works and a large library. He never married.<br>
