<span class="headword">Lofft,  Capell</span>  (1806&#150;1873), <span class="occ">classical scholar, poet, and writer</span>, fourth son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16930/', "Capel Lofft (1751&#150;1824)")</script>, and only son with his second wife, Sarah Watson, daughter of John Finch, was born on 9 March 1806 at Troston Hall, Suffolk. In 1814 he was placed on the foundation of Eton College, and from there proceeded in 1824 to King's College, Cambridge, where he became a fellow in 1827. Having obtained the Craven university scholarship&#151;the highest classical distinction open in those days to King's men&#151;in 1827, he graduated BA in 1829, MA in 1832. He was called to the bar of the Middle Temple in 1834, but never attained, if he sought, professional eminence. In October 1837 he vacated his fellowship by his marriage to Mary, daughter of William Anderson of Newnham House, Cambridge. They had two daughters, the elder of whom (wife of the Revd T. H. Irwin) was drowned, together with her only child, in a boating accident on Lake Geneva&#151;a calamity to which Lofft alludes in his preface to the second edition of <span class="italic">Ernest</span> (xxv).<br>
<br>In 1837 Lofft published anonymously his first literary undertaking, a mental autobiography with a didactic purpose, entitled <span class="italic">Self-formation, or, The history of an individual mind, intended as a guide for the intellect through difficulties to success, by a fellow of a college</span>. Harriet Martineau said that every parent of boys ought to read the book. Lofft's object is &#145;to show, as the result of his own proper and personal experience, that self-instruction is the one great end of rational education&#146;, and &#145;to point out how habits of thoughtfulness are to be formed&#146;. He extols religion as the very best way to foster intellectual and moral advancement, attributing the development of his own sense of religion to an excursion in Devon with the <span class="roman">Bible</span> as his only companion, and his subsequent perusal of William Law's <span class="italic">Serious Call to a Devout and Holy Life</span>. After his marriage Lofft resided for a short time in London, but a roving life was more to his taste, and he spent most of his time on the continent, where the strong liberal principles which he inherited from his father and visions of social perfectibility led him into the society of some of the chief radical figures of the time. His next publication, likewise anonymous, was an epic poem in twelve books, <span class="italic">Ernest</span>, dedicated to the memory of Milton, and printed for the author in 1839. It was soon withdrawn from circulation. The poem embodies a German tradition of Ernest, a parallel to the Welsh one of Arthur, both of whom are to return and reign and fulfil other patriot prophecies. It represents the growth, struggles, and triumph of Chartism. H. H. Milman, when noticing the poem in the <span class="italic">Quarterly Review</span> (December 1839), expressed the highest admiration of the genius of the unknown author, but condemned the work as wildly inconsistent and lawless in its style and object. A second edition was published in 1868 with the title <span class="italic">Ernest, the Rule of Right</span>. In the preface the author complained of the unreadiness of the English people to support the Chartist movement.<br>
<br>Lofft was in America during the civil war, and while living in Minnesota prepared an edition of the <span class="italic">Self-Communion</span> of Marcus Antoninus, with critical notes to the Greek text. The title ran <span class="italic"><i>Markou &hellip; Ta es heauton Ant&#333;ninou</i> sive ad seipsum commentarii morales. Recensuit, denuo ordinavit, expurgavit, restituit, notis illustravit &hellip; C. L. Porcher, N. Eboraci U.S., <span class="smallcap">A.D.</span> 1861. A. liberatae reip. l.</span>. Despite its eccentricity, some of Lofft's emendations have been accepted by more recent editors. In 1868 Lofft published in London <span class="italic">New Testament: suggestions for reformation of Greek text from the self-conferred papal dictatorship and blind obstructiveness of mediaeval monkish copyists, on principles of logical criticism, by R. E. Storer</span> (that is, Restorer).<br>
<br>In his old age Lofft abandoned the radicalism of his youth and purchased two considerable estates, one in Sussex, and the other, called Millmead, in Amelia county, Virginia, USA. He died at Millmead on 1 October 1873.<br>
