<span class="headword">Baggerley,  Humphrey</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1648&#150;1654), <span class="occ">army officer and supposed biographer</span>, was among the troops who on 9 October 1648 surrendered at Appleby, Westmorland, to superior parliamentarian forces under Colonel Assheton. The royalist soldiers were granted very generous terms and, having been allowed his freedom, Baggerley probably travelled directly to the Isle of Man in the company of Sir Thomas Tyldesley. On 12 August 1651 he supervised the embarkation of the invasion force of James Stanley, seventh earl of Derby, from Castletown harbour, and&#151;despite contrary winds&#151;effected a landing on the Lancashire coast, at Preesall Sands, three days later. It seems more than likely that he fought at the disastrous battle of Wigan Lane on 25 August 1651, and that he was among the &#145;4 Captains&#146; taken there, following the royalist rout  (Lilburne, 3). He was certainly held prisoner at Chester Castle but doubt arises as to whether he was the same gentleman who, on 13 October 1651, was given permission by the authorities to attend the earl after a court martial had passed a sentence of death upon him.<br>
<br>A detailed, highly partisan, and emotive account of the last three days of Derby's life exists, and is credited to the &#145;Rev. Humphrey Baggerley&#146;  (Seacome, 120&#150;28). It is probable that the editor of these papers wrongly attributed them. However, it is just conceivable that there were two entirely different individuals who shared the same name; or that Baggerley was ordained after the Restoration (Draper, 217&#150;18; Ormerod, 2.196, 316, 338). The author of the account was clearly closely connected to the Stanley household, knew the Manx clergy well, and provided the earl of Derby with companionship and spiritual solace on his journey to execution at the market square in Bolton on 15 October 1651. Before the axe fell he was entrusted with delivering the earl's last letter to his wife, who still held the Isle of Man for the king, and with returning his Order of the Garter to his son and heir. Nothing more is known of the &#145;Reverend&#146; Humphrey Baggerley, but his military namesake was implicated in John Gerard's plot, of May 1654, to murder Oliver Cromwell.<br>
<br>The sudden decision of the lord protector, on Saturday 14 May, to abandon his normal routine and take a barge&#151;instead of a coach&#151;to his residence at Hampton Court caused the assassination attempt to be aborted and threw the plotters into confusion. Baggerley fled the City and went into hiding in Highgate village, but he was apprehended on 21 May 1654 and was escorted back to London under heavy guard. Charged with high treason, he was kept under especially &#145;close custody&#146; in the Tower of London throughout the summer months. On 7 August 1654 he pleaded his innocence, complained that prison life was ruining his health, and urged that the authorities should quickly decide whether or not to try, acquit, or release him. His petition to the lord protector seems to have been heeded, for on 1 September 1654 he was banished from the land on giving his word that he would not &#145;act to the State's prejudice, nor return without leave&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1654</i>, 353). Thereafter he disappears from the records and returns to the obscurity which shrouds both his actions as a royalist agent and the claims to his authorship of a significant work of cavalier hagiography.<br>
