<span class="headword">McCormick,  Robert</span>  (1800&#150;1890), <span class="occ">naval surgeon, explorer, and naturalist</span>, born at Runham, near Great Yarmouth, Norfolk, on 22 July 1800, was the only son of Robert McCormick (<i>d</i>. 1817), surgeon in the navy, son of Robert McCormick of Ballyreagh, co. Tyrone, where the family had been settled for several generations. He spent his childhood near Great Yarmouth, and was educated by his mother and sisters. Despite his father's death in the wreck of the <i>Defense</i> in December 1817, he decided to become a naval surgeon. He studied medicine in 1821, under Sir Astley Cooper, at Guy's and St Thomas's hospitals in London; on 6 December 1822 became a member of the Royal College of Surgeons; and in 1823 entered the navy as an assistant surgeon. He was sent out to the West Indies, where he remained for two years, seeing most of the islands and the coast of the Spanish main. In the summer of 1825 he was invalided home with yellow fever, and, after a year in a cutter in the North Sea, volunteered for Arctic service with William Edward Parry, with whom he sailed in the <i>Hecla</i>, in the expedition to the north of Spitsbergen in the summer of 1827. He took no part in the sledging expeditions, but contributed by keeping the crew healthy and by studying the natural history of Spitsbergen. On his return he was promoted surgeon on 27 November 1827.<br>
<br>Two years later McCormick was again sent out to the West Indies, very much against his will, and within three months he was invalided home. His next appointment was to a surveying brig on the coast of Brazil. That, too, he found uncomfortable, and got superseded after a few months. In 1828 he was appointed to a sloop employed for some time in the blockade of the coast of Holland. Early the next year she was sent out to the West Indies, and McCormick, with a rooted dislike to the station, and especially in a small craft, was invalided home for a third time. He was now on half pay for upwards of four years, and in the intervals of study made many excursions on foot through England and Wales, travelling some 3440 miles, and pursuing his favourite studies of geology and natural history. In 1839 he was appointed, as much in the capacity of naturalist as surgeon, to the <i>Terror</i>, then going on a voyage to the Antarctic, under the command of Captain James Clark Ross. He worked on all branches of science, although his zoological findings were published only considerably later, by John Gray and Sir John Richardson on orders from the Admiralty, after the task had remained undone for some time after the expedition; McCormick apparently lacked the necessary ability.<br>
<br>When the expedition returned to England, in the autumn of 1843, McCormick was disappointed of promotion. In September 1845 he was appointed surgeon to the <i>William and Mary</i> yacht at Woolwich. He understood that this appointment was for life, or until promotion, and was very angry at being, after two years, moved to the <i>Fisgard</i>, the flagship attached to Woolwich Dockyard, from which he was superseded in December 1848. His next idea was to conduct a party in search of Sir John Franklin, and he laid before the Board of Admiralty a proposal to undertake such a search in small boats and sledges in Wellington Channel, the Boothia peninsula, and King William Island. Although his suggestions were soundly based, as McClintock was later to prove, the Admiralty dismissed his plan as dangerous. However, in 1852, while surgeon of the <i>North Star</i>, he was able to carry it out to some extent. In the <i>Forlorn Hope</i> he explored the Wellington Channel, covering 240 statute miles, mapping the east side of the channel, but finding no trace of Franklin. He afterwards published <span class="italic">Narrative of a Boat Expedition up the Wellington Channel in the Year 1852</span> (1854).<br>
<br>McCormick returned to England in the <i>Phoenix</i> in October 1853 and was awarded the Arctic medal in 1857. He had never ceased to urge on the Admiralty his claims for promotion, contending that his service with the Antarctic expedition was exceptional and ought to be exceptionally rewarded. The Admiralty at last promoted him, on 20 May 1859, to be deputy inspector of hospitals. He had, however, no employment, and in July 1865 he was put on the retired list, the Admiralty refusing him the honorary rank of inspector of hospitals. His friends, as well as himself, thought that he was badly used. He was a man of considerable ability, although lacking the single-mindedness of his successful scientific colleagues such as Hooker and Lyell; but in his relations with the Admiralty he was sadly wanting in tact. He disagreed with each of the medical directors-general of his time and in his avoidance of Caribbean duty was almost insubordinate. He died, unmarried, on 28 October 1890 at his home, Hecla Villa, 22 Ridgway Place, Wimbledon. The accounts of his several voyages and expeditions, together with a very detailed autobiography, were published as <span class="italic">Voyages of Discovery in the Arctic and Antarctic Seas and Round the World</span> (2 vols., 1884), but came too late to arouse much interest. As Robert Johnson has remarked, &#145;he thought it the harbinger of a distinguished future, but, in the event, the <i>Forlorn Hope</i> was his first, last and only command&#146;  (<span class="italic">DCB</span>). None the less, he is remembered in several place names in the Arctic and Antarctic.<br>
