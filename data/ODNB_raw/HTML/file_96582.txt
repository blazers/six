<span class="headword">Medawar <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Taylor]</span>,  Jean Shinglewood</span>, Lady Medawar  (1913&#150;2005), <span class="occ">campaigner for family planning</span>, was born the single survivor of twins on 7 February 1913 at 36 Earls Court Square, Kensington, London, the first of three surviving children of Charles Henry Shinglewood Taylor (1882&#150;1935), general practitioner, and his wife, Katherine Leslie, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Paton, who came from a family of cotton traders based in Liverpool and Washington, DC. She was brought up in Cambridge. Her father had a distinguished military record as a medical officer at Gallipoli. Her mother had been deaf since childhood and was described as reclusive yet suffering periods of hyperactivity. Jean's aunt, Mary (her mother's elder sister), had inherited a large part of the Paton cotton fortune, and was a dominant influence on Jean's family and her upbringing and paid for her schooling: middle-class Edwardian values were inculcated and adhered to. After attending Benenden School in Kent she won a scholarship to read zoology at Somerville College, Oxford, where Solly Zuckerman was her tutor. She graduated with a third-class degree in 1936.<br>
<br>At Oxford Jean Taylor met <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/40016/', "Peter Brian Medawar (1915&#150;1987)")</script>, a brilliant, good-looking zoology student, the Brazilian-born son of a Lebanese commercial agent and his English wife. Jean's declared intention to marry him evoked strong, prejudiced resistance: Peter had neither &#145;background&#146; nor money, and would not be received into society; her mother warned of the danger of having &#145;coloured&#146; babies; Aunt Mary stopped her personal allowance. They nevertheless married in Oxford on 27 February 1937, and during the war Jean kept house in Banbury Road, where the first of their four children was born. In the summer of 1940 a twin-engine bomber crashed into their neighbour's garden, a devastating experience for the whole family. The pilot survived with 60 per cent burns and Peter, who was then working in Howard Florey's laboratory, was asked to see the patient, to offer any bright ideas to save his life. He later admitted that this striking event turned him towards transplantation biology. That sudden change of academic direction permanently changed Jean's life too: until his illness in 1969 her husband's compulsive commitment to research in immunology and to science (which won him a Nobel prize in 1960 and a knighthood in 1965, besides many other honours) gave him relatively little time for his family. His promotion to professor at Birmingham in 1947 and University College, London, in 1951 brought Jean a busy social life among a rapidly expanding circle of scientists who came to work with him, and she undertook many foreign visits with him.<br>
<br>Following an insightful tour to Russia in 1955 Jean Medawar started work in a family planning clinic in Islington and subsequently as public relations officer for the Family Planning Association (FPA). She got to know Margaret Pyke, the chairwoman, and her son David Pyke, intimately, the latter a productive relationship that continued for more than forty years. On Margaret Pyke's death in 1967 Jean Medawar succeeded her as the second chairwoman of the FPA. Influenced by her friend Barbara Ward, she brought to the field a new emphasis on sustainable development, conservation, and population control in the face of &#145;the natural conspiracy in favour of fecundity&#146;  (P. Medawar and J. Medawar, <span class="italic">Aristotle to Zoos</span>, 1983, 218). Her primary message was that exponential population growth would cause overcrowding, drought, and starvation, that people had to act responsibly to control birth rates, and that this message had to be taught at all levels of society, starting with the children.<br>
<br>Jean Medawar had unusual skill in enlisting famous and influential supporters of the FPA. One vote of thanks began, &#145;As all of you know, Jean is remarkably good at letting other people get her own way&#146;  (private information). By 1967 she and David Pyke had set up the Margaret Pyke Centre for Training in Family Planning. In 1981 she founded Common Ground International, &#145;a group of leaders who work &hellip; towards keeping a balance between people and resources&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Guardian</span>, 10 May 2005), which hosted a major exhibition in the Natural History Museum. For <span class="italic">Lifeclass</span>, an audio-visual pack based on Ward's <span class="italic">Only One Earth</span> (1972), she quickly persuaded a galaxy of bishops, scientists, artists, and naturalists to back the project, and the commentary was spoken by Sir Peter Scott, David Bellamy, and David Attenborough. On a trip abroad, while planning an updated videotape for <span class="italic">Lifeclass</span>, she &#145;accidentally&#146; tripped over the outstretched legs of John Cleese, whom she then persuaded to support the production of the tape, and to appear as lead actor in it. She retired from the chair of the FPA in 1975.<br>
<br>In 1969 Peter Medawar suffered a physically incapacitating stroke, the first of several which eventually caused his death in 1987. For nineteen years she supported him and fought for him as he continued writing a series of seminal books and lectures on immunology and the philosophy of science. At international conferences and in their large circle of friends the pair were revered for their tenacious determination, he a tall figure, bent but dignified, she a graceful yet resilient helpmate, always clearing his path, organizing his transport, and helping him prepare and deliver his lectures. They both continued to enjoy the company of many leading intellectuals and musicians at their home in Hampstead and abroad. Together they wrote several publications, including <span class="italic">Aristotle to Zoos: a Philosophical Dictionary of Zoology</span> (1983). Jean Medawar described her life with Peter in her remarkable autobiography, <span class="italic">A Very Decided Preference</span> (1990), which complemented his own life history, <span class="italic">Memoir of a Thinking Radish</span> (1986). Together the stories described a rare personal and intellectual synergism. They were united by a conviction of the need for progress (a theme that recurred constantly in their writings) and a steadfast refusal to bow to adversity.<br>
<br>After her husband's death Jean Medawar continued to write, and in 2000 published, with David Pyke, <span class="italic">Hitler's Gift: Scientists Who Fled Nazi Germany</span>, which illustrated vividly the loss to Germany and gain to Britain and other countries that resulted from Hitler's antisemitic policies. She died at the Royal Free Hospital, Camden, London, on 3 May 2005, of bronchopneumonia following a stroke, and was survived by her four children (two sons and two daughters). She was buried at Alfriston churchyard, Sussex, on 17 May.<br>
