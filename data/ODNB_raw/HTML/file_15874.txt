<span class="headword">Laffan, Sir  Joseph  de Courcy</span>, baronet  (1786&#150;1848), <span class="occ">physician</span>, third son of Walter Laffan of Cashel, Ireland, and Eleonora, daughter and coheir of Richard de Courcy, a distant relative of the family of Kinsale, was born at Cashel on 8 May 1786. His eldest brother was Robert Laffan (<i>d</i>. 1833), Roman Catholic archbishop of Cashel, and Laffan himself was originally destined for the Roman Catholic priesthood, and studied at Maynooth College. He then proceeded to Edinburgh University and turned his attention to medicine. He graduated MD on 24 June 1808, and became a licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians in London on 22 December 1808. From then until 1812, he practised in London, in Orchard Street, Portman Square.<br>
<br>In October 1809 Laffan offered his services to the government on behalf of the fever-stricken troops lately returned from the Walcheren expedition. These were accepted, and the aptitude which Laffan showed for military practice led to his appointment in 1811 as physician to the forces, and later as assistant inspector of hospitals. He served in Spain and Portugal during the latter part of the Peninsular War, and he was eventually made physician-in-ordinary to the duke of Kent. At the end of the war Laffan stayed in Paris, and practised there with brilliant success until the desire for a more peaceful life led him to Rochester in Kent. In 1815 he married Jemima (<i>d</i>. 1839), daughter of Paul Pilcher of Rochester, and widow of Michael Symes, formerly English envoy at Ava, in Burma.<br>
<br>Laffan's successful treatment of an illness of the duke of York, brother to George IV, led to his being created a baronet by patent dated 15 March 1828. He was gentleman of the bedchamber to the lord lieutenant of Ireland in 1829, and in 1836 he was also created a knight of the Royal Guelphic Order.<br>
<br>After the death of his wife Laffan settled in Otham, Kent, having retired because of ill health. He died at Vichy in France on 7 July 1848; as he left no children the baronetcy became extinct. His body was returned to Rochester and interred there in a family vault in St Margaret's Church, also in 1848. Laffan devoted the greater part of his wealth to found a cancer ward for women in the Middlesex Hospital.<br>
