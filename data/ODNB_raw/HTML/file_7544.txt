<span class="headword">Desenfans,  Noel Joseph</span>  (1744&#150;1807), <span class="occ">art dealer</span>, was born at Avesnes-sur-Helpe, near St Quentin, France, in December 1744. Educated at the universities of Douai and Paris, he published the Rousseauesque <span class="italic">L'&eacute;l&egrave;ve de la nature</span> (1763), and a stage comedy. At Douai he met the future actor John Philip Kemble and Charles-Alexandre de Calonne, first minister of France in the 1780s and a noted collector. He settled in London as a language tutor in 1769; on 10 June 1776 he married Margaret Morris (1731&#150;1813), a wealthy woman and sister to Sir John Morris, bt, of Clasemont, Glamorgan.<br>
<br>Socially ambitious, financially secure, but inexperienced, Desenfans began picture dealing, and in 1784 he moved to a large house, 38 and 39 Charlotte Street, Portland Place (now demolished). He forged close links with Jean-Baptiste-Pierre Lebrun (1748&#150;1813) of Paris, a remarkable connoisseur and dealer, with whom he worked for over thirty years, and whose example he followed of using his private house to display his personal collection, preferring to seem a gentleman-dealer. He lavishly entertained the world of art and literature but not high society. About 1776 Desenfans &#145;adopted&#146; (informally) Peter Francis Bourgeois (1756&#150;1811), who had been abandoned by his Swiss watchmaker father, and who, although an indifferent painter, by the 1780s assisted Desenfans in his business.<br>
<br>Lebrun helped Desenfans to obtain major masterpieces such as Murillo's <span class="italic">Flower Girl</span> (<i>c</i>.1670), Poussin's <span class="italic">Triumph of David</span> (<i>c</i>.1631&#150;3; both from the Calonne collection), and Watteau's <span class="italic">Les plaisirs du bal</span> (<i>c</i>.1716&#150;17), all now in Dulwich Picture Gallery, London. Lebrun's paintings were sold by Desenfans privately or at auction, with proceeds divided equally between them. Desenfans became well known, if not well liked, and in 1790 Prince Michael Poniatowski, brother of Stanis&#322;aw August, king of Poland, asked him to abandon commerce so as to &#145;promote the progress of the fine arts in Poland&#146;  (Taylor). The king's tastes are reflected in the purchases made by Desenfans; Stanis&#322;aw wished to found a Polish national gallery in Warsaw, and appointed Desenfans consul-general of Poland in London.<br>
<br>There were rich pickings from the dispersal of French and Italian noble collections. Rembrandt's <span class="italic">A Young Man, perhaps the Artist's Son Titus</span> (1663; possibly from the Calonne collection), Veronese's <span class="italic">St Jerome and a Donor</span> (<i>c</i>.1580), Claude-Joseph Vernet's <span class="italic">Italian Landscape</span> (1738; from the Calonne collection), Raphael's <span class="italic">St Francis of Assisi</span> and <span class="italic">St Anthony of Padua</span> (1540&#150;45; from the Colonna altarpiece), and Rubens's <span class="italic">Venus, Mars, and Cupid</span> (<i>c</i>.1636&#150;8; both from the Orl&eacute;ans collection) were among the principal masterpieces Desenfans bought for the king and which are now at Dulwich. For in 1795 Poland was partitioned for the third time in twenty-two years, and Stanis&#322;aw abdicated. His death in 1798 extinguished any hope that Desenfans would be paid for the 180 paintings he had acquired for Poland, and three applications to the tsars for payment proved fruitless. Desenfans claimed to have spent &pound;9000 on paintings for Poland between 1790 and 1795, and to have given up other valuable business. He wrote <span class="italic">A Plan for Establishing a National Gallery</span> in 1799, proposing, unsuccessfully, that the British government should add his paintings to the British Museum's collection, as part of a more general campaign to establish a national gallery in London.<br>
<br>In February and March 1802 Desenfans held an auction of the &#145;Polish&#146; paintings at Skinner and Dyke, Berners Street, London, publishing a two-volume catalogue in which he extolled French connoisseurship and damned the mediocrity and jealousy of British dealers&#151;a foolish exercise which earned him lasting animosity. Many of the attributions were very optimistic and the sale was a failure. By 1803 Bourgeois seems to have taken over the running of Desenfans's affairs&#151;Desenfans now suffering from a nervous illness&#151;and added major works such as Guercino's <span class="italic">Woman Taken in Adultery</span> (<i>c</i>.1621) to the collection, which he wished to preserve intact. Desenfans died at his home in London on 8 July 1807; by his will of 8 October 1803 he bequeathed his property jointly to his widow and Bourgeois, but his paintings to Bourgeois only. His remains, later moved to Dulwich, were housed in a mausoleum designed by Sir John Soane and erected behind his Charlotte Street house. Although the will does not require that the collection of 350 paintings be kept together, Bourgeois knew of his friend's wishes and in his own will of 20 December 1810 bequeathed it to Mrs Desenfans on condition that it went to Dulwich College after her death. Soane designed the Dulwich Picture Gallery and a mausoleum within, which houses the remains of Mr and Mrs Desenfans and Sir Francis Bourgeois.<br>
