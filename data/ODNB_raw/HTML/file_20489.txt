<span class="headword">Ochino,  Bernardino</span>  (<em>c.</em>1487&#150;1564/5), <span class="occ">Capuchin friar and evangelical reformer</span>, was, according to his later writings, born in Siena about 1487, the son of a barber, Domenico Tommasini. He is said to have taken his name from the district of Oca (&#145;the goose&#146;).<h2>
<a name="Capuchinpreacher"></a>Capuchin preacher</h2>Few details are recorded of Ochino's early life, but he probably entered the Franciscan Observant order about 1503. The seventeenth-century Capuchin historian Zaccaria Boverio asserts that Ochino later studied medicine at Perugia, where he became a friend of the future Pope Clement VII, but this claim cannot be verified. During the early 1520s, however, Ochino played a prominent role in the negotiations which resulted in the division of the Tuscan province of the Franciscan Observants (1523); he subsequently assumed the leadership of the newly formed province of Siena. At this stage Ochino was closely allied with the order's controversial general, Paolo Pisotti, whom he represented on several missions to the provincial chapter of Venice in 1531&#150;2. Following Pisotti's removal from office in 1533, many of his former associates left the Franciscan Observants for the breakaway Capuchin order. Ochino was perhaps the best-known of the defectors, becoming a Capuchin some time in early 1534.<br>
<br>Ochino quickly emerged as a leading figure within the new order, partly on the strength of his links with Vittoria Colonna, one of the early Capuchins' most important patrons. At a chapter-general in November 1535 he was elected the order's first definitor, and on 3 June 1538 he succeeded Bernardino d'Asti as general (a position in which he was confirmed three years later). During the second half of the 1530s Ochino presided over the consolidation of the Capuchins' position in Italy, but his achievements in this regard were overshadowed by his growing reputation as a preacher. Between 1534 and 1542, his itinerary took in Naples, Perugia, Venice, Florence, Lucca, Siena, Ferrara, Bologna, and Palermo; there is evidence that city magistrates competed fiercely for his services. The impact of Ochino's oratory on listeners was by all accounts dramatic. His preaching in Naples during Lent 1536 prompted one observer, Gregorio Rosso, to remark that it was enough to make the stones weep.<br>
<br>It was during this first visit to Naples that Ochino became associated with the Spanish evangelical Juan de Vald&eacute;s and his followers. Although Ochino may first have encountered evangelical ideas some years earlier, via contacts with the Augustinian preachers Agostino Mainardi and Giulio da Milano, he seems to have been particularly attracted by Vald&eacute;s's syncretic approach, which combined a crypto-protestant understanding of justification with a spiritualism rooted in Franciscan tradition. Vald&eacute;s, for his part, seized on Ochino's preaching as an opportunity to communicate his ideas to a wider public. The papal protonotary Pietro Carnesecchi later testified that when he was in Naples Ochino used to receive notes from Vald&eacute;s on the evenings before he was due to preach, outlining the theme for the next day's sermon.<h2>
<a name="ThebreakwithCatholicism"></a>The break with Catholicism</h2>The timing of Ochino's break with Catholic orthodoxy is difficult to establish with any precision. He himself later claimed that by the time of his defection to the Capuchins he had already renounced the papacy. Unfortunately, while in Italy Ochino published relatively few works against which that statement can be measured. Of the hundreds of sermons that he preached during the late 1530s and early 1540s, for example, only fifteen survive. These were published in two main collections: the <span class="italic">Prediche nove</span>, a series of sermons dating from Easter 1539 and first printed in Venice in March 1541; and the collection known as the <span class="italic">Prediche lucchesi</span>, also published in 1541, of which a single copy survives in the British Library. Ochino may also be the author of an anonymous <span class="italic">Dialogo dil maestro e discepolo</span>, published in Asti in 1540, and of a short text included in the Spanish manuscript version of Vald&eacute;s's <span class="italic">110 Divine Considerations</span>. However, his best-known work of the period is a collection of dialogues, the <span class="italic">Dialogi sette</span>, first published by the Venetian printer Zoppino in 1540 (although some of the dialogues date back to 1536). The title page of the <span class="italic">Dialogi sette</span> features a woodcut illustration of Ochino, bearded and in the habit of his order, praying before a crucifix. Although neither the sermons nor the dialogues are overtly heterodox, both are characterized by an emphasis on the crucified Christ at the expense of other traditional devotions, and appear to teach a mild doctrine of justification by faith. When considering these writings, one must also bear in mind Ochino's later claim that, while in Italy, he had been forced to preach Christ &#145;masked&#146;, revealing the true extent of his differences with Rome only to a trusted few. There is independent evidence of Ochino's secret proselytizing activity in the testimony of the Anabaptist Pietro Manelfi, who reported that Ochino had supplied him with copies of works by Luther and Melanchthon.<br>
<br>In that context it is hardly surprising that doubts about Ochino's orthodoxy began to be voiced; at Easter 1539 he was forced to defend himself publicly against the allegation that he had denied the existence of purgatory. These charges gained new credibility when, while preaching in Venice during Lent 1542, Ochino condemned the continuing imprisonment of his fellow evangelical Giulio da Milano, who had been forced to make a public abjuration of heresy only a few months before. Ochino's comments were communicated to the curia, and in July he received a summons from Paul III to appear at Rome. At first he appeared intent on obeying, but in Florence he encountered Pietro Martire Vermigli, who persuaded him of the need for a decisive break with the Roman church. After discarding his clerical habit and informing Vittoria Colonna of his intentions (22 August), Ochino fled across the Alps to the safety of Morbegno in the Valtellina. From there he proceeded via Z&uuml;rich to Geneva, where he arrived towards the end of September 1542.<br>
<br>In Geneva Ochino was licensed to preach to the city's small Italian-speaking community, first at the chapel of the cardinal of Ostia in St Pierre and then at the church of St Gervais. In 1543 he married an exile from Lucca (she died in 1563, but her name is unknown), with whom he had at least six children. The eldest, Aurelia, who was born in Geneva, later married the Lucchese merchant Lorenzo Venturini. Ochino's very public apostasy had made him a target of Catholic polemicists, and during his first year in Geneva he was forced to issue a series of public defences of his actions (<span class="italic">Responsio ad Marcum Brixiensem</span>, <span class="italic">Responsio ad Mutium Justinopolitanum</span>, <span class="italic">Epistola alli Signori di Bal&igrave;a della citt&agrave; di Siena</span>, all 1543). Between October 1542 and August 1545 he also published seven short volumes of sermons in Italian; a short but trenchant attack on the papacy, the <span class="italic">Imagine di Antechristo</span>; and a commentary on <span class="roman">Romans</span> (<span class="italic">Espositione sopra la epistola di San Paolo alli Romani</span>). Like the other vernacular works published in the early years of his exile, all were clearly intended for an Italian readership. Most of the sermons, which set out Ochino's by now fully protestant understanding of faith, justification, and predestination, were later republished by Michael Isengrin in Basel as a two-volume edition of <span class="italic">Prediche</span>.<h2>
<a name="GermanyandEngland"></a>Germany and England</h2>In August 1545 Ochino left Geneva, perhaps in search of a more lucrative posting; there is no evidence to suggest that his decision was prompted by doctrinal or personal differences with Calvin, who in April 1543 had declared himself perfectly satisfied of Ochino's orthodoxy. After short stays in Basel and Strasbourg, Ochino was offered a preaching position by the city council of Augsburg, with an annual stipend of 200 gulden (December 1545). Here he published a second major commentary, the <span class="italic">Espositione sopra la epistola di Paolo a i Galati</span>, and a number of shorter devotional works, which appeared only in German (<span class="italic">Ain Gesprech der flaischlichen Vernunfft</span>; <span class="italic">Ain christliches sch&ouml;nes und tr&ouml;stliches Bett</span>; <span class="italic">Von der Hoffnung aines Christlichen gem&uuml;ts</span>). In Augsburg Ochino also had contacts with local followers of the radical reformer Kaspar Schwenckfeld, who were attracted by the spiritualist aspects of his theology. However, his stay in the city was short-lived: in January 1547 Augsburg was besieged by the army of Charles V, who demanded, among other things, that Ochino be surrendered into imperial custody. Accompanied by another Italian exile, Francesco Stancaro, he fled to Basel, where he was received at the home of the printer Johannes Oporinus. The Spanish evangelical Francisco de Enzinas (Dryander) attempted to obtain a position for Ochino in Z&uuml;rich, but these plans were superseded by an invitation from Thomas Cranmer to assist with the reformation of the English church. A similar offer was extended to Ochino's compatriot Vermigli, who accompanied him to London in November&#150;December 1547.<br>
<br>Ochino's activities in England are not particularly well documented. At first he lodged with Cranmer at Lambeth Palace, and in February 1548 the imperial ambassador Fran&ccedil;ois Van der Delft reported that he had begun preaching to London's Italian community. On 9 May that year he was appointed a prebendary of Canterbury, with an annual salary of 40 marks, although he remained resident in London. Shortly afterwards he secured Cranmer's backing for a plan to invite Wolfgang Musculus, another victim of the defeat of the Schmalkaldic League, to join the growing band of foreign theologians in England (the invitation was eventually declined). Ochino also cultivated links with the household of Princess Elizabeth; her manuscript translation into Latin of one of his Genevan sermons is held at the Bodleian Library. Ochino was one of several foreign theologians commissioned by Cranmer to write against the western rebellion in summer 1549. In the resulting &#145;Dialogus regis et populi&#146;, preserved among Cranmer's papers at Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, he evinces a certain amount of sympathy for the rebels' socio-economic grievances, but condemns their resistance to the reform of worship  (MS 340, 97&#150;108). Four editions of Ochino's sermons in English were also published during Edward VI's reign, in translations by Richard Argentine and Anne Cooke, later Lady Bacon. Better known is his <span class="italic">Tragoedie, or, Dialoge of the Uniuste Usurped Primacie of the Bishop of Rome</span>, which appeared in two variant editions, published before and after the fall of Protector Somerset in October 1549. This semi-dramatic work, which survives only in the English translation by Cranmer's chaplain John Ponet, attempts over the course of nine scenes to expose the doctrine of papal supremacy as a satanic strategy for the undermining of Christ's church, now thankfully restored to its pristine state in England by the reforms of the young Josiah (that is, Edward VI) and his father. In its structure and subject matter, the <span class="italic">Tragoedie</span> closely resembles the <span class="italic">Pammachius</span> of Thomas Kirchmeyer, which had been translated into English by Ochino's friend John Bale.<h2>
<a name="ReturntoSwitzerland"></a>Return to Switzerland</h2>Following Mary's restoration of Catholicism, Ochino, like his compatriot Vermigli, was obliged to return to the continent. Passing through Geneva in October 1553, he is reported to have condemned the execution of Michael Servetus, &#145;quae res eum reddidit invisum&#146;  (S. Castellio, <span class="italic">Contra libellum Calvini</span>, 1612, sig. A6<i>r</i>). Once again, Ochino took up temporary residence in Basel, where a third volume of his <span class="italic">Prediche</span> had appeared around 1550. This was now followed by the <span class="italic">Apologi</span> (1544), a collection of anecdotes satirizing Catholic doctrine and devotional practices, and the fourth volume of the <span class="italic">Prediche</span>. In June 1555 Ochino accepted an invitation from the Z&uuml;rich council to take up a position as minister to the community of evangelical exiles from Locarno that had settled in the city. While in Z&uuml;rich he published some of his most important theological works: the <span class="italic">Syncerae et verae doctrinae de coena domini defensio</span> (1556), a defence of the Swiss reformed doctrine of the eucharist against the Lutheran Joachim Westphal; the <span class="italic">Dialogo del purgatorio</span> (1556), in which a protestant &#145;Theodidatto&#146; successfully rebuts arguments for the existence of purgatory proposed by representatives of five different Catholic religious orders; <span class="italic">Il catechismo</span> (1561), written for the use of the Locarnese church; the <span class="italic">Disputa intorno alla presenza del corpo di Giesu Christo nel sacramento</span> (1561), a collection of sermons aimed mainly against the mass; a fifth volume of <span class="italic">Prediche</span> (1562); and the <span class="italic">Laberinti del libero o ver servo arbitrio</span> (1560), which tackled the thorny question of predestination. Of interest are Ochino's continuing links with English reformers such as John Jewel and Thomas Sampson; when the newly enthroned Elizabeth I enraged her bishops by insisting on retaining a crucifix in her private chapel, Sampson urged Ochino to use his influence with the queen to persuade her to remove the offending object. Ochino subsequently dedicated his <span class="italic">Laberinti</span> to Elizabeth, fondly recalling their earlier association.<br>
<br>Although Ochino initially enjoyed good relations with Z&uuml;rich's senior minister, Heinrich Bullinger (who had recommended his appointment), his later works suggest a growing disquiet with the theological drift of the Z&uuml;rich church, and an interest in the ideas of dissident thinkers such as Sebastian Castellio and Lelio Sozzini. The <span class="italic">Laberinti</span> and <span class="italic">Disputa</span>, in which Ochino followed Castellio in proposing that controversial questions (such as the relationship between divine predestination and the human will, and the mode of Christ's presence in the eucharist) be treated as adiaphora, caused some disquiet in orthodox reformed circles, but it was the unauthorized publication, in spring 1563, of Ochino's <span class="italic">Dialogi XXX</span> that brought matters to a head. The <span class="italic">Dialogi</span>, which were translated into Latin by Castellio, contained devastating criticisms of the reformed understanding of justification, the atonement, and the sacraments (mitigated only to the extent that they were voiced by Ochino's fictional antagonists). Some passages in dialogue 19 indicate that Ochino was familiar with Lelio Sozzini's antitrinitarian commentary on the prologue to <span class="roman">John's gospel</span>. However, it was dialogue 21, on polygamy, that gave most grounds for offence. When it was brought to Bullinger's attention by a group of Z&uuml;rich merchants, he felt that he had no choice but to recommend to the city council that Ochino be dismissed (22 November 1563).<h2>
<a name="Deathandinfluence"></a>Death and influence</h2>After being refused sanctuary in Basel and Mulhouse, Ochino spent the winter in Nuremberg, where he penned his final work, the autograph of which is held at the British Library  (Add. MS 28568). In this <span class="italic">Dialogo della prudenza humana</span> he denounced the inhumanity of the Z&uuml;rich theologians and magistrates, reiterating (this time openly) the criticisms of the reformed churches contained in the <span class="italic">Dialogi XXX</span>. In spring 1564 he left Nuremberg for Poland, where he was welcomed by members of the minor (antitrinitarian) church in Cracow. However, in August, the Polish king Sigismund II issued the edict of Parcz&oacute;w, expelling non-Catholic foreigners from the realm. Forced into exile once more, Ochino found a haven with the Anabaptist community headed by Niccol&ograve; Paruta at Slavkov (Austerlitz) in Moravia. It was there, while preparing to take up an invitation to preach in Transylvania, that he is believed to have died in late 1564 or early 1565.<br>
<br>In the century and a half following his death Ochino assumed an honoured place in antitrinitarian historiography, as one of the founding fathers of Socinianism. He was less favourably treated by his former colleagues in the mainstream reformed churches, for whom his &#145;betrayal&#146; represented an acute embarrassment. Josias Simler, in <span class="italic">De aeterno Dei filio</span> (1568), and Girolamo Zanchi, in <span class="italic">De tribus Elohim</span> (1572) denounced his views on the Trinity, while Theodore Beza published a refutation of the dialogue on polygamy  (<span class="italic">Tractatio de polygamia</span>, 1568). During the 1650s Ochino's works enjoyed something of a revival in England; <span class="italic">A Dialogue of Polygamy, Rendered into English by a Person of Quality</span> was published in London in 1657, and it has been suggested that Milton drew on the <span class="italic">Dialogi XXX</span> for his views on the Trinity and marriage. Ochino later attracted interest from Pierre Bayle and from the eighteenth-century German antiquarian Johann Georg Schelhorn, who published a manuscript, now lost, of the <span class="italic">Dialogo della prudenza humana</span>. Twentieth-century scholarship is divided over the extent of Ochino's differences with reformed orthodoxy&#151;exaggerated, perhaps, in the light of his expulsion from Z&uuml;rich&#151;but his career remains emblematic of the difficulties that many Italian evangelicals of the early modern period experienced in exile.<br>
