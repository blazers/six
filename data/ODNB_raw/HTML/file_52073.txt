<span class="headword">Tripp,  Kathleen</span> <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Kathe Loewenthal; <em>other married name </em>Kathe Dampf; <em>pseud. </em>Karen Gershon]</span>  (1923&#150;1993), <span class="occ">poet and writer</span>, was born on 29 August 1923 in Bielefeld, northern Germany, the younger child of Paul Loewenthal, a Jewish architect, and his wife.<br>
<br>Following Hitler's accession to power in 1933 and Nazi persecution of Jews, Kathe became aware of the religious heritage which her Liberal Jewish parents had largely shed. She and her sister also belonged to a Zionist youth club, which prepared them for agricultural life in British-mandated Palestine.<br>
<br>With Jewish life growing ever more precarious, the older daughter left for a kibbutz in Palestine. But Kathe was below the minimum age of seventeen. Her desperate parents put her on a <i>Kindertransport</i> train, under the British government approved programme of admitting 10,000 unaccompanied children from Germany.<br>
<br>Kathe arrived in Harwich on the second children's transport on 19 December 1938, aged fifteen, and was sent to Whittingehame Farm School in East Lothian, Scotland, a temporary agricultural training centre on the family estate of the earls of Balfour. An unsettled period followed, including a short-lived marriage to Walter Dampf. Kathe embraced religion, Zionism (expecting to go to Palestine), and educational ambition when she gained a scholarship to Edinburgh University.<br>
<br>In the event, Kathe worked in Leeds, in domestic service and office jobs, then as matron in progressive boarding-schools in Scotland, Kent, and Wales, where she met a gentile humanist art teacher, Cecil Valentine Marshall (Val) Tripp (<i>b</i>. 1919). They married on 6 March 1948 at Welton, Lincolnshire, and had two boys and two girls. Her marriage certificate records that she changed her name by deed poll to Kathleen.<br>
<br>In the months following the end of the Second World War Kathleen Tripp learned that her parents had died in a camp in the Latvian capital of Riga. It was a blow from which she never recovered.<br>
<br>In 1950 Kathleen Tripp settled in her husband's home area of Ilminster, Somerset, and started writing in English. Winning a local verse competition in 1950 gave her confidence in her adopted language. Her youthful poems had been published in a German-Jewish magazine, <span class="italic">Die J&uuml;dische Rundschau</span>, but her despairing mother had asked her how she could &#145;make poems in the language in which we are being cursed&#146;  (Gershon, &#145;Introduction&#146;, <span class="italic">Collected Poems</span>). Now, in a bleak but piercingly direct style, she wrote about the burden of bereavement, and the guilt of having survived her parents' fate.<br>
<br>Kathleen Tripp was keenly aware of her disjointed background: German which she now rejected, Jewish where her knowledge was too superficial to sustain inner certitude, and English where she felt merely tolerated&#151;&#145;just another bloody Jew&#146;  (interview, <span class="italic">Jewish Gazette</span>, March 1990). The pen-name she chose, Gershon, meaning &#145;a stranger there&#146;, from the name given by Moses to his son born in exile, pinpointed her dilemma. She was forty when her work was published by the left-leaning Victor Gollancz.<br>
<br>In December 1963, twenty-five years after fleeing Germany, Kathleen Tripp revisited Bielefeld. It was a pioneering pilgrimage in that era and an unnerving experience, as she slipped back immediately into feelings of rejection and helplessness. But she was shaken out of paralysis when she saw her father's name erased from the plaque on a building he had designed. Her complaints to the local newspaper led to a lengthy interview and stirred local interest in her, tempered&#151;as she noted&#151;by the townspeople's refusal to accept any responsibility for her family's fate.<br>
<br>Determined to re-examine her formative experiences, Kathleen Tripp appealed in newspaper correspondence columns for others who had arrived similarly in England. From these contacts, she formed a book, <span class="italic">We Came as Children</span> (1966), a collective autobiography with contributions from 234 anonymous former child refugees. The book opened an aspect of the war people were not yet ready to address and established Karen Gershon as a serious writer.<br>
<br>Gershon's first poetry publication, <span class="italic">Selected Poems</span>, came out simultaneously. It displayed all her recurrent themes: loss, longing, a sense of incompleteness, and the need to recreate a family. Her grief at the loss of her parents is poignantly expressed in &#145;I was not there to comfort them&#146;, which encapsulates her insatiable thirst in the line &#145;I must atone because I live.&#146; Revenge was absent.<br>
<br>The two books won Karen Gershon the 1967 Jewish Chronicle book prize and led to an Arts Council bursary and study grants from Israel and America. In August 1966, following publication, she was invited to Israel for a writers' symposium, and discovered she was not alone either as a Jew or in her psychological scars. The effect was liberating. On her next trip, after visiting Yad Vashem, the Jerusalem memorial museum, the closest she felt she could come to her parents' grave, she came to terms with her background as if she &#145;had been healed of a sickness&#146;  (<span class="italic">Jewish Chronicle</span>, 21 April 1967).<br>
<br>Her increasing emotional involvement led Kathleen Tripp to move with her family to Israel in 1969. She lectured and researched in holocaust literature, while her husband taught art. But six years later they returned to England, leaving two married children in Israel. Another child later also married in Israel.<br>
<br>Gershon was a prolific writer: her fifteen volumes included reportage (<span class="italic">Postscript</span>, 1969), poetry (<span class="italic">My Daughters, my Sisters</span>, 1975; <span class="italic">Coming back from Babylon</span>, 1979), semi-autobiography (<span class="italic">Bread of Exile</span>, 1985), and fiction (<span class="italic">The Fifth Generation</span>, 1987). She reviewed holocaust writers, gave poetry readings, including &#145;dial-a-poem&#146; telephone recordings, and took part in radio and television programmes.<br>
<br>Kathleen Tripp's unremitting focus on grief affected her family. Her husband (who survived her) resented her refusal to let go of the past and felt that his children had been alienated from their English heritage. Her children avoided her work which, in fact, lost some of its edge as her personality grew more integrated. She felt disappointment that her writing did not reach out to a wider audience but stayed confined to fellow sufferers. It was, however, her lifeline. She died in the London Chest Hospital, Bethnal Green, on 24 March 1993, aged sixty-nine. Her final poem, published as <span class="italic">Grace Notes</span> nearly ten years after her death, showed a coming to terms with ageing and a reconciliation with the passions of youth. Its illustration by her daughter Stella Tripp also testified to easier family relations.<br>
