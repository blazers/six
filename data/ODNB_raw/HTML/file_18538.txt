<span class="headword">Melton,  William</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1340), <span class="occ">archbishop of York</span>, was the son of undistinguished parents from Melton in the parish of Welton near Hull, where he later established a chantry for them. However, he had a brother named Henry, whose grandsons he sent to be educated in Newark at his own cost, and this family became established among the gentry of Yorkshire. In his youth Melton spent some time in the University of Oxford, but no details of this are known, although he continued to help the university financially. By 1297 he had entered royal service in Prince Edward's household, of which he later became controller. He was extensively beneficed, probably (and quite lawfully) to pay his salary during the period of his employment in the king's service, since he owed most of his advancement to royal patronage. He was rector of Reepham, Lincolnshire, from 1299 and of six other places at times thereafter, as well as being a prebendary of Southwell Minster and of Dublin, Lincoln, York, and Salisbury cathedrals. He also held a prebendal position in the royal free chapel in Hastings (1314) and was provost of Beverley (1309), dean of St Martin's-le-Grand (1308&#150;16), and archdeacon of Barnstaple (1308&#150;9). His principal patron was Edward II, for whom he seems to have had a genuine and lasting affection.<br>
<br>Melton's outstanding ability in finance led to his rapid advancement when Edward became king. Already in 1301 he had been responsible for paying the wages of the Welsh infantry enrolled in the prince's army. From 8 July 1307 to 18 September 1312 he was keeper of the privy seal, and from 8 July 1307 to 30 November 1314 treasurer of the wardrobe. In 1308 he accompanied the king to his wedding with Isabella of France, having temporary charge of the great seal, which he held again in 1310. In June 1308 he had witnessed the king's appointment of Gaveston as lieutenant of Ireland. He seems to have avoided committing himself either to the ordainers in 1312 or to the party of Thomas, earl of Lancaster, in 1322, again probably out of personal loyalty to the king, although he allowed his clergy to give an aid to Lancaster, and eventually, after some hesitation, supported the plea for the earl's canonization. In 1312 he was one of the proctors of the northern convocation that refused an aid to the king, but this was not held against him, for in the same year he was a commissioner to deal with the Cinque Ports, and in 1313, and again in 1319 and 1321, he was commissioned to treat with the Scots. In 1323 he was appointed to head a commission investigating abuses by commissioners of array in Nottinghamshire, while from 3 July 1325 to 14 November 1326 he was treasurer.<br>
<br>After Edward II's death Melton seems to have avoided royal appointments so far as he could. He did not attend Edward III's coronation, although he married the king to Philippa of Hainault in York Minster in 1328. In 1329 he was accused of complicity in Edmund of Woodstock's plot against Mortimer and Isabella, started in the belief that Edward II was still alive. He succeeded in clearing himself, and later was again treasurer (1330&#150;31) and temporary keeper of the great seal (1333&#150;4).<br>
<br>On 21 January 1316 Melton was through royal influence elected archbishop of York. He went to Avignon for his consecration, but despite repeated appeals from the king, this was delayed until 25 September 1317 by an interregnum in the papacy. On his return to England, Melton had his cross carried erect before him in Kent and London, to uphold the claims of the northern province against Canterbury, and on a later occasion seems to have imposed an interdict on any place where the archbishop of Canterbury trespassed with erect cross in the province of York, though an agreement was afterwards reached at the instance of the king. His relations with his suffragans were not always easy, and he once excommunicated Bishop Beaumont of Durham (<i>d</i>. 1333) for resisting his rights of visitation.<br>
<br>The years of Melton's tenure at York were greatly disrupted by Scottish invasions. Already in 1314 he had been empowered to raise money for the defence of the border, and after 1318 the raids of the Scots became more extensive and ferocious. They penetrated as far south as Preston and Boroughbridge, and exposed the archbishop himself to considerable danger in the course of his visitations. In 1319 a raid led by Sir James Douglas threatened York itself, and caused Melton to collect a scratch force of clerics and townsmen to resist the Scots at Myton-on-Swale. On 20 September he was heavily defeated and lost most of his army, with his armour, horses, and silver plate, but York did not fall. Between this date and the treaty of Edinburgh in 1328 Melton's province suffered more or less continuously from raids which left the country ravaged and the religious houses particularly impoverished. As late as 1339 the northern convocation was pleading poverty as an excuse for non-payment of taxation. His register also shows that Melton was heavily involved in the papal attempts to deal with Robert I. Repeated emissaries (often unfortunate friars) were sent north, either to publish Robert's excommunication or to urge him to a settlement, but these were invariably unsuccessful, either because of Robert's highly intelligent diplomacy or the terror inspired by his army.<br>
<br>There was also trouble from France, Scotland's traditional ally. During the War of St Sardos (1324&#150;6) Edward II ordered Melton to banish foreign incumbents of English livings to &#145;rather remote places&#146; where they could do no harm&#151;an order to which the archbishop replied that he could not find any such persons  (Hill and Robinson, 3, nos. 127&#150;8). Edward III charged Melton, among others, to summon the army to resist a French invasion in 1339.<br>
<br>Melton's personal reputation in the civil service stood high in an age of considerable corruption. In 1316 the king, in granting him a quitclaim for any responsibilities he had incurred, mentioned his &#145;good service and fidelity in converting to the King's profit all the money and other goods which fell into his hands and custody&#146;  (<span class="italic">CPR</span>, <i>1313&#150;17</i>, 432). T. F. Tout wrote that Melton &#145;preserved his reputation unblemished throughout a long life. Many years of court service did not corrupt his fidelity or diminish his piety and charity&#146;  (Tout, 21&#150;2). His practical knowledge of finance stood him in good stead as an archbishop. His register shows that, in a period when most officials were in debt, he was able to make extensive loans to the king, to the northern barons, and to poor religious houses, and even to the Italian banking house of Bardi, as well as building up his private estates. He contributed &pound;700 to the fund for rebuilding York Minster, and restored at his own expense the tomb of St William. Not surprisingly, he took particular care to check the credentials of pardoners and collectors for good causes, giving special encouragement to those whom he found responsible.<br>
<br>In his diocese Melton was remembered as a good man who lived honestly and chastely. His household noted his habit of early rising and assiduous attendance at divine service, and seem to have received new outfits from him twice a year. He was sparing to himself and generous to the poor, often forgiving debts when they were owed by the needy. He was particularly careful in carrying out visitations (often in considerable personal danger) and enforcing subsequent injunctions. He was thorough in performing all the normal duties of his office, maintaining good order and discipline in parishes and non-exempt religious houses, supervising clerical appointments, and granting licences, dispensations, and testimonials. He dealt with some exceptional problems, such as a heretical preacher who was upsetting his female congregations, and a man addicted to necromancy. He had also to deal with the reallocation of the templars, whose order was dissolved in 1312, to other religious houses, and the regular payment of their pensions, a process that seems to have caused both him and the templars much trouble and distress. He dealt very mercifully with Joan Picot, a widow from Wigan, whose husband had burdened her with unreasonable conditions and heavy debts. Melton seems to have spent the last years of his life at Cawood and died there on 5 April 1340, to the general grief of his people. When his tomb was excavated it was found that he had been a very tall man. He had been buried with his chalice and paten. The statue in the niche over the west door of the minster is said to represent him, but too much reliance cannot be placed on portraiture in stone at this period.<br>
