</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Munnings, Sir  Alfred James</span>  (1878&#150;1959), <span class="occ">artist</span>, was born on 8 October 1878 at Mill House, on the River Waveney, Mendham, Suffolk, the second of the four sons of the miller John Munnings (1839&#150;1914), who was the tenth child of a successful farmer, and his wife, Emily, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Ringer (1850&#150;1945), one of nine children of a local farmer.<h2>
<a name="Childhood"></a>Childhood</h2>His mother suffered frequent bouts of melancholia, a tendency which Munnings inherited together with her love of music, poetry, and nature. His boisterous and extrovert father gave public and family readings from the classics and nurtured his children on poetry and literature. Munnings inherited from him his rumbustious social nature, a love of words, a sense of showmanship, and an artistic talent. Living beside the river he was fascinated with the movement and colour of water which became a constant theme in his pictures and writings. But horses were his lifelong obsession. Great teams of shires brought corn to the mill and he learned the feel and scent of horses from an early age when he was put up in front of his father to ride. As he drove with his family through the countryside the movement of the grey mare drawing the trap held his attention far more than did the passing scenery. At the age of four his favourite toy was a wooden horse called Merrylegs, which his father taught him to draw. Because of his mother's illness he went to a dame's boarding-school for a few months when he was four. Afterwards he had a governess for three years until he went to the village school and then to Redenhall Commercial School, followed by four unhappy terms at Framlingham College. He was always drawing horses&#151;from memory or from his imagination&#151;and he demonstrated a remarkable talent which led his parents to send him to the local vicar's daughter for drawing lessons from the age of eight. At fourteen and a half Munnings was apprenticed for six years to Page Brothers, the Norwich lithographers, and for nine hours a day he created imaginative posters and advertisements. In the evenings he studied for two hours at the Norwich School of Art where his favourite model was the cast of a horse's head from the Parthenon. Early mentors were his headmaster, Walter Scott, who encouraged him to pursue art; James Reeve, curator of the Norwich Museum, who bought one of his early pictures for &pound;85; and Shaw Tomkins, manager of Caley's chocolate factory and one of Page Brothers' most important customers, who commissioned him to design posters and boxes and took him on business trips to Europe when he introduced him to fine art galleries and a lively social life. Tomkins also gave him his first commission&#151;a portrait of his father, Daniel Tomkins, sitting on a garden bench with his dog beside him.<h2>
<a name="Earlyworks"></a>Early works</h2>Alongside his escalating commercial work for many firms Munnings painted intensively and in ten years sold 110 pictures for up to &pound;100 each through the Norwich art circle. Often he paid a landlord with a small picture as part of his bill. In 1899 two of his small paintings, <span class="italic">Stranded</span> and <span class="italic">Pike-Fishing in January</span>, were accepted for the summer exhibition of the Royal Academy; he also showed a landscape at the Royal Institute of Painters in Water Colours. Some months later his career was interrupted when he was blinded in his right eye after it was accidentally pierced by a thorn. After weeks in a nursing home with both eyes bandaged he began a long struggle to overcome his lack of binocular vision. It was a permanent handicap which he rarely mentioned but, together with his recurrent gout, doubtless contributed to his explosive temper.<br>
<br>Handsome and gregarious, Munnings invariably became the life and soul of many parties in East Anglian public houses, and his lively travels with the Gypsies resulted in some of his finest paintings. He often stayed with friends in London, revelling in a hectic social life, and at twenty-four spent the first of several periods of study at the Acad&eacute;mie Julian in Paris. East Anglia remained his favourite place to paint, and for several summers he travelled there with a caravan of his own horses managed by a scruffy young handler called Shrimp, who became a frequent model. They parted when Munnings joined the group of painters at Newlyn in Cornwall and became the focus of a social group including Dame Laura Knight, her husband Harold Knight, (S. J.) Lamorna Birch, and Stanhope Forbes. There he met Florence Carter Wood (1888&#150;1914), a brilliant young horsewoman and painter ten years his junior who came from a wealthy family. He probably fell in love with her when he saw her riding side-saddle, her habit flowing over the horse's back giving the centaur-like impression that horse and rider were one. (It was a potent image which he used to portray his wife.) Despite opposition from her parents they married on 19 January 1912; she attempted suicide on their honeymoon and succeeded two and a half years later. Her death apparently had little effect on Munnings's work, whose subjects then included the hop-pickers in Hampshire, horses and Gypsies, country-race meetings, hunting scenes, and a tender romantic portrait of a young girl which formed the basis of an academy painting entitled <span class="italic">Evelyn</span>. He was a fast painter and averaged thirty to forty medium-sized or large canvases a year in addition to the many watercolour sketches and small canvases invariably produced as preliminaries to his large works.<br>
<br>In 1914 Munnings volunteered for the army but was rejected three times because of the lack of sight in his eye. In desperation he became a scrapper in 1917, scratching the necks of Canadian soldiers' horses to look for mange, until in 1918 he was appointed civilian official war artist to the Canadian cavalry in France. His dramatic paintings of troops in action and lumberjacks working in the forests, and a fine equestrian portrait of General J. E. B. Seely (later Lord Mottistone), were exhibited at the Royal Academy. The portrait elicited a stream of lucrative and prestigious commissions from sitters, including the amateur steeplechase jockey Lord Mildmay on Davy Jones; the prince of Wales; Lord Harewood; the princess royal; and Lord Birkenhead, lord chancellor of England, which Munnings rated as about his best portrait of a man on horseback.<br>
<br>In 1918 he was elected an associate of the Royal Academy and, from his first London studio in Glebe Place, pursued an exciting social life. He felt financially secure when James Connell &amp; Sons of Old Bond Street bought his three academy pictures and all his Cornish Gypsy and horse paintings at his own price. &#145;I was a millionaire &hellip; I'd care for nobody&#146;, he boasted in defiance of his early insecurity and failed marriage. The Chelsea Arts Club became his second home until his foul language, in which he could curse for ten minutes without repeating himself, resulted in his temporary suspension. He joined the Arts Club, the Royal Academy Dining Club, and the Garrick Club, where he revelled in reciting his sixty-verse &#145;Ballad of Anthony Bell&#146; and John Masefield's &#145;Reynard the Fox&#146; which the poet had asked him to illustrate. He similarly entertained at the Caf&eacute; Royal and at the many great houses in which he stayed between the wars to portray the owners and their horses and hounds. In the evenings he would play the piano and compose poems about the assembled company.<h2>
<a name="Sculpture"></a>Sculpture</h2>Munnings's first attempt at sculpture (for which he received no formal training), made at the instigation of a young sculptor friend, Whitney-Smith, had been a small statuette of his mare Augereau. In Newlyn an artist friend, Charles Simpson, later commented that his painting represented the furthest limits to which a picture could go in approaching the art of the sculptor. This aspect of his paintings was the outcome of a protracted study of anatomy partly based on George Stubbs's <span class="italic">Anatomy of the Horse</span> (1766) and also on visits to the stables of a local veterinary surgeon. His horse studies always reflected, over that of other equestrian painters, his unparalleled love and understanding of the animals' characters. His sculpting ability was recognized in 1919 when his friend Sir Edwin Lutyens, who considered that his horse paintings showed a sculptor's grasp of essential form, invited him to sculpt a bronze statuette of a young cavalry officer on horseback, Edward Horner, who was killed in the war, for a memorial in Mells church, Somerset, commissioned by his parents, Sir John and Lady Horner. This led twelve years later to a commission for a sculpture of the famous racehorse Brown Jack, a bronze statuette of which was placed in the royal enclosure at Ascot.<h2>
<a name="Majorcommissions"></a>Major commissions</h2>In 1919 Munnings bought the house of his dreams&#151;as he called Castle House, Dedham, Essex&#151;an elegant Georgian house with 40 acres of grounds on which he built a studio and kept horses to ride, hunt, and paint. A year later he married a young divorcee, Violet McBride (<i>b</i>. 1885), who was a fine horsewoman and the daughter of a London riding master, Frank Golby Haines. As with Florence, he had been completely captivated by seeing her riding side-saddle on a magnificent horse, looking as if horse and rider were one. Seven years his junior, she took over all their domestic and financial affairs, leaving him free to paint. She encouraged him, often against his will, to accept many commissions from wealthy society figures rather than leaving him free to paint the country scenes he loved and which came to be seen as his best works. &#145;He was never such a good artist after he married me&#146;, she admitted. &#145;It meant painting for money.&#146; But the commissions enabled him to keep his thirty-four horses. Munnings wrote to her daily when he was away from home; she never curtailed his club life nor complained about his solitary painting expeditions. It was a childless marriage in which she surrounded herself with dogs. He gave her power of attorney so he need never enter a bank again, asked her for money when he needed it, and maintained an illusion of independence by hiding pound notes between the pages of books in his library. She was a favourite equestrian model of his.<br>
<br>Munnings travelled abroad: to paint Robert de Rothschild's family at Chantilly; to judge an international art exhibition at Pittsburgh, where he was exhausted by painting too many millionaires; to Spain, where he was revolted by the use of horses in the bullring; and to Ireland, from where his study of <span class="italic">Kilkenny Horse Fair</span> was accepted as his diploma work when he was elected Royal Academician in 1925.<br>
<br>Severe gout made Munnings increasingly irritable and he had frequent mood swings. He gradually abandoned painting in watercolour because he felt its immediacy interrupted his work on large oils such as <span class="italic">The Ascot Procession Crossing Windsor Park</span>, painted at the invitation of Queen Mary. Bought for the Royal Collection, it hung in the royal box for several Ascot meetings. He much preferred Epsom, with its Gypsies, to Ascot, and he enjoyed the smaller intimate meetings at Sandown and Hurst Park, and at Newmarket, which he thought was the most beautiful course in the world. There the Jockey Club loaned him an old horse-box on the course to use as a studio, and it was in this that he painted some of his best racing pictures. He bought the old grammar school schoolroom at Dedham to convert into a large studio. He loved the views of the countryside from the building and, like his writer friend Adrian Bell, grew very concerned about the loss of old country values and the desecration of the land by mechanization.<br>
<br>During the Second World War Munnings retired to his cottage on Exmoor, where, despite gout in his right wrist, he painted landscapes, Dartmoor ponies, and hunting scenes, and, feeling more at peace with himself than he had since the early Newlyn days, wrote gentle reflective poetry rather than the long ballads and obscene verses in which he once indulged. His peace was shattered, however, when he reluctantly agreed to stand as president of the Royal Academy in succession to Sir Edwin Lutyens, who had defeated him for office in 1938. On 14 March 1944 he beat Augustus John by twenty-four votes to seventeen and in June received a knighthood in the king's birthday honours.<h2>
<a name="PresidentoftheRoyalAcademy"></a>President of the Royal Academy</h2>Munnings was the Royal Academy's most controversial president. He ignored protocol at council meetings, was frustrated when duty stopped him from painting, and counteracted the boredom of selecting pictures for the summer exhibition by writing letters and articles to the press. His notoriously short temper was aggravated by sleepless nights caused by heavy air raids and increasing gout. He was temporarily appeased by his successful exhibition at the Leicester Galleries, by receiving the freedom of Norwich, and by hosting splendid dinners at the academy. At one of these he made Sir Winston Churchill the first Royal Academician extraordinary, after persuading him to submit six paintings anonymously to the summer exhibition when all were accepted. At Churchill's suggestion, in 1949 he revived the academy's men-only annual banquet after a lapse of ten years. His uninhibited sixteen minute after-dinner speech at it made academy history: he berated the academy, the Arts Council, the Tate Gallery, and Anthony Blunt (surveyor of the king's pictures), and ranted against modern art, including &#145;those foolish daubers&#146; C&eacute;zanne, Matisse, and Picasso, whose influence, he said, had defiled British tradition. While sackfuls of letters showed that, in general, the public agreed with him, the BBC received forty objections to his use of the word &#145;damned&#146;. He was privately rebuked by Churchill, not for the tenor of his speech but for publicizing a private joke. Churchill had said to him &#145;Alfred, if you met Picasso coming down the street would you join with me in kicking his something, something &hellip;?&#146; and he had replied &#145;Yes Sir, I would.&#146;<br>
<br>Despite its public appeal, the after-dinner speech ostracized Munnings from the art world. He resigned the presidency of the academy at the end of the year to make &#145;a joyous return to painting&#146;, which he interrupted by an unsuccessful attempt to have one of his reviled moderns, Stanley Spencer, prosecuted for obscene painting. He lectured against modern art and what he perceived as the subversive activities of the Arts Council; and also against mechanized farming, promoting instead the need for more ecological methods. He also wrote a highly acclaimed, copiously illustrated three-volume autobiography. Persistent gout, increasing physical disability, and a rarely voiced fear of diminishing eyesight aggravated his irritability. He became too ill to attend his retrospective exhibition of 200 paintings at the Royal Academy in 1956; by April 1959, with both hands bandaged, he could not even write.<br>
<br>Munnings died in his sleep at Castle House on 17 July 1959. After a private cremation at Colchester, Essex, his ashes were interred in the crypt of St Paul's Cathedral, London, where his memorial plaque was placed next to that of John Constable. A memorial service was held a week later in St James's, Piccadilly. His estate and possessions were left to his wife. In fulfilment of his wish that his estate and the paintings in his possession should be left to the nation, his widow worked to establish, through trusts, an art museum at their Dedham home where a large collection of his work is hung (now the Sir Alfred Munnings Art Museum). Together with many other paintings in private and public collections, including the Castle Museum in Norwich, the Canadian War Museum in Ottawa, the Royal Academy, and the Tate collection, the Sir Alfred Munnings Art Museum helps to endorse the artist's belief that he would be remembered best as a painter of the English landscape rather than primarily as a horse painter.<br>
