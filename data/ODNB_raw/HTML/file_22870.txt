<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Pugin,  Edward Welby</span>  (1834&#150;1875), <span class="occ">architect</span>, was born on 11 March 1834 at Ramsgate, the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22869/', "Augustus Welby Northmore Pugin (1812&#150;1852)")</script> and his second wife, Louisa Burton (<i>c</i>.1813&#150;1844). He was trained by his father and at the age of eighteen found himself in charge of his father's practice, which he developed with many pupils and various partnerships, most importantly with his brother-in-law <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/63266/', "George Coppinger Ashlin")</script> in Ireland (1859&#150;69) and his brother Peter Paul Pugin (1851&#150;1904).<br>
<br>Edward Pugin's practice was overwhelmingly Roman Catholic. He worked initially in his father's preferred Decorated Gothic style, at St Mary's, Crook, co. Durham (1853), Oulton Abbey, Staffordshire, for Benedictine nuns (1853), and Belmont Abbey church, Herefordshire (1854&#150;85). From 1856 his style became more elaborate but his church plans simpler by widening the span of the arcades, diminishing chancel arches, and abolishing rood screens, so as to achieve ample sightlines to his elaborate altars with towering reredoses set in shallow apses. Examples are St Vincent de Paul, Liverpool (1856&#150;7), St Hubert's, Great Harwood, Lancashire (1858&#150;9), Our Lady, Eldon Street, Liverpool (1859&#150;60), All Saints', Barton upon Irwell, Lancashire (1863&#150;8), his richest English church, Stanbrook Abbey church, Worcestershire (1869&#150;71), and English Martyrs, Prescott Street, Tower Hamlets, London (1873&#150;5). His most important churches are Our Lady, Dadizeele, Belgium (designed 1857; built 1857&#150;67 in partnership with Baron Jean Baptiste Bethune), and, in Ireland, Sts Peter and Paul, Cork (1859&#150;66), Sts Augustine and John, Dublin (1862&#150;93), and St Colman's Cathedral, Cove, co. Cork (1859&#150;1916), all with Ashlin. He designed much school, monastery, and convent architecture, notably the Franciscan Recollect Priory (1863) and the church of St Francis of Assisi (1866&#150;72; completed 1878&#150;85), Gorton, Manchester. E. W. Pugin was a talented draughtsman and watercolourist; his drawings are characterized by a frenetic, nervous line and his attenuation is reminiscent of his father's early work. He is at his most characteristic in the elaborate architectural carving, sculpture, and varied materials of his altars and chantry chapels such as the Knill chantry, St George's Cathedral, Southwark (1856), and the de Trafford chantry, Barton-on-Irwell, Lancashire (1863). He failed to keep up his father's close relationship with George Crace, John Hardman, and George Myers, instead commissioning his designs for metalwork and stained glass from Hardman &amp; Co. (but he was not the chief designer); for architectural sculpture he preferred Farmer and Brindley. He set up a furniture manufacturing business for the large speculation the Granville Hotel, Ramsgate (1869&#150;73); earlier domestic furniture also survives. Important interiors and additions are at Scarisbrick Hall, Lancashire (after 1866), and the castle of Loppem, Belgium (designed 1856; built from 1859 by Pugin and Bethune).<br>
<br>Reconciling the Roman Catholic clergy to the use of the Gothic style in the wake of the &#145;rood screen controversy&#146; provoked by A. W. N. Pugin, E. W. Pugin yearned for his father's commanding position in architectural matters for the Roman Catholic church in England. His claims were taken very seriously in Belgium, and in Ireland, where he was made a papal knight in 1858. He visited the USA in 1873, and at least one church was begun there.<br>
<br>The Pugin family moved back to The Grange, Ramsgate, in 1862, where Edward made extensive additions to his father's house and to St Augustine's Church, where he had designed his father's tomb in the Pugin chantry (1853). He added the Digby chantry (1857) and the north (1857) and west (1859) cloisters, and fitted out the lady chapel (1862). He also built St Augustine's Monastery, Ramsgate (1859&#150;60), for the Benedictines. Although he inherited his father's papers, he did not authorize a biography (certainly not B. Ferrey's <span class="italic">Recollections of A. N. Welby Pugin, and his Father, Augustus Pugin</span>, 1861). Having earlier claimed that Sir Charles Barry refused to give him a pupilship, he subsequently initiated a pamphlet war with <span class="italic">Who was the art architect of the houses of parliament: a statement of facts, founded on the letters of Sir Charles Barry and the diaries of Augustus Welby Pugin</span> (1867).<br>
<br>Edward Pugin died unmarried, at his home, Victoria House, 111 Victoria Street, Westminster, of syncope of the heart, on 5 June 1875. He was buried in St Augustine's Church, Ramsgate, Kent, five days later. As an architect, he was less important than his father; however, his style and plans became normative for Roman Catholic churches in the British Isles in the second half of the nineteenth century. The firm continued as Pugin and Pugin.<br>
