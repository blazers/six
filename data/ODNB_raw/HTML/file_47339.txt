<span class="headword">Davies,  Stephen Owen</span>  (1886&#150;1972), <span class="occ">miners' leader and politician</span>, was born at 39 John Street, Abercwmboi, Glamorgan, probably on 9 November 1886, the fourth of six children of Thomas Davies, miner and union organizer, and his wife, Esther. However, there is some uncertainty over the exact date of his birth.<br>
<br>After attending Capcoch School in Abercwmboi Davies started work in local coal mines at the age of twelve, but subsequently studied mining engineering at night classes, and in 1908 secured sponsorship from Brecon Memorial College to study for a BA at University College, Cardiff, with the ultimate intention of entering the nonconformist ministry. Conflict with Brecon over the precise nature of his religious beliefs led to withdrawal of support, but Davies nevertheless obtained his degree in 1913.<br>
<br>Davies's plans to become a minister were superseded by growing activism in socialist politics and trade unionism&#151;two factors inextricably linked in the south Wales coalfield. In 1918 Davies became full-time agent for the Dowlais district of the South Wales Miners' Federation (SWMF) and entered into a formidable partnership with his counterpart in the neighbouring district of Merthyr, Noah Ablett (1883&#150;1935). On 23 August 1919 he married Margaret Eley (<i>d</i>. 1932) of Cardiff; they had three daughters.<br>
<br>Adopting almost a syndicalist position, Davies maintained implacable opposition to post-war demands for nationalization of the industry as well as unsuccessfully advocating affiliation of the Miners' Federation of Great Britain to the Red International of Labour Unions (RILU) formed in Moscow in 1921. In 1922 Davies paid a visit to the Soviet Union as delegate of the Dowlais district of the SWMF to the Second World Congress of the RILU. This visit furnished him with a lifelong but often uncritical admiration for the Soviet system. Despite this, and although sympathetic to many of its aims, Davies did not join the Communist Party of Great Britain, preferring to remain within the Labour Party throughout the coalfield struggles of the 1920s. In 1934 Davies was elected Labour MP for Merthyr. The same year he remarried, his first wife having died two years earlier. His second wife was Sephora Davies from Carmarthenshire, with whom he had two sons.<br>
<br>At Westminster Davies consistently proved himself of independent mind, as prone to oppose the policies of a Labour government as those of a Conservative administration. Ever the watchdog for socialism, in its purest sense, as well as a rigid apologist for Soviet domestic and foreign policy whatever the excesses, he lost the whip on three occasions between 1953 and 1961 on issues relating to American bases in Britain, West German rearmament, and opposition to the Polaris submarine programme. A thorn in the side of the Wilson government between 1966 and 1970, he disagreed with its policy on public spending, wage controls, and trade union legislation. His support for the idea of Welsh self-government also often found him at variance with party policy.<br>
<br>Unsurprisingly, Davies was never offered government office but proved himself an excellent constituency MP. His concerns included reformation of the national insurance law in 1967, giving additional compensation to former miners afflicted with dust-related diseases. Such successes gained him a popular affection which transcended his admission to the Aberfan disaster tribunal in 1966 that he had entertained misgivings about the safety of local coal tips but remained silent, fearing that raising concern might cause closure of nearby collieries.<br>
<br>The Aberfan disaster also led to Davies's final estrangement from the Labour Party. Harold Wilson's support for the idea of using the disaster fund to contribute towards removal of the tips led Davies to boycott the ceremony bestowing freedom of the borough of Merthyr on the prime minister in 1970. His constituency party consequently replaced him as its candidate in the general election later that year. Refusing to accept that his political career was over, he stood as an independent socialist and, campaigning on his record, won by more than 7000 votes over the official Labour candidate. While this may say something about the historically individualistic nature of Merthyr politics, it also testified to his reputation and the local esteem in which he was held.<br>
<br>S. O. Davies died at Merthyr Tudful's general hospital on 25 February 1972, following a chest infection, and was buried at Maesyrarian cemetery, Mountain Ash, in his native Cynon valley on the 29th. He was survived by his second wife.<br>
