<span class="headword">Webb,  Philip Carteret</span>  (1702&#150;1770), <span class="occ">barrister and antiquary</span>, was born at Devizes in Wiltshire on 14 August 1702. His father was Daniel Webb. His mother is unknown; nor is there any record of his schooling. From such obscure beginnings he surfaces in London, being admitted attorney-at-law on 20 June 1724. He practised in Old Jewry, then Budge Row, before settling in Great Queen Street, Lincoln's Inn Fields. On 18 December 1727 he was admitted at the Middle Temple, and on 8 April 1741 at Lincoln's Inn. On 22 November 1730 he married Susanna Lodington (<i>d</i>. 1756), the daughter of Benjamin Lodington, consul at Tripoli. They had three children, two of whom died in infancy; the surviving child was also called Philip Carteret Webb (<i>d</i>. 1793).<br>
<br>Webb was a legal beaver, and early gained the reputation for knowledge of records and constitutional precedents which would make him such a valued servant of government. It was enhanced by such publications as <span class="italic">Observations on the Course of Proceedings in the Admiralty Courts</span> (1747) and <span class="italic">Short but True State of Facts Relative to the Jew Bill</span> (1753). In this period the law, soon to be defined by Blackstone in his magisterial <span class="italic">Commentaries</span> (1765&#150;9), was held in highest respect and permeated the business of parliament. An expert with the ambition and stamina to take on political cases would not lack for employment. After the defeat of the Jacobite rising of 1745 Webb was influential as solicitor in the trials of the prisoners. He was the author of <span class="italic">Remarks on the Pretender's Declaration and Commission</span> (1745), and the subsequent <span class="italic">Remarks on the Pretender's Eldest Son's Second Declaration</span> (1745). His patron, Lord Chancellor Hardwicke, made him secretary of bankrupts in the court of chancery; he retained the post until 1766.<br>
<br>In 1748 Webb purchased the estate of Busbridge, which gave him influence in the nearby burgage borough of Haslemere. &#145;That sink-hole of a borough&#146;  (W. Cobbett, <span class="italic">Rural Rides</span>, ed. J. P. Cobbett, 2 vols., 1853, 1.97) was Cobbett's later verdict on Haslemere, whose venal electors Webb represented in parliament from 1754 to 1768. His first election inspired Dr King's ballad of <span class="italic">The Cow of Haslemere</span> which had eight calves, for each of which a vote for Webb was claimed. Webb may seem more of a civil servant than a politician but the distinction was not then so readily recognized: most senior civil servants sat in the Commons and there were numerous legal placemen. In December 1756 he was made joint solicitor to the Treasury and he held that office until June 1765. When he caused a row by toasting the unpopular Lord Bute&#151;&#145;my master&#146;&#151;at a public dinner, his whig friend Lord Hardwicke defended him: it was &#145;natural for the Sollicitor of the Treasury to toast the head of it&#146;  (Namier, 38). With his reputation as a government workhorse, and the &#145;Old Bailey&#146; manner that went down badly in the Commons, he might still have escaped political historians' notice had it not been for his involvement in the Wilkes affair, when he was a prime agent in the ministry's proceedings. He then earned the scorn of Horace Walpole, who described him as &#145;a most villainous tool and agent in any iniquity&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters of Horace Walpole</span>, 1.277).<br>
<br>It was required of Webb to counsel ministers and devise tactics in a situation where the law was uncertain and the political implications, especially regarding a possibly improper use of the royal prerogative, were sinister. After the publication of the crudely xenophobic number 45 of the <span class="italic">North Briton</span>, he, along with Robert Wood, the under-secretary of state, attended the seizure of Wilkes's papers on 30 April 1763, on the instruction of lords Halifax and Egremont and was armed with a general warrant which ordered the arrest of all concerned with the publication of the <span class="italic">North Briton</span>. The papers included the salacious <span class="italic">Essay on Woman</span> which had been privately printed for Wilkes and which ministers would use to discredit him. When the legality of general warrants was challenged, Webb had printed, privately and anonymously, a volume of <span class="italic">Copies taken from the records of the court of king's bench, the office-books of the secretaries of state, of warrants issued by secretaries of state</span>. He followed it up with some <span class="italic">Observations</span> on the discharge of Wilkes from the Tower.<br>
<br>When an action was brought against Wood for seizing Wilkes's papers, Webb, as a witness, swore that, while in the house, &#145;he had no key in his hand&#146;. For this, on 22 May 1764, he was tried for perjury before Lord Mansfield, with a special jury, and was acquitted. The general warrants issue was used by opposition politicians to identify parliamentary lawyers as agents of a new absolutism. In the resulting furore Webb found himself in the front line, the object of a political vendetta. A parliamentary motion was proposed in November 1768 for the return of all moneys paid to him for prosecutions but was refused. When he was charged, on 31 January 1769, with having bribed an informer against Wilkes, his counsel pleaded that he was now blind and of impaired mind: the motion was defeated, but in a way that left an impression of past chicanery and offered Webb little comfort.<br>
<br>Antiquarian friends who met regularly at the Young Devil tavern in Fleet Street, later in the courtyard of Burlington House, knowing Webb to be a cultivated man, would not have recognized the &#145;dirty wretch&#146; and &#145;sorry knave&#146; described by Horace Walpole  (<span class="italic">Letters of Horace Walpole</span>, 2.332, 38.316). Webb was elected FSA on 26 November 1747 and FRS on 9 November 1749. In 1751 he assisted in obtaining the charter of incorporation for the Society of Antiquaries. He was a scholarly investigator of the past and read several papers to the society, including &#145;A short account of Danegeld&#146; (April 1756) and &#145;A short account of Domesday Book, with a view to its publication&#146; (December 1755). He surely enjoyed exposing as forgery a record of an oath allegedly taken by Henry II before the pope after the murder of Becket (April 1756). After having written <span class="italic">An account of a copper table with two inscriptions, Greek and Latin, discovered in 1732 near Heraclea</span> (April 1755), he presented the table to the king of Spain and received in return a valuable diamond ring. He was also a serious collector and was rich enough to buy ambitiously. He purchased a third of the great collection of manuscripts of Sir Julius Caesar, now among the Lansdowne manuscripts in the British Museum. He sold to the House of Lords thirty manuscript volumes of the rolls of parliament. Susanna Webb died at Bath on 12 March 1756, aged forty-five, and, following her wishes, she was buried with their two children in a cave at Busbridge. They were afterwards disinterred and placed in a vault in Godalming church. On 21 August 1758 Webb married Rhoda Cotes (<i>bap</i>. 1731), from Dodington in Cheshire. They had no children. He died at Busbridge Hall on 22 June 1770 and was buried in Godalming church, where a monument to him and to his first wife was erected. His great library was sold over the course of sixteen days in February and March 1771. His most valuable coins and medals were acquired by Matthew Duane; the rest of his collection, together with his ancient marbles and bronzes, were sold in 1771. His widow married, on 5 September 1771, Edward Bever of Farnham. In 1775 she sold Busbridge. Webb's memorial there was the forest of oak trees, for planting which, in 1758, he had received the silver medal of the Society of Arts. In this way he had conformed to what society expected of a gentleman.<br>
