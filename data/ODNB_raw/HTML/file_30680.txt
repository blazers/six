<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Bell,  Alexander Graham</span>  (1847&#150;1922), <span class="occ">teacher of deaf people and inventor of the telephone</span>, was born on 3 March 1847 at 16 South Charlotte Street, Edinburgh, the second of three sons of Alexander Melville Bell (1819&#150;1905), speech therapist and elocutionist, and his first wife, Eliza Grace, daughter of Samuel Symonds, surgeon in the Royal Navy, and his wife, Mary. Bell was educated initially at home and then at James Maclaren's Hamilton Place Academy, Edinburgh (1857&#150;8), and at the Royal High School, Calton Hill, Edinburgh, from 1858. In 1862, at the age of fifteen, he left Edinburgh to stay in London with his grandfather, Alexander Bell (1790&#150;1865), who was a well-known elocutionist, and author of <span class="italic">The Practical Elocutionist</span> and <span class="italic">Stammering, and other Impediments of Speech</span>.<br>
<br>From 1863 to 1864 Bell was a pupil teacher at Weston House, Elgin, Moray, where he taught both music and elocution and received instruction in Latin and Greek. These disciplines were further studied at the University of Edinburgh from 1864 to 1865. He returned to Weston House as an assistant master in 1865, and in 1866 became a master at Somerset College, Bath. In 1867 he joined, as an assistant, his father, who was continuing his own father's work in London and who was also a notable elocutionist; he had written <span class="italic">A New Elucidation of the Principles of Speech and Elocution</span> (1849), and <span class="italic">Principles of Speech</span> (1863).<br>
<br>Bell became adept at teaching deaf people. He matriculated at the University of London in 1868 and attended physiology and anatomy classes from October of that year. In 1870 he and his parents emigrated to Brantford, Ontario, Canada. He continued his work for deaf people in the USA, in Boston and Northampton, Massachusetts, and in Hartford, Connecticut, and he was appointed professor of vocal physiology and elocution at Boston University in 1873. He became a naturalized American citizen in 1874.<br>
<br>Bell's early experimental work was influenced by A. J. Ellis, a phonetician, who had been converted to A. M. Bell's system of &#145;visible speech&#146;. In 1866 he introduced Bell to the work of Helmholtz and his electric tuning-fork apparatus, which could produce composite vowel-like sounds. Ellis suggested that Bell should repeat Helmholtz's experiments. Bell soon conceived the notion of a multiple, or harmonic, telegraph, using tuned reeds, which would permit a number of telegraph messages to be sent simultaneously over a single wire by means of interrupted tones of different frequencies. He worked intermittently on such a scheme for several years.<br>
<br>In 1874 Bell saw demonstrations of Koenig's manometric flame apparatus and Scott's phonautograph, which produced visual images of sounds. Both apparatus used membrane diaphragms. P. Reis's &#145;telephone&#146; of 1861, which was well known by 1874, also employed a membrane diaphragm at the transmitter. Soon afterwards, about October 1874, Bell produced his ear phonautograph, which utilized a human ear (with its eardrum). This had been suggested by Dr C. J. Blake, who became a renowned American otologist. During the autumn and winter of 1874, and subsequently, Bell, with his young assistant, Thomas A. Watson, spent more and more time on his experimental work. Their efforts were rewarded when, on 2 June 1875, Bell's first membrane diaphragm telephone transmitter produced speech sounds. Watson told Bell: &#145;I could hear your voice plainly. I could almost make out what you said.&#146; In January 1876 Bell set up a workshop at 5 Exeter Place, Boston. On the evening of 10 March Watson, with a tuned reed receiver operated from a liquid transmitter, distinctly heard Bell's voice say: &#145;Mr Watson, come here. I want you.&#146; Subsequently, on 25 June, using his membrane transmitters and membrane receiver, Bell showed that intelligible speech could be transmitted over wires. His patents of 7 March 1876 and 30 January 1877 became the fundamental telephone patents. Over a period of eighteen years they were tested in around 600 separate actions.<br>
<br>While Bell was working on his telegraph system, T. Sanders, a leather merchant and friend, made Bell a verbal offer of help to finance his endeavours, in return for a share in whatever patent rights might accrue. Soon afterwards, Gardiner G. Hubbard, a Boston attorney and Bell's future father-in-law, made a similar offer. These offers were accepted, and on 27 February 1875 the Bell Patent Association was formed. This organization became, in several stages, the American Telephone and Telegraph Company (incorporated on 3 March 1885). Bell married Mabel Gardiner, daughter of G. G. Hubbard, on 11 July 1877. She had been deaf from early childhood. They had two daughters, Elsie and Marian.<br>
<br>By early 1880, Bell had abandoned business matters relating to the telephone, and was engaged with Charles Sumner Tainter, in developing the photophone. This was an invention which enabled speech signals to be transmitted from one place to another by means of a light beam. The invention utilized a selenium cell, in which the photoconductive property of selenium (discovered in 1873) was used. Bell in 1898 was of the opinion that the photophone was his greatest invention, and in 1921 he stated his view that &#145;in the implementation of the principles involved&#146; the invention was &#145;greater than [that of] the telephone&#146;. However, the rapid development of radio and the very limited range of the photophone were not conducive to its general application.<br>
<br>Until his death in 1922, Bell's fertile imagination and interests ranged over many topics. Apart from multiple telegraphy, the telephone, and the photophone, his experimental activities embraced, among others, spectrophones, phonographs, telephonic probes, kites, aeroplanes, hydrofoil boats, and air conditioning, and he took a keen interest in sheep breeding, longevity, eugenics, and the National Geographic Society of America. &#145;There cannot be mental atrophy&#146;, he wrote, &#145;in any person who continues to observe, to remember what he observes, and to seek answers for his unceasing hows and whys about things&#146;  (Bruce, 486&#150;7).<br>
<br>Bell was greatly honoured during his lifetime. He received twelve honorary doctorates, and was the recipient of the Volta prize of the French government (1880), the Hughes medal of the Royal Society (1913), the freedom of the city of Edinburgh (1920), and honorary fellowship of the Institution of Electrical Engineers (1913). He suffered from diabetes and died, on 2 August 1922, at his house, Beinn Bhreagh (beautiful mountain), Baddeck, Cape Breton Island, Nova Scotia, Canada. He was buried at the top of Beinn Bhreagh on the 4th and, at the time of the burial, 6.25 p.m., all the telephone traffic throughout the United States was stopped for one minute.<br>
