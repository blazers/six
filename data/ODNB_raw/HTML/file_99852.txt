<span class="headword">Dobr&eacute;e,  Georgina</span>  (1930&#150;2008), <span class="occ">clarinettist</span>, was born on 8 January 1930 at 74 Sutherland Avenue, Maida Vale, London, the only child of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/31035/', "Bonamy Dobr&#233;e (1891&#150;1974)")</script>, literary scholar, and his wife, Gladys May Mabel (Valentine), <i>n&eacute;e</i> Brooke-Pechell (1894&#150;1974), artist, author, and poet. She was brought up first at Mendham Priory, Harleston, Norfolk, and then from 1936 at Earls Colne, Essex. From an early age she studied violin and piano and when the Second World War broke out was evacuated to the United States to stay with friends of her parents. She attended the Peabody Conservatory in Baltimore, where she discarded her violin studies and began playing the clarinet, having found one by chance in the home of the people she was staying with, and discovering an immediate affinity for the instrument.<br>
<br>After returning to London at the end of the war Dobr&eacute;e spent three years at the Royal Academy of Music (1946&#150;8), studying piano under Harold Craxton and clarinet under George Anderson. In 1949 she won a scholarship offered by the French government to study in Paris with Gaston Hamelin, principal clarinettist in the Orchestre Nationale. In the 1951 Hoveringham Festival she played in association with the Griller quartet, led by the violinist Sidney Griller. The following year she made her first broadcast from this festival for the BBC Third Programme. During the summer she travelled to Darmstadt and won the Kranichsteiner music prize for new music, returning to London in the autumn to take part in a series of lectures and recitals on twelve-tone music at Morley College, London's contemporary music hub in this era. Her concerts in London during the 1950s featured regular recitals for the Society for the Promotion of New Music and appearances with the McNaughton New Music Group. At Thea King's invitation she joined the Portia Wind Ensemble and later on created the Chantry Ensemble with the flautist William Bennett, who was succeeded by Patricia Lynden, and with the pianist Alexander Kelly. Elisabeth Lutyens dedicated her Fantasie Trio op. 55 (1963) to the ensemble. Among the many other works written for her was Gordon Jacob's Miniature Suite for clarinet and viola. Alexander Kelly was to remain her most regular pianist and in 1973 they gave a series of concerts in Leighton House, Holland Park, to celebrate twenty-one years of this partnership.<br>
<br>Dobr&eacute;e was always aware of the Huguenot origins of her father, which perhaps explains her affinity with French music. She felt very much at home with the French style of clarinet playing and with French instruments but was also able to adapt to the more contemporary German sound. From 1953 to 1964 she appeared regularly in the Darmstadt Festival, where she performed the music of and worked with composers such as Peter Maxwell Davies, Olivier Messiaen, Luciano Berio, Karlheinz Stockhausen, and Pierre Boulez.<br>
<br>Dobr&eacute;e started playing the basset horn in 1952 and it began to make an appearance in her programmes in 1957, when she performed the sonata for piano and basset horn by Franz Danzi and, with Thea King, the Mendelssohn Konzertst&uuml;cke op. 114. She recorded the Mendelssohn piece for Hyperion with Thea King and also edited this music in the 1990s. Meanwhile her performing career continued with such momentum and vitality through the 1950s and 1960s that it would be easy to overlook her other activities and achievements. Her contributions in researching, editing, and performing early repertoire for clarinets and basset horn can reasonably be said to have begun with Johann Melchior Molter's concertos for D clarinet, recorded for EMI in 1968. From making this recording the idea came to form her own record company, Chantry Records, which continued until 1985. Eight vinyl recordings were reissued on compact disc by Clarinet Classics in 1995.<br>
<br>From the late 1960s Dobr&eacute;e also became increasingly in demand as a teacher and began this aspect of her career as clarinet tutor at the Watford School of Music. She was subsequently professor of clarinet at the Royal Academy of Music, London, from 1967 until 1986. Editorial commissions came from publishers such as Schott, Musica Rara, Oxford University Press, and Chester Music. Alongside the Chantry record label, she had her own publishing company, Chantry Publications, which was transferred to Emerson Edition in 1999. In that year she also completed one of her last editions, a collection of four French clarinet works published by Kevin Mayhew and consisting of clarinet and piano sonata no. 12 by Jean Xavier Lef&egrave;vre, <span class="italic">Premi&egrave;re Rhapsodie</span> and <span class="italic">Petite Pi&egrave;ce</span> by Claude Debussy, and the sonata op. 167 by Camille Saint-Sa&euml;ns. She also continued to extend the contemporary repertoire for the basset horn in the 1990s, commissioning new works from a number of British and eastern European composers including Paul Drayton, David Gow, Sarah Rodgers, Petr Pokorn&yacute;, Jaroslav Ryb&aacute;&#345;, Karel Janovick&yacute;, Marta Jir&aacute;&#269;kov&aacute;, Alois Pi&#328;os, and Iris Szeghov&aacute;.<br>
<br>Georgina Dobr&eacute;e was notable not only for the mastery of the instruments that she played but also for her initiation of new and discovery of old works that enriched the repertoire for clarinet and basset horn players and listeners. She was a meticulous musicologist, dedicated to the furthering of scholarly information about the instruments she loved, as well as a fine musician and in great demand as a teacher. She was an indefatigable ambassador for the clarinet and basset horn in both Europe and the USA, and her home in north London was a magnetic hub, often becoming the base for visiting instrumentalists and composers. There were regular parties for colleagues and friends to meet the foreign visitors, and to enjoy her legendary hospitality. Latterly she suffered from Alzheimer's disease and moved to a nursing home in Hitchin, Hertfordshire. In early April 2008 she suffered a fractured left femur and underwent surgery; she died of a chest infection at the Lister Hospital, Stevenage, on 27 April 2008. She was unmarried.<br>
