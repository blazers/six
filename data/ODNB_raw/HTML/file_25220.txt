<span class="headword">Sharp,  Thomas</span>  (1693&#150;1758), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and theological writer</span>, was born on 12 December 1693, the younger son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25213/', "John Sharp (1645?&#150;1714)")</script>, archbishop of York, and his wife, Elizabeth Palmer (<i>fl</i>. 1660&#150;1715), of Winthorpe in Lincolnshire. He was educated at first privately, by a Mr Ellis, then at Leeds grammar school, and later at St Paul's School, London. Admitted at Trinity College, Cambridge, on 25 April 1709, where he was tutored by Nicholas Clagett, college librarian, he became a Jermyn scholar in the following year. A commonplace book survives from his period as an undergraduate detailing his reading in theology, trigonometry, optics, and hydrostatics. He graduated BA in 1713 as a wrangler, was elected to a fellowship in 1715, and proceeded MA in 1716. He was ordained deacon in the diocese of London on 16 June 1716 and priested at York in February 1718. He became chaplain to Archbishop Dawes, prebendary of Southwell in Nottinghamshire, and a member of the Gentlemen's Society at Spalding. He was installed as prebendary of Wistow in the diocese of York on 8 May 1719, an office he held until his death in 1758. He was presented to the living of Ormsby, Yorkshire, in 1719, then on 27 February 1723 to the living of Rothbury in Northumberland, the second most valuable in the county. At the same time he was appointed archdeacon of Northumberland. He was created DD at Cambridge in 1729. On 1 December 1732 he was installed in the tenth prebend of Durham Cathedral, in 1755 succeeding Dr Mangey as official to the dean and chapter there. Although this excessive plurality must have been lucrative for Sharp, he appears to have been a conscientious and tireless pastor, as well as an efficient ecclesiastical administrator.<br>
<br>Sharp married Judith (<i>d</i>. 1757), daughter of Sir George Wheler (1651&#150;1723), traveller, and Grace Higgons, on 19 June 1722 at Houghton-le-Spring, co. Durham; between 1723 and 1738, they had fourteen children, to whom he remained devoted throughout his life. He engaged in a voluminous correspondence with many of them. Much of his wealth was spent on the education of his two eldest sons, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/65613/', "John Sharp")</script> and Thomas, both of whom followed him to Trinity College, Cambridge. John became, like his father, prebendary of Durham, and Thomas, fellow of Trinity, became curate at Bamburgh. Of his other children, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25208/', "Granville Sharp")</script> became a noted abolitionist, and William surgeon to George III. The Sharp family remained closely knit, bound together partly by religion, partly by a love of music. Many of his children were depicted playing music together on the family barge on the Thames by Zoffany in his painting <span class="italic">The Sharp Family</span>, now in the National Portrait Gallery.<br>
<br>Sharp was a considerable book collector and owned a large library, in part inherited from his father. It was divided between his homes at Rothbury and Durham, and contained a substantial collection of early book auction catalogues. His books eventually became part of the library of Bamburgh Castle, one of Lord Crewe's charities, and are now on deposit in Durham University Library. Sharp was, like his sons, closely associated with the Corporation of the Sons of the Clergy, his first publication being a printed edition of a sermon he delivered to the corporation in York in 1721, <span class="italic">A Charity-Sermon for the Relief of Poor Widows and Children of Clergymen</span> (1721). Many of the sermons he preached in Durham, Newcastle, York, Cambridge, and London were printed, together with a number of theological works. The first and most frequently reprinted of these was <span class="italic">The Necessary Knowledge of the Lord's Supper</span> (1727), reprinted six times in the eighteenth century alone. He regularly engaged in theological controversy; his <span class="italic">Enquiry about the Lawfulness of Eating Blood</span> (1733) was quickly followed by a <span class="italic">Defence of the Enquiry about the Lawfulness of Eating Blood</span> (1734), and he published a <span class="italic">Reply to a Pamphlet Entitled, &#145;The Protestant Flair&#146;</span> (1735). His <span class="italic">Two dissertations concerning the etymology and scripture-meaning of the Hebrew words Elohim and Berith</span> (1751) was written with the advice of Thomas Birch, who also saw it through the press for him. Sharp was forced to publish <span class="italic">A review and defence of two dissertations concerning the etymology and scripture-meaning of the Hebrew words Elohim and Berith</span> in 1754 and 1755. A related work, <span class="italic">Discourses Touching the Antiquity of the Hebrew Tongue and Character</span>, was published in 1755. His lengthy correspondence with Catherine Cockburn on moral virtue and moral obligation, published in volume 2 of Cockburn's <span class="italic">Works</span> (1751), survives in manuscript. It was recommended by Richard Price in the first edition (1758) of his influential <span class="italic">Review of the Principal Questions and Difficulties in Morals</span>. Sharp's <span class="italic">Collected Works</span> were published in six volumes in 1763. He died at Durham on 16 March 1758 and on 23 March was buried in the galilee chapel in Durham Cathedral.<br>
