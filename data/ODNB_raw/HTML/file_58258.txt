<span class="headword">Pease, Sir  Alfred Edward</span>, second baronet  (1857&#150;1939), <span class="occ">politician and sportsman</span>, was born at Woodlands, Darlington, on 29 June 1857, the second of the eight children, and the eldest son, of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35447/', "Sir Joseph Whitwell Pease, first baronet (1828&#150;1903)")</script>, businessman and Liberal MP for Barnard Castle, co. Durham (1885&#150;1903), and his wife, Mary Fox (<i>d</i>. 1892). He was born into an established Darlington Quaker family which figured prominently in the politics and economy of the region. His father, uncle, and grandfather were all Liberal members of parliament, and both he and his younger brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35446/', "Joseph Albert (Jack) Pease")</script>, who became Baron Gainford (1917), followed in this tradition. Pease was educated at Grove House, Tottenham, and entered Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1876, graduating BA in 1880 (MA, 1883). On 10 February 1880 he married Helen Ann (Nellie) Fowler (1858&#150;1910), third daughter of Sir Robert Nicholas Fowler, first baronet, banker, and Conservative politician; they had two sons and a daughter. Pease entered business and became a director of the family firm, Pease &amp; Partners Ltd, and of the National Provident Institution. He was an alderman of the North Riding from 1889 to 1937, and a deputy lieutenant for both the North Riding and London.<br>
<br>In 1885 Pease was elected Liberal MP for York, which he represented until his defeat at the 1892 general election; he was defeated there again in 1895. In January 1897, while travelling in Somaliland, he was elected for the Cleveland division of the North Riding and sat until 1902, when he accepted the Chiltern Hundreds. Though designated a Liberal, Pease preferred the appellation &#145;whig&#146;, and defended with gusto the principle of a ruling class whose members were born and bred in the traditions of government. At the same time he admired Gladstone and steadfastly supported Irish home rule, free trade, and temperance. Much happier in the Victorian political world than in the Edwardian, Pease opposed the &#145;people's budget&#146; of 1909 as a &#145;socialist&#146; measure. Believing that Asquith was &#145;out for the &#147;Labour&#148; vote&#146; and had taken &#145;Lloyd George and Limehouse to his bosom&#146;, he severed links with the party of &#145;neo-Liberalism&#146;  (Pease, <span class="italic">Elections</span>, 301).<br>
<br>By this date, however, Pease's political career was over. During the 1890s the family textile business had gone into decline; when its failure became public in 1902 Pease resigned his seat. It was a humbling turn of fortune for one whose coming of age in 1878 had been celebrated with a party for 800 at his father's mansion, Hutton Hall, in Yorkshire. Although Pease avoided bankruptcy, only desperate measures enabled him to save Pinchinthorpe House, his Yorkshire home, from the creditors. In straitened circumstances he sought employment abroad and he was wryly amused when help eventually came from a political opponent and not from a political friend.<br>
<br>In 1903, the year that Pease succeeded to his father's baronetcy, Lord Milner, of whom he had been highly critical during the South African War, appointed him resident magistrate in the Barberton district of the Transvaal. After a period of service there in 1903&#150;5, he pursued several speculative business ventures, including an ostrich farm in Africa, before settling again in England. Although none of his money-making schemes took off, Pease was able to live the remainder of his life as a gentleman of means. After the death of his first wife he married on 28 September 1912 Laure Marianne (1868&#150;1922), daughter of Louis Philippe Sugnet de Montmagny. There were no children. During the 1914&#150;18 war he served with the remount service and in September 1918, after his younger son had been killed in action, he joined the Church of England. His second wife died in January 1922 and on 1 August of that year, to the mild scandal of his friends and family, he married his nurse, Emily Elizabeth Smith (1897&#150;1979), forty years his junior; they had three surviving children, two sons and a daughter.<br>
<br>In his memoir <span class="italic">Elections and Recollections</span> (1932) Pease has left a candid record of political life at the end of the nineteenth century. He had scant regard for the reputations of some famous contemporaries and wrote of John Morley: &#145;With all his historical and literary attainments, I never knew a distinguished man so destitute of any understanding of our race, or indeed any other&#146;  (Pease, <span class="italic">Elections</span>, 97). The book reveals Pease as an unflinching advocate of condign punishment: he was convinced of the deterrent value of heavy sentences&#151;what he termed &#145;the mercy of severity&#146;&#151;and supported flogging.<br>
<br>A fine horseman and an ardent fox-hunter Pease wrote an entertaining history of the hunt to which he most commonly rode: <span class="italic">The Cleveland Hounds as a Trencher-Fed Pack</span> (1887). Hunting inspired some of his best writing, and his <span class="italic">Half a Century of Sport</span> (1932) recounts diverse exploits abroad, including the pursuit of lion in Africa, ibex in the Pyrenees, and Barbary sheep in Algeria&#151;Pease rated the latter as one of the most difficult game to hunt. In England he found time to shoot, stalk, and follow otterhounds, and his <span class="italic">Hunting Reminiscences</span> (1898) has detailed chapters on hare, fox, cub, and badger hunting. Although Pease had no qualms about digging for badger, he denounced badger-baiting as &#145;a cruel and brutalizing sport&#146;. He believed that &#145;all genuine sportsmen have something of the naturalist in their composition&#146;, and in parliament advocated an extension of the legislation to protect wild birds  (Pease, <span class="italic">Hunting Reminiscences</span>, 236). Pease's attachment to the countryside of the North Riding is conveyed strongly in his <span class="italic">Dictionary of the Dialect of the North Riding of Yorkshire</span> (1928), an authoritative account on the subject. Pease died at his home at Pinchinthorpe in Guisborough, Yorkshire, on 27 April 1939.<br>
