<span class="headword">O'Brien,  Paul</span>  (1762/3&#150;1820), <span class="occ">Irish-language scholar and teacher</span>, was born in the district of Breakey in co. Meath, near its border with co. Cavan; the names of his father and mother have not been preserved. In the late eighteenth century this district was a stronghold of Irish language and culture, with a number of poets&#151;Paul O'Brien's great-grandmother had been a sister of the greatest of them, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20484/', "Turlough Carolan (1670&#150;1738)")</script>&#151;and a strong scribal tradition. It was therefore very natural that he should develop an interest in the Celtic languages and cultures. Precise dates are lacking, but it appears that, after being educated at local classical schools, in the early 1780s he travelled in Gaelic-speaking Scotland and to the Isle of Man. After his return to Ireland he went to Paris to study for the priesthood, presumably in the Irish College there. This must have been about 1790, for it is recorded that he had to flee home after a very short stay, as almost all the Irish seminaries were closed by the French Revolution at the end of 1792 and the beginning of 1793.<br>
<br>In Ireland, St Patrick's College, Maynooth, opened as a Roman Catholic seminary in 1795, but for many years it was quite unable to provide as many places as had been lost in Europe, much less absorb those individuals who had been displaced. The college authorities naturally preferred younger students, and O'Brien, already mature in years, had to wait until 1801 before being accepted. Shortly afterwards, however, he began to be noted as a person who could impart a practical knowledge of the Irish language to those students for whom it was necessary in their ministry. In 1804 he was ordained priest and appointed professor of Irish. What was expected from his course was modest; his greatest problem was the scarcity of printed books, for the native tradition of Irish learning was still of necessity a manuscript one. He had to rely on two works printed in Paris, Hugh McCurtin's <span class="italic">English&#150;Irish Dictionary and Grammar</span> (1732) and Andrew Donlevy's bilingual <span class="italic">Catechism</span> (1742). Copies of these were scarce, and this prompted him to write his own <span class="italic">Practical Grammar of the Irish Language</span>. This was delivered in 1806 to Hugh Fitzpatrick, who was already styling himself &#145;publisher to the Roman Catholic College of Maynooth&#146;. It had to wait for three years, appearing only in 1809, because Fitzpatrick was busy printing theological works for the college. The aim of the grammar, O'Brien himself said, was entirely practical, to help his students. It was heavily censured by John O'Donovan in the lengthy introduction to his own <span class="italic">Grammar</span>, published in 1845, as the worst he had met. This judgement is over-severe, but his comments on O'Brien's poetry as &#145;jungling rhyme&#146; are well directed, though by this time traditional Irish poetry had in general degenerated.<br>
<br>In the early nineteenth century efforts were made to modernize Irish literary culture specifically through printed editions of texts. O'Brien was active in a number of societies with this aim&#151;the short-lived Gaelic Society (1807) and Iberno-Celtic Society (1818), and the still-thriving Royal Irish Academy (1785). He did not live to complete a projected dictionary, dying at the college on 13 April 1820 at the age of fifty-seven. He was buried in the college cemetery. Regrettably, his books and manuscripts were auctioned and dispersed. He left fleeting but real impressions of a lively personality and a gifted teacher. In 1822, two years after his death, one of his pupils, John McEncroe, published a substantial reworking of Donlevy's <span class="italic">Catechism</span>, and another, Donal O'Sullivan, a translation of the <span class="italic">Imitation of Christ</span>. It was to be near the end of the century before Maynooth got another professor of Irish as capable as Paul O'Brien.<br>
