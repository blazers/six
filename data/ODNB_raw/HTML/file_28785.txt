<span class="headword">Warren,  Pelham</span>  (1778&#150;1835), <span class="occ">physician</span>, born in London on 7 October 1778, was the ninth son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28788/', "Richard Warren (1731&#150;1797)")</script>, physician to George III, and his wife, Elizabeth, only daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25264/', "Peter Shaw (1694&#150;1763)")</script>. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28776/', "Frederick Warren (1775&#150;1848)")</script> was his elder brother. He was educated at Dr Thompson's school at Kensington, at Westminster School, and from 1796 at Trinity College, Cambridge. He graduated MB in 1800 and MD in 1805.<br>
<br>Warren commenced practice in London immediately after he had taken his first degree in medicine, and on 6 April 1803 he was elected physician to St George's Hospital, an office which he resigned in April 1816, having established a large independent practice. He was admitted a candidate of the Royal College of Physicians in 1805, and a fellow in 1806. He was made censor in 1810, Harveian orator in 1826, and elect on 11 August 1829. He was elected fellow of the Royal Society on 8 April 1813. He married on 3 May 1814 Penelope, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25413/', "William Davies Shipley (1745&#150;1826)")</script>, dean of St Asaph. On 24 July 1830 he was gazetted physician-extraordinary to the king, but he declined the honour.<br>
<br>Warren enjoyed one of the largest practices in the metropolis. According to his contemporaries he was an accurate and careful observer of disease, and a very sound practical physician. He was an accomplished classical scholar and a strong defender of the character and independence of the medical profession. &#145;His manners were peculiar and not always pleasing, being sometimes cold and abrupt. He took a prodigious quantity of snuff, and was plain and untidy in his dress, perhaps to affectation&#146;  (<span class="italic">Medical Gazette</span>, 405).<br>
<br>Warren died at his home, Worting House, near Basingstoke, of disease of the liver on 2 December 1835, survived by his wife and seven children. He was buried in Worting church, where there is a tablet with an inscription composed by his friend and schoolfellow Henry Vincent Bayley, canon of Westminster. In 1837 his widow presented his portrait painted and engraved by John Linnell to the Royal College of Physicians.<br>
