<span class="headword">Walker,  Adam</span>  (1730/31&#150;1821), <span class="occ">itinerant lecturer and writer</span>, was born at Patterdale, Westmorland, into the numerous family of a woollen manufacturer. Neither the exact date of his birth nor the identity of his parents is known. Walker left school barely able to read but persevered alone to achieve a general education. He developed a considerable mechanical skill, constructing models of the milling machinery employed locally for fulling, grinding, and papermaking. At the age of fifteen he became assistant master at Ledham School in the West Riding of Yorkshire, and at eighteen he was appointed writing master and accountant at Macclesfield Free School, where he studied mathematics and issued his first publication, <span class="italic">A System of Family Bookkeeping, with a Ready Ruled Book</span> (1758). From 1762 to 1766 he ran a school in Manchester, teaching a range of commercial and polite subjects appropriate to the city's needs. He speculated unsuccessfully in trade, and gave lectures on astronomy.<br>
<br>Walker was probably married by this time. He and his wife, Eleanor, were living at Kirkland, Westmorland, at the time of the birth of their eldest son, <a name="cosubject_28518"></a><span class="headword">William Walker</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1766, <em>d.</em> 1816)<span class="occ"></span>. A second son, Adam John Walker (1769/70&#150;1839), was born in Newry, co. Armagh, and the youngest, <a name="cosubject_28474"></a><span class="headword">Deane Franklin Walker</span>  (1778&#150;1865)<span class="occ"></span>, in York. There was also a daughter, Eliza, who married Benjamin Gibson of Gosport.<br>
<br>In 1766 Walker bought the apparatus of the itinerant lecturer William Griffis, gave up schoolmastering, advertised his lectures in various local papers, and took to the road. He wrote the first of several extremely successful tracts: his <span class="italic">Analysis of a Course of Lectures on Natural and Experimental Philosophy</span> was first published at Kendal in 1766, and under the editorship of his sons reached its twentieth edition in 1827. Walker travelled through the north of England and southern Scotland, then spent four years in Ireland, before settling in York. Like most itinerant lecturers, Walker captured the attention of his audiences by his demonstrations. One of the most spectacular exhibits was his eidouranion, a transparent orrery, which stood the Walker family in good stead for fifty years. Walker's mechanical skill enabled him to invent and build a simple cometarium which demonstrated Kepler's first two laws of planetary motion. He was a friend of James Ferguson (<i>d</i>. 1777), one of the best-known itinerant lecturers, and on Ferguson's death acquired his eclipsareon to demonstrate the nature of eclipses, and came to give lectures in London in 1778&#150;9. This venture was successful, and in 1781 he moved his home to George Street, Hanover Square.<br>
<br>Although now based in London, Walker continued to travel. In northern towns artisans flocked to his lectures on mechanics. He was friendly with most of the eminent industrialists and scientists making up the Lunar Society, and dined with Matthew Boulton. In London he filled the Theatre Royal, Haymarket, with a staged performance of his new eidouranion. His demonstration was accompanied by the heavenly music of the coelestina, a mechanical harpsichord producing continuous sound, which Walker had patented in 1772. In his <span class="italic">Epitome of Astronomy</span> (1782), Walker announced himself lecturer to the duke of Gloucester; this tract went through thirty editions by 1824. A visit to Paris in 1785 led him to publish his views on aspects of French life; he was similarly inspired by a tour of Flanders, Germany, France and Italy, on which he commented in 1790. He lectured at the public schools of Eton, Westminster, Winchester, St Paul's, and Rugby. Between lectures Walker put his hand to improvements to various machines, a method of thermo-ventilation (patented in 1786), and plans for a rotating light which he helped to erect on St Agnes in the Isles of Scilly in 1790. He died at Richmond, Surrey, on 11 February 1821, and was buried in the family vault at Hayes, Middlesex, on 16 February, where a monument commemorated him as &#145;the inventor of the Eidouranion&#146;.<br>
<br>William Walker was baptized on 26 June 1766 at Kendal. Educated at Eton College as king's scholar, 1778&#150;80, he gave his first lecture at Newbury with his father, when only sixteen. He continued this profession until his death on 14 March 1816 at the Manor House, Hayes, Middlesex; he left a widow, Elizabeth, and four young children, all of whom died shortly afterwards from consumption. He was buried on 16 March 1816 at Hayes, and commemorated alongside his father as astronomical lecturer.<br>
<br>Adam John Walker was educated at the Royal Grammar School, Lancaster, then at the University of Cambridge, where he graduated BA in 1791 and MA in 1794. He served as rector and vicar of parishes on the Welsh border. He was vicar of Bishopstone at the time of his death, on 1 January 1839.<br>
<br>Deane Franklin Walker, born at York on 24 March 1778, continued his father's custom of lecturing at public schools and giving theatrical performances on the London stage during the winter season. He was also responsible for the later editions of his father's books. He married Ellenora, daughter of Thomas Normansell; a son and three daughters survived his death at Upper Tooting, Surrey, on 10 May 1865.<br>
