<span class="headword">Stewart, Sir  William</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1602<span class="mult">x</span>4), <span class="occ">soldier and diplomat</span>, is believed to have been the younger son of Thomas Stewart (<i>d</i>. 1542/1545), laird of Galston in Ayrshire, and his wife, Isobel, daughter of James Henderson of Fordell, justice-clerk. Of his early life all that can be said is that he is reported to have spent much of his youth in England, and that from 1570 he was servant to the earl of Lennox, regent of Scotland, and then to his widow  (<span class="italic">CSP Scot.</span>, <i>1569&#150;71</i>, 3.369). He had been recommended to Lennox by Lord Burghley, and in October 1572 he was reporting to Burghley on the activities of the French ambassador in Scotland, Philibert du Crocq.<h2>
<a name="ServiceintheNetherlands"></a>Service in the Netherlands</h2>By 1574 Stewart had gone to the Low Countries to join the growing number of Scots employed in the army of the rebel provinces of the Netherlands. Recorded in that year first as lieutenant-colonel and then colonel of Scottish forces in the service of the states of Holland, he fought in defence of Oudewater and Schoonhoven in August 1575 and of Zierikzee in Zeeland during its nine-month siege (from October 1575 to 29 July 1576), when he was responsible for bringing over more companies of soldiers from Scotland and importing arms from England. But all three towns fell to the Spanish, and after the surrender of Zierikzee Stewart took his men off to fight for the semi-independent city of Danzig, then in revolt against the king of Poland. Whether the reasons for this move were military or financial (the first of Stewart's many complaints to the Dutch authorities over arrears of pay owed to him date from this time), his change of allegiance did not outlast the peace concluded at Malborg in December 1577. By June 1578 he and eight Scottish companies under his command were again in the Netherlands and had entered the service of the states general. They played a conspicuous part in the battle of Rijmenant (1 August 1578), the states' first victory in the field over the supposedly invincible Spanish; and during the next four years Stewart's name appears frequently in the Dutch records as colonel of the 2nd Scottish regiment, commanding ten companies of foot and one of horse in Brabant and Flanders. The records also reveal his financial difficulties and deteriorating relations with his men. Every year his troops mutinied for lack of pay and in May 1582 they took their complaints to the duke of Anjou, who put Stewart under three weeks' house arrest for striking one of his own captains. When in August 1582 one of his companies garrisoned at Lier betrayed the town to the Spanish, part of the explanation given was that their captain, William Sempill, wanted &#145;revenge against Col. Stewart&#146;, who had recently punished him with the bastinado  (<span class="italic">CSP for.</span>, <i>1582</i>, 221, 240&#150;41).<h2>
<a name="Captainofthekingsguard"></a>Captain of the king's guard</h2>Early in July 1582 Stewart married Erica Bronkhorst-Batenburg, countess of Batenburg, a member of one of Gelderland's most militantly protestant families and widow of Count von Manderscheidt. Yet within two months Batenburg itself and its castle had also been surrendered to the Spanish by the garrison which Stewart had placed there, and with it his wife's dowry was lost. By this time Stewart had been recalled to Scotland, apparently on the order of Esm&eacute; Stewart, first duke of Lennox, the former regent's nephew, and he was soon carving out a new career for himself in the faction-ridden politics of the Scottish court. He attached himself first to the group of protestant, pro-English nobles who had seized power in the so-called Ruthven raid of August 1582, and it was thanks to the patronage of William Ruthven, earl of Gowrie, that he was appointed captain of the recently formed king's guard, the essential means by which the new regime secured the person of the sixteen-year-old James VI and hence kept its own grip on power.<br>
<br>In May 1583 Stewart was sent with John Colville on an embassy to the court of Elizabeth I, ostensibly to seek her advice on the king's marriage and to request a loan towards maintaining the royal guard, in which &#145;the life of our cause consists&#146;  (<span class="italic">Original Letters</span>, 26&#150;7). From Stewart's point of view, however, the real purpose of the mission was to determine whether Scotland was likely to benefit more from an alliance with England than from one with France. So when the queen's advice was forthcoming but not her money, he drew the obvious conclusion. Quarrelling with Colville, who remained loyal to the English connection, and abandoning his patron Gowrie, he returned to Scotland in June and used the forces of the guard to provide support for the counter-revolution by which James VI freed himself from the Ruthven regime and restored the pro-French James Stewart, earl of Arran, to power. On 29 August 1583 Stewart was made a member of the privy council of Scotland, and the following spring he overthrew a plot against Arran, capturing Gowrie in his castle at Dundee and defeating what remained of his supporters at Stirling. For all this he was duly rewarded&#151;first, in July 1583, with the lands and priory of Pittenweem, of which he was appointed commendator, and then in December 1584 with a grant from the revenues of Dunfermline Abbey. At the same time there is evidence that the troops under his command were being better paid and were growing in numbers. In the summer of 1584 he was urging veteran Scots in the Netherlands to return home and enlist in the king's guard, with the promise of &#145;satisfaction for what the States owe them&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP for.</span>, <i>1584&#150;5</i>, 19.54). The following April he led them against another of Arran's enemies, the Roman Catholic convert Lord Maxwell, in the borders.<h2>
<a name="ReturntotheLowCountries"></a>Return to the Low Countries</h2>Stewart's power was now at its height. &#145;Accounted the great man in Scotland&#146; by soldiers  (<span class="italic">CSP for.</span>, <i>1584&#150;5</i>, 19.54), he was seen by diplomats as &#145;the chief ruler&#146; at court, vying with Arran for influence over the young king  (<span class="italic">CSP Scot.</span>, <i>1581&#150;3</i>, 6.649). But this situation did not last. Early in November 1585 Arran was overthrown in a coup engineered by the English ambassador, Sir Edward Wotton; and Stewart, who had sought to halt the advancing forces of Angus and the other formerly exiled earls at Jedburgh, was dismissed from his captaincy and placed in the custody of Maxwell at Dumfries. Characteristically, however, he soon adjusted to the change of circumstances, making friends with Maxwell and even reappearing at court during the early months of 1586. Granted licence to travel abroad, he was in Denmark by November, persuading King Frederik II (as he had earlier persuaded James VI and his mother) to intercede with the Spanish authorities for the return of his wife's property in Gelderland. However, only when he went on to the Netherlands himself in 1587, appealing directly to the prince of Parma, was the property finally restored.<br>
<br>By this time he had also become involved in the intrigues of Lord Maxwell and the sixth earl of Huntly to mount a Catholic uprising in Scotland with Spanish assistance. While Maxwell himself was in Portugal and Spain canvassing support, Stewart (from December 1586 and intermittently during 1587) had conversations with Parma and with the Spanish ambassador in Paris, Mendoza, in which he presented himself as the agent of &#145;certain Scottish Catholic nobles&#146;, explaining their plans to seize King James, re-establish Catholicism in Scotland, and then move against the queen of England  (<span class="italic">CSP Spain</span>, <i>1580&#150;86</i>, 3.681&#150;2).<br>
<br>Yet if Stewart really believed that the king could be drawn into a league of Catholic powers against Elizabeth, he abandoned the notion soon after returning to the Scottish court in spring 1588. Faced by growing dissension among the Catholic earls, and (from August) by the defeat and dispersal of the Spanish Armada, he realized that there was little prospect of persuading James into alliance with Spain &#145;for the revenge of the wrongs done him by his mother's [Mary's] death&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP Scot.</span>, <i>1586&#150;9</i>, 9.613). When the scheme was put to the king in September, James's response was dismissive, and Stewart quickly cut his links with the Catholic conspirators.<br>
<br>Instead Stewart took up the matter of pay arrears which he claimed were still owing to him and to his regiment from the time of his military service in the Low Countries between 1578 and 1582. Having sought a settlement for some years without success, he now obtained from James VI an undertaking to grant him letters of marque to attack Dutch merchant ships if payment continued to be withheld. This was a serious threat to the commercial economy of the Netherlands and provoked an immediate response from The Hague. The states general sent three special embassies&#151;one to London in October 1588, asking Queen Elizabeth &#145;to interpose her authority&#146; in order to prevent the Scots resorting to reprisals  (<span class="italic">CSP for.</span>, <i>1588</i>, 22.221); another the following May to Edinburgh, where the same request was made to James VI; and a third in November 1589 to discuss Stewart's claim with the Scottish privy council. Not until July 1593, however, when Stewart was at The Hague on a mission concerned primarily with the formation of an anti-Catholic league, was a settlement finally agreed, under which he was paid arrears of 56,000 florins on condition that he surrender to the states general the letters of marque granted to him.<br>
<br>Commenting on this negotiation the English envoy George Gilpin remarked that Stewart had &#145;sped better than ever I knew any other afore him&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP for.</span>, <i>1593&#150;4</i>); and there can be no doubt that he was a diplomat of considerable ability, despite his blunt manner and relative lack of education, which prevented him from conversing in Latin. In addition to this embassy he was sent several times to Denmark, initially to negotiate King James's marriage to the Princess Anne and later, in 1598, to seek Danish support for James's right of succession to the English throne. In the summer of 1590, at Brunswick and other north German courts, he put forward the king's rather utopian proposals for securing European peace through mediation; and in February 1595 he returned to The Hague with the more mundane task of negotiating a loan of 1500 men to fight the Roman Catholic earls in Scotland.<h2>
<a name="Lastyearsandsecondmarriage"></a>Last years and second marriage</h2>A few years earlier, during the first domestic crisis of James VI's personal rule in 1592, Stewart had been twice accused of collaborating in the fifth earl of Bothwell's raids on Holyrood and other royal palaces and was briefly imprisoned in Edinburgh Castle. But the charges against him were not pressed. Nor apparently did they have any lasting effect on the attitude of the king, who continued to employ, and reward, his services. Reappointed to the privy council in 1590, Stewart was knighted in 1594 on the occasion of the baptism of Prince Henry, and the same year was granted the lands of Houston (though he sold the estate within five years). As part of James VI's policy of taming the Gaelic highlands and isles, he received a commission of lieutenancy in June 1596, and he mounted an expedition to Kintyre, where he took &#145;pledges of certain of the clans of the country for their dutiful obedience&#146;  (<span class="italic">Reg. PCS</span>, 5.324). Two years later he was nominated to a committee considering the establishment of three royal burghs in the region; and he was one of the group of lowland entrepreneurs who tried, without success, to colonize the Isle of Lewis in 1598&#150;9. His last recorded appointment, in 1602, was to the Scottish council of war providing armed assistance for Queen Elizabeth's forces in Ireland.<br>
<br>Evidence of Stewart's family life is fragmentary. From his marriage to Lady Batenburg he had a son, who died young, and possibly other children: the duke of Batenburg mentioned as his &#145;guid son&#146; in a letter of 1595 was presumably his son-in-law  (<span class="italic">CSP for.</span>, <i>1595</i>, 262). On 7 June 1590 Stewart married Isobel, daughter of Sir Patrick Hepburn of Waughton and widow of George Halkett of Pitfirrane, provost of Edinburgh, in Holyrood church; the children of this marriage were Frederick (1591&#150;1625), created Lord Pittenweem in 1609, and Anna (<i>b</i>. 1595). It is unclear whether his first marriage had meanwhile been dissolved: probably not, since in 1592 he was accused of being &#145;infamous by marriage of sundry wives living&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP Scot.</span>, <i>1589&#150;93</i>, 758). The date of Stewart's death is unknown, though it must have been before 27 December 1604, when he was mentioned in a charter as the late Sir William Stewart.<br>
<br>According to one of his fellow captains in Flanders, Stewart was &#145;a man without religion, avaricious and ambitious&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP for.</span>, <i>1583&#150;4</i>, 18.153). But perhaps a fairer assessment of his character is to be found in letters of two of his fellow diplomats, Mendoza and Menainville. They described him as a <i>politique</i> in religion, an adventurer &#145;with his own fortune at heart&#146; who had to &#145;trim with the times&#146; (<span class="italic">CSP Spain</span>, <i>1580&#150;86</i>, 3.682; Tytler, 8.156). He was certainly, in Mendoza's phrase, &#145;a man of influence and a soldier to whom the king [James VI] is much attached&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP Spain</span>, <i>1580&#150;86</i>, 3.682). If he was also a man preoccupied with money and nearly always short of it, that is hardly surprising. As a younger son, he had inherited little; and he lived in an age when soldiers were paid irregularly and inadequately and diplomats were often expected to finance themselves.<br>
