<span class="headword">Bulmer, Sir  Bevis</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1613), <span class="occ">courtier and mining projector</span>, whose origins are shrouded in mystery, was a close friend of both Queen Elizabeth and James VI and I. Stephen Atkinson, his refiner of ores and a constant companion after 1587, wrote an account of Bulmer's activities in 1619, describing him as an &#145;ingenious gent&#146;  (Atkinson, preface), and elsewhere Bulmer was referred to as &#145;Bulmer the Projector&#146;  (Surtees, pt 2, 78). He is known to have had a son, John, and two daughters, Elizabeth and Prudence.<br>
<br>Bulmer began his career at a group of mines near Clitheroe in the north of England, but his first major work was at Leadhills in Lanarkshire in 1576. His next project was established at Chewton minery in the Mendip hills, Somerset, in 1586, when Queen Elizabeth was one of his financial backers. The following year a silver-rich lead vein was discovered at Combe Martin in Devon, and Adrian Gilbert, one of the leaseholders and brother of Sir John Gilbert, the navigator, granted Bulmer a moiety of the lease. For the next two years each of the partners was reputed to have received &pound;10,000 profit, but by 1590 this had declined to &pound;1000. Bulmer also refined ore from the Irish mines of the Society of Mines Royal at Combe Martin.<br>
<br>In 1593 Bulmer began the construction of a horse-driven chain pump at Broken Wharf near St Paul's Cathedral to bring drinking-water from the Thames to the Cheapside area of London. To commemorate the pump's completion in 1595 he presented a tankard made from Combe Martin silver to Sir Richard Martin, master of the mint and lord mayor of London. This was engraved with a portrait of Bulmer and the following verse:<blockquote>
<div>When waterworks in Broaken Wharf<br>
</div>
<div>At first erected Weare,<br>
</div>
<div>And Bevis Bulmer with his art<br>
</div>
<div>The waters 'gan to reare.<br>
</div> (Hoyle, 55&#150;6)</blockquote>This tankard was subsequently melted down, but three other dome-top tankards bearing the inscription &#145;the gift of Bevis Bullmer&#146; were still in the Mansion House collection in the City of London some 400 years later.<br>
<br>In 1593 Bulmer obtained letters of recommendation from the queen to the Scottish government, who granted him a patent to search for gold and silver at Leadhills. For the next two years he prospected for alluvial gold in the Lowther hills and built a house at Glengonnar near Leadhills where, according to Atkinson, he lived in great splendour. It is his behaviour here, described by Atkinson, that provides an insight into his attitude to wealth. In Atkinson's words, &#145;he wasted much himselfe, and gave liberally to many, for to be honoured, praised, and magnified, else he might have bin a rich subject; for the least of these frugalities [<i>sic</i>] were able to robb an abbott&#146;  (Hoyle, 43). Bulmer later returned to London and presented a porringer made from Lowther gold to Queen Elizabeth, inscribed:<blockquote>
<div>I dare not give, nor yet present,<br>
</div>
<div>But render parte of that's thine owne<br>
</div>
<div>My minde and hart, shall still invent<br>
</div>
<div>To seeke out treasure, yet unknown.<br>
</div> (ibid., 43)</blockquote>This gift endeared him to the queen and he became a regular attender at court. In 1599 he was granted the farm of the duty on all seaborne coal and the duty on import of wines and he unsuccessfully tendered for the right of pre-emption of Cornish tin. He also received royal patents for two of his inventions: one in 1584 for a lighthouse and another in 1588 for a water-powered nail-making machine, which was used in a mill built at Dartford.<br>
<br>In 1603 King James devised with Bulmer a &#145;Plott&#146; whereby they were to finance the search for gold in Scotland. The king would reward investors with a knighthood, and they would become one of the &#145;knights of the golden mines&#146; or &#145;golden knights&#146;. Unfortunately this scheme fell through owing to the interference of Robert Cecil. However, Bulmer was knighted in 1604, and after receiving &pound;100 as a &#145;free gift&#146; from the king  (Jenkins, 402) along with &pound;200 &#145;to be employed about the gold mines in Scotland&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1603&#150;10</i>, 68) he returned to Scotland to hunt for gold in the Lowther hills. In 1606 he was granted a lease of all gold and silver mines in Scotland and received further gifts of &pound;100 and &pound;500 from the king in 1607 and 1608 respectively.<br>
<br>In 1608 a silver-rich mine was discovered at Hilderstone near Linlithgow, which the king had purchased from Sir Thomas Hamilton. Sir Bevis was granted &pound;2419 16<i>s</i>. 10<i>d</i>. to finance the works and he was appointed master and surveyor; but after two years the venture proved a financial disaster for James. Bulmer then moved to Ireland and from 1611 to 1612 mined at Kilmore in co. Tipperary. After borrowing &pound;340 from Atkinson he returned to England and died penniless at Randalholme, Alston Moor, Cumberland, in September 1613.<br>
<br>Despite his ignominious end, Sir Bevis Bulmer was one of the earliest British mining entrepreneurs to acquire a national reputation. His stature was such that he was caricatured in Ben Jonson's <span class="italic">Staple of News</span> (1625) in which a character asks:<blockquote>
<div>Did I not tell you I was bred in the mines<br>
</div>
<div>Under Sir Bevis Bullion?<br>
</div> (quoted in Hobson, fol. 14)</blockquote>
