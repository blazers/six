<span class="headword">Ferman,  James Alan</span>  (1930&#150;2002), <span class="occ">film censor</span>, was born James Alan Feuerman on 11 April 1930 in New York city, the only son and the elder of two children of Sol Sidney Feuerman, a film producer and medical film editor, and his wife, Muriel, a teacher. Educated at Great Neck high school and Cornell University (1948&#150;51), where he graduated in English, he then served in the US Air Force, being posted to the Bentwaters base, near Woodbridge, Suffolk. After leaving the air force he returned to Britain, and studied for an MA at King's College, Cambridge, under F. R. Leavis. He lived in Britain for the rest of his life, although he retained his American nationality. On 16 June 1956 he married Monica Sophie Beament, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Robinson, a 31-year-old secretary, whose previous marriage had been dissolved. She was the daughter of Walter Robinson, restaurateur. They had a daughter, Lucy, and a son, John. While at Cambridge, Ferman (who had changed his name by deed poll before living in Britain) wrote <span class="italic">Zuleika</span>, a musical adaptation of Max Beerbohm's comedy <span class="italic">Zuleika Dobson</span>, which was successfully presented in the West End in 1957.<br>
<br>In 1957 Ferman joined the Associated Broadcasting Company (ABC), the independent television contractor, as a trainee director. He directed three plays for the <span class="italic">Armchair Theatre</span> series, <span class="italic">The Criminals</span> (1958), <span class="italic">Till Death Us Do Part</span> (1959), and Wolf Mankowitz's adaptation of Jacques Duval's comedy <span class="italic">The Model Marriage</span> (1959). Transferring to Associated Television (ATV), he worked on <span class="italic">Emergency Ward 10</span>, a long-running medical series, and was principal director of <span class="italic">The Plane Makers</span> (a drama series about the aviation industry, which won an SFTA award in 1963), <span class="italic">Miss Hanago</span> (which was the ATV entry for the Monte Carlo festival in 1965), <span class="italic">Kafka's America</span> (which won the Critics' Circle award in 1966), and an adaptation of Somerset Maugham's <span class="italic">Before the Party</span> (which won a BAFTA award in 1970). From 1965 he worked as a freelance, mainly for the BBC; he also worked occasionally as a stage producer and director. An interest in social problems, particularly drug addiction, led him to produce <span class="italic">Drugs and Schoolchildren</span>, a five-part documentary series for teachers and social workers, and to take a part-time job as lecturer in community studies from 1973 to 1976 at the Polytechnic of Central London, where he was also director and chairman of the community mental health programme.<br>
<br>In mid-1975 Ferman was appointed secretary of the British Board of Film Censors (BBFC), a position he occupied (from 1985 with the title of director) until his retirement at the end of 1998. At the time of his appointment the BBFC had been under fire for several years from opponents of the 1960s &#145;permissive society&#146;, who had had unprecedented recourse to the use of common law against films, with varying outcomes, which had created confusion within the film industry and at the BBFC. Ferman's liberal instinct, tempered by his social conscience, led him to spearhead film industry pressure on the Home Office to prohibit common law private prosecutions against films, and instead bring films within the scope of the 1959 <span class="roman">Obscene Publications Act</span>. His efforts eventually succeeded, and from 1977 films became subject to the act's test of obscenity, as the &#145;tendency to deprave and corrupt, taken as a whole&#146;. He regarded this as his greatest achievement, and no BBFC-certificated film or video was subsequently found guilty of obscenity.<br>
<br>Nevertheless by the early 1980s the film industry and the BBFC came under the spotlight in relation to newly marketed extreme horror videos, so-called &#145;video nasties&#146;. The outcome was a form of state censorship of videos in the shape of the 1984 <span class="roman">Video Recordings Act</span>, which the BBFC was called upon to operate. Although Ferman was never convinced that this act was necessary, he and the president of the BBFC, Lord Harlech, did much to shape its final provisions through negotiations with the Home Office. Ferman went on to supervise the act's implementation, and the physical expansion and modernization of the BBFC that this entailed.<br>
<br>Until the late 1980s Ferman proved to be a relatively uncontroversial censor, but thereafter his decisions were increasingly criticized by some sections of the media, who again blamed video viewing for an increase in violence, and in particular several exceptionally nasty murders. He consequently felt obliged during this period to tread cautiously over films and videos with extremely violent or sexually explicit content, but even so he continued to take liberal decisions, a sufficient number of these to render him a key target for parliamentary moral crusaders amid a fierce anti-BBFC campaign led by the <span class="italic">Daily Mail</span>. A disagreement in 1997 with the new home secretary, Jack Straw, over policy on classification of pornographic videos and a simultaneous failure to prevent Straw from imposing a new president upon the BBFC formed the immediate prelude to Ferman's retirement in 1998.<br>
<br>Within the film industry and the BBFC Ferman was widely admired and respected, though he was unable to establish a rapport with the burgeoning video industry. At the BBFC his administrative reforms included the first censorship training programmes, while he inaugurated international censorship conferences with the over-optimistic aim of harmonizing film and video censorship among the world's democracies. He took endless trouble to allow a film or video if possible, often personally editing a work to make it conform to his requirements. A gifted perfectionist and workaholic, he was occasionally difficult with his colleagues, and the staff expansion which the <span class="roman">Video Recording Act</span> forced upon the BBFC brought him into protracted conflict with some of the younger censors. This tension became public in 1994, and the media's coverage tended to reinforce his authoritarian image, but he never spared himself on the BBFC's behalf and accusations against him of undue secrecy were ill founded. Arguably he remained too long in a demanding post always involving a delicate balance between libertarians and advocates of strict censorship, but his mistakes were few within a heavy workload. In effect he became a personification of the BBFC and probably performed his duties as well as was humanly possible. He certainly left the BBFC in a far more flourishing condition than he found it. His retirement was short and plagued by ill health. Suffering from cancer of the prostate, he died of septicaemia and pneumonia at the Royal Free Hospital, Camden, London, on 24 December 2002. He was survived by his wife, Monica, and their two children.<br>
