<span class="headword">Dodson, Sir  Derek Sherborne Lindsell</span>  (1920&#150;2003), <span class="occ">soldier and diplomatist</span>, was born on 20 January 1920 at 25 Grange Road, Cambridge, the eldest son of Charles Sherborne Dodson, a Lincolnshire GP, and his wife, Irene Frances, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Lindsell. He was educated at Flete House, Westgate-on-Sea (1929&#150;33), Stowe School (1934&#150;6), and the Royal Military College, Sandhurst (1938&#150;9), where he won &#145;the saddle&#146; as the best horseman of his year.<br>
<br>On 3 July 1939 Dodson was commissioned into the Royal Scots fusiliers as a second lieutenant and was posted to join their 1st battalion in India. In 1940, after Dunkirk, he returned with that battalion to England. In 1941 he joined the Special Operations Executive and in 1942 was sent to its headquarters in Cairo, which controlled its operations in south-east Europe. In September 1943, after the Italian armistice, he was flown to an isolated strip near Kardhitsa in Thessaly with orders to report on the Germans' positions, and obtained from General Adolfo Infante, the commander of the Italian Pinerolo division, the complete order of battle of the axis forces in south-eastern Europe. In January 1944 he made his second visit to Greece, being parachuted into Epirus to meet Napoleon Zervas, the main non-communist guerrilla leader, who was being harassed by the pro-communist EAM/ELAS forces. In August 1944, as the German forces pulled out of Greece, Dodson was again parachuted into Thessaly and hitched a ride on a fire engine into Athens, where he was carried shoulder high by an enthusiastic crowd. A few weeks later he followed the Germans north, being the first allied soldier to enter Salonika. In April 1945, as the Germans retreated north in Italy, he called together local Italian guerrilla leaders to plan an attack on Turin. On 26 April he personally led the group which entered the city from the east, and later organized partisan operations against Chivasso and Carmagnola. The citation for the MC which he was awarded for these operations said that he had shown outstanding leadership and courage, and also tact, which had enabled him to gain the confidence of the Italian partisans. In 1945&#150;6 Dodson served as military assistant to the British member of the allied control commission in Bulgaria, where he first met his future wife, Julie Maynard Barnes (1925&#150;1992), the daughter of the American minister Maynard Barnes. Then in 1946&#150;7 he served as a general staff officer (grade 3) in the War Office.<br>
<br>Bored with the prospect of a peacetime military career, in January 1948 Dodson obtained entry to the foreign service. After a few months in the Foreign Office he was sent to Salonika, where his wartime experience and the knowledge of Greek which he had gained proved useful. He served as vice-consul, and acted as consul-general in 1949 and 1950. In 1951 he was transferred to the embassy in Madrid, first as a second and then from October as a first secretary. In 1952 he married Julie Barnes in Paris; they had two children, Gerald and Caroline. In 1953 he returned to the Foreign Office, first to the personnel department and then in 1955 as private secretary to the minister of state, first Anthony Nutting, whom he supported through the trauma of Suez and Nutting's resignation, and then Allan Noble. In November 1958 he was transferred to Prague as head of chancery and acted as charg&eacute; d'affaires there in 1959, 1960, 1961, and 1962. In 1962 he was appointed consul in Elisabethville, capital of the copper-rich province of Katanga. He established close relations with Moise Tshombe, then in secession from the central Congo government in Leopoldville, but was coshed and bloodied when he confronted a crowd of Rhodesian protesters stoning the consulate-general. He fainted, and later said that his life was saved by his secretary, who bandaged his head with her petticoat before he was taken to hospital. In 1963 he was appointed CMG and returned to head the Foreign Office's central department, where he dealt with a ferocious workload including difficult relations with Greece and Turkey over the 1963&#150;4 crisis in Cyprus, and between Franco's Spain and the new British Labour government. After that he was happy to enjoy life in Greece from 1966 to 1969 as counsellor and deputy to his friend the ambassador, Sir Michael Stewart, though those years included the seizure of power by the colonels.<br>
<br>Dodson's first ambassadorial appointment was as ambassador to Hungary from 1970 to 1973, where he and his wife, Julie, were able to exercise their talent for entertaining, their guests including Prince Philip. In September 1973 he was transferred to Brazil, being the first British ambassador to be based in Brasilia, where President Ernesto Geisel required all ministers to reside and British bankers and businessmen came to lobby Brazilian ministers. Export promotion included the British trade fair in S&atilde;o Paulo in 1964, opened by Princess Alexandra. In 1975 Dodson accompanied President Geisel on his state visit to Britain and was appointed KCMG and given the Brazilian order of the Southern Cross. Dodson's last embassy was Ankara from 1977 to 1980. Despite internal unrest and financial stringency Turkey was an important member of NATO and CENTO, and Dodson handled relations with the alternating governments of S&uuml;leyman Demirel and B&uuml;lent Ecevit with skill.<br>
<br>In retirement Dodson undertook numerous duties, including that of British member of the board of the Benguela Railway Company, plagued by the Angolan civil war, from 1984 to 1992. In November 1992 his first wife, Julie, died of cancer in their London home, and in 1997 he married Rania Massouridis (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Papadam), whom he had known for many years. Thereafter he spent much of his last years happily in their house in Thessaly. Operated on for cancer in 1999, he made a rapid recovery, but the cancer spread and on 22 November 2003 he died in Pelasgia, where he was buried. He was survived by his wife, Rania, two stepsons, and the son and daughter of his first marriage.<br>
