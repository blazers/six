<span class="headword">Manners <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Lindsay]</span>,  (Marion Margaret) Violet</span>, duchess of Rutland  (1856&#150;1937), <span class="occ">artist</span>, was born on 7 March 1856, the second daughter of Charles Hugh Lindsay (1816&#150;1889), son of the twenty-fourth earl of Crawford, soldier and courtier, and Emilia Anne Browne (<i>d</i>. 1873), the daughter of the dean of Lismore. Two of her four brothers and both of her sisters died in infancy or childhood. She was educated privately. Her early interest in art was fostered by her family&#151;the aesthete Sir Coutts Lindsay was a distant cousin&#151;and by a lengthy visit to Italy, although she had no formal training. Sir Coutts opened his Grosvenor Gallery in 1877, and Violet Lindsay was among the early exhibitors of both drawings and sculptures. Her many drawings of the men and women of her social circle, in silver-point or pencil, constituted her most successful work, and she exhibited extensively throughout her life at all the major British galleries (including the Fine Art Society, the Royal Academy, and the New Gallery) and in France and the United States. &#145;Her style&#146;, commented a reviewer of an exhibition of her drawings at the Brook Street Art Galleries, London, in 1925, &#145;is particularly suited to the interpretation of feminine beauty and elegance, but she usually achieves considerable success in her delineations of men&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Connoisseur</span>, 188). A selection of her portraits was published in 1900 as <span class="italic">Portraits of Men and Women</span>.<br>
<br>On 25 November 1882 Violet Lindsay married, at St George's, Hanover Square, London, Henry John Brinsley Manners (1852&#150;1925), who in 1888 became marquess of Granby, and in 1906 succeeded his father as eighth duke of Rutland. Manners, who was conventionally handsome, politically Conservative, and aristocratically philistine, had little in common with his radiant, bohemian wife. Having provided her husband with a daughter and two sons to ensure the legitimate succession of the peerage, Violet proceeded to amuse herself without him: her second daughter, Violet (Letty), was apparently fathered by Disraeli's former private secretary, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32576/', "Montague Corry, Baron Rowton (1838&#150;1903)")</script>, and the third, Diana, by Harry Cust [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32683/', "Cust, Henry John Cockayne (1861&#150;1917)")</script>]. Socially, Lady Granby (as she became in 1888, the year of her liaison with Rowton) moved in very different circles from those of her husband, whose tastes favoured the hunting field and the chorus line at the theatre. She was one of the central figures of the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/42005', "Souls")</script>, the group of aristocratic friends which formed around A. J. Balfour and the Tennant sisters in the last decades of the nineteenth century. The Souls prided themselves on their intellectual interests, their avant-garde artistic taste, and their cultural sophistication, and Violet Granby, as the most talented practical artist among them, enjoyed special status. Her beauty, captured in portraits by many hands, including those of G. F. Watts, J. J. Shannon, and her own, was of the type most admired by the Souls. Her auburn hair, pale complexion, hooded eyes, and very slim figure were invariably set off by her Aesthetic-style clothes of faded colours and soft drapings: Mrs Patrick Campbell once described her as &#145;the most beautiful thing I ever saw&#146;  (Lambert, 79).<br>
<br>The death of her eldest son, Lord Haddon, in 1894 at the age of nine, devastated Violet Granby, who poured all her grief into sculpting his tomb. She considered the plaster of his recumbent figure on an elaborate base decorated with relief portraits of her family to be her finest work, and kept it in her London house until a month before her death in 1937 it was accepted by the Tate Gallery. Lady Granby (who became duchess of Rutland in 1906) was entirely serious about her art, considering herself a professional, but her reputation undoubtedly suffered because of her rank. At a time when few women were able to make names for themselves as artists, she laboured under the dual handicap of gender and a title: if women could not aspire to &#145;genius&#146;, how much less so could a woman who, because of her social position, was inevitably viewed as a dilettante.<br>
<br>The duchess of Rutland's other passion was for the theatre. Among her closest friends were the actor&#150;manager Sir Herbert Beerbohm Tree and his wife and three daughters, and she encouraged her own daughters to take walk-on parts in his productions. Entirely at home with actors and in the theatre, Violet Rutland pushed the boundaries of acceptable bohemianism, even among the Souls. Her unconventionality was mirrored by that of her youngest daughter, leader of the younger generation of Souls who styled themselves the Corrupt Coterie; she eventually married to become <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/40701/', "Lady Diana Cooper")</script>.<br>
<br>The duchess was spared some of the tragedy of the First World War which decimated the ranks of the children of the Souls: her only surviving son was kept away from the fighting front, married into another Souls family, and lived. But her second daughter, Letty, lost her husband, Lord Elcho, in the Egyptian campaign of 1916, while Diana Manners saw most of her friends and suitors killed on the western front. The duchess converted 16 Arlington Street into a hospital for the duration of the war. After the death of her husband in 1925, she sold the Arlington Street house and moved to 34 Chapel Street, Belgrave Square, London, where she had a new studio built and continued to work. She exhibited throughout the 1920s and 1930s, holding her last exhibition in November 1937. She retained the vestiges of her looks, as Chips Channon observed at a ball at Belvoir, Leicestershire, in 1935: &#145;I thought that old Violet Duchess looked the best, tired, eighty, and in white; she was a romantic, rather triste figure in a castle where she had reigned so long&#146;  (Abdy and Gere, 53). Violet Rutland died at her Chapel Street home on 22 December 1937 following an operation, and was buried at Belvoir, Leicestershire.<br>
