<span class="headword">Arundell,  Francis Vyvyan Jago</span>  (1780&#150;1846), <span class="occ">antiquary and traveller</span>, was born at Launceston, Cornwall, in July 1780, the only son of Thomas Jago, a solicitor in that town, and his wife, Catherine, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Bolt, daughter of a surgeon at Launceston. He was educated at Liskeard grammar school and at Exeter College, Oxford, where he obtained his BA in 1801 and proceeded MA in 1809. Following his ordination, he was appointed curate at Antony in his native county and in 1805 was instituted to the rectory of Landulph on the banks of the Tamar. Throughout his life he pursued a wide range of antiquarian interests and worked with great enthusiasm for many years on the history of Cornwall. He was elected FSA on 30 May 1811; in April 1845 he was removed from the fellowship for being twenty-eight years in arrears with his subscription.<br>
<br>Jago's Cornish interests resulted in several publications. When Nicholas Condy, an artist in Plymouth, published a series of views of Cotehele, the ancient seat of Lord Mount Edgcumbe, Jago wrote the description of the house which accompanied them. In the church of Landulph is a brass to the memory of Theodore Palaeologus, descended from the last of the Christian emperors of Greece, who died on 21 January 1637. Jago's account of this inscription, and of the person whom it commemorated, was printed in <span class="italic">Archaeologia</span> in 1817. This paper was subsequently expanded into <span class="italic">Some Notice of the Church of Landulph</span>, published in 1840. Jago also gave great assistance to the brothers Lysons in their history of Cornwall, and at one time himself contemplated the publication of a history of the county.<br>
<br>One of Jago's ancestors had married a coheir of John Arundell of Trevarnoe, and Jago assumed that name in addition to his own on 25 February 1815. On 17 October 1816 he married Anna Maria (<i>d</i>. 1869), second daughter of Isaac Morier, consul-general at Constantinople, and sister of James Morier, the diplomatist and novelist.<br>
<br>Arundell's marriage seems to have led to his appointment, in 1822, as chaplain to the British factory at Smyrna, where he remained for fourteen years. Soon after settling at Smyrna, he arranged a tour of exploration in Asia Minor. The months from March to September 1826 were spent in a pilgrimage to the seven churches of Asia and an excursion into Pisidia, a narrative of which was published in 1828. This book was very favourably received, and with this encouragement he ventured in 1833 upon another tour of 1000 miles through districts which until then had for the most part not been described by any European traveller. He made a particular study of the ruins of Antioch in Pisidia, and two volumes describing these discoveries were published in 1834. Although Arundell made a third tour in 1835&#150;6 through Palestine, no account of his travels was published. While living at Smyrna he made large collections of antiquities, coins, and manuscripts; on his return to England the coins were sold to the British Museum. The materials that he collected for histories of Smyrna and of his native town of Launceston were never used, and are probably lost. Arundell died at Landulph on 5 December 1846, and was buried on 11 December in the church, not far from the tomb of Palaeologus.<br>
