<span class="headword">Denton,  Henry</span>  (<em>c.</em>1640&#150;1681), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and translator</span>, was the second son of Thomas Denton (1612&#150;1643), from an old Cumberland family living at Warnell Hall, Warnell Denton, south of Carlisle, and Lettis (<i>d</i>. 1678), daughter of John Lougher, of Perton, Staffordshire, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9523/', "Mary Fitton")</script>, maid of honour to Elizabeth I. On 24 June 1653 he matriculated at Queen's College, Oxford, together with his elder brother Thomas [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/74666/', "Denton, John")</script>]. At Queen's he had as his chamber fellow, and perhaps tutor, William Lamplugh, afterwards archbishop of York. He graduated BA on 21 March 1656 and MA on 25 June 1659. He had also proved himself an accomplished violinist. In 1660 he became a fellow of Queen's College, succeeding to the rooms of his friend Joseph Williamson, who had left academic for political life.<br>
<br>In autumn 1664, on the recommendation of Sir Heneage Finch, the Levant Company appointed Denton chaplain to the English ambassador in Constantinople, Sir Heneage's cousin Heneage Finch, earl of Winchilsea. Denton set out early in 1665, stopped to preach in Smyrna, and favourably impressed Winchilsea, who described him as &#145;a modest, ingenious person&#146;  (<span class="italic">Finch MSS</span>, 389). In Constantinople, Denton is said to have mastered Arabic, Syriac, and Slavonic, and the Turkish-Latin grammar by the Polish interpreter Albert Bobowski (known as Ali Bey) which Denton brought back to Oxford (Bodl. Oxf., Hyde MS 43) suggests that he was well advanced in the study of Turkish. On his return to England after Winchilsea's recall late in 1668 Denton took up residence at Queen's College. In 1673, the year in which he seems to have married an Oxford woman whose surname was Ellis and with whom he had at least one son, baptized on 22 March 1681, the provost and fellows gave him the nearby living of Bletchingdon.<br>
<br>Like his successors at the embassy in Constantinople, Thomas Smith (his friend and near contemporary at Queen's) and John Covel, Denton took an interest in the Greek Orthodox church when he was in the Levant. He befriended Joseph Georgirenes, archbishop of Samos, and their friendship continued when Georgirenes came to England in 1676 to have a liturgical work printed for his parishioners. Georgirenes soon became involved in the plan to build a church for the Greek colony in London. (The church in Soho Fields was to give its name to Greek Street.) Hoping to raise money for it, he wrote his <span class="italic">Description of the Present State of Samos, Nicaria, Patmos, and Mount Athos</span> (1678). Dedicated to the duke of York (later James II) and strongly anti-Turkish and anti-Venetian, the text was translated into English by Denton, who added explanatory notes and an epistle to the reader emphasizing the points of agreement between the Greek church and the Church of England.<br>
<br>Denton died at Bletchingdon on 18 August 1681 and was buried in the parish church two days later.<br>
