<span class="headword">Maty,  Matthew</span>  (1718&#150;1776), <span class="occ">physician and librarian</span>, was born on 17 May 1718 at Montfoort, 6 miles south-west of Utrecht, the eldest child of Paul Maty (1681&#150;1773), French protestant minister, and his wife, Jeanne Crottier Desmarets. Both parents were Huguenots. Before moving to the Netherlands the Maty family, which originated in the &Icirc;le de R&eacute;, had lived in Dauphin&eacute;, and the Crottier Desmarets family of Amsterdam were refugees from Lyons. After being educated at Utrecht University, Paul Maty was ordained in 1709 and became minister to the Huguenots of Montfoort. As the congregation there was small he moved to The Hague, where he became a teacher. A book on the Trinity which he published in 1729 led to his excommunication by synods at Kampen and The Hague in 1730. Having failed to establish himself in England he moved to Leiden in 1731 and joined the remonstrant church. After Matthew moved to London, Paul lived for much of the rest of his life with him, and died in Matthew's apartments in the British Museum on 21 March 1773.<br>
<br>Matthew Maty entered Leiden University on 31 March 1732 and studied philosophy and medicine; he submitted dissertations in both fields which gained him doctorates in 1740. He was taught medicine by the noted physician Herman Boerhaave (1668&#150;1738), of whom he published a life in 1747. A French version of Maty's philosophical dissertation (entitled <span class="italic">Essai sur l'usage</span>) was published at Utrecht in 1741.<br>
<br>At the end of 1740 Maty and his parents moved to London, where he practised medicine and became a contributor to the <span class="italic">Biblioth&egrave;que Britannique</span> (The Hague, 1732&#150;47) and the <span class="italic">Biblioth&egrave;que raisonn&eacute;e des ouvrages des savans de l'Europe</span> (Amsterdam, 1728&#150;53). He became known in London literary circles as a result of frequenting various coffee houses, and made the acquaintance of notable figures in the medical world, such as Dr Richard Mead (whose life Maty wrote in 1755, expanded from an article in the <span class="italic">Journal Britannique</span> of 1754) and Sir John Pringle. Both of these supported his election as a fellow of the Royal Society in 1751. As a foreigner he had only a &#145;bishop's licence&#146; to practise medicine, and in 1765 he was summonsed by the Royal College of Physicians for illegal practice, but in the same year he became a licentiate of the college. He was an enthusiast for inoculation against smallpox (the precursor of Jenner's method of vaccination) and campaigned vigorously against those who opposed it.<br>
<br>Despite his father's excommunication by the Huguenot church, Maty remained in touch with the Huguenot community in England, and chose his wife from among them. She was Elizabeth de Boisragon (<i>d</i>. 1750), the daughter of Louis Chevalleau, seigneur de Boisragon. They were married on 13 December 1743 in Spring Gardens Chapel, one of several small chapels belonging to the Huguenot church of the Savoy. Their first child, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18354/', "Henri Paul (later Paul Henry Maty (1744&#150;1787)")</script>, was born on 18 December 1744, followed by two daughters, Louise (<i>b</i>. September 1746) and Anne Gillette (<i>b</i>. March 1748). Elizabeth died in August 1750, soon after the birth in July of their third daughter, Susanne, who also died in August. On 25 July 1752 Maty married again; his second wife was Mary Dolon de Ners (<i>d</i>. 1802) of Marylebone, also of Huguenot descent, the daughter of Peter Anthony Dolon, seigneur de Ners. In July 1753 a daughter, Jeanne, and in June 1756 a son, James, were born; both probably died young. In March 1758 Maty's last child, Marthe, was born.<br>
<br>As the <span class="italic">Biblioth&egrave;que Britannique</span>, which reviewed British publications for the benefit of readers on the continent, came to an end in 1747, Maty decided to found a successor. This was entitled <span class="italic">Journal Britannique</span>, and the first number appeared in 1750. For the first two years it appeared each month, but from 1752 issues were published every two months. Written in French and published at The Hague, it was successful in publicizing British books and periodicals abroad, and soon gained an authoritative reputation. Many of the contributions were written by Maty himself, but he also enlisted other writers, such as Thomas Birch, John Jortin, Jean Des Champs, and C&eacute;sar de Missy.<br>
<br>An article by Maty in the July&#150;August 1755 issue on Samuel Johnson's <span class="italic">Dictionary</span> was probably the cause of Johnson's dislike of Maty. When it was suggested in 1756 that Maty should assist Johnson with a new review which he planned (but which never appeared), the latter's comment was: &#145;the little black dog! I'd throw him into the Thames&#146;  (Boswell, <span class="italic">Life</span>, 1.284). The review had implied that after dedicating the &#145;plan&#146; (1747) of the <span class="italic">Dictionary</span> to Lord Chesterfield, Johnson had failed to make acknowledgement to Chesterfield when the <span class="italic">Dictionary</span> was published in 1755. This ignored the fact that Johnson had, in a letter dated 7 February 1755, criticized Chesterfield's failure to assist him while the work was in preparation. Maty had been on friendly terms with Chesterfield at least since 1745, when he had dedicated to him (as M.L.C.D.C., that is Monsieur le comte de Chesterfield) his <span class="italic">Ode sur la rebellion de MDCCXLV en &Eacute;cosse</span>, in which Maty expressed his hatred of Catholicism. He and Chesterfield were both friends of the mathematician Abraham de Moivre (1667&#150;1754), whose life Maty wrote in the <span class="italic">Journal Britannique</span> of September&#150;October 1755, and subsequently published separately.<br>
<br>At the end of 1755 Maty gave up the <span class="italic">Journal Britannique</span>, which was rather unsuccessfully continued for two more years by De Mauve, of whom little is known. In 1756 he applied for a post in the British Museum (founded in 1753) to the earl of Hardwicke, who as lord chancellor was one of the three principal trustees responsible for appointments to the new institution. Maty's successful application was supported by Hardwicke's eldest son, Lord Royston, and by John Jortin, later archdeacon of London (whose son in 1776 married Maty's daughter Louise). Jortin said that if Maty were appointed he would be naturalized (apparently he never was), and that he had been elected a foreign member of the Academy of Sciences of Berlin in January 1755. He was elected in 1759 to the Royal Society of Haarlem and in 1765 to the Royal Academy of Sciences of Sweden.<br>
<br>In June 1756 Maty was appointed one of the three original under-librarians (keepers) of the British Museum and put in charge of the department containing Sir Hans Sloane's books and manuscripts. After the gift of the Royal Library by George II in 1757, Maty took charge of its printed books, as well as the Sloane printed books and those of Major Arthur Edwards, while his colleague Charles Morton dealt with the Sloane, Cotton, Harley, and Royal manuscripts. From 1758 these two departments were called the departments of printed books and manuscripts respectively. The third department, named the department of natural and artificial productions, contained Sloane's collections of natural history and antiquities.<br>
<br>Maty drew up a scheme in 1757 for arranging the books of the Royal Library, and in 1759 for improving the (very restricted) way in which the public were admitted to view the museum. Both these proposals were approved by the trustees. In 1759 he also put forward a scheme for cataloguing the printed books, but this work did not reach fruition until the 1780s. In 1765, when James Empson, the first under-librarian of the department of natural and artificial productions, died, Maty took charge of that department, relinquishing the control of the department of printed books to Samuel Harper. Maty was particularly interested in the collections of birds and made considerable additions to them.<br>
<br>In 1760 Maty withdrew his application for the post of secretary of the Society for the Encouragement of Arts, Manufactures, and Commerce because of the disapproval of his patron, Lord Royston, but in 1762 he became assistant secretary for foreign correspondence to the Royal Society. In 1765 he succeeded his friend Thomas Birch (whose executor he became when Birch died in 1766), one of the original trustees of the British Museum, as joint secretary of the Royal Society. In 1750, when visiting the continent, he called on Voltaire, in 1763 he showed Casanova round the British Museum, and in 1766 he met Rousseau. In 1758 he helped Edward Gibbon with his first publication (<span class="italic">Essai sur l'&eacute;tude de la litt&eacute;rature</span>), which appeared in 1761.<br>
<br>Despite his poor health Maty was promoted in July 1772 to succeed Gowin Knight, the first principal librarian (director) of the British Museum. He did not achieve a great deal during his four-year tenure of this post, but he was more energetic than his notoriously idle successor, Charles Morton. Some important acquisitions of books were made during Maty's principal keepership at the sales of the libraries of James West, Anthony Askew, and C&eacute;sar de Missy, and of duplicates from the library at Dresden.<br>
<br>After the death of the earl of Chesterfield in 1773, Maty wrote a biography of him which was published as the preface to Chesterfield's <span class="italic">Miscellaneous Works</span> (1777). This work was seen through the press by John Obadiah Justamond, a surgeon who was the assistant librarian of the department of natural and artificial productions, and who married Maty's daughter Anne Gillette in 1767. In 1774 Maty became physician to the hospital for French protestants.<br>
<br>Maty died at the British Museum on 2 August 1776. In accordance with his instructions a post-mortem examination was carried out by two fellows of the Royal Society, whose report, published in the <span class="italic">Philosophical Transactions</span>, indicates that he died of cancer of the intestine. He was buried on 8 August at St Anne's, Soho, and a sermon in memory of him was preached on 11 August at Oxendon Street Chapel by the minister there, his nephew Charles Peter Layard, later dean of Bristol. In his will Maty instructed his sole executor, his wife, Mary, who died in 1802, to burn all his papers. He left to the British Museum his portrait, painted when he was aged about thirty-six by the Swiss painter Barthel&eacute;my Dupan, and busts of Petrarch, Boccaccio, Machiavelli, and Dante. In 1762 he had presented to the museum seventeen busts which he had bought at Roubiliac's sale after the sculptor's death that year; Maty and Roubiliac had both worshipped at the Huguenot chapel in Spring Gardens. Maty's son Paul Henry Maty, who was on the staff of the British Museum from 1776 until his death in 1787, sold his father's library in 1777.<br>
