<span class="headword">Arnald,  Richard</span>  (1698/1700&#150;1756), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and biblical scholar</span>, was born in 1698  (Venn, <span class="italic">Alum. Cant.</span>) or 1700  (Nichols). He was educated at Bishop Stortford School, whereafter in 1714 he was admitted to Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, and matriculated the next year. Having graduated BA he moved in 1718 to Emmanuel College, of which he was elected fellow on 24 June 1720; he proceeded MA in 1721 and BD in 1728. He was ordained deacon by Thomas Greene, bishop of Ely, on 23 September 1723 and priest on 20 September 1724. While resident at Emmanuel he printed two copies of Sapphics on the death of George I, and a sermon (on <span class="roman">Colossians</span> 2: 8) preached at Bishop Stortford School feast on 3 August 1726.<br>
<br>In 1733 Arnald was presented by his college to the living of Thurcaston, in Leicestershire, and later, in 1754, was made prebendary of Lincoln. In 1737 he published a sermon (on <span class="roman">Deuteronomy</span> 33: 8) that he had preached for the archdeacon's visitation at Leicester, and in 1746 a sermon on <span class="roman">2 Kings</span> 14: 8, <span class="italic">The Parable of the Cedar and the Thistle Exemplified in the Great Victory at Culloden</span>. The work by which he is remembered is his verse-by-verse commentary on the <span class="roman">Apocrypha</span>, which was published as a continuation of the commentaries of Simon Patrick and William Lowth. It embraces commentaries on the <span class="roman">Wisdom of Solomon</span> (1744), <span class="roman">Ecclesiasticus</span> (1748), <span class="roman">Tobit</span>, <span class="roman">Judith</span>, <span class="roman">Baruch</span>, the <span class="roman">History of Susanna</span>, and <span class="roman">Bel and the Dragon</span>, with dissertations on the books of <span class="roman">Maccabees</span> and <span class="roman">Esdras</span> (1752), to which was added a translation of the treatise on the daemon Asmodeus by the Benedictine Augustin Calmet. These volumes were collected together in 1753 and reissued, with a second edition of the commentary on the <span class="roman">Wisdom of Solomon</span>, in 1760. They were widely used in later collections of biblical commentary and printed in a new edition by John Rogers Pitman in 1822. Arnald's treatment of the <span class="roman">Wisdom of Solomon</span>, in which he sought to correct errors in the Authorized Version's translation from the Greek text, was particularly successful. In general, however, his commentary was often dependent on Calmet's work, despite an assertion that Catholic critics had perverted the true meaning of the apocryphal texts. Nevertheless Arnald's work did assist in the gradual rehabilitation of the <span class="roman">Apocrypha</span> among English readers.<br>
<br>Arnald married Catharine, daughter of the Revd John Woods, rector of Wilford, near Nottingham. They had six children, of whom three predeceased their mother. Arnald died at Thurcaston on 4 September 1756 and was buried in the parish church. His widow died, aged sixty-five, on 11 April 1782.<br>
<br>Their sole surviving son, <a name="cosubject_76058"></a><span class="headword">William Arnald</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1802), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, was born at Thurcaston and educated at Manchester grammar school under Charles Lawson. He was admitted a pensioner at St John's College, Cambridge, on 8 March 1762; he was a scholar and a prizeman, and graduated BA in 1766, as senior wrangler. He was elected a fellow of St John's in 1767 and became a tutor in 1768, proceeding MA in 1769 and BD in 1776.<br>
<br>From 1775 Arnald was chaplain to Bishop Richard Hurd, and from 1778 precentor of Lichfield Cathedral. By Hurd's influence he served from 1776 to 1781 as sub-preceptor to the prince of Wales (later George IV) and Prince Frederick, and was made canon of Windsor in 1779. In January 1782 his mind failed; he remained insane and under restraint until his death, at Leicester, on 5 August 1802. He was said to have been deluded by ambition and to have regained his composure when allowed to wear a mitre. He was buried in Thurcaston church. It was indeed an unfortunate family. One of his brothers, according to William Cole, &#145;was drowned, and his sisters ill married or worse&#146;. By the directions in his will a sermon, <span class="italic">The Important Station of an English University</span>, that he had preached before the university at the commencement in 1781 was published in the year after his death.<br>
