<span class="headword">Knowles,  Reginald Lionel</span>  (1879&#150;1950), <span class="occ">book designer and illustrator</span>, was born on 4 March 1879 at 16 Plimsoll Street, Poplar, in east London, the second son of Ebenezer Caleb Knowles, an author and musician who worked as a merchant's clerk, a native of Worcestershire, and his wife, Emma Dece Scutt, who became a teacher at the infant's department of Woolmore Street school, Poplar. He had four siblings: Charles Francis (1876&#150;1936), an artist and writer; Marion Charlotte (1880&#150;1882); Hubert George (1882&#150;1949); and Horace John (1884&#150;1954), an artist and illustrator. There is little published information about the Knowles family, but according to two manuscripts in the central library of Tower Hamlets, one by Horace Knowles and another by a former neighbour in Poplar, the three boys attended the Craft School in Aldgate. When Reginald left school, probably shortly before 1900, he began working as an artist for the publishing house of J. M. Dent. He was responsible for designing the title-page openings, the endpapers, and the hand-drawn lettering for the titles on the spines for <span class="roman">Everyman's Library</span>, the first fifty volumes of which were published in February 1906. The various borders, used for the frontispieces and title-pages of the different subject groups into which <span class="roman">Everyman's Library</span> was divided, featured intertwining leaves and flowers. Although Knowles's designs were clearly derived from the work of William Morris and Laurence Housman, they were distinctive and successful, and were used for thirty years, until 1935. At that time the elaborate art nouveau work was replaced by a series of small abstract designs by Eric Ravilious and the hand-drawn lettering by typeset titling in Eric Gill's Perpetua Roman typeface.<br>
<br>In 1911 the Society of the Divine Compassion and the Whitwell Press, which was owned by the society, began the publication of a high-quality religious journal, <span class="italic">Ecclesia</span>. Knowles was appointed art editor, and was responsible for many decorative borders, head- and tailpieces, and other illustrations, as well as for the overall design of the magazine. An extensive but incomplete file of the journal is held at the British Library: from this it appears that publication ceased in 1915 or soon after, and that Knowles held the post of art editor throughout its brief life. During the First World War, Knowles, with his brother Charles, worked for the Carlton Studios; Reginald was appointed art manager.<br>
<br>Knowles later founded his own studio, and continued to undertake commissioned work for Dent and for other publishers, including George Newnes, Jarrolds, Cassell, and George Allen, for whom he drew lettering for the title-pages and spines and designed bindings, many recognizable by their highly decorated, gold-blocked front boards. At the time of his death, on 26 December 1950, at his home, 80 Pollard's Hill South, Croydon, he was working on a design for a series of books to be published by Frederick Muller. He was survived by his wife, Lena. Better known as a book designer and decorator, he also illustrated several books, some in colour but most in black and white. He collaborated with his brother Horace on at least two early books, both published by Freemantle, H. Lee's <span class="italic">Legends from Fairyland</span> (1907) and G. W. Dasent's translation of <span class="italic">Norse Fairy Tales</span> (1910). Many of his illustrations are rather static, and though some are quite effective, such as those for W. Brown's <span class="italic">My River</span> (1947), they are too derivative to be completely successful.<br>
<br>Reginald's younger brother, <a name="cosubject_69377"></a><span class="headword">Horace John Knowles</span>  (1884&#150;1954), was born on 22 July 1884 at 57 Bow Lane, Poplar. He was educated at George Green's school in Poplar and the Craft School in Aldgate. Although he was initially apprenticed as an engineering draughtsman, his early collaboration with his brother Reginald led to his becoming a full-time freelance artist some time later, first producing illuminated addresses on vellum and illustrating several church magazines before turning to book illustration proper. His best work was done in pen and ink, with which he produced very decorative, delicate drawings in black and white, often of scenes of the countryside. His finest production is perhaps <span class="italic">Countryside Treasures</span> (1946), which he wrote as well as illustrated, the text handwritten and decorated with initial capitals printed in green. The last major task of his career, which he worked on for five years, was to produce some 500 illustrations and maps for a commemorative edition of the <span class="roman">Bible</span> to celebrate the third jubilee of the British and Foreign Bible Society. He died on 21 August 1954 at his home, 82 Bishops Park Road, Croydon, and was survived by his wife, Laura.<br>
