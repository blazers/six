<span class="headword">Petrie,  Irene Eleanora Verita</span>  (1864&#150;1897), <span class="occ">missionary</span>, was born probably in October 1864 at Hanover Lodge, 14 Hanover Terrace, Kensington Park, London, the youngest of three daughters of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22053/', "Colonel Martin Petrie (1823&#150;1892)")</script> and his wife, Eleanora Grant Macdowall (<i>d</i>. 1886), youngest daughter of William Macdowall of Woolmet House, Midlothian. Both parents were of Scottish descent. Having been educated at home, unlike her sister, who had gone away to finishing school, from 1880 to 1882 she attended, at her own request, Notting Hill high school, Norland Square, London, one of the Girls' Public Day School Company schools. In 1884 she passed the Cambridge higher local examination, distinguishing herself especially in history. She painted, played the piano and guitar, and sang. Having been presented at court in March 1885, she enjoyed her coming out parties and balls. After her mother's death in January 1886 she occupied herself with philanthropic and religious work, including Sunday school teaching, through her parish, St Mary Abbots, Kensington, and in various charitable groups, locally and in the East End, including the National Health Society, the Prison Mission, the Scripture Union, and the Factory Helpers' Union. She had taken the pledge in July 1884 and was active in the Church of England Temperance Society and the Band of Hope. She also taught courses in scripture and hygiene in a correspondence school, the &#145;college by post&#146;, operated by her sister Mary (later Mrs Ashley Carus-Wilson).<br>
<br>A member of the St Mary Abbots Missionary Union from the age of fifteen, Irene Petrie became even more interested in foreign missions while pursuing her philanthropic work, lecturing, writing articles for the Ladies' Union of the Church Missionary Society (CMS), and singing in the CMS ladies' choir at Exeter Hall. After receiving a &#145;call&#146; to be a missionary in 1891, she wrote to the CMS requesting appointment. Her father encouraged her choice of philanthropic and religious work over marriage but opposed her becoming a missionary, and she remained at home until after his death in November 1892. After a short period (9&#150;23 October 1893) at the CMS training institute, The Willows (part of the Mildmay Institution), Stoke Newington, London, encouraged by her sister she sailed for India in October 1893.<br>
<br>Irene Petrie began her work in India as an unpaid volunteer at St Hilda's Diocesan Home in Lahore, which provided parochial care to poor European and Eurasian Christians employed by the railway and the post office. In April 1894 she was accepted by the Punjab and Sind corresponding committee of the CMS as an &#145;honorary missionary in local connexion&#146;, and joined the CMS's Kashmir mission in Srinagar for several months' intensive language study. In the severe winter of 1894&#150;5 she lived in Srinagar with the head of the Kashmir women's mission, Miss Charlotte Hull, who remained a frequent companion in work and travel. Following language examinations in the spring of 1895 she returned to England for the summer to find &#145;friends for Kashmir&#146; and to persuade the CMS to enrol her as a missionary in &#145;full connexion&#146;. Having succeeded in these aims she returned to Srinagar in October 1895 to begin teaching <span class="roman">Bible</span> classes at the CMS schools and visiting women in their homes. Her career in Kashmir was cut short, however, during a holiday in Leh in the Ladakh region of the Himalayas, where she died of fever (probably typhoid) on 6 August 1897. She was buried in the Moravian cemetery at Leh. Memorial tablets were placed in St Mary Abbots Church, Kensington, and at St Luke's, Srinagar; the Irene Petrie Memorial Fund was established to support CMS work in Kashmir.<br>
