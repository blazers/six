<span class="headword">L'Estrange, Sir  Hamon</span>  (1583&#150;1654), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was the third but eldest surviving son of Sir Nicholas L'Estrange (<i>d</i>. 1592) and his wife, Mary, daughter of Robert Bell of Beaupr&eacute; Hall, Outwell, Norfolk. Of ancient Norfolk lineage, the L'Estrange family of Hunstanton can be traced back to the eleventh century. The family fortune was made by L'Estrange's great-great-grandfather, Thomas, who was an esquire of the body to Henry VIII and accompanied him to the Field of Cloth of Gold in 1520. L'Estrange inherited Hunstanton as a minor in 1592, and in 1601 was at Queens' College, Cambridge. His guardian, Sir John Peyton, arranged his marriage the next year, on 8 June, to Alice Stubbe (1585&#150;1656) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/68097/', "L'Estrange, Alice")</script>], the daughter of Richard Stubbe (Peyton's lawyer) and his wife, Anne, the widow of L'Estrange's great-uncle, Sir John L'Estrange. Peyton received &pound;1000 from Stubbe for his part in the transaction. L'Estrange was still of nonage so, while he was released from his wardship, it was necessary for his estates to be held in trust&#151;a role undertaken by two leading members of the Norfolk gentry, Sir Henry Hobart and Thomas Oxburgh.<br>
<br>As a senior gentry figure in the county L'Estrange played a prominent role in its affairs throughout his life. He was pricked as sheriff in 1608 and through the patronage of Hobart he was appointed a deputy lieutenant in 1625. He also served twice as knight of the shire for Norfolk (1614 and 1621) and in 1625 he exploited his local prominence to gain a seat at Castle Rising. His role in the 1614 election bears close scrutiny as not only did he ally himself with Sir Henry Bedingfield, a prominent Catholic, but he and Bedingfield in collaboration with his cousin, Sir James Calthorpe, the sheriff, adjourned the election at the last moment from Norwich to Swaffham. This effectively foiled the plans of Sir Henry Rich to gain a seat. Rich waited in Norwich with a group of freeholders and the backing of Thomas, earl of Suffolk, but could not reach Swaffham in time to influence the election.<br>
<br>L'Estrange played little role in the 1614 parliament, waiting until the last day to make his maiden speech in the house when he called for the Commons to vote on whether to send a reply to James's letter dissolving the parliament. He travelled to the 1621 parliament in the company of his wife and they took rooms with a Mr Haywood in Westminster at &pound;1 10<i>s</i>. per week. Through L'Estrange's meticulous accounts it is clear that this was the only time that Alice L'Estrange visited London and while her husband attended the house she bought a variety of goods for the family and Hunstanton Hall. During the parliament L'Estrange called stridently for the punishment of Sir Giles Mompesson, the notorious monopolist: &#145;Mompesson said he was justice <i>par excellentium</i>. I may say <i>per pestilentiam</i>, for he hath plagued the country&#146;  (Notestein, Relf, and Simpson, 2.168) and he later moved that he be expelled from the Commons. He also introduced a bill concerning salt marshes, which, if enacted, would have granted title to landowners to hold and use land down to the low water mark. The bill proceeded no further than the first reading stage, probably because it overturned the well-established common-law maxim that the dividing line between county and admiralty jurisdiction was the edge of the water. In 1625 L'Estrange attended the London sitting of parliament but along with many of his fellow MPs he absented himself from the Oxford sitting.<br>
<br>L'Estrange continued to play a prominent role in Norfolk affairs during the 1630s. A cultured and articulate man, he avidly purchased books to add to his library and maintained an interest in music and hawking. However, the civil war shattered his peaceful existence and along with his sons, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16513/', "Sir Nicholas L'Estrange (bap. 1604, d. 1655)")</script>, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16507/', "Hamon L'Estrange (1605&#150;1660)")</script>, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16514/', "Roger L'Estrange (1616&#150;1704)")</script>, he supported the king. He was disarmed in December 1642 and when King's Lynn declared for Charles I in August 1643 he was named as governor of the town. Besieged by the earl of Manchester, King's Lynn was forced to surrender on 16 September. Despite heavy financial losses L'Estrange managed to escape immediate sequestration of his estates by the terms of surrender, but he could not hide for ever and Hunstanton was eventually sequestered in 1649. Although in his last years he was badly affected by gout, he patronized the foremost English viol composer, John Jenkins, and brought him to reside with the family at Hunstanton Hall. L'Estrange died there on 31 May 1654 and was buried in Hunstanton church where his gravestone reads:<blockquote>
<div>in Heaven at home, o blessed change!<br>
</div>
<div>Who while I was on earth, was Strange!<br>
</div> (Blomefield, 10.326)</blockquote>
