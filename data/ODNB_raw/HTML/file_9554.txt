<span class="headword">Fitzgerald,  Gerald</span>, eighth earl of Kildare  (1456?&#150;1513), <span class="occ">magnate and administrator</span>, was probably born in 1456, the eldest of the four sons and two daughters of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9585/', "Thomas Fitzgerald, seventh earl of Kildare (d. 1478)")</script>, and his wife, Joan, daughter of James Fitzgerald, sixth earl of Desmond (<i>d</i>. 1462/3). Nothing is known of his early life, although Walter Hussey, in the <span class="roman">Book of Howth</span>, recalled in the 1540s that he was &#145;without great knowledge or learning, but rudely brought up according to the usage of his country&#146;. He was, however, &#145;a mightie man of stature, full of honour and courage&#146;, &#145;a warrior incomparable&#146;, &#145;hardlie able to rule himself when he were moved to anger&#146;, but quickly appeased  (Bryan, 10).<h2>
<a name="Earlymilitaryandadministrativeexperience"></a>Early military and administrative experience</h2>By December 1472 Fitzgerald was old enough to be entrusted with the command of twenty-four spearmen for the defence of the English pale; and in March 1478, on the death of his father, then acting as justiciar or temporary governor, he was elected by the Irish council to supply the vacancy. Edward IV's decision, a few months later, to prefer a minor English peer, Henry, Lord Grey of Ruthin, as deputy lieutenant provoked the young earl into a characteristic demonstration of Geraldine power of the sort which punctuated his relationship with successive kings. Kildare's supporters in the administration withheld recognition of the new governor, whose commission was deemed invalid on a technicality. Grey subsequently secured confirmation from the king and parliament in Ireland, which annulled the legislation of a parliament convened by Kildare, but Grey was reluctant to continue without the support of the lordship's leading family and retired to England. Subsequently, Edward summoned the leading lords and officials to court and dictated a settlement which saw Kildare given charge as deputy lieutenant of a more broadly based administration, with detailed instructions for the maintenance of good rule and the king's interests. By and large, the earl's government preserved the spirit, if not the letter, of this settlement until Edward's death.<h2>
<a name="TheKildareascendancy"></a>The Kildare ascendancy</h2>The eighth earl's career epitomized the period in Irish history known as the &#145;Kildare ascendancy&#146; (1470&#150;1534) and marked the height of the family's fortunes. Admired by Free State historians as a champion of home rule and a growing Anglo-Gaelic cultural rapprochement, Kildare was in reality not unlike English marcher lords elsewhere in his relations with successive kings. His principal recommendation to the crown was the location of his estates in the pale marches and the consequent facility with which he could organize the region's defence through the deployment of his <i>manraed</i> (the men he could call on in wartime) and affinity.<br>
<br>From the creation of the earldom in 1316 until the 1450s, the Leinster branch of the Fitzgeralds were of chiefly local importance. Their landed patrimony was modest, valued at about &pound;430 a year <i>c</i>.1330, chiefly from estates in the Kildare marches, with a secondary cluster of lands in Limerick. At his death, however, the eighth earl was easily the richest lord in Ireland, with a landed income of perhaps Ir&pound;1800 (&pound;1200 sterling) a year. About 40 per cent of this still came from estates in Kildare, where Earl Gerald completed a major military reorganization begun by his father, but the earl also built up a large rental in Meath and significant holdings in Carlow and east Ulster.<br>
<br>These estates were accumulated in a variety of ways. Kildare's first wife, Alison (<i>d</i>. 1495), daughter and coheir of another prominent Kildare landowner, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8938/', "Roland FitzEustace (or Eustace), first baron of Portlester")</script>, brought him the reversion of the strategic border manor of Portlester. After her death in 1495, he married in 1496 Henry VII's first cousin, Elizabeth St John, whose dowry included lands in England and Ireland worth Ir&pound;200 a year. A further royal grant followed in 1503 when his son and heir, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9555/', "Lord Gerald Fitzgerald (1487&#150;1534)")</script>, married Henry's kinswoman, Elizabeth Zouche. Altogether the earl and his family received lands worth over Ir&pound;300 a year by direct royal grant, as successive kings deliberately sought to build up the Fitzgeralds as ruling magnates. These grants were financially lucrative, but strategically more important were the extensive marchlands Kildare acquired, particularly in Carlow, Wexford, Westmeath, and south Dublin. Some of these, indeed, were nominally crown lands. In practice, Kildare acquired them as &#145;swordland&#146; by expropriating Gaelic clansmen, although the Gaelic peasants who actually cultivated the land were probably often retained as the earl's tenants and &#145;sworn English&#146; (who had rendered the oath of allegiance as English subjects). The earl regularized his common-law title to them either by acts of parliament or purchase or, after 1496, by virtue of a clause in his commission as deputy making him a grant of any crown lands he could recover from the Irish.<br>
<br>The military muscle behind this English revival lay in the combination of public office and private resources which characterized the earl's long tenure of office. Kildare reorganized the pale's southern defences around his principal castles of Maynooth, Rathangan, Portlester, Lea, Kildare, Athy, Kilkea, Castledermot, Rathvilly, and Powerscourt, most of which were strengthened or rebuilt during this period. As deputy, Kildare gradually built up a standing force of about 300 kerne, galloglass, and horsemen. These troops were regularly quartered on his own tenants in the marches, but it was probably the eighth earl who began to create rent-free holdings for the maintenance of his horsemen and to shift the burden of his kerne and galloglass onto neighbouring Irishmen.<br>
<br>Marriage alliances with prominent English and Gaelic lords also helped to strengthen the earl's affinity and to stabilize the defence of the marches. His sister Eleanor married Conn &Oacute; N&eacute;ill, chief of Tyrone (1483&#150;93). Five of his six daughters from his first marriage were matched with: &Oacute; N&eacute;ill's son Art &Oacute;g &Oacute; N&eacute;ill, who succeeded his father as chief; Mac Carthaigh Riabhach, chief of Carbery; Ulick Finn Burke, lord of Clanrickard; Sir Piers Butler of Polestown, earl of Ormond and earl of Ossory (who married his second daughter Margaret [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/69168/', "Butler, Margaret")</script>]; and Christopher Fleming, thirteenth baron of Slane (<i>d</i>. 1517). Later most of his seven sons with his second wife also made politically important marriages. Concurrently, the earl was exacting tributes or black rents from almost all the Gaelic chiefs whose lands bordered the pale's southern and western marches. From a Gaelic perspective, Kildare's dealings with the weak and divided chieftaincies bordering his lordship differed little from the relations between a Gaelic overlord and his <i>uirr&iacute;ghthe</i>, or vassal-chiefs. Indeed it was in the earl's interests to cultivate that impression since, despite repeated requests by the English of Ireland, in 1474, 1494, and 1506, the king proved unwilling to make available sufficient resources to complete the conquest of Ireland. Accordingly, Kildare spoke and wrote in Gaelic, as occasion demanded, and his court included a Gaelic entourage, with a judge, physician, poets, and other captains, household servants, and receivers.<h2>
<a name="Kildareandthecrown"></a>Kildare and the crown</h2>Yet suggestions that &#145;the Great Earl&#146; was an &#145;Anglo-Irish separatist&#146;, attempting to establish himself as a quasi-high-king, fundamentally misconstrue the nature of his relationship both with the English political community of Ireland and with the English crown. Certainly, the earl exploited the crown's renewed weakness under Richard III: Geraldine influence on the Irish council was strengthened, and Kildare's brother Thomas Fitzgerald (<i>d</i>. 1487) was intruded as chancellor against the king's wishes. But the corollary was the earl's active support for the Yorkist cause in the years that followed. This later clouded his relations with Henry Tudor. It culminated in the 1487 conspiracy, when the earl backed Lambert Simnel, who pretended to be Edward, earl of Warwick, Edward IV's nephew. Simnel was crowned King Edward VI in Christ Church, Dublin. For the invasion of England which followed, Kildare recruited 4000 Gaelic kerne commanded by his brother to reinforce the 2000 German mercenaries supplied by Margaret of Burgundy. The Yorkist army reached Stoke by Newark but was heavily defeated in a three-hour battle in which Thomas Fitzgerald was killed. Kildare held out in Ireland for a few months longer. He was eventually pardoned in 1488 in a settlement negotiated with Sir Richard Edgcumbe, Henry VII's commissioner.<br>
<br>Yet Edgcumbe failed to extract anything more from the deputy and council in return for their pardons than oaths of allegiance: rather than give bonds for their future conduct, they threatened to &#145;become Irish every one of them&#146;  (Bryan, 134). And in 1490 Kildare evaded a summons to court with the excuse that he could not be spared from the defence of the land. Thus when, in 1491&#150;2, he was implicated in the activities of another Yorkist pretender, Perkin Warbeck, who landed at Cork and was supported by Desmond, Kildare's cousin, the king responded more energetically. He first dispatched Sir James Ormond, illegitimate brother of his leading councillor, Thomas Butler, seventh earl of Ormond, with 200 men to hold the Butler territories as a wedge between the two Fitzgerald earls (of Kildare and of Desmond); and then, after Warbeck's departure for France, he dismissed Kildare and his closest supporters from office.<br>
<br>It was four years before the earl regained the deputyship. Meanwhile, Henry's attempt to build up Ormond as a counterweight to Kildare brought about both a revival of the old Butler&#150;Geraldine feud and increased disturbances. Kildare withdrew his co-operation in government and defence. Thus in autumn 1493 leading nobles and officials were bound over for their good conduct, Kildare in 1000 marks, and summoned to court. Eventually, Sir Edward Poynings was appointed deputy, with 653 men to hold Ireland against Warbeck, and a handful of skilled administrators to overhaul the Dublin government. Kildare actively supported Poynings, encouraging Ulster chiefs to submit, but in February 1495, after his secret communications with the chiefs were revealed, he was arrested on charges of plotting against the deputy, attainted by the Irish parliament, and shipped to England. Led by his brother James Fitzgerald, who seized Carlow Castle, Geraldines rose in rebellion, while Desmond rallied support for Warbeck in Munster. The deputy besieged Carlow during the spring and then lifted Warbeck's siege of Waterford. This broke the resistance, Ireland was quiet at last, and Poynings sailed for England.<br>
<br>By 1496, therefore, Henry VII had finally wrested the initiative in Ireland, although this had cost him &pound;23,000 since 1491. The need for a garrison and the prospect of continuing expenses, however, prompted the king to look again at the traditional expedient of government through a local noble. By then the English parliament had reversed Kildare's attainder, he had been permitted to marry the king's cousin, and a formal investigation of his contacts with Ulster chiefs cleared him of treason. Before the English council in August 1496, he swore to uphold Poynings' law, to surrender traitors or rebels to the king upon request, and to forget old quarrels with the Butlers. He was reappointed deputy on exceptionally generous terms, although Henry kept his son and heir at court as a pledge for his conduct.<h2>
<a name="Lateryearsanddeath"></a>Later years and death</h2>Thereafter relations between king and earl remained harmonious. Kildare's later years as deputy witnessed a period of comparative peace, prosperity, and strong government. Warbeck again landed at Cork in 1497, but attracted little support. Kildare spent much of his time on military expeditions far into Gaelic parts and made progresses through outlying shires and cities which seldom saw the king's deputy, visiting Carrickfergus in 1503, Galway in 1504, and Limerick in 1510. The series of expeditions which he now organized against &Oacute; Briain of Thomond reflected the extended horizons of English rule. It precipitated in 1504 the largest engagement of the period, at Knockdoe near Galway, in which the pale levies of English bills and bows with Kildare's Gaelic allies and clients defeated the forces of &Oacute; Briain and Clanricarde in a rare pitched battle. The king rewarded the earl for this victory with election to the Order of the Garter. The previous year Kildare had paid what proved his last visit to court for his son's marriage, after which Lord Gerald was permitted to return with his father and was appointed lord treasurer.<br>
<br>On Henry VII's death in 1509, Kildare was elected justiciar by the council, according to custom. The young Henry VIII summoned him to court, but accepted his excuses and reappointed him as deputy. By then, the earl was in his mid-fifties. He still campaigned vigorously, but not always successfully. In 1510 he led another expedition against &Oacute; Briain and broke down his bridge over the Shannon but also suffered heavy losses. He was wounded the year after while campaigning in the midlands and cancelled a visit to court. In 1512 he captured Belfast and Larne castles and hosted into Connacht. He met his end, appropriately enough, while on campaign in 1513, being shot and wounded while watering his horse near Kilkea by one of the U&iacute; Mhordha of Laois. He retired slowly via Athy to Kildare where, after lingering a few days, he died on 3 September. His body was carried to Dublin and buried in Christ Church in the chapel he had built two years earlier on the north side of the altar. Neither chapel nor tomb survive, but a drawing of his tomb has been published. He was succeeded as earl and governor by his son, Lord Gerald.<h2>
<a name="Reputation"></a>Reputation</h2>From their different perspectives, English and Gaelic writers were fulsome and remarkably consistent in their praise of Kildare's rule and career. The Gaelic annals of Ulster wrote that:<blockquote>in power, fame and estimation, he exceeded all the <i>Gaill</i> [foreigners, English], conquered more territory from the <i>Gaedhil</i>, built more castles for the <i>Gaill</i>, rased more castles of the <i>Gaedhil</i>, kept better justice and law, and gave most of his own substance to the men of Ireland. (<span class="italic">Annals of Ulster</span>, 3.507)</blockquote>His servant, Philip Flattisbury of Johnstown, Kildare, an exchequer clerk who compiled the earl's red book, wrote that as governor he excelled all previous governors in defeating Irish enemies and reducing them to the king's peace, and also:<blockquote>he forcibly constructed and built on the borders of the Irish in different parts many towns which had long since been laid waste by the Irish and needed replenishing with colonists and other buildings, and also diverse castles and bridges and other fortresses to the great profit and defence of the English. (BL, MS 4787, fol. 252<i>v</i>)</blockquote>
