<span class="headword">Pyne,  William Henry</span> <span class="st"> [<em>pseud. </em>Ephraim Hardcastle]</span>  (1770&#150;1843), <span class="occ">artist and writer</span>, was born at 9 Exeter Court, Strand, London, on 21 April 1770, the second son of John Pyne (1727&#150;1794), a leather dresser in Holborn, and Mary Craze (<i>d</i>. 1819). He was baptized on 10 May and lived in London throughout his life. His early interest in drawing induced his father to send him for instruction at the drawing school of Henry Pars. At the age of fourteen he was apprenticed to William Sharp.<br>
<br>Pyne developed quickly a great facility for drawing and at the age of sixteen was inspired by Philippe Jacques de Loutherbourg to introduce into his works realistic groups of figures and animals following some characteristic occupation. Two of his earliest drawings, published as aquatints in 1790, entitled <span class="italic">A Country Theatre</span> and <span class="italic">A Country Church</span>, are similar in style to those of Thomas Rowlandson, while subsequent works were principally landscapes in watercolours in the early tinted style, progressing later to full colour. He was married on 24 July 1792 at St George's Church, Hanover Square, London, to Dorothy Pearse (<i>b</i>. 1770), a spinster of the same parish. One of their sons, George, married Esther, daughter of John Varley, and also practised in watercolours.<br>
<br>Pyne first exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1790, sending three watercolours, <span class="italic">Travelling Comedians</span>, <span class="italic">Bartholomew Fair</span>, and <span class="italic">A Puppet Show</span>. Altogether he exhibited twenty-two works, two of which included animals painted by Robert Hills; his final exhibits in 1811 were portraits. In 1804 he was one of the four artists who originated the idea of founding the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/96320', "Society of Painters in Water Colours")</script>; he contributed twenty-six works to its first exhibition in 1805, followed by a further twenty-eight until 1815, despite having resigned in 1809 in protest at the society's exclusivity.<br>
<br>As a skilful etcher Pyne often made prints of his drawings; he was also among the first artists to draw on stone for lithographic reproduction. He recognized the needs of amateurs to copy and began a long collaboration with Rudolph Ackermann to publish several books for this purpose, the first in 1798 entitled <span class="italic">Book with Groups of Figures by Pyne for Decorating Landscapes</span>. He pursued the objective further with a substantial undertaking entitled <span class="italic">Microcosm</span> that depicts &#145;a Series of above Six Hundred Groups of Small Figures for the Embellishment of Landscape&#146; involving 120 plates, which he drew and etched from 1802 until 1807. These plates were published in parts by W. H. Pyne and John Claude Nattes until 1803, when sixty plates were collected together to form the first edition of the work. The completed project was published in 1808 in two volumes with the addition of text by C. Gray. In 1803 Pyne designed and etched the title-page and rustic vignettes for S&eacute;bastian Le Clerc's <span class="italic">Nattes's Practical Geometry, or, Introduction to Perspective</span>, and in 1805 wrote the text to and designed and etched the plates for <span class="italic">The Costume of Great Britain</span>. He also contributed the text for the first two volumes of Ackermann's <span class="italic">Microcosm of London</span> (from 1808). Thereafter, Pyne's collaboration with Ackermann was considerable, with the publication of <span class="italic">Rudiments of Landscape Drawing in a Series of Easy Examples</span> (1812); <span class="italic">W. H. Pyne on Rustic Figures in Imitation of Chalk</span> (1813); and <span class="italic">Etchings of Rustic Figures for the Embellishment of Landscape by W. H. Pyne</span> (1815), first published in Ackermann's <span class="italic">Repository</span>. He also supplied the figures for some of the plates in Ackermann's <span class="italic">A History of the University of Oxford</span> (1814) and one drawing to <span class="italic">A History of the University of Cambridge</span> (1815).<br>
<br>Pyne's next major project was a sumptuously illustrated work entitled <span class="italic">The History of the Royal Residences</span>, for which he wrote the text and commissioned artists and engravers to provide 100 aquatints. He published the first part in 1816 but was forced to dispose of the work at a loss before its completion although he remained its editor. Writing became his principal means of earning a living. Pyne enjoyed gossip and took advantage of his knowledge of fellow artists and their techniques to become an energetic art critic under the pseudonym Ephraim Hardcastle. He supplied a long and historically valuable series of anecdotes to the <span class="italic">Literary Gazette</span> and in 1823 the collected papers were published in two volumes entitled <span class="italic">Wine and Walnuts</span>. He interrupted his writings in 1822 to provide twelve satirical drawings for <span class="italic">The Social Club</span>, returning to them a year later when he launched a weekly journal (later renamed <span class="italic">Somerset House Gazette</span>), edited under his pseudonym; it was discontinued after just one year. He also contributed many articles to <span class="italic">Arnold's Magazine of the Fine Arts</span>, the <span class="italic">Library of the Fine Arts</span>, and <span class="italic">Fraser's Magazine</span>.<br>
<br>Pyne's last book, <span class="italic">The Twenty-Ninth of May</span>, a novel published in 1825, was not successful. He edited the last four volumes of Ackermann's <span class="italic">The World in Miniature</span>, completed in 1827, before serious financial difficulties caused him to be confined, in 1828, in the king's bench prison for debtors until his friends obtained his release. Afterwards he painted a few watercolours and in 1831 contributed to a work entitled <span class="italic">Lancashire Illustrated</span> before being confined again in the debtors' prison in 1835. Though long popular, Pyne had become an obscure, almost forgotten figure at the time of his death from apoplexy at 2 a.m. on 29 May 1843 at Pickering Place, Paddington, Middlesex, after a long illness. It was the very day he had chosen for the title of his last book. He was survived by his wife. Many of Pyne's watercolours, drawings, and books are held by the British Museum and Victoria and Albert Museum, London.<br>
