<span class="headword">Babington,  Francis</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1569?), <span class="occ">college head</span>, was probably the third son of Humphry Babington of Rothley Temple in Leicestershire. He matriculated as a pensioner at Christ's College, Cambridge, in 1544, and proceeded BA in 1548&#150;9. He became a fellow of St John's College, Cambridge, in 1551, proceeding MA in 1552. There is no evidence of his religious sympathies during the reign of Edward VI. However, he subscribed to the Roman Catholic articles of faith in 1555 prior to taking permanent leave of Cambridge for Oxford. He remained at Oxford for the rest of his academic career, taking in succession the degrees of MA (1554), BTh (1558), and DTh (1560). He was elected a proctor of the university on 18 April 1557, being already a fellow of All Souls.<br>
<br>Babington was ordained priest in London on 5 March 1557. He then began to accumulate church livings, being admitted first to the vicarage of Aldworth, Berkshire, on 6 November 1557, upon presentation by St John's College, Cambridge. On 27 November he received the rectory of Adstock, Buckinghamshire, then the rectory of Sherrington, Buckinghamshire. He subsequently resigned Adstock, and took in its stead that of Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire. Upon the accession of Elizabeth I Babington professed himself to be a protestant, despite his prominence in enforcing Catholic orthodoxy at Oxford during the reign of Mary I. He also became chaplain to Lord Robert Dudley, then Elizabeth's master of horse. He preached the funeral sermon for Dudley's first wife, Amy Robsart (who was buried in St Mary's, Oxford, on 22 September 1560), an indication of the favour in which he was held. His conduct of the funeral, however, was marred by his repeated reference in the sermon to the &#145;lady so pitifully murdered&#146;  (Cooper, <span class="italic">Ath. Cantab.</span>, 1.557). Babington became master of Balliol College on 5 September 1559, and on 21 May 1560 was appointed vice-chancellor of the university, a post he held until 1562. With Dudley's support he was then appointed rector of Lincoln College in August 1560 (an appointment which lasted until 1563). He also held the benefice of Twyford, Buckinghamshire, in conjunction with the headship of Lincoln. He later came into possession of the rectories of Caythorpe, Lincolnshire (1560), and Holsworthy, Devon (1562).<br>
<br>Babington's career at Oxford reached its apogee with his appointments both to Lincoln College and to the post of Lady Margaret professor of divinity (made effective towards the end of 1560, and held until 1563). Though university statutes did not permit, he remained vice-chancellor while holding the professorship. In 1562 Babington was involved in forcing a protestant warden, John Man, upon Merton College, whose fellows were Roman Catholic in their sympathies. Nevertheless, it was suspicion of the sincerity of his adherence to protestantism that blocked his succession in early 1561 to the deanery of Christ Church, Oxford (the post went instead to Thomas Sampson), and which ultimately led to his downfall. Babington resigned the vice-chancellorship in Michaelmas term 1562. In 1563 he resigned as rector of Lincoln and then as Lady Margaret professor, and he was subsequently deprived of his church livings in 1564. He remained in Oxford for a year after his resignations, and then fled to continental Europe in 1565, where he apparently died in exile in December 1569.<br>
<br>Babington had a reputation for scholarship, and was known for his skill in philosophical and logical disputations. The contents of his personal library indicate a wide range of scholarly interest. He owned works of the church fathers (Origen, Clement of Alexandria, John Chrysostom, Augustine, and Gregory the Great) and of medieval theologians (Bede, Anselm, Bonaventura, Duns Scotus, and Hugo of St Cher), as well as works of his contemporaries, including Erasmus, and some mathematical works. He also collected manuscripts. Subsequent to his death, some of his books stayed at Lincoln. Others found their way to the library of the Jesuit College of the Immaculate Conception (in fact a nominal college, of no fixed location but embracing the counties of Derbyshire, Leicestershire, Nottinghamshire, and Rutland), where they remained during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Most of these books are now at Stonyhurst College, Lancashire.<br>
<br>Babington's career reflects the difficulties faced by many English academics in the turbulent years of the mid-sixteenth century. Like a number (but by no means all) of his fellows, he sought to comply with the religious requirements of the successive regimes of Edward VI, Mary I, and Elizabeth I. Although a Roman Catholic, he was able for a time to dissemble his true confessional commitments after the accession of Elizabeth, and even joined in the persecution of Catholics resistant to changes at Oxford in the early 1560s. In the end Babington failed in this endeavour, and having lost the patronage of Dudley, he chose the path of exile taken by so many of his co-religionists.<br>
