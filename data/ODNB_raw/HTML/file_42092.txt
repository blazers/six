<span class="headword">Booth,  Charles</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1535), <span class="occ">bishop of Hereford</span>, is of uncertain parentage, but was undoubtedly a member of the noted Booth family of Barton, Lancashire. It has been thought that he was the son of Sir Robert Booth and therefore of a junior branch of the family. It is certainly true that he was closely related to Lawrence Booth and William Booth, archbishops of York in the second half of the fifteenth century, and to John Booth, bishop of Exeter between 1465 and 1478.<br>
<br>Charles Booth seems to have been educated at Cambridge, studying civil law at Pembroke College, and received the degree of BCL in 1485, but the grace book references are not conclusive. His likely uncles, William and Lawrence, had been members of Pembroke, so it is hardly surprising to find Charles Booth also associated with that college, of which he was later a benefactor. After Cambridge it is certain that he studied at Bologna, where he received the degree of DCL in 1493. In 1505&#150;6 he was granted a grace of incorporation at Cambridge.<br>
<br>Leaving Bologna in 1493 Booth was an advocate at the court of Canterbury for two years, leaving in 1495 to become treasurer of the diocese of Lichfield under Bishop William Smith, a position he held until 1516. Although he had been rector of Normanton-on-Soar, Nottinghamshire, from 1493 (vacated in 1499), his career flowered after his association with Smith. In addition to the treasurership of Lichfield he was named canon of Auckland, co. Durham, and prebendary of St Helens. In 1499 he became rector of St James Garlickhythe, London. In 1501 he followed Smith to Lincoln, where he served as chancellor and commissary-general until 1506. In the same year he was collated canon of Lincoln and prebendary of Clifton (later exchanged for the prebend of Farendon). From 1505 until 1516 he was archdeacon of Buckingham and held various other positions including canon of St Paul's and prebendary of Reculverland (1516), until he became bishop of Hereford in 1516.<br>
<br>Booth's friendship with Smith in 1501 led him into the circle of advisers to Prince Arthur. Most sources claim that he served as chaplain and chancellor of the council in the marches of Wales in 1502 but it seems that that council did not have a position as chancellor, an error that seems to have originated in Francis Godwin's <span class="italic">Catalogue of the Bishops of England</span>. Booth appears to have been an active member of this council, working alongside Smith, whom he also supported in his efforts to defend the knights of St John. He continued his work after the death of the prince in 1502, being named as one of the &#145;lordys marchers in Wales&#146;, as late as 1531  (<span class="italic">LP Henry VIII</span>, 5, no. 390).<br>
<br>On 22 April 1516 Booth was nominated to the see of Hereford. Custody of the temporalities was granted on 17 May. Papal provision followed on 21 July, and he was consecrated on 30 November. In 1518 he was summoned by Wolsey to attend the council for the reformation of the clergy and subsequently organized a synod within his diocese to discuss the results of that council. It was undoubtedly while he was serving on the council in the marches of Wales that he made the acquaintance of Prince Arthur's wife, Katherine of Aragon. This relationship continued after the death of Arthur and her subsequent marriage to Henry VIII. He was one of the bishops invited to be present when the future Charles V visited England on his way to be crowned emperor at Aachen in 1520. He was also one of three bishops who attended the queen at the Field of Cloth of Gold, the others being Fisher of Rochester and Athequa of Llandaff (formerly her confessor). Although there is little firsthand evidence of Booth's position on the annulment he is thought to have been a strong supporter of the queen. His attitude at the convocation of 1529 certainly appears to have irritated the king, who instructed Cromwell in 1531 &#145;to make processe and to prosecute against Charles, busshop of Hereford, according to the lawes, with all spede, if he do not agree&#146;  (<span class="italic">LP Henry VIII</span>, no. 394). Booth's advocacy of the queen stopped well short of the lengths to which others were prepared to go, and the king's warning seems to have had an effect. However strongly he may have felt about the issue he appears to have responded to the king's shot across his bows, for no further action was taken against him.<br>
<br>Once the proceedings for the annulment had been completed and the king remarried, Booth concentrated on his diocese. He was unreceptive to reforming ideas, and his register testifies to his conservative turn of mind. Archbishop Warham's instructions to his bishops of 1526 to collect and burn all translations of the <span class="roman">New Testament</span> are reproduced in their entirety in Booth's register, as is his letter in response claiming, with some pride, that there were no copies surrendered to him in Hereford. He appears to have conducted the business of the diocese with some care. There were, however, internal diocesan problems that seem to have been beyond his capabilities, for Cranmer wrote to him at one point hoping that he would not have to intervene in a dispute. Booth was also criticized for incurring too great a cost for his diocese in the repair of his house in London. During his episcopate the north porch of Hereford Cathedral was built.<br>
<br>Booth died on 5 May 1535, leaving all his books not already bequeathed elsewhere to the library at Hereford. He was buried in Hereford Cathedral, in the north aisle of the nave.<br>
