<span class="headword">Goodricke, Sir  John</span>, fifth baronet  (1708&#150;1789), <span class="occ">diplomatist</span>, was born at Ribston, near Knaresborough, on 20 May 1708, the eldest of three sons (there were no daughters) of Sir Henry Goodricke, fourth baronet (1677&#150;1738), and his wife, Mary, daughter of Tobias Jenkins of Grimston, Yorkshire. His childhood years were spent on the family estate, in country pursuits, and within an atmosphere of physical and spiritual well-being where books and polite conversation abounded. After receiving his early education from a tutor he entered Trinity College, Cambridge, as a fellow-commoner in 1725; he took his BA in 1728 and his MA in 1734. It was at Cambridge that he refined the traits most commonly associated with him in later years: self-discipline, perseverance, and a sound if not creative intellect.<br>
<br>On 28 September 1731 Goodricke married his second cousin Mary, illegitimate daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2144/', "Robert Benson, Baron Bingley (bap. 1676, d. 1731)")</script>, politician; her mother was the daughter of James Sill, a mercer from Wakefield. They had two sons and one daughter. Goodricke succeeded as fifth baronet on 21 July 1738; left with an encumbered estate he spent some difficult years in attempting to restore the family fortune. These attempts, none too successful, ranged from various business ventures to a stint in the Netherlands from 1745 to 1747 as observer for the British government, gathering intelligence on the French army, navy, and court. In 1750, thanks to his Yorkshire connections, he was appointed as British resident in Brussels, an appointment suddenly revoked for reasons unknown. He remained in The Hague from 1751 to 1757, conducting informal discussions with the Dutch about the barrier treaty and gaining valuable diplomatic experience. He also established friendships with the British minister Joseph Yorke (later Baron Dover) and his brother Philip (Viscount Royston and later second earl of Hardwicke), both sons of Philip Yorke, first earl of Hardwicke, lord chancellor.<br>
<br>It was through their influence that Goodricke was appointed as minister-resident to Sweden in 1758; he had to wait in Copenhagen until 1764 before the Swedish government resumed diplomatic relations with Britain that had been severed at the outset of the Seven Years' War. During his enforced stay in Copenhagen, Goodricke, whose wife had remained in England, had a very public affair with St&ouml;ulet Katrine (Jackboot Kate), a ballet dancer, and also mastered the Swedish language. He was finally received officially in Stockholm on 25 April 1764 and remained there until 1773. He collaborated closely with the Russian ambassador, Count Ostermann, and worked to secure a defensive alliance with Sweden (1766), to safeguard British trade, and to prevent France's resurgence in the Baltic by supporting the pro-Russian party of the Caps in their resistance to the pro-France Hats. The principal triumph of his mission to Stockholm was the emphatic victory won by the Caps at the election in 1765, which ousted the Hats from government posts. However, hopes that the Anglo&#150;Swedish connection would lead to a Russian alliance did not materialize, as successive British administrations proved unwilling to provide the peacetime subsidies and co-operation in Poland that the Russians demanded. French influence revived after the <i>coup d'&eacute;tat</i> of 19 August 1772, by which Gustavus III, a prot&eacute;g&eacute; of France, restored royal absolutism.<br>
<br>Goodricke relinquished his Stockholm appointment in 1773, following his wife's succession to the Yorkshire seat of Bramham Park, which brought sudden wealth; he was then free to take his ease as a country gentleman, and devote himself to estate and agricultural improvement. He was elected to parliament for Pontefract in 1774; he supported Lord North's government on the American War of Independence and was in favour of granting further relief to protestant dissenters. He did not stand for re-election to the parliament of 1780 but he was elected for Ripon in 1787 and was appointed a commissioner of the Board of Trade in 1788. He died in New York on 6 August 1789 and was buried in Hunsingore, Yorkshire.<br>
