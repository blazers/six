</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Roth, Sir  Martin</span>  (1917&#150;2006), <span class="occ">psychiatrist</span>, was born on 6 November 1917 in Budapest, in the dying days of the Austro-Hungarian empire, the second of the three children of Samuel Simon Roth, cantor in a synagogue, and his wife, Regina. In 1925 the family moved to England, before settling in the East End of London. There Roth attended the Davenant Foundation School, where he excelled both academically and as a pianist. For a time he considered a career as a musician but decided instead on medicine. He obtained a place at St Mary's Hospital, London, but had to delay his studies because of illness. At St Mary's he worked hard, rowed for the hospital, and qualified in 1942. After a further period of ill health, he began work as a doctor at Park Prewett Hospital, then a military hospital. In 1943 he moved to Maida Vale Hospital to train in neurology under Russell Brain. In the following year he passed the examination for membership of the Royal College of Physicians of London, and in 1945 was awarded the London MD. On 18 August the same year, at Hampstead register office, he married Constance Heller, a 26-year-old civil servant, and daughter of Samuel Heller, businessman. They had three daughters.<br>
<br>At Maida Vale Roth gained experience in clinical neurology and also learnt the basics of neuropathology&#151;knowledge that was to inform his later research. He enjoyed neurology and spent nearly three years at Maida Vale but found that he was increasingly interested in the psychological problems of his patients. Encouraged by Brain, he decided to specialize in psychiatry at the Maudsley Hospital. There he worked with Aubrey Lewis, Eliot Slater, and other leading psychiatrists of the day and was introduced to the renowned refugee German psychiatrist Willie Mayer-Gross. Mayer-Gross was impressed by Roth and offered him a post at the well-known Crichton Royal Hospital in Dumfries. Roth, who was not entirely happy at the Maudsley, accepted.<br>
<br>Roth moved to Dumfries in 1948 and soon set up a new laboratory where he began research into the changes in electroencephalography associated with electroconvulsive therapy. The research went well and Roth was awarded a prize by the Royal Medico-Psychiatric Association, at that time the professional organization for psychiatrists. In Dumfries he also became interested in the psychiatric disorders occurring in elderly people, which at that time were thought to be varied manifestations of a single ill-defined and untreatable condition known as senile psychosis. At the same time he accepted an invitation from Mayer-Gross to collaborate on a new textbook that he was writing with Eliot Slater. However, neither the research nor the book was completed in Dumfries because in 1950 Roth was appointed director of research at Graylingwell Hospital, near Chichester, Sussex.<br>
<br>At Graylingwell Roth continued to investigate the psychiatric disorders of old age and, in a landmark follow-up study, produced evidence that they were not all of one kind, as had previously been supposed, and did not all have the same outcome. This work was the first of a long series of groundbreaking studies of the psychiatric disorders of late life which continued well into Roth's retirement years. The research laid the scientific foundation for the specialty of old age psychiatry and thereby to much-needed improvements in the care of elderly psychiatric patients. At the same time Roth continued work on the textbook with Mayer-Gross and Slater, which was eventually published in 1954. The book, <span class="italic">Clinical Psychiatry</span>, combined the scientific basis of psychiatry with vivid clinical descriptions and authoritative advice about treatment. It was immediately recognized as a major work of scholarship and a significant advance on other textbooks of the time and it soon became the standard British post-graduate textbook. It passed through three editions and was translated into Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, and Chinese. It was a turning-point in the teaching of psychiatry and its approach was the forerunner of what was to be known, much later, as evidence-based psychiatry. Following these successes Roth was the natural choice as director when, in 1956, the Medical Research Council established a clinical research unit at Graylingwell Hospital. However he did not take up the post because in the same year he was elected to the chair of psychiatry at King's College, Newcastle (then part of the University of Durham). He remained there after King's College became the independent University of Newcastle upon Tyne in 1963.<br>
<br>In Newcastle between 1956 and 1977 Roth built a world-class academic department with a wide-ranging research programme which included studies of the psychiatric disorders of old age, mood disorders, and child psychiatry. Among the important findings from Roth's own research were those showing the neuropathology of the psychiatric disorders of old age, carried out with Bernard Tomlinson, work which confirmed Roth's original classification based on clinical features and outcome. Other important studies used epidemiological and statistical methods to study paranoid disorders occurring in elderly people, and to investigate whether depressive disorders with different clinical features were distinct conditions or manifestations of a single basic disorder.<br>
<br>Roth's achievements in Newcastle went far beyond research. He was a skilful and caring clinician, and an inspiring teacher who drew to his department many talented young psychiatrists who went on to successful academic careers in Britain and elsewhere. Before long his growing reputation led to appointment to the committees of national and international organizations. In 1958 he joined the World Health Organization's expert committee on mental health problems of the aged. From 1964 to 1968 he served on the Medical Research Council, from 1968 to 1971 on the council of the Royal College of Physicians, and from 1968 to 1975 on the government's standing mental health advisory committee. In 1968 he was elected president of the section of psychiatry of the Royal Society of Medicine.<br>
<br>In 1971 Roth was elected as the first president of the newly established Royal College of Psychiatrists. Until this date the professional organization of psychiatrists had been the Royal Medico-Psychological Association. This organization, founded in the nineteenth century, and granted a royal charter in 1926, already carried out many of the functions of a medical royal college and many senior members of the profession of psychiatry saw no reason to abandon it, while many junior members feared that the entrance requirements for membership of a royal college would add yet one more obstacle to their already difficult career path. Thus the task of the first president was not easy: the college started life amid controversy and there were many doubters to convince. Roth dealt with these problems with great skill and outstanding success. He brought wisdom, dignity, diplomacy, and authority to the office of president, and worked tirelessly and with great determination. At the first full meeting of the college, he won over the doubters with a memorable address that combined a clear vision of the future, compassion for the problems of the younger members, and disarming wit. Another problem was that the new college had no permanent home. Roth set about raising the substantial funds needed to acquire suitable premises in central London and succeeded in a remarkably short time, impressing major donors with his clear plans and his ability to carry them through. During his presidency the college flourished: a rigorous system of training was established, a fair system of examination was implemented, and trainees were given a voice in the college's debates. Before long the views of the new college were being sought regularly by government. In 1972 Roth's outstanding achievements were recognized by the award of a knighthood.<br>
<br>In 1977 Roth was elected to the newly established chair of psychiatry at the University of Cambridge, and to a fellowship of Trinity College. Starting from very little, he soon established academic psychiatry as a major discipline within the university. His impressive scholarship and wide cultural interests quickly made him a respected figure in the wider academic community which he served in many ways, notably as a syndic of Cambridge University Press from 1980 to 1987. In Cambridge he soon established a new programme of research into the psychiatric disorders of old age. An important early product was the Cambridge mental disorders of the elderly examination (CAMDEX), a research tool that was quickly adopted by research groups worldwide. Roth's research so impressed the Nobel prizewinner Sir Aaron Klug that he embarked on a programme of collaborative research into the molecular pathology of Alzheimer's disease. This research was important not only for its immediate findings but also as a stimulus for studies by other scientists into the molecular basis of Alzheimer's disease, which led to a better understanding of the causes of disorder and pointed the way to possible treatments.<br>
<br>Roth cared deeply about the suffering of mentally ill people and was sympathetic to the problems of the most disadvantaged among them. He believed passionately that careful diagnosis of their conditions and scientific study of the causes could alleviate suffering. He grew increasingly concerned, therefore, about the status being given, in the 1970s and beyond, to the ideas of the anti-psychiatry movement based on the writings of R. D. Laing and Thomas Szasz. These authors argued that mental illnesses did not exist and that their clinical manifestations were the responses of healthy minds to unfavourable circumstances of life. For Szasz, a psychiatric diagnosis was a meaningless label that stigmatized but did not help, and often harmed, the person labelled. When Roth saw how much credence these ideas were gaining among the public, he determined to counter them through writing and public debate. He argued that they were founded on an incomplete understanding both of the experiences of people suffering from serious mental disorders, and of the scientific evidence about the nature and causes of these conditions. In 1986 he published, with Jerome Kroll, <span class="italic">The Reality of Mental Illness</span>, a sharply argued rebuttal of the ideas of the anti-psychiatry movement and a clear account for the general reader of the humanitarian and scientific foundations of modern psychiatry. The book was an important contribution to the public understanding of psychiatry.<br>
<br>Roth retired from his university post in 1985 but remained a fellow of Trinity College. As the years went by he lost none of his vigour, intellectual curiosity, and originality of mind, and he continued with a busy schedule of research and writing. By now he was recognized internationally as the founder of the academic discipline of old age psychiatry and in 1996 he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society. He received many other honours and prizes, among them fellowship of the Academy of Medical Sciences, and distinguished or honorary fellowship of the American, Canadian, Australian, and New Zealand psychiatric associations; the Anna Monika prize (1977); the Sandoz prize of the International Association of Gerontology (1985); the gold medal of the Max Planck Institute (1986); and the lifetime achievement award of the Society of Biological Psychiatry (1996).<br>
<br>Roth was devoted to his children and to his wife, who supported him throughout his career. He had an extensive knowledge of European and classical literature, the result of wide reading and a retentive memory. He enjoyed music and was an accomplished pianist, and had a well-informed appreciation of the visual arts. He enjoyed good company and lively conversation and was interested in new ideas and in other people. He possessed a seemingly boundless store of entertaining stories and wise sayings and was an accomplished public speaker. His health was in decline in his later years, and in August 2003 he was critically ill and spent three months in hospital, following which he never regained mobility. His wife, Constance, then cared for him until his death at his home in Hills Road, Cambridge, on 26 September 2006. He was also survived by their three daughters.<br>
