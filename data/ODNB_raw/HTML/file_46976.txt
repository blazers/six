<span class="headword">Paton,  Alan Stewart</span>  (1903&#150;1988), <span class="occ">writer, educationist, and politician</span>, was born on 11 January 1903 at 9 Greyling Street, Pietermaritzburg, Natal, the oldest of the four children, two boys and two girls, of James Paton (1872&#150;1930), a Scottish shorthand writer who had emigrated to South Africa in 1895, and his wife, Eunice Warder James (1878?&#150;1965), the daughter of a Bristol clerk and his South African-born wife, Edith. James Paton was a puritanical tyrant, from whom his oldest son learned an abiding hatred of violence and authoritarianism.<br>
<br>Alan Paton had a distinguished academic career at Maritzburg College (1914&#150;18) and Natal University College (1919&#150;24) before beginning work as a teacher at Ixopo, where he met his first wife, Doris (Dorrie) Lusted (1897&#150;1967), daughter of a local solicitor, George Francis, and recently widowed. They married on 2 July 1928, and although the marriage was difficult from the start, it endured. Alan Paton in maturity was less than 5 feet 7 inches in height, very fair of complexion, and with piercing pale blue eyes.<br>
<br>Paton, who had not been happy as a teacher, made a momentous career change in 1935, taking on the post of director of a turbulent borstal for black youths, Diepkloof, near Johannesburg. It was at Diepkloof that he formed most of the important political ideas which were to shape his writing and his life. On his arrival he found that Diepkloof was run on prison camp lines, with armed guards, two high fences topped with barbed wire, a massive front gate and severe military discipline. In spite of these measures, or because of them, there were constant escapes. Paton saw that the gate, the guards, and the repressive discipline were part of the problem, and courageously decided to begin breaking them down. The youths would be controlled, not with counter-violence but with love and self-discipline. They were encouraged to spend their days in useful work, gardening, and education; the discipline was gradually made less severe; and after some months first the outer fence, then the huge gate, then the inner fence were removed. Critics such as H. F. Verwoerd, the architect of apartheid, predicted break-outs on a massive scale; in fact the number of escapees dropped sharply and remained low.<br>
<br>It was while he was principal of Diepkloof that Paton, in 1946&#150;7, was sent on a government-sponsored tour of similar borstals in Scandinavia, Britain, and North America. While on this tour, beginning in Norway, he wrote <span class="italic">Cry, the Beloved Country: a Story of Comfort in Desolation</span>. He finished it in the United States, and it was immediately accepted by Scribners and published in 1948. Its success, both critical and popular, was great and lasting; it is widely recognized as one of the outstanding novels of the twentieth century.<br>
<br>Financial security and fame changed Alan Paton's life, as the experience at Diepkloof had done. Shortly before the Nationalist government came to power in the year of <span class="italic">Cry, the Beloved Country</span>'s publication, Paton resigned from Diepkloof and became a full-time writer, turning out a stream of poems and a succession of biographies and novels, including the haunting <span class="italic">Too Late the Phalarope</span> (1953), which focused attention on the tragedy of the Afrikaner, imprisoned and consumed by the apartheid he had created.<br>
<br>In pursuit of his non-racial ideals, Paton helped to found the South African Liberal Party in 1953, becoming its national chairman in 1956 and its president in 1958. From then on his career became increasingly political and dedicated to helping all racial groups in South Africa. Accordingly he was harassed by the Nationalist government, and only his international eminence saved him from imprisonment. He refused to be cowed or silenced, producing a steady stream of polemical articles which kept him in the public eye, and a constant flow of fine poems, many of them unpublished in his own lifetime, most of them having a political message and a satirical edge.<br>
<br>Paton also produced two important political biographies, of his political mentor J. H. Hofmeyr (<span class="italic">Hofmeyr</span>, 1965), and of the Anglican bishop Geoffrey Clayton (<span class="italic">Apartheid and the Archbishop</span>, 1974). He saw these two very different men as representative of the roots of South African liberalism, and his biographies, like his novels, poems, and other writings, are part of a consistent moral and political concern that actuated him all his life.<br>
<br>The same is true of his two volumes of autobiography, <span class="italic">Toward the Mountain</span> (1980) and <span class="italic">Journey Continued</span> (1988), in which there emerges clearly his view of human life as a moral and spiritual pilgrimage, in which our aim should be to live, not for ourselves, but for others. This aim he pursued all his life, though he felt it was an ideal of which he had often fallen short.<br>
<br>After the death of his wife, Dorrie, on 23 October 1967 Paton was sustained by the joy of a successful second marriage, on 30 January 1969, to his secretary, Anne Hopkins (<i>b</i>. 1927), an English-born divorcee. In his later years he found himself criticized both from the left and from the right, as political polarization produced greater extremism, but he stubbornly stood his ground, arguing that violence and repression were wrong no matter who was practising them. He died of cancer of the oesophagus on 12 April 1988 at his home near Durban, Lintrose, Botha's Hill. His ashes were scattered in the garden there in October of that year.<br>
