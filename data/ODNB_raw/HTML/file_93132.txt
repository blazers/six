<span class="headword">Hubbard,  Kenneth Gilbert</span>  (1920&#150;2004), <span class="occ">air force officer</span>, was born on 26 February 1920 at 22 Ethel Road, Norwich, the son of Gilbert Claud Hubbard, mechanical engineer and footballer (he played for Norwich City), and his wife, Florence, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Dack. He was educated at Norwich Junior Technical School (1932&#150;5), then became an engineering draughtsman at Messrs Robert Stevenson of Norwich (1936&#150;40).<br>
<br>Like hundreds of other young men Hubbard volunteered for aircrew duties after the outbreak of the Second World War and he joined the RAF on 21 June 1940, proceeding through the lowest ranks during flying training until May 1941, when he gained his wings at 2 flying training school, Brize Norton, and was commissioned. After a short spell at 2 Central Flying School, Cranwell, in June 1941 he was posted to 12 service flying training school, Grantham, which operated Ansons and Oxfords, and where from July 1942 he served as an instructor. In December that year he was posted to 311 ferry training unit, Moreton in Marsh, and did a conversion course on Wellingtons, then ferried one out to the Mediterranean theatre via Portreath, Rabat Sale, and al-Aouina (Tunis), eventually reaching Foggia, Italy, in January 1944. There he reported to 205 group (responsible for Wellington operations over Italy and the Balkans) and was posted to 70 squadron, operating Wellington Xs, doing a tour of operations throughout 1944. From January 1945 (by now a squadron leader) he was based at Qastina, Palestine, as a pilot instructor, and in April was awarded the DFC, the citation saying that he had<blockquote>taken part in many attacks in close support of the Fifth and Eighth armies and against marshalling yards in the Po valley. One night in May 1944 he participated in a special low-level attack on an important railway bridge in north Italy. At all times, Squadron Leader Hubbard has displayed great courage, determination and devotion to duty.</blockquote>In May 1945 he was posted to 22 personnel transit camp at Almaza, Cairo, and from there back to 70 squadron, now operating Liberator VIs from Tortorella, Italy.<br>
<br>On 19 January 1946, while on leave in the UK, Hubbard married Beatrice Daphne Taylor, the 23-year-old daughter of Richard Taylor, civil engineer, of Tideswell, Derbyshire. He then returned to the Middle East, serving from May to October with 104 squadron, which had Lancaster BVIIs at Abu Sueir and (from July) at Shallufa. He was then at 21 personnel transit camp at Kasfareet until the end of May, when he was repatriated. After disembarkation leave he was posted to the Empire Armament School, Manby, as a qualified flying instructor; then from July 1949 he was at the RAF Flying College (also at Manby) as flight commander, 1 squadron. In April 1951 he was posted overseas again&#151;to command RAF Shaybah during a tense period of Anglo-Iraqi relations, involving the evacuation of British personnel from Abadan. In the 1953 new year honours he was made an OBE&#151;an auspicious beginning to a year that later brought divorce; for on 28 July his wife of seven and a half years was granted a decree absolute. From September he attended a refresher flying course at 201 advanced flying school, Swinderby (Wellingtons and Varsities), then a similar one at 242 Operational Conversion Unit, Dishforth (Valettas and Hastings). A series of courses followed&#151;at the Staff College, Bracknell, at 3 all-weather jet squadron, Manby (1956), at 321 operational conversion unit, Bassingbourn (Canberras), and in June 1956 at 232 operational conversion unit (Valiants).<br>
<br>This intensive training led to Hubbard's posting to Wittering in September 1956 to command 49 squadron, which had been re-formed with Valiants as part of the V-bomber force. This was the apogee of Hubbard's career, for his squadron was entrusted with the live drop of Britain's first megaton bomb&#151;accomplished on 15 May 1957 when he captained Valiant XD818 in operation Grapple, involving extremely accurate flying, at 45,000 feet and a speed of Mach 0.76. Although the yield of the bomb was not as great as its designers had hoped, the flying and airmanship were impeccable, and all five crew members were awarded the Air Force Cross. Subsequently Hubbard wrote a detailed account, in collaboration with Michael Simmons, published as <span class="italic">Operation &#145;Grapple&#146;: Testing Britain's First H-Bomb</span> (1985).<br>
<br>After he relinquished command of 49 squadron Hubbard served at Bomber Command headquarters (plans and policy) from early 1959; then in July 1961, by now a group captain, he was posted overseas again, to command RAF al-Adem in Libya, until January 1963. His last Bomber Command appointment was as officer commanding RAF Scampton, which had three Vulcan squadrons with Blue Steel stand-off bombs. In June 1964 he moved to Transport Command (whose commanding officer was Air Chief Marshal Sir Kenneth Cross, under whom he had served at Bomber Command) as officer in charge of training, holding this post until January 1966, when he was placed on the retired list at his own request&#151;disappointed at not having achieved air rank.<br>
<br>Following his retirement from the RAF Hubbard found new roles. Although a venture into farming in the west country was not successful, he there met Margaret Julia Marie Grubbe (<i>b</i>. 1910/11), the daughter of Lawrence Carrington Grubbe, artist. They were married on 14 March 1975 at the register office, Blyth, Suffolk, and Hubbard moved to The Priory, Church Lane, Blythburgh, where he involved himself keenly in local affairs. He had joined the board of the refrigeration company the Hubbard&#150;Reader Group, doing some charter flying and being responsible for sales and marketing, until 1982. Then in an active retirement (clouded by the death of his wife in 1997), he was on the Blundeston prison parole board, was involved in the Air Training Corps in Suffolk, assessed applications for RAF Benevolent Fund assistance, and&#151;among other local activities&#151;as a great animal lover inaugurated an annual service for animals at Blythburgh church. He died at his home in Blythburgh on 22 January 2004. He had no children.<br>
