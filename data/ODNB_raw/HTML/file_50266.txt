<span class="headword">Bell,  Richard</span>  (<em>b. </em><em>c.</em>1410, <em>d.</em> in or after 1495), <span class="occ">bishop of Carlisle</span>, was almost certainly a native of Durham, where he entered the religious life in 1426 or early 1427. Five years later Bell was sent to Durham College, Oxford, where he held office as one of the two college bursars between Michaelmas 1435 and Michaelmas 1440. Much more surprising was Bell's collation (on 13 February 1441) to the small alien priory of Holy Trinity, York, by Henry VI. This curious episode in Bell's early career would not have been possible without the backing of Henry Percy, second earl of Northumberland (<i>d</i>. 1455), and other northern magnates. In the event the Benedictine monks of Holy Trinity, York, fought so vigorous a campaign against Bell's claims to be their prior that he was forced to withdraw and seek readmission to Durham Cathedral priory in December 1443.<br>
<br>Immediately afterwards Bell rapidly rose to influential office within his community. Steward of the prior's hospice from 1443 to 1447, and monastic almoner from 1447 to 1450, he returned to Oxford as warden of Durham College between 1450 and 1453, a period during which he secured a bachelor's degree in theology. Although several manuscripts that once formed part of Richard Bell's personal library still survive, it was his administrative rather than scholastic talents that led to his recall to the Durham cloister in 1453, where he went on to hold the obediences of hostillar, terrar, and sub-prior before declaring himself a candidate for the prior's office on the resignation of William Ebchester in 1456. On 25 October, after an exceptionally divisive electoral contest, Bell was defeated by John Burnby, who received thirty-eight votes as opposed to his own twenty-five. From 1457 to 1464 Bell accordingly found himself in comparative and no doubt involuntary seclusion as prior of Durham's cell at Finchale. The sudden death of Prior Burnby on 17 October 1464 immediately transformed Bell's future prospects. Five weeks later he was elected prior of Durham, an office he held with considerable success for fourteen years. On the abundant evidence for his priorate, particularly his small register or letter-book, Bell was a highly vigorous superior of his house, and by 1478 seems to have restored his monastery to much greater prosperity than it had enjoyed when he became prior. His most ambitious initiative was to inaugurate a complete reconstruction of the central tower of Durham Cathedral.<br>
<br>As prior of Durham between 1464 and 1478, Richard Bell owed much of his reputation to the skill with which he defended his house amid national political instability and the feuds of many of the northern magnates and gentry. By 1474, if not earlier, the prior had accordingly won the favour of Richard, duke of Gloucester (the future Richard III), with whose powerful support he finally succeeded in securing the bishopric for which he was already intriguing at the curia. On 11 February 1478 Bell's ambitions were at last rewarded by papal provision to the episcopate of Carlisle, although his extraordinary attempt to continue to hold the priorate of Durham <i>in commendam</i> with his new and impoverished bishopric was successfully resisted by his former and now outraged community. He was the last member of the medieval community of St Cuthbert to become a bishop. Unfortunately the evidence for Bell's seventeen-year tenure of the see of Carlisle is much less abundant than that for most earlier stages of his career. Already aged about seventy when he was finally enthroned in Carlisle Cathedral in 1480, he played a progressively less significant role in northern political affairs after that date. However, the surviving accounts of his receivers-general give some impression of his severe financial problems, of his concern with diocesan administration, of his extensive building operations at his palace of Rose Castle, and even of his diet. It was no doubt due to extreme old age that Bell resigned his see (the only bishop of Carlisle to do so between 1246 and 1946) on 4 September 1495. The place and the date of his death remain obscure, unrecorded even in the inscription around his magnificent memorial brass on the floor of the cathedral choir at Carlisle.<br>
