<span class="headword">Walpole,  Richard</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1564, <em>d.</em> 1607), <span class="occ">Jesuit</span>, was baptized at Docking, Norfolk, on 8 October 1564, the son of Christopher Walpole and Margery Beckham. His four brothers included the Jesuits <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28594/', "Henry Walpole (bap. 1558, d. 1595)")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28597/', "Michael Walpole (bap. 1570, d. 1625)")</script>. Richard Walpole entered Peterhouse, Cambridge, on 1 April 1579, a fortnight before his brother Henry left the university. He was elected to one of the scholarships lately founded at his college by Edward, Lord North, but took no degree. In summer 1584 he left England to become an alumnus of the seminary at Rheims. He left after a few months and on 25 April 1585 he entered the English College at Rome. His ability and scholarship were at once recognized and after remaining there for the next four years he was ordained priest at St John Lateran on 3 December 1589 and then sent to Spain. The intention was that he proceed from there to England but instead he gained admittance to St Alban's College, Valladolid, on 1 September 1591 and proceeded from there to St Gregory's, Seville, on 8 November 1592. In the following year he entered the Society of Jesus and spent his life assisting Robert Persons in his work for the English colleges abroad. It was in the course of his work in Seville that he met Edward Squire, who, in 1598, falsely accused him of plotting to assassinate Queen Elizabeth. Squire was hanged and Walpole was defended in writing in &#145;The discoverie and confutation of a tragical fiction&#146; (1598) by Martin Aray, but remained in Spain. After the execution of his brother Henry at York in 1595 Joseph Creswell SJ had written a life of the martyr which had been translated into Spanish. The book produced a favourable impression on Luisa de Carvajal, a rich and pious lady who lived near the college at Valladolid, and she resolved to go as a missionary to England. Richard Walpole was her spiritual director and before leaving for England in 1606 she appointed him her executor. He was prefect of studies and lecturer in cases of conscience at St Gregory's College, Seville, in 1600, then confessor and consultor in Rome until 1604, when he took up residence at Valladolid. In 1603 he published a work of controversy, <span class="italic">A Brief and Cleere Confutation</span>, in response to Matthew Sutcliffe's attack on Persons. He died in Valladolid in September 1607.<br>
<br>His younger brother, Christopher Walpole (1569&#150;1606), was born in October 1569 and was one of John Gerard's early converts when that busy proselytizer was at work in Norfolk. He was admitted as a Jesuit at Rome in September 1592, thus preceding Richard into the society. He obtained permission to join his brother at Seville in 1597 and was probably ordained there between 1600 and 1603. In 1693 he was confessor and lecturer in moral theology at St Alban's College, Valladolid, and predeceased his brother, dying at the college in 1606.<br>
