<span class="headword">Whitworth, Sir  Charles</span>  (<em>c.</em>1721&#150;1778), <span class="occ">politician and writer</span>, was the only son of Francis Whitworth MP (1684&#150;1742) of Leybourne, Kent, and Joan Windham of Clarewell, Gloucestershire. He was the nephew of Charles Whitworth, Baron Whitworth. He was educated at Westminster School (1730&#150;38) and proceeded to Lincoln's Inn in 1738. On his father's death in 1742 he inherited the family estate at Leybourne, and in 1747 he was returned as MP for Minehead, the constituency his father had also represented. On 1 June 1749 he married Martha (<i>d</i>. 1786), eldest daughter of Richard Shelley, commissioner of the stamp office, and niece by marriage of the duke of Newcastle. They had seven children who survived childhood: Catharine (<i>b</i>. 1750), <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29338/', "Charles Whitworth, later Earl Whitworth (1752&#150;1825)")</script>, Mary (<i>b</i>. 1753), Francis (1754&#150;1805), later a lieutenant-colonel in the Royal Artillery, Richard (<i>b</i>. 1755), who was a captain of the Royal Navy and was lost at sea, Priscilla (<i>b</i>. 1760), and Anna Barbara (<i>b</i>. 1763).<br>
<br>Whitworth hoped that his connection with the duke of Newcastle would lead to some favour and he continually pressed the duke for appointment to a government office. His persistence was rewarded when he was awarded a secret service pension of &pound;400 p.a. in February 1755. In August 1758 he persuaded Newcastle to appoint him lieutenant-governor of Gravesend and Tilbury Fort in lieu of his pension. At the general election in 1761, under pressure from Newcastle, he stood down as MP for Minehead in favour of Lord Egremont's candidature and stood successfully for Bletchingley instead. He was returned once more at Minehead in 1768 and represented the constituency until 1774.<br>
<br>As an MP, Whitworth played little part in debate and spoke only on practical matters such as the payment of militia officers, with which he was personally concerned, having served as a major in the West Kent militia since 1759. In May 1768 he secured a post for which he had previously stood in 1765, when he was elected chairman of the twin committees of supply and ways and means, to which &#145;money chair&#146; was attached a secret service pension of &pound;500 p.a. This was a position for which he was well qualified, having published in 1763 <span class="italic">A Collection of the Supplies and Ways and Means from the Revolution to the Present Time</span>. He was knighted on 19 August 1768. He had found his niche in politics, and was a very competent finance chairman for the decade until his death. To accommodate government wishes he continued to be shuffled from one parliamentary seat to another. At the general election in 1774 he was dissuaded by Lord North from standing again at Minehead and was instead returned for East Looe, but in January 1775 he moved to Saltash.<br>
<br>Whitworth wrote a number of political and historical works of reference. In 1764 he published a directory of members of successive parliaments from 1660 to 1761. This was followed by a <span class="italic">List of English, Scots and Irish Nobility</span> (1765) and a historical account of the price of wheat in 1768. He demonstrated his grasp of public finance in his <span class="italic">Public Accounts of Services and Grants, 1721&#150;1771</span> (1771). He also contributed to the 1766 edition of David Lloyd's <span class="italic">State Worthies</span> the &#145;Characters of the kings and queens of England&#146;, and added improvements to the third edition of Timothy Cunningham's <span class="italic">History of the Customs, Aids and Subsidies of England</span> (1778). Chosen one of the vice-presidents of the Society for the Encouragement of Arts, Manufactures, and Commerce, at its meeting on 28 February 1755, he supported the society for the rest of his life. Whitworth died at Bath on 22 August 1778.<br>
