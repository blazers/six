<span class="headword">Wardley,  Jane</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1747&#150;1770), <span class="occ">a founder of the Shakers</span>, is an elusive figure, as the dates of her birth, marriage, and death, and the names of her parents are unknown. She was a tailor who lived with her husband, James Wardley, also a tailor, in Bolton in the 1740s. In 1747 the Wardleys founded a group of religious enthusiasts influenced by Quakerism, Methodism, and the French prophets. The sect combined fervent millennial theology with bodily manifestations of spiritual ecstasy described by an observer in 1769 as gradually accelerated &#145;trembling, shaking and screeching &hellip; at the same time their features are not distinguishable by reason of the quick motion of their heads&#146;  (Morse, 3). According to members of the group they might meditate silently until &#145;they were seized with a mighty trembling&#146; or &#145;singing, shouting, and leaping for joy&#146;, sometimes &#145;swiftly passing and repassing each other, like clouds agitated with a mighty wind&#146;  (Green and Wells, 5). Outsiders derisively termed them &#145;Shaking Quakers&#146; or &#145;Shakers&#146;. Jane Wardley, or &#145;Mother Jane&#146;, was acknowledged as the more spiritually gifted of the couple. She encouraged her followers to practise public confession of sin, and celibacy, or at least celibacy within marriage.<br>
<br>The Wardleys devoted themselves to the nurture of their band of believers, frequently worshipping several times a day. The sect met first in Bolton and later in Manchester, Maretown, and other locations in Lancashire and Cheshire. At the invitation of one of their followers, a bricklayer named John Townley, the Wardleys moved into his spacious home on Cannon Street in Manchester. In 1758 the thirty-member Shaker group was joined by a 22-year-old woman, Ann Lee (1736&#150;1784). At some time in 1766 Ann Lee approached Mother Jane with a problem: the deaths of her four children bore out her conviction that sexual intercourse was always sinful. Jane Wardley reportedly told Ann Lee &#145;James and I lodge together: but we do not touch each other any more than two babes. You may return home and do likewise&#146;  (<span class="italic">Testimonies</span>, 38).<br>
<br>Jane Wardley saw the doctrinal ground of Shakerism shift after Ann Lee was released from a prison stay in 1770. While imprisoned Ann Lee had experienced a vision outlining the centrality of celibacy to Shaker theology. After that time the Wardleys deferred to the spiritual leadership of Ann Lee and saw their adherents drift away, discouraged by Lee's more rigorous insistence on public confession and celibacy. Ann Lee and eight followers emigrated to America in 1774, and most remaining English Shakers abandoned the faith, including the Wardleys' patron, John Townley. According to the nineteenth-century historian William Axon the Wardleys moved into an almshouse and died there, at unknown dates. Jane Wardley certainly died before Ann Lee's own death in 1784 because Ann Lee told her American followers &#145;I have seen Jane in the world of spirits, praising God in the dance&#146;  (Evans, 154). By the time the Shaker apostate Thomas Brown published a history of the Shakers in 1812 Jane Wardley was viewed by the Shakers as a female John the Baptist, whose role was &#145;to prepare the way for the second appearing of Christ, in the order of the female [Ann Lee]&#146;  (Brown, 312).<br>
