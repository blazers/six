<span class="headword">Housman,  Clemence Annie</span>  (1861&#150;1955), <span class="occ">illustrator and suffragette</span>, was born on 23 November 1861 at Bromsgrove (her birth registered, nameless, as &#145;female&#146;), the third child and first daughter of Edward Housman (1831&#150;1894), a solicitor, and his wife, Sarah Jane Williams (1828&#150;1871). Her eldest brother was the poet <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/34013/', "A. E. Housman (1859&#150;1936)")</script>. Clemence was educated at home by a governess. By her early twenties she was undertaking much of her father's clerical work; a second brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/34014/', "Laurence Housman")</script>, recorded that she &#145;was, for two or three years, the expert who worked out all the Income tax calculations for half the County of Worcestershire&#146;  (L. Housman, 94). Her mother died when she was nine, charging her with special responsibility for Laurence, four years her junior. Indeed Laurence Housman records in his autobiography that it was only in order to look after him in London that Clemence was eventually &#145;released from the Victorian bonds of home&#146;  (ibid., 104).<br>
<br>In 1883, having been left a small legacy, Clemence Housman went with Laurence to London and trained as a wood-engraver at the City and Guilds South London Technical Art School at Kennington, and at the Millers' Lane City and Guilds School in South Lambeth. After a year away from home, Clemence was very nearly recalled in order to provide domestic support for her stepmother and younger siblings. She did, however, &#145;claim a return to freedom&#146;  (L. Housman, 110) after inheriting another legacy. The brother and sister lived for fourteen years in Marloes Road in Kensington and then, in 1903, settled in Pembroke Cottages, Edwardes Square, which they took over from the artist William Rothenstein. Clemence Housman gained employment as a wood-engraver, at first providing illustrations for such weekly illustrated papers as <span class="italic">The Graphic</span> and the <span class="italic">Illustrated London News</span>. Then, as wood-engraving was superseded by photomechanical &#145;process&#146; engraving for commercial work, she began to work for such fine private presses as C. R. Ashbee's Essex House Press and James Guthrie's Pear Tree Press. She also published two novels of Christian allegory. The first, <span class="italic">The Were-Wolf</span>, was written to entertain her fellow students in the engraving class at Kennington and was first published in <span class="italic">Atalanta</span>, and then in 1896, illustrated by Laurence Housman, by John Lane at the Bodley Head. The second, <span class="italic">The Unknown Sea</span>, was published by Duckworth in 1898. She based her third novel, <span class="italic">The Life of Sir Aglovale de Galis</span> (1905), on a story, teased out of Malory's <span class="italic">Morte d'Arthur</span>, of a knight who put truth above honour. Laurence Housman, not one to underestimate his own talent, always considered Clemence the finer literary artist and in 1954 arranged for the publication by Cape of a new edition of <span class="italic">Sir Aglovale</span>. The only other of her publications to be traced is a short story, &#145;The Drawn Arrow&#146;, published in <span class="italic">31 Stories by Thirty and One Authors</span>, edited by Ernest Rhys and C. A. Dawson Scott and published by D. Appleton &amp; Co. (New York) in 1923.<br>
<br>In 1908 Clemence Housman subscribed to the militant suffragist Women's Social and Political Union and in 1909 was a co-founder of the Suffrage Atelier, which described itself as &#145;An Arts and Crafts Society Working for the Enfranchisement of Women&#146;. Laurence Housman described her as the atelier's &#145;chief worker&#146;  (L. Housman, 274) and the studio in the Housmans' garden became a centre of banner making. Clemence Housman worked on three banners designed by her brother: the &#145;Prison to citizenship&#146; banner for the Kensington WSPU in 1908; that for the Hampstead branch of the Church League for Women's Suffrage (now in the Museum of London); and that for the United Suffragists in 1914. She also made a banner (1913), now lost, for the Conservative and Unionist Women's Franchise Association, and may have worked on those of the Oxford Graduates, the Women's Tax Resistance League, and the Actresses' Franchise League. She was kept busy repairing banners damaged in use.<br>
<br>In 1910 Clemence Housman became a member of the committee of the Tax Resistance League, doubtless inspired to follow this particular form of protest by her youthful involvement with income tax forms. On 30 September 1911 she was the first woman arrested for following that society's precepts; she had for eighteen months refused to pay inhabited house duty. Her reward was a prison sentence with all its attendant publicity. A photograph of her arrest appeared in the <span class="italic">Evening Standard</span> and the Tax Resistance League organized a procession and demonstration to protest against her imprisonment. She was released after a week, no reason being given, and did not pay her debt until she received the right to vote in 1918. After Mrs Pankhurst's statue was unveiled in Victoria Gardens in 1930, Clemence Housman for many years supplied it with flowers. She and Laurence were, from before the First World War, close friends of Roger and Sarah Bancroft Clark, both parties sharing an interest in women's suffrage and pacifism. In 1924 the Housmans moved to Street, home of the Clarks' family shoemaking business. Clemence Housman's relationship with her brother Laurence remained intense throughout her life. In her last years she declined into senility, suffering a severe stroke in 1953, and was cared for assiduously by her brother and by Roger and Sarah Clark. She died on 6 December 1955 at Mount Avalon, Glastonbury, having suffered a further stroke, and was buried at Smallcombe cemetery outside Bath, alongside her brother Robert (<i>d</i>. 1905) and her sister Kate (<i>d</i>. 1945).<br>
