<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Lloyd,  George Walter Selwyn</span>  (1913&#150;1998), <span class="occ">composer</span>, was born at St Ives, Cornwall, on 28 June 1913, the son of William Alexander Charles Lloyd (1885&#150;1951), gentleman, and his wife, Constance Priestley, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Rawson (1889&#150;1985). Chronic rheumatic fever meant that he was denied a conventional education. However, he spent his childhood in a house overlooking St Ives' Bay, where the arts, and especially music, were highly prized and often practised. Each weekend musicians would come to a big artist's studio in the house and play chamber works. Lloyd's father had the musical and literary tastes of a connoisseur and a particularly advanced knowledge of Italian opera. The education Lloyd had at home was probably better than he would have acquired at most public schools of the time: it equipped him with a wide knowledge of literature, the classics, history, and the arts that would inform his career as a composer.<br>
<br>Lloyd showed a precocious talent for music that his enlightened parents were keen to develop. He was playing the violin by the age of five, and by the time he was ten had started to compose. William Lloyd would, as an exercise, give his son short scenes from English plays for him to set to music. If he found it difficult, his father would show him what Bellini or Verdi had done in such a situation. As a consequence, Lloyd had a deep understanding of Italian operatic method at a very early age. In his teens his father arranged for him to have violin lessons with Albert Sammons and counterpoint lessons from C. H. Kitson, and to learn composition from Harry Farjeon at the Royal Academy of Music. This training paid off, for Lloyd's music is distinguished by bright orchestration that betrays the composer's deep understanding of the capabilities of every instrument. His writing for brass was particularly fine, and later in life he wrote many pieces for brass band. This intensive musical education, and a love of the Romantics, especially Verdi and Brahms, led to Lloyd's writing his first symphony at the age of nineteen. It was given its premi&egrave;re by the Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra in 1933, thanks to the patronage of the orchestra's conductor, Sir Dan Godfrey.<br>
<br>Unlike his exact contemporary Benjamin Britten, Lloyd was motivated to write beautiful tunes for their own sake rather than to produce music as a result of intense intellectualization, experiment, or&#151;in the pre-war years&#151;turbulent emotional experiences. This attachment to the musical forms of the nineteenth century would, in time, cause him to be viewed as an anachronism by those responsible for programming music for concerts and for broadcasting; but until 1939 he enjoyed popularity, success, and celebrity. No sooner had his first symphony been launched than he wrote an opera, <span class="italic">Iernin</span>, with a libretto by his father based on a Cornish legend. Frank Howes, the music critic of <span class="italic">The Times</span>, happened to be on holiday in Cornwall and saw a performance at Penzance in November 1934. He wrote an enthusiastic review, saying that &#145;Lloyd showed the rarest of all qualities in a British composer, an almost unerring perception of what the stage requires&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 7 Nov 1934).<br>
<br>This encomium resulted in the opera's being staged at the Lyceum in London in June the following year. Its three-week run was the third longest in English operatic history, and it closed only because a heatwave made the theatre intolerable. No less a master than Ralph Vaughan Williams told Lloyd: &#145;It isn't fair. I've been trying to write operas like that all my life and here you are, a youth of 21, and you do it first time&#146;  (<span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span>, 6 July 1998). Lloyd was already at work on a second opera, <span class="italic">The Serf</span>. It was performed at Covent Garden in 1938, this time thanks partly to the admiration Sir Thomas Beecham had for the work of the young composer. His second symphony, like the third (written contemporaneously with the first), was first performed at Eastbourne in 1935. The third was taken up by the BBC Symphony Orchestra on the recommendation of John Ireland, another admirer of <span class="italic">Iernin</span>, and a man who became something of a mentor to Lloyd. Its premi&egrave;re was in a BBC concert of contemporary music in London in November 1935, conducted by the 22-year-old composer. The BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra offered Lloyd the post of conductor, but his father dissuaded him, counselling instead that his future lay in composition. The following year, on holiday in Switzerland, he met Nancy Kathleen Juvet (1913&#150;2000), whom he married on 22 January 1937. In the course of their sixty-one-year marriage, Nancy Lloyd provided support for her husband and his work that was literally vital.<br>
<br>The advent of the Second World War put a brake on Lloyd's meteoric career and almost ended it. A deeply patriotic man, he did not hesitate to enlist in the Royal Marines, and he played the cornet in a military band. On active service, this meant he doubled up as a gunner. In 1942 he served on the Arctic convoys on HMS <i>Trinidad</i>. She was badly damaged after one of her own torpedoes executed a U-turn and hit her. Lloyd was rescued, though only after seeing many of his fellow gunners drown in oil. His lungs were damaged by oil, and a combination of severe shell-shock and trauma, on top of his weak constitution, caused a complete mental and physical collapse. His doctors told his wife he might have to be institutionalized for the rest of his life. She refused to believe it, and resolved to nurse him back to health. Slowly, she succeeded. His recovery advanced when, at the end of the war, the couple were able to go to Switzerland. He began to write music again, usually only for half an hour early each morning before the strain overcame him.<br>
<br>Lloyd's first post-war work was his epic fourth symphony, finished in 1946. Regarded by many aficionados as his masterpiece, it begins in great gloom that suggests the Arctic convoys, but ends with the triumph of life over death. A fifth symphony followed in 1948, though neither received a performance at the time. None the less, Lloyd and his father were commissioned by the Arts Council to write an opera for the 1951 Festival of Britain. The result was <span class="italic">John Socman</span>, about a Wiltshire soldier returning from Agincourt. The production toured round England with the Carl Rosa Company but was a disaster, mainly because of artistic differences between director and conductor. Lloyd, still emotionally fragile after his war experiences, lacked the strength to confront and overcome this disappointment. He decided with his wife to abandon music as a way of life. In 1949 they had bought a market garden at Folke, near Sherborne in Dorset, and this became their home and their life for more than twenty years.<br>
<br>Lloyd continued to write music, rising at 4.30 a.m. for three hours' composition before the start of his day's work growing carnations and mushrooms. Although his horticultural business was a success and soon expanded, nothing happened to alleviate his gloom about his music. Manuscripts sent to the BBC in the hope of performance were returned unread. Impresarios were uninterested. Musical opinion was by then in fee to serialism and atonality, modes Lloyd completely rejected. &#145;I never wrote 12-tone music because I didn't like the theory&#146;, he later said. &#145;I studied the blessed thing in the 1930s and thought it was a cock-eyed idea that produced horrible sounds. It made composers forget how to sing&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 6 July 1998). Sir William Glock, the BBC's music director, drew up a blacklist of composers whose works failed to match his own modernist tastes, and Lloyd's name was on it. At the time, such a refusal of patronage created a formidable hurdle.<br>
<br>In 1973, both aged sixty, Lloyd and his wife sold their horticultural business and moved back to London. Lloyd had a soundproofed room built in his flat near Marylebone Station in which he could embark on a new era of composition&#151;a bold step which was in part the result of a slight upturn in his artistic fortunes. Two conductors, Sir Charles Groves and Sir Edward Downes, had in the 1960s launched a rearguard action on Lloyd's behalf. Most successful of all, however, was the pianist John Ogdon. In recognition of Ogdon's friendship, Lloyd had earlier written a piano concerto, <span class="italic">Scapegoat</span>, for him, which the dedicatee performed with the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra under Groves in 1964. Five years later Ogdon showed the BBC the score of Lloyd's eighth symphony without revealing the name of the composer. It was accepted, though the BBC waited until 1977 to perform it. After the eighth's premi&egrave;re, which was a great popular success, the BBC Philharmonic Orchestra under Sir Edward Downes set about championing Lloyd's music. In terms of his personal renaissance, 1981 was an <i>annus mirabilis</i> for him. His sixth symphony was included in the Proms, to great acclaim, and Lyrita Records recorded, under Downes, the fourth, fifth, and eighth symphonies. A relay from the Cheltenham festival of the fourth symphony&#151;its first performance, ecstatically received, thirty-five years after it was written&#151;seemed to set the seal not just on Lloyd's cultural rehabilitation but on his status as a considerable composer. A prodigious Indian summer followed. This was due in part to Peter Kermani, an American industrialist and sponsor of the Albany Symphony Orchestra in New York state. The orchestra recorded all of Lloyd's main works, and many minor ones, between the mid-1980s and the composer's death. A huge new audience in America led to better promotion of his music in Britain. This not only expanded the audience for Lloyd's music, and brought him, in his early eighties, an income from his work: it also forced a critical reappraisal of his output that was, on the whole, positive.<br>
<br>The Indian summer also inspired Lloyd to a prodigious output of music in the last fifteen years of his life, though it unquestionably put strains on his ever-delicate health. In all he wrote twelve symphonies, the last two receiving performances in 1986 and 1990 respectively. He turned increasingly to choral music in his last years. There were four notable works in this genre: <span class="italic">The Vigil of Venus</span>, whose first performance was at the Festival Hall in 1989; the <span class="italic">Symphonic Mass</span>, which the composer conducted at the Brighton festival in 1993; <span class="italic">A Litany</span>, settings of John Donne first performed at the Festival Hall in March 1996; and his <span class="roman">Requiem</span>, the posthumous premi&egrave;re of which took place in Oxford in April 2000. Despite his advancing years and his and his wife's increasing frailty, both of them travelled around the world to give performances of and record his music; they made frequent trips to America and to the Far East when Lloyd was well into his eighties.<br>
<br>Lloyd was a generous, modest, immensely likeable man of utter artistic integrity. He eschewed fashion because it did not chime with the convictions that motivated his art, and the neglect he endured as a result was something he bore with great moral courage. One critical assessment of him after his death had it that, &#145;though the idiom of his music was totally traditional, consistently tonal and lyrical in a late romantic way, it was only rarely imitative &hellip; his music had its own distinctive flavour&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Guardian</span>, 8 July 1998). His genial and gentle exterior, which projected a remarkable youthfulness well into his old age, concealed fiercely held views. A committed free-marketeer, he deplored composers who demanded public subsidies to write music, for he felt it was a sure way to give the public what it did not want. He believed he could earn a living by giving audiences what they did want and, though it took him most of his life to achieve this, in the end he did. &#145;Composers cannot go on despising their audiences&#146;, he once observed. &#145;I like the same sort of thing the average person likes. I write what pleases me&#146;  (<span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span>, 6 July 1998).<br>
<br>Lloyd died at University College Hospital, Marylebone, London, on 3 July 1998 after a year of increasing heart trouble, and was cremated at Golders Green crematorium on 10 July. He completed his last work, appropriately enough the <span class="roman">Requiem</span>, three weeks before he died. He was survived by his wife; there were no children of the marriage.<br>
