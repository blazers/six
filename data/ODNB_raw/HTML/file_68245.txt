<span class="headword">Coote,  William Alexander</span>  (1842&#150;1919), <span class="occ">moral reform campaigner</span>, was born at 10 Norfolk Street, Strand, London, on 24 December 1842, son of William Coote (<i>d</i>. 1845/6), painter (originally of Queen's county, Ireland), and his wife, Mary Ann, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Forbes. His father died when he was three years old: the loss of status and material comfort that resulted, he was to recall, &#145;was indelibly carved on my mind&#146;, though he also noted that, &#145;with the ease of childhood I forgot my troubles, and soon adopted the ways and some of the habits of the boys of the neighbourhood&#146;  (Coote, <span class="italic">Romance</span>, 21). He &#145;was never fond of school&#146; and left formal education at the age of twelve to train as a compositor in the firm of a relative who was a master printer.<br>
<br>Life as a wage-earner led to an immediate increase in Coote's self-esteem but also exposed him, as teenage &#145;leader of about forty lads of my own age&#146;, to the temptations of central London. His &#145;chief amusement&#146; was boxing, a fact he later deplored while admitting that the training was &#145;of immense value to me in life&#146;. At the age of sixteen, after a late-night encounter with &#145;three young men who offered me a religious tract&#146;, he had a conversion experience. This led him to break with his teenage companions and to commit himself to a programme of self-education in compensation for &#145;the many neglected educational opportunities of which my conversion had made me conscious&#146;  (Coote, <span class="italic">Romance</span>, 22&#150;3).<br>
<br>On 25 June 1864 Coote married Eliza Palmer, daughter of Joseph William Palmer, deceased, a sailor, with whom he had, by 1881, two sons and four daughters. Over the same period his career as a compositor prospered, the opportunities having expanded rapidly in an era which saw the development of popular literacy and of the commercial press. It was in this period that Coote began to demonstrate his capacity for organization and leadership once again, first by playing a role in the printing trades' campaign for shorter working hours, thereafter by securing election in 1880 to represent his craft association, the London Society of Compositors, at the Trades Union Congress. His interest in campaigns for shorter hours was thereafter to lead him, about 1889, to support the formation of a union for local government workers, the National Municipal and Incorporated Vestry Employees Union (of which he claimed to be the founding organizer).<br>
<br>By the early 1880s Coote was clearly ambitious to move directly into public life. From his local government base as a Camberwell vestryman he tried unsuccessfully to gain endorsement as a Liberal parliamentary candidate. His subsequent attempt to combine public service with making a living succeeded. In 1885, with the patronage of the crusading journalist W. T. Stead, he accepted nomination as foundation co-secretary of Stead's National Vigilance Association. The association, set up to campaign for the enforcement of the 1885 <span class="roman">Criminal Law Amendment Act</span>, which raised the age of consent for girls, was to be Coote's base for the rest of his career. As secretary (or equivalent) between 1886 and his death he was to exhibit the twin characteristics that had first recommended him to Stead&#151;excellent organizational skills and unswerving commitment to the cause of &#145;social purity&#146;. As secretary he emerged as a leading player in late-century campaigns to enforce &#145;decency&#146; both in public behaviour and in literature. His admirers by the 1890s included Isabella Burton, widow of the anthropologist Sir Richard Burton, who made him her literary executor. His critics included Bernard Shaw who described him as &#145;a person of real importance &hellip; thoroughly respectable&#146;, yet &#145;in artistic matters a most intensely stupid man, and on sexual questions something of a monomaniac&#146;  (Shaw, 443).<br>
<br>By the turn of the new century Coote had managed to extend his public reputation even further through his role as key organizer of an international campaign against the white slave trade. This was work that had begun in 1898 when, after an episode of &#145;reverie&#146; resolving itself into a &#145;Divine Vision&#146;, he began a series of visits to &#145;every capital in Europe&#146; in the hope of mobilizing an international policing network  (Coote, <span class="italic">Vision</span>, 21). Though hampered by his inability to speak any foreign language, he became the acknowledged leader of the International Bureau for the Suppression of the White Slave Traffic, the sponsoring organization for a series of European congresses between 1899 and the outbreak of war in 1914.<br>
<br>On the home front over the same period Coote's pursuit of indecency continued unrelentingly. In 1901 he joined Bishop Creighton of London in founding the local government pressure group the London Council for the Promotion of Public Morality. In 1906, after successfully lobbying the Metropolitan Police for a crack-down on street prostitution, he felt able to declare London &#145;an open-air cathedral&#146;  (<span class="italic">Parl. papers</span>, 1908, 50, Cd 4260, question 6958). From his post at the National Vigilance Association he helped to co-ordinate pressure on government to sponsor the 1912 <span class="roman">Criminal Law Amendment Act</span>, which was aimed at the white slave traffic. By the coming of war in 1914, however, Coote's vision of moral reform as a state-assisted campaign against individual sin was coming to seem increasingly outdated to those who sought to revalue human sexual drives as impulses to be harnessed to &#145;race improvement&#146;. By the war's end, indeed, Coote was to make an open break with the war-assisted &#145;social hygiene&#146; movement, unable to reconcile its open discussion of sexual behaviour with his own priority of repressing obscenity  (Mort, 204).<br>
<br>Coote died of &#145;malignant disease of the bladder&#146; at his home, 161 Grove Lane, Camberwell, London, on 26 October 1919, having been appointed OBE the previous year. After a funeral at St Matthew's Church, Denmark Hill, he was buried at Forest Hill cemetery on 31 October.<br>
<br>Public appreciation of Coote's work had always been mixed. Bernard Shaw, while deploring his single-minded philistinism, simultaneously acknowledged &#145;achievements which we must all admit honourable to him&#146;; Josephine Butler, his one-time co-worker in the rescue of the innocent from sexual exploitation, came to deplore him as &#145;most unsound&#146; and one who &#145;loves coercion&#146;. All were able to agree that (in the words of the <span class="italic">Vigilance Record</span>, Nov 1919, 85) he was &#145;practically adroit&#146; and displayed &#145;extraordinary perseverance&#146;. In his tenacity and puritanism he can be recognized as, in many ways, an embodiment of the respectable and upwardly mobile working-class male of the later Victorian and Edwardian era.<br>
