<span class="headword">Mendham,  Joseph</span>  (1769&#150;1856), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and religious controversialist</span>, was born in London on 14 February 1769 and baptized on 10 March of that year in the parish of St Stephen Walbrook. He was the sixth of the nine children of Robert Mendham (1737&#150;1810), a successful merchant in the City of London, and his wife, Margaret Scott (<i>d</i>. 1812). He was educated at St Edmund Hall, Oxford, matriculating on 27 January 1789, and graduating BA in 1792 and MA in 1795. Here he imbibed a strongly evangelical atmosphere; St Edmund Hall has been described as &#145;the headquarters of evangelicalism at Oxford&#146;  (Reynolds, 58), and its vice-principal, Isaac Crouch, impressed evangelical values upon several generations of undergraduates. Mendham was ordained deacon in 1793 and priest in the following year, in each case by George Tomline, bishop of Lincoln. In 1795 the pattern for the rest of his life was set by his marriage on 15 December to Maria Riland (<i>d</i>. 1841), daughter of the Revd John Riland, rector of Sutton Coldfield. He and his wife had two children, a son, Robert Riland Mendham (<i>d</i>. 1857), and a daughter, Anna Maria Mendham (<i>d</i>. 1872). Equally significantly, Mendham immediately became curate to his father-in-law at Sutton Coldfield, and resided there until his death.<br>
<br>John Riland had been assistant to Henry Venn (1725&#150;1797), vicar of Huddersfield and a leading evangelical; he was himself an admired figure in the evangelical revival and Mendham came to share his father-in-law's moderate Calvinism, his emphasis on the importance of personal salvation, and his devotion to pastoral duty. He served the parish of Sutton Coldfield conscientiously until he relinquished his curacy in 1826; he also served as warden of the corporation in 1807 and 1808. Having received substantial legacies from his parents, Mendham possessed sufficient financial independence to disdain the quest for clerical preferment and to concentrate upon his two principal interests, book collection and anti-Catholic controversial writing.<br>
<br>From his youth Mendham had amassed a library of religious literature, mainly from the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. He was particularly interested in Reformation and post-Reformation controversies and had read widely among both protestant and Catholic authors. He strongly adhered to the protestant side in controversies of this nature, which he viewed in the context of contemporary Catholic campaigns for political emancipation. He devoted much attention to the alleged tyrannies and superstitions of the Church of Rome, which he attempted to expose by detailed quotation from Catholic sources. In the 1820s Mendham published three works of this kind, of which the most influential was <span class="italic">An Account of the Indexes, Prohibitory and Expurgatory, of the Church of Rome</span> (1826). However, the most important event of his career as a writer was the <span class="roman">Catholic Emancipation Act</span> of 1829, which led to allegations in some tory circles of betrayal of the protestant constitution. Mendham shared this opinion, supporting the British Society for Promoting the Religious Principles of the Reformation (or Reformation Society) and redoubling his literary efforts. His fear of growing Catholic numbers was made plain in his <span class="italic">Address to the Inhabitants of Sutton Coldfield</span> (1834), and his claim that the Catholic church was irremediably repressive was repeated in his <span class="italic">Index of prohibited books &hellip; being the latest specimen of the literary policy of the Church of Rome</span> (1840). His most scholarly work was <span class="italic">Memoirs of the Council of Trent</span> (1834, with a supplement in 1836), in which he reprinted a series of contemporary manuscript sources and displayed an impressive command of Spanish and Italian. His work was favourably reviewed in such strongly protestant periodicals as the <span class="italic">Church of England Quarterly Review</span> and the <span class="italic">Protestant Journal</span>, while his scholarly antiquarianism led him to make several contributions to the early issues of <span class="italic">Notes and Queries</span>.<br>
<br>In 1836 Mendham became perpetual curate of Hill, near Sutton Coldfield, where a chapel had been constructed to meet the needs of an increasing local population. But he was soon obliged by ill health to relinquish this living, and after the death of his wife in 1841 lived quietly with his son at Sutton Coldfield. He died there on 1 November 1856 at the age of eighty-seven, and was buried at Holy Trinity Church, Sutton Coldfield, on 6 November. His library of some 5000 volumes passed to his son and subsequently to his nephew, John Mendham, whose widow bequeathed it to the Law Society in 1869. Since the 1980s the collection has been on loan to Canterbury Cathedral Library.<br>
<br>By nature reserved and, latterly, almost reclusive, Mendham had little in common with the more raucous types of English anti-Catholicism of the mid-nineteenth century, although his work was used by popular protestant writers as a valuable source of information. But he represented a branch of conservative evangelical opinion in a period of increasing religious pluralism, and his genuine, if highly partial, scholarship amounted to a serious contribution to ecclesiastical history.<br>
