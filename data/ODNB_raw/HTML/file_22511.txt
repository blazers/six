<span class="headword">Poole,  Arthur William</span>  (1852&#150;1885), <span class="occ">bishop in Japan</span>, the son of Thomas Francis Poole and his wife, Jane, was born at Shrewsbury on 6 August 1852. He was educated at Shrewsbury School, and went in Michaelmas term 1869 to Worcester College, Oxford; he took a third class both in the classical moderations in 1871 and in the final classical school in 1873. He graduated BA in 1873, MA in 1876, and DD in 1883. On leaving Oxford Poole became a tutor. He thought of medicine as a profession, but in 1876, having abandoned a leaning towards the Plymouth Brethren, he was ordained deacon, and became curate of St Aldates, Oxford. Early in boyhood Poole had wished to be a missionary, and the old desire was renewed in March 1876 by an appeal for men to aid in educational work at Masulipatam. After some hesitation Poole offered himself to the Church Missionary Society, on 20 June 1876. He was accepted, and sailed for India in October 1877, having married that year Sarah Ann Pearson, who bore him several children.<br>
<br>At Masulipatam, Poole threw himself into the work of the Noble High School, and fostered the growth of Christian literature in the vernacular. However, early in 1879 he showed signs of consumption and, after twice visiting the Nilgiri hills, he was invalided home in June 1880. There was little prospect of his being able to return to India, and he resigned in October 1882. At the anniversary meeting of the Church Missionary Society in May 1883, a speech by Poole attracted the attention of the archbishop of Canterbury, E. W. Benson, who offered him the missionary bishopric in Japan which it had just been decided to establish. After much hesitation and with reassuring reports from the medical board, Poole accepted the offer, and was consecrated at Lambeth in London on St Luke's day 1883. He was warmly received in Japan, where he was based at Kobe, and at once began to visit the chief missionary stations in his diocese. But, his health failing, he spent the winter of 1884&#150;5 in California. He did not recover, but returned to England, and died at his home, Fairfield, Coton Hill, Shrewsbury, on 14 July 1885, his wife surviving him. Bishop Poole Memorial Girls' Schools was founded in his memory in Osaka.<br>
