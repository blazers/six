<span class="headword">Cookes, Sir  Thomas</span>, second baronet  (<em>bap. </em>1648, <em>d.</em> 1701), <span class="occ">benefactor</span>, was baptized on 6 December 1648 at Feckenham, Worcestershire. He was the elder son of Sir William Cookes (<i>c</i>.1616&#150;1672) of Norgrove, Worcestershire, and his second wife, Mercy, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Dinely (1628/9&#150;1694). William Cookes, a royalist descended from an old, wealthy Worcestershire family, was created a baronet on 24 December 1664: an honour which cost him &pound;1095.<br>
<br>Thomas Cookes matriculated from Pembroke College, Oxford, as a gentleman commoner on 7 June 1667, and was admitted to Lincoln's Inn on 26 June 1669. He succeeded to the baronetcy on the death of his father in July 1672, and on 28 August 1672 he married Mary Windsor (1658/9&#150;1695), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29726/', "Thomas Windsor, Lord Windsor (later first earl of Plymouth)")</script>, and niece of the celebrated George Savile, marquess of Halifax (1633&#150;1695). Cookes's bride was aged thirteen or fourteen; he was twenty-three. His seat was Bentley Pauncefote at Tardebigge, Worcestershire, but he owned property in sixteen west midlands parishes and in London: an inheritance perhaps all the larger because his younger brother, William, died in 1673, aged twenty-two.<br>
<br>Lady Mary Cookes died on 3 January 1695. On 6 December 1695 the widower married another young bride, Lucy (<i>b</i>. 1681), daughter of Bernard Whalley of Billesley, Warwickshire, and his wife, Lucy, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Baldwin. Both of Sir Thomas's marriages were childless, but he preserved his name through educational charities. He endowed and virtually refounded Bromsgrove School in 1693 and did the same for Feckenham School in 1696. More significantly, by the terms of his will, made on 19 February 1697, he left &pound;10,000 in trust to endow a new college in Oxford University or to add to an existing foundation there. At this new or augmented foundation, as yet unnamed and unlocated, preference would be given to Bromsgrove and Feckenham schools and to Cookes's kin in the election of scholars and fellows. The archbishop of Canterbury, three other bishops, and all twenty-five heads of Oxford colleges and halls were named as trustees of the benefaction.<br>
<br>When Sir Thomas's intentions for Oxford became known, the claims of Gloucester Hall were pressed by its principal, Benjamin Woodroffe (1638&#150;1711), who by the end of 1698 obtained a charter of incorporation (which proved to be invalid in law) and drew up confused statutes for the new college in terms that temporarily antagonized Cookes. The case for Balliol College was then put by its future master John Baron (<i>c</i>.1669&#150;1722). Both claimants approached Sir Thomas directly, both preached highly partisan sermons on charity in Feckenham church (Baron in 1699, Woodroffe in 1700), and both produced printed arguments in 1702.<br>
<br>Cookes died on 8 June 1701 and was buried on 10 June beside his first wife in Tardebigge church. His will was proved on 9 July 1701, but the trustees were politically divided and very slow to interpret and execute his intentions regarding the gift to Oxford. In 1707 they decided that it should go to Magdalen Hall, but Simon Harcourt (1661?&#150;1727), the lord keeper, decreed in the court of chancery on 31 October 1712 that it had been Cookes's intention that his charity, now swollen by interest to &pound;15,000, should go to Gloucester Hall. The trustees reluctantly accepted his decree on 16 November 1713, and Gloucester Hall was formally incorporated as Worcester College on 29 July 1714. One witness in the chancery case declared that Cookes &#145;was a very wavering and unsteady and humoursome man in the manageing of his affairs&#146;  (Worcester College Archives, deposition of William Cookes, April 1712, 7), and others testified to the same effect. However, Harcourt had probably correctly divined Sir Thomas's settled wishes, even though his own primary concern was to increase his political influence in the university by ensuring that his chaplain, Richard Blechinden (1668&#150;1736), became principal of Gloucester Hall on Woodroffe's death in 1711 and subsequently provost of Worcester College. Blechinden was a far less colourful character and a less able scholar than Woodroffe, but a more competent man of affairs.<br>
<br>Cookes left a fee-simple estate of about &pound;3000 p.a. and a personal estate of &pound;40,000, including the &pound;10,000 for Oxford. His will stipulated arrangements for his burial beside his first wife, but made no mention of the woman he had married just over a year before making the will: presumably she already had an adequate settlement. After Cookes's death she married Charles Knotsford of Queenhill, Worcestershire. Cookes's residuary legatee and executor was his nephew and godson, Thomas Winford (1673&#150;1744), who took his uncle's name and, on the death in 1702 of his own father, a baronet, became Sir Thomas Cookes Winford; he was MP for Worcestershire from 1707 to 1710 and supported Gloucester Hall's claim to his uncle's gift.<br>
