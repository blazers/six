<span class="headword">Sturge,  Sophia</span>  (1795&#150;1845), <span class="occ">slavery abolitionist</span>, was born at Elberton, Gloucestershire, on 17 August 1795, the fifth of the twelve children of Joseph Sturge (1763&#150;1817), grazier, and Mary Marshall (<i>d</i>. 1819), only child of Thomas Marshall, steward of the marquess of Hertford. The two families had been members of the Society of Friends since the seventeenth century, and Sophia was brought up to observe the Quaker values of the day.<br>
<br>A chronic invalid&#151;she described herself as a victim of disease and medicine from infancy&#151;Sophia Sturge was educated at a school in Wellington, an experience that she remembered as &#145;not the happiest of my life&#146;  (S. Sturge to John Sturge, 23 June 1829, Sturge family MSS). In the straitened circumstances of a large family her mother took a strong line against superfluous educational subjects and denied her the drawing and French lessons that she requested. The brothers and sisters subsequently compensated as best they could for their narrow education, and their correspondence shows them to have been a circle of autodidacts eagerly exchanging ideas on the literature and events of the day: Sophia Sturge's letters refer to the <span class="italic">Edinburgh Review</span> and writers including Walter Scott and Lord Byron. During the political furore arising from George IV's attempts to divorce Queen Caroline, she wrote of her wish to see only moderate reform lest the cry of liberty might lead on to disorder and despotism.<br>
<br>In 1815 Sophia Sturge joined her brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26746/', "Joseph Sturge (1793&#150;1859)")</script> at Bewdley as his housekeeper. For a time she was also the bookkeeper of the partnership J. and C. Sturge, which he had set up with one of their brothers after their move to Birmingham. From their earliest days her &#145;great love&#146; for Joseph was evident  (Mary Sturge to Thomas Marshall, 8 Dec 1803, Marshall MSS), and on her deathbed she spoke of her idolatry of him. His marriage to Eliza Cropper in 1834 was a breaking of &#145;tender bonds&#146; for her  (S. Sturge to Mary Darby Sturge [1834?], Sturge family MSS), when she was displaced from his household and unhappily took employment as a governess; but on Eliza's death in 1835 she resumed her position in his home, 64 Wheeley's Road, Edgbaston, where she remained for the rest of her life.<br>
<br>Like many women Quakers of that era Sophia Sturge had a formidable personality; her obituary in <span class="italic">The Pilot</span> described her as a woman with a &#145;vigorous intellect and understanding universally well informed&#146;. As his secretary and confidante she was one of the mainstays of Joseph Sturge's public life as a reformer, and he deferred to her opinions. Although she was alarmed by his discussions with Feargus O'Connor and other militant Chartists in 1842, her views were radical enough to endorse his support of complete suffrage.<br>
<br>For an invalid Sophia Sturge was surprisingly active in many benevolent projects. She was one of the founders of the Birmingham Ladies Society for the Relief of Negro Slaves, which was virtually the headquarters of a nationwide campaign by women during the 1820s. At a time when the male abolitionists could not decide between immediate and gradual emancipation, women campaigners opted for the former and organized a boycott of slave-produced sugar. Many years later Joseph remembered his sister calling on some 3000 families in Birmingham to seek their support. When the slaves were set free, as secretary of the Birmingham Ladies Negro's Friend Society, Sophia Sturge tried to help them to adjust to the conditions of freedom; in 1844, for example, a school for which she had raised funds was opened in Jamaica. Sympathizing with the American anti-slavery movement, she became a friend and correspondent of Lewis Tappan, one of the leaders.<br>
<br>Sophia Sturge died on 6 June 1845 at 64 Wheeley's Road, Edgbaston, attended by Joseph throughout her last illness. Medical advice opined that she had died of lung disease. She was interred in the burial-ground of the Bull Street Friends' meeting-house, Birmingham, on 11 June 1845. Her death was the occasion of J. G. Whittier's poem, &#145;To my Friend on the Death of his Sister&#146;. Quakerism, strongly influenced by evangelical ideals, was the mainspring of her life, enabling her to fulfil roles as a supportive sister and anti-slavery campaigner in her own right.<br>
