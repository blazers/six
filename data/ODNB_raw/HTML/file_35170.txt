<span class="headword">Murray, Sir  Oswyn Alexander Ruthven</span>  (1873&#150;1936), <span class="occ">Admiralty official</span>, was born at Mill Hill, near London, on 17 August 1873, the fourth son and the fourth of the eleven children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35163/', "Sir James Augustus Henry Murray (1837&#150;1915)")</script>, then a schoolmaster and later first editor of the <span class="italic">Oxford English Dictionary</span>, and his second wife, Ada Agnes (1845&#150;1936), daughter of George Ruthven, of Kendal. The family moved to Oxford in 1885, where Oswyn was educated at the Oxford high school as a day boy and from 1891 at Exeter College, Oxford, where he held a classical scholarship and was placed in the first class in classical moderations (1893), <i>literae humaniores</i> (1895), and jurisprudence (1896). In 1897 after the higher civil service competitive examination he was appointed to the Admiralty secretariat. Later in the year he won the Vinerian (law) scholarship but declined the offer of a resident fellowship in law at St John's College. As resident clerk at the Admiralty from 1898 until 1901 he became close to G. J. Goschen, then first lord, who made him his assistant private secretary; from 1901 to 1904 he served as private secretary to H. O. Arnold-Forster and E. G. Pretyman, when they were parliamentary and financial secretaries. He became assistant principal clerk in 1904. On 1 August 1900 he married Mildred Octavia, who survived him, fourth daughter of the Revd Septimus March. They had a son and a daughter.<br>
<br>Murray's exceptional ability was recognized early and in October 1904 he was selected for the post of assistant director of victualling and clothing, and in 1905 became director. His obituary in <span class="italic">The Times</span> commented that from Murray's years in this department &#145;the lower deck will remember him with gratitude as the man who entirely reformed the feeding of the Navy&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 11 July 1936, 16). The standard ration was thoroughly overhauled, the savings system (of money taken in lieu of portions of the ration) abolished, a messing allowance introduced, the contract canteen arrangement placed on a sound footing, and a school of cookery established in the home ports&#151;&#145;more progress than had been seen since Trafalgar&#146;  (ibid.). Murray's wife later wrote that in his reform of conditions Murray regarded the sailors &#145;as his big family&#146;  (Murray, 64).<br>
<br>Murray was brought back to the secretariat in 1911 as the assistant (or deputy) secretary of the Admiralty, and was actively concerned with the preparations for war as its likelihood increased, and then with the difficulties of administration during the conflict. In 1917 Sir Eric Geddes was made first lord of the Admiralty, with a brief to reform its management. He appointed Murray as permanent secretary on 7 August 1917, in place of Sir Graham Greene who was transferred to the Ministry of Munitions. Murray ultimately became &#145;probably the ablest secretary of the Admiralty in modern times&#146;  (Marder, 4.216). Extremely talented in administration and in dealing with the intricate budgetary and other manoeuvring necessary with bureaucracy, Murray managed both to preserve much of the resources of the navy at a time of severe government cost-cutting and to make many needed reforms. Admiral Sir William Fisher referred to him as the &#145;great man who did more for the navy in his time than, perhaps, anyone else&#146;  (Murray, v). Negotiating the navy estimates occupied much of Murray's time during each year, but he was so successful in this that the navy was in a much more powerful position when war broke out again in 1939 than it might have been had the position not been &#145;held by a man of such high ability as Murray&#146;  (Roskill, 1.209).<br>
<br>A reserved man, but one with an almost &#145;boyish simplicity &hellip; [which] gave him a directness and certainty in dealing with complicated problems&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 11 July 1936, 16), Murray's main outside interest was research in Devon family history, in which he became a recognized authority. He was appointed CB in 1910, KCB in 1917, and GCB in 1931, and was elected an honorary fellow of Exeter College in 1919. He died at his home, Annery, Akehurst Street, Roehampton, London, on 10 July 1936, and was cremated at Golders Green, Middlesex, on 14 July.<br>
