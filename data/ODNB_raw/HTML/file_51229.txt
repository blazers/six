<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Mathias,  William James</span>  (1934&#150;1992), <span class="occ">composer</span>, was born on 1 November 1934 at Cilhawl, North Road, Whitland, Carmarthenshire, the only child of James Hughes Mathias (1893&#150;1969) and his wife, Marian, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Evans (1896&#150;1980). His father, who had a keen interest in music, was a history teacher at Whitland grammar school and his mother was a respected amateur organist and piano accompanist. Mathias showed an early interest in the piano and at the age of six he began formal lessons. Composing seemed to be a natural extension of his piano studies, and he wrote a large number of works, without any official tuition, while at school. A school song, written when he was twelve, is still in use today.<br>
<br>In 1952 Mathias went to University College of Wales, Aberystwyth, to read English, French, and philosophy, but soon transferred to music. He was tutored by Professor Ian Parrott and graduated with first-class honours in 1956. He then gained an open scholarship to the Royal Academy of Music in London to study composition with Lennox Berkeley and piano with Peter Katin. While there he met his future wife, (Margaret) Yvonne Collins, another scholarship student, also from south Wales, who was studying voice. They married in 1959 and had one daughter, Rhiannon (<i>b</i>. 1968). Among their peers at the academy were Cornelius Cardew and Harrison Birtwistle, yet out of this furnace of avant-garde ideas Mathias emerged with his own lyrical, compositional style. His music soon came to the attention of Alan Frank, the entrepreneurial music editor at Oxford University Press, who wooed the young composer into the ranks of the press's house composers&#151;who at that time included Ralph Vaughan Williams and William Walton.<br>
<br>In 1959 Mathias took up a lectureship at the University College of North Wales, Bangor. This, coupled with his marriage the same year, gave him the professional, emotional, and financial security to build on his increasing reputation as a composer. In 1968 he took the position of senior lecturer at the University of Edinburgh. However, Wales remained his natural home, and in 1970 he was appointed professor of music back in Bangor, and the family moved into Y Graigwen, a beautiful house on the island of Anglesey overlooking the Menai Strait. He took early retirement to devote more time to composition in 1988.<br>
<br>Mathias wrote with great fluency in a style that was largely consolidated by the time he left the academy. His stylistic hallmarks were a modal tonality, frequent harmonizations at the interval of a 4th or 7th, ostinati motifs, a penchant for syncopated rhythms, and the construction of forms through contrasting and often quite discrete musical episodes. His character was present in his music's energy and jauntiness and in a seam of Celtic romance. His prolific output&#151;nearly 250 catalogued works&#151;covered most genres, and the quality was variable. He made a significant contribution to the canon of twentieth-century organ music both with the organ concerto, op. 81 (1984), and with shorter works such as the dazzling <span class="italic">Carillon</span> (1990). He also wrote well for choir, moving easily between sacred and secular texts. He regarded <span class="italic">Lux aeterna</span>, op. 88 (1982), dedicated to the memory of his mother, as his &#145;choral best&#146;; it was a glorious work in the great tradition of other British works written for the Three Choirs festival. During the 1980s Mathias made frequent visits to the United States and Canada, where there was a constant demand for new anthems. This popularity was in part precipitated by the enormous interest in &#145;Let the people praise thee, o God&#146;, op. 87 (1981), commissioned for the wedding of the prince and princess of Wales and consequently heard at its premi&egrave;re by over 750 million people worldwide.<br>
<br>Mathias's chamber and orchestral music conveyed a sort of nationalism born not out of the politics of confrontation but out of a deep empathy with the history, spirit, and natural beauty of Wales. The concertos for flute and oboe were distinctly pastoral in places, and the harp concerto, op. 50 (1970), showed a marvellous understanding of the possibilities of the Celtic emblem. He wrote three symphonies, a single opera (<span class="italic">The Servants</span>, to a libretto by Iris Murdoch), a number of successful works for youth orchestras, ten concertos, three string quartets, a piano trio, and other works for assorted forces. His final three large-scale works, the third symphony (1991), the violin concerto, and <span class="italic">In Arcadia</span> (1992), were all affirmatory and pointed to a man who was determined to live life to the full. In the last few months of his life Mathias revised a number of early works but continued to compose afresh, even commencing a fourth symphony.<br>
<br>Mathias received many honours, including being made a fellow of the Royal Academy of Music (1965) and a doctor of music of the University of Wales (1966); he was awarded the Bax Society prize (1968) and the Guild for the Promotion of Welsh Music's John Edwards memorial award (1981), and was appointed CBE (1985). He was diligent in his public roles as president of the Incorporated Society of Musicians (1979&#150;80), member of the music advisory committee of the British Council (1974&#150;83), member of the Welsh Arts Council (1974&#150;81), and vice-president of the Royal College of Organists (1985&#150;6). He also founded the St Asaph festival in 1972 and remained its artistic director until his death. He died, from cancer, at his home in Anglesey on 29 July 1992, survived by his wife and daughter.<br>
