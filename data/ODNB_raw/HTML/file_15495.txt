<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Key,  Charles Aston</span>  (1793&#150;1849), <span class="occ">surgeon</span>, born in Southwark, London, on 6 October 1793, was the eldest son of Thomas Key (<i>d</i>. 1837), medical practitioner, and Margaret Barry. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15497/', "Thomas Hewitt Key")</script> was a half-brother by a second marriage. Aston Key was educated at Buntingford grammar school, Hertfordshire, and was apprenticed to his father in 1810. He attended the lectures at the United Borough Hospitals in 1812, and became a pupil at Guy's Hospital in 1814. In 1815 his apprenticeship to his father was cancelled, and he became a pupil of Astley Cooper at a large premium. That summer he travelled to Brussels with several other pupils and helped treat the injured after the battle of Waterloo. In 1817&#150;18 he lived with Cooper, and in 1818 married Cooper's niece, Anne Cooper. Key became demonstrator of anatomy at St Thomas's Hospital, but resigned the post in February 1823, though he gave some of Sir Astley Cooper's surgical lectures for two sessions afterwards. In 1827 he edited the second edition of Cooper's work on hernia, which was little different from the first.<br>
<br>Key had qualified at the Royal College of Surgeons in 1821, and in the autumn of the same year was appointed the first assistant surgeon to Guy's, succeeding to a full surgeoncy in January 1824. In this year he introduced the operation for lithotomy with the straight staff, using only a single knife all through. He also published <span class="italic">A Short Treatise on the Section of the Prostate Gland in Lithotomy</span>. The success of his operations established his reputation as a surgeon. In 1825, on the separation of Guy's from St Thomas's, Key was appointed lecturer on surgery at Guy's, and his classes were for many years very popular. He resigned the lectureship in 1844. In 1845 he was one of the first elected fellows of the Royal College of Surgeons, and in the same year became a member of its council. In 1847 he was appointed surgeon to Prince Albert. Key died of cholera at his home in St Helen's Place, London, on 23 August 1849, leaving his wife and nine children. He was buried in the churchyard of St Dionis Backchurch. His son <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15494/', "Sir Astley Cooper Key")</script> is separately noticed.<br>
<br>Key was a great surgical operator and lecturer, his lectures being derived largely from the results of his own experience. He was not a well-read man nor a scientific pathologist, but he contributed fifteen papers to <span class="italic">Guy's Hospital Reports</span> describing his varied surgical practice. In 1833 he published <span class="italic">A memoir on the advantages and practicability of dividing the stricture in strangulated hernia on the outside of the sac</span>. He was one of the first surgeons in London to use ether as an anaesthetic and to ligature the subclavian artery successfully for the cure of an axillary aneurysm. His dexterity with the knife was remarkable: he was never known to make a mistake through inattention to details. In person he was of commanding presence, thin, and rather tall, with a slightly aquiline nose. In temperament he was brusque, short-tempered, and overbearing.<br>
