<span class="headword">Wheler,  Granville</span>  (1701&#150;1770), <span class="occ">experimental philosopher</span>, was born in August 1701 in London, the third son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29193/', "Sir George Wheler (1651&#150;1724)")</script> and his wife, Grace (<i>d</i>. 1703), daughter of Sir Thomas Higgons of Grewel, Hampshire. At the time of his son's birth, Sir George was a canon of Durham Cathedral. Wheler attended school at Durham before being admitted pensioner at Christ's College, Cambridge, in 1717; he graduated BA in 1721, held a fellowship at Christ's in 1722&#150;4, and proceeded MA in 1734. He was ordained deacon and priest at St Margaret's, Westminster, London, and was rector of Leake, Nottinghamshire, from 1737 until his death. His first wife was Lady Catherine Maria (<i>d</i>. 1740), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/12583/', "Theophilus Hastings, seventh earl of Huntingdon")</script>; they had seven children. His second marriage, to Mary, daughter of John Dove of London, was childless.<br>
<br>Wheler acquired the estate of Otterden, near Charing, Kent, about 1717, by purchase from the widow of his deceased brother, and in the spacious galleries of Otterden Place he and his friends, among them John Godfrey, Stephen Gray, and Thomas Ruddock, carried out various electrical experiments on the lines of those published by Benjamin Franklin and others. They confirmed Franklin's identification of lightning as an electrical discharge, and sought to discover how to communicate electricity, leading the &#145;electric virtue&#146; through silk threads running through the building. They tested various substances, identifying those that could receive a charge and those that did not. To Wheler fell the fame of being the first in England to electrify a live animal. He succeeded in leading electricity through the bodies of live chickens, then through the footboy, &#145;a good stout lad&#146;, whom he suspended by a silk rope, touching his hand or foot with a long glass rod, which had been previously rubbed so as to bear a charge, and making another person point to the boy's face or hands, whereupon sparks crackled between the two, and they felt a burning sensation. Wheler was elected to the Royal Society on 27 June 1728, to which he wrote in later years conveying news of his experiments. Wheler died on 12 May 1770, and was buried in Otterden church.<br>
