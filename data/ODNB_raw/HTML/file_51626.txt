<span class="headword">Huxley, Sir  Leonard George Holden</span>  (1902&#150;1988), <span class="occ">physicist</span>, was born on 29 May 1902 at 14 Beauval Road, Dulwich, London, the son of George Hambrough (or Hamborough) Huxley (1868&#150;1944), schoolmaster, and his wife, Lilian Sarah Smith. He was descended from an uncle of the Victorian scientist T. H. Huxley, and was a third cousin once removed of Aldous and Julian Huxley. His family moved to Australia when he was three years old, and he entered the Hutchins School in Hobart, Tasmania, in 1915. In 1920 he won a science and general scholarship to the University of Tasmania. As an undergraduate he gained distinction in the sciences, particularly in physics and mathematics. He was awarded the Philip Fysh prize for physics and was elected a Rhodes scholar for 1923. He entered New College, Oxford, in 1923 reading physics in the honours school of natural sciences.<br>
<br>Huxley's anxiety to do research before the expiry of his Rhodes scholarship led him to take his BA degree in two years. He gained second-class honours and began research in the electrical laboratory, Oxford, under J. S. Townsend. The award of the J. T. Bowden scholarship by New College enabled him to continue his research in Oxford after the expiry of the Rhodes scholarship and in 1928 he was awarded a DPhil for his thesis, &#145;Corona discharge in helium and neon&#146;. He was appointed a lecturer, demonstrator, and tutor in the electrical laboratory in 1926 where he remained until 1929, taking his MA in that year. He married, on 5 October 1929, Ella Mary Child (1904/5&#150;1981), daughter of Frederick George Copeland, a clergyman. They had one son and one daughter.<br>
<br>From 1929 to 1931 Huxley was on the staff of the Australian Radio Research Board. Before sailing for Australia he worked for some months with the British Radio Research Board at Datchet. In Australia he collaborated with the department of electrical engineering in Sydney University on the development of a cathode ray tube direction finder, and carried out investigations on atmospherics at the Commonwealth Solar Observatory, Mount Stromlo, Canberra.<br>
<br>Huxley's sojourn in Australia was brief and in October 1931 he was appointed lecturer in physics in the University College, Nottingham. His teaching duties took him to University College, Leicester, for one morning each week and in July 1932 he made a successful application for the Frederick W. Bennett lectureship in physics in that college. In Leicester he continued his researches on collision of electrons with gas molecules and in the related problems of the conduction of electricity in gases. At that stage he became interested in the propagation of electromagnetic radiation and this proved of great value when he was released for wartime duties in 1940.<br>
<br>The Air Ministry radar establishment, originally at Bawdsey Manor in Suffolk, had been evacuated to Dundee on the outbreak of war and to Dorset in the spring of 1940, where it remained until 1942, at first on a cliff site at Worth Matravers and at Swanage. It was at this stage with the name in transition to Telecommunications Research Establishment (TRE) that Huxley joined as a scientific officer. Many radar devices, already in operational use by the Royal Air Force, had evolved from TRE and it was clear that it was of little use devising complex equipment unless RAF personnel were taught how it worked and how to use it. That problem was handed to Huxley and led to the genesis of the TRE radar school. In the beginning Huxley was the sole lecturer, but his efforts were so greatly valued by the RAF that the school soon grew in strength.<br>
<br>After the move of TRE to Great Malvern in May 1942 the development of the vital new radar systems working in the centimetre waveband&#151;such as the blind bombing aid known as H<sub>2</sub>S and the anti-submarine radar&#151;increased the importance of the radar school, and under Huxley's guidance many thousands of civilians and service personnel had passed through the school by the end of the war.<br>
<br>Huxley conversed and lectured in a quiet and undemonstrative voice but with such authority that he soon attracted high-ranking RAF officers anxious to understand the basis of the new radar systems under their command. In paying tribute to the TRE school after the war A. P. Rowe, the chief superintendent, recalled that the air officer commanding, RAF Training Command, had remarked that even if the rest of TRE did not exist, the teaching school would be well worth visiting.<br>
<br>Huxley had been appointed principal scientific officer and after the end of the war he wrote an important book, <span class="italic">Wave Guides</span> (1947), based on the lectures he had given in the TRE school. Much of the material in this book related to technical developments in the microwave region, which until then had been available only in secret documents. Huxley had been given leave of absence from University College, Leicester, which had been placed on the list to receive exchequer grants in 1946. He did not apply for the newly established chair of physics but moved to the University of Birmingham as reader in electromagnetism in the department of electrical engineering. His stay there was brief and in 1949 he was elected to the Elder chair of physics in the University of Adelaide.<br>
<br>Huxley soon became an important figure in Australian education and research. He continued as the Elder professor of physics until 1960 when he was appointed vice-chancellor of the Australian National University, Canberra. As the secretary of the physical science committee of the Australian Academy he became deeply involved with the British proposal to build a large optical telescope, as a joint project, in Australia. He was a member of the Australian large telescope committee which had discussions with the British delegation in 1964 and remained one of the principal Australian advisers in the complex negotiations that ultimately led to the joint decision of the British and Australian governments in 1967 to proceed with the construction of the Anglo-Australian 150 inch telescope at Siding Spring in New South Wales, for many years an outstanding instrument for astronomical research.<br>
<br>Huxley remained vice-chancellor of the Australian National University until December 1967. During this period he served on many educational and scientific committees. He was created KBE (1964) and was awarded the honorary degree of DSc by Tasmania in 1962 and by the Australian National University in 1980.<br>
<br>In his youth Huxley was a prominent athlete. He was captain of athletics at the Hutchins School and during his years in Oxford he was awarded the New College colours for athletics. He died during a visit to London on 4 September 1988 in the Royal Free Hospital, Camden.<br>
