<span class="headword">Varley,  Frederick Henry</span>  (1842&#150;1916), <span class="occ">electrical engineer</span>, was born at 1 Charles Street, Somers Town, London, on 18 December 1842, the youngest of the seven sons of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28113/', "Cornelius Varley (1781&#150;1873)")</script>, scientific instrument maker and watercolour artist, and his wife, Elizabeth Livermore Straker. He was educated privately in Islington and his subsequent engineering career was probably influenced by his father's interest in science. Another strong influence was that of his brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28114/', "Cromwell Fleetwood Varley (1828&#150;1883)")</script>. In 1859 Frederick joined the family firm, which made telegraph components and testing apparatus, many of which were for his brother. In 1865 he was involved in tests on the Atlantic telegraph cable, and in 1868 he acted as assistant engineer on the Lowestoft&#150;Norderney section of the Reuter cable. He and his brother Octavius went into business as consulting engineers and manufacturers of cable testing equipments and instruments. Octavius died in 1871 but Varley used the title O. and F. H. Varley until the 1880s. During his career Varley took out several patents for telegraph apparatus including double current galvanometers and keys, ink-writing Morse instruments, and a system of block signalling for railways.<br>
<br>Varley's subsequent areas of interest mirrored the growth of the electrical industry. In the late 1870s he produced flexible carbons for arc lamps, which he patented in 1882, and a lamp in which light was produced by passing electricity through a constantly falling stream of powdered carbon. He later developed an incandescent lamp filament by soaking fibres in compounds of boron, but the Varley diaphanous filament was not a success, partly due to the domination of the lamp industry by Swan and Edison's patents. Varley also produced and patented batteries and electric motors, and in 1881 helped Cromwell Fleetwood Varley with improvements to the cymaphen, his device for transmitting musical tones. Before the outbreak of the First World War Varley was working on A. T. Johnson's tuned reed wireless system. As well as electrical equipment he developed porous stone wicks for oil and petroleum lamps, and in 1890 he patented photographic apparatus.<br>
<br>Like his brother Cromwell Fleetwood Varley, Frederick Varley was interested in spiritualism and the scientific recording of phenomena produced by mediums. In 1879 Charles Blackburn, a spiritualist investigator, commissioned him to build apparatus for recording the weight of mediums during seances. This was used on 7 October 1879 to monitor a medium called Mr Haxby. Another interest was shooting, and he designed apparatus for indicating target scores automatically. He also published a pocket book of marksmen's target diagrams in 1867.<br>
<br>Throughout his life Varley lived in the Stoke Newington area of London, which was also the site of his father's works. He died at 82 Newington Green Road, on 12 March 1916.<br>
