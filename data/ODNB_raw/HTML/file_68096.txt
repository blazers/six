<span class="headword">Stafford <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Devereux; <em>other married name </em>Shirley]</span>, Lady  Dorothy</span>  (1600&#150;1636), <span class="occ">literary patron and poet</span>, was born about 20 December 1600 at Walsingham House, Seething Lane, London, the youngest of the five children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7565/', "Robert Devereux, second earl of Essex (1565&#150;1601)")</script>, and his wife, Frances (1567&#150;1632), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28624/', "Sir Francis Walsingham")</script> and formerly the wife of Sir Philip Sidney.<br>
<br>On 18 May 1615 Lady Dorothy married Sir Henry Shirley, second baronet (<i>c</i>.1592&#150;1633), of Staunton Harold, Leicestershire, and of Astwell, Northamptonshire, at St Laurence Pountney, London. The Shirleys were both Roman Catholics, though they were never convicted of recusancy. They had three children: Charles, third baronet (1623&#150;1646); Robert, fourth baronet (<i>d</i>. 1656), who died in the Tower, where he had been imprisoned seven times for his support of the king; and Lettice (or Leta), who married William De Burgh, later seventh earl of Clanricarde. After twelve years of marriage Sir Henry was publicly disgraced before the privy council and imprisoned for slighting the earl of Huntingdon, one of the earl of Essex's political allies (<span class="italic">APC</span>, <i>1627&#150;8</i>, 201; <span class="italic">Hastings MSS</span>, 4.212). Soon after his release in 1627 he was accused of adultery, whereupon Lady Dorothy, &#145;both for safeguard of her honour, blemished by him scandalously, and for her alimony or maintenance (being glad to get from him) &hellip; was forced to endure a suit in the High Commission Court&#146;  (<span class="italic">State trials</span>, 2.1456). She later took Shirley to court for non-payment of maintenance  (BL, Add. MS 46189, fol. 30).<br>
<br>After Henry Shirley's death on 8 February 1633 the third earl of Essex became the guardian of Shirley's heir  (<span class="italic">Clarendon State Papers</span>, 1.81). At that time Lady Dorothy was described by Henry Cary, Viscount Falkland, as &#145;one of the fayrest, wittiest and newest widdowes of our time&#146;. In February 1635 she married, as his second wife, William Stafford (<i>c</i>.1604&#150;1637) of Blatherwyck, Northamptonshire, in a Roman Catholic ceremony, though Stafford &#145;was never known to be popishly affected&#146;  (<span class="italic">Hastings MSS</span>, 2.76&#150;7). On 1 March 1635 the newsletter writer George Gerrard wrote to the earl of Strafford, &#145;And here is also one Mr. Stafford, who buried but two Months since his Wife, married in Queen's Chapel at Somerset-House to the Lady Dorothy Shirley, sister to my Lord of Essex, and I hear they both repent it already&#146;  (Radcliffe, 373). The marriage was celebrated by Thomas Randolph, a poet in Stafford's patronage, in a pastoral eclogue entitled &#145;The Constant Lovers&#146;  (Hunt. L., HM 904, fols. 189<i>r</i>&#150;195<i>v</i>).<br>
<br>Lady Dorothy was the dedicatee of James Shirley's comedy <span class="italic">Changes, or, Love in a Maze</span> (1632) and of Thomas Fitzherbert's translation of Orazio Torsellino's life of St Francis Xavier of the same year, in which she was praised for her &#145;Resolution and Constancy&#146; in the Catholic faith &#145;in the middst of strongest Reasons, Tryalls, &amp; Provocations to the contrary&#146;  (T. Fitzherbert, <span class="italic">The Admirable Life</span>, sig. A1<i>v</i>&#150;A2<i>r</i>). She evidently followed the taste of the court, for a contemporary recorded that she longed to read Walter Montagu's play <span class="italic">The Shepherds' Paradise</span>, performed by Queen Henrietta Maria and the ladies of her court in 1633  (Montagu, xiv). John Eliot and Owen Felltham addressed poems to her but she also wrote her own verse and was a participant in the Aston family's group of Catholic poets at Tixall, Staffordshire. Her contact with this group most likely came about through the proximity of the Aston estates to Chartley Castle, which belonged to her brother, the third earl of Essex, and which descended to her grandson Robert. She wrote a poem in response to Katherine Thimelby's &#145;upon the LD saying KT could be sad in her company&#146;, in which she expresses her pleasure in her friend's society  (Hunt. L., HM 904, fols. 158<i>r</i>&#150;158<i>v</i>), and another addressed to an inconstant lover  (ibid., fols. 136<i>r</i>&#150;136<i>v</i>, also in Harvard MS Eng. 626, fols. 17<i>v</i>&#150;18<i>r</i>); this was in turn answered by a subsequent poem.<br>
<br>Lady Dorothy died on 30 March 1636 at Blatherwyck, where she was buried on 5 April. Her death was lamented in a pastoral eclogue written by Sir William Pershall, in which Amyntas (Stafford) mourns Lawra (Lady Dorothy)  (Hunt. L., HM 904, fols. 196<i>r</i>&#150;200<i>v</i>). William Stafford died on 3 July 1637.<br>
