<span class="headword">Church, Sir  Arthur Herbert</span>  (1834&#150;1915), <span class="occ">chemist</span>, was born on 2 June 1834 in London, the fourth son of John Thomas Church, solicitor, and his wife, Maria Susannah Booty. He was educated at a preparatory school in Brighton, then at King's College School, London. He went back to Brighton to a private school that encouraged an interest in both art and science, which he retained all his life. In 1851 he went to the Royal College of Chemistry (at that time in Oxford Street), with A. W. Hofmann as professor and such demonstrators as Frederick Abel and William Crookes. W. H. Perkin was a fellow student, and Church also met Faraday and Tyndall. He went to Oxford in 1855, first as assistant to Benjamin Brodie, and then in 1856 as an undergraduate at Lincoln College. He graduated BA in 1860 and was made MA in 1863. He became a DSc, and was a fellow of King's College, London.<br>
<br>In 1863 Church was appointed professor of chemistry at the Royal Agricultural College at Cirencester. Although his first commitment was to agriculture, his interests spread very widely&#151;to mineralogy, mainly that of gems and precious stones, and to colouring matters, both organic and inorganic. His artistic talent led him to make a special study of paints and pigments, and his study of mineralogy took him to archaeology. While at Cirencester he became active in the Corinium Museum to which he prepared a guide.<br>
<br>On 3 May 1879 Church married Jemima Pope, younger daughter of J. Buckingham Pope, in the parish church, Leeds. He then removed to London where he was appointed professor of chemistry at the Royal Academy of Arts. His interests and accomplishments were exceptionally wide. He lectured on the connections of art and science, as well as on agricultural chemistry. He discovered a hitherto unknown bird pigment, turacin. His most important publication was his <span class="italic">Chemistry of Paints and Painting</span> of 1890, which ran into several later editions. He also wrote on English porcelain, on precious stones, and on other subjects of antiquarian interest. He became active in many learned bodies, such as the Society of Antiquaries. Elected to the Royal Society in 1888, he later supported it by a generous benefaction for the preparation of a catalogue of manuscripts of the period 1741&#150;1806. When this was published in 1907 he prepared a guide. He served on the society's council from 1911 to 1912. He was a juror at some of the international exhibitions which were held at South Kensington in the later years of the century.<br>
<br>Church collected several kinds of antiques, showing particular interest in Japanese metal work, oriental and English pottery, and Italian and oriental embroidery. He enjoyed painting, exhibited early in his career at the Royal Academy, and presented Kew Gardens with some fine herbarium illustrations. He was exceptional in his ability to relate chemical science to the properties of works of art, a faculty which led to his being consulted about the restoration of the frescoes at the Palace of Westminster, which had been inadequately painted after its reconstruction by Barry following the fire of 1834. He was also asked to advise on arresting the decay of the stonework at Westminster Abbey.<br>
<br>Church's many publications included several training manuals for practical chemists. In 1909 he was created KCVO. Photographs taken in later life show him relaxed and bearded but of commanding appearance. His circle of personal acquaintance in the fields of art and science was wide. He died at home in a house he had built, Shelsey, at Kew Gardens, on 31 May 1915. His wife survived him. They had no children.<br>
<br>In 1912 Church had published a collection of obituaries of his brother, the classical scholar Alfred John Church (1829&#150;1912). After his death his wife piously followed his example and had privately printed a collection of appreciations of her husband.<br>
