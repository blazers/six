<span class="headword">Preston,  John</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1434), <span class="occ">justice</span>, was the younger son of John (perhaps Sir John) Preston of Preston Patrick and Preston Richard, Westmorland. His father lived until some time between 1392 and 1395, and is often hard to distinguish from his namesake and son. Although the younger John became his father's heir when his elder brother, Richard, died in 1390, giving him northern prospects and interests which he did not neglect, this did not prevent his pursuing a career as a lawyer in the south of England; his first commission, to investigate the seizure of nets in the Thames, came in February 1391. He soon acquired powerful patrons and employers. In 1393 he became steward of the Sussex estates of John of Gaunt, duke of Lancaster, and by 1397, and probably earlier, he was steward of the archbishop of Canterbury's Kentish manors of Otford and South Malling. Preston also acted for the crown, on 19 July 1394 receiving &pound;2 6<i>s</i>. 8<i>d</i>. for securing the conviction of a multiple killer, and such additional rewards as the wardship and marriage of the heir of Henry Michelgrove, a landowner in Kent and Sussex. Preston himself acquired estates in the latter county, at Ringmer, South Malling, and Framfield. He retained links with Westmorland and Yorkshire, in November 1398 securing a powerful commission to act against adversaries there who were allegedly conspiring against his life. But his interests in the south remained paramount. He was appointed to the Sussex bench in 1397, and his Lancastrian ties were doubtless responsible for his being elected to represent Sussex in the parliament of 1399 which saw Henry Bolingbroke become king as Henry IV.<br>
<br>Preston's connections with Sussex were inevitably weakened in 1404, when he lost his position as steward of the duchy of Lancaster's estates in that county, presumably for reasons connected with his being arrested and taken to London for questioning shortly after his dismissal. Instead he became increasingly involved in the government of London, where he had been appointed the city's recorder by 9 July 1406. In 1407 or 1408 he was admitted to the livery of the Mercers' Company, and he also acquired London property, in the parish of St Botolph, Aldersgate. Preston remained recorder until August or September 1415, and was regularly appointed to Newgate gaol deliveries until January 1425. On 11 January 1414, immediately after Sir John Oldcastle's rising, he was one of the commissioners appointed to act against Lollardy in the city. By this time he was a serjeant-at-law, having been ordered to take up that position on 3 February 1412. Three years later, on 16 June 1415, he was appointed a justice of the common pleas (reappointed on 1 October 1422); he was subsequently summoned among the justices to every parliament for which records survive until July 1427.<br>
<br>Following his appointment to the common bench, Preston was appointed to a large number of commissions in many counties, in a large number of which he also became a JP. As a justice of assize and gaol delivery he acted in the west midlands as well as in the northern counties. But although in May 1425 he acquired the manor of Farnborough and other estates in Kent, during the 1420s his interests became perceptibly more concentrated in the north, just as his activities as a justice of assize and gaol delivery, and as a commissioner, were increasingly confined to the northern counties. In 1424, for instance, he was appointed to investigate claims to Yorkshire lands forfeited in 1415 by Henry, Lord Scrope of Masham. In 1421 he was granted the custody of the Westmorland and Yorkshire estates of Sir John Lumley, during the minority of the heir, a trust he was later charged with abusing. On 28 January 1428 Preston was licensed to retire, in response to his own petition, which complained of age and infirmity. However, he lived until 29 September 1434; he probably died in Westmorland. It was almost certainly in the intervening period that he planned a chantry in the chapel of St George in Preston Richard, to be served by two priests and maintained from Preston's London property. However, nothing came of this plan. With an unknown wife Preston had three sons, Richard, who was probably the eldest, since he inherited his father's lands in Sussex and Westmorland, Robert, and John.<br>
