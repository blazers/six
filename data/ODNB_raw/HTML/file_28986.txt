<span class="headword">Weld,  Thomas</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1595, <em>d.</em> 1661), <span class="occ">Independent minister and religious controversialist</span>, was baptized on 13 July 1595 in Sudbury, Suffolk, the son of Edmund Weld. He graduated BA from Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1613 and MA in 1618. He was soon active in Essex puritan networks, may have served as a lecturer at Haverhill in the early 1620s, and became vicar of Terling in 1625. By then he had married his first wife, Margaret; they had four children. He worked hard and contentiously to suppress moral disorder in Terling, boarded divinity students, including the future New England divine Thomas Shepard, in his house, and occasionally hosted the regular meetings of the informal Essex ministerial conference led by Thomas Hooker; Weld signed a petition dated 10 November 1629 to William Laud, then bishop of London, in support of Hooker.<br>
<br>Weld's activism caught the attention of the church authorities, who were unhappy with the extent of puritan agitation in Essex. They already had their eye on him for his nonconformity in 1628, and in 1629 his churchwardens had to explain to diocesan officials why Hugh Peters, a silenced minister, had been allowed to preach in their church. Weld was called before the archdeacon's court in May 1630 to explain why he lectured on weekdays. He cleared himself but investigation continued. A paper drawn up by Laud, dated 25 November 1630, lists Weld as one of Essex's nonconformable ministers and he was asked to subscribe. Fined &pound;20 by the ecclesiastical commission in 1631 for an unspecified offence, Weld was deprived by Laud on 2 September for his nonconformity, a process completed by the high commission in January 1632. After his excommunication, at the instigation of a number of Essex ministers, he personally confronted Laud following a church service. Weld left behind him in Terling a core of nonconformist lay puritan militancy which his puritan successor, John Stalham, had to manage discreetly to avoid more conflict with the authorities.<br>
<br>Later in 1632 Weld went briefly to the Netherlands but he was already in touch with the leaders of the Massachusetts Bay Colony and he arrived at Boston, Massachusetts, on 5 June. In July he became pastor of the newly founded church at Roxbury, serving along with its teacher, John Eliot, the future &#145;Apostle to the Indians&#146;. A glowing letter from Weld to Terling that summer, describing Massachusetts as a model puritan polity, induced some of his former parishioners to join him in Roxbury, where he took the freeman's oath on 6 November 1632. In 1636 he married his second wife, Judith.<br>
<br>Roxbury was heavily affected by the antinomian controversy, a religious dispute over how one could know one was saved, that shook the colony in the mid-1630s. Perhaps because Roxbury bordered Boston, source of the dissident opinions, more of its laity actively sided with the dissidents than in any town outside Boston. Weld worked vigorously to re-establish orthodoxy. He was a member of the synod that met at the end of the summer of 1637 and condemned a variety of the teachings of Boston's teacher, John Cotton, the minister, John Wheelwright, and the leading Boston lay person, Anne Hutchinson. In January 1638 Roxbury excommunicated three members, the only church besides Boston to resort to this extreme measure. Weld's brother boarded Anne Hutchinson in Roxbury in her period of house arrest between her trial in November 1637 and the execution of her sentence of banishment the following March. Weld's other major contribution to New England religious life was to serve on a committee with John Eliot and Richard Mather that devised a new metrical version of the psalms, <span class="italic">The Whole Book of Psalmes, Faithfully Translated into English Metre</span>. Printed in Cambridge, Massachusetts, in 1640, it was the first book published in the English colonies. Its versification has won little praise.<br>
<br>On 2 June 1641 the Massachusetts general court appointed Weld, along with the minister Hugh Peters and Boston merchant William Hibbins, to serve as agents in England. The agents were to seek for financial relief for the hard-pressed colony, to raise funds for Harvard College and evangelizing the Native Americans, and to support further church reform in England. Weld helped to secure customs relief for New England trade and had some success in fund-raising, but his efforts became mired at the New England end in mismanagement and corruption.<br>
<br>Weld threw himself into the religious controversies of England, with mixed results. Once again he confronted William Laud, by now imprisoned, for his harrowing of Essex puritans, and may have been involved in an abortive scheme to exile Laud and Matthew Wren to Massachusetts. As Independents and presbyterians began to dispute over church government, Weld wrote tracts defending New England Congregationalism, and, with Peters, edited and published the works of his New England brethren. As disputes over the nature of salvation similar to the antinomian controversy surfaced in England, a collection of related documents compiled by John Winthrop was published in London as <span class="italic">A Catalogue of Erroneous Opinions Condemned in New England</span> (1644). The compilation had little narrative thread, and Weld, at the urging of others, he claimed, remedied that deficiency with a preface and conclusion added to a second edition, <span class="italic">A short story of the rise, reign, and ruin of the antinomians, familists, &amp; libertines, that infected the churches of New-England</span> (1644). <span class="italic">Short Story</span> was intended to show that Congregationalism was capable of defending religious orthodoxy; presbyterians seized upon the example to show that Congregationalism fostered religious anarchy, and that the toleration that Independents were claiming for themselves in England was belied by the intolerance of their Massachusetts brethren. Some in New England suspected that presbyterians had manoeuvred Weld into publishing it. Presbyterians also stirred up rumours that Weld and Peters had embezzled funds destined for Massachusetts. The Massachusetts authorities recalled the two men in October 1645, but both elected to remain in England. Weld served briefly in 1646 as rector at Wanlip, Leicestershire, and on 1 February 1649 was installed at St Mary's, Gateshead.<br>
<br>In Newcastle, Weld became embroiled in more religious controversy. He worked with other Newcastle ministers, Independent and presbyterian, to attack the sects. He helped expose the &#145;False Jew&#146;, Thomas Ramsey, whom the Hexham Baptists had assumed they had converted&#151;an exposure Weld was able to turn into an effective attack on the Baptists. He joined forces with other local ministers for a number of attacks on Quakers, but those opponents, including James Nayler, were not easily cowed and a nasty pamphlet war ensued. Weld also had to deal with difficulties in his own congregation. He employed Independent standards of eligibility for the Lord's supper which were notably stricter than presbyterian and always a bone of contention between the two groups. By 1657 dissatisfied parishioners claimed that Weld had excluded over a thousand people from the sacrament, and only administered it to ten marginal members of the congregation (Weld claimed the figure was twenty). His renegation on a compromise to admit a presbyterian lecturer resulted in his parishioners bringing an unsuccessful complaint against him to the northern commissioners on 3 March 1658.<br>
<br>There is no evidence that Weld attempted to retain his post at the Restoration, and Charles II appointed John Landler to the position on 16 March 1660. Weld signed the declaration of London Independent ministers denouncing Venner's Fifth Monarchy insurrection of January 1661, and died in the city on 23 March that year. His second wife had died (she was buried at Gateshead in 1656) and he had married again; his third wife, Margaret, died after him, in 1671.<br>
