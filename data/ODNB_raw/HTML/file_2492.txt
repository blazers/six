<span class="headword">Black,  Alexander</span>  (1789&#150;1864), <span class="occ">Free Church of Scotland minister and theologian</span>, was born in Aberdeen on 18 January 1789, where his father was a gardener. Educated at the grammar school and at Marischal College, Aberdeen, Black's initial interest in medicine gave way to the study of divinity. Licensed by the presbytery of Aberdeen in February 1814, Black was at first assistant to Dr James Ross, East Church, Aberdeen. He was a candidate for the divinity chair in King's College, Aberdeen, in 1817. When Duncan Mearns was preferred, Black succeeded him as minister of Tarves, Aberdeenshire, where he was ordained on 1 April 1818. He married, on 9 November 1826, Rachel (<i>d</i>. 1839/40), daughter of Alexander Booth, a merchant of Aberdeen; the couple had two sons and a daughter.<br>
<br>Black received appointment as professor of divinity in Marischal College in 1831, having received the degree of DD there in 1824. A formidable linguist, able to converse in nineteen languages and correspond in twelve, he was a natural choice as a member of a mission of inquiry to the Jews in 1839. His colleagues were Alexander Keith and two young ministers, R. M. McCheyne and A. A. Bonar. The rigours of travel in the Holy Land, exemplified by Black's fall from a camel, persuaded the senior members of the party to opt out of the later stages of the journey. Their return home, via the Danube, came to a halt at Pest in Hungary, where illness prostrated them. These mishaps were later seen as providential and led in time to the establishment of a mission to the Jews in Pest. However, misfortune had not finished with Black, who returned to Scotland to find his wife on her deathbed.<br>
<br>At the Disruption of 1843 Black adhered to the Free Church and was appointed professor of biblical exegesis in New College, Edinburgh, where he remained until his retirement in 1857. For whatever reason, his tenure at New College was deemed a disappointment: despite his prominent position Black was not subsequently included in the pantheon of Free Church ministers, <span class="italic">Disruption Worthies</span> (1881). It may have been that, as an obituary stated, &#145;The very fulness of his resources was the chief cause of his comparative unacceptability as a preacher and a professor&#146;  (<span class="italic">Aberdeen Journal</span>). Certainly, his considerable knowledge was not transmitted in any publication of note. In his final years Black occupied himself with the study of Chinese. He died at his home, 16 Claremont Crescent, Edinburgh, on 27 January 1864, after failing to recover from injuries received in a fall; he was buried in Warriston cemetery, Edinburgh, on 30 January.<br>
