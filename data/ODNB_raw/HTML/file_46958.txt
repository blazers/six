<span class="headword">Browne,  William Alexander Francis</span>  (1805&#150;1885), <span class="occ">alienist</span>, was born on 24 June 1805 in Stirling, the son of William Browne (<i>c</i>.1785&#150;1806), a lieutenant in the Cameronians, who drowned in the wreck of a troopship on the Goodwin Sands, and his wife, Jessie (<i>d</i>. 1861). Brought up in the home of his paternal grandparents, The Enclosure, Stirling, by his mother and her two unmarried sisters, Browne was a member of the Scottish Episcopal church. He was educated at the local high school, studied medicine at the University of Edinburgh, and qualified as a licentiate of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh in 1826. Elected a fellow of the Royal Medical Society on 25 November 1825, he became its president on 8 December 1826 and its senior president for 1827&#150;8. Like many ambitious but ill-connected young professionals in the 1820s, Browne was strongly attracted to the phrenological doctrines of F. J. Gall (1757&#150;1828) and J. G. Spurzheim (1776&#150;1832), and he became a close friend and disciple of the leading Scottish phrenologists, the brothers George and Andrew Combe. Vice-president of the Edinburgh Phrenological Society between 1830 and 1832, Browne was for a time one of the more popular phrenological lecturers in the city.<br>
<br>In 1828 Browne left Edinburgh for the continent, entrusted with the care of a well-to-do lunatic being treated through travel and changes of scene. For two years, as they travelled through Belgium, France, and Italy, Browne made a practice of visiting local asylums, forming a close attachment in Paris to the French alienist J. E. D. Esquirol (1772&#150;1840), with whom he returned to study for several months in 1832. Subsequently he sought to establish himself as a general practitioner in his home town of Stirling. In 1834, however, with the support of the Combes, he secured the vacant superintendency of the Royal Lunatic Asylum at Montrose. That same year he married Magdalene Howden Balfour, daughter of Andrew Balfour, physician and publisher of the <span class="italic">Edinburgh Encyclopaedia</span>. They had eight children, three of whom died in infancy; two others&#151;<script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32122/', "James Crichton-Browne (1840&#150;1938)")</script> and John Hutton Balfour Browne (1845&#150;1921)&#151;achieved eminence in medicine and law respectively.<br>
<br>A talented administrator, Browne began his tenure at Montrose by introducing the new system of moral treatment pioneered by William Tuke at the York Retreat, and by Philippe Pinel and Esquirol in Paris. He enjoyed considerable success with this new system, which minimized the use of physical coercion and sought to employ carefully designed techniques and a controlled environment to induce patients to collaborate in their own recovery. A course of public lectures delivered at the asylum in the autumn of 1836 and published in May 1837, <span class="italic">What asylums were, are, and ought to be</span>, brought him national and international attention. Its harrowing, if over-simplified, descriptions of the worst horrors of the traditional madhouse were drawn directly from evidence presented to a series of early nineteenth-century parliamentary inquiries, and its powerful propaganda on behalf of the new therapeutic regime significantly advanced the cause of reform in the treatment of lunatics.<br>
<br>The book also secured for Browne the superintendency of the new and handsomely endowed Crichton Royal Asylum, then being constructed in Dumfries, and he arrived in time to play a major role in designing, equipping, and staffing the asylum. Browne obtained his MD from Heidelberg in January 1839 and then sought over the next eighteen years to turn the Crichton Royal into an actual example of his utopian vision of the perfect asylum. Within an institution carefully designed to preserve existing class distinctions, patients were encouraged to engage in work or other physical activity, to learn languages or musical instruments, to participate as audience or actors in plays, and to submit themselves to a minutely organized and rigidly structured routine. Browne also insisted on the importance of making use of drugs as an additional aid in the treatment of mental disorder, and he experimented aggressively with a variety of possible pharmacological remedies. Yet despite his extraordinary energies and talents, and the virtual absence of the material constraints that hampered other Victorian asylum superintendents, Browne's annual reports at the Crichton Royal revealed that his experience essentially paralleled theirs: declining cure rates; the accumulation of chronic patients; and on his part a growing pessimism about the prospects and even the desirability of curing mental illness.<br>
<br>Browne shared with his fellow Scots an abhorrence of the English poor law. He was proud of the fact that Scotland's asylums were charitable enterprises, and when in the mid-1850s the American reformer Dorothea Dix (1802&#150;1887) sought to extend the English model of centrally supervised, tax-funded pauper asylums north of the border, he fought publicly to block her plans. When the legislation was passed anyway, he manoeuvred behind the scenes to secure his appointment as one of the two Scottish lunacy commissioners, a position he assumed in 1857.<br>
<br>Browne spent much of the next fifteen years on the official circuit. The task seems to have suited him less well than the day-to-day challenges of running an asylum, but his official post added to his visibility within the profession. In 1865 his stature was recognized by his election as president of the Medico-Psychological Association of Great Britain and Ireland for 1865&#150;6. By this time he had published <span class="italic">Endemic Degeneration</span> (1862), <span class="italic">Epileptics</span> (1865), and <span class="italic">Sisterhoods in Asylums</span> (1866). In 1870, on a tour of inspection in East Lothian, Browne was thrown from his carriage, and suffered severe head injuries that left him blind. Forced into an unwanted retirement, he spent the last fifteen years of his life at the home he had established in 1857, Crindan, Dumfries, cared for by his two unmarried daughters, Madeline and Margaret. He died suddenly of a heart attack at Crindan on 2 March 1885.<br>
