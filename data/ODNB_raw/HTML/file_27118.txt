<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Temple, Sir  Richard</span>, third baronet  (1634&#150;1697), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born on 28 March 1634, the only son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27116/', "Sir Peter Temple, second baronet (bap. 1592, d. 1653)")</script>, of Stowe, Buckinghamshire, and his second wife, Christian (<i>b</i>. in or before 1596, <i>d</i>. 1655), daughter and coheir of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/46972/', "Sir John Leveson (1555&#150;1615)")</script>, of Trentham, Staffordshire. Temple entered Gray's Inn on 6 November 1648 and was admitted to Emmanuel College, Cambridge, a few weeks later on 23 December.<br>
<br>In 1653 Temple succeeded to a substantial, but heavily indebted estate, with a rent roll estimated at &pound;3029, but with over &pound;1500 absorbed by fixed charges. Despite being under age Temple was returned to parliament for Warwickshire in 1654, served as a justice of the peace, and soon acquired household office as carver to the protector. In April 1655 he contracted smallpox and at one point was &#145;in extremity of sickness and likely to die&#146;  (Gay, 289). In October 1656 he made a settlement with his father's creditors, paying &pound;7000 for a debt of &pound;19,468. He sat for Buckingham in Richard Cromwell's parliament, making his first recorded speech on 2 February 1659. Temple was indignant when the army expelled the Rump in October 1659 and he welcomed George Monck's intervention from Scotland. On 26 January 1660 he visited the army, then at Stony Stratford, and quarrelled with some of its republican elements. He was ordered into the custody of the Rump for suggesting the county petition for a free parliament, being released upon the return of the secluded members. He sat in the Convention of 1660 for Buckingham, where he was perceived by Lord Wharton as a &#145;friend&#146;, and possibly as a supporter of modified episcopacy. In August 1660 he applied for preferment to the secretary of state, William Morrice, only to receive a discouraging reply. Worse still, following the lapse of parliamentary privilege, he was committed to a debtors' prison at the suit of his half-sister, Lady Baltinglas.<br>
<br>Despite this drawback Temple retained his seat in the parliamentary elections of April 1661, earning the nickname Sir Timber Temple for his promise of wood for a new town hall in his constituency. Temple was created a knight of the Bath on 18 April 1661, mainly as an attempt to demonstrate royal favour to his relative <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16538/', "Sir Richard Leveson")</script>, and hence obtain the Trentham estate from the childless knight. Temple was very active in the Commons as both a speaker and committee man, and as early as 1661 was probably an opponent of the court. At first he joined the opposition to the earl of Clarendon headed by the earl of Bristol and was clearly in sympathy with Bristol's support for the declaration of indulgence, as a consistent proponent of moderation in church matters. However, Temple's attempt in 1663, through Bristol, to offer his services to Charles II as a parliamentary undertaker, floundered upon his oppositionist stance and an angry Charles II reported his actions to the Commons. Temple survived this setback, but at the cost of his local offices. In 1664 he opposed repeal of the coercive clause in the <span class="roman">Triennial Act</span> and, following Bristol's disgrace, he joined the opposition grouping headed by the duke of Buckingham. He supported such measures as the ban on the import of Irish cattle and the attack on Clarendon. In 1668 he promoted a triennial bill and seems to have supported an anti-Clarendon ministry which would adopt a moderate religious policy. On 9 May 1668 Temple received leave of the house to go to France for the recovery of his health. He spent much of his time in Montpellier, taking the waters, and did not return to England until October 1669.<br>
<br>In 1669 Buckingham engaged Temple to support the court, and on 28 November 1670 Andrew Marvell reported that Temple was one of a group of MPs who &#145;openly took leave of their former party, and fell to head the King's business&#146;  (<span class="italic">Poems and Letters</span>, 1.305). Contemporaries accounted for his new stance by reference to his financial difficulties and his desire to atone for his service to the protector. He still defended nonconformists, but his court stance led him to join the political faction headed by the earl of Arlington. This connection led to his appointment as a commissioner for plantations on 19 June 1671 and then as a commissioner of customs on 23 March 1672, a post worth &pound;2000 p.a. During the next three years Temple paid off most of the money he had borrowed between 1656 and 1667. His improved financial position may also account for his marriage, on 25 August 1675, to Mary (<i>b</i>. after 1640, <i>d</i>. 1727), daughter of Henry Knapp of Rawlins, Oxfordshire. Temple received a portion of &pound;4000 and possession of Woodcote. Their first child, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27119/', "Richard Temple, the future first Viscount Cobham")</script>, was born on 24 October 1675. They had three other sons and six daughters. With his mistress, Anne Charleton, daughter of the physician and natural philosopher William Charleton, Temple had another child, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/40524/', "Penelope Aubin")</script>, about 1679.<br>
<br>Temple spent the next few years as a spokesman for the court, but although he spoke often he was described in 1673 as one of &#145;the worst heard that can be in the House&#146;  (Airy, 1.132). In 1676 Wiseman noted to Lord Treasurer Thomas Osborne, first earl of Danby, that &#145;your Lordship every day speaks with him. I hope he will spoil no more votes&#146;  (Browning, 3.98), and in 1677&#150;8 his salary at the customs of &pound;1200 was augmented by a pension from the excise. In 1678 he defended Danby from the charges which led to his impeachment, and as a result of his adherence to the court, and the personal intervention of his erstwhile patron, Buckingham, he lost his seat at Buckingham in the election of February 1679. In the election of August 1679 he was returned with Danby's son, Lord Latimer. In this parliament he spoke in favour of the bill uniting protestants, but his stance on the <span class="roman">Exclusion Bill</span> was unclear, and possibly designed to weaken the bill. In September 1679 John Verney reported that Temple had been accused of being a Catholic; the accusation evidently persisted because in 1681 Temple took the matter before the courts, and one of his accusers, William Burton, was sentenced to the pillory. In 1683&#150;4 Temple was able to secure a new charter for Buckingham which named him as steward.<br>
<br>Temple retained his customs post until the accession of James II, when he objected to the new monarch collecting the customs duties without parliamentary sanction and was dismissed. As a consequence his finances were hit and he borrowed more, but in April 1686 he was granted a pension of &pound;1200 p.a. for &#145;good services to the late and present king&#146;  (<span class="italic">Calendar of Treasury Books</span>, 8.697). However, this latest spell of royal favour did not survive his negative response to the three questions and his consequent loss of local office including the stewardship of Buckingham.<br>
<br>Temple was a late adherent to the cause of William of Orange, joining the prince on 12 December 1688 after James II had fled, &#145;but those as goes in now signifies little but are rather laughed at&#146;  (Verney and Verney, 2.469). Having been returned to the convention for Buckingham on 9 January 1689 Temple again showed himself to be an active speaker from his &#145;uppermost seat&#146;  (Schwoerer, 172), and he supported the abdication and vacancy resolutions and the declaration of rights. In early February 1689 it was reported that Temple and his Buckinghamshire neighbour, Richard Hampden, were &#145;for a Commonwealth and against kingly government&#146;  (Hunt. L., Stowe MSS, STT 410), but in fact Temple had renewed his connection with Danby and was soon to be recognized as a court tory. He was appointed to the customs commission in April, prompting one correspondent to opine: &#145;I find he will be vicar of Bray still, let who will reign, and though all hates him yet he gets what he aims at&#146;  (Verney and Verney, 2.471). In debate he supported the ministry's attempts to obtain adequate war supplies and defended the privileges of the Commons from encroachment by the Lords. In 1693 he published <span class="italic">An Essay on Taxes</span> in which he argued against the monthly assessment or land tax as destructive of the estates of the peers and gentry, and against a general excise. Having recovered from a serious illness in April 1694 he lost his customs place in the following August. Shrewsbury condemned him for &#145;corruption, disaffection, neglect, and in short being good for nothing&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1694&#150;5</i>, 181), but he was a victim of a change in court managers away from Danby (now marquess of Carmarthen) and towards the emerging whig Junto. Temple moved into opposition and in 1696 contributed to the debates on the price of guineas and Fenwick's attainder, which he opposed. Temple died on 10 May 1697 at Stowe and was buried there on the 15th.<br>
