<div class="para">
<span class="headword">FitzRoy, Sir  Charles Augustus</span>  (1796&#150;1858), <span class="occ">colonial governor</span>, was born on 10 June 1796, the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9631/', "Lord Charles FitzRoy (1764&#150;1829)")</script> and grandson of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9628/', "Augustus Henry FitzRoy, third duke of Grafton")</script>. His mother, Frances, daughter of Edward Miller Mundy MP, of Shipley Hall, Derbyshire, died on 9 August 1797 and his father married Lady Frances Anne Stewart, eldest daughter of Robert Stewart, first marquess of Londonderry. FitzRoy was educated at Harrow School (1805&#150;12), commissioned in the Horse Guards in 1812, and was present at Waterloo. On 11 March 1820 he enlarged his aristocratic connections by marrying Lady Mary Lennox (<i>d</i>. 1847), whose father, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16452/', "Charles Lennox")</script>, was the fourth duke of Richmond and mother, Charlotte Gordon, the daughter of the fourth duke of Gordon; they had two sons and a daughter.<br>
<br>FitzRoy was promoted captain in 1820 and, after four months on half pay, went to the Cape of Good Hope in October 1825 as lieutenant-colonel and deputy adjutant-general. He returned to England during 1831, entered parliament as member for Bury St Edmunds, supported the <span class="roman">Reform Bill</span>, and in 1832 surrendered his seat to his brother-in-law. In 1833 he left the army and four years later was made a KH and lieutenant-governor of Prince Edward Island. He served there until 1841 when he obtained a similar position in the Leeward Islands. His capacities as a sound, conciliatory administrator impressed the colonial secretary, Lord Stanley, who in 1845 appointed him to succeed the unpopular Sir George Gipps as governor of New South Wales.<br>
<br>By the time FitzRoy reached Sydney on 2 August 1846, the colony had recovered from a period of depression and was entering an era of prosperity and growth. Less settled was the political scene. In the legislative council, FitzRoy could normally rely on the twelve appointed members. The twenty-four elected representatives, mainly drawn from the pastoral interest, were more troublesome. Under his predecessor, they had sought additional powers for the legislature, but their demands were rejected by the Colonial Office and this bred ill feeling. Tension eased slightly early in FitzRoy's administration when the new colonial secretary, Earl Grey, allowed council to appropriate the casual revenues of the crown. Moreover, the <span class="roman">Waste Lands Occupation Act</span> of 1846 and the order in council of 9 March 1847 ended a lengthy struggle with the squatters by largely accepting their demands concerning their occupancy of crown land. FitzRoy further eased the situation with concessions of his own. In October 1846 he allowed landowners liable to quit rents to discharge them on favourable terms. Subject to certain conditions he also permitted the legislative council to vote on the salaries of government officials.<br>
<br>This was a promising start, but there was still much to test FitzRoy's talents. Grey became increasingly unpopular among the colonists, for he was at heart a paternalist and had strong ideas about how the empire should be run. He criticized FitzRoy for being too conciliatory, but the governor was undeterred and persisted in his efforts to maintain harmony within the colony. This became evident in his reaction to proposals for constitutional change sent by Grey in July 1847. They provided for the federation of the Australian colonies, the separation of Victoria from New South Wales, and the establishment of representative government and district councils everywhere except in Western Australia. As requested, FitzRoy gave full opportunity for this document to be discussed, but he made no public comment of his own. He also avoided taking sides in the conflict generated by Colonial Office moves to resume convict transportation in modified form. Many pastoralists welcomed this step which also found support in the legislative council; urban elements strongly opposed it. FitzRoy responded calmly to their petitions and to demonstrations of protest held in Sydney in June 1849, following the arrival of convicts on the <i>Hashemy</i>.<br>
<br>After news of the protest reached London, no more convicts were sent, but FitzRoy did have to contend with protests arising from the <span class="roman">Australian Colonies Government Act</span> of 1850. This eliminated some of the controversial features of Grey's earlier proposals and it affected New South Wales chiefly by creating the colony of Victoria. No objection was raised to this decision, but advocates of self-government in New South Wales reacted strongly to Grey's failure to give the legislative council greater powers. Once Grey left office in 1852, however, concessions were made and the council was given the opportunity to prepare a new constitution. FitzRoy's views were not entirely those of the council, but he did not stand in its way and forwarded to London the draft which preserved the ascendancy of the pastoralists and increased the powers of the legislature. Meantime, he had been obliged to tackle problems arising from the gold rushes. He moved promptly to protect the rights of the crown and introduced measures that succeeded in raising revenue and safeguarding order.<br>
<br>FitzRoy also had the distinction of being Australia's first governor-general. This position was conferred on him in 1851 by Grey, an ardent free-trader, who was anxious to ensure that self-government was not followed by the erection of inter-colonial tariff barriers. The title, however, remained largely nominal, for FitzRoy did not wish to be involved in the affairs of other colonies and made little attempt to exercise his powers. It is for his work as a governor that he deserves remembering. Despite his aristocratic background he mixed easily with the colonists and helped to steer New South Wales through the period of adjustment that preceded the coming of responsible government. Tragedy had struck on 7 December 1847, when a carriage he was driving hit a tree, killing his wife. After her death his reputation suffered when he was accused of forming improper liaisons with a number of women. This was an unfortunate blemish that was highlighted by the fiery Presbyterian minister, Dr J. D. Lang, who attacked him in an amendment to the farewell address moved by the legislative council. Lang was supported by only five other members and the consensus was that, in general, FitzRoy had acted positively to the colony's advantage.<br>
<br>FitzRoy left Sydney on 20 January 1855, having in June 1854 been created a KCB, and returned to England where, on 11 December, he married Margaret Gordon, widow of J. J. Hawkey and daughter of Lieutenant Alexander Milligan of the 17th rifle brigade; they had no children. FitzRoy obtained no further appointment and died at his home, 2 Half Moon Street, Piccadilly, on 16 February 1858.<br>
