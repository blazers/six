<span class="headword">Eccles, Sir  Josiah</span>  (1897&#150;1967), <span class="occ">engineer and industrialist</span>, was born in northern Ireland on 29 July 1897, the son of Johnston and Mary Anne Eccles. Nothing is known of his schooling but he had begun to study engineering at Queen's University, Belfast, when the First World War began. Eccles left his studies for active service and, in 1917, he was awarded the Military Medal. When peace came he returned to the university, completing his studies in 1922 when he took a BSc in engineering with first-class honours. From 1922 to 1928 he worked with the Metropolitan-Vickers Electrical Company, where he specialized in outside construction work. In 1928 he was elected an associate member of the Institution of Electrical Engineers, becoming a full member ten years later.<br>
<br>From 1928 until 1944 Eccles worked for the electrical department of Edinburgh corporation, first as senior technical assistant and then successively as construction engineer, generating engineer, and deputy engineer; in 1940 he was appointed engineer and manager of the department. He married Katherine Lillie Gillah, daughter of Alfred Summerson, a solicitor, in 1930; they had three children, a son and two daughters.<br>
<br>In 1944 Eccles was appointed Liverpool's city electrical engineer and when the Labour government nationalized the electricity supply industry, he was involved in planning as a member of the organizing committee of the British Electricity Authority (BEA), the industry's new centralized governing body. He was the natural choice for the chairmanship of the newly created Merseyside and North Wales Electricity Board. In the six years he held the position he was concerned with the amalgamation of the distribution operations of a number of formerly independent corporate and municipally owned undertakings. He was appointed CBE in 1950.<br>
<br>Eccles's primary interest, however, had always been in electricity generation, which was the responsibility of the BEA in London; he therefore welcomed the offer that came in 1954 to succeed Sir John Hacking as deputy chairman of the BEA. In his three years with the authority Eccles made his most significant contribution to the generation side through his support for the development of much larger and more thermally efficient sets, hitherto rejected by the more conservatively minded engineers at the BEA. He encouraged F. H. S. (Stanley) Brown, who had worked with him at Liverpool and who became, shortly after Eccles arrived at the BEA, its generation design engineer, to introduce the larger sets into the power station construction programme for the late 1950s and early 1960s. This took the British industry, for a time, into the technological vanguard in Europe. In 1956 Eccles played a major part in securing the appointment of Brown as BEA's chief engineer.<br>
<br>By then the authority was being pressed by the government to expand the nuclear power programme. Eccles opposed this on the grounds that it was neither feasible nor economic and although events were to prove that his views were correct, the rest of his career in the industry was blighted. In 1957 the industry was reorganized and the Central Electricity Generating Board (CEGB) created; the appointment of a nuclear engineer, Christopher Hinton, as its chairman not only bypassed Eccles (who refused to be Hinton's deputy) but also signalled the government's intention to press ahead with the construction of the Magnox nuclear-powered stations. Eccles became deputy chairman of the Electricity Council, also created by the reorganization, and was knighted. In 1961 Eccles was a member of the McKenzie committee on the organization of electricity supply in Scotland, whose recommendations for centralization were rejected, on political rather than economic grounds. Eccles retired from the deputy chairmanship of the Electricity Council in 1961.<br>
<br>Jack Eccles (as he was always known) combined his professionalism as an engineer with a shrewd commercial sense and a willingness to consider new ideas in both engineering and business not always characteristic of senior men in the industry. It was his misfortune that those qualities were not always appreciated by a government with its own agenda for the electricity supply industry and the power to impose its decisions on the nationalized industry. Throughout his life Eccles played an active role in the Institution of Electrical Engineers, as a member of its council from 1945 and serving as its president in 1954. He was made an honorary fellow in 1967. He also participated in several other industry organizations, including the Incorporated Municipal Electrical Association, the British Electrical Development Association, and the British Electrical Power Convention. He wrote many articles on both engineering and management matters in the electricity supply industry. He died at his home, 21 Sandy Lodge Road, Moor Park, Rickmansworth, Hertfordshire, on 14 October 1967.<br>
