<span class="headword">Winthrop,  Fitz John</span>  (1639?&#150;1707), <span class="occ">colonial governor</span>, was the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29779/', "John Winthrop (1606&#150;1676)")</script> and Elizabeth Reade (<i>d</i>. 1672), the daughter of Edmund and Elizabeth Reade of Essex. The balance of probability suggests he was born on 14 March 1639 in Boston and not, as often asserted, in 1638 in Ipswich, Massachusetts. He was brought up in New London, Connecticut. In 1657 he was sent to England and in 1658 received a commission in a regiment commanded by his uncle Thomas Reade. As such he accompanied the regiment on its march from Scotland into England under General George Monck, who promoted him captain. He remained in England until 1663. During that time he lost his loyalty to puritanism and would ever after consider New England crude and unformed. For example, he never became a communicant in a Congregational church after returning to Connecticut. Back in New London he managed his father's businesses, built his own estate, and immersed himself in local concerns. About 1670 he began an affair with a young neighbour, Elizabeth Tongue (1652&#150;1731), with whom he had a daughter, Mary, in 1671. Winthrop at first denied paternity but eventually came to love his &#145;deare child&#146;  (&#145;Letters&#146;, 306). He and Elizabeth Tongue never married and had no more children, but he shared his home with her and made decent provision for her in his will.<br>
<br>In 1674, as a major in the Connecticut militia, Winthrop was sent to stop the Dutch, who had seized Manhattan Island and were extending their rule over Long Island. At Southold he repulsed a Dutch landing party, a victory that gave him an ineradicable military reputation in New England. He was, however, unnerved by his taste of fire and urged to be relieved from an assignment &#145;which I find too heavy for me&#146;  (Trumbull and Hoadly, 2.56). The next year, during King Philip's War, a major conflict between American Indians and colonists, he declined active command, pleading illness. He had indeed a history of poor health, including recurrent seizures, but it must be suspected that he had little stomach for leading men once more into combat.<br>
<br>Winthrop supported the efforts of the Stuart kings after 1684 to replace elected colonial governments with appointed royal officials. His business activities were intercolonial and he was involved in legal disputes that could only be resolved by the privy council. Most of all, he considered New Englanders unruly, &#145;eyther from principles of too fond familiarity or not remembering the rule abroad&#146;  (Fitz John Winthrop to [indecipherable], 15 Feb 1698, Winthrop MSS, Massachusetts Historical Society). He advised Connecticut to surrender its charter and when the New England colonies were merged into the dominion of New England, he accepted appointment as a councillor and major-general. The dominion, however, collapsed in a series of rebellions in 1689. Winthrop disapproved of these uprisings but realized that &#145;there is noe striveinge against the streame of popular resolution&#146;  (<span class="italic">Correspondence</span>, 498).<br>
<br>When the political confusion of the revolution of 1688 allowed the French in Canada to launch devastating raids against New York and New England, those colonies combined their militias in 1690 for an expedition against Montreal. Foolishly, Winthrop accepted command of the force but, when he encountered difficult logistical problems, he quickly abandoned the march far short of its goal, without having encountered the enemy. New York was ready to hang him for treason, but Connecticut commended him for doing all that was humanly possible.<br>
<br>Winthrop was more successful as a diplomat. As agent for Connecticut he was in England from 1693 to 1698; there he obtained a confirmation of the Connecticut charter and defended the colony against charges that it was not pulling its weight in the wars against the French. On his return home he was rewarded with election as governor, a position he held by annual re-election for the rest of his life. In that office he led the Connecticut people into active participation in the English struggle for North America by reminding them repeatedly that their unique degree of self-government demanded an equal measure of imperial responsibility. In November 1707, during a short stay in Boston, he suddenly fell ill and died within days on 27 November. Cotton Mather preached his funeral sermon and &#145;a vast concurse of People&#146; accompanied his body to the churchyard at King's Chapel, where he was buried alongside his father and grandfather on 4 December  (<span class="italic">Diary of Samuel Sewall</span>, 1.581).<br>
<br>Reared as a puritan, arrogant and snobbish in his youth, Winthrop grew affable as he aged. Distrustful of popular government, he was a popular governor. Attached to his own interests and to the interests of New London and Connecticut, he yet remained the faithful servant of an embattled empire.<br>
