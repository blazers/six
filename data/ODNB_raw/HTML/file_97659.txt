<span class="headword">Hughes,  Selwyn</span>  (1928&#150;2006), <span class="occ">evangelical minister and devotional writer</span>, was born on 27 April 1928 at 4 Tunnel Terrace, near Fochriw, Glamorgan, the elder of the two children of John Wyndham Hughes (1906&#150;1986), an underground colliery electrician, and his wife, Lily, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Marshallsea (<i>b</i>. 1906), a former domestic servant. At the time of his birth his parents were sharing with his maternal grandparents their spartan two-roomed accommodation in a remotely situated terrace of four unprepossessing cottages perched on a hillside in the highest inhabited location in south Wales, overlooking the mining village of Fochriw. Despite the austerity of his upbringing in the great depression some of Hughes's most vivid childhood memories were of his relatives enthusiastically recounting tales of religious revival from the extraordinarily influential Welsh revival of 1904&#150;5 and the more recent Pentecostalist ministry of Stephen Jeffreys. Dedicating his nephew shortly after his birth, David Thomas, the pastor of the Assemblies of God mission hall at Fochriw, a former ambulance station where most of the tightly knit congregation were members of Hughes's extended family, prayed that Selwyn, whose name in Welsh signified the attribute of a clear voice, might one day become a great preacher of the gospel.<br>
<br>The continuing economic depression forced Hughes's father in the mid-1930s to seek work at the Metropolitan Vickers factory at Saltley in Birmingham. The sudden experience of displacement suffered by Hughes induced a sense of alienation and introversion for the next three years until his father's failing health necessitated a return to his native Wales on the eve of the outbreak of the Second World War. An avid reader and devoted radio listener, Hughes developed an early love of language, and at the age of twelve he joined the local youth dramatic society, which provided his earliest experience of public speaking. However, his theatrical career ended when his father, a strict teetotaller, took exception to his over-enthusiastic portrayal on stage of a commercial traveller enjoying a convivial glass of whisky, and resolutely walked out of the public performance, much to his son's embarrassment.<br>
<br>After securing a coveted scholarship to Bargoed grammar school in 1940 he left, unusually, after two years, with a special dispensation to undertake an engineering course at Bargoed Technical College. This was followed by a five-year apprenticeship in the Guest, Keen and Nettlefolds steelworks in Dowlais, where he loved &#145;the whirr of the machinery&#146; and &#145;the heavy acrid smell of burning steel&#146; to such an extent that he believed he had found a career that would offer him complete fulfilment in life  (Peters, <span class="italic">Selwyn</span>, 24). Within a few months he was running the apprentices' football pool. For all his family's experience of spiritual revival, he acknowledged in his autobiography that he had been a rebellious teenager, smoking, swearing, chasing pretty girls, and even going through a phase of petty pilfering. However, in February 1944 he experienced a dramatic religious conversion. Passing the open door of the mission hut <i>en route</i> for the dance hall, he heard his father praying fervently for his son's salvation, and when he eventually arrived at the dance hall he found its lure less appealing. He believed that God was calling him and shortly afterwards committed his life to Jesus Christ. On a bitterly cold March morning he was baptized by total immersion in the open air at Fochriw, with crowds watching from the hillside above, followed later by baptism in the Holy Spirit at a Pentecostal convention. He then trained successively as a Sunday school teacher and lay preacher, teaching himself to play the piano accordion to conduct open-air evangelistic campaigns. In 1946&#150;8 he undertook national service at Bedlinog colliery, where the loss of a workmate in a catastrophic roof fall generated a sense of urgency to train for the ordained ministry, which he undertook at the Bristol Bible College, where his uncle had also trained.<br>
<br>After ordination Hughes served in a succession of Assembly of God churches in Cornwall, west Wales, and south Yorkshire. In his first appointment, at Helston, Cornwall, his frugal meal budgeting included a diluted daily penny beef cube for lunch. On 10 April 1951, at the Methodist church in Helston, he married Enid Mary Osmand (1929&#150;1986), manageress of the NAAFI canteen at HMS <i>Culdrose</i>, who considerably enriched both his diet and his ministry through her faithful support for the next thirty-five years.<br>
<br>Hughes's desire to find new ways of communicating the gospel led him to operate outside denominational structures from 1958, when he resigned from the Assemblies of God following official opposition to a new urban mission he had started in Sheffield, near to an established Assemblies of God mission hall. After broadening his experience as a preacher and evangelist in the United States, and declining an offer to remain there, he went to London, where he launched a campaign for spiritual revival in 1963. This developed into the Crusade for World Revival, an international organization founded in 1965 for training Christian counsellors, leaders, and workers throughout the world and disseminating Christian resources. These included the daily devotional <span class="italic">Every Day with Jesus</span>, a bimonthly publication of themed reflections on the <span class="roman">Bible</span> modelled on the accessibility of the <span class="italic">Reader's Digest</span>, which ultimately won Hughes a global influence and respect from Christians of every denomination. When the Crusade for World Revival moved to Waverley Abbey House, near Farnham, Surrey&#151;a Georgian mansion, purchased with donations from his supporters, situated alongside the site of the first English Cistercian abbey&#151;Viscount Tonypandy, the former speaker of the House of Commons and a Welsh Methodist lay preacher, declared at its official opening in 1987 that it would become &#145;a powerhouse for the Lord Jesus Christ in the unfolding years&#146;  (Hughes, <span class="italic">My Story</span>, 2007, 328). It rapidly became Europe's largest centre for training in Christian counselling and pastoral care, introducing a biblical model of understanding people developed by Hughes, and linked to Hughes's international ministry of evangelistic discipleship and seminar programmes that spanned five continents. He also developed an innovatory style of ministry and was one of the first Christian leaders to utilize overhead projectors and later data projectors in his professionally presented teaching seminars. He was awarded an honorary doctorate of divinity in 2004 by Brunel University, when Lord Carey described him as &#145;a giant of the faith&#146;, and he delighted that year in preaching in Cardiff at the centenary of the Welsh revival.<br>
<br>Recordings of Hughes's sermons reveal a quietly spoken, measured delivery, with no pronounced Welsh accent (a consequence of his childhood years in Birmingham), but occasionally rising in volume and quickening in pace to emphasize key points or to challenge his congregation to a deeper spiritual commitment. His appearance, which one observer described as rather dapper, was characteristically modest, with neatly backcombed hair, greying in later portraits, longish sideburns, and lightweight spectacles framing a kindly, expressive face. His sermons, like his <span class="roman">Bible</span> reading notes, were engagingly titled, carefully crafted, graphically illustrated, lightened by humorous anecdotes, and enhanced by carefully selected quotations and examples from his vast reading and his wealth of personal experience.<br>
<br>The death of Hughes's wife after a debilitating, painful struggle with cancer, followed by the tragic loss within the space of ten months of their two sons, David and John, and Hughes's own protracted struggle with prostate cancer, enhanced his empathy with others experiencing suffering. He died at the Phyllis Tuckwell Hospice in Farnham on 9 January 2006, having assured those around him that &#145;he was looking forward to meeting his Lord&#146;  (<span class="italic">Idea</span>, March&#150;April 2006, 14). His funeral at Farnham Baptist Church on 17 January was followed by cremation at Aldershot crematorium. A memorial service was held at Methodist Central Hall, Westminster, on 9 September 2006. The evangelical press pronounced him &#145;one of the UK's most influential post-war Christian leaders&#146; while obituaries in the secular press paid tribute to his &#145;extraordinary achievement&#146; in developing &#145;some of the most popular daily <span class="roman">Bible</span> study tools in the world, with nearly a million readers an issue&#146; (<span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span>, 23 Feb 2006; <span class="italic">The Times</span>, 4 March 2006). His ministry, combining the roles of counsellor, evangelist, pastor, preacher, teacher, and writer, had spanned six decades. His personal authorship of every issue of <span class="italic">Every Day with Jesus</span> had made him one of the most influential Christian devotional writers of any time. Indeed his influence through his preaching and writing in the twentieth century was comparable with that exercised by Spurgeon in the nineteenth century or Wesley in the eighteenth century.<br>
