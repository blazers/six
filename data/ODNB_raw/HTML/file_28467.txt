<span class="headword">Walker,  Alexander</span>  (1764&#150;1831), <span class="occ">army officer in the East India Company</span>, born on 12 May 1764, was the eldest son of William Walker (1737&#150;1771), minister of Collessie in Fife, and his wife, Margaret (<i>d</i>. 1810), daughter of Patrick Manderston, an Edinburgh merchant. Appointed an East India Company cadet in 1780, he went to India in the same ship as the physician Helenus Scott, with whom he formed a lifelong friendship. On 21 November 1782 he became an ensign, and that year served in the campaign under Brigadier-General Richard Mathews directed against Haidar Ali's forts on the coast of Malabar. He was present with the 8th battalion at Mangalore during the siege by Tipu, and offered himself as a hostage on the surrender of the fortress on 30 January 1784. In recompense for the danger he incurred he received the pay and allowance of captain from the Bombay government while in the enemy's hands.<br>
<br>In December 1785 Walker commanded a Bombay government expedition to establish a military and commercial port on the north-west coast of America, from where the Chinese obtained furs. After exploring in 1786 as far north as 62&deg;, however, and remaining a while at Nootka Sound, the enterprise was abandoned.<br>
<br>Walker rejoined the grenadier battalion in garrison at Bombay. On 9 January 1788 he received a lieutenancy, and in 1790 served under Colonel James Hartley as adjutant of the line in the expedition sent to the relief of the raja of Travancore. In 1791 he served under General Sir Robert Abercromby as adjutant of the 10th native infantry during the campaign against Tipu. After the conclusion of the war a special commission was nominated to regulate the affairs of the province of Malabar, and Walker was appointed an assistant. In this capacity he showed ability, became known to the Indian authorities, and received the thanks of Marquess Wellesley. When the commander-in-chief of the Bombay army, General James Stuart, proceeded to Malabar, Walker became his military secretary with the brevet rank of captain. On 6 September 1797 he attained the regimental rank of captain, and in the same year was appointed quartermaster-general of the Bombay army, which gave him the official rank of major. In 1798 he became deputy auditor-general. He took part in the last war against Tipu, and was present at the battle of Seedaseer in 1799 and at the siege of Seringapatam. At the request of Sir Arthur Wellesley, he was selected, on account of his knowledge of the country, to attend the commanding officer in Mysore and Malabar.<br>
<br>In 1800 Walker was dispatched to Gujarat by the Bombay government with a view to tranquillizing the Maratha states in that neighbourhood. His reforms were hotly opposed at Baroda by the indigenous officials, who were interested in corruption. The discontent culminated in 1801 in the insurrection of Malhar Rao, the chief of Kurree. Walker took the field, but, being without sufficient force, could do little until reinforced by Colonel Sir William Clarke, who on 30 April 1802 defeated Malhar Rao under the walls of Kurree. In June, Walker was appointed political resident at Baroda at the court of the guikwar, and in this capacity succeeded in establishing an orderly administration. On 18 December 1803 he attained the regimental rank of major, and in 1805 gained the approbation of the East India Company by negotiating a defensive alliance with the guikwar. In 1807 he restored order in the district of Kathiawar, and with the support of Jonathan Duncan (1756&#150;1811), governor of Bombay, suppressed infanticide. On 3 September 1808 he attained the rank of lieutenant-colonel, and in 1809, after he had embarked for England, he was recalled to Gujarat to repel an invasion by Futtee Singh, the ruler of Cutch. Order was restored by his exertions, and in 1810 he proceeded to England.<br>
<br>On 12 July 1811 Walker married Barbara (<i>d</i>. 1831), daughter of Sir James Montgomery, baronet, of Stanhope, Peeblesshire. They had two sons: Sir William Stuart Walker KCB, who succeeded to the estate of Bowland in Edinburgh and Selkirk, which his father had purchased in 1809; and James Scott Walker, captain in the 88th regiment.<br>
<br>In 1812 Walker retired from the service. In 1822 he was appointed, with the rank of brigadier-general, governor of St Helena, then under the East India Company. An active administrator, he improved agriculture and horticulture by establishing farming and gardening societies, founded schools and libraries, and introduced the culture of silkworms. Soon after retiring he died at Edinburgh on 5 March 1831. While in India, Alexander Walker formed a valuable collection of Arabic, Persian, and Sanskrit manuscripts, which was presented by his son Sir William in 1845 to the Bodleian Library.<br>
