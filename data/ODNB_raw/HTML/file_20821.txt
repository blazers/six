<span class="headword">O'Reilly,  Edward</span>  (<em>c.</em>1770&#150;1829), <span class="occ">lexicographer</span>, was born either in Harold's Cross, near Dublin, or in co. Cavan, and was a member of a branch of an Irish sept which had dominated Cavan in ancient times. It is known, however, that he settled in Dublin about 1790, and there began to learn Irish. After the death of the translator and grammarian William Haliday in 1812, O'Reilly received Haliday's extensive lexicographic collections. Combining these with materials of his own, O'Reilly arranged the whole to form the first Irish-language dictionary. O'Reilly initially met with little encouragement, but eventually succeeded in raising enough subscriptions to enable him to print the work in Dublin in 1817, entitling it <span class="italic">Sanas Gaoidhilge/sags-bh&eacute;arl</span>. The dictionary contained more than 20,000 words that had never before appeared in any Irish lexicon, along with illustrative quotations from a wide variety of ancient and modern writers, and numerous comparisons of the Irish words with those of similar orthography, sense, or sound in Welsh and Hebrew. The work was something of a <i>tour de force</i>, also containing a concise Irish grammar and the Irish names of various indigenous plants alongside their English and Latin names. O'Reilly's dictionary was reissued in 1821, and again in 1864 with a supplement by John O'Donovan.<br>
<br>Not content with this mammoth lexicographic feat, O'Reilly founded the Iberno-Celtic Society in Dublin in 1818, for which he also acted as assistant secretary. The society was primarily a historical and cultural organization, principally formed to preserve and publish the numerous fragments of the laws, history, topography, poetry, and music of ancient Ireland. Through it, O'Reilly published, in Dublin in 1820, <span class="italic">A Chronological Account of Irish Writers</span>, composed of nearly 400 entries, and with a descriptive catalogue of those prose and verse works which were still extant. The book, written in traditional annals form, was the first of its kind and although the dating is often erroneous, O'Reilly's familiarity with the manuscript sources was unprecedented. He had planned a second volume, this time of anonymous manuscripts, but it was never finished.<br>
<br>O'Reilly's commitment to Irish history and culture continued unabated throughout the 1820s. In 1824 he received a prize from the Dublin Royal Irish Academy for an essay on the nature and influence of the ancient Brehon laws, containing useful information on the number and authenticity of the various available documents, accompanied by translations of some of the most interesting sections. The academy awarded O'Reilly a second prize five years later, this time for an essay questioning the authenticity of Macpherson's Ossian poems, which had been published in Gaelic in 1807, under the sanction of the Gaelic Society of London. In the same period, O'Reilly prepared catalogues of Irish-language manuscripts in Dublin libraries, and also assisted Sir William Betham in his genealogical and antiquarian research. Towards the end of his life, O'Reilly was employed to help with Irish nomenclature for the Ordnance Survey maps of Ireland. He was still at work on this project when he died in Dublin in August 1829.<br>
<br>In the second half of the nineteenth century O'Reilly's reputation began to decline following an inaccurate 1864 Dublin reprint of the dictionary, and his grammatical and lexicographic skills were also brought into question by later Victorian linguists and historians. Eugene O'Curry, for instance, drew attention to his inaccuracies in <span class="italic">On the Manners and Customs of the Ancient Irish</span> (3 vols., 1873).<br>
