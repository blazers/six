<span class="headword">Warenne,  William (II)  de</span>, second earl of Surrey <span class="st"> [Earl Warenne]</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1138), <span class="occ">magnate</span>, the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28736/', "William (I) de Warenne (d. 1088)")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/11736/', "Gundrada de Warenne (d. 1085)")</script>, sister of Gerbod the Fleming, earl of Chester, succeeded to the newly created earldom of Surrey on his father's death on 24 June 1088. He usually styled himself &#145;Willelmus comes de Warenna&#146; and less often &#145;Willelmus de Warenna comes Sudreie&#146; (or &#145;Surregie&#146;, &#145;Suthreie&#146;, or &#145;Sudreie&#146;). He was a great-great-nephew of the Duchess Gunnor and thus a kinsman of the Norman kings. From his father he inherited one of the largest of all <span class="roman">Domesday</span> estates, with lands worth about &pound;1165 a year spread across thirteen counties, concentrated in Sussex (the rape of Lewes), Norfolk (including Castle Acre), and Yorkshire (Conisbrough). He was a benefactor of the great Cluniac priory of St Pancras, Lewes, which his parents had founded about 1077, and also patronized the abbeys of St Evroult and St Amand and the priories of Castle Acre, Longueville, Wymondham, Pontefract, and Bellencombre. The Hyde chronicler reports that whereas William (II) de Warenne received his father's lands in England, his younger brother, Reginald, received the maternal lands in Flanders. The chronicler says nothing of the paternal lands in Upper Normandy, centring on the castles of Mortemer-sur-Eaulne and Bellencombre in the Pays de Caux, but they probably went to Reginald as well, and when Reginald died after 1106 passed to Earl William.<br>
<br>In 1118 or 1119 Earl William, probably in his later forties, married Isabel de Vermandois (<i>d</i>. 1147), granddaughter of Henri I of France and widow of the Beaumont magnate Robert, count of Meulan (<i>d</i>. 1118); the offspring of that marriage were the twins Waleran, count of Meulan, and Robert, earl of Leicester, and five or six other children. She and Earl William had five children, including <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28738/', "William (III) de Warenne, earl of Surrey (c.1119&#150;1148)")</script>, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/47230/', "Reginald de Warenne (1121x6&#150;1178/9)")</script>. Through their daughter <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/50012/', "Ada, countess of Northumberland (c.1123&#150;1178)")</script>, Isabel and Earl William were the grandparents of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17860/', "Malcolm IV")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29452/', "William the Lion")</script>, kings of Scotland. Henry of Huntingdon reports that Isabel's first husband, Robert, count of Meulan, had suffered the humiliation of having his wife carried off by &#145;a certain earl&#146;. The circumstances and details of this scandalous event cannot be discerned, but it was not long after Count Robert's death in June 1118 that Isabel married Earl William.<br>
<br>Unlike his father William (I) de Warenne, a veteran of Hastings and a staunch royalist, Earl William was seldom at the court of William Rufus (he attested only one or possibly two of the king's surviving charters) and showed little respect for Henry I during his initial years. The trouble may have begun when, some time in the 1090s, Earl William tried unsuccessfully to win the hand of Matilda, the eldest daughter of King Malcolm and Queen Margaret of Scotland, who was later to marry Henry I. According to the late testimony of Master Wace, Earl William ridiculed the young Henry for his pedantic approach to the joyous aristocratic pastime of hunting, mocking him with the nickname &#145;Stagfoot&#146; for having examined the sport so studiously that he could tell the number of tines in a stag's antlers simply by examining his footprint. At some point after his accession in 1100 Henry tried to win Earl William's support by offering him one of his bastard daughters in marriage, but Archbishop Anselm blocked the project on grounds of consanguinity. When Robert Curthose, duke of Normandy, invaded England on 20 July 1101, Earl William and many other barons joined the ducal side, but Henry bought off Duke Robert with an annuity of 3000 marks, and Earl William was left stranded. For the violation of his homage to the king, and perhaps as a punishment for acts of violence by his men in Norfolk, he was disseised of his English estates and forced into exile.<br>
<br>Earl William complained to Robert Curthose in Normandy of being deprived of his vast English estates, and recovered them when the duke crossed impulsively to England in 1103, interceded with Henry on the earl's behalf, and agreed to relinquish the annuity. Thenceforth Earl William gradually regained the king's confidence and became a trusted member of his <i>familia</i>. At the climactic battle of Tinchebrai in September 1106 he commanded a division of the victorious royal army, and from then until Henry's death in 1135 he is known to have been in the king's company on each of the royal sojourns in Normandy and England. He attended the royal council at Nottingham on 17 October 1109 and was a surety for the king in his treaty of Dover with Robert, count of Flanders, on 17 May 1110. In 1111 he served as a judge in the Norman ducal court. In 1119, on the eve of Henry's crucial battle against Louis VI at Br&eacute;mule, with many Norman lords in rebellion, Earl William is said to have told the king, &#145;There is nobody who can persuade me to treason &hellip; I and my kinsmen here and now place ourselves in mortal opposition to the king of France and are totally faithful to you.&#146;  (<span class="italic">Liber monasterii de Hyda</span>, 316&#150;7). With Earl William's force in the vanguard, Henry's army won a decisive victory.<br>
<br>Henry had taken steps to cement (or reward) Earl William's loyalty by adding to his holdings in England and Normandy. William received (<i>c</i>.1106&#150;21) the great royal manor of Wakefield in Yorkshire, possibly relinquishing lands in Huntingdonshire, Bedfordshire, and Cambridgeshire in partial exchange for it. Henry also ceded to Earl William the castlery of St Sa&euml;ns shortly after its lord, Elias de St Sa&euml;ns, fled Normandy, <i>c</i>.1110, with Henry's nephew and adversary, William Clito. St Sa&euml;ns, three miles up the River Varenne from Bellencombre, constituted a valuable addition to Earl William's estates in Upper Normandy and bound him even more closely to the royal cause. Should Clito ever regain Normandy from Henry I, Clito's friend and guardian Elias would surely recover St Sa&euml;ns. (His family had recovered the castlery by 1150.)<br>
<br>Thus, after his initial false step, William de Warenne became the most ardent of royalists. He attested no fewer than sixty-nine of Henry's charters, and in the reign's one surviving pipe roll (1130) he is recorded as receiving the third highest geld exemption of any English magnate (&pound;104 8<i>s</i>. 11<i>d</i>.)&#151;reflecting both the extent of his landed wealth and the warmth of the king's favour. He was at Henry's deathbed at Lyons-la-For&ecirc;t in 1135 and was one of five <i>comites</i> who escorted his corpse to Rouen for embalming. Afterwards the Norman magnates appointed Earl William governor of Rouen and the Pays de Caux. He was back in England in the spring of 1136 at Stephen's Easter court at Westminster (22 March) and at Oxford shortly afterwards, where he attested Stephen's charter of liberties for the church. His last attestations of royal charters occurred on Stephen's expedition against Exeter in mid-1136, but there is good reason to believe that he was alive in 1137. He probably died on 11 May 1138, and was buried with his parents in Lewes Priory.<br>
