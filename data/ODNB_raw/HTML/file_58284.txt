<span class="headword">Church,  John</span>  (<em>b. </em>1780), <span class="occ">Independent minister</span>, was of unknown parentage. He was found on the steps of a church in London, perhaps St John's, Clerkenwell, and admitted to the Foundling Hospital, where he was given his name. He spent his first six years in the care of a woman at Hadlow, near Tonbridge, in Kent, and then returned to the Foundling Hospital, where he remained until he was ten. There he received a rudimentary education, learning to read but not how to write.<br>
<br>In 1791 Church was apprenticed to a carver and gilder in Great Portland Street, Marylebone, with whom he remained until 1799, when the indenture agreement was broken as a consequence of a quarrel with the master. He felt neglected during this period, often suffering want, and he took every opportunity to educate himself and to acquire a small personal library. After leaving this situation he worked at several jobs for short periods, and on 22 March 1801 he married the daughter of a Mr Elliott of Hampshire at the (Swedenborgian) New Church in the Strand.<br>
<br>Church claimed to have regularly attended Anglican services during his apprenticeship, although he was probably introduced to Swedenborgianism by his employer. He soon moved decisively towards evangelical dissent. From about 1801 he attended meetings of the Itinerant Society and a few years later he began preaching publicly and started a Sunday school. In 1807 he joined the Grafton Street congregation under the ministry of the Revd Burnham and was baptized. He was tried and approved as a preacher, and almost immediately accepted a permanent appointment at an Independent chapel at Banbury, Oxfordshire. On 15 September 1807 he was ordained before a group of Baptist and Independent ministers.<br>
<br>An admirer of the high Calvinist and antinomian doctrines of William Huntington (1745&#150;1813), Church became a controversial preacher, and in 1808 his ministry at Banbury was curtailed due to rumours that he was sodomizing young men in the congregation. Conscious of having acted &#145;imprudently&#146;  (Church, 74), he refused to submit to an investigation of the allegations by the Grub Street congregation which received him upon his return to London. He subsequently took up various <i>ad hoc</i> preaching appointments before becoming the regular minister at the Obelisk Chapel, St George's Fields.<br>
<br>During 1813 rumours began spreading about Church's alleged connection with the White Swan, a notorious homosexual brothel in Vere Street, Clare Market. It was said that he acted as the brothel's chaplain, which involved performing mock marriage ceremonies for male couples. The <span class="italic">Weekly Dispatch</span> published several stories about his life, and perhaps as many as 20,000 pamphlets and broadsides were printed. Church denied the connection with Vere Street, claiming that clerical opponents organized the publicity in order to discredit him. An attempt to prosecute him for sodomy failed, and his own legal action to prevent the <span class="italic">Dispatch</span> from publishing further reports was successful. His following was not diminished by these events, and a year later he laid the foundation-stone of a new chapel, later known as the Obelisk Tabernacle, which was designed to accommodate larger numbers. Following the completion of the Tabernacle, his wife died. He remarried not long afterwards; his second wife, whose name is not known, is thought to have kept a seminary for ladies at Hammersmith.<br>
<br>After two years of calm, Church's troubles were renewed. One night he dreamed that a number of scorpions were crawling about the floor of his chapel; he was able to kill all but two of the creatures &#145;which fled to the very seat that was occupied by ******* and another&#146;  (Church, 121). Shortly afterwards, on 26 September 1816, he was indicted at the Surrey assizes, Croydon, for attempted sodomy upon a young man of his congregation, Adam Foreman. This nineteen-year-old apprentice potter alleged that Church had entered his room one night, placed a hand upon his genitals, and feigned the voice of his mistress. Upon discovery of the ruse, Foreman claimed to have fled. Much publicity surrounded the trial, and on 17 August 1817 Church was found guilty. A large, menacing crowd gathered outside the Obelisk Tabernacle and burned its preacher in effigy. He was sentenced to two years' imprisonment, of which he served 730 days at Newington and Horsemonger Lane gaols. He received many visitors and had access to books, but felt great anguish for much of his sentence. Many of his followers remained loyal and his four children were cared for. On the evening of his release he preached to a congregation of more than 1000 and soon recommenced regular services.<br>
<br>After his release from prison Church's life was spent without further public controversy. The date of his death is unknown. He published a number of sermons, the last in 1826; no record of his life after that date can be found. His opponents called him the devil incarnate, yet he was a popular and evidently charismatic preacher of the Christian gospel, to whom women in particular were drawn. It is not clear that his high Calvinist beliefs led, as his detractors insisted, to a wanton disregard of accepted Christian morality or &#145;practical antinomianism&#146;. For his own part Church represented himself in his autobiography as &#145;a child of providence&#146;, a latter-day Moses whose life was attended by divinely appointed trials and triumphs. Although contemporary rumours about his sexual preferences and practices can be neither proved nor disproved, circumstantial evidence appears to suggest that the &#145;inordinate affections which led me into error&#146;  (Church, 159) to which he referred in this autobiography were homosexual inclinations. London ultra-radicals who delighted in publicizing instances of clerical vice first reclaimed him from historical obscurity; in the twentieth century his life was retold by historians interested in uncovering the homosexual subculture of Georgian England.<br>
