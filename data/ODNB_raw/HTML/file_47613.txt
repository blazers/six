<span class="headword">Millar,  Eric George</span>  (1887&#150;1966), <span class="occ">librarian</span>, was born in Fulham, London, on 24 October 1887, the elder child and only son of George Thomas John Millar (1855&#150;1889), barrister, and his wife, Edith Mary (1862&#150;1942), daughter of Thomas Anstey Guthrie of Kensington. His father died only weeks before the birth of a daughter and his subsequent development was very strongly influenced by his mother's eldest brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/33614/', "Thomas Anstey Guthrie the younger")</script> (F. Anstey, the humorous writer). He was educated at Charterhouse and at Corpus Christi College, Oxford (1906&#150;10), before joining the staff of the manuscripts department of the British Museum in the autumn of 1912.<br>
<br>Millar had already begun to study illuminated manuscripts, with the encouragement of two established scholars, M. R. James, a friend of his uncle, and Sydney Cockerell. Both were to become close personal friends. He became involved in the work of the New Palaeographical Society and the Soci&eacute;t&eacute; Fran&ccedil;aise de Reproductions de Manuscrits &agrave; Peintures. His career was interrupted in 1915, when he enlisted in the Buffs; he served with the 4th battalion in northern India for almost three years before discharge late in 1919. This experience encouraged a lasting taste for Buddhist art. On return he embarked upon a series of publications including a study of the Lindisfarne gospels (1923), a pioneering two-volume survey of English medieval illuminated books (1926&#150;8), and a catalogue of the manuscript collection of A. Chester Beatty (1927&#150;30). It was a source of lifelong regret that the sale of the collection prevented the completion of this ambitious project. His work, meticulous in detail and economic in words, broke new ground and laid solid foundations for later scholars, particularly those who followed him in the investigation of English illumination, an area not well served by previous generations. Millar was elected a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries in 1921, received a DLitt from Oxford University in 1931, and was promoted deputy keeper of his department in 1932. Also in 1932 he published a study of the Luttrell psalter, newly acquired for the nation. His routine departmental work was wide-ranging and included the compilation of a handlist of the Ashley collection of literary manuscripts which, though never published, has remained an essential working tool for well over fifty years. He delivered the Rhind lectures at Edinburgh in 1933 and was Sandars reader in bibliography at Cambridge in 1935. In 1936 he became secretary of the Roxburghe Club; he collaborated with James in a volume on the Bohun manuscripts in that year and published the Rutland psalter in 1937. In 1940 he was seconded to the Ministry of Home Security, before returning to the museum to take up the keepership in 1944. During his three years as head of department he oversaw the return of the collections from their wartime places of safe keeping. Retirement produced a further sequence of Roxburghe Club volumes, the <span class="italic">St Trond Lectionary</span> (1949), the York psalter (1952), <span class="roman">La Somme le Roy</span> (1953), and the <span class="roman">Alnwick Bestiary</span> (1958). He also wrote a monograph on the Parisian miniaturist Honor&eacute; for Faber in 1959.<br>
<br>The York psalter and Honor&eacute;'s <span class="roman">Somme le Roy</span> were the two gems of Millar's private collection, both ultimately bequeathed outright to the British Museum, together with his collection of John Downman's portrait drawings, in memory of his mother. The acquisition of manuscripts, portrait miniatures, watercolours, and drawings was a lifelong passion. He bought the first of the sixty-seven medieval manuscripts known to have passed through his hands as early as 1911 and the last in 1957. His collection also embraced the work of modern scribes and illuminators and included a range of literary autographs, many acquired from his uncle's friends. His drawings and watercolours were mainly works by nineteenth- and twentieth-century illustrators, including <span class="italic">Punch</span> artists who had been associated with F. Anstey. Many of these were crowded onto the walls of his living-rooms. Virtually the whole of this material, including the twenty medieval books in his possession at the end of his life, was willed to the British Museum.<br>
<br>Eric Millar was a heavily built and not notably agile man. His warm personality and his consistent generosity with his time and expertise made him many friends of all ages, both personal and professional. He was noted for his fund of lively reminiscences and his taste for boyish, unsophisticated jokes. He was particularly popular with children, for whose enjoyment his garden in Wiltshire was laid out. He never married, and shared a home at 28 Pembroke Gardens in Kensington with his mother until her death in 1942. Thereafter he divided his time between his leisure retreat, the Summer House at Dinton, near Salisbury, and a Victorian studio at 28 Holland Park Road, London. In 1943 he became a member of the Athenaeum, where he enjoyed meeting and entertaining his friends, who were also on occasion treated to lavish &#145;nursery&#146; teas at his home. For most of his life he was an enthusiastic trout fisherman. He was also a keen photographer, adept with both still and movie cameras. He greatly enjoyed listening to the music of Wagner. He died at West Suffolk Hospital at Bury St Edmunds on 13 January 1966, having collapsed during a stay with friends, and was cremated. His ashes were buried at Dinton with the remains of his mother and his sister.<br>
