<span class="headword">Massingberd,  Francis Charles</span>  (1800&#150;1872), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, the son of Francis Massingberd, rector of Washingborough, near Lincoln, and Elizabeth, his wife, youngest daughter of William Burrell Massingberd of Ormsby Hall, was born at his father's rectory, on 3 December 1800, and baptized on 30 December. After preparatory education at a school at Eltham, Kent, he entered Rugby School in 1814. He matriculated at Magdalen College, Oxford, and was elected a demy on 23 July 1818. He gained a second class in <i>literae humaniores</i>, and graduated BA on 5 December 1822 and MA on 26 June 1825. He was ordained deacon by Edward Legge, bishop of Oxford, on 13 June 1824 and priest by Bishop Tomline of Lincoln on 5 September 1825, and was instituted to the family living of South Ormsby, Lincolnshire, on 9 December of that year.<br>
<br>The previous summer, together with his friend William Ralph Churton, Massingberd had accompanied Thomas Arnold, headmaster of Rugby School, on a visit to Italy, undertaken by Arnold to identify the line of Hannibal's passage over the Alps, and to explore the battlefields of his campaign, for the purposes of his history of Rome. He returned to Rome for health reasons in the early 1840s. On 15 January 1839 he married at Putney church Fanny (<i>d</i>. 2 April 1891), eldest daughter of William Baring MP and his wife, Frances, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Paulett Thompson. They had two sons: Francis Burrell, a captain in the 5th lancers, and William Oswald, an Anglican clergyman.<br>
<br>Massingberd was an exemplary rural clergyman. He rebuilt Driby church and thoroughly restored that at Ormsby; he erected a new rectory on a better site, and built premises for schools that developed from classes he had started in a kitchen. In 1840, at the request of his life-long friend, Edward Churton, he wrote on the leaders of the Reformation, volume 21 of the <span class="roman">Englishman's Library</span>, of which Churton was editor. Published in 1842, it reached a fourth edition in 1866. It reflects a distinct but unembittered high-churchmanship in the tradition of John Keble, as do his other main publications, <span class="italic">The Educational and Missionary Work of the Church in the Nineteenth Century</span> (1857) and <span class="italic">Lectures on the Prayer Book</span> (1864). In 1846 he declined an offer from Bishop Phillpotts of Exeter to move into that diocese with the prospect of appointment to the first vacant archdeaconry. He was appointed to the prebendal stall of Thorngate in Lincoln Cathedral by Bishop Kaye on 15 May 1847, and was made chancellor and canon residentiary by Bishop Jackson on 11 December 1862.<br>
<br>From an early period Massingberd was a strenuous advocate for the revival of the deliberative functions of convocation. In 1833 he published <span class="italic">Reasons for a Session of Convocation</span>, and when that object was attained he was one of its most active members, first as proctor for the parochial clergy in 1857, and subsequently, in 1868, for the chapter. He frequently sat on committees and drew up their reports, and took a large share in the debates, proving himself a persuasive, if prolix, speaker. As chancellor of Lincoln he directed his efforts to the increase of the practical efficiency of the cathedral. Together with other minor reforms, he was the first to institute an afternoon nave sermon, and during successive Lents he delivered courses of lectures on the prayer book and on church history. He died at 2 Cambridge Place, London, of congestion of the lungs on 5 December 1872, and was buried at South Ormsby.<br>
