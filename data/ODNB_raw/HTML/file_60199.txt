<span class="headword">Allan,  Eliza MacNaughton Luke <span class="st"> [Dot]</span></span>  (1886&#150;1964), <span class="occ">novelist</span>, was born on 13 May 1886 at Headswood House, Denny, Stirlingshire, the only child of Alexander Allan, iron merchant, and his wife, Jean, daughter of John Luke, founder of the Vale paper works in Denny. She was educated privately and attended classes at Glasgow University.<br>
<br>Allan is described as small, soft-voiced, of a retiring disposition, with dark hair and grey eyes. While still a young woman she moved to Glasgow with her widowed mother, never marrying and remaining there for the rest of her life. Although the archetypal &#145;daughter at home&#146;, who largely abandoned writing during both world wars to concentrate on nursing and charity work, she was nevertheless a prolific freelance journalist, wrote several plays (theatregoing was one of her main interests), and published ten novels between 1921 and 1958.<br>
<br>Allan once said in an interview: &#145;I don't believe in the localisation of a writer's talent. One ought to take the world for one's field if one wants to&#146;  (Kyle). Glasgow provides the setting for her earlier novels, and the theme of <span class="italic">Deepening River</span> (1932) is the development of Clyde shipbuilding from the eighteenth to the early twentieth century. However, her characters, as in her first novel, <span class="italic">The Syrens</span> (1921; published simultaneously in Britain and the USA and translated into Dutch), often reject the conventions of their place and time. <span class="italic">Makeshift</span> (1928), though uneven in quality, is notable for its young heroine's determination that her life, unlike her mother's, shall not be &#145;second best&#151;makeshift all the time&#146; and that she will not be &#145;used&#146;, practically or emotionally. Her sexual awareness, too, is identified and expressed with unexpected frankness.<br>
<br>Allan's best-known novel, <span class="italic">Hunger March</span> (1934), follows the events of one day in a depression-hit city, unnamed but recognizable as Glasgow. Through contrasting but linked characters, including a merchant facing bankruptcy, his office cleaner and her long-term unemployed son, and an enthusiastic middle-class radical, Allan presents the great hunger march which swamps the city centre during the afternoon and evening of her chosen day. Her sympathies are with the marchers, but she acknowledges equally the despair of the conscientious employer. There is a clear indictment throughout of the apathy and insensitivity she sees in the prosperous middle class to which she herself belonged.<br>
<br>Allan published little or nothing during the Second World War, and her post-war novels, most of which have historical settings, did not attract great attention. <span class="italic">John Mathew, Papermaker</span> (1948) is closely based on her mother's family, papermakers since 1780. She was a member of Scottish PEN and in her later years gave unobtrusive financial support to a number of aspiring writers. She died of cancer at her home, 5 Hamilton Drive, Glasgow, on 3 December 1964, and a private funeral took place two days later, after a service at Belhaven Westbourne church.<br>
