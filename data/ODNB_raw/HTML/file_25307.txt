<span class="headword">Sheldon,  Richard</span>  (1570?&#150;1651?), <span class="occ">Church of England convert and polemicist</span>, was born in Wolverhampton, Staffordshire, almost certainly a relative of the Sheldons of Beoley, Worcestershire, and Weston, Warwickshire, and was raised a Roman Catholic. He became a student at the English College for training secular priests at Rheims, France, in January 1589, and was sent on to the English College at Rome, where he was admitted as a <i>metaphysicus</i> in October 1590. He describes himself as well reputed in learning, and was ordained subdeacon, deacon, and priest in 1593, but his observations of the higher clergy in Rome, when he had become zealous and willing for martyrdom, apparently left him very critical. About 1595 he was sent via Genoa to Alicante in Spain. Accompanied by Robert Persons, he had access to Cardinal Cajetan and the Jesuit general, Acquaviva, and was at Valladolid by April 1596, presumably to study further at St Alban's College there.<br>
<br>By November Sheldon had arrived in Flanders, and before the end of the year he began working in England, at least partly in Oxfordshire, moving, he states, in the best circles. He testifies to being zealous in exhorting and writing, and preaching diligently, on at least one occasion for an hour and a half. Even at this time he emphasized respect for civil authority and thus clashed with Jesuits. The Gunpowder Plot &#145;of the accursed Catesby&#146;  (Sheldon, <span class="italic">Certain General Reasons</span>, introduction) was a turning point for him, and was reinforced by the assassination of Henri IV of France in 1610. He felt vehemently that it was completely wrong to bring in the kingdom of God by subversion, and bitterly attacked the Jesuits for, in his view, advocating it. He surreptitiously attended Anglican services, and records how his views changed &#145;as God touched my heart&#146;. Sung psalms and preaching immediately struck him by their simplicity and gravity, &#145;that I began to thinke &hellip; perhaps God is among them&#146;, but when he discovered that most of the liturgy &#145;was composed out of the infallible word of God &hellip; I resolved that the same must needs be good&#146;. With the subsequent appreciation that &#145;the Preachers continually did inculcate &hellip; integritie of conscience, and holinesse of conversation with the necessitie of good works to salvation: I well and clearly perceived how the Church of England was calumniated by the Roman Doctors&#146;. He was also very impressed by the integration of mind and tongue in the liturgy, &#145;with their pious sounds to beate the gates of heaven, and begge mercie at his hands onely: who with the Father and the holy Ghost I saw onely worshipped&#146;  (Sheldon, <span class="italic">Motives</span>, 135&#150;6).<br>
<br>Sheldon was at St Omer about the time of Henry Garnet's execution in 1606, perhaps because he was banished, but perhaps also because he was, as Benjamin Norton wrote to Geoffrey Pole, &#145;a broker for the Jesuites in getting monie for St O[mer], and rich Nunns for Bruxells&#146;  (Questier, 90&#150;91). He returned to England, but was arrested and exiled in 1610, when he spent time in theological discussion at Louvain. As early as October that year, according to Norton, he may have taken the oath of allegiance to James I, but when he again arrived in England in April 1611 he was immediately captured, probably under the name Gervaise Sheldon. He was imprisoned in Newgate, one of the London gaols for people likely to be executed, and there he again reportedly took the oath of allegiance to James I. This doubtless led to his transfer to the Clink, which was much more lenient. There he was set to confer with secular priest Thomas Leek and persuade him to take the oath, and also wrote <span class="italic">Certain General Reasons, Proving the Lawfulness of the Oath of Allegiance</span> (1611), allegedly for a friend. This fell into the hands of the archbishop of Canterbury, who urged publication. Sheldon writes still as a Roman Catholic priest, but attacks the Jesuits for exalting papal authority, and denies the pope has power to depose rulers. He argues that they all receive their authority from God, the ultimate source of temporal power, and are irremovable. Such views show to his readers that he was moving to apostasy from Roman Catholicism: this gave the work special propaganda value in Archbishop Abbot's anti-popery campaign. Sheldon may in part have been making a shrewd bid for his patronage. By mid-December 1611 he was reported to have &#145;gone to church&#146;  (ibid., 134). His <span class="italic">Motives of Richard Sheldon &hellip; for his just, voluntary, and free renouncing of communion with the bishop of Rome</span>, published by authority in February 1612, argued that papal authority and other Roman Catholic doctrines were not scriptural nor existed in the early church. At this point he was released and pardoned by the king for activities deemed treasonable under the 1585 act against Jesuits and seminary priests; Bishop James Montague of Bath and Wells took him to kiss the king's hand. On 28 March he preached a sermon in St Martin-in-the-Fields, London, on Christ as the sole sacrifice for sin, and the following day seems to have delivered it again as his formal recantation sermon at Paul's Cross; it was subsequently published as <span class="italic">The First Sermon of R. Sheldon Priest</span> (1612).<br>
<br>Sheldon was then employed by James I to write with William Warmington, another former Catholic who had defended the oath of allegiance, a book against Vorstius, but Warmington subsequently reverted to Catholicism, and any resulting book was not published. Sheldon also served as a royal chaplain to James and later to Charles I. Archbishop Abbot presented him to the vicarage of Appledore-with-Ebony, Kent, in November 1612. In his <span class="italic">Motives</span> Sheldon had fulminated against clerical celibacy: clearly he found it hard. On 9 March 1613 he married in Hackney Ann (possibly also known as Agnes) Smyth, described in Catholic correspondence as &#145;a rich maiden or widow&#146;  (Questier, 230n.); they had six known children.<br>
<br>Sheldon's views had become more anti-Catholic by the time <span class="italic">A Survey of the Miracles of the Church of Rome</span> was published in 1616, since this identified the pope with Antichrist. Such views supported Archbishop Abbot's campaign against a Spanish match for Prince Charles, but led to a rift with James I. None the less, Sheldon not only preached before the king but also published his <span class="italic">Christ, on his Throne: not in Popish Secrets</span> (1622), albeit with an apologetic preface. In 1623 he preached a sermon at Paul's Cross, London, attacking the pope as the beast in <span class="roman">Revelation</span>, and his followers as damned, for which the king reprimanded him. However, this eventually appeared in print as <span class="italic">A Sermon &hellip; Laying Open the Beast, and his Marks</span> (1625) as a counterblast to Charles's marriage arrangements for Henrietta Maria of France, which included Roman Catholic toleration in her household and the suspension of the penal laws. Meanwhile Sheldon was not without patrons: he was created an honorary DD of Cambridge and was instituted to the vicarage of Bearstead, Kent, in November 1624. Under Charles I he sought favour by a treatise on the royal prerogative, but Archbishop Laud ignored it, and Sheldon petitioned for its return five years later.<br>
<br>Sheldon continued as vicar of both his benefices for the rest of his life. His parishioners at Appledore-with-Ebony responded to the 1640 Kentish petition against the clergy by recounting that Sheldon had left two competent curates undisturbed on his institution, in Ebony's case at the parishioners' request, had raised their salaries and those of their successors to as much as they and their parishioners wished, and had secured hard-working, preaching, men. At Bearstead, he constantly used the prayer book, and catechised with exposition each Sunday. Though he was summoned by the Commons on 4 April 1642 when they investigated Sir Edward Dering's petition supporting the prayer book and royal control of the militia, they let the case lapse. He describes himself as living in Bearstead and as minister of God's word in his will, finalized in September 1648. He was sufficiently well off to leave the equivalent of &pound;300 to each of his three surviving sons, some of which was invested in the East India Company, to dower his two daughters for marriages with gentlemen, and to leave each a silver spoon. He probably died at Bearstead in 1651, his will being proved on 3 December that year by his widow and executrix.<br>
