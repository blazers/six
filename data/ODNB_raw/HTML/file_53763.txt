<span class="headword">Jabavu, John Tengo</span>  (1859&#150;1921), <span class="occ">journalist and politician in South Africa</span>, was born on 11 January 1859 at Tyatyora village, near Healdtown in the eastern Cape, the youngest child of humble parents, Ntwanambi Jabavu and his wife, Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Mpinda. Jabavu's family belonged to the Mfengu, who had fled from Natal during Shaka's wars (1818&#150;28) and settled among the Xhosa of the eastern Cape. Strongly influenced by missionary teaching, the Mfengu had adopted Christian ideals, and were inclined towards European models of education and peasant agriculture. Jabavu was very much a product of this tradition. In 1875 he graduated from the Methodist institution at Healdtown and took up a teaching position at Somerset East in the eastern Cape.<br>
<br>While teaching at Somerset East, Jabavu became the local correspondent for some of South Africa's leading newspapers as well as apprenticing himself to a printer. He attracted the attention of Dr James Stewart of the Lovedale Mission School, who was looking for someone to edit the institution's Xhosa-language journal, <span class="italic">Isigidimi sama-Xosa</span> (&#145;The Xhosa messenger&#146;). As editor, Jabavu took a keen interest in Cape politics and during the Cape elections of 1883 he canvassed actively for one of the candidates. His partisan and controversial attitudes did not find favour with the missionary hierarchy and his editorial contract was not renewed.<br>
<br>But Jabavu had become convinced of the existence of a literate readership sufficient to support a Xhosa-language newspaper untrammelled by missionary inhibitions and willing to articulate their views and their opinions. In 1884 he launched his own newspaper, <span class="italic">Imvo Zabantsundu</span> (&#145;Black opinion&#146;), with financial backing from two white businessmen with political interests. The franchise of Cape Colony, though qualified, was at that time colour-blind and African voters held the balance of power in at least five eastern Cape constituencies. Jabavu's opinions thus carried considerable political weight, and he used his influence to fight various pieces of legislation which were designed to disarm and disenfranchise Cape Africans, to seize their lands, and to restrict their freedom of movement.<br>
<br>Jabavu was recognized for nearly fifteen years as the leading spokesman for African interests throughout southern Africa. He lost his pre-eminence, however, as the result of a split which occurred in Cape politics after Cecil Rhodes was deposed as premier of the Cape in 1896. Rhodes formed the Progressive Party, which was closely identified with the British imperial interests, whereas his opponents gravitated to the Afrikaner Bond. Several of Jabavu's white political allies tended towards the Bond, and Jabavu himself was impressed with the liberal racial attitude of its leader, Jan Hofmeyr. During the Cape elections of 1898, Jabavu backed the Bond candidates. Rhodes retaliated by sponsoring a rival newspaper with the assistance of Jabavu's long-term political adversary W. B. Rubusana. Because Jabavu was a Mfengu and Rubusana was a Xhosa, this rivalry acquired a nasty ethnic tinge.<br>
<br>Jabavu's association with the Afrikaner Bond led to the closure of <span class="italic">Imvo</span> by martial law during the South African War of 1899&#150;1902. He became increasingly dependent on his white associates and this dependence, together with his jealousy of Rubusana, caused him to take idiosyncratic stands which lost him the confidence of many of his supporters. Jabavu refused, for example, to attend the inaugural meeting in 1912 of the South African Native National Congress (subsequently the African National Congress), and insisted on setting up his own organization instead. He later supported the notorious 1913 <span class="roman">Native Land Act</span>, which was introduced by his ally J. W. Sauer. In 1914 he challenged Rubusana, the sitting member, for the only African-held seat in the Cape provincial legislature. This split the African vote and threw the seat to the white candidate.<br>
<br>Jabavu married twice: in 1885 to Elda Sakuba (1864&#150;1900), with whom he had four sons (the eldest of whom was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/94432/', "Dandson Don Tengo Jabavu")</script>), and in 1901 to Gertrude Joninga, with whom he had three daughters. He died quite suddenly on 10 September 1921 while attending a meeting at the University College of Fort Hare. Though his historical reputation has been soured by the obstinacy and jealousy of his later years, his place in the pantheon of black journalism and African nationalism remains secure.<br>
