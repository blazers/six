<span class="headword">Rawling,  Cecil Godfrey</span>  (1870&#150;1917), <span class="occ">army officer and explorer</span>, was born at Stoke, Devonport, on 16 February 1870, the second son of Samuel Bartlett Rawling, of Stoke, and his wife, Ada Bathe Withers, of Purton, Wiltshire. He was educated at Clifton College, Bristol.<br>
<br>Rawling entered the army through the militia and was commissioned on 10 October 1891 a second lieutenant in the Somerset light infantry. He was promoted lieutenant on 1 February 1896 and spent most of his service in India, where his love of hunting took him on leave into and across the Himalayan mountains. In 1902 he crossed the Lanak-la Pass into Tibet as a preliminary reconnaissance for a more ambitious expedition. Rawling, accompanied by Lieutenant A. J. G. Hargreaves, retraced his steps the next year and crossed the same pass on an unofficial exploration mission. Over the next nine months his party explored and mapped approximately 38,000 miles of hitherto unsurveyed country in western Tibet and Rudok, an achievement for which they later received the thanks of the government of India.<br>
<br>Rawling was employed in 1904 with the Lhasa mission. When Sir Francis Younghusband, the British commissioner, returned from Lhasa to Gyantse he selected Rawling to lead the very important exploration of the upper Tsanpo River (the Brahmaputra) in 1904&#150;5. This was recognized as a potentially hazardous undertaking since the Tibetans were thought to be hostile and the return journey to Simla would have to be made in the middle of winter. Rawling's small detachment left the main party at Gyantse, and travelled west along the north of Nepal, through Gartok, and then on to Simla; during its journey the party clearly identified Mount Everest, for the first time from the north. He briefly returned to England, and then in 1909 was made a CIE and was appointed a surveyor to the Ornithologists' Union's scientific expedition in Dutch New Guinea, of which he later took successful command when its leader was invalided. He mapped a large area of this hitherto unknown country and was the first European to encounter the Tapiro pygmies. For his services Rawling received the thanks of the Dutch government. Rawling was also rewarded by the Royal Geographical Society with the Murchison bequest (1909) and the patrons' gold medal (1917). In 1911 he returned to his regiment and on 27 November 1913 he was promoted major.<br>
<br>Following the outbreak of the First World War Rawling, promoted temporary lieutenant-colonel on 11 August 1914, raised and trained the 6th (service) battalion of the Somerset light infantry. He subsequently commanded this unit in France with the rank of colonel. Rawling fought at Hooge in July&#150;August 1915, served during the winter of 1915&#150;16 in the Ypres salient, and then took part in the battle of the Somme, including the capture of Fricourt, Mametz Wood, and Gueudecourt after fierce fighting. He was created CMG and in July 1916 was promoted brigadier-general. During the summer of 1917 he participated in fighting on the Hindenburg line, and later he was at Passchendaele in command of the 62nd infantry brigade, and was awarded the DSO. On 28 October 1917 Rawling was killed, at the age of forty-seven, outside his brigade headquarters at Hooge by a stray shell. He was buried at the Huts cemetery, near Ypres, in Belgium.<br>
