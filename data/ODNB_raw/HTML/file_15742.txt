<span class="headword">Knightbridge,  John</span>  (1619/20&#150;1677), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and founder of the Knightbridge professorship in moral theology at Cambridge</span>, was the fourth son of John Knightbridge (<i>d</i>. 1640), attorney of Chelmsford, Essex, and his wife, Mary, daughter of Charles Tucker of Lincoln's Inn. He matriculated from Wadham College, Oxford, on 8 December 1637, aged seventeen. His elder brother Richard (<i>b</i>. 1611/12) had matriculated from there in 1629. John was a scholar from 1639 to 1647, and graduated BA on 4 December 1641. On 3 May 1645 he migrated to Peterhouse, Cambridge, where five days later he was admitted to a fellowship in place of the ejected Christopher Bankes of Yorkshire. He became lecturer at St Nicholas, Newcastle, in 1657, and after resigning his fellowship in July 1659 he became rector of Spofforth, Yorkshire. He was also rector of Holy Trinity, Dorchester, from 1663 to 1670. In 1673 Knightbridge took the degree of DD, having graduated BD from Peterhouse in 1655.<br>
<br>It is, however, for the bequests of his will rather than the scope of his learning that Knightbridge is most remembered; he died in the parish of St Paul, Covent Garden, London, in December 1677, having made provision for bequests to benefit both his colleges and his home town. He left &pound;40 each to the common funds of Wadham and Peterhouse, and gave to the master and fellows of Peterhouse as feoffees in trust his fee-farm rent of the manor of Heslington near York, a house in the Minories, London, &pound;7 a year from his land in Chelmsford called Little Vinters, and another house and land on condition that they paid &pound;50 annually to a professor of moral theology or casuistical divinity. The first election to the chair, called the Knightbridge professorship, followed in 1683, the first holder of the post being Thomas Smoult of St John's College, who himself further endowed it with a bequest upon his death in 1707. Later Knightbridge professors included Edmund Law, later bishop of Carlisle, and Frederick Denison Maurice; Knightbridge himself was enrolled among the primary benefactors of the university at Cambridge's commemoration services. He also presented a library for the use of the clergy of Chelmsford and the neighbourhood. This was long housed in a chapel on the north side of Chelmsford parish church; since the church's elevation to cathedral status the Knightbridge library has been moved to the cathedral's south porch library.<br>
