<span class="headword">Craik,  Helen</span>  (1751&#150;1825), <span class="occ">author</span>, was born at Arbigland, Kirkbean, Kirkcudbright, the daughter of William Craik (1703&#150;1798), agriculturist, justice of the peace, and inspector of customs, and Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1787), only daughter of William Stewart, of Shambellie, in Newabbey parish. She grew up at Arbigland, the manor house that her father had built in 1755. One of six legitimate children, she shared her birthplace with <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15052/', "John Paul Jones (1747&#150;1792)")</script>, the naval officer, son of John Paul, gardener at Arbigland, but rumoured to have been one of her father's illegitimate sons. Craik's powerful father was involved in local and national politics, and greatly increased the value of Arbigland through his agricultural innovation. He may also have been involved in the alleged murder (officially ruled a suicide) in 1792 of a man said to be Helen Craik's fianc&eacute;, a groom on her father's estate, whom local history sources suggest her family had killed because they disapproved of the relationship. The murder remains unverifiable, but Craik did leave Arbigland in 1792 for self-exile at her family's other estate: Flimby Hall, near Maryport, Cumberland. Though she was William Craik's sole surviving legitimate child, in 1792 he gave all his property to a distant relative, John Hamilton.<br>
<br>While still at Arbigland, Craik was a friend and correspondent of Robert Burns; he wrote to her in 1790 and 1792 of his admiration for her poem &#145;Helen&#146; (lost), and she wrote the dedicatory poem on the title-page of his Glenriddell manuscript of poems. Most of her poetry is now lost; a few examples, published by her descendant George Neilson in the <span class="italic">Glasgow Herald</span> in 1919&#151;such as her two poems to her friend Robert Riddell&#151;survive. Neilson noted &#145;the recurrent Werterism of Miss Craik's poems&#146;, and that &#145;[w]hether fostered by &#147;Werter&#148; or not, a kindred tragic sentimentality appears in Miss Craik's preference for suicidal and murderous subjects&#146;  (Neilson, &#145;The Maid of Enterkin: Burnsiana 1&#146;).<br>
<br>At Flimby between 1796 and 1805 Craik published five anonymous novels, all with William Lane's popular Minerva Press. Her first novel, <span class="italic">Julia de St. Pierre</span> (1796), in which she refers enigmatically to the &#145;peculiarly painful circumstances&#146; in the life of the &#145;once persecuted Author&#146;  (vol. 1, p. 3), offers a sentimental portrait of a French emigrant woman as virtue in distress. This theme of persecuted, exiled women, often with murdered lovers or husbands and concerned with issues of justice, was one of Craik's favourites. Though published anonymously, like all her novels, <span class="italic">Julia</span> also included a long poem, &#145;The Maid of Enterkin&#146;. Craik's descendant George Neilson referred to this poem in his article on her unpublished poetry in the <span class="italic">Glasgow Herald</span>, which also confirms her authorship of the five novels, previously attributed to her through a Minerva Press catalogue.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">Adelaide de Narbonne, with Memoirs of Charlotte de Cordet</span> (1800) is Craik's most innovative novel, one of the earliest historical novels, and possibly the first British fictional account of Charlotte Corday, who assassinated the Jacobin Marat in 1793. Craik allies her fictional heroine, Cordet, with the feminism of Mary Wollstonecraft, Mary Robinson, and Helen Maria Williams, the foremost British chronicler of the French Revolution. Drawing on the Gothic romances of Anne Radcliffe and Horace Walpole, Craik fashioned a unique hybrid of historical Gothic that addressed controversial recent events in France, particularly the destructive consequences of women's lack of political and economic rights. This concern with women's rights is also visible in <span class="italic">Stella of the North, or, The Foundling of the Ship</span> (1802) and in <span class="italic">The Nun and her Daughter, or, Memoirs of the Courville Family</span> (1805), the former set in Dumfriesshire. <span class="italic">Henry of Northumberland, or, The Hermit's Tale</span> (1800), based on the Hermit of Warkworth, is Craik's only known novel that is not set in her own day.<br>
<br>Craik outlived her relatives in Flimby, inheriting sums from them, and in 1807 gained half the proceeds of the sale of the family's Flimby estate (&pound;16,504). She died at Flimby Hall, unmarried, on 11 June 1825. Her obituaries and her memorial in St Nicholas's Church, Flimby (where she was buried), remember her as a published author of works in English and French (now unknown), and as a dedicated philanthropist to the poor&#151;a characteristic that she shares with her fictional heroines.<br>
