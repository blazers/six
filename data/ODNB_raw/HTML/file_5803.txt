<span class="headword">Coetlogon,  Charles Edward  de</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1747, <em>d.</em> 1820), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, was the son of Dennis de Coetlogon, physician, and author of <span class="italic">An Universal Dictionary of Arts and Sciences</span> (1740). As his father died when his son was still very young, Coetlogon was admitted to Christ's Hospital in April 1755, where the entry records his date of baptism as 13 March 1747. He proceeded on a university exhibition to Pembroke College, Cambridge, where he was registered as a sizar on 28 June 1766 and thereafter graduated BA in 1770, proceeding MA in 1773. At university he was a member of a small religious club which was led by Rowland Hill and included among its other members David Simpson (later of Macclesfield), like Hill a student at St John's College, and Coetlogon's former school contemporary Thomas Pentycross (later of Wallingford). They engaged in the study of the Greek <span class="roman">New Testament</span>, prison visiting, and preaching in the town in Cambridge.<br>
<br>On graduation Coetlogon was briefly curate of Marden, Kent, in 1770, but he quickly came to the notice and secured the patronage of the influential evangelical earl of Dartmouth, as a result of which he was appointed assistant chaplain to Martin Madan at the Lock Hospital for reformed prostitutes in London. It was here that he established his considerable reputation as a popular and eloquent preacher, thereby securing further patronage in the person of Sir Sidney Stafford Smythe, lord chief baron of the exchequer, whose funeral sermon, <span class="italic">The Death of the Righteous a Public Loss</span>, he delivered in 1778 (it was published in the same year). He acted as chaplain to Alderman Pickett during his mayoralty in 1789&#150;90, at the conclusion of which he published <span class="italic">Ten Discourses Delivered in the Mayoralty of 1790</span>. He also preached on the deaths of the evangelicals William Romaine (<span class="italic">The Life of the Just</span>, 1795) and William Bromley Cadogan (<span class="italic">The True Greatness and Excellency of the Ministerial Character</span>, 1797). Coetlogon's protestantism and patriotism were celebrated in other sermons such as <span class="italic">A Seasonable Caution Against the Abominations of the Church of Rome</span> (1779), <span class="italic">The Protestant Reformation of the Sixteenth Century</span> (1818), and <span class="italic">The king, or, Faint sketches for a true portrait of the venerable sovereign of the British empire</span> (1820), while his Calvinistic predilections no doubt inspired his decision to edit Jonathan Edwards's <span class="italic">The Justice of God in the Damnation of Sinners</span> (1774) and <span class="italic">The Eternity of Hell Torments</span> (1788). He also published an edition of Edward Young's <span class="italic">Night Thoughts</span> (1793), wrote a preface to Francis Quarles's <span class="italic">Emblems</span> (1788), and edited the <span class="italic">Theological Miscellany</span> which ran from January 1784 to December 1789. His <span class="italic">Miscellaneous Works</span> appeared in three volumes in 1807. He is there described as vicar of Godalming, Surrey, a mistake for Godstone, Surrey, to which he had been preferred in 1794.<br>
<br>Coetlogon enjoyed a considerable reputation as an extempore preacher. His imposing presence was reinforced by an impressive manner and use of gestures. These qualities of delivery were matched, in the eyes of the veteran evangelical Henry Venn, by the quality of content. He wrote of the young Coetlogon in February 1775, &#145;His discourses are all I want to hear&#151;judicious, doctrinal in a proper degree, very experimental, and faithfully applied&#146;  (Venn, <span class="italic">Life &hellip; of the &hellip; Rev. H. Venn</span>, 224). A different view, however, was expressed by William Wilberforce, who was a regular attender at the Lock Hospital chapel. On Christmas day 1790, for example, he declared that he &#145;much disliked De Coetlogon&#146;  (Wilberforce, 1.286). In his last years Coetlogon became too ill to carry out his pastoral duties. He died at Stamford Street, Blackfriars Road, London, on 16 September 1820 and was buried nine days later in Godstone churchyard, where there is a memorial inscription to him. Charles Frederick de Coetlogon (<i>d</i>. 1836), who also has a memorial inscription there, was probably his son.<br>
