<span class="headword">Lucas, Sir  Thomas</span>  (1597/8&#150;1648/9), <span class="occ">royalist army officer</span>, was the eldest and illegitimate son of Thomas Lucas (<i>d</i>. 1625) of Colchester and Elizabeth Leighton (<i>d</i>. 1647). His parents' failure to marry before his birth may be explained by his father's exile from England in Queen Elizabeth's later years for participation in a fatal duel. Despite his illegitimacy Thomas was fully integrated into his family and his father provided carefully for him, buying him the manor and estate of Lexden, close to Colchester, about 1612, and on his death in 1625 dividing his own estate between his wife, Elizabeth, and his sons Thomas Lucas, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/51215/', "John Lucas")</script>, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17123/', "Charles Lucas")</script>. Thomas's brother John secured the reversion of his barony (1645) first to his legitimate brother Charles but after him to Thomas and his heirs. The career of the younger Thomas exemplifies the way in which many pre-civil war Englishmen pursued military careers on the continent and later formed a professional nucleus in the armies of both sides in the civil war.<br>
<br>Lucas matriculated at Pembroke College, Cambridge, at Easter 1615. He was probably in the Low Countries as early as 1625; in 1637 he commanded a troop of horse there. He was knighted on 14 April 1628 at Whitehall and on 27 January 1629 married Anne Byron (<i>b</i>. 1612/13, <i>d</i>. in or after July 1653), the daughter of Sir John Byron; he was thirty-one and she was sixteen. In the 1630s he was involved in a dispute with the undertakers engaged in piping water to Colchester, claiming that the disorderly patrons of the alehouse at the waterworks damaged his warren. In 1639 the privy council decided in his favour, but relations between the Lucases and the town corporation remained uneasy, and the dispute may partly account for the plundering of Sir Thomas's records in the popular violence that erupted in Colchester in August 1642. With the approach of the Scottish war he was, with his brother Charles, among those &#145;elected&#146; to serve the king  (NL Wales, MS Chirk, fol. 7442). In December 1638 Lord Deputy Wentworth recommended that he be given command of a troop to march in Ireland, with the intention of gaining him to the king's service, an indication that his support was held to be worth winning.<br>
<br>Early in 1640 Lucas was trying to extricate himself from his command of a troop in the Low Countries and was also, in London and the Netherlands, engaged in inspecting and procuring equipment for war in Scotland. In February he was appointed commissary-general of horse in Ireland at a fee of 20<i>s</i>. per day, with an additional 10<i>s</i>. per day if employed in the king's wars. He commanded a regiment in Yorkshire in July 1640, but the main theatre of his service to the king was in Ireland. He was present at the battle of Kilrush on 15 April 1642 and was badly wounded at Ross on 18 March 1643. He was a member of the Irish privy council, and participated in negotiations for the cessation of 1643 and the treaty of 1646. He had returned to England by October 1646 with members of the committee of both kingdoms, to whom he had personally applied for consideration. In February 1647 he compounded for delinquency. In March his fine was set, at one-tenth, at &pound;1194; in May 1648, after he demonstrated that he had only a life interest in his estate, he was assessed at &pound;800, and finally in September 1648 his fine was set at &pound;637. The date of the last reduction suggests that he was not implicated in the second civil war. However, the sequestration of his estate imposed in May 1647 was not discharged until 19 October 1649, after Sir Thomas's death. His sister, Margaret, duchess of Newcastle, believed that his life had been shortened by a severe head wound which he had suffered in Ireland.<br>
