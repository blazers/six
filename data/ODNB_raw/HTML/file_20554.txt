<span class="headword">O'Donnell,  Hugh</span> <span class="st"> [Aodh &Oacute;'D&oacute;naill; <em>known as </em>Red Hugh, Hugh Roe, Aodh Rua]</span>, lord of Tyrconnell  (1572&#150;1602), <span class="occ">chieftain and rebel</span>, was born on or about 20 October 1572, the eldest son of Sir Hugh O'Donnell, lord of Tyrconnell (<i>b</i>. in or before 1535, <i>d</i>. 1600), Irish chieftain, and his second wife, Fionnuala, called In&iacute;on Dhubh 
    (Dark Girl; <i>d</i>. 1611?)
  , daughter of James MacDonnell of the Isles. His grandfather was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20556/', "Manus O'Donnell, lord of Tyrconnell")</script>, and his uncle was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20550/', "Calvagh O'Donnell, lord of Tyrconnell")</script>. Among his many siblings were his half-sister Siobhan (<i>d</i>. 1591), who in 1574 married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20775/', "Hugh O'Neill, third baron of Dungannon and second earl of Tyrone")</script>; his elder sister Nuala, who married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20558/', "Niall Garbh O'Donnell")</script>; and his brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20559/', "Rury O'Donnell, first earl of Tyrconnell")</script>. Hugh Roe was fostered in various chiefly households and his foray into O'Rourke country at the age of twelve was an exploit precocious enough to be recorded by the annalist of Loch C&eacute;.<h2>
<a name="Earlycareer15851593"></a>Early career, 1585&#150;1593</h2>Tyrconnell was at this time under threat from both increasing governmental pressure and fierce internal rivalry. This rivalry, begun in the 1540s between Calvagh and Hugh, sons of Manus O'Donnell, and maintained by their respective families, allowed the government (which favoured Calvagh and then his son Conn) in 1543 and again in 1566 in effect to partition the lordship. Thereafter the rich lands of Cin&eacute;al Moain, extending along the west bank of the Foyle and the Finn, with Lifford and Finn castles, were in contention between the two houses. Sir John Perrot, governor of Ireland, suspected Sir Hugh O'Donnell's loyalty and moved to reduce his power. He shired Tyrconnell in 1585, rejected Sir Hugh's claim to lordship over Sligo, and gave four of his castles to Hugh, son of Dean O'Gallagher, reputed to be Calvagh O'Donnell's illegitimate son, who disputed Sir Hugh's right to the lordship of Tyrconnell. In 1587, after Sir Hugh had failed to give sufficient demonstrations of his loyalty, Perrot sent a ship to Tyrconnell, with the design, apparently sanctioned by Elizabeth I, of kidnapping Sir Hugh, his wife, and Hugh Roe. At Rathmullan the <i>Mathew</i> secured Hugh Roe and some companions, who by late September 1587 were in close confinement in Dublin Castle, probably in one of the gate towers. To add to Tyrconnell's woes, at the end of 1588 the new lord deputy Sir William Fitzwilliam appointed Donal, Hugh Roe's half-brother, as sheriff of Tyrconnell. At the same time both the MacSweeneys of Banagh and the O'Boyles were locked in internecine strife. Tyrone, calling Hugh Roe his son-in-law, pleaded with Sir Francis Walsingham and Lord Leicester that only this youth could restore peace to Tyrconnell. The &#145;match&#146; between Hugh Roe and Tyrone's daughter was still spoken of as late as 1595, but apparently he never married. Sir Hugh brought thirty Spanish armada survivors to Dublin, but Perrot, then on the privy council, blocked Hugh Roe's release. In January 1591 he attempted escape; recaptured, he was put in irons and incarcerated in the Record Tower. In a second attempt, on 5 January 1592, assisted by Tyrone's outlay of largess, he escaped to Wicklow, where eventually Fiach MacHugh O'Byrne and Felim O'Toole came to his rescue. He suffered grievously from exposure in the mountains, his companion in flight Art O'Neill, son of Shane O'Neill, perishing there. The resourceful Turlough Bu&iacute; O'Hagan, Tyrone's confidential servant, conducted him to the north and, helped on his way by Sir Edward Moore, Tyrone, and Hugh Maguire, he came at last to the safety of Ballyshannon Castle. During his incarceration his indomitable mother arranged the murder of two of his rivals, Hugh O'Gallagher (<i>d</i>. 1588) and her stepson, Donal the sheriff. Donal, however, was replaced by Captain Willis who, with his undisciplined soldiery, oppressed all south-west Tyrconnell.<br>
<br>Hugh Roe was ill for over a year and the surgeon had to amputate his two big toes, but in February 1592 he expelled Willis. At Kilmacrenan on 24 April Sir Hugh stepped down and Hugh Roe was elected and inaugurated O'Donnell. The redoubtable Hugh MacHugh Dubh, the tanist, had the superior claim, but Hugh Roe was not to be denied. Dunlop in the <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span> echoes Fitzwilliam's belief that Hugh Roe's &#145;party were filled with joy&#146; at the realization of a prophecy of succession by Hugh O'Donnell to his father Hugh, but this lacks verification. He formally, though with little sincerity, submitted to the queen in August at Dundalk, thus securing the capitulation of his domestic enemies, Hugh MacHugh and Niall Garbh. Sir John O'Doherty he imprisoned. Before the end of 1592 he was master of Tyrconnell, to which, according to &Oacute; Cl&eacute;righ, he restored tranquillity. His attacks on Turlough Luineach O'Neill at Strabane in 1592 and 1593 were meant to strengthen his ally Tyrone's position in the O'Neill clan.<br>
<br>These were O'Donnell's first steps in his design of a national struggle, to be supported by Spain, against England. In all Ireland, only Ulster at this time maintained any real independence of the crown. Even within Ulster, Cavan and Monaghan had seen the introduction of English tenure and primogeniture, while the groundwork for this had been laid in Tyrconnell and Fermanagh. It seemed inevitable that the jurisdiction of O'Donnell, Maguire, and even Tyrone would be supplanted by that of crown sheriffs (of whom the odious Willis was typical) and Irish law and custom would yield to crown law. The northern bishops, led by Primate Magauran and Archbishop O'Hely of Tuam, had already sounded out Philip II and in 1592 confederated with the new O'Donnell, his cousin Hugh Maguire of Fermanagh, Brian O'Rourke, and some of the Mayo Burkes to form a Catholic league. O'Donnell was a realist, not a dreamer, and planned to extend the league beyond Ulster and northern Connaught into Leinster and Munster, so as to include Fiach Mac Hugh O'Byrne and the exiled claimants to the Baltinglass, Offaly, and Desmond titles. In April 1593 the two archbishops and O'Donnell put it to Philip that Spanish aid to Ireland would be an effective counter to England's support of the rebel Dutch. Philip, however, was noncommittal.<h2>
<a name="WaragainsttheEnglish15931601"></a>War against the English, 1593&#150;1601</h2>Urged on by O'Donnell, Maguire was the first to revolt in 1593. Suffering a reverse at Tulsk (where Primate Magauran was killed), he went on to raid Monaghan and had the aid of O'Donnell and O'Rourke in investing Enniskillen in 1594. By 1595 Tyrone was also openly committed to the league and took a leading role in the Nine Years' War. The declared demands of the confederates were liberty of conscience, withdrawal of sheriffs and garrisons outside Newry and Carrickfergus, and full pardon. O'Donnell, Tyrone, and Maguire maintained a war of attrition against the English while they perfected their military machine, sought alliance from elsewhere in Ireland and especially from Munster, and awaited Spanish aid. They defended Ulster along a line from the River Erne to Lough Neagh, O'Donnell maintaining the defence of the western side. From Tyrconnell there were two passages into Connaught, one over the Erne by Ballyshannon, the other by Enniskillen between the lakes. O'Donnell held Ballyshannon, the &#145;key of the province&#146; of Ulster  (<span class="italic">CSP Ire.</span>, <i>1596&#150;7</i>, 333&#150;4), and in 1595 Maguire recovered Enniskillen. Ulick Burke killed George Bingham, governor of Sligo, who had sacked the Carmelite monastery at Rathmullan and plundered Tory Island, and delivered Sligo Castle to O'Donnell, who levelled it and other castles in north Connaught. From Enniskillen and Ballyshannon he now controlled north Connaught. From 1595 he and his lightly armed, mobile forces made repeated forays into Connaught, weakening English power there. He set up Tibbot Burke as Mac William and in this same year assisted Tyrone to hold the Blackwater line.<br>
<br>Protracted negotiations begun in autumn 1595 led to pardons for Tyrone and O'Donnell in 1596. Meanwhile, however, these leaders were entertaining missions from Philip II and offering the crown of Ireland to Archduke Albert. O'Donnell laid in provisions for the expected Spanish expedition, but Padilla's fleet was destroyed by October gales off Viana. In July 1597, while Lord Deputy Burgh marched against Tyrone, Sir Conyers Clifford attacked Ballyshannon. O'Donnell, by continuous sorties with horse and foot, made the governor's position untenable and demonstrated that here was a leader who had advanced far beyond the traditional hit-and-run methods of Irish warfare. Clifford, learning of Burgh's repulse by Tyrone at the Blackwater and of the approach of Irish reinforcements, abandoned the attack. O'Donnell harried him as he crossed the Erne and in a hot pursuit for 15 miles killed many of his men.<br>
<br>O'Donnell's success in Connaught, was such that at the battle at Yellow Ford on 14 August 1598, when he commanded the left wing, he had 1000 Connaught men among his troops. The Irish here won a famous victory. Then, while Tyrone went on the offensive in Leinster and Munster, in order to keep the way open should the anticipated Spanish army land in the south, O'Donnell with the same purpose led a great army into Connaught, again set up his Mac William, seized Ballymote Castle, raided Clanricarde and even Thomond's county of Clare, and took immense booty. By this time the confederates sought free and open profession of &#145;the Catholic, Apostolic and Roman religion&#146;  (Maxwell, 182&#150;3), confirmation to Tyrone, O'Donnell, and Desmond of all the lands and privileges enjoyed by their predecessors for 200 years past, and that all officers of state (apart from the viceroy) and churchmen should be Irish. But Clifford, urged on by the earl of Essex, made a determined land and sea attack on Sligo. O'Donnell dispatched a force of 400 men to defend the castle from Tibbot na Long's naval attack, another of 200 horse to keep O'Connor Sligo in Collooney Castle, and himself ambushed Clifford at Bellaghboy Pass in the Curlew Hills. On 5 August 1599 the governor's army was repulsed with great loss, Clifford himself being among the dead, a notable victory over an experienced leader in command of veterans. O'Connor Sligo surrendered Collooney Castle to O'Donnell, who had both repulsed attacks on himself and made any assault on Tyrone's defensive line from the Blackwater to Armagh and even to Monaghan much more hazardous. In June 1600 he drove as far south as Loop Head and in Moylurg turned Clanricarde back from another attempt on Sligo.<br>
<br>The new Spanish king, Philip III, sent envoys and some arms to Tyrconnell in 1599 and again in 1600. But in O'Donnell's absence in Connaught, Sir Henry Docwra landed an army at Lough Foyle in May 1600. O'Donnell at first discounted the threat, but Docwra won over Sir Art O'Neill, Turlough Luineach's son, and, more importantly, Niall Garbh, who meant to displace Hugh as O'Donnell, and it was he who ensured Docwra's success. Over the following year Docwra seized Rathmullan Carmelite friary while Niall Garbh gained Lifford and Donegal Franciscan friary. In fighting against Niall Garbh the valiant Manus, younger brother of O'Donnell, received a mortal wound.<br>
<br>In October 1601 O'Donnell, informed that the Spanish had landed at last in far-away Kinsale, but with too small a force to take the offensive (both O'Donnell and Tyrone had strongly advised that so small a force, 4000 men, should come at least as far north as Limerick), abandoned his siege of Donegal, and assembled his forces for a demanding winter march to the south. It was a desperate throw, for it left Ballyshannon open to English conquest. He left Ballymote on 2 November and exactly a month later eluded Sir George Carew in his memorable night march of 32 Irish miles over frozen Slieve Felim, &#145;the greatest march with carriage&#146;, acknowledged Carew, &#145;that hath been heard of&#146;  (Silke, &#145;Red Hugh&#146;, 12). By 2 December he had arrived in Bandon, gathering southern reinforcements as he went. A few days later Tyrone joined him. They had transported their armies and carriage by winter over or through fifty swollen rivers and besieged Lord Deputy Mountjoy as he invested Kinsale.<h2>
<a name="Defeatexileanddeath16011602"></a>Defeat, exile, and death, 1601&#150;1602</h2>Stout Spanish resistance and the news of the Irish arrival made Mountjoy give up his intention of an assault in force. Meanwhile General Zubiaur landed at Castlehaven with some reinforcements, gaining also Baltimore and Bantry harbours. The west Munster lords, MacCarthys, O'Driscolls, and O'Sullivan Beare, declared for Spain. Mountjoy drew his investment tighter, but of his 11,500 foot and 900 horse, many died of exposure. The Irish armies numbered perhaps 6000 infantry and 800 horse, while the Spanish commander &Aacute;guila claimed only 2500 effective fighters. Tyrone planned, if reinforced by Zubiaur's men, to force a breakthrough to &Aacute;guila; Zubiaur, however, sent only 200 Spaniards, although the O'Sullivans brought 1200 Irish. &Aacute;guila encouraged the Irish to rendezvous with him for a joint attack. Tyrone, realizing that the Irish, despite his and O'Donnell's notable successes, would be at a disadvantage in attacking the entrenched English, preferred to harry Mountjoy and let disease and famine do their work on the latter's army, but O'Donnell's voice for attack prevailed, and so the Irish moved up to Belgooly. At the sight of them Mountjoy exclaimed, &#145;This kingdom is lost today&#146;  (Archivo General de Simancas, guerra antigua 3144). Early on 24 December, while it was still dark, the Irish set out, Captain Tyrrell with his Meath and Leinster men leading the van, Tyrone the main force, and O'Donnell with his Tyrconnell and Connaught men in the rear. &Aacute;guila planned to join them between Thomond's camp and the west fort but things went disastrously wrong as old rivalries re-emerged. &#145;Their chiefs were at variance, each of them contending that he himself should go foremost&#146;  (AFM, 6.2283). The battalions marched out shoulder to shoulder instead of in order. In the dark they lost contact and went astray. Tyrrell did not find the agreed position, and &Aacute;guila stayed in the town. At dawn Tyrone, observing this, withdrew. Mountjoy, seeing his opportunity, launched a cavalry charge against Tyrone; it was repulsed, but a second broke his army. &Aacute;guila, although he heard musketry fire, refused to lead out his men. Tyrrell came up but was made to retreat. O'Donnell's men, even further off, at sight of the two other battalions being routed ignored his exhortations to turn and fight, and fled. A pursuit of Tyrone accounted for between 500 and 1000 casualties in the main battle. A volley at the end made Don Juan stir but, realizing that it signalled an English victory, he quickly retreated. O'Donnell succeeded, but too late, in rallying his men on a hill 8 miles away.<br>
<br>O'Donnell, urging Tyrone and his brother Rury, to whom he entrusted his own command, to remain encamped, then sailed from Castlehaven to seek Spanish reinforcements. But Tyrone went home, suffering many more losses on the way, although Rury then brought his army safely to Connaught. O'Donnell was welcomed to Corunna by Governor Caracena and Philip III ordered the immediate dispatch of a relief squadron to be sent to Castlehaven, Baltimore, and Berehaven, to be followed up by a fresh army, 6000 strong. News of &Aacute;guila's surrender, however, and the return from Kinsale on 26 and 27 February 1602 of twenty Spanish companies halted the preparations. These returning soldiers blamed O'Donnell for the rout and the king resolved to give him 50,000 ducats and send him back to Ireland. Then, however, opinion against him hardened; permission for him to leave was refused and he remained a virtual prisoner in Corunna.<br>
<br>At last in August, O'Donnell was allowed to leave Corunna for the court at Valladolid. Reaching Simancas Castle, he took to his bed and after seventeen days' illness died on 30 August 1602. He probably was not poisoned by one James Blake of Galway, as was once thought. According to Donagh Mooney, a soldier turned friar who knew O'Donnell well, he succumbed to grief and the rigours of the Castilian climate. Among those present at his bedside were Florence Conry, his confessor; Matthew Tully, his secretary; and Dr John Nynan. In his will, drawn up shortly before his death, he named Rury heir to all his &#145;estates, lands, lordships, and vassals&#146;  (Silke, &#145;The last will&#146;, 58) and asked that Philip III should apportion any help equally between Tyrone and Rury and hold them and their heirs in equal regard. He was buried in the Franciscan convent of Valladolid. When this was later secularized, his body was disinterred and its present location is unknown.<br>
<br>Mooney left a pen-portrait characterizing O'Donnell as a prince and leader:<blockquote>He was above middle height, strong, handsome, well-built and of pleasing appearance. His voice was musical. In action he was quick and decisive. He loved justice and was stern with evildoers. He was resolute, faithful to his word and steadfast in time of trial. Maintaining a rigorous military discipline, he led by example in battle. To all he was courteous and affable. He was not married. He was gracious, without pretension. (Mooney, 116)</blockquote>Mooney went on to speak of O'Donnell's zeal for the restoration of the Catholic faith, his anxiety for a worthy clergy, and his contempt for the world. He had often heard him say that if the war ended favourably he would become a Franciscan. However, this description is perhaps not wholly derived from life because Mooney was drawing here from work by Polydore Vergil.<br>
<br>O'Donnell spent ten years fighting to maintain what he claimed as his by right of inauguration, maintained a firm alliance with Tyrone, carried the war to the rest of Ireland, drew in the Spaniards, and made the conflict one of national, international, and religious significance. Then, with the balance poised, submerged rivalries within the alliance resurfaced, his luck ran out, and the way was open for completion of the English conquest of Ireland.<br>
