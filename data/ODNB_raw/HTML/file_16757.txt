<span class="headword">Lisle,  Samuel</span>  (1683&#150;1749), <span class="occ">bishop of St Asaph and of Norwich</span>, was born in Blandford, Dorset, the son of Richard Lisle, a landowner. He was educated first at the grammar school in Blandford, which he entered about 1688, and then at Salisbury grammar school under the eminent teacher Edward Hardwick. On 4 March 1700 he entered Wadham College, Oxford. Having been elected to a scholarship in 1701, he graduated BA in 1703 and proceeded MA in 1706. He was elected to a Goodridge scholarship and a fellowship of Wadham in 1707. In 1710 he became chaplain to the Levant Company in Smyrna, and in 1716 he accepted a similar chaplaincy at Aleppo, Syria. During this time he visited Constantinople and much of Asia Minor and mastered a number of oriental languages. In 1728 Lisle was to contribute some inscriptions to Edmund Chishull's <span class="italic">Antiquitates Asiaticae</span>. After returning to England in 1719 he was appointed bursar of Wadham. In 1720 he was appointed chaplain to Lord Onslow and thereafter he quickly accumulated the rectories of Holwell in Bedfordshire, Tooting in Surrey, and St Mary le Bow, London. Technically he held the last position while an incumbent also of the ancient London livings of St Pancras, Soper Lane, and All Hallows, Honey Lane.<br>
<br>In 1721 Lisle was created a Lambeth DD by Archbishop Wake, who also appointed him his domestic chaplain. Lisle attracted much patronage from Wake: in 1724 he was appointed archdeacon of Canterbury; in 1726 he became rector of Fetcham, Surrey; in 1728 he was appointed to a canonry of Canterbury; and in 1729 he became vicar of Northolt. Although he was among those members of the chapter censured for poor residence at the cathedral, he was also a member of a corps of able and energetic administrators who helped Archbishop Wake superintend his diocese. His high standing among the clergy was affirmed by his election as deputy prolocutor in the lower house of convocation in 1726 and as prolocutor in 1734. As prolocutor he preached a sermon entitled <span class="italic">Concio ad synodum</span> at the commencement of the convocation.<br>
<br>Lisle's character and integrity were such that he was chosen to succeed Robert Thistlethwayte in 1738 when the latter fled the country and abandoned the wardenship of Wadham in the wake of a homosexual scandal. Lisle, it was felt, would repair the college's reputation; by way of reward he was awarded a BD and DD by diploma on 10 April 1739.<br>
<br>In 1737 Lisle had refused the poorly endowed bishopric of Oxford, having been denied commendams which would have enabled him to have sufficient income. In 1744 he accepted appointment to the see of St Asaph, and on 1 April he was consecrated at Lambeth; he retained the archdeaconry of Canterbury and vicarage of Northolt <i>in commendam</i> with the bishopric. When, in 1748, he asked to be translated to the vacant see of Norwich, he was permitted it on the grounds of his age and labours in north Wales. He was to hold the bishopric for just eighteen months.<br>
<br>Though he was a regular attender in the House of Lords Lisle was not an actively political bishop; he rarely spoke or voted. In 1748 he was, however, active, with Bishop Sherlock and Archbishop Herring, in discussions with Samuel Chandler to achieve a comprehension of dissenters within the Church of England, and while they reached agreements over matters of doctrine, their divisions over oaths and reordination prevented any union.<br>
<br>Lisle died, apparently unmarried, in Lisle Street, Leicester Fields, London, on 3 October 1749, and was buried in the churchyard of his former parish of Northolt. His will directed that his papers, including his manuscript notes of his journeys in Asia Minor, be burnt by his executor.<br>
