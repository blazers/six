<span class="headword">Andrews,  William</span>  (1835&#150;1914), <span class="occ">industrial designer, entrepreneur, and politician</span>, was born in Coventry on 17 March 1835, the only son of three children of James and Isabella Andrews. His father was a Scot, a former regular soldier, and small businessman of Coventry. Andrews attended Mr Mander's day school, studying mathematics, astronomy, and land surveying. He was apprenticed in 1848 to Messrs Bray in the designing department. Continuing his studies at the Coventry Schools of Art and Design, he won national prizes including visits to the Great Exhibition of 1851 and the Paris Exhibition of 1855. He was appointed manager by Messrs Cash and showed skill in design. As a buyer, he resisted the demands of workers for a price list which would guarantee skilled workers a fair wage in the silk industry.<br>
<br>During the slump and strike of 1860, which followed the Cobden trade treaty, Andrews went abroad to gather information about the designs and work practices of continental competitors. He worked mainly in Basel, in Switzerland, overcoming initial suspicion about his motives and supplementing his income by teaching English. He travelled the alpine regions mainly on foot, gaining an extensive knowledge of the terrain and the people and improving his linguistic skills in French, German, and Italian. He returned to Coventry in December 1861 with a cosmopolitan outlook and information on modern design and technical improvements in the silk industry, including the power loom. He subsequently maintained that only the ruthless efficiency of the factory system could save the industry.<br>
<br>Andrews began business on his own account in 1866, using his own capital and his London and continental contacts. Thomas Burbidge joined him, and was a partner 1868&#150;74. Andrews never married, but lived with his sister and her daughter. He was president of the chamber of commerce 1876&#150;7, when a new trade treaty was being negotiated with France, and took part in a delegation of silk manufacturers in their representations to the government. In 1890 he gave up the business, declaring it solvent but unprofitable.<br>
<br>During a comfortable retirement of twenty-four years, Andrews supported the tory party, opposing Chamberlain's Unionists as too radical. He served on Coventry council 1877&#150;95. After local government reorganization, and standing as an independent candidate, Andrews topped the local election poll in 1890, the other five successful candidates being Liberals. Forthright and amusing, his campaign for efficiency was seen as beneficial and economical by the people. He saved public money by the reorganization of the city's debts, and campaigned successfully for a better water supply, irrigation, and sewage, and for the installation of gas supply and road widening. He used his knowledge of geology, archaeology, and natural habitat to modernize a medieval city handicapped by its past. To the fury of his opponents, his criticism of a new and expensive water supply as open to contamination was vindicated. He was refused office as alderman and magistrate until 1896 by the Liberals. Although he was later offered the office of mayor, he declined it. His support for gas rather than electricity and his opposition to government-funded technical education was regarded as regressive.<br>
<br>In youth a Congregationalist, Andrews returned to Anglicanism and organized the restoration of the bells and steeple of St Michael's (later Coventry Cathedral). In laying the foundation-stone (1886) he evinced unusual idealism. A fellow of the Geological Society, Andrews contributed numerous articles on historical, archaeological, and geological topics to Coventry newspapers and the <span class="italic">Journal of the Warwickshire Naturalists and Archaeologists Field Club</span>, of which he was president 1901&#150;4. These included &#145;Medieval Coventry&#146;, &#145;Ancient earth-works&#146;, &#145;The ribbon trade and French treaties&#146;, &#145;Coal in north east Warwickshire&#146;, and &#145;Chalky boulder clay in central Warwickshire&#146;. His skill as a photographer was recognized when examples of his work were exhibited at the Paris Exhibition of 1890 at the request of the Department of Science and Art. In 1894 he served as General Municipal Charities trustee. Andrews died on 14 May 1914 at his home, Steeplecroft, Daventry Road, Coventry, and was buried at St Michael's. He was regarded as an honest, if unfeeling, master, magistrate, and politician, who used his considerable intelligence and skills to benefit the people of Coventry in an age of improvement.<br>
