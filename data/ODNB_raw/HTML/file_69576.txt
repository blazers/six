<span class="headword">Shepherd,  Charles William Haimes</span>  (1917&#150;1998), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, was born on 10 December 1917 at 23 Richmond Street, Plymouth, Devon, the son of William Henry Haimes Shepherd, labourer in the naval dockyard, and his wife, Florence Ethel Hayter. He was a pupil at the Public Central School, Plymouth, and entered the Royal Navy in 1933 as an engineering artificer apprentice at HMS <i>Fisgard</i>, the naval school at Torpoint. On passing out top of his class he went to sea in the engine room of HMS <i>Repulse</i>.<br>
<br>Shepherd saw action at the second battle of Narvik on 13 April 1940 while temporarily assigned to HMS <i>Hero</i>. Commissioned a sub-lieutenant (E) in July 1940, he studied at the Royal Naval College, Greenwich, and qualified as an advanced engineer soon after his marriage to the 22-year-old Myra Betty Joan Major (1917/18&#150;1988) on 9 November 1940. They had a son. Lieutenant Shepherd served in the battleship HMS <i>Royal Sovereign</i> (1941&#150;4) and the cruiser HMS <i>Gambia</i> (1944&#150;5) before joining the staff of the commander-in-chief, Pacific, in Sydney, Australia.<br>
<br>To his initial dismay, Shepherd was designated a project officer with research and development, guided weapons, at Farnborough in 1946. This determined the subsequent course of his career, apart from one last tour at sea as a lieutenant-commander with the 3rd training flotilla (1949&#150;51). He learned much about solid fuel technology while working on the Sea Slug surface-to-air missile and, raised to commander (1952), was trials liaison officer on HMS <i>Girdle Ness</i>, the ship adapted to test it. Although an effective weapon, the Sea Slug came into service four years late in 1961, being so much larger than first planned that only eight purpose-built destroyers ever carried it. This experience left Shepherd with decided views about what to avoid when managing a weapons programme.<br>
<br>Promoted captain on 31 December 1960, Shepherd completed the senior officers' war course (1961&#150;2) and became deputy director of naval intelligence (technical) at the Admiralty. Information exchange projects took him to the USA to study how the American navy was developing a new nuclear submarine armed with ballistic missiles (a craft known as the SSBN: submarine submersible ballistic nuclear). Consequently he well appreciated the implications of the unexpected upheaval in British nuclear defence policy which occurred in December 1962. Hitherto Britain's nuclear deterrent had depended for its delivery on the V-bombers of the Royal Air Force. The Macmillan government, on abandoning Blue Streak (the proposed British medium-range missile), had arranged in 1960 to purchase Skybolt air-to-surface missiles from the USA to convey British nuclear warheads. Now, however, the USA was cancelling Skybolt, and the alternative&#151;hastily secured by Macmillan via the Nassau agreement&#151;was Polaris, a submarine-launched missile. Rather to its own consternation, the Royal Navy was required to procure SSBNs and assume full nuclear capability by 1968.<br>
<br>Shepherd accompanied the Begg&#150;Zuckerman mission to Washington in January 1963 for the first round of Polaris planning talks. Then on 6 February he joined the technical directorate of the new Polaris executive as the deputy director, weapons (Polaris). This meant that he was working under the chief Polaris executive (Rear-Admiral Hugh (Rufus) Mackenzie) and the technical director, Polaris (Rowland Baker), and alongside the deputy director, naval construction (S. J. Palmer). While Palmer designed the submarines, Shepherd took responsibility for procuring, installing, proving, and servicing the Polaris weapon system (and torpedoes for self-defence). This was a challenging task, for, though the missiles would come from the USA, the warheads and re-entry system were to be made in Britain: technical integration had to be perfect. The navy, moreover, did not have experience of nuclear weapons, so a whole new training scheme was needed.<br>
<br>In his quest for suitable staff Captain Shepherd drew a large proportion of naval missile engineers and ordnance specialists into the technical directorate (Polaris) based at Bath&#151;often to the chagrin of other divisions of the Admiralty. &#145;Turf wars&#146; were inevitably a feature of the project; Shepherd fought them with zeal, asserting his claims against those of the director-general, weapons, and the Polaris project office attached to the Ministry of Aviation. A blunt-speaking man, not worried about making enemies, he compared these episodes to fisticuffs in the schoolyard and despised the &#145;great British compromise&#146;. Whenever the five-year timetable &#145;Longcast 63&#146; showed signs of slipping, his ire would descend on the Atomic Weapons Research Establishment, the Royal Ordnance Factory, Burghfield, and the civil contractors (Vickers, Cammell Laird, GEC, and the British Aircraft Corporation). The secret of punctual completion lay in keeping divergencies from the American system to a minimum. Shepherd prided himself on the suppression of &#145;WIBBIs&#146;: &#145;Wouldn't it be better if &hellip;?&#146;<br>
<br>For seven years the deputy director, weapons (Polaris), took no leave. He often worked from 7.30 a.m. to 10 p.m. seven days a week and expected staff to follow his example, though bluff humour marginally tempered his regime. Shepherd saw this &#145;crackpot&#146; dedication rewarded when the first British SSBN, HMS <i>Resolution</i>, test-fired an A3 Polaris missile off Florida at 11.15 hours on 15 February 1968 (as scheduled five years earlier). It amused him to grumble that the launch was fifteen thousandths of a second late; everyone else extolled a singular achievement: Polaris had been delivered on time and within budget. <i>Resolution</i> began operational patrols on 15 June 1968.<br>
<br>Shepherd, appointed CBE, led the technical directorate (Polaris) from 1968 to 1971 with the new title of director project teams (submarines) and deputy assistant controller, Polaris. He dealt with the commissioning of the fourth SSBN, HMS <i>Revenge</i>, and drew up the refit procedures for <i>Resolution</i>, <i>Repulse</i>, and <i>Renown</i>. His rank advanced to rear-admiral in 1970, before he assumed command of Britain's nuclear forces as the deputy controller of the navy, Polaris (1971&#150;3). Thickset, bald, and bespectacled, he retired in 1974 and returned to Plymouth, where he lived at 5 Underhill Road, Stoke. Yachting and watching rugby were his hobbies.<br>
<br>Charles Shepherd, a key figure in the most successful British peacetime weapon procurement project of the century, died of a stroke on 24 February 1998 at Underhill House residential home, 12 Underhill Road, Stoke, Plymouth, Devon.<br>
