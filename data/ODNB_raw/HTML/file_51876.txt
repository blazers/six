<span class="headword">Denny,  Peter</span>  (1821&#150;1895), <span class="occ">shipbuilder and shipowner</span>, was born in Dumbarton on 25 October 1821, the fifth son of William Denny (1779&#150;1833) and his wife, Christeanne, formerly McIntyre. The Denny family had been involved in boat-building in the town since at least the mid-eighteenth century and were then engaged in developing steamships. Denny was apprenticed at first to a local lawyer and then at the Dumbarton glassworks. At the age of twenty-one he joined his brothers in the shipbuilding trade, gaining experience in bookkeeping in the counting house of Robert Napier &amp; Sons. When his brothers established their own shipbuilding firm at Dumbarton in 1844 he became a junior partner, using his commercial knowledge to organize the office. On 26 January 1846 he married Helen Leslie, with whom he had eight sons, including the shipbuilder and engineer <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32785/', "Sir Archibald Denny")</script>, and seven daughters.<br>
<br>In 1850 Denny went into partnership with two engineers, John McAusland and John Tulloch, to form the marine engineering business of Tulloch and Denny, to operate in parallel with, but independently of, the shipyard. His eldest brother, William, after whom the business was named, died four years later, leaving Peter virtually in sole charge as his other brother James had more or less withdrawn from the firm. Learning from Napiers, he saw the advantage of investing in shipping ventures to secure a market for the yard. At the time of the Disruption in the Church of Scotland in 1843, he had joined the Free Church of Scotland, which brought him in touch with the partners in the shipping firm of Paddy Henderson &amp; Co. He began to build ships for them and to take shares in their various ventures, including support for the Free Church colony on the south island of New Zealand. The business grew rapidly and in 1859 a new shipyard, the North yard, was acquired and the engine works extended. His brother James and John Tulloch retired in 1862; Peter Denny took sole charge of the shipyard, and the engine works was renamed Denny &amp; Co. An enlightened employer, he laid out at the same time a model factory village&#151;Dennistoun&#151;for the workforce of both businesses at a cost of almost &pound;3300. A completely new shipyard was constructed in 1866&#150;7. Despite his commercial background he served on the parliamentary committee on the design of warships in 1871 and on the royal commission on the loss of life and property at sea in 1876.<br>
<br>Using profits made from building blockade runners and speculating in Confederate bonds during the American Civil War, Denny began to invest very heavily with the Hendersons in new shipping companies, personally buying large blocks of shares in 1868 in the Albion Shipping Company and the Irrawaddy Flotilla Company. Building vessels for the latter, which provided services on the shallow winding Irrawaddy River in Burma, was a considerable technical challenge that demanded not only the development of special hull shapes but also lightly constructed engines with well-distributed weight. The firm's success in overcoming these obstacles yielded a flood of orders and profits from the flotilla company. Technical improvements, particularly in hull forms, along with the management of the yard and engine works were increasingly the responsibility of Peter's eldest son, <a name="cosubject_37353"></a><span class="headword">William Denny</span>  (1847&#150;1887)<span class="occ"></span>, who became a partner in 1868. Born on 25 May 1847, he was educated at St Helier's School in Jersey and the Royal High School in Edinburgh before serving an apprenticeship in the family firm. He continued his general education by reading widely, particularly on theological subjects, coming to dislike the repressive Calvinism of the Free Church of Scotland.<br>
<br>In 1870 William Denny began to experiment with piece-work for the iron trades in the yards to improve productivity, which was eventually extended to all the firm's trades. He also established an awards scheme&#151;the first of its kind in Britain&#151;to encourage members of the workforce to suggest improvements in working practices, methods, and equipment. At the same time he introduced progressive speed trials over a measured mile for all vessels built in the yards. This led to an interest in hull forms and contact with the well-known naval architect William Froude. Denny published many papers on this subject and on the techniques of construction. He designed revolutionary shallow-draught vessels for the Irrawaddy and other estuarial navigations and from 1876 pioneered steel shipbuilding, culminating in the construction of the <i>Rotomahana</i> (1879)&#151;the first ocean-going steel ship. To enhance even further the quality and efficiency of the firm's hull shapes, he persuaded his father to build the first commercial test tank in the world at Dumbarton in 1881, with assistance from Froude's son, superintendent of the Admiralty test tank in Torquay. This investment was part of a massive extension of the yard, which included a new wet dock, longer berths, and heavier cranes. Critical of Lloyd's rules for the construction of iron steamships, William Denny was appointed a member of the Board of Trade load-line committee in 1884.<br>
<br>By handing over much of the day-to-day management of the business to his son, Peter Denny had more time to devote to his other business interests and to winning custom for the yard. He became chairman or a director of twelve companies, mostly enterprises connected with the Henderson family, including Paddy Henderson itself, the Albion Steamship Company, the British and Burmese Steam Navigation Company, and Rio Tinto Mines, earning during his career over &pound;20,000 in fees. He cultivated orders from foreign governments, particularly Spain, Portugal, and Belgium, all of which honoured him for his services. He also willingly loaned money to local firms either to get them out of difficulty or to help them develop. Befitting his wealth and status he built an impressive home&#151;Helenslee, named after his wife&#151;overlooking the Clyde at Dumbarton, between 1866 and 1868. He gave large sums to charitable bodies such as Glasgow Western Infirmary and the Glasgow home for incurables, and, deeply committed to education, he established scholarships at Dumbarton schools and at the University of Glasgow. His services to education were recognized with the award of an LLD by the university in 1890.<br>
<br>In an attempt to repeat their success on the Irrawaddy, the Denny and the Henderson families took a large stake in La Platense Flotilla Company in 1882 to operate river steamers in Argentina and Uruguay. William Denny was appointed a director to represent the families' interests on the board. Repeatedly troubled with bouts of ill-health, put down to overwork, he suffered a breakdown in the autumn of 1882. Having returned home after a long convalescence on the continent, he and his wife were taken seriously ill with typhoid in 1883. During his recuperation his Dumbarton home, Bellfield, with its valuable library, was destroyed by fire, encouraging a morbid fascination with the medico-religious philosophy of James Hinton. Although he had already left the Free Church of Scotland in 1873 and joined the more liberal United Presbyterians, this did not prevent him from believing that he was destined to die young.<br>
<br>When he returned to the yard William Denny threw himself into work unsparingly. Determined to prevent stoppages and strikes, he pioneered a works council in 1884, first to discuss the charitable giving of the workforce but soon to negotiate new rules and to settle demarcation and other disputes before they became a problem. The rules, which unusually applied to the management as well as to the workforce, embraced the novel concept that all fines for infringements would be returned to the employees. The La Platense venture never lived up to its promise and was taken over in its entirety by the Dennys and Hendersons in 1885&#150;6. In the face of severe local competition, matters went from bad to worse. William Denny recommended that the local opposition should be bought out at the huge cost of &pound;720,000, a decision which proved ill-advised. Deeply troubled by this experience, he sailed for South America in June 1886 in an attempt to save the business. Conscience-stricken by the scale of the catastrophe, he committed suicide in Buenos Aires on 17 March 1887. He was survived by his wife, Lelia, eldest daughter of Leon Serena of Venice, with whom he had a son and three daughters. La Platense was wound up three years later at a total loss.<br>
<br>The effect of this tragedy on Peter Denny was devastating. Already more or less retired, he withdrew from the business. He died at Helenslee on 22 August 1895, leaving about &pound;200,000&#151;only a fraction of his net drawings during his career, which have been estimated at nearly &pound;1.5 million. His wife survived him and died on 5 March 1905.<br>
