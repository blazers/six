<span class="headword">Jones,  John Richard</span>  (1881&#150;1955), <span class="occ">builder and historian</span>, was born on 29 June 1881 at 29 Barrington Road, Wavertree, Liverpool, the son of John Jones (1853&#150;1936), a builder, and his wife, Catherine Parry (1855&#150;1887). His mother died on 30 March 1887 when J. R. Jones was only five years of age; but his father was a remarkable individual who brought up his sons to take responsibility at an early age, in particular within the Welsh Presbyterian chapel of Webster Road. From 1899 onwards John R. Jones shouldered every year some responsibility, beginning as secretary to the Sunday school, becoming involved in young people's activities, and acting as a temperance witness, until he himself was made an elder (like his father) in 1932. Both were heavily involved in the planning of a large new Welsh Presbyterian chapel on the border of Allerton and Wavertree overlooking Penny Lane, completed in 1927. For a short period of time both he and his father served together as elders, a rather unique situation, although his command of Welsh was not so fluent as that of his father (known in the trade as John Jones Drinkwater because he refused to allow the customary &#145;price of a pint&#146;, an honorarium given to bricklayers on completing the first house of a block. He would tell them to go and drink water).<br>
<br>Educated at Webster Road board school and Liverpool Institute, Jones became a bank clerk; but on 10 September 1912 he married Mary (<i>d</i>. 1974), the daughter of John Hughes of Wavertree, the successful Liverpool Welsh builder and partner of his father in the building firm of Jones and Hughes. His brother married Mary's sister. Shortly after his marriage Jones became an estate agent and a property owner, becoming in time vice-president of the Liverpool Property Owners Federation. On 11 December 1913 their only daughter, Mair, was born. In June 1917 he joined the French Transport Company and saw service to 1919 in France, and was awarded for bravery the Croix de Guerre. It was this war experience that explains why a leading free churchman had life membership of the Territorial Army rifle association.<br>
<br>After the war Jones became very involved in the life of Liverpool and Wales. As a Liberal politician he represented Wavertree on the city council (1936&#150;7 and 1942&#150;5). He became president of the Wavertree constituency Liberal Party, and served as honorary treasurer. His interests were wide. In June 1935 he was appointed a justice of the peace, serving the Liverpool bench. In addition, he served as chairman of the Liverpool Welsh Choral Union, executive member of the Liverpool National Society, and was heavily involved in the committees of the Liverpool presbytery. Jones served as chairman of the Undeb Cymry Fydd Glannau Mersi (Merseyside new Wales union) and the Young Wales Club with its premises in Upper Parliament Street. In 1932 he was a founder member of the Cylch XXV (Liverpool club), composed of up to twenty-five leaders of Welsh life, which came together monthly to discuss in Welsh subjects to do with Wales and the Liverpool area. He was behind the formation of a Welsh luncheon club that ceased in the early sixties, but the Cylch XXV continues to flourish long after his death.<br>
<br>Jones maintained his links with Wales, for he had a second residence in Anglesey, and in 1940&#150;41 he was high sheriff of the county. He gave generously to Anglesey-based institutions such as the annual eisteddfod, and supported the Anglesey Antiquarian Society and the National Society for the Preservation of Rural Wales. He also gave generously and was influential in the Undeb Cymry Fydd (New Wales Union) and the Urdd Gobaith Cymru (Welsh League of Youth), and was elected its vice-president in 1945. His lasting contribution must be his only book, <span class="italic">The Welsh Builder on Merseyside: Annals and Lives</span>, published by himself in 1946. The proceeds from the book were given to the Royal Southern Hospital, of which he was a life governor. Many of the builders mentioned were obscure individuals, but through his family contacts he was able to gather together an amazing mass of detail. It is a good example of the work of an amateur historian, and he treasured his membership of the Cambrian Archaeological Association. Jones died suddenly at his home, Cintra, 109 Menlove Avenue, Liverpool, on 28 January 1955 and was buried in Allerton cemetery, Liverpool.<br>
