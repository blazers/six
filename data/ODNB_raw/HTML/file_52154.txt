<span class="headword">Portinari, Sir  Giovanni</span>  (<em>b. </em><em>c.</em>1502<span class="mult">x</span><em>c.</em>1508, <em>d.</em> in or after 1572), <span class="occ">military engineer</span>, was probably born in Florence, to unknown parents. By 1526 he was living in England, being recorded in that year as one of the king's gentlemen pensioners; he retained this position until at least 1547. He married an English wife, and letters of denization issued on 14 February 1537 granted him many of the privileges of English-born subjects. In the following year he was employed in the dissolution of the monasteries, being placed by Thomas Cromwell in charge of the destruction of Lewes Priory, Sussex, which had been granted to Cromwell himself. Portinari sent his employer a detailed description (written in Italian) of the abbey church, and the means used to pull it down. The only evidence for his own religious allegiance derives from a piece of Spanish intelligence dated 1572, which describes him as a &#145;great Catholic&#146;, and gives his age as seventy. However, a law suit from June of the same year identified him as being &#145;aged sixty-four years or thereabouts&#146;  (&#145;Blackfriars Records&#146;, 52).<br>
<br>As a member of the royal household Portinari was employed on a number of commissions between 1539 and 1547. In 1539, for instance, he was asked to interpret for a Florentine merchant who was imprisoned in the Tower, and in 1540 he attended the ceremony welcoming Anne of Cleves on her arrival in England. In 1544 he served at the siege of Boulogne, and in the following year he was appointed keeper of Sandown Castle on the Isle of Wight, a post that brought him an income of &pound;100 per annum. As a gentleman pensioner he attended the funeral of Henry VIII in 1547 and the coronation of Edward VI; he was also made superintendent of the tomb of Henry VIII, receiving an annual salary of &pound;24. His career in England was temporarily halted during Edward's reign when he was deprived of his keepership of Sandown Castle and superintendency of Henry VIII's tomb by the duke of Somerset. The loss of these offices, and of the income they brought, forced Portinari to seek employment in France, where he was evidently well respected. There he worked on the fortifications of Piedmont, for which he appears to have been generously paid. Yet Portinari was keen to move back to England&#151;by 1554 he was in contact with the English government soliciting employment. In a testimonial to Mary in 1554 he explained that he had been forced to work for the French government for financial reasons. He reiterated his loyalty to the English crown and hoped some employment might be found for him, especially as he feared that the French might send him to Scotland to serve against the English.<br>
<br>It was not until 1559, however, that Sir William Cecil began negotiations through Sir Nicholas Throckmorton to procure Portinari's service for Elizabeth I. He faced considerable competition from the French, who were unhappy about losing their engineer and offered to double Portinari's pension if he went to work for them in Scotland. Cecil's negotiations were ultimately successful, however, and Portinari arrived in England some time in 1560. It was probably about this time that he was knighted. Between March and April he arrived in Berwick, where he was employed intermittently until 1566.<br>
<br>The significance of Berwick lay in its strategic position on the Scottish&#150;English border, making it a common target for Scottish attacks; as a result the Elizabethan fortifications there were highly innovative, constituting one of the finest surviving examples of a fortress in the Italianate style, and cost ten times more than any other military building of the reign. Partly because of this, the works (devised and supervised by Sir Richard Lee) had come under considerable criticism by 1560. It was therefore decided that Lee's defences should be investigated by a specialist, namely Portinari. He not only criticized key parts of Lee's plans (including the dimensions of the bulwarks and the exposure of the base town) but also produced a series of counter-proposals. Lee evidently took offence&#151;when some of Portinari's plans disappeared from a locked coffer, Portinari implied that Lee had stolen them and was trying to discredit him. Portinari left Berwick in July but was to return in 1564, by when his differences with Lee had apparently been resolved. By then the Berwick works were again causing concern: while work was in progress, an entire wall had had to be demolished, causing a breach in the defences. Elizabeth set up a commission consisting of William Pelham, Lee, Portinari, and another Italian, Jacopo Aconcio, to confer on the works. The conference appears to have proceeded smoothly, although the two Italians disagreed with some of the plans for the layout of the fortifications, and endorsed drastic changes. They also differed between themselves as to the nature of the changes required, but nevertheless, recent excavations show that their proposals helped to shape the fortifications, which still survive almost intact.<br>
<br>Portinari also worked on a number of other projects in these years. In 1560 he advised at Portsmouth, and in 1562 he was sent to Le Havre to inspect Lee's attempts to refortify that town. He remained there as the surveyor of works until 1563, frequently complaining to the English government about the lack of supplies and money and the problems of disease and disobedience among his labourers. In December 1562 he presented plans concerning fortifications on Jersey and Guernsey. The last surviving reference to Portinari dates from 1572, when he was directed by the queen to go to Flushing in the Netherlands to report on the fortifications there, but was later exempted from the commission. His salary in 1572 was put at &pound;200 per annum. There is no record of when Portinari died or where he was buried.<br>
