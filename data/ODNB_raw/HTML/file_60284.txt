<span class="headword">Round,  Jeremy David</span>  (1957&#150;1989), <span class="occ">writer on food</span>, was born on 6 April 1957 in Kitwe, Northern Rhodesia (now Zambia), the only child of Bryan David Round (<i>b</i>. 1929), secondary schoolteacher and headmaster, and his wife, Joyce Harriet, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Bottomley (<i>b</i>. 1930), schoolteacher and deputy headmistress. When Bryan Round decided not to renew his contract with the government of Rhodesia and Nyasaland in 1962, the couple returned to England with their young son, who received his primary education at Calcot School, near Reading, Berkshire. In 1968 he went on to Palmer's College, Grays, Essex, and in 1975 he entered the University of Hull, reading English literature and philosophy. He broke off studies in 1977 and lived in Istanbul for two years, becoming knowledgeable about Turkish culture and history and fluent in the language. He returned to Hull to complete his degree studies, and graduated in 1980. He settled in Oxford, where he began to write poetry and articles on various aspects of life in Turkey. An article on Turkish food was accepted by <span class="italic">Harpers and Queen</span>, and in 1982 he won a competition&#151;to choose and explain the menu for a dinner party&#151;organized by <span class="italic">The Guardian</span> in association with Mouton Cadet. This resulted in his visiting the estate in Bordeaux and taking a course at Pru Leith's School of Food and Wine. After moving to London in 1984, he was employed as a deputy editor on <span class="italic">The Good Food Guide</span>. Under the pseudonym Jane Somers (the <i>alter ego</i> of the novelist Doris Lessing), he wrote a regular column on restaurants for the magazine <span class="italic">Country Homes and Interiors</span>. He then abandoned his disguise and started to achieve recognition with his own name.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">The Independent</span> was launched in September 1986, and for the next three years Round's Saturday column was one of the most popular features of the paper. Among his earliest admirers were Elizabeth David and Jane Grigson, who both befriended him. They appreciated his honesty and irreverent wit, and acknowledged him as a kindred spirit. Most writers on food give the impression that they know little of life beyond the kitchen or restaurant, but Round's journalism was not cast in that refined and limited mould. It was clear from his lively prose that his interests&#151;in literature, music, history, and the fine arts&#151;were those of a cultivated human being. Yet his writing was completely without pretension. When Elizabeth David, who abhorred the idea of a biography, told him over lunch that he could be her biographer if he wished, he was surprised and honoured. Her Life was one of many books he anticipated writing (in fact, he predeceased her).<br>
<br>Round published, in 1988, <span class="italic">The Independent Cook</span>, which includes recipes for Afghan rice pudding, Syrian Orthodox Easter bread, toasted chickpeas, and a Clapham peasant stew of his own invention. In 1989 he won the overall Glenfiddich food writers' award &#145;for his special and significant contribution to raising the standard&#151;and our knowledge of&#151;what we eat in this country&#146;. In August of the same year he joined other food writers on a trip to Hong Kong organized by the airline Cathay Pacific and the Mandarin hotel chain. He died, of a brain haemorrhage, in the Mandarin Hotel, Macau, on the night of 22&#150;3 August 1989. His body was identified six days later by his partner of ten years, the publisher Jeremy Campbell Trevathan (<i>b</i>. 1959). He was buried on 6 September in St Peter and St Paul's churchyard, Wingrave, Buckinghamshire.<br>
