<span class="headword">Ashley, Sir  Anthony</span>, baronet  (1551/2&#150;1628), <span class="occ">politician and translator of The Mariners Mirrour</span>, was the eldest son of Sir Anthony Ashley of Damerham in Hampshire, a cadet of the long-established Ashleys of Wimborne St Giles (Dorset), and Dorothy, daughter of John Lyte of Lytes Cary (Somerset). <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/70459/', "Sir Francis Ashley")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/763/', "Robert Ashley")</script> were his younger brothers. A typically aristocratic education involving military exercises and, probably, travel abroad, where he learned several foreign languages, was followed by legal studies at the New Inn and in 1574 the Middle Temple. Since his father was in the service of the vice-chamberlain Sir Christopher Hatton, it was Hatton also who patronized the son, sending him in the early 1580s to France as tutor and companion to his heir and nephew William, who returned in 1586 in time to be elected to parliament. Presumably it was also Hatton, now lord chancellor, who secured Ashley's appointment on 15 March 1587 as clerk to the privy council; a second office followed in 1589, the clerkship of the castle and county court of York, which he must have exercised by deputy. In 1588 Ashley was elected MP for Tavistock and in 1592 for Old Sarum, presumably by the means of the earls of Bedford and Pembroke respectively. He accompanied the queen to Oxford in 1592, when he was one of eighteen royal servants who were created MA. A career of high promise beckoned. The death of Hatton in 1591 was a grievous blow that may explain his failure to secure further advancement. In the short term Ashley failed to secure a wardship he sought from Lord Burghley as master of the court of wards and had to beg him to implement some other grant secured for him by Hatton; whatever the &#145;favours and comfortable speeches&#146; for which Ashley thanked him in December 1593, Burghley was evidently not the patron that Hatton had been. Frank accusations of frauds, embezzlement, oppressions, and perversion of justice were made against Ashley to Burghley, some of which he evidently believed and for which Ashley was suspended late in Elizabeth's reign. If no more official rewards came Ashley's way, he nevertheless profited, perhaps from successful malpractices. Reappointed clerk of the privy council on 25 April 1603, he was suspended in 1609 when charged by the Scot Sir James Crichton of poisoning William Ryce in 1591. A three-day Star Chamber hearing in 1611 found Ryce had died naturally and that Ashley was the victim of a fraudulent conspiracy by Crichton with disreputable associates either aggrieved or suborned. The aim was to secure Ashley's forfeiture and, apparently, Crichton's grant of his possessions. Unfortunately Ashley's vindication came too late to save his career: in 1610, aged nearly sixty, he was pensioned off.<br>
<br>Ashley's grand tour or tours indicate an unusual interest in travel. At the prompting of the Lord Admiral Howard of Effingham, the privy council agreed to an English edition of Lucas Waghenaer's pioneering collection of charts, first published at Leiden in 1584, and deputed Ashley to carry it out. The resultant volume, which was of enduring importance and has given its name to the principal maritime history journal, was allegedly delayed by his duties with the privy council and was published in folio in 1588 under a lengthy title commencing <span class="italic">The Mariners Mirrour</span>; it was colloquially known, from its author's name, as <span class="italic">The Waggoner</span>. Dedicated to Lord Chancellor Hatton, it was decorated with his arms and crest. More than a mere translation, it was adapted for English usage and supplemented by accounts of Drake's raid on Cadiz in 1587 and the defeat of the Armada in 1588. On 12 November 1588 Ashley was at Ilton in Somerset itemizing the Spaniards on board an Armada vessel wrecked at Hope Bay. Since there were several privy council clerks organized on a rota system, continual attendance was not obligatory, and it was therefore possible for Ashley to combine his duties with further maritime exploits. On 7 April 1589, immediately following the dissolution of parliament on 29 March, he accompanied the expedition of Drake and Norris to Portugal, in which the queen had a financial interest and whose outcome he reported on 7 July; the privy council had him oversee the disposal of the booty. He was the secretary of war for the attack on Cadiz in 1596 commanded by Howard and Essex, who knighted him. In the same year the godly preacher George Phillips dedicated <span class="italic">The Aprill of the Church</span> to Ashley, suggesting that he was seen as having puritan sympathies in religion.<br>
<br>Ashley made a good marriage, about 1590, to Jane, the daughter of Philip Okeover of Okeover and widow of Thomas Cockayne (<i>d</i>. 1587) of Ravenston, both in Staffordshire. Unfortunately her father disapproved of the match and, despite the queen's intervention, disinherited her, although Ashley secured some property after Philip's death. The Ashleys had only one child, their daughter, Anne. Ashley served on the quorum of the Middlesex commission of the peace from 1594. After 1580 he succeeded to his father's estates, which he greatly augmented by purchase, buying the family seat at Wimborne St Giles from his cousin Henry of the senior line in 1600 for &pound;1600. He moved there and tried to ensure his heirs also resided there, as they still do. It was family pride that prompted him to extend or rebuild his house there, to found an almshouse, and add a burial chapel to the parish church &#145;for my self and my successors there to be entombed with my ancestors and descendants&#146;  (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/153, fol. 123<i>v</i>). His daughter's marriage contract in 1616 decreed that her eldest son should take the name of Ashley and that any barony to which he was raised should bear that name: both promises were fulfilled, her son being baptized Anthony Ashley-Cooper at Wimborne St Giles on 22 July 1621 and created Lord Ashley before becoming earl of Shaftesbury. Contingent remainders in Ashley's will conveyed his wife's dower to his brothers' male lines should his daughter's male line fail. Already JP of the quorum for Dorset in 1599, he was sheriff of Somerset and Dorset in 1619&#150;20. His prosperous estate not only attracted Sir John Cooper, bt, of Rockbourne, Hampshire, as husband for his heir, Anne, in 1616, but made Ashley himself an eligible husband in the highest circles on the death of his first wife, Jane. On 3 January 1622 he married again; his second wife was Philippa Sheldon, a sister-in-law of the all-powerful favourite George Villiers, duke of Buckingham, whom he entertained at Wimborne St Giles. He evidently hoped thereby, in his seventies, to relaunch his career. &#145;On Thursday last Sir Anthony Ashley in his dotage married mistress Shelton, a young gentlewoman of the [Villiers] kindred, by whom he hath promise or expectation to become some great man&#146;  (HoP, <span class="italic">Commons, 1558&#150;1603</span>, 1.355). Allegedly it was the more remarkable because he &#145;never loved any but boys&#146;  (Weldon, 136). He was an unsuccessful candidate for the secretaryship of state in 1621 and the household controllership in 1622. In June 1622 he paid &pound;1095 each for baronetcies for himself and his son-in-law: his own was little use to a septuagenarian knight, but a valuable distinction for any son to be born of the match. None was. Ashley died aged seventy-six at his Holborn house on 13 January 1628 and was buried at Wimborne St Giles. His widow married again; her second husband was Carew Raleigh (1605&#150;1666). She died in 1674.<br>
