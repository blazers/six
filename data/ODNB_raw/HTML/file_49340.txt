<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Samuely,  Felix James</span>  (1902&#150;1959), <span class="occ">civil engineer</span>, was born on 3 February 1902 in Vienna of a Jewish family. His father was in the medical profession and he had a younger sister. Matriculating in science at the Kaiser Friedrich Gymnasium, Berlin, in 1919, Samuely gained a Dipl.Ing. degree at the Technische Hochschule Berlin-Charlottenburg in 1923. The thesis he submitted as part of his studies dealt with the design of reinforced concrete bridges, and he remained in Berlin for a year, working with a firm of contractors, Held and Francke. This was followed by further experience with a consulting engineer, a Dr Bauer, in Vienna. Returning to Berlin in 1925, he spent four years with the contractor, Tr&auml;gerlagergemeinschaft GmbH, on steel buildings and was introduced to the new technique of welding steel.<br>
<br>In 1929 Samuely set up in practice with Stephen E. Berger, with whom he had been at university, as Berger and Samuely Consulting Engineers, attracting young architects as clients. His commissions at this time included the construction of a factory and offices for Fromms Act K&ouml;penick with Arthur Korn and he was also one of those who worked on the design (unbuilt) for the Josty Haus, a skyscraper in Potsdamerplatz. The firm also built the first welded-steel building in Berlin, an office block in Georgenkirchenplatz. After the 1931 July slump in the German stock market and the resulting depression, Samuely, in some despair for the future, accepted an offer from the Russian government to go as a specialist to work on the design of a large steel production plant in Sverdlovsk. Lack of professional help and unacceptable living conditions prompted a move to Moscow where he designed heavy steel industrial buildings and later carried out further research on welding.<br>
<br>In 1932, while he was in Moscow, Samuely married Henny Pfingst, who came from Berlin. The following year he left Moscow and travelled with his wife to Manchuria and China looking for any suitable professional opening, but without success, and they eventually returned to Berlin. Later in 1933 he was invited to London; he managed to obtain a monthly extendable permit to stay, and Henny joined him at the end of the year. He was introduced to Ove Arup (1895&#150;1988), then chief engineer of J. L. Kier &amp; Co., who appointed him to carry out the structural calculations for the spiral ramp of the penguin pool designed by the architect, Berthold Lubetkin (1901&#150;1990), for the London Zoo. Samuely showed his mastery of calculation by completing this task over a weekend, and he subsequently joined J. L. Kier &amp; Co. on a permanent basis. During this time he also wrote a number of articles on welded steelwork and a book in German on welding which was never published.<br>
<br>In 1934 the architects Serge Chermayeff and Eric Mendelsohn, who had recently come from Berlin, won the competition for the Bexhill Pavilion. They invited Samuely to become their structural engineer, and this led to his going into partnership with Cyril Helsby and Conrad Hamann to form the firm of Helsby, Hamann, and Samuely. Although Bexhill Pavilion was conceived in reinforced concrete, Samuely, for reasons of economy, persuaded the architects to change to welded steelwork, on which he had become a leading expert. The building was the first public welded steel building in Britain and as such was studied by many bodies, including the district surveyors of the London county council who would not, at that time, accept such a construction. Two years later they relented, when Samuely, in association with the architect Joseph Emberton, built a new department store in welded steel for Simpson's of Piccadilly. The firm flourished doing further work first for Mendelsohn and Chermayeff and then for Chermayeff alone, as well as helping many leading Modern Movement architects such as Wells Coates, A. V. Pilchowski, Denys Lasdun, Connell Ward Lucas, and Frederick Gibberd. Samuely's imaginative structures were not only in welded steelwork but in sheet metal, reinforced concrete, timber, and brickwork.<br>
<br>In 1935 Samuely went to live in Hampstead, London, where he rented a flat in Highfield Court, remaining in Hampstead for the rest of his life. In 1937 he became senior lecturer in structural engineering at the Architectural Association School of Architecture, a position he held until his death. His interest in architecture led him to become a member of the MARS (Modern Architectural Research) Group of architects and in 1939 he studied air-raid precautions with Conrad Hamann, writing a book on civil protection. When war broke out, his application for citizenship had not been completed and he was classified as an alien and prohibited from working on projects of national importance. By then Helsby had left the partnership, Hamann had joined a government agency, and Samuely became a consultant to Scaffolding, Great Britain (SGB), designing some outstanding lightweight welded steel tube and rod roof structures.<br>
<br>Samuely's workload was sufficiently low to allow him time to study privately for UK qualifications. In 1941 he passed the Royal Aeronautical Society's examination to become an associate member and later in 1943 gained a BSc (Eng) degree in structural engineering with first-class honours from London University. The following year he was accepted as an associate member of the Institution of Civil Engineers and a member of the Institution of Structural Engineers. During the war years he was also very active with the MARS Group in planning studies for the future. His particular interest lay in transport and in June 1942 he edited, with Arthur Korn, the group's <span class="italic">Master Plan for London</span>. He wrote and lectured on economic construction and became a great influence on architects in the early post-war reconstruction with his pioneering structures and by stimulating better understanding and co-operation between members of the building team.<br>
<br>Because of the shortage of steel and timber and the trend for building technicians to seek stable employment in factories, Samuely began his studies into the use of precast and pre-stressed concrete. He wanted to minimize timber formwork and maximize crane handling on site, and his solution was to promote composite construction made up from expensive pre-cast concrete and relatively cheap <i>in situ</i> concrete. Samuely's first major, and perhaps best, building using such techniques was a factory at Malago, Bristol (architect J. E. Collins), for E. S. and A. Robinson in 1949. This was followed by Hatfield Technical College and a host of other educational buildings. He developed the use of external pre-cast concrete load-bearing frames for office construction, such as the National Dock Labour Board in London (architect Frederick Gibberd) of 1953 and for the US embassy (architect Eero Saarinen in association with Yorke, Rosenberg, and Mardall), also in London, in 1958. For long-span construction Samuely quickly moved from curved concrete shells with their large on-site labour costs to folded plates of composite construction. Where appropriate he used lightweight steel lattices and timber folded plates and on occasion pre-stressed the roofs further to reduce weight and cost. For the British pavilions at the Brussels International Exhibition in 1958 he used a timber folded plate construction for the government pavilion and a latticed steel folded plate roof for the industrial pavilion which was taken down at the end of the exhibition and re-erected in Hilversum in the Netherlands.<br>
<br>Samuely will be remembered, above all, as the engineer of the Skylon (for which the architects were the firm of Powell and Moya) at the Festival of Britain in 1951. To provide the necessary restraint against wind oscillation he pre-tensioned the main cables of the Skylon, a measure which meant that two of the three proposed bracing cables to each pylon could be omitted. The resulting, widely acclaimed, streamlined design was thus brought about by a brilliant collaboration of architect and engineer.<br>
<br>Samuely's extensive writings include <span class="italic">Welding</span> (1935) and <span class="italic">Steel Economy</span> (1939), as well as the MARS plan for London (1942). He gave important lectures on force and form (1950) and on space frames and stressed skin construction (1952) at the Royal Institute of British Architects; and others on structural prestressing (1955) at the Institution of Structural Engineers and composite construction (1952) at the Institution of Civil Engineers. He was awarded the Telford premium by the Institution of Civil Engineers for his lecture and paper on the Skylon (1952). In June 1960 the Architectural Association devoted the whole issue of its journal to his life, listing his buildings and his writings and giving a clear picture of his outstanding contribution to engineering and the built environment.<br>
<br>Samuely had a unique gift for the conception of structural forms. He was consulted by many architects and, as he wished to be personally involved with each project from concept to completion, he always kept his office small. He was an energetic, cheerful, small, rotund man with a quizzical smile known affectionately to colleagues, architects, and friends as Sammy, and generations of architectural students have an enduring memory of his lectures on lettuce girders. He and his wife had a long and happy marriage and enjoyed travelling together. They had no children. He died on 22 January 1959 in the London Clinic, 20 Devonshire Place, London, following a heart attack, leaving his wife and his mother, and was cremated at Golders Green crematorium in Middlesex.<br>
