<span class="headword">Bruce,  Donald William Trevor</span>, Baron Bruce of Donington  (1912&#150;2005), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born at 76 Norbury Court Road, Norbury, Surrey, on 3 October 1912, the son of William Trevor Bruce (<i>d</i>. 1934), a wealthy insurance broker, and his wife, Mary Frances, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Law. The family left Norbury for Lincolnshire when Donald was quite young but had already started at Norbury preparatory school. He received his secondary education at Donington grammar school in Lincolnshire. He did not go on to university but, under his father's influence, trained locally to become a chartered accountant. In 1930 he moved to London, where he was articled to a City firm of accountants. He qualified as a chartered accountant and industrial economist.<br>
<br>By the early 1930s Bruce had established himself with sufficient confidence to become involved in Conservative Party politics. He joined the North Paddington branch of the Junior Imperial League and was an active campaigner for the local Conservative MP in the lead-up to the crisis of 1931 that brought the collapse of Ramsay MacDonald's Labour government and the formation of a national government led by MacDonald and Stanley Baldwin. By then Bruce, a firm young patriot, had also enlisted in the Territorial Army (the Middlesex yeomanry), in which he served for four years. He had the build of a guardsman, broad-shouldered, a craggy face even as a young man, with beetle brows covering sharp eyes. Altogether it was a combination that appeared to prepare him for a military career or possibly that of a traditional Conservative MP. That would certainly have reflected the Bruce family background. Despite all this Donald Bruce underwent an extraordinary transformation to end up a left-wing member of the Labour Party, which he joined in 1935 after a short spell with the still more radical Independent Labour Party. This remarkable change took root following the collapse of the MacDonald government of 1931 at a time of economic crisis, widespread depression, and social deprivation, all of which made a profound impression on the young Bruce. Nevertheless, it was clearly a highly unusual conversion. On 15 July 1939 he married Joan Letitia, the 22-year-old daughter of Henry Claud Butcher, cycle manufacturer. They had one son and three daughters.<br>
<br>Immediately following the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939 Bruce rejoined the army, eventually rising to the rank of major in the Royal Signals. After taking part in the Normandy landings, which brought a mention in dispatches, he was recruited to General Eisenhower's intelligence staff. None of this affected his by then well-developed political convictions, and while still in uniform he was selected as Labour candidate to contest the hitherto safe Conservative seat of North Portsmouth in the general election of 1945&#151;which he went on to win by a majority of 1042. Bruce followed up his political transformation by joining the Fabian Society and the campaigning Keep Left group within the Labour Party, which included new MPs from the 1945 intake like Michael Foot. He quickly made a reputation as a powerful advocate of socialism and came to the attention of Aneurin Bevan, who had just been appointed minister of health by Prime Minister Attlee. Soon afterwards Bevan accosted Bruce in the doorway of the Commons' smoking room and offered to make him his parliamentary private secretary. Bruce was stunned and flattered but grasped the opportunity. He became Bevan's chief lieutenant during the preparation of legislation to establish the National Health Service and Bevan sent him to Sweden and Denmark to study the socialized health systems in both those countries. He became devoted to Bevan and was soon regarded in the inner sanctum of government as &#145;Nye's hairshirt&#146;&#151;chiefly because he was always prepared to argue with Bevan himself against compromises the minister was under pressure to make, most notably to the medical profession in the critical months when the NHS was struggling to be born. By the time the NHS was launched in July 1948 the two men had become firm and close friends. Indeed, Bruce was&#151;and remained&#151;among the few men around him whom Bevan trusted. Bruce in turn always insisted that his election as a Labour MP in the Labour landslide of 1945 was a crowning moment and his association with Aneurin Bevan his greatest achievement.<br>
<br>In the general election of 1950 Bruce lost his redrawn Portsmouth West constituency by 945 votes. When he tried again for a parliamentary seat in the Wrekin in the general elections of 1959 and 1964, he failed each time. By then he had already set up his own accountancy firm, which he personally ran until 1974 when it merged with Halpern and Woolf, with Bruce remaining a senior partner. Halpern and Woolf were later taken over by Casson Beckman, which eventually merged with Baker Tilly, for whom Bruce was still working as a consultant well into his later years. Yet he never ceased his active role as a left-wing campaigner in the Labour Party and a committed Bevanite.<br>
<br>In 1974 Harold Wilson, on returning to office, created Bruce a life peer as Baron Bruce of Donington. He was one of the first British appointees to become a member of the European parliament after Britain's entry into the EEC. He was rapporteur for the Labour Group but resigned in 1979 when direct elections for the European parliament were introduced. In fact he had never really believed in the European project. On one occasion in 1979, before he resigned as rapporteur, he sensationally refused to sign the EC accounts because, he claimed, there was evidence of &#145;scandalous duplicity&#146; in the handling of financial controls. When in 1979 he was appointed in the House of Lords as opposition spokesman on Treasury economic and industrial questions, he was a constant critic of European institutional practices. He continued in that role until 1990, when he decided to stand aside. Throughout those active years he established a reputation as one of the predictably sternest, often infuriating, critics of virtually everything proposed in the name of the European Union.<br>
<br>Bruce remained an active and assiduous attender in the Lords to the end of his life, never hesitating to become involved in controversy&#151;especially where Europe was concerned. By the end of his life he was the last remaining member of the Parliamentary Labour Party of 1945 still to be sitting in parliament, a badge he wore with great pride. His first marriage ended in divorce in 1980 and on 12 February 1981 he married Cyrena Shaw Heard, a 64-year-old widow and daughter of Cyril Charles Shaw, mining engineer. He died of prostate cancer at Avon House nursing home, Kensington, London, on 18 April 2005. He was survived by his wife, son, and one daughter, two daughters having predeceased him.<br>
