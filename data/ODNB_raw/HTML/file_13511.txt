<span class="headword">Holl,  Francis Montague <span class="st"> [Frank]</span></span>  (1845&#150;1888), <span class="occ">painter and illustrator</span>, was born on 4 July 1845 at 7 St James's Terrace, in Kentish Town, London, the eldest among the four children of the well-known engraver <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13510/', "Francis Holl (1815&#150;1884)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/65035/', "Holl family")</script>] and his wife, Alicia Margaret Dixon, who was the daughter of a naval officer and veteran of the battle of Trafalgar. His grandfather <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13512/', "William Holl the elder (1771&#150;1838)")</script> and uncle <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13513/', "William Holl the younger (1807&#150;1871)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/65035/', "Holl family")</script>] were also engravers.<br>
<br>Frank Holl learned the rudiments of drawing from his father. Because of a sickly constitution his formal schooling was limited, and the strain of ill health in boyhood may have contributed to his early death. Despite his apparent frailty, however, he exhibited a passion for cricket and tennis, playing the latter as an adult with considerable skill. Holl was accepted at fifteen as a student at the Royal Academy Schools, and won a gold medal for a religious painting, <span class="italic">Abraham about to Sacrifice Isaac</span>, in 1863. A year later two of his paintings were accepted for exhibition at the Royal Academy, where he showed work regularly until his death. (His election as associate of the Royal Academy in 1878 was followed by full membership in 1883.) On 16 May 1867 he married Annie Laura, daughter of the watercolourist and landscape painter <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32728/', "Charles Davidson (1824&#150;1902)")</script>. They had four daughters: Ada, Olive, Madeline, and Phillis.<br>
<br>The critical and public success of Holl's first great subject picture, <span class="italic">The Lord gave and the Lord hath taken away</span> (1869; Guildhall Art Gallery, London), which depicts a grief-stricken family praying together in their lowly cottage, resulted in the award of a travelling scholarship. In an unusual move Holl relinquished the scholarship after only a few months of travel abroad when he realized that he preferred to paint subjects from modern English life rather than to study Old Master paintings. On his return Queen Victoria commissioned from him <span class="italic">No Tidings from the Sea</span> (1871; Royal Collection), having been unable to purchase his first exhibited success, which was already sold. The subject matter endorsed Holl's reputation as an artist with a morbid temperament whose works often focused on themes of impending tragedy and death. Other melancholy images of family life from the 1870s include scenes of funeral processions, and maternal loss and grief, such as <span class="italic">I am the Resurrection and the Life</span> (1872; Leeds City Art Gallery), <span class="italic">Her First Born</span> (1877; Sheffield City Art Galleries), and <span class="italic">Hushed</span> (1877; Tate Collection). While critical response to these lugubrious themes was often negative they remained extremely popular with the general public, and engravings after them extended their appeal to a wider audience.<br>
<br>Reviewers often compared Holl's mournful pictures to those of his contemporary the Dutch artist Jozef Israels (1824&#150;1911), whose work, though admired by Holl in Antwerp while on his scholarship travels, was already well known in England. Holl's painting of prison life, based on his own observations&#151;<span class="italic">Newgate: Committed for Trial</span> (1878; Royal Holloway Collection, University of London)&#151;was another socially-aware image that obtained for the artist strong critical notice and public response. With Luke Fildes and Hubert von Herkomer, two artists with whom he worked at <span class="italic">The Graphic</span> magazine between 1872 and 1883, Holl became part of an informal school of social-realist painting that flourished during the 1870s; its aim was to draw attention to the everyday conditions of the working classes and the poor, and implicitly to criticize the social structures that maintained such conditions. Working intermittently for the periodical, Holl made some twenty illustrations either drawn especially for the magazine or based on paintings exhibited earlier at the Royal Academy. He also completed in 1874 a set of twenty-four illustrations for the novel <span class="italic">Phineas Redux</span>, by Anthony Trollope. Vincent Van Gogh collected several of Holl's social-realist engravings for his collection of works by English illustrators, now housed in the Vincent Van Gogh Museum and Foundation in Amsterdam.<br>
<br>When Holl exhibited a portrait of the engraver Samuel Cousins (Tate Collection; pen and wash drawing, NPG) at the Royal Academy in 1879 it created a sensation, and until his death in 1888 he painted a further 197 portraits, a staggering number in such a short period of time. It was thought that this feverish overwork aggravated the heart disease that eventually killed him. Holl painted many great men of his day (he painted only two female portraits); his most admired portrait work included <span class="italic">William Ewart Gladstone</span> (1888; Hawarden Castle, Flintshire), <span class="italic">The Earl Spencer</span> (1888; priv. coll.), <span class="italic">William Agnew</span> (1883; Thos. Agnew &amp; Sons, Ltd, London), and <span class="italic">The Duke of Cleveland</span> (priv. coll., USA). One of his last portraits was of the American millionaire J. Pierpont Morgan (1888; Pierpont Morgan Library, New York), painted when Holl was mortally ill. It was this kind of conscientiousness in executing his commissions that exacerbated his already fragile health. His workload and exhausting schedule did, however, bring financial rewards that enabled Holl and his family to afford a lavish lifestyle resembling that of the illustrious figures whom he painted. He lived in two grand houses designed for him by the architect Richard Norman Shaw: Three Gables, Fitzjohn's Avenue, Hampstead, and Burrows Cross, Albury, Surrey.<br>
<br>Holl's success as a portraitist was often equated with that of his contemporaries John Everett Millais and George Frederic Watts. His portraits were distinctly sombre in hue, with a preponderance of black; the sober colouring of his work paid homage to his idols Vel&aacute;zquez and Rembrandt. Holl's technique, however, with its swiftly executed, sketchy brushwork also bears comparison with the then fashionable French portraitist Charles-&Eacute;mile-Auguste Carolus-Duran. Holl felt privileged to meet the important people whom he painted and, wearing his signature checked suit, kept up a steady stream of conversation with his sitters, who numbered three a day. He was noted for capturing an excellent likeness and also for delineating in paint the essentials of his subjects' personality and character. <span class="italic">Sir John Tenniel</span> (<i>c</i>.1883) and <span class="italic">Joseph Chamberlain</span> (1886), both in the National Portrait Gallery, London, are good examples.<br>
<br>Holl died, of heart failure, at his home in Hampstead&#151;Three Gables, Fitzjohn's Avenue&#151;on 31 July 1888, and was buried in Highgate cemetery on 7 August. His wife survived him. In paying tribute to her father A. M. Reynolds wrote of &#145;his striking and vigorous intellect&#146;, remarking that he was &#145;gifted in many ways, of which painting was only one, and one into which he threw his whole soul&#146;&#151;a comment tempered by her observation that &#145;if one seeks for the dominant trait in his character &hellip; it was, perhaps, his extreme simplicity and modesty&#146;  (Reynolds, 315&#150;16).<br>
