<span class="headword">Robinson,  Sarah</span>  (1834&#150;1921), <span class="occ">evangelist and army temperance activist</span>, was born at Peckham, Surrey, on 1 August 1834, the fourth of the six children of John James Robinson (1795/6&#150;1879), squire of Heasmond's estate near Lewes, Sussex, where he farmed 150 acres, and his wife, Rebecca, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Morris. She was baptized at the Grove Independent chapel, Camberwell, Surrey, on 4 October 1834. Her enthusiasm for things military began early on in her life, and she spent her childhood roaming her father's estate, playing toy soldiers with her two younger brothers, and reading biographies of Christian military heroes. From about 1844 she spent four years at an academy for young ladies in Brighton. Although described as &#145;delicate in health, reserved, sensitive and timid&#146;  (Chappell, 64), Robinson, a lifelong spinster, was one of a cadre of mid-century female evangelists who felt called to work among the army's &#145;roughs and toughs&#146;  (Anderson, 58). She was inspired, as were many female temperance workers, by the pioneering work of Julia Wightman and her book <span class="italic">Haste to the Rescue</span> (1860). Robinson's work was typical of late Victorian gospel temperance, a combination of religious zeal and teetotalism, in which temperance itself comprised an essential dimension of personal redemption. Yet her faith was considerably more eclectic than her father's strict Calvinism, leading to affiliations with first the Church of England (from 1851) and then a Presbyterian congregation (from 1866&#150;7).<br>
<br>In 1858 the Robinson family moved to Box Grove Villas, near Guildford, 10 miles from Aldershot barracks, which were the site of Robinson's first venture into army temperance reform. Temperance workers had made little headway in the services before the 1860s. Popular representation of the soldier's life as a glamorous, heroic sacrifice lay in stark contrast to the reality of physical debilitation, harsh discipline, and high levels of profligacy. Robinson recognized that intemperance was particularly rife among the lower ranks where recruitment, billetings, and entertainment of volunteers centred exclusively round the public house. Accordingly in 1863 she helped an officer's widow, Louisa Daniell, launch the Aldershot Mission Institute, providing servicemen with an alcohol-free centre for relaxation and education.<br>
<br>With Agnes Weston&#151;her temperance counterpart in the navy&#151;Robinson was charged by the National Temperance League with the promotion of several significant and permanent temperance initiatives. Between 1865 and 1873 she worked as an itinerant temperance agent, visiting military garrisons as far afield as Brighton, Bristol, Exeter, Hounslow, Leeds, Canterbury, York, and Newport on the Isle of Wight. In 1873 she spent nine weeks in an open camp on Dartmoor, accompanying various regiments on manoeuvres. Here she set up two large marquees, selling huge quantities of non-alcoholic refreshments and cheap food. In addition she distributed <span class="roman">Bibles</span>, held services and prayer meetings, and provided a reading-room for the troops, equipped with games, newspapers, and books. Robinson's success in converting servicemen to teetotalism, in providing decent entertainment and educational facilities, and in obtaining better quality accommodation for troops led to considerable national publicity and her subsequent recognition as the Soldier's Friend. She was entered in the parliamentary blue book as a lecturer in military education, and her refreshment canteens were visited by the secretary of war. Later she was included in Jeannie Chappell's popular <span class="italic">Noble Work by Noble Women</span> [1900].<br>
<br>Robinson published several books on gospel temperance reform, of which the most significant was <span class="italic">Christianity and Teetotalism</span> (1876). She was also a contributor to the influential collection of essays <span class="italic">Woman's Work in the Temperance Reformation</span> (1868), edited by Hatford Battersby, and she compiled three accounts of her activities, the earliest of which was <span class="italic">A Life Record</span> (1898). Her most celebrated temperance venture was the founding of the Portsmouth Soldiers' Institute in 1874: she raised funds for the conversion of The Fountain inn in Portsmouth High Street into a place of safe, decent, Christian accommodation for military troops returning from, or embarking upon, service abroad. Sick or wounded soldiers, and the often destitute wives and families of servicemen, were housed there and given practical help. Additional recreation rooms, a lecture hall, and separate accommodation for officers were subsequently added to the building. Despite vociferous opposition by local townspeople, unappreciative of her widespread depiction of Portsmouth as &#145;Satan's very seat&#146;  (Chappell, 91), Robinson refused to compromise the strict teetotalism and religious moralism central to her reform programme. Within two years the institute had earned itself a national reputation for the improvement of the social welfare of troops, and in 1876 it was visited by the commander-in-chief of the British army, George, duke of Cambridge.<br>
<br>Despite a worsening spinal complaint, Robinson undertook tours of England and Scotland in the summers of 1889 and 1891 in order to raise money for the institute's accumulating debts. She travelled 3000 miles in a specially constructed coach, delivering 165 addresses. She finally retired from public life, as a result of her chronic invalidism, to Burley in the New Forest, where she shared a house with Miss Alice Walker, although she continued to direct her lady helpers at the Portsmouth Institute. Walker acted as superintendent of the Soldiers' Institute for thirteen years. Robinson's final autobiographical account, <span class="italic">My Book: a Personal Narrative</span>, was published in 1914. She died at her home, The Hut, Burley, Hampshire, on 26 November 1921, and was cremated at Woking. Her success was due not only to her loyalty to and concern for the reputation of the British army as a creditable institution, but to her ability to handle the subject of temperance with discretion and sensitivity. Through the influence of the philanthropic endeavours of temperance workers such as Sarah Robinson, army authorities began to assume a greater level of responsibility for the moral welfare of their troops and to undertake the general reform of the recreational habits of servicemen.<br>
