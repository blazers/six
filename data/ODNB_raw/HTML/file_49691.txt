<span class="headword">Cowell,  Samuel Houghton</span>  (1820&#150;1864), <span class="occ">actor and comic singer</span>, the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6491/', "Joseph Cowell")</script> and his first wife, Maria Murray, was born in London on 5 April 1820. He was taken by his father to America in 1822, and educated in a military academy at Mount Airey, near Philadelphia, where he made great progress in his few years of steady education. In 1829, at the age of nine, he made his first appearance on the stage, at Boston, as Crack in Thomas Knight's <span class="italic">The Turnpike Gate</span>, singing with his father the duet &#145;When off in curricle we go&#146;. From that time onwards he earned his own living and was hailed as &#145;the young American Roscius&#146;. He acted in all the chief theatres of the United States, some of his characters being Chick, Matty Marvellous, Bombastes Furioso, and one of the Dromios in Shakespeare's <span class="italic">The Comedy of Errors</span>, his father playing the other.<br>
<br>Cowell went to Scotland, and appeared in Edinburgh at the Theatre Royal and the Adelphi, under the management of his uncle, W. H. Murray. He became an established favourite, not only as an actor, but as a comic singer between the acts. On 5 November 1842 he married Emilie Marguerite Ebsworth (1818&#150;1899), the daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8432/', "Joseph Ebsworth")</script>, a highly esteemed dramatist and teacher of music, and the well-known actress <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8433/', "Mary Emma Ebsworth")</script>. They had nine children, of whom two daughters, <a name="cosubject_49691"></a><span class="headword">Sydney Cowell</span>  (1846&#150;1925) and <a name="cosubject_49692"></a><span class="headword">Florence Cowell</span> <span class="st"> [<em>known as </em>Mrs Alfred B. Tapping]</span>  (1852&#150;1926), and one of the six sons, Joseph, became successful professional actors. After remaining for four years in Edinburgh, Cowell went to London on an engagement for three years, with Benjamin Webster, at the Adelphi, but soon abandoned this, and appeared in July 1844 as Alessio in <span class="italic">La sonnambula</span> at the Surrey Theatre. Before 1848 he moved to the Olympic as a stock comedian under Bolton's management, then for two years he was at the Princess's, under James Maddox, playing second to Henry Compton. Next he went to Covent Garden, under Alfred Bunn, and afterwards to Glasgow, under his old friend Edmund Glover, though he took other engagements at Belfast and Dublin.<br>
<br>Everywhere a favourite, flattered and tempted towards conviviality, and naturally restless, Cowell grew tired of dramatic study, which was always arduous in the provinces, where a frequent change of performances was necessary, and he decided to devote himself to character singing. His &#145;Billy Barlow&#146;, &#145;The Ratcatcher's Daughter&#146;, &#145;Clara Cline&#146; (considered one of the sweetest and best of his own compositions), &#145;Robinson Crusoe&#146;, and the burlesque ditties of &#145;Alonzo the Brave&#146; and &#145;Richard the Third&#146; were embodied with so much dramatic spirit, in appropriate costume, with his rich voice and power of mimicry, that he virtually founded a new class of drawing-room entertainment, and gave such satisfaction that &#145;Evans's&#146; of Covent Garden (&#145;Paddy Green's&#146;) and Charles Morton's Canterbury Hall owed their popularity chiefly to him. He was hailed as the virtual founder of music-hall entertainment. Collections of <span class="italic">Sam Cowell's Songs</span> and photographic portraits of him in character used to be both enormously numerous and popular. He joined Conquest at the Royal Grecian, where he enacted Nobody with a <i>buffo</i> song in E. Leman Blanchard's extravaganza <span class="italic">Nobody in London</span>, which playfully satirized the Great Exhibition excitement of 1851.<br>
<br>Cowell twice appeared at Windsor Castle before the queen at her court theatricals. In August 1852 he was at St James's Theatre. In 1860, after immense success in provincial towns, he went again to America. The vessel encountered such stormy weather that his health was permanently injured. He had been wonderfully robust, but consumption developed after his return to London in 1862. He was invited to Blandford, Dorset, by his friend Robert Eyers of the Crown Hotel, to recover his health if possible, but soon after moving there he died, on 11 March 1864. He was buried in the cemetery at Blandford on 15 March, and a monument was erected by his friends. His widow died at the age of eighty on 13 January 1899.<br>
