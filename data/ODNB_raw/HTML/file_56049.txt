<span class="headword">Walker,  Alexander</span>  (1779&#150;1852), <span class="occ">writer on anatomy and physiology</span>, was born at Edinburgh on 20 December 1779. He studied at the Edinburgh medical school, but there is no evidence that he completed a degree in either anatomy or surgery. He received instruction in anatomy from John Barclay at Edinburgh, but when he was twenty years old he left Scotland for London to pursue his interest in anatomy under the direction of John Abernethy at St Bartholomew's medical school. Walker was a middle-class radical, a polemicist, and an eccentric, and his intellectual formation was of the late Scottish Enlightenment with its commitment to the development of a science of &#145;man&#146;. He attracted attention at Abernethy's school for the precise, mathematical nature of his anatomical instruction, but he was forced to leave for pointing out a dissecting error made by Abernethy during one of his lectures. John Struthers, a friend and colleague, explained: &#145;What position he had occupied at St Bart's, or in Abernethy's class, I am unaware, but the incident of the nerve being tied instead of the artery (on the dead subject), and Mr Walker's giving offence and having to leave there, in consequence of pointing it out, I have on good authority&#146;  (Struthers, 77).<br>
<br>After retiring to Edinburgh for a short period of time, Walker returned to London in 1808 and was listed as a lecturer in the &#145;Extra-Academical School of Medicine and Surgery&#146;. There he delivered medical lectures at the Lyceum and lectures &#145;on general and particular science&#146; at the assembly rooms. His subsequent career was mainly literary, though he described himself as a &#145;lecturer in anatomy and physiology&#146; committed to the popularization of science. Besides contributions to newspapers, reviews, and magazines (notably a series of articles on science and art for the <span class="italic">Literary Gazette</span> and <span class="italic">Archives of Universal Science</span>), he published fourteen books, including two scientific works on the nervous system in 1834 and 1839, and a popular trilogy, <span class="italic">Woman</span>, in 1836, 1838, and 1839, which was reprinted in several editions in England and the United States during the nineteenth century. As early as 1809 Walker suggested that the roots of the spinal nerves had different functions&#151;that the anterior root determined the sensory function whereas the dorsal root determined the motor function&#151;but the subsequent experiments of Fran&ccedil;ois Magendie and Charles Bell proved that though correct in his initial assertion, he had attributed the wrong functions to the wrong roots. In separate studies, Magendie and Bell demonstrated that the anterior root determined the motor function and the dorsal root determined the sensory one. Throughout his life Walker persisted in his belief that Magendie and Bell had &#145;borrowed and inverted&#146; his great discovery, stealing the credit and misinterpreting the facts  (Walker, iii). He defended his position in two works, <span class="italic">The Nervous System</span> (1834) and <span class="italic">Documents and Dates of Modern Discoveries in the Nervous System</span> (1839), and it is ironic that the latter work actually makes Bell's own claim to priority over Magendie (in <span class="italic">The Idea of a New Anatomy of the Brain</span>, 1811) available to the public for the first time. Walker's work on physiognomy was published as <span class="italic">Physiognomy, Founded on Physiology</span> (1834).<br>
<br>Walker's most successful work was <span class="italic">Beauty</span> (1836), the first volume of his trilogy on <span class="italic">Woman</span>&#151;which also included <span class="italic">Intermarriage</span> (1838) and <span class="italic">Woman</span> (1839)&#151;in which he applied the scientific disciplines of anatomy and physiology to the female form. Drawing on the work of such notable theoreticians of beauty as Leonardo da Vinci, Johann Joachim Winckelmann, Joseph Hume, William Hogarth, and Edmund Burke, <span class="italic">Beauty</span> foreshadowed Walter Pater's work <span class="italic">The Renaissance</span> (1870). Yet according to Walker, accounts of the &#145;mystical and delusive&#146; character of female beauty should be replaced by the division of the human figure into a hierarchical structure with three major sections: the feet and legs (the locomotive organs); the trunk (the nutritive or vital organs); and the head (the mental organs). Two further works on the same theme&#151;<span class="italic">Female Beauty</span> (1837) and <span class="italic">Exercises for Ladies</span> (1837)&#151;were published under the authorship of Mrs A. Walker and Donald Walker respectively, but (though it is known that Walker was married at some point) it is generally thought that he wrote these works himself. He returned to Edinburgh in 1842 in failing health and died on 6 December 1852.<br>
