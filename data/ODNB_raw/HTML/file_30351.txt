<span class="headword">Aikman,  George</span>  (1830&#150;1905), <span class="occ">painter and engraver</span>, was born in Warriston Close, off the High Street, Edinburgh, on 20 May 1830, the ninth child of George Aikman, engraver, and Alison Mackay (<i>d</i>. in or before 1859), his wife. His father had been an engraver for William Home Lizars but established his own business in 1825 where he continued the Lizars tradition by producing all the plates and illustrations for the seventh edition of the <span class="italic">Encyclopaedia Britannica</span>. Many of these were drawn and engraved by his son George, who was educated privately and then sent to the Royal High School, Edinburgh. Thereafter he was apprenticed to his father and, after a journeyman period during which he worked in London and Manchester, he joined his father's firm as a partner. During his apprenticeship, Aikman attended classes at the Trustees' Academy, then under the directorship of Robert Scott Lauder. Much later, between 1868 and 1871, he attended the life school of the Royal Scottish Academy. He first exhibited there in 1850 and thereafter became a regular exhibitor, his subjects ranging between landscapes, architectural studies, figure studies, and portraits. On 2 December 1859 Aikman married Elizabeth Barnett (<i>c</i>.1833&#150;1912) of Greenock and they had two sons and three daughters.<br>
<br>In 1872 Aikman abandoned his business as an engraver and turned his full attention to landscape painting in oils and watercolours. He worked mostly in Scotland, the north of England, and Warwickshire. Concentrating on moorland and woodland scenes, these oil paintings tend to be sombre in colour, for example <span class="italic">Scotch Firs</span> (exh. RA, 1878). He also painted harbour and coastal subjects in both oils and watercolours. These, with their use of silvery grey tones, show the influence of the Dutch painters of The Hague school. Aikman was a founder member of the Royal Scottish Society of Painters in Watercolour in 1878 and three years later he was elected an associate of the Royal Scottish Academy. In addition to his landscapes, Aikman was also deeply interested in the architecture of Edinburgh and he produced a series of finely worked drawings of the threatened buildings of the old town, for example <span class="italic">Bakehouse Close, Canongate</span> (Edinburgh City Art Collections).<br>
<br>Although Aikman first received recognition as a painter he also worked extensively as a printmaker. For most of his life he etched, and in this medium produced fine portraits, for example <span class="italic">Portrait of Thomas Carlyle</span> (1889; Royal Scottish Academy, Edinburgh). He also experimented with mezzotints, for example, <span class="italic">Portrait of Lord Blackburn after Daniel Macnee</span> (1888; Royal Scottish Academy, Edinburgh). In addition, Aikman produced <span class="italic">A Round of the Links: the Golf Greens of Scotland</span> (1893) with twenty etchings after John Smart, and he illustrated Thomas Chapman and John Southesk's book <span class="italic">The Midlothian Esks and their Associations from the Source to the Sea</span> (1895) with a series of full-plate etchings and smaller text illustrations. Through his father and from his own study, Aikman acquired a wide-ranging knowledge of engravers and engraving and he contributed to various publications on the subject as well as to the <span class="italic">Art Journal</span>.<br>
<br>Aikman died at home, 22 Scotland Street, Edinburgh, on 8 January 1905 and was buried in Warriston cemetery, Edinburgh, on 11 January. He was survived by his wife and family.<br>
