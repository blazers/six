<span class="headword">Lyons,  John Charles</span>  (1792&#150;1874), <span class="occ">horticulturist and antiquary</span>, was born on 22 August 1792, the only child of Charles John Lyons (1766&#150;1796), captain of the 12th light dragoons, and his wife, Mary Anne (<i>d</i>. 1855), daughter of Sir Richard Levinge. His grandfather, who survived his father, was John Lyons (<i>d</i>. 1803), a landed proprietor, of Ledestown, Mullingar, co. Westmeath. John Charles succeeded to his grandfather's estate in 1803. He attended Reading School and matriculated at Pembroke College, Oxford, on 21 May 1810, but took no degree. He served as a magistrate and was high sheriff for co. Westmeath in 1816. On 14 March 1820 he married Penelope Melesina, only daughter of Hugh Tuite of Sonna; they had a son and a daughter. After her death in February 1855, he married, on 12 November 1856, Frances Ellen, third daughter of Thomas Walsh of Belleview, co. Westmeath, with whom he had two sons and two daughters.<br>
<br>Lyons is best-known for his studies on the cultivation of orchids, of which he had a large collection at Ledestown. The failure of his first collection of orchids from Mexico led to his discovery that there was no authority on their cultivation. His <span class="italic">Remarks on the Management of Orchidaceous Plants, with a Catalogue</span> (1843) was produced on a printing press at Ledestown. It received the gold medal of the Royal Horticultural Society of Ireland. Lyons was a practical man, who engraved the illustrations for his books, designed and constructed his printing presses and greenhouses, and also built clocks. Besides contributing to horticultural journals, he wrote several antiquarian works, printed on his own press, including <span class="italic">A book of surveys and distribution of the estates forfeited in the county of Westmeath in the year 1641</span> (1852) and <span class="italic">The Grand Juries of Westmeath from 1727 to 1853</span> (1853).<br>
<br>Lyons died on 3 September 1874 at Ledestown, and was buried in the family grave at All Saints' Church, Mullingar, Westmeath.<br>
