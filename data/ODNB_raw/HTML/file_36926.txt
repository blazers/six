<span class="headword">Williams, Sir  John Fischer</span>  (1870&#150;1947), <span class="occ">international lawyer</span>, was born in Kensington, London, on 26 February 1870, the only son of John Williams, a member of a firm trading in China, and his wife, Augusta Elizabeth, daughter of Maximilian Fischer, of Liverpool and later of Macau, China. He was educated at Harrow School (of which he wrote a history in 1901) and, when only sixteen, was elected to a scholarship at New College, Oxford, but being too young to matriculate spent a year on the continent studying modern languages. He was placed in the first class in <i>literae humaniores</i> and elected a fellow of his college in 1892, and was awarded the Arnold essay prize in 1893. He then read for the bar in the chambers of Henry Studdy Theobald, and was called by Lincoln's Inn in 1894.<br>
<br>After practising for some years at the Chancery bar Williams took silk in 1921. He unsuccessfully contested Oxford City as a Liberal at the general election of December 1910, and, although he did not again seek to enter parliament, he remained a staunch Liberal throughout his life. In 1912 he published his proposals for life insurance for the poor. He was a strong believer in proportional representation and for many years was treasurer of the Proportional Representation Society. In 1914 he published an important study on the subject, entitled <span class="italic">Proportional Representation and British Politics</span> (1914; 2nd edn, 1918).<br>
<br>During the First World War Williams served in the aliens branch of the Home Office, and it was at this time that he began to be specially interested in international law. From 1920 to 1930 he was legal adviser to the British delegation on the reparation commission set up in Paris by the treaty of Versailles, and he represented the delegation in several arbitrations which took place at The Hague between the commission and the German government under the Dawes plan in 1926 and the years following. He also served as chairman of the departmental committee on imprisonment for non-payment of fines (1933), which also investigated other sums payable under a magistrate's order, such as maintenance payments.<br>
<br>In person Williams was tall and handsome, in manner invariably courteous, modest in his estimate of his own work and generous in his appreciation of others. He was twice married: first, in 1896 to Florence, daughter of Richard Keown-Boyd. The marriage produced one daughter but was subsequently dissolved. In 1911 he married (Eleanor) Marjorie Hay (1880&#150;1961), daughter of Robert Evelyn Hay Murray, of Hascombe, Surrey. The couple had four daughters, one of whom, Jenifer (1914&#150;2005), married in 1941 H. L. A. Hart, who became in 1952 professor of jurisprudence at Oxford. Williams was appointed CBE in 1917 and was knighted in 1923.<br>
<br>After his retirement in 1930 Williams settled in Oxford and was employed by the Foreign Office on commissions and conferences. He took part as counsel or as arbitrator in several international arbitrations, and in 1936 he was made a member of the British panel on the Permanent Court of Arbitration at The Hague. He also acted as chairman of the royal commission on tithe, the report of which led to the passing of the <span class="roman">Tithe Act</span> in 1936. Besides this public work he devoted himself by lecturing and writing to promoting the study of international law, and he collaborated actively in the work of the Institut de Droit International to which he had been elected in 1929. A number of his articles in learned journals were collected in his <span class="italic">Chapters on Current International Law and the League of Nations</span> (1929). A monograph, <span class="italic">Some Aspects of the Covenant of the League of Nations</span>, appeared in 1934. All his work combined the clearness and the realism of a first-class legal mind with the forward-looking outlook of the idealist. His last years were saddened by the failure of the league, from which he had hoped for much, and by the outbreak of war in 1939. Williams died at his home, Bowling Green House, Headington, Oxford, on 17 May 1947. He was survived by his second wife.<br>
