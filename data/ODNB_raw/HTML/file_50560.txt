<span class="headword">Taylor,  John</span>  (1710/11&#150;1775), <span class="occ">button manufacturer</span>, is thought to have been born of humble parentage. Although little is known of his early years, William Hutton stated in his <span class="italic">History of Birmingham</span> in 1782 that Taylor began his working life as an artisan. Taylor was married to Mary Baker (1710/11&#150;1784).<br>
<br>In July 1755 two Londoners wrote of a visit to &#145;Mr Taylor, the most considerable Maker of Gilt-metal Buttons and enamell'd snuff-boxes&#146; at his workshops, possibly in Crooked Lane, off Dale End  (<span class="italic">Four Topographical Letters</span>, 55). Four years later Taylor was one of two manufacturers explaining to a House of Commons committee the importance of the metal toy trade in Birmingham. They claimed that the town had increased by roughly a half since the industry began, employing at least 20,000 people in Birmingham and the neighbouring towns and having a trade value of about &pound;600,000 per year, of which the greater proportion was exported. They also stressed the use of machines or engines, invented by the people of Birmingham, which &#145;lessens the manual labour, and enables boys to do men's work&#146;  (Hopkins, 7).<br>
<br>In 1766 Lord Shelburne was impressed by Taylor's use of an alloy, by the heavy reliance on machinery, and his division of labour to speed the production process. &#145;Thus a button passes through fifty hands, and each hand perhaps passes a thousand a day; &hellip; by this means the work becomes so simple that &hellip; children of six to eight years old do it as well as men, and earn from ten pence to eight shillings a week&#146;  (Fitzmaurice, 403). The value of Taylor's weekly output of buttons was estimated as at least &pound;800.<br>
<br>Three processes were used in the finishing and decorating of Taylor's wares: gilt plating, japanning or enamelling, and painting. One employee is recorded as regularly earning &pound;3 10<i>s</i>. by painting 3360 snuff-boxes weekly. Taylor was credited with the production of the unique and fashionable wavy tinted patterns on one line of snuff-boxes, on which, using his thumb on a second coat of colour while it was still wet, &#145;he wove, in endless variety, the patterns he desired&#146;  (S. Lloyd, 41).<br>
<br>Taylor's business acumen and flair for organization led to the founding of Birmingham's first bank in 1765, in partnership with <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37682/', "Sampson Lloyd (1699&#150;1779)")</script>. Taylor and Lloyd expanded to London, becoming Lloyds Bank in 1852. The capital of &pound;8000 was raised equally between the partners, but Lloyd family correspondence indicates that Taylor may well have been the force behind the venture.<br>
<br>Beginning the trend for wealthy industrialists to live outside town, Taylor bought land and began rebuilding Bordesley Hall at an eventual cost of &pound;10,000. His rent books from 1754 show properties in Bishops Itchington, Coleshill, Yardley, Bordesley, and Sheldon, with rents from 30<i>s</i>. to &pound;290 annually. By 1765, when he wrote his will, he had forty-three properties including houses, farms, and land, producing an annual income of &pound;872.<br>
<br>Taylor was held in high esteem by his fellow townsmen and he was one of fifty commissioners named in the local <span class="roman">Improvement Act</span> of 1769 for the betterment of Birmingham streets. His participation in a venture was thought to guarantee success. Boulton called him &#145;our great manufacturer&#146;  (Hopkins, 84); he was eulogized by Hutton as &#145;the Shakespeare or Newton of his day&#146;  (ibid.); he was one of the &#145;valuable acquaintances&#146; made by Samuel Johnson; and Boswell noted that Taylor had acquired a fortune &#145;by his ingenuity in mechanical inventions, and success in trade&#146;  (Sayers, 7).<br>
<br>John Taylor died in Bath on 27 March 1775; he was interred in the family vault in St Philip's Church, Birmingham, on 2 April. In his will he bequeathed an annuity of &pound;1600 to his wife; &pound;10,000 and a harpsichord to his daughter Mary; and &pound;8000 each to his younger sons, William and Charles. His properties were left to his eldest son, John, and after various bequests the residue of his estate, reputed to total &pound;200,000, was to be divided equally between the sons. <span class="italic">Aris's Birmingham Gazette</span> described him on 3 April 1775 as &#145;a man to whose extraordinary Ingenuity and indefatigable Diligence, the Trade and Manufactures of this Town are much indebted for their Increase and Estimacion&#146;.<br>
