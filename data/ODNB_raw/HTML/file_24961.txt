<span class="headword">Scrope,  John</span>, fifth Baron Scrope of Bolton  (1437/8&#150;1498), <span class="occ">soldier</span>, was the eldest of the three sons of Henry, fourth Baron Scrope (1418&#150;1459), and Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. in or after 1498), daughter of his kinsman, John, fourth Baron Scrope of Masham, and Elizabeth, daughter of Sir Thomas Chaworth of Wiverton, Nottinghamshire. He was born on 22 July 1437 or 1438. He was first summoned to parliament from July 1460, the year following his father's death, and regularly thereafter, and was knighted at about the same time. Scrope was a supporter of the earl of Salisbury from the very early 1450s, supported his son the earl of Warwick at the battle of Northampton in 1460, and fought for Edward IV at Towton in March 1461, where he was seriously hurt. He then took part in the reduction of the northern Lancastrian strongholds. In 1462&#150;3 he was admitted, with his first wife, Joan, to the Guild of Corpus Christi in York. He was made knight of the Garter before April 1463, captain of Newcastle from December 1463, and was probably at the battle of Hexham in May 1464. He was regularly on the commission of the peace for Cambridgeshire (in which county he held lands) from 1461 until 1484 and frequently on that for the North Riding of Yorkshire.<br>
<br>However, by March 1469 Scrope was supporting the earl of Warwick and was fomenting a rising in Richmondshire on Warwick's behalf. On the collapse of this he submitted to Edward IV and was pardoned, although he again supported Warwick during the short Lancastrian restoration, helping to raise troops in the eastern counties. He seems not to have fought at the battles of Barnet or Tewkesbury though, and to have been quickly forgiven by Edward because on 11 May 1471, that is only a week after Tewkesbury, he was reappointed to the commission of the peace for Cambridge. On 3 July 1471 he was one of those who swore allegiance to Edward, son of Edward IV. In 1474 he was one of the commissioners to negotiate a marriage between the king's youngest daughter, Cecily, with James, son and heir of James III, king of Scots, and stood proxy for her at the betrothal in October of that year. In 1475 he accompanied the king to France with 20 men-at-arms and 200 archers, although before he went he was ordered in May to abstain from using the arms of the Isle of Man for the duration of the expedition, without prejudice to his right to use them, if any. As heir of the attainted William Scrope, earl of Wiltshire, his great-great-uncle, he claimed these arms, which were used by Thomas, Lord Stanley, as the current Lord of Man.<br>
<br>In 1475&#150;6 Scrope went on a mission to Milan and Rome with Earl Rivers. He continued to be appointed to various commissions, for example as commissioner of oyer and terminer in Middlesex in 1477 and of array in the North Riding of Yorkshire in 1480. He was one of the commanders in the army of Richard, duke of Gloucester, invading Scotland in July 1482, leading the van with the earl of Northumberland, and was one of the commissioners who treated with the ambassadors of Alexander, duke of Albany, brother of James III of Scots, in London in February 1483.<br>
<br>Scrope had been a councillor of Richard of Gloucester since at least 1475, and continued in that role after the duke's accession as Richard III. He attended the coronation on 6 July 1483, receiving velvet as a special gift from the king for the queen's coronation and on 24 July was made chamberlain of the duchy of Lancaster for life. In November 1483 he was appointed to a commission of array to resist the rebels and a commission to arrest them. Although he had no previous connection with the area, in December 1484 he was granted a number of manors in the western counties and made constable of Exeter Castle for life, thus becoming one of the northern supporters planted by Richard III in parts of the south to help control them. He was also responsible for the defence of the western coast. He was regularly appointed to the commissions of the peace in Devon and Cornwall in Richard's reign as well as to those of Cambridgeshire and the North Riding of Yorkshire as he had been in previous years, although not after the death of Richard III. He was at sea in March 1484 for the defence of the realm, but was almost certainly with Richard at the battle of Bosworth, although he was not attainted afterwards and he was allowed to attend the Garter banquet in York in April 1486. Scrope supported Lambert Simnel in June 1487, attacking York with his cousin Thomas, Lord Scrope of Masham. After this he was imprisoned in Windsor Castle, and received a pardon in February 1488, although even by July 1489 he was still not allowed to go further north than the River Trent. By 1492 however Scrope was apparently completely rehabilitated and in May 1492 he was retained to go abroad with Henry VII in his invasion of France, and was appointed to the commission of the peace in Norfolk from 1494 until he died. In August 1497 he assisted the earl of Surrey in raising the siege by the Scots of Norham Castle.<br>
<br>Scrope married three times. His first wife, whom he married after 22 November 1447, was Joan, daughter of William, fourth Lord Fitzhugh (<i>d</i>. 1452), and Margery, daughter of William, Lord Willoughby. With her he had one child, his heir, Henry. She died before 1470 and he married second, before 10 December 1471, Elizabeth, daughter of Oliver St John and Margaret Beauchamp, daughter and heir of Sir John Beauchamp of Bletsoe, and widow of William, fifth Baron Zouche. She was living in 1489 and died before 3 July 1494. They had one child, Mary, who married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/61162/', "Sir William Conyers (1467/8&#150;1524) of Hornby")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/52783/', "Conyers family")</script>]. Scrope married third, after 9 February 1491, Anne, daughter and heir of Sir Robert Harling of East Harling, Norfolk, and Jane, daughter and heir of Edmund Gunville, and widow of Sir William Chamberlaine and Sir Robert Wingfield. They had no children and Scrope died, possibly at East Harling, on 17 August 1498. In his will, dated 3 July 1494 and 8 August 1498 (proved on 5 November 1498 at York), he asked to be buried in St Agatha's Abbey, Easby (as had several of his ancestors), or in the Dominican priory at Thetford, depending on where he died. He left a printed <span class="roman">Bible</span> and a volume of chronicles (also printed) to St Agatha's. As his executor he named his wife, who survived him for only a short time, dying on 18 September 1498.<br>
