<span class="headword">Sutton,  John</span>  (1919&#150;1992), <span class="occ">geologist</span>, was born on 8 July 1919 at 100 Esmond Road, Acton, Middlesex, the son of Gerald John Sutton, mechanical engineer, and his wife, Kathleen Alice, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Richard, schoolteacher. His father was an engineer and inventor in the Victorian tradition, who was credited with the development of the gas water-heater and the motor lawnmower, and was one of the team of engineers assembled by Churchill during the Second World War with a general brief to invent unusual warlike devices. His mother was the daughter of a railway engineer and bridge builder in the Burmese government service. She was one of the first women to qualify for a classics degree at Oxford, but as women could not then be admitted she had to wait some years before she could graduate. Meanwhile she taught classics in girls' schools. She was appointed MBE in 1919 for wartime committee service. After attending Gunnersbury preparatory school, Middlesex, and the King's School, Worcester, Sutton went up to Imperial College, London, in 1937 to study general science, and later geology, but his degree was interrupted by war service. This took the form of the rather unexciting supervision of radar stations on the east coast, but he seized the opportunity to take up bird-watching, and to develop a general enthusiasm for nature which never left him.<br>
<br>After the war Sutton returned to Imperial College, graduating in 1946. He then joined the staff as a postgraduate researcher. There he met a fellow geology postgraduate, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/31810/', "Janet Vida Watson (1923&#150;1985)")</script>, daughter of David Meredith Seares Watson, professor of zoology. Sutton and Watson were given adjacent fieldwork areas in the northern highlands of Scotland. They forged a partnership which was to last for the whole of their careers. On 13 June 1949 they married at the register office in Hampstead; they had two daughters, both of whom died at birth. Sutton and Watson formed a brilliant team, their strength being in their difference, not their similarity. Sutton was the extrovert, the broad thinker, the ideas man. Watson was the careful fieldworker, the painstaking recorder of detail, and it was she who wrote the greater part of their joint papers, in which every sentence was carefully weighed and composed. This was a formidable combination.<br>
<br>The earliest Precambrian rocks had long been recognized as a difficult area. In all later geological series, from the Cambrian to the present, relationships can be established partly by fossils and partly by sedimentary sequences. But in the earliest rocks there are no fossils, and sedimentary relations are seldom seen. The rocks are mainly gneisses, altered from their original states by the processes of metamorphism. The contribution of Sutton and Watson was to show that relationships in the Precambrian are to be established in terms of metamorphic events, not stratigraphic sequences. They identified an older metamorphic episode, the Scourian, later shown to be about 2600 million years old, and a later, the Laxfordian, about 1700 million years old. This discovery opened up a new way of looking at Precambrian complexes, and a new technique for deciphering their geology. The methods which they pioneered were applied by others to basement rocks in many parts of the world.<br>
<br>The whole of Sutton's working life was spent at Imperial College, where he was appointed lecturer in the geology department in 1948, prior to completing his postgraduate research. He was promoted to reader in 1956, to professor of geology in 1958, and to head of department in 1964. He served a three-year period as dean of the Royal School of Mines in 1965&#150;8 and again in 1974&#150;7, and he left the geology department on his appointment as pro-rector in 1980. The rector at that time was Sir Brian Flowers, and he and Sutton formed a powerful administrative team. On his retirement in 1983 at the age of sixty-four he was confirmed as emeritus professor and fellow of Imperial College. He had been elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1966 (vice-president, 1975&#150;7).<br>
<br>One of Sutton's great virtues was his infectious enthusiasm, which inspired all he met, and he was inevitably drawn into committee work, administration, and science policy debates. He was president of the Geologists' Association 1966&#150;8, and after serving for many years as external examiner he was a member of the council of the University of Rhodesia/Zimbabwe from 1976 to 1983. He gave a long period of service from 1964 to 1985 to the scholarships committee of the Royal Commission for the Exhibition of 1851, and he was a trustee of the Natural History Museum 1976&#150;81. He was the first chairman of the Imperial College Centre for Environmental Technology, a cross-departmental research facility of which he was joint founder in 1977, and was president of the Remote Sensing Society 1977&#150;84. From 1976 to 1979 he served as a council member of the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC), and he was involved in the fundamental changes which were made to the status of the geological survey, which for a hundred years had reported directly to a government minister, but which was now made subordinate to the NERC. The direct grant previously enjoyed by the survey was replaced at that time by the customer-contractor principle set out in the Rothschild Report of 1971.<br>
<br>Towards the end of his career Sutton made an important contribution when he was appointed by the Royal Society to develop a renewed relationship with the scientific community in China. This started with the visit of a party of six fellows to Beijing (Peking) in 1973; there were several other visits over the next few years, and student exchanges were followed by the establishment of joint research programmes. These efforts culminated in 1985 with the great Tibet geotraverse, in which a party of twenty-five geologists from many countries undertook an arduous ten-week traverse of the Tibet Himalayas, covering a distance of 600 miles, usually at over 10,000 feet above sea level.<br>
<br>Sutton's retirement was marred by the death in March 1985 of his first wife, Janet Watson. On 21 August 1985 he married (Millicent) Betty Middleton-Sandford (<i>b</i>. 1932), artist, daughter of James Middleton Honeychurch, master tailor. They enjoyed a period of country living in Cornwall and then Dorset, but this was cut short by illness, and Sutton died of cancer on 6 September 1992 at the Weymouth and District Hospital, Weymouth, Dorset. He was buried on 15 September 1992 at Martinstown parish church, a few miles west of Dorchester. He was survived by his second wife.<br>
