<span class="headword">Boyd,  Benjamin</span>  (1801&#150;1851), <span class="occ">stockbroker and entrepreneur</span>, was born on 21 August 1801, in the parish of St Peter Le Pauvre, London, second son of Edward Boyd (1770?&#150;1844), merchant, and his wife, Janet, daughter of Benjamin Yule, of Wheatfield, Midlothian. By 1808 the family had moved from Surrey to an ancestral seat&#151;Merton Hall, near Newton Stewart, in Wigtownshire, Scotland&#151;where seven surviving sons and three surviving daughters were raised and educated.<br>
<br>Edward Boyd had substantial overseas commercial interests, and his eldest son achieved seniority in the East India Company. In 1825 Benjamin joined the London stock exchange, and by the late 1830s he was a director of the North British Insurance Company, the St George Steam Packet Company, the London Reversionary Interest Society and&#151;with James Matheson and others&#151;the Union Bank of London. Tall, charming, capable, and commanding, Boyd moved in the highest society, his lively intellect enhancing a natural charisma. Even one of the Rothschilds confessed to being captivated, regardless that in their negotiations &#145;I always lose money by him; he is such a screw&#146;  (Boyd, 94).<br>
<br>In October 1840 Boyd outlined to the Colonial Office his maturing plans for &#145;further developing the resources of Australia and its adjacent islands&#146;  (<span class="italic">Historical Records of Australia</span>, 21.54&#150;6). He was assured of ready assistance for his proposals to introduce a steamship service (requiring ancillary harbours and coaling stations) between Antipodean settlements; but the response to his enquiries about the possible status of personal territory he might acquire in the south seas was equivocal. In preparation for these activities the Royal Bank of Australia had been floated in March 1840 with a nominal capital of &pound;1 million. Boyd, its chairman, held 6000 of its &pound;50 shares, which carried a guaranteed dividend of 5 per cent for five years. He was also a director (and his brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/3108/', "Mark Boyd")</script> the manager) of the Australian Wool Company, and of a private company, Boyd Brothers, both formed in November 1840. Dexterous financial shuffling created further ambiguous commitments. In substance the bank exchanged debentures with the wool company, transferring the considerable difference to Boyd, in cash. The North British Insurance Company advanced him &pound;27,000 against other debentures, and the Union Bank lent the Royal Bank &pound;30,000. The St George Steam Packet Company bought steamships with funds provided by the Union Bank.<br>
<br>Boyd set out for Australia in his superb, heavily armed, Royal Yacht Squadron brig <i>Wanderer</i> in October 1841. Among its company were his brother James, the artist Oswald Brierly, and Henry Sewell. Having reached Port Phillip on 10 June 1842, Boyd arrived at Sydney on 18 July and set up headquarters at Neutral Bay. Three steamships had preceded him, carrying passengers (including his brother Curwen), cargoes, supplies, bank personnel, and cash. A rudimentary steamship service was already under way, depending for re-coaling on Twofold Bay, south of Sydney. There, Boyd speedily developed a settlement at Boydtown, established a whaling station, and acquired extensive grazing rights in the hinterland. From Twofold Bay livestock, wool, and whaling produce were eventually shipped to Sydney, London, and other markets.<br>
<br>Boyd had arrived in New South Wales on the eve of a cataclysmic depression. Economic conditions and rampant hostility towards London banks required the diversion of Royal Bank funds into dependable assets, and by mid-1844 Boyd had acquired rights to over 400,000 acres of prime land. As a major landholder he successfully rallied opposition to the moderate land reforms of Governor George Gipps, and for a year from September 1844 he represented the independent-minded Port Phillip district in the New South Wales legislative council. He was also foundation president, in 1844, of the influential Pastoralists' Association that sent his squatter cousin, Archibald Boyd, to lobby in London, where colonial land and emigration issues were also canvassed by Mark Boyd and fellow investors. Employing hundreds of workers in various capacities, and with thousands of stock requiring supervision to make landholding viable, Boyd campaigned for cheaper labour, proposing the transfer of convicts from Van Diemen's Land, and finally importing Pacific islanders, with disastrous results. By 1847 Boyd's resources were desperately over-extended and restive Royal Bank shareholders replaced him with his cousin William Sprott Boyd, who arrived in Sydney in March 1848. The precipitate selling of his assets reportedly made Benjamin Boyd half-deranged; and, having safeguarded his own investment, his cousin William departed in early 1849, to be replaced by a liquidator.<br>
<br>On 26 October 1849 Boyd left Sydney in the <i>Wanderer</i> for the California goldfields. On 3 June 1851 he sailed from San Francisco to cruise in the Pacific, intent on finding a &#145;Papuan&#146; base or &#145;republic&#146;. At San Cristobal in the Solomon Islands he decided to negotiate for &#145;a tract of land, including Makira [Bay] for future commercial purposes&#146;  (Webster, 101), possibly mining for gold. However, on 15 October 1851 Boyd and a crew member failed to return from an early morning shore visit at the neighbouring island of Guadalcanal. After repulsing a native attack, the <i>Wanderer</i> set course for Australia, having failed to find positive evidence of Boyd's fate. When the crippled vessel was wrecked off Port Macquarie, Boyd's highland dress costume, his <span class="roman">Bible</span>, and a woman's portrait were salvaged. His estate, valued at less than &pound;3000, passed to his creditor, the defunct Royal Bank of Australia.<br>
