<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Simpson,  William</span>  (1823&#150;1899), <span class="occ">watercolour painter and journalist</span>, was born on 28 October 1823 in a tenement in Carrick Street, Glasgow, the son of James Simpson (1791&#150;1879), a marine engineer and mechanic, and his wife, Ann Johnstone (1786&#150;1854). He spent fifteen months at a writing-school in Perth but thereafter received no regular education. From January 1837 he trained as a lithographer under David Macfarlane in an architect's office in Glasgow. In August or September 1839 he left Macfarlane and from 1840 was apprenticed to the lithographers Allan and Ferguson. Commissioned by David Allan, Simpson sketched the city's old buildings for Robert Stuart's <span class="italic">Views and Notices of Glasgow in Former Times (Stuart's Glasgow)</span> (1848). He attended the Glasgow School of Design from 1845 and sold his first watercolour in 1850. In 1851 he moved to London and worked for the lithographers Day &amp; Son.<br>
<br>During the Crimean War Simpson became a pioneer war artist: dispatched by the printsellers Colnaghi &amp; Son (on Day's recommendation), he recorded the naval battles in the Baltic Sea and then went on to Balaklava in November 1854 to make accurate sketches on the spot. The drawings which he made during that terrible winter were submitted to Lord Raglan, sent home to England, and shown to Queen Victoria by the minister of war, the duke of Newcastle. After the fall of Sevastopol he was attached to the duke's party of exploration in Circassia. Eighty of his Crimean drawings were lithographed in <span class="italic">The Seat of War in the East</span> (2 vols., 1855&#150;6), which was dedicated with permission to Queen Victoria. When the original watercolours were exhibited at Colnaghi's gallery, Lord Elcho and other MPs called for them to be bought by the nation as a historic record of the war. On the advice of Sir Charles Eastlake, this proposal was rejected and the watercolours were sold off separately. Simpson returned to England with a brown beard long enough to button into his waistcoat, and he had an audience with the queen: he showed her his sketches and was much impressed by her grasp of every detail of the war. She commissioned <span class="italic">The Queen Reviewing the Royal Artillery at Woolwich on their Return from the Crimea, 1856</span>, and over the next thirty years was a steady patron for the painter.<br>
<br>After the Indian mutiny Day &amp; Son sent Simpson to India on a roving commission, to make studies for a large-scale illustrated book. He arrived in October 1859 and joined the party of the governor-general, Lord Canning, on a tour of the area where the mutiny had taken place; he also sketched with Lady Canning. Over three years he visited much of the subcontinent, including Tibet and its Buddhist temples, the Himalayas, Kashmir, and Ceylon. When he returned to England in 1862, he had travelled 22,570 miles. He settled in chambers in London at 64 Lincoln's Inn Fields, worked for four years on Day's project, and completed 250 drawings. However, when the firm of Day &amp; Son went into liquidation, his Indian watercolours were taken over and sold off as bankrupt stock: Simpson received no recompense for seven years of hard work. Finally, fifty paintings were indifferently reproduced in a book with text by Sir John Kaye.<br>
<br>In 1866, through William Ingram, editor and proprietor of the <span class="italic">Illustrated London News</span>, Simpson became a special artist for the paper, a role for which he was specially suited. After twenty-five years' service for the <span class="italic">Illustrated London News</span> he wrote:<blockquote>I have at all times felt that I was not seeing for myself alone, but that others would see through my eyes, and that eyes yet unborn would, in the pages of the <span class="italic">Illustrated London News</span>, do the same. This feeling has at all times urged on my mind the necessity for accuracy. (<span class="italic">ILN</span>, 14 May 1892, 604)</blockquote>He covered many royal events for the paper. In the autumn of 1866 he went to Dunrobin in Scotland to record the prince of Wales's visit to the duke of Sutherland. At St Petersburg in November 1866 he illustrated the marriage of the tsarevich (later Alexander III) to Princess Dagmar, sister of the princess of Wales, and he accompanied the prince and princess of Wales to Egypt in 1868. In 1875&#150;6 he covered the visit of the prince of Wales to India for the <span class="italic">Illustrated London News</span> and made over 200 sketches, mostly in sepia with some watercolour. The queen and prince acquired a number of these and a collection, <span class="italic">Shik&#257;re and Tam&#257;sha: a Souvenir of the Visit of the Prince of Wales to India</span>, was published in 1876; forty-four of Simpson's Indian watercolours are in the Victoria and Albert Museum, London. His last commission from Queen Victoria was in 1889, but for the prince of Wales he drew scenes relating to the death of the duke of Clarence in 1892. He visited Balmoral and Abergeldie castles and Sandringham and was on friendly terms with both the queen and the prince of Wales; fifty of his works are in the Royal Collection.<br>
<br>Simpson travelled round the world for the <span class="italic">Illustrated London News</span>, and his <span class="italic">Autobiography</span> (1903) describes his surroundings with clarity and passionate interest. Sketches sent home from abroad were worked up into watercolours on his return. On location he wisely disguised himself by wearing local native costume, a masquerade he obviously enjoyed. As an observer and reporter for over forty years, he had contacts and friends all over the world; he mixed with people of every rank and learned many European and oriental languages and dialects needed on his innumerable travels. In 1868 he accompanied Lord Napier on the Abyssinian expedition: he made archaeological sketches to illustrate the Palestine exploration fund's excavations in the Holy Land, was granted permission to sketch inside the Dome of the Rock, and in 1869 attended the Vatican Council in Rome. He returned to Constantinople to revisit the Crimea, and was present at the opening of the Suez Canal in November 1869. In 1870, at the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War, Simpson travelled to Metz and was briefly imprisoned. (Fortunately he had made his drawings on cigarette paper so that, when he was arrested as a spy, he could smoke them in front of his captors.) During the Paris commune he was under fire, and he witnessed harrowing scenes there before returning to London in June 1871. In 1872&#150;3 he went round the world; he visited China to illustrate the marriage of the emperor Tongzhi and saw the Great Wall and the Ming tombs before travelling on via Japan to San Francisco. He was the only eyewitness reporter on the spot able to cover the rebellion of the Modoc Indians, and he visited Salt Lake City, Kentucky, New York, and Niagara, before returning to Liverpool in June 1873. He describes his travels in <span class="italic">Meeting the Sun: a Journey All Round the World</span> (1874). In 1877 he made sketches of the Schliemann excavations at Troy and Ephesus. He also covered the Second Anglo-Afghan War of 1878&#150;80 and was with the Afghan boundary commission in 1884&#150;5.<br>
<br>Simpson became a good amateur archaeologist, had a profound interest in religions, and was a prolific writer. His published works include <span class="italic">Picturesque People</span> (1876), <span class="italic">The Buddhist Prayer Wheel</span> (1896), <span class="italic">The Jonah Legend</span> (1899), <span class="italic">Glasgow in the Forties</span> (1899), and many articles, including papers on freemasonry in the <span class="italic">Transactions</span> of that society, into which he was initiated in 1871. Probably because of the peripatetic life he led it was not until 5 January 1881 that he married the miniature painter Maria Eliza Burt, daughter of Thomas Burt, a contractor's agent; about 1884 the couple had one beloved daughter, Ann Penelope. Simpson became an associate of the Institute of Painters in Water Colours in 1874 and a full member in 1879; he exhibited fifty-nine watercolours between 1874 and 1899. An original member of the Institute of Painters in Oil Colours in 1883, he resigned in 1886. He was also an FRGS, an honorary associate of the Royal Institute of British Architects, and a founder member of the Society of Biblical Archaeology. Simpson spent his last years writing his <span class="italic">Autobiography</span>, which he stipulated should not be published until after his death, which took place on 17 August 1899 at his home, 19 Church Road, Willesden, London. He was buried in Highgate cemetery, Middlesex.<br>
