<span class="headword">Bokenham,  Osbern</span>  (<em>b. </em>1392/3, <em>d.</em> in or after 1464), <span class="occ">poet and Augustinian friar</span>, was born on 6 October 1393, or possibly 1392. He was a friar at the convent of Stoke by Clare in Suffolk. Most of the little that is known about his life is derived from his best-known and most substantial work, <span class="italic">Legendys of Hooly Wummen</span>. There he ends his life of St Faith by remarking that he was born on her feast day, and in the life of St Margaret of Antioch (begun on 7 September 1443) he says that his mortal thread has lasted &#145;ful yerys fyfty&#146;. His birthplace was, he says, &#145;even by&#146; an &#145;old priory of black canons&#146;: it was most probably Old Buckenham (Bokenham) in Norfolk, just north of the Suffolk border. He says himself that he was an Augustinian friar, and that he brought his translation of the life of St Margaret back to Clare. The <i>explicit</i> in the manuscript of the <span class="italic">Legendys</span> describes the translator as &#145;a doctor of dyuinite clepyd Osbern Bokenham frere austin of the convent of Stokeclare&#146; (and a later hand has added &#145;a suffolk man&#146;). His degree of DTh may have been obtained at Cambridge. He seems to take a quiet pride in being &#145;a Suffolk man&#146;&#151;he ends an apology for his lack of rhetorical skill with the words:<blockquote>
<div>&thorn;erfore spekyn &amp; wrytyn I wyl pleynly<br>
</div>
<div>Aftyr &thorn;e language of Suthfolk speche;<br>
</div>
<div>And who-so-euere lyke not &thorn;er-by,<br>
</div>
<div>Whereeuyr he lyst he bettyr do seche.<br>
</div> (Bokenham, <span class="italic">Legendys</span>, 111, ll.4063&#150;6)</blockquote>Yet he was something of a traveller, it seems. He was in Italy at least twice. In 1423 he was granted permission to visit by the prior-general, and he was there again in 1438&#151;the date is established by his remark in the prologue (begun in September 1443) that five years earlier he had been in Venice. On this occasion (&#145;the laste tyme I was in Itayle&#146;) he learned the story of St Margaret and her relics. On his way back from Rome he was delayed by heavy rain at Montefiascone (&#145;Mownt Flask&#146;), where he visited the virgin. (Relics of St Margaret had been brought from the East to this part of Italy in the twelfth century, and were later taken to Venice.) Elsewhere in the <span class="italic">Legendys</span> he tells us that he went on pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela (1445). That his name continues to appear in the registers of the order in 1461, 1463, and 1464, twice as one of the vicars-general for the provincial chapter, disproves the earlier belief that he died in 1447. Bokenham seems to have been widely read, especially in hagiographical literature. He refers in passing (usually in asseverations of his lack of eloquence) to a few ancient authors, and several times expresses admiration for the work of Chaucer and Gower, &#145;and now&#146; Lydgate. He also mentions John Capgrave's <span class="italic">St Katharine</span>.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">Legendys of Hooly Wummen</span> survives in one manuscript, BL, Arundel MS 327 (copied in Cambridge in 1447 on the instructions of his &#145;son&#146; Friar Thomas Burgh, probably a member of the convent at Cambridge), which was composed between 7 September 1443 and 1447. It is an ambitious work of 10,616 lines, and relates thirteen legends (adapted from various Latin sources), a number of them dedicated to a special friend and patron, usually from the area around Clare: St Margaret (written at the request of Thomas Burgh); St Anne (for Katherine Denston and her husband, John, of Melford, who had a daughter of that name); St Christina; the 11,000 virgins; St Faith; St Agnes; St Dorothy (for John Hunt and his wife, Isabel); St Mary Magdalen (at the request&#151;on twelfth night 1445&#151;of Lady Isabel Bourchier, countess of Eu, the sister of the duke of York); St Katherine (for Katherine Howard, probably the wife of John Howard of Stoke Neyland near Clare, who later became duke of Norfolk); St Cecilia; St Agatha (for Agatha Flegge); St Lucy; and St Elizabeth (at the request of Lady Elizabeth de Vere, countess of Oxford, who was related to John Howard). The poem shows that Bokenham was a noted local writer and offers a glimpse into East Anglian patronage of devotional literature, and it has other points of interest&#151;as a collection of the lives of women saints (although it is not clear that it was consciously planned as such), as an example of translation and adaptation of sources, and as a hagiographical work. In general literary historians have not rated it highly, except for its interesting and attractive personal passages. However it is an eloquent work, which often does justice to the marvels of the legends.<br>
<br>A number of other works can be attributed to Bokenham with some confidence. The <span class="italic">Mappula Angliae</span> (probably composed before 1445, surviving in BL, Harley MS 4011) is a prose translation of the section on England in Higden's <span class="italic">Polychronicon</span>. The initial letters of the chapters spell out Bokenham's name. He is probably the author of a translation into long unrhymed lines of part of Claudian's <span class="italic">De consulatu Stilichonis</span>  (BL, Add. MS 11814) made at Clare in 1445, and dedicated to the duke of York. A dialogue &#145;betwix a Seculer &hellip; and a Frere&#146;, which demonstrates &#145;the lyneal descent of the lordis of the honoure of Clare&#146; from 1248 to 1456, a genealogy of the house of York in both Latin and English verse preserved by Dugdale  (Dugdale, <span class="italic">Monasticon</span>, 6.1600) has been attributed to him on stylistic grounds, and would again suggest strongly Yorkist connections. If he is the Bokenhamus of the Latin <span class="italic">Liber de angelis, annuli characteribus et imaginibus planetarum</span>, a tract on astrology in CUL, MS Dd.9.45, it would indicate that he also had a scientific interest. There are two clear references to works that have been lost. In the <span class="italic">Mappula Angliae</span> he speaks of &#145;the englishe boke the which I have compiled of legenda aurea and of other famous legendes at the instaunce of my specialle frendis&#146; (mentioning specifically Ceadda, Felix, Edward, Oswald, and &#145;many o&thorn;er seyntis of Englond&#146;  (<span class="italic">Mappula</span>, ed. Horstmann, 6) to which his translation is to provide a geographical guide. It has been claimed that a remark in his legend of St Anne indicates that he wrote a Latin poem in praise of the Virgin Mary. He refers the reader to Lydgate's English <span class="italic">Life of Our Lady</span> and to a Latin work in ten books &#145;Of &thorn;e Weddynge Dytees&#146;, although he does not there claim that as his. But at the end of the legend he does speak of a Latin poem he had composed: he remarks that Anne had three daughters all called Mary:<blockquote>
<div>but whe&thorn;er be oon husbonde or ellys be thre,<br>
</div>
<div>At &thorn;is tyme I wil not determyne,<br>
</div>
<div>For in &thorn;is mater what best plesyth me<br>
</div>
<div>I haue as I can declaryd in latyn<br>
</div>
<div>In balaade-ryme.<br>
</div> (Bokenham, <span class="italic">Legendys</span>, 57, ll. 2078&#150;82)</blockquote>This could have been a poem on the childhood of Mary or a life of St Anne.<br>
