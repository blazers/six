<span class="headword">Alice, Princess</span>, duchess of Gloucester  (1901&#150;2004), <span class="occ"></span> was born Lady Alice Cristabel Montagu-Douglas-Scott on 25 December 1901 at Montagu House, London, the fifth child and third daughter of John Charles-Montagu-Douglas Scott, earl of Dalkeith, and from 1914 seventh duke of Buccleuch and ninth duke of Queensberry (1864&#150;1935), and his wife, Margaret Alice (1872&#150;1954), daughter of George Cecil Orlando Bridgeman, fourth earl of Bradford. She was brought up in circumstances of stupefying grandeur, progressing from one to another of the Buccleuchs' great family seats. Unusually for a girl of her class and generation she went to a boarding school, and not a particularly fashionable one, St James's at West Malvern. She acquired no academic aspiration, but equally found the life of a d&eacute;butante in London unsatisfactorily sterile&#151;she was happiest when fishing and hunting on the Dumfriesshire moors.<br>
<br>In 1924 Alice paid her first visit to Africa, a continent for which she conceived a lasting affection. She spent long periods with her paternal uncle, Lord Francis Scott, who farmed in Kenya, and became a self-taught but highly competent watercolourist. She was an intrepid traveller&#151;once, disguised as a boy, smuggling herself into one of the forbidden areas of Afghanistan. She returned unscathed, but there was much indignation in official circles when news of her exploit leaked out. She finally settled back in Britain in 1935. Her father's failing health was the immediate cause but, when she was fourteen, she had had a narrow escape from drowning and had promised God that, if he saved her, she would dedicate her life to some &#145;superior and useful purpose&#146;. She decided that the time had now come to honour her pledge.<br>
<br>It was that sense of duty which was in part responsible for Alice's engagement to <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/31220/', "Prince Henry, first duke of Gloucester (1900&#150;1974)")</script>, third son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/33369/', "George V")</script>. It was intended that the marriage should be celebrated in Westminster Abbey on 6 November 1935, but her father died only two and a half weeks before, so a private ceremony in the chapel of Buckingham Palace was substituted. The king died shortly afterwards and the abdication of King Edward VIII at the end of 1936 meant that the duke of Gloucester became regent apparent, a role that effectively put an end to his military career. The Gloucesters, at the request of the prime minister, Neville Chamberlain, were the first members of the royal family to call on the duke and duchess of Windsor in their exile; the hostile response that the visit evoked among press and public convinced the government that it was too early for the Windsors to return to Britain. The Gloucesters' elder son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/31832/', "Prince William")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/31220/', "Henry, Prince, first duke of Gloucester")</script>], was born in 1941 and their second son, Prince Richard, in 1944.<br>
<br>After her marriage Princess Alice plunged wholeheartedly into the official duties that, even in the 1930s, were imposed on members of the royal family. Some represented her private enthusiasms&#151;her presidency of the Royal Academy of Music reflected her serious interest in the subject; others, such as Invalid Kitchens, in time to become Meals on Wheels, were ideas new to her, but were none the less conscientiously supported for that reason.<br>
<br>The Second World War greatly extended Princess Alice's responsibilities: she was already commandant of the St John's Ambulance Association; now she became also president of the hospital supply board of the Red Cross. In 1940 she was appointed air chief commandant of the Women's Auxiliary Air Force. She travelled widely around the country, including a visit to Coventry two days after the devastating blitz. She rarely accompanied her husband on such expeditions but one occasion when they were together was in Belfast in April 1941. The visit, planned months in advance, chanced to take place the day after Belfast had its first and most devastating air raid. Their welcome was tumultuous and their presence did much to raise morale in the stricken city.<br>
<br>Early in 1945 the duke of Gloucester was appointed governor-general in Australia. It was a testing task, since many Australians would have been quick to resent anything that seemed like condescension or excessive interference. The presence of the duchess with her two young sons, her friendliness, unfeigned interest in all she saw, and obvious enthusiasm for the country, immeasurably eased her husband's three years in the post.<br>
<br>Once they were back in England, Alice's official duties grew no less, but her life began increasingly to centre on Barnwell Manor, the Northamptonshire house that the Gloucesters had bought in 1938. In 1965 she and the duke had a bad motor accident. She was seriously injured; her husband, who seemed at first to have escaped unscathed, in fact suffered the first of what was to be a series of progressively more damaging strokes. Within a few years he had been reduced to frustrating inactivity. He died in 1974; two years earlier their elder son, Prince William, had been killed while piloting his plane in the Goodyear air race. In spite of these tragedies the duchess remained active for another twenty years. In 1995 the family left Barnwell, and the rest of her life was spent in the apartments in Kensington Palace which she shared with her younger son, Prince Richard, duke of Gloucester, and his family. It was there that, at the age of 102, the oldest member of the royal family in recorded history, she died of heart failure and old age on 29 October 2004; she was buried at Frogmore, Windsor, on 5 November.<br>
