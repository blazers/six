<span class="headword">Culshaw,  John Royds</span>  (1924&#150;1980), <span class="occ">record producer and television executive</span>, was born on 28 May 1924 at 47 Lethbridge Road, Southport, Lancashire, one of at least two children of Percy Ellis Culshaw, banker's clerk, and his wife, Dorothy Royds. He attended first the Merchant Taylors' School in Crosby and then the King George V Grammar School in Southport, and at the age of sixteen followed his father as a clerk with the Midland Bank. He studied the piano from an early age, but became increasingly dissatisfied with his own musical abilities, and, with encouragement from his mother, developed a deep interest in concert performance and opera.<br>
<br>Culshaw began his war service in 1942 joining the Fleet Air Arm as a volunteer and serving in Trinidad and Europe. While still in the services he attended a concert given by the great Russian composer Sergey Rakhmaninov, and this helped forge the direction of his subsequent career. In November 1946, after his discharge from the services, Culshaw joined the Decca Record Company's publicity department, writing sleeve notes for classical music records. The following year he began work on a biography of Rakhmaninov (published in 1949). In the same year his book on Brahms appeared, as well as a popular introduction to the concerto, and a guide to the main developments of contemporary music.<br>
<br>The failure of his period as editor of the Decca house magazine <span class="italic">Music</span>, however, convinced Culshaw that his real talents lay elsewhere, and by the end of 1947 he had completed his first recording sessions at Decca as a record producer. During these early years as a Decca producer he made several notable recordings, such as Richard Strauss's <span class="italic">Arabella</span> and Charles Gounod's <span class="italic">Romeo and Juliet</span>. Culshaw left Decca in 1954 and went to work for the Hollywood-based Capitol Records, then expanding its classical recording programme. There he made several important records including one of the then comparatively unknown Hungarian conductor Georg Solti conducting a performance of the Brahms <span class="roman">Requiem</span>. He also undertook a series of remarkable recordings of performances by Eduard van Beinum and the Concertgebouw Orchestra of Amsterdam. Culshaw's greatest contribution to recorded culture, however, was to take up the best part of the decade after 1957.<br>
<br>In 1956 Culshaw returned to Decca as manager of the classical record department, having persuaded a reluctant Maurice Rosengarten, then executive manager of the Decca record business, to allow him to produce the first complete stereo recording of Richard Wagner's <span class="italic">Ring</span> cycle, with Georg Solti conducting. The first of the four operas, <span class="italic">Rheingold</span>, was released in 1958, and, according to Culshaw, in the following year it sold more copies than Elvis Presley LPs. Making this mammoth series Culshaw called on the latest recording technology, including stereophonic sound. The recording, &#145;with its brilliant use of sound effects and aural perspectives, heralded a new era&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 29 April 1980). Culshaw later documented the hilarious details of this momentous event in a book entitled <span class="italic">Ring Resounding: the Recording in Stereo of Der Ring des Nibelungen</span> (1967).<br>
<br>By the time the project was complete, Culshaw had established himself as one of the world's great record producers. For this work, he was made an OBE in 1966. He subsequently recorded most of the major operas in the repertoire. In addition he received numerous other awards including several prestigious grand prix de disques from the French industry. Moreover, the <span class="italic">Ring</span> recordings proved to a sceptical music industry that classical music could be successfully encapsulated on disc: a factor that helped ensure the proliferation of a broad range of classical music available on record.<br>
<br>In 1967, after completing his <span class="italic">Ring</span> cycle, Culshaw moved into the medium of television, becoming head of music at BBC television, thus combining his twin passions for music and visual media. While at the BBC he forged an important working relationship with Benjamin Britten. He persuaded Britten to conduct a television performance of his opera <span class="italic">Peter Grimes</span> and further he commissioned Britten to write a new opera, <span class="italic">Owen Wingrave</span>, for the BBC. Culshaw was invited to Snape in Suffolk and reported positively to Britten on the possibilities of transforming The Maltings into a concert-hall, writing that:<blockquote>there was a feeling about the place, about its setting by the river with the view of Iken church through the reeds and across the marshes that made it right. If Ben was to have a concert hall on his doorstep, this was it. (Carpenter, 456)</blockquote>Culshaw later initiated the Benson and Hedges music festival at Snape (and was planning the fourth season at the time of his death).<br>
<br>During his time with the BBC, Culshaw did much to broaden the availability and the appreciation of classical music on television. In 1975 Culshaw left the BBC and the same year was elected to the Arts Council of Great Britain. He pursued a writing and lecturing career, and in 1977 became a senior fellow in the creative arts at the University of Western Australia. He also took on the responsibility for the annual United Nations concert in New York, and acted as a music consultant to the Australian Broadcasting Commission.<br>
<br>Throughout his life John Culshaw combined personal ambition with a love of recorded music, but he was not without his critics. Donald Mitchell commented unfavourably on the way in which Culshaw courted Britten's favour:<blockquote>The manipulative side of it was all too transparent. John certainly made an innovative and influential contribution to the record industry, and we must all be indebted to him for his historic series of Britten recordings. But at the BBC he seemed to me to be out of his depth. (Carpenter, 504)</blockquote>Nevertheless, he had an ingenuity and a persuasive personality which mostly won him the friendship and respect of colleagues and artistes alike. He made a lasting contribution to the record industry and television, and left a priceless heritage for the listening public.Culshaw died of cirrhosis and hepatitis on 27 April 1980 at the Royal Free Hospital, London. He never married. His autobiography, which was in the final stage of completion when he died, contains much of interest about the man and the industries he dominated. It was published under the title of <span class="italic">Putting the Record Straight</span>. The work provides a remarkable insight into the difficulties encountered when highly creative individuals are forced to work together to produce a commercial product. In a glowing obituary <span class="italic">The Times</span> noted that &#145;The immense proliferation of classical recordings now available to all, at comparatively low cost, can be directly attributed to Culshaw's pioneering and imaginative work&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 29 April 1980).<br>
