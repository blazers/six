<span class="headword">Peterkin,  Alexander</span>  (1781&#150;1846), <span class="occ">writer</span>, was born on 26 March 1781 at Macduff, Banffshire, the fifth of eight children of William Peterkin (<i>d</i>. 1792), minister of the chapel of ease there, and his wife, Isabel Irvine (<i>d</i>. 1810). After education at the parish school in Ecclesmachan, Linlithgowshire, to which his father was translated in 1787 after a brief ministry in Leadhills (1785&#150;7), Alexander went on to attend classes at Edinburgh University, where he studied law. In 1803 he enrolled in the first regiment of Royal Edinburgh volunteers. Peterkin married, on 20 December 1807, Charlotte Giles, with whom he had two sons and five daughters. After training in the office of a writer to the signet, Peterkin qualified as a solicitor before the supreme courts and he began his professional career in Peterhead some time before 1811. In 1814 he was appointed sheriff-substitute of Orkney. Peterkin developed a great interest in the affairs of Orkney and his antiquarian researches resulted in the publication of <span class="italic">Rentals of the Ancient Earldom and Bishoprick of Orkney</span> (1820) and <span class="italic">Notes on Orkney and Zetland</span> (1822). However, it was not his views on Orkney's past, but his reflections on its present circumstances, that proved so offensive to many, and the latter work provoked an indignant response in the form of a <span class="italic">Vindication of Orkney</span> (1823). This railed against his depiction of landowners as tyrants and the system of agriculture as barbarous, concluding &#145;remove all its egotism and malevolence against Orkney, and you expunge all its contents&#146;  (Traill, 56). The reaction culminated in his dismissal as sheriff-substitute in 1823. Peterkin was not disposed to let the matter rest, and raised an action of damages against Samuel Laing of Papdale and James Baikie of Tankerness as the persons he held responsible for the libels which led to his dismissal. The action ground on inconclusively for years. From 1824 to 1826 Peterkin published the <span class="italic">Orkney and Zetland Chronicle</span> from Edinburgh, &#145;a very able but short-lived magazine, extending only to nineteen numbers&#146;  (Hossack, 109), with the aim of winning the parliamentary vote for Shetlanders.<br>
<br>Peterkin now combined journalism with legal work and was connected with newspapers in Belfast and Perth. From 1833 to 1835 he edited the <span class="italic">Kelso Chronicle</span>. He distinguished himself as the editor of <span class="italic">The Booke of the Universalle Kirk of Scotland</span> (1839) and with <span class="italic">The Records of the Church of Scotland</span> (1838) and <span class="italic">The Constitution of the Church of Scotland as Established at the Revolution, 1689&#150;90</span> (1841). As a spirited controversialist, Peterkin advanced the views of a &#145;whig of 1688&#146;. His special expertise in ecclesiastical history and law was naturally drawn upon during the years of conflict that preceded the Disruption in the Church of Scotland in 1843. He opposed the claims of the non-intrusion party throughout and acted as agent for the seven suspended ministers in the presbytery of Strathbogie.<br>
<br>Among Peterkin's earlier publications were an edition, with biographical sketch, of Robert Fergusson's <span class="italic">Works</span> (1807) and a reprint, with critical preface, of James Currie's <span class="italic">The Life and Works of Robert Burns</span> (1815), in which he took issue with Currie's view of Burns's supposed over-indulgence in alcohol. Peterkin died at his home, 27 Buccleuch Place, Edinburgh, on 9 November 1846. His elder son, <a name="cosubject_22021"></a><span class="headword">Alexander Peterkin</span>  (1814&#150;1889)<span class="occ"></span>, was successively editor of the <span class="italic">Berwick Advertiser</span>, sub-editor of the <span class="italic">Edinburgh Advertiser</span>, and on the staff of <span class="italic">The Times</span>, from which he retired about 1853 on health grounds.<br>
