<span class="headword">Cowan, Sir  Robert</span>  (1932&#150;1993), <span class="occ">businessman and public servant</span>, was born on 27 July 1932 at Inverleith, Edinburgh, the youngest child and only son of John McQueen Cowan (1892&#150;1960) and his wife, Adeline May, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Organe (<i>d</i>. 1981). His father, a distinguished botanist on the staff of the Royal Botanic Garden, subsequently became curator of the National Trust for Scotland's famous garden at Inverewe in Wester Ross. His mother, also a keen botanist, described this remarkable garden in her book <span class="italic">Inverewe: a Garden in the North-West Highlands</span> (1964). Cowan was educated at Edinburgh Academy and Edinburgh University, where he graduated in economics. In 1959 he married Margaret Morton, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Dewar (<i>b</i>. 1933), also an Edinburgh graduate and a Scot from Ayrshire. They were to have two daughters. The marriage was to be a great source of strength throughout his career, especially in the highlands, where Margaret supported his work and became involved herself in a range of public activities.<br>
<br>After national service as a flying officer in the Royal Air Force, Cowan (known to his friends as Bob) worked for Fisons and for Wolsey before joining PA management consultants in 1965. He was with PA for seventeen years, first in Birmingham and later, from 1976, as head of the company's operation in Hong Kong. The experience he gained there of a wide range of industrial problems, and particularly the interest he developed in marketing, was to stand him in good stead for the rest of his career.<br>
<br>In 1982 Cowan was appointed by the secretary of state for Scotland, George Younger, chairman of the Highlands and Islands Development Board (HIDB), the public body charged with the improvement of economic and social conditions in the vast, sparsely populated area comprising nearly half of Scotland's land mass and stretching from the Mull of Kintyre to the northern tip of Shetland. The post was executive and full-time; Cowan was the board's fifth chairman and, as it was to turn out, also its last, the HIDB being reformed into Highlands and Islands Enterprise, of which he became the first non-executive chairman in his last year. He was the only chairman of the HIDB to serve two five-year terms and, surprisingly, the first to come to the job from a career in business.<br>
<br>Cowan's was a post with daunting requirements. It involved a major public role, and a strong commitment to the highlands and islands was essential. It required vision, ability to lead and manage a substantial organization, the confidence to back one's judgement in taking the risks that are essential to success, and a prudent concern for the use of public funds. But there were also special factors, and Cowan had the willingness to fight hard for the interests of the area in dealings with government, the private sector, and other organizations; and the ability to relate to the ordinary people of the area, whatever their background or occupation.<br>
<br>Cowan took over the job at a difficult time. The recession of the early 1980s had hit the highlands hard, already causing the closure of the pulp mill at Fort William and the large aluminium smelter at Invergordon. It did not help him that, after his years in England and abroad, he was not known in the area. (For a time, he was known disparagingly as Bob Kow Wan.) However, it was not long before the people of the highlands warmed to his genial personality, the depth of his experience, his genuine concern, and his commitment.<br>
<br>By its nature the bulk of the board's work was on small projects and it is therefore difficult to highlight those that were special achievements. But Cowan was associated particularly with the impetus he gave to marketing in the area; the developments in salmon farming and in skiing, especially at Aonach Mor near Fort William; the modernization of telecommunications, which put the highlands ahead of other rural areas, greatly to the benefit of local business; and his tireless campaign for the University of the Highlands and Islands, a project which, alas, he did not live to see come to fruition. His final task was to oversee the upheaval involved in the transition from the HIDB to the new and much more devolved structure of Highlands and Islands Enterprise, a change imposed by government and not one he would have chosen. That it was achieved successfully owed much to his leadership, his diplomacy, and the care he took to make the reorganization as smooth as possible.<br>
<br>Cowan's genial personality, his strong sense of humour, and his natural authority combined with a refreshing informality, were immense assets to him in the post. He received a knighthood in 1989; and he was given honorary degrees by Aberdeen University, of which he was a member of court, and the University of Stirling. He was a member of the board of the Scottish Development Agency, of the Post Office Board for Scotland, and of the BBC Broadcasting Council for Scotland. He led the successful appeal to provide a scanner for Raigmore Hospital, Inverness, which proved a bitter irony when his last years were clouded by a long struggle against cancer. In this, too, he earned widespread respect for his courage and determination to carry on to the end. Indeed one of his best speeches was given to an international conference shortly before he retired, when the effects of his illness could no longer be disguised. He died at Raigmore Hospital, Inverness, on 7 January 1993, and was cremated five days later. He was survived by his wife and two daughters.<br>
