<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Lisle, Sir  George</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1648), <span class="occ">royalist army officer</span>, was the son of Lawrence Lisle, who had the monopoly of viewing and repairing arms in England and a lease of the right to collect the imposts on tobacco and tobacco pipes; he married a near relation of George Villiers, duke of Buckingham, and was said to have lost &pound;12,000 in the royalist cause.<br>
<br>George Lisle had his military training in the Netherlands, and was a captain in the army against the Scots of 1640. After joining the royalist cause early in the civil war, he served in Lord Grandison's regiment of foot, and, already a lieutenant-colonel of dragoons, at Edgehill (23 October 1642) he cleared the hedges on the royalist left. After fighting at Chalgrove (18 June 1643), Lisle bravely led a &#145;forlorn hope&#146; of musketeers at the first battle of Newbury (20 September), and was wounded. He was commissioned to raise a foot regiment in November, and on the death of Colonel Richard Bolles at Alton, Hampshire, in December, Lisle took over the latter's much depleted regiment in Reading. On the eve of the battle of Cheriton (29 March 1644) Lisle was posted with 1000 musketeers and 500 horse on an eminence between the two battle-lines, close enough to hear the chatter of the enemy's sentinels; but next day, the parliamentarian capture of Cheriton Wood forced him to retire.<br>
<br>After participating in the relief of Dudley Castle in June 1644 and the drawn battle of Cropredy Bridge, Lisle commanded one of the three royalist infantry divisions in the king's campaign in Devon and Cornwall in July and August. He signed the letter to the parliamentarian commander the earl of Essex on 8 August, in which Charles I offered somewhat hazy peace terms in return for an understanding. At the second battle of Newbury on 27 October Lisle commanded the second tertia of foot under Sir Jacob Astley which bore the brunt of the earl of Manchester's attack. Holding the royalist centre at Shaw House, he led three gallant charges and &#145;did all things with so much courage, cheerfulness, and present dispatch, as had special influence on every common soldier, taking particular care of all except himself&#146;  (<span class="italic">Mercurius Aulicus</span>, 28 Oct 1644). His troops scattered Manchester's infantry &#145;like spray before some storm-driven ship&#146;  (ibid.), and, as the twilight deepened, Lisle, who seldom wore defensive armour, threw off his buff coat, so that the white glimmer of his holland shirt was distinguishable to his men:<blockquote>
<div>From whence the frighted Rebels gave it out<br>
</div>
<div>That a white witch was seen to fly about<br>
</div>
<div>The Royal Army scouring to and fro,<br>
</div>
<div>Where'er the Contest did the hottest grow.<br>
</div> (Money, 173)</blockquote>Sir Samuel Luke, the parliamentarian scoutmaster-general, reported on 10 November that at a rendezvous near Oxford the previous month the king, who had closely witnessed Lisle's bravery at Newbury, intended to knight him. But Lisle declined, saying &#145;he would not be knighted or receive any honour till he was sure to keep it and then doubted not but he should as well deserve to be a Lord as many that were near his Majesty&#146;  (Newman, <span class="italic">Royalist Officers</span>, 235). If accurately reported, Lisle's disclaimer may have arisen from his fear of becoming entangled in the disgrace of his superior Henry Wilmot, Baron Wilmot, earlier in 1644, on suspicion of treating with parliament.<br>
<br>During the winter of 1644&#150;5 Lisle became governor of Faringdon, Berkshire, and complained to Prince Rupert that it was only one-third fortified and entirely unprovisioned. On 16 April 1645 he was created an honorary DCL by Oxford University. He commanded a tertia of foot at the storming of Leicester on 30 May, and on 1 June he was appointed lieutenant-general in Leicestershire under Lord Loughborough. At Naseby on 14 June 1645 the tertia of foot he commanded in the left centre bore the brunt of Cromwell's charge; Joshua Sprigg, Sir Thomas Fairfax's retainer, said they fought &#145;with incredible courage and resolution&#146;  (Young, 268). Although wounded, Lisle escaped to Leicester. He seems already to have been replaced as governor of Faringdon, and Loughborough recommended him for the post of deputy governor of Lichfield. He was knighted by the king at Oxford on 21 December 1645, when he was, apparently, master of the royal household.<br>
<br>In the winter of 1647 Lisle was in London, compounding for his estate. But he was soon busily occupied in getting together troops for a new rising. He was a ringleader of the insurrection in Kent in May 1648, which Fairfax suppressed after bitter street fighting in Maidstone. Lisle led the survivors to join the earl of Norwich's forces, which crossed the Thames into Essex, made a rendezvous with Sir Charles Lucas at Chelmsford, and, after a circuitous march, occupied Colchester. During the ensuing siege Lisle commanded the foot. On 6 July he and Lucas led a large raiding party across the River Colne, to recapture the parliamentarian stronghold at East Mill. Sallying forth &#145;as if it had been a sporting skirmish amongst tame soldiers in a general muster&#146;  (Carlton, 322), they pitched the two enemy cannon into the river before withdrawing with dignity. Lisle, captured during the raid, was soon rescued. But the garrison and citizens were reduced to a diet of horse, dog, and cat, occasionally sweetened with prunes; when even this food supply ran out, the royalists accepted Fairfax's terms of surrender on 27 August.<br>
<br>Senior officers were put at the lord-general's mercy: peers were reserved for the judgment of parliament, but Lisle, considered a mere soldier of fortune, was dealt with by a council of war. By 2 p.m. on 28 August he and Lucas had been condemned to death, probably through the influence of Henry Ireton, appointed commissioner for the surrender of Colchester, and to make a vindictive example of the leaders of such a lengthy and obstinate siege. Lisle was refused time to write to his parents, and at 7 p.m., with Lucas and Sir Bernard Gascoigne (a Florentine who was reprieved), he was brought out to the castle courtyard to face three files of musketeers. As Lucas's body fell, Lisle ran forward to catch it and tenderly kissed his face. When his turn came, he extracted from his pocket a gold piece for the executioners and four others for friends in London, and suggested the dragoons came nearer. One said, &#145;I'll warrant you, sir, we'll hit you&#146;; Lisle replied, &#145;Friends, I have been nearer you when you have missed me&#146;  (Clarendon, <span class="italic">Hist. rebellion</span>, 4.388).<br>
<br>The pair quickly became martyrs; it was said that the grass on the spot where they fell never grew again, and within a few days eight pamphlets appeared condemning this &#145;most barbarous, unsoldierly murder&#146;  (Carlton, 228). Lisle and Lucas were buried obscurely, but in 1661 were reinterred in the Lucas family vault in St Giles's Church, Colchester. Above their tomb a black marble slab inscription said they had been &#145;in cold blood barbarously murdered&#146;  (Warburton, 3.407) at the command of Fairfax. There is a tradition that when, after the Restoration, the second duke of Buckingham, who married Fairfax's daughter, asked for the inscription to be erased, Charles II had it cut more deeply. In January 1662 Lisle's sister Mary petitioned the king for a pension (she had also lost another brother, Francis, at Marston Moor); she was granted &pound;2000 on 31 January but seven years later had only received &pound;1100 and was destitute.<br>
<br>Lisle was one of the more attractive commanders thrown up by the civil war. Clarendon's relatively succinct panegyric remarks that he led his men into battle:<blockquote>with such an alacrity that no man was ever better followed, his soldiers never forsaking him; and the tertia which he commanded never left anything undone which he had led them upon. But &hellip; to this fierceness of courage, he had the softest and most gentle nature imaginable; loved all, and beloved of all, and without a capacity to have an enemy. (Clarendon, <span class="italic">Hist. rebellion</span>, 4.389)</blockquote>
