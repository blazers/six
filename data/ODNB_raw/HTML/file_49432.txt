<span class="headword">Andrews,  Robert</span>  (1703&#150;1763), <span class="occ">lawyer and property developer</span>, was born in London, probably at Upper John Street, Golden Square, on 3 September 1703, the fifth but second surviving son of Richard Andrews (1664&#150;1734), a scrivener, and his wife, Elizabeth (1664&#150;1749), daughter of Hugh Pigot of Peploe, Shropshire. Richard Andrews was steward or agent of the Grosvenor family's estate in London, and Robert Pigot, his brother-in-law, was steward of the Grosvenors' estate in Cheshire. These connections served the young Andrews well. Little is known of his upbringing and education, but he probably received some training at the hands of Edward Partington, the Grosvenors' attorney in Chester, whom he was later to describe as a good friend. The ties between the two families were further cemented when, on 3 September 1726, his twenty-third birthday, Andrews married his cousin, Margaret Pigot (1703&#150;1774), daughter of Robert Pigot, at Eccleston parish church, Cheshire. They had eleven children, six of whom died in infancy.<br>
<br>However informal his training may have been, Andrews set up in business as an attorney at the age of eighteen, when, by his own account, &#145;howsoer uncommon it may appear I had four Clerks under me&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 32853, fol. 262). The timing had much to do with the speculative building developments then taking place on the Grosvenors' hundred-acre estate in Mayfair. He took care of most of the legal business spawned by the development, drawing up a large number of building agreements, leases, assignments, mortgages, and the like. After the death of the estate surveyor in 1730, when no successor was appointed he also took over his functions, and, especially after the death of his father in 1734, was virtually solely responsible for the management of the estate. He also acted as a conduit through which mortgage finance could be provided to the builders by small investors, and soon participated directly in the development. In April 1724, when he was still only twenty, he acquired a large parcel of land bordered by Park Lane under a building agreement, and over the next few years arranged for the building of some two dozen terraced houses. Later he took another ten plots on the estate, either singly or in partnership with other developers and builders, and had a hand in the building of over a hundred houses. No builder or developer played a greater role in making the Grosvenors' Mayfair estate a byword for high-quality Georgian housing. He also extended his speculative activities to the Berkeley estate around Berkeley Square, where he also took over the management of the estate, and to St James's Square, where he financed the building of two very substantial town houses. He sold off most of his speculative interests at a handsome profit but the remaining ground rents still provided an annual income of nearly &pound;500 at the time of his death.<br>
<br>At the same time as Andrews was pursuing these lucrative speculative building activities, he was assiduously building up his legal practice. He acted as the London attorney of the Grosvenor family, and soon attracted other clients including a number of aristocratic families such as the Berkeleys, Comptons, Irbys, and Sackvilles of Knole. He eventually gravitated to the circle of Frederick, prince of Wales, and was appointed to various posts in the administration of the duchy of Cornwall, firstly as remembrancer (in effect attorney) in 1734, and subsequently clerk of the prince's council in 1744, and auditor five years later. Among his duties he looked after the prince's electoral interests in several Cornish boroughs, and although on the prince's sudden death in 1751 Andrews lost his position as auditor, he continued to be heavily embroiled in the intrigues that characterized elections to the unreformed House of Commons. As agent firstly of the prince and later of Thomas Pitt of Boconnoc, one of the more unsavoury borough-mongers of the age, he managed elections in a number of constituencies, including the notorious rotten borough of Old Sarum in Wiltshire, where half a dozen burgage holders (of whom Andrews became one) elected two members of parliament.<br>
<br>After the prince's death Andrews sought the protection of Thomas Pelham-Holles, duke of Newcastle (1693&#150;1768), who presided at the centre of a vast web of political influence on behalf of the government, by offering to do his best to ensure that government nominees were returned in the seats he controlled. In 1752 a grateful Newcastle appointed him to the lucrative sinecure of comptroller of the cash in the excise. In 1755, when a vacancy occurred at Old Sarum, Andrews proposed himself for election to parliament, but Newcastle decided to use the opportunity to repay a political debt, and Andrews had to be content with a rise in his salary at the excise and other pecuniary embellishments.<br>
<br>Robert and Margaret Andrews lived initially in Great Russell Street, and, from 1730, in Grosvenor Street, Mayfair. About 1755 Andrews also acquired the lease of East Acton Manor House, a large, detached mansion standing in its own grounds, a short distance to the west of London, and spent an increasing amount of time there. A chronic sufferer from gout, he was always complaining about his health, and, after a last desperate but unavailing journey to take the waters at Bath, he died at East Acton Manor House on 27 August 1763, a few days short of his sixtieth birthday. He was buried on 2 September at Hanwell parish church, Middlesex. His legal practice was taken over by his son-in-law, Thomas Walley Partington, the son of Edward Partington, and has continued under various names and styles and latterly as Boodle Hatfield.<br>
