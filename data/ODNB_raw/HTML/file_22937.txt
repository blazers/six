<span class="headword">Queally,  Malachy</span> <span class="st"> [Maolseachlain &Oacute; Caollaidhe]</span>  (1586&#150;1645), <span class="occ">vicar apostolic of Killaloe and Roman Catholic archbishop of Tuam</span>, was born of aristocratic landowning stock at Drinagh, barony of Inchiquin, co. Clare, the son of Donagh Queally (Donnchadh &Oacute; Caoillaidhe) and his wife, Sive. After studies in local schools he went to Paris, apparently in 1613, for he took his MA degree, usually awarded after two years' study, in 1615. This was the year in which the French clergy adopted the Council of Trent as the pattern for church reform. He went on to study theology, and it was probably at this time that he was ordained priest. He took his baccalaureate in 1617, and taught philosophy at the Coll&egrave;ge de Boncourt while residing in the Coll&egrave;ge de Navarre and studying for his licentiate, which he took in 1622. An academic career was opening up for him, but he had already decided to return to Ireland. There the Roman Catholic church was being reorganized by the appointment to the historic dioceses of vicars apostolic (priests in charge by virtue of papal delegation) or, more cautiously, by the appointment of bishops. Queally had been appointed vicar apostolic of his native diocese of Killaloe on 20 August 1619 and he returned to Ireland shortly after taking his licentiate.<br>
<br>Queally was a man of commanding presence and of great energy and commitment, and he vigorously promoted church reform as laid down by the Council of Trent. Soon there were requests from many quarters that he be promoted to the episcopate. However, the Roman authorities were slow to multiply bishops, and another candidate, John O'Molony, had the powerful advocacy of the French queen mother, Marie de' Medici. In 1629 Archbishop Conry of Tuam died in exile. Queally was appointed his successor on 12 April 1630 and O'Molony was appointed to Killaloe on 2 August. Queally was consecrated in Galway on 10 October by Archbishop Walsh of Cashel. As archbishop of Tuam he was also metropolitan of the western ecclesiastical province, hitherto only superficially touched by either Roman Catholic or protestant reform. He embarked on a forceful programme, recorded in the provincial synods held in 1632 and 1640, and in his reports to the Roman authorities in 1634 and 1637. He even attempted to extend his authority over his suffragans further than the Council of Trent envisaged, but in this he did not obtain Roman support. He failed too in his attempt to reassert control over the warden of the collegiate church of St Nicholas in Galway, exempted from archiepiscopal jurisdiction since 1488. He opposed the unbridled attacks on the regular clergy made by an extreme faction of the seculars, in this possibly influenced by his close links with the Franciscan order. The wide range of his interests appears from his efforts in 1639 to find priests to replace those who had gone to St Kitt's when it was first settled in 1623 and had since died. Four surviving chalices are associated with him (the existing church plate had passed to the established church). His Gaelic and Franciscan links appear in his formal approbation of the martyrology of Donegal and the annals of the four masters, completed in 1630 and 1636 respectively, and in his list of the churches and antiquities of the Aran Islands, printed by John Colgan in <span class="italic">Acta sanctorum Hiberniae</span> (1645).<br>
<br>An account written by a protestant in 1641 indicates that in Tuam and in the western province generally the Roman Catholic church had prevailed almost to the exclusion of protestantism, but the tensions inherent in this situation were coming to a head. There had been confrontation in 1635, when the refusal of a Galway jury to find land titles for the king had been punished by fines and imprisonments. In consequence there was widespread support in Connaught for the insurrection of 1641. When the principal Catholic nobleman, the marquess of Clanricarde, was reluctant to give active support, leadership devolved on the forceful archbishop of Tuam. In the summer of 1642 Queally raised a troop of 200 foot at his own expense, primarily indeed to maintain order, for though there was no enemy in Connaught there had been a massacre of protestant refugees at Shrule on 13 February. By the end of the year, however, he had gone to Kilkenny, first as a member of the general assembly of the Irish confederates and then of their supreme council or executive. The tortuous negotiations conducted by the confederates with Charles I came to a head in a secret treaty with his representative, the earl of Glamorgan, concluded on 25 August 1645. By now, however, Connaught was threatened because parliamentarian forces under Sir Charles Coote had captured Sligo on 7 July. Queally returned to rally a counter-attack. He did succeed in mustering a sizeable force, but he was killed at Ballysadare near Sligo on 25 October, in a skirmish according to one account, surprised in his tent according to another. A copy of the Glamorgan treaty was found among his effects, and revelation of the great concessions Glamorgan was prepared to make to the Irish confederates on the king's behalf did great damage to his cause in England. Archbishop Queally's mutilated body was ransomed and taken to Tuam Cathedral for burial.<br>
