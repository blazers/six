<span class="headword">Williams, Sir  Roger</span>  (1539/40&#150;1595), <span class="occ">soldier and author</span>, was probably the elder of two sons of Sir Thomas Williams of Penrhos, Monmouthshire, and his wife, Eleanor, daughter of Sir William Vaughan. His family was &#145;rather ancient than wealthy&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 1.643). However, a seventeenth-century tradition that he was &#145;but a taylour at first&#146; probably reflects a genteel poverty more than reality, for there is fairly convincing evidence that he was at Brasenose College, Oxford, between 1552 and 1554, and his books on military affairs evince a wide knowledge of contemporary and classical literature  (<span class="italic">Anecdotes and Traditions, Illustrative of Early English History and Literature</span>, ed. W. J. Thoms, <span class="italic">CS</span>, 5, 1839, 47). He was also a page of William Herbert, first earl of Pembroke, a post that a tailor could not have obtained.<h2>
<a name="Militarycareer"></a>Military career</h2>Williams, then aged seventeen, may have accompanied Pembroke when, in 1557, English troops fought in the last of the Habsburg&#150;Valois wars: they campaigned against the French in the southern Low Countries, under Philip of Spain, but his memoirs are not clear. It is likely, as John Evans suggests, that he served with the Huguenots during the early French wars of religion (1562&#150;3, 1567&#150;70). He may have been the Roger Williams who travelled to the Palatinate in 1568, where troops were being raised for service with the Huguenots. Certainly he was already a veteran when, in 1572, he joined the celebrated 300 volunteers raised by Thomas Morgan to serve in the Netherlands, which were now in revolt against Philip II for both political and religious reasons. Elizabeth I and her privy councillors sympathized with the Dutch, who, like the Huguenots, were their co-religionists, but England at this stage was weak. The government was building the nation's strength but dared not yet confront Europe's two great military, Catholic powers: France and Spain. It had covertly arranged for volunteers to aid the Huguenots and now did the same for the Dutch and their leader, William of Orange.<br>
<br>This unofficial religious war with Spain and France was the backdrop to Williams's early military career. About 2500 English mercenaries served the Dutch in 1572, but suffered defeats &#145;and the most of our men not being acquainted with such disasters, sought all meanes to return into England&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 121). Morgan did serve into the following year with a newly raised regiment, which included his fellow Welshman, Williams. When Morgan fell out with William of Orange over pay and conditions at the end of 1573 and took his force home, Williams preferred to travel to the Rhineland, where the Huguenots were said to be raising an army. This rumour turned out to be false and Williams headed home, but took the direct route, through the southern Netherlands. He was arrested, but the Spanish commander who interviewed him had served with Pembroke in 1557 and therefore offered Williams the chance to enlist in his regiment. Williams accepted. His personal religious beliefs may still have been forming, for later in life he was a resolute protestant. When he eventually returned home in summer 1577, after three years' service in the Spanish army of Flanders, he was immediately employed by the principal secretary, Sir Francis Walsingham. Williams may thus have been an intelligence agent throughout.<br>
<br>In 1578 Elizabeth decided to increase English assistance to the Dutch. The &#145;volunteers&#146; in Dutch service increased to over 4000, mostly serving in a coherent battle group commanded by John Norris, whose patron, Robert Dudley, earl of Leicester, was one of the chief advocates of English intervention on behalf of continental protestants. The Dutch were suspicious of Williams because of his time in Spanish pay, but in late May both Walsingham and Leicester asked the English ambassador, William Davison, to recommend him to William of Orange for a commission, hoping that &#145;the valour of the man, who is indeede a very good soldiour, may overway &hellip; [his] offence&#146;  (Lettenhove, 10.475).<br>
<br>Williams joined Norris's regiment and immediately won fame when he fought a single combat with a Spaniard and &#145;worthely acquitted hymself of the same&#146;  (Churchyard, <span class="italic">A Generall Rehearsall</span>, sig. S3<i>v</i>). He served with Norris throughout the early 1580s. Both men were choleric and they sometimes quarrelled explosively, but Williams was Norris's trusted lieutenant in these years. He particularly distinguished himself in Norris's campaign in Friesland (1580&#150;81), albeit more for hard fighting than tactical acuity. In 1582 the English troops in Dutch pay were moved to the southern Netherlands, where they confronted the inexorable offensive masterminded by Alessandro Farnese, prince of Parma. Williams's brother was killed by the Spanish in 1582 but his cousins enlisted for the protestant war effort. In 1583, while Norris was visiting England to brief Elizabeth, Morgan tried to take over several of Norris's companies, but Williams thwarted him.<br>
<br>Less successful was Williams's attempt to stop the English garrison of Aalst from mutinying. Norris's regimental major, Pigott, ejected Williams before betraying Aalst to Parma. Williams himself rejected two Spanish overtures at about this time. He spent some months detached with the Dutch army sent to the Rhineland to maintain Gethard Truchsess, prince-bishop of Cologne (a recent Calvinist convert), on his electoral throne, but the expedition was defeated and Williams returned to Holland. Norris left Dutch employ but Williams stayed. He became one of William of Orange's intimates and, despite expressing himself more frankly than the prince was used to, he was &#145;a man much beloved by the Prince of Orange&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP for.</span>, 18.642). Williams was in the prince's entourage at Delft on 10 July 1584 when he was killed by the Catholic fanatic Balthasar Gerard and &#145;pursued the assassin and caught him outside the Prince's residence [while] attempting to escape over the garden wall&#146;  (Miller, 89). In April 1585 Williams travelled to France and probably served as a gentleman volunteer with Henri, king of Navarre and leader of the Huguenots, in May and June. However, the death of William of Orange had been a calamity for the Dutch, and in August 1585 the English government decided it had to make outright war on Spain. An army was sent to the Netherlands, commanded by Norris&#151;Williams returned with him, in his trusted capacity as lieutenant-colonel.<br>
<br>Robert Dudley, earl of Leicester, superseded Norris in January 1586 and the two men quarrelled bitterly. Williams took Leicester's side: whether genuinely or from ambition is unclear. He also began to be drawn into the orbit of the young Robert Devereux, second earl of Essex, Leicester's kinsman and prot&eacute;g&eacute;. Leicester knighted Williams in October 1586, after good service in several actions. The next year he was made governor of the port town of Sluys. That summer it was the target of Parma, who was seeking harbours for the imminent arrival of the Armada. From 12 June to 5 August 1587 Williams inspired his 1600-strong garrison in heroic resistance against 10,000 men led by the best general in Europe, but he was obliged to accept the honours of war from Parma after suffering 900 casualties. Leicester, who had failed to relieve Sluys, resented the laurels Williams garnered by his gallant defence. By the end of the year Williams had fallen out with another one-time patron.<br>
<br>Williams spent the Armada year, 1588, in England. He helped to prepare the English militia to do battle with the Spanish (whose military methods he knew so well) and was second in command, to Essex, of the cavalry of the army gathered at Tilbury. Then in 1589 Williams commanded a regiment in the large expeditionary force that Norris and Sir Francis Drake led to Portugal. For the English fleet and army generally, it was a disastrous mission, but Williams personally provoked the wrath of the queen when he let Essex (whom Elizabeth had expressly forbidden to go on the voyage) &#145;stow away&#146; aboard his ship. On his return Williams for a time apparently even went into hiding. He was thenceforth a confirmed follower of Essex, who is described in his will of 19 June 1589 as &#145;the errle of Essex my gret prince&#146;  (Hatfield, Cecil MS 203, fol. 92<i>r</i>). When writing to the earl, Williams signed himself &#145;your Lordship's most assuryd to serve you to the death&#146;  (Longleat, Devereux MS 1, fol. 127<i>v</i>). Later in 1589 Williams crossed back to France and, after serving a month in Henri IV's pay, joined the English army commanded by Peregrine Bertie, thirteenth Baron Willoughby de Eresby, sent by Elizabeth. The army campaigned in France until January 1590, when it returned home; Williams returned too, having partially redeemed himself in the queen's eyes.<br>
<br>In spring 1591 Williams was given a colonelcy in the army that Norris was leading to Brittany. This was despite his and Essex's attacks on Norris, whose command Essex wanted. That summer Essex brought over a separate army to operate with Henri. Williams's force was subsumed within it and he was promptly made marshal of the field. When Essex was recalled in January 1592, his Welsh retainer succeeded him as commander of the army. This force remained in France until late summer 1593, but its numbers steadily dwindled and Williams was obliged generally to act as a subordinate of Henri or his marshals, rather than as an independent general.<br>
<br>Elizabeth had always tolerated rather than liked Williams. There is an oft-quoted tale of Williams at court, petitioning the queen for this or that, until Elizabeth exclaimed, &#145;Faugh, Williams, I prithee begone: thy boots stink,&#146; to which he allegedly retorted, &#145;Tut, madam, 'tis my suit that stinks&#146;  (W. J. Thoms, quoted in <span class="italic">DNB</span>). It is apocryphal, but sums up accurately Williams's relationship with his queen. In 1594 he was finally granted a life pension of &pound;300 per annum (to cease if he was employed in Elizabeth's service in an office with comparable pay). Also in 1594, and then again in 1595, he was sent as special ambassador to Henri. These appointments reflect his special expertise in French affairs and friendship with the French king, but also perhaps a growing acceptance of him by Elizabeth&#151;and probably most of all the influence at court of his patron, Essex.<br>
<br>Williams died of fever on 12 December 1595 after a four-day illness, with Essex at his side: &#145;he died well, and very repentant&#146;  (Collins, 1.377). It is known that in 1593 he had a mistress while on campaign in France, but he never married and in his will &#145;he gave all he had to my Lord of Essex&#146;  (ibid.). His jewels, cash, clothes, and accoutrements came to over &pound;1600 in value. He may have left lands as well: probate was granted to his kinsmen <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18639/', "Gelly Meyrick (c.1556&#150;1601)")</script> and Thomas Powell. After Meyrick's execution (following Essex's fall in 1601) the commission of administration was quashed and was granted anew to Katherine Kemis, Williams's sister (probably the wife of a fellow veteran of Flushing in 1572). This implies his estate was still valuable. Williams was buried in London, in St Paul's Cathedral, on 23 December 1595. Powell and Meyrick made the arrangements but, as Paul Hammer shows, did so on Essex's instructions and at his expense. Essex used the funeral as a propaganda vehicle, to make heroic those who fought Spanish Catholicism. The earl attended, dressed in black, together with the rest of his military affinity.<h2>
<a name="Williamsandtheartofwar"></a>Williams and the art of war</h2>Some historians have suggested that Williams wanted to &#145;practise [his] trade&#146; wherever pay and conditions were best, like an artist &#145;taking commissions from rival courts&#146;  (Fissel, 153); that he was, in the words of a Dutch military history, &#145;a genuine &#147;soldat de fortune&#148;, whose services were in the main open to the offer of friend or foe&#146;  (ten Raa and de Bas, 1.103). Such verdicts are the consequence of his period in Spanish service. However, many native soldiers and politicians, who later fought for the Dutch republic, sided with the Spanish in the mid-1570s, while such assessments ignore not only alternative explanations for Williams's time in Spanish pay, but his steadfast defence of Dutch territory at Sluys in 1587.<br>
<br>To be sure, Williams in his correspondence regularly threatened to abandon the English army for foreign princes. A &#145;sullen request to go &amp; serve abroad&#146; and a petition for a &#145;licence to leave abroad in discontent&#146; are just two examples of his frank approach (BL, Harley MS 6995, fol. 3<i>r</i>; BL, Lansdowne MS 64, fol. 96<i>r</i>). He lists kings, from the tsar of the Russians to the shah of Persia, as princes whom he might serve, but Williams was just sounding off. Apart from the one period in the 1570s he never showed any signs of fighting other than for England or her protestant allies. His real attitudes are summed up in his response to Parma's offer after Sluys fell, of any commission in Spanish pay&#151;against the Turks if he would not fight protestants. He declared his sword was Elizabeth's and when she had &#145;no further use for it, it was at the service of the King of Navarre&#146;  (Miller, 90). Williams's movements from one army to another were actually more like those of a questing knight errant than a ruthless <i>condottiere</i> and he was steadfastly loyal to the protestant cause after 1577.<br>
<br>In other respects, too, Williams's behaviour was like that of a character in the works of Arthurian romance that were popular in contemporary England and Wales. He delighted in charges; he told his lancers before one pell-mell attack in 1580 that it was &#145;farr more honorable for us to charge them in this maner, then scattered, straggeling, or in Ambush and Troupe&#146;  (W. Blandy, <span class="italic">The Castle, or, Picture of Pollicy</span>, 1581, 24). He had a penchant for acts of heroic exhibitionism. In spring 1586 he &#145;put in practice a haughty enterprise&#146;, raiding the main enemy camp with a picked force at night, intending to kill Parma himself: &#145;having slaughtered many, they had pierced as farre as the Dukes tent&#146;, before obliged to retreat by superior numbers  (Camden, bk 3, 114&#150;15). In 1589 Williams rallied fleeing French troops at the great battle of Arques, by thrusting himself in their path and &#145;crying &#147;Noblesse fran&ccedil;aise, retournez; voulez-vous fuir, votre roi &eacute;tant en terre?&#148;&#146; (&#145;Nobles of France, turn back: are you willing to flee, while your king is in the field?&#146;; <span class="italic">Works</span>, xxxvii). He also had a propensity for arranging single combats and jousts with soldiers from the enemy side, and during Norris's Friesland campaign, when his general was challenged to single combat by a Welsh Catholic officer in Spanish service, Williams fought as Norris's representative. The duel was a draw and ended with each combatant drinking the other's health. Similarly, Williams and a Spanish counterpart had an exchange of courtesies, carried by heralds, in June 1584.<br>
<br>Williams himself could be vain about his achievements. When Sir Walter Ralegh was awarded a gold chain in 1589, Williams protested that he deserved it as much as Ralegh; and the next year told William Cecil, Lord Burghley, &#145;I am one that deserves better reward&#146;  (Miller, 92, 95). However, he had a realistic appreciation of his own virtues and weaknesses: he wanted what he regarded as appropriate reward for the former, but could and did recognize that &#145;many can lead troops better than myself&#146;  (ibid., 118).<br>
<br>Despite his limitations as a general and his preference for a chivalric style of warfare Williams was still among the most advanced practitioners of the art of war in the sixteenth century. In <span class="italic">A Briefe Discourse of Warre</span> (1590) he examined the competence and proficiency of the Spanish army and argued that it should be copied. He demolished the case of traditionalists for retaining weapons such as the longbow; and he dissected honestly the performance of the generals under whom he had fought, drawing appropriate lessons. The book was intended as a manual for Essex and for the new generation of officers whose careers the earl intended to promote.<br>
<br>Contemporaries certainly thought Williams an excellent soldier. At times he sat on William of Orange's council of war. Leicester affirmed that &#145;Roger Williams is worth his weight in gold, for he is noe more valiant than he is wise, and of judgment to governe his doings&#146;  (Bruce, 430). Parma wrote to Philip: &#145;je n'ai jamais vu en Flandre une action militaire qui m'ait donn&eacute; plus de travail et de pr&eacute;occupations&#146; (&#145;I have never seen in Flanders a military action which gave me so much work and preoccupation&#146;) as the siege of Sluys  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, xxix). Henri, like William of Orange, would &#145;talk with [Williams] in his ear and confer with him which hardly will he do with any others&#146;, as an English observer noted in 1590, while the French king frequently commended Williams for his valour and diligence  (Miller, 97).<br>
<br>While Williams was remarkably brave and a redoubtable fighter, his achievements were comparatively minor; no long-term consequences can be attributed to any of his personal actions, or to the skirmishes won by troops under his command. Nevertheless, Williams still influenced the English art of war. His arguments helped ensure the longbow was consigned to the past. Further, during the 1590s Essex was the pre-eminent military patron in England and probably the most important figure in English grand strategic decision making. &#145;The personal bonds between Essex and Williams were very strong and the Welshman's influence on Essex's ideas of war was profound&#146;; Essex also &#145;patently followed the advice and arguments&#146; of <span class="italic">A Briefe Discourse</span>  (Hammer, 237&#150;8).<h2>
<a name="Theliteraryfigure"></a>The literary figure</h2>Williams's <span class="italic">A Briefe Discourse of Warre</span> was published in 1590 and would have included a history of the Dutch wars, &#145;but for the negligence of a servant that lost part of my discourses&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 3). Yet a version of the manuscript did survive. It provided the basis for <span class="italic">The Actions of the Lowe Countries</span>, which was published in 1618, in effect by the old Essex affinity. The antiquarian Peter Manwood found it &#145;in a ragged hand, much maimed, both in sense and in phrase &hellip; thought good to publish [it] to the world&#146; and hence had it edited by the historian and former Essex client John Hayward, who &#145;restored it so neere as I could, both to the stile and meaning of the Authour&#146;  (ibid., 56, 59). It was published with a dedication to another historian and former Essex partisan, Sir Francis Bacon, lord chancellor.<br>
<br>Williams was part of a circle of soldier&#150;writers whose members evidently knew each other and spent time together when in London. In early 1585 he received a letter from his close friend Jack Roberts, who described with ironic allegory the carouses of Thomas Churchyard, Barnaby Rich, and George Whetstone, all soldiers and poets. They would have all known each other and it is obvious from the letter that Williams, if not necessarily a friend, also knew them all well. In Roberts's letter it is also clear that Williams was at least acquainted with players, including one Lyllie, a member of the Men of Edward de Vere, seventeenth earl of Oxford. Williams was certainly a playgoer when he was in London. Given Williams's connections with authors and the theatre, there must be a good chance that William Shakespeare knew him. Even if the two did not meet, Shakespeare could have known much about Williams. Shakespeare knew Ben Jonson, who had served in the Netherlands and collaborated with another veteran of Dutch service, George Chapman (another client of Essex). In one of his best plays, <span class="italic">The Conspiracy and Tragedy of Charles, Duke of Byron, Marshal of France</span>, Chapman alluded to &#145;Colonel Williams (a Welsh Colonel)&#146;  (pt I, <span class="smallcap">III</span>.i). Shakespeare in his plays borrowed from Churchyard (who praised Williams in some of his works) and Rich. At the very least, then, he surely knew enough about Williams for him to be the model for Fluellen in <span class="italic">Henry V</span>, which was first performed about 1599. &#145;Williams and Fluellen had the same type of ignescent personality&#146;, but Fluellen is &#145;a conservative upholding the pristine wars of the Romans&#146;, which was precisely the sort of attitude Williams loathed  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, lxxvi). However, it is striking that while Fluellen, the fiery yet witty, consummate Welsh professional soldier, is remarkably like Williams in personality, he holds views that could almost be drawn from the books by Sir John Smythe, Williams's great adversary in the controversy over whether to retain the longbow as a weapon of war. To combine the characteristics of two protagonists to a debate so public and fiery that the privy council had to intervene in it, using the personality of one but giving him the opinions of the other, would be a brilliant satirical stroke (and would not have been lost on many in the audience).<br>
<br>Williams may have known writers, but how good a writer was he himself? Sir Walter Scott thought his style &#145;blunt [and] manly&#146;, which is damning with faint praise  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 156). Williams's editor observes that alliteration is mostly &#145;accidental&#146;, there are &#145;few striking images&#146; or &#145;instances of rhetorical balance and climax&#146;, and &#145;similes, metaphors, and analogies are just as scarce&#146;  (ibid., cxliv). However, Williams is an excellent historical source, not only for the wealth of information he provides, but for his extraordinary honesty. He almost invariably reports objectively, even when his account shows him and his fellow English and Welsh soldiers in a bad light. &#145;To say troth [truth]&#146; or &#145;to speake truth&#146; are off-repeated statements in his books&#151;and Williams's reliability is confirmed frequently when comparison can be made with other sources describing the same events.<br>
<br>Williams also had a good eye for effect and was known by contemporaries for his sardonic wit. Anthony Standen wrote to Anthony Bacon in 1593: &#145;I wysshe you somtymes to here of Syr Roger in his satiricall humour, whiche malgre your gretest payne would make [you] to laugh&#146;  (LPL, MS 649, fol. 388<i>r</i>). A good example is the story, recounted by Williams in <span class="italic">Actions</span>, of how Sir William Pelham, sent in 1572 to survey Flushing, a city that ever after defied the Spanish and blockaded the Scheldt River, concluded that it was:<blockquote>a place not worthy to be kept [by England]; meaning not sufficient to withstand so great an enemy long time. If that bee true, we [had no] great Captains at that time; for then without fellowe, hee was accounted our chiefest souldier. (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 121)</blockquote>Williams repays time spent reading him, both as a historical source and as an example of &#145;direct and resolute&#146; English prose, stripped of &#145;pointless abstractions and sentimentality&#146;  (ibid., cxlv).<br>
<br>Williams was a brave, competent, generous, and steadfast soldier; a good friend (if a bad enemy) and bon viveur; and a notable memorialist. He was one of the men who by deed and word steered England to victory over Spain, then the greatest power in the world, even while rubbing shoulders with those who, at this same time, brought about the English literary renaissance. It was once thought that he was the notorious pamphleteer Martin Marprelate, but this is now discredited. Williams was of only secondary importance, but he was party to great events and he played his part in them in great style.<br>
