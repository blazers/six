<span class="headword">Boughen,  Edward</span>  (1587&#150;1653), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and religious controversialist</span>, was born in Buckinghamshire and educated at Westminster School. Elected as a Westminster scholar at Christ Church, Oxford, he matriculated, aged eighteen, on 13 December 1605, graduating BA on 22 June 1609 and proceeding MA on 14 May 1612. In 1619 he became chaplain to the bishop of Oxford, John Howson, who rapidly appointed him rector of Warpsgrave in 1620, and vicar of Bray in 1621 and of Stoke Talmage in 1628.<br>
<br>Boughen was a well-educated conformist and his writings principally offered a staunch defence of the Church of England. He preached on 27 September 1619, at Howson's primary visitation, of the pastoral importance and episcopal function exercised in confirmation. Richard Hooker had long before noted the scandalous neglect into which the practice of confirmation had fallen, repeating criticisms and claims of laxity made to Burghley as early as the 1580s. Although Hooker's contention was championed by George Hakewill in the pamphlet he wrote in 1613 to celebrate the confirmation at Whitehall of Prince Charles, <span class="italic">The Auncient Ecclesiasticall Practise of Confirmation</span>, it does not seem to have prompted many of the episcopal bench into action any more than had 1604 Canon LX, which required that the bishop confirm triennially at his visitations. Visitation articles tended only to enquire after catechizing, a necessary part of confirmation preparation; those of Howson in 1619, repeated in 1628, on the other hand, expressly enjoined due diligence in preparing candidates for confirmation.<br>
<br>Boughen's agenda at the 1619 visitation was to explain confirmation to the clergy:<blockquote>that you &hellip; may be the better encouraged, to performe that dutie of seasoning the younger sort of your parishioners with the principles of the Religio, that they may be more fit for that holy <i>imposition of hands</i> by the Bishop, and worthily partake the fruits thereof. (Boughen, <span class="italic">A Sermon of Confirmation</span>, 2)</blockquote>If this sermon is taken as evidence of an attempt to propagandize the rite&#151;other attempts were made in Scotland in the articles of Aberdeen of 1616 which became the five articles of Perth of 1618&#151;Boughen's success was partial. Little uniformity of practice was achieved until after 1662. In the very next year (1620), in the Oxford schools, Richard Hall roundly answered in the negative the proposition whether confirmation was absolutely necessary as a sacrament instituted by the church.<br>
<br>On 13 April 1633, in succession to Bishop John Bancroft, Boughen was collated to the rectory of Woodchurch, Kent; in 1638 he was appointed to the prebend of Marden in the diocese of Chichester. Removed from Bray in 1640, he was deprived of Woodchurch as a &#145;delinquent&#146; in February 1641. In 1646 he joined the king in Oxford and on 1 July was made by him DD in the university. Thereafter he lived in Chartham, Kent, where he may have had family links: although nothing is known of his wife, his son Edward, who went to Merton College, Oxford, in 1644, was born there.<br>
<br>Boughen's later writings on the necessity of unity of doctrine and uniformity in discipline are consistent with early opinions. A 1645 treatise &#145;Observations upon the ordinance of the Lords and Commons&#146;, showing the nullity and invalidity of Presbyterian ordinations was, according to Bishop Barlow, part of an intended larger work begun in 1643 that was overtaken by Jeremy Taylor's writings, while he returned to the need for confirmation and value of catechizing in a short exposition of the catechism, <span class="italic">Principles of Religion</span> (1646). Here he lamented &#145;that two such useful and excellent means of saving knowledge, as sermons and catechizing be, should the one be advanced to the depressing of the other&#146;, noting that &#145;the inordinate Zeal of people&#146; often demanded two sermons on Sundays at the cost of the catechism. Catechizing &#145;is a means indispensably necessary to attain the more excellent and only necessary end&#146;  (<span class="italic">Principles of Religion</span>, 1646) of building up the faithful. Shortly before the regicide he discussed the treaty of Newcastle and whether the king could with a safe conscience consent to the abrogation of episcopacy in his <span class="italic">Mr Geere's Case of Conscience Sifted</span> (1648). His last conformist work was <span class="italic">An Account of the Church Catholick</span> (1653), a disputation with a New College man, Thomas Read.<br>
<br>Boughen died during the interregnum, on 9 November 1653, and was buried at Southease church, near Lewes. News of his death was not widely known at the time and he was mistakenly entered at the Restoration as vicar of Bray; a successor was appointed later in the year.<br>
