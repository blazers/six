<span class="headword">Cool,  Jacob</span> <span class="st"> [Jacobus Colius; <em>called </em>Ortelianus]</span>  (1563&#150;1628), <span class="occ">scholar and writer</span>, was born on 31 December 1563 in Antwerp, the son of Jacob Cool or Cole (<i>d</i>. 1591), merchant, and Elisabeth Ortelius (<i>d</i>. 1594), sister to the Antwerp map maker and geographer <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20854/', "Abraham Ortelius (1527&#150;1598)")</script>. Both his parents belonged to the Dutch-Walloon refugee community in London and like them Cool settled in Lime Street, where he followed in his father's footsteps as a cloth merchant, specializing in silk production and the silk trade. However, it was Cool's learned interests in theology, history, poetry, art, numismatics, and botany which came to dominate his life and which formed the basis for his many friendships with scholars such as William Camden, Emanuel van Meteren, Carolus Clusius, and the royal botanist Mathias de Lobel, who later became his father-in-law. Surprisingly, although he seems to have been a competent Latinist from an early age, Cool does not appear to have received any formal schooling. He was largely self-taught, except for a period during the late 1580s when he was educated by his uncle Abraham Ortelius, who evidently inspired his lifelong interest in history and in his collection of Greek and Roman coins and medals, and who provided him with the nickname Ortelianus by which he became known within the republic of letters. Between 1584 and 1586 Cool wrote a short treatise on letter combinations to be found in different figures, &#145;Tractatus de scriptis in fictis characteribus legendis&#146;; another two unpublished works, written in 1588, &#145;Fasti triumphorum et magistratuum Romanorum&#146; and &#145;Graeca numismata externorum regum&#146;, were on numismatics, about which he continued to correspond regularly with the Augsburg collector and numismatist Adolph Occo.<br>
<br>In 1592 Cool travelled widely in Germany and the Netherlands. That year and the next, as a liberal but firm Calvinist, he seems to have been temporarily in conflict with his uncle Ortelius, who held Familist and spiritualist views. In 1594 he married his first wife, Maria, daughter of Lodewijk Theus, an elder of the Dutch church in London, but by 30 November that year she was dead. In 1597 he went on a grand tour, seeing the major cities in southern Germany, in Italy, where he travelled as far as Naples, and in the United Provinces, <i>en route</i> visiting many of the leading intellectuals of the day, with whom he later regularly corresponded. Among them were the Bohemian humanist and intelligencer Jacob Monau and the son of the famous Leiden printer Franciscus Raphelengius, Franciscus junior; Franciscus Raphelengius himself expressed his admiration for Cool's elegant Latin. That Cool was a Latin scholar and poet of some capacity can be seen from the <span class="italic">Lacrymae</span> he wrote on the occasion of his uncle Abraham Ortelius's death in 1598 and from the verses attached to one of the later editions of Ortelius's great work, <span class="italic">Theatrum orbis terrarum</span>.<br>
<br>Cool's first two published works appeared in 1606. His deep scholarly interest in botany is demonstrated by his <span class="italic">Syntagma herbarum encomiasticum</span>, published in Leiden in 1606 under the Latin form of his name, Jacobus Colius; it is noteworthy that the Leiden botanist Carolus Clusius thought highly of Cool's botanical learning. The same year Cool married Louisa, daughter of the royal botanist to James I, Mathias de Lobel. Cool's Calvinist faith is prominent in his long descriptive poem about his personal experience of the outbreak and horrors of the plague in London in 1604, <span class="italic">Den staet van London in hare groote peste</span> (published in Middelburg in 1606), as in his two later works, on the interpretation of <span class="roman">Psalm 104</span>, <span class="italic">Paraphrasis &hellip; vanden CIV Psalm</span>, and on how to die as a good Christian, <span class="italic">Of Death, a True Description</span>.<br>
<br>For many years Cool played a prominent role within the Dutch community in London. In 1604 he provided the poetry for the community's triumphal arch and tableaux in connection with James I's coronation entry, and he was one of the leading members of the community who contributed poetry to the elegy for its learned minister Simon Ruytinck, who had died in 1621, which was published in Leiden in 1622. From 1624 he served the Dutch church in London as an elder. At the coronation of Charles I in 1625 Cool was made supervisor of the design for the then planned triumphal arch by the community. Here his contacts with leading English artists such as the poet Ben Jonson and the painter Francis Cleyn proved extremely useful to the church, and both were recruited for the work.<br>
<br>Cool died a very wealthy man on 20 May 1628: apart from his house in Lime Street and his house in Highgate, together with their furniture, jewellery, and paintings, he left more than &pound;5000 in money and a number of large silver gilt cups, not to mention his considerable library, and his collection of prints, statues, antique coins, and medals, much of which he had inherited from Abraham Ortelius. His wife, Louisa, survived him, but there were no children from either of his marriages.<br>
