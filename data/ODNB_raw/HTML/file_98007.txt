<span class="headword">James,  Evan</span> <span class="st"> [Ieuan ap Iago]</span>  (1809&#150;1878), <span class="occ">poet</span>, and <a name="cosubject_34151"></a><span class="headword">James James</span> <span class="st"> [Iago ap Ieuan]</span>  (1832&#150;1902), <span class="occ">musician</span>, father and son, composed respectively the words and music of &#145;Hen wlad fy nhadau&#146; (&#145;Land of my fathers&#146;), the national anthem of Wales.<br>
<br>Evan James was born at 11 Castle Street, Caerphilly, Glamorgan, on 11 February 1809, the son of Evan James (1773&#150;1856) and his wife, Elizabeth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Stradling (<i>d</i>. 1824). He was the tenth of fourteen children, three of whom did not survive infancy. By 1813 his parents were living at the Ancient Druid inn, Argoed, Bedwellte, Monmouthshire.<br>
<br>The family had been involved in the business of cloth-weaving since the mid-eighteenth century, and it was this trade that the young Evan entered, as did several of his brothers. In 1832 he married Elizabeth Jones (<i>b</i>. 1810/11) of Eglwysilan, with whom he had seven children. By 1836 the family had moved to Evan's parental home, the Ancient Druid inn, which was at once a private residence, an inn, and a cloth factory. In 1847 he moved the family to Mill Street, Pontypridd, to take over a larger weaving and manufacturing concern previously operated by a Thomas Austin. Evan James lived in Pontypridd for the remainder of his life, and it is with this town that he and his son are most closely associated. He died in Pontypridd on 30 September 1878, and was buried with his wife in the cemetery of Carmel chapel, Pontypridd. Some of his library survives, and it reveals him as a widely read man. His poems were held in high regard and some were published in <span class="italic">Gardd Aberd&acirc;r</span> in 1854.<br>
<br>His eldest son, James James, was born on 4 November 1832, either at the Ancient Druid inn, or at the Old Inn in Pontaberbargoed, where his parents briefly lived. James James moved with the family to Pontypridd in 1847 and in the early 1850s married Cecilia (1830/31&#150;1892), the daughter of Morgan and Joan Miles of Pontypridd, with whom he had one son and two daughters. The son, Taliesin (1856&#150;1938), became a harpist and is described in the 1881 census returns as a &#145;professor of music&#146;.<br>
<br>James James worked for his father from the age of fifteen and is described as a &#145;traveller&#146; in the 1861 census, by which time, as a married man, he occupied a different house in the same street as his parents; but for most of his life he was an innkeeper, first at The Anchor at Walnut Tree Bridge, near Pontypridd, then the Colliers Arms, Mountain Ash, and finally The Swan, Aberaman. He was a harpist but had no reputation as a player. Indeed, his celebrity rests entirely on his contribution to &#145;Hen wlad fy nhadau&#146;. He composed other works but none was published, and surviving manuscript writings of his show him to be a musician of no particular talent. He died at 6 Hawthorn Terrace, Aberd&acirc;r, on 11 January 1902.<br>
<br>The status of &#145;Hen wlad fy nhadau&#146; was enhanced by several romanticized accounts of the inspirational process that led to father and son writing it. A letter from James James published in the <span class="italic">South Wales Daily News</span> on 17 March 1884 gives the composer's own account, which is disarmingly straightforward. The tune was written by James in January 1856, to words already composed by his father; it was given the title &#145;Glan Rhondda&#146;. In 1858 the harpist Thomas Llewelyn (Llewelyn Alaw) submitted it, with James's permission, to an eisteddfod competition at Llangollen for the best collection of unpublished Welsh airs. The adjudicator of that competition, the Chester organist John Owen (Owain Alaw), published it in the influential <span class="italic">Gems of Welsh Melody</span> in 1860 with a prefatory note that confirms James James's account of its composition: &#145;Composed in January 1856 by James James, Colliers Arms, Mountain Ash; Words by Mr Evan James, Pontypridd. English words with Symphonies, Accompaniment and Chorus by Owain Alaw.&#146; James James had given permission for the publication but did not approve minor changes made by Owen, who also, it appears, was entirely responsible for the harmonies. Performances of the song at various eisteddfodau and by touring Welsh soloists and choirs quickly popularized it, and by the 1880s it was being used as a national song.<br>
<br>James's letter to the <span class="italic">South Wales Daily News</span> was stimulated by an extended correspondence in that paper and its rival publication the <span class="italic">Western Mail</span> concerning charges that the song was plagiarized. The allegation was made in the <span class="italic">South Wales Daily News</span> on 6 March 1884 by Frederick Atkins, an English-born Oxford graduate working in Cardiff as a schoolteacher, who claimed that it was taken &#145;note for note&#146; from a song called (with numerous variants) &#145;Tiptin o rosin&#146;. The <span class="italic">Western Mail</span> immediately launched an attack on its rival's Anglicized, establishment, &#145;anti-Welsh&#146; attitudes, and for two weeks numerous authorities were asked to pass judgement on the authenticity of James's creation. In fact the two songs have only a passing similarity over a couple of bars. The issue was absurdly inflated and seems to have been worked up by the <span class="italic">Western Mail</span> to promote its self-appointed pro-Welsh posture. It did, however, serve to raise the status of the piece even further. Engravings of James and his father are reproduced in Percy Scholes's article on the composition of &#145;Hen wlad fy nhadau&#146; which was published in the <span class="italic">National Library of Wales Journal</span> in 1943. The article also contains a facsimile of the autograph manuscript of the song.<br>
<br>James James was buried at Aberd&acirc;r cemetery. His death passed without comment in either of the newspapers that had focused so much attention on him in 1884. He was, however, included in the dictionaries of Welsh biographies compiled by T. Mardy Rees and T. R. Roberts, both published in 1908, and in 1912 in the supplement to the <span class="italic">DNB</span> covering those who died between 1901 and 1911, where Daniel Lleufer Thomas described how the song he had written with his father became &#145;recognised by Welshmen in all parts of the world&#146; as &#145;the national anthem of Wales&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>). By 1909 a committee in Pontypridd had begun raising contributions for a memorial to the song's joint authors. Public subscriptions paid for the statues of them by Sir William Goscombe John, unveiled at Ynysangharad Park, Pontypridd, on 23 July 1930. James's son, Taliesin, played the harp at the unveiling.<br>
