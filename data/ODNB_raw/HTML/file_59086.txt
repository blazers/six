<span class="headword">Seabury,  Samuel</span>  (1729&#150;1796), <span class="occ">first bishop of the Protestant Episcopal church in the United States of America</span>, was born on 30 November 1729 at Groton, Connecticut, the son of Samuel Seabury (1706&#150;1764) and Abigail Mumford. His father was a missionary, under the jurisdiction of the bishop of London, working for the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel (SPG). The young Seabury attended Yale College (1745&#150;8), where he studied ten subjects and subscribed to penal laws which forbade him &#145;to play at swords (nor) go into any tavern&#146;  (Dexter, 2.7). Having graduated BA (and later proceeded MA), he worked as a catechist before going to Edinburgh University (1752) to study medicine for one year&#151;regarded as a basic necessity for one proposing to become a missionary. He was examined by the SPG and ordained deacon and priest in 1753 with the hope that he would &#145;prove a very diligent and useful missionary&#146;  (SPG, abstract of proceedings, 1753&#150;4, 57, Bodl. RH).<br>
<br>After returning to the colonies Seabury was successively rector of New Brunswick, New Jersey, of Jamaica, of Long Island, and of Westchester, New York, where he served until 1776. On 12 October 1756 he married Mary (1736&#150;1780), the daughter of Edward Hicks of New York, with whom he had six children. He reported regularly to the SPG in London, expressing, among other things, his concern &#145;that Quakerism is the seat of Infidelity&#146;  (SPG, letters, 1759, 114, Bodl. RH) and noting &#145;the differences encountered by the number of Deists&#146;  (ibid., 1762, 160). As a result of his experience at Westchester he pleaded for an episcopate in the colonies to confirm communicants and sustain the work of the American mission. His letters also show his awareness of colonial resentment of Britain's policy of imperial taxation, though he remained totally loyal; in 1766&#151;the year of the <span class="roman">Declaratory Act</span>&#151;he was one of 312 signators &#145;determined to support the Constitution at the hazard of lives and property&#146;  (Beardsley, 23). Seabury's convictions were put to the test when he was briefly imprisoned in 1775 by the revolutionary forces in Connecticut, following the publication of a series of pamphlets attacking patriot institutions including the continental congress. In a long letter to the SPG he reported that he had closed his church. &#145;There would be neither prayer nor sermon&#146; until he could pray for George III, he wrote, while assuring the society (which paid him &pound;50 a year) that he would not leave his mission &#145;so long as it was practical to stay&#146;  (SPG New York Letters B2 and 3, 29 Dec 1776, Bodl. RH). This, and subsequent letters, give a graphic account of troop movements while conceding that both revolutionaries and loyalists plundered and foraged. Seabury accepted an appointment as a chaplain to the king's forces under General William Hume and spent much of the war in New York. His loyalty and piety were rewarded with an honorary doctorate of divinity from the University of Oxford (1777). The SPG, &#145;sensible of his great worth&#146;  (annual report, 1777, 46), continued to pay his stipend until a change of policy as late as 1785; thereafter friends in Britain ensured him an income for the rest of his life.<br>
<br>In early 1783 Seabury was invited by a group of ten Connecticut clergymen led by the Revd John Rutgers Marshall to become the first bishop of a national episcopal church in the United States. In July 1783 he travelled to England to seek consecration as their bishop. The stumbling-block, however, was the obligation to take an oath to the crown, to which Seabury, now a citizen of the United States, could not subscribe. Moreover, an Erastian church could not justify consecration without the consent of the state of Connecticut. Instead Seabury, recalling his Scottish links of thirty years earlier, approached the Scottish nonjuring bishops, the descendants of ministers who had refused to swear the oath of allegiance to William and Mary. At first they too were reluctant to grant Seabury's request until they received assurance that Britain recognized the United States. The Scottish bishops also received the implicit support of the archbishop of Canterbury, who asked that the Scottish prelates &#145;would not send the suppliant away empty-handed&#146;  (letter of 20 Nov 1783, Wilberforce, 205). Delays continued throughout 1784. Seabury wrote home that &#145;the expense of continuing another winter is greater than will suit my purse&#146;  (letter to Myles Cooper, 1 Aug 1784, Beardsley, 114), while the nonjuring Bishop John Skinner noted that he did not want it to be thought &#145;we always fished in troubled waters&#146;  (Beardsley, 107). It was not until 14 November that Seabury was consecrated as bishop of Connecticut in a discreet ceremony at a house in Aberdeen in the presence of three of the four Scottish bishops.<br>
<br>An agreement, known as the <span class="roman">Concordat</span>, was signed acknowledging full communion between the episcopalians of Scotland and Connecticut. In particular, the new bishop&#151;the first protestant bishop on American soil&#151;agreed to recommend that the form of communion service to be followed in the United States should be closer in style and theology to the Scottish office of 1746 than to the English <span class="roman">Book of Common Prayer</span> (1662). &#145;By gentle methods of argument and persuasion to introduce it by degrees into practice&#146;  (<span class="roman">Concordat</span>, article 5, GD 530/571/14, NA Scot.), was the guidance. Bishop Skinner wrote to the archbishop of Canterbury that Seabury seemed &#145;a truly pious, prudent and well-principled man&#146;  (<span class="italic">Scottish Guardian</span>, 25 Nov 1884).<br>
<br>Finally, in May 1785 Seabury returned home to New London, Connecticut. Two years later William White and Samuel Provoost were able to be consecrated in London, after an act of parliament (1786) had allowed such consecrations of men from outside the British dominions. Skinner wrote to Seabury hoping that there would &#145;be no occasion for two separate communions among the episcopalians&#146;  (Skinner to Seabury, 20 June 1787, Skinner, 67). He had no need to fear. Seabury, by &#145;gentle methods&#146;, brought &#145;a harmonious conclusion&#146;  (Wilberforce, 215) between the English and Scottish traditions when the prayer book and constitution of the Protestant Episcopal church in the United States were approved in 1790. Seabury was appointed the first presiding bishop and also assumed the see of Rhode Island.<br>
<br>Seabury spent the remainder of his life in the quiet pastoral care of his scattered flock. A contemporary saw him as someone to whom &#145;theological niceties were (an) aversion&#146;  (Abraham Jarvis, 5 May 1796, Beardsley, 361). He remained a poor man on his meagre &pound;50 a year, and it was as a friend and physician to the deprived that he was remembered. Yet he had an awareness of the dignity of his office with a modesty of manner. To the question, &#145;How old are you, bishop?&#146;, he replied &#145;Old enough to be better than I am&#146;  (Beardsley, 365). He was robust in appearance, with a clear, sonorous voice, and it was at the end of a four-week journey of 134 miles on horseback through his two dioceses that he died, of apoplexy, on 25 February 1796 in New London. He was buried three days later in the public burial-ground there. The links he established with the Episcopal church in Scotland are commemorated in the enlargement, in 1948, of St Andrew's Cathedral in Aberdeen and in the consecration, in 1956, of a new bishop of Aberdeen by the then bishop of Connecticut.<br>
