<span class="headword">Thomas,  William</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1800), <span class="occ">architect</span>, was the son of Elizabeth and William Thomas (1710&#150;1800) of The Green, Pembroke; his father, &#145;a man of exemplary piety&#146;, claimed descent from the Flemish settlers of Pembrokeshire  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 70, 1800, 87). The date of his birth and details of his early life and training have not been established. By 1780, when he first exhibited an architectural drawing, Thomas was established in Marylebone, where he remained for the next twenty years, maintaining an office at Allsop's Buildings.<br>
<br>Thomas was something of a virtuoso: a surveyor and sophisticated architect, draughtsman, and engraver who enjoyed the company of artists and engineers. He exhibited eight times at the Royal Academy of Arts between 1780 and 1799, and was a member of the Society of Arts and of the Society of Civil Engineers (1781&#150;92). He advertised his competence by publishing <span class="italic">Original Designs in Architecture</span> (1783), a folio with twenty-seven plates (some his own engravings) of exemplary neo-classical designs for houses, interior features, and garden buildings. The 176 subscribers included nobility and politicians, architects&#151;notably Robert Adam, who influenced Thomas's designs&#151;several patrons, and fellow Pembrokeshire countrymen. His introduction was an interesting statement of the tension between architecture considered as a science and as an art, and also declared Thomas's attachment to a &#145;favourite science&#146;, probably civil engineering. Thomas's engravings included two executed commissions (Brownslade House, Pembrokeshire; the Surrey Chapel, Southwark), but his early work is not well documented. His principal commission was Willersley Castle, Derbyshire, for Sir Richard Arkwright, completed in 1790, an early example of an industrialist's castle&#150;house with Thomas's designs extending to the interior detail.<br>
<br>A portrait depicts Thomas in affluent middle age holding the design for Willersley Castle (RIBA, London). Latterly, Thomas was styled &#145;architect to HRH the Duke of Clarence&#146; (as was his pupil Thomas Dearn, who probably succeeded Thomas in practice) for his admired geometrical design for a &#145;grand Naval Obelisk&#146;, a monument commemorating the Royal Navy's victories which was to be erected near Portsmouth by public subscription under the duke's patronage  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 68, 1798, 24&#150;7). The design was exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1799 but Thomas died in October the following year (nine months after his father) and the monument was never erected. Thomas was buried at St Marylebone on 25 October 1800, and his drawings were subsequently auctioned at Covent Garden. He seems never to have married and there is no surviving memorial to him.<br>
