<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Coke,  Thomas William</span>, first earl of Leicester of Holkham  (1754&#150;1842), <span class="occ">politician and agriculturist</span>, was born in London on 6 May 1754 and baptized at St James's, Piccadilly, on 22 May, the eldest son of Wenham Roberts Coke (1717&#150;1776), a landowner, and his second wife, Elizabeth Chamberlayne-Denton (<i>d</i>. 1810), the daughter of George Chamberlayne-Denton of Hillesden, Buckinghamshire.<h2>
<a name="Educationandearlyparliamentarycareer"></a>Education and early parliamentary career</h2>Coke was educated at Eton College (1765&#150;71), after which he travelled abroad (between 1771 and 1774), spending lengthy periods in Turin and Rome, and visiting Naples, Florence, Vienna, and Paris. A strikingly handsome man, he was the subject of a flamboyant portrait by Pompeo Batoni (1774). Following his return to England he married, on 5 October 1775, his cousin Jane Lennox Dutton (1753&#150;1800), the daughter of James Lennox Dutton of Loughcrew, co. Meath, and his second wife, Jane Bond. On the death of his father Coke succeeded to the family estates in Norfolk, and in May 1776 was returned as MP for the county. An archetypal whig country gentleman, he was a staunch supporter of Charles James Fox but an irregular speaker in the house. He was most likely to be found addressing his fellow MPs on agricultural matters, partly because he believed the landed interest to be neglected by the government. He claimed to be an unwilling politician, and recalled at the close of his political career in 1833: &#145;when I first offered myself for this county, I did so with great reluctance, for I had no wish to come into Parliament. I was no orator, no politician&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 316). He stood because he was convinced by a number of local gentlemen that unless he did so a tory would take the seat: &#145;at the mention of a Tory coming in &hellip; my blood chilled all over me from head to foot, and I came forward&#146;  (ibid., 316). Be that as it may, he entered parliament as the youngest member elected that year and sat for fifty-six years with only one major interruption, from 1784 to 1790.<br>
<br>At the 1784 general election Coke was one of Fox's so-called martyrs when he did not present himself for re-election. He temporarily retired to Norfolk, where in 1776 he had inherited a 30,000 acre estate with a rental income in 1780 of &pound;13,118. Although the estate was well managed, with a substantial house, Holkham, completed by Matthew Brettingham in 1765, it also carried considerable debts as a result of building and of unwise speculation by his predecessors in the South Sea Company in 1720. Coke set about improving the estate. He bought up additional properties to round out his landholdings, he promoted enclosure acts in parishes where open fields still survived, and he encouraged his farmers to adopt new rotations designed to improve the output and productivity of the soil. The Park (or Home) Farm was cultivated to the highest technical standards, and the continuous experimentation was brought to the attention of a wider audience through the annual sheep shearings he instituted in 1800. This development followed the death of the acknowledged champion of improved farming, the fifth duke of Bedford. The shearings were for many years a highlight of the farming calendar until they were discontinued in 1821.<br>
<br>In 1790, after a careful canvass, Coke was returned unopposed as MP for Norfolk, and he subsequently became a frequent if not always regular attendant at the house, particularly when agricultural issues were discussed. He represented Norfolk, with one short break (1806&#150;7), until 1832. Although he never held government office, he was a member of the board of agriculture from 1793. He opposed the war with France, and met regularly with other whig leaders at Holkham. On 8 April 1794 he complained in the house that Norfolk was &#145;very dissatisfied with the war&#146;  (Thorne). It was again Norfolk interests which he had in mind when supporting a motion for peace early in January 1795: &#145;the county of Norfolk felt the danger to which the coast was exposed by the French getting possession of Holland, and wished for peace&#146;  (ibid.). A month later he defended the Norwich petition for peace. Early in 1796 he was associated with a bill designed to amend the game laws to fix a later start to the game-shooting season.<br>
<br>From 1797 Coke was able to control the return of the second Norfolk MP, and in the longer term this led to animosity against him on the grounds that his political control appeared to be turning the county into the equivalent of a pocket borough. The issue came to a head in 1815. Although Coke, as a whig, supported the parliamentary reform cause, he always voted for the protection of agricultural interests, and this caused problems when he supported the corn law proposals in 1815. He addressed a meeting in Norwich in March, after which he was threatened with physical injury by an anti-corn law mob, and he was apparently saved only when a butcher by the name of Kett let loose a bull which hastily dispersed the crowd. Undaunted, on 6 June he presented a county petition in favour of the corn law.<br>
<br>In the aftermath of this incident, it was alleged in Norfolk that Coke's agricultural improvements were detrimental rather than beneficial to the local countryside. The &#145;reputed injury&#146;, Dr Edward Rigby told the Norwich Philosophical Society in December 1816 during a spirited defence of Coke, &#145;was charged with producing various ill consequences, and depriving the poor of employment, and rendering corn dear&#146;. Rigby argued that this was a misunderstanding: &#145;what before was, probably, principally a meagre sheep walk here and there only, exhibiting patches of ordinary rye, oats, barley and badly cultivated turnips, with not a single ear of wheat being seen &hellip; has become most productive land&#146;  (Rigby, 3.45). Rigby's was the first of a series of defences, most of which depended on Coke's own account of events at Holkham. In Earl Spencer's words in 1842, Coke was &#145;the only person now living who is able to recollect the former state of this district, and to tell the means by which it has been improved into its present flourishing condition&#146;  (Spencer, 2). This, however, was in the future.<h2>
<a name="Reputationasanagriculturalimprover"></a>Reputation as an agricultural improver</h2>In 1816 Coke had a political agenda because he was anxious to show that the new husbandry he was promoting, although requiring farm consolidation, increased rather than diminished employment opportunities by bringing into cultivation previously unused land. What Coke helped to foster from 1816 onwards was little less than a mythical view of his own achievements, and the older he grew the fewer were the number of contemporaries who could question his interpretation. He claimed, in Spencer's words, that when he inherited the estate in 1776:<blockquote>the whole district round Holkham was unenclosed, and the cultivation was of the most miserable character &hellip; no manure was purchased, and very little, and that of no value, was produced on the farm. The sheep were of the old Norfolk breed, and, with the exception of a few milch cows, there were no cattle kept upon any of the farms. (Spencer, 2)</blockquote>His interest in agricultural improvement was sparked when in 1778 one of the tenants on his property refused a renewal of his lease at 5<i>s</i>. an acre. Coke decided to work the land himself, and since he knew little about farming he gathered around him a number of practical men, and each year invited farmers from neighbouring districts to examine his farm and discuss its management. These meetings gradually developed by 1800 into the famous sheep shearings. Coke also claimed that, by adopting an improved course of husbandry, including the regular application of marl and an increase in livestock, the land was rapidly improved, and in 1787 wheat was cultivated for the first time. Gradually, as a result of his initiative, the old farming systems fell into disrepute and he converted west Norfolk from a rye-growing into a wheat-producing district. The only help he acknowledged was from the tenant farmers, who were carefully restricted by their lease covenants to ensure good farming. Coke also claimed to have improved the breeds of sheep, cattle, and pigs on his estate, and as a result to have raised the rent from &pound;2200 in 1776 to more than &pound;20,000 forty years later&#151;at the same time spending more than &pound;100,000 on farm houses and outbuildings.<br>
<br>Coke's version of events was widely accepted in the nineteenth century, and he came to enjoy the reputation of being a pioneer of the English agricultural revolution. Obituarists went into raptures: Coke had &#145;raised forests where there was scarcely a blade of grass; from which, should it be required, the British navy may be hereafter amply supplied&#146;. A vessel had been launched in 1832 &#145;built of oak produced from acorns planted by Mr Coke himself&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 316&#150;17). More recently a reappraisal has taken place, and it is now accepted that much of what passed for fact was a carefully controlled exercise in public relations designed primarily to enhance his own reputation. Agriculture in north-west Norfolk was already well advanced when Coke inherited the Holkham estate from his father in 1776: Arthur Young had commented several years earlier on the great quantities of wheat already being grown, and in 1784 he was to single out Coke for praise because he had done so well &#145;in the midst of the best husbandry in Norfolk&#146;  (Young, 353). Many of the innovations Coke claimed to have pioneered were known and practised long before 1776; the farm which, according to his account, he had taken in hand in 1778 had actually been the home farm since 1721 (although he did extend it), and rents on the estate doubled between 1776 and 1816 (much as they did on similar land elsewhere in this period). Unfortunately Coke's response to the accusations levelled against him in 1816 led him into serious exaggeration, and the image had then to be maintained. At the 1819 sheep shearing Coke proposed a toast to Dr Rigby, who in turn took the opportunity of his response to re-emphasize the poverty of Norfolk before Coke inherited his family estates.<br>
<br>Much of the improvement which came to be attributed to Coke predated his inheritance of the estate and, equally, much of it was the work of tenant farmers upon whom Coke depended, and whose progress impressed visitors as much as the Park Farm. However, the myth became greater than the reality, particularly after Coke no longer needed it to serve a political purpose. By the time Spencer wrote in 1842 the drift of Coke's argument was to emphasize his own role in more or less transforming English agriculture. These views were later adopted by other writers, notably Lord Ernle, who wrote that between 1778 and 1842 Coke &#145;stood at the head of the new agricultural movement&#146;  (Prothero, 217), and that he had turned a landscape without wheat, with only scanty crops of rye and undernourished animals, into a thriving and progressive agricultural estate. At a later date he had helped to disseminate such knowledge more widely through the activities of his tenants, and through agricultural meetings convened at Holkham.<br>
<br>Coke's smokescreen all too easily obscured the undoubtedly important innovations he promoted. His farmers were on twenty-one-year leases, and from 1815 they were expected to follow the Norfolk four-course rotation of turnips, barley, grass, and corn. Although some were less conscientious than others, there is little reason to doubt that they largely worked their land in accordance with the terms of their leases, and Coke was himself of the view that his leases were the main reason for the improvements which took place on his estates. He was undoubtedly a pioneer of agricultural change, but he is no longer considered to have played the key role he attributed to himself over the period 1816&#150;42.<br>
<br>In February 1816 Coke vouched in parliament for the agricultural distress, and he spoke against the renewal of the property tax and wartime malt taxes. He continued to speak on agricultural issues for the rest of his parliamentary career, and in February 1822 he introduced the Norfolk agricultural petition into the house in which it was argued that the present misery suffered by farmers was a result of high taxation causing distress.<h2>
<a name="Remarriageandretrenchment"></a>Remarriage and retrenchment</h2>Coke and his first wife, who died on 2 June 1800, had three daughters, to each of whom he gave a portion of &pound;30,000. On 26 February 1822, at the age of sixty-seven, and after twenty-two years as a widower, he married for the second time. His bride was his goddaughter, Lady Anne Amelia Keppel (1803&#150;1844), the daughter of William Charles Keppel, fourth earl of Albemarle, and his first wife, Elizabeth Southwell; she was fifty years his junior, and seven years younger than his granddaughter. Coke was supposed to have married &#145;in consequence of dissatisfaction with his nephew and heir presumptive&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 317), although other accounts suggest that he had originally intended her to marry his nephew and heir but the young people refused to marry. The difference in their ages led to considerable speculation in the newspaper gossip columns. The couple had five sons and a daughter, of whom the eldest son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32484/', "Thomas William Coke")</script>, agriculturist and landowner, was born on 26 December 1822.<br>
<br>Coke's remarriage led to an investigation of his financial position. In addition to extensive land purchases he spent perhaps &pound;40,000 on elections, and he claimed to have invested &pound;500,000 on estate improvements. As a result, between 1776 and 1822 his debts increased by &pound;133,000, by which time he was facing something of a crisis. His spending, or predicted spending, exceeded his income by about &pound;10,000, while debts and other charges on the estate amounted to nearly &pound;300,000. At the same time, as a result of the post-war agricultural depression, considerable rent arrears had developed, rent abatements had to be granted, and new tenants were needed. To tackle this crisis Coke's estate at Hillesden in Buckinghamshire was sold for &pound;127,000, and expenditure at Holkham was severely cut. Over the next twenty years, partly because Coke now had a son to succeed him, the burden of debt was gradually reduced&#151;in 1828, for example, a mortgage of &pound;10,000 outstanding since 1759 was finally redeemed. The total stood at only &pound;8000 when he died.<br>
<br>Coke, despite his claims about providing agricultural work, was happy to break up labourers' protests in 1831, and in 1834 he welcomed the new poor law. It seems unlikely that farm labourers on his estate shared the respect, admiration, and gratitude that his tenants felt for him. He retired from the Commons at the end of the last unreformed parliament, having been for many years &#145;father of the house&#146;. To celebrate his retirement a public dinner was given at St Andrew's Hall, Norwich, on 12 April 1833, with the duke of Sussex in the chair and more than 500 people sitting down to eat.<h2>
<a name="Peerageandfinalyears"></a>Peerage and final years</h2>Coke claimed to have rejected a peerage on six separate occasions. The offers were made in 1776 by the duke of Portland as a bribe to desert Fox, in 1778 by Lord North, in 1783 by Portland and again when he joined Pitt, in 1794, in 1806 by Charles James Fox, in 1831 by Earl Grey, and in 1837 by Lord Melbourne. He turned down the 1806 offer because &#145;he felt he could serve his country better as a commoner than as a peer&#146;  (Thorne). He accepted the offer in 1831 on the grounds that &#145;every measure for which I was most eager will be completed upon the Reform being carried; I have now sons, and feel, as a father, I should not be justified in refusing your offer&#146;  (Stirling, 556). Unfortunately the proposal was rejected by the king, apparently on the grounds that Coke had insulted George III. However, after enjoying for many years the unofficial title of &#145;the first commoner of England&#146;, he was eventually created earl of Leicester of Holkham and Viscount Coke on 12 August 1837, following Queen Victoria's accession. He had wanted to revive the title which had become extinct on the death in 1759 of his great-uncle, despite the fact that the Townshend family at that time had an earldom of Leicester. His ambition was achieved by taking the title earl of Leicester of Holkham, although he seems not to have intended to use the last two words.<br>
<br>Coke was the archetypal country gentleman. At Holkham he was a delightful host who loved hunting, shooting, and gambling as well as&#151;by repute&#151;cock fighting and bull baiting. He was a master of fox hounds, and numerous stories were told of his prowess in field sports. The Revd W. B. Daniel wrote in 1813 that &#145;Mr Coke is so capital a marksman that as he inflicts death whenever he pulls the trigger, he should in mercy forbear such terrible examples of his skill&#146;  (Stirling, 208). He was also a keen game preserver. He was active in the Norfolk yeomanry during the French wars, as major commandant of the Holkham yeomanry (1798), and captain (1803) and lieutenant-colonel in the West Norfolk yeomanry cavalry (1804).<br>
<br>Coke died at Longford Hall, Derbyshire, on 30 June 1842, aged eighty-eight, after a short illness during which&#151;according to his doctor&#151;&#145;now and then in his sleep he talked about his farms&#146;  (Stirling, 596). On 11 July he was buried in the family mausoleum attached to Tittleshall church, Norfolk. A memorial column depicting agricultural scenes commemorating his work in Norfolk was erected at Holkham by public subscription. Coke was succeeded by his eldest son, Thomas William, Viscount Coke. His widow married the Right Hon. Edward Ellice MP, in June 1843, and died in childbirth on 22 July 1844.<br>
