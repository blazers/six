<span class="headword">Strickland,  William</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1598), <span class="occ">member of parliament</span>, was the son of Roger Strickland and his wife, Mary Appleton. He married Elizabeth, daughter of Sir William Strickland of Westmorland, and had two sons and three daughters. Described as &#145;founder of the house of Strickland of Boynton&#146;  (<span class="italic">VCH Yorkshire, North Riding</span>, 2.475), he or his heir, Walter, built Boynton Hall, near Bridlington, Yorkshire. Strickland steadily accumulated estates in Yorkshire, including the manors of Auburn, Coneysthorpe, Hildenley, and Wintringham, and lands in Bridlington and Easton. As a substantial country gentleman, described in 1564 as one of the &#145;favorers of Religion&#146;  (Bateson, 71), he was appointed to various commissions in the province of York (concerning sedition, recusancy, and heresy) and, in the East Riding, as justice of the peace (from 1559), a commissioner of sewers, and, in 1572, one of those responsible for raising cavalry and foot soldiers.<br>
<br>Strickland also represented Scarborough in four Elizabethan parliaments. There is no surviving record of his activity there in 1559 or 1563&#150;1566/7. In 1571, however, he was prominent as one of those seeking further reformation in the Elizabethan church. On 6 April, Strickland, described by an anonymous diarist as &#145;a grave and auncient man of greate zeale, and not perhapps (as hee himself thought) unlearned&#146;  (Hartley, 1.200), informed the house that a fellow member, Thomas Norton, held a newly published copy of the unadopted Edwardian revision of the canon law, the <span class="italic">Reformatio legum</span>, and required him to produce it. He also complained of shortcomings in the prayer book and the quality of the clergy. Norton duly produced the <span class="italic">Reformatio legum</span>, and a committee, including Strickland, was appointed to confer with the bishops about it. Next day he called upon Norton to deliver a series of reform measures, known as the ABC bills. On 14 April he introduced his own bill to reform the prayer book. He was resisted by members of the privy council, which summoned him to its presence during the Easter recess and sequestered him from parliament. On 20 April this provoked an animated Commons debate about the liberties of the house. Next day Strickland was restored to his place there and promptly named to the committee on the bill for coming to church. He was also appointed to committees for bills concerning priests in disguise, maintenance of navigation, corrupt presentations, and tillage. Strickland's role in this parliament has been a subject of extended historical debate. He was for long seen as a leading figure in a reforming protestant (or puritan) party which launched an organized parliamentary campaign in 1571. Although this is no longer accepted, he was clearly working with Norton, John Foxe (who wrote the preface for the new edition of the <span class="italic">Reformatio</span>), and others to effect further reformation within the English church.<br>
<br>Perhaps his experience in 1571, or simply advancing years, taught Strickland discretion. Whatever the explanation, his parliamentary performance in 1584&#150;5 was circumspect, largely confined to membership of committees to scrutinize, amend, or add to a variety of bills: the observance of the sabbath; fraudulent conveyances; unlawful marriage licences; excessive fees in ecclesiastical courts; and continuance of statutes. However, while he may have been publicly cautious, with only one recorded&#151;and uncontroversial&#151;speech, he was still dedicated to religious reformation, as most of these bills indicate. Furthermore, the seemingly innocuous <span class="roman">Continuance Bill</span>, which extended the life of acts with a limited time-span, included the <span class="roman">Maintenance of Navigation Act</span> and its controversial fish day clause. This statutory designation of Wednesday as a compulsory fish day smacked of Catholic practice and offended godly protestants. On 6 March, Strickland offered a proviso to the continuance of statutes committee, to which, five days later, he was appointed. When the <span class="roman">Continuance Bill</span> came out of committee, the fish day clause had gone. One can only speculate on Strickland's precise role. It was his last parliament. He remained a dutiful Yorkshire country gentleman until his death in 1598.<br>
