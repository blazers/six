<span class="headword">Coppard,  Alfred Edgar</span>  (1878&#150;1957), <span class="occ">short-story writer and poet</span>, was born on 4 January 1878 at 35 St John's Street, Folkestone, Kent, the eldest child and only son of the four children of George Coppard (<i>d</i>. 1887?), a journeyman tailor, and Emily Alma Southwell, who had been a housemaid. They were &#145;shockingly poor&#146;, although as Coppard was to recall in his unfinished autobiography, published posthumously, the two rooms comprising his first home were &#145;snug enough&#146;  (Coppard). But it was not until they moved to Brighton, when Coppard was five, that their fortunes improved sufficiently for them to live for a time as sole tenants of a house. Supposed ill health terminated Coppard's schooling at nine, but it was his father's death which made it necessary for him to go out to work as an assistant to a street vendor of paraffin and firewood. Perhaps because of this poverty, Frank O'Connor described Coppard's early life as &#145;cruel&#146;  (O'Connor, 171), although in his autobiography Coppard characteristically expressed its freedom and pleasures. By the time he was twenty, Coppard had worked for an auctioneer, a cheesemonger, a soap agent, and a carrier. He next spent several years in the office of an engineering firm, and then in 1907 moved to Oxford as confidential clerk in the Eagle ironworks (attached to Lucy's factory). On 5 August 1905 Coppard married Lily Annie (<i>b</i>. 1881/2), daughter of Albert Richardson, a plumber, of Brighton. After her death he married Winifred May, daughter of Dirk de Kok, solicitor, of South Africa; they had a son and a daughter.<br>
<br>It was on 1 April 1919 that Coppard gave up his business occupation and became a full-time professional writer. &#145; &#147;All Fools&#148; Day was truly the congenital date of it&#146;, he recalled  (Coppard), for he had saved only &pound;50. Indeed, his office colleagues thought he was &#145;daft&#146;. Nevertheless, many years later he was honoured by his old firm, which showed great pride in his literary achievement.<br>
<br>Coppard's early enthusiasm for reading and study had not lessened while he was a clerk, and he gained sufficient success as a spare-time athlete to use the prize-money to buy books and shape himself for his literary vocation. He appreciated the atmosphere of Oxford, where he &#145;was fired, though not by any more worthy muse than the spirit of rivalry&#146;  (Coppard). The deep impression made on his creative mind by Chekhov, Maupassant, Thomas Hardy, Katherine Mansfield, and the short stories of Henry James had already determined him to concentrate on the genre of the short story. But in his first three months as a freelance he sold only &#145;one little tale, one little poem, and received twenty rejections&#146;  (Coppard). It was therefore a timely relief and encouragement when an American periodical paid him &pound;50 for &#145;The Tiger&#146;, a piece of a few thousand words.<br>
<br>In 1921 Coppard's first collection, <span class="italic">Adam and Eve and Pinch Me</span>, was published by Harold Taylor, the young owner of the Golden Cockerel Press, who had been impressed by Coppard's early efforts. This volume was the forerunner of a lengthy series of collected short stories. Coppard received early praise from Ford Madox Ford, who wrote: &#145;He is almost the first English prose-writer to get into English prose the peculiar quality of English lyric poetry&#151;the fancy, the turn of the imagination, the wisdom &hellip; and the beauty of the great lyricists&#146;  (Ford, 173). Coppard was an innovator in the English short story: he frequently presented a woman's point of view, and his writing strongly conveys the mystery and unpredictability of life. Like many short-story writers, he showed a preference for the misfit and the underdog. The hatred and dismay that he was made to feel by injustice and cruelty caused him to become prominent in the peace movement.<br>
<br>Coppard ranks with contemporaries such as Se&aacute;n O'Faol&aacute;in and T. F. Powys in the history of the short story, although his best work is closer in spirit to that of Thomas Hardy. Poetry as well as prose occupied him from the outset, and <span class="italic">Hips and Haws</span>, the first of five volumes of lyrics, came out in the same year as his second book of stories, <span class="italic">Clorinda Walks in Heaven</span> (1922). However, Coppard's verse is undistinguished, and his finest poetry is to be found in his short stories. Between 1921 and 1951 hardly a year passed without a publication bearing the imprint A. E. Coppard: <span class="italic">Fishmonger's Fiddle</span> (1925), <span class="italic">The Field of Mustard</span> (1926), <span class="italic">Silver Circus</span> (1928), <span class="italic">Nixey's Harlequin</span> (1931), <span class="italic">Crotty Shinkwin</span> (1932), and <span class="italic">Dunky Fitlow</span> (1933) are the titles he invented for what proved to be his best successes. <span class="italic">It's me, O Lord!</span> was the title given to the first part of his autobiography, published a few months after his death of a heart attack in the Royal Northern Hospital, Islington, London, on 13 January 1957.<br>
<br>Coppard's closing years were heartened by the Book of the Month Club of America, which issued his <span class="italic">Selected Tales</span> (1946) to its vast membership, the first occasion on which it had made a work of this kind its leading choice. The undergraduates of Oxford paid him tribute with a celebration of his seventy-fifth birthday, attended by many distinguished personages, including Sir Maurice Bowra, the vice-chancellor. Coppard's many friends appreciated his twinkling eyes and a face suggesting the kindest of laughter. His last home, at Hillside, Duton Hill, Dunmow, Essex, delighted him, with its encircling trees, and birds so tame that he would pretend to be cross with them whenever they became too obtrusive. He spent a term on a rural council, and shared his second wife's enthusiasm when she was appointed assistant county medical officer in mid-Essex. She died in 1969, having become popular on television in frank discussions of family problems.<br>
