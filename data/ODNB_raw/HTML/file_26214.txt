<span class="headword">Stafford,  Richard Anthony</span>  (1797&#150;1854), <span class="occ">surgeon</span>, was born at Cropredy, Oxfordshire, the third son of Egerton Stafford (1763/4&#150;1843), vicar of Chalcombe and rector of Thenford in Northamptonshire, and his wife, Mary Lucy, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Wykeham (1769/70&#150;1840). He was baptized on 18 October 1797 at St Mary's, Witney, where his father was resident. Through his mother he was kin to William of Wykeham. Stafford was educated privately at Tamworth and was then apprenticed to two well-known medical practitioners of Cirencester, William Lawrence and Charles Warner, the former being father of the great surgeon Sir William Lawrence. Stafford travelled to London in 1820 and entered St Bartholomew's Hospital. Here he soon attracted the notice of John Abernethy, who appointed him his house surgeon for 1823&#150;4. He was admitted a member of the Royal College of Surgeons in 1824. He then spent a year in Paris.<br>
<br>Stafford returned to London in 1826 and began to practise as a surgeon. The Jacksonian prize was awarded to him in the same year for his essay &#145;On spina bifida&#146;. He was elected senior surgeon to the St Marylebone parish infirmary in 1831, and he was subsequently appointed surgeon-extraordinary to the duke of Cambridge. At the Royal College of Surgeons he was elected one of the first fellows, in 1843, and he was made a member of its council in 1848, though he was soon obliged to retire on account of ill health. He was elected Hunterian orator for 1851, and his oration was printed in the same year, though he was too ill to deliver it. He died, unmarried, on 15 January 1854, at 28 Old Burlington Street, London, aged fifty-six, and was buried in Kensal Green cemetery.<br>
<br>Stafford was a skilful surgeon, whose work was always founded on his very accurate anatomical knowledge. He was a voluminous writer whose publications included <span class="italic">A Series of Observations on Strictures of the Urethra</span> (1828), and <span class="italic">An Essay on the Treatment of some Affections of the Prostate Gland</span> (1840).<br>
