<span class="headword">Conybeare,  William John</span>  (1815&#150;1857), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and author</span>, was born on 1 August 1815 at Eliot Place, Lewisham, the eldest of six children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6129/', "William Daniel Conybeare (1787&#150;1857)")</script>, geologist and dean of Llandaff, and his wife, Sarah Anne, daughter of Captain Charles Rankin. The infant Conybeare enjoyed a peripatetic life determined by his father's geological interests, until in 1819 the family settled at Brislington, Bristol, moving to Sully, Glamorgan, in 1827. The following year Conybeare was sent to Westminster School, where his friends included George Lynch Cotton. While at the school he permanently damaged one eye, and in 1829 experienced the first serious bout of the ill health that dogged him throughout his life, obliging him to spend much time at home. In 1833 he went up to Trinity College, Cambridge, as a pensioner, where he won the college Greek Testament prize in 1834 and a scholarship in 1835. He graduated BA in 1837 as third classic and thirty-fifth wrangler; he was elected a minor fellow of Trinity in 1839, and on taking his MA in 1840 proceeded to a major fellowship. He served the college as third sub-lecturer and steward before being appointed mathematical lecturer in 1842.<br>
<br>Although he had joined Lincoln's Inn in 1840, Conybeare was then ordained deacon, and travelled in Italy and Greece before being ordained priest in 1841. He was subsequently appointed Whitehall preacher, serving until 1844. In 1842 Conybeare left Cambridge to become first principal of the Liverpool Collegiate Institution, a school &#145;for two social grades which lie between the higher ranks of English society on the one hand and those who send their children to National Schools on the other&#146;  (H. C. A. Conybeare, 36). On 22 December of the same year he married Eliza (1820&#150;1903), daughter of the Revd Joseph Rose of Rothley, Leicestershire, and first cousin once removed of Thomas Babington Macaulay. There were three children: John William Edward (1843&#150;1931), later vicar of Barrington, Cambridgeshire, historian of the county and convert to Roman Catholicism; Bruce Dicey (1846&#150;1850); and Grace (<i>b</i>. 1855).<br>
<br>When illness prompted Conybeare to resign his Liverpool post in 1848 his father presented him to the family living of Axminster, Devon, worth some &pound;1000 per annum. Here he co-operated with his college friend and successor at Liverpool, John Saul Howson, on <span class="italic">The Life and Epistles</span> (originally, in best Victorian fashion, <span class="italic">Life and Letters</span>) <span class="italic">of St Paul</span> (1852). His health worsened. In 1852 a supposedly therapeutic visit to the house in Funchal, Madeira, taken by his father for Conybeare's fatally consumptive brother, John Crawford William, probably caused his own tuberculosis. The next three years passed in further recuperative travel, Conybeare resigning Axminster in 1854. In 1856 he finally settled at Warren Cottage, Weybridge, Surrey, where he died from tuberculosis on 23 July 1857. He was buried in Weybridge; his father, taken ill travelling to visit him, succumbed three weeks after his son's death.<br>
<br>Conybeare's modern reputation rests on his activity as a reviewer and novelist during his last years (although <span class="italic">St Paul</span> enjoyed currency into the twentieth century, especially in the United States). The articles he wrote on religious subjects for the <span class="italic">Quarterly Review</span> (1847&#150;56) and the <span class="italic">Edinburgh Review</span> (1852&#150;4) exhibit a witty but occasionally brutally combative style: <span class="italic">The Record</span> dubbed him the &#145;BRUMMAGEN Sydney Smith&#146;  (3 Nov 1853). His character assassination of &#145;Bishop Phillpotts&#146;  (<span class="italic">Edinburgh Review</span>, 95, 1852) and his insightful study &#145;The church in the mountains&#146;  (ibid., 97, 1853) are often cited, but his most important and controversial article, published in the <span class="italic">Edinburgh Review</span>  (98, 1853) and in several subsequent revised editions, was &#145;Church parties&#146;. Containing numerical estimates of the strength of different factions of the mid-nineteenth-century Church of England and lively accounts of their clerical cultures, this remains the starting point for investigations into the subject, and popularized the term &#145;broad church&#146; as a description of liberal Anglicanism.<br>
<br>Conybeare's last major publication was the novel <span class="italic">Perversion, or, The Causes and Consequences of Infidelity</span> (1856), which drew on his articles and his own and friends' lives for a melodramatic account of the sources of scepticism in the extremes of contemporary religious culture (including&#151;unexpectedly through the character of an otherwise Flashmanesque villain&#151;Mormonism). If Conybeare's deficiencies as a novelist account in part for <span class="italic">Perversion</span>'s lukewarm reception, passages which suggested a <i>roman-&agrave;-clef</i> caused scandal, especially its blunt portrayal of homoeroticism in an Anglo-Catholic Oxford tutor (possibly modelled on Frederick William Faber). Others bemoaned <span class="italic">Perversion</span>'s lack of charity to scepticism: Richard Holt Hutton described it as a &#145;hard church novel&#146; and its author as a man of &#145;vigorous and somewhat menacing understanding&#146;  (Hutton, 127&#150;8). More recently <span class="italic">Perversion</span> has received attention as a significant example of the literature of the Victorian crisis of faith, one commentator characterizing it as &#145;a long and convincing argument by case history, rather than by sermonizing, for the liberal theological and practical views of Coleridge and Thomas Arnold&#146;  (Wolff, 283&#150;4). Taken together with the article literature and sermons, the novel identifies Conybeare's own theological position as what he dubbed &#145;normal broad church&#146;, with more sympathy for Thomas Arnold and Julius Charles Hare than Benjamin Jowett and Rowland Williams.<br>
