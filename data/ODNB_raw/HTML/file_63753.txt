<span class="headword">Sydall,  Elias</span>  (1671/2&#150;1733), <span class="occ">bishop of Gloucester</span>, was born in Norwich; his father was a glover but no further details of his parents are known. In 1688 he entered Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, as a bible clerk upon Archbishop Parker's foundation, and proceeded BA in 1691, MA in 1695, and DD, by royal mandate, in 1705. From 1696 to 1703 he was a fellow of Corpus Christi and in 1698 he served as university taxor. Having been ordained priest by John Moore, bishop of Norwich, in May 1697 he acted as priest-in-charge of St Benet's, Cambridge, from 1699 until 1702, when he was appointed chaplain to Thomas Tenison, archbishop of Canterbury and a former fellow of Corpus Christi. Tenison rapidly appointed Sydall to a succession of benefices in the diocese of Canterbury: Biddenden (held from 1702 to 1704), Ivychurch (held from 1704 to 1731), and Great Mongeham (held from 1707 to 1730). In 1707 Sydall also became prebendary of the fourth stall in Canterbury Cathedral, to which Tenison added the mastership of the hospitals of St John Northgate and St Nicholas, Harbledown, in 1711. On 29 June 1710, at St Mary Bredin, Canterbury, he married Mary Deedes (1688/9&#150;1758), daughter of William Deedes, a Canterbury physician.<br>
<br>During the eventful convocation of 1710, held in the aftermath of Dr Henry Sacheverell's trial, Sydall served as proctor for the clergy of Canterbury diocese and was one of the joint committee of both houses of convocation working under the guidance of the prolocutor, Francis Atterbury, to prepare a &#145;Representation of the present State of religion&#146;. However, Sydall did not share Atterbury's high-church convictions, and in the convocation of 1711 he attempted to prevent the passage of measures to censure the Arian opinions of William Whiston. Although it is recorded that Whiston had regarded him as one of the best candidates he had ever examined for orders Sydall seems to have felt no personal sympathy towards Arian doctrine: indeed in a subsequent diocesan proctorial election, in 1722, he enjoyed a decisive level of support from the orthodox clergy.<br>
<br>After the death of Queen Anne, in 1714, Sydall gave enthusiastic support to the new Hanoverian regime, publishing two sermons in 1715: <span class="italic">The Reasonableness of Rejoycing and Giving Thanks for his Majesty's Happy Accession</span> and a rhetorical piece preached at Canterbury on 5 November during the time of the Jacobite rising, <span class="italic">The insupportable yoke of popery, and the wickedness of bringing it in again upon these kingdoms, after so many deliverances from it; consider'd and apply'd, with regard to the present rebellion</span>. In this second performance Sydall denounced &#145;any kind of Tyranny, whether Ecclesiastical or Civil&#146;  (Todd, 207&#150;8) and scorned assurances offered to the Church of England by James Francis Edward Stuart, the exiled Stuart &#145;pretender&#146;. As a reward for such loyalty he was appointed a chaplain to George I in 1716, and held this office as well as that of chaplain to George II from 1727, until he was installed as dean of Canterbury, in succession to Dr George Stanhope, on 26 April 1728. Following the death of Archbishop Tenison in December 1715 Sydall was instrumental in ensuring that all due forms were observed by the Canterbury chapter during the election of Tenison's successor, William Wake, and was chosen to preach the sermon at the latter's primary visitation of the cathedral on 16 June 1716. He was one of the prebendaries trusted by Wake to keep him informed about chapter business, and was &#145;much respected&#146; at Canterbury &#145;as a polite Scholar, and much beloved as a mild and diffident Man&#146;  (ibid., 204).<br>
<br>On 11 April 1731 Sydall was consecrated at Ely House in London to succeed Dr Smalbroke in the bishopric of St David's. The consecrating bishops were Edmund Gibson, bishop of London, Thomas Green, bishop of Ely, and Thomas Sherlock, bishop of Bangor. On 2 November 1731, on the translation of Joseph Wilcocks to the bishopric of Rochester, Sydall was advanced to the see of Gloucester, and retained this, together with the deanery of Canterbury, until his death, in London, on 24 December 1733 at the age of sixty-one. He was buried in the chancel of St James's, Piccadilly, on 31 December 1733; his wife, who died in 1758, aged sixty-nine, was buried near by. There were no children of the marriage.<br>
