<span class="headword">Yonge, Sir  Walter</span>, third baronet  (<em>bap. </em>1653, <em>d.</em> 1731), <span class="occ">politician and friend of John Locke</span>, was baptized on 8 September 1653 at Sandford, Devon, the first surviving son of Sir Walter Yonge, second baronet (<i>c</i>.1626&#150;1670), politician, of Colyton, Devon, and his wife, Isabella (<i>bap</i>. 1631), daughter of Sir John Davie of Sandford, Devon. He matriculated at Exeter College, Oxford, in 1670, and in that year succeeded as third baronet. His background was presbyterian, his great-grandfather Walter and grandfather Sir John having been on the parliamentarian side in the civil war. Yonge's father sat in Richard Cromwell's parliament and at the Restoration was active for religious comprehension. In 1677, by a licence dated 19 April of that year, he married Gertrude (<i>d</i>. 1679), daughter of William Morice, an MP with presbyterian inclinations. They had no children.<br>
<br>Yonge first stood for parliament at Newport, Cornwall, in 1678, but was unsuccessful and soon turned to the family seat of Honiton, where he was the leading proprietor. He was MP for that town in eleven parliaments from 1679 to 1708, and once for Ashburton in 1689&#150;90. He was moderately active for Anthony Ashley Cooper, first earl of Shaftesbury, in the exclusion parliaments and was a member of the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/92786', "Green Ribbon Club")</script>. To dissenters he was &#145;sober&#146;, to tories a &#145;fanatic&#146;  (HoP, <span class="italic">Commons, 1660&#150;90</span>). He withstood the intrusion upon Honiton corporation by the high-churchman Sir Thomas Putt. Yonge also held a number of local offices, being commissioner of assessment for Devon in 1677&#150;80 and 1689&#150;90, deputy lieutenant for Devon from 1688 onwards, and colonel of militia foot from about 1697. He was also made a freeman of Lyme Regis in 1680 and of Plymouth in 1696.<br>
<br>In the 1680s Yonge's position was ambiguous. One historian places him with the revolutionary underground: he entertained the duke of Monmouth in 1680, was considered as a potential ally by the Rye House plotters in 1683, and was briefly arrested in 1685. But another historian calls him one of James II's &#145;Whig collaborators&#146;: he avoided Monmouth's rebellion, distrained on three rebel tenants, and in 1688 was appointed JP and nominated by James's electoral agents as a candidate for parliament. Yonge was sufficiently tainted that in the election to the convention of 1689 he had to fall back on the borough of his brother-in-law Richard Duke, Ashburton. However, he was soon busy in parliament demanding redress against the agents of &#145;popery and slavery&#146;, and sat on the committee for the <span class="roman">Toleration Act</span>. His first wife having died in 1679, on 18 June 1691 Yonge married Gwen, daughter of Sir Robert Williams, baronet, of Penrhyn, Cornwall. They had one son and four daughters.<br>
<br>John Locke called his west-country friends &#145;the Row&#146;, their estates running from north to south: Edward Clarke of Chipley near Taunton; Yonge, who built a new house at Escott, near Colyton, in the 1680s (he also had a London house in Bedford Row, Westminster); and Richard Duke of Otterton. In 1686 the Yonges and Dukes visited Locke in the Netherlands. Yonge received presentation copies of three of Locke's publications, and in the 1690s Yonge, with Clarke, John Freke, and John Somers, was part of Locke's &#145;college&#146; of parliamentary advisers. Yonge was a reliable drafter of legislation, though no orator. He interested himself in fiscal, banking, transport, and trade policy. He supported the <span class="roman">Triennial Act</span> and a bill for security of tenure of judges. He and his circle were active in defending the west-country textile industry. In the early 1690s he joined the steady assault on tory ministers, which bore fruit in the whig accession to power in 1694. In this year he was appointed a customs commissioner, a post he held until 1701 and again from 1714 to 1731. He remained loyal to Somers and the junto whigs, although in 1697 he opposed the government over wine duties, preferring to defend the west-country textile trade with Portugal. He became politically less active in the new century. He remained a consistent whig, opposing the occasional conformity bills and supporting the impeachment of the high-church clergyman Dr Sacheverell. He lost his seat in the tory landslide of 1710.<br>
<br>Yonge died on 18 July 1731, and was buried at Colyton. His son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30232/', "Sir William Yonge, fourth baronet")</script>, was one of the most loyal and unpopular supporters of the prime minister Sir Robert Walpole.<br>
