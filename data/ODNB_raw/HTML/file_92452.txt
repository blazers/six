<span class="headword">Sabraham,  Nicholas</span>  (<em>b. </em><em>c.</em>1325, <em>d.</em> in or after 1399), <span class="occ">soldier</span>, is of unknown origins, but it seems likely that he was a native of Northumberland, where by 1363 he had married Alice, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Graper, widow of Robert Orde and granddaughter of the merchant-administrator <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/38613/', "Richard Embleton (d. 1333)")</script>. His marriage brought Sabraham property in Jesmond, Burradon, and Newcastle. In 1375 he was a feoffee for Gilbert Umfraville, lord of Redesdale and nominally ninth earl of Angus, while in 1376 and 1380 he was one of two burgesses returned to parliament for Newcastle. However, Sabraham's life is known chiefly through his testimony given in the court of chivalry during the famous <i>Scrope v. Grosvenor</i> armorial dispute. Appearing at a hearing in the chapter house of York Minster on 17 September 1386, Sabraham defended the contested right of Richard Scrope, first Baron Scrope of Bolton, to bear the arms <i>azure a bend or</i>. His deposition reads like a potted history of fourteenth-century English military adventure. Aged over sixty in 1386, Sabraham told the court that he had been soldiering for thirty-nine years, and that he remembered members of the Scrope family wearing <i>azure a bend or</i> in a number of different wars. He first beheld the Scrope banner when serving under Edward Balliol in Scotland, probably in 1339; and for a second time in 1343 when he joined a night-time (&#145;by torchlight&#146;) raid through Peeblesshire in the company of William de Bohun, first earl of Northampton. He was again with Northampton in August 1346 when, massed in the second battle corps at Cr&eacute;cy, he saw the arms of Sir Henry Scrope (<i>d</i>. 1392). A year later Sabraham saw Sir William Scrope (<i>d</i>. 1367) at the siege of Calais; and he witnessed other Scropes armed <i>azure a bend or</i> in several further theatres of the Anglo-French war, in Normandy, Brittany, Gascony, and Spain.<br>
<br>Sabraham's lengthy r&eacute;sum&eacute;, as well as fortifying Richard Scrope's lawsuit, illustrates the breadth of war service common within the ranks of the professional soldiery, and is firsthand evidence of the so-called remilitarization of the wider English squirearchy. It has been argued that a longer-term shift in the demographics of military service to incorporate ever greater numbers of the lower-ranking nobility contributed much to the martial successes of the period, and helped to stimulate the emergence of the gentry class as a distinct social grouping. Of still greater interest, however, are the perspectives that Sabraham's account opens up on the mores prevailing in chivalric circles. Indeed, though never himself a knight, Sabraham's personal experience of that most knightly vocation of crusade bears testimony to the sharp appetite that persisted in all ranks of armigerous society for the honour of battle with the infidel, as well as attesting the wide range of crusading possibilities open to the determined fourteenth-century soldier.<br>
<br>Thus in his matter-of-fact deposition Sabraham informed the court that he had been a participant on King Peter of Cyprus's crusading expedition to Alexandria in October 1365, where he remembered seeing Sir Stephen Scrope being knighted by the Cypriot king &#145;immediately on landing&#146;. He went on to describe how he had been armed &#145;in Prussia, in Hungary, at Constantinople, at the Bras de St Jorge [Gallipoli], and at Messembria [Nessebar in Bulgaria]&#146;  (Nicholas, 1.124&#150;5). At Messembria, where he is likely to have joined the crusade of 1366&#150;7 led by Count Amadeus of Savoy, Sabraham visited a church containing the tomb of a fellow crusader, Sir Henry Scrope (<i>d</i>. 1361). Sabraham's dizzying tour of the battlefields of Christendom's frontiers constitutes a remarkable parallel with the literary adventures of that paragon of fourteenth-century English chivalry, the knight in Geoffrey Chaucer's <span class="italic">Canterbury Tales</span>; therefore it may not be surprising to learn that Chaucer, like Sabraham, gave evidence in the <i>Scrope v. Grosvenor</i> dispute. It is doubtful whether Chaucer knew Sabraham personally, but the contours of the latter's military career were certainly familiar ones; other deponents in the Scrope case also referred to their experiences on crusade.<br>
<br>The last years of Sabraham's life are no better documented than the first. From his marriage to Alice he had a daughter, also Alice, who by 1387 had married Walter Lewyn of Newcastle, grandson of the great military architect John Lewyn of Durham. Alice Sabraham died on 24 November 1398, and her inquisition post mortem in the following year referred to her husband in terms suggesting that he was then still alive and living in Northumberland. It is not known when or where he died.<br>
