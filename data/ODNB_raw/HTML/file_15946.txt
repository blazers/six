<span class="headword">Lambton,  John</span>  (1710&#150;1794), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, born on 26 July 1710, was the fourth and youngest son of Ralph Lambton (<i>d</i>. 1717), landowner, and his wife, whom he married in 1696, Dorothy, daughter of John Hedworth of Harraton, Durham. His elder brothers were Henry Lambton (1697&#150;1761) and Major-General Hedworth Lambton (<i>d</i>. 1758), who was an officer in the Coldstream Guards from 1723 to 1753 and in 1755 raised the 52nd (originally 54th) foot at Coventry. Educated at Westminster School, John was appointed ensign in the Coldstream Guards on 12 October 1732, became lieutenant in 1739, was regimental quartermaster from February 1742 to January 1745, and became captain and lieutenant-colonel on 24 January 1746. On 28 April 1758 he was appointed colonel of the 68th foot (later 1st Durham light infantry), then made a separate regiment. It had been raised two years previously as a second battalion of the 23rd Royal Welch Fusiliers, but had been chiefly recruited in Durham, a local connection subsequently maintained. During the Seven Years' War Lambton commanded the regiment in the unsuccessful attack on St Malo, Brittany, in September 1758. When county titles were bestowed on line regiments in 1782, it was styled the &#145;Durham&#146; regiment. Lambton, who became a full general, retained the colonelcy until his death. He succeeded to the Lambton estates after the deaths of his elder brothers. In the second half of the eighteenth century the freeman franchise Durham city was represented in parliament by members of the Lambton and Tempest families. Following the death on 26 June 1761 of his brother Henry, MP for Durham city since 1734, Lambton stood. He was opposed by Ralph Gowland, the candidate of Henry Vane, first earl of Darlington, and his party, who by creating new honorary freemen, mostly unconnected with the city, gained a majority. However, on petition Lambton, who asserted the rights of the historic resident freemen, was seated in May 1762. An independent, he voted sometimes for and sometimes against the government, and there is no record of his speaking in the house. He represented the city in five succeeding parliaments until his acceptance of the Chiltern Hundreds in February 1787, and was said to be popular with the citizens for the stand he made for their rights and privileges. Reportedly in 1793 he refused a peerage. Lambton married on 5 September 1763 Lady Susan Lyon (<i>d</i>. 1769), daughter of Thomas, eighth earl of Strathmore, and they had two sons and two daughters. He died on 22 March 1794. His elder son, William Henry Lambton (1764&#150;1797), MP for Durham city (1787&#150;97), was father of &#145;Radical Jack&#146;, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15947/', "John George Lambton, first earl of Durham (1792&#150;1840)")</script>.<br>
