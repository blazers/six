<span class="headword">Sharpe,  Samuel</span>  (1799&#150;1881), <span class="occ">Egyptologist and biblical scholar</span>, second of the six children of Sutton Sharpe (1756&#150;1806), brewer of King Street and of 10 Nottingham Place, Marylebone, Middlesex, and his second wife, Maria (<i>d</i>. 1806), third daughter of Thomas Rogers, banker, was born in King Street, Golden Square, London, on 8 March 1799, and baptized at St James's, Piccadilly, on 13 April. His mother, a descendant of Philip Henry, was sister of Samuel Rogers the poet; <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25227/', "Daniel Sharpe")</script> was Samuel's younger brother. After the death of his mother and then his father's bankruptcy and death, Samuel was cared for by his half-sister Catherine; the family moved to Paradise Row, Stoke Newington. In summer 1807, Samuel became a boarder in the school of Eliezer Cogan at Higham Hill, Walthamstow. At Christmas 1814 he was taken into the banking house of his uncles, Samuel and Henry Rogers, at 29 Clement's Lane, Lombard Street, and remained connected with the firm until 1861, having been made partner in 1824. Methodical, punctual, and cautious, Sharpe proved a successful businessman. In 1821 the Sharpe family moved to 12 New Ormond Street, as his brothers needed to reside closer to their places of business.<br>
<br>Brought up in the Church of England, Sharpe came gradually to adopt the unitarian views held by his mother's family, after extensive reading, notably of the <span class="roman">New Testament</span> in Greek, and personal reflection; in 1821 he joined the congregation of William Johnson Fox at South Place, Finsbury. For many years Sharpe and his brothers taught classes, before office hours, in the Lancasterian School in Harp Alley, Farringdon Street. Sharpe was elected a fellow of the Geological Society on 1 June 1827 but took a greater interest in mathematics and archaeological research, as shown by contributions between 1828 and 1831 to the <span class="italic">Philosophical Magazine</span>. He married at Tottenham, on 30 July 1827, his cousin Sarah (1796&#150;1851), daughter of Joseph Sharpe; they had six children, of whom two daughters survived him. The younger of their surviving daughters was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/51750/', "Matilda Sharpe")</script>. The couple settled in 4 Canonbury Place, Islington and stayed there until 1840, when they moved to nearby 32 Highbury Place.<br>
<br>Sharpe's interest in Egyptology was aroused by the research of Thomas Young (1773&#150;1829). He read the works of J. F. Champollion and John Gardner Wilkinson, learned Coptic, and formed a hieroglyphic vocabulary. Before publishing his first book, <span class="italic">The Early History of Egypt</span> (1836), he consulted his uncle, Samuel Rogers, who said, &#145;Why, surely you can do it if Wilkinson can; his only thought is where to buy his kid gloves&#146;  (Clayden, 65). The first part of his <span class="italic">Egyptian Inscriptions</span>, published in the spring of 1837, contained the largest collection of hieroglyphical writing yet published, and it was followed by a second part in 1841 and a second series in 1855. His <span class="italic">Rudiments of a Vocabulary of Egyptian Hieroglyphics</span> was published in the autumn of 1837; in the introduction he stated his general method of investigation, which involved deducing the meaning of a word from its context in a phrase including other known ciphers. He allowed that the results were often tentative. Sharpe had a natural gift for decipherment, often amusing his friends by the facility with which he would read off a difficult cryptogram. In the autumn of 1838 his <span class="italic">History of Egypt under the Ptolemies</span> appeared and in 1842 his <span class="italic">History of Egypt under the Romans</span>; these two works were incorporated with the <span class="italic">Early History</span> in <span class="italic">The History of Egypt</span> (1846). Sharpe collaborated with Joseph Bonomi, a personal friend, in several publications and articles, notably <span class="italic">The Chronology and Geography of Ancient Egypt</span> (1849), <span class="italic">The Triple Mummy Case of Aro Eri-Ao</span> (1858), <span class="italic">Egypt, Nubia, and Ethiopia</span> (1862), and <span class="italic">The Alabaster Sarcophagus of Oimenepthah I</span> (1864). He was also involved with Bonomi and Owen Jones in the preparation of the Egyptian courts in the Crystal Palace exhibitions of 1854. He dated the monuments, composed the hieroglyphic inscriptions to Queen Victoria, and contributed to the publication <span class="italic">Description of the Egyptian Courts in the Crystal Palace</span> (1854).<br>
<br>Sharpe was on friendly terms with Samuel Birch of the British Museum, but he was annoyed when the institution's trustees refused to buy the fine statue of Prince Khaemwese, son of Rameses II, in 1866. He himself purchased the statue for about &pound;500 and presented it to the museum. His later Egyptological publications included <span class="italic">Egyptian Hieroglyphics</span> (1861), <span class="italic">Egyptian Antiquities in the British Museum</span> (1862), <span class="italic">Egyptian Mythology and Egyptian Christianity</span> (1863), <span class="italic">The Decree of Canopus</span> (1870), and <span class="italic">The Rosetta Stone</span> (1871). The pains and skill of his workmanship were unquestioned; but he worked very independently, and on many points his conclusions were not accepted by contemporary scholars of Egyptology. He said of himself, &#145;I am a heretic in everything, even among Unitarians&#146;  (Clayden, 72). His research has since been superseded by later scholarship. Sharpe's contribution to Egyptology lay in his publications of accurate copies of hieroglyphic inscriptions which made these widely available to scholars and which still remain a useful reference source. Together with Wilkinson he was instrumental in exciting interest in Egyptology among the general public through popular works.<br>
<br>Sharpe's work as a translator of the <span class="roman">Bible</span> began with <span class="italic">The New Testament Translated</span> (1840), a revision of the Authorized Version of the <span class="roman">New Testament</span>. His Greek text was that of the German <span class="roman">New Testament</span> scholar J. J. Griesbach, and to this he always adhered, taking little interest in the progress of purely textual studies. His revision of the Authorized Version of the <span class="roman">Old Testament</span>, <span class="italic">The Hebrew Scriptures, Translated</span>, was first issued in 1865. In eight editions of his <span class="roman">New Testament</span>, and four of his old, he devoted great care to the improvement of his work. As a translator he was unoriginal but showed sound judgement; he was successful beyond others of his time in the difficult experiment of removing the archaisms without destroying the stylistic beauty of the English <span class="roman">Bible</span>. Among the last advocates of unpointed Hebrew, he published manuals for instruction in this system, notably <span class="italic">A Short Hebrew Grammar without Points</span> in 1877; his plan of printing his Hebrew extracts with capital letters, for the proper names and the beginnings of sentences, was unique. Apart from several exegetical works, he published <span class="italic">History of the Hebrew Nation and its Literature</span> (1869), and, combining his interest in archaeology and biblical studies, <span class="italic">Texts from the Bible Explained by &hellip; Ancient Monuments</span> (1866), <span class="italic">Hebrew Inscriptions from the Valleys between Egypt and Mount Sinai</span> (1875), and <span class="italic">An Inquiry into the Age of the Moabite Stone</span> (1879). As with his Egyptian works, he proved a popularizer of biblical studies, linking archaeology and the <span class="roman">Bible</span> within the limits of the scholarship of his day. When, in 1870, the project of a revised version of the <span class="roman">New Testament</span> was undertaken by the convocation of Canterbury, Sharpe was one of four scholars of his denomination invited to select a member of their body to co-operate with the New Testament Revision Company.<br>
<br>In purely theological controversies Sharpe took little part, though he was a zealous propagandist for religious and educational causes of which he approved. His various benefactions to University College School and to University College, in London, exceeded &pound;15,000, and he was a great benefactor of the Unitarian church. He wrote constantly for some years for the unitarian paper <span class="italic">The Inquirer</span>, founded in 1842 by Edward Hill, though he thought newspaper writing &#145;a bad employment&#146;  (Clayden, 112). He resumed it, however, in 1876, when the <span class="italic">Christian Life</span> was started by his friend Robert Spears, and wrote a weekly article until his death. He had contributed papers, chiefly biblical, to the <span class="italic">Christian Reformer</span>, between 1834 and 1863, and to many minor periodicals. He also wrote a memoir of his uncle, <span class="italic">Some Particulars of the Life of Samuel Rogers</span> (1859). He was a trustee of Dr Daniel Williams's foundations between 1853 and 1857; a member of the committee of management of University College, London, from 1866; president of the British and Foreign Unitarian Association in 1869&#150;70; and president of Manchester College (later at Oxford) in 1876&#150;8.<br>
<br>Sharpe spent his later years in retirement, though his house was still the resort of literary friends and young disciples. He suffered from progressive paralysis from April 1881, probably caused by a series of small strokes. He died at 32 Highbury Place, London, on 28 July 1881, and was buried at Abney Park cemetery on 3 August.<br>
