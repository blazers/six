<span class="headword">Burch,  Cecil Reginald <span class="st"> [Bill]</span></span>  (1901&#150;1983), <span class="occ">physicist and engineer</span>, was born at 2 Museum Road, Oxford, on 12 May 1901, the fifth child of George James Burch (1852&#150;1914) and his wife, Constance Emily Jeffries, otherwise Baker. Soon after birth Burch was nicknamed Bill by his family and friends. His father was professor of physics at Reading University from 1892 to 1909 and was elected FRS in 1900. His mother founded and ran Norham Hall as a women's residence for language students from overseas. Burch attended the Dragon School, Oxford from 1908 to 1915; in 1981 he wrote of the debt he owed to the school for teaching him the valuable art of public speaking and for persuading Oundle School to admit him without fee. Burch's family was suffering considerable financial hardship at that time due to the closure of Norham Hall caused by the travel restrictions brought about by the First World War. At Oundle (1915&#150;19), in addition to the classics, he was taught manual skills and encouraged to carry out experiments such as the distillation of coal tar. In his 1943 article &#145;A technologist looks at the future&#146; Burch described how these skills not only helped him in his later work but also allowed him to develop good personal relationships with many technicians and workmen.<br>
<br>In 1919 Burch and his brother Francis entered Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, with a scholarship; both took the natural sciences tripos, graduating in 1922, and both joined the Metropolitan-Vickers Co. Ltd in Manchester as college apprentices. This was a very creative phase of Burch's life. In the eleven years that he worked for Metropolitan-Vickers Burch's name appears on twenty-eight patents. Initially he worked with complex electric circuits and was involved in early transatlantic radio transmissions with the BBC. Later, with his colleague N. R. Davis, he developed the technique of induction heating in order to avoid the contamination problems caused by other methods of melting metals. Burch and Davis went on to design large induction furnaces for commercial steel making. This work led Burch to write his only book, <span class="italic">An Introduction to the Theory of Eddy-Current Heating</span> (1928).<br>
<br>In 1927 Burch began to experiment with vacuum distillation, the work for which he is, perhaps, best known. He developed oils and greases with very low vapour pressures (apiezon oils). Using these oils Burch designed oil condensation pumps which were widely used to create vacuums in, for example, large thermionic valves. One of the most famous applications of Burch's research in this area was by J. Cockcroft and E. T. S. Walton who used Burch's high vacuum tubes for part of their work on high voltage proton acceleration at the Cavendish Laboratory, Cambridge, in 1932. Burch also found that vacuum distillation could be used on other organic compounds such as vitamin A which had previously been extremely difficult to distil.<br>
<br>In February 1933 Burch's brother Francis, with whom he lived and worked, died very painfully following blood transfusions given during an operation for peritonitis. Francis's death greatly affected Burch, and he felt unable to continue at Metropolitan-Vickers as every day was a constant reminder of his brother. He left Manchester to go to the physics department at Imperial College, London, in September 1933 as Leverhulme fellow in optics, but remained a paid consultant to Metropolitan-Vickers. At Imperial College Burch entered the second phase of his career. He began studying the optics of non-spherical surfaces and quickly developed a new way of testing mirrors called the wavefront shearing interferometer. He gained his PhD in 1936. In 1936 he went to Bristol as a research associate to continue his optical work. Soon after his arrival Burch met Enid Grace Morice (1899/1900&#150;<i>c</i>.1980), the daughter of Owen Henry Morice; she was also a lecturer. They married on 5 April 1937; they had one daughter, Ann Lindsay. In Bristol Burch built the first Schwarzschild aplanatic aspheric reflecting microscope. He spent many hours, usually at night when vibration was at a minimum, polishing mirrors by hand.<br>
<br>During the Second World War Burch worked with the Ministry of Aircraft Production to enhance the lenses used for aerial photography. He also spent time working at Metropolitan-Vickers on war-related projects and mirrors for his microscopes. During the war years he patented two lens improvements and a machine to grind mirror surfaces. After the war Burch continued to work in Bristol on microscopes which he exhibited at the Physical Society exhibition in January 1947. As a result he was inundated with requests from research workers for him to make similar microscopes. Much against his better judgement Burch found himself taking on the responsibility of a production run of ten microscopes as well as supervising PhD students in Bristol. As a result of stress caused by his inability to turn down the job, and the drugs he took to keep himself awake, Burch suffered a perforated ulcer which required surgery in 1953.<br>
<br>While recuperating in Cornwall, Burch became interested in mineral dressing by gravity concentration and invented a mineral classifier to improve tin recovery from mines. During the last years of his career Burch worked on a wide variety of projects including stethoscopes, brazing torches, and mathematical analysis. During his long career he published fifty-six papers and one book, and was granted forty patents. He retired officially from Bristol in 1966 but retained his room in college and continued to work for the rest of his life. Burch was awarded the Physical Society's Duddell medal in 1943, was elected fellow of the Royal Society in 1944, was awarded the society's Rumford medal for achievement in 1954, and was made CBE in 1958.<br>
<br>Burch was tall and very slender. He was a loner who spent long, irregular hours on his work which sometimes affected his health. He died at his home, 2 Holmes Grove, Henleaze, Bristol, on 19 July 1983.<br>
