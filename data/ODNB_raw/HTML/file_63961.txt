<span class="headword">Braddell <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Busse]</span>,  Dorothy Adelaide</span>  (1889&#150;1981), <span class="occ">designer and decorative artist</span>, was born at 129 Inverness Terrace, Paddington, London, on 30 June 1889, the daughter of Jacob Levine Busse, stockbroker, and his wife, Annie Leonie Stiebel. After attending Miss Manville's school and King's College, London, she studied art at Regent School Polytechnic and at the Byam Shaw School of Art, and won a national gold medal for decorative design. On 12 September 1914, in Paddington, she married the architect Darcy Braddell (1884&#150;1970), with whom she had a son and a daughter. For much of her early career she worked in advertising and display with a client list that included leading national companies such as Shell-Mex Ltd, Viyella, and Allied Ironfounders. However, her lasting reputation lay in her work in domestic interior and kitchen design, much of which was seen in prestigious exhibitions ranging from &#145;British Art in Industry&#146;, at the Royal Academy (1935), to &#145;Britain Can Make It&#146;, at the Victoria and Albert Museum, London (1946). Her work also featured frequently at the <span class="italic">Daily Mail</span> Ideal Home exhibitions, for which she often contributed articles on domestic planning to the accompanying publications.<br>
<br>An important client for many years after the end of the First World War was Shell-Mex Ltd, for whom Braddell produced advertisements as well as many vivid watercolours of English towns and villages that were used for a variety of publicity materials. In line with the newly founded Campaign for the Preservation of Rural England, Shell-Mex Ltd had become increasingly committed to promoting environmentally sensitive advertising and signage. These included what Braddell described as &#145;inn signboard&#146; advertising&#151;painted pictorial boards hanging from posts. Although often connected to individual petrol stations they also featured the roads on which they were positioned through the use of illustrative vignettes. For example the Pioneer filling station at Kingston Hill, on the London to Portsmouth road, featured St Paul's Cathedral, the Hog's Back, and a sailing galleon. Braddell also produced an innovative set of large-scale pictorial designs to detract from the ugliness of many railway bridges spanning roads. Although advertising Shell they also featured distances from towns co-ordinated with colourful images of sightseeing attractions in the region. Her work for Shell also encompassed a variety of exhibition stands, including that at the 1932 Motor Show, where she adopted a markedly art deco style with recessed lighting, modernist chromium-plated steel furniture, and zebra-skin-like furnishing fabrics. Many art deco features were also incorporated into her Viyella stand for William Hollins &amp; Co. at the Ideal Home Exhibition of the same year, especially in the decorative metal-and-glass lighting strip at cornice level. Her dexterity enabled her to move through a variety of styles, depending on the context and the aspirations of her clients. For example when designing the Crosse and Blackwell stand at the Nation's Food Exhibition at Olympia in 1925 she looked back to the period when the company was founded by drawing on the architecture of London baroque churches for the pavilion, with attendants dressed in period costume.<br>
<br>Between the 1930s and 1950s Braddell devoted a considerable amount of energy to rational interior design and domestic planning, very much in tune with the aims of the campaigning Electrical Association for Women and contemporary thinking on scientific management in the home. Alongside other socially committed British women pioneers of domestic design and planning in the 1930s&#151;such as Caroline Haslett, Anne Shaw, Edna Moseley, and Elizabeth Denby&#151;Braddell has been undervalued in accounts of British inter-war design. Though socially and professionally well connected the fact that their work was largely centred on the home, itself seen as an essentially feminine domain, has resulted in a comparative lack of recognition. Their contemporary male counterparts, whose masculine values dominated significant committees such as that of the Council for Art and Industry, established by the Board of Trade late in 1933, suffered no such adverse compartmentalization.<br>
<br>While undertaking many commissions for private clients Braddell also worked for a number of commercial companies, often acting&#151;unusually for a woman at that time&#151;in a consultancy capacity. Much of her domestic planning design was seen in exhibitions at home and abroad, and mainly featured domestic room settings, especially kitchens. These included the &#145;British Art in Industry&#146; exhibition (1935), the Empire Exhibition (Glasgow, 1938), the &#145;Britain Can Make It&#146; exhibition (1946), and the annual Ideal Home exhibitions, which were always held in central London. She was also involved in design for a much younger audience&#151;for instance in that for the self-contained and innovatory Children's Exhibition at the 1937 Ideal Home Exhibition, which occupied a prominent area and was geared to attracting the interest of children. Clothes, furniture, games and toys, books, and food were &#145;presented in such a way as to delight children &hellip; yet with a view of guiding their tastes in the right direction&#146;  (publicity pamphlet 1937, V&amp;A, archive of art and design cuttings files). The brightly coloured display featured Alice in Wonderland, Peter Pan, and other children's favourites radiating around the central feature of &#145;Piccaninny Circus&#146;, topped by the <span class="italic">Daily Mail</span> cupid.<br>
<br>For many years Braddell showed many kitchens in a variety of styles at the ever popular Ideal Home exhibitions. For example at the 1933 exhibition she showed a &#145;commonsense kitchen&#146;, a &#145;gas kitchen&#146;, a &#145;basement kitchen&#146; (which also served as a sitting room for two maids), a &#145;kitchen&#150;living-room&#146; for a small country house, and a &#145;luxury kitchen&#146; (with a central chromium steel and armour-plated glass working table and modern tubular-steel furniture). Highlighting her approach she wrote: &#145;I think it can be truly said that good planning is the first essential of labour-saving&#146;  (Braddell, typescript, V&amp;A, AAD/1980/2). Much of her work featured Aga cookers (manufactured in England by Allied Ironfounders) incorporated into modern, labour-saving settings with integrated work surfaces and built-in cupboards. She also worked closely with manufacturers on appliance design itself, most notably with the Parkinson Stove Company. Her room settings also featured in a number of significant international exhibitions, most importantly in the British pavilion at the Paris Exhibition of 1937, where all the designs shown were selected by the Council for Art and Industry. Her combined kitchen, scullery, pantry, and maid's sitting room for a small country house was designed to be run either by the owner or the maid. Built-in units and integrated worktops, together with Bakelite telephone and radio, conveyed a modern vision of the kitchen where functional, social, and leisure spaces were seen as one. After the Second World War she continued to look forward to better standards of design and planning in the domestic environment, as displayed at the &#145;Britain Can Make It&#146; exhibition of 1946, mounted by the recently formed Council of Industrial Design.<br>
<br>Dorothy Braddell continued to be busy into the 1960s, as her daybooks testify. She died at Quinton House, Lower Quinton, Warwickshire, on 27 April 1981. Examples of her drawings and prints are held in the Victoria and Albert Museum, London.<br>
