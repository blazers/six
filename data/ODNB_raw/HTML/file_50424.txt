<span class="headword">Beckford,  Peter</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1643, <em>d.</em> 1710), <span class="occ">planter in Jamaica and politician</span>, was baptized on 19 November 1643 at St James, Clerkenwell, Middlesex, the son of Peter Beckford, &#145;a shadowy and humble figure&#146; whose dates of birth and death are unknown  (Alexander, 29), and his wife Phillis. He was a descendant of the Beckfords of the parish of Beckford in Gloucestershire, one of the oldest families in England.<br>
<br>Samuel Pepys recorded in his diary on 5 January 1661 that Thomas Fuller, the English divine and historian, had come to his home to desire a kindness for a friend of his. The friend was Beckford, who &#145;hath a mind to go to Jamaica with these two ships that are going, which I promised to do&#146;  (<span class="italic">Diary</span>, 2.6). Few records of Beckford's early years in Jamaica have survived. One contemporary historian, who described him as being very active, honest, and sober, said he was bred a seaman, then became a merchant, and, having some knowledge of gunnery, was appointed captain of the forts at Port Royal. In 1675 he was described as a merchant at Port Royal, and six years later was the owner of land, a dwelling house, a storehouse, and a wharf in that town. Port Royal was a place of clamorous, murderous, drunken, brutal men, and reputedly the wickedest city in the West Indies in the lifetimes of Beckford and the buccaneer Sir Henry Morgan. Frank Cundall wrote that Beckford &#145;was at the capture of St Jago de Cuba&#146;, and suggests that he was present at &#145;the taking of Panama&#146; by Morgan and his buccaneers in 1671  (Cundall, 1937, 13).<br>
<br>Beckford was elected to the house of assembly of Jamaica from the parish of St Catherine in 1675; in later years he represented the parishes of Clarendon, St Dorothy, and St John. In 1691 he was elevated to the island's council and later became its president. He was an active member of the militia, moving up from captain to colonel; in 1683 he was made commander of the forts at Port Royal. Moreover, he was receiver-general of Jamaica in 1691, and in the following year became commander and <i>custos</i> of Port Royal. After the earthquake of 1692 destroyed the greater part of Port Royal, he became the first <i>custos</i> or principal justice of the peace of the port town of Kingston.<br>
<br>On the death of the governor, Major-General William Selwyn, Beckford was elevated to the post of lieutenant-governor of Jamaica on 5 April 1702 and authorized to act by the same powers and instructions as did the late governor. In his inaugural speech to the assembly he said, &#145;I have gone through most of the offices of the island, though with no great applause, yet without complaint&#146;. He promised to protect the liberties of the white citizens, observing that he had &#145;some small interest in this island, which, had I no other consideration, would induce me as far as it lies in my power, to support each particular in its just right&#146;  (<span class="italic">Journals of the Assembly of Jamaica</span>, 1.236). Beckford's short tenure of eight months came in the early part of the War of the Spanish Succession, leading him to urge the strengthening of the military posture of the island against the Spanish and French enemies.<br>
<br>The goal of merchants, government officials, and professional and military men who went from England to Jamaica and other Caribbean islands without capital was to use their surplus income to acquire land, indentured servants, African slaves, and milling equipment to establish sugar plantations and other income-producing properties. Beckford was pre-eminent among the Jamaicans who competed fiercely for wealth and power. By 1670 he had acquired 2238 acres in Clarendon parish, and he added to his holdings during his lifetime, notably several large properties he purchased from the London alderman Richard Beckford. Besides the large tracts of land he acquired by patent and deed, he purchased nearly a hundred small properties which were consolidated into sugar plantations of several hundred acres, each equipped with mills, boiling and curing houses, and rum distilleries, and manned by a labour force of upwards of a hundred African slaves. At his death in 1710 he was reputed to have owned twenty estates, 1200 slaves, and &pound;1,500,000 in bank stock. Cundall claimed that Beckford possessed the largest property, real and personal, of any subject in Europe and the overseas colonies.<br>
<br>Beckford's first wife was Bridget (<i>d</i>. 1671), the daughter of Sir William Beeston, a planter and governor of Jamaica from 1692 to 1702. His second wife, Anne, was a relative of Colonel Thomas Ballard, a leading planter. She had three sons, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/50423/', "Peter Beckford (1672/3&#150;1735)")</script>, who became speaker of the assembly, Charles, who died in infancy, and Thomas, who was killed in 1731 by a man he had offended; and two daughters, Priscilla (<i>b</i>. 1675) and Elizabeth (<i>b</i>. 1678).<br>
<br>The circumstances of Beckford's death illustrate the quarrelling and violence of the planter &eacute;lite. It occurred on 3 April 1710 at Government House in Spanish Town. The discussion in the assembly chamber waxed so furious that Speaker Peter Beckford the younger sought in vain to adjourn the house. Some of the members barred the door, while others drew their swords and forced the speaker to reoccupy the chair. Peter Beckford senior, who was in the council chamber, heard his son's cry for help and ran with the guards to batter down the door to rescue him. In the excitement the elder Beckford either fell accidentally or suffered a stroke and died suddenly. Boyd Alexander, the biographer and historian of the Beckford family, claims that the elder Beckford himself was &#145;ruthless, unscrupulous and violent&#146;, and that the Beckfords were men of violent temper that led them even to murder  (Alexander, 30&#150;31). In the cathedral at Spanish Town, where he was buried, is a white marble slab in his memory, inscribed:<blockquote>Here lyes Interr'd the body of the Honble. Coll. Peter Beckford, late Presidt. of the Councill, sometime Lieut. Govr. and Commander in Chief of this Island, who departed this life the 3rd Apr. 1710 in the 67th year of his age. (Cundall, 1937, 25)</blockquote>In his will of 7 September 1705, Beckford bequeathed &pound;100 to the poor of St Catherine's parish, &pound;500 to his son Thomas, &pound;250 to each of Thomas's two daughters, and &pound;100 to his friend Thomas Nicholls. Furthermore, he set free his slaves Francis and Phillip, and devised to each an annuity of &pound;10 annually. All of the remainder of his estate in Jamaica and England he bequeathed to his son Peter and his heirs. On the basis of the fortune acquired by Peter Beckford, the family was distinguished by <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1903/', "William Beckford (bap. 1709, d. 1770)")</script>, a grandson who became lord mayor of London and member of parliament, three brothers of the lord mayor who were members of parliament, and the lord mayor's son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1905/', "William Thomas Beckford (1760&#150;1844)")</script>, a later Romantic author and prominent art collector.<br>
