<span class="headword">Grey, Sir  Frederick William</span>  (1805&#150;1878), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, third son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/11526/', "Charles Grey, second Earl Grey (1764&#150;1845)")</script>, and his wife, Mary Elizabeth, daughter of William Brabazon Ponsonby, first Lord Ponsonby, was born at Howick, Northumberland, on 23 August 1805. He entered the navy on 18 January 1819, serving as a midshipman aboard the frigate <i>Naiad</i> (Captain Robert C. Spencer) in the Mediterranean. He took part in a notable boat action against Algerine pirates at Bon in 1824. On passing for lieutenant in April 1824 he joined the <i>Sybille</i> (Captain Sir Samuel J. B. Pechell) and returned to Britain in August. In 1825 he joined the <i>Volage</i> (Captain Richard S. Dundas) for the South American station, where he obtained command of the <i>Heron</i> (18 guns) on 17 April 1827. He was promoted captain on 19 April 1828. Between 1830 and 1834 Grey commanded the frigate <i>Actaeon</i> (26 guns) on the Mediterranean station. In August 1835 he was appointed to the <i>Jupiter</i> to convey William Eden, Lord Auckland, to India as governor-general, and he returned to Britain in 1836. In 1840 he was appointed to the frigate <i>Endymion</i> and sent to the East Indies, where he served in the First Opium War and was created CB in January 1842 for his services. The ship paid off in late 1843. On 20 July 1846 he married Barbarina Charlotte, daughter of the Revd F. Sullivan; they had no children, and she survived him.<br>
<br>In 1854 Grey was appointed to command the screw steamship <i>Hannibal</i> (90 guns). In August he became a first-class commodore commanding a mixed fleet of warships armed <i>en flute</i> and steam transports conveying 10,000 French troops to the &Aring;land Islands. After the fall of Bomarsund, Grey's squadron returned to Britain, and he then took the <i>Hannibal</i> to the Black Sea, where he was ordered to become captain of the fleet for Vice-Admiral Sir Edmund Lyons. However, Lyons preferred to rely on his flag captain, and Grey was redeployed as principal agent of transports in the Bosphorus, a post which he filled with energy and good sense until the removal of the army from the Crimea. Grey became a rear-admiral on 22 January 1855. His brother-in-law, Sir Charles Wood, became first lord in February. For his services during the war Grey was created KCB in 1857.<br>
<br>After a brief period ashore Grey was appointed commander-in-chief at the Cape of Good Hope and on the west coast of Africa in April 1857, and he remained there until February 1860. On his return to Britain he published a pamphlet, <span class="italic">On the Organisation of the Navy</span> (1860), largely concerned with manning. In June 1861 he took office as first sea lord under the duke of Somerset, following the sudden death of his former captain and close friend Richard Saunders Dundas. Promoted vice-admiral in August 1861 and admiral in April 1865, he retained his post, which was his last naval service, until the fall of Earl Russell's ministry in 1866. He received the GCB in 1865.<br>
<br>As first sea lord Grey called for increased estimates, to provide ships and men to place the fleet on equal terms with foreign powers, and for improved administration. He was largely content to follow the work of his predecessor and to sustain the ironclad policy that by the mid-1860s reasserted British naval mastery with superior ships, guns, and resources. He was not an alarmist but supported the maintenance of a two-power naval standard. On the question of ship design, Grey was conservative. He did not favour the experimental turret ship designs of Captain Cowper Coles, and considered Coles's publicity campaign impudent. His main concern was manpower, as he declared in the preface to his short pamphlet on manning, <span class="italic">Suggestions for improving the character of our merchant seamen and for providing an efficient naval reserve</span> (1873):<blockquote>During the five years I held the office of Senior Naval Lord under the Duke of Somerset, the questions of manning the Navy, raising the character of our seamen, making the Coast Guard a really efficient reserve, and providing a further reserve in the merchant service occupied much of the attention of the Board of Admiralty. Many important measures were adopted which, followed up by succeeding administrations, have given us the finest body of seamen, ever, I believe, in the service of the Crown. (F. W. Grey, <span class="italic">Suggestions</span>, 1873; repr. in Bromley)</blockquote>Grey did not take a seat in the House of Commons, which meant that he was a less public figure than the sea lords who preceded him. This was an important step in the professionalization of the board. It was a mark of the growing controversy over naval policy, under attack from radical economists and the projectors of alternative designs, that on leaving office Grey published a pamphlet, <span class="italic">Admiralty Administration, 1861&#150;1866</span> (1866), in defence of the Liberal naval policy of his term. He was placed on the retired list by Childers' reform of 1870. In later life he served as a magistrate for Northumberland, Berkshire, and Sussex. Grey died on 2 May 1878 at his home, Lynwood, Sunningdale, Berkshire.<br>
<br>With powerful family connections at the highest level of society, and within the navy, Grey had a head start to his career. His later service coincided with whig&#150;Liberal administrations, including his father's term as prime minister, and those of his brother-in-law Sir Charles Wood as secretary and later first lord of the Admiralty. However, Grey was among the most able flag officers of his generation, respected for his administrative abilities and sound judgement. His term at the Admiralty was marked by the increasing community of interest among naval officers of all political persuasions, in spite of their differences in other areas.<br>
