<span class="headword">Davisson <span class="st"> [D'Avissone]</span>,  William</span>  (<em>c.</em>1593&#150;1669), <span class="occ">chemist and physician</span>, was born in Aberdeen, the youngest of the three sons of Duncan Davissone of Ardmakrone (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1600) and Jonet Forbes. Shortly after the death of his father, his mother's holdings were seized by relatives, and after her early death suits for restitution continued for many years. In connection with these proceedings, Davisson obtained a patent of nobility from Charles I in 1629. Davisson entered Marischal College in 1614, obtained an MA in 1617, and, owing to his family's difficulties, declared it better &#145;to live industriously and honestly among foreigners, than to live in poverty and degradation amongst my own countrymen and illustrious relatives&#146;  (<span class="italic">Prodromus</span>, 1660, 407), and emigrated to France. There he married a fellow Scot, Charlotte de Thynny (Th&eacute;gny), with whom he had one child, Charles.<br>
<br>During his first years in France, Davisson may have become qualified as a doctor of medicine at Montpellier. He was befriended by Jean Bapiste Morin, succeeding him as physician to Bishop Claude Dormy, a devotee of chemistry with a laboratory at Beauchamps, near Bourbon-Lancy. After the bishop's death in 1626, Davisson began lecturing on chemistry at Paris, and published his most important work, <span class="italic">Philosophia pyrotechnica</span> (1633&#150;5), a wide-ranging textbook on chemistry incorporating classical authors, sacred scripture, alchemical authorities, neoplatonic ideas, and experimental data, into a grand Paracelsian chemical system. (In all his publications he used the Gallicized form of his name, D'Avissone, and his descendants used this form exclusively.) He also wrote a curious work on salt, dedicated to Cardinal Richelieu, and entitled <span class="italic">Oblatio salis, sive, Gallia lege salis condita</span> (1641), which treated the properties of common salt alongside its metaphorical meanings and its (supposed) relation to Salic law. In 1644, through the patronage of Henrietta Maria and Fran&ccedil;ois Vautier, first physician to Louis XIII, Davisson became physician to the king, circumventing a recent parliamentary decree forbidding the Parisian practice of physicians who did not belong to the Paris faculty. In 1647, a chair of chemistry was created at the Jardin du Roi, which at Vautier's recommendation was offered to Davisson; this was the first chair of chemistry in France. Davisson became intendant of the Jardin du Roi in 1647, and began lecturing there on 23 July 1648.<br>
<br>In 1651 Davisson resigned his posts, possibly owing to the intrigues of Bouvard, whom he had displaced as intendant. It seems equally possible he resigned because of the controversy about his 1651 tract <span class="italic">Observations sur l'antimoine</span> which upheld the pharmaceutical use of antimony and sharply criticized physicians who rejected chemical medicine, thus siding with Paracelsian protestants of Montpellier against Galenist Catholics of Paris in their long-waged &#145;antimony wars&#146;. None the less, in the same year, helped by the Polish Queen Marie-Louise and his friend Morin, Davisson took up similar posts in Warsaw as first physician to King Jan Kazimierz and keeper of the royal garden. In 1663 he completed a lengthy commentary on <span class="italic">Idea medicinae philosophicae</span> of the Paracelsian physician Peter Severinus (he had published a prodromus in 1660 with Severinus's text). After Marie-Louise's death in 1667 Davisson left Poland, returning briefly to his native Aberdeen where he had a tract on scalp disease printed under the pseudonym Theophrastus Scotus; this work, entitled <span class="italic">Plicomastix</span> (1668), was sold in Danzig. In 1669 he returned to Paris, where Louis XIV ratified his patent of nobility, guaranteeing nobility to his descendants.<br>
<br>Davisson enjoyed a high reputation in courtly circles. Lord Scudamore, the English ambassador at Paris, wrote of Charles I's &#145;gracious favour&#146; towards Davisson, and noted that the king &#145;has been rightly informed concerning the worth of this man, and the benefit his Majesty's subjects receive by him&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1635&#150;6</i>, 321). His lectures in Paris were well attended; Evelyn visited on 21 October 1649, and Aubrey asserted that Hobbes &#145;went through a Course of Chymistrie with him&#146;  (Read, 77). Sir Thomas Urquhart wrote that Davisson's &#145;excellency &hellip; in alchemy is above all the men now living in the world&#146;  (Small, 265). Davisson died at Paris in 1669.<br>
