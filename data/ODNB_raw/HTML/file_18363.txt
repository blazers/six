<span class="headword">Mauger</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1212), <span class="occ">bishop of Worcester</span>, was of illegitimate birth, the son of a knight and a free woman, both unmarried. The date of his birth is unknown. From 1190 he was in royal service, witnessing charters of Richard I, at first as archdeacon of &Eacute;vreux, and then, from June 1195, as treasurer of Normandy. He always appears as &#145;Master Mauger&#146;, indicating higher education, perhaps at Paris. He was the king's doctor, and Roger of Hoveden says that Richard gave him the bishopric of Worcester. His election may have taken place after Richard's death (on 6 April 1199); it was certainly before 8 August 1199. On Mauger's admission of illegitimacy, the election was referred to the pope, and he himself went to Rome. Pope Innocent III quashed the election, but allowed the electors to postulate Mauger, and consecrated him on 4 June 1200. Cardinals who had known him in the schools testified to his learning, reputation, and virtuous life; the Worcester chronicler asserts that the pope was influenced by his distinguished appearance. Mauger was enthroned at Worcester on 12 November. Thereafter he devoted himself to ecclesiastical business, and is seldom recorded at court. His predecessor had been interested in the sanctity of Bishop Wulfstan of Worcester; Mauger took the matter up, collected evidence, and travelled to Rome for the purpose, &#145;not considering his age&#146;  (Darlington, 184). Wulfstan's canonization was announced on 21 April 1203. A second purpose of this, or yet another, visit to Rome, was to prosecute a claim to jurisdiction over Evesham Abbey. Mauger did not attend the later stages of the case. The pope gave sentence for Evesham on Christmas eve 1205, largely on the basis of forged papal documents. Mauger's chief opponent, Thomas of Marlborough, subsequently abbot of Evesham, writing his story later, recognized that the bishop was a &#145;just and Godfearing man&#146; and &#145;a son of truth&#146;  (Macray, 109, 119).<br>
<br>Mauger's last years were dominated by the dispute between King John and the pope over the election of an archbishop of Canterbury. After lengthy negotiations, Innocent consecrated Cardinal Stephen Langton on 17 June 1207. On 27 August he ordered the bishops of London, Ely, and Worcester to try to persuade the king to accept Langton, and if he refused, to declare an interdict throughout England. The bishops met the king several times in October, but without success. Mauger had already suffered temporary confiscation of property, probably for refusing to support opposition to Langton. Negotiations continued until 12 March 1208. The three bishops then ordered the interdict to take effect on 24 March. Their property was confiscated, and they were soon forced to take refuge abroad, &#145;enduring harsh exile&#146;  (<span class="italic">Ann. mon.</span>, 4.396). The bishops returned briefly in August for more discussions, but without result. Early in 1209, they received new papal orders: if the king did not submit, they were to announce his excommunication. The threat led to more negotiations. The bishops came to Dover in August, met royal envoys, and drafted peace terms. But problems remained, and the terms were never ratified. The bishops, who evidently feared for their own safety, returned to France, where the king's excommunication was published in November, at Arras. Matters had reached a deadlock. In the spring of 1211, the pope sent new envoys to England.<br>
<br>It was perhaps at about that time that Mauger retired to the abbey of Pontigny, where he died, in the Cistercian habit, on 1 July 1212. He may earlier have stayed at the Parisian abbey of St Victor, where he, Eustace, bishop of Ely (<i>d</i>. 1215), and other English clergy were commemorated. During his exile Mauger was sometimes in touch with his diocese, and was able to appoint his nephew to the archdeaconry of Worcester. The writings of Gerald of Wales preserve the only example of a personal letter from Mauger, written in connection with Gerald's attempt to raise the bishopric of St David's to an archbishopric.<br>
