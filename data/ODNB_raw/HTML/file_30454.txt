<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Arnold, Sir  (Robert) Arthur</span>  (1833&#150;1902), <span class="occ">radical and writer</span>, born on 28 May 1833 at Gravesend, Kent, was the third son of the three sons and three daughters of Robert Coles Arnold JP (<i>b</i>. 1797), of Whartons, Framfield, Sussex, and Sarah, daughter of Daniel Pizzey (or Pizzi) of Clement's Hall, Rochford, Essex. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30455/', "Sir Edwin Arnold")</script> was an elder brother. Owing to delicate health, Arnold was educated at home, and subsequently adopted the profession of surveyor and land agent. He was professionally engaged on proposals connected with the construction of the Thames Embankment; and in 1861 he issued a pamphlet, entitled <span class="italic">The Thames Embankment and the Wharf Holders</span>, in which he described the three schemes under consideration, including that of Joseph William Bazalgette. Cherishing literary ambitions, he produced in his leisure two sensational novels, <span class="italic">Ralph, or, St Sepulchre's and St Stephen's</span> (1861) and <span class="italic">Hever Court</span> (1867); the latter appeared as a serial in <span class="italic">Once a Week</span>.<br>
<br>In 1863, under the <span class="roman">Public Works (Manufacturing Districts) Act</span>, Arnold was appointed by Charles Pelham Villiers, then president of the poor-law board, assistant commissioner, and subsequently government inspector of public works. For three years he was engaged on the difficult task of supervising the employment of the destitute cotton operatives of Lancashire on the making of roads and other public works, and he contributed some striking articles on the subject to the <span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span>, then under the editorship of his brother Edwin. In 1864 he issued his popular <span class="italic">History of the Cotton Famine from the Fall of Sumter to the Passing of the Public Works Act</span>, which reappeared in a cheap edition the following year. On 17 June 1867 he married Amelia Elizabeth (1822&#150;1915), only daughter of Henry Barry Hyde (1785&#150;1831), captain of the 96th regiment, judge, and acting governor of Sierra Leone, of Castle Hyde, co. Cork, and Amelia, daughter of Major Robert Cole of Newport, Isle of Wight. They had no children. In 1867 they made a tour of the south and east of Europe, which first aroused Arnold's Hellenic sympathies. These, to which he remained constant throughout his life, were conspicuous in his descriptive letters, published as <span class="italic">From the Levant</span> in 1868. In 1873 the king of Greece conferred the golden cross of the order of the Saviour on Arnold, with special reference to this work.<br>
<br>In 1868 Arnold also became the first editor of <span class="italic">The Echo</span>, a new evening paper, and one of the earliest to be sold for &frac12;<i>d</i>. Under his control this achieved great success and established itself as a paper of independent Liberal principles, with a reputation for cultural content. Arnold's reputation was that of a journalistic trainer, who brought forward some key young talents of the day: William Black, later of the <span class="italic">Daily News</span>, Frances Power Cobbe, George Byrom Curtis (later editor of <span class="italic">The Standard</span>), and Sir John Macdonell, subsequently a leader writer for <span class="italic">The Times</span>. Arnold resigned the editorship in 1875, soon after the purchase of the paper by Albert Grant, known as Baron Grant, and immediately started on a journey through the East with his wife. They rode the whole length of Persia, a distance of more than 1000 miles, and his <span class="italic">Through Persia by Caravan</span> (1877), dedicated to Earl and Countess Granville, gave a lively account of his adventures.<br>
<br>Arnold's interests were divided between politics and journalism. A staunch radical, he studied with attention current social and agrarian problems, and contributed frequently to the leading reviews. Articles and pamphlets by him were collected into a volume, entitled <span class="italic">Social Politics</span> (1878), in which he advocated a radical programme of church disestablishment, land law reform, reform of metropolitan government, state ownership of the railways, public works during periods of distress, temperance reform, women's political enfranchisement, and reform of the married women's property laws.<br>
<br>Arnold's ambition to enter parliament was eventually gratified. After he had unsuccessfully contested the borough of Huntingdon in the Liberal interest in 1873 he declined the invitation of the Liberal committee in Northampton to stand in 1874. But in 1878 he accepted the invitation to stand for Salford, where he was elected on a radical platform in the Liberal landslide of 1880. He was an early supporter of home rule, one of only fifteen radical/Liberal MPs who came out in favour of an inquiry at the election; he thereby received strong support from Irish voters.<br>
<br>While acting with the radical wing of his party on questions of home politics, Arnold frequently criticized with vigour and independence the government's conduct of foreign affairs. In 1880 he became chairman of the Greek committee, in succession to Sir Charles Dilke, and he was active in urging the claims of the Hellenic kingdom to an extension of territory in accordance with the suggestion of the treaty of Berlin. He was also closely involved in the successful campaign to reform the married women's property laws. After joining the executive of the committee in the mid-1870s, he issued several pamphlets on the question and was one of the deputation to the lord chancellor, Lord Selborne, in January 1881, which secured government support for a full measure of reform. In the House of Commons, Arnold also made his mark as an effective speaker in debates on the franchise. On 21 March 1882 his proposal of a uniform franchise and a redistribution of seats was approved by the house  (<span class="italic">Hansard 3</span>, 267, 1443, 1532). In 1883 he moved for an elaborate return of electoral statistics, which influenced the <span class="roman">Reform Bill</span> of 1884.<br>
<br>During the 1880s Arnold also took up the question of land reform. In <span class="italic">Free Land</span>, published in 1880, he advocated the Cobdenite programme of removal of restrictions on the sale and transfer of land&#151;abolition of the laws of settlement and primogeniture coupled with compulsory registration of titles. This would, he argued, lead to wider land ownership and greater capital investment in agriculture. Arnold's views were also influenced by J. S. Mill and the Land Tenure Reform Association&#151;he argued in favour of heavier taxation of land and of the &#145;unearned increment&#146;. Denying the existence of a right of absolute private property in land on the grounds that it was an essential natural resource, he asserted the dormant &#145;joint interest&#146; of the state to intervene and regulate where necessary. But such views did not lead him to support land nationalization, which he regarded as too costly and impractical. Arnold was the driving force behind the creation of the Free Land League and was elected its president in 1885. His moderate policy of land reform came into competition with Joseph Chamberlain's &#145;radical programme&#146; which proposed land purchase by elected county councils to provide allotments and smallholdings for rural labourers. Arnold denied Chamberlain's argument that &#145;free land&#146; on its own would merely make land agglomeration by rich capitalists easier, and asserted that an open land market would allow every farm worker to save up and purchase &#145;three acres and a cow&#146;. In the 1890s he modified his views on the creation of a peasant proprietorship, and called for the extension of Irish land purchase schemes to the rest of the United Kingdom.<br>
<br>At the general election of 1885 Arnold was defeated in the newly formed division of North Salford. The small margin of the loss (176 votes) suggests that he may have been a victim of the Parnellite strategy of directing Irish voters to support tory candidates; although a long-standing supporter of home rule, Arnold had not been exempted from this directive. But he clouded his position with the publication in 1885 of <span class="italic">Home Rule</span>, in which he appeared to back away from the idea of granting Ireland the legislative powers of a self-governing colony, on the grounds that this would lead to separation. Instead he gave support to Imperial Federation and the creation of a true imperial parliament with several devolved parliaments for the constituent parts of the union. Arnold stood again for North Salford as a home-ruler in 1886 but was defeated, and again for North Dorset in 1892 with the same result. He did not re-enter the House of Commons.<br>
<br>Arnold now turned his energies to the problems of local government in the metropolis, the arena where his public career had begun. In the mid-1880s he was a supporter of the London Municipal Reform League. In 1889, on the formation of the London county council, he was elected an alderman for six years; he was re-elected in 1895 for three and again in 1898 for six years. On 12 March 1895 he was chosen chairman, and was re-elected on 10 March 1896; he thus enjoyed the unique distinction of holding the office for more than one year. As a leading council progressive, he was in full sympathy with the municipal programme carried through during the first ten years, a programme limited to improvements in streets, sewers, rivers, and open spaces. However, in 1898 he emerged as a leading opponent of the council's new policy of municipal housing, arguing that a costly policy of wholesale slum clearance and house building by the council would merely displace the poorest slum dwellers to other parts of the metropolis. Arnold argued that private developers should continue to provide dwellings for the lowest wage-earners, and that the council should limit itself to sanitary regulation and the promotion of transport between the centre and the suburbs.<br>
<br>On 18 July 1895 Arnold was knighted, and in 1897 Cambridge University bestowed on him the honorary degree of LLD. He was also a magistrate for London and Dartmouth and a harbour commissioner for Dartmouth, where he had a residence. During his final years he retained a keen interest in party politics. His views on Irish home rule had led him towards the Liberal-imperialist camp and this was confirmed by his opposition to official Liberal policy on the South African War. Although he supported the &#145;patriotic&#146; aims of the Imperial Liberal Council he did not join it, and remained uncomfortable with the term &#145;imperialist&#146; which, &#145;to me is always suggestive of a waxed moustache and December 1852&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 22 Oct 1900, 5d). Arnold argued that the Cobdenite policy of peace and non-intervention, framed in a different time and context, could not be maintained in the present era of great power rivalry. He remained a vocal opponent of Campbell-Bannerman's leadership and a supporter of Lord Rosebery until the last, writing as late as March 1902 to damn the Liberal leadership for its vague declaration of policy on Irish home rule  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 12 March 1902, 6). His last public appearance was as chairman of the London Anti-Vaccination Society, at a meeting a few weeks before his death. He died of heart disease at his home, 45 Kensington Park Gardens, London, on 20 May 1902, and was buried at Gravesend. He was survived by his wife, Amelia, who founded a scholarship in his memory at Girton College, Cambridge. She held advanced views on the women's franchise question, and was an active campaigner in her own right. She served on the executive of the Married Women's Property Committee and the Anti-Narcotic League, for whom she wrote a pamphlet, <span class="italic">A Woman on Tobacco</span>, in 1885. In addition to her travels in the Mediterranean and Near East with her husband, Lady Arnold was an author and novelist. She produced translations of two works by Emilio Castelar (1832&#150;1899), president of the first Spanish republic, published as <span class="italic">Old Rome and New Italy</span> (1873) and <span class="italic">The Life of Byron and other Sketches</span> (1875), which illustrated her shared interest in Greek independence and wider European nationalist movements. She also wrote several novels, including <span class="italic">His by Right</span>, <span class="italic">John Hesketh's Charge</span>, <span class="italic">Under Foot</span>, and <span class="italic">Better than Gold</span>. The last and best-known, published in 1873, took the form of sensational social melodrama, dealing with sexual politics within a propertied Victorian family. Lady Arnold died on 25 March 1915, aged ninety-three.<br>
