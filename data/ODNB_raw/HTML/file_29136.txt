<span class="headword">Weston, Sir  William</span>  (<em>b. </em>after 1469, <em>d.</em> 1540), <span class="occ">prior of the hospital of St John of Jerusalem in England</span>, was the second son of Sir Edmund Weston (<i>d</i>. before 1509) of Boston, governor of Guernsey and esquire of the body to Henry VII, and Katharine (or Kathryn) Lempriere, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Camell, of Shapwick, Dorset. His elder brother was the courtier <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29124/', "Sir Richard Weston")</script>. He was born in the Jersey manor of Rozel, his mother being the widow of its seigneur, Renaud Lempriere. On reaching adulthood William continued the remarkable family tradition of service to the order of St John. Two of his uncles and two of his great-uncles had been hospitallers, his great-uncle William Dawney and uncle John Weston both becoming turcopoliers (coastguard commanders) of Rhodes, and the latter prior of England between 1476 and 1489. Although William Weston perhaps joined the order in his uncle's lifetime, he does not appear in its records until 1498, when he attended a general chapter at Rhodes. By this time he was a preceptor, responsible for one of the order's houses, probably that of Ansty in Wiltshire. In 1504, while he was still in Rhodes, William was granted the Cambridgeshire estate of Sawston by the grand master, &Eacute;mery d'Amboise. Two years later he was among those praised for providing hospitality to the party of Sir Richard Guildford on its way to the Holy Land. Soon after he was promoted to be preceptor of the Hampshire house of Baddesley, which he returned to England to administer in 1510. He remained there until summoned to attend the general chapter held in Rhodes in 1517, and was in the Aegean for the next five years.<br>
<br>During the Turkish siege of Rhodes in 1522 Weston commanded the post of England, which was the scene of some of the heaviest fighting of the conflict, and lost a finger to an arquebusier's shot on 24 September. He may have been more seriously injured than this would suggest, as charge of the English post was then bestowed elsewhere. By the time of the order's departure from the island, on 1 January 1523, however, he was sufficiently recovered to be given command of the order's great ship, which he conducted to Crete. Elected turcopolier there in February, Weston was soon granted expectancy to the priorate of England and returned home. In the following year he was sent by Henry VIII to Italy to deliver 50,000 &eacute;cus to the duc de Bourbon. Having had some difficulty discharging this responsibility, he went on to the order's convent, then at Viterbo, and remained there until June 1527, when he was elected prior of England after the death of Sir Thomas Docwra. He returned home and managed to defuse Henry VIII's threats to confiscate the order's lands, or transfer its personnel to Calais, by a discreet bribe of &pound;4000, following which the king ostentatiously granted a similar sum towards the recovery of Rhodes.<br>
<br>During the first years of his priorate Weston was preoccupied with the recovery of Sir Thomas Docwra's effects from the latter's family and servants, and with the handover of the prioral estate of Sandford (Oxfordshire) to Cardinal College, Oxford. Once he had established himself the priory suffered heavily from the legislation of the Reformation Parliament, especially the <span class="roman">Act of First Fruits and Tenths</span> (1534), which Weston opposed from the Lords. In non-financial matters, however, he obediently toed the line, signing the <span class="roman">Act of Succession</span> of 1534, and agreeing to the letters patent which subjected all English members of the order to royal control in 1538. Despite this he was always regarded as a conservative by the crown, and was employed on less government business than his predecessor had been. In 1539 he suffered a major blow with the execution of his favoured nephew, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/53527/', "Sir Thomas Dingley")</script>, for treason, and when the order was dissolved in 1540 he expired, at the priory of St John, Clerkenwell, Middlesex, on 7 May, the day the act passed through the Commons. He was buried in the old nunnery church of St Mary, Clerkenwell, later the church of St James. Although his elaborate marble tomb was largely destroyed during the rebuilding of the church in 1788, an exceptionally fine cadaver figure from it has survived, and is conserved in the hospital's former priory church, now in the hands of the order of St John.<br>
