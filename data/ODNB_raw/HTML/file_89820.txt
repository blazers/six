<span class="headword">Miller, Sir  (Oswald) Bernard</span>  (1904&#150;2003), <span class="occ">department store chairman</span>, was born at 16 Victoria Road, Fulham, London, on 25 March 1904, the son of Arthur Miller, a park keeper and later civil servant, and his wife, Margaret Jane, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Jones. He was educated at Sloane School, Chelsea, and then Jesus College, Oxford, where he won the Stanhope prize in 1925 for his work on Robert Harley, earl of Oxford (published the same year) and graduated with a first-class degree in 1927. He considered a career in teaching or the civil service (having passed the entrance exam) but instead joined John Lewis, the London department store.<br>
<br>The invitation to join John Lewis had come from Spedan Lewis, the son of the founder of the business, who was about to launch a business partnership (an experiment in profit-sharing and industrial organization). Miller, who had an interest in Owenite ideals, found Lewis's partnership congenial. On first meeting, he was also entranced by Lewis's &#145;absolute dynamism&#146;, and later recalled: &#145;At times one thought that this man must be crazy, but one was swept along&#146;  (Macpherson, 21, 24). Miller began his career on the shop floor, selling silk, an experience which provided a taste of department store work. In this role he met the patriarch himself, John Lewis, whose animus towards his son's policy of employing graduates led Miller to don a disguise whenever the elder Lewis visited the store. Within two years Miller was helping Spedan Lewis create the partnership's new constitution. Miller had a dual role as company secretary and as financial controller of the business. On 25 August 1931 he married Jessica Rose Marie ffoulkes (<i>d</i>. 1985), a 24-year-old buyer at John Lewis and daughter of Arthur Fisher ffoulkes, medical doctor. They had three sons, two of whom were to join the partnership.<br>
<br>In 1935 Miller became a director. While Spedan Lewis concentrated on refining the partnership's constitution, Miller handled the running of the business. During the Second World War his responsibilities broadened, as he became the partnership's general inspector. He had to deal with bomb damage to the flagship Oxford Street store and the absorption of the ailing Selfridge Provincial Stores Group (composed of fifteen stores and 4000 employees). In the early 1950s the partnership countered the impact of the Korean War by buying imported goods at high prices, but this later backfired when the business was left with a vast stock of overpriced goods. The staff bonus&#151;a key feature of the partnership&#151;was cancelled until the mid-1950s, and pay cuts were introduced. Against this difficult backdrop Spedan Lewis crystallized his ideas for the irrevocable Second Trust Partnership in 1950, when he announced formally that Miller would succeed him as chairman in 1955.<br>
<br>Miller marked his accession as chairman with a programme of rebuilding at the Oxford Street store and with the first purpose-built Waitrose supermarket in London. He acquired a printing works for textiles and introduced computerized stock control. What should have been a smooth transition, however, was upset by the actions of the partnership's founder. Spedan Lewis was unable to adjust to his diminished role in the business and fought a sustained rearguard action against the policies of his successor. Miller was subject to a campaign of criticism through the partnership's <span class="italic">Gazette</span>, in which Lewis described his prot&eacute;g&eacute; as unintelligent and obstinate. Miller endured the campaign patiently and remained on friendly terms with Lewis, secure in the knowledge that the partnership's council would vote down any attempt by Lewis to take up the reins again.<br>
<br>After the late 1950s the partnership's profitability grew. Profit distributions returned in 1955 (when 8 per cent was paid to the partners&#151;that is, the employees), and such distributions were to average 13.5 per cent during Miller's chairmanship. He continued to modernize the constitution of the partnership to increase managerial accountability, and under him the Oxford Street store continued to develop. He also led a major move into supermarkets, via the Waitrose chain. Between 1950 and 1972 (when Miller retired and relinquished the chairmanship to Spedan's nephew Peter Lewis) the partnership's performance was impressive: the number of partners grew from 12,000 to 20,000 and sales expanded from &pound;28m to &pound;140m, while the number of Waitrose supermarkets grew from three to forty-three. This performance led economists and social commentators to ponder the impact of the partnership's business philosophy. That the partnership under Spedan Lewis and Miller was a success could not be gainsaid; on the other hand, it was also a period of expansion for other retail businesses.<br>
<br>Miller replaced Spedan Lewis's intimidating and driven management style with his own brand of quiet conviction. Like Lewis, however, he cut a conservative and well-groomed figure, had no interest in amassing riches, and was devoted to the partnership ideal. He served on a number of government bodies (such as the Monopolies Commission, from 1961 to 1969), and was pro-chancellor of Southampton University from 1983 to 1990. His knighthood in 1967 was for public service. His liking for the arts was shown in his chairmanship of the Glyndebourne Festival Society. He died of cancer of the prostate at Sutton Manor nursing home, Sutton Scotney, Hampshire, on 23 February 2003. He was survived by his three sons.<br>
