<span class="headword">Younger,  Robert</span>, Baron Blanesburgh  (1861&#150;1946), <span class="occ">judge</span>, was born at Alloa, Clackmannanshire, on 12 September 1861, the fifth son of James Younger (1818&#150;1868), of the well-known family of brewers, and his wife, Janet (<i>d</i>. 1912), daughter of John McEwan. His eldest brother was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37082/', "George Younger, first Viscount Younger of Leckie")</script>. Educated at the Edinburgh Academy and at Balliol College, Oxford, Younger gained a third class in classical moderations in 1881 and a second in jurisprudence in 1883. In 1884 he was called to the bar by the Inner Temple in London and entered the chambers of John Gorell Barnes as a pupil. Later he transferred locally, to Lincoln's Inn, where he devilled for some years for Henry Burton Buckley.<br>
<br>Younger's career was helped by his successful advocacy and his legal competence. In 1900 he took silk, and as a leader he came to be well liked. In 1915 he was appointed a judge of the Chancery Division in succession to Sir Thomas Rolls Warrington and received the customary knighthood. His next move was to the Court of Appeal in 1919, in succession to Sir Henry Edward Duke. Finally, after Lord Cave became lord chancellor in 1922, Younger succeeded him in 1923 as a lord of appeal, with a life peerage as Baron Blanesburgh of Alloa. It has been said that his career was largely a tribute to his personality and the charm it radiated. He was a cultivated man with a love of books, painting, and music, something his wealth allowed him to pursue without restraint.<br>
<br>As a judge Younger was competent rather than distinguished. As a lord of appeal he sat from 1923 to 1937. It was a time when Atkin, Macmillan, and Wright held sway, but Blanesburgh was overshadowed by his peers. His vision of the role of an appeal judge was to look for the current law. He saw little role for any creative function in the final Court of Appeal and he favoured a narrow view of contract (<i>Bell v. Lever Bros</i>, 1932). His preferred solution was to leave any change in the law to parliament, as in <i>Harett v. Fisher</i> (1927). For Younger the search for the <i>ratio decidendi</i> was all: &#145;I agree, of course, at once, that by the <i>ratio decidendi</i> of that case&#151;if it can be discovered&#151;and by the decision itself&#151;whether its <i>ratio decidendi</i> can be discovered or not&#151;your Lordships are as much bound as is at least every English Court&#146;  (<i>Great Western Railway v. The Mostyn (owners)</i>, [1928] AC 57, 99). Formalism was all. As the years passed, however, Blanesburgh's narrow views irritated his colleagues. In 1935, in a memorandum to the incoming Lord Chancellor Hailsham, his fellow law lord, Lord Dunedin, said of him: &#145;You will <i>not</i> as Sankey did, refuse his resignation&#146;  (Heuston, 481). Eventually poor eyesight forced him out in 1937.<br>
<br>Apart from the law, Younger was involved in various public service activities during the First World War. In May 1915 he was appointed a member of an advisory committee set up to deal with claims by enemy subjects in the United Kingdom for exemption from internment or deportation. In September 1915 the Home Office appointed him chairman of a committee on the treatment by the enemy of British prisoners of war. Younger was also chairman of a committee established in 1920 to advise on applications from ex-enemy nationals for release of their property. Probably his most arduous public service was rendered from 1925 to 1930 as principal British representative on the reparation commission under the treaty of peace with Germany. For his public services he was appointed GBE in 1917.<br>
<br>The ample means which he enjoyed enabled Younger to gratify his generous instincts by many benefactions. He was, in turn, honoured for his distinction. He became a bencher of Lincoln's Inn in 1907 and was treasurer in 1932. Balliol College, of which he was made an honorary fellow in 1916 and in 1934 visitor, had special reason for gratitude since he helped renovate the dining hall and chapel. Oxford University made him an honorary DCL (1928), and from the universities of Edinburgh (1919) and St Andrews (1929) he received the honorary degree of LLD. He was also chairman of the delegates of King's College, London (1929&#150;44), prime warden of the Goldsmiths' Company (1931&#150;2), and chairman of the Royal Caledonian Schools. He died, unmarried, at his Sussex home, the Grey Friars, Winchelsea, on 17 August 1946.<br>
