<span class="headword">Sedgwick,  Amy</span> <span class="st"> [<em>real name </em>Sarah Gardiner]</span>  (1835&#150;1897), <span class="occ">actress</span>, was born in Bristol on 27 October 1835, the daughter of William Gardiner. After acting as an amateur in London in 1852, apparently under the name of Mortimer, she appeared at Richmond Theatre in 1853 as Julia in <span class="italic">The Hunchback</span> by Sheridan Knowles, when she took Amy Sedgwick as her professional name. She then went to Bristol to play Mrs White in the farce of that name, but owing to a misunderstanding with the lessee appeared only for one night. She then went to Cardiff, where she took the part of Pauline in Bulwer-Lytton's <span class="italic">The Lady of Lyons</span>. Later she played on Moseley's Yorkshire circuit, and then went to Manchester, where she was employed by John Knowles for three seasons and became a great favourite.<br>
<br>Amy Sedgwick's first professional London appearance was at the Haymarket, under J. B. Buckstone, on 5 October 1857, again playing Pauline. On 7 November she was the first Hester Grazebrook in Tom Taylor's <span class="italic">Unequal Match</span>, the part with which her name long remained associated. On 16 October 1858 she married Dr W. B. Parkes, who died in 1863. She remained at the Haymarket until 1860, her roles including Beatrice in <span class="italic">Much Ado about Nothing</span>, Lady Teazle, Rosalind, and Peg Woffington. Among her creations at this period were Kate Robertson in J. Palgrave Simpson's <span class="italic">The World and the Stage</span>, Una in Edmund Falconer's <span class="italic">Family Secret</span>, and Lady Blanche in Taylor's <span class="italic">Babes in the Wood</span>.<br>
<br>In June 1861 Sedgwick was at the Olympic, where she was the first Mrs Bloomly in Horace Wigan's <span class="italic">A Charming Woman</span>, and in February 1863 she played Orelia in Lewis Filmore's <span class="italic">The Winning Suit</span>. In 1866 she managed the Haymarket during the summer season, and on 2 October played Lady Macbeth to Barry Sullivan's Macbeth at Drury Lane. Back at the Haymarket, she was the first Blanche de Raincourt in Mead's adaptation <span class="italic">The Coquette</span>. On 10 October 1868 she opened the Marylebone, renamed the Royal Alfred, as director (under H. B. Lacy), with <span class="italic">Pindee Singh</span> by C. H. Stephenson, in which she played the title role. Despite the presence at the opening of the duke of Edinburgh, the play (and Sedgwick's directorship) was not a success. Another original part followed at the Haymarket: Ida Fitzherbert in Le Thi&egrave;re's <span class="italic">All for Money</span> (July 1869). On 27 May 1873 Sedgwick married a Liverpool solicitor, Charles Pemberton (<i>d</i>. 1875). Her last appearance in London was as Constance in Knowles's <span class="italic">The Love Chase</span> at the Haymarket in May 1877. Thereafter she took pupils and gave recitals and readings in London and the provinces, more than once reading before Queen Victoria. She married Charles Goostry on 3 August 1878, and lived in Brighton for some years, before finally moving to Hill View, Haywards Heath, where she died on 7 November 1897. She was buried in the churchyard there. A capable actress, she failed to reach the first rank.<br>
