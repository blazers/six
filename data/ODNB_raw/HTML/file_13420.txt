<span class="headword">Hodges,  Charles Howard</span>  (1764&#150;1837), <span class="occ">portrait painter and mezzotint engraver</span>, was born in London on 23 July 1764, the son of the miniature painter of the same name. He learned the rudiments of drawing from his father and at the age of fifteen he went to work in the studio of a family friend, the engraver, art dealer, and printseller William Humphrey. Hodges enrolled in the Royal Academy Schools as a student of etching and engraving in 1782. Later he worked in the studios of Sir Joshua Reynolds and John Raphael Smith. On 12 August 1784 Hodges married Margaret Harmar (1759&#150;1819) at St George's Church, Hanover Square, London. They had three children, James Newman, Mary, and Emma Jane. James Newman later worked in his father's studio, but few prints by him are now known.<br>
<br>Hodges published his first mezzotint&#151;a portrait of Lady Dashwood with a child, after Reynolds&#151;in 1784. He rapidly gained renown for his skill in the mezzotint medium and was much in demand to make prints after portraits of important personages of the time by painters including Reynolds, George Romney, and John Hoppner. Among his pupils was Samuel William Reynolds (1773&#150;1835), who served a seven-year apprenticeship with him.<br>
<br>After a business visit to the Netherlands with William Humphrey, Hodges decided to settle there and in 1792 moved his family to The Hague. In the Netherlands, Hodges worked initially as a mezzotint printmaker, although he also began to produce portraits in pastel. From about 1790 these pastel portraits were very successful, and he carried out numerous commissions for portraits from persons of standing at court and in the magistracy and the church. Hodges's family moved to Amsterdam in 1797 and eventually settled at 206 Prinsengracht, where the artist remained until his death.<br>
<br>Hodges also painted portraits in oil, receiving his first commissions from about 1800. His reputation in the Netherlands continued to grow, and he portrayed vast numbers of bankers, merchants, shipowners, and members of the aristocracy. Among his sitters were such eminent political figures as Louis Napoleon (1809; Frans Halsmuseum, Haarlem), William I (1816; Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam) and Rutger Jan Schimmelpenninck (1806; priv. coll.). Hodges also continued to engrave in mezzotint from the portraits painted by himself.<br>
<br>While in the Netherlands, Hodges worked as an art dealer in association with William Humphrey, chiefly in selling prints, many to English collectors. When the kingdom of the Netherlands was formed, Hodges was appointed one of the commissioners sent to Paris in 1815 to identify and recover the pictures looted by Napoleon in 1795 (now in the Mauritshuis, The Hague). He died in Amsterdam on 24 July 1837 and was buried at the English church in the Begijnhof. His works are frequently found in collections in the Netherlands.<br>
