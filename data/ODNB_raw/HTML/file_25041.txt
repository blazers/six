<span class="headword">Seagrave <span class="st"> [Segrave]</span>, Sir  Stephen  of</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1241), <span class="occ">justice and administrator</span>, was son of Gilbert of Seagrave, who held lands at Seagrave in Leicestershire and in 1166 held Brailes in Warwickshire as a fourth part of a knight's fee, under William, earl of Warwick. Gilbert was an under-sheriff of Warwickshire and Leicestershire during Richard I's reign and acted as a justice itinerant in Lincolnshire and Leicestershire in 1195. Out of regard for Hugh Despenser, Stephen of Seagrave's brother-in-law, King John in 1208 remitted half a debt of 112 marks that, as his father's heir, Seagrave owed the crown. Remaining faithful to the king, he received from him in 1216 custody of the lands of the rebel Stephen de Gant in Lincolnshire and Leicestershire, and the manor of Kineton in Warwickshire in fee, at a yearly rent. Seagrave married first Rohesia, daughter of Thomas and sister of Hugh Despenser, and second Ida, also called Ela, sister of Henry Hastings, who in 1247 was fined &pound;500 for an unlicensed second marriage with Hugh Pecche. He had three sons: John (<i>d</i>. 1231), the eldest, who married Emma, daughter and heir of Roger de Caux; <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25034/', "Gilbert of Seagrave (d. 1254)")</script>, who succeeded him; and Stephen; he also had a daughter, Eleanor.<br>
<br>After the accession of Henry III Seagrave's importance and offices rapidly increased. From 1217 onwards he was prominent as a justice; he sat at Westminster in 1218 and later, and was constantly employed on eyre. In 1219 he was one of the king's proctors at Norham before the papal legate for the hearing of a dispute with the Scottish king. In 1220 he was given the custody of Sauvey Castle, Leicestershire, and received a grant from the king of the manor of Alconbury in Huntingdonshire. He was sheriff of Essex and Hertfordshire from 1220 to 1224, and of Lincolnshire from 1221 to 1223. From 1228 to 1234 he was sheriff of Buckinghamshire, Bedfordshire, and Northamptonshire and from 1229 to 1234 of Warwickshire and Leicestershire. Seagrave's wealth increased, and he purchased lands; and when Henry departed for Brittany in 1230 he was appointed one of the regents. In 1232 he was granted the profits, other than the farms paid into the exchequer, of the counties of Bedford, Buckingham, Warwick, and Leicester for life. On the fall of Hubert de Burgh in that year, the king appointed Seagrave chief justiciar, though he was only a knight, having previously given him custody of the castles of Dover, Rochester, Canterbury, Windsor, Odiham, Hertford, and Colchester. He was violently hostile to de Burgh, and pressed the king to imprison him, and even to put him to death as a traitor.<br>
<br>Seagrave as chief justiciar became closely associated with the royal favourite Peter des Roches, and in conjunction with him counselled Henry to resist Richard Marshal, earl of Pembroke, Gilbert Basset, and other lords who in 1233 were associated against the government. The bishops in October threatened to excommunicate him and others of the party by name for giving the king evil counsel, but finally pronounced only a general sentence against those who turned the king's heart against his natural-born subjects. He accompanied the king's army to Grosmont in November, and lost his baggage when Marshal's adherents surprised the royal camp. The king having made an offer to Marshal in December, provided that he would surrender to his mercy, Seagrave ensured that the earl should be informed that he advised him to do so. In the first days of 1234 Richard Siward, at the head of a company of outlaws, ravaged Seagrave, burnt his fine houses, oxen, and stores of grain, and carried off many valuable horses and rich spoil. Later the same band ravaged Alconbury, and burnt his buildings there. He was much hated, and it was believed that he was concerned in the treachery by which Richard Marshal lost his life in April. When in May the king was reconciled to his lords, Seagrave was dismissed from his offices, and on 14 June was deprived of five of his manors, and was called upon to give an account of his receipts and expenditure. He took shelter in the abbey of St Mary des Pr&eacute;s, near Leicester, where it is said that he resumed clerical tonsure: this may mean that he had taken minor clerical orders early in his career (though he had been knighted by 1219 at the latest). On 14 July he appeared before the king at Westminster, under the protection of the archbishop of Canterbury. Henry called him a foul traitor for having evilly advised him against Hubert de Burgh and his other lords, and demanded his accounts, but, at the archbishop's request, gave him until Michaelmas to make them up. He is said to have attempted to excuse himself by laying the blame on Peter des Roches and Walter Mauclerk. In February 1235 he is said to have paid a fine of 1000 marks to be reconciled with the king, but was not subsequently taken back into favour as he had hoped.<br>
<br>In June 1236 Seagrave was fully restored to favour, and in 1237 was reconciled by the legate Otto to the lords whom he had offended. He was appointed justice of Chester in June 1237. Henry seems to have again made him one of his trusted counsellors, and it was perhaps because he was on specially confidential terms with the king that, in common with Richard, earl of Cornwall, and the queen, he was exempted by name from the excommunication pronounced by the archbishop of Canterbury in 1239 against certain of the king's advisers. In February 1239 he became a justice of the court <i>coram rege</i>, and when William of Raleigh was elected bishop of Norwich in April of that year became senior justice of that court. In the last two years of his life, according to Matthew Paris, he held a dominant position in the administration, though his direction of affairs seems to have been unadventurous. Shortly before his death he entered the Augustinian abbey of St Mary des Pr&eacute;s, where he died probably on 11 October 1241.<br>
<br>Paris says that Seagrave was easily led by others, that he owed his rise from a humble station to great wealth and high office to his own exertions, that he cared more for his own interest than the public good, but that he did some things that merited the happy end of life that he made. Certain of Seagrave's opinions on points of law are cited with respect by the author of <span class="italic">De legibus et consuetudinibus Angliae</span>. He was a benefactor to the abbey of St Mary des Pr&eacute;s, and to the priory of Stoneleigh, and the Cistercian abbey of Combe, both in Warwickshire. His shield, as given by Paris, was blazoned sable, three garbs or, banded gules.<br>
