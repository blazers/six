<span class="headword">Finden,  Amy  Woodforde-</span> <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Amelia Rowe Ward]</span>  (1860&#150;1919), <span class="occ">composer</span>, was born in Valpara&iacute;so, Chile, the fourth daughter and ninth of ten children of Alfred Richard Ward (1809/10&#150;1867) and his wife, Virginia Worthington, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Heath (1826/7&#150;1912). Her father was an American merchant acting as United States consul there; her mother was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. On her father's death the family settled in London, where her mother was naturalized a British subject in March 1873. She is said to have begun composing at the age of nine. She was taught privately by several teachers including Carl Schloesser, Amy Horrocks, and a Herr Winter. As a young adult Amy Ward travelled extensively in India, notably in Kashmir. It was there that she met her future husband, Lieutenant-Colonel Woodeford Woodforde-Finden (1844&#150;1916), son of George Caulfield and Melissa Woodforde-Finden; he was a brigadier surgeon in the Bengal cavalry and a widower. They married on 17 September 1893 at St Thomas's Cathedral in Bombay. After returning home on leave in 1896 her husband retired, and the couple remained in England.<br>
<br>Woodforde-Finden's most celebrated work, the <span class="italic">Four Indian Love Lyrics</span>, is a collection of songs for voice and piano, set to poems by Laurence Hope from <span class="italic">The Garden of Kama and other Love Lyrics from India</span> (1901). Following rejections from several publishers, Woodforde-Finden published them privately in 1902. The music includes many standard nineteenth-century orientalist techniques: ornamentation, unison passages, and syncopated rhythms. It is often rhythmically and harmonically repetitive, with drones in the piano part supporting a chromatic, sometimes pentatonic, vocal line. Her melodies in particular are well crafted and often memorable, a factor that contributed to the collection's success.<br>
<br>Indeed the <span class="italic">Four Indian Love Lyrics</span> were arguably the most successful songs of the early twentieth century. Woodforde-Finden hit the right tone for the Victorian drawing room: at a time when orientalism was in fashion, and music for amateur performance in great demand, she produced music that was both exotic and playable. The songs' success was established by the singer Hamilton Earle, who regularly performed them, and further enhanced by Boosey and Hawkes, who published them in 1903. Hope's poems, originally published in 1901, were well known and popular by the time Woodforde-Finden set them to music.<br>
<br>It was probably through her husband's acquaintance with Malcolm Hassels Nicolson that Woodforde-Finden met the writer of the Indian love lyrics, Laurence Hope (pseudonym of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35237/', "Adela Florence Nicolson, n&#233;e Cory (1865&#150;1904)")</script>). The details of their relationship are not known, but rumours surround both women's contribution to the songs. Hope's words to the &#145;Kashmiri Song&#146;, the story of a love affair between a married English woman and the son of an Indian raja, were thought to be autobiographical. It was also said that Woodforde-Finden wrote the music in a mental asylum.<br>
<br>All Woodforde-Finden's surviving works are songs. She wrote some under her maiden name, Amy Ward. Before <span class="italic">Four Indian Love Lyrics</span> she had two works published by Boosey &amp; Co., <span class="italic">A Night in June</span> (1896) and <span class="italic">O Flower of the World</span> (1897). Later collections of songs include: <span class="italic">A Lover in Damascus</span> (1904), <span class="italic">On Jhelum River</span> (1905), and <span class="italic">The Pagoda of Flowers</span> (1907). The <span class="italic">Four Indian Love Lyrics</span> were later rearranged for several instrumental combinations, including violin and piano, salon orchestra, and military band. Most of her work set in such diverse places as the Middle East, north Africa, Japan, and South America where she spent her childhood. No evidence remains of her travelling to these places. The Indian love lyrics have continued to be popular throughout the twentieth century; and words from the &#145;Kashmiri Song&#146; (&#145;Pale Hands I loved beside the Shalimar&#146;) were poignantly evoked by Anthony Powell in <span class="italic">A Dance to the Music of Time</span>  (Spurling, 241).<br>
<br>In 1914 Amy Woodforde-Finden gave a concert of her works in the Aeolian Hall in London. It is not known if she sang, played the piano, or both; or if such performances were a regular feature of her life. She died of heart failure on 13 March 1919 at 3 Cork Street, London. Her husband had died three years before on 27 April 1916 in Harrow. She was buried in the village of Hampsthwaite, near Harrogate, Yorkshire.<br>
