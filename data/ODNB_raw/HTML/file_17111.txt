<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Lowther,  John</span>, first Viscount Lonsdale  (1655&#150;1700), <span class="occ">landowner and politician</span>, was born on 25 April 1655 at Hackthorpe Hall, Westmorland, the third of the four children of Colonel John Lowther of Hackthorpe (1628&#150;1668), politician, and his first wife, Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1662), daughter and coheir of Sir Henry Bellingham.<br>
<br>The dominant influence on John Lowther's early life was his grandfather. His mother died when he was six. His father then remarried against the will of his own father, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/67097/', "Sir John Lowther")</script> of Lowther, first baronet (1606&#150;1675), who promptly disinherited him. Sir John sent his grandson to Kendal grammar school, but withdrew him after a year. Subsequently he was educated at Lowther Hall, Westmorland, under the supervision of Sir John's butler &#145;whose cruelty and blows did no good to my tender years&#146;, as he later recalled in his memoirs  (Lonsdale papers). He went next to Sedbergh School, and then on 12 July 1670 entered Queen's College, Oxford. He left after eighteen months without taking a degree, and subsequently spent a year at an academy in Paris. Returning to England after a further six months in France, he attended lectures at the Inner Temple, from whence he was subsequently called to the bar in 1677.<br>
<br>As early as 1671, when Lowther was just sixteen, his grandfather was anxious to see him settled. He resisted until 1674 when, on 3 December, he married Katherine Thynne [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/67731/', "Lowther, Katherine (1653&#150;1713)")</script>], daughter of Sir Henry Frederick Thynne, in Henry VII's chapel in Westminster Abbey. John Lowther was nineteen and his bride twenty-one. When his grandfather died on 30 November 1675 Lowther inherited both the family estate and&#151;his own father having died in 1668&#151;the baronetcy. Having reached the age of twenty-one, in March 1677 he was returned to parliament for Westmorland. Apart from the brief session of October 1680&#150;January 1681 he was re-elected to every parliament until his elevation to the House of Lords in 1696.<br>
<br>Lowther made his maiden speech in the Commons on 19 December 1678 during a debate on the Popish Plot, but undertook little further political involvement until 1685, when he opposed James II in parliament. He came to political prominence in 1688 when he took the lead in securing Cumberland and Westmorland for William of Orange, in the face of opposition from Sir Christopher Musgrave and Sir George Fletcher. On 9 December he and his tenants secured a ship at Workington harbour bound for Ireland with arms, and several days later they were largely responsible for the fall of the Carlisle garrison. Lowther was hailed as a hero for securing the border region for William. He was made vice-chamberlain in the new king's household, a privy councillor, and lord lieutenant of Cumberland and Westmorland. On 18 March 1690 he was appointed first lord of the Treasury and leader of the House of Commons. He was subsequently one of the nine members of the council appointed in June 1690 to advise Queen Mary during her husband's campaign in Ireland. She later described Lowther as &#145;a very honest but weak man&#146;  (Owen, 205).<br>
<br>Lowther was not considered a success as first lord of the Treasury, and he was replaced by Sidney, Lord Godolphin, on 15 November 1690. A contemporary squib derided &#145;the dull, insipid stream of his set speeches, made up of whipt cream&#146;, and dismissed him as &#145;an empty piece of misplaced eloquence&#146;  (<span class="italic">Poems on Affairs of State: Augustan Satirical Verse, 1660&#150;1714</span>, ed. G. de F. Lord and others, 7 vols., 1963&#150;75, 2.211). The king refused to allow him to retire altogether, and Lowther remained on the Treasury board as second commissioner. He also stayed on Queen Mary's council, suggesting that he retained the king's confidence, and he continued as leader of the Commons. As one of only two commoners on the council, he had to defend the government's policies in the Commons, often against accusations levelled from the leader of the opposition, his fellow Cumbrian and arch political rival, the tory Sir Christopher Musgrave. He was frequently criticized in the house as a former country politician who now held two lucrative places, in the Treasury and (as vice-chamberlain) the royal household, and the situation did not improve when he received a gift from the king of 2000 guineas. With some relief Lowther left the Treasury board in March 1692. Among recommendations in a later letter to his son Lowther warned him to avoid government office and the Treasury in particular.<br>
<br>Lowther continued as vice-chamberlain until January 1693 and government spokesman in the Commons until February 1694. He resigned the lord lieutenancy to the earl of Carlisle in June 1694, but despite claiming he wished to live quietly in the country he took his wife and family to Bath and London and he was re-elected for Westmorland in October 1695. The election was &#145;a great expense&#146;, and he decided to &#145;begg an honour of the King&#146; because &#145;securitie and eas are to be had no other way&#146;  (<span class="italic">Correspondence</span>, 241). On 28 May 1696 he was created Baron Lowther of Lowther and Viscount Lonsdale in the county of Westmorland. He was introduced in the House of Lords on 13 January 1697. Shortly after taking his seat, Lonsdale suffered a serious illness. On recovery he told Sir Daniel Fleming of Rydal that &#145;it hath not pleased God so to dispose off me yett&#146;  (Owen, 211). For a while Lonsdale stayed out of politics, but in March 1699 he was summoned by the king to London and made lord privy seal. Subsequently he was appointed one of the nine lords justices to govern the country as regents in the king's absence on the continent. In December 1699 he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society.<br>
<br>Lowther inherited from his grandfather the family estates in Westmorland, which included the chief seat at Lowther and a second family home at Hackthorpe Hall, and lands in Cumberland, Yorkshire, and co. Durham. He made no fewer than eighty-one separate purchases of property in Cumberland and Westmorland, at a cost of &pound;33,731, and he spent a further &pound;10,000 on property in Yorkshire, again designed to consolidate the existing estates. His landed income was &pound;6387 in 1694&#150;5, and in 1696 he wrote to his son that &#145;I would not if I might wish have the estate of my family swell above &pound;10,000 a year, and even now when it is but little more than six, in my opinion it is great enough&#146;  (&#145;Letter to his son&#146;, Lonsdale papers). He maintained a garden at Lowther to help supply the family with food, and a flourishing stud. In 1696 an Irish correspondent claimed to have heard &#145;so much of your lordship's breed of horses that I am ambitious to have one of them&#146;  (Lonsdale papers). He advised his son to adopt improved methods of husbandry, although he did not necessarily take his own advice.<br>
<br>Lonsdale built a new house at Lowther. Between 1681 and 1684 he bought various properties and rehoused those displaced in what is now called Lowther Newtown. This cost him &pound;1300. Lonsdale then built his new hall at cost of &pound;6460, new stables (&pound;1500), and new offices (&pound;1200). He employed William Talman of the king's office of works, and deputy to Wren, to prepare a design based &#145;principally on my own thought&#146;  (&#145;Letter to his son&#146;, Lonsdale papers). The building costs included &pound;195 for marble from London, and &pound;430 paid to the Italian artist Antonio Verrio (1639&#150;1707), who spent nine months painting the hallway. Celia Fiennes described how it &#145;looks very nobly, with severall rows of trees which leads to large iron gates&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Journey of Celia Fiennes</span>, ed. C. Morris, 1947, 199). It is known today only from the painting by Matthias Read. At the same time, Lonsdale laid out gardens and a park. He also almost completely rebuilt the Norman church at a cost of &pound;300. The building was described by the bishop in 1703 as &#145;in the fairest condition of any parish church in the diocese&#146;  (Owen, 209). He had &#145;hoped to establish some manufacture for the benefit of the poor, to which purpose I had built a house convenient for it&#146;  (&#145;Letter to his son&#146;, Lonsdale papers). This cost &pound;600 but the attempt to promote textile manufacturing failed, and the building was converted into a school &#145;for none but gentlemen's sons&#146;  (ibid.). Two masters were appointed, the boys were boarded in the village, and Lonsdale endowed the school in his will.<br>
<br>By early 1700 Lonsdale's health was giving cause for concern. During April he was visibly ill while leading the opposition to the resumption bill sent from the Commons, which the king wanted to see defeated but which the earl of Marlborough was supporting. The king eventually gave way, but Lonsdale was by now in the hands of Dr John Ratcliffe, the king's own doctor. On 23 May William agreed that he should return to Westmorland. He went via Bath, where the waters apparently brought him no relief. Although on 30 June he was again appointed a lord justice on the council of regency, he died on 10 July at Lowther. James Brydges, later duke of Chandos, wrote that Lonsdale was &#145;a man very eminent for many great qualities which, joined with the opinion the world had of his integrity, could not fail to add very great strength to the side he was of&#146;  (Owen, 215). Lonsdale was buried at Lowther church on 15 July 1700. A magnificent memorial by William Stanton was erected above his tomb. Katherine, his widow, died aged fifty-nine in January 1713 and was buried at Lowther on the 28th; her name was added to her husband's memorial in the church. The couple had had five sons and nine daughters, and at Lonsdale's death the three surviving sons were all under age: Richard, the eldest, inherited the title, but died only months after he came of age, on 1 December 1713; the title and estate passed to his brother Henry.<br>

<a name="cosubject_17109"></a><span class="headword">Henry Lowther</span>, third Viscount Lonsdale  (1694&#150;1751), <span class="occ">court official and gambler</span>, distinguished himself in the defence of Cumberland and Westmorland during the 1715 Jacobite rising. In 1717 he was appointed a lord of the bedchamber, accepting the position without enthusiasm because he was &#145;afraid that a Court employment will require more attendance than I (who am at present very fond of the country) can have inclination to give&#146;  (Lonsdale to Lowther, 21 July 1717, Lonsdale papers). He nevertheless retained the position for ten years. In 1726 he was appointed a governor of the Tower of London, but resigned in 1731 according to Sir James Lowther of Whitehaven, because &#145;he is desirous to live more in the country than he thinks is fit for one of that place&#146;  (Lowther to Spedding, 6 May 1731, Lonsdale papers). He was briefly lord privy seal (1733&#150;5). On the death of Lord Carlisle in 1738 he was appointed lord lieutenant of Cumberland and Westmorland, and was responsible for the defence of the two counties during the 1745 Jacobite rising. He remained at his sister Elizabeth's home at Byram, near Pontefract in Yorkshire, passing much of his responsibility to Sir George Fleming, the octogenarian bishop of Carlisle.<br>
<br>Lonsdale spent little time at Lowther Hall. In March 1718 it was badly damaged by fire. The main central building and most of the inner east, or chapel, wing were gutted. Pictures, furniture, and Verrio's great hall paintings were all lost. Subsequently Lonsdale lived in a converted office wing on his infrequent visits, and he attributed his absence in 1745 to &#145;some alterations in my house which are now in hand &hellip; [and] make it impossible for me to be there&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Jacobite Risings of 1715 and 1745</span>, ed. R. C. Jarvis, 1954, 94). He closed the school at Lowther in 1739 and converted the building for textile manufacture. He was a compulsive gambler, both on horses and in the City. He lost heavily during the South Sea Bubble crisis and as a result had to sell estates valued at more than &pound;26,000. He may have lost more than &pound;30,000. Although he left a depleted estate, his acquisition of burgages in Appleby helped to secure the borough for the Lowthers. Horace Walpole thought him &#145;no great genius&#146;  (H. Walpole, <span class="italic">Memoirs of King George II</span>, ed. J. Brooke, 3 vols., 1985).<br>
<br>Lonsdale died unmarried at Byram on 7 March 1751 and was buried at Lowther on 18 March. The peerage became extinct, although the baronetcy and estates passed to <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17110/', "James Lowther, later earl of Lonsdale")</script>.<br>
