<span class="headword">Hodge,  Arthur</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1811), <span class="occ">planter in the West Indies and murderer</span>, is of unknown parentage. About 1792 he inherited the Belle Vue estate in Tortola, one of the Virgin Islands then within the British colony of the Leeward Islands. He married Ann (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1805), further details of whom are unknown. A prominent figure and a member of the island's council (with the title Honourable), he was also notoriously brutal to his slaves. In 1811, after quarrelling with another council member, he was accused of having murdered at least twelve of them four or five years earlier. Affidavits were sworn by a &#145;free woman of colour&#146; (black people were not allowed to give evidence), Pereen Georges, who had worked in Hodge's household, and by one of his former overseers, Stephen McKeogh; these testified to the murders, mostly by floggings inflicted at Hodge's orders and including two women slaves, one of whom had had boiling water poured down her throat. Hodge was charged with murder and arrested.<br>
<br>The case aroused great public interest in the island. A Leeward Islands statute, the so-called <span class="roman">Melioration Act</span> of 1798, declared the killing of a slave to be murder, and one Tortola planter had already been tried for murdering a slave, but acquitted. It was believed that Hodge's enemies had brought the charges maliciously for personal reasons, particularly as they were all cases that had happened several years earlier and had not been brought up before. Governor Hugh Elliot, a former diplomat who had disgraced his diplomatic career in Europe and had been sent out to govern the Leeward Islands, constituted a special commission to hear the case promptly (the regular sessions being over) and hastened to Tortola himself for the trial. Hodge was charged with the murder of his slave Prosper by flogging. Eight more indictments were drawn up to charge him with other murders, should this charge fail, and the manacled skeleton of one of the victims was dug up to be used in evidence, if necessary. The case for the defence consisted chiefly of attempts to defame the two chief witnesses. The case began at 10 a.m. and went on until 8 a.m. the following morning, when, after an hour and a half of deliberation, the jury found Hodge guilty. Seven of the twelve jurors recommended him for mercy but he was sentenced to death.<br>
<br>During the week that followed Elliot, fearing public disturbance, declared martial law, called out the militia, and asked the captain of the naval ship that had brought him to Tortola to have sailors and marines ready to land and restore order if need be, since he feared that the members of the militia, composed of white men and &#145;free persons of colour&#146;, once they had arms in their hands, might be provoked by this controversial case to turn them against one another. Hodge was hanged on 8 May 1811 and buried the same day at Road Town, Tortola. There was no public disturbance, martial law was ended, and the militia disbanded. Hodge's execution, the first of its kind in the British West Indies, was a public warning to slave owners that murdering a slave could be a capital crime.<br>
