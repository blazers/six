<span class="headword">Mason,  Charles</span>  (1728&#150;1786), <span class="occ">astronomer and mathematician</span>, was born early in 1728 at Wherr in the parish of Bisley, near Stroud, Gloucestershire, the third child of Charles Mason, a baker, and his first wife, Ann, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Damsel, and was baptized in Sapperton church on 1 May 1728. Details of his early life and education are lacking, but it seems likely that between 1730 and 1750 he had the help of Robert Stratford, a schoolmaster and mathematician of Sapperton, to give him the necessary mathematical skills to be appointed&#151;in 1756 at the age of twenty-eight&#151;to the Royal Greenwich Observatory as assistant to the astronomer royal, James Bradley, who had been born in Gloucestershire and whose wife, Susannah Peach, came from Chalford, near Sapperton. At a meagre &pound;26 a year Mason was able to acquire the skills of observational astronomy; his recorded observations at Greenwich span the period between October 1756 and November 1760. But his mathematical ability was also much appreciated by Bradley, particularly in helping to assess the accuracy of Tobias Mayer's solar and lunar tables submitted to the board of longitude in 1757&#151;with which Mason was to be much concerned later in his career. His first wife, Rebekah, died at Greenwich on 13 February 1759, leaving two sons, William and Isaac.<br>
<br>In 1760, on Bradley's recommendation, the Royal Society chose Mason to go to Sumatra to observe the 1761 transit of Venus, assisted by Jeremiah Dixon. An encounter with a French frigate delayed their final sailing, and as they could not reach Sumatra in time they landed at the Cape of Good Hope, from where they successfully observed the transit on 6 June 1761. On the passage home they landed at St Helena and, after discussion with Nevil Maskelyne (whose observation of the transit had been thwarted by clouds), Dixon returned temporarily to the Cape with Maskelyne's clock to carry out gravity experiments, while Mason assisted Maskelyne with astronomical and tidal observations at St Helena. Mason and Dixon eventually reached England early in 1762.<br>
<br>In August 1763 Mason and Dixon signed an agreement with Thomas Penn and Frederick Calvert, Lord Baltimore, hereditary proprietors of the provinces of Pennsylvania and Maryland, to help local surveyors define the disputed boundary between the two provinces. After arriving in Philadelphia with their instruments in November, they began operations the following month at the north-east corner of Maryland. Proceeding along the parallel of 39&deg;43'17".6 N, they surveyed and marked the boundary for 244 miles; hostile Indians prevented the survey of the last 36 miles. When late in 1766 work for the proprietors was completed on what was to become the famous Mason&#150;Dixon line&#151;popularly regarded as the boundary between the northern and southern states&#151;they began, on the Royal Society's behalf, to measure a degree of latitude on the Delmarva peninsula in Maryland and to make gravity measurements with the clock sent out by the society, the same that Maskelyne had had in St Helena and Dixon had taken to the Cape in 1761. Having completed their task on 21 June 1768, they sailed for England on 11 September. Before leaving, both were admitted as corresponding members of the American Society for Promoting Useful Knowledge, in Philadelphia.<br>
<br>In December 1768 Mason was appointed to be one of the Royal Society's observers of the second transit of Venus, which he successfully observed on 3 June 1769 at Cavan, near Strabane, in northern Ireland; in July 1773 he was appointed by the Royal Society to make a tour of Scotland to find a mountain suitable for experiments to &#145;weigh the earth&#146; by measuring the deflection of a plumb line by the gravitational attraction of the mountain. He recommended Schiehallion in Perthshire as a suitable site for the experiment and was immediately offered the task of leading the expedition for doing this. However, he declined, nominally on financial grounds, though perhaps, after South Africa, America, and Ireland, fieldwork no longer appealed to him. He retired to Gloucestershire to look after his growing family, having married his second wife, Mary, about 1770.<br>
<br>Meanwhile Mason had been commissioned by the board of longitude to complete the computation of Bradley's Greenwich observations, which resulted in the publication in 1771 of a catalogue of the places of 387 stars in the <span class="italic">Nautical Almanac</span> for 1773. Secondly, he was commissioned to improve Mason's solar and lunar tables, which had been used by the computers of the annual <span class="italic">Nautical Almanac</span> since its first publication in 1767. He presented his first results in November 1772, then improved tables in November 1777, and again in March 1781. They were used immediately for computing the <span class="italic">Nautical Almanac</span> and were published in 1787. For the first set of tables Mason received &pound;417 10<i>s</i>.; for the last he asked originally for &pound;5000 but had to be content with &pound;800. In 1786 he emigrated to America with his wife, seven sons, and a daughter. Having been taken ill while on passage, he died at the George tavern, on the corner of Arch and Second, Philadelphia, on 25 October 1786. He was buried at Christ Church burial-ground, Philadelphia. In 1793 his widow presented to the board of longitude various papers concerning the lunar tables, for which she received an additional &pound;200 reward.<br>
<br>Mason should not be confused with the Revd Charles Mason FRS (1699?&#150;1771), Woodwardian lecturer in the University of Cambridge.<br>
