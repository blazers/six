<span class="headword">Blacking,  John Anthony Randoll</span>  (1928&#150;1990), <span class="occ">social anthropologist and ethnomusicologist</span>, was born on 22 October 1928 in Guildford, Surrey, the elder child and only son of William Henry Randoll Blacking, ecclesiastical architect, and his wife, (Josephine) Margaret Newcombe Waymouth. The family moved to 21 The Close, Salisbury, in 1930. Blacking attended Salisbury Cathedral school (1934&#150;42) where, as a chorister and pianist, he showed early musical promise. Attendance at Sherborne School, Dorset (1942&#150;7), was followed by a commission in the Coldstream Guards and active service in Malaya (1947&#150;9). The plight of the aboriginal peoples caught up in the conflict moved him deeply, and on his release from national service he went to King's College, Cambridge, to read archaeology and anthropology. While there, he was active in artistic life as a pianist and actor, and as a performer and promoter of contemporary music. He obtained second classes (division one in part one and division two in part two) in his tripos (1952 and 1953).<br>
<br>Blacking began to use his musical and anthropological talents in a variety of ways. For a time he considered becoming a professional pianist, he worked as a social worker in the East End of London, and he spent a summer studying ethnomusicology in Paris. In October 1953 he was invited by the Colonial Office to return to Malaya as assistant adviser on aboriginal peoples, which he did, only then to learn that his role was to provide the intelligence that would enable the forced removal of the forest peoples, all of whom were apparently suspected of being (or harbouring) terrorists. He refused, resigning after only six days.<br>
<br>Blacking took a post as a musicologist at the International Library of African Music at Roodepoort, near Johannesburg, South Africa, in 1954. In this capacity he carried out field studies in Zululand and Mozambique, and among the Venda and Gwembe Tonga peoples. In 1955 he married Brenda Eleonora, daughter of Herman Wilhelm Friedrich Gebers, a farmer. They had a son and four daughters, two of whom died in childhood (1956 and 1963). In 1959 Blacking took up a lectureship in social anthropology and African government at the University of Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, becoming professor and head of the department in 1965. Witwatersrand awarded him a PhD in 1965 and a DLitt in 1972. His principal publications during this period included (as editor) <span class="italic">Black Background: the Childhood of a South African Girl</span> (1964) and (as author) <span class="italic">Venda Children's Songs: a Study in Ethnomusicological Analysis</span> (1967). A man of forceful personality and an enthusiastic evangelist in promoting understanding between people, and between people and the institutions they create, Blacking set up courses in African music and Asian studies, and took an increasingly outspoken role in anti-apartheid politics, which eventually led him to clash with the authorities. He was prosecuted under the notorious <span class="roman">Immorality Act</span>, which forbade sexual relations between people of different colours.<br>
<br>In 1969 Blacking left South Africa with Zureena Rukshana Desai, a medical doctor, with whom he was later to have four daughters. She was the daughter of Suliman Mohamed Desai, a company director. After his divorce in 1975, he and Zureena were married in 1978. Offered a choice of chairs in Britain and the United States, he chose, after a short spell as professor of anthropology at Western Michigan University, Kalamazoo, to take up in 1970 the first appointment to the chair of social anthropology at the Queen's University of Belfast. This was at the very height of the &#145;troubles&#146; in Northern Ireland, in which he saw many parallels with Malaya and South Africa. It was with a sense of mission that he guided the department from modest beginnings in 1970 to become one of the largest in the British Isles and an internationally recognized centre of ethnomusicology. His most influential book, <span class="italic">How Musical is Man?</span> (1974), stressed the importance of identifying the structural relationships between patterns of musical organization and those of social life. It argued that the human potential for musical creativity had been stifled in the West by an &eacute;litist conception of musical ability, whereas in pre-industrial societies everyone was an active musician. The book was soon published in paperback and was translated into several languages. It brought students of ethnomusicology to Belfast from all over the world.<br>
<br>Blacking was a handsome man, tall and fair with clear blue eyes and the lean, broad-shouldered frame of a rugby player. He frequently wore his regiment of guards tie, which gave him a rather formal and military air that contrasted with the rebellious and iconoclastic things he often said. His impact upon an audience was both physical and intellectual. A gifted lecturer, always at his best playing to an audience, he could, and did, teach anything in the syllabus with authority and flair. He served in various capacities on the committees of the International Folk Music Council, the Royal Anthropological Institute, the Social Science Research Council, the Council for National Academic Awards, and the British Council, and gave dozens of guest lectures and addresses, but yet still found the time to do voluntary work for homeless, handicapped, and unemployed people as a council member in local charitable organizations. He regularly gave solo piano recitals at the university's lunchtime concerts. A man of great verve, wide interests, and an abiding belief in the creative genius of all humanity, he was constantly active. He believed that human beings were inherently musical and that music was an important means of communication across cultural boundaries.<br>
<br>In 1984 Blacking was elected to the Royal Irish Academy. He was awarded the Rivers memorial medal of the Royal Anthropological Institute (1986) and the Koizumi Fumio prize in Tokyo (1989). His last works included a six-part series, <span class="italic">Dancing</span>, for Independent Television, and a book on the ethnomusicological work of the Australian composer Percy Grainger, <span class="italic">A Commonsense View of All Music</span> (1987). Blacking died of cancer in Belfast on 24 January 1990. A posthumous collection of his essays on ethnomusicology, together with an extended biographical introduction and a full list of his works, was published in 1995.<br>
