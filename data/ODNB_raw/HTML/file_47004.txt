<span class="headword">Forwood, Sir  William  Bower</span>  (1840&#150;1928), <span class="occ">merchant and politician</span>, was born on 21 January 1840 in Edge Hill, Liverpool, the second son of Thomas Brittain Forwood (1810&#150;1884), Liverpool merchant, and Charlotte (<i>d</i>. 1861), daughter of William Bower, Liverpool cotton broker. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/38693/', "Arthur Forwood")</script> was his brother.<br>
<br>Thomas Forwood was senior partner in Leech, Harrison, and Forwood, and was also a notable civic figure: he was vice-president of the Liverpool chamber of commerce, a long-serving member of the dock board, a Cheshire magistrate, and involved in the restoration of Chester Cathedral. His eldest sons, Arthur and William, continued and widened these concerns. William was educated at Liverpool Collegiate, and at Dr Heldenmier's Pestalozzian school in Worksop. After leaving school he temporarily joined the cotton brokers, Salisbury, Turner, and Earle. In late 1857 his father sent him on a voyage around the world, and before he was eighteen he had visited the Australian goldfields, learned to helm and navigate an ocean-going ship, and gone aloft to break out frozen sails south of Cape Horn.<br>
<br>William Forwood entered the family business in late 1859. Almost immediately the American Civil War disrupted the cotton trade. Thomas Forwood retired in 1862, leaving Arthur and William in charge. They rapidly made their fortunes, first from wartime speculation and blockade running, and then from exploiting telegraph and cotton futures. William Forwood had a keen analytical mind&#151;he was elected president of the Liverpool Philomathic Society in 1868 and fellow of the Statistical Society in 1871&#151;and he later claimed that the firm had adjusted more quickly than most. He wrote in his autobiography (almost certainly exaggerating) that &#145;Futures trading &hellip; was very profitable, and for some time we had it all to ourselves&#146;  (Forwood, <span class="italic">Recollections</span>, 74).<br>
<br>The firm established branches in New York, New Orleans, and Bombay. Forwood visited the southern United States regularly, but his major contribution was in Liverpool. The new methods progressively reduced commissions and set merchants against brokers. Forwood had already served as president of the American chamber of commerce (in 1872) and of the Liverpool chamber of commerce (in 1871 and 1878&#150;81). He claimed that in 1877 he brought the merchants and brokers together, and became &#145;President of the United Cotton Association, the promoters of the Liverpool Cotton Association&#146;  (Forwood, <span class="italic">Incidents</span>, 3). The Cotton Association managed the Liverpool cotton exchange, which became one of the world's leading commodity markets. While Forwood's narrative does not match Thomas Ellison's detailed contemporary account of the formation of the association in 1882, it is likely that, as mayor of Liverpool in 1880&#150;81, he did play some important mediating role.<br>
<br>The Forwood brothers also became shipowners, against strong competition successfully running a small fleet to the West Indies, Costa Rica, and New York. By the early 1880s both were rich men, and they reduced their business interests. Leech, Harrison, and Forwood continued as general merchants into the next century. The Forwoods' shipping line was absorbed by the Royal Mail Steam Packet Company in 1908. Arthur Forwood became an MP in 1885 and quickly gained national as well as local influence. William Forwood, on the other hand, despite retiring from trade in 1890, specialized in civic affairs and retained important business interests. He organized the Liverpool docks' overhead railway in 1887&#151;the first electric railway in the world. He served as a director of Cunard from 1888 to 1923, and as its deputy chairman from 1906 to 1909&#151;when the <i>Lusitania</i> and <i>Mauretania</i> were built; he was also director of the Bank of Liverpool from 1887 to 1928, and its chairman from 1898 to 1901.<br>
<br>William Forwood had demonstrated political flair as a sixteen-year-old by collecting 60,000 signatures in support of Wavertree Park. He was elected to the city council in 1868 and served for more than forty years. His main interests were the watch committee and the libraries' committee&#151;he persuaded Andrew Carnegie to give &pound;50,000 to build new libraries. He was knighted in 1883 for his mayoral work in opposing the Fenians. As a leading Liverpool Conservative he successfully managed the election campaign against W. E. Gladstone, in 1868, and he persuaded George Nathaniel Curzon to stand for parliament in 1883. He represented Liverpool's commercial interests against the Lancashire railway companies in 1872&#150;3, and against the Manchester Ship Canal in 1883&#150;5. He served on the royal commission on motor cars in 1905, advocating tight speed-limits. His last important service, in 1921, was to win over the Liverpool chamber of commerce, and the public generally, to the concept of a Mersey road tunnel.<br>
<br>Forwood also sat on the Liverpool borough bench from 1873 to 1925 and was JP for Lancashire from 1882. As a magistrate he attempted to moderate Liverpool's notorious alcoholism by sensible licensing. He became deputy lieutenant for Lancashire in 1902, and high sheriff in 1905. He was invited to stand for several Lancashire constituencies, &#145;but always considered my native city had the first claim on me&#146;  (Forwood, <span class="italic">Incidents</span>, 16). Elected an honorary freeman of the city in 1902, Forwood was created KBE in 1917. His Conservatism included sympathy for social problems and labour, and he was proud that when he retired Liverpool was no longer &#145;the black spot on the Mersey&#146; that he had observed in 1860. He refused to support Chamberlain on imperial protection, but in 1920 he denounced the Labour Party for ignoring economic realities.<br>
<br>Forwood married in 1862 Mary Miles Moss, only daughter of William Miles Moss, a Liverpool shipowner; they had three sons and seven daughters. After Mary died in the mid-1890s, he married in 1898 Elizabeth, daughter of General le Fleming of Rydal House. Forwood was a great traveller, visiting North and Central America many times. In 1861 he was arrested in New York city, suspected of carrying money and dispatches to the Confederacy. After his release Abraham Lincoln offered to meet him, an invitation he rejected. Forty years later he did finally dine at the White House, after which President Theodore Roosevelt insisted on a bout of ju-jitsu. He also met and negotiated railroad contracts with President Diaz of Mexico. At home he was an active canoeist, gardener, and yachtsman. He became commodore of the Mersey and Windermere yacht clubs, and was a co-founder of the Yacht Racing Association. He claimed that he was never happier than at the Windermere regattas.<br>
<br>A committed Anglican, Sir William was chairman of the committee which financed and built Liverpool Cathedral. Bishop Chavasse wrote to him, &#145;You are really the Father of the Cathedral. &hellip; If it had not been for your wonderful energy and enthusiasm &hellip; the Cathedral would never have been built&#146;  (Forwood, <span class="italic">Incidents</span>, 14). In 1925 Forwood published a survey of the cathedral, entitled <span class="italic">The Liverpool Cathedral: the Story of its Foundation, 1850&#150;1914</span>.<br>
<br>Forwood documented his views and experiences in a number of works. He kept a journal of his voyage on the <i>Red Jacket</i> to Australia. Although he was too busy to write during his early years in business and politics, he presented lengthy written and oral evidence in the debates about water, railways, and the Manchester Ship Canal. In the 1890s and early 1900s he wrote pamphlets on art, technical education, and free trade. In 1912 he was lucky to survive a severe fall, which dislocated his back. Thereafter he had to wear a steel corset and rest much of the time, but he continued writing, including pamphlets on the war effort and the Mersey Tunnel as well as his autobiographical <span class="italic">Reminiscences of a Liverpool Shipowner, 1850&#150;1920</span> (1920).<br>
<br>Sir William Forwood died after a short illness on 23 March 1928 at Reids Palace Hotel, Funchal, Madeira. He was buried in Windermere cemetery. His obituaries emphasized his positive, optimistic, and helpful contribution to Liverpool.<br>
