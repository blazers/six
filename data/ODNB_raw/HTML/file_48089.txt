<span class="headword">Oldroyd, Sir  Mark</span>  (1843&#150;1927), <span class="occ">woollen manufacturer and politician</span>, was born on 30 May 1843 at Spinkwell, Dewsbury, Yorkshire, the youngest of the three sons and two daughters of Mark Oldroyd (1797&#150;1874) and his wife, Rachel, the daughter of Marmaduke Fox, of Soothill, Dewsbury. He was educated, to the age of thirteen, in the small local school in Dewsbury of Jesse Smith, then at Batley grammar school, and lastly at New College, St John's Wood, London, a theological college for Congregationalists, where he trained for the ministry. But his religious vocation was not pursued and he returned to Dewsbury in 1862 to enter the family woollen firm.<br>
<br>The family firm had been established by Oldroyd's father in 1818, after he moved from Hanging Heaton, near Dewsbury, and relinquished his interest in an early local joint-stock company woollen mill. Mark senior was joined in the business by his eldest son, George, and his second son, John, establishing the name of the firm as M. Oldroyd &amp; Sons. The father retired in 1859, leaving the running of the business to George and John, who agreed in 1862 to their father's request to admit Mark junior. As was common at the time, the new junior member of the firm received experience in the various departments of the business. John, however, remained firmly in control of the enterprise, providing the main business mind and taking responsibility for formulating policy. Mark Oldroyd married Maria Tew Mewburn, the daughter of William Mewburn of Wykham Park, Banbury, but previously of Halifax, in 1871. They lived at Hyrstlands in Batley. There were no children.<br>
<br>In 1874 the firm became one of the earliest in the woollen industry to be formed into a limited liability company. By that date George had retired and John and Mark carried on the business as life directors, within the articles of association of the company. The company was floated with a capital of &pound;750,000 in &pound;10 shares, and it amalgamated with the blanket-making business of Blakeley and Latta of Hunslet Mills, Leeds, with which it had previously had a co-partnership.<br>
<br>In 1877 John Oldroyd got into serious personal financial difficulties and was forced to relinquish his connection with the firm. Mark Oldroyd was left with the responsibility of rebuilding and managing the family business. This he did with rapid and great success, creating one of the major enterprises of the British woollen industry in the late nineteenth century. It was a giant in an industry where firms were typically very small. By the 1880s the business had a blanket works near Leeds which could make 1000 pairs of blankets a day, and four large factories in Dewsbury with a peak output of 7000 to 8000 yards of heavy broadcloth a day. By 1888 the business employed over 2000 workers on 18 acres of mill floor space and had substantial interests in two collieries at Castleford, which supplied coal for the textile works.<br>
<br>In the closing decades of the nineteenth century the British woollen industry was holding its own against competition from the continental powers. Its ability to do so was largely the result of its skill in the use of raw materials, particularly the incorporation of shoddy and mungo (wool recovered from rags) in new cloth. Shoddy provided a cheap and effective raw material for the Yorkshire woollen industry, allowing costs and prices to be kept low and products to be adapted rapidly to price fluctuations. Oldroyd had a central role in this trade, not through any major technical contribution, but through the scale of his enterprise and its significance within the local economy of the Dewsbury district. He had a reputation as an independent businessman of high moral standards who paid attention to the well-being of his workforce and recognized its value to the business. He was reputed to have paid above average wages and to have maintained a very loyal and reliable labour force. He was described as being a solitary, aloof, and rather brusque figure. However, many contemporary reports indicate particular respect for him among his workforce and within the neighbourhood. His legacy to the industry and the local community was more significant than that of many of his peers. He championed the cause of woollen manufacture in national debate on industrial and commercial matters, providing evidence to the royal commission on depression of trade and industry in 1886, serving the local chamber of commerce, and acting as president of the Heavy Woollen District Manufacturers' Association from its inception in 1912 until his retirement in 1920. He extolled free trade as a major supporter of the West Riding Free Trade Federation.<br>
<br>Oldroyd was associated with the Congregational church throughout his life. For sixty-three years he was a member of the United Congregational Church in Dewsbury, and he became its senior deacon. On occasions he addressed the annual meeting of the Congregational Union of England and Wales. He supported missionary work and many local charities, including the local Guild of Help and the Dewsbury Day Nursery. In 1919 he donated &pound;10,000 towards the establishment of a children's ward at Dewsbury and District Infirmary. He remained a staunch advocate of temperance and of personal and religious freedom. His political commitment was as a stalwart Liberal, of the Gladstonian persuasion, and from 1868 he was active in the local Liberal Party organization. He served Dewsbury as a councillor, alderman, and mayor and was the first chairman of the Non-County Boroughs Association. He was made the first honorary freeman of Dewsbury in 1919. As the member of parliament for the Dewsbury constituency for thirteen years (from the by-election of 1888) he spoke infrequently in the House of Commons, but had an active involvement in committees concerned with trade and factory legislation. He was knighted in 1909.<br>
<br>Oldroyd's local and national commitments gradually diverted his energies away from the day-to-day management of the woollen business, which was left to the other directors, but he remained firmly in control of the policy of the firm until his retirement. He resigned his life directorship in 1913, but continued as chairman until 1920. His wife died in 1919, and the following year he married Annie Jane, the daughter of a Gainsborough merchant, Richard Pattison; she died in 1926. Oldroyd died suddenly from a seizure on 5 July 1927 at the home in Goathland, Yorkshire, to which he had retired. He was buried in Batley on 8 July. His surprisingly small estate of &pound;93,124 was left mainly for the benefit of the workpeople, past, present, and future, of his firm.<br>
