<span class="headword">Ward, Sir  Lancelot Edward  Barrington-</span>  (1884&#150;1953), <span class="occ">surgeon</span>, was born at Worcester on 4 July 1884, the second son of Mark James Barrington-Ward (<i>d</i>. 1924) and his wife, Caroline Pearson; the father was an inspector of schools, and later became rector of Duloe in Cornwall and an honorary canon of Truro Cathedral. Barrington-Ward's four brothers all distinguished themselves in their various professions, one of them, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30620/', "R. M. Barrington-Ward")</script>, becoming editor of <span class="italic">The Times</span>. Barrington-Ward entered Westminster School as a classical scholar, but became unwell and was transferred to Bromsgrove in his native county, where he was restored to health. He gained a classical exhibition at Worcester College, Oxford, but decided on medicine as a career and entered Edinburgh University, where he qualified in 1908. Also captain of the university rugby fifteen, he was awarded four English international caps and played against Wales in the first international match played on the new ground at Twickenham.<br>
<br>Barrington-Ward passed the Edinburgh fellowship examination in 1910 and the English fellowship two years later, after studying at the Middlesex Hospital in London. In 1913 he returned to Edinburgh to obtain the degree of ChM and was awarded the Chiene medal for outstanding ability. His London career in surgery began with his appointment in 1910 as a resident at the Great Ormond Street Hospital for Sick Children, where he assisted two of the leading children's surgeons of the day&#151;George E. Waugh and Thomas Fairbank. He continued his work at this hospital as medical superintendent, and was appointed to the consulting staff in 1914. Immediately after the outbreak of war later that year he volunteered to go to the Balkans as surgeon-in-chief of no. 2 Serbian Relief Fund Hospital, with the honorary rank of lieutenant-colonel. He was awarded the grand cross of the Norwegian order of St Olave and the Serbian order of St Sava.<br>
<br>While still a young man Barrington-Ward's skill as a surgeon was widely recognized. He was much sought after by private patients and operated on several members of the royal family. In 1935 he was appointed KCVO and two years later he was made surgeon to the king's household. In 1952 he was invited to become an extra-surgeon to the queen.<br>
<br>Barrington-Ward's experience in children's surgery is recorded in numerous articles which he published in various journals, and in a standard textbook entitled <span class="italic">Abdominal Surgery of Children</span> (1928). In addition to his work at Great Ormond Street, he was also on the staff of the Wood Green and Royal Northern hospitals. At the last of these he eventually became senior surgeon. He suggested to his colleagues there that they produce a textbook of operative surgery in which the various members of staff dealt with their own specialities; under his editorship <span class="italic">Royal Northern Operative Surgery</span> was published in 1939. As a surgeon, his success was not only due to his clinical judgement and technical skill; he was also gentle and sympathetic and had the enviable knack of obtaining the confidence of children who were his patients. In the operating theatre he showed punctilious courtesy to all the staff including the most junior nurse.<br>
<br>Barrington-Ward was twice married: first in 1917 to Dorothy Anne, second daughter of T. W. Miles, of Caragh, co. Kerry; she did much charitable work for the hospitals with which her husband was connected and also for the Peter Pan League. She died in 1935, leaving three daughters. In 1941 Barrington-Ward married Catherine Wilhelmina, only daughter of E. G. Reuter, of Harrogate; they had one son.<br>
<br>Barrington-Ward enjoyed welcoming his friends to his country home, Hawkedon House, Hawkedon, near Bury St Edmunds. He was knowledgeable enough about agriculture to be elected president of the Suffolk Agricultural Association. Unfortunately he did not have the chance to enjoy retirement, for despite undergoing drastic surgery he died at his home on 17 November 1953.<br>
