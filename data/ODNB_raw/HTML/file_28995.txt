<span class="headword">Wellbeloved,  Charles</span>  (1769&#150;1858), <span class="occ">Unitarian minister and tutor</span>, was born on 6 April 1769 in Denmark Street, St Giles, London, the only child of John Wellbeloved (1742&#150;1787) and his wife, Elizabeth (<i>b</i>. 1747), daughter of Thomas Plaw. Owing to his parents' unhappy marriage he was brought up from the age of four by his grandfather Charles Wellbeloved (1713&#150;1782), friend of John Wesley, who had an estate at Mortlake, Surrey. He was educated principally by the Revd Robert Delafosse of Richmond. Placed with a firm of drapers on Holborn Hill, Wellbeloved found the experience &#145;utterly uncongenial&#146;, claiming he only learned &#145;how to tie up a parcel&#146;  (Kenrick, 5). In 1785 he entered the orthodox Homerton Academy, but, influenced by two of the students, David Jones (1765&#150;1816) and David Jardine (<i>d</i>. 1797), his opinions became heterodox. In September 1787 he entered New College, Hackney, recently established by rational dissenters. In January 1792 he accepted an invitation from Newcome Cappe to become his assistant at St Saviourgate Chapel, York, though the salary was only &pound;60. All the duties were undertaken by Wellbeloved as Cappe had suffered a paralytic stroke. On Cappe's death in 1800 he became sole minister, continuing until his death, though with the help of assistants from 1845. Because of ill health he did not officiate after 1853. Wellbeloved married Ann (<i>d</i>. 1823), eldest daughter of John Kinder, a linen draper in Cheapside, London, on 1 July 1793, at St Mary's, Stoke Newington. They had four sons and five daughters, including three sets of mixed twins. Two daughters married Unitarian ministers, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15414/', "John Kenrick (1788&#150;1877)")</script> and J. R. Wreford; the youngest, Emma (<i>d</i>. 1842), married Sir James Carter, later chief justice of New Brunswick (1815&#150;65).<br>
<br>Because of his small salary, his growing family, and some initial discouragement as a minister, Wellbeloved for some years remained unsettled at York. About 1795 he began his own school; in 1796 it was reported that he had thirteen day pupils at &pound;15 p.a. each. In November 1797 he was invited to succeed Thomas Barnes (1747&#150;1810) as divinity tutor at the dissenters' academy in Manchester, but he declined, discouraged by the financial state of the institution and the coldness of Barnes, an Arian, who was unwilling to see a Unitarian successor. When in 1803 the invitation was renewed Wellbeloved accepted, and Manchester College moved to York. He received much valuable support from Cappe's widow, Catherine (1744&#150;1821), and William Wood (1745&#150;1808), minister at Mill Hill, Leeds. During the early years the chronic financial difficulties persisted, and, assisted only by a classics tutor, Wellbeloved was grossly overworked. He was noted for his methodical allocation of time and habit of rising early. Nevertheless, a former student, Joseph Hunter, privately believed that &#145;There was always something too much of a procrastinating spirit in Mr Wellbeloved, &amp; of the representing himself as having too much business on his hands&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 36527, fol. 50<i>r</i>). He was seriously ill through stress and exhaustion in 1807 and 1809. Gradually there were sufficient benefactions and subscriptions for a third tutor. William Turner (1788&#150;1853) was appointed mathematics tutor in 1809, and was succeeded in 1827 by William Hincks. From 1810 Wellbeloved had the invaluable co-operation of John Kenrick as classics tutor.<br>
<br>Wellbeloved substituted biblical exegesis for systematic theology. By carefully reading the whole of the <span class="roman">Old</span> and <span class="roman">New</span> testaments with his students, Wellbeloved sought to encourage them to develop their own views. He scrupulously avoided teaching any particular system of doctrine, or indeed openly expressing his own theological opinions, though it did leave some students &#145;in a painful state of doubt &hellip; without definite conceptions of the system of Christian truth&#146;  (Kenrick, 102). He also rarely introduced controversial subjects into his pulpit. His approach angered those who wanted a clearer identification of the college with Unitarianism. Doubts concerning his commitment were not finally resolved until his brilliant defence of Unitarianism against Archdeacon Francis Wrangham in 1823 and 1824. Sydney Smith wrote: &#145;If I had a cause to gain I would fee Mr Wellbeloved to plead for me, and double fee Mr Wrangham to plead against me&#146;  (ibid., 152). He closely followed the theological system of Newcome Cappe, particularly in his treatment of prophecy. James Martineau, a student at York, recalled the depth of Wellbeloved's scholarship: &#145;a Lightfoot, a Jeremiah Jones and an Eichhorn all in one, yet no mere theologian after all, but scarcely less a naturalist and an archaeologist as well&#146;  (J. Martineau, <span class="italic">Essays, Reviews and Addresses</span>, 1890&#150;91, 4.54). Wellbeloved was fluent in Greek and Latin, proficient in Hebrew, Syriac, and Chaldee, and read Arabic; he could also read French and Italian, and understand German. He was responsible for the theological and metaphysical section of the short-lived <span class="italic">Annual Review</span> (1802&#150;8). His principal work was a revised translation of the <span class="roman">Bible</span> for families: the undertaking proved too great for Wellbeloved and only nine parts of the <span class="roman">Old Testament</span> were published during his life, the first in 1819 and the last at his own expense in 1838. After his death the text was revised by John Kenrick and republished in three volumes in <span class="italic">Holy Scriptures of the Old Covenant</span> (1859&#150;62), with translations of the remaining books of the <span class="roman">Old Testament</span>. Wellbeloved's most popular work was his <span class="italic">Devotional Exercises for Young Persons</span> (1801), which reached an eighth edition in 1838. He retired as theology tutor in 1840, when the college returned to Manchester.<br>
<br>For nearly seventy years Wellbeloved was actively concerned in all the major reform and social movements in York. In 1813 he helped expose the shameful abuses of the York Lunatic Asylum. He was one of the founders of the York Book Society (1794), subsequently the Subscription Library, the York Mechanics' Institute (1827), the York Whig Club (1827), and the School of Art (1842), and although not among the original promoters of the Yorkshire Philosophical Society (1822), he was curator of antiquities from 1823 until his death. He was largely responsible for the interpretation and preservation of York's historic past. In 1981 his <span class="italic">Eburacum</span> was described as &#145;a valuable scholarly summary epitomising the breadth of learning, systematic method and practical approach of Victorian antiquarianism at its best&#146;  (Addyman, 58). In 1829 he headed the subscription list for the restoration of York Minster following the devastating fire, and led the opposition to the proposals to alter the position of the undamaged choir screen. He also supported the preservation of the city walls. He died on 29 August 1858 at Monkgate, York. He was buried in the graveyard behind the St Saviourgate Chapel on 3 September. His reputation rested on his work as principal of Manchester College, but as a reformer and scholar he also made an important contribution to nineteenth-century York.<br>
