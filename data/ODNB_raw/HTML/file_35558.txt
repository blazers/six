<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Pollen,  John Hungerford</span>  (1820&#150;1902), <span class="occ">decorative artist and Roman Catholic convert</span>, was born at 6 New Burlington Street, London, on 19 November 1820. He was the second son of Richard Pollen (1786&#150;1838), a gentleman of Rodbourne, Wiltshire, and his wife, Anne Cockerell (1784&#150;1865), whose brother was Charles Robert Cockerell, architect of the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford. Another uncle was John Walter Pollen, second baronet, of Rendenham, Hampshire. Pollen was educated at Durham House, Chelsea (1829&#150;33), and at Eton College (1833&#150;8). In 1838 he matriculated at Christ Church, Oxford. After taking his BA he became a fellow of Merton College in 1842. He then spent a year travelling in the Middle East with his elder brother, Hungerford.<br>
<br>Pollen returned to England in September 1844, and was ordained deacon in Oxford on Trinity Sunday 1845. He became curate of St Peter-le-Bailey, Oxford (dem. 1872), where he first tried his hand at large-scale design, with his decorative scheme for the ceiling of the church, which he carried out in 1844.<br>
<br>Although buffeted by the Tractarian debates at this time, he was ordained priest by the bishop of Oxford, Dr Samuel Wilberforce, in June 1846. In the summer of 1847 Pollen travelled to France with two Oxford friends, the Revd Thomas William Allies and John Wynne, in order to discover how the Roman Catholic church succeeded in bringing faith and hope to the poorest parts of the community. They then moved on to Italy and Germany, where Pollen had an opportunity to study the ancient churches of Ravenna, and the newly built basilica of St Boniface in Munich. He was to adapt this architectural style to his own purposes in the 1850s and 1860s.<br>
<br>On his return to Oxford, Pollen worked closely with Dr Pusey and Charles Marriot with the aim of reinvigorating the Church of England, by offering sacramental religion and practical support to &#145;the multitude in the depth of the abyss&#146;  (A. Pollen, 63). In 1847 he agreed to act as pro-vicar during an interregnum at St Saviour's Church, Leeds, a Puseyite foundation. During this time, he also maintained his fellowship at Merton, serving at various times as dean, bursar, and garden master. The church in Leeds had recently been accused of Romanism after a disagreement with the bishop of Ripon over the use of intercessory prayer to the saints. This led to the three curates converting to Roman Catholicism, and the vicar, Richard Ward, was forced to resign. Pollen responded enthusiastically to the challenge. He encouraged the community of celibate clergy who lived and worked together in the parish, and this collegiate life proved particularly valuable during the cholera outbreak of 1849.<br>
<br>Although Pollen was offered several comfortable livings at this time, he felt unable to accept them, and instead threw his energy into another artistic scheme, by painting the ceiling of Merton College chapel. His design included minstrel angels, prophets, and church fathers, based on portraits of his family and friends. His depiction of Pope Gregory the Great was criticized by the anti-Tractarian warden, Robert Bullock Marsham (<i>d</i>. 1880), but the work was generally well received. Additional decorations made in 1877 were whitewashed in the 1960s and the drawing of the figures now appears rather clumsy. Pollen always seemed to have difficulty in translating the artistic talents shown in his spirited watercolour sketches into larger-scale paintings.<br>
<br>This artistic interlude could not distract Pollen indefinitely from the theological difficulties that he had to face. The controversial use of auricular confession at St Saviour's meant that on Christmas eve 1850, Pollen and his colleagues were all inhibited from practising their ministry, in Leeds and in Oxford. The other clergy and several members of the congregation seceded to Rome, but Pollen was prepared to argue his case with the bishop of Oxford, and was reinstated. However, by the summer of 1852 he too had decided that he could no longer remain within the Church of England. His reasons were partly explained in his <span class="italic">Narrative of Five Years at St. Saviours</span> (1851), a defence of Catholic practices that he believed should be compatible with the doctrines of the Anglican church. Pollen and many of his friends now found themselves isolated. After a solitary journey around Ireland, he was received into the Roman Catholic church in Rouen on 20 October 1852. He wrote to a friend:<blockquote>Every doubt is at rest, and I have found that kind of calm which one needs repose and reflection to enjoy in full. I cannot tell you how great an advantage I think it to have been able to do this out of England. (A. Pollen, 235)</blockquote>Pollen's conversion meant that he forfeited his fellowship at Merton. He had recently been a popular senior proctor of the university (1851&#150;2). He decided not to be ordained within the Roman church, and therefore had to embark on a new career. During the time he spent in Rome immediately after his conversion, Pollen was introduced to William Thackeray, who described Pollen as &#145;the most interesting man I have met here &hellip; and I try to understand from him what can be the secret of the religion for which he has given up rank, chances and all the good things in life&#146;  (A. Pollen, 246). He also met there the Revd Charles John LaPrimaudaye, who was also a recent convert. In the summer of 1854 Pollen became engaged to his daughter, Maria Margaret (1838&#150;1919), known as Minnie. Born on 10 April 1838 in Leyton, Essex, Minnie was the third child of this Huguenot family. She was seventeen years younger than Pollen, who was now unemployed and recently disinherited by his uncle, but she was apparently charmed by his good looks, intelligence, energy, and liveliness. They were married a year later, in the church of Woodchester monastery, near Stroud, Gloucestershire, on 18 September 1855.<br>
<br>Meanwhile Charles LaPrimaudaye wrote to John Henry Newman on Pollen's behalf, and in November 1854 Pollen was offered the professorship of fine arts at Newman's new university in Dublin. The offer also included Pollen's first architectural commission, to design the university church, St Stephen's Green. Pollen's plan was for a plain basilican structure, decorated internally with coloured Irish marbles and an ornate apse. This Byzantine style was a radical choice at a time when the Gothic dominated new church building, but Newman agreed with Pollen's verdict that &#145;the Pugin school delighted in satiating us with all the weak and mannered features of their Gothic and never attained to a broad appreciation of what was beautiful and noble in itself&#146;  (J. H. Pollen, unpublished letter to John Henry Newman, priv. coll.). The church was consecrated on ascension day, 1 May 1856. That year Pollen's lectures on art were also published in <span class="italic">Atlantis</span>, the university magazine. He also contributed to <span class="italic">The Tablet</span> as an art critic, where he established himself as a supporter of both Turner and Whistler.<br>
<br>In the summer of 1857 Pollen moved to London, living first in Hampstead, and from late 1858 in Bayswater. He became an enthusiastic member of the artistic community, joining the Hogarth Club, a rallying point for the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood. Pollen had met J. E. Millais while working on the ceiling of Merton College chapel and this renewed friendship with members of the brotherhood led to Pollen's involvement in the decoration of the Oxford Union debating chamber. D. G. Rossetti, who co-ordinated the project, believed that Pollen was &#145;the only man who has yet done good mural painting in England&#146;  (<span class="italic">Memoirs &hellip; of Coventry Patmore</span>, 2.328). Unfortunately, Pollen's experience proved inadequate, and the murals quickly degenerated. At the Oxford Union he found himself working alongside the young Edward Burne-Jones, and their friendship continued well into the 1880s. Pollen's daughter Anne is recognizable as the girl in Burne-Jones's oil painting <span class="italic">King Cophetua and the Beggar Maid</span> (1880&#150;84, Tate collection).<br>
<br>Pollen's next artistic challenge was offered by John Ruskin, as his support for Turner's work had attracted the critic's attention. In 1858 Pollen was commissioned to design the carvings for the fa&ccedil;ade of the new University Museum of Natural History in Oxford. He reflected both the contents of the museum and the current evolutionary debates in his design for the tympanum over the main door, which depicted an angel holding both the spiritual book of life and the biological cell. Unfortunately, lack of funds meant that the scheme was only partially carried out. He was awarded several other commissions in the early 1860s, mostly decorative schemes for interiors, which included a library ceiling at Blickling Hall, Aylsham, for William Kerr, eighth marquess of Lothian (1860), and several rooms at Clontra, Dublin (1862). He designed a new Roman Catholic church at Rhyl, north Wales, for his friend John Wynne, which incorporated Celtic revival motifs into the carved altar (1863). Pollen also acquired antique furniture and other decorative objects for his patrons, and his developing knowledge in this area proved useful in a new career that opened up for him. He was one of the jurors for the International Exhibition held in London in 1862, and in December 1863, on the recommendation of Thackeray, he was appointed assistant keeper at the South Kensington Museum. This new position provided some security for his growing family; his sixth child, George, had been born in May 1863, and another four were to arrive before the end of the decade.<br>
<br>Pollen was instrumental in many of the acquisitions for the new museum, travelling across Europe at least twice a year on public and private business. Although many of his attributions have been superseded his catalogues of furniture, sculpture, and metalwork have provided the ground work for all subsequent research. He also taught in the Government School of Design at South Kensington. He served on the juries of international exhibitions in Dublin (1865) and Paris (1867), where the first part of his &#145;Universal catalogue of books on art&#146; was awarded a gold medal.<br>
<br>Despite this professional success, the Pollen family was struggling financially, and in January 1871 Minnie took the five eldest children to live in M&uuml;nster, Westphalia, Germany, where schooling was cheaper and Roman Catholic. In 1872 the younger children also left England to join them. Pollen continued to work in London, and visited his family as often as he could. In the autumn of 1875 they returned to England, and moved to Newbuildings Place in Sussex. Their landlord was Wilfrid Scawen Blunt, a childhood friend of the LaPrimaudaye girls. Elizabeth Longford's biography of Blunt suggests that he and Minnie were involved in a long liaison; however, Blunt's report of this relationship is uncorroborated, although the two families certainly enjoyed unusual intimacy. Relations between the two families broke down irretrievably in 1888 when Blunt's daughter, Judith, accused Pollen's sixth son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37859/', "Arthur Joseph Hungerford Pollen")</script>, of over-familiarity. During the ensuing quarrel, Blunt's wife, Anne, claimed that the Pollen family were conspiring to take advantage of Judith's fortune. The tenancy of Newbuildings had to be given up in 1889.<br>
<br>In the meantime, in 1876 Pollen left his position at the museum. He had been invited to join Lord Ripon's staff as his private secretary. A recent Catholic convert, Ripon succeeded Lord Lytton as viceroy of India in 1880. Pollen remained in London to deal with Ripon's affairs, visiting India only in 1884, during the last few months of the viceroyalty. During his time in India Pollen developed his artistic connections, commissioning exhibits for the forthcoming Indian and Colonial Exhibition of 1886, and advising the maharaja of Kuch Behar on the decoration of his palaces.<br>
<br>In 1889 Pollen was a founder member of the United Arts and Crafts Guild. He continued to accept commissions for interiors and private chapels, and in 1896 was asked to design a mosaic for the nave vault of Westminster Cathedral. The plans were never executed. In the last years of his life, as notary apostolic, he examined the documents supporting the beatification of the Elizabethan English martyrs.<br>
<br>Pollen died suddenly at home, 11 Pembridge Crescent, London, on 2 December 1902, and was buried in the family vault at Kensal Green cemetery. Newman had remarked that &#145;he wears a beard, like other men of genius&#146;  (A. Pollen, 275). He was remembered by his friends as a patient man, with a good ear for music and a gift for mimicry and spontaneous conversation. After his death, Minnie continued to develop their joint interest in antique textiles, lecturing and exhibiting her collection of lace; she published <span class="italic">Seven Centuries of Lace</span> in 1908.<br>
