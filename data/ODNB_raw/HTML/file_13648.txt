<span class="headword">Home,  Robert</span>  (1837&#150;1879), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, born in Antigua, West Indies, on 29 December 1837, was eldest son of Major James Home, who served for some years in the 30th regiment, and afterwards settled in Ireland as a land agent. Robert Home was early thrown on his own resources, and when, for a short time during the Crimean War, commissions in the artillery and engineers were opened to public competition without the necessity of passing through the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, he obtained one in the Royal Engineers, and was commissioned lieutenant on 7 April 1856. After serving at Chatham and in Nova Scotia, in 1858 he was one of the first to join the new Staff College at Sandhurst. After the course there, he was attached at Aldershot to the other three arms of the service successively, to complete his training for the staff. In 1862 he went to Portland, and was employed in the new defences. He married, in February 1864, Anne Josephine, daughter of J. Hunt, a Dublin barrister, who survived him with four sons and two daughters.<br>
<br>After his promotion to captain on 9 December 1864 Home was sent to Canada, where he wrote an able report on the defence of the frontier against invasion, which attracted the attention of the authorities at home. The following year he was appointed to the staff at Aldershot as deputy assistant quartermaster-general. The ability he showed led to further special employment. In 1870 he became secretary of the Royal Engineers committee (a standing scientific committee), and in 1871 he was appointed to the topographical and statistical department of the War Office, which in 1873 developed into the intelligence branch.<br>
<br>In 1873 Home was selected by Garnet Wolseley to be the commanding royal engineer of the Asante expedition, and he became a member of the Wolseley &#145;ring&#146;. In the Second Anglo-Asante War he proved himself capable in the field, his energy and force of character enabling him to overcome manifold difficulties in preparing the way for the march to Kumasi. He used 6000 local labourers to clear a road through 70 miles of bush, build seven way stations, and construct the forward base at Prasu. He received a brevet lieutenant-colonelcy and a CB. On his return he resumed his duties at the intelligence branch, assisting its head, Major-General Sir Patrick MacDougall (deputy adjutant-general for intelligence). Home was able, energetic, and far-sighted, and the 1875 mobilization plan for the army and the &#145;regulations for the organisation of the communications of an army in the field&#146; were his work. He also rendered good service as the secretary and moving spirit of several War Office committees. On 1 April 1876 he succeeded Major Charles Wilson as assistant quartermaster-general of the intelligence branch, the post he retained until his death.<br>
<br>During the Russo-Turkish War, when there was risk of Britain intervening, Home's opinion was frequently sought, and reportedly great weight attached to it in military circles. Towards the end of 1876 he was sent to Turkey to report on the defence of Constantinople. His dispatches gained him a brevet colonelcy, and the knowledge he had acquired of the politico-military situation reportedly made him the trusted adviser of the highest authorities. He was appointed British commissioner for the delimitation of the frontier of the principality of Bulgaria, under article 2 of the treaty of Berlin, on 10 September 1878. He had hardly begun the work when he contracted typhoid and came home.<br>
<br>Home's real work, according to <span class="italic">The Times</span> of 31 January 1879, was known to<blockquote>a comparatively limited circle, but that circle comprised most of those to whose hands the destinies of the empire have been entrusted during the last two administrations. &hellip; most of the statesmen who have been engaged in the difficult work of the last few years attribute no small importance to the assistance derived from Colonel Home's genius and grasp of facts.</blockquote>Home published a small anonymous pamphlet on army administration. His principal work, <span class="italic">A Pr&eacute;cis of Modern Tactics</span> (1873), was when published one of the few English books on the subject, and continued for some years the best, becoming an official textbook. In 1872 he translated Baron Stoffel's <span class="italic">Military Reports</span> and a French work on the &#145;law of recruiting&#146;. He also contributed to the <span class="italic">Quarterly Review</span>, <span class="italic">Macmillan's Magazine</span>, and other periodicals. He was a FRGS and an associate of the Society of Telegraph Engineers. Home died of typhoid at his residence, 21 Regent's Park Terrace, London, on 29 January 1879. A stained-glass memorial window was placed in Rochester Cathedral by public subscription. A civil-list pension of &pound;300 a year was conferred on his widow, in recognition of his services.<br>
