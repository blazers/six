<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Yeats,  William Butler</span>  (1865&#150;1939), <span class="occ">poet</span>, was born on 13 June 1865 at 1 George's Ville, 5 Sandymount Avenue, Dublin, the eldest child of John Butler Yeats (1839&#150;1922) and Susan Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Pollexfen (1841&#150;1900). His father was then still a barrister; shortly he would&#151;to the discomfiture of his wife, and still more of her family&#151;give up the law for the uncertain life of a portrait painter in bohemian London.<h2>
<a name="Backgroundandyouth"></a>Background and youth</h2>The Yeats family was, in Irish parlance &#145;Ascendancy&#146;, but not grand: clergymen, lawyers, Dublin Castle officials rather than landowners, married into a wide cousinage across the Irish protestant world. They were proud of their descent from the great Norman clan of the Butlers, and preserved the name in their christenings, but connections with the ducal Ormond line are tenuous at best. By the 1860s their position in the world had declined. Here as elsewhere W. B. Yeats's life is emblematic of its time, since this process reflects a wider slippage; the newly confident Irish Catholic bourgeoisie were advancing into social and professional redoubts from which they had been excluded by the privileged minority. A reaction to this conditioned the stuffy and self-conscious world of protestant Dublin, against which the young Yeats would chafe just as his father had done.<br>
<br>Yeats's mother's family, the Pollexfens of Sligo, were a different stock: also descended from gentry forebears, but originating in Devon. In the 1830s Yeats's maternal grandfather, William Pollexfen, had joined a branch of the family already settled in Sligo, married a cousin, and with another cousin William Middleton founded a prosperous shipping and milling business (with a profitable sideline in, among other things, wreckage rights). The Pollexfens were business people, property developers, and town councillors&#151;ornaments of that forgotten class, the Irish Victorian bourgeoisie. They reacted with bafflement and hostility to the charming but unreliable John Butler Yeats&#151;a brilliant talker, and eventually a first-rate painter, but cursed with a congenital inability to finish a painting or repay a debt.<br>
<br>W. B. Yeats and his younger surviving siblings&#151;<script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/61425/', "Susan Mary Yeats, called Lily (1866&#150;1949)")</script>, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/59839/', "Elizabeth Corbet Yeats, or Lollie (1868&#150;1940)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/61425/', "Yeats, Susan Mary")</script>], and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37060/', "John, known as Jack, Butler Yeats (1871&#150;1957)")</script>&#151;grew up conscious that their father's way of life was deeply disapproved of in Sligo, where they spent much of their childhood being looked after in the Pollexfen household. They all became distinguished artists in their own fields; and, significantly, they all succeeded by employing their Pollexfen qualities of thrift, common sense, and hard concentration along with the Yeats flair and vision. Looking at his eldest son's first work, and recognizing a true poetic voice, John Butler Yeats produced what his son later claimed was the only compliment to turn his head: &#145;By marriage with a Pollexfen we have given a tongue to the sea-cliffs&#146;  (<span class="italic">Autobiographies</span>, 23).<br>
<br>It was not, however, an easy, nor even a particularly precocious, ascent to Olympus. When W. B. Yeats (known to his family and intimates as Willie, a name he detested) was two, the family moved to London, living at a variety of lodgings before settling in the Bedford Park area of Hammersmith, then a kind of ghetto for aesthetes and artists. However, the children continued to be shipped back to Sligo for long intervals, travelling on small vessels belonging to the family firm. W. B. Yeats's earliest education was at a dame school in Sligo, and through coaching from family friends: a slow learner in some subjects, and a spectacularly idiosyncratic speller all his life, he none the less showed remarkable if wayward intellectual capacity early on, as well as a constitutional shyness which he learned to conceal beneath a mannered public pose. Both these characteristics&#151;intellectual and psychological&#151;were influentially shaped by his father's stimulating but aggressive didacticism. In London Yeats attended the Godolphin School in Hammersmith from 1877 but in 1881 John Butler Yeats once more transplanted the family back to Dublin. Here, the future poet completed his education at the Erasmus Smith high school, and subsequently&#151;like his sisters&#151;attended the Metropolitan School of Art from 1883 to 1885. By then he was writing copious but unpublished poetry; he first appeared in print in the <span class="italic">Dublin University Review</span> of March 1885, with some brief lyrics, followed later that summer by a Shelleyan verse drama called &#145;The Island of Statues&#146;.<br>
<br>By then Yeats was serving another apprenticeship too, in the circle of intellectuals who met at the Contemporary Club organized by the protestant nationalist C. H. Oldham, editor of the <span class="italic">Dublin University Review</span>. This actually had nothing to do with the strict unionist confines of Trinity College, Dublin, where Oldham was rather uncomfortably employed. Home rule politics were anathema in most Trinity circles, and these were the years of Parnell's growing ascendancy&#151;and of the land war, which put paid to the few remaining rents coming to John Butler Yeats out of the small family properties in co. Kildare. He was himself a home-ruler (though he preferred Parnell's predecessor Isaac Butt&#151;a family friend&#151;to the icy and enigmatic Chief); both J. B. Yeats and his twenty-year-old art student son were regulars at Oldham's Club from its origins in late 1885. Through these eclectic gatherings they met the returned Fenian intellectual John O'Leary, once literary editor of the firebrand <span class="italic">Irish People</span> and still connected with nationalist journalism.<br>
<br>The young Yeats was already noted for his &#145;poetic&#146; character, alternately vague and intense, and for the charisma lent by his dreamy good looks and passionate outbursts of eloquence. Pronouncing accurately that Willie Yeats was the only club member who possessed literary genius, O'Leary was an invaluable connection to literary outlets like <span class="italic">The Gael</span> as well as Irish&#150;American publications run by his political friends, such as John Boyle O'Reilly's <span class="italic">Boston Pilot</span>. The nature of Yeats's very early published verse certainly owes something to the kind of journal where he knew he could get it published. None the less it seems clear that the young Yeats adopted what was called at the time &#145;advanced&#146; nationalism, and may have taken the Fenian oath about 1886 before returning to London, with the rest of the family, early in 1887. This was not, however, incompatible with a belief in home rule, and&#151;after Gladstone's adoption of the cause in 1886&#151;a settled expectation that it was inevitable. Later in life W. B. Yeats would recall that the cultural revolution which&#151;in his view&#151;brought about the actual revolution of 1916&#150;21 began after the shattering fall of Parnell in 1891. But in many ways the political and literary initiatives embraced by Yeats and his friends in the 1880s, such as the Young Ireland literary societies, should be seen as the creation of a cultural agenda in anticipation of a coming independence, achieved through the constitutional efforts of the apparently all-conquering Parnell.<h2>
<a name="Literarypoliticsoccultismandthe1890s"></a>Literary politics, occultism, and the 1890s</h2>None the less the appeal of Fenianism was emotionally powerful for a young Irishman moving in literary circles in London, whose background of <i>d&eacute;class&eacute;</i> protestantism and uncertain location necessitated a firm claim on Irish identity. Tutored by O'Leary in the Irish version of classical republican virtues, introduced by the same cicerone to the poetry of Samuel Ferguson, excited by the Romantic and mythic histories of Ireland's &#145;Heroic Age&#146; recently published by Standish James O'Grady, and moving in literary&#150;nationalist circles already frequented by people like Katharine Tynan and the young Douglas Hyde, Yeats was firmly convinced of the need for an Irish cultural initiative which would advance a style of writing definitively national both in form and content, and create from local traditions a sustaining &#145;mythology&#146;. It would take many years to refine this ideal&#151;years which, from one view, might be interpreted as representing a progressive process of depoliticization as well. Certainly in the late 1880s, as Yeats helped to form societies like the Irish Literary Society of London, planted out poems and reviews in an increasingly wide variety of journals, and logrolled indefatigably on behalf of his literary circle, he was developing a theory of literature which would move beyond the flyblown models of the early nineteenth century popularized by Thomas Davis and the Young Ireland movement. Significantly, the only Irish poet of the era whom Yeats continued to respect aesthetically was the maverick James Clarence Mangan (also a key influence on the young James Joyce), though in these years he also discovered a respect for the &#145;square-built power&#146; of early nineteenth-century Irish fiction written by William Carleton and John and Michael Banim. By contrast, the influence on him of the great Romantics, notably Shelley, would remain as a subterranean stream, resurfacing as late as the 1920s. He also marked down William Blake as a master early on, and with Edwin Ellis produced a large-scale commentary on Blake's prophetic writings in 1893. While often erratic and idiosyncratic, it helped establish the importance of Blake's esoteric verse.<br>
<br>However, Yeats himself isolated as a key moment in his poetic development his famous early poem &#145;The Lake Isle of Innisfree&#146;. It was initially composed in mid-December 1888, at the time he was preaching to his circle the need to &#145;make poems on the familiar landscapes we love not the strange and rare and glittering scenes we wonder at&#151;these latter are the landscape of Art, the rouge of nature&#146;  (to Katharine Tynan, 21 Dec 1888, <span class="italic">Collected Letters</span>, 1.119). Published in 1890, it achieved immediate success&#151;still pursuing him around the world, to his irritation, forty years later. His 'prentice works in Dublin, often in the form of verse drama, had been inspired by the &#145;strange and rare and glittering&#146;, which still affects his first collection, <span class="italic">The Wanderings of Oisin</span>, in 1889; his best writing of the 1890s would follow the form set by &#145;Innisfree&#146;, with its deceptively simple language and dramatic personal interventions. But the poems of this period, culminating in the consummate <i>symboliste</i> collection <span class="italic">The Wind among the Reeds</span> (1899), possessed&#151;especially to an English ear&#151;their own strangeness too, derived not only from Yeats's deliberate Celticism but also from his equally considered occultism.<br>
<br>Though this commitment had its Celtic dimension too, it serves as a useful reminder that Yeats's life was from early on divided firmly between his Irish sojourns and a London base. The Yeats family's move to London during the poet's early childhood paralleled that of many others; it also happened at a time when, as George Bernard Shaw mordantly recalled:<blockquote>every Irishman who felt that his business in life was on the higher planes of the cultural professions, felt that he must have a metropolitan domicile and an international culture: that is, he felt that his first business was to get out of Ireland. (G. B. Shaw, <span class="italic">The Matter with Ireland</span>, 1902, 10)</blockquote>Yeats knew this, but he also knew the uncertainty of dislocation. In London he became a central figure in the bohemian circles where literary fashion, apprentice &#145;decadence&#146;, and supernatural experimentalism met and often overlapped. Life in Bedford Park may have been dogged by family tensions and unpaid butchers' bills, but it was also characterized by a circle of acquaintance which included Oscar Wilde and his mother as well as William Morris (in whose workshop Lily Yeats was trained) and George Bernard Shaw. In his early twenties Yeats was already moving easily from this world to that of the young writers around W. E. Henley, or the poets who met as the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/95480', "Rhymers' Club")</script> in the Cheshire Cheese pub in Fleet Street (including Lionel Johnson, Ernest Dowson, and John Davidson), and on to theosophist circles around Madame Helena Petrovna Blavatsky. Though incapable of speaking French, from the 1890s Yeats was also dropping in and out of various Parisian subcultures, and experimenting with hashish and mescal. He later fixed all these worlds memorably in his <span class="italic">Autobiographies</span>, placing them in their time with a delicate sense of distancing which never quite becomes ridicule; George Yeats later remarked that she was always astonished by her husband's uncanny sense of how things would look to people afterwards. At the time these cultural underworlds served, for this most autodidactic of intellectuals, as a kind of alternative university.<br>
<br>This was especially true of occultism. From his time at the high school in Dublin Yeats had been interested in various exotic and mystical theories and ideas of spiritual life, from Indian philosophy to Baron Reichenbach's notions of &#145;Odic Force&#146;; together with his lifelong friend George Russell (who wrote as &#145;AE&#146;), he helped import theosophy to Dublin. This synthesis of spiritual enquiry, incorporating the vogue for eastern mysticism but allowing for Darwinism, briefly magnetized a surprising range of the artistic intelligentsia. Yeats later claimed that its chief charm for him was Blavatsky's entertaining personality, with her cynical Russian humour, taking the form of irreverent mockery of her most humourless and devoted disciples. But though he fell out with the theosophists, they provided an important staging post in his journey towards the kind of occult society which most closely answered his emotional and psychological requirements. He found this, more or less, in the Order of the Golden Dawn.<br>
<br>Despite the impression given by Yeats's autobiographical writings (and several commentaries on his life), this was not an 1890s rite of passage that petered out about the turn of the century, but an involvement that stayed with him for most of his life. The order was devoted to magical researches rather than the achievement of mystical transcendence. Built on sub-Rosicrucian and cabbalistic foundations in 1887&#150;8, by the time Yeats was initiated on 7 March 1890, it was evolving a complex structure of hierarchies, liturgy, training processes, and examinations. The combination of secret society and intellectual obstacle race appealed to him (as to many other former theosophists); he proceeded through its grades and rituals, devoted an astonishing amount of time to it, used it to focus his wide-ranging reading in mystic and occultist writings, and through it formed some of his most important friendships and associations. It seems likely that the charisma conferred on him within the order, under his adopted name of <i>Demon Est Deus Inversus</i>, helped create the hieratic and lofty persona which would come to characterize him in the outside world as well (and correspondingly irritate his family and older friends, like Russell). It gave him the authority he always sought; it also affected his relationships with women. Sexually uncertain until a comparatively late stage of his life, and concealing a lack of confidence beneath the pose of unworldly <i>fin de si&egrave;cle</i> poet, he could use his authority in occult matters to assert himself over the kind of women who appealed to him&#151;strong-minded, unconventional, and dramatic personalities as they generally were. This was true of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/64175/', "Olivia Shakespear (1863&#150;1938)")</script>, the married novelist with whom he began a love affair in 1896, of the actress Florence Farr, and perhaps most of all of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37465/', "(Edith) Maud Gonne (1866&#150;1953)")</script>.<h2>
<a name="TheinfluenceofMaudGonne"></a>The influence of Maud Gonne</h2>A year younger than Yeats, Gonne was the daughter of an English army officer stationed at the Curragh; motherless and lonely, she adopted the cause of Ireland early on, in the form of revolutionary nationalist politics. Since she was a strikingly beautiful former d&eacute;butante, with the height and presence of a Valkyrie, and after her father's death possessed a large private fortune, her political extremism brought her rapid notoriety in Dublin circles. She none the less managed to keep the other side of her life, based in Paris, comparatively secret: in 1887 she began a long liaison with the right-wing French politician and journalist Lucien Millevoye, by whom she had two children (the first conceived not long after she met Yeats). Yeats first met her&#151;or so he believed&#151;when she arrived at his family's house on 30 January 1889, bearing an introduction from John O'Leary, and &#145;the troubling of my life began&#146;  (<span class="italic">Memoirs</span>, 40). She persistently stated that they had in fact met some time before, at his father's Dublin studio. But for him, that London encounter was a <i>coup de foudre</i>: his rather tepid and dutiful love interest in acquaintances like Katharine Tynan was replaced by a long-sustained passion for someone who seemed at once a heroine from a Shelleyan romance and a personification of Ireland at its most bewitching. She returned his friendship, shared his interests in the occult and mystic life, and deeply admired his poetry, but refused to give him more&#151;without, as yet, revealing the reasons. None the less their association on the astral plane remained intense; they shared visions of previous incarnations and would in 1898 achieve through telepathetic dreaming&#151;in Yeats's view at least&#151;a mystic marriage.<br>
<br>The pattern of their relationship was set early on. While repeatedly begging her to marry him, Yeats believed that she was consecrated to &#145;Ireland&#146;; though the extremism of her politics alarmed him, he followed nervously a step or two behind, and his support of her through the many vicissitudes of her life over the next thirty years or so was unfailing. In some ways the relationship&#151;enslavement to a magically beautiful and unattainable <i>princesse lointaine</i>&#151;was so exactly appropriate for the nature of his poetry that it is easy to assume a certain amount of contrivance in his infatuation. But his notebooks, drafts, horoscope studies, private letters all bear witness to the depth and obsessiveness of a passion continually recreated, as he himself would write, like &#145;the phoenix&#146;, however often he thought he had laid it to rest.<br>
<br>Maud Gonne supplies part&#151;though not all&#151;of the motivation behind Yeats's immersion in Irish political and cultural activity during the early 1890s. His efforts to commandeer the Irish Literary Society in Dublin, and to control the publication of an &#145;Irish Library&#146; of canonical texts, led to intense in-fighting in 1892&#150;3, from which he withdrew bruised; his efforts to capture Irish cultural initiatives on behalf of the neo-Fenian and Parnellite elements lost out to the more politically adept and ideologically moderate faction led by the septuagenarian Young Irelander Charles Gavan Duffy and Yeats's old companion T. W. Rolleston, who had defected to the moderates and was not forgiven for it. At the same time, the experience concentrated Yeats's enterprise to define a culture that would be definitively Irish, unmaterialistic, politically nationalist, and culturally avant-garde, and his key writings of the early 1890s demonstrate this. They also reflect the connection between folklore and occult divination which characterized Yeats's side of the movement, epitomized in his widely influential collection of prose pieces <span class="italic">The Celtic Twilight</span> (1893).<br>
<br>But Celtic revivalism also raised an issue just coming into prominence: the possibility of an Irish literary culture which would be un-English yet written in the English language. The Gaelic League, formed at just this time (1893), declared that this was an impossibility. Yeats made episodic efforts to learn Irish but quickly abandoned them&#151;through a congenital inability to learn languages, rather than a considered response. His reiterated argument that a new Irish literature could be forged in English was decried by many &#145;advanced&#146; nationalists in the cultural arena. His political-spiritual credo was declared through the poetic manifesto &#145;To Ireland in the Coming Days&#146;, published as a kind of preface to <span class="italic">The Countess Kathleen and Various Legends and Lyrics</span> (1892), and implicitly addressed to Maud Gonne as well as to his nationalist detractors. Though the next decade was to prove him right, he&#151;and several of his literary friends and allies&#151;would become proportionately distanced from conventional &#145;advanced&#146; nationalist politics in the process.<br>
<br>This is exactly what seemed to be happening in the mid-1890s, when Yeats published his selected <span class="italic">Poems</span> (1895), which saw the start of his lifelong commitment to weeding and rewriting his early work into a canon. His approach, as Hugh Kenner has put it, was that of &#145;an architect, not a decorator; he didn't accumulate poems, he wrote books&#146;, each collection a polished and coherent whole  (H. Kenner, &#145;The sacred book of the arts&#146;, <span class="italic">Gnomon: Essays on Contemporary Literature</span>, 1958). The mid-1890s also saw a temporary cooling in his relationship with Gonne; his close involvement in the new literary journal <span class="italic">The Savoy</span> with his friend the symbolist poet and critic Arthur Symons; and the start of his love affair (and lifelong friendship) with Olivia Shakespear, reflected in some of the haunting love poetry of <span class="italic">The Wind among the Reeds</span> (&#145;The Shadowy Horses&#146;, &#145;Michael Robartes Remembers Forgotten Beauty&#146;). Other &#145;answering&#146; poems like &#145;Aedh Wishes his Beloved were Dead&#146; clearly evoke his hopeless passion for Gonne. All this put London rather than Dublin at the forefront of his divided life between 1895 and 1897. But the last years of this key decade saw a dramatic intensification of his Irish activity, both political and cultural: Maud Gonne returned to the centre of his life, he became involved in the Fenian politicking around the commemoration of the 1798 rising, and he embarked on the theatrical enterprise which dominated his life for the next decade and brought him the most enduring and fruitful friendship and collaboration of his life so far.<br>
<br>The years 1897&#150;8 saw a frantic round of political meetings, plotting on committees, and planning for a large-scale commemoration of the revolutionary tradition in Irish politics, all timed for the summer of 1898. Maud Gonne was a leading light (using the contacts made and publicity coups staged in the counter-jubilee demonstrations of 1897), and Yeats himself advanced to prominence as president of the '98 Centennial Association of Great Britain and France, in which guise he began to appear in police reports. Part of the reason for his excitement was a parallel burst of occultist activity. Astrological portents and prophecies had foretold great things for the Celtic revivalist movement at the end of the century, coinciding with similar revelations among the Celticist avant-garde in Scotland, Brittany, and elsewhere; with Russell and others, Yeats and Gonne had begun to plan a new Celtic Mystical Order, constructing elaborate rituals and symbolical codes, and planning a centre in the holy land of the west of Ireland. National and spiritual liberation were to coincide in a new age, which would begin late in 1898. This was reflected in the poems of vision and apocalypse which he wrote at this time (&#145;The Unappeasable Host&#146;, &#145;The Valley of the Black Pig&#146;, &#145;The Secret Rose&#146;), as was his private expectation that Maud Gonne would at last come to him as lover and wife. It did not fall out as foretold. The 1798 commemoration activities, though they probably put in train a long-term revival of the Irish Republican Brotherhood, seemed at the time rather a damp squib. And while Yeats did receive an apocalyptic revelation just before Christmas 1898, it took the form of Maud Gonne's telling him about her secret life&#151;and secret family&#151;in Paris. While it can be conjectured that she may have been clearing the way for their relationship to progress to a different level (her affair with Millevoye had recently foundered), it was put to him&#151;and received on his part&#151;as presenting the clinching reason why she could never marry him. His shock and disillusionment, vividly reflected in his letters of the time, were immense.<h2>
<a name="Theatricalinvolvementsandpoliticaldisillusionment18991916"></a>Theatrical involvements and political disillusionment, 1899&#150;1916</h2>Significantly, however, these letters were poured out to another woman whose very different relationship to the young poet would have an almost equal effect on his life. Yeats's friendship with <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/33554/', "Augusta Gregory (1852&#150;1932)")</script> had developed quickly from their meeting at Edward Martyn's Galway castle in the summer of 1896; her neighbouring house, Coole Park, became almost literally Yeats's second home from 1897, when he began the practice of spending summers there which would last thirty years. But she brought him far more than the background of &#145;order and labour&#146; which he craved, and against which much of his finest work would be written. For Gregory's part, having married a much older man (Sir William Gregory, the retired politician and colonial governor) and been widowed young, the friendship with the dazzling young poet developed into a literary and theatrical collaboration, and launched her on a career of playwriting and theatrical management which put her at the centre of the developing cultural renaissance in Dublin. She was already independently interested in collecting rural folklore and superstitions, and unlike Yeats she spoke Irish. Here too they collaborated, going from cottage to cottage (where the poet's black garb meant he was sometimes mistaken for a proselytizing clergyman). Thirteen years older than Yeats (who always addressed her as Lady Gregory, though she called him Willie), she had a severe appearance and an imperious manner which concealed a passionate temperament, boundless energy, and tremendous powers of organization and perseverance; she was also capable of a racy and cynical humour. All her qualities were put to work for Yeats's benefit, and he paid poetic tributes to this most enduring of his friendships, which &#145;So changed me that I live, Labouring in ecstasy&#146; (&#145;Friends&#146;, written in January 1911).<br>
<br>Lady Gregory came to occupy such a central role in Yeats's life that friends and family tended to grumble at the way his natural impetuousness and enthusiasm became overlaid by a certain hauteur and arrogance, as well as a growing idealization of the eighteenth-century Ascendancy tradition which Gregory, for him, represented. It is likely, however, that these qualities were also cultivated as a defence against the derisive sniping which Yeats always attracted from Dublin's literary quidnuncs. A distant attitude may also have provided necessary armour in the enterprise of an Irish Literary Theatre, which Yeats, Martyn, and Gregory planned in 1897 and which&#151;thanks largely to Gregory's indefatigable lobbying for support among the influential&#151;opened on 8 May 1899 with Yeats's play <span class="italic">The Countess Cathleen</span>. This play, dealing with a saintly aristocrat who gives up her soul to the devil in order to save her people from starving, had been written ten years before, but much adapted in the interval&#151;partly to incorporate aspects of his relationship with Gonne. The ensuing furore about its supposedly blasphemous content set the tone for the theatre's fortunes. Run on a shoestring, and without a permanent base, the movement incorporated the talented theatrical producer Willie Fay and his actor-director brother Frank, as well as drawing on the experience of dramatic groups organized by Maud Gonne and her friends. Many of the original company were idealistic (and radical) nationalists. Gonne herself at first supported the Irish National Theatre Society, electrifying audiences with her 1902 performance in the nationalist allegory <span class="italic">Cathleen ni Houlihan</span>, jointly written by Yeats and Gregory (though it appeared under his name alone). A year later, however, Gonne left the society in protest against the plays of J. M. Synge. By then, in any case, the old Irish Literary Theatre was evolving into the Abbey Theatre company, inaugurated on 27 December 1904 and named after its permanent home, which had been provided by Yeats's wealthy fellow initiate of the Golden Dawn Annie Horniman. The reorganization also involved a triumvirate of directors, Yeats, Gregory, and Synge, wielding dictatorial power over their highly talented (and often resentful) company, and frequently finding themselves at odds with the irascible Horniman, who was romantically obsessed with Yeats. The positive result was a disciplined, innovative, and highly influential institution, which undertook tremendously successful tours in Britain and America, survived many cliffhanging crises (including the eventual departure of Horniman and her subsidy), and finally (1926) became one of the world's first state-subsidized theatres in an independent Ireland.<br>
<br>The effect of this involvement on Yeats's creative and personal life was immense. His first (and last) writing was in dramatic form; he was deeply stage-struck, having already seen his early play <span class="italic">The Land of Heart's Desire</span> produced in Bedford Park on 29 March 1894 as a curtain-raiser to Shaw's <span class="italic">Arms and the Man</span>. During the first decade of the twentieth century nearly all his creative effort was channelled into the theatre. His immense correspondence is dominated by questions of organization, production, and direction; he followed the Wagnerian experiment at Bayreuth from a distance, and embarked on a long-lasting preoccupation with the innovative set designs of Gordon Craig, who made a set of screens to create abstract effects for Abbey productions; and he threw himself into playwriting. The results ranged from collaborative efforts with George Moore (<span class="italic">Diarmuid and Grania</span>, 1901) and Gregory (<span class="italic">Cathleen ni Houlihan</span>, <span class="italic">The Pot of Broth</span>, both 1902) to allegorical works like <span class="italic">The King's Threshold</span> (1903) and <span class="italic">Where there is Nothing</span> (1904); he also wrote <span class="italic">On Baile's Strand</span> (1904), introducing the legendary Gaelic hero Cuchulainn, around whose life he would develop a cycle of plays, written in several forms. Dramatic form, indeed, remained a problem: the early verse plays are perhaps the least effective, but from 1915 Yeats began experimenting with elements of the Japanese Noh drama, using masks, choruses, and abstract sets, but capable of dealing with concrete themes like Irish resistance to British rule (<span class="italic">The Dreaming of the Bones</span>, 1919). There were also less successful comedies attempting to blend nihilism with farce, like <span class="italic">The Player Queen</span>, commissioned by Mrs Patrick Campbell (whom the poet-playwright approached with mingled terror and fascination) and much rewritten over a ten-year period; and a lengthy Wagnerian verse drama called <span class="italic">The Shadowy Waters</span>, never finished to his satisfaction. Yeats apprenticed himself to writing plays with all his characteristic passion and commitment, but it could be argued that real success eluded him until the short plays he wrote in his last decade&#151;notably <span class="italic">The Words upon the Windowpane</span> (1930), where his hero Jonathan Swift speaks through a medium's mouth to riveting dramatic effect, and <span class="italic">Purgatory</span> (1938), which consummately employs Yeatsian themes of repetition, history, and violence.<br>
<br>It is none the less true that Yeats's theatrical involvement developed the declamatory and increasingly colloquial tone of his verse, as well as his ability as ventriloquist: the form of dramatic dialogue recurs in his verse from this period, and he continued to invent personae to express his poetic voice (Michael Robartes, Crazy Jane, Ribh the hermit, and possibly his occult &#145;familiar&#146;, Leo Africanus). Through the theatre he also developed one of the most influential literary friendships of his life, with the playwright John Millington Synge, whose astonishing plays formed the centre of the Abbey's avant-garde repertoire. Though there were always tensions between the two men, Yeats's admiration for the work of his enigmatic and reticent colleague was unstinting; he also recognized the shock value of Synge's uncompromising work, and its value as literature that was at once distinctively Irish and distinctively modern. Synge's work, and the angry reactions to it in Dublin, also focused Yeats's mind on his own relationship to conventional Irish nationalism. Synge's early death (1909) remained a defining point in Yeats's life, and he is an abiding theme in poems such as &#145;The Fisherman&#146;. After Maud Gonne's marriage in February 1903 to an ostentatiously unmystical Irish Republican Brotherhood man of action, John MacBride, Yeats felt less tramelled by the beliefs of his youth; when Gonne left her violent husband after a short and abusive marriage, the fact that the nationalist world took his side against hers compounded Yeats's (though not Gonne's) disillusionment with Fenian pieties. His own nationalism became more and more <i>sui generis</i>, and his quarrels with the guardians of piety more and more aggressive. The stage of the Abbey provided the arena for the most celebrated of these confrontations. Plays like <span class="italic">The King's Threshold</span> and <span class="italic">Where there is Nothing</span> may be read as commentaries on the artist's relation to the politics of his day; he certainly abandoned his hopes of a revolutionary apocalypse after 1900, and avoided Fenian support groups set up in the aftermath of the South African War. Most of all, he opposed what he felt to be the ideals of Irish culture advanced by Arthur Griffith's Sinn F&eacute;in movement from about 1905. And if the first half of Yeats's life pivots round one great emblematic confrontation, it is the row over Synge's play <span class="italic">The Playboy of the Western World</span> in 1907, when Yeats pitted himself and the Abbey Theatre against what he saw as know-nothing pietism and intolerance. The play's opponents are often represented as the outraged Dublin bourgeoisie; but Yeats identified them specifically as Sinn F&eacute;iners, and said so.<br>
<br>In his essay of 1910, &#145;J. M. Synge and the Ireland of his Time&#146;, which is a first instalment of autobiography masquerading as an elegy for his friend, Yeats clearly constructed the arguments for a kind of nationalism which would be at once inclusive, imaginative, and realistic. Arthur Griffith (once a friend to the theatrical movement, now an enemy of the Abbey and Yeats) had described <span class="italic">The Playboy</span> as &#145;a vile and inhuman story told in the foulest language we have ever listened to from a public platform &hellip; the production of a moral degenerate who has dishonoured the women of Ireland before all Europe&#146;  (<span class="italic">Sinn F&eacute;in</span>, 2 February 1907). Both the play and its proponents were, in a word, un-Irish and anti-national. Yeats, in opposition, cited his own revolutionary record in Fenian organizations and accepted the directly political implications of the <span class="italic">Playboy</span> controversy, arguing (in a particularly sinewy and subtle way) that the nineteenth-century Young Ireland conventionalities no longer answered the questions of identity posed by modern Ireland. The invention of tradition, and &#145;images for the affections&#146;, had done their work of confidence building, and Irish national rhetoric must advance beyond chauvinism and defensiveness:<blockquote>Even if what one defends be true, an attitude of defence, a continual apology, whatever the cause, makes the mind barren because it kills intellectual innocence; that delight in what is unforeseen, and in the mere spectacle of the world, the mere drifting hither and thither that must come before all true thought and emotion. A zealous Irishman, especially if he lives much out of Ireland, spends his time in a never-ending argument about Oliver Cromwell, the Danes, the penal laws, the rebellion of 1798, the famine, the Irish peasant, and ends by substituting a traditional casuistry for a country. (<span class="italic">Essays and Introductions</span>, 1961, 314)</blockquote>By 1910 Yeats had redirected into the theatre his belief in ritual, his desire to educate an Irish public away from English materialism to intellectual independence, his ability to dominate committees and set up organizations. These qualities were also displayed in his periodic efforts to exercise a decisive influence over his sisters' enterprise, the Cuala Press, not always to their pleasure. At forty-five he was determined to turn his energies back towards verse and to spend less time running the Abbey. In Dublin he sustained for some years a discreet love affair with Mabel Dickinson, an amateur actress and &#145;medical masseuse&#146;; it ended in 1913, when she pressed for marriage on the basis of an unfounded pregnancy scare. But throughout he remained close to Gonne, and their relationship went through a particularly intense phase late in 1908, when they briefly became lovers at last, before reverting to the spiritualized bond which Gonne preferred: a &#145;mystic marriage&#146;. Yet up to 1917, and his sudden marriage, she still haunted his poetry: &#145;Her Praise&#146;. &#145;His Phoenix&#146;, and, &#145;The People&#146; were all written in 1914&#150;15.<br>
<br>In 1908, aged only forty-three, Yeats had produced an eight-volume <span class="italic">Collected Works</span>; though intended as clearing the ground in order to advance, it was a risky gesture. But by now he was a major figure in the literary firmament. Appositely for someone both preoccupied by the doctrine of the mask, and very conscious of the need for self-presentation, Yeats remained a favourite subject for artists all his life. His striking looks as a young man, with his raven hair, olive skin, and dreamy gaze, are preserved in many portraits: notably by his father (1900), William Strang (1903), Augustus John (1907), and Charles Shannon (1908). He was the subject of distinguished photographs by Alvin Langdon Coburn, Alice Broughton, and others, and was sculpted by Kathleen Bruce (1908) and Albert Power (1918). He was a favourite subject for caricature by masters such as Beerbohm and Dulac. The frontispieces to the volumes of his <span class="italic">Collected Works</span> run the gamut of images by John, Sargent, Mancini, Shannon, and J. B. Yeats: &#145;nobody will believe they are the same man&#146;, Yeats wrote to John Quinn, &#145;and I shall write an essay upon them and describe them as all the different personages that I have dreamt of being, but have never had the time for&#146;. His omnivorous juvenile reading and the education of his father's studio had refined his critical powers and the weight and originality of his work as literary critic has never quite won its due. His contribution to the study of Blake, Spenser, Shelley, and Shakespeare is decisive, besides his reinstatement of near-forgotten Irish figures such as Carleton, Mangan, and Ferguson. Yeats was also behind the great success of Rabindranath Tagore, whose work he powerfully advocated (and subtly edited); the award of Nobel prize to Tagore in 1913 marked one of Yeats's great triumphs of literary entrepreneurship.<br>
<br>By 1914 Yeats, in his fiftieth year, was at a crossroads in life; old adversaries like George Moore thought he had written himself out. He had become a celebrated figure in English as well as Irish literary life. The years up to the First World War saw him become an established lion in the London social safari, sought after by hostesses like Lady Cunard, lunching at the Asquiths', an influential member of Edmund Gosse's academic committee of the Royal Society of Literature, the recipient of a civil-list pension from 1910 (for which &#145;advanced&#146; Irish nationalists refused to forgive him). In 1915 he turned down a knighthood. He had achieved enormous success on the American lecture tour circuit, making extended visits in 1903&#150;4, 1911, 1914, 1920, and 1932. He was a firm supporter of the <span class="roman">Home Rule Bill</span>, passed, with difficulty, by 1914, but suspended for the duration of the war, and made some eloquent speeches supporting it; but his Fenian connections had apparently lapsed. His life remained divided between Coole in the summers and his celebrated Bloomsbury rooms in Woburn Buildings, where he held court on Monday evenings, for much of the rest of the year. During the winters of 1913, 1915, and 1916 he spent much time in an Ashdown Forest cottage, accompanied by the young American poet Ezra Pound (who married Olivia Shakespear's daughter Dorothy) as secretary and amanuensis. Pound and Yeats certainly influenced each other, though the traffic was not as one-way as the American liked to suggest; from the early 1900s Yeats's verse had been striving towards the colloquial voice, as well as the ellipsis and condensation, which bewildered some critics when he published his path-breaking collection <span class="italic">Responsibilities</span> in 1914. The bitter interrogations of poems like &#145;To a Wealthy Man &hellip;&#146;, &#145;September 1913&#146;, and &#145;To a Shade&#146; were also inspired by a series of public controversies in Irish life, where Yeats had opposed what he saw as the philistinism of the new Irish bourgeoisie&#151;notably over the vexed question of municipal support for a modern art gallery to house the pictures offered by Gregory's nephew, the art dealer and connoisseur Hugh Lane&#151;an issue left hanging when Lane went down with the <span class="italic">Lusitania</span> in 1915, leaving the disposition of the paintings legally (though not morally) uncertain.<h2>
<a name="TheIrishrevolutionanditsaftermath19161930"></a>The Irish revolution and its aftermath, 1916&#150;1930</h2>Yeats's distancing from conventional nationalism, his disillusionment with modern Irish life, and his apparent absorption into the English establishment, should all be borne in mind as the background to his response to the shattering Irish rising of Easter 1916. It was as much of a shock to him as to most other people, and his first reaction&#151;as he wrote to Gregory on 11 May&#151;was that &#145;all the work of years has been overturned, all the bringing together of classes, all the freeing of Irish literature and criticism from politics&#146;  (11 May 1916, <span class="italic">Letters</span>, 613). With the execution of the insurgents he began to feel an unwilling admiration for the self-sacrifice of those involved&#151;who included John MacBride, Maud Gonne's estranged husband. Yeats's feelings (and their ambiguity) are powerfully interrogated in the key poem &#145;Easter 1916&#146;, composed between the execution of the insurgents in May and the end of September. It was circulated in a privately printed edition but not published for four years&#151;partly because he feared jeopardizing the cause of reclaiming Lane's picture collection for Ireland (a campaign in which he and Gregory were lobbying English politicians), partly because his own feelings were in the process of crystallization. &#145;Easter 1916&#146;, in its intellectual complexity, subtle shifts of mood and form, and use of internalized dialogue, marks a new level in Yeats's &#145;political&#146; poems; but it was also a last, elegiac appeal to Gonne to turn from fanatical abstractions and join him in a celebration of life. At the same time his sympathies were moving towards the revolutionary cause even before the Lloyd George government mounted its campaign against the IRA in 1920 by means of the &#145;black and tan&#146; mercenary forces, which Yeats assailed in poems and speeches. By the time of the rising he was already negotiating to buy the ancient Norman tower of Ballylee in Galway, near Coole; during the Irish revolution of 1916&#150;21 he decided to move back to his native country and, as he had put it early on, &#145;begin building again&#146;.<br>
<br>In the same period Yeats's private life also went through dramatic upheavals: in 1916 he was a 51-year-old bachelor, by the end of 1921 he was married and the father of two children. During the summer of 1916 he visited Gonne at her seaside house in Normandy. After MacBride's death he had asked her to marry him once more, and she had once more refused. He was in any case deeply preoccupied with her daughter by Millevoye, Iseult (1894&#150;1954) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/72587/', "Stuart, Iseult")</script>], now a fascinating (and strikingly beautiful) young woman of twenty-two, who admired him deeply; by 1917 the 52-year-old poet had become entranced by her, and that summer he proposed marriage, which she refused. He subsequently turned to another much younger woman: Bertha Georgie Hyde-Lees (1892&#150;1968), known as George, whose mother was married to Olivia Shakespear's brother. She was a close friend of Dorothy Pound, and had collaborated on spiritualist researches with Yeats, which had become infused with romantic interest by late 1915. However, Yeats's obsession with Iseult persisted, and his marriage to George on 20 October 1917 came as a total surprise to most of their acquaintance. It also brought him very near to a total breakdown. The triangle of women in his life (Maud&#150;Iseult&#150;George) recurs in his poems of the time, lightly disguised, and stands behind the play <span class="italic">The Only Jealousy of Emer</span>; he was also deeply affected by the repetition of a pattern set in the 1890s, when he had been torn between his affair with Shakespear and the unattainable but disruptive image of Gonne.<br>
<br>Astrological calculations had played a part in Yeats's conviction that he would marry in 1917; foretold or not, it was a fortunate decision. George Yeats was highly intelligent, good-humoured (if slightly acerbic), sophisticated, and quietly unconventional. She created the first settled home the poet had known (helped by her independent means), guarded his increasingly uncertain health, and proved a heaven-sent collaborator in his work as well: preserving drafts, editing his work posthumously, and above all recharging his occult researches for nearly ten years by means of concentrated experiments in &#145;automatic writing&#146;, first employed as a method of assuaging his doubts and self-reproaches in the first days of their sudden marriage. She was also well aware of&#151;as she put it&#151;&#145;the strange, chaotic, varied and completely unified personality that you are&#146;  (1 Jan 1935, priv. coll.).<br>
<br>This was just as well. Strikingly, Yeats not only remained friends with most of his past lovers, he also relied heavily on mutually supportive friendships with women. This often involved an implicitly sexual element: extraordinarily attractive all his life, he had a way of lending himself out to the fantasies of others and then withholding himself while they stayed in thrall. His marriage did not mean an end to this kind of relationship, and intense collaborative friendships, in some cases developing into love affairs, continued to be a feature of his later life&#151;notably with Margot Ruddock, Ethel Mannin, Dorothy Wellesley, and Edith Shackleton Heald. But his marriage remained near the centre of his life, bringing him a great period of emotional and imaginative fulfilment. It is symbolically marked by the publication by Cuala of his landmark volume <span class="italic">The Wild Swans at Coole</span> a month after his wedding, but it is the extended version brought out by Macmillan in 1919 which stands as a coded autobiographical record of these eventful years. Criticized by some for uneven language and wilful obscurity, it was seen by more far-sighted commentators as his most significant advance since <span class="italic">The Wind among the Reeds</span>. The title-poem in fact revisits his 1890s themes of personal alienation and emotional deprivation, but in severely beautiful language, without a touch of ornateness. The same qualities appear in &#145;The Fisherman&#146; where the poet claims not only an &eacute;lite status but an ideal audience:<blockquote>
<div>All day I'd looked in the face<br>
</div>
<div>What I had hoped 'twould be<br>
</div>
<div>To write for my own race<br>
</div>
<div>And the reality;<br>
</div>
<div>The living men that I hate,<br>
</div>
<div>The dead man that I loved,<br>
</div>
<div>The craven man in his seat,<br>
</div>
<div>The insolent unreproved<br>
</div>
</blockquote>There is also a series of poems written before the upheavals of 1917 which celebrate Gonne's departed beauty and indomitable spirit, and some heartfelt lyrics inspired by his feelings for Iseult. &#145;In Memory of Major Robert Gregory&#146; is the most substantial of Yeats's elegies for his friend's son, killed in the war, but it is also a sombre meditation on his own acquisition of a wife and a house, at a time of life when old friends and associations were falling away from him. Above all, &#145;Solomon and Sheba&#146;, &#145;The Phases of the Moon&#146;, and &#145;The Double Vision of Michael Robartes&#146; reflect or even record the insights brought by George Yeats's mediumship. <span class="italic">The Wild Swans at Coole</span> commemorates a period of emotional turmoil as well as occult revelation.<br>
<br>However, politics were withheld from the volume, in the shape of the pro-rising poems written after 1916. These were cautiously published from 1920, and collected in <span class="italic">Michael Robartes and the Dancer</span>, published in 1921, embodying further fruits of this new phase in his life, while the philosophical pattern-making precipitated by George's insights were processed into <span class="italic">A Vision</span> (1926, revised 1937). But the summit of Yeats's creative achievement in these years is represented in <span class="italic">The Tower</span> (1928). This volume, decorated with one of Thomas Sturge Moore's most beautiful cover engravings, depicting Ballylee and its reflection, brought together the poems quarried out of new sources, expressed in new language. At the same time, as Richard Ellmann remarked of the breathtaking opening poem &#145;Sailing to Byzantium&#146;, Yeats had in a sense been writing them all his life. Thus that poem is a distillation of his well-established themes of human old age, the mutability of nature, and the eternity of art&#151;but viewed quizzically through the prism of a millennial Byzantium created from his supercharged imagination and wide if erratic reading. As such, it has magnetized a phalanx of scholars but retains the quintessential Yeatsian combination of mystery and accessibility:<blockquote>
<div>That is no country for old men. The young<br>
</div>
<div>In one another's arms, birds in the trees,<br>
</div>
<div>&#151;Those dying generations&#151;at their song,<br>
</div>
<div>The salmon-falls, the mackerel-crowded seas,<br>
</div>
<div>Fish, flesh, or fowl, commend all summer long<br>
</div>
<div>Whatever is begotten, born, and dies.<br>
</div>
</blockquote>
<span class="italic">The Tower</span> also contains his two great sequences about history and violence, inspired by the Bolshevik as well as the Irish revolution&#151;&#145;Nineteen Hundred and Nineteen&#146; and &#145;Meditations in Time of Civil War&#146;. The first interrogates &#145;the present state of the world&#146; (its original title) through a complex commentary on cyclical history and personal disillusionment:<blockquote>
<div>We, who seven years ago<br>
</div>
<div>Talked of honour and of truth,<br>
</div>
<div>Shriek with pleasure if we show<br>
</div>
<div>The weasel's twist, the weasel's tooth.<br>
</div>
</blockquote>&#145;Meditations&#146; meanwhile, suggests, doubtfully enough, that the apocalyptic horses of destruction can herald a new creativity and growth, arising out of the wreckage of a superficially assured civilization. A volume that also includes &#145;Among School Children&#146; and &#145;All Souls Night&#146; has to be reckoned at the height of his achievement. While the personal voice is as dominant as ever, Yeats also demonstrates a new ability to raise abstruse philosophical questions in a language at once mobile, exploratory, and economical. He thought it the best book he had written, and he was right.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">The Tower</span> also contains &#145;Leda and the Swan&#146;, written five years before, and already notorious. That recurring theme of the birth of civilizations through acts of violence was cast into shadow by the immediacy of the erotically charged imagery when Yeats published it in <span class="italic">To-morrow</span>, a short-lived magazine edited by Iseult and her husband, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/75847/', "Francis Stuart (1902&#150;2000)")</script>, which had successfully outraged Irish Catholic piety. This was a deliberate strategy: Yeats also contributed an anonymous editorial, designed to provoke the self-righteous. From the early days of the new Irish Free State he set himself up as the scourge of artistic and literary censorship, not always with the approval of fellow protestants who preferred not to rock the boat.<br>
<br>Though the Yeatses first lived in Oxford after their marriage, George had encouraged her husband's instinct to return to Ireland and from early 1922 they divided their time between a Dublin town house and the tower at Ballylee. The Irish civil war rumbled in the background, and its reverberations echo in &#145;Meditations in Time of Civil War&#146;, written at this time:<blockquote>
<div>We had fed the heart on fantasies,<br>
</div>
<div>The heart's grown brutal from the fare;<br>
</div>
<div>More substance in our enmities<br>
</div>
<div>Than in our love; O honey-bees,<br>
</div>
<div>Come build in the empty house of the stare.<br>
</div>
</blockquote>The upheavals of Irish politics also brought Yeats back into public life. In 1923 he was nominated to the senate of the new Irish Free State, where he took an active role over the next five years, chairing the committee appointed to choose a new coinage for the country, and making celebrated speeches against the imposition of Catholic social teaching in Irish constitutional law. He used his public position on occasions like the Tailteann games (August 1924), as well as his platform in the senate, to further the cause. But the tide of opinion was against him, and the attitudes he struck during the 1920s and 1930s would be held against him in perpetuity. At the same time his espousal of artistic freedom and celebrated pronouncements against the prohibition of divorce (1925) conferred a special position in Irish public life. And though he saw himself as seeking, and finding, an &#145;Anglo-Irish solitude&#146;, he could not stop throwing himself into public controversy when the opportunity arose.<br>
<br>In another key poem, &#145;Among School Children&#146;, Yeats described himself during his senate years as &#145;a smiling public man&#146;, but the smile was not always in evidence. As a politician and a poet he was always conscious that there was an audience to be addressed; this could be both a strength and a weakness. Significantly, &#145;Among School Children&#146; ended by posing profoundly unanswerable Neoplatonic questions; for the centre of his imaginative life remained far from politics, a fact amply if rather mystifyingly demonstrated in <span class="italic">A Vision</span>, published in 1926. Relying on the interrogations and reflections pursued through George's automatic writing, this strange book codified human archetypes and historical cycles into a framework based on the twenty-eight phases of the moon; arcane philosophy had in some measure replaced the magical quests and rituals of the Order of the Golden Dawn, though he kept up his connection with that organization as late as 1922. In both these involvements his wife's influence was discreet but decisive: her wide reading in esoterica inform the resourceful responses which make up the vast corpus of &#145;Automatic Script&#146; analysed by scholars. <span class="italic">A Vision</span> is an attempt to fashion a personal philosophy, and to codify historical change, on lines that have been described as &#145;Gnostic-Apocalyptic&#146;. It might also be seen (in a private description of Oliver St John Gogarty's) as &#145;a geometrical rendering of the emotions, a mixture of Einstein and myth&#146;  (unpublished letter to L. A. G. Strong, 26 Jan 1926, University of Texas at Austin). Several of its preoccupations had been aired in the two essays on art and the spiritual life published as <span class="italic">Per amica silentia lunae</span> in 1918: George had seen the proofs during the first days of their marriage, and her &#145;instructors&#146; had clearly taken them to heart. When writing <span class="italic">Per amica</span> Yeats had characteristically written to Craig:<blockquote>I used to think, when I was a boy, that no man should be permitted to public life till he had written first: an account of the world to come; second: a practicable scheme for the perfection of this world, and sworn to the two. (unpublished letter, 4 Sept 1917, Biblioth&egrave;que Nationale, Paris)</blockquote>This neatly expresses his enduring belief in the interconnectedness of supernatural and everyday life, which tended to bewilder his more earthbound acquaintances, but was deeply rooted in his early devotion to Swedenborg and more especially William Blake&#151;an admiration that never left him.<br>
<br>At the same time, the strength of Yeats's work&#151;and some of his finest poetry was written in the 1920s&#151;was also rooted in direct personal experience. It is not coincidental that he was simultaneously continuing his reflective <span class="italic">Autobiographies</span>, and still fighting hard battles over the Abbey Theatre (notably regarding the new dramatic genius Sean O'Casey, whose early plays provoked riots reminiscent of the reaction to Synge, but who broke with Yeats and Gregory when they turned down his experimental anti-war play <span class="italic">The Silver Tassie</span> in 1928).<br>
<br>Yeats's international status was recognized by the award of the Nobel prize in 1923, which brought him some financial capital for the first time in his life; the lecture which he gave on the occasion, published in &#145;The Bounty of Sweden&#146;, stands as one of his most influential essays in autobiography. Augustus John's second portrait, of 1930, depicts Yeats in his maturity, with his disciplined mane of white hair and pugnacious lower lip. He was by now one of Dublin's great established figures, both in his own right and as the representative of the cultural renaissance which&#151;it was generally held, and unequivocally stated by Yeats himself in his speech receiving the Nobel prize&#151;had set in motion the Irish revolution and war of independence. Long ago, in 1913, he had emphasized to Gregory that future generations would see their era of Irish history through their own biographies, and so it was coming to be. Gregory herself died of cancer in 1932; Yeats, who had stayed with her at Coole through her last months, had lost one of the rocks of his existence, as well as the house he loved more than any other. (Taken over by the Forestry Commission, it was allowed to rot and was eventually demolished, a fate Yeats himself had proleptically dealt with in his lapidary poem to Gregory and her influence, &#145;Coole Park, 1929&#146;.) He and George moved out of central Dublin in 1932 to a small country house with a large garden at Rathfarnham, beneath the Dublin mountains; he had already stopped going to Ballylee, and from 1927 was spending some of each winter in southern Europe for the sake of his health; in 1928 he had considered settling in Rapallo for good. He suffered from high blood pressure, as well as recurrent arthritis; his chest and heart gave frequent cause for alarm. He was severely ill in November&#150;December 1929, when a haemorrhage of the lungs was followed by Malta fever, collapsed again from January to March 1935 with congestion of the lungs, and early in 1936 was threatened by acute sclerosis and kidney problems. When his doctor (and fellow poet) Oliver Gogarty read him a letter from his Spanish doctor describing him as &#145;an antique cardio-sclerotic of advanced years&#146;, Yeats allegedly responded that it sounded a more sonorous title than lord of Lower Egypt.<h2>
<a name="The1930s"></a>The 1930s</h2>Yeats's failing health makes the febrility and energy of his work during his last decade all the more remarkable. This energy was also reflected in surges of excitement about political issues. Though he was fully committed to the Free State, Yeats's years in the senate had not given him a high opinion of the workings of representative democracy; his naturally &eacute;litist inclinations were reinforced by the authoritarian and arcane world of occult researches, and a dislike of what he saw as the devaluation of culture in the post-war world. In Irish terms, he was still a passionate believer in the necessity of a distinctive national culture, grounded in essential Irish traditions rather than pinchbeck materialism imported from England; but he now looked for those traditions in the work of eighteenth-century luminaries of the Ascendancy like Bishop Berkeley, Edmund Burke, and perhaps most of all Jonathan Swift. Long before, in <span class="italic">Reveries over Childhood and Youth</span> (1915), he had rejoiced in &#145;all that joins my life to those who had power in Ireland&#146;  (<span class="italic">Autobiographies</span>, 22); his celebration of traditional authority took a political swerve in 1933, when he became interested in the proto-fascist movement started by General O'Duffy, known as the &#145;blueshirts&#146;. Yeats actually wrote some embarrassingly bad poems to be used as marching songs but rapidly distanced himself from the movement when it became clear that it stood for principles very different from those he had hoped for. Neither the fervent Catholic pietism nor the anti-intellectualism of the blueshirts and their leaders could appeal to someone who had fought so manfully against the literary censorship imposed by the Free State; the movement's real impetus came from the farming interest who felt disadvantaged by government economic policies, and from political elements antipathetic to the former revolutionary Eamon De Valera, who had just assumed power democratically, after opposing the treaty in arms only ten years before. Neither of these issues meant much to Yeats: he was nearly seventy and in some ways a man of the 1890s still and his wish had been to see the revival of a poetic and anti-modern Ireland, the &#145;dream of the noble and the beggar-man&#146;.<br>
<br>At the same time Yeats was not immune to the currents of right-wing thought sweeping Europe; long a devoted reader of Nietszche, he devoured Spengler's <span class="italic">Decline of the West</span>, became a member of the Eugenics Society, and from the early 1920s issued periodic denunciations of parliamentary democracy as redundant, quoting&#151;if not necessarily endorsing&#151;Mussolini. (Some of his intemperate pronouncements on modern politics were published in <span class="italic">On the Boiler</span> eight months after his death.) He was also a frequent visitor to Italy, where he resumed his old friendship with Pound, wintering in Rapallo in 1928 and 1929, and speaking at the fourth congress of the Alessandro Volta Foundation in Rome in October 1934. He accepted the Goethe-plakette from the city of Frankfurt in the same year, but this was purely a recognition of the first German performance of <span class="italic">The Countess Cathleen</span>. He occasionally expressed ill-advised approval of some features of the new Nazi regime, though he never visited the country. But this does not necessarily add up to fascist politics (indeed, his speech at the Roman congress stressed the necessity of artistic freedom); he was ironic about Pound's political excesses and (unlike friends such as Maud Gonne, Iseult Stuart, and Oliver Gogarty) never subscribed to any form of antisemitism. Though he refused to join his friend Ethel Mannin in her campaign to liberate Carl von Ossietzsky from Nazi Germany in 1936, it seems likely that this was because he disapproved of using a Nobel prize nomination in such a directly political way. &#145;Do not try to make a politician of me&#146;, he wrote to Ethel Mannin in 1936  (<span class="italic">Letters</span>, 850&#150;51):<blockquote>even in Ireland I shall never I think be that again&#151;as my sense of reality deepens, and I think it does with age, my horror at the cruelty of governments grows greater, and if I did what you want I would seem to hold one form of governments more responsible than any other and that would betray my convictions. Communist, fascist, nationalist, clerical, anti-clerical are all responsible according to the number of their victims. I have not been silent; I have used the only vehicle I possess&#151;verse. If you have my poems by you look up a poem called &#145;The Second Coming&#146;. It was written some sixteen or seventeen years ago and foretold what is happening. I have written of the same thing again and again since &hellip; I am not callous, every nerve trembles with horror at what is happening in Europe. &#145;The ceremony of innocence is drowned&#146;.</blockquote>Yeats also emphasized to Mannin that he remained &#145;a Fenian of the school of John O'Leary&#146;. Certainly his opposition to Britain's record in Ireland remained powerful, and was rekindled by the controversy over Roger Casement, executed for treason after the 1916 rising after agitation for a pardon was short-circuited by the release of his alleged homosexual diaries. Casement, like Parnell, recurs in Yeats's pungent late ballads, symbolizing nobility done down by &#145;baseness&#146;. But his last years, like his early life, were divided between England and Ireland. In Dublin he had tried to construct a circle of sympathetic and talented literary friends, meeting regularly at his house&#151;the kind of <i>c&eacute;nacle</i> on which he had always depended. They included his oldest friend George Russell as well as the younger writers Frank O'Connor and F. R. Higgins whom he also brought into the Abbey organization, and the Irish Academy of Letters which Yeats and Shaw set up in 1932, drawing violent chauvinist abuse from the <span class="italic">Catholic Bulletin</span> and elsewhere. But in several ways the intellectual atmosphere of De Valera's Ireland was uncongenial to him&#151;and he to it, as reflected in a series of virulent attacks on &#145;Pensioner Yeats&#146; and his &#145;Sewage School&#146; of poetry. And Yeats's appetite for the exotic remained undimmed: in 1934&#150;5 he became almost as excited about the reflections of the Indian sage Shri Purohit Swami as he had been over Rabindranath Tagore twenty-five years before. He wrote the introduction to the Swami's autobiography and spent the winter of 1935&#150;6 in Majorca with him, hoping to achieve a fruitful collaboration in spiritual and literary terms. But the episode ended disastrously: Yeats suffered his most serious illness yet, his latest admirer, Margot Ruddock, followed them to the island and produced a spectacular nervous breakdown, while an embittered female camp follower of the Swami's was only just dissuaded from precipitating a scandal.<br>
<br>Now seventy, Yeats continued to rage against old age&#151;which, as he ironically pointed out to Olivia Shakespear, he had been denouncing since <span class="italic">The Wanderings of Oisin</span>, written in his early twenties. He defied it on one level by engaging in literary controversy&#151;notably over his idiosyncratic choice for the <span class="italic">Oxford Book of Modern Verse</span> in 1936, which combined an eccentric approach to canon making with an &#145;Introduction&#146; that is actually a masterly instalment of intellectual autobiography. There were also passionate friendships with younger women; much of his time from the mid-1930s was spent staying in Sussex with Wellesley or Heald. In April 1934 he underwent the celebrated Steinach operation (actually a unilateral vasectomy) with a view to prolonging (or restoring) his potency. The physiological effect was doubtful, but his powers were certainly&#151;and miraculously&#151;exercised at full stretch in the poetry of his last years. This is often savage, hard, and clear in the manner he had declared to be his ideal from the turn of the century, but only intermittently embraced. Sequences like the &#145;Crazy Jane&#146; poems turned back to the ballad metres and even the demotic Irish personae of his very early verse, but put them to aggressively modern use; philosophical lyrics like &#145;Long-legged Fly&#146; used the cyclical ideas derived from a lifetime's speculative reading with a challenging economy and beauty. His rediscovery of themes from Indian philosophy also suggested the mystical and symbolic use of sexual desire and ecstasy. The best of his late poetry explores the myths humanity lives by, and anchors them in his own experience. At the same time he continued the interrogation of the creative process which he had been engaged in since &#145;Adam's Curse&#146; (1904). Finally, in &#145;The Circus Animals' Desertion&#146; he produced perhaps his most consummately expressed artistic autobiography:<blockquote>
<div>Those masterful images because complete<br>
</div>
<div>Grew in pure mind, but out of what began?<br>
</div>
<div>A mound of refuse or the sweepings of a street,<br>
</div>
<div>Old kettles, old bottles and a broken can,<br>
</div>
<div>Old iron, old bones, old rags, that raving slut<br>
</div>
<div>Who keeps the till. Now that my ladder's gone,<br>
</div>
<div>I must lie down where all the ladders start,<br>
</div>
<div>In the foul rag-and-bone shop of the heart.<br>
</div>
</blockquote>The declamatory note of his <span class="italic">Last Poems</span> is not always successful, and the lines can ring as alternately over-contrived, ragged, and jarring; nor are his ventures into demotic saltiness always happy. (F. R. Higgins, who advocated poetry that could be sung to Irish folk tunes, had a lot to answer for.) But at best this final achievement confirmed his claim to rest at the forefront of modernism, having started as an ornament of the blue-and-silver 1890s and the &#145;Celtic note&#146;. The note of &#145;curious astringent joy&#146; which he attributed to Nietszche and to Blake also sounds through his late testaments, and at such junctures he makes good his sustained artistic effort to break through into the &#145;desolation of reality&#146;.<br>
<br>When Yeats wrote &#145;The Circus Animals' Desertion&#146; he had not long to live. His health necessitated a long stay in the south of France from January to March 1938. Back in Ireland, he saw the publication of <span class="italic">New Poems</span>, and the production of his play <span class="italic">Purgatory</span> which opened at the Abbey on 10 August with sets designed by his daughter Anne; it was accompanied, gratifyingly, by a theological controversy. But in December he was back on the Riviera, where he died at Roquebrune on 28 January 1939. He was writing to the end. His last play, <span class="italic">The Death of Cuchulain</span>, and his last two poems, &#145;Cuchulain Comforted&#146; and &#145;The Black Tower&#146;, hark back to the Gaelic legendary themes of forty years before. But &#145;Cuchulain Comforted&#146; is also a Dantean vision of transformation and departure into the shades, written when Yeats knew he was dying. In a sense, he choreographed the performance of his death as well as his life. <span class="italic">Last Poems and Two Plays</span> was published the following July. Shortly afterwards, the world descended into war, and the removal of Yeats's remains from Roquebrune, where they were initially interred on 30 January 1939, to his desired burial place in Sligo was postponed until nine years later, when he was interred &#145;under Ben Bulben&#146;, as dictated in the epitaph poem he wrote for himself. In 1939 his obituarists quarrelled about his place in Irish&#151;or in English&#151;letters; most expressed mystification at the tone and direction of his late poems; many harked nostalgically back to the musical clarity of his early verse, and some denounced him as from the pulpit. But in 1948 an Irish navy corvette brought his coffin back to Galway harbour, where it was conveyed to what would be rechristened &#145;Yeats country&#146; and was on 17 September 1948 buried in Drumcliff, co. Sligo. The ceremony, attended by Irish government ministers who included the son of Maud Gonne and John MacBride, effectively proclaimed W. B. Yeats as pre-eminent national poet. The controversy over whether his remains had, in fact, been correctly identified in Roquebrune added a mythic flavour, suggestive of King Arthur or Charles Stewart Parnell. But it did not detract from the symbolism of the re-interment.<h2>
<a name="Posthumousreputation"></a>Posthumous reputation</h2>Yeats is now seen as one of a handful of Irish writers whose influence and example helped create twentieth-century modernist literature in the English language; but unlike that of James Joyce or Samuel Beckett (not to mention Oscar Wilde and George Bernard Shaw), his life remained intimately intertwined with the biography of his country. The period spanned by Yeats's birth and death delineates the exact period of Ireland's turbulent development towards political independence through a nationalist movement which moved between constitutional and extremist modes; as T. S. Eliot put it, Yeats was &#145;one of those few poets whose history is the history of their own time, who are part of the consciousness of an age which cannot be understood without them&#146;  (&#145;The poetry of W. B. Yeats&#146;, reprinted in J. Hall and M. Steinman, eds., <span class="italic">The Permanence of Yeats</span>, 1950, 34). From the very beginning of his long literary career, his poems provided phrases which rang in the national mind and provided keys to Irish experience (&#145;I will arise and go now, And go to Innisfree&#146;; &#145;Romantic Ireland's dead and gone, It's with O'Leary in the grave&#146;, &#145;A terrible beauty is born&#146;, &#145;Things fall apart, the centre cannot hold&#146;). Yet it is the difficulties and tensions of Yeats's relationship to Irish history and Irish identity, dramatized both directly and indirectly in some of his best writing, which give his poetry much of its dynamic tension. His huge international reputation is securely based on the mystery and grandeur of his late verse and the poignancy of his love poetry, but he first came to fame as the exotically Celtic poet of a &#145;new&#146; nationalist Ireland: almost single-handed, he made Irishness culturally fashionable. Spearheading a great cultural renaissance, he moved into his maturity as the voice of his country, memorializing her heroes, sitting as a senator in her independent parliament, dying full of years and honours.<br>
<br>Yet throughout his career Yeats sustained an angry, quarrelsome, ambivalent relationship with his native country; and for his first fifty years he lived more in England than Ireland, a pattern recurring at the end of his life. His early poems on Celtic and faery themes became and remained canonical, but he was attacked in Ireland for the decadence, occultism, and sensuality of his verse and the arrogant iconoclasm of his public utterances&#151;and, indeed, his personal style. His reputation was violently fought over for years after he died, and much of this quarrel revolved around the issue of whether &#145;England&#146; or &#145;Ireland&#146; should claim him. If this seems difficult to understand now, with pilgrims guided through co. Sligo in the footsteps of his poetry and a thriving tourist industry concentrated around every Irish resonance set up by his verses, his life and background do much to explain it.<br>
<br>Yeats's posthumous reputation is more monumental, and less assailable, than some of his contemporaries would have expected. During the Second World War his work went out of print, and through the 1950s Yeatsian studies were the province of a few dedicated and highly distinguished scholars&#151;such as Cleanth Brooks, A. N. Jeffares, T. R. Henn, and most of all Richard Ellmann. However, interest in his life was sustained by Allan Wade's edition of letters and Macmillan's publication of several volumes of prose writings organized by his widow, while Peter Allt and Russel Alspach's heroic <span class="roman">Variorum</span> editions of poems and plays demonstrated clearly the depth of attention that needed to be paid to Yeats's endless revisions in search of a canonical text. From the 1960s his philosophical interests, and the occultist underpinnings behind much of his work, began to arouse serious interest, reflected in the work of F. A. C. Wilson, Giorgio Melchiori, James Olney, and others. His place in Irish history and political influence was examined by the new wave of Irish historians, notably Conor Cruise O'Brien and F. S. L. Lyons. By the 1970s the Yeats &#145;industry&#146; was working full-scale; the massive project of a full-scale annotated <span class="italic">Collected Letters</span> was under way, two scholarly <span class="italic">Annuals</span> of Yeats studies came into existence, and the annual Yeats summer school in Sligo set a much imitated example. The deeply complex question of Yeatsian texts (complicated by the poet's own apparent authorization of different editions in the 1930s) has sparked a long controversy about the canonical version of his poetry, and has been illuminated by the publication of scholarly editions of the much revised manuscripts behind his various collections. Even a certain 1980s reaction against Yeats's work, as affected by what Seamus Deane termed &#145;the pathology of literary Unionism&#146;, simply added fuel to the blazing interest in his work and life. He had always been supreme among modern Irish poets and his international standing has equally been recognized as one of the great innovators of modern poetry, who developed a voice so unique as to inhibit as well as to inspire those who came after him. Early on, defending his constant poetic revisions, he had declared that he must &#145;re-make&#146; himself: in the process he helped re-make both his own country and world literature.<br>
