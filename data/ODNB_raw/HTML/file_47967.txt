<span class="headword">Reynolds,  George Bernard</span>  (1852/3&#150;1925), <span class="occ">engineer</span>, was the only son of Commander George Stewart Reynolds (<i>d</i>. 1882) RN and his wife, Eliza Susannah; his birth was not registered in England, but his death certificate describes him as a British subject by birth in the UK. His father died a vice-admiral, on the retired list. Details of Reynolds's education are not known, but he graduated from the Royal Indian Engineering College and served in the Indian public works department. He then worked for the Royal Dutch Oil Company in the Sumatra oilfields. Some time before 1895 he married, and although his wife, Lavinia Jane, never seems to have accompanied him on his overseas tours of duty, he wrote regularly to her. They had no children.<br>
<br>In 1901 <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37341/', "William Knox D'Arcy")</script>, having obtained an oil concession in Persia, engaged Reynolds as fields engineer there. After prospecting near the border with Mesopotamia (Iraq), Reynolds began drilling operations late in the following year. The wells had to be abandoned in 1904, and he was then instructed to investigate likely sites in south-west Persia. D'Arcy became so short of funds that he persuaded the Burmah Oil Company to finance the Persian venture. Reynolds was too proud and independent-minded to accept the constant interference of his new managers, and he often resorted to uncivil and sarcastic ripostes in his weekly correspondence to them.<br>
<br>Burly and exceptionally robust, Reynolds had the presence and mental strength to face down all his problems in Persia, from troublesome issues concerning drillers and local tribesmen to hardships ranging from polluted water and aggressive insects to extremes of climate. Deriving solace from his pipe, a pet dog, and occasional picnics with cronies, he drove his men hard but was solicitous for their welfare, ordering cider, library books, seeds, and bowling kits for them. Even so, he ironically likened himself to the skipper of a windjammer, forever bombarded with complaints about the rations.<br>
<br>The years 1905 to 1908 were the most arduous and frustrating in the quest for Persian oil. Drilling on an unproductive site wasted two years, and operations did not begin at his favoured location, Masjed-e-Suleiman, until January 1908. Initial setbacks coincided with a severe cash crisis in Burmah Oil, and the directors instructed him to abandon drilling if no oil appeared at 1500 feet. Then, on 26 May 1908, oil was struck in enormous quantities within that limit. This proved to be the first of the massive Middle-Eastern oil fields; and its discovery allowed the Anglo-Persian Oil Company to be floated in London in April 1909.<br>
<br>Relations between Reynolds and his employers thereafter became increasingly fractured. He resented the administrative structure the new company was planning for Persia, refused to co-operate, and deliberately withheld urgently needed information. Early in 1911 he was recalled and dismissed, with a golden handshake of &pound;1000. No word of thanks was offered for his signal achievements.<br>
<br>Sir Henri Deterding shortly afterwards recruited him to work for the Royal Dutch&#150;Shell petroleum group in Venezuela. There he surveyed a potential oil site near Lake Maracaibo on the country's northern coast. Having reported favourably on its prospects, he was appointed fields general manager there. Physical conditions were quite as primitive as they had been in Persia. However, though by then approaching his sixties, his strong constitution and hard-won experience served him equally well there. By 1914 he had begun to produce oil commercially, on a small scale. Venezuela's oil output remained modest until in December 1922 Reynolds secured his second huge find of oil, in La Rosa field, also close to Lake Maracaibo. He must have retired shortly afterwards.<br>
<br>Once back in Britain, Reynolds was asked by the directors of Anglo-Persian to travel to Persia on a courtesy visit. Before he could take up this invitation, however, he died suddenly on 23 February 1925, aged seventy-two, at the Hotel de Inglaterra, Seville. None of the oil journals in that year noticed the man whose initiative, technical skills, and doggedness had opened up the oil riches of the Middle East. Reynolds was survived by his wife who may have seen all too little of him during his eventful career.<br>
