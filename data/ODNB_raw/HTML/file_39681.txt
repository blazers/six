<span class="headword">Conway,  Edward</span>, earl of Conway  (<em>c.</em>1623&#150;1683), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was the first surviving son and heir of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/55441/', "Edward Conway, second Viscount Conway and second Viscount Killultagh (bap. 1594, d. 1655)")</script>, politician and bibliophile, and his wife, Frances (1596/7&#150;1671), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22540/', "Sir Francis Popham")</script>. Apparently not enjoying any formal education the young Conway spent time in Paris, however, where he had some instruction in military arts in 1640. In 1649 his father signed over to him his justly famous library in consideration of debts for which Edward had stood surety.<br>
<br>On 11 February 1651 Conway married Anne (1631&#150;1679) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6119/', "Conway, Anne")</script>], daughter of Sir Heneage Finch, recorder of London, and half-sister of Heneage Finch, first earl of Nottingham. Four years later, in 1655, he succeeded to his father's titles. The third viscount's stance towards the public authorities of the Commonwealth era is uncertain. However, in 1656 his wife's uncle wrote to the lord protector's councillors imploring their assistance in the liberation of the viscount who had been kidnapped, robbed, and imprisoned by Ostenders <i>en route</i> for France. Conway had &#145;no hope of release but through you, by reason of his bearing arms for and his known affection to the present Government&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1656&#150;7</i>, 16.59&#150;60). Within a short space of time the viscount was ransomed. In 1657 he was certainly appointed to the Warwickshire assessment committee as part of the policy of healing and settling in local government. In 1660 Conway was at the head of the local gentry coup in Warwickshire, repeated across the country and vital to the momentum of Restoration, which saw the return of the reins of power, and principally the command of the local militia, into the hands of social &eacute;lites.<br>
<br>At the outset of his public career, after Charles II assumed his English throne, Conway's principal sphere of influence was in Ireland. In 1660 he was a member of the Irish privy council. A confidant of the duke of Ormond and closely associated with the increasingly beleaguered court interest of Lord Chancellor Clarendon, in November 1666 he counselled the lord lieutenant that 10,000 Irish troops be sent into England as a defence against invasion or rebellion, amid growing signs of the imminent collapse of the Clarendon regime&#151;a suggestion with a startlingly Straffordian ring, which seems to have sparked rumours of an intention to impose arbitrary government. Conway was subsequently named in the lord chancellor's compromise proposal for a commission to examine the royal finances, offered to deflect demands in parliament for the establishment of a committee of accounts. Conway's support for the court and the prerogative were strengthened further by his personal interest in the defeat of the Irish <span class="roman">Cattle Bill</span>, under which he stood to lose a considerable source of income from the rearing of Irish cows for English markets. By mid-January 1667 the Cavalier Parliament had reached crisis point. Looking on, Conway wrote that &#145;either the kingdom will be reduced to a commonwealth or the king must dissolve this present [parliament] and govern by some other medium&#146;  (Seaward, 289). When Clarendon fell Conway lamented the sorry state to which government descended. Writing to his brother-in-law, Sir John Finch, in February 1668 shortly before the latter's return from Italy, he told him that &#145;you will have the advantage of coming into a Court where there is not one man of ability&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1667&#150;8</i>, 258). However, he managed the transition reasonably well, successfully ingratiating himself with Arlington.<br>
<br>Conway was much occupied with the administration of Ireland, where he spent a considerable portion of his time, having a fine estate at Lisburn, co. Antrim. He was made governor of Charlemont Fort in 1671, and extended his authority over the counties of Armagh, Tyrone, Monaghan, and part of Down from 1672. He was joint commissioner of the Irish customs, 1673&#150;5, and held a commission as lieutenant-general of horse in the Irish army from 1674. Tory in his politics, Conway was enlisted by Danby in 1675 to persuade members of the English House of Lords resident in Ireland to attend and support the court. Later Danby and his wife would urgently solicit Conway's personal assistance in repelling the bill of attainder brought in against the first minister in the spring of 1679. It is unclear whether or not Conway made any effort to assist, but whatever he did it did not impede his appointment as master of the ordnance in Ireland early in summer that year. His wife, whose religious convictions he had on occasion indulged by securing the release of Quakers from prison, died on 23 February 1679, and her body was preserved in a glass case until her husband could return from Ireland to attend her funeral which did not take place for over two months. Despite suffering chronic ill health during the 1660s Lady Conway had enjoyed the company of a prominent intellectual circle centred on Henry More and other Cambridge Platonists. Her husband, who had been elected a fellow of the Royal Society on 2 January 1668, was the chief patron of Jeremy Taylor, future bishop of Down and Connor, whom he invited to Ireland in 1658 to take up a lectureship, as well as a benefactor of Taylor's fellow churchman George Rust, the philosophers More and Ralph Cudworth, and of his own wife, whose philosophical interests he also encouraged. After Lady Conway's death her manuscript treatise was published in 1690 as &#145;Principia philosophiae&#146; within a collection entitled <span class="italic">Opuscula philosophica</span>, once incorrectly attributed to Conway himself.<br>
<br>On 3 December 1679 the third viscount was created first earl of Conway and was introduced to the House of Lords by his new title on 21 October 1680. It was rumoured that he paid &pound;10,000 to the duchess of Portsmouth for the honour. Conway steadfastly opposed exclusion. On 2 February 1681 he joined the English privy council at Whitehall and was also appointed lord lieutenant of Warwickshire during the minority of the earl of Northampton. He acted as secretary of state for the northern department from then until January 1683, when he resigned amid allegations that he was complicit in &#145;crimes and misdemeanours &hellip; either in relation to the King's person or his public negotiations or transactions with foreign ambassadors, or in not rightly pursuing the King's instructions to ambassadors abroad&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>Jan&#150;June 1687</i>, 32). He retired, with a generous pension, to Ragley Hall, his family's Warwickshire seat, where he set about disarming dissenters and rooting out all local evidence of subversion and disaffection to the crown. His second wife, Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1681), daughter of George Booth, first Baron Delamere, whom he married at an unknown date, brought him a dowry of &pound;13,000. She died in July 1681, and by 30 August following Conway had married Ursula (<i>d</i>. 1697), daughter of George Stawell of Cothelstone, Somerset, this time netting himself &pound;30,000. In July 1683 he was advised that his return to court would be very welcome, and that he might expect a warm enough reception there. However, he died on 11 August following and was buried on 25 August at Arrow, Warwickshire. Advantageous as his matches had been, he left no heir, and all his honours became extinct at his death. His wife survived him and married John Sheffield, later duke of Buckingham.<br>
