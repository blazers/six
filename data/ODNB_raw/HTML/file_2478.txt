<span class="headword">Bisset,  Charles</span>  (1717&#150;1791), <span class="occ">physician and military engineer</span>, was born at Glenalbert, near Dunkeld, Perthshire, the son of a lawyer who specialized in Scots law. He studied medicine in Edinburgh and in 1740 was appointed second surgeon of the military hospital, Jamaica. He later served on board Admiral Vernon's fleet, by some accounts as a naval surgeon and by others as surgeon of one of the marine regiments subsequently disbanded. After spending five years in the West Indies and America he returned home in 1745 owing to ill-health.<br>
<br>In May 1746 Bisset obtained an ensigncy in the 42nd highlanders, then commanded by Lord John Murray, with which he served in the unsuccessful attack on the French coast near L'Orient, in September that same year. After spending the winter with his regiment at Limerick, he accompanied it to the Low Countries, where it was first engaged at Sandberg, near Hulst, in Dutch Flanders, in April 1747. Military sketches of this affair and of the defences of Bergen-op-Zoom, drawn by him, having been submitted by Lord John Murray to the duke of Cumberland, Bisset was ordered to the latter fortress to prepare reports of the progress of the siege. For his brave and skilful performance of this duty he was recommended by the duke of Cumberland for the post of engineer-extraordinary in the brigade of engineers attached to the army. Bisset served in this capacity for the remainder of the war. At the peace of 1748 the engineer brigade was broken up, and Bisset was placed on half-pay as a lieutenant. In 1751 he published an essay entitled <span class="italic">The Theory and Construction of Fortifications</span>, based on his military experiences.<br>
<br>Bisset returned to the profession of medicine, and went into practice at the village of Skelton, in Cleveland, Yorkshire, where he built up a lucrative practice. In 1765 he took his MD at St Andrews University. He was the author of a variety of medical publications. In 1755 he published his <span class="italic">Treatise on Scurvy</span>, which he dedicated to the lords of the Admiralty. In this he recommended the consumption of alcohol for the prevention of scurvy, contrary to the teachings of James Lind. In 1762 he published <span class="italic">An Essay on the Medical Constitution of Great Britain</span>, a manuscript of which he presented to the Leeds Infirmary. His publication <span class="italic">Medical Essays and Observations</span> (1766) was subsequently translated into German and Italian.<br>
<br>Bisset also wrote on non-medical topics, among them politics and naval tactics. A manuscript treatise by him entitled <span class="italic">Permanent and Temporary Fortifications and the Attack and Defence of Temporary Defensive Works</span>, which is dedicated to George, prince of Wales, and dated 1778, is preserved in the British Library  (Add. MS 19695). Some contemporaries, perturbed by his proficiency in both military and medical subjects, questioned the authenticity of his medical qualifications. In reply Bisset published a rejoinder in which he outlined his medical qualifications and experience. A copy of William Cullen's <span class="italic">First Lines of Practice of Physic</span>, with numerous manuscript notes by him, was preserved in the library of the London Medical Society.<br>
<br>Bisset was thin in person and of weakly habit. His correspondence with Dr John Coakley Lettsom gives some insight into his character. He was married, and retired to Knayton, near Thirsk in Yorkshire, where he died in 1791. He was buried at Leake church. His wife, Ann, died on 31 August 1810, aged seventy-six.<br>
