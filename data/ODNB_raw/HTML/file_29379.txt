<span class="headword">Wigram,  Joseph Cotton</span>  (1798&#150;1867), <span class="occ">bishop of Rochester</span>, was born at Walthamstow, Essex, on 26 December 1798, the fifteenth child of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/58560/', "Sir Robert Wigram, first baronet (1744&#150;1830)")</script>, an eminent Irish merchant and shipowner of London and Wexford. His mother, Sir Robert's second wife, was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/55217/', "Eleanor Wigram (1767&#150;1841)")</script>, daughter of John Watts of Southampton. Joseph was educated privately at Fulham and proceeded to Trinity College, Cambridge, where he graduated BA as sixth wrangler in 1820, MA in 1823, and DD in 1860. He was ordained deacon in November 1822 by the bishop of Ely and priest in May 1823 by William Howley, bishop of London. He served as a curate of Leytonstone, Essex, from 1822. In 1827 he became a district clergyman in the parish of St James, Westminster, under the Revd J. G. Ward. His twelve years of devoted work saw five new schools built and teams of visitors established. The chapel of ease for which he was responsible was rebuilt and opened as St Luke's Church, Berwick Street. He was also appointed secretary of the National Society from 1827, a position he held until 1839. On 1 March 1837 he married Susan Maria (1816&#150;1864), daughter of Peter Arkwright of Willersley in Derbyshire. On 28 March 1839 he was appointed by James Scott rector of East Tisted in Hampshire, and in 1850 removed to the rectory of St Mary's, Southampton, which was in the gift of Charles Sumner, bishop of Winchester. On 16 November 1847 he was collated archdeacon of Winchester. He also held a canonry at Winchester Cathedral from 1850 until his consecration as bishop of Rochester on Ascension day 1860 in the parish church of St Mary, Lambeth. Bishop Charles Sumner wrote: &#145;my right arm is cut off to furnish Rochester with its chief ruler&#146;  (Sumner, 397). He died in London at 15A Grosvenor Square on 6 April 1867 and was buried at Latton parish church in Essex alongside his wife. They had six sons and three daughters.<br>
<br>Wigram's qualities as a Christian leader have been somewhat underestimated. His archidiaconal report on the problems of Portsea (1851) demonstrated a far-sighted awareness of the problems of a naval parish and how they might be addressed. As a bishop Wigram was a resolute opponent of non-residency in his diocese, which then included Essex and most of Hertfordshire. He was a conscientious pastor to his clergy and worked to raise their minimum salary to &pound;250 per annum. He was staunchly committed to the parochial system and a decided advocate of mission women to assist the clergy. He argued that infants be baptized at public worship and that confirmation candidates should be given careful and full instruction. Wigram also promoted national day schools and evening institutions for adults. Although appointed by Lord Palmerston, Wigram was not quite &#145;of his politics&#146;, as Owen Chadwick observed  (1.472). One explanation for this was Palmerston's overriding concern to have bishops who, regardless of their political allegiance, would make an active contribution to the debates in the House of Lords on church affairs. Wigram was a conscientious bishop of evangelical views, who on one occasion somewhat rashly denounced his clergy for wearing moustaches and playing cricket with their parishioners on village greens. Wigram's strong advocacy of lay agents to assist the incumbent in the parish and his teaching on the second advent suggest that his sympathies were with the Recordites. When he died Bishop Charles Sumner wrote that &#145;he was one of the most single-minded, straightforward men I have ever known, somewhat cold in manner, but full of energy and devotion to his work. The diocese will never have a more disinterested and unselfish head&#146;  (Sumner, 397n).<br>
<br>Wigram was essentially a pastor rather than a scholar and the bulk of his published writing related to practical and ministerial topics. In addition to a number of sermons and pamphlets he wrote <span class="italic">Elementary Arithmetic</span> (1831), <span class="italic">The Geography of the Holy Land</span> (1832; 5th edn, 1855), <span class="italic">Practical Hints on the Formation and Management of Sunday Schools</span> (1833), <span class="italic">The Cottager's Daily Family Prayers</span> (1862), and <span class="italic">Daily Hymns for the Month</span> (1866).<br>
<br>His younger brother, <a name="cosubject_29377"></a><span class="headword">George Vicesimus Wigram</span>  (1805&#150;1879), <span class="occ">writer and lexicographer</span>, was born in Walthamstow, Essex, on 28 March 1805, the twentieth child of Sir Robert Wigram, and the fourteenth with his second wife, Eleanor, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Watts. Converted in 1824 as a young officer he left the army and entered Queen's College, Oxford, in 1826, but did not graduate. He intended to take orders in the Church of England but Bishop Blomfield declined to ordain him on the grounds of his extreme evangelical views. In 1827 he met with John Nelson Darby in Oxford and joined the (Plymouth) Brethren, devoting himself at the same time to the study of the biblical text. In 1831 Wigram published <span class="italic">A Protest Against the National Establishment of England</span>, and towards the end of the same year organized the first Brethren congregation in London. In 1834 his first wife, Fanny, died. She was daughter of Thomas Cherbury Bligh. He later made a second marriage, to Catherine, only daughter of William Parnell of Avondale and aunt of Charles Stewart Parnell.<br>
<br>In his youth Wigram lavished his immense wealth on clothes and horses; at Oxford he kept a close carriage. Latterly he used his inheritance for religious publishing. He became dissatisfied with Alexander Cruden's biblical concordance because it gave no clues as to the Greek language. In 1839 he therefore financed and published <span class="italic">The Englishman's Greek and English Concordance of the New Testament</span>, a second edition of which appeared in 1844 and an index in the following year. This work was based on the concordance of E. Schmidt and contained an alphabetical arrangement of every word in the Greek text. It was followed in 1843 by <span class="italic">The English's Hebrew and Chaldee Concordance of the Old Testament</span>. Later, in 1867, he edited with W. Chalk <span class="italic">The Hebraist's Vade Mecum</span>, which was the first attempt at a complete verbal index to the contents of the Hebrew and Chaldee scriptures.<br>
<br>The close friend and associate of John Nelson Darby, Wigram sided with him in the split with the (Plymouth) Brethren which resulted in the setting up of the separate Exclusive Brethren in 1849. Indeed it is clear that Wigram's unbending disposition inclined Darby to maintain his differences with Plymouth groups. Wigram initiated and edited a new journal for the Exclusives under the title of <span class="italic">Present Testimony</span>. Along with Darby he contributed articles and teaching which helped to generate the rapid expansion of Exclusivism in the middle Victorian years.<br>
<br>Wigram died on 1 January 1879 at his house, 45 Great Cumberland Place, London, leaving more than &pound;50,000 of the money he had inherited from his father's estate. Seven or eight hundred people, &#145;almost entirely well-to-do middle class&#146;, attended his funeral at Paddington cemetery.<br>
