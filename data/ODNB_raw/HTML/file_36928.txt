<span class="headword">Williams, Sir  Roland Lomax Bowdler  Vaughan</span>  (1838&#150;1916), <span class="occ">judge</span>, was born in Queen Square, Bloomsbury, on 31 December 1838, the fifth son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29501/', "Sir Edward Vaughan Williams (1797&#150;1875)")</script> and his wife, Jane Margaret Bagot. Sir Edward was justice of the court of common pleas from 1846 to 1865 and the grandson of Serjeant John Williams, author of the well-known commentary on Saunders's <span class="italic">Reports</span>. Vaughan Williams was educated at Westminster School, whence he was elected to a junior studentship at Christ Church, Oxford, in 1856. He graduated in 1860 with second-class honours in the school of jurisprudence and modern history. He then read in chambers with Hassard Hume Dodgson (1803&#150;1884), the special pleader, also of Westminster and Christ Church. He was called to the bar by Lincoln's Inn in November 1864 and joined the south-eastern circuit. The following year he married Laura Susanna, daughter of Edmund Lomax of Netley, Shere, Surrey, and assumed the additional name of Lomax.<br>
<br>In 1870 Vaughan Williams published <span class="italic">The Law and Practice of Bankruptcy</span>, a work which reached its thirteenth edition in 1925, and for many years was the standard authority on the subject. He eventually obtained a large common-law practice but his reputation at the bar was one of learning rather than of advocacy, and it was not until 1889, when he was over fifty, that he became a queen's counsel. He practised within the bar for less than a year, for on 10 February 1890, on the death of Sir Henry Manisty, he was appointed by Lord Halsbury (for whom, when solicitor-general, Vaughan Williams had acted as &#145;devil&#146;) to be a judge of the Queen's Bench Division. He was knighted the same year. In 1891 the bankruptcy jurisdiction of the High Court was assigned to him and during the next seven years he rendered conspicuous service in applying from the bench his wide experience to the problems of bankruptcy and liquidation, subjects in which the law was then still in a stage of development. Among the few <i>causes c&eacute;l&egrave;bres</i> that came before him were the Salomon case and the case of the New Zealand Loan and Mercantile Agency, of which Anthony John Mundella, president of the Board of Trade, was a director. The latter case involved delicate political complications, and Vaughan Williams conducted it with rigid independence and impartiality (1894).<br>
<br>In 1897, on the resignation of Lord Justice Lopes (Baron Ludlow), Vaughan Williams was promoted to be a lord justice of appeal, with the dignity of a privy councillor, and he sat as a member of the Court of Appeal for seventeen years. During this long period of service he was naturally called upon to deal with every kind of civil litigation; apart from the common law and bankruptcy, on which he was clearly a recognized authority, he showed a thorough grasp of such subjects as local government and revenue law. For several years it also fell to his lot to preside over and to give the leading judgment in the equity side of the court. His reputation as a judge emphasized, for good or ill, both his love of legal technicalities and his intellectual commitment to the logically unstructured common law; he is even said to have opposed the establishment of law schools, as he thought they would certainly lead eventually to a code replacing the common law. Whether his attention to the legal niceties represented a conscientious approach to his work, or rather a kind of self-indulgence, was a matter on which contemporaries differed. His great loquacity only served to exacerbate this: &#145;to gain [his] ear &hellip; you had to be ready to discourse&#151;or rather, perhaps, listen with apparent interest to his discourse&#151;on propositions of law&#146;  (Parry, 186). To Frederick Pollock he was &#145;terribly diffuse and slipshod, though he is a very clever man&#146;  (Pollock to Oliver Wendell Holmes jun., 6 July 1903); to most of the bar he seems to have been a popular, if somewhat idiosyncratic, figure.<br>
<br>Almost the only occasion on which Vaughan Williams undertook external work was in connection with the royal commission on the disestablishment of the Welsh church, of which he was appointed chairman in 1906. He handled the commission effectively and with a complete freedom from political bias; the quick solution of the difficulties attending Welsh disestablishment and disendowment were largely attributed to him. He retired from the bench in 1914, and died on 8 December 1916 at his home, High Ashes Farm, Abinger, near Dorking, where he had spent his leisure time, farming and following other country pursuits, throughout his professional career; he was survived by his wife. His eldest son, Roland Edmund Lomax Vaughan Williams (1866&#150;1949), became KC in 1913 and was recorder of Cardiff from 1930 to 1945. Two other sons died in childhood. Ralph Vaughan Williams, the composer, was his nephew.<br>
