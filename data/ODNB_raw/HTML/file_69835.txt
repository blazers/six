<span class="headword">Jenkins <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Glyde]</span>,  Alice Brook</span>  (1886&#150;1967), <span class="occ">abortion campaigner</span>, was born in Church Street, Ilkley, Yorkshire, on 4 December 1886, the daughter of Charlotte Glyde, a single mother and servant. She had five siblings, all of whom became involved in radical politics, her brother as an Independent Labour Party alderman and her four sisters in the suffragette movement. Academically gifted, she won a scholarship to a grammar school in her native Yorkshire, but could not afford to go to university and so pursued her education as a pupil-teacher, combining study with work. In 1907 she began a lifelong common-law partnership with William James Jenkins, an insurance manager. They moved to Ealing, west London, and had three children.<br>
<br>In the mid-1920s Jenkins became involved with the Workers' Birth Control Group, an organization of feminist socialists, working women, and birth control advocates dedicated to extending working-class women's access to contraceptive information. She was also active in the Islington family clinic, which dispensed birth control information to working-class people. This encounter with the difficulties of sex and reproduction among working-class people convinced her that unsafe abortion was a pressing problem for working women. Her commitment to the reform of the abortion laws separated her from mainstream opinion in the birth control movement, but brought her closer to such figures as Stella Browne and Janet Chance. Like Browne and Chance, Jenkins was not interested in abortion as an isolated issue, but rather as a central element of a wider sea-change in English attitudes to sex and morality. In 1929 she told Dora Russell, for example, that she believed in a &#145;revision of the accepted morality of our generation&#146;, comprising &#145;freedom from cant and hypocrisy&#146;  (10 Nov 1929, <span class="roman">Dora Russell papers</span>, 7). That her own mother had been a single parent undoubtedly gave an added depth to Jenkins's belief in sexual and moral reform.<br>
<br>In the 1930s Jenkins gained a wider reputation as a &#145;determined and devoted&#146; advocate of birth control and abortion reform  (Dora Russell to Madeleine Simms, 9 Feb 1968, <span class="roman">Dora Russell papers</span>, 345). In 1933 she organized a boisterous meeting at Ealing town hall to oppose a speech by the conservative Catholic writer G. K. Chesterton. But her greatest contribution was as a founding member of the Abortion Law Reform Association (ALRA). Jenkins served as honorary secretary of the association from 1936 until her retirement in 1962. If Janet Chance helped the ALRA as a propagandist and a source of funds, Jenkins was its organizational heart, sustaining it, often in the political wilderness, with an unbending commitment to the cause. She was the principal architect of a grassroots network of sympathetic members of the Women's Co-operative Guild and Labour Party women's sections. She nurtured this network even through the most desperate moments of the war, picking her way through rubble-strewn streets in the middle of the blitz to talk about abortion law reform to a handful of supporters. In the 1950s, after the ALRA had moved its focus to Westminster, Jenkins became a tireless and often fierce parliamentary lobbyist, keeping the abortion issue in the gaze of indifferent or hostile back-benchers. Though she always stressed that she was &#145;strictly non-party&#146;, it is clear that Jenkins's political sympathies lay with the left, particularly with the working women of the Labour Party and the Women's Co-operative Guild, which she saw as the lifeblood of the abortion cause  (Alice Jenkins to Kathleen Child, 13 May 1957, contemporary medical archives, SA/ALR/A3/6/34).<br>
<br>David Steel, the eventual sponsor of the successful 1967 <span class="roman">Abortion Bill</span>, made clear that Jenkins's book <span class="italic">Law for the Rich</span> (1960) had greatly influenced his support for the reform of the abortion law. In this work and an earlier publication, <span class="italic">Conscript Parenthood? the Problem of Secret Abortion</span> (privately printed, 1938), Jenkins set the case for the legalization of abortion in the context of the conditions of working-class life. Abortion, she argued, was a fact of working-class existence because of poor economic conditions and lack of access to other forms of contraception. As the title of her later work suggested, Jenkins maintained that the practice of abortion in Britain was an example of an inequitable law. Middle-class women with means were generally able to obtain a safe, therapeutic abortion, while working-class women had to risk unsafe, illegal abortions in the backstreets. In both books Jenkins also proved herself an indefatigable foe of the religious opinion arrayed against sex reform, in particular the Catholic church. Jenkins believed that abortion should be an acceptable element of respectable life. As she said in <span class="italic">Conscript Parenthood</span>  (p. 72), it was &#145;the decent normal woman&#146; who needed the &#145;relief&#146; of abortion.<br>
<br>Jenkins retired from an active role in the ALRA in 1962, when a younger generation took over its organization. She was also active in other causes, notably as the founder of the Anti-Litter League. As a particularly stout defender of Ealing's cleanliness, she would often apprehend litterers on Ealing Broadway, forcibly returning refuse to its original owners. After working for the reform of the abortion laws for nearly forty years, Alice Jenkins lived to see the achievement of her aim. She died of pneumonia at The Priory, Roehampton, London, on 25 December 1967, eight days after the <span class="roman">Abortion Act</span> had received royal assent.<br>
