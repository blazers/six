<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Sterne,  Richard</span>  (1595/6&#150;1683), <span class="occ">archbishop of York</span>, was the son of Simon Sterne of Mansfield, Nottinghamshire (whose father, William, is said to have migrated there from Suffolk), and his wife, Margery, daughter of Gregory Walker of Mansfield. He was educated at the free school in the town, and on 8 July 1611, aged fifteen, matriculated from Trinity College, Cambridge. He was admitted scholar on 6 May 1614, graduated BA early in 1615, and proceeded MA in 1618. Having been elected fellow of Corpus Christi College in 1620, he proceeded BD in 1625 and was incorporated BD at Oxford on 10 July 1627. He contributed verses to the Cambridge University collection <span class="italic">Genethliacum illustrissimorum principum Caroli &amp; Mariae</span> (1631).<br>
<br>Sterne became chaplain to Archbishop William Laud, probably in 1633, and on 17 November that year was chosen by him to preach at Paul's Cross. On 7 March 1634 he was elected master of Jesus College, Cambridge, and in the same month he was collated by Laud to the rectory of Yeovilton, Somerset. The following year he proceeded DD, and in December 1638 he was made a royal chaplain in ordinary. His wholehearted identification with Laudianism is evident in the support he gave as head of house to two Cambridge zealots, Sylvester Adams, who in 1637 had asserted the necessity of auricular confession in a sermon at Great St Mary's, and William Norwich, who in 1640 claimed that works as well as faith had a part in justification. In 1641 Sterne himself faced charges which included bowing towards the altar, promoting ceremonialism, and teaching the invocation of the saints; he also contributed verses to the Cambridge collection celebrating King Charles's peaceful return in November from Scotland, <span class="italic">Irenodia Cantabrigiensis</span> (1641).<br>
<br>In 1642 Sterne became rector of Harlton, Cambridgeshire, but as an active royalist he did not enjoy his living long. In August that year he arranged for the dispatch of large quantities of college plate to the king, but Oliver Cromwell, engaged as one of the Cambridge burgesses in securing the town for parliament, had him arrested on 11 August with John Barwick and William Beale. They were taken to London&#151;a journey during which they were subject to hostile demonstrations&#151;and, on the order of the House of Commons, committed to the Tower of London. Sterne remained there for nineteen weeks until 12 January 1643, when he was ordered to confine himself to Lord Petre's house in Aldersgate Street. After seven months' imprisonment he was placed on an Ipswich coal ship in the Thames. Shut down beneath the hatches he suffered great privation, and one MP allegedly argued for his transportation to America or Algiers as a slave. After ten days, however, he was put on shore and confined in Ely House.<br>
<br>Meanwhile Sterne was sequestered from his livings, and in March 1644 he was ejected by the earl of Manchester from the mastership of Jesus College. On 7 January 1645, at Laud's request, he was permitted by parliament to attend the archbishop in the Tower, and he was with him from 8 January until his execution on 10 January. Notes of Sterne's conversations with Laud during this time were printed in Laud's <span class="italic">Works</span>, and the written address which Laud read from the scaffold was handed to him by Sterne, under whose supervision it was eventually printed at the end of Laud's <span class="italic">Summary of Devotion</span> (1667).<br>
<br>Soon afterwards Sterne regained his liberty. He maintained himself over the next fifteen years by keeping a school at Stevenage, Hertfordshire. Lord Scudamore allowed him &pound;20 a year, and on 4 December 1646 his wife, Elizabeth (1616/17&#150;1674), was allowed by the committee for plundered ministers a fifth of the profits of Harlton and Yeovilton. Elizabeth, whom he had married at an unknown date, was the daughter of Edward Dickinson, lord of the manor of Farnborough; they had thirteen children, including Richard (<i>d</i>. 1700) and Simon, grandfather of Laurence Sterne (1713&#150;1768), the novelist. Sterne continued to engage in scholarly activity: in 1649 he published, as the work of &#145;a reverend divine of pious memory&#146;, <span class="italic">A Brief Commentary upon the ciij Psalme</span>, and he assisted in the preparation of Brian Walton's <span class="italic">Biblia sacra polyglotta</span> (1657). The canard that he was also associated with the popular manual of piety <span class="italic">The Whole Duty of Man</span>, first published in 1658, has long been laid to rest, and that book is now ascribed to Richard Allestree.<br>
<br>At the Restoration, Sterne was singled out for preferment. He was reinstated in the mastership of Jesus College, but treated his predecessor with civility and left him in effective control for several months. On 9 October 1660 he was elected bishop of Carlisle; he was consecrated on 2 January 1661 and enthroned on 4 January. Green describes him as one of the &#145;hardliners&#146; appointed to the episcopate to reassure the episcopalian zealots  (Green, 97). From April to July 1661 he attended the Savoy conference. Wrote Richard Baxter:<blockquote>Among all the bishops there was none who had so promising a face as Dr Sterne, the bishop of Carlisle. He look'd so honestly, and gravely, and soberly, that I scarce thought a face could have deceived me; and when I was entreating them not to cast out so many of their brethren through the nation, as scrupeled a ceremony which they confessed indifferent, he turn'd to the rest of the Reverent Bishops and noted me for saying &#145;in the nation&#146;. &#145;He will not say &#147;in the kingdom&#148;&#146;, saith he, &#145;lest he own a king&#146;. This was all I ever heard that worthy bishop say. But with grief I told him that half the charity which became so grave a bishop might have sufficed to have helpt him to a better exposition of the word. (<span class="italic">Reliquiae Baxterianae</span>, 2.305)</blockquote>On 5 March 1662 convocation entrusted the revision of the <span class="roman">Book of Common Prayer</span> to Sterne, Bishop George Griffith of St Asaph, and Bishop Brian Walton of Chester.<br>
<br>As bishop of Carlisle, Sterne reckoned that he had forgone &pound;1800 in fine income to augment the stipends of some of his clergy. However, he left the bishopric in some disarray. His successor, Edward Rainbowe, began a lawsuit against him over dilapidations at Rose Castle, the bishop of Carlisle's palace. Archbishop Gilbert Sheldon's letter-book contains papers on the case which began in August 1669, produced a commissioners' report in 1671, and concluded with an order to Sterne to pay &pound;400 towards rebuilding the castle's chapel in June 1672.<br>
<br>In 1664 Sterne was translated to the archbishopric of York, being elected on 28 April and confirmed on 10 June. His archiepiscopate has apparently left little record beyond his visitation articles, published in 1669. He was loyal to the church and monarchy, an assiduous attender at the House of Lords, and a zealous supporter of the duke of York. Such toryism ensured an extremely hostile notice from Gilbert Burnet, who accused Sterne of being &#145;a sour ill-tempered man&#146;, interested only in the enrichment of his own family, and of being such a Yorkist that he was suspected of popery  (<span class="italic">Burnet's History</span>, 2.430&#150;1). Little of this is to be regarded as reliable testimony.<br>
<br>Elizabeth Sterne died in London on 6 March 1674, aged fifty-seven, and was buried at Farnborough. Archbishop Sterne himself died at Bishopthorpe, aged eighty-seven, on 18 June 1683, and was buried in St Stephen's Chapel, York Minster. His bequests were generous. He left plate to York Minster, &pound;1850 towards the rebuilding of St Paul's Cathedral, &pound;40 a year to found four scholarships at Jesus College, Cambridge, and &pound;20 a year to found two scholarships at Corpus Christi. His <span class="italic">Summa logicae</span> appeared in 1685.<br>
