<span class="headword">Danquah, Joseph Boakye</span>  (1895&#150;1965), <span class="occ">lawyer and politician in Ghana</span>, was born on 21 December 1895 at Bepong, Kwawu, Gold Coast, the son of Emmanuel Yaw Boakye Danquah (<i>d</i>. 1907) and his second wife, Lydia Okom Korantemaa. His royal father had been chief state drummer to the king of Akyem Abuakwa but had become a Presbyterian adherent of the Basel Mission; at great personal risk he had exchanged the palace for evangelism at the age of forty. Danquah was educated in Basel Mission schools and in 1913 was employed as a clerk with a prominent African barrister, Vidal Buckle, in Accra. In 1914 he passed the local civil service examination and became a clerk in the supreme court. In 1915 his older half-brother Nana Ofori Atta, the king or <i>okyenhene</i> of Akyem Abuakwa, appointed him first secretary and then in 1916 chief clerk and registrar of the native court in Akyem's capital, Kyebi. In this period Danquah collected the information that he later used in two of his finest books, <span class="italic">Cases in Akan Law</span> and <span class="italic">Akan Laws and Customs</span> (both 1928). These contributions to comparative law and anthropology were in the great tradition of Ghanaian legal writing established in the nineteenth century by John Mensah Sarba and continued by J. E. Casely Hayford. Danquah also wrote a celebration of his kingdom and his king, <span class="italic">The Akim Abuakwa Handbook</span> (1928), <span class="italic">Ancestors, Heroes and God</span> (1938), and <span class="italic">The Akan Doctrine of God</span> (1941).<br>
<br>Initially antagonistic to the aims of anti-colonial organizations in the Gold Coast because of his king's hostility to them, Danquah was by 1921 moving closer to the aims of the Aborigines' Rights Protection Society (ARPS). At the suggestion of one of the most prominent leaders of the ARPS, the lawyer and politician Kobina Sekyi, Danquah decided that he should read law. This won the support of his king and in 1921 he left for Britain. He studied philosophy and law at University College, London and ate dinners in the Inner Temple. By 1927 he had managed to graduate as a bachelor of arts, a bachelor of laws, and a doctor of philosophy and had been called to the bar. He was also involved in anti-colonial politics in London, and was one of the founder members of the West African Students' Union and editor of its journal.<br>
<br>In 1927 Danquah returned to the Gold Coast where he established a legal practice. Increasingly committed to nationalism, he founded and then edited the daily <span class="italic">Times of West Africa</span>. In 1930 he was the moving force behind the new anti-colonial Gold Coast Youth Conference. In 1934 he returned to Britain as secretary to a deputation of chiefs and intellectuals petitioning the secretary of state for the colonies to refuse his assent to a new, restrictive <span class="roman">Sedition Bill</span>. The deputation failed. Danquah was now at odds with his royal half-brother whom he suspected of being hostile to the nationalism with which he himself was increasingly identified. He remained in Britain until 1936, spending much of his time in the British Museum's reading room researching African history. That research led him to the conclusion that the Akan, his own ethnic group, were the relicts of the ancient empire of Ghana. This argument gained local currency eventually and led to an independent Gold Coast choosing to be known as Ghana from 1957.<br>
<br>On his return to Accra in 1936 Danquah maintained his nationalism and was one of the most formidable proponents of rapid democratization and the end of British colonial rule. While continuing his legal practice, he also revived his newspaper, wrote plays and innumerable scholarly and more popular articles, and acted, somewhat uncomfortably, as legal adviser to his half-brother. He had also married Mabel, the daughter of one of the country's most eminent lawyers, Frans Dove. Both before and after their later divorce she was among the Gold Coast's most influential women intellectuals and political activists. She also became a lifelong political adversary of Danquah. His second wife, Elizabeth, died in 1987. He had numerous children, both legitimate and illegitimate.<br>
<br>In 1947 the tempo of anti-colonial politics picked up after an unofficial truce during the Second World War. Unpersuaded that the reformed constitution of 1946 amounted to progress and increasingly alienated from the colonial regime, Danquah, a nephew, the husband of one of his nieces, and a cluster of intellectuals and businessmen formed the United Gold Coast Convention (UGCC) in August 1947. The first modern nationalist party in the country's history, the UGCC demanded &#145;self government in the shortest possible time&#146;. It invited a London-based student, Kwame Nkrumah, to act as its general secretary. Although the evidence shows they played little part in fomenting the pivotal urban riots of February and March 1948, Danquah and other senior figures in the UGCC were illegally detained under emergency regulations. After their release the more conservative nationalists of the UGCC and their more radical, dynamic general secretary began to pull apart. Depending upon which account one believes, Nkrumah and his lieutenants were either expelled or elected to leave the UGCC in June 1949 and founded their own party, the Convention People's Party (CPP).<br>
<br>This brought into public gaze a serious rift in the nationalist movement between gradualists and socialists. Danquah was to remain the most prominent spokesman of conservative nationalism until his death, a tradition which is still evident in modern Ghanaian politics. His antagonist was Kwame Nkrumah. It was a personal as well as an intellectual animosity. Danquah was prominent in a sequence of unsuccessful political alliances which failed to gain significant votes in each of the colonial general elections (1951, 1954, and 1956) which led to independence in March 1957. He lost his parliamentary seat in the 1954 election. Outflanked by the greater organizational skills and popular attraction of the CPP which governed Ghana from 1954 until deposed by a military coup in 1966, Danquah was condemned to watch his arch-enemy flourish. Although respected professionally&#151;he was elected president of the Ghana Bar Association in 1963 and was a fellow of the Ghana Academy of Arts and Sciences&#151;he remained on the losing side. He stood against Nkrumah in the election for a president when Ghana opted to become a republic in 1960 but polled no more than 10 per cent of the votes in a somewhat suspect electoral process. Ghana's most internationally respected intellectual and a founding father of the nationalist movement had been humiliated.<br>
<br>Suffering from hypertension and asthma, Danquah was detained under Ghana's <span class="roman">Preventive Detention Act</span> in 1961 and was released in 1962. He was again detained in 1964 and died in his cell in Nsawam gaol, 80 miles north of Accra, on 4 February 1965, gasping for breath and unattended by a doctor he had begged to see. He was buried in Akyem Abuakwa. He is commemorated in Accra by an imposing statue on that city's ring road. The statue portrays him in traditional cloth leaning on a pile of books.<br>
