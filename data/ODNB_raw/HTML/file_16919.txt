<span class="headword">Loder,  John David</span>  (1788&#150;1846), <span class="occ">violinist</span>, was born at Bath, the son of John Loder (<i>d</i>. 1795), a musician. Loder was a member of a musical family long resident in Bath, and was himself at the head of his profession there for many years. After initially playing in concert orchestras, he appeared as the first violin in a string quartet at the New Assembly Rooms on 4 April 1800, and from 1799 to 1836 was a member, and for most of that time leader, of the orchestra of the Theatre Royal. Famous musicians from London often attended his annual benefit night at the theatre, and Angelica Catalani, the celebrated Italian soprano, appeared with him at a concert on 7 October 1821. It is reported that she returned her fee &#145;as a small tribute of regard for his private worth, and high professional skill&#146;  (<span class="italic">New Grove</span>). He left the theatre in 1836 after a disagreement, but returned in 1840&#150;41.<br>
<br>Among other engagements Loder was leader of the Yorkshire music festival (15 September 1825, alongside Franz Cramer, Mori, and Kiesewetter), soloist at the Gloucester music festival (1826), and leader at the Three Choirs festival (1826&#150;45). He was also, from 12 May 1817, the first Englishman to lead the orchestra at the Philharmonic Society of London, which, according to Temperley, he appears to have done at least once a year. His business as a music publisher and seller of musical instruments operated from 46 Milsom Street, Bath, from around 1820 to 1835. He subsequently resided in London and, in 1840, became professor of violin at the Royal Academy of Music. He also performed in the Ancient Concerts, succeeding Cramer as leader in 1845. His thorough knowledge of orchestral and chamber music made his services especially sought after for the performance of new and intricate works.<br>
<br>Loder's role as a successful teacher of the violin and viola should not be overlooked, and his <span class="italic">General and Comprehensive Instruction Book for the Violin</span> (<i>c.</i>1824) was one of the first detailed and systematic English violin methods, appearing in a revised and enlarged version as late as 1911. Other works included violin duets (1837), a treatise on bowing (1842), and various arrangements.<br>
<br>Loder died at Albany Street, Regent's Park, London, on 13 February 1846. He and his wife, a Miss Mills, the stepdaughter of the comic actor <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9222/', "John Fawcett")</script>, had five sons and two daughters. The second son, <a name="cosubject_16919"></a><span class="headword">John Fawcett Loder</span>  (1812&#150;1853)<span class="occ"></span>, was a violinist and viola player, who became a successful music teacher and concert director in Bath. He was a member of various London orchestras and played viola in Blagrove and Dando's Quartet Concerts from 1842 until his death, which occurred suddenly in Hawley Crescent, London, on 16 April 1853. His younger brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16916/', "Edward James Loder (1809&#150;1865)")</script> was a successful composer, principally of theatrical works.<br>
