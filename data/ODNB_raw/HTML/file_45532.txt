<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Diggle,  Joseph Robert</span>  (1849&#150;1917), <span class="occ">educational administrator</span>, was born at Canal Bank, Pendleton, Lancashire, on 12 May 1849, the youngest son of William Diggle, a warehouseman, and his wife, Nancy Ann, daughter of John Chadderton. His elder brother, John William Diggle (1847&#150;1920), became bishop of Carlisle. He was educated at Manchester grammar school and Wadham College, Oxford, where he gained first-class honours in modern history. Ordained in 1874, he was curate of St Matthew's, Liverpool, before becoming in 1876 curate of St Mary's, Bryanston Square, London, whose rector was William Henry Fremantle (1831&#150;1916). In 1878 he married Jane Wilkinson Macrae, daughter of John Wrigley Macrae of Aigburth, Liverpool; they had a family of two sons and two daughters.<br>
<br>Resigning his curacy, Diggle was elected in 1879 to the London school board (LSB) as member for the Marylebone division. He dominated the proceedings of the board between 1885 and 1894 when he was its chairman and leader of the Moderate (that is, Conservative) party. His oratorical skills evinced a strong and abrasive manner, while he was adroit in the management of committees. He was opposed by the Progressive Party on the board, and its leader Edward Lyulph Stanley, whom Diggle accused of extravagance in the running of the board's schools. During the period of Diggle's ascendancy, the progressives coined the term &#145;Diggleism&#146; to denote his alleged parsimonious approach to educational expenditure, a critique set out in a booklet, <span class="italic">The Case Against Diggleism</span> (1894). It was claimed that in order to help Anglican schools compete against secular board schools, he had deliberately neglected school accommodation, equipment, and teachers' welfare. Differences between the parties became particularly acrimonious during the early 1890s as a result of allegations about the state of religious education in board schools by the Revd J. J. Coxhead and a young Anglican lawyer, Athelstan Riley. The resulting storm led to the breakdown of the W. H. Smith compromise of 1871 concerning the teaching of scripture in LSB schools and the eventual unseating of Diggle as leader of the Moderates after their defeat in the 1894 school board election. He lost his seat on the board in 1897.<br>
<br>Diggle attempted to enter national politics, standing as an independent candidate for West Marylebone in November 1885 so as to test the eligibility of clergy to enter parliament; he polled 101 votes. Having relinquished his orders in 1889 under the <span class="roman">Clerical Disabilities Act</span>, he stood as a Conservative for Camberwell North in October 1900 but was defeated by the Liberal T. J. Macnamara, a former bitter opponent from the LSB. His wider interests in education and social issues connected with it were expressed in ninety-three letters to <span class="italic">The Times</span>. From 1906 to 1908 he was chairman of the council of the Ragged School Union and of the Shaftesbury Society.<br>
<br>Diggle left London to live in Tenterden, Kent, where he was mayor, 1896&#150;8, and chairman of the Kent elementary schools education committee in 1908. An inveterate committee man, he was chairman of the council of the Royal Botanic Society in 1907, an honorary fellow of the British Institution of Public Health, a corresponding member of the Society of Public Medicine of Belgium in 1891, and a section president at the international congresses of hygiene and demography held at London (1892) and Budapest (1894). His last seven years were spent in Oxford where he died at 24 Merton Street on 16 January 1917. His wife survived him.<br>
