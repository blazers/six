<span class="headword">Sherborn <span class="st"> [Sherborne]</span>,  Robert</span>  (<em>c.</em>1454&#150;1536), <span class="occ">bishop of Chichester</span>, was born at Basingstoke, Hampshire, admitted as a scholar of Winchester College in 1465, and went to New College, Oxford, in 1472, where he was a fellow until 1486. He graduated BA in 1477, and subsequently MA and BM. He was the scribe (secretary) to the university, <i>c</i>.1480&#150;86. An example of his hand survives in his transcription of 1481 of a Salernitan medical text  (Edinburgh University Library, MS 169).<br>
<br>While still at Oxford, in 1482, Sherborn received a prebend of Salisbury Cathedral. When in 1486 he became secretary to Archbishop John Morton of Canterbury (<i>d</i>. 1500), further preferment followed rapidly, although, surprisingly, he received no benefices in Canterbury diocese. In 1486 he became treasurer of Hereford, and in successive years from 1488 to 1490 received prebends at Lincoln, St Paul's, and Wells. In 1492 he was admitted as warden of Kingsthorpe Hospital, Northamptonshire, and master of St Cross Hospital, Winchester. As well as various rectories thereafter (the first, Childrey in Berkshire, was granted in March 1491), he secured a prebend at Chichester. In the diocese of Lincoln he was successively archdeacon of Huntingdon (1494&#150;6) and Buckingham (1496&#150;1505); he was also archdeacon of Taunton (1496&#150;1505), and in 1499 (when he was ordained subdeacon) was elected dean of St Paul's. Only on 6 March 1501 was he ordained priest.<br>
<br>Between 1490 and 1492 Sherborn administered for the archbishop during vacancies in the sees of Lichfield, Hereford, Wells, Exeter, and Winchester. In 1494 he first appears in royal service, supervising the building of the new tower at Portsmouth. By 1496 he was secretary and councillor to Henry VII, and in July of that year he conducted his first diplomatic mission to Rome, where he was sent to signify the king's willingness to join the Holy League. He returned there in 1504 to seek from Julius II (<i>r</i>. 1503&#150;13) a papal dispensation for the marriage of Prince Henry to the widowed Katherine of Aragon. On his first visit he became warden of the English hospice, which was now transformed by Henry VII into a royal institution. Although Sherborn acted by deputy, he drew up new statutes, remedied the dangerous financial situation, and spent lavishly on the reconstruction of the church, rededicated in 1501.<br>
<br>Back in England, between 1498 and 1500 Sherborn was engaged in the exaction of heavy fines on the west-country adherents of Perkin Warbeck, and in summer 1503 was one of the commissioners who treated with Scottish envoys about Princess Margaret's dowry. In the new reign, and after his elevation to the episcopate, his diplomatic role was more ceremonial; he received Cardinal Campeggi in Kent in 1518 and again in 1528, while in 1522 he was sent to greet Charles V (<i>r</i>. 1519&#150;56) at Calais and escort him to London.<br>
<br>On 5 January 1505 Sherborn was provided by the pope to the see of St David's. Allegations that he forged the bull of provision were undoubtedly a gross exaggeration. The point at issue&#151;an erasure and the inflation of the income of St Cross, Winchester, which he was to retain but which he also restored&#151;was magnified to suit the interests of competing ecclesiastical factions in England and at Rome. Sherborn was vigorously supported by the king, and was consecrated on 11 May 1505. Within three years Henry VII was pressing for his translation to Chichester, to which he was provided by Julius II on 18 September 1508.<br>
<br>Analysis of the records of Sherborn's administration at Chichester has shown that he was an active and effective diocesan bishop. He engaged upon a campaign to increase episcopal authority by a thoroughgoing reform of the church courts, which were amalgamated so as to eliminate competing jurisdictions, and he was prepared to pay Cardinal Wolsey to preserve their independence from legatine intervention. He was active as diocesan in monastic visitation, in which he had been well trained as Morton's commissary, and was also commissioned by Wolsey to conduct the legatine visitation of Premonstratensian Bayham, Sussex. He made a concerted attempt both to improve the condition of the fabric of parish churches, and to maintain and foster the standards of pastoral ministry. He was greatly assisted by administrators recruited from the alumni of New College, and in 1524 he founded in his cathedral church four new &#145;Wiccamical&#146; prebends, reserved for former scholars of Winchester and New College. To the latter foundation he gave a message at Harrow, Middlesex, to provide for masses for the scholars' souls, and land near High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire, to provide a stipend for a scholar. A visitor in 1526 complimented the furbishment of his episcopal palace and its fine grounds. Sherborn also oversaw, and was most probably responsible for commissioning, two large historical panel paintings for the cathedral. The panels (<i>c</i>.1535&#150;6) were the work of Lambert Barnard and depict former bishops and kings of England.<br>
<br>By the time of the crisis of the early 1530s Sherborn was a very old man, described in 1532 as &#145;aged and sickly&#146;  (<span class="italic">LP Henry VIII</span>, 5.506), although in 1535 as &#145;in good health and merry&#146;  (<span class="italic">LP Henry VIII</span>, 8.402). He was by generation and inclination a member of the &#145;conservative episcopate&#146;, but he bowed to reality by renouncing papal jurisdiction on 26 February 1534, and on 15 June 1535 preached personally in Chichester Cathedral when announcing the king's supreme headship of the Church of England. On 1 June, however, he was examined by Dr Richard Layton (<i>d</i>. 1544), and in early June of the next year, at the king's request, he resigned his see. On the following 21 August he died at Chichester, and was buried in an altar tomb, with alabaster effigy, in the south ambulatory of the cathedral choir. His last will, orthodox in tone and sentiment, was made nineteen days before his death, and proved on 24 November 1536. His career is an excellent example of one who laboured hard in the service both of his king and of the universal church, in the last years when such loyalties were compatible.<br>
