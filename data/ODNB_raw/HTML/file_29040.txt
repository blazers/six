<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Wendover,  Roger  of</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1236), <span class="occ">historian and prior of Belvoir</span>, was a monk of St Albans, who was probably associated with Wendover in Buckinghamshire and possibly a kinsman of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/23521/', "Richard of Wendover")</script>, a physician to Pope Gregory IX (<i>r</i>. 1227&#150;41). Roger became prior of Belvoir, a Leicestershire cell of St Albans, but was deposed in consequence of a visitation, conducted in or shortly after 1219, during which his abbot, William of Trumpington, is said to have concluded that Roger &#145;had wasted the property of the church in careless prodigality&#146;  (<span class="italic">Gesta abbatum</span>, 1.270). After his departure from Belvoir, Roger of Wendover presumably returned to the monastic community at St Albans, where he died on 6 May 1236. It was probably in this last period of his life that he established himself as one of the most significant members of the St Albans school of historiography.<br>
<br>From the available evidence it can only be demonstrated that Roger of Wendover started to write his <span class="italic">Flores historiarum</span> at some date between 1204 and 1231, and that he had not ceased to work on the text by 1234. It is, however, probable that he was actually involved in the compilation of his chronicle in the period between about 1220 and his death in 1236.<br>
<br>The <span class="italic">Flores historiarum</span> is a work that can be divided into three sections whose analysis reveals that Roger of Wendover's original contribution to the text grew as its production became more contemporaneous with the events it describes. In the first section, the coverage of the period from the creation to 1202 is essentially based on a compilation of well-known authorities, such as Bede, Henry of Huntingdon, Roger of Howden, and Ralph de Diceto, which Roger of Wendover may have inherited from a single St Albans text to which one or more St Albans historians had already contributed. In the second section, which basically involves the description of John's reign after 1202, Roger of Wendover began to make his own mark on the <span class="italic">Flores historiarum</span> by interlacing at least some of his own observations with those that he borrowed from such other works as the lost source that he shared with the thirteenth-century author of the <span class="italic">Annales sancti Edmundi</span>, and another set of annals which he found at the end of what is now BL, Royal MS 13 E. vi, the St Albans copy of the work of Ralph de Diceto. It is therefore only in the third and final section of the text, which covers the period from near the end of John's reign to May 1234, that there is unambiguous evidence that the chronicle is primarily based on Roger of Wendover's own historiographical approach.<br>
<br>Commentators on Roger of Wendover's <span class="italic">Flores historiarum</span> have often expressed their disappointment with the quality of various aspects of his historical writing. Inaccuracies in his identification of people and places and in his transmission of documents, such as <span class="roman">Magna Carta</span>, have been painstakingly indicated. His style has been described as clear, but bald. His learning has been denounced as shallow. His narrative has been found to be lacking in vigour. Such criticisms have largely arisen from the succession of comparisons that have been made between the <span class="italic">Flores historiarum</span> and the work of Matthew Paris who succeeded Roger of Wendover as St Albans' principal historian. Although there can be little argument that the <span class="italic">Chronica majora</span> of Matthew Paris is a more interesting piece of historiography than Roger of Wendover's <span class="italic">Flores historiarum</span>, it is, however, equally evident that Matthew Paris owed much to a predecessor whose work not only provided him with a wealth of material, which was similarly used by other authors, such as the anonymous annalists of Norwich and Waverley and Nicholas Trevet, but also introduced him to certain historiographical techniques which became important features of his own chronicle. It was, for example, through Roger of Wendover's knowledge of Roger of Howden's writing that Matthew Paris came to adopt the convention of beginning each annal with a record of where the king spent Christmas and ending each annal with a summary of the events of the year.<br>
<br>Matthew Paris did not, however, only learn &#145;his profession, as a historian, from Roger of Wendover&#146;  (Vaughan, 34), for his reading of the <span class="italic">Flores historiarum</span> also shaped Paris's political outlook by encouraging him to develop that set of grievances and beliefs that he parades so emphatically in his writings. On occasions the examination of these prejudices has been clouded by anachronistic attempts to endow them with the sort of constitutional coherence, as a systematic apologia for baronial opposition to Plantagenet despotism, that has given the St Albans scriptorium an undeserved place in the development of political theory. There can, nevertheless, be little doubt that Matthew Paris's homiletic defence of the Benedictinism of St Albans was, in part, a product of the inspiration that he derived from the intense interest shown by Roger of Wendover in miracles and other spiritual matters. The unqualified reverence accorded to St Francis in the <span class="italic">Flores historiarum</span> is, for example, more than matched in the <span class="italic">Chronica majora</span> in which, despite his growing hostility towards the mendicant orders, Matthew Paris chose to add a moving picture of the receipt of the stigmata to Roger of Wendover's unequivocally sympathetic account of the saint and his canonization.<br>
<br>These common spiritual concerns have attracted relatively little attention from those historians who have committed themselves to detailed analyses of the extent to which Matthew Paris's anti-governmental attitudes were foreshadowed in the writing of Roger of Wendover. Such historians have, however, successfully demonstrated that, although the highly critical view of King John in the <span class="italic">Flores historiarum</span> may well have been paralleled in a lost early version of Ralph of Coggeshall's <span class="italic">Chronicon Anglicanum</span>, and was certainly present in embryo in the works of such authors as Roger of Howden, Richard of Devizes, and Gervase of Canterbury, who did not have the benefit of knowing the later events of the reign, it was essentially Roger of Wendover's literary portrait of John that had most influence on Matthew Paris. That portrait was of a king who was so incapable of controlling himself that, shortly after the granting of <span class="roman">Magna Carta</span>, he went, dumbfounded and in great consternation, to the Isle of Wight, where he stayed for three months on the sea-shore and in the company of sailors, pondering how he might revenge himself upon his barons. This particular story is totally fictitious in that John never went near the Isle of Wight in the relevant period. Nevertheless it constitutes one of the most impressive images of John that St Albans produced. Furthermore, its treatment, in the <span class="italic">Chronica majora</span>, exemplifies the way in which Matthew Paris reacted to Roger of Wendover's work, in that the tale is as it is in the <span class="italic">Flores historiarum</span> except that John now &#145;burns with rage&#146;, and &#145;plots&#146; rather than &#145;ponders&#146; his revenge.<br>
<br>Matthew Paris's approach to Henry III was equally dependent upon Roger of Wendover's initial depiction of John's successor, since the basic elements of the <span class="italic">Flores historiarum</span>'s description of the king as a simple man who showed too much favour to foreigners and refused to live off his customary revenues are again adopted and then embellished, sometimes through the <span class="italic">Chronica majora</span>'s use of an apt quotation or an illustrative verse, but, more often, through its employment of a cluster of pejorative adjectives. As the <span class="italic">Chronica majora</span>'s coverage of events approaches the period during which Matthew Paris was himself active as a historian, his editorial enhancement of the <span class="italic">Flores historiarum</span> becomes more substantial. It is nevertheless evident, from any comprehensive comparison of the two texts, that Roger of Wendover was the most influential mentor of the most readable, if not the most gifted, of England's late medieval chroniclers.<br>
<br>Roger of Wendover's <span class="italic">Flores historiarum</span> survives, in its own right, in Bodl. Oxf., MS Douce 207, of <i>c</i>.1300, and BL, Cotton MS Otho B.v, of <i>c</i>.1350. Important derivatives are, however, also extant in the first two of the three original manuscripts of Matthew Paris's <span class="italic">Chronica majora</span>&#151;Cambridge, Corpus Christi College, MS 26, and Cambridge, Corpus Christi College, MS 16&#151;and in the shortest of Matthew Paris's abridged versions of the <span class="italic">Chronica majora</span>, of which a text, closely associated with its author, survives in BL, Cotton MS Vitellius A.xx.<br>
<br>There is no complete printed edition of the <span class="italic">Flores historiarum</span>. It has been edited from <i>c</i>.447 onwards by H. O. Coxe and from 1154 onwards by H. G. Hewlett. H. R. Luard's edition of Matthew Paris's <span class="italic">Chronica majora</span> also attempts to identify what the editor assumed to be its author's borrowings from the <span class="italic">Flores historiarum</span>. None of these editions is, however, totally satisfactory, since it is clear that both the common source of the texts of the <span class="italic">Flores historiarum</span> in Bodl. Oxf., MS Douce 207, and BL, Cotton MS Otho B.v, and the text that survives in the first two original manuscripts of the <span class="italic">Chronica majora</span>, share a lost common source in an early recension of the <span class="italic">Flores historiarum</span>, and this can only be reconstructed through the resolution of every conflict between the texts derived from it, and through a detailed analysis of the status of the borrowings from Roger of Wendover's work in BL, Cotton MS Vitellius A.xx.<br>
