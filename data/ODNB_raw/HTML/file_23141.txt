<span class="headword">Ranyard,  Arthur Cowper</span>  (1845&#150;1894), <span class="occ">astronomer</span>, born at Swanscombe, Kent, on 21 June 1845, was the son of Benjamin Ranyard (1792/3&#150;1879), a barge owner, and his wife, Ellen Henrietta White (1810&#150;1879), the founder of the Biblewoman Movement [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/23142/', "Ranyard, Ellen Henrietta")</script>]. He attended University College School, London, from 1857 to 1860, then went on to University College. Here the influence of Professor Augustus De Morgan led him to concentrate his attention on mathematics and astronomy, and he formed a close friendship with the professor's son George. In 1864 the two young men formed the plan for a society for the special study of mathematics, and issued a circular inviting attendance at the first meeting of &#145;the University College Mathematical Society&#146; on 7 November 1864. The first meeting was actually held on 16 January 1865, when, after Professor De Morgan's presidential address, Ranyard read the first paper, &#145;On determinants&#146;. The new association received the support of eminent mathematicians, and ultimately developed into the London Mathematical Society.<br>
<br>Ranyard entered Pembroke College, Cambridge, in October 1865 and graduated MA in 1868. Having adopted the law as his profession he was called to the bar at Lincoln's Inn in 1871, but his tastes lay in the direction of science, and his means enabled him to devote much of his time to astronomy. He became a fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society in 1863, and served on its council (1872&#150;88 and 1892&#150;4) and as secretary (1874&#150;80). He was assistant secretary of the expedition for observing the total solar eclipse of 1870, and made a successful series of polariscopic observations at Villasmunda in Sicily. In 1878 he went to Colorado to view the solar eclipse of that year, which he observed and photographed at a station near Denver. In 1882 he observed and photographed the total solar eclipse at Sohag in Upper Egypt. His most extensive work in astronomy was the eclipse volume of the Royal Astronomical Society (commenced in 1871 and completed in 1879), in which are systematized and discussed the observations of all solar eclipses down to 1878. It was originally begun in conjunction with Sir George Airy, but soon devolved on Ranyard alone.<br>
<br>In 1888 Ranyard's friend Richard Anthony Proctor died, leaving his great work, <span class="italic">Old and New Astronomy</span>, incomplete. Ranyard generously undertook to finish it for the benefit of the author's family, and wrote chapters on the universe of stars, the construction of the Milky Way, and the distribution of nebulae, which he discussed with much ability and thoroughness. He also succeeded Proctor as editor of <span class="italic">Knowledge</span>, a popular journal dealing with astronomy and natural sciences, to which he contributed a long series of articles on astronomy, giving his mature views on many intricate problems. His most important investigations were those on nebulae, the density of which he concluded to be extremely low, even as compared with the earth's atmosphere, and on star clusters, which he regarded as showing evidence of the ejection of matter from a centre, and not gradual condensation, as supposed by Laplace.<br>
<br>Although mainly engaged in scientific pursuits, Ranyard took much interest in public affairs, and in 1892 was elected a member of the London county council, where he sat on the committee dealing with the new <span class="roman">(London) Building Act</span>, which passed into law in the summer of 1894. Ranyard resigned that year due to ill health.<br>
<br>In 1872, in conjunction with Lord Lindsay (twenty-sixth earl of Crawford), Ranyard undertook experiments on photographic irradiation, and in 1886 he investigated the relation between brightness of object, time of exposure, and intensity of photographic action.<br>
<br>Ranyard, who was unmarried, lived a somewhat retired life of laborious industry. He was a man of generous spirit, extremely conscientious and completely devoted to duty. He died of stomach cancer at his home, 13 Hunter Street, Brunswick Square, London, on 14 December 1894, and was buried in the cemetery at Kingston upon Thames on 19 December.<br>
