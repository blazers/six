</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Bowring, Sir  John</span>  (1792&#150;1872), <span class="occ">politician, diplomatist, and writer</span>, was born on 17 October 1792 at Larkbeare (also known as Great Larkbeare), Holloway Street, Exeter, Devon, the eldest son and second of the nine children of Charles Bowring (1769&#150;1856), a wool merchant, and his wife, Sarah Jane Anne (<i>d</i>. 1828), daughter of the Revd Thomas Lane, vicar of St Ives, Cornwall. His mother was an Anglican, but John Bowring, like his father and the rest of the family, was a Unitarian and, as such, subject to restrictions on participation by dissenters in public life until the repeal of the <span class="roman">Test Acts</span> in 1828. He was educated first at Mr Bowden's school in Paris Street, Exeter, and then for two years at a Unitarian boarding-school at Moretonhampstead, on Dartmoor. He began work at the age of thirteen, first as a clerk in his father's wool business and then in the counting-house of the local firm of Kennaway &amp; Co. The presence of foreign traders on the Exeter quayside gave him the opportunity of learning and practising languages. He attended the evening study group of Dr Lant Carpenter, minister of George's Meeting-House, the Unitarian chapel in South Street, Exeter. In June 1811 he joined the London branch of Milford &amp; Co., suppliers to the duke of Wellington's forces in the Iberian peninsula. In his early years in London, Bowring lodged near Cheapside, but he soon established links with Hackney, which was then a centre of Unitarianism. He already knew several European languages, and his ability to speak Spanish resulted in 1813 in his first journey abroad, when his firm chose him to go to the area of hostilities near San Sebastian with cargoes of stores for the army. He remained in northern Spain and southern France until late 1814, before returning to London. In 1815 he travelled to Portugal to negotiate settlement of an outstanding claim for supplies to the army. In Unitarian circles in Hackney he had met the family of Samuel Lewin, a corn merchant in the City, and on 16 September 1816 at Hackney he married Lewin's daughter, Maria (1793/4&#150;1858). The couple took up residence in a smart area of Hackney near London Fields, and their first child, Maria, was born at Hackney in 1818. They also had five sons, John, Frederick, Lewin, Edgar, and Charles, born between 1821 and 1828, and three more daughters, Edith, Emily, and Gertrude, born in the 1830s.<h2>
<a name="Earlycareer"></a>Early career</h2>With Henry Murdoch, in 1817 Bowring established the firm of Bowring &amp; Co. at 23 Bucklersbury, Cheapside, dealing principally in the shipment of herrings to France and the Iberian peninsula, and the importation of wines. In 1819 he travelled to Spain, France, and the Netherlands, extending his business interests. After a brief period back with his family, he set off again late that year on a tour of northern Europe, passing through Germany to Russia and returning through Scandinavia. Among the celebrities he met in St Petersburg was Friedrich Adelung (1768&#150;1843), who supplied him with German and English prose translations of Russian verse, which he put into English verse for his <span class="italic">Specimens of the Russian Poets</span> (2 vols., 1820; rev. 2nd edn, 1821). In August 1820 his friend and fellow radical Edward Blaquiere introduced him to Jeremy Bentham, who was delighted to find in Bowring a new disciple. In July 1821 Bowring again set out for the continent on a commercial mission, from which he returned in 1822. Later that year he travelled to Paris, where he developed an association with the Orleanist circle. On arriving at Calais on 5 October on his way home, accompanied by Blaquiere, he was detained and taken to a gaol in Boulogne, accused of complicity in an attempt to secure the release of four sergeants of La Rochelle (who were executed for singing republican songs) and of carrying sealed letters of a treasonable nature. Blaquiere made for England, and following the intervention of Canning, the foreign secretary, Bowring was released, but banned from France. He published his version of the episode in <span class="italic">Details of the Arrest, Imprisonment and Liberation of an Englishman</span> (1823).<br>
<br>Bowring was secretary of the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/95072', "London Greek Committee")</script>, founded in 1823 to assist the Greeks in their rising against the Turks. This brought him into correspondence with Lord Byron, at whose instigation he took steps to negotiate a loan for the Greeks by selling bonds. However, it was mainly Byron's name that attracted investors and his death at Missolonghi in May 1824 resulted in financial difficulties. Bowring was accused of having made a fortune at the expense of both the Greeks and the bondholders, though in reality his finances had suffered. Faced with ruin, he adopted the dubious expedient of putting pressure on the Greek agents in London to relieve him of his bonds at a price higher than their market value. Two years later another disastrous Greek loan, in which Bowring and the Greek Committee played little part, brought the mismanagement of both loans into the public eye, and Bowring and others were alleged to have enriched themselves dishonestly. Bentham, however, refused to listen to Bowring's detractors and in 1824, when the <span class="italic">Westminster Review</span> was founded, made him the political editor.<h2>
<a name="Literatureandpolitics"></a>Literature and politics</h2>Bowring's Russian anthology was followed by similar volumes of verse translations of Dutch (1824), Spanish (1824), Polish (1827), Serbian (1827), Hungarian (1830), and Czech (1832) poetry, sometimes produced with the help of expert collaborators, whose contribution he did not fully acknowledge. He published translations from an even greater variety of languages in the <span class="italic">Westminster Review</span>, the <span class="italic">Foreign Quarterly Review</span>, and the <span class="italic">London Magazine</span>. For a time he worked with George Borrow (1803&#150;1881), whom he had met in 1821, on a volume of Scandinavian translations, but this was never completed. The translations brought him temporary fame, but the public's enthusiasm soon declined. His financial fortunes too were in decline, and by late 1827 Bowring &amp; Co. had collapsed. He was hoping, with Bentham's support, to cure his financial ills by becoming a professor of literature at the newly established London University. His sons John, Frederick, and Lewin were sent to stay with relatives, while he, his wife, their daughter Maria, and the infant Edgar moved to Heidelberg, where he thought associating with German professors would improve his chances. He returned to England in 1828 and took up residence with Bentham at Queen Square, Westminster, while his wife went to live with friends at Hackney. He attributed his failure to get the professorship to Anglican influence at London University. By late 1828 his financial situation was desperate, and a group of friends and fellow Unitarians organized a fund to save him from sequestration. He managed to be nominated a commissioner of public accounts, but the prime minister, the duke of Wellington, prevented his employment. He was, however, permitted, as an unpaid commissioner receiving only expenses, to visit the Netherlands to prepare a review of the Dutch public accounting system. Late in 1828 he moved to 7 North Place, Gray's Inn Lane, Holborn, and the following year to nearby Millmann Street, Holborn. During a visit to the Netherlands in 1829 he received an honorary doctorate from the University of Groningen for services to Dutch literature, and was henceforth often known as the Doctor. He was successful at this time in retaining his position with the <span class="italic">Westminster Review</span>, when it passed from Bentham's ownership to Colonel Thomas Perronet Thompson, who became a friend of Bowring.<br>
<br>The revolution in France in July 1830 made it again possible for Bowring to visit that country, and following the formation of a whig government that autumn he was engaged as paid secretary to Sir Henry Parnell's commission on the public accounts, which entailed investigating the accounting systems of France and the Netherlands. His fortunes were now improving and he moved with his family into the house at 1 Queen Square, Westminster (next door to Bentham), that was to remain their home for seventeen years. In 1831 Bowring and George Villiers (later Lord Clarendon) were appointed commissioners to investigate commercial relations between Britain and France. In this connection, between 1832 and 1834, Bowring was sent on three long coach journeys through the centre and south of France. His enquiries brought him into conflict with the minister of commerce, Adolphe Thiers. On 6 June 1832 Bowring's mentor Jeremy Bentham died &#145;in his arms&#146;  (L. B. Bowring, &#145;A brief memoir&#146;, 14), leaving him all his manuscripts and a sum of money towards their publication. He now embarked on this formidable task, though, when it eventually came to fruition in <span class="italic">The Collected Works of Jeremy Bentham</span> (11 vols., 1838&#150;43), much of the work, owing to Bowring's frequent absences abroad or on official duties, had been carried out by others. Anticipating the effect of the <span class="roman">Reform Bill</span>, Bentham, in April 1831, had put Bowring's name forward as a parliamentary candidate, and in 1832 Bowring stood for Blackburn but was defeated. In 1835 he stood for the same constituency and was again defeated, but was elected MP for Clyde Boroughs (Kilmarnock). In 1837 he lost his seat, but was sent by Palmerston on an important commercial fact-finding mission to Egypt and Constantinople, which kept him abroad for a full year. On his return, in September 1838, he addressed a meeting in Manchester, at which a proposal was made, leading eventually to the formation of the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/42282', "Anti-Corn Law League")</script>. In June 1841 he was elected MP for Bolton as a free-trade candidate and held his seat for over seven years. The issues for which he spoke and voted included the abolition of corn duties, a more humane application of poor relief, the extension of popular education, revision of quarantine regulations, abolition of flogging in the army, the suppression of the opium trade, and the worldwide abolition of slavery. As a supporter of <i>laissez-faire</i>, he opposed the regulation of wages. He favoured the introduction of decimal coinage and in April 1847 moved in the House of Commons the introduction of the florin, a coin worth one tenth of a pound, which was first issued in 1849.<h2>
<a name="ConsulatCanton"></a>Consul at Canton</h2>In 1843 Bowring turned once more to commerce and invested his capital in an ironworks in Glamorgan. He also invested in the Llynvi Valley Railway, in the vicinity of his ironworks, and in 1845 became chairman of the directors of the London and Blackwall Railway; but in 1847 his business interests failed and he found himself suddenly in a worse financial position than at any time since 1828. Consequently, when, in October 1848, Palmerston offered him the vacant consulship at Canton (Guangzhou) with a salary of &pound;1800 a year, he accepted, with alacrity, despite his age (he was fifty-six). He arrived at Canton in April 1849, having left his wife and family at Larkbeare. He returned to England on leave in June 1853. During his absence George Borrow had published <span class="italic">Lavengro</span> (1851), and Bowring thought certain unflattering passages in it applied to him and his family. Relations became strained. While on leave Bowring was appointed plenipotentiary and chief superintendent of trade in the Far East and governor, commander-in-chief, and vice-admiral of Hong Kong. On 16 February 1854 he was knighted and two days later left for China again, accompanied this time by his wife, two of their daughters, and their eldest son, John. At Colombo he was joined by another son, Lewin. In 1855 Bowring visited Siam and successfully negotiated a commercial treaty with King Mongkut, which provoked strong opposition in England from Lord Shaftesbury and Bowring's radical friends owing to the clauses facilitating importation of opium into Siam. Since his arrival in the Far East, Bowring had modified his views on the opium trade, ostensibly because of the difficulty of controlling it, but his son John was a partner in Jardine Mattheson &amp; Co., the largest dealers in opium in the Far East, and this firm acted as Bowring's bankers. He was accused of having sold himself to opium merchants.<br>
<br>Following an incident in October 1856, when a British-registered light vessel, the <i>Arrow</i>, was boarded by Chinese soldiers, Bowring authorized the dispatch of a naval force, the bombardment of Canton, and its forcible entry. The Chinese then directed several attacks on the British in the neighbourhood of Canton. In January 1857 an attempt was made to poison the European population of Hong Kong by putting arsenic in their bread. No one died, but about 300&#150;400 people, including Bowring and his family, were made seriously ill. Bowring rejected the implementation of martial law and in the ensuing trial the baker of the poisoned bread and other suspects were acquitted for lack of evidence and allowed to leave the colony. Votes of censure on his conduct and on the government were moved in both houses of parliament, but in the ensuing elections the government was strengthened. Although the prime minister, Lord Palmerston, supported him, he thought Bowring had handled the situation badly and decided that he should be replaced as plenipotentiary while retaining the governorship of Hong Kong. Lady Bowring, suffering from the effects of arsenic poisoning, returned to Britain with her daughter Edith, and died on 27 September 1858 in Taunton, while Bowring remained in Hong Kong, accompanied by two other daughters and his son John. On 3 May 1859 Bowring formally handed over his office and, accompanied by his daughter Maria, left for Britain. As it was passing through the Red Sea, their ship, the <i>Alma</i>, struck a submerged coral reef. The passengers were rescued after three days of privation.<h2>
<a name="Personalityandachievement"></a>Personality and achievement</h2>While still in China Bowring had read George Borrow's <span class="italic">The Romany Rye</span> (1857), which contained a scurrilous attack on him (especially in chapter 11, &#145;The old radical&#146;, of the appendix) and suggested that he had secured his appointment at Canton by exploiting Borrow's work and expertise. This particular slur was without foundation, but there was truth in Borrow's allegation that Bowring was disposed to exaggerate his own reputation as a polyglot and pass off other people's work as his own.<br>
<br>Bowring's personality aroused the antagonism of many besides Borrow. He was often accused of vanity, obsequiousness, and worse. About 5 feet 9 inches tall and of slender build, he had a refined, intellectual face, a long nose, a high forehead, and large grey eyes. He wore spectacles, not only for reading, as may be seen in the portrait painted in 1826 by John King, now in the National Portrait Gallery. Both supporters and detractors noted his volubility, but he was not a success as a speaker in the House of Commons  (Bartle, <span class="italic">An Old Radical</span>, 61). He received many honours from foreign governments and was an honorary member of numerous learned societies. For his Russian anthology he received a diamond ring from Tsar Alexander I, and on 5 June 1856 he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society. Besides his editorial work and many contributions to reviews and magazines on a wide variety of subjects, including political, literary, and philological articles, hymns, poems, and verse translations, he published over thirty books and pamphlets, covering a similar range, and wrote his memoirs, which were published by his son Lewin in 1877. His most successful book, <span class="italic">The Kingdom and People of Siam</span> (2 vols., 1857), was republished by Oxford University Press in 1969. The volumes of verse translations were also important, for, though not all they pretended to be, they introduced otherwise virtually unknown literatures to the English-speaking world. Bowring's services in diplomacy were valued because of his aptitude for languages, his ability to handle figures, and a &#145;facility for obtaining access to persons of all stations&#146;  (Bartle, <span class="italic">An Old Radical</span>, 35). His achievement as a radical politician, particularly in the cause of free trade, has tended to be obscured by the controversy over the <i>Arrow</i> affair.<br>
<br>On his return to Britain, Bowring was granted a pension and an additional special allowance. He remained active in public life and continued to write and publish. Having failed in 1860 in an attempt to be adopted as the Liberal candidate for Exeter, he accepted in February 1861 a semi-official appointment as commercial agent to the new kingdom of Italy, but with Cavour's death in June 1861 all hope of a commercial agreement with that country came to an end. On 8 November 1860 at Lewin's Mead Unitarian Chapel, Bristol, to the consternation of his children, he married Deborah Castle [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/56282/', "Bowring, Deborah, Lady Bowring (1816&#150;1902)")</script>], the youngest daughter of Thomas Castle, a prominent Clifton Unitarian. They had no children. As justice of the peace and deputy lord lieutenant for Devon he was active in the cause of prison reform, and in 1865 published <span class="italic">Remunerative prison labour as an instrument for promoting the reformation and diminishing the cost of offenders</span>. Bowring died of prostate disease on 23 November 1872 at Claremont, Holloway Street, Exeter, the house he had built only a few yards from his birthplace. Late in November following a funeral service at George's Meeting-House, attended by his family and many local worthies, he was buried in Exeter new cemetery. His gravestone bore the opening line of one of his best-known hymns, &#145;In the cross of Christ I glory&#146;. His second wife, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/56282/', "Deborah Bowring")</script>, died on 28 July 1902.<br>
