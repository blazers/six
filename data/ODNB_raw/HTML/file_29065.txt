<span class="headword">Werferth <span class="st"> [W&aelig;rferth]</span></span>  (<em>d.</em> 907<span class="mult">x</span>15), <span class="occ">bishop of Worcester</span>, was literary assistant to Alfred the Great, at whose instigation he translated the <span class="italic">Dialogues</span> of Gregory I.<br>
<br>Werferth first appears as bishop of the important and well-endowed see of Worcester in a charter of 872, as the Danish menace was starting to spread into western Mercia. Subsequent diplomas show him zealous in furthering the material interests of his diocese. He seems soon to have become more widely known, and in probably the early 880s was brought into the circle of King Alfred of Wessex. Chapter 77 of Asser's life of Alfred, apparently written in 893, describes Werferth as &#145;thoroughly learned&#146; (<i>bene eruditum</i>) in scripture, and a suitable person for Alfred to turn to as he sought churchmen to translate into English the works he had selected for his &#145;great books&#146; programme. Werferth was allocated the <span class="italic">Dialogues</span> of Gregory the Great, a key work in spreading both knowledge of St Benedict's life and miracles and lore about the fate of souls after death which contributed greatly to the evolution of the medieval notion of purgatory. Werferth's work was among the earliest of these translations to have been undertaken; it must have been complete by 893, for it is mentioned by Asser as having been done &#145;meticulously and stylishly&#146; (<i>lucubratim et elegantissime</i>).<br>
<br>Whether or not Werferth made the entire translation single-handed (it is possible that he was assisted by a priest called Werwulf, also mentioned by Asser), it reflects clear Mercian characteristics. Alfred seems to have been pleased, for he supplied the translation with his own (prose) preface; there is an alternative preface in verse by Bishop Wulfsige of Sherborne. As it is known that the other work of Gregory's which Alfred selected (and translated himself), the <span class="italic">Cura pastoralis</span>, was to have been sent to all the bishops in England (it happens that the best-known extant copy is that sent to Werferth) it is reasonable to suppose that the translation of the <span class="italic">Dialogues</span> had similarly wide circulation, but no manuscripts of it earlier than 1000 survive whole. In the early eleventh century it was reworked thoroughly to reflect changes in the language; the result is such a drastic alteration of Werferth's original as to be almost an independent translation.<br>
<br>Alfred's respect for Werferth is shown by the benefaction of 100 mancuses made to him (by name, not just as bishop of Worcester) in the king's surviving Old English will. Werferth outlived his royal patron by fifteen years or so; evidence for his activity in the reign of Edward the Elder is confined to charters, which suggest that he died between 907 and 915.<br>
