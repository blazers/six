<span class="headword">Cutler,  Ann</span>  (1759&#150;1794), <span class="occ">hand-loom weaver and Methodist evangelist</span>, was born in Thornley, near Longridge, in the parish of Chipping, Lancashire; nothing is known of her parents. After living a strict, moral life she was converted in 1785 by the revivalist Wesleyan William Bramwell, and in the same year received the gift of &#145;entire sanctification&#146; taught by John Wesley, whom she later met at Preston in 1790. She soon began to obtain converts by praying in public meetings. Nicknamed &#145;Praying Nanny&#146;, she customarily rose at midnight for prayer, slept until 4 a.m., prayed until 5 or 6 a.m., then studied the <span class="roman">Bible</span> and prayed again. When weaving she prayed briefly twelve or fourteen times daily. Her public prayers, though brief, were generally in a loud voice. She searched the <span class="roman">New Testament</span> &#145;to know what blessings were promised to her; and if she could satisfy herself &hellip; of what the promise contained, she instantly believed that the Lord would give it&#146;  (Bramwell, 1796, 9). Her greatest gift was not in argument or exhortation but in her powerful praying and her insight into individual spiritual conditions. Like other Methodist women of this period she had the unusual mystical experience of visions of the Trinity perceived in the three separate persons: &#145;I have union with the Trinity thus. I see the Son through the Spirit, I find the Father through the Son, and God is my all in all&#146;  (ibid., 19).<br>
<br>Ann's early evangelism was in the Lancashire Fylde district, where she was sometimes accompanied by Martha Thompson (1733&#150;1820), reputed to be the first Methodist in Preston. Martha exhorted and sang, Ann prayed and directed people to conversion. Eventually Martha's father, fearing for his daughter's health, warned her not to continue: &#145;Nanny Cutler will soon kill thee. She is as strong as a horse, and thou hast no business to try to work with her&#146;  (Taylor, 131). Ann's greatest successes were in the Yorkshire revival of 1792&#150;4, when she worked with William Bramwell to stir up revivals, notably in Dewsbury, Birstall, and the Bradford and Otley areas, and possibly also in Leeds. She provoked many conversions and claims to entire sanctification, a doctrine she often emphasized. During 1794 she helped to stimulate revivals in Lancashire (notably Oldham and Manchester), Cheshire, Staffordshire, and Derby. Though probably influenced by worsening social conditions and the troubled state of Methodism following Wesley's death in 1791, these revivals owed much to the charisma of Bramwell and Cutler.<br>
<br>By strict self-discipline and self-denial&#151;she apparently lived chiefly on milk and herb tea&#151;Ann Cutler, despite her humble origins, became a powerful evangelist. In appearance she was &#145;of medium height and build, of comely appearance, plain and neat in her dress and of a very modest, retiring disposition&#146;  (Taylor, 60). She never married and apparently, unlike most Methodists, had covenanted with God to live a single life. Anxious to avoid any appearance of impropriety, she rejected any escort from young men, even when working late in the evening. She died in Macclesfield, of a chest infection, on 29 December 1794 and was buried there in the churchyard of Christ Church, whose minister was the Revd David Simpson, a friend of John Wesley.<br>
