<span class="headword">Hutcheson,  Archibald</span>  (<em>c.</em>1660&#150;1740), <span class="occ">lawyer and economist</span>, was the son of Archibald Hutcheson of Stranocum, co. Antrim. He was admitted to the Middle Temple in 1680, was called to the bar in 1683, and for the next five years practised as a barrister in England and Ireland. At the beginning of 1688 he was chosen attorney-general of the Leeward Islands by the governor, Sir Nathaniel Johnson, and he became noted for implementing a policy of complete leniency towards the islands' Catholic populace. A protestant, and possibly of Ulster&#150;Scots presbyterian stock, he had a deep antipathy to religious persecution, which seems to have been a strong recommendation to the lords of trade in London. He retained his position after the revolution, although not without becoming caught up in the accusations of disloyalty to William III directed at Johnson's successor, Colonel Christopher Codrington, being himself accused of aspersing the king's name and of bias towards Catholics and Jacobites. Hutcheson was cleared of these denunciations, however, and continued his official legal duties on the islands until 1704 when he returned to England, settling permanently at St James's, Westminster, and re-establishing his legal practice. Having first married Mary Smith on 29 June 1697 at St Martin-in-the-Fields, he had following her death married Rebecca Bankes (<i>d</i>. in or before 1715), a widow, on 19 August 1701 at Topsham, Devon. His interest in economic and mathematical questions led to his election as FRS in 1708.<br>
<br>About 1710 Hutcheson became a legal adviser to the duke of Ormond, thus joining the extensive retinue of advisers, lawyers, and agents whom the duke employed to administer his vast, mainly Irish estate. Hutcheson's own Irish background and the close proximity to Ormond's London residence in St James's Square doubtless assisted what remained primarily a professional rather than political association. Hutcheson spent the early months of 1713 touring Germany in the company of the young duke of Montagu. During these travels, which included visits to several princely courts, he acted as a kind of self-appointed ambassador in support of the protestant Hanoverian succession to the British crown. At Frankfurt he was welcomed by the exiled duke of Marlborough, Montagu's father-in-law, who regarded him as a potentially useful tool in parliament. He also made a favourable impression with courtiers and politicians at Hanover. Upon his return to England, the duke of Ormond, as newly appointed warden of the Cinque Ports, was able to procure Hutcheson's return for Hastings in the autumn general election.<br>
<br>Although Hutcheson had been regarded as a tory, presumably on the grounds of his pronounced attachment to the church, he had little liking for the administration of the earl of Oxford, and once in parliament co-operated closely with the whigs in opposition. Indeed, his intimacy with senior whig politicians, combined with the strong whiggish line which he took in the Commons during the 1714 session, set him apart from most other &#145;whimsical&#146; or moderate tories, and political observers regarded him more as a whig. Hutcheson's sterling parliamentary services in helping to rally tories against the ministry were rewarded after the accession of George I with his appointment (in December 1714) as a lord commissioner of the Board of Trade with a salary of &pound;1000. His accord with the new whig administration rapidly disintegrated, however, when proceedings were commenced in June 1715 to impeach the duke of Ormond, who, having aligned himself with the Stuart dynasty, was now in exile. Hutcheson gave a fulsome defence of his patron, and in January 1716 resigned from the Board of Trade.<br>
<br>Hutcheson's marriage in August 1715 (by a licence dated 18 August) to Mary, Lady Gayre (<i>d</i>. 1727), the widow of the wealthy West Indian merchant Sir John Gayre, gave him access to a fortune said to be worth &pound;40,000 and obviated any further need he might have for a government salary. For the remainder of his career in parliament he cast himself as an independent critic of government. Hutcheson's continuing association with Ormond and his family inevitably prompted accusations that he was a crypto-Jacobite, but as he had become one of the duke's principal creditors and an authority on his tangled finances, it was no longer an association he could renounce without considerable personal loss. In July 1718 Hutcheson added fuel to public concern about the size of the national debt with the publication of his essay <span class="italic">The Present State of the Public Debts and Funds</span>, the main thrust of which was his argument that the debt had escalated sharply under the management of George I's whig ministers. Responding for the government, John Crookshanks, an excise official, claimed to detect flaws in Hutcheson's accounting methodology and demonstrated that the recent accumulations of debt had in fact been incurred during Queen Anne's reign. In advancing his case, Crookshanks played upon Hutcheson's supposed Jacobitism by exposing passages in Hutcheson's text which seemed redolent of a sympathy for the Stuarts. However, by the time Hutcheson published his <span class="italic">Answer</span> in December 1719, the chief concern was not with responsibility for the debt but with the agency selected for its reduction: the South Sea Company.<br>
<br>Hutcheson strongly opposed the company's proposals for taking over the national debt, and in a further pamphlet published as stock prices soared he warned that since stock values bore little or no relationship to their &#145;intrinsic&#146; worth, financial disaster was inevitable. In the aftermath of the &#145;bubble&#146; he proposed his own radical &#145;engraftment&#146; scheme, and with several other prominent opposition MPs and peers led demands for the company's directors to be stripped of their estates and effects. He subsequently participated in the Commons' secret committee which investigated the scandal. His idiosyncratic efforts during 1721&#150;2 to persuade Lord Sunderland to inaugurate a popular ministry, embracing &#145;country principles&#146; and capable of governing a nation traumatized by the South Sea crisis, produced nothing but his own disillusion. His candidacy in tandem with a tory in a particularly violent contest for the populous constituency of Westminster during the election in the spring of 1722 only revived taunts of Jacobitism; and the following year, amid exposure of the Atterbury plot, he was forced to publish a strong denial of any involvement with the Jacobite conspirators.<br>
<br>Hutcheson remained MP for Hastings, continuing to participate actively in proceedings until he stood down in 1727. In 1726 he was made a bencher at the Middle Temple, and on 30 October 1727, eight months after the death of his third wife, from whom he had previously separated by decree of chancery, he married another widow, Elizabeth Stewart, thereby acquiring property interests on the islands of Montserrat and St Kitts. Despite the jibes of certain detractors, his connection with Jacobitism was more apparent than real, for it was on the basis of his deep involvement in the complex financial affairs of Ormond and his brother, the earl of Arran, which continued into the early 1730s, that other prominent Jacobites whom he encountered presumed upon his personal support for their cause. He remained publicly active until almost the end of his life. He was one of the lords proprietors of Carolina and a member of the court of St George's Hospital, and in 1739 became treasurer of the Middle Temple. He died, probably aged eighty, on 12 August 1740; his fourth wife, Elizabeth, survived him.<br>
