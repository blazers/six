<span class="headword">Crosland <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Toulmin]</span>,  Camilla Dufour</span>  (1812&#150;1895), <span class="occ">writer</span>, was born on 9 June 1812 at 45 Aldermanbury, London, daughter of William Toulmin (<i>d</i>. 1820), a solicitor, and his wife, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Wright (<i>d</i>. 1862), who was related to the author Mary Berry (1763&#150;1852). She had a younger brother, Edward (<i>d</i>. 1845) and a much older half-brother, Henry (<i>d</i>. 1838). She was a precocious child who apparently could read at the age of three. After her father's death in 1820 the family was left in straitened financial circumstances: they moved lodgings several times, and Mrs Toulmin attempted unsuccessfully to start a boarding-house. Camilla Toulmin's education was interrupted by illness and limited by poverty, although she attended a ladies' academy for a time. She began to earn her living by making jewellery, before becoming a daily governess in 1834.<br>
<br>In 1837 some of Camilla Toulmin's verses were accepted by Lady Blessington for inclusion in the <span class="italic">Book of Beauty</span>; she also published poetry and short stories in <span class="italic">The Keepsake</span>, <span class="italic">Bentley's Miscellany</span>, the <span class="italic">Court Magazine</span>, and <span class="italic">Friendship's Offering</span>, for which she was sub-editor from 1842 to 1844. She became a friend of the Chambers brothers, whom she visited in Edinburgh in 1845, and contributed to <span class="italic">Chambers's Journal</span> until her death. Many of the poems which she published in these early years were reprinted in her <span class="italic">Poems</span> (1846), among them &#145;On the Completion of the Thames Tunnel&#146;; they show her mediocre talent and taste for topical subjects. Her editors and publishers introduced her to a range of literary and artistic circles: her acquaintances came to include Samuel Carter Hall and his wife, the Brownings (whom she visited in Florence in 1857&#150;8), Douglas Jerrold, Grace Aguilar, Richard Hengist Horne, Mary Mitford, Geraldine Jewsbury, and Margaret Fuller.<br>
<br>By the late 1840s Camilla Toulmin was writing for a variety of annuals and journals, as well as publishing novelettes such as <span class="italic">Partners for Life: a Christmas Story</span> (1847) and <span class="italic">The Little Berlin Wool Worker</span> (1844). Despite her modest literary success, she never forgot the &#145;gnawing anxiety&#146; of these difficult years  (N. Crosland, 348): living with her mother in lodgings in New Ormond Street, she rarely made more than &pound;60 a year by her teaching and &pound;50 a year by her pen. Her concern with the economic plight of women was reflected in her topical fiction such as &#145;The Orphan Milliners&#146; (1844) and &#145;A Story of the Factory&#146; (1846).<br>
<br>When Camilla Toulmin became engaged in 1848 to Newton Crosland (<i>d</i>. 1899), a London wine merchant, she was unwell and in debt. The marriage took place on 22 July 1848: Crosland had vacillated between Toulmin and Dinah Mulock, later Craik, who was their bridesmaid. The couple lived in London: for fourteen years at 3 Hyde Vale Cottages in Greenwich, before moving in 1863 to Lynton Lodge in Blackheath. In 1885, after Crosland had sold his business, the couple moved to a smaller house, 29 Ondine Road, in East Dulwich, London.<br>
<br>In 1854 Camilla Crosland published <span class="italic">Memorable Women</span>, a collection of short biographies of famous women including Fanny Burney, Rachel, Lady Russell, and Margaret Fuller: she stressed that her subjects were as eminent for their domestic as their intellectual qualities, which ensured <span class="italic">The Athenaeum</span>'s praise for the work as one which &#145;may be placed with safety in the hands of young women&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Athenaeum</span>, 4 March 1854, 278). In 1857 Camilla Crosland published the poorly received <span class="italic">Light in the Valley</span>, a fervent defence of spiritualism, which she and her husband had been investigating since 1854. Part 1 argued that spiritualism could be reconciled with Christianity, while part 2 dwelt on the experiences of the Croslands themselves and their circle of spiritualist friends, among whom were Sophia De Morgan and the Howitts.<br>
<br>Camilla Crosland continued to publish fiction: <span class="italic">Lydia: a Woman's Book</span> (1852) presented a critique of contemporary education. <span class="italic">Mrs Blake: a Story of Twenty Years</span> (1862) contained a thinly veiled account of her early years as an impoverished writer. This novel and <span class="italic">Hubert Freeth's Prosperity</span> (1873)&#151;the tale of an upwardly mobile family&#151;represent her best fiction: &#145;well-written, high-toned works&#146;  (N. Crosland, 367) as her husband described them, they are intelligent and painstaking examples of the mid-century realist novel. However, Crosland's more considered works did not meet with great acclaim. Steeped in contemporary sensation novels, <span class="italic">The Athenaeum</span> critic damned <span class="italic">Hubert Freeth's Prosperity</span> with faint praise, commenting that it was &#145;life-like; though the life is for the most part of a humdrum and unromantic colour&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Athenaeum</span>, 25 Oct 1873, 524).<br>
<br>In the last fifteen years of her life Camilla Crosland was in bad health, suffering from asthma, a weak heart, and impaired vision. She translated the dramatic works of Victor Hugo (1887), and in 1893 she published <span class="italic">Landmarks of a Literary Life</span>, a fascinating memoir of her literary acquaintances. She gave little detail here of her writing career, which was more fully treated in her autobiographical fragments published by Newton Crosland in his <span class="italic">Rambles Round my Life</span> (1898): together, they provide an unusually full picture of the career and literary milieu of a mid-nineteenth-century female hack writer. She died at 29 Ondine Road on 16 February 1895: as her husband quaintly put it, &#145;at half past seven she had a cup of tea; and at a quarter to eight she was in Paradise&#146;  (N. Crosland, 370). She was buried in Camberwell cemetery, London, and a window was erected in her memory in St Albans Cathedral.<br>
