<span class="headword">Townshend,  George</span>  (1715/16&#150;1769), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, was the eldest son of the politician and agricultural improver <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27617/', "Charles Townshend, second Viscount Townshend (1674&#150;1738)")</script>, and his second wife, Dorothy (<i>d</i>. 1726), sister of Robert Walpole, first earl of Orford. He entered the navy in 1729 in the <i>Rose</i> (20 guns), with Captain Weller, apparently on the Carolina station. After two and a half years in her he served for four and a half in the West Indies, in the <i>Scarborough</i>&#151;also a 20-gun frigate&#151;with Captain Thomas Durell, and for the first part of the time with Lieutenant Edward Hawke. Townshend passed his examination on 23 October 1736, being then, according to his certificate, nearly twenty-one  (TNA: PRO, ADM 107/3, p. 304). On 30 January 1739 he was promoted captain of the frigate <i>Tartar</i>, which he commanded on the Carolina station until November 1741. In December he was appointed to the <i>Chatham</i>, and two years later to the <i>Bedford</i> (70 guns), in which he went out to the Mediterranean and took part in the action off Toulon on 11 February 1744; he continued there under Vice-Admiral William Rowley, and in the summer of 1745 Rowley appointed him to command a detached squadron on the coast of Italy, with the rank of commodore.<br>
<br>Townshend's first duty was to co-operate with the insurgent Corsican patriots against the Genoese. Hearing from them that they had 3000 men under arms he posted his ships and bombs before Bastia, and on the night of 6&#150;7 November destroyed the batteries and reduced the town to ruins. It then appeared that the 3000 men had yet to be raised, and it was not until 18 November that the insurgents were able to take possession of the town. Towards the end of the month he reduced the forts of Mortella and San Fiorenzo; but the Corsican patriots were so busy fighting among themselves&#151;&#145;alternately dining together and squabbling&#146; as Townshend told the Admiralty&#151;that nothing could be effectively done. This unsatisfactory situation continued for some months. On 7 April Townshend wrote to the Admiralty that the dissensions were so violent that nothing could be done without a number of regular troops. On 8 May he made clear that, as his whole force was needed to maintain the blockade of the Genoese coast, the revolt in Corsica should be left to itself. To the difficulty of disunion among the patriots was added that of the presence in the neighbourhood of a French squadron reportedly fully equal in force to that with Townshend. In March he had stretched across to Cartagena, and, having watered at Mahon, was on his way to Cagliari to consult with the Sardinian viceroy, when he saw four large ships and two French men-of-war. Having with him only one ship, the <i>Essex</i>, besides the <i>Bedford</i>, and two bombs, Townshend judged against engagement until he could secure the rest of his squadron. With this French squadron on the coast, he concluded that &#145;nothing can be attempted against Corsica&#146;.<br>
<br>Having received several such communications the Admiralty sent out an order for a court martial to inquire into Townshend's conduct and behaviour. This was carried out on 9 February 1747, with the result that the court was convinced that Townshend &#145;did not meet with a squadron of the enemy's ships, nor see or chase any ships so as to discover them to be enemies&#146;. They concluded moreover that Townshend's report upon the vicinity of the French squadron was based upon purely hearsay evidence. The court was therefore of the opinion that Townshend's letters were written &#145;with great carelessness and negligence&#146; and &#145;contained very false and erroneous accounts of Captain Townshend's proceedings&#146;. He was required by the court to write letters to the Admiralty and to Vice-Admiral Henry Medley, the commander-in-chief, begging pardon for his fault; it was also recommended that he be severely reprimanded by the president. Horace Mann, British representative in Florence, who had formed a very poor opinion of Townshend's capacity and education, wrote to Horace Walpole that if Townshend had been capable of writing an intelligible letter in his own language he would not have found himself suspected of cowardice; and that he had omitted to state that he had only one ship besides his own  (J. Doran, <span class="italic">Mann and Manners at the Court of Florence, 1740&#150;1786</span>, 2 vols., 1876, 1.56). For his part Walpole attributed the court martial entirely to political motives: &#145;The persecution is on account of the poor boy's relation to my father&#146;  (Walpole, <span class="italic">Corr.</span>, 19.332). Moreover Townshend's letters are perfectly intelligible, and the fact of his having with him only one ship besides his own is clearly stated, and the ship named. None the less Townshend's surprisingly uncouth manner is well attested by Edward Brenton.<br>
<br>After this, Townshend continued in the Mediterranean until towards the end of the year, when he returned to England, and paid the <i>Bedford</i> off in December. Because Townshend enjoyed Henry Pelham's &#145;very powerfull support&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 15957, fol. 87), and had been a commodore, Lord Sandwich appointed him to command off the Scheldt in the spring of 1748 with a broad pennant in the <i>Folkestone</i>. From November 1748 to November 1752 he was commodore and commander-in-chief at Jamaica, with his broad pennant in the <i>Gloucester</i>. On 4 February 1755 he was promoted rear-admiral of the white, and again sent out to Jamaica, as commander-in-chief, with his flag in the <i>Dreadnought</i>. Townshend returned to England in 1757 and had no further service, but he became vice-admiral in 1758 and admiral in 1765; and he died, apparently unmarried, in August 1769.<br>
