<span class="headword">Ralph</span> <span class="st"> [<em>called </em>Ralph the Timid]</span>, earl of Hereford  (<em>d.</em> 1057), <span class="occ">magnate</span>, was the second son of Drogo, count of Amiens and the Vexin, and Godgifu (Gode), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8915/', "&#198;thelred II")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8794/', "Emma")</script>. His father died on pilgrimage to Jerusalem in 1035 and Godgifu married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/52359/', "Eustace (II), count of Boulogne (d. c.1087)")</script>; she was dead by 1049. Ralph came to England with his uncle, Edward the Confessor, in 1041. He attested three charters of 1050 as earl  (<span class="italic">AS chart.</span>, S 1020&#150;22); his sphere of authority was probably the east midlands, the region where the lands of his wife, Gytha, are to be found. Their distribution suggests that she was related to the local magnate Burgr&aelig;d, whose lands lay in Bedfordshire, Buckinghamshire, and Northamptonshire; like Earl Ralph, he was a benefactor of Peterborough Abbey. Ralph himself held estates in Bedfordshire, Buckinghamshire, Leicestershire, Middlesex, Northamptonshire, and Rutland, as well as Berkshire, Gloucestershire, Warwickshire, and Worcestershire; but his full holding cannot now be recovered. Much of it must have come from the king, but he received a life-lease of Cranfield, Bedfordshire, from &AElig;lfwine, abbot of Ramsey.<br>
<br>Ralph's tenure of the east midlands would have brought him into contact with Harold Godwineson, earl of East Anglia, and it is noteworthy that he named his son Harold. When, however, Earl Godwine and his family fell out with the king in 1051, Ralph raised the levies of his earldom for his uncle. In 1052 he and Earl Odda commanded the royal fleet assembled against Godwine at Sandwich, but they could not prevent the earl's triumphant return. Godwine and his sons were reinstated in lands and office, but Swein Godwineson died on pilgrimage to Jerusalem in 1052, and it was probably then that Ralph received Swein's earldom of Hereford, which included Oxfordshire  (<span class="italic">AS chart.</span>, S 1105). There was already a Norman presence in the shire, and at least one castle, at Hereford itself, though its builder, Osbern Pentecost, was driven out on Godwine's return.<br>
<br>In 1055 Ralph defended Herefordshire against the exiled Earl &AElig;lfgar and his ally Gruffudd ap Llywelyn, but their encounter on 24 October was a disaster: &#145;before any spear had been thrown the English army fled because they were on horseback, and many were killed there&#151;about four or five hundred men&#151;and they killed none in return&#146;  (<span class="italic">ASC</span>, s.a. 1055, text C). The invaders sacked Hereford, burning down St &AElig;thelberht's minster. Later sources accuse Ralph and his Frenchmen of starting the flight. It was this engagement which later earned Ralph his opprobrious nickname &#145;the timid&#146; or, more properly, &#145;timorous&#146; (<i>timidus</i>), in contrast to the &#145;vigorous&#146; (<i>strenuus</i>) Earl Harold, who chased the invaders into Wales. Ralph probably lost Hereford to Earl Harold at this juncture. He died on 21 December 1057, not much above thirty, and was buried in the abbey at Peterborough. His elder brother Count Walter died in 1063, allegedly poisoned by Duke William of Normandy. His son Harold, a minor in 1066 in the care of his great-aunt, Edith, received part of his father's estate and later acquired the castle and honour of Ewias Harold, which preserves his name. His descendants are the Sudeleys of Toddington, Gloucestershire (for the early history of whom <i>see </i><a target="_top" href="/view/article/54513">Sudeley family</a>).<br>
