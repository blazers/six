<span class="headword">Jellett,  Mary Harriett <span class="st"> [Mainie]</span></span>  (1897&#150;1944), <span class="occ">painter and writer on art</span>, was born on 20 April 1897 at 36 Fitzwilliam Square, Dublin, and baptized at St Anne's Church, Dawson Street, the eldest of the four daughters of William Morgan Jellett (1857&#150;1936) and Janet McKensie Stokes (<i>b</i>. 1874). Her father was a successful barrister from a Huguenot family that had settled in Ireland in the seventeenth century. Her paternal grandfather, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/14715/', "John Hewitt Jellett (1817&#150;1888)")</script>, was provost of Trinity College, Dublin. Her mother's family migrated from Wiltshire in the seventeenth century and had made a distinguished contribution to public life in Ireland in engineering and medicine; her maternal grandfather, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26561/', "William Stokes (1804&#150;1878)")</script>, was a renowned chest physician. Mainie Jellett (as she was known) was educated, as were all the daughters, at home by tutors or governesses, and it was not until she entered art school that she experienced outside education. Musically gifted, she played the piano well from an early age, performing with her mother and other members of the family at musical soir&eacute;es. She studied at the Leinster School of Music under Mabel L&auml;nder, and regularly won prizes at <i>feis ceoil</i> competitions. She also studied painting as a child. Though this eclectic system of education inspired her, and provided a secure and comfortable childhood, she was surrounded by the tensions of Ireland's political circumstances as well as the cultural ferment occasioned by a literary and artistic revival led by William Butler Yeats and Lady Augusta Gregory. This political activity was represented in practical ways in the family by Mainie's father. He was energetically active in the southern unionist tradition and was directly involved in the party's organization and affairs; he served as an MP at Westminster, holding the Dublin University seat.<br>
<br>At the age of twelve Mainie began to study art under May Manning, a serious project which lasted five years and led directly to her enrolment in the Metropolitan School of Art, where briefly she was a pupil of Sir William Orpen. A career in music was considered, but preferring a creative rather than an interpretative involvement in art, she chose to go on with artistic studies. In 1917 she moved to the Westminster School of Art in London, where she studied under Walter Sickert and Walter Bayes. Under Sickert's direction, she later wrote, &#145;drawing and composition came alive to me and I began to understand the work of the Old Masters&#146;  (MacCarvill, 47).<br>
<br>Mainie Jellett produced an outstanding body of student drawings, watercolours, and paintings. In 1919 she won the Taylor prize in the annual Royal Dublin Society competition with a painting entitled <span class="italic">Peace</span> (priv. coll.), celebrating the end of the First World War. She held an exhibition in company with Lillian Davidson in Dublin in 1920 that was favourably noticed in the <span class="italic">Irish Times</span>: &#145;There is a joyful note in Miss Jellett's pictures that appeal to the eye. The artist revels in the seashore and conveys her impression in lucid style&#146;  (Arnold, 43). There is some evidence that both artists came increasingly under the influence of Jack Yeats.<br>
<br>Although she felt drawn to a professional career as an artist, which inevitably would have meant teaching as well as painting and exhibiting work, Jellett was not entirely satisfied with what she had achieved. She decided to study with the cubist painter Andr&eacute; Lhote in Paris, and spent part of 1920 and 1921 in his atelier. From there, in December 1921, she moved to study with Albert Gleizes and spent a fruitful year embracing the principles of abstract cubism, which the French cubist painter was then working out. She was accompanied by her friend <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/33965/', "Evie Hone (1894&#150;1955)")</script> during these studies. Hone was a lifelong companion of Jellett's; a sufferer from infantile paralysis, and permanently disabled, she became both friend and working companion in the spread of Irish modernism.<br>
<br>In 1923 Jellett, having completed almost ten years studying art, returned to a very changed Dublin, capital of an independent Ireland. She was full of the intellectual and creative turmoil of new ideas and new directions. Together with Hone, she made an immediate and profound impact on the city (likened to the Athens of Pericles) and its cultural life by exhibiting a joint show entirely of abstract works. With Jellett's <span class="italic">Decoration</span> (NG Ire.)&#151;the crucial work of the exhibition&#151;modernism in Ireland began. Ten years before the arrival of abstraction in England, Dublin saw the full-blooded fruits of French studies in the works of these two young painters. The city took it badly. A serious controversy developed, splitting critics and collectors into two opposed groups.<br>
<br>Through the 1920s and into the 1930s Mainie Jellett, working a good deal in the company of Evie Hone, continued painting works of abstraction in a city unreconciled to this kind of art. Jellett in particular applied her fine analytical mind to the philosophy behind abstraction, and her abilities reflected and shaped the serious and often confrontational situations which her work invoked. She was a powerful campaigner for the art in which she believed, while at the same time respecting all painters and supporting their right to public interest and support. The pattern of work and study pursued during these years by Jellett and Hone, who usually travelled together, was to return to France and spend time each summer with Albert Gleizes. They were consciously part of a small international movement with concerns embracing philosophical and religious beliefs and ideas as well as the principles of abstraction, then very new. As Jellett explained, in a lecture on 3 February 1926, they endeavoured:<blockquote>to penetrate beneath the exterior forms of nature, and to discover her natural laws and to construct accordingly. A picture should be a miniature universe, with all its forms interdependent, as the organization of the universe itself &hellip; A picture should be as complete as the human body so that the removal of any of its members would upset the equilibrium of the whole &hellip; You will not find blue sea and white clouds and waves, which make you feel you want to bathe and remind you of hot summer days; but instead, if you can look at these pictures with an open mind and without prejudice, they will give you a sensation of their own, resulting from the abstract qualities of the good or bad harmony of form and colour, balance and movement. They will affect you through your eyes and thence to your brain, the same way music affects you through your ear and thence to your brain. (Arnold, 94)</blockquote>The possibility of a career as a painter in Paris was always there, but Mainie Jellett felt a moral obligation to her own country, newly forging ideas and artistic activity under the governments of first W. T. Cosgrave and then Eamon de Valera. The family had at first felt isolated. Southern unionists were deserted by the unionists of the separated six counties in the north-east of Ireland and rapidly became a political anachronism. This affected Mainie's father most of all; the rest of the family soon acclimatized to the predominantly Roman Catholic state. Mainie Jellett took on adult pupils, taught children, lectured widely, and contributed to broadcast debates on the subject of modern art. She led a movement of Irish modernism that was vigorous and combative. Her art, which had gone through markedly varied stages of development&#151;from the fluid representational work of the Sickert period, through the angular representational cubism of Lhote, to abstraction&#151;now developed further. The strict rules of the 1920s gave way to flowing and brilliant colours, and to a combination of softness and strength which characterized her mature output&#151;as in, for example, <span class="italic">Abstract Composition</span> (<i>c</i>.1931; Crawford Municipal Gallery of Modern Art, Cork) and <span class="italic">Abstract Composition</span> (<i>c</i>.1931; priv. coll. reproduced in Arnold, 127, pl. 187). In 1931 she was a founder figure of the international movement Abstraction-Cr&eacute;ation, an exhibiting society based in Paris, and she became the associate of other friends of Albert Gleizes, including Robert and Sonia Delaunay. By the early 1930s two of her sisters had married and moved away from home, where family ties were exceptionally close and supportive. Then in 1936 her father died. The two had enjoyed a close and loving relationship: at Christmas 1932 he had written to her in Paris, &#145;No present that I could give you would convey what I feel. The unspoken word is sometimes more elegant than volumes of talk. You are the very best&#146;  (Arnold, 77). Throughout this period she exhibited regularly every two years.<br>
<br>Jellett believed in &#145;the necessity of a highly developed sense of craftsmanship; every artist should be capable of executing adequately whatever job he is entrusted with&#146;  (MacCarvill, 98). She designed cubist rugs which were woven by family members and also by the Dun Emer Guild, established by the Yeats sisters, Elizabeth (Lollie) and Susan (Lily). As the arts and crafts movement in Ireland took inspiration from Celtic art, Jellett responded to the similar capacity of Chinese art to transcend various media. She wrote to Gleizes in 1936:<blockquote>I was staying with a friend on the rocks [of Achill Island in the west of Ireland] near the sea, the peace and aloofness from the confusion and scrambling of the world of the moment was wonderful&#151;one had the same feeling in the Chinese exhibition [at the Royal Academy, London, 1935] &hellip; there was a natural rhythm running through the works as a whole, which caught you up and led you quickly on. (Arnold, 152)</blockquote>This invigorating experience led Jellett to reintroduce into her work landscape and figure studies that derive much of their economy and fluidity from the Chinese tradition in painting. Gratified that the Second World War, far from exercising a dispiriting effect on art, led to a burgeoning round of artistic events and exhibitions, Jellett supported a new venture, the White Stag Group of modernist painters and sculptors, who had a great impact in the city. She also worked towards the setting up of an alternative annual show of paintings in rivalry with the rather staid classicism of the Royal Hibernian Academy. Known as the Irish Exhibition of Living Art, the first exhibition was held in 1943 and was a huge success. Unfortunately, Mainie became ill at the end of that year, and was misdiagnosed as suffering from tuberculosis, then widespread. Though it would not have made a great deal of difference, treatment being so difficult, she was, in fact, suffering from cancer. She died at 96 Lower Lesson Street, Dublin, on 16 February 1944 at the age of forty-six, and was buried at St Fintan's, Howth, co. Dublin. Apart from the short periods when she studied art in London and Paris, she spent the whole of her life living in the same house. The writer Elizabeth Bowen recalled that Jellett's<blockquote>dynamicism [<i>sic</i>] &hellip; was at first found unfriendly, destructive, even repellent. She had gone so far as to go, it seemed, out of view. A mystique without the familiar softness, expressing itself in the ice of abstract terms, and the apparent subjugation of the soul to the intellect, took some accepting. (Arnold, 203)</blockquote>Her painting <span class="italic">I have Trodden the Wine Press Alone</span> (1943; NG Ire.), whose title is a quotation from <span class="roman">Isaiah</span>, is a fitting emblem of Jellett's life.<br>
