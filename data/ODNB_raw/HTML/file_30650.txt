<span class="headword">Bayliss, Sir  William Maddock</span>  (1860&#150;1924), <span class="occ">physiologist</span>, was born at Wolverhampton on 2 May 1860, the only son of Moses Bayliss, manufacturer of ironware, and his wife, Jane Maddock. After education at Mowbray House School, Wolverhampton, he had the opportunity of entering his father's business, but his interests lay in the direction of science and medicine. Nevertheless, he maintained a lifelong connection with the family business, of which he was a director.<br>
<br>With the object of pursuing a career in medicine, Bayliss was apprenticed at the Wolverhampton Hospital, but he never finished his medical training. In 1880 he entered University College, London, gaining a medical entrance scholarship the following year, and coming under the influence of Edwin Ray Lankester and, especially, John Scott Burdon-Sanderson. In 1883 Burdon-Sanderson went to Oxford, as the first Waynflete professor of physiology. Bayliss, who took a BSc in physics and zoology, but failed the second MB examination at University College, followed him, entering Wadham College in 1885 with the intention of developing his career in physiology. He obtained a first-class degree in natural science (physiology) in 1888.<br>
<br>For a time Bayliss participated in the teaching of physiology at Oxford, but in 1888 returned to University College, where a professorship of general physiology was created for him in 1912. Bayliss was elected to membership of the Physiological Society in 1890; he served as secretary from 1900 to 1922 and then as treasurer until 1924. He regularly attended the society's meetings, and in 1922, when summoned to Buckingham Palace to receive his knighthood, he refused the invitation because it coincided with a society meeting.<br>
<br>Bayliss's scientific researches had begun before going to Oxford with a study of the electric currents developed in the salivary glands, done in collaboration with John Rose Bradford. In 1890 Bayliss met his future brother-in-law, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36257/', "Ernest Henry Starling")</script>, and the two men began a collaboration that lasted until Bayliss's death. In 1893 Bayliss married Gertrude Ellen Starling, daughter of Matthew Henry Starling, clerk of the crown, Bombay; they had three sons and one daughter.<br>
<br>Bayliss's association with E. H. Starling produced several great advances in the knowledge of physiology. One of their earliest papers was on the electric currents of the mammalian heart, and their classic account of venous and capillary pressures appeared in 1894. In 1898&#150;9 they published papers on the innervation of the intestine, which held the field until the use of X-ray methods shed new light on the subject. A particularly significant contribution came in 1902, when they discovered that the presence of acid in the duodenum stimulated pancreatic secretion. They showed that this was due to the release from the duodenum of a blood-borne factor, which they called secretin; and they coined the word &#145;hormone&#146; to describe such chemical messengers.<br>
<br>Throughout those years Bayliss pursued other investigations, mostly concerned with the vascular system, including studies on the circulation through the brain and on vasomotor reflexes. Much of this work was later summarized in <span class="italic">The Vasomotor System</span> (1923). In 1903 Bayliss sued Stephen Coleridge, secretary of the National Anti-Vivisection Society, for libel, after allegations of cruelty to an experimental animal. Bayliss won the &#145;Brown Dog&#146; case and &pound;2000 in damages, which he donated to University College for the support of physiological research.<br>
<br>Bayliss became particularly interested in the chemistry and physics of physiology. He was a founder member of the Biochemical Society, and chairman in 1914&#150;15, and in 1919&#150;20. He worked on enzyme action, and the properties of colloidal systems; his lectures on the subject formed the basis of <span class="italic">The Nature of Enzyme Action</span> (1908). The most important form in which the interest was expressed was his <span class="italic">Principles of General Physiology</span> (1915), which quickly became a standard authority. It was a monument of erudition and clear statement, and was a major contribution to twentieth-century physiology. Such was its popularity and influence that Bayliss also wrote <span class="italic">An Introduction to General Physiology</span> (1919), and several American universities formed Bayliss Clubs to discuss his work. The <span class="italic">Principles</span> went through four editions, and was revised after Bayliss's death by his son Leonard and A. V. Hill, the fifth edition appearing in 1959&#150;60.<br>
<br>During the First World War, Bayliss's principal contribution was his work on wound shock, which resulted in the use of gum-saline solutions to replace lost blood, a treatment which met with considerable success. In the summer of 1918 over 50,000 litres of gum-saline were sent out to the British forces in France.<br>
<br>Bayliss was elected FRS in 1903 and knighted in 1922, and held many honorary degrees from British and foreign universities and academies. He was a member of the council of the Royal Society (1913&#150;15), Croonian lecturer (1904), royal medallist (1911), and Copley medallist (1919). He received the Baly medal of the Royal College of Physicians (1917), and delivered the Oliver-Sharpey lectures (1918), the Sylvanus Thompson lectures (1919), and the Herter lectures (1922). Wadham College made him an honorary fellow in 1922.<br>
<br>Bayliss, who entertained regularly, delighted in the society of other scientific men: not least that of young physiologists, many of whom gravitated to University College to work with Starling and himself. Bayliss possessed an honesty and a generosity of outlook, and a faculty of getting to the bottom of problems, which was coupled with great erudition. He died at his Hampstead home, St Cuthberts, West Heath Road, on 27 August 1924.<br>
