<span class="headword">Hill,  Thomas Wright</span>  (1763&#150;1851), <span class="occ">schoolmaster</span>, was born in Kidderminster on 24 April 1763. He was the son of James Hill, a baker and dealer in horse-corn, and his second wife, Sarah, who was the daughter of a Kidderminster apothecary named John Symonds. His forefathers for three generations had been freeholders and tradesmen of Kidderminster, descended from Walter Hill, a landowner of Abberley, Worcestershire (<i>d</i>. 1693). They claimed relationship with Samuel Butler, author of <span class="italic">Hudibras</span>. Both of his parents were strict dissenters and Hill received part of his education at a school kept by Stephen Addington, a dissenting minister, at Market Harborough, Leicestershire. He was afterwards moved to Kidderminster grammar school. In early childhood he developed a taste for literature, and interested himself in mathematics, astronomy, and natural philosophy. When nine years old he attended several of the philosophical lectures of James Ferguson, of which he gives an interesting account in his autobiography.<br>
<br>When fourteen years of age Hill was apprenticed to a brass-founder in Birmingham, but he found the business uncongenial, and his voluntary efforts as a Sunday school teacher at the chapel of Joseph Priestley led him ultimately to devote his special attention to teaching. He joined Priestley's congregation, and was much influenced by his pastor, whose scientific interests he shared.<br>
<br>On 29 July 1791 Hill married Sarah Lea (1765&#150;1842), the daughter of a Birmingham working man. They had six surviving children: <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13286/', "Matthew Davenport Hill")</script>; <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13272/', "Edwin Hill")</script>; <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13299/', "Sir Rowland Hill")</script>, the postal reformer; Arthur Hill, headmaster of Bruce Castle School; <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/54053/', "Frederic Hill")</script>, inspector of prisons; and Caroline Hill, who became the wife of Francis Clark of Birmingham. Honest, guileless, and unconventional, Hill was said to have been endowed with every sense but common sense. That deficiency his wife, a woman of strong character, tried to supply.<br>
<br>A manufacture of woollen stuffs in which Hill had engaged was ruined in 1795 by the French war. The family moved to Wolverhampton, where Hill became a works superintendent. Reduced to great straits, at the suggestion of his wife he opened a school in order that his children might be properly educated. The school was first opened in 1803 at Hill Top, then on the outskirts of Birmingham. His simple love of truth and courtesy made him a fair teacher, but he lacked mental perspective, and treated all kinds of knowledge as of equal importance. His private pupils in mathematics in the town included Edwin Guest, afterwards master of Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, and Benjamin Hall Kennedy, afterwards professor of Greek at Cambridge. Hill never freed himself from debt, but his buoyant optimism never allowed his poverty to trouble him, although his wife felt it keenly. Their son Rowland soon took charge of their money affairs, with admirable effect.<br>
<br>The school remained at Hill Top until 1819. Rowland had then become its chief director, and it was moved to Hazelwood. Although Hill did not retire from teaching until 1835 it is thought that his sons Rowland and Matthew were largely responsible for the modernization of Hazelwood School in accordance with the principles of utilitarian and radical educational thought. The school attracted a great deal of attention from Jeremy Bentham and other members of the Chrestomathic group and in 1827 a new branch was opened at Bruce Castle in Tottenham. This eventually superseded Hazelwood School, which closed in 1833. Hill died at his home in Bruce Terrace, Tottenham, on 13 June 1851, aged eighty-eight.<br>
<br>Hill's <span class="italic">Remains</span>, containing an autobiographical fragment and some notices of his life, were privately printed in London in 1859. A volume of selections from his papers appeared in London in 1860. It includes a brief account of his system of shorthand. He originally devised this ingenious system about 1802, and by various changes at length reduced it to a complete philosophical alphabet, on a strictly phonetic basis, without depriving it of its stenographic character. His hope that it might come into general use was not realized. The volume also includes &#145;A system of numerical nomenclature and notation, grounded on the principles of abstract utility&#146; (1845); in this new system the names of the numbers are made, by virtue of arithmetical significance given to the vowels and diphthongs, to indicate their precise meaning by their structure.<br>
<br>Among his other activities Hill made a close study of letter sounds. Dr Guest, his former pupil, attributed to him the discovery of &#145;the distinction between vocal and whisper letters&#146;  (<span class="italic">A History of English Rhythms</span>, 1838, 1.9). Perhaps the most significant product of his inventiveness was his scheme for proportional representation, to ensure the representation of minorities in elections. The idea, apparently the result of Hill's mathematical interests, was adopted for committee elections in a scientific society founded by his son, Rowland, and was recommended by Rowland Hill in 1839 for adoption in municipal elections in South Australia. Hill has been accounted the first Englishman to propound the idea of a single transferable vote as the basis for proportional representation  (Hart, 7&#150;9).<br>
