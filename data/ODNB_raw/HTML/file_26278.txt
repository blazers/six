<span class="headword">Stanley,  Thomas</span>, first Baron Stanley  (1406&#150;1459), <span class="occ">magnate</span>, was born on 2 August 1406, the eldest son of Sir John Stanley (<i>d</i>. 1437) and Isabel Harrington, and grandson of Sir John Stanley of Lathom (<i>c</i>.1350&#150;1414), a soldier and courtier who was controller of Richard II's household and steward of Henry IV's. Thomas Stanley was introduced early into aristocratic and court circles. His marriage to Joan, daughter of Sir Robert Goushill, may have taken place as early as 1422, when he appears with John (V) Mowbray, duke of Norfolk (<i>d</i>. 1432), Joan's half-brother, among the feoffees of James, Lord Berkeley (<i>d</i>. 1463), her brother-in-law. He represented Lancashire in parliament in October 1427, and may have been knighted at Henry VI's coronation in November 1429. In other respects his early career had a definite orientation towards the Irish Sea. In 1425 he was resident at The Tower in Liverpool, the base from which the Stanleys ruled their island kingdom of Man, and in January 1431 he was appointed lieutenant of Ireland for six years. In this office he built up a large retinue, and considerable credit with a regime that lacked funds but could show great favour.<br>
<br>The beginnings of Henry VI's personal rule formed the context for rapid advancement. In the royal entourage from 1436, Stanley had been appointed controller of the household by April 1439. Thenceforward he was prominent among the clique that, under the leadership of William de la Pole, earl and later duke of Suffolk (<i>d</i>. 1450), ruled in the king's name. He was appointed constable of Chester Castle in 1437, chamberlain of north Wales in 1439, and, in survivorship with Suffolk, justiciar of Chester and north Wales in 1443. The beneficiary of considerable patronage, largely but not exclusively in his native region, in October 1443 he was granted the castle and lordship of Mold and Moldsdale (Clwyd) in tail male.<br>
<br>His father's death in 1437 made Stanley the greatest landowner in the north-west. His territorial power and his influence at court were mutually reinforcing. Local men looked to him to advance their careers and arbitrate their quarrels as their singular &#145;good lord&#146;. In September 1446, for example, he arbitrated in a dispute involving Vale Royal Abbey, and resolved a bloody feud between the Venables and Bulkeley families by imposing a sort of wergeld. Conversely, the royal household saw him as the man to harness the resources of the palatinates of Chester and Lancaster, and the principality of Wales. Stanley provided the regime with military muscle. From 1442 until her death in 1452 he was responsible for the custody of Eleanor Cobham, and in 1447 for the arrest of her husband, Humphrey, duke of Gloucester, the king's uncle. In the wake of Cade's rebellion in 1450 he led troops, mainly Cheshire and Lancashire men, to ravage Kent. Later that year he and his officers in north Wales sought to block the return of Richard, duke of York (<i>d</i>. 1460), from Ireland.<br>
<br>The attack on the Suffolk regime in 1450&#150;51 did not leave Stanley unscathed. In October 1450 he resigned the justiciarship of north Wales, and the <span class="roman">Act of Resumption</span> of 1451 required him to surrender the lordship of Mold. Meanwhile parliament demanded his removal from the royal household, and he was replaced as controller by his cousin Sir Richard Harrington. The increasingly bloody factional struggles of the Wars of the Roses obviously posed serious challenges to his position. Yet Stanley was better placed than most of his fellow magnates. With a firm power base and a large and disciplined following, he was a man with whom regimes had to deal. An adroit politician, he was appointed to the council during the first protectorate (1454&#150;5), and blocked the duke of Exeter's attempt to raise a curialist rebellion in Lancashire. Arriving at St Albans in force but too late to prevent a Yorkist victory on 22 May 1455, he adumbrated the strategy of waiting on events which was the Stanley hallmark throughout the Wars of the Roses. It served his retainers, and himself, well. He emerged from the mayhem as chamberlain of the household in summer 1455, and is referred to as a peer of the realm by November.<br>
<br>In January 1456 Stanley was summoned to parliament as Lord Stanley. His elevation was more than justified by his landed wealth, his role in national life, and his connections with the nobility. Through her Fitzalan mother, his wife, and thus their children, were of royal blood. His eldest son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26279/', "Thomas Stanley, the future earl of Derby")</script>, married Eleanor, daughter of Richard Neville, earl of Salisbury (<i>d</i>. 1460), while his younger son <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26282/', "Sir William Stanley")</script> became steward of the prince of Wales's household after the accession of Edward IV. He himself was installed as knight of the Garter in 1457. With the increasing polarization between a resurgent court party headed by Queen Margaret and a York&#150;Neville alliance, however, his position became more difficult. A critical moment came in the summer of 1459 when, with the queen marshalling her forces in the midlands, and the earl of Salisbury crossing from Yorkshire to join his allies at Ludlow, the civil war came close to the borders of Cheshire. At the battle of Bloreheath local men fell on both sides, but the bulk of the Stanley forces remained aloof. By then, however, the first Lord Stanley was no longer the head of the lineage. He had died on 11 February 1459.<br>
