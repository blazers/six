<span class="headword">Macdonald,  John</span>  (1779&#150;1849), <span class="occ">Free Church of Scotland minister</span>, was born at Reay, Caithness, on 12 November 1779, second son of James Macdonald or MacAdie (1735&#150;1830) and his second wife, a daughter of John Mackay. His father, originally a weaver, was the local catechist. John was educated at the parish school and soon showed remarkable mathematical ability, being employed by the local farmers to help with their accounts. He went on to King's College, Aberdeen, graduating MA in 1801. He was licensed by the presbytery of Caithness in July 1805. In September, and at the request of Sir John Sinclair, he went on an expedition to research Ossianic traditions in the north-west highlands. He returned to serve as missionary at Achreny and Halladale for six months. In September 1806 he was ordained missionary minister at Berriedale. It was in that year that he married Georgina Ross of Gledfield, with whom he had three children before her death in August 1814.<br>
<br>In January 1807 Macdonald became minister of the Gaelic chapel, Edinburgh, which was supported by the Society in Scotland for the Propagation of Christian Knowledge (SSPCK), and it was here that he established his reputation as a preacher. In September 1813 he was presented to the parish of Urquhart, Ross and Cromarty, by Duncan George Forbes of Culloden, in succession to Charles Calder. Using this as a base, he conducted an itinerant ministry in Caithness and Ross which, because of its implied criticism of them, was greatly resented by neighbouring ministers. This practice was condemned by the general assembly of 1818. It was on 11 May of this year that he married again, his second wife being Janet, eldest daughter of Kenneth Mackenzie of Millbank, with whom he had a further seven children, including <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17431/', "Duncan George Forbes Macdonald")</script>.<br>
<br>Macdonald's missionary impulses, which earned him the sobriquet &#145;Apostle of the North&#146;, were channelled to less controversial effect when he took an interest in the spiritual welfare of the remote island community of St Kilda. At the request of the SSPCK he visited the islands between 1822 and 1824, eventually raising sufficient money to keep a minister there, whom he introduced to the islanders in 1830. He also visited London in 1823, at the request of the London Missionary Society, where he met Samuel Wilberforce. In 1827 he was invited to visit Ireland by Robert Daly, rector of Powerscourt and later bishop of Cashel. He was able to adapt his Gaelic sufficiently for an Irish audience. In 1842 he was honoured with the degree of DD from the University of New York.<br>
<br>Macdonald's influence and position were confirmed at the Disruption of 1843, where he was credited with much of the Free Church's success in the highlands. In David Octavius Hill's representational painting of that event he is a central figure, shown standing behind Patrick Macfarlan, waiting to sign the deed of demission. In 1845 he acted as Gaelic moderator when the Free Church general assembly met for a second time that year in Inverness. His publications included the diary of his visits to St Kilda (1830), sermons, and Gaelic verses (1848). He died at Urquhart on 16 April 1849 and was buried there beside his revered predecessor, Charles Calder, on 24 April.<br>
