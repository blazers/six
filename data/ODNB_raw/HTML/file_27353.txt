<span class="headword">Thornton, Sir  Edward</span>, count of Cassilhas in the Portuguese nobility  (1766&#150;1852), <span class="occ">diplomatist</span>, was born on 22 October 1766. He was the third son of William Thornton, a Yorkshireman settled in London as an innkeeper, and brother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27363/', "Thomas Thornton (d. 1814)")</script>. Early left an orphan, he was educated at Christ's Hospital, before being admitted sizar of Pembroke College, Cambridge, on 19 June 1785; he graduated BA as third wrangler in 1789. He took the members' prize in 1791, being elected a fellow and proceeding MA in 1798.<br>
<br>In 1789 Thornton became tutor to the sons of James Bland Burges, under-secretary of state for foreign affairs. Burges took a great liking to him, and recommended him to George Hammond, who, when he became the first minister accredited to the United States in 1791, appointed Thornton as his secretary. In June 1793 Thornton became British vice-consul in Maryland, and in March 1796 secretary of legation at Washington; he acted as charg&eacute; d'affaires from 1800, when the then minister returned to England, until 1804. In November 1804 Thornton accepted an appointment in Egypt, which he did not take up; in May 1805 he became minister-plenipotentiary to the circle of Lower Saxony and resident with the Hanse towns, his headquarters being at Hamburg. From there he had to retire to Kiel on the approach of the French troops, and in August 1807 he returned to England.<br>
<br>On 10 December 1807 Thornton was sent to Sweden as envoy-extraordinary and minister-plenipotentiary, with a view to obtaining an offensive and defensive alliance against Napoleon. In November 1808 he returned to England unsuccessful, and for a time was prevented by the hostile attitude of Sweden from returning to his post. In October 1811 he again went to Sweden on a special mission in HMS <i>Victory</i>, negotiated treaties of alliance with both Sweden and Russia, and thus assisted in the first step towards the union of the northern powers against Napoleon. On 5 August 1812 he was again appointed envoy-extraordinary. In 1813 he negotiated the treaty with Denmark by which Heligoland was ceded to Great Britain. From 1813 to 1815 he accompanied the prince royal of Sweden (Bernadotte) in the field, and was present at the entrance of the allies into Paris. In 1816 he was sworn of the privy council.<br>
<br>On 29 July 1817 Thornton was appointed minister to Portugal, and in this capacity went to the Portuguese court in Brazil. On 12 April 1819 he was temporarily granted the rank of ambassador, and held it until March 1821, when he returned to England. In August 1823 he went to Portugal as envoy-extraordinary and minister-plenipotentiary, but was only there a year, during which he invested the king with the Order of the Garter, and sheltered him during the insurrection. For this he was created count of Cassilhas by the king of Portugal, the title to run for two further lives. He became a GCB in 1822. He retired from the service on a pension in August 1824.<br>
<br>Thornton married, in 1812, Wilhelmina Kohp, a Hanoverian, with whom he had one daughter and six sons, one of whom, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36511/', "Sir Edward Thornton, GCB (1817&#150;1906)")</script>, followed him in the diplomatic service. After his retirement Thornton purchased Wembury House, Plymouth, where he died on 3 July 1852. He was an unusual example of a self-made diplomatist.<br>
