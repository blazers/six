<span class="headword">Harrison,  Henry</span>  (<em>c.</em>1785&#150;<em>c.</em>1865), <span class="occ">architect</span>, was born in London, the son of John Harrison, a builder and surveyor. His brother George was also a builder&#150;developer, and Henry seems to have engaged in the business on his own account. Harrison averred that he had been &#145;brought up as a builder and architect&#146;, and his family were indeed at the heart of the London building trade  (<span class="italic">Report from the Select Committee on the Office of Works and Public Buildings</span>, 1828). Between 1803 and 1809 Harrison exhibited a number of views at the Royal Academy, including a &#145;design for a temple&#146; in 1806. His first documented work as an architect seems to have been Richmond Terrace, Whitehall, which his brother George built 1822&#150;5. Harrison in fact adapted this from a design by Thomas Chawner, supplying the working drawings himself. Its severe Greek revival style is of the mainstream for its date, though Harrison's use of yellow stock brick and Bath stone, instead of stucco, imparts a warmer quality to the building. The General Lying-in Hospital on York Road, Lambeth (1828), is in the same idiom, severe and well designed, with a portico in antis of giant Ionic columns.<br>
<br>In the 1820s Harrison established a wealthy clientele, almost all of them from the landed aristocracy or gentry, building or altering numerous town houses in Mayfair or St James's, most of these in the Italianate style then favoured by the Grosvenor estate. His clients included the second Viscount Hampden at 61 Green Street (1824), the earl of Kinnoull at 51 Grosvenor Street (1826), and the earl of Carysfort at 46 Upper Grosvenor Street (1827). Harrison's prosperity at the time, and his connections with Mayfair, were alike expressed in the construction of his own house, 31 Park Street, Grosvenor Square, built 1825&#150;6, and occupied by Harrison 1828&#150;39. The most eminent of all these jobs was the reconstruction, <i>c</i>.1821, of Bath House, 82 Piccadilly (dem. 1963), for Alexander Baring, first Lord Ashburton. Harrison's work in Mayfair has suffered from very heavy losses; notable survivals are the Greek revival rear elevation of 61 Green Street (1824 and later) and three Italianate houses at 10&#150;11 Upper Grosvenor Street and 62 Park Street (1843&#150;4).<br>
<br>In the 1820s Harrison managed to establish valuable connections in Cornwall, where he carried out a good deal of work over the period 1825&#150;34. These probably began with work for the second earl of St Germans at Port Eliot. Sir John Soane had remodelled the house 1804&#150;6; Harrison added a new entrance front and adjacent service wing, in the plainest Tudor gothic, as severe and symmetrical as any of his Grecian buildings, in 1825&#150;9. This was followed by work at Heligan, where Harrison made alterations for J. H. Tremayne (1830); at Carclew, near Mylor, where he made additions for Sir Charles Lemon (<i>c</i>.1830; burnt), and at Enys, near Mylor, where he built a severely plain granite house for J. S. Enys (1833). The new house at Enys was exceptional; most of Harrison's commissions consisted in refurbishment or alteration, and relatively few involved designing from scratch. Nevertheless, he had already demonstrated at Port Eliot that he could design in the gothic style, and used this again in almshouses (1829&#150;33) at Saffron Walden, Essex, for the local magnate, Lord Braybrooke of Audley End, and in alterations to a house called Pendarves in Cornwall (1832; dem. 1955).<br>
<br>From around 1823 Harrison was surveyor to the Holland estate in west London, and thus had an important role in the development of this area. He produced the general layout plans, and also took a number of plots as builder&#150;developer on Kensington High Street. The most important element of these was the ambitious St Mary Abbot's Terrace (1825&#150;30; dem. <i>c</i>.1960), a series of pairs of four-storey houses, with a grand pedimented centre, similar to that at the General Lying-in Hospital. Harrison's activities as a builder&#150;developer ended in bankruptcy in 1840. There are fewer known works from after 1840, though one of his finest and most prestigious buildings, the new Guards' Club at 70 Pall Mall, in a fashionable Italianate style, dated from 1848&#150;9; this, too, has been demolished. Harrison does not seem to have recovered fully from the bankruptcy, for in 1856, around the age of seventy, he applied (unsuccessfully) for the post of architect to the Metropolitan Board of Works. In 1864 he was resident in Bedford Square; thereafter his name disappears from the London Post Office directories. He does not seem to have received an obituary in the architectural press.<br>
