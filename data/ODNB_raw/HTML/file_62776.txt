<span class="headword">Joyce,  Archibald</span>  (1873&#150;1963), <span class="occ">composer</span>, was born Arthur Joyce on 25 May 1873 at 68 Winchester Street, Pimlico, London, the son of William Benjamin Joyce, a band sergeant in the Grenadier Guards, and his wife, Minna Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Hankinson. He went to school in Paddington, sang as a boy chorister, and learned the piano and violin. From his teens, Joyce worked as a pianist at various dance schools in the West End, occasionally also playing for music-halls, hotels, restaurants, transatlantic liners, and private balls. He also adopted the performing name of Archibald. About 1900 he began taking bookings for his own ensemble, the Archibald Joyce Dance Orchestra, whose reputation grew until he needed no other employment. Its numbers varied: a large orchestra supplied music for aristocratic balls during the London season; the core musicians then went on tour, performing at seaside pavilions and great houses.<br>
<br>From arranging dance medleys, Joyce progressed to composing. His first publication, a two-step, &#145;The Moke's Parade&#146; (1905), made no great mark. The waltz &#145;Sweet Memories&#146; did better in 1908, when he hit on his winning formula with &#145;Songe d'automne&#146;. A succession of similar waltzes followed: &#145;Vision d'amour&#146; (1909), &#145;A jamais&#146; (1909), &#145;A Thousand Kisses&#146; (1910), &#145;Charming&#146; (1912), &#145;Maiden's Blush&#146; (1913), &#145;Entrancing&#146; (1914), &#145;Love's Mystery&#146; (1915), and others. The appeal of &#145;Vision of Salome&#146; (1909), with transient modulations to minor keys to evoke the mysterious East, warranted three sequels with her name in the title. By far his greatest triumph, however, was &#145;Dreaming&#146; (1911), which swept the ballrooms of the world, selling a million copies in a decade. Over forty different recordings of it were made in the twentieth century.<br>
<br>Joyce's publishers, Ascherberg, Hopwood, and Crew, marketed him as &#145;The English Waltz King&#146;, implying a comparison to Johann Strauss the younger that cannot be taken seriously. He was more directly inspired by Franz Leh&aacute;r&#151;in particular, by the waltz duet from act <span class="smallcap">II</span> of <span class="italic">The Merry Widow</span> (running in London 1907&#150;9), which established the vogue for dreamy smoothness as opposed to exuberant brilliance. The typical Joyce waltz comprised a very brief introduction followed by three slow, sentimental melodies, with the main one much repeated before a soft coda. Even if he never quite equalled the sensuous quality achieved by Leh&aacute;r or Leo Fall, he did well to compete at all, for British composers had failed to produce much original dance music in the nineteenth century. Joyce announced himself the first Englishman to have waltzes published on the continent. Then, in 1912, Sydney Baynes's &#145;Destiny&#146; and Charles Ancliffe's &#145;Nights of Gladness&#146; joined Joyce's &#145;Dreaming&#146; as defining examples of &#145;the English waltz&#146;.<br>
<br>The Archibald Joyce Dance Orchestra ceased to be a permanent body after 1914, as many of its members enlisted. By then, its founder owned a large house beside Clapham Common and a car (for motoring was his hobby). He married Florence Mary (<i>b</i>. 1888/9), daughter of William Alfred Latter, a farmer's manager, on 28 July 1919.<br>
<br>Though Joyce had sometimes conducted in the theatre, notably for Ellen Terry, and his style echoed musical comedy, he wrote only twice for the stage. <span class="italic">Toto</span>, a flimsy tale of &#145;Gay Paree&#146;, jointly composed with Merlin Morgan, ran a mediocre seventy-seven nights in London in 1916 but toured until 1920. He collaborated with G. H. Clutsam on <span class="italic">Gabrielle</span>, which, without ever reaching the West End, did good enough business in the provinces 1921&#150;4.<br>
<br>The visit of the Original Dixieland Jazz Band to London in 1919 transformed popular dance music. Like many Edwardian musicians, Joyce fled saxophones, banjos, and syncopated foxtrots, leaving the dance-halls to younger men. He found refuge in the emergent genre of British light music, and, although he was no Albert Ket&egrave;lbey or Eric Coates, resort orchestras and amateur pianists happily filled out their repertories with his polka &#145;Frou Frou&#146;, suites like &#145;Caravan&#146;, and sundry marches and novelty pieces.<br>
<br>Joyce abandoned inner London in 1927, moving to Bexhill-on-Sea and then in 1932 to his last home in Sutton, Surrey. After a fallow decade, the advent of &#145;old tyme&#146; dancing in the 1940s elicited a flurry of late works, such as &#145;Brighton Hike&#146;, a sprightly military two-step, but even the nostalgia market had faded away by the time of his death from heart failure at 75 Langley Park Road, Sutton, on 22 March 1963. Thereafter his name appeared only in connection with the claim that &#145;Songe d'automne&#146; was the final piece played on the <i>Titanic</i>. However, a compact disc in 1996 salvaged a selection of his music from oblivion.<br>
