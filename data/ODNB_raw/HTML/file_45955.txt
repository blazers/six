<span class="headword">Eckford,  Henry</span>  (1775&#150;1832), <span class="occ">naval architect and shipbuilder</span>, was born on 12 March 1775 at Kilwinning, in Ayrshire, Scotland, the son of John Eckford and his wife, Janet Black. At the age of sixteen, in 1791, he went to Canada and began to study the principles and practice of ship design in the Quebec yard of his uncle John Black. After five years he moved to New York where he soon found work in a shipyard. He married, on 13 April 1799, Marion, daughter of Joseph and Miriam Bedell, and in the following year set up his own shipyard.<br>
<br>Eckford's ships came to be known for their strength and speed, and after the outbreak of war in 1812 he built a number of notable US Navy warships, being appointed naval constructor at the Brooklyn navy yard in 1817. He resigned three years later and resumed work in his own yard, building the <i>Robert Fulton</i> which made the first successful seagoing voyage by steam power from New York to New Orleans and Havana in 1822. He became interested in politics and made some influential friends, two of whom married his daughters. In 1825 the failure of an insurance company lost him much of his fortune, and three years later personal tragedy followed when three of his children died. The last ship he built was a corvette in which he sailed to Europe in 1831. The ship was bought by the sultan of Turkey who put Eckford in charge of the imperial naval shipyard, but in the following year he fell ill and died at Constantinople, on 12 November 1832. His body was returned to the United States in a barrel of spirits.<br>
