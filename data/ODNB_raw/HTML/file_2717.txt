<span class="headword">Blundeville,  Thomas  de</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1236), <span class="occ">bishop of Norwich</span>, was a member of a minor gentry family who held small estates of the honour of Hockering at Deopham and Newton Flotman in Norfolk. His uncles were <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/3991/', "Hubert de Burgh")</script>, the justiciar, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/95140/', "Geoffrey de Burgh")</script>, bishop of Ely, and his older brother William served as constable of Corfe Castle. He himself became an exchequer clerk, and by 1225 was constable of the Tower of London. In September 1226 he was appointed dean of the royal free chapel of Tettenhall in Staffordshire, but within a month he was granted custody of the bishopric of Norwich, to which he was elected in October; the temporalities were restored on 21 November, and he was consecrated on 20 December, the day after he was ordained priest. In September 1227 he was one of those sent to Antwerp to meet the imperial ambassadors, but after his elevation, apart from attendance at great councils such as Merton in January 1236, there is little evidence of continued service to the crown outside East Anglia where, for example, he was custodian of Norwich Castle until September 1228.<br>
<br>Within his diocese, the main evidence for Blundeville's activities is provided by a collection of almost a hundred <i>acta</i>. He obtained various grants for the bishopric and church of Norwich from Henry III, and was himself generous to the monks of the cathedral priory, who commemorated him as a benefactor. He conducted a visitation of his diocese in 1233, after the papal mandate to the English bishops so to do, and he acted on various occasions as papal judge-delegate. The main themes that emerge from his <i>acta</i> include his support of small new Augustinian houses such as Kersey in Suffolk and Spinney in Cambridgeshire; his insistence on the establishment of vicarages in parish churches appropriated to religious communities; and a campaign to extend the ecclesiastical patronage of the bishop by insisting, in return for financial concessions, that monastic patrons should allow him and his successors to choose the parochial clergy nominally presented by the religious. His episcopate saw another round of the long struggle between the diocesan and the men of Bishop's Lynn, this time in 1234 over the making of the mayor. He also battled with the priors of the Norfolk Benedictine houses of Binham and Wymondham over the extent of the obedience and reverence owed by daughter houses of exempt St Albans, and over the respective rights of bishop and priors in parish churches; this was settled amicably by papal judges-delegate. There is some evidence in the records of the king's courts of conflict between royal and ecclesiastical jurisdictions; the bishop's officers were frequently cited to appear at the <i>curia regis</i> to answer why they had heard cases in the court Christian which were beyond its competence according to the common law and after a writ of prohibition. In 1234 Blundeville claimed that the local sheriff was releasing to chancery excommunicates, who had been imprisoned on Blundeville's signification, before they had made satisfaction to the church.<br>
<br>Of Blundeville's personality and relationships there is little evidence. His career was obviously fostered by his uncle; his withdrawal from secular government, despite his earlier career in administration, may be explained either by Hubert de Burgh's loss of royal favour from late 1229, or by the opposition of the episcopate in general to the justiciar; but it was to Bishop Thomas's house at Terling in Essex (rather than, as some sources state, Brentwood) that Hubert fled, and whence he was dragged from the altar in September 1232. Some indication of Blundeville's religious sentiments is provided by his statement in a charter for Christ Church, Canterbury, of his devotion to St Thomas, and even more by his counter-seal, showing a bishop kneeling before the Virgin and Child with the legend <i>Est</i> <i>Thome</i> <i>signum Virgo</i>. He died on 16 August 1236 and was buried in his cathedral church.<br>
