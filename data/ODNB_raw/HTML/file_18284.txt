<span class="headword">Mason,  John Charles</span>  (1798&#150;1881), <span class="occ">East India Company servant</span>, was born in London in March 1798, the only son of Alexander Way Mason, chief clerk in the secretary's office of the East India Company's home establishment, and one of the founders and editors of the <span class="italic">East India Register</span> in 1803. His grandfather Charles Mason served with distinction in the expedition to Guadeloupe in 1758&#150;9 and with the allied army in Germany in 1762 and 1793&#150;6. Mason was educated at Monsieur de la Pierre's Commercial School, Hackney, and at Lord Weymouth's Grammar School, Warminster. For three years he worked in the office of Dunn, Wordsworth, and Dunn, solicitors, at 32 Threadneedle Street, until, in April 1817, he received an appointment as a clerk in the secretary's office at East India House on the ground of his father's services to the company.<br>
<br>From 1817 to 1837 Mason was almost wholly employed upon confidential duties under the committee of secrecy: in 1823 in negotiating a treaty with the government of the Netherlands for the exchange of settlements in India and the Malay peninsula and archipelago, in 1829 in arranging the secret signals for the East India Company's ships, in 1833 in negotiating for the renewal of the company's charter, and in 1834 in advising the parliamentary inquiry on matters connected with China. The company granted him several gratuities for his confidential work, which included transcribing the secrecy committee's papers from 1829 to 1834. In 1822 he compiled an <span class="italic">Index to the Debates at the East India House, 1815&#150;1822</span>; this was followed in 1825&#150;6 by <span class="italic">An analysis of the constitution of the East India Company, and of the laws passed by parliament for the government of their affairs at home and abroad</span>.<br>
<br>In 1837, on a salary of &pound;1000, Mason was appointed assistant in the newly formed marine branch of the secretary's office; under his management the Indian navy was improved and the coasts of India were surveyed. At the outbreak of the uprising of 1857 he expedited the transportation of 50,000 troops to India. In September 1858, upon the transfer of the government of India from the company to the crown, Mason retired from the service, but in January 1859 he was recalled to duty as secretary of the marine and transport department. The evidence he furnished to the select committees in 1860, 1861, and 1865 on the transport of troops to India led to his appointment in 1865 as the government of India's representative on the committee on the Indian overland troop transport service.<br>
<br>Mason retired in April 1867 with fifty years' service to his credit. With his wife, Jane Augusta (<i>d</i>. 1878), daughter of James Ensor, he had five daughters and an only son, Charles Alexander James (<i>b</i>. 1832), who in 1848 followed his father into the Indian home establishment. He became assistant secretary in the military department and retired in 1882. Mason died at his home, 12 Pembridge Gardens, Bayswater, London, on 21 December 1881.<br>
