<span class="headword">White,  Thomas</span>  (1550&#150;1624), <span class="occ">benefactor of Sion College, London</span>, was born in the parish of Temple, Bristol, the son of John White, a merchant of that city. It has often been asserted that he was descended from the Whites of Eaton Socon, Bedfordshire. He attended Oxford University and graduated BA from Magdalen Hall on 25 June 1570, MA on 1 July 1573. Shortly afterwards, on 23 November 1575, he was appointed vicar of St Dunstan-in-the-West, London, where his preaching was well received. He appears to have been associated with St Paul's School, attending its yearly &#145;apposition&#146; as an examiner in February 1577. On 3 November 1577 at Paul's Cross, during a visitation of the plague, White preached against usury and covetousness, especially such excessive indulgence as the use of down beds and the payment of cooks to produce elaborate meals. The plague, he declared, was a judgment: &#145;London builds apace, beware of blood and iniquity &hellip; God shall reckon with you in his rage and give you a taste of his anger, as an earnest penny in this life, of everlasting pains in the life to come&#146;  (White, <span class="italic">A Sermon Preached at Pawles Crosse on Sunday the thirde of November, 1577</span>, 1578, 56&#150;7).<br>
<br>White received the degree of BTh on 11 December 1581 and proceeded to the doctorate on 8 March 1585; briefly, between 1588 and 1591, he acted as vicar of St Gregory by Paul. A sermon given in this period, just after the defeat of the Armada, shows how his zealous patriotic protestantism could lead to criticism, even of the queen's government: &#145;Our gracious sovereign did suffer long, and too long, almost before she took the sword in hand, and stood to her defence in the cause of the gospel&#146;  (White, <span class="italic">A Sermon Preached at Pawles Crosse the 17 of November, 1589</span>, 1589, 59). But the conflict came anyway: &#145;hold you not your peace, but tell it in Spain, and in the islands there about &hellip; that as Elizabeth of England lived by the Grace of God &hellip; He that is mighty hath magnified her, and holy is his name&#146;  (ibid., 62).<br>
<br>White married twice, but of his first wife only her family name, Fortune, is known. His second wife, Elizabeth, daughter of William Bovey, a barber&#150;surgeon and citizen of London, died before her husband. Both women were buried in the chancel of St Dunstan's. There were no surviving children. White must not be confused with Thomas White (<i>d</i>. 1588), warden of New College, Oxford, from 1553 to 1573, archdeacon of Berkshire from 1557 to 1588, and chancellor of Salisbury Cathedral from 1571 to 1588&#151;especially since Thomas White of Bristol also attained high position in the dioceses of Salisbury and Oxford. On 21 April 1590 White was instituted by Archbishop Whitgift to the treasurership of Salisbury (with its annexed prebend of Calne). On 26 April 1587 he was awarded by the queen presentation to the next vacant canonry in Oxford diocese; he was installed in 1592 as canon of the eighth prebend.<br>
<br>White's many and lucrative benefices and his later status as a single and childless man combined to make him a wealthy individual. Already in 1613 he had built a hospital in his native Temple parish in Bristol and endowed it with &pound;92 per annum. At his death his circumstances made possible generous provision for several causes. His will, drawn up and signed on 20 February 1623, provided for five exhibitions of &pound;8 per year to scholars of Magdalen Hall, and &pound;4 to the principal, to be paid from the revenues of the manor of Langdon Hills in Essex. White provided for a lectureship at St Paul's in London, bequeathed his folio and Latin books to St George's Chapel, Windsor, and donated to the city of Bristol money for the improvement of roads and other municipal purposes. His will is also of interest for the light it throws on White's attitudes to crime. He financed a yearly lecture for:<blockquote>the poor prisoners of Newgate [who] may be manacled and sparred in iron chains hand to hand, men by themselves and women by themselves in long iron chains made for that purpose and so by some of their under officers to be brought there the lower way next Newgate &hellip; their sight for example to the people and youth their shame to be seen &hellip; And for their chains of iron and one docket to be made I give forty pounds.</blockquote>He states that concerning their execution:<blockquote>I would have two ancient honest women to be chosen yearly by the sheriffs of London who together with the executioner only shall strip their body to the end their shame may be covered with such sorry linen as they have &hellip; to hide from the people their secrets &hellip; for it is a sin and a shame for the multitude to stand at such times to feed their eyes with such woeful sights and this will breed remorse in others to leave thieving. (Sampson, 20&#150;22)</blockquote>White also founded a professorship of moral philosophy at Oxford, with a stipend of &pound;100 per annum to be paid to the university from the revenues of his manor of Langdon Hills. The lectures thus inaugurated were to be aimed chiefly at undergraduates. In providing for the new foundation, White had offered little guidance as to the content of the course to be offered; accordingly, despite Laudian attempts to impose the teaching of Aristotle, many professors gave sermons, which did little for the reputation of the lecture.<br>
<br>Much the largest of White's bequests was the &pound;3000 which he provided for Sion College and for an almshouse, to be built close by. White was clearly very anxious that his college should be under the firm control of the bishop of London, and provided for a governing body which included two deans and four assistants under the bishop's presidency. It was on this basis that on 7 March 1626 Sion College received its original charter. Ironically, however, &#145;Someone at court, possibly Laud himself &hellip; seems to have objected that it was derogatory to the Bishop's prestige that he should sit as even the perpetual primus of co-equal presbyters&#146;  (Huelin, 63). It appears that this was so unthinkable that the charter was revised to provide for the president's election from the fellows; the bishop would act as visitor. The amended charter was given the royal assent on 6 July 1626, and the college was built on a site acquired in April 1627 at the junction of Aldermanbury, London Wall, and Philip Lane. Its fine library attained a wide reputation.<br>
<br>White died on 1 March 1624 and was buried in the chancel of St Dunstan-in-the-West. His funeral sermon was given by William Price, first reader of the lecture in moral philosophy. The text, to which other academics added verses, was published in <span class="italic">Schola moralis philosophiae Oxon in funere Whiti</span> (1624). A portrait of White, for long in the possession of the Bristol almshouse, was copied and sent in May 1832 to Sion College in London; in 1957 this portrait was restored and hung in the college dining hall.<br>
