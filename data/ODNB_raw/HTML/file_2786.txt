<span class="headword">Buckingham,  John</span>  (<em>c.</em>1320&#150;1399), <span class="occ">administrator and bishop of Lincoln</span>, was born on 23 June about 1320; his family was of much less than gentry rank. Earliest references link him to Thomas Beauchamp, earl of Warwick (<i>d</i>. 1369). Buckingham's arms, gules a cross bottonny or, were closely based on the Beauchamp arms, and he was instituted to both Compton Murdack prebend in St Mary's College, Warwick, in 1344, and to Sutton Coldfield rectory in 1346 at Warwick's presentation. In April 1347 Warwick, the hereditary chamberlain, appointed him deputy chamberlain of the king's exchequer of receipt, and thereafter Buckingham's rise in royal service was steady; on 14 February 1350 he was appointed keeper of the great wardrobe, on 5 January 1353 controller of the wardrobe, and keeper of the wardrobe from 23 February 1353 to 26 February 1357; on 4 April 1357 he became an exchequer baron. With Robert Herle, another Beauchamp adherent, Buckingham was co-lieutenant of Brittany for a year from 29 September 1358, the only clerk to be appointed lieutenant of a duchy during the Hundred Years' War. When Edward III led an expedition to France in the autumn of 1359 Buckingham became keeper of the privy seal of the regent, Thomas of Woodstock (<i>d</i>. 1397), his duties running from 28 October for 204 days. On 1 July 1360 he was promoted keeper of the king's privy seal and continued in this position until 9 June 1363. Buckingham thus held a senior government position during the negotiations leading to the treaty of Br&eacute;tigny, and was present at Calais on 24 October 1360 to witness ratification of the treaty.<br>
<br>Meanwhile, Buckingham's ecclesiastical career was prospering. An acolyte by 1344, he was ordained priest by the bishop of Worcester in 1346, by virtue of a letter dimissory from the bishop of Lichfield. In 1348 he was presented to Olney church, Buckinghamshire, by Warwick's son-in-law Ralph Basset, and by Edward III to a prebend in St Stephen's College, Westminster. In 1349 he was briefly archdeacon of Nottingham but resigned in November, preparatory to promotion to the deanship of Lichfield in early 1350, in which post he proved energetic and conscientious. In 1351, following a dispute over prebends in Lincoln Cathedral, he obtained that of Gretton. His election as bishop of Ely during the autumn of 1361 was set aside by the provision of Simon Langham (<i>d</i>. 1376) on 10 January following; Buckingham, apparently consoled at first by promotion to several lucrative prebends, was subsequently elected bishop of the major see of Lincoln, by 4 October 1362, in succession to John Gynewell. However, Urban V (<i>r</i>. 1362&#150;70) was unwilling to confirm the election until Buckingham had been examined to prove his educational fitness for the position; this examination, along with the support of both Edward III and the captive Jean, king of France, was successful in persuading the pope of Buckingham's suitability. He was provided on 5 April 1363 and consecrated at Wargrave, Berkshire, on 25 June, two days after receiving his temporalities from the king.<br>
<br>After becoming bishop of Lincoln, Buckingham ceased at once to hold any formal position in government or to undertake diplomatic missions. He was replaced as keeper of the privy seal on 10 June 1363. His itinerary shows that he was a resident, working diocesan whose favourite residence was Lyddington, Rutland; most journeys outside the diocese can be accounted for by attendance at parliament or convocation. Nevertheless, Edward III appointed him an executor on 7 October 1376. Granted life exemption from attending parliament on account of age and infirmity in 1384, he attended two later parliaments in 1390 and 1394. From autumn 1390 he became much less active, staying almost entirely at his three Lincolnshire manors, and he remained continuously at Stow Park, Lincolnshire, for six months during the winter of 1395&#150;6.<br>
<br>Buckingham was a strong supporter of the Carthusian order. He founded a cell in both the London and the Coventry charterhouses, and was a visitor to (in August 1386), and benefactor of, the Hull charterhouse. At Lincoln he left his mark on two works undertaken in his episcopate, the cathedral choir stalls and the entrance range of the vicars' court, both decorated with his arms. He is, however, best known as the bishop in whose diocese John Wyclif (<i>d</i>. 1384) lived and wrote, and in which Lollardy first took root. As a man without university education, and the bishop who in 1367 had seen episcopal authority over Oxford finally quashed by the papacy, Buckingham was in no position to discipline members of the university, but he took action against a number of other heretics, notably William Swinderby of Leicester, John Corringham, vicar of Diddington, Huntingdonshire, Thomas Compworth of Thrupp, Oxfordshire, Sir Thomas Latimer, lord of Braybrooke, Northamptonshire, and the Lollards of Northampton, especially the anchoress Anna Palmer. He attended the Blackfriars Council in May 1382, where the issue of heresy was taken firmly in hand. Beset on one side by heresy, Buckingham battled on the other against superstition, especially in Lincolnshire; the veneration of trees and the apparent substitution of bacon and eggs for the elements at Easter mass were among his concerns.<br>
<br>Walsingham's assertion that Buckingham was a political ally of John of Gaunt, duke of Lancaster, is unsubstantiated; the two had extensive contacts but only of a formal nature. Both were executors of Edward III's will and trustees of that property which eventually came to three religious houses, notably the abbey of St Mary Graces, London. Buckingham, the last surviving trustee, on 1 March 1399 released to St Mary Graces his rights in seven Kentish and two Surrey manors.<br>
<br>By then Buckingham had only a short time to live. He was not permitted to end his days at Lincoln, for on 27 February 1398 he was translated to the see of Coventry and Lichfield to make way for the promotion of Henry Beaufort (<i>d</i>. 1447) to Lincoln. Walsingham regarded the move as the responsibility of Beaufort's father, John of Gaunt. But Buckingham refused to move to Lichfield, and continued to rule Lincoln diocese until 12 July 1398. His movements then are obscure until around 25 August, by when he had arrived at Canterbury, where he spent the last few months of his life in Meister Omers, a house (still standing) which was part of the infirmary of Christ Church Priory. He died on 10 March 1399. His will, dated 9 February 1399, directed his burial in Canterbury Cathedral where his damaged memorial brass was seen by William Somner before 1640. Buckingham died a wealthy man. Precise bequests totalled upwards of &pound;530, and his executors gave Canterbury Cathedral a further &pound;1200 to found a chantry for his soul. Though he evidently had a large collection of vestments (but only declared two books, both psalters), Buckingham nevertheless directed that his funeral was to be conducted without worldly pomp.<br>
