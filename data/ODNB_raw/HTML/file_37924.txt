<span class="headword">Rushout,  John</span>, second Baron Northwick  (1769&#150;1859), <span class="occ">collector and art connoisseur</span>, was born on 16 February 1769, the eldest son in the family of two sons and three daughters of Sir John Rushout (<i>d</i>. 1800), later first Baron Northwick, and his wife, Rebecca, daughter of Humphrey Bowles of Wanstead in Essex. He was descended from a Flemish family, who moved to London as merchants in the reign of Charles I and settled at Northwick, Worcestershire. Rushout's father chose an unconventional education for him: instead of a public school followed by university, he was sent to a school in Hackney and then to Neufch&acirc;tel.<br>
<br>Rushout spent a year in Spain before travelling in September 1793 to Italy, where he remained until 1800 as an attach&eacute; to the ambassador to the king of Naples. He travelled extensively throughout Italy; his &#145;voyage de catalogue&#146;  (priv. coll.) records places and dates but gives little information about the impression the cities made on him. He made friendships among many of the most eminent men of the day, including Edward Gibbon, Horatio Nelson (Viscount Nelson), Sir William Hamilton and his wife, Richard Payne Knight, Antonio Canova, and Vincenzo Camuccini. He later wrote that he had developed:<blockquote>an unbounded admiration for the works of the most refined art in painting, sculpture and architecture, with which [Rome] then abounded &hellip; These were the seductive amusements of my youth: they have clung to me through a long life, and they are now the solace of my old age. (Ingamells, 830)</blockquote>The classical scholar J. B. S. Morritt recorded that when he met Rushout in Naples in 1795 the latter's collection of medals had already reached 12,000, and that Rushout had given up &#145;his whole time to it [collecting] from morning to night&#146;  (ibid.).<br>
<br>Rushout returned to England on succeeding his father as second Baron Northwick in 1800, and was able to devote himself to the formation of the collection for which Northwick Park became famous. In his introduction to the catalogue of Northwick pictures (1921), Tancred Borenius wrote that Lord Northwick was a:<blockquote>collector of very high intelligence and discrimination. Living at a time when the value of works of art in the market was one of taste and appreciation rather than of mere commerce, he was able to avail himself of an ample fortune to buy the finest specimens of the Fine Arts which came into the market.</blockquote>He also planted beeches, firs, and larches on the Northwick estate, and created ornamental cascades along the brook which flowed through his woodlands.<br>
<br>Northwick was a catholic collector, and bought actively at auctions for over half a century. He acquired pictures of all schools, especially Italian pictures from all periods, Flemish pictures, and contemporary British paintings. His pioneering interest was in Italian pictures of the fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries. So extensive did his collection become that he built a special picture gallery at Northwick Park in 1832, and some years later acquired Thirlestane House in Cheltenham, the guide to which in 1846 listed over 500 pictures. By 1859 the collection exceeded 1400 pictures; sculpture, bronzes, antique gems and cameos, enamels, coins, carvings, miniatures, and manuscripts also formed part of the collection. Of liberal disposition, he opened Thirlestane House to the public and it became one of the greatest attractions of Cheltenham. Northwick was an initial subscriber to the British Institution, founded in 1805; a member of the Society of Dilettanti; and a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries.<br>
<br>Northwick died, unmarried and intestate, at Northwick Park on 20 January 1859. He was succeeded as third Baron Northwick by his nephew, George Rushout-Bowles MP. As his property had to be divided equally among his nearest kin, it was necessary for Thirlestane House and the famous collections to be sold. The auction was conducted by Harry Phillips, auctioneer of New Bond Street, London, in July and August 1859 and raised some &pound;95,000 in eighteen days: four pictures were bought by the National Gallery, and others by collectors of the calibre of William Douglas, eleventh duke of Hamilton, Walter Scott, fifth duke of Buccleuch, the fourth marquess of Hertford, and Baron James de Rothschild. However, a considerable part of the collections was bought by George, third Baron Northwick, and was taken to Northwick Park.<br>
