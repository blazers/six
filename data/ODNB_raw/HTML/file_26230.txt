<span class="headword">Standish,  Frank Hall</span>  (1799&#150;1840), <span class="occ">art collector and author</span>, born at Blackwell, Darlington, co. Durham, on 2 October 1799, was the only child of Anthony Hall (<i>b</i>. 1776) of Flass, Durham, and his wife, Charlotte Rey. A distant cousin of Sir Frank Standish of Duxbury Hall, Chorley, Lancashire, he succeeded to the estates (but not the baronetcy) in 1812, adding the Standish name and arms to his own. The estate was the centre of a violent rival claim by a local weaver, Thomas Standish, who barricaded himself in for several months. In 1817 Standish was admitted to St John's College, Cambridge, but never took his degree. He spent his early twenties travelling the continent, living initially in France but from 1830 settling in Seville, Spain, where he acted as host to British and French travellers and artists, including Richard Ford and Benjamin Disraeli. In Seville, Standish acquired works of Spanish art and literature&#151;especially paintings and drawings by Murillo and other seventeenth-century artists&#151;so avidly that at his death he left &pound;60,000 in debts. He also commissioned architectural views from David Roberts, including for instance <span class="italic">Interior of Seville Cathedral: High Altar</span> (Downside School, Somerset). He wrote a biography of Voltaire (1821), some poetry, and several travel books, including <span class="italic">Seville and its Vicinity</span> (1840) with an engraved portrait of Standish by E. Davenport, after a drawing by G. Alessandri, as a frontispiece. The last publication, though rambling, is informative on the collections of other British and Spanish residents from whom Standish bought many of his own works, including the British vice-consul in Seville, Julian Williams.<br>
<br>Standish died unmarried at Cadiz on 21 December 1840, having sent most of his art collection and library to Duxbury Hall (dem.). He was buried in the Standish crypt at St Laurence's, Chorley, on 21 January 1841. A wall monument in the chancel, by F. Webster of Kendal, recites his claim to the baronetcy and his fame as a collector. Standish bequeathed his entire collection for the use of King Louis Philippe, ostensibly out of respect to the French nation, but supposedly also to spite the British government for refusing to revive the Standish baronetcy. In May 1841 Baron Isidore Taylor (1789&#150;1879), whom Standish knew in Seville, visited Duxbury to make the selection for the king, leaving Murillo's <span class="italic">Ecce homo</span> (formerly Cook Collection, Richmond, Surrey) and some replacement copies for Standish's heirs. The house contents were sold on 2 June 1881. A full-length portrait copied by J.-B. Mauzaisse after the Seville painter Jos&eacute; Guti&eacute;rrez de la Vega (1791&#150;1865), showing Standish against the Seville skyline, hangs at Astley Hall Museum, Chorley.<br>
<br>The French king deposited 244 paintings in the &#145;Mus&eacute;e Standish&#146; alongside his &#145;Galerie Espagnole&#146; in the Louvre. It had a mixed press: <span class="italic">Le Charivari</span> (16 April 1841) satirized it (as full of English novels and portraits of Standish), while Thor&eacute; reviewed it favourably, especially four paintings by Murillo, including <span class="italic">Christ after the Flagellation</span> (Urbana, Ohio), and the rare collection of Murillo drawings, which Standish himself particularly admired. The collection's display in Paris impressed others, including the artist Millet. The books and 269 drawings were sold in Paris in December 1852, including an outstanding set of thirteen Murillo drawings (Louvre) and a study (Mus&eacute;e Bonnat, Bayonne) for the painting in Sheffield's Graves Art Gallery. The paintings were sent to England and sold at Christies on 28 and 30 May 1853. The fourth marquess of Hertford paid the highest sum (against bidding from the National Gallery, London), giving &pound;1680 for Vel&aacute;zquez's <span class="italic">Don Baltasar Carlos</span> (Wallace Collection, London). He also acquired one of the few French paintings, Lancret's <span class="italic">Italian Comedians by a Fountain</span>. Other Standish paintings can be found in the national galleries of Dublin, Stockholm, and Washington: Morales's <span class="italic">St Jerome</span>, Murillo's <span class="italic">Double Trinity</span>, and, from Zurbar&aacute;n's studio, <span class="italic">Sts Paula, Eustachia, and Jerome</span>. The Royal Collection holds Zurbar&aacute;n's <span class="italic">St Ignatius Loyola</span> (Hampton Court, London); while Antonio de Pereda's <span class="italic">Kitchen Scene</span> and a portrait attributed to Alonso Cano are at Penrhyn Castle, Anglesey. Another work by Cano, <span class="italic">Adam and Eve</span>, is at Pollok House, Glasgow, as are Herrera the younger's <span class="italic">Adoration of the Blessed Sacrament</span> and Morales's <span class="italic">Virgin Holding Christ's Head</span>. The London sale of Standish's collection increased the popular British fascination with Spanish culture already sparked by the publications of Richard Ford and Stirling Maxwell.<br>
