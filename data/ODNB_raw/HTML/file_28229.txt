<span class="headword">Verney, Sir  Edmund</span>  (1616&#150;1649), <span class="occ">royalist army officer</span>, was the third son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28228/', "Sir Edmund Verney (1590&#150;1642)")</script> and his wife, Margaret Denton (1594&#150;1641). <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28233/', "Sir Ralph Verney (1613&#150;1696)")</script> was his eldest brother; his younger brother Henry was a royalist colonel. Edmund was educated at a private school in Gloucester, at Winchester College (1634&#150;5), and then at Magdalen Hall, Oxford, where he matriculated on 22 January 1636. At Oxford he learned little and got into debt and into disgrace with his puritan tutor, Henry Wilkinson. In 1637 he went briefly to study under Mr Crowther, rector of Newton Blossomville, Buckinghamshire, formerly his eldest brother's Oxford tutor, who found that he &#145;understands not the very first grounds of logicke, or other university learning&#146; but that he was willing and capable  (F. P. Verney and M. M. Verney, 1.164).<br>
<br>Verney entered the army against the Scots as a volunteer in 1639 and joined his father in the royal army on the border. With the first money that he earned he paid off his Oxford creditors and, when the first bishops' war was over, he joined the army of the United Provinces in Flanders in Sir Thomas Culpepper's regiment. In winter quarters at Utrecht he studied Latin, French, and history seven or eight hours a day at the university. He had many disappointments about promotion, though Elizabeth, queen of Bohemia, did her best to help him. In 1640 he served again in the English army in the second bishops' war.<br>
<br>Verney sided with the king in the civil war, and suffered heavily for his loyalty; his pay as well as that of his men was constantly in arrears; the grief of his father's death at Edgehill was embittered by the sorrow and indignation he felt that his eldest brother, Ralph, should support the parliament; his portion invested in the aulnage, the family cloth inspection venture, was practically forfeited; and he suffered most of all from the mistakes he witnessed daily in the conduct of his own leaders.<br>
<br>Verney the professional soldier found service as an officer in Harcourt's regiment in the army sent from England to suppress the Irish rising in late 1641 and early 1642. In 1642&#150;3 he served under the earl of Ormond in the savage wars against the confederates. &#145;The enemy runs from us wheresoever we meet them&#146;, he wrote, &#145;but if we chance to overtake them, we give no quarter, but all to the sword&#146;. He sent the same report after the taking of Trim: &#145;after we put some four score men to the sword, but like valiant knights errant, gave quarter and liberty to all the women&#146;  (F. P. Verney and M. M. Verney, 2.135). He saw much action in Ireland, commanded at Rathcotty Castle, and was wounded at Rathconnel.<br>
<br>In November 1643 Verney returned from Ireland as a major of foot in Richard Gibson's regiment of foot, part of the army released for service in England by the cessation. He became a colonel in August 1644. He was knighted in 1643, and made lieutenant-governor of Chester; he served during its two sieges, and was highly valued by Lord Byron and other commanders. After the surrender of Chester in 1646 Sir Edmund rejoined Ormond, to whom he had a personal loyalty, at Le Havre. Their portraits were painted in Paris by Egmont in 1648, as companion pictures. They returned to Ireland to take part in the last fierce struggle against Cromwell. Sir Edmund had been previously reconciled with his by now exiled brother. In the absence of a widow Ralph was to be the administrator of his dead younger brother's estate.<br>
<br>Ormond committed the command of his own regiment to his friend Verney, when he sent the best of his army with Sir Arthur Aston to reinforce the defenders of Drogheda. Sir Edmund wrote from the city (9 September 1649) earnestly begging Ormond to fall on the enemy's camp to make a diversion. He survived the horrors of the assault on 11 September, but the few who had escaped were sought out and killed in cold blood. Among these was Verney, killed three days after the fall of the town, while he was &#145;walkinge with Crumwell by way of protection&#146;. &#145;One Ropier who is brother to the Lord Ropier, caled him aside in a pretence to speake with him, being formerly of acquaintance, and insteade of some frendly office wch Sir Ed: might expect from him, he barberously rann him throw wth a tuck&#146;  (F. P. Verney and M. M. Verney, 2.344&#150;5).<br>
