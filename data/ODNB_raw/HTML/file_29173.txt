<span class="headword">Wharton,  Thomas</span>, second Baron Wharton  (1520&#150;1572), <span class="occ">soldier and administrator</span>, was probably born at Kirkby Stephen, Westmorland, the elder of the two sons of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29172/', "Thomas Wharton, first Baron Wharton (c.1495&#150;1568)")</script>, soldier and administrator, and his first wife, Eleanor (<i>d</i>. in or after 1547), third daughter of Sir Brian Stapleton of Wighill, Yorkshire, and his wife, Joan. Like his father, Wharton followed a military and administrative career on the Scottish marches. On 17 October 1536 he was captured during the Pilgrimage of Grace by the rebels who had gone to Kirkby Stephen in search of his father. Evidently, however, he did not suffer at their hands or by any association with them. By 8 November 1542 he had entered the service of the master of the horse, Sir Anthony Browne. Over the following three years Wharton carved out a reputation serving in Browne's company during the Scottish wars. He was probably present at the battle of Solway Moss on 24 November 1542, and was prominent in border raids and served his father, who was either deputy warden or warden of the west, middle, or east marches for most of the period 1537 to 1557. Having taken part in the successful expedition into Scotland between 8 and 23 September 1545 of Edward Seymour, earl of Hertford, Wharton was knighted by him on 23 September at Norham Castle, Northumberland.<br>
<br>During Edward VI's reign Wharton's administrative duties also burgeoned. He was appointed JP for Cumberland, Westmorland, and the West Riding of Yorkshire from 26 May 1547 (added to the quorum for Cumberland and Westmorland in 1554); pricked sheriff of Cumberland in November; and was returned as MP for Cumberland in November (having already sat in parliament in 1544 and possibly 1542). His role as an MP saw him acting as a link between the privy council and the administration on the marches. Throughout the late 1540s Wharton also continued his military exploits: in mid-March 1548, for instance, he raided into Annandale and Nithsdale. In May 1547 he married Anne (<i>d</i>. 1561), daughter of Robert Radcliffe, first earl of Sussex, and his second wife, Margaret. The couple had two sons, including Philip Wharton, third Baron Wharton (1555&#150;1625), and two daughters.<br>
<br>Mary I's accession in July 1553 brought a rapid rise in Wharton's fortunes. He declared for her on 12 July, among the first to do so, and attended upon her at Kenninghall, Norfolk, and Framlingham, Suffolk. It is possible that he was already a member of her household. His continued attachment to Mary was partly religious (he remained a committed Catholic) and partly due to his marital connection: his brother-in-law, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22981/', "Henry Radcliffe, second earl of Sussex (c.1507&#150;1557)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22991/', "Radcliffe, Robert, first earl of Sussex (1482/&#150;1542)")</script>], magnate, was one of the queen's strongest supporters. Wharton was made a privy councillor on or before 21 August and a member of the queen's council of the north in September. He attended the privy council regularly. He also received lands and offices in Yorkshire, including the position of chief steward of the East Riding and steward of Beverley from 20 October. He was appointed master of the queen's henchmen on 26 October. Wharton sat in the parliaments of October 1553 (Cumberland), April (Hedon) and November (Yorkshire) 1554, 1555 (Northumberland), and 1558 (Northumberland or Yorkshire). On 20 July 1554 he was present at Southampton when Philip of Spain was invested with the Order of the Garter and the king acted as godfather to Wharton's son the following year. He was described by a Spanish envoy as &#145;a good man, harmless; he is retiring&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP Spain</span>, <i>July 1554 &#150; November 1558</i>, 374, 455).<br>
<br>The renewal of war with Scotland in 1557 saw Wharton again serving on the borders. In July he took command of 1000 men for the defence of the east and middle marches and was with Thomas Percy, seventh earl of Northumberland, at Berwick in August. He continued to receive lands in the north from Mary, probably to bolster his military resources and to prepare him to succeed to his father's offices, and remained a key figure in the Marian administration, acting as witness to the queen's will on 30 March 1558 and serving at her funeral on 14 December.<br>
<br>Under Elizabeth I, however, his religious sensibilities meant that Wharton soon fell from favour. He was not appointed to her privy council and was removed as master of the henchmen. He was, however, reappointed to the council of the north in December 1558. It is probable that Wharton was less interested in northern society than his father and may even have tried to concentrate his estates in the south. He sold his stewardship of Beverley in 1561. On 3 June 1561, with his wife and other leading former Marians, he was indicted for hearing mass. Found guilty, Wharton and his wife were committed to the Tower of London. He submitted on 16 July and was pardoned but continued to be, in the words of John Best, bishop of Carlisle, &#145;evil of religion&#146;  (HoP, <span class="italic">Commons, 1509&#150;58</span>, 3.601). During the northern rising of 1569 Wharton did nothing to check the rebels' progress but was probably saved from suffering their fate when he fell from his horse in early December, an accident that almost claimed his life. Having succeeded his father on 23 or 24 August 1568, Wharton, once recovered from his riding accident, took his seat in the House of Lords on 2 April 1571. He died intestate on 14 June 1572 at his house on Cannon Row, Westminster. The administration of his estate was given to his son and heir, Philip Wharton, on 28 February 1579. He was buried in Westminster Abbey.<br>
