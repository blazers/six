<span class="headword">Martyn,  Edward Joseph</span>  (1859&#150;1923), <span class="occ">playwright and politician</span>, was born on 30 January 1859 in Tillyra Castle, Ardrahan, co. Galway, the son of John Martyn (<i>d</i>. 1860) and Annie May Josephine Martyn, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Smyth (1830&#150;1898). His father's family traced its descent from the crusader Sir Oliver Martin, who came to Ireland with Strongbow in 1170, and the Martyns, although Catholic, were loyal enough to retain their estates in penal law times through a special act of parliament. Martyn had no recollection of his father, who died shortly after he was born, and his devout and austere mother, the daughter of an upwardly mobile Galway land speculator, continued to exert a dominant influence over him until her death. A younger brother died in early manhood, shortly after taking a commission in the British army.<br>
<br>After some years at Belvedere College in Dublin, Martyn's mother moved him to another Jesuit school, Beaumont College in England. The intellectual curriculum did not suit him, and an unsuccessful attempt to blow up the school nearly led to his expulsion. His feeling of isolation was intensified at Christ Church, Oxford, where he matriculated in May 1877, partly because he found few fellow Catholic undergraduates, but largely because his ignorance of Latin and Greek made his time there a humiliation. By way of compensation, he threw himself into the aesthetic movement, and travelled much in the vacations, developing a lifelong love for Wagner, Ibsen, Greece, and architecture.<br>
<br>Leaving Oxford after two years, and without a degree, Martyn kept rooms in London, but returned frequently to Galway where he extensively rebuilt Tillyra Castle. Agrarian agitation was at its height (there was a subsequent attempt to assassinate his agent), and he was noted for his uncompromising position as a magistrate, a stance reinforced by lifelong disdain for the people. He rebuffed his mother's attempts at matchmaking, and remained unmarried and a lifelong misogynist. His emotional energy went rather into religion, and he became an unusually devout Catholic, destroying a long poem because of its supposed pagan tendency. There was little to indicate the future president of Sinn F&eacute;in, yet he soon became vehemently pro-nationalist and anti-English. His cousin the novelist George Moore thought this a return to his genuine beliefs after the death of his mother in May 1898, while he himself ascribed his conversion to his reading Lecky's <span class="italic">History of Ireland in the Eighteenth Century</span>. His first published work, <span class="italic">Morgante the Lesser</span> (1890), a prose satire influenced by Swift and Rabelais, contrasts a hellish vision of the modern world with the utopian Agathopolis, a womanless state, classical in art, Catholic in religion, and enlightenedly despotic in politics. Perhaps in an attempt to create something of this in Ireland, he began to support a wide variety of cultural organizations. He became a prominent member of the ruling council of the Gaelic League, and was particularly eager to re-Gaelicize the upper and middle classes, a policy he urged in his pamphlet <span class="italic">Ireland's Battle for her Language</span> (1900). He also sat on the Irish committee of the Pan Celtic Association from 1898, and helped to plan its first congress in Dublin in 1900. At the same time Martyn was elected a vice-president of the Feis Ceoil, a cultural and musical organization, which he supported not only financially but also practically, by acting as a judge at its competitions. This taste for Irish music was predated by his interest in Wagner and church music. He made the pilgrimage to Bayreuth, and founded the Dublin Palestrina Choir in 1899, subsequently expending a great deal of time and money in persuading the Catholic hierarchy to merge this into the Cathedral Choir of Dublin, an ambition he achieved in 1903 at a personal cost of &pound;10,000. These initiatives were part of a more general campaign to improve Irish ecclesiastical art. He induced the department of technical instruction to establish classes in stained glass at the Dublin Metropolitan School of Art, and helped finance Sarah Purser's stained-glass co-operative, An T&uacute;r Gloine (Tower of Glass), which opened in Dublin in 1903 and from which he commissioned windows for his local church. He also advised the bishop of Clonfert on the use of Irish artists in decorating a new cathedral at Loughrea.<br>
<br>Martyn had met W. B. Yeats in London in 1896 through Arthur Symons, and the two stayed with him for the first time that summer at Tillyra. By this time he had already written an Ibsenite play, <span class="italic">The Heather Field</span>, with George Moore's help, and was completing a more symbolical piece, <span class="italic">Maeve</span>, which he paid Arthur Symons to revise. Unsuccessful in getting either play produced commercially, in June 1897 he resolved, with Yeats and Lady Gregory, to establish an Irish Literary Theatre in Dublin. Martyn agreed to underwrite any financial loss, recruited potential subscribers, helped to find a venue for the first productions, and successfully lobbied Irish MPs to change the laws governing theatrical performances in Dublin.<br>
<br>Although they met frequently in Galway, Dublin, and London from 1896 to 1900, Martyn was always suspicious of Yeats's unorthodox religious beliefs, and shortly before the first season of the new society threatened to abort the whole project by withdrawing his financial guarantees because he objected to several passages in Yeats's <span class="italic">Countess Cathleen</span> on theological grounds. Yeats enlisted influential Catholic churchmen to counter these suspicions; the performances went forward, and the enthusiastic reception of <span class="italic">The Heather Field</span> gave Martyn the greatest triumph he was to know in the theatre. Even international success seemed to beckon when the play was staged in New York. <span class="italic">Maeve</span> was also well received at the second Irish Literary Theatre season in February 1900, and Martyn had begun work on a third play, a satire on Anglo-Irish relations entitled <span class="italic">The Tale of a Town</span>. He had received considerable help with the writing of his previous plays, and George Moore and Yeats with singular lack of tact now began a radical revision of this one under the title <span class="italic">The Bending of the Bough</span>. Mortified, Martyn repudiated the new version and began to reconsider his position in the Irish Literary Theatre.<br>
<br>Meanwhile, Martyn had openly declared his nationalism. At a Christmas celebration at Tillyra in 1899 he refused to allow a band to play &#145;God Save the Queen&#146;, and when Lord Clonbrock suggested that he had compromised his position as deputy lord lieutenant and commissioner of the peace for co. Galway, he promptly resigned these offices, explaining that he no longer shared the views of the Unionist Party in which he had been brought up. The cool response to the publication of his plays <span class="italic">The Tale of a Town</span> and <span class="italic">An Enchanted Sea</span> disappointed him, while Yeats's alliance with the Fay brothers of the Irish National Dramatic Society indicated that the direction of the theatrical movement would be toward poetic and folk drama, rather than the psychological, Ibsenite plays he preferred. Early in 1902 he let it be known that he was withdrawing from what remained of the Irish Literary Theatre, and turned his attention to the Players' Club, a semi-professional company which produced <span class="italic">The Heather Field</span> in June 1903, and his homo-erotic four-act tragedy <span class="italic">An Enchanted Sea</span> in April 1904. Although Moore thought it was the play which most fully expressed Martyn's essential paganism, Dublin critics found it monotonous and far-fetched.<br>
<br>In May 1903 Martyn, Maud Gonne, and Arthur Griffith founded the National Council, the immediate purpose of which was to oppose an impending royal visit to Dublin, but which outlasted this occasion, and in September 1908 became one of the planks in the Sinn F&eacute;in movement. By that time Martyn had been elected president of Sinn F&eacute;in at its first annual convention in November 1905. His political affiliations had already led to his resignation as the president of the Catholic Association, and, as a consequence of a speech made to the National Council, he was expelled from the Kildare Street Club, a bastion of ascendancy values. To general astonishment, he took an action disputing its right to do this, won his case, and defiantly remained a member of the club until his death. His presidency of Sinn F&eacute;in was far shorter: in July 1908 he told Yeats that he had &#145;left the Sinn Fein organization and retired from politics altogether&#146;. Yeats suspected that the organization had made inordinate demands on his pocket, but reported that he was &#145;busy writing as ever, is very amiable&#146;  (W. B. Yeats to J. B. Yeats, 17 July 1908).<br>
<br>Martyn's interest in the theatre continued: he was a regular patron of the Abbey Theatre, as well as serving simultaneously on the committees of several drama societies. In October 1905 the National Players' Society, of which he was a vice-president, produced <span class="italic">The Tale of a Town</span>, and when in 1906 actors seceding from the Abbey set up the Theatre of Ireland, Martyn agreed to become its president. In May 1908 it revived <span class="italic">Maeve</span> to a hostile reception, while the return of <span class="italic">The Heather Field</span> to the Abbey stage in April 1909 aroused little interest. In January 1912 Count Markiewicz's Independent Dramatic Company produced his domestic melodrama <span class="italic">Grangecolman</span> to mixed reviews, and he despaired of finding an Irish theatre group that could give him the theatre he wanted. Nevertheless, when the poets Thomas MacDonagh and Joseph Plunkett proposed a new company, the Irish Theatre, he jumped at the chance of becoming one of the three directors.<br>
<br>The company's first production, in 1914, was Martyn's heavy-handed comedy <span class="italic">The Dream Physician</span>, in which the absurd George Augustus Moon was his revenge for George Moore's ridicule of him in <span class="italic">Hail and Farewell</span>. The following year the company revived the play in its new Hardwicke Street venue, and in November 1915 premi&egrave;red his three-act play <span class="italic">The Privilege of Place</span>. The Irish Theatre was severely afflicted by the Easter rising in 1916, but, despite the execution of Martyn's fellow directors Plunkett and MacDonagh, it reopened in November with a revival of <span class="italic">The Heather Field</span>, followed in December by the production of Martyn's &#145;symbolist extravaganza&#146; <span class="italic">Romulus and Remus</span>. This clumsy satire on Moore, Yeats, and Lady Gregory, first published in the <span class="italic">Irish People</span> in 1907, transposes the quarrels in the Irish Literary Theatre to a hairdresser's salon. In 1917 <span class="italic">Grangecolman</span> was revived in Hardwicke Street, and Martyn offered a &pound;10 prize for the best psychological play of Irish life. But his hopes of creating a new national theatre were fading, and the company limped on in its cramped theatre, playing to tiny audiences. <span class="italic">The Heather Field</span> was revived in April 1918, and in April 1919 Martyn presented his wordy new &#145;drama in elective moods&#146;, <span class="italic">Regina Eyre</span>. The reviewers panned it, as they did a lugubrious production of Chekhov in June 1919, and the Irish Theatre came to an end early in 1920. The resignation of the main director, the deteriorating political situation, the frequent curfews, and the refusal of Joseph Plunkett's mother to continue the lease on Hardwicke Street all contributed to its demise.<br>
<br>The breakdown of law and order during the Irish War of Independence revived all Martyn's old mistrust of the people, and he tried to sell Tillyra, but could not find a buyer. He began to regret his early support for Sinn F&eacute;in, although this did not save him from the attentions of the crown forces; his rooms in Dublin were raided by the military, and the fine village hall he had built at Ardrahan was burnt by the Black and Tans. In autumn 1922 Martyn suffered a stroke, and was almost entirely incapacitated. He supported Griffith and the signing of the Anglo-Irish treaty, but, although there was republican activity in his area, Tillyra escaped burning. Martyn was operated on for a brain tumour, and died a few days later at Tillyra Castle on 5 December 1923. In his will he left his body to be dissected, and his library to the Discalced Carmelites in Clarendon Street, Dublin.<br>
