<span class="headword">Pierrepont,  William</span>  (1607/8&#150;1678), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was the second son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22230/', "Robert Pierrepont, first earl of Kingston upon Hull (1584&#150;1643)")</script>, of Holme Pierrepont, Nottinghamshire, and his wife, Gertrude (1587/8&#150;1649), daughter and coheir of Henry Talbot, a younger son of George Talbot, sixth earl of Shrewsbury. His brothers were <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22229/', "Henry Pierrepont, first marquess of Dorchester")</script>, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/94585/', "Francis Pierrepoint")</script>, politician.<h2>
<a name="Earlycareer"></a>Early career</h2>Pierrepont attended Emmanuel College, Cambridge, from 1624, and Lincoln's Inn from 1627. At an unknown date he married Elizabeth, daughter and coheir of Sir Thomas Harris of Tong Castle, Shropshire; they had ten children. He was normally resident at the Thoresby estate in Sherwood, Nottinghamshire, settled on him by his father in 1633, and he maintained an aristocratic lifestyle. He also had lands in Lincolnshire, and in Huntingdonshire through his mother, and his marriage gave him interests in Shropshire. In 1637 he was made sheriff there, at a time of rising discontent with the imposition of ship money. In 1638 he had to apologize to the privy council for the delay in collecting Shropshire's quota. His attempts to revise the assessments had little effect, and he concluded that the resistance was endemic: &#145;Many complain of unequal assessing, but most do it only to delay. Very many refuse to pay&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1637&#150;8</i>, 42). He was elected MP for Shropshire in the Short Parliament of March 1640, in a contest following the breakdown of an electoral pact with future royalists in the county. He lost his county seat for the Long Parliament of October 1640, but was returned for Much Wenlock instead, and presented Shropshire's petition of grievances to the Commons.<h2>
<a name="TheLongParliament"></a>The Long Parliament</h2>Pierrepont established an unrivalled reputation for statesmanship in the momentous politics of the Long Parliament, with the sobriquet of Wise William among his contemporaries. He was immediately at the forefront of the opposition to the policies of the 1630s. In the debate over ship money in December 1640 he denounced the judges who had denied parliament's right to make the tax illegal. He then chaired the committee for the impeachment of Sir Robert Berkeley, the judge who had defended ship money most vociferously. Pierrepont's major speech against ship money has survived and illustrates his political beliefs. Objecting to it as an unparliamentary tax he said that the &#145;unlimited power&#146; to make binding law and raise taxation could only be exercised through consent in parliament: &#145;and so long as we are often reduced to this main foundation our King and we shall prosper&#146;  (Rushworth, 4.326). Pierrepont was active in promoting initiatives to give parliament a new degree of independent authority. Lucy Hutchinson noted that he introduced and &#145;carried on the bill for the continuation of the present parliament&#146;  (Hutchinson, 118). This was a reference to the act, rushed through in May 1641 in the wake of the first army plot, that laid down that the Long Parliament could not be dissolved without its own assent.<br>
<br>Pierrepont came to real prominence through his part in parliament's assumption of military authority in 1642. From early January he was the Commons' principal envoy in persuading a hesitant House of Lords that the lieutenant of the Tower should be replaced by parliament's own nominee, and that the conditions of tenure should be defined by parliament. Pierrepont was then chosen on 14 January to chair the vital committee to settle the militia. He managed it with skill and vigour, taking soundings among MPs to identify the loyal peers on whom parliament could rely. Within four days the committee produced the framework of the radical militia ordinance, by which the lords lieutenant were to be appointed simply by order of parliament. Many believed that this step made civil war inevitable. Pierrepont continued to oversee the organization of the militia and fortresses for parliament as the two sides slid towards open conflict. In the debate on the king's response to the nineteen propositions at the end of June he was offended by Charles's contemptuous rejection of parliament's demand for a voice in the appointment of ministers.<h2>
<a name="Civilwar"></a>Civil war</h2>On 4 July 1642 Pierrepont was one of ten MPs named to form the committee of safety, in effect a government for the parliamentarian cause. In the winter of 1643, when the military situation was most critical, he seems briefly to have turned towards the peace party. But in general he was associated with a &#145;middle group&#146; of MPs who, while not favouring extreme puritan or republican views, were still determined to prosecute the war vigorously and impose a settlement with permanent restraints on the royal government. Pierrepont's diplomatic and debating skills gave him an important role in peace negotiations. He was among the first group of parliamentary commissioners in October 1642, and took part in the talks at Oxford in March 1643, where: &#145;he acted his part with great foresight and prudence and was exceeding courteous to his fellow commissioners&#146;  (Whitelocke, 69). He put forward a compromise to resolve the impasse at the talks, suggesting that if the king would agree to parliament's retaining control of the militia, the other central demand for the abolition of episcopacy might be shelved. The royalist commissioners approved the deal, but Charles refused.<br>
<br>Pierrepont's concession to episcopacy suited his own religious preference, which was for a moderated form of the existing system, shorn of the power to interfere in secular affairs as the Laudians had done in the 1630s. In November 1643 Pierrepont objected to the solemn league and covenant with the Scots, because it implied a presbyterian system with even greater clerical powers. On 7 November he asked leave from the house to consider his position, but was persuaded to set aside his scruples: &#145;they were so desirous of his assistance, being a gentleman of wisdom and integrity, that they gave him a friendly denial&#146;  (Whitelocke, 77). He was appointed to the committee of both kingdoms in February 1644. But the Scottish alliance had a destabilizing effect in parliament, and by the end of 1644 Pierrepont and the middle group were making common cause with the Independent generals to oppose Scottish and presbyterian plans for an intolerant theocratic church and a settlement without political limits on the king. At the Uxbridge talks in January 1645, Clarendon recalled, Pierrepont &#145;seemed to have contracted more bitterness and sourness than formerly &hellip; and insisted that the king yield to whatsoever was demanded&#146;  (Clarendon, <span class="italic">Hist. rebellion</span>, 3.497). Pierrepont now had less leeway to vary the proposals on religion and together with other leading parliamentarian commissioners he continued to press the king to agree to parliamentary control of the militia. Charles's refusal again ended the prospects for a treaty. Pierrepont was prominent in advancing the military reorganization which was to bring the war to a close in 1646. He promoted the self-denying ordinance which aimed to remove the peace party lords Essex and Manchester from their commands, and he carried the ordinance up to a reluctant House of Lords.<h2>
<a name="PierrepontandCromwell"></a>Pierrepont and Cromwell</h2>The end of the war did not bring a settlement, and in May 1646 Pierrepont had to inform parliament that Charles had taken refuge with the Scots. In October parliament enlisted Pierrepont's pen for a pamphlet denying that the Scots had the right to assume a joint interest in negotiations with the king. Throughout 1647 Pierrepont and the middle group supported the Independents in resisting Scottish and presbyterian demands for disbanding the army. On 4 August Pierrepont was among fifty-seven MPs who signed an engagement to stand by Fairfax and the army, and he was noted as a member of a powerful cabal which included Cromwell, Henry Ireton, and Henry Vane. He joined the generals in their attempt to persuade Charles to accept <span class="italic">The Heads of Proposals</span>, the terms of which reflected Pierrepont's own priorities of guaranteed parliaments, control of the militia, and episcopacy without coercive powers. After Charles had rejected this and parliament's own rather stricter four bills and confirmed his preference for the Scots, Pierrepont spoke in favour of the vote of no addresses in January 1648.<br>
<br>Unlike the generals, however, Pierrepont could not really abandon the search for a settlement, and he was soon involved in middle-group plans for new overtures to the king. On 28 April 1648 he voted with the majority in parliament against altering &#145;the fundamental government of the Kingdom by King, Lords and Commons&#146;, but he had not forsaken parliament's radical aims. The treaty which he and the middle group proposed at Newport stood firm on the essential demand for parliamentary supervision over ministers and militia, and in early October Charles pretended to consent. Pierrepont then resumed his attempt to reach a compromise with the king over episcopacy, staying on at Newport until the eleventh hour trying to persuade Charles to accept a church settlement which retained some elements of the old establishment. Cromwell gently reproved him as &#145;my wise friend, who thinks that enthroning the King with presbytery brings spiritual slavery, but with a moderate episcopacy works a good peace&#146;  (<span class="italic">Writings and Speeches</span>, 1.677).<br>
<br>Pierrepont was not among the MPs excluded at Pride's Purge on 6 December 1648, but he greatly disapproved of this invasion of parliamentary liberties, and chaired a committee to negotiate for the release of the arrested MPs. Thereafter he absented himself from the house, and &#145;expressed much dissatisfaction&#146; at the proceedings of the army and at those MPs who continued to sit  (Whitelocke, 362). He was finally excluded by the Rump Parliament in January 1651. He was returned to Cromwell's second parliament as the member for Nottinghamshire, but did not take his seat. Nor did he sit on the council of state, or in the new protectoral other house as Cromwell wished. But he remained among the protector's intimate associates, sharing his leisure activities, including the making of verses, and making his political expertise available to Cromwell on an informal but regular basis. Pierrepont was one of a handful of trusted advisers whose &#145;counsel was accepted and followed by him in most of his greatest affairs&#146;  (Whitelocke, 656). He was probably instrumental in persuading Cromwell to phase out the decimation tax, and he advised him to accept the crown in 1657. One particular shared objective was the resettlement of Ireland under English rule, which Pierrepont had strongly endorsed in a treatise.<br>
<br>Pierrepont gave even closer support to Cromwell's son Richard. Although he still had no formal office, Pierrepont was part of a triumvirate, with Oliver St John and John Thurloe, which managed the government during Richard Cromwell's brief reign. Pierrepont was said to be attempting to reconcile political divisions, and he proposed a scheme to resolve the problem of debt and reduce the burden of the army. Some thought that he found Richard easier to deal with personally than his unpredictable father, but it was principally Richard's independence from the army that made Pierrepont hopeful of &#145;bringing the nation into freedom under that young man&#146;  (Hutchinson, 377&#150;8). John Hutchinson feared that if the army and republicanism were rejected the Stuarts would return, but Pierrepont assured him that the nation valued its liberty too much to recall them.<br>
<br>When that confidence proved misplaced and a restoration threatened, Pierrepont retired into the background. But at the end of February 1660, with the return of the excluded MPs to the Commons and his own election at the top of the list for the new council of state, he saw another opportunity to influence affairs. He did everything he could to resist or restrict the restored monarchy. Clarendon regretted that he had &#145;never shown the least inclination&#146; to the king's cause. Other royalists feared that he was trying to engineer the return of Richard Cromwell, or &#145;any single person save the Stuart line&#146;. He was said to be &#145;impertinently violent&#146; against the king and conspiring with other parliamentarian leaders to ensure that Charles II would be held to the terms of the treaty of Newport, and &#145;be so fettered as he should not write a letter but they must know of it&#146;  (Scrope and Monkhouse, 3.686, 693, 701, 705). For a while it seemed that the parliamentarians might be able to impose such a settlement, but they were foiled when General Monck declared for a new and inevitably less radical parliament. It was then said that Pierrepont was trying to persuade Monck himself to accept the sovereignty.<h2>
<a name="Restorationandlastyears"></a>Restoration and last years</h2>Pierrepont was elected to the Convention Parliament for Nottinghamshire and remained active in suggesting reforms as the Restoration took shape. He persuaded the Commons to offer the king a settled revenue to compensate for the abolition of feudal dues, and to raise the money not by a land tax but by a liquor excise, an important precedent. He also continued to defend parliamentarian aims, leading the initially successful opposition to the <span class="roman">Militia Bill</span> because it threatened to take control out of the hands of the local gentry. He also interceded for some of the republicans, gaining a degree of leniency for Hutchinson and Vane. Pierrepont himself was probably saved from retribution by Lucy Hutchinson's steadfast refusal to inform about his persistent championing of Richard Cromwell.<br>
<br>Pierrepont was defeated in the Nottinghamshire election for the Cavalier Parliament in 1661, and again retired from politics. He did, however, take part in December 1667 in what was described as the one great success of &#145;those who opposed the Court&#146;. He sat on the Brook House committee to &#145;examine the accounts of the money that was given in the Dutch war&#146;, an exercise which would in future limit the crown's discretion in foreign policy  (<span class="italic">Bishop Burnet's History</span>, ed. Burnet and Burnet, 1.267). Pierrepont's final contribution to public affairs was a treatise written in the early 1670s opposing suggestions of a systematic register of &#145;Estates, Land and Bills&#146;; he thought that this would be too rigid and invasive  (<span class="italic">Harleian Miscellany</span>, 3.320). He died in the summer of 1678, and asked to be buried &#145;without pomp&#146; at the family's ancestral base of Holme Pierrepont. His will, of which his wife was named an executor, simply confirms his great wealth, with landholdings in five counties. His three grandsons Robert, William, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22227/', "Evelyn Pierrepont")</script> succeeded in turn to the earldom of Kingston after the death of his brother Henry in 1680. In 1715 Evelyn was made the first duke of Kingston upon Hull.<br>
