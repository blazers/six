<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Fleming,  Robert</span>  (1845&#150;1933), <span class="occ">financier</span>, was born on 17 March 1845 at Liff Road, Lochee, then a village about 3 miles to the north-west of Dundee. He was the fourth of seven children of John Fleming (1806&#150;1873), an overseer in linen and jute mills in Lochee and Dundee, and his wife, Annie (1808&#150;1860), the eldest of six children of James McIntosh, an itinerant tailor in Glen Shee, and his wife, Elspith. From such modest beginnings, Robert and John (1847&#150;1925), the two surviving children of the marriage, went on to considerable success. John Fleming established a wood-importing firm in Dundee and Aberdeen, was elected to Aberdeen town council in 1893 and served as lord provost from 1899 to 1902, was knighted in 1908, and sat as Liberal member of parliament for South Aberdeen from 1917 to December 1918. Robert Fleming received a basic education at the Free Church of St David's School, Brown Street, Dundee. At eleven he was awarded a bursary that enabled him to study for a further two years at Dundee high school. There he gained a thorough grounding in mathematics and bookkeeping, which proved of immense value to him in his career. He started work at thirteen as an office boy to James Ramsay jun., a merchant in Dundee's Cowgate, at an annual salary of &pound;5. Within two years he had moved as a clerk to the mercantile office of Cox Brothers, the largest firm of jute spinners and weavers in the world; he then took up an appointment as bookkeeper to Edward Baxter, a prominent Dundee merchant, in 1866.<h2>
<a name="Investmenttrusts"></a>Investment trusts</h2>In his teens Fleming became fascinated by the stock market. The first half of the 1860s was a period of intense financial activity, following legislation permitting the formation of joint-stock companies, many of which were quoted on the London stock exchange. As the number of new companies mushroomed and share prices rose sharply, investors were increasingly driven by blind optimism. The inevitable crash came in 1866, when the major discount house Overend, Gurney &amp; Co. stopped payment, bringing down a number of other companies and precipitating a major financial crisis. One of those companies was the Oriental Commercial Bank, in which a youthful Fleming had invested around &pound;40 of the money he had saved from his salary of &pound;100 per annum. However, the shares were only partly paid, and he was called on to pay a much larger sum. It was money he did not have and he was forced to compromise with the liquidator. Although not legally obliged to do so, Fleming vowed as a matter of honour to pay the calls in full as and when he could, and achieved this within five years. Despite having his fingers badly burnt, he was not put off investing. It was an episode that he never forgot and which shaped his lifelong investment philosophy of courage and caution.<br>
<br>It was during his time with Edward Baxter, who had large holdings of overseas securities, that Fleming developed his investment ideas and in particular his interest in overseas stock markets. He realized that America, recovering from civil war, was a land of boundless opportunity, and that the mortgage bonds of railroads were the key to safe and profitable investment in that country. He also appreciated that British investors were anxious to obtain a greater return than could be earned from domestic securities, but that the vast majority of them were unwilling to risk investing overseas on their own. Fleming decided that the answer lay in promoting an investment trust&#151;then a relatively new concept&#151;which would be invested in American railroad bonds to yield 7 per cent, almost double the return on British government stocks. It says much about his personality and strength of character, his enthusiasm for investment, and his grasp of the complexities and pitfalls of the market in railroad securities that in 1873, aged twenty-seven, he was able to convince four of the most respected and influential businessmen in Dundee that his idea had merit and persuade them to act as trustees of the first investment trust to be formed in Scotland. The Scottish American Investment Trust encountered such an enthusiastic response from investors that the initial prospectus, seeking subscriptions of &pound;150,000, had to be withdrawn and replaced by a prospectus for &pound;300,000. Fleming was appointed secretary of the trust. Later that year he visited America for the first time&#151;he was to cross the Atlantic a total of 128 times&#151;supervising the investment of the trust's funds in railroad bonds. Almost immediately a financial panic hit America, following the collapse of the leading New York banking house of Jay, Cooke &amp; Co., which triggered a severe economic depression that lasted until 1879. It was a testing time for Fleming and the trustees&#151;the first of many&#151;but the trust weathered the storm well. Its success led to the flotation of two further trusts over the next two years, both oversubscribed, increasing the total sum invested to &pound;1.1 million, the bulk of the money raised in Dundee itself.<br>
<br>On 14 February 1881 Fleming married Sarah Kate (1857&#150;1937), the second child of a son and three daughters born to Marshall Kirkland Hindmarsh, a senior official of the Inland Revenue in Scotland, and his wife, Mary Kirby Baylis. They had two sons and two daughters. Two of their grandchildren were <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/31114/', "Peter Fleming (1907&#150;1971)")</script>, the writer and explorer, and his brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/33168/', "Ian Fleming (1908&#150;1964)")</script>, creator of James Bond.<br>
<br>Fleming was never a director of the three trusts, but in 1882 he was invited to join the board of the Dundee Land Investment Company Ltd and its sister company, the Dundee Mortgage and Trust Investment Company Ltd, later part of the Alliance Trust. For four years until his resignation (owing to pressure of other business) Fleming served as the companies' expert on American securities. Few transactions were undertaken without referral to him, and on his visits to the United States he was given wide discretion to acquire investments for the companies. He was closely involved also in negotiations for the transfer of the Matador Cattle Company to Scottish ownership, inspecting the ranch and signing the agreement in Texas on behalf of a syndicate of Dundee businessmen in 1882. The Matador, tightly controlled from Dundee, was one of the very few cattle companies floated during the ranching mania of the early 1880s to survive and prosper. Fleming went on to set up the Investment Trust Corporation in London in 1888 and the British Investment Trust in Edinburgh the following year. He helped establish the Northern American Trust Company in Dundee in 1896 and reorganized the Metropolitan Trust Company in London in 1899. For almost fifty years he exercised enormous influence in the field of investment, being a director of a number of investment trusts and acting as adviser or broker to many more.<h2>
<a name="Americanrailroads"></a>American railroads</h2>It was as an investor and expert on American railroads that Fleming established an early international reputation. Railroads were America's first &#145;big business&#146;, but they were not for the unwary or faint-hearted. In addition to fraud and corruption, investors frequently had to contend with mismanagement and stock-manipulation on a grand scale. Superimposed on this was the business cycle of boom and bust. The often reckless over-expansion of the rail network during the good years brought disaster when economic depression set in, many railroads being forced into receivership more than once. In 1876, at the age of thirty, Fleming and a colleague were asked by Sir Edward Watkin MP to go to New York on behalf of the London bondholders' committee of the Erie Railway, then in receivership, to confer with representatives of the company. Their plan for the financial reorganization of Erie was largely adopted. Subsequently Fleming was involved in the restructuring of other railroads, including the Denver and Rio Grande (1884&#150;6), the Mexican National (1886), the East Tennessee, Virginia, and Georgia (1885&#150;6), the Atchison, Topeka, and Santa F&eacute; (1894&#150;6), and the Norfolk and Western (1895&#150;6), of which he was also a director between 1886 and 1893. He was regarded in railroad and banking circles as a shrewd operator. He needed all his astuteness, perspicacity, and experience in 1886, when he assumed a central role in the battle with Jay Gould, the notorious railroad promoter and speculator, for control of the Texas and Pacific Railway. For a time it looked as if Gould, one of the most intelligent and artful operators of them all, would wrest control of the company from its bondholders and shareholders for next to nothing, but when Fleming arrived in New York and united the majority of the opposing parties behind his plan, Gould's attempt at &#145;daylight robbery&#146; was foiled, though not without a fight.<h2>
<a name="London"></a>London</h2>In 1884 Fleming turned down the offer of a lucrative partnership in the New York banking house of Jesup, Paton &amp; Co. because he was unwilling to commit his family and himself to living in that city for the rest of his life. However, towards the end of the 1880s he became restless: he had been playing on an international stage and Dundee seemed to him rather restricting. In 1890 he decided to move his business to London, though retaining his Dundee office. He resigned as secretary of the three Scottish-American investment trusts, but, anxious to retain his expertise, the Dundee trustees appointed him their London correspondent. His family lived in Chislehurst for twelve years before Fleming purchased the Nettlebed estate in Oxfordshire, where he built a large mansion, Joyce Grove. He was high sheriff of Oxfordshire in 1909. He went on to acquire a town house in London, in Grosvenor Square. As a City financier for more than thirty years there were few ventures of any significance that he did not help to finance. He underwrote or placed issues of securities by companies in every corner of the world worth tens of millions of pounds using his network of British investment trusts, insurance companies, and other clients. Major commitments included supporting E. H. Harriman's restructuring of the Union Pacific Railroad in the early years of the twentieth century, financing Sir William van Horne in the construction of railways in Cuba, and underwriting issues amounting to more than &pound;15 million by Anglo-Persian Oil Company, the forerunner of British Petroleum.<br>
<br>In 1904 Fleming engaged Walter Whigham, a young Scottish accountant, as his assistant. Although Fleming had admitted to working better &#145;in single harness&#146;, he needed help. Approaching sixty, his business was increasing and he was frequently away in Scotland or America. He also had a number of other commitments. For example, in 1906 he was appointed a member of the finance committee of King Edward's Hospital Fund for London, and the following year he was made an extraordinary director of the Royal Bank of Scotland. In 1909 he took his elder son, Valentine, and Whigham into partnership. His younger son, Philip, joined the firm in 1911. Tragically Valentine was killed in action in France in 1917. After the war the partnership went from strength to strength. It is said that Robert Fleming &amp; Co. was one of only two City institutions that issuing houses would invariably consult before deciding on the terms of a new issue, the other being the Prudential.<h2>
<a name="Personalityandreputation"></a>Personality and reputation</h2>Fleming had an indefatigable energy for work. Above average in height, well-built, and erect, he presented a distinguished appearance. He was a serious, rather reserved man, who did not engage in idle conversation. Even to those who knew him he was a man of few words, these being delivered in a deep voice with a Scots accent. He could appear severe and intimidating, but by nature he was a kindly person and an adoring husband and father. He was very keen on outdoor pursuits&#151;particularly, when he was young, rowing and walking; latterly his passion was stalking. With two exceptions, each year from 1892 until his death he rented a Scottish sporting estate where the family gathered in late summer. He was a fine shot, bagging two stags the same day at Black Mount in Argyll, in 1929, at the age of eighty-four.<br>
<br>Robert Fleming became a financier of international repute, establishing in London the investment bank that bore his name for more than a century until it was sold to Chase Manhattan Corporation in 2000. Throughout his life he was closely associated with investment trusts in Scotland and England. He is often referred to as the father of the investment trust, being largely responsible for establishing the principles of sound investment-trust management. A contemporary of J. Pierpont Morgan and a close business associate and friend of Jacob Schiff of the New York investment bank of Kuhn, Loeb &amp; Co., Fleming was widely known and respected in financial circles on both sides of the Atlantic, a man of unquestioned integrity. He was among the shrewdest investors of his generation and an acknowledged expert on financing railways, particularly in the United States, Mexico, and Cuba. Despite his success and accumulated wealth, Fleming remained modest, unassuming, and very generous, his unostentatious benevolence supporting both national and local causes. He never forgot his birthplace, donating sums to University College, Dundee, and in 1929 donating &pound;155,000 to the city to finance the building of houses for Dundee's workers. He received the honorary degree of doctor of laws from St Andrews University in 1928 in recognition of his gifts and of his advice to University College over many years. In 1929 he was made a freeman of the city of Dundee. Fleming died suddenly of heart failure at Black Mount, Bridge of Orchy, Argyll, on 31 July 1933, aged eighty-eight. He was buried at Nettlebed three days later.<br>
