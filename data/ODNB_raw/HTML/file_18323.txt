<span class="headword">Mather,  Nathaniel</span>  (1630&#150;1697), <span class="occ">Independent minister</span>, was the second son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18324/', "Richard Mather (1596&#150;1669)")</script>, minister, and Katherine (<i>d</i>. 1655), daughter of Edmund Holt. He was born in Much Woolton, Lancashire, on 20 March 1630 and in 1635 travelled with his family to Massachusetts, where his father became minister for the town of Dorchester. He attended Harvard College, and graduated MA in 1647. He soon returned to England, probably at the same time as his brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18326/', "Samuel Mather")</script> in 1650 and perhaps inspired by Oliver Cromwell's call for ministers in Ireland. On his arrival he wrote to his Harvard friend John Rogers that &#145;'Tis a notion of mighty great and high respect to have been a New-English man, 'tis enough to gayne a man very much respect, yea almost any preferment&#146;  (<span class="italic">Mather Papers</span>, 4). And indeed Mather was soon placed in the ministry, serving first as an assistant to George Mortimer at Harberton, Devon, and then succeeding Mortimer in 1655. The next year he was presented by Oliver Cromwell to the living of Barnstaple in Devon. He befriended John Howe and became a member of the Devonshire Association. He also served as an assistant to the Devon commission of triers. During this period he married Mary (<i>d</i>. 1699&times;1706), daughter of the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2099/', "Revd William Benn")</script> of Dorchester, England. Their only child died in infancy in 1660. Nathaniel was possibly one of the delegates at the congregationalists' Savoy conference in 1658.<br>
<br>Mather was disappointed by the Restoration and he was ejected in 1660. Like most nonconformists he was horrified by the 1661 uprising led by the radical Thomas Venner and signed the declaration against it. He then left England with the aid of Matthew Mead and became pastor of an English congregation in Rotterdam. Calamy says that he briefly ministered to a congregation in Sudbury, Suffolk, in 1671. When his brother Samuel died in 1671 he accepted the call to replace him as pastor of the New Row congregational church in Dublin. He laboured to bring some of Samuel's works to print and led a drive to raise funds in Dublin for the relief of New Englanders suffering from King Philip's War. In the early 1680s his congregation experienced difficulties due to declining membership and a division over the selection of the young Nathaniel Weld as Mather's assistant. In the aftermath of the Rye House plot of 1683 persecution of dissenters in Dublin was stepped up and Mather's congregation was forced to meet privately. In 1688 Mather left Ireland to accept the pastorate of the Lime Street Church in London, succeeding another former New Englander, John Collins, who had died in November 1687.<br>
<br>Nathaniel provided his brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18322/', "Increase Mather")</script> and other colonists with information on English and Irish religious and political developments and followed events in New England closely. In the 1660s he wrote a foreword to his father's treatise in favour of the half-way covenant, a move aimed at expanding numbers in New England churches by allowing the children of congregation members to join as partial or &#145;half-way&#146; members before they had experienced religious conversion. He worked with Increase when the latter went to England in 1688&#150;92 to seek a reversal of the policies that had led to the formation of the dominion of New England. Nathaniel is also believed to have worked with John Howe, George Griffith, and other dissenting clergymen in support of the revolution of 1688&#150;9 which placed William of Orange on the English throne.<br>
<br>Nathaniel was initially a supporter of the &#145;heads of agreement&#146;, the union of congregational and presbyterian clergy that his brother Increase had helped to organize, and he was one of the original managers of the common fund for the support of such clergy in the early 1690s. But while his brother Samuel had been a leading proponent of interdenominational co-operation, and Increase a supporter of the movement, Nathaniel was much less eirenic and more suspicious of presbyterians. He was one of the clergy who attacked Daniel Williams in 1693 for preaching Arminian views, a dispute which led to the break-up of the union and the withdrawal of the Presbyterian clergy from the jointly sponsored Pinners Hall lectureship. Mather was one of those then named to the vacant positions at Pinners Hall.<br>
<br>Mather died in London on 26 July 1697 and was buried in Bunhill Fields. He was survived by his wife, whose will of 29 April 1699 was proved in 1706. Mather was said to have been of a &#145;most amiable spirit and &hellip; an unaffected modesty&#146; in his personal relationships, and as a preacher &#145;his aspect was venerable, his gesture pleasing, and his pronunciation agreeable&#146;, although &#145;in addressing sinners, he possessed an awfulness in his manner&#146; and he had &#145;a certain heaviness in the pulpit, which rendered him unpopular&#146;  (Sibley, 159).<br>
