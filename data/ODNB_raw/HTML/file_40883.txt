<span class="headword">Church,  Richard Thomas</span>  (1893&#150;1972), <span class="occ">poet and writer</span>, was born in Battersea, London, on 26 March 1893, the younger son of Thomas Church, a postal worker, and Lavinia, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Orton, a schoolteacher. He was educated at Dulwich Hamlet School, and his early ambition was to be a painter, but economic necessity dictated that he join the civil service. He served in various clerical grades between 1909 and 1933, working in a laboratory belonging to customs, and, subsequently, in the Ministry of Labour. He described his experiences in a trilogy of novels beginning with <span class="italic">The Porch</span> (1937), which won the Femina Vie Heureuse prize for the most distinctive novel of the year. Three volumes of autobiography also draw on these early experiences, although they exhibit less of a Dickensian flourish: <span class="italic">Over the Bridge</span> (1955), <span class="italic">The Golden Sovereign</span> (1957), and <span class="italic">The Voyage Home</span> (1964).<br>
<br>All this time, Church was assiduously writing poems, mainly in a subdued late-Georgian mode. Though never formally a pupil, he was encouraged by Professor Israel Gollancz, of King's College, London, and by a senior colleague in the custom house, who subsidized A. C. Fifield in the publication of Church's first book, <span class="italic">Flood of Life</span> (1917). Through the poet Humbert Wolfe, his chief at the Ministry of Labour, Church improved his literary acquaintance, meeting Herbert Read, F. S. Flint, T. S. Eliot, and Clifford Bax. This last, in due course, supplemented Church's civil service income with a small pension. <span class="italic">The Spectator</span>, which had printed most of the poems Church had submitted to it, engaged him as a regular reviewer, from 1922 onwards. This put him on the fringes of the Bloomsbury group, and enabled him also to contribute to such periodicals as the <span class="italic">New Statesman</span>, <span class="italic">The Nation</span>, and the <span class="italic">Westminster Gazette</span>. In 1915 he had married Caroline Jessica, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Parfett (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1893), a connection of his father's. He was commuting to Whitehall from Limpsfield in Surrey, where he had been advised to live for the sake of his somewhat uncertain health. He was also the father of a small daughter.<br>
<br>In the effort to maintain his family, Church ventured into prose fiction. His first novel, <span class="italic">Oliver's Daughter</span>, was published in 1930 by Dent. Oliver is an intellectual grocer, whose daughter runs off with a distinguished musician. Here, as in other novels, Church was able to draw on the multifarious people he had met, and also on his deep and abiding love for music. His first marriage ended in divorce, and on 19 November 1930 he married Catherina Anna Schimmer (1897/8&#150;1965), a silversmith with whom he was to have three children. His second novel with Dent, <span class="italic">High Summer</span>, was published in 1932, and led to a contract as advisory editor. Church was thus brought into contact with a younger generation of writers; he was instrumental in the publication of, among others, Dylan Thomas, Clifford Dyment, Margot Ruddock, and Hal Summers. The post also gave him a greater degree of financial stability, and he was now able to leave the civil service. He settled his family in Kent, an area about which Church was to write atmospherically in several books: <span class="italic">Kent</span> (1948), <span class="italic">A Window on a Hill</span> (1951), and <span class="italic">A Country Window</span> (1955).<br>
<br>Church's reputation as a poet had grown steadily, with collections of lyrics such as <span class="italic">A Glance Backward</span> (1930), <span class="italic">News from the Mountain</span> (1932), and <span class="italic">The Solitary Man</span> (1941), together with a narrative poem, <span class="italic">The Lamp</span> (1946). If that reputation has tended to wane in recent years, it is probably because his ear for verse, although true in itself, operated over a limited range. His best individual poems are &#145;Solstices&#146;, &#145;A House in Wartime&#146;, &#145;The Man without Faith&#146;, and &#145;The Wrong Road&#146;. He had the good sense to put these into an anthology he edited for Dent with Mildred Boznan: <span class="italic">Poems of our Time</span> (1945). There is a distinct family resemblance to both Robert Graves and W. H. Davies:<blockquote>
<div>Say this when you return,<br>
</div>
<div>&#145;I came by the wrong road,<br>
</div>
<div>And saw the starved woods burn.<br>
</div>
<div>I stopped, bewildered, lost,<br>
</div>
<div>And of a sudden heard<br>
</div>
<div>The red-throated bird,<br>
</div>
<div>The holy bird, the ghost &hellip;&#146;<br>
</div>
</blockquote>But readers have tended to prefer the style of Graves and Davies as deployed by those original masters.<br>
<br>It is significant that Church could see little merit in the work of Gerard Manley Hopkins and Eliot. He appears to have been conscious of no more than their sonic properties. This goes along with the nature of his interest in performance, as evinced in <span class="italic">Poems for Speaking</span> (1950). The book is dedicated to that lyrical actor, Robert Donat, and has, among its specimens of (for example) the ballad, Rossetti's &#145;The Blessed Damozel&#146;, and Mangan's &#145;Dark Rosaleen&#146;, rather than the brusque productions of the Scottish border. Church himself had a singularly beautiful speaking voice, bass-baritone rather than bass, somewhat incongruously emerging from his spare, professorial frame. This may suggest at once the qualities and the economies of his sensibility.<br>
<br>Church wrote a book on the English novel in 1951, but his most concerted critical effort is <span class="italic">Eight for Immortality</span> (1941). These &#145;eight&#146; are the modern poets he is most prepared to support. He finds himself out of his depth with Yeats and Eliot, makes a persuasive case for Blunden and Victoria Sackville-West, but predictably is most at home with Graves and Davies. The essay on the latter, in fact, is probably the most discerning written so far:<blockquote>He has a child's particularity which is yet such an oddly unscientific power, because it has no sense of relationship or classification &hellip; Search his poems and you will find a thousand references to the robin, that &#145;feathered bully&#146; the sparrow, or to the nightingale with &#145;the moon's white beams across her throat&#146;.</blockquote>Church's writing spanned a range of genres; in 1941 he produced a children's book called <span class="italic">Rufus</span> (printed in America as <span class="italic">A Squirrel called Rufus</span>), which dealt with a war between native English red squirrels and the invading grey squirrels, the allegorical implications of which were unmistakable. He also wrote some works of travel literature, but it is likely that Church's most enduring work will be his three autobiographies. They evoke poignant reminiscences of his energetic father and his charismatic elder brother, a tactile sense of shabby gentility in Battersea and Dulwich, and a positively olfactory evocation of the civil service laboratory in which he worked for so many years.<br>
<br>Church was appointed CBE in 1953. His second wife died in 1965, and on 25 February 1967 he married Dorothy Mary Beale (1896&#150;1989), the widowed daughter of John Booker. He died at his home, the Priest's House, Sissinghurst, Cranbrook, Kent, on 4 March 1972.<br>
