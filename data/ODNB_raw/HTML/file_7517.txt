<span class="headword">Denton,  Nathan</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1635, <em>d.</em> 1720), <span class="occ">clergyman and ejected minister</span>, was born in Bradfield in the parish of Ecclesfield, West Riding of Yorkshire, the son of Francis Denton, and baptized at Bradfield Chapel on 8 January 1635. From the grammar school at Worsborough he went to University College, Oxford, where he matriculated in 1654 and graduated BA in 1657. After university he returned to the corner of Yorkshire where he had been raised and where he was to spend most of the rest of his life. First he taught at the grammar school at Cawthorne, preaching alternately at Cawthorne and High Hoyland. He was ordained in 1658 at Hemsworth by the West Riding presbytery as minister of High Hoyland. From there he moved to Derwent chapel, Derbyshire, and early in 1660 to the perpetual curacy of Bolton upon Dearne in the West Riding (his predecessor was buried on 27 March 1660). At Bolton on 6 February 1662 he married Anne Burley (<i>d</i>. 1715), with whom he had five children: Daniel, John, Hannah, Ruth, and Joseph.<br>
<br>Denton was ejected from Bolton upon Dearne under the <span class="roman">Act of Uniformity</span> of 1662 but continued to live in the parish, except for two periods of about two years each during the enforcement of the <span class="roman">Five Mile Act</span> (1665). For a year after his ejection he preached in the parish church of Hickleton, West Riding, where he was maintained as lecturer by Lady Jackson, sister of George Booth, Baron Delamer. Thomas Vincent (<i>d</i>. 1667) of Barnborough Grange near Bolton upon Dearne offered Denton an Anglican living worth &pound;100 p.a. but he refused this and all other offers of preferment, which Edmund Calamy noted he &#145;could not accept with Satisfaction to his Conscience, and declared he never yet repented his Nonconformity&#146;  (Calamy, <span class="italic">Continuation</span>, 2.950&#150;51). In 1669 he was reported as again preaching at Hickleton, formerly at Jackson's house and now at another house. On 8 May 1672 he was licensed as a presbyterian to preach at the house of Silvanus Rich, near Penistone, West Riding. Under the <span class="roman">Toleration Act</span> he was granted a certificate at the Barnsley sessions on 15 October 1689 to use his house at Bolton upon Dearne as a place of worship. From 1690 onwards he appears to have preached at various places in Yorkshire and Derbyshire, including to a presbyterian congregation at Great Houghton, a township in the parish of Darfield which lay adjacent to Bolton. From 1693 to 1720 he was in receipt of a grant from the Common Fund.<br>
<br>Calamy, writing in August 1713 when Denton was in his eightieth year, says that he still preached sometimes at Great Houghton. To Calamy he was &#145;the picture of an old puritan&#146;, who led &#145;an unblameable life, and maintained his integrity&#146;  (Calamy, <span class="italic">Continuation</span>, 2.951). When he died in 1720 Denton had outlived all those who had been ejected with him fifty-eight years before. He was buried at Bolton upon Dearne on 12 or 13 October 1720. His eldest son, Daniel Denton (1663&#150;1721), followed him in his ministry and connections and for twenty-eight years was chaplain to the Riches of Bull House, Penistone, and ministered to a congregation there.<br>
