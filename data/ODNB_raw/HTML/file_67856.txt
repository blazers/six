<span class="headword">Drake,  Richard</span>  (1609&#150;1681), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, was born in the parish of St Peter Westcheap, London, on 21 April 1609, the second son of Roger Drake (<i>d</i>. 1650/51), a London mercer, and his wife, Margaret, daughter of John Allyn of Uttoxeter. He was educated at Eppingham from 1616 to 1624, until in June that year he was admitted to Pembroke College, Cambridge. He was elected Greek scholar in 1626, and graduated BA in 1627, MA in 1631, BD in 1639, and DD in 1661. In 1631 he was elected a fellow of his college, which had become well known for espousing anti-Calvinistic beliefs and practices. Drake was one of several younger scholars closely associated with and profoundly influenced by Lancelot Andrewes and Matthew Wren. In 1635 he contributed Latin verses to the preface of Robert Shelford's <span class="italic">Five Pious and Learned Discourses</span>, a tract whose arguments for free will and Laudian ceremonial made it notorious. In 1640 a report for the House of Commons on religious innovation at the university described Drake as an &#145;active and forward man to promote the new practises&#146; and listed him among those who &#145;gave great offence in theire sermons&#146;  (BL, Harley MS 7019, fol. 63). In 1639 Drake had preached on <span class="roman">Romans</span> 2: 22 on the provocative theme that those who abhor idols commit sacrilege.<br>
<br>Drake was ordained in 1635, and was licensed to preach in Norwich diocese by Matthew Wren in 1636. In 1638 he became rector of the Essex parish of Radwinter, a living to which his father had purchased the right of presentation. Drake set about repairing and decorating the church in accordance with his advanced ceremonialist beliefs. This deeply offended the puritans among his parishioners and precipitated a violent conflict. Drake's manuscript account of that conflict, &#145;Affronts and insolencies com[m]itted in the parish of Radwinter, against the divine service, and the ministers therof&#146;, provides one of the most detailed accounts of the troubles suffered by a royalist clergyman in the prelude to, and during, the English civil war. Trouble began in 1640 when the images erected by Drake were destroyed by a group of soldiers who, finding Drake absent from the parish, were reported to have thrown the head of a duck into the church, saying, &#145;they would serve the Drake so if they could Catch him&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 21935, fol. 89<i>r</i>). Drake's response, repeating for the benefit of his parishioners the provocative sermon he gave in 1639, betrays something of the combative character which contributed to his problems.<br>
<br>After a series of clashes with his parishioners Drake was forced to flee Radwinter in 1643. Following his ejection he lived in London, where he met and on 29 May 1654 married Jane Lambert (<i>d</i>. 1662), a widow; shortly thereafter he moved to Richmond, Surrey. His Latin autobiography, covering his life to 1658, detailed what he saw as his continuing political persecution at the hands of parliament and its committees. His elder brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8029/', "Roger Drake")</script>, a physician and later a presbyterian minister, was able to use his good offices to offer him some protection. But in 1651 both brothers were arrested and briefly imprisoned for their supposed part in the conspiracy to help the Scots bring Charles II to the throne of England. The plot, in which their brother William Drake was a ringleader, became known as Love's plot&#151;after the principal victim of official retribution, Christopher Love. Drake's autobiography also offers valuable evidence of the successful attempt of loyalists in the revolution to continue to live their lives by the rites of the Anglican church. In 1647 Drake had an audience with the king, and in 1648 he dedicated to the future Charles II his translation of Andrewes's Greek prayers&#151;<span class="italic">A Manual of the Private Devotions and Meditations of the Right Reverend Father in God Lancelot Andrews</span>&#151;Andrewes's great testament to prayer-centred piety.<br>
<br>After the Restoration Drake came into his own. Restored to his living of Radwinter, he became a chaplain to Charles II. In September 1662, shortly after the death of his wife, he was collated prebendary of Alton Borealis in Salisbury Cathedral. He was chancellor from 1663 until his death. Drake resigned at Radwinter in 1667, and when he died on 16 October 1681 he was also rector of Wyke Regis, Dorset. He was buried in Salisbury Cathedral.<br>
