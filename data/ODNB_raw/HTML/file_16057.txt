</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Lant,  Thomas</span>  (1554/5&#150;1600/01), <span class="occ">herald and draughtsman</span>, was born in Gloucester, one of the seven children and four sons of Thomas Lant of Gloucester and his wife, Mayens or Mary Mounsloe of Shropshire. At the age of twelve he became a page to Richard Cheyney, bishop of Gloucester, and after Cheyney's death in 1579 page to Henry, Baron Cheyne of Toddington, with whom he remained &#145;some two or three years&#146;  (College of Arms, Arundel MS 40, fol. 1). He may have been the Thomas Lant who in 1580 gathered a collection of tunes on a roll of parchment (King's College, Cambridge, Rowe MS 1). Lord Cheyne recommended Lant to Sir Philip Sidney, whom he accompanied to the Low Countries in November 1585; he remained there until Sidney's death on 17 October 1586. Lant was the draughtsman of a remarkable roll measuring over 35 feet by about 7&frac34; inches, engraved on thirty copperplates by Theodore De Bry, recording Sir Philip's funeral procession at St Paul's Cathedral on 16 February 1587. Lant's portrait appears on the first plate; dated 1587, it gives his age as thirty-two.<br>
<br>Lant was next employed by Sidney's father-in-law, Sir Francis Walsingham, the secretary of state, on whose recommendation and that of Sidney's uncle the earl of Leicester he obtained appointment as Portcullis pursuivant at the College of Arms, his patent being signed by the queen on 20 May 1588 and dated under the great seal 9 January 1589. In 1589 he compiled an augmented version of the account of the English baronage by Robert Cooke, Clarenceux  (BL, Sloane MS 4959). As Portcullis Lant wrote <span class="italic">Observations and Collections Concerning the Office and Officers of Arms</span> (College of Arms, Arundel MS 40), a good source of information on the College of Arms in the 1590s, which he described as &#145;a company full of discord and envy&#146;  (College of Arms, Arundel MS 40, fol. 6<i>r</i>). At the back of this manuscript his arms appear impaled with those of Houghton of Beckbury, Shropshire, reflecting his marriage at an unknown date to Elizabeth (<i>c</i>.1573&#150;1629), daughter of Richard Houghton. He may be the Thomas Lant, author of <span class="italic">Daily Exercise of a Christian</span> (1590). In 1595 he presented to the queen a catalogue of officers of arms known as Lant's roll, unfortunately containing inaccuracies but purporting to show that promotion in the College of Arms was always by seniority. A number of copies survive. A manuscript in Lant's hand includes notes on the creation of peers and knights (College of Arms, MS B.P.11).<br>
<br>In 1596 Lant challenged the universally disliked Ralph Brooke (<i>c</i>.1553&#150;1625), York herald, and never had an answer. Subsequently meeting Brooke near Temple Bar he boxed him under the right ear and &#145;bumbasted his shoulders &amp; his sydes very handsomely&#146;  (College of Arms, Arundel MS 40, fol. 38<i>v</i>). He was created Windsor herald on 23 October 1597, though the patent was issued only on 29 November 1600, shortly before his death. He was alive on 26 December 1600 but is thought to have died early in the new year. Letters of administration for his estate were granted to his widow on 9 May 1601. They had two children, a daughter, Theodosia, who married James Norton, and a son, Thomas, who was born after his father's death and died on 18 May 1688, aged eighty-six, as rector of Hornsey, Middlesex. Elizabeth Lant, on 28 September 1609 at the Savoy Chapel, Westminster, married the physician and alchemist Francis Anthony (<i>d</i>. 1623). The marriage licence describes her as aged about thirty-six, relict of Thomas Lant, gent., deceased eight years since.<br>
