<span class="headword">Murray,  Keith Anderson Hope</span>, Baron Murray of Newhaven  (1903&#150;1993), <span class="occ">agricultural economist and university administrator</span>, was born at 62 Great King Street, Edinburgh, on 28 July 1903, the third of five sons (there were no daughters) of Charles David Murray (1866&#150;1936), judge of the court of session as Lord Murray, and his wife, Ann Florence (Annie), fifth daughter of David Nicolson, of Parsons Green, Edinburgh. He followed his father through Edinburgh Academy and Edinburgh University, taking a degree in agriculture with the intention of becoming a farmer. After a year with the board of agriculture, however, he was awarded a Commonwealth Fund fellowship for study in the United States at Cornell University, returning in 1929 with a PhD and a budding international reputation as an agricultural economist. After further postgraduate study at Oxford (collecting a BLitt), he joined the University Agricultural Economics Research Institute at that university, which was at that time contributing much to the development of Oxford economics. His first book, <span class="italic">Land and Life</span> (1932), was immediately followed by another, <span class="italic">The Planning of Agriculture</span> (1933), and he was on the road to a significant academic career. His work in agricultural economics culminated in the publication in 1955 of the <span class="italic">Agriculture</span> volume in the official <span class="italic">History of the Second World War</span>. In 1937 however he took a step into administration which he came to regard as the turning point of his career. He was appointed fellow and bursar of Lincoln College, which was going through a very difficult time financially. Only thirty-four, he injected new life into the college, transforming its economy and earning high praise from its junior members for his accessibility.<br>
<br>On the outbreak of the Second World War, Murray was drafted into the Ministry of Food, but subsequently worked as a radar controller in the RAF for two years before being appointed director of food and agriculture in the Middle East Supply Centre, with the responsibility of ensuring food supplies not only for the allied forces in the region, but also for the civilian population. Meanwhile, in 1944 the fellows of Lincoln College elected him in his absence as their new rector. With characteristic energy he also remained as bursar, and in the immediate post-war years he transformed the college intellectually, socially, financially, and in sport. His achievements were noted widely outside Oxford, and he is said to have declined many offers of high positions in order to consolidate his work in the college.<br>
<br>In 1952 however Murray yielded to heavy pressure from friends and colleagues within the university world, and accepted the chairmanship of the University Grants Committee at what was to be a critical period in the history of British universities. He served two full terms, retiring in 1963. During that decade were laid the foundations of the expansion and transformation of the university system. Murray himself was from the outset an expansionist&#151;not at that time a particularly fashionable view in academic circles. His decade in office saw annual capital expenditure on universities increase fifteenfold, and seven new universities planned and designated. In this period however the number of students had still not kept pace with the increase in the relevant age group, still less with the number of those qualified by their earlier education. Murray himself saw his job as providing the universities with the tools and physical structure they needed for what he perceived to be the unavoidable task of long-term expansion. He was also convinced that the universities would not tackle this satisfactorily unless they could be assured of autonomy in doing so. This implied control by the universities of the use of the resources allocated to them, as well as control over admissions, appointments, promotions, discipline, and above all over the content of teaching and research. With the financial, physical and organizational foundations in place Murray encouraged the government in the early 1960s to appoint what was to become the Robbins committee to map out the future expansion. Though he was not himself a member his influence was said (by the secretary of the committee) to have rivalled that of Lord Robbins himself, and almost every aspect of the committee's report affecting universities was developed from the foundations laid down by Murray's work at the University Grants Committee over the previous decade.<br>
<br>Throughout his career Murray was always ready to add extra jobs to his already busy load. He was indeed a leading member of the &#145;great and the good&#146;, an &#145;all-purpose public man&#146;. While still at Oxford he served as a city councillor, on the county education committee, and as a magistrate. On the international scene he was in the late 1940s a member of the committee of inquiry into disturbances in the Gold Coast, which led to a new constitution which was the first step to the independence of Ghana. While at the University Grants Committee he accepted an invitation from the government of Australia to chair a commission which led directly to the remarkable development and expansion of Australian universities in the 1960s. After his &#145;retirement&#146; he spent eight years as director of the Leverhulme Trust (1964&#150;72), and combined this with trusteeship of the other great private foundation concerned with research and education in the UK, the Wellcome Trust (1965&#150;73). He also served on the boards of the Metal Box and British Aero companies, though the private sector never really engaged his enthusiasm.<br>
<br>Murray was a large man in every sense: tall, genial, and energetic. He moved easily and confidently in government circles, both Westminster and Whitehall. In one sense he could be said to have presided over the last golden years of a University Grants Committee system, in which relations between British governments and universities were characterized by personal trust and mutual respect. He was, he admitted, fortunate in that all the key stages of his career&#151;Lincoln College, the University Grants Committee, and Leverhulme&#151;involved the management of growth and expansion rather than curtailment and retrenchment.<br>
<br>Murray was honoured both by the government and by universities at home and abroad. He was knighted in 1955, appointed KCB in 1963, and created a life peer in 1964. Chancellor of the University of Southampton from 1964 to 1974, he received honorary degrees from Oxford, Cambridge, Bristol, Liverpool, Leicester, Edinburgh, Southampton, and Hull, as well as from California and Western Australia. He was a devout Presbyterian, with a firm commitment to his values, but in no way censorious of others. With a wide circle of affectionate friends, he did not marry, and spent the last decade of his life quietly in his small flat in Westminster. He died in London on 10 October 1993.<br>
