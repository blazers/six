<span class="headword">Philipps,  John Wynford</span>, first Viscount St Davids  (1860&#150;1938), <span class="occ">financier and politician</span>, was born at the vicarage in Warminster, Wiltshire, on 30 May 1860, the eldest of six sons of the Revd Sir James Erasmus Philipps, twelfth baronet (1824&#150;1912), vicar of Warminster, and his wife, the Hon. Mary Margaret Best (<i>d</i>. 1913). Sir James, later a prebendary of Salisbury Cathedral, was a prominent and energetic Anglo-Catholic and established a religious order for women, a training college for missionary priests, and a number of charitable institutions in his parish. His was a remarkable family; apart from St Davids three of his sons achieved distinction&#151;Major-General Sir Ivor Philipps, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35508/', "Owen Cosby Philipps, Baron Kylsant")</script>, and Laurence Richard Philipps, Baron Milford; and one of his five daughters&#151;Elsbeth Fell Philipps was assistant director of milk, at the Ministry of Food during the First World War. All the brothers were tall, imposing men.<br>
<br>John Philipps was educated at Felsted School and at Keble College, Oxford, where he graduated with a third-class degree in modern history in 1882. He was called to the bar at the Middle Temple in 1886, but he was already determined to enter parliament as a Gladstonian Liberal. He failed at his first attempt in Wiltshire in 1886, and then with help from his brother Owen he won Mid Lanarkshire in 1888. Earlier in that year on 14 February he had married Leonora Gerstenberg (1862&#150;1915), heir to almost &pound;100,000 left by her father, Isidor Gerstenberg, founder of the Corporation of Foreign Bondholders, which represented UK investors in overseas stock. John used his new-found wealth to establish a shipping business in partnership with Owen.<br>
<br>Philipps's commercial ambitions lay elsewhere, however, in the developing world of investment trusts, which were being increasingly used to channel family funds into areas of new development, particularly abroad, where rates of return and risks were high. Although many trusts were public companies, they were controlled by a tight-knit group of City men who often used them to extend their own business interests. In 1890, sponsored by his father, a successful fund-raiser for his various ecclesiastical and charitable ventures, he was elected to the board of the Government Stock and Other Securities Investment Company. Within a year, against the background of the crisis at Barings, he had conducted a radical review of the company's investments, brought his school friend J. S. Austen onto the board, and been elected chairman. In this position, through a web of cross-share holdings, Philipps had a voice in the affairs of other investment trusts, including the Omnium Investment Company, the Government and General Investment Trust Ltd, and the Consolidated Trust Ltd. These trusts were quickly brought under his control and new ventures were floated, including the Trustees Industrial and Investment Company in 1891 and the Premier Investment Company in 1892. Philipps used the funds of these trusts and his growing knowledge of the investment business to help his brother Owen to expand his shipping interests. Together in 1897 they established the London Maritime Investment Company, entirely to finance further shipping and related acquisitions.<br>
<br>Philipps did not confine his interests to shipping. During the 1890s he also became a director and chairman of several railway companies operating in Costa Rica and Argentina. These he reorganized, refinanced, and encouraged to expand. When he became chairman of the Buenos Aires and Pacific Railway Company it had little more than 400 hundred miles of track; by amalgamation and extension he was able to develop it into a network of over 4000 miles, reaching from Buenos Aires to Chile, and connecting with the Transandean Line. Later Philipps was involved in several companies promoted by Henry O'Hagan, including British Electric, Associated Portland Cement Manufacturers Ltd, and British Portland Cement Manufacturers Ltd. To help control many of these investments he arranged for the appointment of his brothers Ivor, Bertram Erasmus, and Laurence Richard to their boards.<br>
<br>Despite his many business involvements Philipps remained deeply engaged in Liberal politics. He resigned his Mid Lanarkshire seat in 1894, but in 1898 he was returned for Pembrokeshire. A close supporter of Lloyd George, he resigned his seat in 1908 reportedly to make way for Winston Churchill. He was immediately created a peer as Viscount St Davids of Roch Castle in Pembrokeshire. By this time, Owen and he had embarked on more ambitious maritime adventures, acquiring the Royal Mail Steam Packet Company in 1902, Elder Dempster Ltd and the Pacific Steam Navigation Company in 1910, and the Union Castle Line in 1912. In building this shipping empire, known as the Royal Mail Group, Owen began to work closely with William Pirrie, of the Belfast shipbuilders Harland and Wolff. By the eve of the First World War their method of financing their deals through the use of large amounts of loan capital relative to equity were beginning to raise eyebrows in the City, and St Davids distanced himself from his brother's activities.<br>
<br>According to family legend the deterioration in the brothers' relationship was caused by Owen's efforts to make up a long-standing family feud with his cousin Sir Henry Erasmus Philipps of Picton Castle, who had inherited the estates but not the baronetcy from their common forebear Lord Milford. This loss of the family home was deeply resented and St Davids refused to forgive his brother for attending a garden party at Picton. The rift was made final in 1916 when Owen became a Conservative, St Davids remaining a loyal Liberal. St Davids was appointed chairman of the Lloyd George Fund and helped to set up the National Liberal political fund to provide Lloyd George with independent financial backing. He was instrumental in the fund's purchase of United Newspapers in 1918. Both of St Davids's sons were killed in the First World War, Colwyn Erasmus Arnold (1888&#150;1915) and Roland Erasmus (1890&#150;1916). His wife, Leonora, died in 1915. In the following year he married Elizabeth Frances Rawdon-Hastings (1884&#150;1938), later Baroness Strange, Baroness Hungerford and Baroness Moleyns, second daughter of Paulyn Francis Cuthbert Rawdon-Hastings and Lady Maud Grimston. They had a son, Jestyn Reginald Austen Plantagenet, and a daughter.<br>
<br>After the war St Davids's investment trusts grew in size and importance and were known collectively as the Old Broad Street Group from their offices at 69 Old Broad Street, London. Although St Davids continued to act as a trustee for some of the debentures issued by the Royal Mail Group, the trusts during these years largely financed other businesses, like Ilford Ltd, Schweppes Ltd, and Court Line Ltd, which were managed by Ivor and Laurence Philipps. The Old Broad Street Group also developed extensive links with other large investment trusts. Much of St Davids's time in the 1920s was taken up with public work, particularly the chairmanship of the unemployment grants committee from 1920 to 1932. The committee allocated funds to local authorities for a variety of public works' schemes (mostly in road building), which were required to take on unemployed people. The day-to-day management of the trusts was left to J. S. Austen and Harley Drayton.<br>
<br>In 1927 the split between St Davids and Owen, now Lord Kylsant, became very public when St Davids in his capacity as a trustee of debenture stock sought permission to interview the auditor of Royal Mail about qualifications to the accounts. This was refused and St Davids indicated his intention to resign, with a catastrophic effect on the share price. The disagreement rumbled on through 1928 and 1929 as the Royal Mail Group's problems intensified. In October, with the reconstruction of the group now high on the Treasury's agenda, Kylsant tried to patch up the quarrel. St Davids had refused to meet him for the preceding three years, dealing with him only through his lawyers. After Royal Mail's issue of further debentures in December 1929, St Davids's resignation the following month as a trustee of one of the debenture issues was inevitable. What difference to the outcome of the collapse of the Royal Mail Group in 1931 a settlement of this unedifying family squabble would have made is hard to judge. In a sense all the dispute did was to confirm market rumours of the group's difficulties, and it forced the Treasury, the joint-stock and merchant banks, and a reluctant Bank of England to move more quickly and with greater secrecy than they might otherwise have done to mitigate the repercussions of the largest corporate exposure of the time. Even after the reconstruction had been imposed and his brother effectively ousted, St Davids, as a trustee of the other debenture issue, continued to harass the newly appointed voting trustees led by Sir William McLintock. By now it was obvious that his motive was vindictive rather than in the interest of the debenture holders, whom he was supposed to represent.<br>
<br>St Davids's own business interests were not without their difficulties in the late 1920s and early 1930s. The Court Line was liquidated in 1929 and its assets transferred to the United Baltic Steamship Company; the Buenos Aires and Pacific Railway had to be reconstructed in 1932; and British Portland Cement Manufacturers faced serious competition resulting in a new price and production agreement in 1934. St Davids died at 235 Almoner's House, St James's Court, London, on 28 March 1938, at the age of seventy-seven, leaving only a modest estate of less than &pound;130,000. He was succeeded as second viscount by his surviving son.<br>
