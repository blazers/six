<span class="headword">Williams,  Edward Ellerker</span>  (1793&#150;1822), <span class="occ">friend of Percy Bysshe Shelley</span>, was born on 22 April 1793 in India, the son of Captain John Williams (1741/2&#150;1809) of the 2nd battalion of sepoys in the Bengal army and Jane Dale (1764/5&#150;1798), the second of his four wives. In 1805 Edward was sent to Eton College, where he may have seen Shelley, who was just eight months older but more advanced in his studies. It is perhaps significant that Williams had no memories of the &#145;Shelley baiting&#146; first mentioned by W. H. Merle in 1848  (White, 2.489&#150;93).<br>
<br>Edward soon tired of his studies. Just before his fourteenth birthday in April 1807 he enlisted as a midshipman in the Royal Navy, a career cut short by his father's death at sea in June 1809. Having received a &#145;comfortable settlement&#146; from his father's will and perhaps deterred by his father's fate from further service in the navy, the seventeen-year-old Edward enlisted on 7 June 1810 as a cornet in the eighth light dragoons. He appeared on duty at Cawnpore in January 1812. By March he was serving under his half-brother John (<i>d</i>. 1823), with whom he was on good terms. Transferred in November 1812 to another unit, he was promoted lieutenant on 28 April 1813. In January 1814 he left Cawnpore for Meerut, again serving under his brother. From April to October 1814 he was on local leave, hunting big game and perhaps sightseeing. A talented amateur artist, he made many watercolour sketches of army life and the Indian countryside that have been preserved along with his journals and notebooks. He remained on the lists for his regiment until the end of 1817 and did not officially retire on half pay until 28 May 1818. During his tour of duty he met Shelley's cousin and future biographer Thomas Medwin, serving in India in another regiment. Medwin's biographer considers it probable that both young men participated in the siege of Hathras in February&#150;March 1817  (Lovell, 33).<br>
<br>A handsome young man with a pleasant expression who made friends easily and retained them for life, Williams quickly caught the attention of Jane Johnson, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Cleveland (1798&#150;1884), a slender, dark-haired young woman who had been married at sixteen to Captain John Edward Johnson (<i>c</i>.1789&#150;1840) of the East India Company. Rees speculates that Edward met Jane in England before her husband again sailed to India on 6 May 1817, but it seems more probable that they met in 1818, just before or soon after Williams's retirement from the army. In any case, Jane had no difficulty persuading Williams that Johnson had mistreated her and that she was justified in leaving him, and at some point before Johnson's return to London in September 1818, Williams assumed the place of her &#145;husband&#146;. Concerned that Edward's career would be blighted or destroyed by this irregular union, his stepmother, Mary Ann Williams, bitterly opposed this decision and may have informed Captain Johnson that his wife was planning to elope with her stepson. Although Captain Johnson returned to London in September 1818 and &#145;lurked about town&#146;, he made no move to retrieve his wife, perhaps because, as Rees speculates, he was &#145;in some kind of trouble himself at the time, and unwilling to attract the attention of the law&#146;  (Rees, 40).<br>
<br>Medwin, who returned to London in 1819 full of rekindled enthusiasm for his poet cousin, encouraged the couple to join him in his travels on the continent, where he hoped to encounter Shelley. Their desire to leave England made more urgent by Jane's pregnancy, they sailed to France in July. After a brief stop in Paris, they made a leisurely journey to Geneva, where Medwin had rented a house for the three of them. Their first child, Edward Medwin Williams 
    (Meddy; <i>d</i>. 1897)
   was born on 7 February 1820 and baptized in June with Medwin as godfather. Medwin dedicated his forty-two-page poem &#145;Oswald and Edwin, an Oriental Sketch&#146; to Williams on 10 February. As Lovell notes: &#145;Williams deserved the dedication, for he had supplied notes on a lion hunt for the poem&#146;  (Lovell, 61). Later in the year Williams produced an article on big game hunting for the Swiss encyclopaedia <span class="italic">Bibliot&egrave;que universelle des sciences, belles-lettres, et des arts</span>.<br>
<br>After Medwin's departure in late September, the little family resumed their journey, spending two months in a hotel at Chalon and postponing the voyage to Italy until after Christmas. On 13 January 1821 they again met Medwin, who was staying with the Shelleys in Pisa and soon arranged an introduction. From this time onward the two families lived near each other, at times sharing the same house, often with other guests including Mary Shelley's stepsister Claire Clairmont. Impressed by &#145;Epipsychidion&#146; and other poems, Williams contentedly took Medwin's place as Shelley's constant companion and amanuensis after Medwin again departed on 27 February. Under Shelley's tutelage he completed a play, &#145;The Promise, or, A Year, a Month, and a Day&#146;, which was submitted to Covent Garden but rejected. In October 1821 Williams began a journal, including a summary of the elopement. Among the events recorded is the birth of the Williamses' second child, Jane Rosalind 
    (Dina; <i>d</i>. 1880)
  , born on 16 March and baptized on 30 December with Mary Shelley as godmother.<br>
<br>Introduced by Shelley to Lord Byron on 5 November, Williams quickly became a member of Byron's male-only &#145;Pistol Club&#146; (Williams's phrase), whose members enjoyed riding, dining, and conversing as well as shooting. They were soon joined by Medwin, who returned to Pisa on 14 November, and by Edward John Trelawny, another Shelley admirer, whom Williams had met in Geneva on 14 January 1822.<br>
<br>At this time Mary was frequently depressed and ill and Shelley sought the company of pretty, musical Jane, finding in her a source of inspiration for some of his loveliest lyrics. In January 1822 he bought her a guitar, presented along with a famous poem in which he appears as Ariel to Jane's Miranda and Edward's Ferdinand. This strange triangle in no way decreased Williams's admiration for Shelley or their mutual friendship, celebrated in &#145;The Boat on the Serchio&#146;. Williams aroused Shelley's interest in sailing, and they enlisted Trelawny's help in building a sailboat. The <i>Don Juan</i> arrived on 12 May, and Williams described it in his journal as &#145;a perfect plaything&#146;. Confident in Williams's abilities as a seaman, Shelley retained only one young sailor, eighteen-year-old Charles Vivian, to serve as &#145;crew&#146;.<br>
<br>On 1 July Shelley and Williams sailed for Leghorn to meet Leigh Hunt, belatedly arriving in Italy with his family. Williams, eager to return to Jane, persuaded Shelley to leave Leghorn on 8 July. About 10 miles off the coast of Spezia they encountered a storm and the <i>Don Juan</i> disappeared under the waves.<br>
<br>Desperate for news, Jane and Mary took a carriage to Leghorn. In the meantime three bodies had floated ashore, one of which Trelawny identified as Williams's based on his one remaining boot and a black silk scarf tied sailor-fashion around his neck. The bodies were quickly buried in keeping with quarantine laws, but Trelawny obtained permission for cremation ceremonies. Williams was cremated in Tuscany on 15 August, followed by Shelley in Lucca the next day. The women, who had returned to Pisa, did not attend. In September Jane sailed for England, taking the small casket filled with Edward's ashes with her; those of Shelley were buried in the protestant cemetery in Rome. Jane found a father for her children in Shelley's friend Thomas Jefferson Hogg, living as his wife from April 1827 until his death on 27 August 1862. When Jane died on 8 November 1884, the little casket containing Williams's ashes was buried with her at Kensal Green.<br>
<br>Williams's journal, recovered from the <i>Don Juan</i> barely damaged, is an important supplement to the Shelleys' letters as a record of Shelley's last days. His pencil sketch of Shelley, made at Pisa on 27 November 1821, provides the only good likeness of the poet. But even without these contributions, Williams would deserve his place in Shelley biography as &#145;the most satisfactory friend [the Shelleys] ever had&#146;  (Jones, 13).<br>
