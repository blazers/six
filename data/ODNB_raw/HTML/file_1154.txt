<span class="headword">Baldock,  Ralph</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1313), <span class="occ">administrator and bishop of London</span>, was first recorded in February 1275, when he was admitted as rector of Little Woolstone in Buckinghamshire. In St Paul's he held, probably successively, the prebendal stalls of Holborn and Newington and is also found as prebendary of Islington. He first occurs as archdeacon of Middlesex in June 1278, became dean of St Paul's in 1294, and was elected bishop of London on 23 or 24 February 1304. Three canons, who had been deprived by the archbishop during the vacancy of the see, appealed to the pope to declare the election void owing to their exclusion, but the bishop-elect prevailed, and was consecrated at Lyons on 30 January 1306.<br>
<br>Later that year Baldock was commissioned by Pope Clement V (<i>r</i>. 1305&#150;14) to conduct an inquiry at Hereford into the miracles attributed to Thomas de Cantilupe (<i>d</i>. 1282). At the Carlisle parliament in January 1307 he was sworn a member of the king's council. Edward I promoted him to chancellor in April, but his tenure of this office lasted only until the king's death in July. His presence at the Stamford parliament in August 1309 denotes loyalty to Edward II. Baldock was one of five bishops appointed as <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/50153/', "lords ordainer")</script> in March 1310. In late 1311 he attended the Council of Vienne. He provided for the resumption of theological lectures in his cathedral by appropriating the church of Ealing to the chancellorship of St Paul's, and wrote a history of England, which existed in the sixteenth century but is now lost. The extent of his intellectual interests is shown by the list of 126 <i>libri scolastici</i> made after his death; mostly devoted to theology and canon law, they also include works of natural science, medicine, and history. Baldock's codification of the customs and statutes of St Paul's, made while he was dean, was unparalleled among medieval English cathedral codes for its comprehensiveness and logical arrangement.<br>
<br>St Paul's Cathedral was at this time being rebuilt and enlarged, and its new lady chapel was built by Baldock. He began it while he was still dean, continued it as bishop, bequeathed money for its completion and, after his death at Stepney on 24 July 1313, was buried there, under a handsome monument which was destroyed in the mid-sixteenth century. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1155/', "Master Robert Baldock")</script>, chancellor of England from 1323 to 1326, probably his nephew, was one of the bishop's executors. Robert's brother Richard, described as a king's clerk in 1325, became a canon of Salisbury and York.<br>
