<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Vaughan,  Richard</span>  (<em>c.</em>1553&#150;1607), <span class="occ">bishop of London</span>, was born at Dyffryn, Ll&#375;n, Caernarvonshire, second son of Thomas ap Robert Vaughan (Vychan) and his wife (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Griffin). If, as has been assumed, Vaughan pursued his studies under the auspices of his kinsman <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/935/', "John Aylmer")</script>, future bishop of London, it was without initial financial assistance. It was only as a sizar that on 16 November 1569 he matriculated from St John's College, Cambridge, where his tutor was John Becon. It was presumably as a result of his own efforts that he was admitted a scholar on Lady Margaret's foundation on 6 November 1573. Indeed Vaughan's kinship with Aylmer, whose wife was born Judith King (alias Bures), may date only from 25 June 1581 when Vaughan married Joan Bewers at Great Dunmow, Essex.<br>
<br>Having graduated BA in 1574 and proceeded MA in 1577, Vaughan gave his age as &#145;about&#146; twenty-four when ordained deacon and priest by Aylmer on 21 and 22 December 1577, as a master of arts of Chipping Ongar, Essex. As curate there he received a diocesan preaching licence on 4 January 1578.<br>
<br>Vaughan thus began his career as prot&eacute;g&eacute; of an influential godly family: the patron of the living was the future attorney-general of the court of wards, James Morice, and the incumbent rector Thomas Morice. On 22 April 1578, on Thomas's resignation, Vaughan succeeded to the rectory, resigning when instituted on 24 November 1580 to nearby Little Canfield. On 24 February 1582, only months after his marriage there, Aylmer collated Vaughan vicar of Great Dunmow, which he held in plurality with Little Canfield until January 1591. He then seems to have resigned both livings. On 19 August 1591 he was instituted rector of Moreton, Essex, once again at the presentation of James Morice and a kinsman, John Morice.<br>
<br>Meanwhile Vaughan's route to higher preferment had been smoothed by Aylmer. Collated prebendary of Holborn in St Paul's on 18 November 1583, he was promoted archdeacon of Middlesex on 26 October 1588. Having already proceeded BTh he was granted the degree of DTh in 1589. While no act books survive for his tenure Vaughan appears to have been an active, sympathetic <i>oculus episcopi</i>, contriving to win the confidence of the moderate puritan clergy whom Aylmer was always disposed to harry. In this he resembled John Still, archdeacon of Sudbury, evidently a close friend. Vaughan was granted letters patent for the prebend of Combe IX in Wells, <i>sede vacante</i>, and instituted by Archbishop John Whitgift on 5 February 1593, six days before Still's consecration as bishop of Bath and Wells. Still had presumably requested his appointment.<br>
<br>Sir John Puckering, lord keeper from May 1592, made Vaughan examining chaplain of clerics applying for the crown's ecclesiastical patronage in his gift. Sir John Harington noted with approval that he was &#145;precise&#146; in that office, turning away unsatisfactory candidates, and described Vaughan in his prime as mild, &#145;very prompt and ready in speache, and withall facetious&#146;  (Harington, 2.49). It was perhaps a reference to his Welsh origins, which, indeed, Vaughan never forgot, maintaining a series of Welsh curates in his Essex livings. When William Morgan dedicated his Welsh translation of the <span class="roman">Bible</span> to Elizabeth in 1588, he named Vaughan, &#145;provost of St John's Hospital at Lutterworth&#146;, as one of the six scholars who had given him particular assistance  (Hughes, 85).<br>
<br>Thus by October 1594, perhaps prompted by Robert Devereux, second earl of Essex, Lord Burghley and Robert Cecil were proposing Vaughan for a Welsh bishopric. Whitgift approved his candidacy and urged his selection for Bangor. Probably not yet forty-three, Vaughan was elected on 22 November 1595 and consecrated on 25 January 1596, conscientiously resigning all his preferments in London diocese. Since Bangor was poorly endowed, its bishops traditionally enjoyed other privileges: thus Vaughan was granted the archdeaconry of Anglesey <i>in commendam</i>, his revenues from his predecessor's resignation (the crown therefore claiming no <i>sede vacante</i> profit), and five years to discharge his first fruits. Thereafter his rise was rapid. At Christmas 1596 Essex promised to promote his candidacy for Salisbury and his name was one of three being canvassed in April 1597. He may have refused it for financial reasons, as did others during 1596&#150;7, and in the event he followed Hugh Bellot at Chester, as he had already done at Bangor.<br>
<br>Vaughan's election was confirmed on 4 June 1597 and again he received favourable financial terms: five years to pay his first fruits, the cancellation of sums &#145;behind&#146; for Bangor, and restitution of the temporalities from Bellot's death, fully twelve months earlier. He also held the valuable rectory of Bangor Is-coed, Flintshire, throughout his tenure. In August 1597 he expressed to Robert Cecil his unqualified satisfaction with these arrangements.<br>
<br>During his years at Chester, Vaughan became preoccupied with the suppression of Catholicism, firing off to Cecil a vivid series of letters on the subject. In 1604 he alleged that he had &#145;reclaimed&#146; over 600 recusants in three years, yet his visitation that year revealed more than 3500 known recusants in Lancashire. Although in 1601 he threatened to deprive eight nonconforming ministers for failing to wear the surplice, he did not in the event remove any of them and he stoutly defended his choice of Richard Midgeley as queen's preacher in Lancashire. At the Hampton Court conference in 1604, when Laurence Chaderton obtained a measure of tolerance from James I for the nonconforming Lancashire ministers, Vaughan was instructed not to proceed against them too peremptorily. He probably had no intention of doing so: although during his visitation later that year he dutifully attempted to enforce the new canons, which enshrined the three articles which Whitgift had first promulgated in 1583, he acted with restraint and again no minister was deprived.<br>
<br>Vaughan was translated to London in 1604 and enthroned in St Paul's on 26 December; his selection as successor to the disciplinarian Richard Bancroft is not easy to account for. King James perhaps gambled that an energetic anti-Catholic was more likely in so radical a diocese to win over nonconformist consciences than a man of more conservative stamp. Yet Vaughan arrived at Fulham to discover that James had now become obsessed with the question of clerical conformity and was pressing for the removal of all who refused to accept the new canons. He seems to have played his hand with consummate skill, to the extent that James commended his &#145;industry&#146;. John Chamberlain reported in February 1605 that, while proceeding &#145;slowly&#146;, he had finally silenced &#145;all that continue disobedient&#146;, adding that he was much commended for &#145;gravitie, wisdome, learning, mildnes and temperance, even among that faction&#146; and was held &#145;every way the most sufficient man of that coate&#146;  (McClure, 1.203).<br>
<br>Indeed during 1605 Vaughan sanctioned the deprivation of only two city incumbents, while a mere handful, of whom Stephen Egerton and Anthony Wotton were the most prominent, were suspended. Between April and June, Vaughan also appears, pending his primary visitation, to have tacitly issued an amnesty to those Essex and Hertfordshire clergy who remained under threat as a result of Bancroft's last visitation in 1604. Following his visitation in October only about thirty men were subsequently examined for nonconformist practices and none was deprived as a result. Many radical incumbents, including Thomas Stoughton, vicar of Coggeshall, Essex, escaped further summons altogether. Stoughton's deprivation in 1606 was probably the culmination of earlier high commission proceedings against him and was perhaps sanctioned by Vaughan only with reluctance.<br>
<br>Harington proposed that Vaughan's efficiency was impaired by illness. He grew corpulent &#145;of a sudden&#146; and shortly after reaching London &#145;fell into that drowsie disease of which he after dyed, growing thereby unfit for that place&#146;, which required &#145;a <i>Vigilantius</i>, and not a <i>Dormitantius</i>&#146;  (Harington, 2.50). This is misleading evidence. There can be little doubt that Vaughan's leniency towards nonconformity was dictated by his own abiding sympathies. Richard Rogers recorded that after the discovery of the Gunpowder Plot he restored &#145;the Most Suspended Ministers&#146;  (Knappen, 32). Thus did he apparently attempt to reverse the trend of 1604 by laying stress on the church's anti-Catholic, rather than its conformist, stance. On 30 May 1606 Rogers celebrated eighteen months' freedom in the pulpit with the telling comment &#145;The Bishop my good friend&#146;. Finally he noted the &#145;sorry news&#146; of the death of &#145;our Bp. Vaughan, who &hellip; permitted the godly ministers to live peaceably and enjoy their liberty&#146;  (ibid.). No other prelate of his generation was accorded such an epitaph by a leading nonconformist.<br>
<br>Vaughan died of apoplexy on 30 March 1607 and was buried in Bishop Kemp's chapel in St Paul's with a memorial inscription, destroyed in the great fire of 1666. He was succeeded by Thomas Ravis, a prelate of more authoritarian cast.<br>
<br>Vaughan and his wife, Joan, are credited with three sons and six daughters, of whom Elizabeth, wife of Thomas Mallory, dean of Chester, became mother of the royalist clergyman Thomas Mallory, whilst Dorothy married John Jegon, later bishop of Norwich. Katherine was baptized at Stanford Rivers, Essex, on 29 January 1596, four days after Vaughan's consecration. This circumstance has led to the assumption, which cannot be substantiated, that he was rector there. The brief document which he wrote as bishop of Chester on 19 April 1601, accepted as his will, was no more than a list of assets to be equally divided between his (here unnamed) wife and children. It was not witnessed and named no executor, but on the basis of it letters of administration were granted to his widow on 15 April 1607.<br>
<br>Vaughan published nothing except some early Latin verses and two sermons printed in 1599, but his visitation articles for London, based on three sets by Bancroft, proved the most influential of the Jacobean church. <span class="italic">Vaughanus redivivus</span>, a virtually impenetrable hagiography in Latin by his kinsman <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29515/', "John Williams")</script>, archbishop of York, survives in manuscript  (BL, Harley MS 6495, art.6).<br>
