<span class="headword">Gell,  Anthony</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1583), <span class="occ">law reporter</span>, was the first son of Ralph Gell (<i>c</i>.1491&#150;1564) and his first wife, Godeth, daughter of Nicholas Ashby of Willoughby on the Wolds. The Gell family had owned Hopton Hall near Wirksworth, Derbyshire, for many generations, but Anthony seems to have been the first member to obtain a grant of arms. He became a student at Clement's Inn, and his notes of the lectures given there in 1543&#150;4 by his Derbyshire neighbour Richard Blackwall (<i>d</i>. 1562) are now in Cambridge University Library. Blackwall may well have been his patron. In 1545&#150;6 Gell served as principal of the inn&#151;an office frequently held by a young man, elected by his peers&#151;and was by this time practising as an attorney of the common pleas. The following year he was specially admitted to the Inner Temple, where he was later called to the bar.<br>
<br>Gell's printed and manuscript law books remained in the library at Hopton Hall until the twentieth century, but they have become partly dispersed. They include a copiously annotated copy of the 1537 edition of Fitzherbert's <span class="italic">Natura brevium</span>. Two of the manuscripts contain a unique series of law reports from the common pleas, written in Gell's hand and probably, for the most part, of his own taking. The first, now in the Library of Congress, begins with the year books of 13 Richard II, 18&#150;19 and 26&#150;7 Henry VIII, as in print, and then a series in the same style as the printed year books of Henry VIII running from 1541 to 1555, with a few later additions. The second volume, now in the Derbyshire Record Office, continued the series from 1557 to 1562. Gell seems to have kept these reports to himself, and they were not copied or cited by contemporaries. They include the earliest known reported case on the doctrine of consideration.<br>
<br>Gell became a bencher of the Inner Temple in 1559 but paid 40 marks to be excused from reading in 1563. He died, unmarried, on 29 June 1583, and was buried in Wirksworth church, where there is a bearded effigy in a long gown of flowered damask and an inscription describing him as &#145;sapiens jurisque peritus&#146; (&#145;wise and skilled in the law&#146;). Part of his gains from the law went to found and endow the grammar school and almshouses at Wirksworth. His nephew Thomas (1595&#150;1657) was recorder of Derby and also became a bencher of the Inner Temple. The Gell family remained at Hopton Hall until the 1970s.<br>
