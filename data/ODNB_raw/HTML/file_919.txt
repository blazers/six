<span class="headword">Austin,  William</span>  (1754&#150;1793), <span class="occ">physician</span>, the youngest of the eight children of Isaac Austin, was born at Wotton under Edge, Gloucestershire, on 28 December 1754. Several generations of his family had been clothiers in the town. After receiving a classical education at the local grammar school he was admitted as a commoner of Wadham College, Oxford, in 1773. He began to study Hebrew, and made such good progress that he obtained an exhibition. He approached every task with immense physical and mental energy. It is said that he often walked from Oxford to London in a day, and that he could mow an acre of heavy grass in a single day with just his scythe. He became a scholar at his college, and obtained a second exhibition in botany.<br>
<br>Austin's studies in botany persuaded him to follow medicine as a profession. He did make one digression after graduating BA in 1776; he was elected assistant tutor to Joseph White, Laudian professor of Arabic. After giving some lectures on Arabic, Austin went to London in 1779 and began his medical studies in earnest at St Bartholomew's Hospital. Percivall Pott, the famous surgeon, formed a high opinion of Austin and told his colleague Sir James Earle, &#145;You will see Austin at the head of his profession&#146;. Austin returned to Oxford, and proceeded MA (1780), MB (1782), and MD (1783). One of his many interests was mathematics and in 1781 he published <span class="italic">An Examination of the First Six Books of Euclid's Elements</span>. Later the same year, after he had begun to practise as a physician at Oxford, he lectured on mathematics during the absence of John Smith (<i>d</i>. 1797), the Savilian professor of geometry. In 1784 he planned, but never gave, a course of lectures on physiology, and in 1785 he was elected professor of chemistry. He also became physician to the Radcliffe Infirmary.<br>
<br>In 1786, when a vacancy appeared at St Bartholomew's, Austin was elected physician there and moved to London. He rapidly built up a large private practice, earning more than &pound;4000 a year. He continued his chemical studies and was the first person to give regular chemical lectures in the school at St Bartholomew's. In 1787 he was elected a fellow of the Royal College of Physicians, and in 1790 he delivered the Goulstonian lectures there. Two papers (published in 1788 and 1789), on &#145;Heavy inflammable air&#146;, were read before the Royal Society (<span class="italic">PTRS</span>, 80.51). His Goulstonian lectures were printed as <span class="italic">A Treatise on the Origin and Component Parts of the Stone in the Urinary Bladder</span> (1791). Austin came to the conclusion, later shown to be incorrect,<blockquote>that the stone is formed generally in very small part, and often in no degree whatever, from the urine as secreted by the kidneys, but chiefly from the mucus produced from the sides of the different cavities through which the urine passes.</blockquote>He went on to say that<blockquote>those who suffer this species of the disorder must either bear it for life or submit to a dreadful alternative, to an operation which few surgeons ever acquire the art of performing dexterously, and which, performed even by the most skilful, is by far the most dangerous of any that is practised in surgery.</blockquote>However, Austin was able correctly to identify how hard deposits in the body are composed. He also correctly observed that the hard matter found in old people's arteries is calcareous, whereas the white substance covering the surface of gouty joints is not. His final remark on lithotomy caused his surgical colleague, Sir James Earle, to write a defence of the operation. This states that Austin later revised his pessimistic views on the treatment of kidney stones. Earle showed his remarks to Austin shortly before the latter's death, and he was also the author of the memoir of Austin prefixed to <span class="italic">Practical Observations on the Operation for the Stone</span> (1796).<br>
<br>Austin was married twice, and he left six children, four from his second marriage, to Miss Margaret Alanson. He wrote a number of sermons, but none of these was published. Austin died suddenly in London, on 21 January 1793, of a fever.<br>
