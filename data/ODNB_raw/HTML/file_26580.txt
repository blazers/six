<span class="headword">Stone,  William</span>  (<em>c.</em>1603&#150;1659), <span class="occ">colonial governor</span>, was born in England. Although his parentage is uncertain, his grandfather was Richard Stone of Croston, Lancashire, and an uncle, son of Richard, was Thomas Stone, haberdasher of London and a major figure in the tobacco trade. William arrived on the lower eastern shore of Virginia before 1629, probably to act as his uncle's agent. He established himself quickly, becoming a justice of the Accomack county court (1633&#150;48), sheriff of the county (1634, 1640, 1646), vestryman for the first parish in Accomack in 1635, and burgess for Accomack to the Virginia assembly in 1642. By 1635 he had married Verlinda (<i>d</i>. 1675), daughter of Captain Thomas Graves, one of the early developers of Virginia, and a fellow justice and vestryman as well as neighbour. They had six children together: sons Thomas, John, and Matthew, and daughters Elizabeth, Mary, and Catherine.<br>
<br>In 1648 Cecil Calvert, second Baron Baltimore, the Maryland proprietor, prevailed on Stone to become governor of Maryland. Maryland was still recovering from the ravages of Captain Richard Ingle's raid of early 1645, a ramification of the English civil war. Governor Leonard Calvert had had to flee to Virginia and had not regained control of the colony until the very end of 1646. A few months later he had died, a disastrous event, but one that gave the proprietor an opportunity to obtain a protestant governor, who might be able to stabilize the province.<br>
<br>Stone had some early success. Lord Baltimore, always seeking new settlers and in need of increased protestant leadership, had been negotiating with dissenting congregations on the lower James River in Virginia for them to move to Maryland. Stone helped persuade about fifty families to leave Virginia in 1649 and 1650. To safeguard liberty of conscience in religion, which from the beginning had been policy but not written into a law that might raise eyebrows in England, Baltimore wrote the <span class="roman">Act of Religion</span>, commonly referred to as the <span class="roman">Maryland Act of Toleration</span>. This, under Stone's guidance, the Maryland assembly passed in 1649, just in time to greet the newcomers from Virginia.<br>
<br>Stone's troubles began about 1652, when parliamentary commissioners arrived empowered to enforce parliamentary rule in Virginia, which in the English civil wars had supported the king. The commissioners extended their jurisdiction to Maryland, and insisted that Stone and his council rule in the name of &#145;The Keepers of the Liberties of England&#146;. An outraged Baltimore insisted that at all costs the Maryland government be carried on in his name.<br>
<br>Matters came to a head in 1654, when the parliamentary commissioners dismissed Stone and his council and gave their governmental powers to leaders of the Virginia &eacute;migr&eacute;s, by this time well established in Anne Arundel county. The new government called an assembly from which Catholics were excluded and which denied Catholics the right to hold office. Stone's response was to raise an army, and in March 1655 he and his men appeared at the new centre of government on the Severn River to demand surrender. They suffered an ignominious defeat. The victors executed three of Stone's leaders and he barely escaped the same fate.<br>
<br>In 1657 Baltimore regained his government through skilful political manoeuvrings in England. He did not reappoint Stone as governor, but retained him on the council, where he was active until 9 October 1659. On 3 December he signed his will, which was recorded on 4 January 1660. His estate in personalty, inventoried but not valued, included thirteen servants and two African slaves, while his lands came to more than 5000 acres&#151;a large fortune for the time and place. He died, shortly after signing his will, at his home, Poynton Manor, in Charles county, Maryland.<br>
