<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Philip,  John</span>  (1775&#150;1851), <span class="occ">missionary</span>, was born on 14 April 1775 in Kirkcaldy, Fife, the eldest son of James Philip, a weaver, and his wife, Mary. After leaving school at eleven he worked as a weaver and then moved to Dundee, where he became first a clerk in, and then manager of, a spinning mill. Brought up in the Church of Scotland, he was attracted to the Congregational denomination being established in Scotland by James and Robert Haldane. After a religious conversion Philip left his job at the mill, in protest, he later claimed, against the use of child labour. After a short period as a master weaver, he spent three years at Hoxton College in London, training as a Congregational minister. Thereafter he worked for two years in Newbury before being transferred to Aberdeen in 1804. His first years there were difficult, as the congregation was split between those like Philip who wished to remain as Congregationalists and those who followed the Haldanes into the Baptists. Philip was able to maintain the loyalty of the majority of his congregation and soon gained a reputation as a dynamic preacher. On 24 September 1809 he married Jane Ross (1792&#150;1847), the daughter of a prosperous Aberdeen engineer; they had seven children.<br>
<br>In addition to his pastoral work and preaching, Philip took considerable interest in missions, as secretary of the Aberdeen Missionary Society and as the representative of the London Missionary Society (LMS) in north-east Scotland. In 1813 he preached the annual missionary sermon to the LMS, entitled &#145;The necessity of divine influence&#146;, in which he displayed much more millenarianism than in his later years. He was thus a very suitable candidate for the post of resident director in South Africa, which the LMS directors felt called upon to institute in 1818, as the affairs of the society in Cape Colony were then in crisis. Despite resistance from his Aberdeen congregation, Philip accepted. As a sign of the esteem in which he was held in Congregational circles, doctorates were obtained for him from both Princeton and Columbia universities, as neither English nor Scottish institutions would convey this honour on one who was not a member of their respective established churches. Thus equipped, Philip arrived in Cape Town, together with the Revd John Campbell, in February 1819. Except for three extended visits to Britain, his main residence was Cape Town until 1847, when he retired to Hankey in the eastern Cape. Until well into his sixties, however, he made regular long trips in an ox-waggon through the interior of southern Africa and, together with his extensive correspondence, these made him probably the most widely informed individual on southern Africa of his day.<br>
<br>Philip's work in Africa had three interlocking facets. First, he was minister of the Congregationalist Union Chapel in Cape Town, to which the mission house where he lived was attached. On occasion, particularly in 1841&#150;2, problems arose because members of the congregation believed that they did not have sufficient control over their minister, who was after all imposed by the society rather than called by his church. Moreover, Philip was often away and his replacement was a natural focus for resentment. Secondly, he acted as administrator of the London Missionary Society, which at any one time had up to twenty-five clergymen at work in southern Africa. Much of the practical work was carried out by his wife, who was unofficial treasurer of the society in southern Africa; she took on all administrative tasks during his absences and was the official agent in Cape Town of the Paris Evangelical Mission. Nevertheless, the planning of an evangelical campaign fell to Philip, and it was at his initiative and as part of his strategy that the Paris Evangelical Missionary Society, the Rhenish Missionary Society, and the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions sent missionaries to southern Africa. Thirdly, there were his public and campaigning activities, for which he is best known. These all derived from his vision of missionary activities. For Philip, salvation could only be achieved by those who lived &#145;civilized&#146; lives, very much according to the current norms of Great Britain, and particularly Scotland. Heavily influenced both by the political economists of the Enlightenment in Scotland, and successors such as David Ricardo and Sir William Blackstone, he believed that the colonial system of southern Africa in the early nineteenth century did not allow converts to lead Christian lives.<br>
<br>Philip's first activity, which his opponents construed as political, was on behalf of the beleaguered British settlers in the eastern Cape. This earned him the enmity of Lord Charles Somerset, the governor of Cape Colony. Then, in 1823, Philip was instrumental in persuading the British government to send out the commissioners of eastern inquiry. This commission was to investigate the system of government in all colonies in the east captured during the Napoleonic wars, thus including Mauritius and Ceylon as well as the Cape. In the event the commission spent six years at the Cape, producing a dozen detailed reports on all aspects of government. Philip, however, despaired of the commission ensuring the human rights of, in particular, the Khoi-Khoi, who were the main residents on the LMS mission stations. He therefore went to London in 1827 to campaign.<br>
<br>In the course of his British visit Philip wrote <span class="italic">Researches in South Africa</span>, in which he exposed the various abuses perpetrated in Cape Colony and expounded the benefits of missions. He also made contact with Sir Thomas Fowell Buxton, and convinced him that the struggle for the rights of free Khoi-Khoi people in southern Africa was inseparable from the main emancipation agitation. With this entr&eacute;e into the world of high politics he was able to persuade the colonial secretary, Sir George Murray, to remove all civil disabilities on &#145;free persons of colour&#146; at the Cape, and indeed throughout the British empire. Since, in his absence but probably by his inspiration, the Cape government had in the meantime issued ordinance 50 to this effect, the British government ordered that all future measures which might impinge on the ordinance had to be sanctioned in London. On his return to Africa in 1829 Philip was f&ecirc;ted as a hero by the Khoi-Khoi, but vilified by the settlers and officials. He was convicted of libelling William Mackay, magistrate of Somerset, but his hefty fine was covered by evangelicals in Britain to whom he had become a hero.<br>
<br>From the 1830s Philip was primarily concerned with arranging matters beyond the borders of Cape Colony, both to the north and to the east. As before, his prime concern was to help create the conditions which he saw as necessary for salvation. This entailed that the African polities be reorganized but also that their rulers did not feel that they had been treated unjustly. To that effect Philip arranged that treaties were made between Cape Colony and Andries Waterboer, Adam Kok II and Moshoeshoe, of the Griqua and Sotho to the north. His dealing with the Xhosa to the east were complicated by the outbreak of war with the colony in December 1834, which led to the annexation of a large part of Xhosa. Philip did not oppose this, as he believed that benevolent British rule would be advantageous, provided that the colonial system was organized to allow the progress of &#145;civilization&#146;. It was to ensure this, and to safeguard the civil rights of the free persons of colour within the colony, that he journeyed to Britain in 1835, accompanied by James Read, a veteran missionary who was his closest ally, Read's son, and two converts, Andries Stoeffels, a Khoi-Khoi, and Jan (Dyani) Tshatsoe, a Xhosa chief. The five men gave evidence before Buxton's select committee on Aborigines. It was their evidence and the documents which Philip had sent to the Colonial Office through Buxton that led the British government to order that the conquered territory be returned to the Xhosa. While Philip was not directly responsible for this decision, and indeed may have disapproved of it, he was held to be so by the colonists of the Cape.<br>
<br>Thereafter, Philip's political influence in both London and Cape Town declined, except with regard to the northern frontier. His position within the LMS was increasingly challenged by those, notably Robert Moffat, who disapproved of his political activities and were less prepared to see African converts as their potential equals. Indeed, Philip had to fight to prevent the mission stations being broken up. His final years were saddened by the death of his wife, the drowning of his son and grandson, and, just before his death, the revolt against British rule of many of the Khoisan converts who believed that the implicit contract they had made with Philip, for further benefits beyond the freedom of ordinance 50, had not been honoured. He died on 27 August 1851 at Hankey, a mission station in the eastern Cape, and was buried there.<br>
<br>Philip was a thickset, dark-haired, handsome Scot. His forceful personality made many of those he came across his devoted followers, and more his implacable enemies. His reputation as a meddlesome priest lived on into the twentieth century in southern Africa, but so did an understanding of his belief that society must be organized to allow the living of a Christian life and that duty required him to do what he could to make this possible.<br>
