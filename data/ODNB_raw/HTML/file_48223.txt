<span class="headword">Harford,  Edward</span>  (1837/8&#150;1898), <span class="occ">railwayman and trade unionist</span>, was born in Bristol on 21 March 1837 or 1838, the son of Edward Harford, a policeman. When he was five years old the family moved to Tiverton in Devon and Edward was educated until the age of fourteen at the Tiverton factory school from which he was apprenticed to the confectionery trade. He disliked this employment and after enduring it for five years, transferred to the recently established Devonshire county constabulary. In Hatherleigh, on 26 October 1857, he married Fanny Ann Reed Sanders, a domestic servant; they had five sons and two daughters.<br>
<br>Shortly after this Harford began his railway career as a porter employed by the Bristol and Exeter Railway Company. For nearly twenty years thereafter he was employed in a variety of grades in the goods departments, first of the Midland and then of the Manchester, Sheffield, and Lincolnshire Railways. Harford became a keen trade unionist and on 24 June 1872 represented Grimsby at the first great delegate meeting of the Amalgamated Society of Railway Servants (ASRS), held in London. In 1873 colleagues in the Sheffield area persuaded him to become a full-time, locally paid, organizer. He accepted the proposal, but subscriptions from the branches were so uncertain that for some months he felt obliged to take employment in an iron foundry. However, by 1881 he was again active for the union as joint secretary of the movement for a nine-hour working day.<br>
<br>At that time union organization presented many difficulties. The directors of the railway companies, with the partial exception of the North Eastern Railway, were vehemently opposed to union recognition. Victimization was widespread and it was not until the annual general meeting of October 1889 that delegates decided to give their personal, as well as their branch name, to reporters. In 1882 Harford was appointed by the union's executive as paid national organizer, and in February 1883, when his predecessor, Frederick Evans, had a nervous breakdown and deserted his post, he was chosen as the only person legally qualified to be general secretary. Apart from this, his good organizing abilities and his wide range of experience in railway employment ensured his succession.<br>
<br>Harford's policy after election was to increase the union's membership and hence its bargaining strength. He detested strikes, declaring at a public meeting in Birkenhead on 12 February 1897 that strikes would be a thing of the past as soon as every man was a member of his trade society. He campaigned vigorously for reduced working hours in the belief that overwork was an important cause of the horrendous level of railway accidents. He gave well-prepared evidence to both the royal commission on labour of 1890 and the select committee on railway servants' hours of labour of 1890&#150;91.<br>
<br>Harford played an active role in the establishment of the labour electoral committee in 1886, and served as its treasurer. His union decided in 1892 that it should be represented in parliament through the general secretary, and Harford subsequently stood as a Liberal for Northampton in the general election of 1895, but was defeated because of a split opposition vote. He served on the parliamentary committee of the TUC from 1887 to 1892 (chairman in 1890) and from 1894 to 1897.<br>
<br>By 1898 the union was in a much stronger position than it had been when Harford took over in 1883. Membership had risen from 8077 to 54,426, and reserve funds had grown from &pound;37,000 to nearly &pound;200,000. It was well established in Ireland and strong in the north-east and Scotland, following the merger of the Scottish ASRS with the main body after the defeat of the Scottish rail strike in 1892. Above all it had become an industrial organization, or, as Harford described it, &#145;a trade union with benefit funds, not a friendly society with a few mutual protection benefits&#146;  (Bagwell, 1.149).<br>
<br>In 1897 Harford defied his executive by settling disputes with the boards of the North Eastern Railway and the London and North Western Railway. He was also drunk at an important stage of negotiations. The union dismissed him in October 1897 with a pension of &pound;100 a year. Harford died of pneumonia on board the SS <i>St Paul</i> on 4 January 1898 while returning from a conference in the USA. His funeral took place in Abney Park cemetery in London on 11 January 1898, and was attended by large numbers of railway workers walking beneath their banners. Harford was survived by his wife.<br>
