</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Phillip,  Arthur</span>  (1738&#150;1814), <span class="occ">colonial governor and naval officer</span>, was born in London on 11 October 1738, the second child of Jacob Phillip and his wife, Elizabeth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Breach. Very little is known of his parents. His father was reportedly from Frankfurt, and a language teacher, a claim given some support by his son's becoming proficient in German, French, and Portuguese. His mother was the widow of John Herbert, a seaman in the Royal Navy, whom she had married in 1728 and who had died in 1731. The Phillips were related by marriage to the Everitts, of whom Michael Everitt, a naval captain, was to be an important patron to Arthur Phillip. Also significant in promoting his career were members of the wealthy Duncombe family.<br>
<br>It seems that Phillip was at sea by the time he was nine years old. He was admitted to the school of the Royal Naval Hospital, Greenwich, for the sons of poor seamen on 22 June 1751, whence he was bound into apprenticeship to William Readhead, who hunted whales in the waters about Spitsbergen in the summers of 1754 and 1755 and traded to the Mediterranean in the intervening winter. Later, in New South Wales, Phillip was to write that he had had as fine figs from his Sydney garden &#145;as any I ever tasted in Spain or Portugal&#146;  (Mitchell L., NSW, Mitchell MS C 213, 26 July 1790).<br>
<br>In October 1755, as events were building to the Seven Years' War, Phillip joined the <i>Buckingham</i> under Everitt, as captain's servant. He was present at the infamous battle off Minorca in May 1756, after which he wrote bitterly of the &#145;Cowardice of Admiral Byng&#146;  (Arthur Phillip to Rebecca Phillip, 21 June 1756, TNA: PRO, PRO 30/8/52). When Everitt and Admiral Temple West were recalled to give evidence at Byng's court martial, Phillip transferred to the <i>Princess Louisa</i>. In February 1757 he joined the <i>Neptune</i> as a midshipman under West and Everitt, and in mid-1759 he served on the <i>Aurora</i>.<br>
<br>On 19 February 1760 Phillip rejoined Everitt, this time on the <i>Stirling Castle</i>, which sailed for the West Indies in September. In 1761 the ship cruised about the islands, with Phillip having meanwhile been promoted fourth lieutenant. Early in 1762 he participated in the capture of Martinique, followed by the blockade of Cap Fran&ccedil;ois (Haiti), and the siege of Havana, including the futile attack on El Morro fortress led by Augustus Hervey. After the fall of the city Phillip sailed home in the captured <i>Infanta</i>.<br>
<br>On 19 July 1763 Phillip married Margaret Charlott Denison (1722&#150;1792), a wealthy widow, who was prescient enough to have him sign a marriage contract securing her wealth and property to herself. The couple lived first at Hampton Court and afterwards at Lyndhurst in the New Forest. However, the marriage failed and they formally separated in April 1769; they had no children.<br>
<br>Phillip returned to service briefly in 1770, at the time of the Falklands armament. He was on half pay from 9 July 1771 until January 1775. In 1769 and in 1773&#150;4 he spent a considerable time in France. He may have been trading, for at this time he was able to repay his estranged wife money he had borrowed from her. However, it seems that he also trained as a military engineer, and it is likely that at this point he began his career as a spy, perhaps being recruited by John Duncombe and Robert Shafto.<br>
<br>In 1775, at a time when Portugal was contending with Spain for control of territory in South America, Phillip enlisted in the Portuguese navy, with a rank equivalent to that of post captain. The Admiralty expected that the officers it loaned in this fashion would return with detailed knowledge of coasts, harbours, fortifications, and the dispositions of colonists. Phillip reached Rio de Janeiro in the <i>Bel&eacute;m</i> in April 1775. Having transferred to the <i>Pilar</i>, in 1775&#150;6 he patrolled the southern coast of Brazil and in the River Plate estuary. The comparatively small Portuguese squadron was no match for the much larger Spanish one that captured Santa Catarina in early 1777, and they did not engage. However, in April Phillip and a colleague captured a new Spanish battleship, the command of which the viceroy gave to Phillip.<br>
<br>Phillip returned to England late in 1778, when he rejoined the navy and served as first lieutenant of the <i>Alexander</i>. He was promoted master and commander on 2 September 1779. On 30 October 1781 he was made post captain of the frigate <i>Ariadne</i> and sent to the Elbe to collect a contingent of Hanoverian soldiers. At the very end of 1782 he was appointed captain of the <i>Europe</i> (64 guns), intended for a secret expedition against the Spanish settlements in South America. However, a storm shattered the squadron in the Bay of Biscay, and, following contingent orders, he sailed on to India alone.<br>
<br>Phillip returned to England in 1784. In 1785 and 1786 he again spied on naval preparations in French ports. Then, in September 1786, he accepted appointment as the governor of the convict colony planned for Botany Bay, on the east coast of New South Wales. He had a major hand in the organization of the expedition which was elaborately and expensively equipped. He took the fleet of eleven ships (afterwards called the first fleet) out from Portsmouth on 13 May 1787. In addition to the crews, aboard were a small group of civil officers, some 240 marines (with a few wives and children), and some 760 convicts, 180 of them women. There were supplies for two years. Sailing via Rio de Janeiro and the Cape of Good Hope, the ships reached Botany Bay towards the end of January 1788. The voyage was notable for its excellent health and disciplinary record. Preferring Port Jackson, some 12 miles to the north, Phillip began the European settlement of Australia at Sydney Cove on 26 January.<br>
<br>In the early days fewer than a third of the convicts showed themselves willing to work. The marine officers stood on their honour, refused to supervise the convicts, and quarrelled among themselves, while their men became lawless. As the presence of a large group of Europeans strained indigenous food supplies, relations with the Aborigines deteriorated. The long drought from mid-1790 to the spring of 1791 and the loss of the <i>Guardian</i> (bringing agricultural supervisors, skilled convicts, plants, animals, and more supplies) retarded the colony's progress.<br>
<br>Phillip showed considerable ingenuity in managing people and events. He made particular groups responsible for their own food supplies, and in 1790 sent some hundreds of the colonists to the lush Norfolk Island. Holding out inducements of freedom and land, he gave the convicts a stake in the emergent society, where from the first law functioned significantly differently from in England. Notwithstanding a failed punitive expedition against the Aborigines in December 1790, Phillip's rule was marked by an unusual egalitarianism and humanity. He encountered many difficulties, but, by the time ill health and family concerns forced him to leave at the end of 1792, it was clear that the colony would survive.<br>
<br>Phillip reached England again in May 1793, and spent time recuperating at Bath. His estranged wife having died the previous year, on 8 May 1794 he married Isabella Whitehead (<i>bap</i>. 1751, <i>d</i>. 1823), the daughter of a wealthy cloth manufacturer. The couple had no children. In March 1796 Phillip returned to active service, as captain of the <i>Alexander</i>. In October he assumed command of the <i>Swiftsure</i>, in which he helped escort a convoy to Gibraltar, thus coming under the command of the earl of St Vincent and Lord Nelson. In September 1797 St Vincent appointed him to the <i>Blenheim</i> (90 guns) and sent him to Lisbon in the expectation that he would become commodore of a joint Anglo-Portuguese squadron. But Phillip lost his command when Admiral Frederick installed his own flag captain. It was the severest disappointment of his career.<br>
<br>Phillip was appointed commander of the Hampshire sea fencibles (a maritime militia) in 1798, and in 1803 he became inspector of the whole force and also of the impress service. The Admiralty terminated these appointments in December 1804 and February 1805, when old age and continuing disappointment were clouding his judgement. By seniority, he rose progressively through the ranks of rear-admiral (1 January 1801) and vice-admiral (25 October 1809) and was promoted admiral of the blue on 4 June 1814. In 1806 he and his wife had settled in Bath. He suffered a debilitating stroke on 20 February 1808 and he died on 31 August 1814 at his home, 19 Bennett Street, Bath. He was buried on 7 September in the church of St Nicholas at Bathampton.<br>
<br>Arthur Phillip had an extraordinary life. As one of his friends remarked, he &#145;had doubled every Cape, had navigated every sea, had been tossed by the severest hurricanes&#146;  (Mackaness, 424). He was evidently a small man, and by middle age the hardships of life at sea had shrivelled his body. The viceroy of Brazil described him as &#145;a little headstrong&#146;, but remarked also that he came quickly to reason, and that he was honest, forthright, and brave  (Archivo Historico Ultramarino (Lisbon), Rio de Janeiro, caixa 109, item 53, caixa 115, item 9). Phillip needed all the latter qualities, and more, in New South Wales, where he faced myriad problems in establishing the colony. He always understood that the colony was to be something more than a dumping ground for convicts. Envisaging European commercial expansion in the Pacific Ocean and about the Pacific rim, he told his patron the marquess of Lansdowne that in Sydney's matchless harbour &#145;a Thousand Sail of the Line may ride in the most perfect Security&#146;; and he told Sir Charles Middleton &#145;that hereafter, when this Colony is the seat of Empire, there is room for ships of all Nations&#146;  (private information). He was not a great person, perhaps; however, he did great work in New South Wales, and gave the new society features it retains still.<br>
