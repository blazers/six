<span class="headword">Johnston, Sir  Charles Hepburn</span>  (1912&#150;1986), <span class="occ">diplomatist and writer</span>, was born on 11 March 1912 in Hampstead, London, the eldest in the family of four sons and two daughters of Ernest Johnston, an underwriter at Lloyd's, and his wife, Emma Florence Hepburn. (The family later moved to a larger house in Reigate, Surrey.) Studious and competitive, he won scholarships to Winchester College and then to Balliol College, Oxford, where at first he was lonely and unhappy. He took first classes in both classical honour moderations (1932) and <i>literae humaniores</i> (1934) and taught for a term at his old school before choosing the diplomatic service, which he entered at the second attempt (1936).<br>
<br>For twenty years Johnston's career followed a conventional course, except that in Tokyo he and the rest of the embassy staff were interned for several months when Japan entered the war. Later, as first secretary in Cairo, he tried but was not allowed to transfer to the armed forces; he felt this keenly, especially after his brother Duncan was killed in action. He became first secretary in Madrid (1948), and counsellor at the Foreign Office (1951) and the embassy in Bonn (1955).<br>
<br>In 1956, aged only forty-four, Johnston was picked to be ambassador to Jordan. His first task was to wind up the outdated Anglo-Jordan treaty, which he accomplished with skill and tact (1957). A year later, when King Hussein's position was threatened, it was his advocacy, backed by the prime minister, Harold Macmillan, which overcame the doubts felt elsewhere in London and led to the brief but successful deployment of British troops to Jordan. He was appointed KCMG in 1959. These events are described in his book <span class="italic">The Brink of Jordan</span> (1972), for which Macmillan wrote a preface awarding him &#145;a secure place in the list of great envoys who have represented Britain overseas&#146;.<br>
<br>Johnston's next appointment, unusual for a non-member of the colonial service, was as (the last) governor of Aden. He worked to merge the colony of Aden with the Federation of South Arabia, promoting constitutional advance but keeping the British military base. So long as he was there (1960&#150;63) this line was maintained, with some difficulty but on the whole with success, as he related in <span class="italic">The View from Steamer Point</span> (1964).<br>
<br>After Aden, Johnston might have risen higher but for Labour's victory in the general election of 1964. As it was, the top posts to which he aspired went to others, and those offered to him did not match his own estimate of his abilities. Finally, in 1965 he agreed to go as high commissioner to Australia, where he was more effective and more popular than many had expected. He continued to reject offers of other posts and retired with a GCMG in 1971, a year earlier than normal, with the idea of entering politics.<br>
<br>Johnston's last years brought some disappointments. He was judged too old to stand for the House of Commons. A peerage was mentioned but not offered. A company chairmanship lapsed when the plan to build an airport in the Thames estuary was dropped. Despite his hopes he became neither chairman of the BBC nor poet laureate. A book of reminiscences built round the character of his long-serving Egyptian butler, <span class="italic">Mo and other Originals</span> (1971), had a brief success, but his other prose and poetry found little market outside magazines.<br>
<br>Two things consoled Johnston: his social work at Toynbee Hall, for which he showed an unexpected talent; and the world opened to him by his marriage. In Cairo he had met Princess Natasha Bagration, daughter of Prince Konstantin Bagration-Mukhransky and of Princess Tatyana Konstantinovna, descended respectively from the royal house of Georgia and from Tsar Nicholas I of Russia. They were married in London in 1944. Though childless, it was a strange but successful union until her death in 1984 after several years of intermittent illness. Arrestingly tall, possessed of magnetic charm, and connected with royal families all over Europe, she vastly enlarged his mental and especially social horizons. From their flat in Knightsbridge they continued, almost to the last, to sustain their parts in the social round which he called &#145;the Belgraveyard&#146;.<br>
<br>In collaboration with his wife Johnston had produced in 1948 what is perhaps still the best English translation of Turgenev's <span class="italic">Sportsman's Notebook</span>. But his masterpiece is his rendering of <span class="italic">Eugene Onegin</span> into English verse preserving Pushkin's metre and rhyme scheme (1977). This received unqualified critical acclaim. His success as a translator did not help, and perhaps even hindered, the fortunes of his other work, though he continued to write, print, publish, and circulate it to his friends, convinced that posterity would be kinder. <span class="italic">Poems and Journeys</span> (1979) contains much of his best work.<br>
<br>Johnston developed a boisterous manner for social purposes, but remained shy and reserved at heart. The strong emotions reflected in his poetry, together with his deep vein of self-doubt, were well concealed. Physically tall, energetic but somewhat awkward, he was a good sailor and a keen shot. He managed his savings astutely and generously, and was a good judge of a painting. He died in his sleep on 23 April 1986 at his home in London, 32 Kingston House, South Ennismore Gardens.<br>
