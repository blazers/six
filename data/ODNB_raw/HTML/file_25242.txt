<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Sharples,  Rolinda</span>  (1793&#150;1838), <span class="occ">portrait and genre painter</span>, was born on 3 September 1793, probably in Bath, the second child and only daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25240/', "James Sharples (1751/2&#150;1811)")</script> and of his third wife, <a name="cosubject_63674"></a><span class="headword">Ellen Sharples <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Wallace]</span></span>  (1769&#150;1849). Both Rolinda's parents were professional artists, James being a very talented if not outstanding painter of portraits in pastel. Rolinda's half-brother Felix Sharples (1786&#150;<i>c</i>.1832) and her brother James (<i>c</i>.1788&#150;1839) also became professional artists. Together with his family, James Sharples senior took his portrait practice to the United States, setting out in 1793 but being delayed by seven months' internment in Brest, after being captured by a French privateer. James Sharples drew many of the most prominent Americans, including George Washington, before the family returned to Bath in 1801. They all set out again from Bristol in 1806, but this time their vessel ran aground on the muddy banks of the Avon. Felix and James junior continued to the United States but their parents and Rolinda remained in Bristol until 1809. In February 1811 her father died in New York and in June, Ellen, James junior, and Rolinda returned to Bristol. Before her marriage about 1787 Ellen had been a pupil of James Sharples, learning drawing &#145;as an ornamental art for amusement&#146; as she later wrote in her diary  (Ellen Sharples's diary, summary of events, May 1806&#150;Jan 1808). However, she made many excellent and indistinguishable copies of her husband's pastels and a small number of original portraits. Now, settled in the elegant and fast-expanding village of Clifton (then just outside Bristol), she devoted herself principally to her daughter's education and career.<br>
<br>Rolinda first decided to be a professional artist at the age of thirteen. She initially concentrated on portrait painting, mostly in oil and often of her Clifton acquaintances. Many of her friends were depicted in her first major work, <span class="italic">The Cloak Room, Clifton Assembly Rooms</span>, completed in 1818 (Bristol Museum and Art Gallery). This charming picture of Bristol's social scene has aptly illustrated the corus of more than one novel by Jane Austen. The perspective and scale are uncertain and the poles are contrived and a little stiff, for the observation of the thirty-one gentlefolk there depicted is acute, friendly, and even witty. Rolinda depicted an event at which she would have been at ease. Much larger and more ambitious scenes of Bristol life followed: <span class="italic">The Market</span> and <span class="italic">Rownham Ferry</span> (Sothebys, 15 July 1992, lot 15) were shown at the Royal Academy in 1820 and 1822, respectively, and <span class="italic">St James's Fair</span> (priv. coll.) and <span class="italic">The Stoppage of the Bank</span> (Bristol Museum and Art Gallery) were exhibited at the Society of British Artists in 1825 and 1827. The subject of the last painting had been suggested by the failure of a Bristol bank in 1822 and was chosen by Rolinda because it was &#145;well suited to a great variety of expression&#146;  (diaries of Ellen and Rolinda Sharples, &#145;Reminiscences&#146;). The artist's apparently uncritical detachment from the human tragedies she was depicting is still more apparent in <span class="italic">The Trial of Colonel Brereton</span> (1832&#150;4; Bristol Museum and Art Gallery). Brereton was tried for negligence in the handling of the Bristol riots of October 1831. After only two days of the trial, which Rolinda attended, he committed suicide. While the artist's diary suggests a genuine sympathy for &#145;the poor and much pitied Col. Brereton&#146;  (Rolinda Sharples's diary, 1832), the printing is a laborious social almanac including over a hundred portraits, many of persons who did not even attend the trial. More successful was her last large Bristol scene, <span class="italic">Clifton Race Course</span> (Bristol Museum and Art Gallery), completed in 1836. Rolinda died of breast cancer on 10 February 1838 at 3 St Vincent Parade, Holwells, Bristol, whither she and her mother had moved from 2 Lower Harley Place, Clifton, in 1831. She was buried in St Andrew's churchyard, Clifton. Her mother gave &pound;2000 to the nascent Bristol Academy of Fine Arts, and bequeathed to it a further &pound;3465 and her large collection of works by members of her family on her death in 1849. Today she is acknowledged as the founder of what is now the Royal West of England Academy.<br>
<br>Rolinda Sharples was born into a family of professional artists with a modest income from property and capital investments. She had little social contact with her fellow Bristol artists perhaps as much because of her social status as her gender. Her formal training was limited to a series of lessons from Philip Reinagle in London in 1814 and 1820. The principal influences upon her work, however, were the paintings of the Bristol artist Edward Bird RA (1772&#150;1819). Her genre or narrative paintings, most notably <span class="italic">The Stoppage of the Bank</span>, are also closely comparable to other works of the 1820s by Bristol artists such as E. V. Rippingille (1798&#150;1859) and Samuel Colman (1780&#150;1845) and she was undoubtedly a significant member of the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/95531', "Bristol school of artists")</script>.<br>
