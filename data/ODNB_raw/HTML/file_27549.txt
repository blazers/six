<span class="headword">Tooker,  William</span>  (1553/4&#150;1621), <span class="occ">dean of Lichfield and author</span>, was born in Exeter, the second son of William Tooker and Honora Erisey. He received his early education at Winchester College, and proceeded to Oxford, where his matriculation from New College aged eighteen, was entered under the year 1572. He was elected a scholar of New College in 1575 and was a full fellow from 1577 to 1585. On 16 October 1579 he graduated BA, and he incepted MA in 1583. He was admitted BTh and licensed DTh on 4 July 1594.<br>
<br>From 1580 Tooker was a canon of Exeter Cathedral. He was installed as rector of St James-the-Great, Kilkhampton, Cornwall, in 1584. The following year he resigned his fellowship at New College and took up the position of archdeacon of Barnstaple in Exeter diocese. In 1588 he was made rector of St Andrew's, West Dean, Wiltshire, a position he held until his death. In the same year he was appointed one of the chaplains royal, and probably was also collated prebendary of Salisbury Cathedral. In 1590 Tooker was appointed rector of St Peter's, Clovelly, Devon, a position he held until 1601.<br>
<br>A loyal supporter of the monarchy, Tooker compiled a Latin refutation of the excommunication of Elizabeth I by Pope Pius V, <span class="italic">Charisma, sive, Donum sanationis</span> (1597). In a historical overview from the times of Edward the Confessor to his own age he advocated that English monarchs were endowed with the same gift of kingship that the rulers of biblical times had received. This &#145;they have accepted directly from God, and have been using from the times of the early Christians&#146; (&#145;immidiate &hellip; ab ipso Deo acceperunt, &amp; a primo christianitatis tempore &hellip; exercuerunt&#146;; Tooker, <span class="italic">Charisma</span>, sig. M 3<i>r</i>).<br>
<br>In an age that saw regular debates on whether the Church of England should be remodelled on presbyterian principles Tooker was a firm defender of the establishment of the church, a subject he addressed at length in his <span class="italic">Of the Fabrique of the Church and Church-Mens Livings</span> (1604). Advocating that the good estate of the established church depended on the well-being of the state, he emphasized that &#145;Parity in the Church once established in the governement Ecclesiasticall, will draw on paritie in the politicall and civill estate&#146;  (Tooker, <span class="italic">Fabrique</span>, sig. A 3<i>r</i>). Indeed, clergy derived the necessary freedom to exercise their ministry directly from the monarch: &#145;onely the Prince giveth them publique liberty, without let or disturbance, to doe that which Christ hath commanded&#146;  (ibid., sig. H 4<i>r</i>).<br>
<br>In a later publication against the German Jesuit Martin Beck (Becanus), <span class="italic">Duellum, sive, Singularis certamen cum Martino Becano Jesuita</span> (1611), he reiterated his strong belief that, although the monarch was the rightful governor of the church, he made no claims to be a spiritual leader of the church:<blockquote>
<div>God did not bestow ecclesiastical rights on king or emperor. Though a number of church members are subjects of the monarch, the king does not stand above the sacraments, or the Word, or above the spiritual gifts of the church. Therefore he can only ever be her supreme governor.<br>
</div>
<div> 
<br>
</div>
<div>(Res ecclesiae Deo dandae sunt, non caesari vel Regi: partes vero Ecclesiae sunt homines &hellip; qui sunt regis; &hellip; rex non est supra sacramenta, et verbum, nec super Ecclesiae spiritualia charismata, et tamen supremus est in Ecclesia gubernator.)<br>
</div> (Tooker, <span class="italic">Duellum</span>, 23)</blockquote>In recognition of his loyalty to the monarchy Tooker was made dean of Lichfield Cathedral in February 1605. Nine months later, on 25 November 1605, he resigned his archdeaconry. He died at Salisbury on 19 March 1621, and was buried in Salisbury Cathedral on 21 March. He was survived by his son Robert.<br>
