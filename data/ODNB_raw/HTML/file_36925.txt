</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Williams,  John Carvell</span>  (1821&#150;1907), <span class="occ">nonconformist political organizer</span>, was born on 20 September 1821 at Trafalgar Square, Stepney, London, the eldest of the six children of John Allen Williams (<i>d</i>. 1835), port surveyor for HM customs and excise, and his wife, Mary (<i>d</i>. 1881), daughter of John Carvell of Lambeth. It is indicative of the social pressures on nonconformists which Williams devoted his life to combating that although his parents were Congregationalists he was baptized on 8 August 1824 at the parish church of St Dunstan. Eight months earlier his parents had joined the Stepney meeting where Joseph Fletcher ministered. Williams's formal education was confined to the schools associated with this chapel. When he was thirteen years old his father died and his school days abruptly ended. Finding a place in a firm of proctors in Doctors' Commons, he continued there for thirteen years, eventually securing a managing clerkship while gaining an extensive knowledge of ecclesiastical law. Williams's political consciousness was sharpened in 1841 when a copy of Fletcher's sermon on the birth of the prince of Wales was returned by the court because its author was a dissenter. When the nonconformist community as a whole was aroused by the education clauses in Sir James Graham's <span class="roman">Factory Bill</span> (1843), a local committee was formed to agitate against this measure and Williams became one of its secretaries, continuing in this capacity when it became the East London Religious Liberty Society.<br>
<br>This first position as an organizer of pressure-group politics was short-lived. Williams attended the founding conference of Edward Miall's British Anti-State Church Association in 1844 and the East London Society dissolved itself in deference to this national effort. Several years later the association resolved to hire a full-time secretary and Williams was eventually chosen, beginning what would become his life's work in August 1847. His future father-in-law, Richard Goodman, a timber merchant from Hornsey, London, predicted when Williams accepted the secretaryship of the young, militant association that within twelve months he would be &#145;clapped into jail&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Liberator</span>, August 1906, 120). This prophecy proved false and on 14 August 1849 he married Goodman's daughter Anne (1814/15&#150;1902). The couple had five children, but only their second, Sidney, survived into adulthood. They lived at 17 Stonefield Street, Islington, London, and worshipped at nearby Claremont Chapel. Their minister therefore was, ironically, John Blackburn, a prominent Congregationalist who had denounced the association at its birth. Williams was appointed to the chapel's management committee and he was never long thereafter without some position in the succession of churches which he joined. In 1857 Williams and his family moved to St Leonard's Road, Surbiton, Surrey, and he soon became a deacon at Surbiton Park Chapel.<br>
<br>In 1848 Williams became a member of the executive committee of the association which, after a name change in 1853, was commonly known as the Liberation Society. Williams had repeatedly publicized the association's views by writing to <span class="italic">The Nonconformist</span> and by July 1855 the society was ready to launch its own journal, <span class="italic">The Liberator</span>. Williams became its editor and wrote many of the articles himself. To his friends Williams preferred to be known by his second name; he likewise signed his letters for publication &#145;J. Carvell Williams&#146; and was referred to in <span class="italic">The Liberator</span> as &#145;Mr Carvell Williams&#146;. His duties and power expanded along with the society's work and by the end of 1863 he was considered its chief of staff.<br>
<br>As the person responsible for the day-to-day running of the society, Williams deserves to share a portion of the credit for the achievement of some of its goals, such as the abolition of compulsory church rates (1868). The grievance, however, which Williams personally laboured most to alleviate was religious inequalities in the burial laws. This issue was addressed piecemeal by parliament and Williams's efforts can be tracked over half a century, from his letter criticizing the <span class="roman">Metropolitan Interments Bill</span> (1850) to his support for the <span class="roman">Burial Grounds Act</span> (1900). He was the chief promoter of the <span class="roman">Burials Bill</span> carried by George Osborne Morgan in 1880. More of his publications were dedicated to this grievance than to any other issue, notably <span class="italic">A Plea for a Free Churchyard</span> (1870) and <span class="italic">The New Position of the Burials Question</span> (1878).<br>
<br>In September 1867 Williams toured Ireland and helped to secure Roman Catholic support for the society's preferred solution to Irish ecclesiastical tensions: the disendowment of all religious parties and disestablishment. His most significant impact outside England, however, was in Wales. Williams had been one of the society's representatives on the tour in 1862 which sought to awaken dissenters to their political potential and thereby helped to produce a harvest of Welsh nonconformist MPs in the decades which followed. He was the co-author with Henry Richard of the volume entitled <span class="italic">Disestablishment</span> (1885) which appeared in Sydney Buxton's <span class="roman">Imperial Parliament</span> series of political handbooks. Williams also supported other pressure-group organizations. His loyal service to the dissenting deputies went so far toward erasing the memory of the days when that body considered the Liberation Society an upstart that its obituary tribute claimed that he deserved the title &#145;Father of the Deputies&#146;  (Guildhall Library, MS 3083/16, 35&#150;6).<br>
<br>During the 1880s Williams became increasingly involved in Liberal Party politics. He joined the National Liberal Club at its founding in 1883 and by 1889 he had become president of the Hornsey Liberal and Radical Association. In 1884 he was chosen as a parliamentary candidate by Chester Liberal Association, but this constituency's loss of a seat under the <span class="roman">Redistribution Act</span> thwarted this opportunity. In the following year, however, he was adopted as a candidate for South Nottingham and was successful in the 1885 election. Although this parliament lasted less than a year, Williams's bill for extending the hours for the solemnization of marriages successfully reached the statute books. His pro-home rule stance displeased some of his erstwhile supporters, however, and he lost the 1886 election. In 1889 he was chosen as a candidate for the Mansfield division of Nottinghamshire, winning this seat in the 1892 election. He was re-elected in 1895, but chose not to stand again in 1900. His parliamentary career reflected his long-term interest in churchyard grievances: he served on a select committee to investigate the burial laws (1897&#150;8) and twice introduced a private member's bill on this subject.<br>
<br>In 1882 Williams and his family moved to 28 Crescent Road, Hornsey, and a decade later to 21 Hornsey Rise Gardens. They had been members at Park Chapel since 1872 and this association continued, although Williams also helped to establish a daughter church at Stroud Green, Essex. His national achievements and dedicated service to his denomination were crowned by his being elected chairman of the Congregational Union for 1900. This was the highest honour English Congregationalism had to offer and only the third time it had been given to a layman.<br>
<br>Williams outlived all the prominent founders of the Liberation Society and doggedly held onto power well into the Edwardian age. The octogenarian leader finally agreed to resign as the society's chief of staff in June 1906, merrily noting at his retirement dinner that his deafness forced him merely to imagine the content of the congratulatory addresses given by speakers such as David Lloyd George MP. Deaf, blind, and elderly, he died at his son's home, 26 Crouch Hall Lane, Crouch End, Hornsey, on 8 October 1907, the immediate cause probably being congestive cardiac failure. His remains were interred on 12 October at Abney Park cemetery, Stoke Newington, London.<br>
