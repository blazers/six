<span class="headword">Bampfylde,  Coplestone Warre</span>  (1720&#150;1791), <span class="occ">landscape painter and garden designer</span>, was born on 28 February 1720 at Hestercombe House, Kingston, Taunton, great-grandson of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1257/', "Sir Coplestone Bampfylde (1637/8&#150;1692)")</script> and the eldest of nine children of John Bampfylde (1691&#150;1750), MP for Exeter and Devon, and his second wife, Margaret (1694&#150;1758), only daughter of Sir Francis Warre of Hestercombe and his second wife, Margaret, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Harbin. Bampfylde was educated at Kingston and then Tiverton before attending Winchester College from 1731 to 1738. He matriculated at St John's College, Oxford, on 27 February 1738 but did not graduate. Bampfylde's earliest recorded painting is a life-size equestrian self-portrait dated 1746 (exh. Lane Fine Art, London, 1995) jointly painted with Richard Phelps of Porlock, a student of Thomas Hudson. An etching by Bampfylde of a pollarded tree is dated 1749 (exh. Christies, 1995) and his earliest dated watercolour is a view of Exeter (1750; Royal Albert Museum, Exeter).<br>
<br>Bampfylde's early pictures show the influence of George Lambert, whose paintings of Plymouth were redrawn by Bampfylde, engraved by James Mason and P. C. Canot, and published by Lambert in 1755 as <span class="italic">Views at Mount Edgcumbe</span>. In the same year he married Mary Knight (<i>d</i>. 1806) of Wolverley, near Kidderminster, by special licence; there were no children. The poet William Shenstone wrote in 1758 to the writer Richard Graves (1715&#150;1804), &#145;Perhaps you may have heard of Mr Bampfylde who is very much at Bath, is there now with his lady, or has left the place but lately and whose fortune, person, figure and accomplishments can hardly leave him unnoticed in any place where he resides&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters</span>, 481&#150;2). In 1776 Bampfylde provided humorous illustrations for <span class="italic">An Election Ball</span> by his friend Christopher Anstey, author of <span class="italic">The New Bath Guide</span>. In 1776 Anstey published an <span class="italic">Epistola poetica familiaris</span> addressed by him to Bampfylde, in which were included Bampfylde's <span class="italic">An Election Ball</span> illustrations engraved by W. Hibbart. For various reasons the full set of illustrations was not finally printed in <span class="italic">An Election Ball</span> until the fifth edition in 1787. Bampfylde drew the frontispieces for <span class="italic">Columella, or, The Distressed Anchoret</span> (1779), which features the cascade at Hestercombe, and <span class="italic">Eugenius, or, Anecdotes of the Golden Vale</span> (1785), both by Richard Graves. He also designed the elaborate title cartouche for <span class="italic">Map of Somerset</span> by William Day and Charles Harcourt Masters (1782). In 1791, the year of his death, Bampfylde provided an illustration of Hestercombe for John Collinson's <span class="italic">History and Antiquities of Somerset</span> (1791), a view of Taunton Castle for Joshua Toulmin's <span class="italic">History of the Town of Taunton</span> (1791), and an aquatint of Oakhampton Castle, Devon, which was published by W. Hibbart.<br>
<br>Bampfylde made several painting tours including Hampshire (1765, 1770), the Peak District (1766, 1780), and the Lake District (1780). He exhibited at the Society of Artists in 1763 and 1766, the Free Society in 1783, and the Royal Academy, as an honorary exhibitor in 1771, 1772, 1774, and 1783. Many of Bampfylde's oil paintings are of idealized classical landscapes influenced by Salvator Rosa, whereas his watercolours encompass Italianate capriccios to extremely fine topographical views. Two watercolours of Stourhead (Stourhead House, Wiltshire) were engraved by F. Vivares (1777) and his painting <span class="italic">The Storm</span> (exh. RA, 1774) was engraved by P. P. Benazech and published in 1779.<br>
<br>Bampfylde had inherited Hestercombe in 1750 and started what was to become his most important achievement&#151;the creation of a magnificent landscape garden. Much had already been achieved by 1761 when it was first recorded by his brother-in-law Edward Knight. Bampfylde continued adding to the garden throughout his life and in 1786 erected an urn to the sacred memory of his lifelong friends Henry Hoare of Stourhead and his neighbour Sir Charles Kemes Tynte of Halswell, both of whom also created landscape gardens. Water features are an important component of the design of Bampfylde's garden at Hestercombe, where he constructed the great cascade after 1762. He also designed the cascade at Stourhead (1765) and a penstock sluice for George III at Virginia Water (1788). A competent amateur architect, he submitted plans for the new Wardour Castle, Wiltshire, in 1770, and in 1772 he designed the Market House, Taunton, which still dominates the centre of the town. Bampfylde was commissioned in 1758 as major in the 1st Somerset militia, and became its colonel on 27 August 1767. He was still active in the militia as late as 1779 when he was recalled with his men to Plymouth as the French and Spanish fleets lay off the Lizard. Bampfylde died on 23 August 1791 at four o'clock in the morning, and was buried on 30 August at St Mary's Church, Kingston, in the Warre family tomb, where he was commemorated by a fine wall plaque erected by his nephew and heir, John Tyndale Warre.<br>
