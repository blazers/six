<span class="headword">Thomson,  John</span>  (1778&#150;1840), <span class="occ">landscape painter</span>, was the fourth son of Thomas Thomson (<i>d</i>. 1799), minister of Dailly, Ayrshire, and his second wife, Mary (1746&#150;1822), daughter of Francis Hay. Born in his father's manse on 1 September 1778, he was educated at the parish school. He attended Glasgow University in 1791&#150;2, studying for the ministry, the chosen profession of his grandfather and great-grandfather as well as his own father. In November 1793 Thomson moved to Edinburgh University, following his elder brothers, Thomas (1768&#150;1852), who was training in the city for the bar, and Adam (<i>b</i>. 1776), who was working at the banking house of Sir William Forbes. John and Thomas in particular were supported through the patronage of Lady Hailes, a former parishioner of their father's, and spent much time at New Hailes, near Musselburgh. There, the young men were introduced to such rising stars of Edinburgh life as Francis Jeffrey and Walter Scott (then young advocates). During the vacations from his studies at Edinburgh University, Thomson sketched from nature in the wooded countryside around his native Dailly. During his last session at Edinburgh (1798&#150;9), he enrolled for the landscape drawing classes offered by Alexander Nasmyth.<br>
<br>Thomson was licensed by the presbytery at Ayr on 17 July 1799. His father had died a few months earlier, on 19 February 1799, and the son was presented by George III with the parish of Dailly. He was ordained, still aged only twenty-one, on 24 April 1800. On 7 July 1801 he married Isabella, daughter of John Ramsay, minister of Kirkmichael in Ayrshire. She died on 18 April 1809, leaving two sons&#151;Thomas and John&#151;and two daughters; the younger, Isabella, married the painter Robert Scott Lauder. During the next five years Thomson, while fulfilling his obligations as a minister, was increasingly preoccupied with painting, sending a group of drawings for sale in Glasgow in 1803. In autumn 1805 Thomson was translated from his Ayrshire parish to the living at Duddingston on the outskirts of Edinburgh. The parish was in the gift of the marquess of Abercorn, whose factor was Thomas Scott, the brother of Sir Walter Scott. Scott and Thomson's brother Thomas had remained close friends. It was very shortly after this that Thomson sold his first landscape painting, for 15 guineas.<br>
<br>At Duddingston Thomson was close to the intellectual and cultural life of Edinburgh. His friendship with Scott in particular had a powerful influence on the subjects of his pictures as well as on his patrons, who included Scott's near neighbour and kinsman, the duke of Buccleuch. It was through his acquaintance with Scott that Thomson met Turner, entertaining the English painter as his guest in 1822 while both men were working on illustrations for Scott's <span class="italic">Provincial Antiquities of Scotland</span>. Thomson started exhibiting in Edinburgh at the 1808 Associated Society of Artists exhibitions, continuing until the year of his death (1840). He declined ordinary membership of the Scottish Academy because of his clerical office but was elected (1830) an honorary one. Despite this determination to maintain his amateur status, his commercial success was considerable; he apparently earned &pound;1800 a year from his painting during the 1820s.<br>
<br>Thomson married, second, on 6 December 1813, Frances Ingram Spence (<i>d</i>. 1845), widow of Martin Dalrymple of Fordell, Fife. With her he had three sons&#151;Francis, Charles, and Henry&#151;and a daughter, Mary Helen. Thomson's love for art was not confined to painting; he was also passionately fond of music, and played the violin and the flute. He was a member of a number of Edinburgh clubs and he contributed several articles on scientific subjects to the <span class="italic">Edinburgh Review</span>, then recently started.<br>
<br>Thomson died at his home, Duddingston manse, near Edinburgh on 28 October 1840 and was buried in Duddingston kirkyard. His wife Frances died on 11 October 1845. Thomson had little or no formal training as a painter and this undoubtedly hampered his development considerably. He remained, however, the greatest Scottish painter of his generation, and the first to echo fully on canvas the scenery so extraordinarily and influentially conjured up by Sir Walter Scott in both poetry and prose; Thomson produced at least eleven views of Fast Castle, the probable model for Wolf's Crag in Scott's <span class="italic">The Bride of Lammermoor</span>, at least one for Scott himself (Abbotsford House, Roxburghshire).<br>
<br>Unfortunately, many of Thomson's pictures are now in poor condition owing to his habit of painting upon an insufficiently hardened ground of flour boiled with vinegar, which he described as &#145;parritch&#146;, and a considerable use of bitumen. His slighter and more directly painted pictures are, however, in a much sounder state, freshly and elegantly painted and showing a considerable sensitivity and charm of handling which one would hardly expect from his more elaborate work where exaggeration of topography and of expression appears at times over-rhetorical and self-indulgent.<br>
<br>Thomson does not appear to have travelled on the continent and most (though not all) of his subjects were found in the lowlands of Scotland. His vision of his native country and its scenery had a profound influence on the next generation of Scottish landscape painters, particularly Horatio McCulloch, whom Thomson befriended when the young man first arrived from the west of Scotland in the 1820s.<br>
<br>Thomson is represented in the National Gallery of Scotland by some fourteen works which span every period of his career; there are five examples at Kelvingrove Art Gallery, Glasgow, and one in the Tate collection.<br>
<br>There are portrait drawings of Thomson by William Bewick and Sir Thomas Dick Lauder, and two painted portraits by William Wallace in the Scottish National Portrait Gallery, Edinburgh. The present location of a bust-length portrait by Raeburn is unknown.<br>
