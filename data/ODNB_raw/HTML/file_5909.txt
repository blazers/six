<span class="headword">Colleton,  John</span>  (1548&#150;1635), <span class="occ">Roman Catholic priest</span>, was the son of Edmund Colleton or Collington (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1576), gentleman, of Milverton, Somerset. In 1565 John Colleton entered Lincoln College, Oxford, but took no degree. He had grown up a protestant but converted to Catholicism about 1568 before leaving for the continent in the early 1570s. His family converted to Catholicism on Colleton's return to England. His father was arrested as a recusant soon afterwards and died in Gloucester prison about 1576.<br>
<br>In 1572 Colleton joined the Carthusian order at Louvain at the age of twenty-three or twenty-four. A speech impediment made him think that he wished to live a contemplative rather than an active religious life. However, after about a year he left the order because of his deteriorating health. The fact that he was a bad singer also seems to have influenced his decision to leave. The last of his six music teachers<blockquote>delivered my unaptness to the Prior in these tearmes, That he could teach a Cow to bellow in tune, as soone as me to sing in tune. Further, my state of body, and unaptness to sing was such, that two of the Senior Monks of the house, advised me to content my selfe with an other state of life, namely, to take Priesthood and go into <i>England</i>. (Colleton, <span class="italic">Just Defence</span>, 300)</blockquote>Colleton arrived at the English College in Douai on 14 January 1576. He was ordained at Binche on 16 June and was sent to England on 19 July the same year, using the alias of Peters. In England he finally recovered his health. He worked as a missionary priest in several places until the arrival in England of the first Jesuits, Edmund Campion and Robert Persons. Colleton was arrested in the company of Campion at Lyford, Berkshire, on 17 July 1581. A few days later he was a prisoner in the Tower of London. On 31 July he was moved to the Marshalsea, thus escaping torture. On 20 November Colleton was tried together with nineteen other priests on the charge of having plotted, at Rome and Rheims, the murder of the queen and an invasion of England. As Colleton could prove that he had not been out of the country he was acquitted, but remained in prison until he was exiled on 15 January 1585, together with other leading missionary priests such as William Bishop and Thomas Worthington. Colleton then visited the English College, Rheims, and spent some time in Rome. At Rouen he met Persons, who apparently tried to dissuade him from entering the religious life because of his inclination to melancholy. Colleton lived abroad until 1587, when he returned to England, settling first in London and later in Kent.<br>
<br>From about 1600 Colleton became involved in the appellant or archpriest controversy (1598&#150;1602), the virulent and bitter controversy between a group of Catholic secular priests, the appellants, and the English Jesuits, about the organization and control of the Catholic mission in England. Colleton sided with appellants such as John Mush, opposing the appointment in 1598 of Archpriest George Blackwell and the political influence of the Jesuits, especially Robert Persons. In their attempts to organize the English clergy Colleton and Mush became known as the more moderate or responsible appellants, though their opinions did not differ fundamentally from those of their party who chose to express themselves in an extremist manner. Though Colleton was never a prisoner at Wisbech Castle, he signed the appeal at Wisbech on 17 November 1600. In 1601 he was suspended by Blackwell, who deemed him and the appellant movement schismatic. In order to defend himself Colleton at this time published a learned contribution to the archpriest controversy, <span class="italic">A Just Defence of the Slandered Priestes</span> (1602), a theological work which was also intended to answer Persons's <span class="italic">A Just Apologie, or Defence of the Catholike Ecclesiastical Hierarchie</span> (1601). In 1603 Colleton signed the declaration of allegiance to Queen Elizabeth and the appeal to the pope. In 1604 he wrote <span class="italic">A Supplication to the King's most Excellent Majestie</span>, an anonymous petition to James I for the toleration of Catholics.<br>
<br>In 1608 Colleton was appointed archdeacon of London by Archpriest George Birket. Despite his protestations of political submission to the English sovereign and his repudiation of the pope's deposing power, Colleton refused to take the oath of allegiance. He was once more arrested, about 10 December 1609, and sent to the Clink prison. Apparently he was free to work in Sussex for a brief span in 1610 but subsequently spent several years in prison. From 1613 to 1618 he was in the Clink, Southwark, and from 1621 in the New prison. Although he was ordered to be banished he remained in prison until 5 April 1622 when he was released. When in 1623 William Bishop was consecrated the Roman Catholic bishop of Chalcedon and created the chapter Colleton was constituted the first dean and vicar-general for the eastern district. Because of his great age and declining health Colleton was assisted by George Fisher, alias Musket, the archdeacon of Surrey and Middlesex.<br>
<br>During the latter part of his life Colleton lived and worked as chaplain in the household of the recusant Sir William Roper of Well Hall in Eltham, Kent. He died at Eltham on 19 October 1635, the cause of his death unknown. He was buried the following day in the churchyard of Eltham parish.<br>
