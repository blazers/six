<span class="headword">Mellanby,  Kenneth</span>  (1908&#150;1993), <span class="occ">ecologist</span>, was born on 26 March 1908 at Chapellfield, Barrhead, Renfrewshire, the son of Alexander Lawson Mellanby (1871&#150;1951), professor of mechanical engineering at the Royal Technical College, Glasgow, and his wife, Annie, formerly Maundel. His uncle <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/34981/', "John Mellanby (1878&#150;1939)")</script> was Waynflete professor of physiology at Oxford; another uncle, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/34980/', "Sir Edward Mellanby (1884&#150;1955)")</script>, directed the Medical Research Council. Mellanby was educated at Barnard Castle school, then read natural sciences at King's College, Cambridge, when his interest in medical entomology began. He moved in 1930 to the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine where he studied for a PhD on the susceptibility of human parasites to desiccation and overheating, and became interested in cockroaches and bedbugs. He married on 2 October 1933 Helen Neilson (<i>b</i>. 1910/11), daughter of George William Dow, a retired accountant. A daughter, Jane, was born but the marriage ended in divorce.<br>
<br>Between 1936 and 1941 Mellanby was Sorby fellow of the Royal Society, which directed him to research in Sheffield. From October 1939, following advice from Patrick Buxton of the London School of Hygiene, Mellanby conducted research on head lice. He found that possibly 50 per cent of girls aged up to fourteen were infested with head lice. He correlated the incidence of head lice with poverty and with family size. At the prompting of medical officers, in December 1940 he set up a research unit to study the effects of scabies infestations. He gathered a group of conscientious objectors to serve as his human guinea-pigs. Among these was Walter Bartley, then a laboratory technician but destined to become professor of biochemistry and vice-chancellor of the University of Sheffield. Mellanby placed scabies in bedding to study how long it would take for persons to be infected, and was surprised to find that this took months. However, when a bed was shared, infestation took place. In order to make greater use of his volunteers he suggested dietetic experiments and he collaborated with Hans Krebs, the refugee biochemist, in research on the properties of &#145;national wheatmeal&#146; flour.<br>
<br>The scabies work led to extensive observation and treatment of military personnel in a special hospital for infested soldiers, and to the instruction of army medical officers. Mellanby kept volunteers (numbering forty-seven by May 1942) infested for months at a time, and he devised a successful treatment. The Ministry of Information produced a film on the experiments to advise on treatment of scabies. He conducted experiments on water deprivation in 1942, and on vitamins. He went on to propose infecting his volunteers with malaria in 1943, and at one stage suggested infecting them with typhus, albeit with their consent. The Medical Research Council prohibited what would have been a dangerous and unnecessary human experiment. He wrote up his experiences in <span class="italic">Human Guinea Pigs</span> (1945), and concluded by proposing a permanent institute for human experiments. He was made an OBE for his scabies work. In 1945 Mellanby turned to scrub typhus research, which was relevant for the continuing war in the Far East. For this he went to Burma and New Guinea. In December 1946 Mellanby went to Germany for three weeks to hunt for medical documents, and attended the trials of Nazi doctors at Nuremberg and Dachau. It appears that he sifted through the reports of British intelligence officers at Frankfurt (presumably of the British branch of FIAT), and visited some former concentration camps. The exact documents which he brought to Britain have never been identified. He was accredited as correspondent of the <span class="italic">British Medical Journal</span> with the brief of observing the Nuremberg medical trial. He published in <span class="italic">The Lancet</span> on 7 December 1946 and in the <span class="italic">BMJ</span>, drawing attention to the scientific quality of some experiments, particularly those of the malariologist Claus Schilling, who was tried at Dachau in 1945, and to the typhus experiments of Erwin Ding at Buchenwald. Both sets of experiments involved deliberate infection of victims. While Mellanby roundly condemned Nazism, and the sadism of many of the experiments, he identified a legitimate scientific component and asserted (without providing a source) that Schilling had obtained prisoners' consent at Dachau. He also commended the typhus work as a &#145;useful evaluation of the various vaccines&#146;, overlooking the fact that about 1200 Russian, Gypsy, and French prisoners were killed in the experiments. Mellanby strongly believed that Gerhard Rose, a professor of tropical medicine whom he knew personally, was innocent, as were a number of the defendants, for example Handloser. The defence counsel of Becker-Freyseng cited Mellanby in the document book no. 20. The <span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span> of 11 February 1947 cited Mellanby in its report on Nazi medical experiments, quoting its correspondent as saying that Mellanby &#145;&#147;told me yesterday that some of the results of experiments by Nazis on inmates of concentration camps could be of great value to medical science&#148;&#146;. Mellanby believed that the results should be made available to bona fide investigators.<br>
<br>There followed a succession of appointments as academic administrator. Mellanby's work as principal of University College, Ibadan, from 1947 to 1953 confirmed his abilities as an academic organizer. He was appointed CBE in recognition of his achievements. On 17 May 1949 he remarried; his second wife was Jean Louie Copeland (<i>b</i>. 1915/16), who, with their son Alexander Robert Mellanby, survived him. In 1955 Mellanby became head of the department of entomology, Rothamsted Experimental Station. From 1961 to 1974 he was director of the Nature Conservancy's new experimental station at Monk's Wood in Hertfordshire. Mellanby was no conventional bureaucrat: he reflected on his own career:<blockquote>Ideas for practical research are more likely to come from active young scientists than from learned councils and committees. We need to find ways of encouraging such work and of interfering with its progress as little as possible. I was lucky; there was a war on, and the red tape that strangles so much initiative could be cut in a way that would be more difficult today.</blockquote>He was drawn into controversy, first advocating environmentalist views but increasingly defending the use of chemicals in farming. He found some time for research, particularly on moles. He shifted to a defence of modern farming techniques. He was awarded an honorary DSc in 1970 from the University of Essex.<br>
<br>In the 1970s Mellanby took a leading role at the International Conferences on the Unity of the Sciences, founded by Sun Myung Moon in 1972. He co-chaired with R. V. Jones the third conference held in London in 1974, and chaired committees at the fourth conference, on science and absolute values, in New York in 1975, at the sixth in San Francisco in 1977, and at the seventh conference in Boston in 1978.<br>
<br>In retirement Mellanby continued to act as scientific consultant (as for the development of Gomera in the Canaries) and as a scientific author. He wrote eloquently on environmental issues, defending the use of pesticides and modern farming techniques, while also calling for a greater ecological awareness.<br>
<br>Mellanby was a determined researcher, and a headstrong character, as when he was the only British delegate who attended a conference on 23 August 1939 in the Netherlands despite imminent war. He was talented as an organizer of research, and in presenting lucid analyses of scientific issues. His instincts were conservative, and he generally sided with the scientist as a dispassionate arbiter of biological and social problems. While major scientific awards and honours eluded him, he carved an outstanding career in applied biological research, and stirred some hornet's nests on controversial issues such as pesticides and experiments on human beings. He died at his home, 13 Wonford Road, Exeter, Devon, on 23 December 1993.<br>
