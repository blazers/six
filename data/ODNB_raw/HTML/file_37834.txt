<span class="headword">Pares,  Richard</span>  (1902&#150;1958), <span class="occ">historian</span>, was born on 25 August 1902 in Colchester, Essex, the eldest in the family of three sons and two daughters of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35378/', "Sir Bernard Pares (1867&#150;1949)")</script>, historian, and his wife, Margaret Ellis, daughter of Edward Austin Dixon, dental surgeon, of Colchester. After winning scholarships at Winchester College and at Balliol College, Oxford, he took a first class in <i>literae humaniores</i> in 1924 and was elected to a fellowship of All Souls which he held until 1945. A one-year stint as assistant lecturer at University College, London, was followed in 1928 by a year of research in the United States and the West Indies, financed by a Laura Spelman Rockefeller memorial studentship.<br>
<br>In 1929 Pares was appointed lecturer at New College, Oxford. In 1937 he married Janet Lindsay, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35596/', "F. Maurice Powicke (1879&#150;1963)")</script>, historian. They had four daughters. War interrupted the early stages of a brilliant academic career: from 1940 to 1945 Pares served with distinction as an administrative-class civil servant in the Board of Trade, being appointed CBE in 1945. He was joint editor of the <span class="italic">English Historical Review</span> from 1939 to 1958; professor of history in the University of Edinburgh from 1945 until his resignation on health grounds in 1954; and in 1951&#150;2 Ford's lecturer in Oxford, delivering the lectures which became probably the most widely known of his books, <span class="italic">King George III and the Politicians</span> (1953). He was elected FBA in 1948.<br>
<br>Pares published extensively in a series of monographs illuminating various aspects of his chosen field, the role of the West Indies in the development of the British empire, and the determination of British international policy during the eighteenth century: his pioneering investigations ranged widely over questions of war and trade and international law. From the start his scholarship, like his wartime work in the civil service, was characterized by indefatigable industry, commanding intellectual powers, personal detachment, and complete integrity. His first book, <span class="italic">War and Trade in the West Indies, 1739&#150;1763</span> (1936), a <i>tour de force</i> based on immense research, was infused throughout by his pursuit of what he once declared to be his prime interest in history&#151;&#145;to find out how things worked&#146;. In these earlier years he eschewed biography as a path to understanding. But he had revised his view by the time he wrote <span class="italic">A West-India Fortune</span> (1950): there, and in <span class="italic">King George III and the Politicians</span>, the two approaches were fruitfully combined. In the last-named work he opened up lines of interpretation which, even if somewhat modified since, set firm foundations on which other scholars might build: the exuberant vigour and almost Niagara-like outpouring of scholarship gave it a memorable quality. Much of his later work, achieved under the shadow of inexorably crippling and ultimately fatal illness, which he faced with the utmost fortitude, was latterly facilitated by the research fellowship conferred on him by All Souls in 1954. Pares died in the Churchill Hospital, Oxford, on 3 May 1958; his wife survived him. He was considered to be among the outstanding British historians of his time.<br>
