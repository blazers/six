<span class="headword">Langdale,  Alban</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1532&#150;1580), <span class="occ">Roman Catholic priest and writer</span>, was born in Yorkshire, possibly at Houghton, but nothing is known of his parentage. He was educated at St John's College, Cambridge, graduating BA in 1532, becoming a fellow of St John's in March 1534, and commencing MA in 1535. In 1539 he was one of the proctors of the university. His clerical career began in 1541 when he was ordained deacon; in the same year he was ordained priest and became university chaplain, a position he held until 1554. In 1544 he proceeded BTh. In June 1549 he was one of the Roman Catholic speakers in the debates held before the royal commissioners for the visitation of the university about transubstantiation and whether, in the communion service, there was &#145;none other oblation or sacrifice&#146; than &#145;remembrance of Christ's death, and of thanksgiving&#146;  (<span class="italic">Acts and Monuments</span>, 6.308). In November 1551 Roger Ascham confessed to being &#145;sorry Mr Langdale is gone from college, although he did dissent from us in religion&#146;  (Ascham, 393), but Langdale returned to the university early in Mary's reign, commencing DTh in 1554, and being incorporated in that degree at Oxford in the same year. Adding to his rectorship of Buxted, Sussex, he was made prebendary of Ampleforth in York diocese on 26 May 1554, archdeacon of Chichester on 16 April 1555, prebendary of Alrewas in the church of Lichfield on 19 January 1559, and chancellor of Lichfield in the following month. Mary's reign also saw him disputing with Cranmer, Latimer, and Ridley at Oxford in 1554, taking part in the third and sixth examinations of Richard Woodman in 1557, and being dispatched by Anthony Browne, first Viscount Montague, whose chaplain he had become, to &#145;preach in places not well affected in religion&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1547&#150;80</i>, 162) in 1558. It was also in Mary's reign that his <span class="italic">Catholica confutatio impiae cuiusdam determinationis D. Nicolai Ridlei</span> (Paris, 1556) was published.<br>
<br>Early in Elizabeth I's reign Langdale was one of the eight Roman Catholics appointed to take part in the abortive Westminster disputation begun on 31 March 1559. By 7 October 1559 he had been deprived of the archdeaconry of Chichester, having refused to take the supremacy oath, and, having failed to attend the visitation at York in the same year, he had lost his prebendal stall there by 7 November. After deprivation he took up residence at Lord Montague's residence at Cowdray, Sussex. In 1561 he was described as &#145;learned and very earnest in papistry&#146; on a list of recusants, and ordered to remain within Lord Montague's household, or somewhere else appointed by his lordship, and to be ready to appear before the authorities on twelve days' notice  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1547&#150;65</i>, <i>addenda</i>, 523). Richard Smith blamed Langdale for Montague's occasional conformity, describing the priest as &#145;a learned and pious man indeed, but fearful&#146;  (Smith, 19). In 1580 a manuscript treatise entitled &#145;A discourse delivered to Mr Sheldon to persuade him to conform. Arguments to prove it lawful for a Roman Catholic to attend the Protestant service&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 12/144/69) began to circulate among incarcerated Roman Catholics. Robert Parsons, eager to track down its author, discovered tell-tale annotations on theological works in Langdale's library at Montague's Southwark residence. Since then the work, copied and disseminated by William Clithero, and instrumental in persuading Ralph Sheldon and Thomas, third Lord Paget, to conformity, has usually, and very convincingly, been attributed to Langdale, though his authorship cannot be proved.<br>
<br>Crucially, the tract was not a general dispensation for conformity, but a casuistical treatment of the specific dilemma faced by people from the upper echelons of society who had been imprisoned. It also helped the cause of partial conformity, suggesting that by combining presence at services with a refusal to participate on particular occasions the risks of undermining the loyalty of one's fellow religionists could be minimized. Its main contemporary importance was the extent to which it provoked the advocates of nonconformity, and Parsons and George Blackwell collaborated on a riposte  (&#145;Against going to churche&#146;, 1580, BL, Add. MS 39830). A chief concern was the timing of Langdale's tract: its tempting advice was dispensed only a few months ahead of the harsh 1581 anti-recusancy legislation. The tract's main historical significance is the rare glimpse it offers of a theologically grounded alternative to recusancy. The &#145;Tetrastichon&#146; and &#145;Carmina diversa&#146; appended to J. Seton's <span class="italic">Dialectica</span> (1574), are also by Langdale. His movements after 1580 are unclear, but he may have died between 1587 and 1589. Suggestions that he moved to the continent cannot be substantiated. He should not be confused with Thomas Langdale, regarded as his nephew, who was another defender of Roman Catholic conformity.<br>
