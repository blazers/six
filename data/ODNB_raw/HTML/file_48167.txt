<span class="headword">Trelawny, Sir  Harry</span>, seventh baronet  (<em>bap. </em>1756, <em>d.</em> 1834), <span class="occ">dissenting minister, Church of England clergyman, and Roman Catholic priest</span>, was baptized at St Budeaux, Devon, on 26 June 1756, the only son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27690/', "Sir William Trelawny, sixth baronet (1722/3&#150;1772)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27686/', "Trelawny, Edward")</script>], and his wife and first cousin, Laetitia (<i>bap</i>. 1728, <i>d</i>. 1772), daughter of Sir Harry Trelawny, fifth baronet. He attended Plympton grammar school before 1770, and entered Westminster School that year when his father left Britain to become governor of Jamaica. On his father's death on 11 December 1772, he succeeded to the baronetcy and inherited the family estates in south-west England, including the family seat at Trelawne, in the parish of Pelynt, Cornwall. He matriculated as a commoner at Christ Church, Oxford, on 2 July 1773, and graduated BA on 26 April 1776. He married, on 28 April 1778, at Kingston St Mary, Ann (<i>d</i>. 1822), daughter of the Revd James Brown, rector of Portishead and vicar of Kingston St Mary, both in Somerset. They had four sons and two daughters.<br>
<br>Trelawny from an early age felt himself called to the Christian ministry but could not in conscience subscribe to the Church of England's formularies. After Oxford, having become intimate with Rowland Hill and undertaken itinerant preaching in Cornwall, Trelawny chose to be ordained as a Presbyterian minister on 22 April 1777 at the Above Bar chapel, Southampton, where he made a Calvinist confession of faith. He returned to Cornwall after ordination where he helped establish a chapel at West Looe. His pulpit message became progressively moderate as he fell under the influence of the more &#145;rational&#146; faith of the Revd Micaiah Towgood. On 26 May 1779, in a sermon at Taunton, he pleaded for generous behaviour towards Christians of all dispensations, and insisted that even pious Unitarians were not necessarily beyond salvation. In fact Trelawny had moved into that camp, a preference underlined when he participated in an ordination service with Joseph Priestley at Lympstone, Devon, in July 1779. Theophilus Lindsey reported accurately on 27 March 1780 that &#145;he is now an Arian of a very liberal cast, not holding the doctrine of the Atonement&#146;  (T. Lindsey, letter to William Tayleur). But Trelawny was drifting back to Anglicanism. Sir Harry was unable to withstand pressure from his family and &#145;tampering&#146; by Bishop John Ross of Exeter  (T. Lindsey, letter to William Tayleur, 18 July 1780). It was clearly a considerable embarrassment to the hierarchy that the great-grandson of one of the seven bishops should be assorting with rational dissenters. He was still holding out early in 1780, opining that:<blockquote>I must think, that religion is a personal concern, and that every man, by the laws of God and reason, is obliged to enquire for himself, to form the best opinions he is able, and to act honestly, according to them. (Trelawny, <span class="italic">A Letter &hellip; to &hellip; Alcock</span>, 5&#150;6)</blockquote>But his protestations only encouraged more answers, and two months later he was back in the establishment fold, his problems with the <span class="roman">Thirty-Nine Articles</span> apparently surmounted.<br>
<br>After keeping term at Christ Church to fulfil residency requirements, Trelawny took his MA and received Anglican holy orders from Bishop Ross of Exeter in one day, 22 June 1781. He quickly made his way in the Church of England. On 27 January 1789 he was named a prebendary of Exeter; in 1791 he became vicar of St Allen, Cornwall, and exchanged it for the living of Egloshayle in the same county two years later. He restored the church there and his sermons were so popular that he had to provide additional galleries. He resigned the benefice in 1804 from a combination of ill health and inability to fulfil conditions of residency under the 1803 legislation. He gave up his prebendal stall at Exeter in 1810. Trelawny's parochial duties did not inhibit him from being a successful estate owner at Trelawne. He corresponded with Robert Bakewell over cattle breeds and was a friend of the Revd Robert Walker of St Winnow, a well-known Cornish agriculturist.<br>
<br>Trelawny's religious restlessness was a recurrent part of his life, but it never seems to have affected the esteem in which most people regarded him. His goodwill towards his former dissenting colleagues was never in doubt, and his tergiversations were forgiven. As Job Orton ruefully observed: &#145;I never expected any steadiness from him&#146;  (Orton to the Revd Mr Hughes, 13 Sept 1780, Orton, 2.20). Preaching was Trelawny's lifelong passion, and he invariably attracted a fair-sized congregation, perhaps because &#145;his countenance was particularly prepossessing&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 2nd ser., 1/1, 1834, 653). His daughters Mary and Ann Letitia became Catholics and turned the family chapel at Trelawne into a Roman Catholic one. Following the death of his wife (who remained an Anglican) at Trelawne on 18 November 1822, he was persuaded by his daughters to convert to Catholicism in the mid-1820s. By that date he was permanently resident in Rome. He was ordained as a Catholic priest by Cardinal Carlo Odescalchi on 30 May 1830. Trelawny died on 25 February 1834 after an illness of ten days at Laveno on Lake Maggiore in Italy, and was buried at Laveno in a ceremony attended by all the local clergy.<br>
