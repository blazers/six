<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Lloyd,  Marie</span> <span class="st"> [<em>real name </em>Matilda Alice Victoria Wood]</span>  (1870&#150;1922), <span class="occ">music-hall entertainer</span>, was born on 12 February 1870 at 36 Plumber Street, Hoxton, London, the eldest of nine children born to Matilda Mary Caroline <i>n&eacute;e</i> Archer and her husband, John Wood, an artificial flower maker and part-time waiter at the Eagle public house on City Road. Through her father's influence she studied artistes and finally performed at the Grecian Music-Hall attached to the Eagle at the age of fourteen, under the name Bella Delmere, in the same week that Jenny Hill appeared there.<br>
<br>Marie herself dated her career from her first appearance as Marie Lloyd, at the Falstaff Music-Hall on 22 June 1884, when she was spotted by George Belmont. Within six weeks she was fourth on the bill at the Star Palace of Varieties in Bermondsey, singing &#145;The boy I love is up in the gallery&#146;, a song which became something of a trademark although originally written for Nelly Power. By 1886, still only sixteen, she was earning &pound;100 per week and in a position to buy her own songs. The following year, on 12 November, she married Percy Charles Courtenay, a racecourse tout; they had one daughter, Marie. The marriage rapidly proved difficult, but professionally she went from strength to strength; the regard in which she was held is made clear by the invitations to perform in pantomime at Drury Lane in 1891, 1892, and 1893. Lloyd, however, found the restrictions of a script unsuited to her talent, remarking of her performance, &#145;Bloody awful, eh?&#146;  (Farson, 46). Music-hall offered greater scope for the apposite and bawdy ad-libs that created a framework for her songs, and its format was well suited to her unique delivery. Shaw praised her perfect sense of pitch and rhythm, and the precision of her diction is apparent in the feeblest archive recordings. This vocal accuracy allowed a complex relationship with her material. She could play out the contrast between the persona of a song and her own stage presence: as a cockney child in the country, giggling as a bull &#145;wagged 'is apparatus&#146;, she wiped her nose on her sleeve and kicked aimlessly, dressed in one of the elaborate gowns she loved; she could add a top-spin of lewdness to the most innocent lyric and slip into amused contemplation of her own naughtiness; the title of one of her first commissioned songs, &#145;When you wink the other eye&#146;, symbolized her stage presence&#151;the sense of sharing a secret with her audience rather than simply a smutty joke.<br>
<br>Lloyd articulated disappointments of working-class life, especially those of women. Some of her most famous songs were grounded in the realities of poverty: &#145;My old man&#146;, despite its jolly chorus, is about the disorientation of a wife forced yet again to do a moonlight flit because there is no money for the rent. &#145;Off went the cart with me home packed in it&#146;, she sang confidingly, and the audience understood the desolation that sets the wife drinking until she can't remember her new address. The violence that underlay many marriages underscored the song &#145;It's a bit of a ruin that Cromwell knocked about a bit&#146;, the story of a woman who loses her money after &#145;sitting in the grass with a commercial traveller&#146;. Lloyd favoured these poignant vignettes increasingly as her career progressed, giving rise to an image that her friend Naomi Jacob describes with some indignation in her biography: &#145;Realising that she was growing old, [she] determined &hellip; to show herself to her public as she really was &hellip; an old, grey-faced, tired woman&#146;  (Jacob, 199). Lloyd loved clothes, designing luxurious stagewear as well as painstakingly detailed costumes for numbers like these. It was not fading looks that prompted her interest, but rather a pride in versatility. Nor were her &#145;drabs&#146; always downtrodden: in Lloyd's most quoted song, an old woman whose husband fancies a fortnight on his own is told:<blockquote>
<div>If that's your blooming gime, I intend to do the sime<br>
</div>
<div>'Cos a little of what you fancy does yer good.<br>
</div>
</blockquote>This insistence on women's right to pleasure brought Lloyd into frequent collisions with censorship, most famously in her clash with Laura Ormiston Chant of the Social Purity Alliance. In 1894 Chant campaigned against the &#145;ladies of the promenade&#146; who used the Empire Theatre as a market place. She succeeded in prompting the London county council to erect screens around the promenade, only to have them torn down by an outraged public (Winston Churchill used the occasion to make his first political speech). She went on to make a public protest when Lloyd was singing at the Empire, and Lloyd was called before the council's theatres and music-halls committee with a view to changing some of her songs. The story goes that she sang &#145;Johnny Jones&#146;, a child's-eye view of the facts of life, in tones of angelic purity; she then performed &#145;Come into the garden, Maud&#146;, larded with leers and nudges, provocatively nibbling her pearls to point up each innuendo, finally arguing &#145;it's all in the mind&#146;.<br>
<br>The episode has passed into legend, and this masks the real tragedy&#151;that Lloyd and Chant were constructed by the press of their time as natural enemies, and have continued to be read as such. In fact they often shared a political position. If Lloyd asserted female desire, Chant was as concerned with the right to resist marital rape. Her concern for censorship arose out of the <span class="roman">Contagious Diseases Act</span>, which sought to stop the spread of venereal infection by allowing the police to subject any woman on the streets to forcible examination; she fought to prevent men excited by the sensual patter of the halls gaining access to prostitutes and infecting their wives. Chant frequently spoke out against domestic violence: in the same year as the battle of the promenade Lloyd was threatened by her estranged husband, Percy Courtenay. Chant was preoccupied by the low wages of music-hall performers: in 1907 Lloyd supported a strike by the Variety Artistes' Federation against an attempt by Stoll-Moss to create a monopoly and limit the freedom of performers; she was appalled by contractual loopholes permitting managements to extract unpaid matin&eacute;es from exhausted performers, gave generously to the strike fund, and picketed theatres using non-union labour.<br>
<br>Lloyd's popularity substantially aided federation victory but in a few years she encountered both political and personal difficulties. In 1896 she had met the singer Alexander (Alec) Hurley (1870/71&#150;1913) but, denied a divorce until May 1905, did not marry him until 27 October 1906. Their marriage crumbled in 1910 as she became infatuated with Bernard Dillon (<i>c</i>.1888&#150;1941), the jockey who rode Lemberg to Derby victory in that year. They lived together openly, although she did not pursue her intended divorce, and from the outset the partnership was fraught with problems; Dillon lost his jockey's licence and turned to drink. Meanwhile Lloyd was snubbed by Oswald Stoll when he organized the royal command performance in 1912. It seems likely that this was an act of revenge for the strike, although Stoll may also have seen Lloyd's exclusion as illustrating his policy of making music-hall respectable. He published a manifesto in <span class="italic">The Era</span> on the day of the performance: &#145;Coarseness and vulgarity etc are not allowed &hellip; this intimation is rendered necessary only by a few artists&#146;  (Jacob, 93).<br>
<br>Lloyd's response was to stage her own show at the London Pavilion, under a banner proclaiming every one of her performances a &#145;command performance by order of the British public&#146;. Her departure for America in 1913 was a further attempt to recover from the snub, but on landing she and Dillon were threatened with deportation and sent back to Ellis Island. Dillon was charged under the <span class="roman">White Slave Act</span> with &#145;taking to the country a woman who is not his wife&#146; and Lloyd with being a &#145;passive agent&#146;. Lloyd was outspoken on the subject of American hypocrisy; pointing to the Statue of Liberty she remarked &#145;I love your sense of humour&#146;. The Washington board of enquiry reversed the decision as Lloyd was boarding the <i>Olympic</i> to sail back; Lloyd and Dillon were allowed to stay on surety of &pound;300 each if they would undertake to live apart in the USA. Lloyd agreed, and performed to enthusiastic houses. Hurley died during the tour, and Lloyd and Dillon married at the British consulate in Portland, Oregon, on 21 February 1914.<br>
<br>Throughout the First World War Lloyd toured factories and gave special concerts for soldiers, but she did not receive any official recognition for her work. Her post-war years were marked by the increasing violence of Dillon, and she continued to work out of financial necessity; their marriage ended in separation in 1920. She died from heart and kidney failure on 7 October 1922 at her home, 37 Woodstock Road, Golders Green, Middlesex, having been taken ill on the stage of the Alhambra, and was buried in Hampstead cemetery. Descriptions of her at the end of her career range from assurances of her continuing greatness to accounts of performances marred by drunkenness and depression. Sentiment, perhaps, colours both these images. What is clear, however, is that the nation's grief at Marie Lloyd's death was also grief for the death of the music-hall that had shaped her.<br>
