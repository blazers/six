<span class="headword">Lloyd,  William</span>  (1627&#150;1717), <span class="occ">bishop of Worcester</span>, was the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16851/', "Richard Lloyd (1594/5&#150;1659)")</script>, rector of Tilehurst and vicar of Sonning, Berkshire, and his wife, Joan, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Wicken; Richard Lloyd's family were of an ancient distinguished Welsh lineage. William Lloyd was born in Tilehurst rectory on 18 August 1627 and baptized on the 26th of that month.<h2>
<a name="Educationandearlycareer"></a>Education and early career</h2>Lloyd was taught Latin, Greek, and Hebrew by his father at home and he entered Richard Lloyd's Oxford college, Oriel, at the age of eleven, where he matriculated on 25 March 1639, moving to Jesus College in 1640 and graduating BA on 25 October 1642. He then left Oxford, which was occupied by the king's forces in the civil war, and seems to have returned to Berkshire. When Oxford surrendered to parliament Lloyd returned there and graduated MA from Jesus College, of which he was a fellow, on 9 December 1646. In 1648 he was episcopally ordained deacon in Oxford, went back to Berkshire to act as tutor in a gentry family, may have paid visits to the royal court in Paris in 1651 and 1653, and was presented to the rectory of Bradfield in Berkshire. In 1653 he married a woman whose maiden name may have been Cheney and who died in 1654. By December 1654 he had resigned his claim to the Bradfield living rather than face a contest for it with a Cromwellian claimant. He was ordained priest, again episcopally, in 1656 and took up a private tutoring post in Oxford until 1659. In that year an apparent oddity in Lloyd's career&#151;given that his father was an ardent royalist, that he had undergone episcopal ordination and that he had reputedly paid homage to the exiled court&#151;arose: in an attempt &#145;to impose upon the royalists&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 1.xxxviii), Lloyd choreographed a fraud in which a London merchant was disguised as a patriarch of the Greek Orthodox church, to whom Oxford sympathizers were prevailed upon to do reverence. However, leading Oxford presbyterians were also gulled by this fraud into discussing with the suppositious patriarch a &#145;modell&#146;  (ibid.) of church government and this may have been part of the reason that, although in the short term Lloyd had to flee presbyterian wrath in Oxford, upon the Restoration his career prospered.<br>
<br>In 1660 Lloyd was nominated for a prebend in Ripon; he took up the office in person, after a protracted spell of ill health, on 3 June 1663, and in July 1666 was made a chaplain-in-ordinary to the king. In 1667 Lloyd added BD and DD to his Oxford degrees and began a career as an anti-Catholic publicist with a work calling into question the contribution that recusants had made to the royal cause during the civil wars, <span class="italic">The Late &#145;Apology in behalf of the Papists&#146;, &hellip; Answered</span>. A rapid series of ecclesiastical promotions now followed: vicar of St Mary's, Reading, in 1668 (until 1676) and in the same year a string of appointments appropriate to his Welsh ancestry&#151;vicar of Llan-fawr in Merioneth, archdeacon of Merioneth, and rector of Llandudno, Caernarvonshire. His prospects steadily improving, he cemented his clerical alliances on 3 December 1668 with a marriage to Anne Jones (1646&#150;1719), daughter of the subdean of Westminster. He consolidated his Welsh preferments with the deanery of Bangor in 1672, published three anti-Catholic works including <span class="italic">A Seasonable Discourse &hellip; in Opposition to Popery</span> in 1673, extended his holdings to London with the acquisition of the prebend of Caddington Minor in St Paul's in the same year, was made canon residentiary of Salisbury in 1674, and gave up his St Paul's prebend in favour of the vicarage of St Martin-in-the-Fields, the hugely overpopulated Westminster parish, where he was inducted on 6 December 1676 and served as a conscientious incumbent. In the year of his appointment, in <span class="italic">Considerations Touching their True Way to Suppress Popery</span>, he argued that toleration given to Catholics who would abjure the pope's infallibility and deposing power would weaken the English Romanists by dividing them. The proposal for selective indulgence for those Catholics won the approval of the Catholic duke of York. Deeply unpopular with fellow clerics as a court prot&eacute;g&eacute;, between November 1677 and January 1678 Lloyd served as leading chaplain in the Netherlands to York's daughter Mary, following her marriage to the prince of Orange.<br>
<br>The alleged murder by Catholic extremists of the St Martin's parishioner Sir Edmund Berry Godfrey on or after 12 October 1678 allowed Lloyd as vicar to deliver, on the 31st of the month, a funeral sermon of uncompromising anti-popery: &#145;God keep England from your bloody religion&#146;  (Tindal Hart, 29); he subsequently played an active part in the prosecution of the alleged murder, attended one of those accused of the crime, Berry, to his execution, and has been convincingly identified by his leading biographer, Tindal Hart, as Charles II's confidential intermediary in the follow-up to the Godfrey affair, possibly keeping back features of Berry's confessions that might have embarrassed the court. The conferment on him of further Welsh benefices, a prebend at Llandaff, in March 1679, and the vicarage of Llanefydd in 1680, might fit such speculations. It seems likely that in order to protect his reputation for protestantism he refrained from coming forward to discredit the evidence, as he had the knowledge to do, of the informer Turberville against the accused Catholic peer Lord Stafford in 1680: the Stafford execution redounded to the benefit of the crown by identifying Shaftesbury and the whigs with blood lust. Lloyd, who in August 1680 was commissioned by the secretary of state with espionage against subversives in Reading, put his foot on the first rung of the episcopal ladder with his elevation to the bishopric of St Asaph on 3 October 1680, taking up residence, after attending the House of Lords over the winter, on April 1681. A series of Welsh livings newly acquired in the 1680s compensated the new bishop for the modest St Asaph stipend in return for which he had surrendered all his other benefices.<br>
<br>Ambitious careerist as he clearly was, Lloyd had already shown in his tenure at St Martin's that he could apply himself conscientiously to his clerical duties. In impoverished St Asaph, which had had an easy-going episcopal regime under the previous diocesan, he was determined on sweeping reforms, including the recovery of the diocese's alienated real estate. He announced his intention of holding his confirmations using the Welsh language and constantly sought improvements from his clergy, carrying out ordinations regularly, aiming to raise depressed stipends and improve educational levels, and to secure attendance on parsons' duties in person and exact record keeping of the conditions of their parishes, as well as requiring strict standards of sobriety, honesty in the charging of fees from the laity, administration of the sacraments, and rigour in the use of excommunication and of sabbath observance.<br>
<br>With religious repression in the tory reaction rising in England from the time of Lloyd's taking up his duties in St Asaph he used discussion with, rather than repression of, dissenters in his diocese&#151;with Quakers on 22 September 1681 and 6 August 1682, and with presbyterians on 27 September 1681 and 28 August 1682. His preferred policy was one of public disputation and private conference to win dissenters back to the communion of the Church of England, while he established relations of real respect with individual figures such as the Quaker Richard Davies and the presbyterian Philip Henry. However, by 1682 he was assuring Archbishop Sancroft that he was energetically prosecuting religious dissidents, and in the repressive royalist and tory mood of the reaction to the whig Rye House plot in 1683 adopted the full-throated language of anti-nonconformity, demanding the rigorous enforcement of the penal laws. Amid all his storm of activity as a bishop, Lloyd the scholar found the time to complete for publication in 1684 his <span class="italic">History of the government of the church as it was in Great Britain, when they first received the Christian religion</span>, a defence of the episcopal governance of the early British church.<h2>
<a name="Thesevenbishops"></a>The seven bishops</h2>The accession of James II, who distrusted Lloyd for his prosecution of those implicated in the Popish Plot, put his career on standby, though in 1685&#150;6 he canvassed all vacancies, impending and actual, on the bench of bishops. James's switch to the adoption of religious toleration in 1687 presented the bishop of St Asaph with a dilemma. As he showed when he cordially welcomed French protestant refugees into his bishopric in the wake of the revocation of the edict of Nantes in 1685&#151;filling up his ordination lists with the names of their clergy and bestirring his own priests into contributing to the relief of the exiles&#151;he could be eirenic in his attitude to protestants, but the toleration of recusants which loomed so large in James II's two declarations of indulgence, of 1687 and 1688, was beyond consideration for the anti-Catholic Lloyd. A meeting of opponents of the second, April 1688, declaration chaired by Sancroft on 12 May 1688 identified Lloyd as one of the bishops to be called to London to take part in the petition to the king against the enforced reading by the clergy of the Church of England of the toleration manifesto: he speedily arrived in the capital&#151;at the home of the tory Anglican leader, the earl of Clarendon&#151;on the 16th and rapidly joined the opposition to the king's plans. He was, after Sancroft, the second of the seven bishops to sign the petition that was delivered in person to James on 18 May and, in the archbishop's absence from the actual delegation, he took a leading role in the presentation, handing it to the king and attempting to deflect James's wrathful accusation that the petition hoisted the standard of rebellion with the protest, &#145;We have adventured our lives for your Majesty, and would loose the last drop of our blood rather than lift up a finger against you&#146;  (Tindal Hart, 99). He went on to argue with the king by pointing out that the dispensing power, the constitutional foundation on which the declaration rested, had been declared illegal by parliament under both Charles II and James himself. Though Bishop Compton of London rather than he was probably responsible for leaking the petition to the printers, it may have been Lloyd who followed up the confrontation with the king with a letter advising all ministers of the Church of England to abstain from reading the declaration. James's decision to imprison and prosecute the bishops was implicit in the interview of the evening of 18 May.<br>
<br>Having returned to St Asaph, Lloyd had to come back to London for an appearance before the privy council on 6 June and again took a defiant stand towards the king, insisting on the bishops' common law right not to incriminate themselves and boldly refusing James's command that the accused accept bail, which &#145;may be prejudicial to us&#146;  (Tindal Hart, 105&#150;6): of all the bishops, it was Lloyd's attitude that made it impossible to maintain the claim put forward in the petition composed by Sancroft that they proceeded from no &#145;want of duty and obedience to your majesty&#146;  (Tindal Hart, 97). Indeed, by the time of his imprisonment in the Tower, which he shared with his brethren from 8 June, Lloyd may already having been looking towards an Orange regime&#151;with an overthrow of popery, church reform, and an overture to the protestant dissenters. London's popular anti-popery unerringly centred on Lloyd as its chief hero among the bishops, singling him out for acclamation when the seven were bailed on 5 June. Regularly linking up with Clarendon in London, Lloyd followed the acquittal of the bishops in king's bench on 30 June by returning to his diocese.<h2>
<a name="Therevolution"></a>The revolution</h2>By 7 October Lloyd was back in the capital, conferring with Clarendon but having kept away from discussions between James and the other bishops which were intended to produce concessions on James's part in the light of Orange's impending invasion. In November, though, he was active in promoting a petition to James to summon a free parliament, a plea that the king found unacceptable. The day after James's departure on 10 December, Lloyd was a signatory to an address drawn up at the London Guildhall and appealing to Orange to &#145;rescue the nation&#146;  (Tindal Hart, 115), and in December 1688 (when he was acting as an intermediary between Orange and the bishops) and January 1689, increasingly under the influence of Gilbert Burnet, he was becoming convinced that, in departing, James had forfeited his throne. Even so, he seems to have been absent from the vote in the Lords on 29 January on whether to confer the crown or a regency on James's behalf on William and Mary of Orange. He was hedging his bets in the early weeks of the year, but by mid-February he was commenting on Orange as a kind of acceptable usurper; he soon took the oaths of allegiance to the new sovereigns and began to commend them vigorously to other clergy. Lloyd attended the coronation and performed the absent Sancroft's primatial task of announcing Mary as queen to the congregation. His appointment as lord high almoner to Mary put him in charge of dispensing her charity to claimants, especially the still long queue of civil war victims. He went on to honour his standing commitment to an understanding with the nonconformists by helping to prepare a bill of comprehension (which was aborted). If Lloyd had had any reservations about an Orange settlement, he overcame them decisively once it was achieved and, although late in 1689 and early in 1690 he was trying to find a formula to keep the nonjuring clergy in post, he represented one of the polarized wings in a now politically much divided Church of England. Although into the early 1690s he continued to try to persuade colleagues to accept the new king and queen his participation in the consecration on 31 May 1691 of John Tillotson in succession to the displaced nonjuror Sancroft confirmed his breach with the elements of the church that distrusted James's policies but acknowledged him as their irremovable king. He shored up his rejection of James by an absolute disbelief in the legitimacy of his son, born in June 1688.<br>
<br>Lloyd's many services to the king and queen, which included the publication of <span class="italic">A Discourse of God's Ways of Disposing of Kingdoms</span> (1691), a defence of the revolution, and of sermons which underlined the king's role as an agent of godly reformation, merited him appointment to the vacant see of Coventry and Lichfield, to which his appointment was confirmed in October 1692. He left St Asaph in a thoroughly reformed condition and applied to Coventry and Lichfield policies of friendship to dissenters but also, it was alleged, extreme, arbitrary, divisive, and bureaucratized discipline within the clergy and of litigious behaviour to the laity. And, whatever Lloyd's preference for using methods of persuasion and argument towards dissenters, he was acutely aware of the weakness of the established church's position after the <span class="roman">Toleration Act</span>. What was to be done where parishioners took their infants to be baptized by nonconformist ministers, he complained to his colleague Bishop Stillingfleet of Worcester. How was he to deal with the ministers? &#145;For to punish those Parishioners would be to drive them from the Church &amp; so to fill their Congregations&#146;  (Rose, 172&#150;3).<br>
<br>In April 1695 Lloyd was appointed to a new commission to advise William on crown appointments in the church and from 1697 (when he refused ordination to the future high tory tribune William Sacheverell) he took a leading part in the investigation of irregularities alleged against his successor at St Asaph, Thomas Jones, suspended from office in 1701. The deprivation from St David's of the opponent of the revolution Thomas Watson (1637&#150;1717) for alleged gross misconduct into which Lloyd had helped conduct enquiries, preceded by a few days Lloyd's own formal induction into his new see of Worcester on 8 August 1699.<h2>
<a name="BishopofWorcester"></a>Bishop of Worcester</h2>While the acquisition of wealthy Worcester (with remission of first fruits to the crown conceded by William III) represented the pinnacle of Lloyd's life as a clerical careerist, it was not necessarily the most suitable bishopric for him to serve. The new bishop may not have had insuperable problems with the dissenters of Worcestershire, who were especially entrenched in the county town, but he was less well adapted to the county's quite numerous Catholics, whose numbers were growing through conversions in the early eighteenth century. Even more ominously, Worcestershire, and especially its clergy, had marked high tory, and indeed Jacobite, leanings from which they were inclined to regard Lloyd&#151;despite his characteristically close attention to the physical, moral, and educational state of the diocese&#151;as a Williamite time-server and as one of the false brethren who betrayed the church to revolution principles. From his very entry into the diocese a lay inspirer of repudiation of him was the tory knight of the shire in parliament, Sir John Packington, who helped in the distribution of a bitter pamphlet attack on Lloyd. The latter retaliated in 1701 by co-ordinating a mass address of Worcestershire signatories pledging to eject Packington at the next general election. In 1702 it was reported that Lloyd &#145;charges his Clergy in his visitation every where, upon theyr canonicall obedience, not to give theyr votes for Sr J Pak&#146;  (Holmes, <span class="italic">British Politics</span>, 29), but the campaign, in the altered party political circumstances of the new reign of Anne, rebounded back on the bishop when the Commons denounced his &#145;malicious, unchristian and arbitrary&#146; interference in the election and successfully demanded his dismissal from the position of lord almoner.<br>
<br>Lloyd continued to campaign in Worcestershire elections, for example in 1707, while in 1710 he ordered his clergy to refrain from ringing church bells to mark the triumphant progress in the shire of Sacheverell (whom he came to fear would succeed him), but he was increasingly immersed in his long-standing study of biblical chronology and prophecy, relating texts of <span class="roman">Daniel</span> and <span class="roman">Revelation</span> to events taking place, and to be expected, in his own day. By that time this kind of speculation seemed an old-fashioned intellectual pursuit which tended to be ridiculed as &#145;but his dotages&#146; and he as &#145;Old Mysterio&#146;, a crazed, obsessed, and fanatical seer  (Tindal Hart, 236). Nevertheless Lloyd was both a profound scholar himself and an encourager of learning in others, as well as an active diocesan bishop and regular preacher. He died at Hartlebury Castle, Worcestershire, on 30 August 1717 and was buried on 10 September at the church of Fladbury, of which his son William was the incumbent.<br>
