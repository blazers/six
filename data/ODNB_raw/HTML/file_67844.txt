<span class="headword">Munro,  Robert</span>  (<em>c.</em>1645&#150;1704), <span class="occ">Roman Catholic priest</span>, was born in Ross-shire, the son of George Munro. After conversion to Roman Catholicism he entered the Scots College, Douai, on 17 May 1663, was at the Scots College, Paris, from February 1666 until February 1668, took the missionary oath at the Scots College, Rome, on 6 June 1668, and left Rome as a missionary priest in 1671.<br>
<br>Munro's priestly work was mainly in Strathglass and Glengarry, but missionary journeys took him to Moidart (1678), to the isles (1679), and to Knoydart (1688). His success at winning converts earned him criticism from the presbyteries of Dingwall and Inverness. In 1678 he accompanied Alexander Leslie on a visitation of the highlands and islands ordered in Rome by the Congregatio de Propaganda Fide. In the following year, against the wishes of Alexander Dunbar, prefect apostolic for Scotland, Munro joined the army of Lord MacDonnell of Glengarry against the earl of Argyll, who had been ordered to disarm papists, especially in the highlands. In 1688 Munro joined the Jacobite army as chaplain and was present at the battle of the Boyne. In 1696 he was arrested, imprisoned, and banished.<br>
<br>On his arrival on the continent Munro was imprisoned again, in Ghent, but was released through the efforts of Louis Innes and the Jesuits, and stayed for a short time at the Scots College, Paris. On his return to Scotland he was captured at sea, imprisoned at Plymouth and London, and banished again. Nevertheless he was soon back at his priestly labours in the Scottish highlands. In 1702 he subscribed to a letter of appeal against the Jesuits who had been accusing secular priests of Jansenism. In 1704 he was arrested, thrown across a horse as he was too ill to ride, and taken to Glengarry Castle where, left unattended for two days, he died on 17 January 1704, regarded as a martyr.<br>
