<span class="headword">Cordell, Sir  William</span>  (1522&#150;1581), <span class="occ">lawyer and speaker of the House of Commons</span>, was the eldest son of John Cordell, originally from Edmonton, who had become the principal servant to Sir William Clopton (<i>d</i>. 1531) of Kentwell in Long Melford, Suffolk, and Lincoln's Inn. His mother was Emma, daughter of Henry Webb of Kimbolton, Huntingdonshire. He was probably brought up in Clopton's household, and sent to Lincoln's Inn through his influence. A William Cordall was admitted to Gray's Inn in 1534, but can hardly have been the same person. The future master of the rolls was only sixteen when he joined Lincoln's Inn in 1538, and was called to the bar while still very young in 1544. He became a bencher in 1553 and gave a reading in 1554. Besides his extensive private practice, he was a founder member of the Russia Company, and his standing in society became sufficient to require a grant of arms for his father in 1548 and another for himself (quartering Webb) in 1549.<br>
<br>Cordell's election to the bench of his inn coincided with his appointment as solicitor-general to Mary I in 1553, a position that he held until 1557 when he became master of the rolls and a member of the privy council. He served in five parliaments between 1545 and 1571, and was speaker in 1558, when the queen knighted him. He was executor to Queen Mary, to Cardinal Pole, and to Archbishop Parker. Elizabeth I did not include him in her reduced privy council, but he continued as master of the rolls until his death in 1581.<br>
<br>Cordell married Mary (<i>d</i>. 1584), granddaughter of his father's master, being the daughter of Richard Clopton of Groton, and was able to buy the manor of Long Melford for himself from the crown in 1554. There he built Melford Hall, which was completed in 1559 and where he received Elizabeth I in 1578. However, he left no surviving children of his own. He founded a hospital of the Holy Trinity at Long Melford, and supported the foundation of St John's College, Oxford, of which he was the first visitor.<br>
<br>Cordell was responsible for a set of chancery ordinances in 1574, and for reorganizing the six clerks in 1578, but a historian has described his tenure as &#145;a praiseworthy record of competence&#146; in contrast with the more enthusiastic tenure of Sir Thomas Egerton at the end of the century. Egerton was later to complain that Cordell had surrendered the House of Converts to the crown, and given up some rights of the office in connection with the public records. Cordell died at The Rolls in Chancery Lane on 17 May 1581, and was buried in Long Melford church, where there is an alabaster effigy in armour. There is also a three-quarter length portrait in Melford Hall, which shows that he had a short face with reddish hair and beard. He left numerous small charitable bequests including &pound;20 to be distributed among the poor scholars of Cambridge and Oxford &#145;unto suche as be moste towardes in vertewe and learninge&#146;. His legacies included a jewel with a unicorn's horn, which he settled to go in succession, and a book on parchment &#145;conteyninge a matter betweene King Henrie the seaventhe and Edmonde Dudley esquier&#146;, which he left to Sir William Cecil. His executors were his sister Jane (<i>d</i>. 1604), George Carew, and his brother Edward (<i>d</i>. 1594), a six clerk in Chancery. On the failure of his issue, his lands were inherited by Jane, who married Richard Allington.<br>
