<span class="headword">Chant <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Dibbin]</span>,  Laura Ormiston</span>  (1848&#150;1923), <span class="occ">author and political activist</span>, was born on 9 October 1848 at Woolaston, Gloucestershire, near Chepstow, daughter of Francis William Dibbin, civil engineer, and his wife, Sophia Ormiston. Educated at home, she later became an associate of arts at Apothecaries' Hall. She worked as a schoolteacher, a hospital nurse, and as assistant manager of a lunatic asylum before marrying Thomas Chant (<i>d</i>. 1913), a surgeon, on 13 September 1877; he was the son of Joseph Chant, builder. The couple had one son and three daughters.<br>
<br>Laura Chant is best known for her public advocacy of the causes of women's suffrage, temperance, and social purity, though her early association with nursing played an important role throughout her life. She was awarded the red cross by the Greek royal family for her work accompanying British nurses to the Greek frontier and to Crete, and also travelled to Bulgaria to do relief work among Armenian refugees, presumably in the late 1870s. A Liberal politically, she was a member of the Women's Liberal Federation and vice-president of the Peace Society. She was also a founder member of the National Society for the Promotion of Women's Suffrage, and sat on the executive committee of the Society for Promoting the Return of Women Poor Law Guardians. She was also a member of the Social Purity Alliance and was active in the 1890s in opposing the implementation of a <span class="roman">Contagious Diseases Act</span> in Guernsey. She was an active member of the Ladies' National Association for the Repeal of the Contagious Diseases Acts and one of the National Vigilance Association's earliest supporters, editing its house journal, the <span class="italic">Vigilance Record</span>.<br>
<br>Perhaps Chant's most famous campaign was that against what she perceived to be the runaway immorality associated with the music-hall tradition. In October 1894 she attended the meeting of the licensing committee of the London county council in order to challenge the renewal of the licence of the Empire Theatre of Varieties in Leicester Square, which she claimed allowed both indecent performances involving scantily clad women and disorderly conduct in the auditorium, since prostitutes were allowed to ply their trade within the establishment. Though this was the first time that Chant had taken steps to close such a theatre, she had contributed a regular column entitled &#145;Amused London&#146; to the <span class="italic">Vigilance Record</span> in 1888 and 1889, recording her visits to London's music-hall and variety shows. The committee upheld Chant's complaint against the Empire music-hall, insisting on a number of changes before the licence could be renewed, a decision which was not received favourably by the general public or by the satirical magazine <span class="italic">Punch</span>, which promptly dubbed Chant Mrs Prowlina Pry. Feminist activists, too, were divided over Chant's actions, and indeed over the work and philosophy of the National Vigilance Association with which she was so closely associated. Though her offensive was initially successful, the Empire was quickly restored to its former condition and was granted a licence without hitch the following year. In 1895 she published a pamphlet defending her actions entitled <span class="italic">Why we Attacked the Empire</span>. She also contributed an article, &#145;Women and the streets&#146;, to James Marchant's volume on vice, <span class="italic">The Master Problem</span> (1917).<br>
<br>Chant was a practising Congregationalist and a member of the British Women's Temperance Association. She advocated the introduction of women preachers and published a book of short sermons. A popular and active lecturer on a variety of topics from women's suffrage and temperance to the importance of gymnastics, she was also a prolific writer and composer. She wrote pamphlets on social purity, temperance, and the poor law, published a novel, <span class="italic">Sellcuts' Manager</span> (1899), and two volumes of poetry, <span class="italic">Verona and other Poems</span> (1887) and <span class="italic">A Merry Christmas</span> (1910). She also wrote many songs and hymns as well as short stories. An honorary member of two American women's clubs, the New England Women's Club and the Women's Club of Chicago, Chant was, in her spare time, a keen billiard player.<br>
<br>Much of Chant's adult life was spent at The Homestead, Pinvin, Pershore. She died at home at 41 Bloxham Road, Banbury, Oxfordshire, on 16 February 1923 of cerebral haemorrhage and heart failure.<br>
