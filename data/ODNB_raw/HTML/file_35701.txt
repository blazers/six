<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Redmayne, Sir  Richard Augustine Studdert</span>  (1865&#150;1955), <span class="occ">mining engineer</span>, was born at South Dene, Low Fell, co. Durham, on 22 July 1865, the fourth son of John Marriner Redmayne, alkali manufacturer, and his wife, Jane Anna Fitzgerald Studdert. Educated privately and at the Durham College of Science, Newcastle upon Tyne, he became an articled apprentice of William Armstrong, a prominent north-country mining engineer, and was trained at Hetton Collieries, co. Durham. There he rose to be an under-manager, before leaving for South Africa in 1891, where he spent two years managing collieries and making reports and surveys on mining properties in Natal. He returned to England in 1894, and became the resident manager at Seaton Delaval Collieries, Northumberland. In 1898 he married Edith Rose (<i>d</i>. 1942), daughter of Thomas Picton Richards, shipowner, of Swansea; they had one son, John, and two daughters.<br>
<br>In 1902 Redmayne was appointed professor of mining at the newly created University of Birmingham. The mining industry at that time laid less stress on university education than on apprenticeship or practical experience, supplemented by education at local technical colleges. Redmayne studied the methods followed by advanced mining schools in North America, where in laboratory, classroom, and field, the conditions were simulated in which the student would later work professionally. With these in mind, Redmayne organized a mining department which, for the first time in Britain, included an ore-dressing laboratory and a model underground coalmine, where practical problems could be studied. His pioneer work greatly encouraged higher education and training for mining engineers.<br>
<br>Redmayne served as a mining expert on a number of official inquiries into the organization and safety procedures of the coal industry. In 1906 he was a member of the committee which inquired into the economic effect of an eight-hour working day for coalminers. Following the committee's recommendation, the government introduced the <span class="roman">Eight Hour Act</span>. In 1908 Redmayne became chairman of the royal commission appointed to study the causes and prevention of accidents in mines arising from falls of ground, underground transport, and in shafts: its main recommendations were subsequently incorporated in legislation. In the same year Redmayne was appointed a commissioner to inquire into a disaster at Hamstead colliery and between 1908 and 1913 he conducted similar inquiries at Maypole, West Stanley, Wellington, Hulton, Cadeby, and Senghenydd collieries into disasters which caused a loss of 1250 lives. He was knighted in 1914.<br>
<br>Redmayne resigned his professorship in 1908 to join the Home Office as the first chief inspector of mines in Britain. His primary responsibility was for safety in the mining industry, and involved supervising the work of district inspectors of mines, advising the secretary of state on mining matters, conducting inquiries into accidents in mines, and editing the annual report on mines and quarries. One of his most notable contributions as chief inspector was his work with Sir Malcolm Delevingne on the framing of the comprehensive <span class="roman">Coal Mines Act</span> of 1911 which enforced higher standards of safety in mines. From 1917 to 1919 he was chief technical adviser to the controller of coalmines, and in 1919 he acted as assessor to Sir John Sankey, chairman of the royal commission on coalmines.<br>
<br>In 1919 Redmayne resigned from his post as chief inspector in order to devote himself to the work of the Imperial Mineral Resources Bureau (amalgamated in 1925 with the Imperial Institute), of which he was chairman from 1918 until 1935, and to practise as a consulting engineer. Chairman of the board for mining examinations from its inception in 1912 until 1950, he also became, in 1922, the first president of the Institution of Professional Civil Servants, an office to which he was re-elected annually until his death. He played an active part in the work of professional engineering institutions, and was elected honorary member of the Institution of Mining Engineers in 1909, president of the Institution of Mining and Metallurgy in 1916, and president of the Institution of Civil Engineers in 1934&#150;5. During the 1930s Redmayne held a number of senior non-executive appointments. He was the independent chairman of the national conciliation board on road motor haulage (1934&#150;8), and also acted as chairman of the road haulage wages board from 1938 until 1941.<br>
<br>An able administrator and speaker, a man of fine presence, tact, and charm, Redmayne also enjoyed the confidence of the miners with whom his work brought him into contact. Possessing a keen sense of humour, he was a superb teller of stories in the Tyneside dialect. He also made numerous contributions to professional and technical journals and was the author of several authoritative books on mining. He was the co-author of <span class="italic">Colliery Working and Management</span>, first published in 1896, which became a standard work; and also of <span class="italic">Modern Practice in Mining</span> (5 vols., 1908&#150;32). His autobiography, <span class="italic">Men, Mines and Memories</span> (1942), throws interesting light on little-known aspects of British industrial life. He died, aged ninety, at his home, Lodge Farm, Little Hadham, Hertfordshire, on 27 December 1955.<br>
