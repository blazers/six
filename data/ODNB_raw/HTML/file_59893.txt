<span class="headword">Buck,  Adam</span>  (1759&#150;1833), <span class="occ">miniature and portrait painter</span>, was born in Castle Street, Cork, the elder son of Jonathan Buck (1729/30&#150;1786), a silversmith, of Castle Street, and his wife, Elizabeth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Sydney (<i>d</i>. 1817). <a href="#cosubject_59893">Frederick Buck [<i>see below</i>]</a> was his younger brother. His artistic training remains obscure but an anonymously published article in volume 26 of the <span class="italic">Journal of the Cork Historical and Archaeological Society</span> (1920) records that he studied under a little-known artist called Minasi. However, Anthony Pasquin states that he was self-taught  (Pasquin, 41).<br>
<br>By the 1780s Buck was well established in Ireland as a miniature portrait painter working in watercolour on ivory. He lived in Cork and later moved to Dublin but travelled about the country for commissions. He specialized in painting small, whole-length portraits in watercolour on card, a type of portrait he popularized. He also did portraits on card with a special wax crayon which he invented. His early portraits, such as his group portrait in watercolour on paper of the Edgeworth family (1787, priv. coll.; exh. Dublin, Belfast, and London 1969&#150;70) and the miniatures of the Ellis family (National Gallery of Ireland, Dublin), show that he had evolved his own decorative neo-classical style early in his career. This was commented on by Pasquin, who may have known Buck when he was in Ireland. In an account of Buck's life, written along with a note on beauty, Pasquin stated: &#145;He [Buck] appears to study the antique more rigorously than any of our emerging artists and by that means he will imbibe a chastity of thinking, which may eventually lead him to the personification of apparent beauty&#146;  (Pasquin, 41).<br>
<br>In 1795 Buck moved permanently to London, where he lived at 174 Piccadilly (1795&#150;8), Frith Street, Soho (1799&#150;1802), and Bentinck Street (1813&#150;20). He married, on 15 November 1804, Margaret (1784&#150;1867), daughter of Sampson George, solicitor, of Middleton Tyas, Yorkshire. They had three sons and a daughter.<br>
<br>Buck had a fashionable clientele which included George IV, the duke of York, the duke's mistress Mary Anne Clarke, the opera singer Angelica Catalani, the politician Sir Francis Burdett, the art collector Thomas Hope (all National Portrait Gallery, London), the seventh earl and the countess of Cavan, Lady Chatterton, and the actor J. P. Kemble. He also taught drawing and portrait painting. From 1795 to 1833 he exhibited over 170 miniatures and small, full-length portraits at the Royal Academy. He also exhibited at the British Institution and the Society of British Artists in Suffolk Street. He only exhibited once in Ireland, in 1802, when he sent a portrait to the Society of Artists in Ireland exhibition at the parliament house, Dublin.<br>
<br>Buck influenced Regency taste through his work, which was engraved and widely published. He did fashion plates, produced decorative engravings, and did illustrations (1801) for Sterne's <span class="italic">Sentimental Journey</span>. The decorative pieces were fanciful genre pictures of mothers and children, personifications of Faith, Hope, and Charity, and classical subjects such as Cupid and Psyche. Sentimental figurative pieces were used to decorate furniture and were adapted as designs for the decoration of china, embroidery, and fans.<br>
<br>Buck was greatly influenced by the Greek Revival and he included Greek vases and sculpture, as well as Greek-inspired furniture, in his portraits. His sitters wear high-waisted muslin dresses and have curly hair-styles <i>&agrave; la grecque</i>. He was a collector of Greek vases and was familiar with private collections which he used as devices in his work, as in his <span class="italic">Self-Portrait with his Family</span> (Yale U. CBA).<br>
<br>Buck published a prospectus for a book on Greek vase painting: <span class="italic">Proposals for publishing by subscription 100 engravings from paintings on Greek vases which have never been published, drawn and etched by Adam Buck from private collections now in England, dedicated to the earl of Carlisle</span> (1811). This publication was intended as a continuation of Sir William Hamilton's <span class="italic">Collection of Engravings from Ancient Vases &hellip;</span> (1791&#150;7) and the prints were to be issued in fascicules of ten, over a period of one year. Public interest must have been slight, as only one instalment of ten etched outlines seems to have been issued (on 31 March 1812), and contrary to almost all accounts of Buck's life the book <span class="italic">Paintings on Greek Vases</span> was never published. The only recorded copy of the prospectus is in the British Museum. The drawings and aquatint engravings for the unpublished book are in the Library of Trinity College, University of Dublin.<br>
<br>Adam Buck died in August 1833 at his home in Ebury Street, Pimlico, London. He was survived by his wife and their four children. His third son, Sydney Buck (1816&#150;1899), also became a miniature painter. A miniature self-portrait by Buck is in the Victoria and Albert Museum, London; other work is in the collections of the National Gallery of Ireland, Dublin; the British Museum, National Portrait Gallery, and Kenwood House (the Draper gift), London; the Yale Center for British Art, New Haven, Connecticut; the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York; and the Art Institute of Chicago.<br>
<br>Adam Buck's brother <a name="cosubject_59893"></a><span class="headword">Frederick Buck</span>  (1771&#150;1840), born in Cork, was also a <span class="occ">miniature painter</span>. He was admitted as a pupil to the Dublin Society's drawing school in 1782. He practised over a long period as a miniature painter in Cork, where he executed many portraits of officers prior to their embarkation on ships bound for the Peninsular War. His work is inferior to that of his brother, the features often badly drawn and modelled; this is probably the result of their being imposed on partly painted ivories to which he hastily added faces and regimental facings. He also engraved some book-plates. He married twice: first, on 9 February 1796, to Elizabeth Reilly, with whom he had at least two daughters and one son; and, second, on 21 October 1816, to Harriet Mahony Craig (<i>d</i>. 1870), with whom he had at least one daughter and six sons. Successful in his work, Buck retired some years before his death in Cork on 7 September 1840. Examples of his miniatures are in the Victoria and Albert Museum, London, and the National Gallery of Ireland, Dublin.<br>
