<span class="headword">Webbe,  William</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1566?&#150;1591), <span class="occ">author</span>, is known chiefly for his <span class="italic">A discourse of English poetrie, together with the authors judgment, touching the reformation of our English verse</span>, published in 1586; little is known of his life. A letter by Webbe addressed to Robert Wilmott, prefacing the latter's 1591 printed edition of an Inner Temple play, <span class="italic">Tancred and Gismund</span>, implies that Webbe was present at its performance before the queen, probably in 1566. He is probably the William Webbe who graduated BA from St John's College, Cambridge, in 1572/3, in the same year as Edmund Spenser, although from a different college. In <span class="italic">A Discourse</span>, Webbe draws extensively and admiringly upon <span class="italic">The Shepheardes Calendar</span> (published anonymously in 1579) and demonstrates that he knows the identity of its author. He refers admiringly to the discussion of quantitative metres in the correspondence between Spenser and Gabriel Harvey which appeared as <span class="italic">Three Proper and Wittie Familiar Letters</span> and <span class="italic">Two other Very Commendable Letters</span> in 1580. However, <span class="italic">A Discourse</span> does not suggest any intimate acquaintance between Webbe and Spenser or Harvey.<br>
<br>Webbe's <span class="italic">Discourse</span> yields some clues about his career. It is dedicated to &#145;my verie good Master, Ma. Edward Suliard, Esquire&#146; who resided at Flemyngs, a large house in the parish of Runwell, in the hundred of Chelmsford, Essex. Webbe indicates that he was employed as tutor to Sulyard's two sons, Edward and Thomas, and refers on a number of occasions to his manuscript translation into quantitative verse of the <span class="italic">Georgics</span> which he presented to Sulyard. By 1591, the date of his letter to Wilmott, Webbe was living, possibly also as a tutor, at Pirgo, in the parish of Havering atte Bower, Essex, a house owned by Henry Grey, a relative by marriage of the Sulyards. <span class="italic">Tancred and Gismund</span> was partly dedicated by Wilmott to Lady Anne Grey, wife of Henry Grey. Nothing further is known of Webbe's life.<br>
<br>In his dedication to Edward Sulyard, Webbe describes himself as a scholar &#145;never acquainted with the learned Muses&#146;  (<span class="italic">Discourse</span>, 15). While this should be understood as a modest disclaimer, it does convey the limitations of Webbe's treatise. His enthusiasm for applying the rules of classical quantitative metres to the writing of a &#145;reformed&#146; English verse should be understood in the context of contemporary scholarly attitudes. In <span class="italic">The Scholemaster</span> (1570), Roger Ascham scorned &#145;barbarous and rude Ryming&#146; and advocated &#145;trew versifying&#146; in English, that is, unrhymed verse written to classical metrical rules  (Smith, 1.29&#150;30). Ascham's view was shared by many for whom classical models formed the sole standard and rhyming verse was the product of mere ignorance and laziness. Webbe shared these views, but was more discriminating about contemporary verse. He parodied the technique of popular ballads: &#145;an Alehouse song of five or sixe score verses, hobbling uppon some tune of a Northern Jigge, or Robyn hoode &hellip; and there withal an A to make a jerke in the ende&#146; (Smith, 1.246; see also <span class="italic">Handefull</span>, 100&#150;01). On the other hand, in a survey of English verse, he cited with approval any contemporary rhyming verse that demonstrated learnedness or laid claim to moral seriousness, above all, Edmund Spenser whose <span class="italic">Shepheardes Calendar</span> would, were it not for the imperfectness of English, rival Virgil and Theocritus in skill  (Smith, 1.263).<br>
<br>A small black-lettered tract entitled <span class="italic">The Touchstone of Wittes</span>, chiefly compiled, with some slender additions, from William Webbe's <span class="italic">Discourse of English Poetry</span>, and written by Edward Hake, was reported by Thomas Warton in the eighteenth century, but no copy is known to be extant.<br>
