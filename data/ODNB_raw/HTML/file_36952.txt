</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Wilson,  Edward Adrian</span>  (1872&#150;1912), <span class="occ">Antarctic explorer and naturalist</span>, was born on 23 July 1872 at 6 Montpellier Terrace, Cheltenham, the second son and fifth child of the nine surviving children of Dr Edward Thomas Wilson FRCP (1832&#150;1918), physician, and his wife, Mary Agnes (1841&#150;1930), daughter of Bernhard Whishaw and his wife, Elizabeth. On his father's side he was descended from a long line of Quakers, the last of whom was his grandfather Edward Wilson (1772&#150;1843), of Liverpool and Philadelphia, who acquired great wealth through land in the United States and early railways in Lancashire. His mother's family came from Cheshire, some of whom lived in St Petersburg as traders in the earlier nineteenth century. In September 1874 the family moved from Montpellier Terrace to a larger house, Westal, on Montpellier Parade.<br>
<br>Edward Wilson showed an early talent for drawing and an interest in the natural world, fostered by long walks in the Cotswold and Malvern hills and life on his mother's small farm near Cheltenham, where she bred poultry and grew apples and pears. He was educated first at home, and then became a pupil at Glengarth preparatory school, Cheltenham, in 1879. In 1884 he went away to Wilkinson's preparatory school at Clifton, Bristol, but entered Cheltenham College as a day boy in 1886, leaving there to go up to Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, as an exhibitioner in October 1891. During his schooldays his interest in wildlife grew until he became an observant field naturalist, with an ability to sketch what he saw.<br>
<br>At Cambridge Wilson read for the natural sciences tripos, gaining a first in part one in 1894, and the medical examinations. He took his BA degree in 1894 and his MB in 1900, after studying at St George's Hospital, London. In 1898 and 1899 Wilson spent some months in Switzerland and Norway to fight off an attack of tuberculosis, probably caused by the strain of his medical studies, his frugal existence, and by his voluntary work for the Caius College mission in the slums of Battersea, London. It was there that he first met Oriana Fanny Souper (1876&#150;1945), daughter of the rector of Hilton, near Huntingdon, whom he married on 16 July 1901.<br>
<br>Since his election as president of the Royal Geographical Society in 1893, Sir Clements Markham had been promoting the dispatch of an expedition, preferably naval, to resume the exploration of the Antarctic regions, some fifty years after the remarkable discoveries of Sir James Clark Ross. His efforts were eventually successful and resulted in the national Antarctic expedition, 1901&#150;4, commanded by Captain Robert Falcon Scott RN. Wilson was provisionally appointed to serve as second surgeon, artist, and vertebrate zoologist in January 1901, and sailed for the Antarctic in the <i>Discovery</i> in August of that year, three weeks after his marriage. During the months before departure, he learned taxidermy at the British Museum (Natural History) and wrote up part of the zoological results of the <i>Southern Cross</i> Antarctic expedition (1898&#150;1900) from seal skins and skeletons there.<br>
<br>Wilson was prominent in the national Antarctic expedition, whose main achievements were to make the first extensive inland explorations of Antarctica, and to fulfil a comprehensive scientific programme. Besides collecting, he made drawings and watercolours of the landscape, seals, and birds, many of which were exhibited at the Bruton Galleries, Bond Street, in 1904. He illustrated the <span class="italic">South Polar Times</span> and took part in the southern journey (1902&#150;3) with Scott and Shackleton. On his return to England in 1904 he spent some time writing up his observations, and published the reports on birds and mammals in the scientific results of the expedition. His remarkable panoramas of the mountains bordering the Ross Ice Shelf were printed in a portfolio with the results. He had been much impressed in 1904 with the rapidly disappearing native fauna and flora of New Zealand and would have liked an appointment there either to survey and depict New Zealand wildlife or as caretaker of the two sanctuary islands of Kapiti and Little Barrier. Neither of these ideas came to anything and in 1905 he was appointed field observer, physiologist, and anatomist to the newly established grouse disease inquiry, which had been set up by the British Board of Agriculture and Fisheries to ascertain the cause of death of numerous game birds. He spent several years in hard fieldwork on the moors of Scotland and England and in painstaking laboratory work, dissecting nearly 2000 of the diseased birds. He wrote one third of the report and made all its illustrations. He also illustrated a revised edition of Bell's <span class="italic">British Mammals</span> and made many plates for a similar volume of Yarrell's <span class="italic">British Birds</span>, which was never published.<br>
<br>In June 1910 Wilson sailed again for the Antarctic in the <i>Terra Nova</i>, this time as head of the scientific staff of the British Antarctic (<i>Terra Nova</i>) expedition, also under the command of Captain Scott. The expedition was based as before in McMurdo Sound and was planned to continue and enlarge the studies and explorations begun during the <i>Discovery</i> expedition, including, it was hoped, the attainment of the south pole. In addition to supervising the first-class scientific work, sketching, and collecting, Wilson made a special study of the development of the emperor penguin chick. He led a midwinter sortie to the emperor penguin rookery at Cape Crozier in June 1911, which he had first visited in September 1903. This extraordinary venture was later vividly described by Apsley Cherry-Garrard in <span class="italic">The Worst Journey in the World</span>, and earlier in Wilson's report, and the <span class="italic">South Polar Times</span>. Known on this expedition as &#145;Uncle Bill&#146;, he was held by its members, as in the <i>Discovery</i>, in special regard and affection.<br>
<br>The sledge journey to the south pole began in November 1911. Wilson was one of the five men who made the final push to reach 90&deg; S, only to find there the black marker flag of Roald Amundsen, who had earlier achieved the goal. The story of the struggle back (long known from Scott's diaries) has now largely been published in Wilson's own words. Edgar Evans and Lawrence Oates died during the march; Scott, Wilson, and Henry Robertson Bowers died on or about 29 March 1912 in their tent on the Great Ice Barrier, where their bodies were found by a search party eight months later. The burial service was read on 11 November 1912 by Edward Atkinson over the three bodies in the tent, which was left to be covered by the snow.<br>
<br>In Scott's diary was the following letter to Mrs Wilson:<blockquote>If this letter reaches you Bill and I will have gone out together. We are very near it now and I should like you to know how splendid he was at the end&#151;everlastingly cheerful and ready to sacrifice himself for others, never a word of blame to me for leading him into this mess. He is not suffering, luckily, at least only minor discomforts.<br>
<br>His eyes have a comfortable blue look of hope and his mind is peaceful with the satisfaction of his faith regarding himself as part of the great scheme of the Almighty. I can do no more to comfort you than to tell you that he died as he lived, a brave, true man&#151;the best of comrades and staunchest of friends. (quoted in Seaver, <span class="italic">Edward Wilson of the Antarctic</span>, 291)</blockquote>Wilson's last letters to Oriana (and to his parents) expressed his faith in God and his regret at causing sorrow by his death:<blockquote>God be with you in your trouble, dear, when I have gone &hellip; All is for the best to those that love God, and oh, my Ory, we have both loved Him with all our lives. All is well &hellip;<br>
<br>We have struggled to the end and we have nothing to regret. Our whole journey record is clean, and Scott's diary gives the account &hellip; The Barrier has beaten us though we got to the Pole.<br>
<br>My beloved wife, these are small things, life itself is a small thing to me now, but my love for you is for ever and a part of our love for God &hellip; All is well. (quoted in Seaver, <span class="italic">Edward Wilson of the Antarctic</span>, 294)</blockquote>With the publication of Seaver's three books (1933&#150;48) Wilson acquired many admirers of his life, faith, and work. At the end of the twentieth century he became linked more broadly to the worldwide conservation movement, through his influence on Captain Scott, and indirectly upon Scott's son, Peter Markham Scott, who became a founder of the World Wildlife Fund.<br>
