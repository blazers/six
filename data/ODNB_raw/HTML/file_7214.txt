<span class="headword">Davidson,  Harriet  Miller</span>  (1839&#150;1883), <span class="occ">writer</span>, was born on 25 November 1839 at Cromarty, Scotland, the second but eldest surviving child of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18723/', "Hugh Miller (1802&#150;1856)")</script> and his wife, Lydia Falconer Fraser [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18732/', "Miller, Lydia Mackenzie Falconer (bap. 1812, d. 1876)")</script>]. She had two brothers, the elder of whom was three years her junior. While Hugh Miller, the son of a shipowner who had served in the British navy, had received no formal training in science, he was a self-taught expert in geology, and during his daughter's childhood he became a popular writer and lecturer. Lydia Miller, who shared her husband's intellectual interests, was a teacher and writer, and published a novel, <span class="italic">Passages in the Life of an English Heiress</span>, in 1847. Harriet Miller, who is said to have been a very beautiful and highly gifted child, with a remarkable talent for improvisation in verse and song, was educated at Edinburgh, where she won a prize for poetry  (Allen, 107), and London, where she travelled with her parents. Her life changed dramatically when on Christmas eve 1856 her father, who had been subject to fits of severe anxiety and depression for several years, committed suicide in what was described in the post-mortem report as an &#145;impulse of insanity&#146;  (<span class="italic">Scottish Nation</span>, 3.167). According to Margaret Allen, Hugh Miller's suicide &#145;always haunted&#146; his daughter and &#145;the remembrance of it visited her again and again&#146;  (Allen, 107). None the less, Miller continued her London education in the years following her father's death. On 14 April 1863 she married the Revd John Davidson (1834/5&#150;1881), minister of the Free Church of Scotland at Langholm in Dumfriesshire.<br>
<br>Davidson began her literary career by contributing poems to local journals, but she soon turned to fiction. The British Library catalogue attributes the anonymous <span class="italic">Lines for Little Life</span> (1856) and <span class="italic">The Two Babies</span> (1859) to her, but the attribution is almost certainly incorrect, as the latter, published four years before Davidson's marriage, proclaims itself to be &#145;by a Mother&#146; and is signed with the initials H. D. Davidson's first novel, <span class="italic">Isobel Jardine's History</span>, is a temperance tale and was published under the auspices of the Scottish Temperance League in 1867. This story was very popular and ran through several editions. An advertisement for a later edition quotes <span class="italic">The Scotsman</span> as observing that while many &#145;would be inclined off-hand to dismiss a work put out by a Temperance League&#146;, the work transcended its didactic purpose and could be read for its &#145;simple and attractive&#146; style and its &#145;naturally sketched&#146; characters  (Davidson, 331). <span class="italic">Christian Osborne's Friends</span> (1869) followed, a story suggesting several references to Davidson's seafaring ancestors.<br>
<br>In 1869 Davidson emigrated to Australia with her husband, who had been appointed minister of Chalmers's Church in Adelaide, South Australia. He was later appointed to a chair in English literature and mental philosophy at the University of Adelaide. For a time Harriet Davidson ran a small private school at her house in Adelaide, and she also became a contributor to the local newspapers, publishing articles, poems, and stories until shortly before her death. Among these stories she considered <span class="italic">A Man of Genius</span>&#151;a temperance tale serialized in the <span class="italic">Adelaide Observer</span>, but not subsequently reprinted&#151;the best of her prose writings. <span class="italic">Sir Gilbert's Children</span>, the last of her stories, was left unfinished, but was completed from her instructions to a friend. Margaret Allen sees both these novels as quasi-autobiographical; long after Hugh Miller's suicide, Davidson continued to explore the subject of daughters abandoned by brilliant, charismatic fathers  (Allen, 115&#150;16, 122). Davidson also contributed to <span class="italic">Chambers's Journal</span>, where &#145;Daisy's Choice&#146; appeared in 1870, and &#145;The Hamiltons&#146;, a story of Australian life, in 1878. Her short stories were never collected, and none of her writing has been republished since the nineteenth century. Harriet Davidson was in a precarious state of health from at least 1877, when she visited Europe for medical treatment, and from 1880 she was a confirmed invalid. She died in Adelaide on 20 December 1883.<br>
