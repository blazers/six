<span class="headword">Plimmer,  Robert Henry Aders</span>  (1877&#150;1955), <span class="occ">biochemist</span>, was born at Elberfeld, Germany, on 25 April 1877, the eldest son of Alfred Aders (<i>d</i>. 1885), a Manchester businessman, and his German wife and first cousin, Bertha Helena Aders. The child was brought to England when a few months old, and soon afterwards the Aders settled in Surrey on the southern outskirts of London. Alfred Aders died in 1885 and in 1887 his widow married Henry George Plimmer FRS (1857&#150;1918), who later became professor of comparative pathology at Imperial College. By example and advice Plimmer greatly influenced the lives and characters of the Aders children, especially the eldest son, who later acknowledged his indebtedness by adopting the surname of Plimmer by the wish of his stepfather.<br>
<br>Educated at Dulwich College and University College, London, where he studied chemistry under William Ramsay, Plimmer graduated BSc in 1899; then, on his stepfather's advice, turned his attention to the chemistry of living organisms. A year at Geneva University was followed by two years at Berlin University under Emil Fischer, where began his lifelong interest in the chemistry of proteins. He obtained a PhD (Berlin) and DSc (London) in 1902, and was awarded a Grocers' Company research studentship which enabled him to work for two years at the Lister Institute of Preventive Medicine. His work in Germany was summarized in his book <span class="italic">The Chemical Changes and Products Resulting from Fermentations</span> (1903).<br>
<br>In 1904 Plimmer returned to University College as an assistant in the department of physiology under W. M. Bayliss, and E. H. Starling. His duties were to teach physiological chemistry and to engage in research. He soon became well known in both spheres. Practical notes for his students developed into a textbook of <span class="italic">Organic and Bio-Chemistry</span> (1915) and his contributions to scientific journals drew attention to his researches into the chemistry of proteins. With Frederick Gowland Hopkins he was co-editor of an extremely valuable series of monographs on biochemistry to which he himself contributed <span class="italic">The Chemical Constitution of the Proteins</span> (1908).<br>
<br>Plimmer was elected a fellow of University College in 1906, assistant professor of physiological chemistry in 1907, and university reader in 1912. In the same year he married Violet Geraldine (<i>d</i>. 1949), daughter of Frederick Sheffield, solicitor; they had one son and three daughters.<br>
<br>Biochemists of Plimmer's generation remembered him with affection for the part he played in the founding of the Biochemical Society and in nursing it through the early difficult years. He and his friend J. A. Gardner were the co-founders in 1911 of the Biochemical Club, which became the society in 1913. Plimmer was the first secretary (1911&#150;19), was made an honorary member (1943), and wrote the <span class="italic">History of the Biochemical Society</span> (1949).<br>
<br>During the First World War, Plimmer, with the rank of captain, was attached to the directorate of hygiene at the War Office, and analysed common foodstuffs, the results being published in 1921 as <span class="italic">Analyses and Energy Values of Foods</span>. This work stimulated his interest in nutrition, and in 1919 he left University College to become head of the biochemical department at the Rowett Institute for Research in Animal Nutrition, Aberdeen, where he was able to take part in feeding experiments on a large scale. But in 1922 he returned to London as professor of chemistry at St Thomas's Hospital medical school, a position which he filled with great distinction for twenty-one years. He continued his research work with great vigour, producing a steady stream of papers. In addition to his teaching duties, examinerships, and service on numerous university boards and committees, he found time to give public lectures on topics such as diet and vitamins, and with his wife to write popular books on nutrition, balanced diets, vitamins, and the choice of foods.<br>
<br>Plimmer reached retirement age in 1942, when he was made honorary consulting chemist to the hospital; in 1944 the title of professor emeritus of chemistry was conferred upon him by the University of London. In January 1943 he joined the staff of the British Postgraduate Medical School, Hammersmith, to assist Professor E. J. King in the biochemistry department. It was intended to be a temporary appointment but lasted for more than twelve years.<br>
<br>A tall, lean figure, with strong, deeply lined face and kindly eyes beneath bushy eyebrows, Plimmer loved entertaining his many friends and enjoyed good music, art, literature, theatre, cricket, and motoring. He died in Hammersmith Hospital, London, on 18 June 1955.<br>
