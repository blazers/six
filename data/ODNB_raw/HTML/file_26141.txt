<span class="headword">Spender <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Headland]</span>,  Lily</span> <span class="st"> [<em>known as </em>Mrs John Kent Spender]</span>  (1835&#150;1895), <span class="occ">novelist</span>, was born in London on 22 February 1835, the second daughter of Edward Headland (1803&#150;1869), a well-known physician of Portland Place, London, and his wife, Eliza, a daughter of Ferdinand de Medina, a descendant of the Anglo-Dutch financier Sir Solomon de Medina, who was of Portuguese Jewish origin. Her given name at birth and baptism (at St Andrew's, Holborn, on 20 July 1835) was also Eliza, and she was recorded as such for official purposes during most of her life, though she became more widely known as Lily, a name she adopted as an author. She was educated privately for her first fourteen years and then attended classes at Queen's College, Harley Street, London. As a child she wrote rhymes and started a manuscript magazine with her friends. Until her marriage she studied French, German, and Italian at home and, with her brothers' help, Latin, Greek, and natural science.<br>
<br>On 28 October 1858 Eliza Headland married John Kent Spender (<i>d</i>. 1882), a physician and medical researcher who was attached to the Mineral Water Hospital in Bath, and she moved to Bath. It was then that she started writing&#151;as the Revd L. Spender&#151;and she sent essays to magazines, on German poets as well as on social issues such as women's employment and the evils of the imprisonment of children. She was a contributor to the <span class="italic">London Quarterly Review</span>, the <span class="italic">Englishwoman's Journal</span>, the <span class="italic">Dublin University Review</span>, and <span class="italic">Meliora</span>, a magazine concerned with social work. She worked on several committees for educational and social work in Bath and, for ten years, was the secretary of the Oxford examination for girls.<br>
<br>Lily Spender's first novel, <span class="italic">Brothers-in-Law</span> (1869), was written with a desire to provide an alternative to sensation fiction as well as to supplement the family income for her sons' education (she also sent one daughter to Somerville Hall at Oxford), family holidays, and her husband's early retirement. An early novel, <span class="italic">Parted Lives</span> (1873), was reviewed in <span class="italic">The Spectator</span> as the best novel of the year after George Eliot's <span class="italic">Middlemarch</span>, and most of her other novels received very favourable criticism. She wrote some twenty-one novels&#151;about one every year until her death&#151;in between housekeeping, raising her eight children, and various social service interests. <span class="italic">The Recollections of a Country Doctor</span> (1885) was based on her early experiences with her father. Later works such as <span class="italic">A Strange Temptation</span> (1893) and <span class="italic">A Modern Quixote</span> (1894) have leading characters of committed ideals, socialistic or otherwise, whose loyalty to friends leads them into serious difficulties in forming love relationships. Although intelligently written, her novels often have endings which fall into banal romance. They were, however, very popular and most went into several editions.<br>
<br>Lily Spender died at her home at 17 The Circus, Bath, on 4 May 1895. Two of her seven surviving children, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36213/', "John Alfred Spender (1862&#150;1942)")</script> and (Edward) Harold Spender (1864&#150;1926), were well-known London journalists. The poet Stephen Spender (1909&#150;1995) was her grandson.<br>
