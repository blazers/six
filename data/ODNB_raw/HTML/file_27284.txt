<span class="headword">Thompson,  William</span>  (1775&#150;1833), <span class="occ">socialist and economist</span>, was born into an ascendancy family at Cork. His grandfather was a protestant clergyman and his father, John Thompson, a wealthy Cork merchant who became speaker and mayor of the municipality and later high sheriff of the county. Thompson displayed an early interest in ideas of social improvement. He read the works of Godwin and Bentham and was exposed to the influence of continental writers such as Sismondi and St Simon during a period spent in France and the Low Countries. It was, no doubt, the articulation of the views of these writers in milieux such as the Cork Philosophical and Literary Society, of which Thompson was a prominent member, that led to his being branded locally as a &#145;red republican&#146;, and brought about an estrangement from his family. This radical reputation was further enhanced by his support for Christopher Hely Hutchinson, a candidate favouring Catholic emancipation, in the Cork elections of 1812 and 1826 and his championing of popular education in a pamphlet entitled <span class="italic">Practical Education for the South of Ireland</span>, which was published in 1818.<br>
<br>Thompson's concern with the iniquities of existing economic and social arrangements was also made apparent, although in a more practical manner, when, after the death of his father in 1814, he took over the management of the family's mercantile interests and in addition inherited an estate of some 1400 acres near Glandore in co. Cork. In Ireland these arrangements were characterized by absentee landlords, rapacious rack-renting agents, evictions, and, as a result, a poverty-stricken and disaffected peasantry. In contrast to contemporary practice, Thompson took an interest in his estate, giving his tenants long leases on favourable terms, encouraging the introduction of improved agricultural techniques, and establishing a model farm to illustrate best practice. Such actions established among the Catholic population of the area a long-lived reputation for kindness and fair dealing which persisted despite his professed atheism.<br>
<br>In 1819 Thompson was invited by Bentham, with whom he had corresponded on educational questions, to visit him at his home in Queen Square Place, Westminster, an invitation which he accepted in 1822, staying from 10 October until 22 February 1823. Here he met some of the leading utilitarians and political economists of the period, such as Robert Torrens, James Mill, John Black (editor of the <span class="italic">Morning Chronicle</span>), and John Bowring (editor of the <span class="italic">Westminster Review</span>). Such figures undoubtedly had a profound impact on a mind which, on educational theory, had already proved susceptible to Benthamite ideas. Indeed Thompson wrote of Bentham in 1824 that he &#145;had done more for moral science than Bacon did for physical science&#146;  (<span class="italic">Inquiry into the Principles of the Distribution of Wealth</span>, 1824, x).<br>
<br>Yet at this time the socialist ideas of Robert Owen were also leaving their mark upon Thompson's thought. They led him to consider in a different light the material evils inflicted by the existing economic and social order and, specifically, the reasons for the inequitable distribution of wealth which it produced. Such thoughts were to be expressed at some length in a work which was to establish Thompson as the leading thinker of the early nineteenth-century co-operative movement, <span class="italic">An Inquiry into the Principles of the Distribution of Wealth</span> (1824).<br>
<br>In this, the <i>magnum opus</i> of nineteenth-century co-operative political economy, Thompson considered the distribution of wealth which resulted first under existing arrangements, secondly where there existed &#145;truly free&#146; competition, and thirdly where a system of mutual co-operation prevailed. The existing order was characterized by &#145;absolute violence, fraud &hellip; [and] the operation of unequal laws interfering with the freedom of labour &hellip; and the perfect freedom of voluntary exchange&#146;  (<span class="italic">Inquiry</span>, 160). What resulted was the appropriation of rent, profits, and taxes from the product of labour by &#145;a class of capitalists, a class of rent or landowners, sometimes a class of farmers &hellip; sometimes a class of fundholders and an always imperious class of idlers&#146;  (ibid., 581). A system of truly free competition would, however, tend to raise the remuneration and eliminate extremes of wealth and poverty producing &#145;blessings of equality comparable to those enjoyed under Mr. Owen's system of mutual co-operation by common labour&#146;  (ibid., 150).<br>
<br>Yet such an economic regime would still be characterized by the deleterious social, moral, and psychological consequences which necessarily resulted from the conflict of interests intrinsic to competition. For that reason Thompson advocated the creation of a system of mutual co-operation with the establishment of communities whose product would be distributed on the basis of need rather than individual exertion. Such a move in the direction of equality would, Thompson accepted, contravene the notion of the labourer's right to his/her whole product and thence the Benthamite notion that, when in conflict, the principle of security must prevail over any move to greater equality. However, Thompson believed that such a conflict could be rendered nugatory where, <i>pari passu</i> with the formation of communities, communitarians voluntarily relinquished their property rights. They would then enjoy greater equality and also increased security against the vicissitudes of contemporary economic life. Further, the absence of competition would eliminate those existing pressures which made for morally repugnant and socially corrosive behaviour. The nuts and bolts of establishing these communities were elucidated in <span class="italic">Practical Directions for the Speedy and Economical Establishment of Communities</span> (1830).<br>
<br>Some of these ideas were to be developed in a subsequent work, <span class="italic">Labour Rewarded: the Claims of Labour and Capital Conciliated</span> (1827), written to rebut Thomas Hodgskin's view (<span class="italic">Labour Defended Against the Claims of Capital</span>, 1825) that a truly effective competitive economic system would bestow upon labour its full product. In <span class="italic">Labour Rewarded</span> Thompson was now clear that &#145;free competition&#146; was a chimera requiring at the outset of the competitive struggle that all should be in possession of equal means of knowledge and skill, equal freedom of action, equal materials for production and accumulation, equal rights and duties, and equal fortunes. The impossibility of this meant that competition must, in reality, involve coercion and exploitation by the favoured few of the disadvantaged many.<br>
<br>In both the <span class="italic">Inquiry</span> and <span class="italic">Labour Rewarded</span> Thompson also attacked the subjugation of women which the existing system of private property entailed. This theme was to be developed more fully in <span class="italic">An Appeal of one Half the Human Race</span> (1830), one of the classics of early nineteenth-century feminist literature; described by one commentator as &#145;the most significant work in the seventy odd years between the publication of Mary Wollstonecraft's <span class="italic">Vindication of the Rights of Woman</span> (1792) and John Stuart Mill's <span class="italic">Subjection of Women</span> (1869)&#146;  (Pankhurst, 67). The work was the fruit of his collaboration with Anna Doyle Wheeler, whom he probably met at Bentham's gatherings in Queen Square Place. She penned part of the finished work, which was written to refute James Mill's article &#145;On government&#146; (published in the 1824 supplement to the <span class="italic">Encyclopaedia Britannica</span>), which had argued that as women's interests were subsumed in those of men there was no need to extend the franchise to the female of the species.<br>
<br>Thompson's works made him the foremost theoretician of the co-operative movement. At a practical level too he was deeply involved, helping to establish the <span class="italic">Co-Operative Magazine</span>, participating in the co-operative congresses of the 1830s, and taking part in the formation of labour exchanges in Birmingham and London, where goods were exchanged according to the labour time which they embodied.<br>
<br>Thompson, who remained unmarried, lived frugally and became a non-smoker, a vegetarian, and a teetotaller. He habitually lunched on potatoes and turnips, but had a weakness for honey, which was produced in abundance on his estate. At the height of his involvement in the co-operative movement he died of inflammation of the chest, on 28 March 1833, at Clounksen, Ross Carbery, co. Cork. He was, despite his atheism, and against his wishes, buried according to Anglican rites in the churchyard of Dromberg, near Glandore. However, when the reading of his will (dated 27 October 1830) made his wishes clear, his body was exhumed and dissected in the cause of medical science.<br>
<br>The will itself precipitated a lengthy legal battle. After bestowing an annuity of &pound;100 on Anna Doyle Wheeler and setting aside &pound;4000 to cover any claims which might be advanced by the trustees of his father's estate, the rest of Thompson's property (valued at between &pound;15,000 and &pound;16,000) was left to the co-operative movement. But relatives contested the will in the Irish court of chancery and, after a prolonged legal battle of some twenty-five years, judgment was given in their favour, a pyrrhic victory for by that time the greater part of the estate had been absorbed in legal costs.<br>
<br>The influence of Thompsonian political economy within co-operative ranks was considerable. In addition his critical ideas came to form part of the ideological baggage of some of the political radicals of the National Union of the Working-Classes in the early 1830s; many of whom were to provide leadership for the Chartist movement in the 1840s. The nature and extent of his influence on Marx is problematic, but a continuing interest in his work in its own right has assured Thompson an honoured place in the pantheon of socialist political economy.<br>
