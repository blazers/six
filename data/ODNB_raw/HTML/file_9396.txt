<span class="headword">Field,  Thomas</span>  (1549&#150;1625), <span class="occ">Jesuit and explorer</span>, was born in Limerick, son of a medical doctor, William Field, and his wife, Jenet Creah; his family was of Anglo-Norman descent. He studied arts at Paris and Douai and philosophy at Louvain, from where he graduated MA. His education was typical of his background as many urban Catholics, of what would later be called &#145;Old English&#146; stock, who had previously studied at English universities now preferred to study in Catholic countries as part of their rejection of the Reformation. He entered the Society of Jesus at Rome on 6 October 1574. The date of his ordination as a priest has not been recorded.<br>
<br>Field went on foot from Rome to Lisbon, where he embarked for Brazil in 1577. He worked in various towns for six years and was the travelling companion of Jose de Anchieta, an outstanding Jesuit missionary. Field was in S&atilde;o Paulo when he was sent to work among the Guaranis in Paraguay with two other Jesuits, Manuel Ortega (Portuguese) and Juan Saloni (Spanish), because he spoke Tupi, a language similar to Guarani. They left Buenos Aires on 8 March 1588 and arrived at the city of Asunci&oacute;n on 11 August. Field and his two companions subsequently made long journeys into territory which was virtually unknown to Europeans, but it was impossible for them to establish any permanent residence, or even to remain in one place sufficiently long for even a group of Guaranis to gather. Their flying missions made little impact, did not allow them to distinguish between different groups of Guaranis, and probably had no influence on the later location of the famous Jesuit reductions. Their most effective work was probably their care of the sick, wherever they found them, particularly in the great epidemic, which began at Cartagena in 1588 and spread all over South America.<br>
<br>Field's work was finally concentrated on the Spaniards and the American Indians in Asunci&oacute;n and in the town of Villarrica. Field was, from August 1602 until December 1605, the only Jesuit in Paraguay. He had the reputation of being a tireless worker. Field and his first travelling companions were all members of the Brazilian province of the Jesuits. Final vows were often made very late in a Jesuit's career, and Field was professed of the three vows at Asunci&oacute;n on 10 March 1613. He died at Asunci&oacute;n on 15 April 1625. His importance lies in his perseverance as the first Jesuit to enter and to remain in a region where his order would later be very innovative, with a large commitment of men and resources.<br>
