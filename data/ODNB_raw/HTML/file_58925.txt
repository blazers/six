<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Tripe,  Linnaeus</span>  (1822&#150;1902), <span class="occ">photographer and army officer in the East India Company</span>, was born on 14 April 1822 at 4 St Aubyn Street, Plymouth Dock (renamed Devonport in 1824), the ninth of the twelve children of Cornelius Tripe FRCS (1785&#150;1860), surgeon, JP, and alderman of Devonport, and his wife, Mary Fincham (1786&#150;1842), the daughter of James and Martha Fincham of Plymouth Dock. Mary Tripe founded the Royal British Female Orphan Asylum, Devonport, in 1839. Tripe was educated in classics and mathematics at the Devonport classical school, before joining the East India Company's army (which was to become the Indian army) in April 1839. He served with the 12th Madras native infantry, retiring in 1875 as a full colonel. In August 1875 he was granted the honorary rank of major-general, land forces.<br>
<br>Tripe took his earliest surviving photographs in the vicinity of Devonport about 1853, while on furlough in England. In December 1854 he photographed the temples at Halebid and Belur in Mysore during leave from his regiment at Bangalore; the 1855 Madras Exhibition jury recommended purchase of these photographs for the East India Company's court of directors, which had recently declared its interest in the new art of photography. In June 1855, on the recommendation of Lord Dalhousie, governor-general of India, Tripe was appointed photographer to the government of India's mission to Ava in Burma. Bad weather, Tripe's ill health, and ceremonial duties reduced his working time during the four-month mission to thirty-six days, but he made more than 200 photographs, primarily of temple architecture, at the Burmese capital of Amarapura and sites along the Irrawaddy River, and at Rangoon, capital of British-occupied Pegu. Back in Bangalore, he produced fifty copies of an untitled portfolio containing 120 of the Burma views, his first major photographic work, for the government of India in early 1857.<br>
<br>In March 1857 Tripe became official photographer to the Madras presidency. After completing some minor work, he left Bangalore in December 1857, transporting his photographic equipment in bullock carts, on a 700-mile expedition to photograph temples, palaces, landscapes, and public works in the Salem district, Srirangam, Trichinopoly, Madura, Pudukkottai, and Tanjore. In May and June 1858 at Madras, he photographed the Elliot marbles, sculptures recovered from the ruined Buddhist stupa at Amaravati. On his return to Bangalore in July, he worked unremittingly for twenty months printing his negatives and producing thirty-five to seventy copies of the ten large photographic albums, two stereograph albums, and one photographic scroll ordered by the Madras government. His album <span class="italic">Photographs of the Elliot Marbles, and other Subjects, in the Central Museum, Madras</span>, produced in 1859, remains a valuable documentary resource. His photographic reputation mainly rests on the images contained in the nine large albums completed in 1860: <span class="italic">Photographic Views in Madura, Parts I to IV</span>; <span class="italic">Photographic Views in Tanjore and Trivady</span>; <span class="italic">Photographic Views of Poodoocottah</span>; <span class="italic">Photographic Views of Ryakotta and other Places, in the Salem District</span>; <span class="italic">Photographic Views of Seringham</span>; and <span class="italic">Photographic Views of Trichinopoly</span>.<br>
<br>While pressing on with this work, Tripe learned in June 1859 that Sir Charles Trevelyan, the new governor of Madras, had ordered the photographic establishment closed as a matter of economy, when the publications in progress were completed. Tripe proposed various alternatives to closure of the establishment, and was strongly supported by the Hon. Walter Elliot, a member of the governor's council, who wrote:<blockquote>He is, without question, the ablest Artist in this part of India, and his zeal and love of his art, coupled with his known disinterestedness and modesty, afford ample guarantee that the fullest justice will be done to the prosecution of the experiment, which I have recommended. (Dewan and Sutnik, 17)</blockquote>But the governor was unmoved, the army requested Tripe's return to military duty, and the photographic establishment was broken up in April 1860. Tripe's health was broken as well, and he returned to England on sick certificate later that year. In September 1862 he wrote to the secretary of state for India, offering to undertake further photographic work for the Madras government; the offer was curtly declined. His last known series of photographs was taken privately about 1870 at Kasur-do Hill, near the isolated frontier post of Tonghoo, British Burma, where he was stationed with his regiment.<br>
<br>Tripe returned to England in 1873. In later years he collected shells and corals, and two shells which he found in China and the Philippines (<i>c</i>.1890) became British Museum holotypes. He died, unmarried, of senile decay and acute prostatitis at his home, 3 Osbourne Villas, Stoke, Devonport, on 2 March 1902 and was buried on 6 March in the Plymouth cemetery.<br>
