<span class="headword">Owen,  Aneurin</span>  (1792&#150;1851), <span class="occ">historian</span>, was born in London on 23 July 1792, the eldest child and only son of William Owen (1759&#150;1835) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22867/', "Pughe, William Owen")</script>] and his wife, Sarah Elizabeth Harper (1771&#150;1816). In 1806 his father took the additional name of Pughe on inheriting some property at Nantglyn, Denbighshire, to which the family moved about 1800 from London. Around 1807 Owen briefly attended Friars School, Bangor, but he was mainly educated by his father, whose own interests in Welsh history and literature were reflected in the lessons he gave his son. Owen also spent some time on the Harwood estate in Norfolk, learning estate management and agriculture.<br>
<br>Aneurin Owen settled at Tan-y-gyrt, near Nantglyn, and in 1820 married Jane Lloyd of Nantglyn, daughter of William Lloyd, in Liverpool. His activities were mainly literary until the passing of the <span class="roman">Tithe Commutation Act</span> in 1836, when he was appointed one of the assistant tithe commissioners for England and Wales. Subsequently he was made an assistant poor-law commissioner, but he resigned when the heavy duties of this post damaged his health. When the work of tithe commutation grew less urgent, he was appointed, under the <span class="roman">Enclosures Act</span> of 1845, a commissioner for the enclosure of commonable lands.<br>
<br>When the government resolved in 1822 to publish a uniform edition of ancient British historians, the Welsh part of the work was entrusted to John Humphreys Parry. On Parry's death in 1825 his duties, following some active lobbying by William Owen Pughe, who was friendly with Henry Petrie, were transferred to Owen, who thus became the adviser of the record office upon all Welsh matters. His work fell into two parts: the publication of the ancient Welsh laws and the gathering of material for an edition of the chronicle of the princes. The two tasks were carried on concurrently during the period 1830&#150;40; libraries and private collections in Wales and in England were visited, manuscripts copied, and collations made, and in 1841 the <span class="roman">Record</span> edition of the laws appeared in two forms, a large folio and two quarto volumes under the title <span class="italic">Ancient Laws and Institutes of Wales</span>. It was remarkable not only for the care and accuracy with which the manuscripts were reproduced and the texts translated, but also for establishing a distinction between the three versions (which Owen termed <span class="roman">Venedotian</span>, <span class="roman">Dimetian</span>, and <span class="roman">Gwentian</span>) of native Welsh law. His nomenclature has been revised but the threefold categorization of versions is still valid. The edition of the chronicle of the princes (<span class="italic">Brut y tywysogion</span>, a continuation of Geoffrey of Monmouth's <span class="italic">Historia regum Britanniae</span> but, unlike it, based on contemporary evidence) did not appear in Owen's lifetime. A small section of the chronicle which took the narrative up to 1066 was edited by him for the <span class="italic">Monumenta historica Britannica</span> (1848), but the bulk of his material remained unpublished, and was handed over to the Record Office on his death in 1851. A complaint appeared in <span class="italic">Archaeologia Cambrensis</span> in 1859 that Owen's papers were carelessly kept, and access to them had been granted to readers who were using them without acknowledgement; and in 1860, when the <span class="roman">Rolls Series</span> edition of <span class="italic">Brut y tywysogion</span> appeared, under the editorship of the Revd John Williams ab Ithel, the reviewer in <span class="italic">Archaeologia Cambrensis</span> (3rd ser., 7, 1861, 93&#150;103) asserted that the text, the translation, and all that was valuable in the preface were the work of Owen, who was nevertheless unmentioned in the book. In 1863 Owen's transcript and translation of the so-called <span class="italic">Gwentian brut</span> (a spurious version of the chronicle), with the introduction he had prepared for the <span class="italic">Monumenta</span> and a letter on the Welsh chronicles to Henry Petrie, were printed as an extra volume by the Cambrian Archaeological Association.<br>
<br>Owen was an accurate and well-informed palaeographer. His <span class="italic">Catalogue of Welsh Manuscripts, etc., in North Wales</span>, which was awarded the prize at the Cymmrodorion eisteddfod at Welshpool in 1824, was published in the <span class="italic">Transactions of the Honourable Society of Cymmrodorion</span> in 1843. Though not fluent in Welsh until early adulthood, Owen became one of the best Welsh scholars of his day and an intelligent historical critic, whose work was compared by a contemporary critic with that of Edward Lhwyd. Though Owen proved himself a scholar in his own right with none of his father's eccentricities, there is little doubt that he owed much not only to his father's support and contacts with gentry, scholars, and civil servants in London, Oxford, and Wales, but also to his practical assistance in transcribing, interpreting, and translating medieval Welsh texts and in the planning of <span class="italic">Ancient Laws</span>. Without William Owen Pughe's tuition and collaboration from about 1826 it is unlikely that Aneurin Owen could have accomplished so much.<br>
<br>Owen took a keen interest in the Welsh cultural movements of his day and particularly in the eisteddfod; he was one of a committee of five appointed at the Abergavenny eisteddfod of 1838 to consider the reform of Welsh orthography, and in 1832 won a silver medal at the Beaumaris eisteddfod for the best Welsh essay on &#145;Agriculture&#146;. The essay was published in the <span class="italic">Transactions</span> of the eisteddfod in 1839 and also in a separate volume. Owen died on 17 July 1851 at Tros-y-parc, near Denbigh.<br>
