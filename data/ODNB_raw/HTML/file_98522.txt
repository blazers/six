<span class="headword">Gilmour,  James</span>  (1843&#150;1891), <span class="occ">missionary</span>, was born at Cathkin in the parish of Carmunnock, to the south-east of Glasgow, on 12 June 1843, the third of six sons of James Gilmour (<i>d</i>. 1888), a wright and joiner who made a comfortable income, and his wife, Elizabeth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Pettigrew (<i>d</i>. 1884). The family was Congregationalist and on Sundays walked into Glasgow to attend church, bypassing churches of other denominations on the way. Gilmour was educated at Bushyhill subscription school in Cambuslang, followed by Gorbals youth school, Glasgow, and Glasgow high school, after which in 1862 he began attending classes at Glasgow University, where he gained distinctions in Latin and Greek. At Glasgow, as he later recorded, he underwent a conversion experience and entered the theological hall of the Congregational Church in Edinburgh. While there he applied to the London Missionary Society (LMS) in 1867 and was accepted as a missionary and sent to Cheshunt College, the LMS training institution for prospective missionaries, where he studied until 1869, when he moved to Highgate seminary.<br>
<br>Gilmour was assigned by the LMS to reopen the Mongolian mission, possibly having been recommended by Hannah Swan (1809&#150;1890), the widow of William Swan (1791&#150;1866), who had accompanied Edward Stallybrass on the first LMS mission to the Buryat Mongols of Siberia from 1817 until its suppression in 1840 by the Russian authorities. Gilmour's initial response to such a remote mission among lamaist Buddhists was at first unenthusiastic, and he undertook it as a duty rather than a call. Shortly after his ordination at Augustine Church, Edinburgh, on 10 February 1870, he departed for China, where the second Mongolian mission (no longer welcome in Russia) was to be based. In May 1870 he arrived in Peking (Beijing), where he joined John Dudgeon MD and Joseph Edkins. A month after his arrival the Tientsin (Tianjin) massacre occurred and he used the anticipated French military intervention as an excuse to depart for Mongolia, despite the fact that his instructions from the LMS called for him to live at least three years in Peking learning Chinese and Mongolian. His first journey, travelling in the company of a Russian merchant, took him to Kiakhta on the Russian border, where he lived in the yurt of a lama who taught him Mongolian. He also met some people who had known the earlier LMS missionaries, whose graves at Selenginsk he visited. After returning to Peking in November 1871 he embarked in April 1872 on a tour of the Mongols of the agricultural regions to the north-east. On his return he decided to concentrate his evangelizing efforts on the nomads of the plains, on the grounds that their tents were open to strangers, allowing a missionary to mix freely with them.<br>
<br>The major problem throughout Gilmour's career was, however, that neither the Mongols nor the Russians wanted him to stay in Mongolia, though he was welcome as a traveller. During his missionary career of over two decades he used Peking as his permanent post and made almost annual trips into Mongolia, beyond Kalgan on the border with China, where he travelled mainly by camel, finding shelter in tents or the poorest inns, and surviving on a meagre diet, while going for long periods without meeting other Westerners. He also adopted Mongolian dress. In later years he travelled with a blue tent, which he pitched near Buddhist temples, handing out medicine while preaching. The isolation and lack of results bore on him: early in his mission he reported to the LMS board: &#145;I have got &#147;the Blues&#148; and that badly&#146; (10 Nov 1873, Lodwick, 155). In 1874 he admitted that he had not converted any Mongol to Christianity, nor had he ever met one who was even remotely interested in the subject.<br>
<br>Mongolian custom required that anyone approaching a yurt at sundown be given accommodation for the night, so Gilmour achieved entry into Mongolian homes from his first day on the steppes. A sharp observer, he developed a keen eye for customs and was able to write about them in a mostly non-judgemental manner. In one instance he described the kindness of a Mongolian woman who had provided him breakfast, fetched and helped him to load his camel, gave him more tea, then held off the semi-wild dogs while he mounted the camel and departed at dawn, and observed that she was at least as civilized as some who thought they lived in civilized countries. He contributed articles for the Shanghai-based <span class="italic">Chinese Recorder</span>, the protestant periodical that documented the mission movement from 1867 to 1941. Many of his articles, written under the pseudonym Hoinos (meaning &#145;from the north&#146; or &#145;from the rear&#146;), were about lamas, marriage customs, prisons, the purchase of camels, and similar matters.<br>
<br>Gilmour had gone to China as a single man, but was soon in correspondence with the sister of the wife of his colleague Samuel Evans Meech (1845&#150;1937), a fellow student at Cheshunt, who had wanted to join the Mongolian mission but was assigned to Peking. The correspondence with Emily Prankard (1853&#150;1885) resulted in her accepting Gilmour's proposal of marriage. Their wedding took place on 8 December 1874, a week after her arrival at Shanghai. They settled into life at the LMS compound in Peking, where she began language lessons, and accompanied him on his journey to Mongolia in 1876, though the communal nature of tent life created difficulties. Their first son, James, was born in April 1877, delaying their departure for Mongolia that year until June. Two more sons were born: William in 1879 and Alexander in 1884. On their third journey, in 1879, their experience of being caught in a windstorm for four days was so disturbing to his wife that they returned to Peking and decided that in future she would not travel in Mongolia.<br>
<br>Despite the hardships he had undergone Gilmour had still failed to make a single Mongol convert by the spring of 1882, when he and his family left for home, in their only furlough together in Britain. While they were there, in April 1883 the Religious Tract Society published <span class="italic">Among the Mongols</span>, based on his articles. It was an immediate success, well reviewed, his solitary life among the Mongols being compared to <span class="italic">Robinson Crusoe</span>. After returning to China in September 1883 with heightened spiritual earnestness he adopted an extremely ascetic regime, travelling on foot and on occasions carrying his bedding during a journey into Mongolia in 1884. The depression that he suffered from, which afflicted other members of his family, intensified as a result of long periods of isolation and uneasy relations with his missionary colleagues at Peking, who regarded Mongolia as an unproductive field and who dissented from his uncompromising view that church members should abstain from alcohol and tobacco. Following the death of his wife, on 19 September 1885, he embarked on a twenty-five-day trip to the plains, where his failure to make converts caused him further disappointment. Early in 1886 he settled in Dazhengxu, where there were agricultural Mongols living with Chinese. In this area he baptized two Chinese, but in reporting this to London admitted he thought they would give up the religion as soon as he left the area. His depression was worsened in 1886&#150;7, after his two older sons were sent back to England for their schooling, and during that time he came into contact with a vegetarian sect, the Tsai Li Ti, and tried vegetarianism himself. His youngest son died in Peking in December 1887. The breaking-point came when his long-hoped-for colleague, a medical doctor, was diverted to Tianjin to replace one of Gilmour's best friends who had died suddenly. The news resulted in Gilmour's mental collapse and in March 1889 he was sent home to Britain, staying at the family home in Hamilton.<br>
<br>Soon pronouncing himself cured, Gilmour set sail for China in January 1890, and embarked on another journey to Mongolia in March. In the spring of 1891 he travelled to Tientsin for the annual meeting of the LMS Peking and Tientsin district committee, became ill with typhus, and died there on 21 May 1891. His funeral in Tientsin took place on 23 May. In 1899 a granite monument was erected in Hamilton in memory of him, his wife and youngest son, and his eldest son (who died in 1898).<br>
<br>Gilmour succeeded David Livingstone in LMS periodicals as the missionary icon who laboured in an extremely remote and difficult field with no converts to show for his efforts. His solitary and self-denying toil was made the subject of hagiographical biographies intended for Sunday schools as an example to boys. If he viewed himself as a failure as a missionary he certainly was not as an observer of Mongolia. <span class="italic">Among the Mongols</span>, reckoned &#145;one of the best books ever written on Mongolia&#146;  (Bawden, 1), became the classic work on Mongolian life in the late nineteenth century, and had numerous reprintings into the twenty-first century, as well as being translated into Japanese, Mongolian, Russian, Swedish, and Turkish.<br>
