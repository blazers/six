<span class="headword">Whately,  Thomas</span>  (1726&#150;1772), <span class="occ">politician and author</span>, was born in December 1726 near Epsom, Surrey, the eldest son of Thomas Whately (<i>c</i>.1685&#150;1765), a merchant and director of the Bank of England, and his wife, Mary, the daughter of Joseph Thompson, a wealthy merchant of Hackney, Middlesex. He was the elder brother of the Revd Joseph Whately of Nonsuch Park, Surrey, and William Whately, a banker of Lombard Street, London. A member of the Church of England, he was the uncle of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29176/', "Richard Whately (1787&#150;1863)")</script>, archbishop of Dublin. Through his mother, Whately was a descendant of Major Robert Thompson, one of four puritan brothers from Hertfordshire who rose to great wealth and importance during the Commonwealth. Prominent in the settlement of New England, the family became well connected. Whately's grandfather was a cousin of Lord Haversham, while his mother's brother, also named Joseph Thompson, was a lawyer and a dissenter of substantial wealth. Unmarried, the uncle took a great interest in his nephews and left his estate to them. Through the Thompson connection the Whately family also inherited extensive, if disputed, colonial land claims in Pennsylvania and Massachusetts. Their claims helped to generate a family correspondence with Andrew Oliver of Massachusetts, a distant cousin, and Thomas Hutchinson, Oliver's brother-in-law.<br>
<br>After his graduation from Clare College, Cambridge, in 1745, Whately studied at the Middle Temple, London, and was called to the bar in June 1751. Through a family connection, Sir Peter Thompson, he succeeded James West as the recorder of St Albans in 1760. Sir Peter, with West, had represented St Albans in the Commons, and West, a more prominent politician, who had served as secretary to the Treasury from 1746 to 1756, introduced Whately to Lord Bute. Considered an able and rising young man, Whately was brought into the Commons during the election of 1761 for Ludgershall, Wiltshire, which he represented until 1768. His preferment proved rapid. In May 1762 he became George Grenville's private secretary, and, after Grenville was made first lord of the Treasury in April 1763, in October 1763 was appointed a secretary to the Treasury, a position he shared with Charles Jenkinson.<br>
<br>Whately was charged with the administration's developing colonial policy, and he played a dominant role in the final framing of the <span class="roman">American Revenue Act</span> of 1764 and the controversial <span class="roman">American Stamp Act</span> of 1765. He ably defended the administration in two publications, <span class="italic">Remarks on the Budget</span> and the more important <span class="italic">The Regulations Lately Made Concerning the Colonies</span>, both published in January 1765. He never deviated from his declared opinions, and consequently many Americans in London came to see him as their arch-foe.<br>
<br>When Grenville was dismissed in July 1765, Whately joined him in opposition. From 1765 to 1770 he acted as Grenville's party manager in the Commons, and the extensive correspondence between the two men illustrates well his devotion to Grenville's interest. He was prominent in the opposition to the repeal of the <span class="roman">Stamp Act</span> in March 1766, and in October 1766 published a well-received defence of Grenville's motives and policies, <span class="italic">Considerations on the Trade and Finance of the Kingdom</span>, which was considered so important by the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> that it was serialized between October and December 1766. Whately's organizational skills were crucial to the Grenvillite party during these years, but following Grenville's unexpected death in November 1770 he gravitated towards the North administration. Attacked by Junius for possessing all the dubious talents of an attorney, he was clearly influenced by Grenville's close friend Lord Suffolk, in whose interest he had represented Castle Rising, Norfolk, since the election of 1768.<br>
<br>Having been appointed a lord of trade in January 1771, Whately exchanged this position for the sinecure of keeper of the king's roads in June 1771, when Lord Suffolk appointed him his under-secretary of state in the northern department. He did not enjoy his return to office for long, for he died unexpectedly, unmarried and intestate, on 26 May 1772. His younger brother William administered his effects, a duty which led him to fight a duel with John Temple, a distant relative of Grenville, over his brother's stolen correspondence with Oliver and Hutchinson. The letters had been given to Benjamin Franklin, who sent them to Massachusetts for publication, an action which discredited Franklin in London and which clouded Whately's own reputation.<br>
<br>Little can be said regarding Whately himself as the vast majority of his existing correspondence concerns political affairs. He was well known in London literary circles, and left unfinished a study of <span class="italic">Macbeth</span> and <span class="italic">Richard III</span>, which his brother Joseph Whately published in 1785 as <span class="italic">Remarks on some of the Characters of Shakespeare</span>. Considered by some as an important influence on the concept of modern gardening, he had published before his death <span class="italic">Observations on Modern Gardening</span> (1770). Although some disagreed with his taste, the book went through six editions and was translated into French. Thomas Jefferson purchased a copy, was impressed by it, and consulted it while laying out the grounds of Monticello. Whately's lasting monument in the United States remains, however, in Massachusetts. In 1771 his friend Thomas Hutchinson, then governor, named a new township Whately in his honour.<br>
