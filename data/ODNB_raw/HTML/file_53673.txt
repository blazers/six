<span class="headword">Kuffeler <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>Koffler]</span>,  Johannes Sibertus</span>  (1595&#150;1677), <span class="occ">chemist and inventor</span>, was born Johannes Sibertus Koffler on 6 January 1595 at the city of Cologne in Germany, in the Holy Roman empire, the eldest son of Jacob Koffler (1569&#150;1607), the elector of Brandenburg's resident at Cologne, and Margareta von Rendinkhoven (1575&#150;1638). Though Cologne was a Catholic city, the family's connections with Brandenburg-Prussia make it likely that they were protestant, and probably of a Calvinist orientation. Koffler matriculated at Padua University on 11 November 1617 and graduated MD on 6 March 1618. After his graduation, he and two of his brothers settled in the Netherlands (where Koffler became Kuffeler). His younger brother Abraham (1598&#150;1657), and a fourth brother, moved to London in 1620, where they were joined two years later by Kuffeler and his brother Gilles (1596&#150;1658).<br>
<br>On 1 May 1623 Kuffeler married Catharina Drebbel (<i>b</i>. 1609, <i>d</i>. after 1694), daughter of the inventor <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8044/', "Cornelis Drebbel")</script>; in the same year his brother Abraham, with whom his career was to be closely linked, married her sister, Anna Drebbel. The two brothers became closely involved in the business activities of their father-in-law, a prolific inventor who enjoyed the patronage of James I, from whom he received a house and a workshop in Trinity Minories, London. Collaborating closely, they helped to develop and promote Drebbel's inventions, possibly working with him on the Dutch reclamation of the fens, and they ran his Stratford-le-Bow dyeworks when he died in 1633.<br>
<br>In June 1642, shortly before the outbreak of civil war, Kuffeler, together with his brother, left England and settled in the Netherlands, first at The Hague and subsequently at Arnhem, where they set up a dyeworks. His brother gave up his share in the business and returned to England in 1652. Kuffeler stayed behind until 1656, when, after several false starts, he signed a tripartite agreement on 20 June 1656 with Samuel Hartlib and Ezerel Tonge, offering his services to the Commonwealth as an inventor. He and his family (several of his sixteen children born between 1628 and 1649 died young) then moved to Stratford Langton, West Ham, Essex (on the opposite bank of the River Lea to Stratford-le-Bow). He declined an appointment as professor and fellow of the new Durham College (devised in 1656 and established in 1657) and he took over the management of the Stratford-le-Bow dyeworks on the death of his brother Abraham in 1657. Their dyehouse was associated with the famous Bow scarlet, or Color Kufflerianus, also sometimes known as Kuffeler's bay. This scarlet was produced using a tin or pewter mordant to dye with cochineal; according to Kuffeler, it had been invented by his father-in-law after some Dutch merchants had stumbled upon a similar process. The method of dyeing was kept secret by Kuffeler in the hope of obtaining a patent but some aspects of the discovery were publicized by Robert Boyle in his works. Many first-hand details of the process, supplied by Thomas Fletcher (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1640), are included in a document (1669) at the Royal Society, possibly intended for a committee report on dyeing. In 1656 Kuffeler guaranteed to Hartlib the dyefastness for twenty years of the petticoats of his &#145;Scarlet Women of England&#146;  (Sheffield University, Hartlib MSS, fol. 29/5/91B).<br>
<br>Dutch claims that Kuffeler was physician-in-ordinary to the duke of York (later James II) remain unsubstantiated, nor is he known to have practised medicine in England. Instead, he devoted himself to chemistry and alchemy in the Helmontian tradition of iatrochemistry, as attested by Boyle, Henshaw, and many other early scientists. He and his brother Abraham met and discussed alchemy with John Winthrop the younger, subsequently governor of Connecticut, in London in 1635 and in the Netherlands in 1642, and they also corresponded with him. The Hartlib papers are a particularly rich source of information about Kuffeler's inventive skills in these spheres, as well as in metallurgy, dyeing, agriculture, and chemical medicine. Peiresc wrote that Kuffeler owned Drebbel's laboratory book, and &#145;Collections of approved receipts of chymical operations&#146;  (Cambridge University Library, MS 2206), mostly compiled by his son Augustus in 1666, undoubtedly reflect much of Kuffeler's own experimental work.<br>
<br>Kuffeler obtained no English patents for developing Drebbel's technical inventions. Chief of these was a sea-petard, or torpedo, offered by him to the Protector in 1653 during the first Anglo-Dutch War, pre-empting a bid by Louis XIV for &pound;15,000. The device was successfully demonstrated at Deptford on 4 August 1658, making a breach 12 feet by 17 in a ship, but because Cromwell died soon afterwards the &pound;10,000 which he had promised was never paid, despite approaches to Richard Cromwell in 1659 and the Admiralty in March 1662, and widespread interest in the weapon. He was equally unsuccessful in persuading the Dutch statesman Jan de Witt, between February and July 1659, to adopt the torpedo and two other types of grenades for the United Provinces of the Netherlands.<br>
<br>Kuffeler developed and marketed a water-still and a bread oven from Drebbel's originals. In May 1633 he acquired a ten-year patent for his water-still from the states general's patent office at The Hague. The compact, portable still, consisting of a special alembic, produced 14&frac12; gallons of distilled water in twenty-four hours, used very little fuel, and was later tested in London; Kuffeler's son Jacob helped to make William Fitzgerald's still, patented in 1683. By 1635 Kuffeler was planning to ship ceramic models of his bread oven, made in the Netherlands, to England. He described the ovens, in his 1653 proposals to Cromwell, as iron- or copper-plated, 2&frac12; feet by 3, weighing only 300 lb, economic on fuel, baking 1500 lb of tasty bread in a day, and transportable on wagons (with a larger model available). Evelyn mentions that the prince of Orange's army had used the ovens; and Kuffeler told Monconys and Oldenburg, who visited an exhibition of his inventions at Stratford in 1663, that the duke of York, as head of the Admiralty, was buying his water-stills and ovens for ships sailing to the Indies. The bread oven (which also cooked meat) and Kuffeler's improved version of Drebbel's chicken-incubator oven, which intrigued his contemporaries, both operated on semi-self-regulatory, thermostatic principles.<br>
<br>Kuffeler is described as loyal, persevering, and courteous. His wife, Catharina, a knowledgeable woman, assisted with his work. He died in London on 4 March 1677, but his will and burial place have not been traced.<br>
