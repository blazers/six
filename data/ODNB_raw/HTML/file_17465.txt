<span class="headword">MacDonnell,  Sorley  Boy</span> <span class="st"> [Somhairle  Buidhe MacDhomhnaill]</span>  (<em>b. </em>in or before 1508, <em>d.</em> 1590), <span class="occ">chieftain</span>, was traditionally said to have been born and to have died at Dunanynie near Ballycastle Bay, co. Antrim, Ireland, the sixth and youngest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/69917/', "Alastair or Alexander MacDonald of Dunyvaig and the Glens (d. 1536x9)")</script>, chieftain, of clan Iain Mh&ograve;ir or clan Donald south in Scotland, and his wife, Katherine or Caitirfhiona, daughter of John MacIan, lord of Ardnamurchan. He was called Boy (Gaelic, Buidhe) because of his fair hair. During Sorley's youth his father, a cousin of John MacDonald, fourth lord of the Isles, built up a power base for his family in both Scotland and Ulster, receiving land grants on Islay, Colonsay, and Kintyre from Colin Campbell, third earl of Argyll, and his brother in 1519 (confirmed by James V in 1531).<h2>
<a name="Earlycareer15381567"></a>Early career, 1538&#150;1567</h2>After Alexander MacDonald's death his eldest son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/69919/', "James MacDonald of Dunyvaig and the Glens")</script>, the new chieftain, made his third brother, Colla (<i>d</i>. 1558), captain of his Antrim possessions. Sorley was Colla's active partner, and about 1550 was imprisoned in Dublin Castle for the constant encroachments of the Antrim Scots in the &#145;Route&#146; of Antrim and the Glens; he remained there for over a year until he was exchanged, in September 1551, for men captured by James and Colla during the abortive raid of the lord deputy, Sir James Croft, on Rathlin Island during the summer. Sorley then attacked Carrickfergus and captured Walter Floddy, the castle constable, before releasing him on payment of a ransom.<br>
<br>During the 1550s Colla and Sorley extended the family territory westwards, seizing from the MacQuillans the coastal strip of the lordship of the Route from Ballycastle to Coleraine and capturing the greatest stronghold north of Carrickfergus, Dunluce Castle. A Southern Clandonald foothold was also established in Lecale, co. Down. On Colla's death in 1558 James offered the captaincy to his brothers in order of seniority, and as the others declined, the position fell to the youngest, Sorley. In 1560 Sorley made overtures to the English authorities, and in January 1561 he and James made an agreement with Elizabeth I's government. The MacDonnells&#151;the name by which the MacDonalds of the Glens became known to Irish history written in English&#151;undertook to deploy their forces against any &#145;rebels&#146; between Carrickfergus and Lough Foyle in return for a grant of their lands for twenty-one years. This agreement was largely directed against <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20785/', "Shane O'Neill (c.1530&#150;1567)")</script>, who was regarded by the government as a greater threat, though positions soon changed. In March 1563 the English attacked the MacDonnells holding Lecale, and two of Sorley's cousins were killed. Shane then signed a treaty with the English in September, and announced his intention of expelling the MacDonnells from Antrim.<br>
<br>In spring 1565 Shane attacked the Glens, burnt Red Bay Castle, and marched northwards, to defeat the MacDonnells at Glenshesk near Ballycastle, co. Antrim, on 2 May. Sorley and James were captured. Another brother, Eneas, was killed, and James died of his wounds, though it was rumoured that Shane hastened his end. However, by 1567 Shane was in such difficulties that he applied through his prisoner, Sorley, for reinforcements from the Scottish MacDonalds. On 2 June, after first sailing to Carrickfergus to parley with the English authorities there, they met Shane at Cushendun, co. Antrim, lured him out of sight of his own men, and murdered him. Sorley was freed at the same time.<h2>
<a name="Chieftain15671588"></a>Chieftain, 1567&#150;1588</h2>Sorley next went to Scotland, gathered a force of 600&#150;700 fighting men, and landed at Ballycastle Bay in November 1567. Rory Oge MacQuillan, who had recovered his family's territory after Glenshesk, opposed their landing. According to tradition they fought three successive battles, the first at Bonamargy Friary, close to the shore, and the others in Glenshesk, as a result of which Sorley expelled the MacQuillans from the Ballycastle area, and Rory Oge's three sons were killed. However, before the year's end, and to the English government's alarm, peace was established between the three warring families of O'Neill, MacDonnell, and MacQuillan. In 1569 Turlough Luineach O'Neill, the new O'Neill, married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/69172/', "Lady Agnes Campbell (d. in or after 1590)")</script>, James MacDonald's widow, on Rathlin Island. Sorley had already married Shane's sister Mary (<i>d</i>. 1582), daughter of Conn Bacach O'Neill, first earl of Tyrone, and his second wife, Sorcha, earlier in the 1560s, and MacQuillan married Turlough Luineach's daughter.<br>
<br>In 1571 Sir Thomas Smith proposed to colonize northern Ulster and expel the Scots. Sorley brought over reinforcements, and in February 1572 he attacked Carrickfergus, where he was wounded. He then petitioned Elizabeth, asking for legal recognition of his possessions. Smith's efforts achieved little, and on 14 April 1573 Sorley was offered a patent of denization in return for active support against any opponents of the crown in Ulster. But the situation altered as the government encouraged English plantation as a better means of bringing order to Ulster than negotiation with the Scots and Irish. Walter Devereux, first earl of Essex, received a grant of Clandeboye, the Glens, the Route, and Rathlin Island, and landed at Carrickfergus in August bringing 400 colonists with him. He joined forces with Smith and negotiated (unsuccessfully) with Sir Brian mac Phelim O'Neill of Clandeboye. Sorley offered his submission again, and 1574 was spent in complex negotiations, until in November mac Phelim O'Neill and MacQuillan were seized by Essex during a parley and killed. Sorley, however, remained, as the outstanding conveyor of &#145;redshanks&#146; (mercenaries from western Scotland) to the Ulster chieftains, and Elizabeth insisted that all the MacDonnells must be expelled.<br>
<br>On 27 July 1575 Essex made peace with Turlough Luineach, who submitted. He had won a battle against Sorley near Toome earlier in the month, and launched a naval attack commanded by John Norris against Rathlin Island from Carrickfergus. Sorley had &#145;put most of his plate, most of his children and the children of his gentlemen with their wives&#146; on the island for their safety  (TNA: PRO, SP 63/52/70). Norris brought 300 foot and eighty horse on three frigates, and the people on the island fled into a castle held by fifty of Sorley's men. The castle surrendered after a two-day siege, and Norris slaughtered the 500&#150;600 people on the island and garrisoned the castle. This catastrophe did little to damage the MacDonnells' fighting strength. In November Sorley attacked Carrickfergus, took the townsmen's cattle, and killed 100 soldiers. On 28 September Sir Henry Sidney, the lord deputy, reported Sorley's country to be &#145;full of corn and cattle&#146; and Sorley himself &#145;very haughty and proud by reason of the late victories he hath had&#146;  (Collins, 1.77). However, he agreed to end hostilities, and again asked for legal recognition of his position. Sidney returned Rathlin Island to him and proposed that the Glens should be held by Sorley rather than by <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/69916/', "Angus MacDonald of Dunyvaig and the Glens")</script>, the clan chieftain, son of Sorley's brother James and Lady Agnes Campbell.<br>
<br>It was a constant anxiety for the English government that Sorley would bring in large numbers of Scots to extend his areas of control, or that Lady Agnes Campbell would strengthen Turlough Luineach's position by importing redshanks either through her nephew, Colin Campbell, sixth earl of Argyll, or else through Sorley. A certain number of redshanks did come across every year, and in 1582 Sorley brought 2000 men for an O'Neill&#150;O'Donnell expedition to support a rising in Connaught. At this point the English administration decided to eject the MacDonnells completely. The consequent expedition of 1583 consisted of a mixed force of Clandeboye O'Neills, MacQuillans (anxious to retake their territory in the Route), and English soldiers. O'Neill of Clandeboye and seventy English musketeers attacked the men in the Glens led by Sorley's nephew, Angus of Dunyvaig, forcing them to flee to Scotland. They then regrouped, marched northwards through the Route, and tried to cross over a pass near Orra Mountain into the northern Glens so as to join forces with some discontented clansmen. However, Sorley had been forewarned and had prepared a trap. The invaders were tricked into charging into boggy ground, where O'Neill and MacQuillan were slain with many of their men, as well as the seventy English soldiers and their two captains. Sorley himself had been too old to fight, and watched the battle from a distance.<br>
<br>In 1584 the new lord deputy, Sir John Perrot, tried to reverse this defeat. In August and September he moved through Antrim with another mixed force of English companies and O'Neill and MacQuillan fighting men. Sorley quickly moved west of the Bann river, and Perrot took Dunluce after a brief siege. The most notable booty he found there was &#145;Holy Columkill's Cross, a god of great veneration with Surley Boy and all Ulster&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 63/111/94). Perrot then garrisoned both Dunluce and Dunanynie. Sorley meanwhile sailed to Scotland for reinforcements. He returned briefly in November, and at the beginning of January 1585 brought 2000 redshanks to Cushendun. This rescued Angus of Dunyvaig and his brother Donnell Gorm, whose territory was being threatened by English detachments under Sir William Stanley and Sir Henry Bagenal. Bagenal retreated to protect Carrickfergus, and on 5 January the MacDonnells attacked Stanley and his men, who had stationed themselves inside Bonamargy Friary. Donnell Gorm torched the building, and Sorley sailed south to Red Bay to prevent Bagenal returning from Carrickfergus. Stanley staunchly retained his position at Bonamargy, and on 5 February Sorley again offered to submit, promising a son as a pledge if his strongholds were returned and legal recognition granted. However, by March the MacDonnells' situation had deteriorated. Angus of Dunyvaig took most of his men back to Scotland, while another English expedition forced Sorley to retreat to Toome, where he found the Bann crossing blocked by Turlough Luineach's troops. On 22 March Perrot reported that the MacDonnells were a broken force; Sorley and Donnell Gorm had sailed for Scotland, he had established an English garrison on Rathlin Island, and only Sorley's son Alexander and 120 redshanks remained. Elizabeth told Perrot to halt all military operations in Ulster, and in April Angus of Dunyvaig submitted to James VI in Edinburgh, promising to prevent &#145;undesirable Scots&#146; from going to Ireland  (TNA: PRO, SP 63/109/37).<br>
<br>Nevertheless, by August Sorley was back with more men. They re-established control over the Glens, recaptured Dunluce in early November, and in February 1586 it was reported that Angus of Dunyvaig was going to bring over another 2000 redshanks. Sorley's eldest son, Alexander MacDonnell, described as his right arm by Perrot, was killed in a skirmish with an English detachment in March, but the attempt to eject the MacDonnells had clearly failed. Sorley had tried to negotiate throughout the winter of 1585&#150;6, and in April he again asked for terms from Perrot, who was ordered by Elizabeth to make &#145;some reasonable composition&#146; with Angus of Dunyvaig and Sorley  (TNA: PRO, SP 63/122/no. 94). Angus of Dunyvaig submitted, through his mother, to the Dublin authorities in May, and received a grant of the Glens, and in June Sorley came in himself. He entered the cathedral on 18 June, &#145;threw his sword before your Majesty's picture, kissed the same and swore his allegiance&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 63/139/7). Sorley received a patent of denization, a grant of the territories between Ballycastle and Coleraine, and constableship of Dunluce Castle. The Route was divided between himself and MacQuillan. Eneas or Angus MacDonnell (<i>d</i>. after 1607), Sorley's fifth son, remained at Dublin as a pledge of his obedience.<h2>
<a name="Finalyears15881590"></a>Final years, 1588&#150;1590</h2>For some months Angus of Dunyvaig continued to act aggressively. He attacked MacQuillan in Antrim and Sir John O'Dogherty in Donegal, and sent 600 men under two of his sons to support the Burkes' uprising in western Ireland. This ended after his two sons and many of their men were killed at Ardnaree in co. Mayo on 22 September 1586. Sorley, meanwhile, had some dealings in autumn 1586 with Hugh O'Neill, second earl of Tyrone, who had previously fostered his son Eneas. Sorley warned him that the MacLeans intended to land in Lough Foyle to assist his rivals, the sons of Shane, and he also supplied the earl with troops commanded by his son James MacDonnell (<i>d</i>. 1601).<br>
<br>In October 1588 a spy in Turlough Luineach O'Neill's company reported that an Armada ship had sunk near Dunluce, and that three survivors had come with Sorley to Strabane in Tyrone, &#145;where they certified of the late shipwreck&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP Ire.</span>, <i>1588&#150;92</i>, 64). Sorley went there in order to &#145;get O'Neill's daughter to wife&#146;, despite being over eighty, and having &#145;incisions made in his forehead for the recovery of his sight, which he hath almost lost&#146;  (&#145;Perrot papers&#146;). Mary, his first wife, had died in 1582 and he married an O'Neill in October 1588. In July 1589 Sorley commissioned a Scot to &#145;weigh the ordnance&#146; of the Armada wreck, which was also supposed to have &#145;a great store of Gold and silver&#146;  (G. Hill, 190). Sorley died in January 1590, and according to tradition was buried at Bonamargy Friary. He had five sons with his first wife, two of whom predeceased him: Donnell, fighting Turlough Luineach in 1577, and Alexander in 1586. Sir James MacDonnell succeeded Sorley, and died suddenly at Dunluce on 13 April 1601, after which his brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17461/', "Sir Randal MacDonnell (d. 1636)")</script>, became head of the family. The fifth son, Eneas, died soon after 1607. There was an illegitimate son, Ludar, who took part in a conspiracy against Randal in 1615. Sorley and his first wife also reportedly had five daughters.<br>
<br>Despite the best efforts of the government over forty years, it proved impossible to eject the Antrim Scots from Ulster by force. Sorley was central to the continued entrenchment of his family in Ireland.<br>
