<span class="headword">Clugston,  Beatrice</span>  (1827&#150;1888), <span class="occ">philanthropist</span>, was born in Barony parish, Glasgow, on 19 September 1827, the eldest of five children of John Clugston and his wife, Mary Mackenzie. John Clugston was apparently by profession an accountant but he was also the owner of the firm John Clugston &amp; Co. (Bleachers) of Avonbank, Larkhall, south-east of Glasgow.<br>
<br>Beatrice Clugston became the doyenne of Glasgow philanthropists. Her achievement as a supporter of charities and a fund-raiser was the more remarkable because she was not from a wealthy family: she wrote that she had spent the first nine years of her life &#145;in the midst of the working classes and when too young to understand sorrow herself, her heart was trained to sympathy by parents whose delight it was to minister to the poor and afflicted&#146;  (Morrison, 83). From these early years she seems to have derived a deep spring of sympathy for the poor. Possibly by 1860 Beatrice Clugston, resident in Glasgow again after the death of her father, at the age of thirty-two started her &#145;professional&#146; career as a prison visitor. This work taught her the importance of convalescence for those who were recovering from illness and who, after discharge from hospital, had no option but to return to the inner wynds and closes of Glasgow.<br>
<br>Miss Clugston was the major sponsor of the Glasgow Convalescent Home (originally opened in Bothwell in 1866, but transferred to new premises in Lenzie in 1873), the Scottish National Institution for the Relief of Incurables (at Broomhill and Lanfine hospitals, Kirkintilloch, opened in 1876), and Dunoon Convalescent Home (opened in 1869). Other charities with which she was associated, and for which she raised money, included Lochburn House (the Glasgow Magdalene Institution, in Maryhill), the Dorcas Society of the Glasgow Royal Infirmary (1864), the Samaritan Society of the Western Infirmary, and the Sick Children's Hospital, Glasgow.<br>
<br>Of all her contemporaries, Beatrice Clugston was the one who could marshal the aristocracy to her cause and persuade them to patronize the grandest of grand bazaars held in aid of her various charities. In the City Hall, Glasgow, on 1&#150;4 November 1871, at the pre-Christmas bazaar in aid of the West of Scotland Convalescent Homes, Dunoon, Miss Clugston had no less than thirty-one patrons, headed by Princess Louise, Queen Victoria's daughter, who had married the marquess of Lorne, the heir to the duke of Argyll. Of the patrons, more than twenty were titled; they included the duke and duchess of Argyll and the duke and duchess of Roxburghe.<br>
<br>In 1876 Miss Clugston held a bazaar in the Kibble Palace which raised &pound;14,000; with further donations this was increased to &pound;24,000, and enabled the Broomhill estate, Kirkintilloch, to be bought. The success of her fund-raising enabled her to launch bigger schemes which gave Glasgow and the west of Scotland a range of large-scale facilities which were second to none.<br>
<br>Beatrice Clugston impoverished herself by her charitable projects: in 1876 she had no option but to accept a gift of money, and later friends provided her with an annuity. She moved, with her mother, to Lenzie (which was convenient for the Incurables Home at Kirkintilloch) in her later years. Her mother was, she said, pleased with the removal out of Glasgow, for in Glasgow &#145;her daughter Beatrice was constantly bringing in the halt, the lame, and the blind to be fed and clothed with the consequence that her cupboards were kept bare and her carpets lasted no time&#146;  (Morrison, 84).<br>
<br>Beatrice Clugston, who never married, died suddenly, on holiday, intestate, on 5 June 1888, at 3 Arran Place, Ardrossan, Ayrshire, and was buried in the Auld Aisle cemetery, Kirkintilloch, where an elaborate tombstone bears a bas-relief depicting charity, mercy, and humility. The legend &#145;Dunoon Homes, Glasgow Convalescent Home and Broomhill Home&#146; is carved around the edge of the memorial.<br>
