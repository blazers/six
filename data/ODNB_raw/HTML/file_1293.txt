<span class="headword">Banks,  Benjamin</span>  (1727&#150;1795), <span class="occ">musical instrument maker</span>, was born at Salisbury on 14 July 1727, the third of the five children of George Banks, master butcher, and his wife, Barbery Huttoft. In 1741 Banks commenced a seven-year apprenticeship with his uncle William Huttoft, musical instrument maker and retail music dealer of Salisbury. In fact Huttoft is not recorded as a stringed instrument maker and it seems probable that Banks spent some time in the workshops of London makers such as Peter Wamsley of Piccadilly (1715?&#150;1751) or members of the Hill family, particularly Joseph Hill (1715&#150;1784). There was also a later London connection with the Cahusac instrument retail business, for Banks's eldest daughter, Ann, married Thomas Cahusac in 1780. Banks used as his main London outlet the retail music firm of Longman and Broderip, whose instruments so labelled were made for them by others and may occasionally reveal Banks's signature or initials internally. Despite the attraction of London as a marketing base, Banks continued to maintain his workshop in Salisbury.<br>
<br>After two centuries Banks's reputation stands high, a number of authorities referring to the almost faultless workmanship, particularly in his copies made on the grand Amati model, after Nicolo Amati of Cremona. Banks himself is often referred to as &#145;the English Amati&#146;. He also made instruments, supposedly mainly for the trade, on the highly arched Germanic Stainer model, which are less well regarded, and occasionally produced copies of Stradivari some decades before this became fashionable. Banks's sonorous cellos in particular remain highly prized by professional players and have long competed for favour with those of William (Royal) Forster of London (1739&#150;1808), who enjoyed the patronage of the prince of Wales. Banks is thought to have produced violins, violas, and cellos in roughly even numbers, no doubt with the help of his sons. Examples of his work are to be found in the Salisbury and South Wiltshire Museum.<br>
<br>Banks married Ann Burtt in Salisbury on 8 August 1749 and they had nine children, two of whom, James and Henry, carried on the family business in Catherine Street, Salisbury, until that moved to Liverpool in 1811. Their output varies in standard. Banks died on 18 February 1795 and was buried with his wife at the church of St Thomas in Salisbury High Street. His tombstone bears the words &#145;Restored 1863 &hellip; in memory of the most eminent English maker of stringed musical instruments&#146;.<br>
