<span class="headword">Ramsden, Sir  James</span>  (1822&#150;1896), <span class="occ">civil engineer and civic leader</span>, was probably born on 25 February 1822, at Bolton, Lancashire, and was baptized there on 31 March 1822, one of several children of William Ramsden (<i>d</i>. 1840) and his wife, Jane Grandage. His father, a millwright and afterwards described as an engineer, subsequently moved to Liverpool; his mother later ran a tavern on behalf of her husband. Little is known of Ramsden's early years until he was apprenticed to the Liverpool firm of Bury, Curtis, and Kennedy. Edward Bury, a distinguished locomotive engineer, enabled him to gain further experience as assistant engineer in the works at Wolverton, Buckinghamshire.<br>
<br>In January 1846 Ramsden was appointed locomotive superintendent of the new Furness Railway, which had ordered engines from Bury's works. He found the first line under construction: this was to carry slate from Kirkby in Furness to the coastal hamlet of Barrow. Ramsden's great energy and versatility soon enabled him to make progress in the railway's hierarchy: by December he had assumed the role of company secretary and he was soon delegated further different managerial responsibilities. He served as managing director from 1866 to 1895. He became a member of the Institution of Civil Engineers in 1856.<br>
<br>Ramsden recognized the area's many opportunities for economic and municipal development, and he was to be pre-eminent among those responsible for the impressive growth of Barrow in Furness. He advocated the building of new housing to support the expanding population, and he drew up a detailed plan for new streets. By the 1860s he had inspired the creation of the town's early schools, churches, library, and other institutions. He supported the exploitation of local iron ore resources, and when the town's new iron and steel companies were amalgamated in 1866 he remained a director of the new firm. Ramsden promoted the building of the town's dock system, commencing with the Devonshire Dock, opened in 1867. As a logical development he encouraged the establishment of Barrow's shipbuilding company in 1870. Prosperity in other ventures was sometimes less evident, but the creation of a jute works served to stabilize the immigrant population by providing work for women.<br>
<br>On 9 June 1853 Ramsden married Hannah Mary (<i>c</i>.1822&#150;1899), daughter of Robert Edwards, gentleman, at Wallasey, Cheshire. Their unmarried only child, Frederic James (1859&#150;1941), served as superintendent of the Furness railway. about 1859 Ramsden moved into Abbots Wood, a new mansion leased from the Furness railway.<br>
<br>By the later 1860s Barrow's population had risen from a few hundred to about 20,000, and Ramsden successfully petitioned for its incorporation as a borough. From 1867 to 1872 he served as its first mayor. In 1870 the corporation launched an appeal to recognize his services; a statue by Matthew Noble was unveiled in 1872, in what became known as Ramsden Square. Ramsden was knighted in the same year and became high sheriff of Lancashire in 1873.<br>
<br>Besides being a benefactor of hospitals, public baths, and numerous other local institutions, Sir James was an active member of the Barrow yacht club. While his original vision of a town that would rival Liverpool proved over-ambitious, he witnessed the diversification of shipping services from the port. Involved in civic affairs until the 1890s, he served five successive terms as mayor of the borough.<br>
<br>Even though Ramsden was an extremely gifted municipal administrator and a competent engineer, he remained a purely local figure. When the borough selected its first MP in 1885, he declined calls to stand for the Liberals. He was a notable example of an energetic but perhaps opportunistic Victorian entrepreneur. His patron, the duke of Devonshire, together with other local luminaries&#151;such as the politician and industrialist H. W. Schneider&#151;undoubtedly viewed him with respect, but without obvious warmth. The local populace plainly regarded him with deference. Much of the documentary evidence for his life comes from newspaper reports or official records; the virtual disappearance of his private papers inevitably impedes assessment of his personality. In later life Ramsden suffered from diabetes, and following long infirmity he died of a diabetic coma at Abbots Wood, Barrow in Furness, on 19 October 1896. He was buried in Barrow cemetery four days later; his mausoleum bears the family arms but has no external inscription.<br>
