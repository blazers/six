<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Yorke,  Charles</span>  (1722&#150;1770), <span class="occ">lord chancellor</span>, was born on 30 December 1722 in Great Ormond Street, London, the second son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30245/', "Philip Yorke, first earl of Hardwicke (1690&#150;1764)")</script>, lord chancellor, and his wife, Margaret Lygon (<i>c</i>.1695&#150;1761), the daughter of Charles and Mary Cocks and the widow of John Lygon. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/68350/', "Elizabeth Anson (1725&#150;1760)")</script> was his sister. It was inevitable that he should be trained as a lawyer and should aim at the highest legal office. His great-uncle Lord Somers had been lord chancellor (1697&#150;1700) and his father held the office from 1737 to 1756. But the pressure of expectations made him irresolute, and, despite shining talents, his career ended in disappointment and tragedy.<br>
<br>Yorke was sent to Henry Newcome's school at Hackney before entering Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, in 1739. At university he took a major part in the private printing of <span class="italic">Athenian Letters</span>, purporting to be the comments of a Persian resident in Athens during the Peloponnesian wars. He contributed nearly fifty substantial letters and his brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30246/', "Philip Yorke, second earl of Hardwicke (1720&#150;1790)")</script>, the bulk of the remainder: they were printed for the public in 1781 and again in 1798. Having been admitted to the Middle Temple in 1735 at the age of twelve, he joined Lincoln's Inn in 1742 and was called to the bar in 1746. The following year he was given a reversionary sinecure as clerk of the crown in chancery, which he retained for the rest of his life, and was brought into parliament for Reigate, a family seat, when his elder brother, Philip, chose to sit for Cambridgeshire. His d&eacute;but was impressive. In 1745 he published a defence of one of his father's judgments in <span class="italic">Considerations of the Law of forfeiture for High Treason</span>, which was reprinted several times, and in his maiden speech in May 1748 he opposed to such effect a private bill sponsored by Lord Gage that, according to Dr Birch, the author abandoned it. In November 1748 he was chosen to second the vote of thanks on the address and earned more applause. By 1750 he was talked of as a possible solicitor-general. In 1751 he played an important part in the debates on the <span class="roman">Regency Bill</span>. His reputation at the bar also rose rapidly. He became counsel to the East India Company in 1751 and recorder of Dover and Gloucester on his father's death, and by the early years of George III's reign was earning &pound;7500 per annum.<br>
<br>By then certain weaknesses had become apparent. Yorke was not in strong health and had a tendency to corpulence and to prolixity of discourse. He suffered also from what his brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30243/', "Joseph Yorke")</script> called the family weakness of &#145;overthinking everything&#146;. Joseph recommended matrimony as a cure, to give him someone else to worry about, and on 19 May 1755 he married Catherine (<i>d</i>. 1759), the daughter and heir of William Freeman of Aspenden, Hertfordshire. They had one son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30248/', "Philip Yorke (1757&#150;1834)")</script>, who succeeded his uncle as third earl of Hardwicke. Through his wife Yorke acquired Tittenhanger Park, Hertfordshire. After she died in 1759, he married, on 30 December 1762, Agneta Johnson (1740&#150;1820), the daughter and coheir of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/14885/', "Henry Johnson (1698/9&#150;1760)")</script>, a traveller, of Great Berkhamsted, Hertfordshire, and his wife, Laetitia Dowling, but did not become noticeably less irresolute. In 1754 he had been made solicitor-general to the young prince of Wales, an indication of favours to come. When his father retired from the lord chancellorship in 1756, Yorke was made solicitor-general. But his progress faltered the following year when Pitt insisted that his supporter Charles Pratt should be brought into parliament and made attorney-general. The two law officers clashed over Pratt's <span class="roman">Habeas Corpus Bill</span> in 1758, and Pratt was henceforth a substantial obstacle to Yorke's advance.<br>
<br>As solicitor-general, Yorke took part in the prosecutions of Florence Hensey in 1758 for espionage and of Lord Ferrers in 1760 for shooting his steward. His reply in the Commons on 11 December 1761 to Barr&eacute;, who had attacked the previous ministers for subservience to Hanover, was greatly admired. In January 1762, when Pratt was made chief justice of common pleas, Yorke moved up to become attorney-general. But Newcastle's resignation later that year placed him in an awkward position, since the duke was anxious that his friends, including Hardwicke's sons, should resign with him. Hardwicke replied that his sons were old enough to decide for themselves, and they remained in office. In post, Yorke advised on the Wilkes issue that privilege of parliament did not extend to seditious libel, and was determined to maintain his professional opinion. But Newcastle continued to press him to resign, and on 2 November 1763, in vast agitation, he did so, bursting into tears, according to Grenville, at his audience with the king. He defended his Wilkes opinion in the debate of 24 November, and in February 1764 spoke against general warrants to great applause in the debate. But he soon began to regret his resignation. In December 1763, on a visit to Grenville, he &#145;spoke rather discontentedly of the exigency of the times, which had (as he called it) <i>whirled</i> him out of so eminent and advantageous a post in the law&#146;  (<span class="italic">Grenville Papers</span>, 2.239), and a little later he wrote to Newcastle: &#145;I do not see my way&#146;  (Yorke, 3.560). His elder brother wrote candidly that Yorke should either have resigned when Newcastle did, or not at all: &#145;by the part he took, neither side felt itself much obliged to him&#146;  (Williams, 136). In May 1764 Yorke confided to James Harris that he was in danger of being isolated and hoped for some &#145;conciliatory scheme&#146;, and when the master of the rolls died in November he opened up negotiations with Grenville, either for that position, with a peerage and an increase in salary, or for his old office of attorney-general, now held by Sir Fletcher Norton. He was particularly anxious that it should appear that he had been summoned by the king to his service. Northington, the lord chancellor, found Yorke as usual &#145;very unexplicit&#146;, explaining that he would need to consult Newcastle: &#145;it makes one sick&#146;, added Northington tersely  (<span class="italic">Grenville Papers</span>, 2.464). The negotiations broke down, and Yorke settled for a patent of precedency before the solicitor-general, promising in return &#145;cordial and friendly support to His Majesty's measures&#146;  (ibid., 2.469). &#145;We have lost a man of character&#146;, summed up the duke of Cumberland, &#145;but they have not gained one&#146;  (Walpole, <span class="italic">Memoirs of &hellip; George III</span>, 2.36).<br>
<br>Yorke was now in the position of supporting Grenville's government while not holding office and spoke in favour of the <span class="roman">Stamp Act</span> and the <span class="roman">Regency Bill</span>. But by the summer of 1765 Grenville's ministry was in trouble, and the king turned to Lord Rockingham to form a government. Rockingham laid great weight on Yorke's inclusion and offered him his old post of attorney-general, with his elder brother, the new Lord Hardwicke, at the Board of Trade. But Hardwicke, always languid, declined, while Yorke &#145;made difficulties&#146;  (Bateson, 28). Rockingham found him &#145;not unwilling, but <i>timid</i>&#146;. The lord chancellorship in due course was dangled before him, but still Yorke hesitated, for he &#145;feared too much would be expected of me in Parliament&#146;  (Cannon). A three-hour conversation with Norton left the latter nonplussed as to what Yorke had in mind. On 8 August, Whately reported to Grenville: &#145;Mr Yorke still hesitates. I believe that will be a paragraph in every letter I shall write this summer&#146;  (<span class="italic">Grenville Papers</span>, 3.78). Even the archbishop of Canterbury was brought in to see if he could overcome Yorke's scruples. No sooner had Yorke agreed to serve than he began to wonder if he had been wise. The new ministry was not strong and its life expectation was uncertain. Worse, it was pledged to the repeal of the <span class="roman">Stamp Act</span> which he had supported only the previous year. The outcome of the second difficulty was a fudge which had important consequences for the American situation. Yorke persuaded Rockingham to accompany repeal by a <span class="roman">Declaratory Act</span> which reasserted British sovereignty, a legalistic device which may have assisted the passage of repeal through the Commons, but went down badly in America. Yorke clashed violently with Newcastle, who objected that the <span class="roman">Declaratory Act</span> &#145;would prevent even the repeal from having its effect&#146;: Yorke accused the duke of &#145;insanity&#146;, on which Newcastle commented that &#145;he talked more like a madman than I did&#146;  (Thomas, 182). Since the government faced a number of legal issues, Yorke was one of the busiest ministers. In April 1766 he defended the administration's belief that general warrants were illegal &#145;and kept the field with great acclamation&#146;  (Keppel, 1.327). When Grafton resigned the following month, Hardwicke was offered a secretaryship of state, but declined as &#145;prejudicial to my health&#146;, and Yorke in turn also declined, though, as usual, he was promised the lord chancellorship in the future. In any case, the ministry was turned out in July 1766 to make room for the Pitt&#150;Grafton government, and Yorke resigned, complaining that he was &#145;a man sacrificed to the times&#146;  (Cannon). In November 1766 Newcastle described him as &#145;a very ticklish man &hellip; and seems to be much embarrassed what part to take&#146;  (ibid.). In the abortive negotiations for a return to office in the summer of 1767, Rockingham suggested that, if Camden (Pratt) retained the lord chancellorship, Yorke could be lord president of the council with a peerage, although Newcastle commented that &#145;the Yorkes will never be satisfied 'till Charles Yorke has the Great Seal&#146;  (Brooke, 171, 176). He was always uncomfortable in opposition and complained that Rockingham's support was too narrow, especially after the Bedford group had defected at the end of 1767 and joined the administration. A more encouraging event was his election in March 1768 as member for the University of Cambridge, where his brother Hardwicke was high steward.<br>
<br>Rumours during 1769 that Camden was not happy in his position held out further hope, and on 9 January 1770, after Chatham had attacked the very ministry he had himself set up and Camden had joined him, it was resolved to dismiss the lord chancellor as soon as a replacement could be found. Opposition was convinced that the government was tottering: &#145;the seals would go a-begging&#146;, declared Shelburne in the Lords, &#145;but he hoped there would not be found in the kingdom a wretch so base and mean spirited as to accept of them&#146;  (Cobbett, <span class="italic">Parl. hist.</span>, 16, 1770, 665). The crisis found Yorke, in Hardwicke's words, &#145;more irresolute than ever&#146;  (Williams, 144). On 12 January Grafton offered the seals to Yorke. Mansfield and the lord chief justice, Wilmot, urged him to take them, Hardwicke and Rockingham not to abandon his friends. Yorke was in violent agitation that the prize he had sought for so long could not be accepted with honour. On the 14th he declined, and he repeated his decision on the 16th. But in an audience with the king on the 17th he was pressed very hard to accept, and consented, taking a peerage as Lord Morden of Cambridgeshire. He subsequently quarrelled violently with his brother, and he died on the 20th in Great Ormond Street. He had held the lord chancellorship, the summit of his life's ambition, for three days, and his peerage had not been sealed.<br>
<br>The evidence of Yorke's death is confused. Rumours of suicide circulated at once. Horace Walpole, who disliked the Yorkes, insisted that Yorke had &#145;fallen by his own hand&#146;  (Walpole, <span class="italic">Memoirs of &hellip; George III</span>, 4.53). But he had been in poor health for some time, complaining often of the fatigue of his profession, and the week before his death he wrote to his brother that he was &#145;hardly fit to stir&#146;  (Cannon). The most detailed account was given in a letter from Levett Blackborne, based on a report by a young lady who was a relative of Agneta Yorke, and corroborated in most respects by Agneta Yorke's own narrative:<blockquote>He ate voraciously and beyond his usual manner&#151;which <i>latterly</i> was <i>generally too much</i>. Before the taking away of the cloth, he complained of sickness and indigestion &hellip; growing worse, he retired into a back dressing-room, where he was heard retching with vehemence. After some time the family in the parlour was alarmed, and he was carried to bed having, as supposed, broke a blood vessel in vomiting. (<span class="italic">Rutland MSS</span>, 2.313)</blockquote>His body was taken to Cambridgeshire for burial in the family chapel at Wimpole. His wife and at least two of their three children, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30239/', "Charles Philip Yorke")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30244/', "Joseph Sydney Yorke")</script>, survived him.<br>
