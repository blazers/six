<span class="headword">Kenealy,  William</span> <span class="st"> [<em>pseud. </em>William of Munster]</span>  (1828&#150;1876), <span class="occ">journalist</span>, was born in Cloyne, co. Cork, the son of a blacksmith. He became a schoolmaster, but was dismissed for writing an &#145;inflammatory pamphlet&#146;. He was rescued by Dr Maginn, the coadjutor-bishop of Derry, who made Kenealy a teacher in his diocesan college and then arranged for him to work on <span class="italic">The Lamp</span>, a Catholic penny journal published in York, which was founded in 1850 and devoted to literature, science, and general instruction. Kenealy returned to Clonmel, co. Tipperary, to edit the <span class="italic">Tipperary Leader</span>, but in 1855 he was prosecuted by a local protestant clergyman who alleged he had been libelled; Kenealy refused to name the journalist responsible for the article and was sent to gaol and sentenced to pay damages which he was unable to meet.<br>
<br>From gaol Kenealy successfully applied to be editor of the <span class="italic">Kilkenny Journal</span>, a long-established Liberal newspaper which proclaimed &#145;Ireland for the Irish&#146; and was owned by Mary Anne Maxwell, the widow of Cornelius Maxwell, who had been a supporter of Daniel O'Connell. A number of men who later became Fenians were employed on the paper, including the foreman printer John Haltigan, who became the printer of the <span class="italic">Irish People</span>. The writer Charles J. Kickham was another applicant for the post of editor.<br>
<br>In 1858 Kenealy married Rose Maxwell, Mary Anne Maxwell's daughter, and on their marriage he received a half-share in the newspaper. He also had the option to purchase the other half on the decease of his mother-in-law, but in fact he predeceased her. He died in Kilkenny on 5 September 1876, aged forty-eight, and is buried in the churchyard of St Patrick's Church.<br>
<br>Kenealy was not a Fenian; one of his political aims was to achieve tenant-right through constitutional means. He was an accomplished speaker, and his advocacy for tenant-right spread his reputation far beyond Kilkenny. He wrote poetry for <span class="italic">The Nation</span>, using the pseudonym William of Munster, and he was said to have been the anonymous author of the introduction to Edward Hayes's <span class="italic">Ballads of Ireland</span> (1856). He was twice mayor of Kilkenny, in 1872 and 1873. After his death, Kickham wrote in the <span class="italic">Kilkenny Journal</span> on 9 September: &#145;Though our opinions on some questions were as wide as the poles asunder, I am happy to think that our friendship was never dimmed &hellip; since I first long ago in early manhood made the acquaintance of &#147;William of Munster&#148;.&#146;<br>
