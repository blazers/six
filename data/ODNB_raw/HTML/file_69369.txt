<span class="headword">Pollard, Sir  Richard</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1542), <span class="occ">law reporter and exchequer official</span>, was the second son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22470/', "Sir Lewis Pollard (d. 1526)")</script>, the judge, and Agnes, daughter of Thomas Hext of Kingston, near Totnes, Devon. Admitted to the Middle Temple in 1519, by 1529 he was acting as counsel in the court of requests. Before 1527 he had married Jacquetta, daughter of John Bury of Colliton, Devon; the eldest of their four children was the MP Sir John Pollard (<i>d</i>. 1575). He became a justice of the peace for Devon in 1532, and was under-steward of Tavistock Abbey. He may safely be identified as the Pollarde whose law reports, running mostly from 1522 to 1535 but arranged under alphabetical headings (like Port's and Spelman's), were available to and partially preserved by Christopher Yelverton  (BL, Hargrave MS, 388). They were printed in 2004. He seems also to be the &#145;Pollard, apprentice&#146; whose successful argument for the crown in <i>Lord Dacre's case</i>, in Easter term 1535, prepared the way for the <span class="roman">Statute of Uses</span> the following year. This success transformed the king's revenues and must have commended Pollard strongly to Thomas Cromwell. In May 1535 he was appointed king's remembrancer of the exchequer, an office that he held until his death.<br>
<br>Pollard was selected to read in the Middle Temple in the summer of 1535, but the exercise was curtailed after eleven days because of plague. He was busily engaged about this time on a committee to consider the codification of canon law, following the break with Rome in 1534; Pollard was in favour of a complete fusion with the common law, at any rate with respect to criminal jurisdiction, but the committee failed to produce an agreed conclusion. In the ensuing few years he became active in the suppression of the monasteries, and is said to have spent many hours in prayer before Thomas Becket's shrine at Canterbury before supervising its defacement. He also served in parliament (perhaps as member for Taunton) in 1536, and again (representing Devon) in 1539 and 1542. His usefulness in the crown service was unaffected by Cromwell's fall, and in 1542 he was knighted and appointed second general surveyor to the court of surveyors; but on 10 November 1542 he died, while still in his forties. He had been assessed by the lay subsidy commissioners the previous year as having an income of &pound;230 from lands and fees; and his greatest prize through the dissolution was Forde Abbey, which he purchased in 1540 and made his seat. He bequeathed a gold salt to Sir Richard Rich, whom he appointed overseer of his will.<br>
