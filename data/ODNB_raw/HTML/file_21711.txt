<span class="headword">Pearson,  Edward</span>  (1756&#150;1811), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and religious controversialist</span>, was born at St George's Tombland, Norwich, on 25 October 1756, the eldest son of Edward Pearson (<i>d</i>. 1786), a wool-stapler at Norwich and later of Tattingstone, Suffolk, and a descendant of the family of Dr John Pearson (1613&#150;1686), bishop of Chester. He was educated at home and then at Ipswich grammar school before matriculating from Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge, as a sizar, on 7 May 1778. He earned the favourable attention of the master, Dr William Elliston, and of the college tutor, the Revd John Hey, rector of Passenham, Northamptonshire, who appointed him his curate on 26 April 1781. Pearson was ordained deacon by the bishop of Peterborough in 1781 and priest in 1782. He graduated BA after coming out sixth senior optime in the mathematical tripos in the University of Cambridge for 1782. He was awarded MA in 1782 and BD in 1792, and was elected fellow of Sidney Sussex and college tutor in 1788. In 1786 he won the Norrisian prize in the University of Cambridge for his essay <span class="italic">The Goodness of God as Manifested in the Mission of Jesus Christ</span>. Pearson was appointed to curacies at Cosgrove and at Strutton and, in 1788, at Pampisford, near Cambridge. In 1797 he married Susan, daughter of Richard Johnson of Henrietta Street, Covent Garden, London. He left Cambridge in the same year and was presented by Elliston to the rectory of Rempstone, Nottinghamshire.<br>
<br>Pearson began to distinguish himself as a pulpit orator and religious controversialist, first in Cambridge and then on a wider stage. His credentials as a preacher were secured by the publication in 1798 of his <span class="italic">Thirteen Discourses to Academic Youth, Delivered at St. Mary's, Cambridge</span>. In 1807 he was appointed Warburtonian lecturer at Lincoln's Inn, and in 1810 he was elected Christian advocate in the University of Cambridge on the Hulsean foundation. His Warburton lectures were published in 1811 as <span class="italic">Twelve Lectures on the Subject of the Prophecies Relating to the Christian Church</span>. In 1808 he was elected master of his former college and in 1811 served as vice-chancellor of Cambridge University.<br>
<br>Pearson's staunchly orthodox Anglican churchmanship found expression in a prolific series of publications initially occasioned by a Cambridge academic context in which the influence of the moral philosophy of William Paley held sway. In 1800 Pearson subjected Paley's system to qualified criticism in his <span class="italic">Remarks on the Theory of Morals</span>, which he followed in 1801 with <span class="italic">Annotations on the Practical Part of Dr. Paley's Work</span>. As Pearson explained in this work his concern was to guard younger readers &#145;against the errors, into which that work notwithstanding its general excellence and usefulness, has a tendency to lead them&#146;  (pp. vi&#150;vii). Pearson next turned his attention to the threat to the established church that he perceived to emanate from evangelicalism and especially Calvinism, characterizing it as a subversion &#145;from within, by the revival of certain gloomy, harsh, and revolting doctrines&#146;  (Pearson, x). He was the author of a series of polemical responses to Anglican evangelical apologetics from John Overton, author of <span class="italic">The True Churchman Ascertained</span> (1801), and the more moderate leader of the evangelical party in Cambridge, Charles Simeon. In his <span class="italic">Remarks on the controversy subsisting, or supposed to subsist, between the Arminian and the Calvinist ministers of the Church of England: in a second letter to the Rev. John Overton</span> (1802) Pearson not only repudiated Overton's Calvinist interpretation of Anglican formularies but objected to Simeon's use of the appellation &#145;evangelical&#146; as the unwarranted &#145;assumption of a title which, by arrogating so much to yourselves, was directly calculated to derogate from the just claims of others&#146;  (p. 6). Pearson further repudiated Anglican evangelical doctrinal claims in <span class="italic">A letter addressed to the editor of the Orthodox Churchman's Magazine, containing remarks on the Rev. Mr. Simeon's sermon, entitled &#145;The churchman's confession&#146;</span> (1806) and in his <span class="italic">Cautions to the hearers and readers of the Rev. Mr. Simeon's sermon entitled &#145;Evangelical and pharisaical righteousness compared&#146;</span> (1810). He was also a frequent contributor, from 1801, to the <span class="italic">Orthodox Churchman's Magazine</span>, an orthodox Anglican and anti-evangelical as well as anti-Catholic periodical, one of his more significant contributions being an article in refutation of David Hume's argument against miracles (vol. 12, January 1807, 15&#150;18).<br>
<br>Pearson was a firm advocate of the benefits of a national established church. His sensitivity to the threats to both the constitutional hegemony and the spiritual integrity and unity of the established church was illustrated by his published sermons and polemical treatises. Most of these writings were directly inspired by Pearson's parochial difficulties with protestant dissenters at Rempstone, especially his <span class="italic">Letters to a Young Man</span> (1801), in which he sought to persuade a candidate for the office of parish schoolmaster in Rempstone to abandon attendance at the local meeting-house as a prerequisite for appointment to that office. His sermon <span class="italic">The Sin of Schism</span> (1800) was published only on the insistence of William Gregory Williams, high sheriff of Nottinghamshire, that it would be beneficial because of &#145;the particular situation of our neighbourhood&#146;  (dedication). Pearson strove hard to persuade not only protestant dissenters but Roman Catholics to abandon what he regarded as their errors and to become reconciled with the Church of England. His anti-Calvinism and opposition to protestant dissent was matched by his anti-Catholicism, but in spite of the widely perceived threat from rational dissent and Paineite infidelity not all orthodox churchmen agreed with his argument &#145;that the established religion, so far as this part of the united kingdom is concerned, has less to fear from Catholics, than from almost any other sect&#146;, a view for which he was criticized in the <span class="italic">Orthodox Churchman's Magazine</span> (vol. 13, September 1807, 223).<br>
<br>While Pearson claimed to eschew party politics his defensive campaign in favour of the religious establishment involved close collaboration with Spencer Perceval, prime minister from 1807 until his assassination in 1812. It was Perceval who sought out Pearson's friendship, valuing him as &#145;a sincere and judicious adviser&#146;  (Pearson, viii&#150;ix). An example of their collaboration came when Perceval, then chancellor of the exchequer, supported Pearson's proposal in the <span class="italic">Orthodox Churchman's Magazine</span> of May 1806 for the foundation of &#145;a ritual professorship in Divinity&#146; at Cambridge. Perceval offered to guarantee the expenses for five years, but the scheme foundered on the refusal of the academic authorities to adopt it.<br>
<br>Pearson was scrupulous in the performance of his parochial duties at Rempstone. He instituted an evening lecture, in addition to double service, on Sundays, and also introduced weekday services for the purpose of reading portions of the liturgy. His biographer concluded that he &#145;seemed completely to realise the idea of a primitive pastor&#146;  (Pearson, xi). His devotional inclinations were well expressed in his <span class="italic">Prayers for Families</span> (1797), which went through four editions. He was assiduous as a catechist and wrote <span class="italic">Exhortations to the Duty of Catechising</span> (1805), though on his own admission the number of parishioners who presented themselves was very limited. However, his long-running feud with the evangelical party was reflected in his accusation that evangelical clergymen neglected catechizing their congregations. An indignant reviewer in the Anglican evangelical <span class="italic">Christian Observer</span> of 1805 condemned the work for its &#145;gross errors and calumnious representations&#146;  (p. 750).<br>
<br>Pearson, who had been of a playful, pleasant, and humorous disposition and manner, died of an apoplectic fit at his parsonage at Rempstone on 17 August 1811.<br>
