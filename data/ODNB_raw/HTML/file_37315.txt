<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Couper,  Archibald Scott</span>  (1831&#150;1892), <span class="occ">chemist</span>, was born on 31 March 1831 in the Townhead of Kirkintilloch, Dunbartonshire, the only surviving child of Archibald Couper, cotton manufacturer, and his wife, Helen Dollar. Because of poor health he was educated at home before enrolling at Glasgow University to study humanities and classical languages. He spent the summer of 1851 in Halle to acquire fluency in German and the following summer again went to Germany and spent some time at the University of Berlin in desultory study. After returning to Edinburgh he studied logic and metaphysics under Sir William Hamilton, who was well versed in German philosophy, then largely ignored in British universities. After yet another continental tour Couper returned to Berlin in 1855, now determined to study chemistry for reasons which are not clear. He studied with K. F. Rammelsberg, professor of inorganic chemistry, and attended F. L. Sonnenschein's lectures on chemical analysis. In August 1856 he moved to Paris where he engaged in independent research in the laboratory of Charles-Adolphe Wurtz, then one of the few first-rate chemical laboratories outside Germany.<br>
<br>There, in less than eight months, Couper wrote the three papers which are his main claim to fame. The first, &#145;Some derivatives of benzene&#146;, was a straightforward account of the preparation of two new bromine derivatives of benzene. The second was more theoretical, dealing with the constitution of salicylic acid. This was of interest to the eminent German chemist F. A. Kekul&eacute;, but he failed to repeat Couper's experiment: many years later Couper was proved perfectly correct. In the third paper, &#145;On a new chemical theory&#146;, Couper clearly enunciated a new theory of the linking of carbon atoms which marked a transition from the prevailing type theory to the modern structure theory. He deduced that carbon had a combining power (valency) of four or two and a unique capacity for joining itself to other atoms of its own kind&#151;the secret of the existence of millions of organic (carbon) compounds. All three papers were published in <span class="italic">Comptes rendus de l'Acad&eacute;mie des Sciences</span>.<br>
<br>Early in 1858 Couper asked C.-A. Wurtz to have this third paper presented to the Acad&eacute;mie des Sciences but there was delay because Wurtz was not then an academician: J. B. A. Dumas eventually presented it on 14 June 1858. Meanwhile Kekul&eacute; published a virtually identical theory in the 19 May issue of <span class="italic">Liebig's Annalen</span>. Kekul&eacute; stated that his work was more significant and claimed priority. Bitterly disappointed, Couper complained to Wurtz and was told to leave the laboratory immediately. He returned to Edinburgh and became laboratory assistant to Lyon Playfair, professor of chemistry at Edinburgh University. He expounded his theory in two further papers but suffered a severe mental breakdown in May 1859. He was twice confined to an asylum and finally discharged in 1862. He never recovered, and for the rest of his life was incapable of intellectual work. He was cared for by his mother, who survived him, and for the remaining thirty years of his life roamed the neighbourhood aimlessly, he and his theory totally forgotten. He died, unmarried, on 11 March 1892 in Kirkintilloch.<br>
<br>Kekul&eacute; died in 1896, loaded with honours, and Richard Ansch&uuml;tz, his successor as professor of chemistry at the University of Bonn, undertook a comprehensive biography. He came across Couper's papers and immediately recognized his genius; he devoted much effort over many years to restoring Couper to his rightful place in the chemical hierarchy. A memorial plaque was unveiled on Couper's old home in Kirkintilloch on the centenary of his birth.<br>
