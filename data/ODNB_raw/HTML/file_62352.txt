<span class="headword">Goodwin,  Geraint Arthur</span>  (1903&#150;1941), <span class="occ">novelist and short-story writer</span>, was born on 1 May 1903 at 43 Commercial Street, Llanllwchaearn, Montgomeryshire, the only child of the third marriage of Richard Goodwin (1843&#150;1911), rate collector and assistant overseer for the parish, and his wife, Mary Jane Watkin (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Lewis) (1862&#150;1943), who, like him, had been previously married and widowed. The writer was eight when his father died and twelve when his mother was married for a third time to Frank Humphreys, whose family were provision merchants in the markets of several Welsh border towns. From two Goodwin stepbrothers the writer gained a connection with journalism; from Frank Humphreys and his mother a lifelong enthusiasm for the countryside, angling, and rough shooting. To a large extent these influences shaped his life. He was educated at a local elementary school and, from the age of thirteen, as a boarder at Tywyn county school, Merioneth.<br>
<br>In 1920 Goodwin found employment with the <span class="italic">Montgomeryshire Express</span> at Newtown, where his stepbrothers had begun their careers. In 1923 he went to London, initially to work for W. T. Cranfield's publicity and news agency, but within the year he joined Allied Newspapers. A portrait of him by the Welsh painter Evan Walters shows him as a young journalist, trench-coated, fair-haired, and handsome, with intensely watchful eyes. He was a successful reporter, principally with the <span class="italic">Daily Sketch</span>, but was determined to become a writer. His first book, <span class="italic">Conversations with George Moore</span> (1929), was, he acknowledged, a clumsy extension of his journalism. In the same year he became seriously ill with pulmonary tuberculosis, which necessitated lengthy treatment in a sanatorium and several months of convalescence. He returned to the <span class="italic">Daily Sketch</span> in the spring of 1931, but had become disillusioned with journalism and was more than ever ambitious to write. On 17 October 1932 he married fellow journalist Rhoda Margaret Storey (1902&#150;1991), who supported his ambition.<br>
<br>A promising autobiographical novel, <span class="italic">Call Back Yesterday</span>, appeared in 1935. The publisher, Cape, offered a contract for two further books. Thus encouraged, Goodwin quit Fleet Street and the family moved to Lower Farm, Dagnall, Hertfordshire. He set to work under the inspirational guidance of Edward Garnett (1868&#150;1937), then a reader for Cape. So began a fruitful relationship which continued until Garnett's death in 1937. The first product was a novel, <span class="italic">The Heyday in the Blood</span>, published in 1936 to considerable critical acclaim. A collection of short stories, <span class="italic">The White Farm and other Stories</span>, followed in 1937, and a further novel, <span class="italic">Watch for the Morning</span>, in 1938. The writer's mother, reputedly a remarkably handsome and vigorous woman, is the archetype of several of Goodwin's formidable female characters. Similarly, certain of his male characters are endowed with facets of the writer's own appearance and personality. Evan in <span class="italic">The Heyday in the Blood</span> and Wyn in <span class="italic">Watch for the Morning</span> are also tubercular. Though noted for their sensuous descriptions of the countryside, larger than life characters, rumbustious crowd scenes, and episodes of broad humour, the novels are essentially elegiac. In April 1938 the Goodwins moved to Pen-y-cwm, a cottage in Upper Corris, Merioneth. There he wrote his last novel, <span class="italic">Come Michaelmas</span> (1939), set, like <span class="italic">Watch for the Morning</span>, in a thinly disguised version of his birthplace, Newtown. It was welcomed by the <span class="italic">Times Literary Supplement</span> reviewer (29 April 1939) as the work of a &#145;fresh and individual talent&#146;.<br>
<br>Goodwin's future as a novelist seemed assured, but his health deteriorated rapidly and in June he entered the sanatorium at Talgarth, Brecknockshire, where he remained for several months. He was still frail when he discharged himself to rejoin his family at their new home in the ancient market town of Montgomery. A bout of influenza precipitated a further decline in his health, and in the summer of 1941 he was again admitted to a sanatorium. The disease was too far advanced, however, and he returned to Montgomery, where he died on 18 October 1941, at his home, Bowling Green Cottage, Churchbank, aged thirty-eight. He was buried five days later at Montgomery parish church.<br>
