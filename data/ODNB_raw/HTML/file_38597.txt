<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Annan,  Thomas</span>  (1829/30&#150;1887), <span class="occ">photographer</span>, was apparently the fifth of the seven children of John Annan (1792&#150;1869), a farmer, flax spinner, and corn miller, who lived in the parish of Dairsie in Fife, and his wife, Agnes Bell (1791?&#150;1878). He left home in November 1845 to begin an apprenticeship as a lithographic writer and engraver with the <span class="italic">Fife Herald</span> in Cupar, which he completed in April 1849. He then took employment in Glasgow with Joseph Swan, who owned a large lithographic print works, producing book illustrations, maps, and bookplates.<br>
<br>In 1855 Annan set up as a photographer with a medical student called Berwick, in the Woodlands Road in Glasgow. Two years later he established an independent business at 116 Sauchiehall Street. By 1859 he had moved to 202 Hope Street and had his own photographic printing works in Hamilton, and in 1873 he moved studio again, to 153 Sauchiehall Street, which served also as a fine art gallery. On 27 July 1860 he had married Mary Young Craig at North Frederick Street, Glasgow, according to the forms of the United Presbyterian church. They had six children.<br>
<br>Annan's interest in photography may have been prompted by a friendship between the Annan and Adamson families during the 1840s. John and Robert Adamson had been involved in the early experimental stages of photography in St Andrews, and in 1843 Robert had joined in partnership with <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13270/', "David Octavius Hill")</script> in Edinburgh. Robert Adamson died in 1848, but Annan took over the Hill and Adamson studio for a year in 1870 and is recorded as meeting Hill at that time. From the mid-1850s photography experienced its first commercial wave. Annan's career briefly followed the pattern of those in other studios, as he worked as a carte-de-visite photographer and produced stereoscopic pictures and scenic views.<br>
<br>Annan's later work was dominated by an interest in the reproduction of fine art, in which he was encouraged by D. O. Hill and by Joseph No&euml;l Paton. His first important commission was for the art lottery, the Glasgow Art Union, in 1862, when he made three photographs for distribution to the subscribers from work by Paton, J. E. Millais, and James Sant. In 1865 Hill commissioned him to take photographs of his large painting celebrating the founding of the Free Church of Scotland: <span class="italic">The Signing of the Deed of Demission</span>. The scale and seriousness of this commission, to produce thousands of prints in three sizes&#151;the largest in three sections to be half the size of the original, which was nearly 12 feet long&#151;was met by Annan with admirable skill. He used the newly perfected, &#145;permanent&#146; carbon process, and his results were deemed &#145;the very acme of perfection&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Disruption of the Church of Scotland: an Historical Picture &hellip; Painted by D. O. Hill, R. S. A.</span>, 1866). In the following year he acquired the rights to the carbon process for Scotland.<br>
<br>In the 1870s Annan's brother Robert joined the firm to cope with the administration, and his sons, John and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/38598/', "James Craig Annan")</script>, also joined the family business. John Annan specialized in architectural photography and was probably responsible for the firm's engineering photographs, such as the series on the building of the Glasgow harbour and docks taken between 1892 and 1897 and the additional photographs taken for the photogravure edition of <span class="italic">The Old Closes and Streets of Glasgow</span> in the 1890s. In 1883 Annan had travelled with his other son, James, to Vienna, where they learned the technique of the other significant &#145;permanent&#146; process, the photogravure, and bought the rights to its use within Britain.<br>
<br>At the time of his death, Annan's reputation rested substantially on his reproduction of fine art; an obituary recounted that this work had won him:<blockquote>wide and most honourable distinction. Cultured, and with great natural taste for art, he loved the society of artists, and was never so happy as when endeavouring to faithfully translate some masterpiece into monochrome through the medium of his camera. (<span class="italic">British Journal of Photography</span>, 34, 1887, 803)</blockquote>But his posthumous reputation rests more on the remarkable series of photographs he took in the dark slums of Glasgow, <span class="italic">The Old Closes and Streets of Glasgow</span>. These were commissioned by the city authorities to mark the first slum clearances, which were authorized in 1866. Annan's thirty-five photographs, taken between 1868 and 1871, were designed to record the history of the buildings as well as the dreadful living conditions. They have a curious character of optimism, in celebration of a great civic proposal and the liberation offered to the inhabitants. Annan was also involved in recording the impressive municipal improvement of the water supply, which connected Loch Katrine to Glasgow in 1859.<br>
<br>Annan's portrait work gave the best evidence of, in the words of his son, his &#145;intense admiration&#146;  (J. Craig Annan to Helmut Gernsheim, 21 July 1945, Gernsheim collection, University of Texas, Austin) for D. O. Hill and the work of the Hill and Adamson partnership (Hill's widow gave him their portrait lens in 1870). Annan's most famous portrait was that of David Livingstone, which he took in 1864, when the explorer had returned from Africa and was visiting his family (who lived next door to the Annan home in Hamilton, Lanarkshire). This portrait is unquestionably the best and strongest image extant of the explorer.<br>
<br>Annan's landscape work is less well known. In the 1850s and 1860s he took a number of fine landscapes in Scotland, which demonstrate a lyrical approach and sensitivity to history and atmosphere. Contemporary criticism spoke of them as &#145;indicative of deep poetic feeling, and strong appreciation of the beautiful in the artist&#146;  (<span class="italic">Photographic News</span>, 6 Jan 1865, 182). Annan's published works include <span class="italic">Views on the Line of the Loch Katrine Waterworks</span> (1859), <span class="italic">Memorials of the Old College of Glasgow</span> (1871), and <span class="italic">The Old Closes and Streets of Glasgow</span> (albumen prints, 1871; carbon prints; 1877, and photogravure, with additional prints probably by John Annan, 1900). His correspondence shows him to be a man of religious and poetic sentiment.<br>
<br>Annan died by his own hand &#145;during a period of mental aberration&#146;  (d. cert.) that had lasted &#145;about one month&#146;  (ibid.). This took place at his home&#151;Glenbank, Lenzie, Lanarkshire&#151;on 14 December 1887, when he was fifty-seven. He was buried at Auld Aisle, Kirkintilloch. An obituary said of him:<blockquote>Honourable in feeling, and fastidious in taste, he was utterly intolerant of shams, and of everything below the best &hellip; Almost a giant in stature, and with a handsome clear-cut face and a brilliant eye, Mr Annan was altogether a noble type of man &hellip; the personification of truth, and the soul of honour. (<span class="italic">British Journal of Photography</span>, 34, 1887, 803)</blockquote>There are collections of his photographs in the Mitchell Library, Glasgow; the Scottish National Portrait Gallery, Edinburgh; the National Monuments Record for Scotland, also in Edinburgh, and at the Canadian Centre for Architecture, Montreal.<br>
