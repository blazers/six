<span class="headword">Cato Street conspirators</span>  (<em>act. </em>1820) <span class="occ"></span>plotted the mass assassination of the British cabinet from a loft in Cato Street, Marylebone, London, in 1820. Of the ten tried for high treason, five were transported and five executed. The latter comprised the leader, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27188/', "Arthur Thistlewood")</script>, and four impoverished tradesmen: <a name="cosubject_75369"></a><span class="headword">John Thomas Brunt</span>  (1782&#150;1820), a <span class="occ">bootcloser</span>, born on Union Street, off Oxford Street, London; an unemployed cabinetmaker, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/57029/', "William Davidson")</script>; <a name="cosubject_75370"></a><span class="headword">James Ings</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1794, <em>d.</em> 1820), a <span class="occ">butcher</span>, recently arrived in London from Waltham, Hampshire; and <a name="cosubject_75371"></a><span class="headword">Richard Tidd</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1773, <em>d.</em> 1820), born at Grantham, Lincolnshire, a <span class="occ">shoemaker</span>. The conspiracy was wider and of longer maturation than the trials established. The prosecution, anxious to reveal neither the scope of government intelligence sources nor the extent of political unrest, offered only limited evidence. The defence mainly sought to establish the conspiracy as the work of an <i>agent provocateur</i>, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/38374/', "George Edwards")</script>, a Fleet Street model maker.<br>
<br>A government spy since arriving in London from Windsor early in 1818, Edwards certainly helped precipitate the affair by colluding in the fiction that the cabinet would dine at the Grosvenor Square home of the earl of Harrowby, lord president of the council, on 23 February 1820. Police and guardsmen raided the Cato Street loft early that evening. In the fight that ensued Richard Smithers, a Bow Street officer, was stabbed and killed by Thistlewood. Though he and other conspirators initially escaped, all who had been present in the loft were eventually captured. Two turned king's evidence: Robert Adams (a shoemaker) and a <span class="occ">baker</span>, <a name="cosubject_75372"></a><span class="headword">John Harrison</span>  (<em>b. </em>1786, <em>d.</em> after 1830). This eliminated any need for Edwards, on watch in Grosvenor Square on the night of the 23rd, to appear at the trial.<br>
<br>The conspirators had deep roots in London ultra-radicalism. Tidd had allegedly been involved in the Despard conspiracy of 1802. Nearly all the others had been involved in the Spencean Philanthropists, admirers of the agrarian revolutionary Thomas Spence. After he died in 1814 they were consistently at the heart of political conspiracy in the capital and maintained an extensive correspondence with provincial ultra-radicals. It was the Spenceans who organized the great radical meeting at Spa Fields on 2 December 1816, which they intended as the signal for a general rising. During the autumn they had made a concerted play to win over the London trades and secure Henry Hunt as a speaker to attract a capacity crowd. Hunt, however, insisted that Spencean sentiments be removed from resolutions presented to the meeting, causing purists in the society to secede and leaving the &#145;Spencean conservative committee&#146; in the hands of Thistlewood, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28841/', "James Watson")</script>, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/63601/', "Thomas Preston")</script>. Preston, a shoemaker born on 22 February 1774 in a slum court (Huggin's Alley, Paul's Court) off Cheapside, London, was severely lame, the consequence of childhood neglect by a nurse to whom he was farmed out by his mother and stepfather. This, though, had not impeded a picaresque career which had taken him to Ireland (where, about 1790, he led a Cork shoemakers' strike) and in 1797 to the West Indies, evading arrest at the time of William Pitt's suppression of London radicalism.<br>
<br>Expectations for the Spa Fields meeting ran high in both capital and provinces. &#145;In the course of the Day&#146;, it was reported from Lancashire on 2 December, &#145;the Tower in London was taken by the Rioters &hellip; all agree in expressing the fullest determination to have mustered and armed immediately, in case the disturbance in London had been attended with Success&#146;  (TNA: PRO, HO 40/4/1[2], 3 Dec 1816). Though the meeting dissolved into widespread rioting, the intended assault on prisons and the Tower was aborted. The most serious violence occurred during the looting of City of London gunsmiths, at one of which a customer was shot, possibly by James Watson's son. Only at nightfall was order fully restored.<br>
<br>The events of 2 December 1816 were pivotal to the evolution of Cato Street. They suggested that a mass meeting, however large, would not alone generate the momentum necessary to destabilize the capital, and that the authorities would always be prepared for unrest. Thereafter the Spenceans favoured covert tactics. It was reported that they &#145;cherished some desperate project&#146; for a further Spa Fields rally on 10 February 1817, a rumour given force by meetings they held with provincial delegates a few days before  (TNA: PRO, HO 42/158, 29 Jan and 7 Feb 1817). This meeting passed peaceably, but from its platform Hunt pointedly dissociated himself from the Spenceans. The effect was to incline them further to the politics of conspiracy: &#145;They &hellip; say the Philanthropy and Benevolence of Spencean Principles will never effect any Change, and that Luddism is best calculated for the times&#146;, reported an informer  (TNA: PRO, HO 40/7[1], fol. 1929, report of J. Shegoe, 30 June 1817). Plans were devised for a <i>coup d'&eacute;tat</i> during Bartholomew fair in August. Under any circumstances this annual Smithfield fair tended to be riotous, and the plot was serious enough for the home secretary, Lord Sidmouth, to compare it to the Despard conspiracy. Preparations were called off at the last moment when the conspirators were confronted by hastily assembled official precautions. Thomas Preston, who had taken final leave of his family, &#145;declared he was so disappointed, that if he had had a Pistol by him, he thinks he should have blown his brains out&#146;  (TNA: PRO, HO 42/170, 9 Sept 1817).<br>
<br>The government, concerned to protect its intelligence sources, took no action against those involved. It was now Thistlewood who invoked Despard, suggesting that the mass assassination of the privy council should now be their objective. Another Spencean, Surrey <span class="occ">paperhanger</span> <a name="cosubject_75373"></a><span class="headword">John George</span>  (1776/7&#150;1842), also endorsed this tactic, &#145;the best signal &hellip; that would set all going&#146;  (TNA: PRO, HO 42/188, 30 June 1817). However, an attack on the Tower and Bank of England during the night of 11 October had to be abandoned when only eighty men mustered in the City. Further risings were mooted for 5 November and in January 1818, and again abandoned.<br>
<br>George Edwards was introduced to the group at about this time by his brother William (a City of London police officer and <i>bona fide</i> Spencean since 1812) and was commissioned to produce a bust of Thomas Spence. He quickly became a central member of the group and a keen proponent of the assassination tactic. The Spenceans, however, saw in the burgeoning politicization of the northern manufacturing districts an alternative route by which revolution might be instigated. Early in August 1819 Edwards reported to the Home Office that the conspirators looked &#145;with great Anxiety to the Manchr. Meeting on Monday, where they expect the Row to begin, and this they look upon as the Signal&#146;  (TNA: PRO, HO 42/191, 6 Aug 1819). The furious suppression of the Manchester meeting at St Peter's Field, which quickly led to its being named Peterloo, perhaps owed something to its association with the Spenceans in the government's mind. It galvanized the group, who immediately deemed it &#145;the revolution begun in blood&#146;. &#145;For my own part I am ready now&#146;, declared the shoemaker Allen Davenport: &#145;I compare the present time to the French Revolution, we must arm ourselves as they did&#146; (TNA: PRO, TS11/202, fol. 872; TNA: PRO, HO 42/197, 18 Oct 1819). In mid-October Thistlewood toured the provinces while the Spenceans worked the taprooms of London's poorest districts, particularly targeting Irish labourers. They contemplated using a rally on Clerkenwell Green on 1 November as the signal for an armed rising, but the subdued popular mood convinced them that more clandestine action was necessary. Shortly afterwards James Watson, the most inclined of the group to constitutional agitation, was imprisoned for debt. Without his restraining influence, the allure of attacking the cabinet dinner supposedly arranged for 23 February 1820 was hard to resist. James Ings even went so far as to prepare a placard to be displayed the following day, announcing the formation of a provisional government.<br>
<br>The full extent of the conspiratorial circles around Cato Street remains conjectural, but they clearly extended far beyond those who were tried. Viscount Sidmouth believed that &#145;a simultaneous explosion appears to be meditated at a early period&#146;  (Devon RO, Sidmouth papers, 152/M C1820/OH, 21 March 1820). When news of the Cato Street arrests reached the north, certain ultra-radicals &#145;were staggered and confounded&#146; according to one observer  (Richmond, 184&#150;5). London shoemakers', coachmakers', tailors', and typefounders' trade societies lent active support, the latter by casting bullets. A number of arms caches were discovered, one at the home of John George's son, Robert, a discharged sailor.<br>
<br>The government, however, was primarily concerned to secure swift and exemplary verdicts upon Thistlewood and those with him when Richard Smithers was killed. Thus, Robert George and Preston avoided prosecution, even though the latter was known to have been preparing to seize cannon from the headquarters of the Honourable Artillery Company on 23 February. John George was another who escaped punishment, presumably in order not to expose the full extent of the government's informer network. George subsequently earned a living as a self-employed decorator but was reduced, possibly as a result of white lead poisoning, to manual labouring by the late 1830s. He died at Lambeth on 9 August 1842.<br>
<br>Brunt, Ings, Davidson, Tidd, and their leader were tried with high treason and murder, sentenced to death, and hanged at Newgate on 1 May 1820. Their corpses having been decapitated, they were all interred in quicklime inside the gaol later the same day. The crown witness Robert Adams was released without trial but almost immediately imprisoned for debt. His colleague John Harrison was transported to Australia, where he opened a bakery in Bathurst, New South Wales, and where Sir Roger Therry describes a meeting with him in 1830. Two other transported conspirators, John Strange and James Wilson, became police constables in New South Wales. A campaign led by the City radical Alderman Wood to bring Edwards to justice failed and the latter disappeared. Under the alias of George Parker, he settled in South Africa and died at Green Point, Cape Town, on 30 November 1843. The leading conspirator who lived longest was Thomas Preston, active in metropolitan radicalism until his death on 1 June 1850: at his funeral the coffin was draped with a red flag and accompanied by the banner of the Marylebone Chartists' Emmett League. The last surviving conspirator was almost certainly the unnamed &#145;master shoemaker&#146; who, still insisting on anonymity, detailed his involvement in the autobiography he published at the age of eighty-one in 1879  (<span class="italic">Boot and Shoemaker</span>, 14 June &#150; 6 Sept 1879).<br>
