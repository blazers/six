<span class="headword">Biscoe <span class="st"> [Bisco]</span>,  John</span>  (1605/6&#150;1679), <span class="occ">clergyman and ejected minister</span>, was born in High Wycombe, the son of Robert Biscoe (1572&#150;1630), yeoman of High Wycombe, and his second wife, Susan Lane (<i>d</i>. 1648?), of Northdeane in Hughenden, Buckinghamshire. He is to be distinguished from his first cousin and namesake, John Biscoe, a lieutenant-colonel in the parliamentarian army, who was MP for Amersham in the protectorate parliament of 1658&#150;9, a colleague in exile of Edmund Ludlow, and a military conspirator against the restored monarchy.<br>
<br>John Biscoe of High Wycombe attended Oxford, matriculating from New Inn Hall on 20 June 1623 aged seventeen and graduating BA on 1 February 1627. After leaving Oxford he may have served as a lecturer at St Helen's, Abingdon. According to Anthony Wood, having been educated in the principles of &#145;precise&#146; religion, Biscoe &#145;closed with the presbyterians in time of their rebellion and took the covenant&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 3.1198). On 16 March 1643 the House of Commons named him for the chaplaincy of St Thomas's Hospital, Southwark, in the place of the sequestered Benjamin Spencer, an appointment confirmed by the House of Lords on 23 March. The following month the Lords ordered that of the &pound;50 or &pound;60 per annum income of the post &pound;30 should be paid to Spencer's wife and children, but on 16 August this was rescinded and it was ordered that Biscoe be paid the full amount.<br>
<br>In 1647 Biscoe issued <span class="italic">The Glorious Mystery of Gods Mercy</span>, prefaced &#145;To the congregation of faithful ones, in Thomas Southwark&#146;, a work which reflects the preoccupation then prevalent with spiritual religion: love, the author wrote, &#145;makes heaven upon earth: they that love spiritually do dwell in God, and God in them&#146;  (sig. A4). Biscoe was still &#145;minister of the gospel in Thomas Southwark&#146; when he issued <span class="italic">The Grand Triall of True Conversion</span> with a preface by Joseph Caryl dated 7 July 1655. A dedication by the author to Thomas Andrews, alderman and president of the hospital, recalls &#145;your special favour and bounty to myself&#146;. In this work Biscoe set out to unravel two mysteries, &#145;of iniquity working in Man's thoughts by corrupt nature&#146;, and &#145;of holiness working in the thoughts of sanctified persons&#146;  (Bisco, <span class="italic">Grand Triall</span>, foreword).<br>
<br>On 25 November 1657 Biscoe was admitted to the vicarage of St Helen's Abingdon, in succession to John Tickell; unlike his predecessor Biscoe appears not to have sought to interfere in, or to profit from, the vicarage of St Nicholas's in the town, a living separated from that of St Helen's by a commission of 1650. He was nevertheless ejected from the benefice in 1660, a successor being instituted on 3 April 1661 on the presentation of the crown. Edmund Calamy states that he then returned to Southwark, acting as a lecturer of St George's, but was removed the following year.<br>
<br>John Biscoe married twice. His first wife's name was Margaret (<i>d</i>. 1666), and they are probably the John Biscoe and Margaret Davenporte who married at High Wycombe on 10 November 1628, a year and a half after his graduation. Margaret was surely the mother of the Samuel Biscoe, listed as the son of a minister, who matriculated at New Inn Hall, Oxford, on 6 June 1660. It seems fairly certain that after the Restoration the couple settled for some years in Uxbridge, Middlesex, where Margaret was buried on 19 September 1666. Their eldest child was Robert Biscoe, a citizen and leatherseller of London; perhaps another was Richard Biscoe or Buscold, &#145;a rich tanner&#146; who in 1669 was sheltering Hezekiah Woodward, a dissenting minister, at Uxbridge  (Turner, 1.90). Richard was licensed for his house there in 1672, but in the same year John Biscoe received a licence as a congregationalist preacher at his house at West Wycombe in his native Buckinghamshire. Another son, John, was living when his father drew up his will on 23 March 1675. John Biscoe the elder died in 1679 and was buried at High Wycombe on 9 June, &#145;to the great lamentation of the brethren&#146; as Wood reported it  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 3.1198). His second wife, Mary (<i>d</i>. 1684), outlived him; she was buried, also at High Wycombe, on 7 October 1684.<br>
