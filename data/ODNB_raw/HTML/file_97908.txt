<span class="headword">Coulson,  Noel James</span>  (1928&#150;1986), <span class="occ">scholar of Islamic law</span>, was born on 18 August 1928 at 341 Manchester Road, Blackrod, Lancashire, the son of George Frederick Coulson, paperworks beaterman, later papermill manager, and his wife, Marjorie Elizabeth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Moore. He was educated at Wigan grammar school and won an open scholarship to Keble College, Oxford, where he secured firsts in classical moderations in 1948 and oriental languages in 1950. He then joined the Parachute regiment for his national service, serving as an intelligence officer and reaching the rank of lieutenant. This work took him to Cyprus and the Suez Canal zone. On 24 February 1951 he married Muriel Adelaide Ivatts, a 22-year-old student nurse and daughter of Henry Ivan Ivatts, bank official. They had two daughters.<br>
<br>On his demobilization Coulson began research for a DPhil under the direction of Joseph Schacht at Oxford. At the time Schacht was widely regarded as the foremost scholar of Islamic law in the world and Coulson's brilliant undergraduate record had attracted his attention. However, Coulson soon came to the notice of J. N. D. Anderson, the new professor of oriental laws at the School of Oriental and African Studies in London. Anderson was beginning to make a name for himself as an expert in modern legal reforms in the Middle East and he hoped to secure another specialist in Islamic law for the law department at SOAS. Anderson wrote to Coulson asking him to join the department as a lecturer, and in 1954 Coulson accepted the invitation and abandoned his doctoral studies. His relations with Schacht cooled considerably thereafter. Moving from the guidance of Schacht to the mentorship of Anderson prompted a shift in Coulson's interests from oriental studies to comparative legal studies. In order to develop the legal expertise necessary for his work he embarked upon the study of English law and was called to the bar at Gray's Inn in 1961. While he maintained a strong interest in the early formation of Islamic legal schools that reflected the priorities of Schacht, his subsequent work under Anderson's tutelage signalled a new focus on the status of Islamic law in contemporary legal systems. Coulson balanced these interests in historical and modern legal developments throughout the rest of his career.<br>
<br>Coulson's association with Anderson was a close one. Coulson referred affectionately to Anderson as his &#145;tutor and &hellip; colleague&#146;  (&#145;Islamic family law: progress in Pakistan&#146;, in <span class="italic">Changing Law in Developing Countries</span>, ed. J. N. D. Anderson, 1963, 240) while Anderson related, &#145;It would be difficult to over-emphasise how closely he and I worked together &hellip; over many years&#146;  (Anderson, 339). Despite this close relationship, Coulson directed his attention towards Pakistani family law and developed his own unique perspective on recent reforms in the Muslim world. For example, in matters of succession, Coulson preferred Pakistan's scheme of representational lineal succession to Egypt's system of obligatory bequests favoured by Anderson. Though Anderson believed that the Pakistani reforms unwisely departed from the Middle Eastern reformist paradigm, Coulson concluded that the Pakistani reforms represented an appropriate and welcome development.<br>
<br>Coulson quickly established his own scholarly reputation. Despite Schacht's ground-breaking analysis of early developments and Anderson's incisive survey of recent modifications, there was a need for a wider-ranging English-language introduction, synthesizing current scholarship on Islamic law. Coulson satisfied this need admirably with his first book, <span class="italic">A History of Islamic Law</span> (1964). This remained for many years a classic introductory text, written in an accessible style and peppered with many original insights. For example Coulson was less sceptical than Schacht about the early origins of certain hadith. He also evinced a marked sympathy with modernist jurisprudence, arguing for the <span class="roman">Koran</span> and the <span class="roman">Sunna</span> as the main religious sources of law and affirming that &#145;Qur'anic precepts&#146; were capable of supporting &#145;modern legal structures&#146;  (<span class="italic">A History of Islamic Law</span>, 225). In 1982, to Coulson's great satisfaction, his book was translated into Arabic under the auspices of the Cairo Institute of Letters.<br>
<br>In 1965&#150;6 Coulson contributed to the development of legal education in newly independent Nigeria, serving as the dean of the faculty of law at Ahmadu Bello University in Zaria. During his tenure he founded the Centre of Islamic Legal Studies and the accompanying <span class="italic">Journal of the Centre of Islamic Legal Studies</span>. He also encouraged the school to develop a legal curriculum that integrated Islamic law into a comparative legal framework reflecting the mixed nature of the contemporary Nigerian legal system.<br>
<br>In 1967 Coulson was named professor of oriental laws at SOAS, a position he held until his death. Students attested to his skill as a teacher. In the following years he accepted an increasing number of lecturing opportunities in the United States. He also continued to write, and publications such as <span class="italic">Conflicts and Tensions in Islamic Jurisprudence</span> (1969) and <span class="italic">Succession in the Muslim Family</span> (1971) established his reputation as one of the foremost scholars of Islamic law in his generation. His last book, <span class="italic">Commercial Law in the Gulf States: the Islamic Legal Tradition</span> (1984), broke new ground by directing the attention of scholars, business people, and politicians to the importance of Islamic law in modern commercial transactions. As Coulson's reputation grew, he was increasingly in demand for consultation in international arbitrations and expert testimony in English courts. At the request of the American state department he wrote a report entitled <span class="italic">Commercial Law and Practice in Iran: Recent Developments</span> (1982). He also served on the editorial board of <span class="italic">Arab Law Quarterly</span>.<br>
<br>Coulson died unexpectedly on 30 August 1986 at his home, Oak Tree Cottage, Chase Lane, Haslemere, Surrey, of heart failure. He was survived by his wife and their two daughters. Following his death, SOAS established the Noel Coulson memorial lectures in his honour. In some quarters he was criticized for his flawed assessment of the nature and direction of Islamic legal reform. Yet Muhammed Selim el-Awa, who became one of the most prominent legal scholars in Egypt following his time in London as a PhD student under Coulson's supervision, called him &#145;a pioneer&#146; whose &#145;broadly positive attitude may have far-reaching consequences for the way Islamic law and jurisprudence, and indeed Islamic studies as a whole, are taught and studied in the West&#146;  (el-Awa, 143). Coulson's scholarly contributions were indeed immense.<br>
