</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Mason,  William</span>  (1725&#150;1797), <span class="occ">poet and garden designer</span>, was born on 12 February 1725 at Holy Trinity Church vicarage, Vicar Lane, Kingston upon Hull, the only son of the Revd William Mason (1694&#150;1753), incumbent of Holy Trinity from 1722 to 1753, and his first wife, Mary Wild (<i>d</i>. 1725). He was baptized at his father's church on 11 March 1725. His mother died before he was a year old, and was buried at Holy Trinity on 26 December 1725; his father remarried twice. Mason's ancestors had included locally important merchants, civic and ecclesiastical officials. His great-grandfather Robert (<i>d</i>. 1718) had been successively sheriff (1675) and mayor (1681 and 1696) of Hull, and his grandfather Hugh was controller of the customs at the port of Hull from 1696 and patron of the church livings at Sutton-on-Hull as well as Thorp Brantingham.<br>
<br>Mason's family was staunchly whig, with some antiquarian interests, well connected, and considerably influenced his life's direction. Mason was distantly related to his first patron, Robert D'Arcy, fourth earl of Holdernesse (1718&#150;1778), secretary of state for the north from 1751 to 1761. Matthew Hutton, archbishop of York from 1747 to 1757, and later of Canterbury, gave Mason his first church preferment, the prebend of Holme, at York Minster in 1757. His brother John Hutton left Mason a considerable landed estate at Marske, North Riding of Yorkshire, in 1768, said to be worth &pound;1500 in rents  (Nichols, <span class="italic">Lit. anecdotes</span>, 2.241), which gave him the financial independence to abandon church ambitions, and to pursue his artistic and political projects.<h2>
<a name="Educationandentryintothechurch"></a>Education and entry into the church</h2>Mason's father exercised influence over his early development in religion, politics, poetry, and painting, as acknowledged in a 1746 poem &#145;To the Author's Father&#146;  (Mason, <span class="italic">Works</span>, 1.172&#150;5). Mason began his formal education at the nearby Hull grammar school, thus literally following in the footsteps of Andrew Marvell, whom he greatly admired. His teachers there included John Clarke (1687&#150;1734), an advocate of Locke's educational ideas, and John Blyth (1708&#150;1762). Mason lived with his father and stepmothers until he went to St John's College, Cambridge, being admitted on 1 July 1742. He graduated BA in 1746, MA in 1749 at Pembroke College, and was a fellow of the latter college from 1749 to 1759. He grew to prefer the social life of Cambridge and London, and then Aston's rural retreat, to Hull's bustle and pollution. His native town, and the Humber shoreline are, however, glimpsed in works throughout his career, such as the &#145;Ode to Independency&#146;  (ibid., 1.38&#150;41), his tribute to Marvell, and &#145;On Expecting to Return to Cambridge&#146; (1747):<blockquote>
<div>Commerce, riding on thy refluent tide,<br>
</div>
<div>Impetuous HUMBER! Wafts her stores<br>
</div>
<div>From Belgian or Norwegian shores<br>
</div>
<div>And spreads her countless sails from side to side.<br>
</div>
</blockquote>The death of his childhood friend Marmaduke Prickett MD (1724&#150;1753) on 18 September 1753  (F. F. Prickett, <span class="italic">The Pricketts of Allerthorpe</span>, 1929, 72), only weeks after losing his father, was a turning point; from then on he was only an occasional visitor to Hull, usually on family business.<br>
<br>His father's death, on 26 August 1753, deprived Mason of a paternal allowance, leaving him with only a fellowship of &pound;100 per year, and the will excluded Mason completely, leaving the estate to his father's third wife and their daughter. Mason's career as a Cambridge fellow and promising young writer was thus interrupted; these financial implications virtually obliged him to enter the church&#151;which was perhaps his father's intention. After a period of indecision lasting more than a year, during which he served as private secretary to Lord Holdernesse, Mason was ordained deacon on 17 November 1754 in St Margaret's, Westminster, made a priest a week later, and was then presented by Holdernesse on 27 November 1754 to the living of Aston, West Riding of Yorkshire, where he remained rector for forty-three years. For some years until his 1768 inheritance Mason actively pursued preferment, holding five church offices by 1777. Through the duke of Devonshire, he was made a royal chaplain in 1757, relinquishing the post in 1772. His most significant post was as precentor of York Minster, held for thirty-five years from 1762, in which his activities, compositions, and writings affected the development of provincial church music (see N. Temperley, &#145;Jonathan Gray and church music in York, 1770&#150;1840&#146;, <span class="italic">Borthwick Papers</span>, 51, University of York, 1977, 7&#150;8).<br>
<br>Entry into the church vitally affected the kind of writer Mason was to become, giving much of his work a tone, varying from piousness to bombast, Miltonic romance to sentiment, which rendered it highly fashionable to a contemporary audience, and increasingly unacceptable to subsequent Romantic and modern tastes. The church provided him with a framework for his life and polymathic activities in poetry, music, antiquities, gardening, art, politics, and a rich social life. He became a man of letters, but &#145;never was an author for bread. The aim of all his writings was to dignify the poetic art&#146;  (Coleridge, 454). He was &#145;as a man, as a poet, as a politician, and as a divine &hellip; highly respectable&#146;  (ibid., 397), and adopted anonymity, and later a pseudonym, Malcolm MacGreggor, when publishing his satires, most famously <span class="italic">An Heroic Epistle to Sir William Chambers</span> (1773).<h2>
<a name="Masonsfriendsandhispoetry"></a>Mason's friends and his poetry</h2>At Cambridge, Mason sought out a series of older men who became his mentors and friends: firstly, his tutors William Powell and Thomas Balguy, then his lifelong friends Thomas Gray, William Whitehead, Richard Stonhewer, and Richard Hurd. Another important influence was William Warburton (1698&#150;1779), bishop of Gloucester, who, as the friend and literary executor of Alexander Pope, offered Mason an example of combining the ecclesiastical and literary life. Much of his early verse was written to impress or memorialize these and other friends, notably in <span class="italic">Odes</span> (1756) and <span class="italic">Elegies</span> (1763). At Pembroke College, Gray and Mason were regarded as being at the head of the university's &#145;polite scholars&#146;, who &#145;confined all merit to their own circle&#146; and &#145;looked down with fastidious contempt on the rest of the world&#146;  (Nichols, <span class="italic">Lit. anecdotes</span>, 5.613). Perhaps too much emphasis has been placed on Gray's very early view of Mason as having &#145;much Fancy, little Judgement, and a good deal of Modesty &hellip; he reads little or nothing, writes abundance, &amp; that with a Design to make his Fortune by it&#146;  (Mitford, 195).<br>
<br>Mason's first works were imitations of Milton, written as an undergraduate in 1744  (Mason, <span class="italic">Works</span>, 1.158&#150;65, 166&#150;71) and his first widely praised poem was &#145;Musaeus: a Monody to the Memory of Mr Pope, in Imitation of Milton's Lycidas&#146;  (ibid., 3&#150;15), which brought him to the attention of Gray. Mason's &#145;Ode for Music&#146; was performed in the Senate House at Cambridge on 1 July 1749 at the installation of the duke of Newcastle as chancellor of the university, set to music by William Boyce, master of the king's music. Hurd and Gray were at this time close advisers, though Mason by no means always accepted their views: for instance, Mason's use of a chorus in his dramatic poem <span class="italic">Elfrida</span> (1752), written &#145;on the model of the ancient Greek tragedy&#146;, was much against Gray's advice. This experiment was continued by <span class="italic">Caractacus</span> (1759), described by Warburton as &#145;a prodigiously fine thing, vastly above <span class="roman">Elfrida</span>&#146;  (E. H. Pearce and L. Whibley, eds., <span class="italic">The Correspondence of Richard Hurd and William Mason</span>, 30 Nov 1757). Both were successfully adapted for the London stage during the 1770s. Mason's most historically significant work, <span class="italic">The Poems of Mr Gray, to which are Prefixed Memoirs of his Life and Writings</span> (1775) was in essence to establish the rank of Gray's reputation, and, using Gray's entertainingly waspish letters to his friends in censored, sometimes bowdlerized forms, it succeeded. The format&#151;five sections of letters interspersed with biographical commentary, leading to an edition of Gray's poems&#151;was innovative, and is credited with introducing the &#145;life and letters&#146; mode to biography. Its plan was taken up by Boswell's <span class="italic">Life of Johnson</span> (1791) and by a host of nineteenth-century imitators.<br>
<br>Mason's work also had consequences for copyright law: his successful lawsuit in 1777 against the Scottish bookseller John Murray for having reprinted fifty lines by Gray from the memoirs without his permission, greatly extended the rights of authors. Murray had wanted to settle out of court, and then issued a virulent &#145;Letter to W. Mason&#146; (May 1777), impugning his motives, but it was pursued by Mason as an important test case. Mason's own poetry was often criticized by contemporary critics for its rhetorical flourishes, and over-fondness for alliteration, but he was a fashionable author, satirized by Churchill in &#145;The Rosciad&#146; (1762), by Charles Lloyd and George Colman in their &#145;Odes to Obscurity and Oblivion&#146; (1760), and especially condemned by Dr Johnson who became his favourite enemy.<br>
<br>On 25 September 1765 Mason was married at St Mary's, Lowgate, Hull, to Mary Sherman (<i>c</i>.1738&#150;1767), daughter of William Sherman, the local garrison storekeeper. On 27 March 1767 she died of consumption (tuberculosis) at Bristol Hot Wells (now Clifton) where she had been taken for the waters, and was buried at Bristol Cathedral, with a pious but moving epitaph by her husband, which is still to be seen there: &#145;Take, Holy Earth, all that my soul holds dear&#146;. It was singled out by Wordsworth in his &#145;Essay on epitaphs&#146; (3, 1810, 82&#150;3; <span class="italic">Prose Works of William Wordsworth</span>, ed. W. Owen and J. Smyser, 2, 1974).<br>
<br>Mason did not have a unified identity. The highly respected author of odes, elegies, epitaphs, dramatic poems, and epic blank verse was at the same time the subversive satirist Malcolm MacGreggor. One side of his work is &#145;correct&#146;, informed by history, romance, religion, and sentiment; the other is informed by virulent political and personal attacks. He has been often stigmatized as a dilettante: conventional, pious, monotonously high-flown, a dull imitator of Gray and Milton. But he was an undeniably restless literary experimenter. He can be seen as a vital transitional figure between the late Augustan and Romantic modes, by way of the picturesque. This is most obvious in his <i>magnum opus</i>, <span class="italic">The English Garden</span> (4 books, 1772&#150;81), over 2400 lines of blank verse based on Virgil's <span class="italic">Georgics</span>, a didactic poem concerning landscape, art, and gardening&#151;with an occasional vein of romanticized autobiography. Mason started out as a very ornamental, &#145;Parnassian&#146; poet and evolved towards the much more natural language of his satires and the birthday sonnets of his last years. His student imitations of Milton, Chaucer, and Spenser in &#145;Musaeus&#146; (written 1744, published 1747) were already moving away from the dominant Augustan modes. With Gray and Hurd, Mason shared an antiquarian interest in the British Muse, in its Anglo-Saxon, Scandinavian, and especially Celtic sources (see his commonplace book, York Minster Archives, Add. MS 25). Mason concluded his writing with a series of birthday sonnets during the 1790s, a lengthy exposition of his faith, &#145;Religio clerici&#146;, and a versification of a chapter in the book of <span class="roman">Job</span>, sent to Hurd a few days before his fatal accident.<h2>
<a name="Masonandgardens"></a>Mason and gardens</h2>Gardening, like politics, formed both a subject for Mason's writing and a sphere of practical activity. His two major poems, <span class="italic">An Heroic Epistle to Sir William Chambers</span> (1773), which ridicules the royal taste for chinoiserie, especially at Kew Gardens, and <span class="italic">The English Garden</span>, both deal with garden history and aesthetics, albeit in radically different manners. Mason frequented the houses and estates of his friends and patrons throughout his life, and designed several flower gardens for them, notably for Hurd at Thurcaston in Leicestershire; for Lord Jersey at Middleton Park; and most spectacularly for Lord Harcourt at Nuneham Courtenay, Oxfordshire. Mason believed in hybrid arts,<blockquote>
<div>Those magic seeds of fancy, which produce<br>
</div>
<div>A Poet's feeling, and a Painter's eye.<br>
</div> (<span class="italic">English Garden</span>, 1.20&#150;21)</blockquote>He absorbed some of his garden tastes from an early love of poetry, but had more practically seen the work of William Kent, and Launcelot &#145;Capability&#146; Brown (1715&#150;1783) whose epitaph at Fenstanton church, Suffolk, Mason later wrote  (Mason, <span class="italic">Works</span>, 1.143). Mason's gardens were themselves very literary, with classical and modern busts, memorials, and verse inscriptions taken from Milton, Marvell, Gray, and Rousseau, to give a melancholy, sentimental atmosphere; his gardens were to be places of spiritual refreshment and aesthetic contemplation.<br>
<br>Mason's horticultural masterpiece was for George Simon (1736&#150;1809), Lord Nuneham until 1778, thereafter second Earl Harcourt. The walled garden was created in 1772&#150;3, improved in 1784, and was regarded by visitors for generations as one of the most beautiful in Britain. It is the only one of Mason's gardens which still survives, having been restored in the 1970s. Mason created a series of points of interest in the picturesque manner (later more associated with his friend William Gilpin), and irregularly shaped flower beds containing wild, native, and imported flowers. The gently sloping ground was covered with patches of flowers including roses, lupins, tulips, hollyhocks, and sweet-scented mignonette; and trailing garlands of clematis, bryony, and creepers draped the surrounding trees, in imitation of Julie's garden in Rousseau's <span class="italic">La nouvelle H&eacute;lo&iuml;se</span> (1760). Mason describes it in the fourth book of <span class="italic">The English Garden</span>, with Lord Harcourt as &#145;Alcander&#146;. Mason's gardening style became fashionable, inspiring numerous imitators, and Queen Charlotte wanted a Mason garden for Frogmore, Windsor. Mason's gardening has been seen as his most original cultural contribution: the informal flower garden was without precedent  (see Batey, 11&#150;25).<h2>
<a name="Politicsandsocialconcerns"></a>Politics and social concerns</h2>Mason spent much of his adult life in opposition to the government of the day&#151;to the policies of Lord Bute, and Lord North during the American war in particular. Mason's major political involvements were with the Yorkshire Association, and he was particularly active during the 1780 and 1784 general elections, being Christopher Wyvill's deputy from 1779 to 1785, and with the anti-slavery campaign. His whig politics affected both his personal and literary relations: the mutual antipathy between him and the tory Dr Johnson had a political as well as a personal element. In his satires tory ministers, pensioners, and placemen were ruthlessly pursued; but Charles James Fox also suffered: the <span class="italic">Heroic Epistle</span> ends with the inveterate gambler being seized by Jewish moneylenders and circumcised in public  (P. J. Toynbee, <span class="italic">Satirical Poems Published &hellip; by William Mason</span>, 1926, 52). Eventually disillusioned by the infighting of whig politicians, and their failure to deliver even moderate reforms, Mason switched his allegiance in 1784 to the young William Pitt, as the best hope for parliamentary reform and for the abolition of slavery, a decision which cost him friends, notably Horace Walpole  (Walpole, <span class="italic">Corr.</span>, 29.xxviii). Mason was a friend of William Wilberforce, and of Beilby Porteous, bishop of London, and was himself one of the earliest abolitionists. His sermon &#145;God the universal and equal father of all mankind&#146;, delivered in York Minster on 27 January 1788, was widely circulated. Perhaps to annoy his tory archbishop William Markham, he baptized a young American black man, Benjamin Moor, in the minster on 11 May 1777  (<span class="italic">Yorkshire Archaeological and Topographical Journal</span>, 6, 1881, 393). Mason's social and charitable concerns stretched widely, to include the treatment of prisoners and lunatics in York (see A. Digby, &#145;From York Lunatic Asylum to Bootham Park Hospital&#146;, <span class="italic">Borthwick Papers</span>, 69, University of York, 1986, 8&#150;10).<h2>
<a name="Masonsmusic"></a>Mason's music</h2>Mason knew, observed, and sometimes collaborated with, leading composers and performers&#151;Boyce, Giardini, and Avison&#151;and was a friend of Charles Burney. Thomas Arne composed the incidental music for Mason's dramatic poems <span class="italic">Elfrida</span> and <span class="italic">Caractacus</span> when they were adapted for the stage in 1772 and 1776 respectively. Mason was an accomplished amateur musician, playing several keyboard instruments, and had strong progressive views about both cathedral and parochial music (Mason, <span class="italic">Essays on English Church Music</span>, 1795; and see <span class="italic">MT</span>, 114, 1973, 894). He concerned himself with the state of church music in practical ways and in his essay &#145;On parochial psalmody&#146; he criticized the habit of leaving the choice and conduct of metrical psalms to the parish clerk, and the music in the hands of a self-appointed choir and band. He also criticized many of the verse translations in use, and proposed using a &#145;judicious selection&#146; of passages from the metrical psalms; Mason advocated unison singing in which all could easily join, with the accompaniment of an organ or barrel organ and tunes to be sung faster and more rhythmically. Congregational devotion through music had been his aim. Mason's best-known anthem was &#145;Lord of all pow'r and might&#146;, which was sung in the Chapel Royal, Windsor, and in York Minster. In 1782 he published <span class="italic">A Copious Collection of those Portions of the Psalms of David &hellip; which have been Set to Music and Sung as Anthems &hellip; and Published for the Use of the Church of York</span>. He introduced a new form of the piano to Britain, actually a combination harpsichord-pianoforte, which he brought back from Hamburg, Germany, in 1755 and is said to have popularized at court. He invented the celestinette, which according to his friend Mrs Delany had &#145;a delicate, exquisite sound, something between a fiddle and the musical glasses&#146;  (Barr and Ingamells, 18).<br>
<br>Mason had a squint in his right eye, giving him a roguish leer somewhat at odds with his cultivated manners and priestly duties. In maturity he was a stout, short man; his voice was said to incline towards a nasal whine. He could be disputatious, but on a visit to Aston in 1788, the poet Richard Polwhele found &#145;a kind of sedate benignity in his countenance&#146;  (R. Polwhele, <span class="italic">Traditions and Recollections</span>, 1826, 2.217). Sarah Siddons recorded that Mason &#145;spoke broad Yorkshire, and good-naturedly allowed us to accuse him of affectation in so doing&#146;, adding that &#145;he was a great humorist, but with all his oddities, a benevolent man&#146;  (P. Fitzgerald, <span class="italic">The Kembles</span>, 2 vols., 1871, 1.252&#150;3).<h2>
<a name="Deathandsubsequentreputation"></a>Death and subsequent reputation</h2>On Friday 31 March 1797 Mason fell and injured his leg while entering his carriage. The wound became inflamed over the weekend and his curate reported:<blockquote>Mr Mason was suddenly seized with a violent shivering fit &amp; never spoke afterwards &hellip; It seemed as if his whole frame had given way at once; for the malady was so rapid that he died the day following [Wednesday 5 April 1797] at two in the afternoon. (Brunskill to William Gilpin, Bodl. Oxf., MS Eng. Misc. d.571)</blockquote>He had died at his rectory in Aston, and was buried at All Saints Church, Aston, on 11 April. Among the obituaries of Mason which appeared, that in the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> (April 1797) praised him, but in ways which presaged subsequent attitudes through the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries:<blockquote>Mr Mason was an acknowledged scholar, and possessed high claims to a considerable degree of poetical reputation. All that could be gathered from the Greek and Roman stores certainly contributed to embellish his mind, but it may be reasonably questioned whether it was enriched by great share of original genius. (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 359)</blockquote>Accounts of Mason's life and works appeared in books such as Hartley Coleridge's <span class="italic">Worthies of Yorkshire and Lancashire</span> (1836, 397&#150;462), and R. W. Corlass's <span class="italic">Sketches of Hull Authors</span> (1879, 54&#150;63) viewed him as a respected if old fashioned figure. Coleridge called Mason &#145;the most considerable Yorkshire poet since Marvell&#146;, adding that, &#145;With the great poets in any department of poetry, Mason cannot be numbered. Yet he was, for many years of his life, England's greatest living poet&#146;  (Coleridge, 462). Later critics, Edmund Gosse and Leslie Stephen in particular, severely deprecated Mason's silent mutilation of Gray's letters&#151;and this proved an essential element in the radical downgrading of his reputation. Stephen reached the damning verdict that Mason &#145;mistook himself for a poet &hellip; his serious attempts at poetry are rather vapid performances&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>). George Saintsbury dismissed him as &#145;one of the paltriest and most pretentious poetasters who ever trespassed on the English Parnassus&#146;  (Saintsbury, <span class="italic">A History of English Prosody</span>, 2, 1910, 518).<br>
<br>Most twentieth-century critical attention has found Mason &#145;typical&#146; of his class and era, an imitator of Milton and Gray, notably J. W. Draper in his <span class="italic">William Mason: a Study in Eighteenth-Century Culture</span> (1924). The only significant publication of Mason's works in the twentieth century was an edition of his satirical poems (Oxford, 1926), edited by Paget Toynbee, with notes by Horace Walpole written in 1779. There is evidence that interest in Mason has revived in recent decades, certainly in his gardening, and also in his combative role in the political and aesthetic debates of his time. A wide-ranging exhibition of Masoniana, including portraits, manuscripts, and first editions, was held in York Art Gallery and York Minster Library from 16 June to 15 July 1973, organized by Bernard Barr and John Ingamells. A one-day conference to mark the bicentenary of Mason's death was held at the King's Manor, York, under the auspices of the Yorkshire Gardens Trust, on 24 July 1997.<br>
<br>Mason was one of the most famous, fashionable&#151;and most often satirized&#151;poets of his era. He wrote one of the best-selling poems of the eighteenth century, the <span class="italic">Heroic Epistle</span>, and critically influenced another, Gray's &#145;Elegy in a Country Church-Yard&#146;. His debates with Walpole, Gray, Hurd, and later William Gilpin, were instrumental in forming the ideas of the picturesque and the Gothick, and were an important influence on the Romantic movement. Mason's polymathic activities make him one of the most comprehensive cultural figures of his age. He survives as a name in the indexes of books about his contemporaries, from Dr Johnson to Sarah Siddons, Sir Joshua Reynolds to David Garrick. His influence has been felt in the most diverse spheres. But as a poet of at least historical importance, he still awaits resurrection.<br>
