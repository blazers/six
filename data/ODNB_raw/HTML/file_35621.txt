<span class="headword">Proctor,  Robert George Collier</span>  (1868&#150;1903), <span class="occ">bibliographer</span>, was born at Budleigh Salterton, Devon, on 13 May 1868, the only child of Robert Proctor (1821&#150;1880) and his wife, Anne Tate. His father was a good classical scholar, while his grandfather Robert Proctor (1798&#150;1875) published in 1825 a description of a journey in South America, and married Mary, sister of John Payne Collier, who was thus the bibliographer's great-uncle. A sister of Proctor's father, Mariquita, was first wife of George Edmund Street, the architect.<br>
<br>Proctor, who early developed a precocious love of study, went from a preparatory school at Reading to Marlborough College at the age of ten. But his father died on 5 March 1880, and soon afterwards Proctor was taken away from Marlborough, it is said partly owing to eye trouble. The family had settled at Bath as early as January 1878, and in January 1881 the boy entered Bath College. In 1886 he won an open classical scholarship at Corpus Christi College, Oxford, and he matriculated at the university in October. His mother lived at Oxford during his academic course. He won a first class in classical moderations in Hilary term 1888, and graduated BA in 1890. While an undergraduate, Proctor engaged in antiquarian research; a visit to Greece stimulated his archaeological interests. As a schoolboy he had collected books, and at Oxford he spent much time in his college library. A love of bibliographical study developed, and he prepared a catalogue of the Corpus incunabula and printed books up to 1600.<br>
<br>Proctor remained at Oxford after taking his degree in order to continue his study of early printed books. Between 23 February 1891 and September 1893 he catalogued some 3000 incunabula in the Bodleian Library, continuing the work begun by E. Gordon Duff, and he did similar work at New College and at Brasenose. On 16 October 1893 he is first found in the house lists of the British Museum, having competed successfully (after a first failure) for entry into the library. He remained as assistant in the printed books department until his death. He lived at Wimbledon from the autumn of 1893 to the summer of 1897, when he and his mother moved to a new house at Oxshott. At the British Museum he soon became a leading expert on early typography. He rearranged the incunabula at the museum and revised their entries in the catalogue, in which he was also responsible for the heading &#145;Liturgies&#146;. He soon set himself to describe every fount of type used in Europe up to 1520, and first read through the whole of the British Museum catalogue. His reputation was finally established by his &#145;Index of early printed books from the invention of printing to the year MD&#146;, issued in four parts in 1898, the result of four years' labour. He then worked on a similar index for the period 1501&#150;20, but of four projected sections only the German one was completed in his lifetime (1903).<br>
<br>Proctor's earliest contribution to bibliographical research was an article on Jan van Doesborgh, the sixteenth-century printer of Antwerp, which appeared in <span class="italic">The Library</span> in 1892 and was expanded into a monograph for the Bibliographical Society in 1894. Proctor soon read other papers before that society, for which he also prepared &#145;A classified index to the Serapeum&#146; (1897) and &#145;The printing of Greek in the fifteenth century&#146; (1900). He likewise printed for private circulation three pamphlets on early printing, published in 1895 and 1897.<br>
<br>Proctor subsequently experimented in Greek printing, adapting a beautiful type from the sixteenth-century Spanish fount used in the <span class="roman">New Testament</span> of the Complutensian polyglot <span class="roman">Bible</span>. With his new type Proctor had printed at the Chiswick Press an edition of Aeschylus' <span class="italic">Oresteia</span>, which Frederic Kenyon completed for publication in 1904. Homer's <span class="italic">Odyssey</span> was subsequently printed in the same type in 1909.<br>
<br>Interest in the work of William Morris's Kelmscott Press led to an acquaintance with Morris, with whose socialist opinions Proctor was in sympathy. On F. S. Ellis's death in 1901 Proctor became one of the trustees under Morris's will. Morris's influence developed in Proctor an enthusiasm for Icelandic literature. His first rendering of an Icelandic saga, <span class="italic">A Tale of the Weapon Firthers</span>, was printed privately in 1902 as a wedding gift for his friend Francis Jenkinson of Cambridge University Library. He later published a version of the <span class="italic">Laxd&aelig;la saga</span> (1903).<br>
<br>From boyhood Proctor, who never married, often went on long walking tours, usually with his mother, in Great Britain and on the continent and in Scandinavia. On 29 August 1903 he left London for a solitary walking tour in the Austrian Tyrol. He reached the Taschach hut in the Pitzthal on 5 September and left to cross a glacier pass without a guide. Nothing more was heard of him; he doubtless perished in a crevasse. Some have thought that suicide was a possible explanation, caused by a knowledge of his oncoming blindness. At the end of the month, when his disappearance was realized in Britain, the weather had broken and no search was possible.<br>
<br>A memorial fund was formed for the purpose of issuing his scattered <span class="italic">Bibliographical Essays</span>: the collection appeared in 1905, with a memoir by A. W. Pollard. The memorial fund also provided for the compilation and publication of the three remaining parts of Proctor's <span class="italic">Index of Early Printed Books from 1501 to 1520</span>, of which Frank Isaac published the section on Italy, Switzerland, and eastern Europe as late as 1938.<br>
<br>For the major collections of the world today &#145;Proctor order&#146; is still followed. This means that the books are arranged and described in order of country of origin, then of town, then of printer, in chronological order. Proctor order is used in the incunabula catalogues of the British Library (beginning in 1908 and still incomplete), Cambridge University Library (J. C. T. Oates, 1954), and Harvard University (James E. Walsh, beginning in 1991). Smaller collections find it more appropriate to arrange their incunabula in alphabetical order according to authors and anonymous headings.<br>
