<span class="headword">Goossens,  L&eacute;on Jean</span>  (1897&#150;1988), <span class="occ">oboist</span>, was born on 12 June 1897 in Liverpool, the third of three sons and the fourth of five children of the conductor Eug&egrave;ne Goossens (1867&#150;1958), himself the son of Eug&egrave;ne Goossens (1845&#150;1906), conductor of the Carl Rosa Opera Company. His mother was Annie (1860&#150;1946), an opera singer, and daughter of the operatic bass singer Aynsley Cook. Of Belgian origin, the family had settled in England in the 1870s and 1880s; L&eacute;on's siblings were the conductor <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/33458/', "Sir Eugene Goossens")</script>, the horn player Adolphe (who was killed in the First World War), and the harpists Marie and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/94502/', "(Annie) Sidonie Goossens")</script>. He was educated at the Christian Brothers Catholic Institute in Liverpool and Liverpool College of Music. After some study of the piano, he began learning the oboe with Charles Reynolds at the age of eight, and by the time he was ten had played professionally. After further study with William Malsch at the Royal College of Music (1911&#150;14), he was appointed principal oboe of the Queen's Hall Orchestra at the age of seventeen. Throughout his career (apart from a brief period when it was stolen) he played the same oboe, made for him by Lor&eacute;e of Paris. During the First World War Goossens volunteered in the Middlesex yeomanry and subsequently served in the 8th Royal Fusiliers before being commissioned into the Sherwood Foresters. On leaving for France in 1915 he was given a silver cigarette case as a keepsake by his brother Eugene, who had been given it by Ethel Smyth after a performance of one of her operas; it deflected a high-velocity bullet from the region of his heart, still wounding him sufficiently for him to be invalided home. He decided to accept an offer to join a friend on an Argentinian ranch; but, needing capital of &pound;100, he began earning it by freelance oboe playing, which quickly brought so many engagements that the Argentinian plan was cancelled.<br>
<br>Goossens rejoined the Queen's Hall Orchestra in 1918, and moved to Covent Garden in 1924. In the same year he became professor of oboe at the Royal Academy of Music (until 1935) and at the Royal College of Music (until 1939). He also played in the Royal Philharmonic Society's orchestra and, on its foundation by Sir Thomas Beecham in 1932, the London Philharmonic Orchestra. His playing with Beecham lent added distinction to a fine orchestra, as can be heard on records, and was heard with admiration in an early broadcast of his music by the aged Frederick Delius. Fritz Kreisler declared that among his greatest musical pleasures was listening to Goossens playing the solo in the adagio of Brahms's violin concerto before his own entry. This, too, has been recorded. Goossens was, in his own right, one of the most popular and prolific recording artists in the 1920s and 1930s. Recording companies were inexplicably slow to take him up again with the advent of the long-playing record, but he was making a comeback with a recording of J. S. Bach's violin and oboe concerto, with Yehudi Menuhin, when an accident interrupted his career.<br>
<br>Goossens had by now acquired a world reputation (he frequently toured abroad) second to that of no other oboist. More, he had given the oboe a new standing as a solo instrument. He refined the sound from the conventional German breadth and reediness, while enriching the French slenderness but elegance of tone, to a warmth and sweetness hitherto unknown. By this, and by the highly personal elegance of his phrasing, he drew attention to lyrical possibilities that quickly excited the attention of composers, while his brilliant finger technique opened up a new range of virtuosity. Almost every English composer of note was drawn to write music for him: works which he inspired and first performed included concertos by Ralph Vaughan Williams and Rutland Boughton, chamber pieces by Sir Arnold Bax, Sir Arthur Bliss, and Benjamin Britten and an uncompleted suite by Sir Edward Elgar. He was appointed CBE (1950) and FRCM (1962). He also became honorary RAM (1932).<br>
<br>In 1962, still at the height of his powers, Goossens suffered a car accident that severely damaged his teeth and lips, rendering him incapable of playing. After many operations, borne with great physical courage, and the no less courageous confrontation of the apparent end of his career, he began practising again with a newly learned lip technique. He played in film and recording orchestras away from the public view, always with the affectionate support of his colleagues. He was able to resume his professional life, though he privately insisted that the standard of his playing was not what it had been. He continued playing into his eighties, sometimes with small ensembles and modest orchestras to whom he felt an old loyalty.<br>
<br>In his prime, Goossens had earned himself a reputation as something of a prima donna among orchestral players. He would demand his own microphone in recording sessions, on the grounds that the oboe's tone needed special consideration. Colleagues in the wind section would feel obliged to fit in with phrasing that was always personal and at times mannered and unstylish. But with this awareness of his own worth, seen in his gracious platform manner in concertos, went an essential musical humility and a high degree of personal kindness. Self-disciplined in his personal life, in the interests of a musical professionalism inherited from his strict father, he enjoyed physical activities, including yachting and farming. He was always generous with his time to younger oboists, while sometimes resisting those who represented a newer stylistic wave. His charm and humour, among friends, were unaffected and engaging. He was a tall, well-built man, with a deep chest that helped his phenomenal breath control. Like his conductor brother Eugene, he went bald early and had the family's characteristic slightly hooded eyes and charming smile.<br>
<br>In 1926 Goossens married Frances Alice, daughter of Harry Oswald Yeatman, a port shipper who worked in London for Taylor, Fladgate, and Yeatman. They had one daughter. This marriage was dissolved in 1932 and in 1933 he married the dancer Leslie Burrowes (<i>d</i>. 1985), daughter of Brigadier-General Arnold Robinson Burrowes, of the Royal Irish Fusiliers. There were two daughters of this marriage. Goossens died on 13 February 1988 in Tunbridge Wells.<br>
