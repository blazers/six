<span class="headword">Robinson,  Crutch</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1804&#150;1830), <span class="occ">bookmaker</span>, played an important role in the development of betting at horse races, but nothing is known about his life off the course. He was disabled, and dependent on a crutch (hence his nickname).<br>
<br>In the early nineteenth century Robinson and others emerged as the first &#145;bookies&#146;. They stood up at racecourses and made a book on particular contests, trying to ensure a profit whatever the outcome of a race. They offered odds against each horse winning the contest; they took bets from all comers; and they adjusted the prices available according to the weight of money betted on the different runners. Robinson was joined by men like Jemmy Bland and Richards. All were from working-class backgrounds: Bland had been a post boy, Richards started out as a Leicestershire stockinger, and of Robinson it was stated that his origin was of the lowest. There was a tradition that he had been a stable boy and that he been kicked by a horse, an injury which made him lame. Often illiterate, these bookies were nevertheless clever at mental arithmetic and their memories of odds and bets were &#145;as retentive as a vice&#146;  (Rice, 269).<br>
<br>Robinson vied with Bland and Jerry Cloves as the leading figure among the first bookmakers, accepting bets as great as &pound;1000. As professional betting men they were often winners against wealthy upper-class amateur betters. Their profits gained them prosperous lifestyles but their success also drew much opprobrium from writers connected with the aristocracy. Robinson was decried as a &#145;domineering, uncouth being&#146;, his detractor exclaiming that the spectacle of a disabled old man:<blockquote>blanched by time, shouting out his odds, and dealing in the lowest bitter sarcasm and racing slang, either mounted on a four-legged brute as rough as himself, or leaning on his trusty crutch in the midst of the crushing throng, was an irreverent and disgusting sight. (Sylvanus, 127)</blockquote>Another writer felt that:<blockquote>nature must have broken the mould in which she formed the crafty Robinson, as he leant on his crutch, with his back against the Newmarket Betting Rings, and, with his knowing quiet leer and one hand in his pocket, argued about Staley Bridge Radicals with the then Lord Stanley, or offered &#145;to lay agin Plenipo&#146;. (The Druid, 47&#150;8)</blockquote>Denigrated by some, Robinson was regarded by others as &#145;withal a straightforward man&#146;  (Thormanby, 26).<br>
<br>Clearly a man of great intelligence, Robinson was knowledgeable about politics as well as horses, was alert and able to make complicated mathematical calculations in his head, and could be an &#145;amiable coloquist&#146;  (&#145;Epsom Races&#146;, 385). Robinson had much in common with &#145;Hump&#146; Chippendale, the bookmaker in Benjamin Disraeli's novel <span class="italic">Sybil</span>. Both men had a physical disability&#151;the one a severe limp, the other a hunchback&#151;and each was &#145;a democratic leg, who loved to fleece a noble, and thought all men were born equal&#146;  (Disraeli, 6). Robinson spoke in a broad dialect, &#145;a cross between Lancashire and Yorkshire&#146;  (Thormanby, 26). When he retired he went back to the north of England, setting up home on the confines of Cheshire. It is not known when he died but in 1850 it was stated that he and Bland had &#145;for some years been gathered to their fathers&#146;  (&#145;Epsom Races&#146;, 385).<br>
