<span class="headword">Jones,  Philip Stuart</span>  (1927&#150;2004), <span class="occ">television producer</span>, was born on 7 December 1927 at Elmwood, Cirencester Road, Charlton Kings, Cheltenham, the son of Harold Hartley Jones, teacher, and his wife, Mary Eva, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Long. He was educated at Cheltenham grammar school, where his father was head of languages, and did his national service in the RAF. In 1948 he joined Radio Luxembourg, which beamed commercial pop music across Europe, and during his seven years at the station rose from station assistant to programme controller. On 20 June 1953 he married Florence Elizabeth Green, a 19-year-old secretary at Radio Luxembourg, and daughter of George William Green, antiques dealer; they had two sons, one of whom predeceased him. In 1955 Jones was hired as a light-entertainment producer by the new ITV company Granada Television as it prepared to broadcast weekday programmes to British commercial television's third region, the north-west. Three years later, with experience as a producer and director, he moved to the new north-east company, Tyne Tees, which was launched in January 1959.<br>
<br>On his arrival his brief was to start an entertaining midday programme aimed at a local audience, Tyne Tees Television's <span class="italic">One O'Clock Show</span>. Jones also produced programmes featuring two popular comedians, <span class="italic">The Bobby Thompson Show</span> (1959) and <span class="italic">The Jimmy James Show</span> (1960), as well as the talent series <span class="italic">At the Golden Disc</span> (1959), presented by Tony Martell and Eric Nicholson. In 1959 he was voted producer of the year by readers of the company's listings magazine, <span class="italic">The Viewer</span>.<br>
<br>In 1961 Jones was headhunted by ABC-TV which broadcast to the north and midlands at weekends. His remit was to broaden the company's appeal. He immediately launched the iconic 1960s television pop show, <span class="italic">Thank Your Lucky Stars</span> (1961&#150;6), which included a panel of young people giving their verdicts on the latest record releases, most notably Janice Nicholls, an office clerk from the Black Country whose heavily accented &#145;Oi'll give it foive&#146; became a national catchprase. The Beatles and the Rolling Stones both made their first British national television appearances on the programme, in 1963. As ABC's head of light entertainment from 1965, Jones demonstrated his skill for spotting and nurturing talent. He made the comedians Mike and Bernie Winters hosts of the variety shows <span class="italic">Big Night Out</span> (1963) and <span class="italic">Blackpool Night Out</span> (1964&#150;5), and later gave them their own programme, <span class="italic">Mike and Bernie's Show</span> (1966&#150;72). For Tyne Tees he also directed the Dora Bryan sitcom, <span class="italic">Happily Ever After</span> (1961, 1964).<br>
<br>Jones found greater opportunities following ITV's 1968 franchise reshuffle, which saw the end of ABC and the creation of Thames Television as London's weekday franchise holder and the largest of the ITV companies. As head of light entertainment at Thames, Jones continued some of his established series, including the popular sitcom <span class="italic">Never Mind the Quality, Feel the Width</span> (1967&#150;71) and <span class="italic">Life with Cooper</span> (1966&#150;9), featuring the fez-wearing comedian Tommy Cooper, who switched to Thames and later fronted <span class="italic">The Tommy Cooper Hour</span> (1973&#150;5), <span class="italic">Cooper</span> (1975), <span class="italic">Cooper&#151;Just Like That</span> (1978), and <span class="italic">Cooper's Half Hour</span> (1980). Another long-running relationship established by Jones was with the comedian Benny Hill, whom he lured away from the BBC for <span class="italic">The Benny Hill Show</span> (1969&#150;89), which, with its saucy-postcard humour, became Thames Television's biggest export to foreign markets. Among others he persuaded to join Thames from the BBC were the comedy duo Eric Morecambe and Ernie Wise and the impersonator Mike Yarwood, although <span class="italic">The Morecambe and Wise Show</span> (1980&#150;83) and <span class="italic">Mike Yarwood in Persons</span> (1982&#150;7) were never as successful as their earlier programmes. At the same time, Jones launched the entertainer Michael Barrymore on a solo career with the series <span class="italic">Barrymore</span> (1983). He also revived two former BBC series, <span class="italic">This Is Your Life</span> (from 1969), presented by Eamonn Andrews and then Michael Aspel, and the panel game <span class="italic">What's My Line?</span> (1984&#150;90), again hosted by Andrews, followed by Angela Rippon.<br>
<br>As an executive producer at Thames Television, Jones was also responsible for many of ITV's favourite sitcoms which dominated popular viewing in the 1970s and 1980s. These included <span class="italic">Father, Dear Father</span> (1968&#150;73, 1978&#150;9), <span class="italic">For the Love of Ada</span> (1970&#150;71), <span class="italic">Bless This House</span> (1971&#150;6), <span class="italic">Love Thy Neighbour</span> (1972&#150;6), <span class="italic">Man About the House</span> (1973&#150;6), <span class="italic">Shelley</span> (1979&#150;89), and <span class="italic">Fresh Fields</span> (1984&#150;6). Although some critics derided these populist programmes, Jones showed his innovativeness when he revived the television career of disc-jockey Kenny Everett whose eponymous <span class="italic">Video Show</span> ran between 1978 and 1980. He was himself dismissive of what he considered snobbish criticisms of light entertainment. Success was measured in his programmes' ratings and appeal to a broad range of viewers, and in an ability&#151;due largely to his deserved reputation as likeable and trustworthy&#151;to attract and retain the best performers. He was appointed OBE in 1977. After retiring from Thames in 1988, he was executive producer of the BBC sitcom <span class="italic">As Time Goes By</span> (1992&#150;2002), made by an independent company. He died of cancer of the brain at his home, 26 Trowlock Avenue, Teddington, Middlesex, on 7 May 2004, and was survived by his wife and son.<br>
