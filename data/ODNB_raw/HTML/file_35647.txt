<span class="headword">Crocker,  Henry  Radcliffe-</span>  (1846&#150;1909), <span class="occ">dermatologist</span>, was born Henry Radcliffe Crocker on 6 March 1846 at Western Road, Hove, Sussex, the son of Henry Radcliffe Crocker, a chemist and druggist, and his wife, Maria, formerly Walters. He was generally called by his middle name, Radcliffe, rather than his first name, Henry; in time this usage suggested the compound surname Radcliffe Crocker or Radcliffe-Crocker. He was educated at a private school in Brighton until, aged sixteen, he became an apprentice with a general practitioner, possibly Dr Ralph Goodall, in Silverdale, Staffordshire. Crocker's initial intention was presumably to follow his father as a pharmacist but, despite straitened circumstances, he studied hard and in 1870 gained entry to University College Hospital medical school in London. Part-time employment as a dispenser to a doctor in Sloane Street helped to support his brilliant undergraduate career. He was awarded the gold medals in materia medica and clinical medicine in 1872, which were followed two years later by the university scholarship and the gold medal in forensic medicine together with honours in medicine and obstetrics. He obtained his MRCS in 1873, LRCP and BS (London) in 1874, and his MD the following year.<br>
<br>Crocker's first appointment was as resident obstetric physician and physician's assistant at University College Hospital. The delayed start to his medical career gave that institution a more mature and confident junior doctor than was normally found. These qualities were also recognized by his fellow practitioners and he was able to supplement his income by tutoring as he progressed through the posts of clinical assistant at the Brompton Hospital for Consumption and Diseases of the Chest and a further six months as resident medical officer at Charing Cross Hospital. His training continued in 1875 with his return to University College Hospital as resident medical officer and one year later he became the assistant medical officer in its dermatology department. There he came under the influence of William Tilbury Fox who inspired in Crocker the abiding interest in skin disease that developed into his career.<br>
<br>Crocker continued to broaden his experience by taking appointments as assistant physician and pathologist to the East London Hospital for Sick Children at Shadwell in 1878 and six years later he became honorary physician there, an association he maintained until 1893. He became a member of the Royal College of Physicians in 1877 and a fellow ten years later.<br>
<br>The tragic death in 1879 of William Tilbury Fox at the early age of forty-two gave Crocker the opportunity to succeed him as physician and dermatologist to University College Hospital. There were very few dermatologists in England and prejudice against the continental practice of specialization persisted among physicians. However, Crocker had acquired a wide base of medical knowledge and he steadily evolved a method of considering a skin disorder as part of the patient's overall condition which led him to direct therapy through both topical and systemic modalities. In so doing he retained his colleagues' respect and, as the necessity for specialization in the light of increasing medical knowledge was slowly accepted they credited Crocker and Tilbury Fox with &#145;bringing some semblance of order to the subject&#146;  (Gold, 23). Crocker was one of the first to appreciate the value of microscopic examination of a skin biopsy and undertook some of the earliest thorough epidemiological investigations of skin disease. His many scientific publications included the first descriptions of a number of important skin disorders including granuloma annulare and erythema elevatum diutinum, and he is credited with the identification of micrococci as the causative agents of impetigo. In England he pioneered the application of X-rays in the management of inflammatory skin disease and the use of Koch's treatment of lupus vulgaris with tuberculin. Concern for his patient, though, always tempered his thirst for innovation with a sober assessment of its value.<br>
<br>On 3 April 1880, established in his substantive post, Crocker married Constance Mary, the daughter of Edward Francis Fussell, medical officer of health for east Sussex and physician at Sussex County Hospital. Crocker's developing reputation attracted increasing numbers of private patients and, from 1889, he consulted from rooms at 121 Harley Street. The couple had no children but, in 1898, their increased prosperity allowed the purchase of a country residence at Bourne End, Buckinghamshire.<br>
<br>Crocker was a member of the court of examiners of the Society of Apothecaries from 1880 to 1896. An active interest in medical politics encouraged him to take office within the British Medical Association. He began as honorary secretary of the metropolitan counties branch (1889&#150;91), he was appointed to council from 1890 to 1904, and high esteem for his business and organizing abilities resulted in his election as treasurer (1905&#150;7). He was deeply involved in the redevelopment of the association's headquarters in the Strand and participated in the management of the <span class="italic">British Medical Journal</span>. His regular contributions on dermatological and ethical matters to this journal and its rival, <span class="italic">The Lancet</span>, were well received by their readers and for many years he taught the fundamentals of medical ethics to each new intake of students at University College Hospital.<br>
<br>For the last twenty years of his life Crocker was the doyen of British dermatologists; his professional stature has been compared with that of his contemporary Ernest Besnier in Paris. He was founder member of the Dermatological Society of London which functioned as the training ground for these new specialists. He was also an early participant in the Dermatological Society of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, later serving on its council and as its president in 1899. When, in 1905, these two societies were merged to form the Royal Society of Medicine, Radcliffe-Crocker was elected as the first president of its dermatological section. Nevertheless, he was able to maintain his position in mainstream medicine, as evidenced by the invitation in 1903 to deliver the prestigious Lettsomian lectures to the Medical Society of London and by his position on the council of the Royal College of Physicians from 1906 to 1908.<br>
<br>Crocker's avid reading and retentive memory facilitated the production of his textbook <span class="italic">Diseases of the Skin: their Description, Pathology, Diagnosis and Treatment</span>, which was first published in 1888 and exemplified his lucid and comprehensive writing style. For many years it was the most highly regarded on the subject in English and it ran to several editions. It was followed between 1893 and 1896 by the monthly instalments of <span class="italic">The Atlas of Diseases of the Skin</span>. Dermatological societies in America, France, Germany, and Italy recognized his pre-eminence in the speciality, elected him to their membership, and valued his attendance and contributions to their meetings.<br>
<br>As a young man Crocker went about his work with an air of grave determination, but he was not aloof and remained generally good humoured and capable of sharing a joke. Above middle height he had a fine physique and participated in a number of sporting activities including cycling, sculling, and lawn tennis. He particularly enjoyed travel but in later life his health was undermined by recurrent attacks of erysipelas, of which the final and most severe precipitated his resignation from his posts at the British Medical Association and induced a desire to step down from his duties at University College Hospital. His colleagues persuaded him to reconsider and, in the summer of 1909, he embarked on a holiday to the Swiss alpine village of Engelberg, where he hoped to complete his recuperation. On 22 August he died suddenly from heart failure while sitting in his hotel. His burial took place at Engelberg. In 1912 Mrs Radcliffe-Crocker donated his extensive library of dermatological works in various languages to University College Hospital medical school together with &pound;1500 for the foundation of a dermatological travelling scholarship.<br>
