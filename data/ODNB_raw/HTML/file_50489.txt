<span class="headword">Turner,  Merfyn Lloyd</span>  (1915&#150;1991), <span class="occ">penal reformer and author</span>, was born on 20 October 1915 in Pen-y-graig, Rhondda, Glamorgan, the third of four children of Edward Godfrey Turner (1873&#150;1954) and his wife, Lizzie Violet, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Lloyd (1889&#150;1979). The family's first language was Welsh. Turner's father, a Wesleyan minister, moved his ministry every three years and the children went from manse to manse throughout Wales, attending local schools. Turner took an arts degree at the University College of Wales, Aberystwyth (1935&#150;8), where he won the Gladstone prize for history, and he gained a teaching certificate at Westminster College, London (1938&#150;9).<br>
<br>In 1940 Turner, a lifelong pacifist, was rejected as a conscientious objector and sentenced to three months' hard labour in Swansea gaol. This experience was seminal, and nurtured in Turner a passionate commitment to those on the margins of &#145;normal&#146; society, especially those in prison. He said of his own prison experience, &#145;I felt as if all the world had abandoned me&#146; and he never forgot how &#145;prison degraded the man&#146;  (<span class="italic">In Prison</span>). On release he was active in social work in Cardiff, establishing a youth club in Tiger Bay, working with the pacifist service unit, and playing football as an amateur for Cardiff City. In 1944 he moved to Oxford House, the settlement in Bethnal Green, London, and the seedbed for many social work pioneers, whom Turner viewed as kindred revolutionaries, &#145;comradeship in practice&#146;. He lived and worked in London for the rest of his life, though maintaining a Welsh base. He was appointed warden of the Webbe Boys' Club in Bethnal Green but characteristically became drawn to those boys who would not join that or any other club, the &#145;unclubbables&#146;. Encouraged in that interest by a committee of like-minded individuals, some of whom remained closely associated with Turner's work for over forty years, funding was obtained from the London Parochial Charities (now the City Parochial Foundation) to acquire a barge moored at Wapping. In 1949 the Barge Club experiment for &#145;unclubbable&#146; boys began, with Turner as the worker until 1952. It was his first innovative success.<br>
<br>All his life Turner kept notes on his work (in Welsh or English). In both languages he wrote numerous articles, and gave countless talks, including memorable ones on the BBC in the 1950s and 1960s. He wrote very little about himself, but in an early Barge Club report described himself as &#145;unclubbable&#146;. He was a left-handed nonconformist who essentially worked on his own initiatives, not fitting easily into existing structures. He was not conventionally charismatic but he inspired others. Angular and lean, he had a quiet presence, unnoticed in many gatherings. Yet whenever he spoke, be it to one or a hundred, he was clear, persistent, and persuasive. He rooted his arguments in the real experience of men he knew in prison or in lodging-houses. Few conversations with him progressed far without him saying, &#145;I was talking to a man in prison last night&#146;. His vision was of practical compassion because, as he concluded in his BBC Wales lecture for 1971, &#145;Who cares?&#146;, &#145;we know that if we exclude the undeserving from our society, we ourselves will also be diminished by their absence and by their loss&#146;  (Cook, 205). His own prison experience led him in 1946 to become a voluntary prison visitor at Pentonville prison, where he visited regularly until March 1991. He saw men leaving prison homeless, isolated, and unrecognized by society. Turner spent three months living in a common lodging-house, the usual bleak destination of &#145;inadequate&#146; ex-prisoners. By 1953 he had developed his scheme to establish Norman House, a family home for twelve homeless former prisoners. It was funded by the London Parochial Charities, and opened in 1955 with Turner as the worker. He believed that to give former prisoners a chance was &#145;not an act of charity but a matter of right&#146;  (ibid., 67). The experience of the house was to be one of &#145;great difficulty, crisis and ultimate success&#146;  (ibid., 79). It changed forever the penal system's, and society's, thinking about prison aftercare. This, the original &#145;half-way house&#146;, was the second and greater of Turner's pioneering initiatives, and it stimulated a national and international network.<br>
<br>The Norman House truly became a family home when on 12 August 1955 Turner married Shirley Elizabeth Davis (<i>b</i>. 1932), a young barrister who had applied to become a befriender to the residents. They lived there until 1960, and Turner also undertook in 1959 a detailed study of lodging-houses. They had five children. From 1960 to 1980 Turner&#151;funded by the City Parochial Foundation, the Gulbenkian Foundation, and others&#151;worked tirelessly to spread the idea of aftercare hostels at home and abroad and to advocate effective alternatives to prison. He also visited patients in Broadmoor and extended aftercare opportunities to them. After retiring in 1980 he continued as before, and developed a particular interest in men in the deportation wing in Pentonville as well as visiting Western prisoners in Turkish prisons.<br>
<br>Turner was a modest and humorous man with a passion for all things Welsh, from poetry to rugby, and was especially proud of the honorary doctorate conferred on him by the University of Wales in 1982. His writings, including correspondence with men in prison, continued until just before his death. He published four major books, which described particular aspects of his work and distinctive approach in detail. <span class="italic">Ships without Sails</span> appeared in 1953, followed by <span class="italic">Forgotten Men</span> (1960), <span class="italic">Safe Lodging</span> (1961), and <span class="italic">A Pretty Sort of Prison</span> (1964). Unpublished material was subsequently deposited at the Institute of Criminology, Cambridge. He died of cancer on 6 August 1991 in the Royal Free Hospital, London, and was cremated at St Marylebone crematorium six days later. His wife survived him.<br>
