<span class="headword">Hodgkin,  Thomas</span>  (1798&#150;1866), <span class="occ">physician and social reformer</span>, was born on 17 August 1798 in Pentonville, London, the third of the four sons (two died young) of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13427/', "John Hodgkin (1766&#150;1845)")</script>, calligrapher and teacher, and his wife, Elizabeth (1768&#150;1833), daughter of Richard Peters Rickman and his wife, Mary (Verrall) and a cousin of the architect Thomas Rickman. Both families had been Quakers since the mid-seventeenth century. Hodgkin was educated at home along with his younger brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13428/', "John Hodgkin (1800&#150;1875)")</script>, until 1816, when he became private secretary to William Allen, apothecary, scientist, and social activist. Allen introduced him to medicine and also reinforced his Quaker concerns for social reform. When an apprenticeship with Allen could not be arranged, Hodgkin was articled to an apothecary firm in Brighton.<br>
<br>Hodgkin quickly recognized that medicine better suited his interests, and spent a year walking the wards at Guy's Hospital, London. In 1820 he enrolled at the University of Edinburgh, where he received the MD in 1823. His thesis, <span class="italic">De absorbendi functione</span>, received praise for the excellence of the Latin prose. Hodgkin interrupted his Edinburgh studies with a year in Paris, where he gave particular attention to morbid anatomy (pathology) and learned to use the stethoscope from R. T. H. Laennec. On his return from Paris, he introduced the stethoscope to the Physical Society of Guy's Hospital.<br>
<br>Following his graduation, Hodgkin spent two more years on the continent, initially as physician and travelling companion to Abraham Montefiore, afterwards in additional medical studies in Paris. Returning to London in 1825, he became a licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians and was appointed lecturer in morbid anatomy and curator of the anatomical museum of Guy's Hospital medical school. There he gave the first systematic lectures on morbid anatomy in England, conducted numerous autopsies, prepared many exhibits, and published a catalogue for the museum (1829). His significant medical papers included those on the discovery of the striated appearance of voluntary muscles, and a description of the shape of erythrocytes (1827); studies of carcinoma (1829); a description, before Sir Dominic Corrigan, of retroversion of aortic valves (1829); and discussion of the 1832 cholera epidemic. The paper that gained him eponymous fame, &#145;On some morbid appearances of the absorbent glands and spleen&#146;  (<span class="italic">Medico-Chirurgical Transactions</span>, 17, 1832, 68&#150;114), described seven cases with an unusual appearance of the lymph glands and spleen. Sir Samuel Wilks made similar observations more than thirty years later, and recalling Hodgkin's earlier paper, it was he who named the disorder Hodgkin's disease. Two of Hodgkin's cases, and possibly one other, have since been verified as meeting histological criteria for Hodgkin's disease. Hodgkin's books included <span class="italic">Lectures on the Means of Promoting and Preserving Health</span> (1835), based on lectures delivered at the Spitalfields Mechanics' Institute, and <span class="italic">Lectures on the Morbid Anatomy of the Serous and Mucous Membranes</span> (vol. 1, 1836; vol. 2, 1840).<br>
<br>Simultaneously, Hodgkin was active in reform, publishing <span class="italic">An Essay on Medical Education</span> in 1828, and serving on the general committee of the British and Foreign School Society. He advocated the colonization of Africa by freed American black people as a solution to slavery, supported the American Colonization Society, and created the British African Colonization Society for the further promotion of colonization in Liberia. His youthful concern for the plight of North American Indians became a lifelong defence of all indigenous groups threatened by the advance of Western civilization. He was one of the founders of the Aborigines' Protection Society, and its foremost spokesman. In 1836 he was appointed to the senate of the newly organized University of London and remained active in its oversight of medical education.<br>
<br>Hodgkin expected to be promoted assistant physician at Guy's in 1837 and was bitterly disappointed when he did not receive the post. The rejection was due to the animosity of Benjamin Harrison, treasurer of the hospital, who disliked Hodgkin's Quaker practices and his reformist activities, particularly those relating to the treatment of Indians by the Hudson's Bay Company, of which Harrison was deputy chairman. None the less, Hodgkin is remembered as one of the &#145;great triumvirate of Guy's&#146;  (Cameron, 127).<br>
<br>Following his rejection, Hodgkin resigned from Guy's and developed a small private practice. He often treated poor patients gratis and was known to undercharge rather than take advantage of anyone's pocket. He spent 1842&#150;3 teaching at St Thomas's Hospital medical school.<br>
<br>Hodgkin wanted to marry his first cousin, Sarah Godlee, but Quaker practice forbade it. He remained a bachelor until 3 January 1850, when at the age of fifty-one he married Sarah Frances Callow Scaife (1804&#150;1875), a widow, whose husband had been Hodgkin's patient. The couple lived at 35 Bedford Square, London. Hodgkin had no children of his own but was devoted to his brother, John, and to his eleven children, from whom the distinguished Hodgkin family is descended. This includes the historian Thomas Hodgkin (1831&#150;1913), Sir Alan Hodgkin, winner of the Nobel prize for medicine, and Robin Hodgkin, mountaineer.<br>
<br>Hodgkin adhered loyally to Quaker tenets. He dressed in Quaker garb and used Quaker speech patterns. In 1837 he refused fellowship in the Royal Society of Physicians: non-Anglicans were not customarily admitted to the fellowship, and Hodgkin, who regarded his nomination as something which would place him in an invidious position, did not want exemption from a discriminatory rule.<br>
<br>Hodgkin increasingly devoted his time to non-professional activities. He continued to support Liberia and other schemes for African colonization. He was a founder of the Ethnological Society of London and active in the British Association for the Advancement of Science, especially the section dealing with ethnology. He was honorary secretary of the Royal Geographical Society for fourteen years and then honorary foreign secretary. He also worked for the Syrian Medical Aid Society which sent physicians to Beirut and Damascus. Hodgkin's persistence, often in the face of public indifference to or disapproval of some of the causes he espoused, was one of his more remarkable characteristics.<br>
<br>As a result of his travels with Abraham Montefiore, Hodgkin became a good friend of Sir Moses Montefiore, the Anglo-Jewish leader and philanthropist. He accompanied Montefiore as personal physician on five overseas missions for the relief of oppressed Jews, to places including the Holy Land, Morocco, and Constantinople. Hodgkin died of dysentery, or possibly cholera, in Jaffa, Palestine, on 4 April 1866, while travelling with Montefiore, and was buried there on 5 April in the protestant cemetery. Montefiore, heart-stricken at the loss of his friend, had a granite obelisk placed over the grave, to mark their friendship and commemorate Hodgkin as &#145;a man distinguished alike for scientific attainments, medical skill, and self-sacrificing philanthropy&#146;.<br>
