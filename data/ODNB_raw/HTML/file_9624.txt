<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Fitzpatrick,  Richard</span>  (1748&#150;1813), <span class="occ">army officer, politician, and poet</span>, was born on 24 January 1748, the second son of John Fitzpatrick, second Baron Gowran in the peerage of Ireland (1719&#150;1758) who was created earl of Upper Ossory in 1751, and his wife, Evelyn (1725&#150;1763), daughter of John Leveson-Gower, first Earl Gower. His elder brother John Fitzpatrick (1745&#150;1818) was MP for Bedfordshire from 1767 to 1794, when he was created Baron Upper Ossory in the British peerage. Having been educated at Westminster School (1764) and Caen military academy (1767), Fitzpatrick joined the 1st foot (later Grenadier) guards in 1765 and was promoted lieutenant and captain in 1772. He had by then formed an intimate friendship with Charles James Fox, whose brother Stephen, later second Baron Holland, had married Fitzpatrick's sister Mary in 1766. Drawn together by a love of reckless gambling, fast living, and witty conversation they developed a close personal and political relationship that was ended only by Fox's death in 1806. Fitzpatrick was a talented writer of satirical verse&#151;he published <span class="italic">The Bath Picture</span> (1771) and <span class="italic">Dorinda: a Town Eclogue</span> (1775)&#151;a bon viveur, and a balloonist.<br>
<br>Fitzpatrick was returned to parliament for Okehampton on the interest of his maternal uncle, the fourth duke of Bedford, in 1770, and from 1774 until 1807 he sat for the Bedford pocket borough, Tavistock, on the interest of the fifth and sixth dukes. He supported the North ministry until the outbreak of the American War of Independence in 1776, when he followed Fox into opposition. In early 1777 he was ordered to join his battalion in America, where he served with credit in various actions until his return to England as a captain and lieutenant-colonel in May 1778. His experience reinforced his hostility to the war and, while he was never a frequent parliamentary speaker, he became a leading figure in the whig opposition, constantly advising Fox, who greatly valued his judgement. Their attempt in 1781 to restore their ruined personal finances by setting up a faro bank at Brooks's Club (which Fitzpatrick had joined in 1766) only made matters worse. Fitzpatrick served as chief secretary to the lord lieutenant of Ireland, the duke of Portland, in the Rockingham administration (March&#150;July 1782) and sat in the Irish parliament for Maryborough (1782&#150;3). He opposed the Shelburne ministry, played a key role in the negotiations to form the Fox&#150;North coalition, and was rewarded with the secretaryship at war when it was in power under Portland (April&#150;December 1783).<br>
<br>A founder member of the Whig Club in 1784, a principal contributor to <span class="italic">The Rolliad</span>, and a manager of Warren Hastings's impeachment, Fitzpatrick was at Fox's right hand in opposition to Pitt's first ministry for the next seventeen years. He supported parliamentary reform and opposed the French war in 1793, and the following year saw his brother defect to government with the Portland whigs. He took up the case of his friend the marquis de Lafayette and proposed on 17 March 1794 to invite the king to intervene to secure his release from an Austrian gaol but was defeated by 155 to 48. He again unsuccessfully moved for royal intercession on 16 December 1796; he subsequently helped to promote a subscription to ease Lafayette's financial problems. After failing to talk Fox out of the secession from parliament he largely joined in it himself, but Fox persuaded him not to resign his privy councillorship in protest at his own dismissal in May 1798. He strongly resisted the Irish Union. He participated in the Foxite exodus to Paris after the peace of Amiens in 1802, opposed the resumption of war in 1803 (when he reached the rank of general), and took part in the combined parliamentary attack that brought down Addington's administration in 1804. He was a steady opponent of Pitt's second ministry but in March 1805 he got its assistance in having his improvements to court martial procedure incorporated in the <span class="roman">Militia Bill</span>.<br>
<br>Fitzpatrick was an almost automatic choice as secretary at war when Fox came to power under Lord Grenville in February 1806 but Fox's death seven months later dulled his appetite for political life. He was now in poor health and underwent an operation to remove a growth from his chest late in 1806. A planned arrangement to replace him with the disgruntled Samuel Whitbread as soon as he could be suitably provided for was not implemented before the fall of the government in March 1807. At the general election in May he was a reluctant candidate for Bedfordshire, on the Woburn interest, while retaining his option on Tavistock, and was narrowly returned after a punishing contest. An unashamedly negligent county member, who felt that too much was expected of him in his decrepit state, he was often absent from the 1807 parliament, though he generally voted with the opposition on major issues and continued his support for reform and Catholic emancipation. When the whigs were cabinet-making in January 1811 he renounced his claim to office after learning from his nephew the third Baron Holland that Lord Grey felt obliged to exclude him for a younger man. Fitzpatrick, whose financial embarrassments&#151;largely resulting from gambling losses&#151;were relieved in 1811 by a legacy of &pound;1000 and an annuity of &pound;500 from the fourth duke of Queensberry, was returned for Tavistock as a locum for Bedford's youngest son in 1812. He died, unmarried, in South Street, Grosvenor Square, Mayfair, Westminster, on 25 April 1813. Holland recalled him as &#145;the most agreeable man I ever conversed with&#146;  (Holland, 171).<br>
