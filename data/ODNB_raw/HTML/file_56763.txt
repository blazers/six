<span class="headword">Hoskins,  Percy Kellick</span>  (1904&#150;1989), <span class="occ">journalist</span>, was born on 28 December 1904 at Bothenhampton, Burton Bradstock, Bridport, Dorset, the son of John Hoskins, chief officer of coastguards, and his wife, Sarah Rose Trevett. After a career of sixty years reporting crime, Hoskins rejoiced in his boast that a life so devoted to crime and punishment should have begun on Holy Innocents' day in Bridport, where once they made the hangman's rope. He was educated locally at Bridport. Hoskins was nineteen when he went to London to join the <span class="italic">Evening Standard</span> as a reporter. Nine years later he was crime reporter on the <span class="italic">Standard</span>'s sister paper, the <span class="italic">Daily Express</span>. His catalogue of successes was formidable. He wrote the first account of the disappearance of Guy Burgess and Donald Maclean, the Foreign Office diplomats who defected to Moscow. But his most memorable case was his campaign in support of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30748/', "Dr John Bodkin Adams")</script>, a fashionable Eastbourne doctor. In the years up to 1956 a number of wealthy widows living in the district had died. There was much local gossip; then an inquest on one widow brought about a police inquiry and Scotland Yard was called in. The national newspapers printed sensational accounts of the affair. There was talk of the exhumation of ten women, of the wills of 400 people being examined, even of the possibility of a local &#145;Bluebeard&#146;.<br>
<br>Hoskins was suspicious of the briefings that the police were giving to newspapers and decided that the rumour and vilification of Dr Adams had reached a point where a fair trial might be impossible. With the backing of his editor, Edward Pickering, he launched a one-man campaign attacking trial by newspaper. The <span class="italic">Daily Express</span> stood alone. Even the proprietor, Lord Beaverbrook, had doubts. On his morning walks with the editor, he would repeatedly say, &#145;I hope and pray you are right&#146;  (private information).<br>
<br>On 19 December 1956 Dr Adams was charged with the murder of an eighty-year-old woman patient. In March 1957 his trial opened at the Old Bailey. It proved to be a chapter in legal history. Lord Devlin was the judge; the attorney-general, Sir Reginald Manningham-Buller, prosecuted, with Melford Stevenson QC as his junior. Geoffrey Lawrence QC defended. The weight of evidence seemed to be going against the doctor when Lawrence dramatically produced the diaries kept by the nurses going back several years which contradicted claims of improper administration of drugs. On 9 April 1957 Dr Adams was found not guilty. On that day Hoskins received a telephone call from Lord Beaverbrook: &#145;Two men have been acquitted today: Adams and Hoskins&#146;&#151;a phrase that Hoskins adapted for his own sparkling book on the trial.<br>
<br>The importance of the Bodkin Adams case, and Hoskins's part in it, was demonstrated by the fact that it brought about a fundamental change in criminal law. The Tucker committee was set up and its findings resulted in the <span class="roman">Criminal Justice Act</span> of 1967 laying down a change to the restrictions on the reporting of proceedings in magistrates' courts, leaving the choice of publicity or no publicity to the defence. It also highlighted the medical and ethical problems a doctor faces in treating aged and sick patients&#151;a dilemma brilliantly expounded by Lord Devlin in his book <span class="italic">Easing the Passing</span> (1986).<br>
<br>For some years Hoskins was chairman of the Crime Reporters' Association and was largely responsible for improving relations between police and the press. He was a regular lecturer at police colleges and training schools. He married while still a young man, but the relationship was not long-lasting. The couple nevertheless had a daughter. One of Hoskins's great strengths as a newspaperman was the wide circle of contacts and friends that he maintained in many fields, and in this he was greatly helped by his subsequent partner, Jeannie Fettes Smith (1909&#150;1986). Although the couple never married, this was not publicly known; and she took his name by deed poll. Jeannie Hoskins was the founder of Celebrity Services, which looked after the London schedules for visiting politicians, film stars, and actors. Consequently, on any night in their flat at 55 Park Lane, one was liable to encounter high-ranking police officers, ministers of the crown, publishers, Hollywood beauties, and editors.<br>
<br>Hoskins was president of the Saints and Sinners Club, which he had founded with Jack Hylton, the bandleader, in 1947, an organization which raised many hundreds of thousands of pounds for charity, and endowed the Percy Hoskins scholarship at Sheffield University's School of Journalism. The club also raised more than &pound;40,000 to endow the Jeannie Hoskins memorial suite in King's College Hospital, London, and later, in 1991, sponsored two suites with full intensive care facilities in memory of Hoskins. For his work in journalism and for charity he was made CBE in 1976.<br>
<br>All this daily activity and Hoskins's frequent visits to health farms had little effect on his Alfred Hitchcock-like figure. His rich Dorset burr stayed with him, as did a magnificent bass voice that came from years of church-choir training. He was capable on occasions of bursting into song&#151;a Stanford or a Mendelssohn anthem or an operatic aria. He wrote several books dealing with crime, including <span class="italic">No Hiding Place</span> (1951), a title made famous in a television series.<br>
<br>Hoskins died at his home, 65 Kingsway Court, Queens Gardens, Hove, on 5 February 1989 from cerebral thrombosis. He was cremated in Hove. Jeannie Hoskins had died three years earlier in 1986.<br>
