<span class="headword">Read,  Walter William</span>  (1855&#150;1907), <span class="occ">cricketer</span>, son of Robert Read and Elizabeth Jane, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Allwork, was born in West Street, Reigate, Surrey, on 23 November 1855. He was educated at the Reigate Priory School, of which his father was headmaster. For Reigate Priory club, at the age of thirteen, he scored 78 not out against Tonbridge. In 1873 he was introduced to Charles William Alcock, the secretary of Surrey County Cricket Club, and he played for the county from that date until 1897. He played an important part in Surrey's success in winning the county championship in every year except one between 1887 and 1895. He made 366 appearances and when at his best, in the late 1880s, he scored in successive matches in June 1887 against Lancashire and against Cambridge University 247 and 244 not out respectively, and, in the following year, 338 against Oxford University.<br>
<br>Read played on twenty-three occasions for the Gentlemen against the Players (1877&#150;95), making 159 at the Oval in 1885. He also made seventeen appearances for England against Australia (1882&#150;93), his most memorable performance being in 1884. Despite the fact that he was top of his county averages, his captain, Lord Harris, put him in to bat at number ten. Read responded with 117 runs, which over a century later was still the highest score to have been made by an England number ten. Two of his tests were in Australia, where two sides visited in 1887&#150;8. On that occasion Read captained an England eleven drawn from both visiting sides. He led England to victory, as he did in South Africa at Cape Town in March 1892.<br>
<br>In his career Read scored 22,349 runs and made thirty-eight centuries. Of strong physique, he was a punishing front-foot player and a very safe fielder, especially at point. From being a fast right-arm bowler, he became a slow left-arm &#145;lob&#146; or underarm bowler. Like W. G. Grace, he provides an outstanding example of an amateur of his day being rewarded financially as if he were a professional. After assisting in his father's school, he was assistant secretary of Surrey County Cricket Club (1881&#150;97) at a salary of &pound;100 per annum. The county records give little indication of his doing very much work in the post. Surrey regularly gave him a bonus of &pound;100 a season and they awarded him match expenses of 4 guineas. A testimonial raised &pound;800 and he was twice given an <i>ex gratia</i> payment of &pound;250. A partnership in an auctioneering and surveying firm in the City of London also assisted his finances.<br>
<br>John Shuter, Read's county captain, in an introduction to the latter's <span class="italic">Annals of Cricket</span> (1896), called him a model cricketer, modest and unassuming. The book itself is a secondary source on the game, drawing heavily on such authorities as James Pycroft. Read, a married man with three sons and a daughter, died on 6 January 1907 at 5 Colworth Road, off Bingham Road, Addiscombe Park, Croydon, and was buried at Shirley cemetery.<br>
