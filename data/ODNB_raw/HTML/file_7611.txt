<span class="headword">Dickson,  Adam</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1721, <em>d.</em> 1776), <span class="occ">agricultural writer</span>, was baptized on 5 October 1721 at Aberlady, Haddingtonshire, the son of the Revd Andrew Dickson, minister of Aberlady, and his wife, Agnes Burnside. He studied at Edinburgh University, and took the degree of MA in 1744. In 1742 he married Anne Haldane. They had one son and one daughter. From his childhood his father had intended him to go into the church, and Dickson was presented in 1748 as minister of Duns in Berwickshire, though he did not take up the post until 1750, after a long lawsuit on the subject of the presentation, which went to the House of Lords. He soon lived down the opposition which this raised in his parish. After twenty years at Duns, he was transferred in 1769 to Whittingham in Haddingtonshire.<br>
<br>Dickson became interested in farming at an early age, and after moving to Duns he decided to write <span class="italic">A Treatise on Agriculture</span>. The first volume of this appeared in 1762, and was followed by a second in 1769. A new edition was published in 1785. Concerned with farming in Scotland, the first four books of this work dealt with soils, tillage, and manures in general; the other four concentrated on problems of farm management. One section, an essay on manures, was reprinted in Alexander Hunter's <span class="italic">Georgical Essays</span> (1770); it attacked Jethro Tull, who held that careful ploughing alone provided adequate fertilization for the soil. Dickson also wrote <span class="italic">Small Farms Destructive to the Country in its Present Situation</span> (1764), and <span class="italic">An Essay on the Causes of the Present High Prices of Provisions etc.</span> (1773).<br>
<br>Dickson died on 25 March 1776 at Whittingham, after falling from his horse. Twelve years after his death the work by which he was best known was printed, with a dedication to the duke of Buccleuch. Entitled <span class="italic">The Husbandry of the Ancients</span> (1788), this had been written at the end of Dickson's life, after many years devoted to studying ancient writers on agriculture. He compared ancient agricultural practice with the practice of his day. The first volume discussed the Roman villa, and crops, manures, and ploughs; the second dealt with the different ancient crops and the times of sowing. He translated freely from Latin sources, and his scholarship was often faulty. The book was translated into French in 1802.<br>
