<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Fitch,  Walter Hood</span>  (1817&#150;1892), <span class="occ">botanical artist and lithographer</span>, was born on 29 January 1817 in Lanark, Scotland, the second son of five children of John Fitch (1790&#150;<i>c</i>.1850), cloth merchant, and his wife, Catherine Maria Hood (1786&#150;1859), a milliner and dressmaker. After a year at Leeds grammar school, Fitch began his art training in 1828 in Glasgow, with Andrew Donaldson (1790&#150;1846), the Scottish painter. This was augmented by a lithography course in 1829&#150;30, after which he became an apprentice pattern-drawer in Glasgow's textile industry.<br>
<br>In 1832 Fitch was introduced to botany by William Jackson Hooker (1785&#150;1865), professor of botany at Glasgow University and editor of <span class="italic">Curtis's Botanical Magazine</span>. Impressed by Fitch's great facility for speed, accuracy, and composition when drawing floral patterns for calico printing, Hooker bought him out of his apprenticeship mid-term. He showed great facility. Fitch also developed the art of lithography at a time when the process was rarely used for botanical work, and perfected an almost-legendary skill of working from rehydrated dried specimens.<br>
<br>Fitch's first published plate, of <i>Mimulus roseus</i>, appeared in <span class="italic">Curtis's Botanical Magazine</span> (61, March 1834, no. 3353). He was to make nearly 3000 drawings for this magazine and a further 9000 for other publications, ranging from small, woodcut illustrations for George Bentham's <span class="italic">Handbook of the British Flora</span> (1862&#150;5) to coloured lithographic folios of <i>Victoria regia</i> (now <i>amazonica</i>) (1851) for J. D. Hooker's <span class="italic">Illustrations of Himalayan Plants</span> (1855). His early works were outline pencil drawings with sepia-washed shading to guide the engraver who copied them onto copper prior to printing, but by 1836, working from dried plants for W. J. Hooker's <span class="italic">Icones plantarum</span> (12 vols., 1836&#150;54, 1867&#150;76), Fitch had made his first original lithographs&#151;outline ink-drawings on transfer-paper for offsetting onto litho stone. Later he drew with litho chalk/crayon directly onto the stone, making a continuous tone for shading in place of the engraver's hatched line and so controlling the quality of his image. Unfortunately chalk litho-printing was temperamental and Fitch's work was often spoilt by inept printers, as was the zinc lithography for W. J. Hooker's <span class="italic">Genera Filicum</span> (1838&#150;42). However, by 1845 he was making successful chalk-lithographs for <span class="italic">Curtis's Botanical Magazine</span>. The culmination of this first period of work was Fitch's visits to Woburn Abbey in 1838 and 1839 to make watercolours of cactus flowers for the duke of Bedford.<br>
<br>In 1841, when Hooker became director of the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, Fitch (still paid by Hooker) accompanied him. He was to illustrate nearly every book issued from Kew over the next forty years. By 1844 he had begun plates for J. D. Hooker's <span class="italic">The Botany of the Antarctic Voyage</span> (3 vols., 1844&#150;59), followed in 1846 by work for other botanists. Living in various houses around Kew Green, he was an integral part of Kew's botanical milieu. On 5 December 1857 he married Hannah Toghill (1833&#150;1929); they had eight children, all long-lived.<br>
<br>Initially Fitch became known through his close association with the Hookers but his artistic skill and scientific accuracy enhanced the value of every botanical work he illustrated. He was in great demand for monographs, floras, textbooks, and works for popular science. In 1856 he was invited to work for the Linnean Society, where he was soon joined by his nephew <a name="cosubject_69351"></a><span class="headword">John Nugent Fitch</span>  (1840&#150;1927), <span class="occ">lithographer and printer</span>, whom he had trained in botanical drawing. Their work together for the society, typified by Daniel Oliver's <span class="italic">Botany of the Speke and Grant Expedition</span> (1872&#150;5), and in joint folios such as Robert Warner's <span class="italic">Select Orchidaceous Plants</span> (3 ser., 1862&#150;81) and J. E. Howard's <span class="italic">Quinology of the East Indian Plantations</span> (1869&#150;76) resulted in hundreds of superb botanical lithographs. Fitch was made a fellow of the society in 1857, and his nephew in 1877.<br>
<br>In 1859 Fitch travelled to Madrid's Royal Museum to revive and draw eighty-year-old dried plants for Howard's folio <span class="italic">Illustrations of Nueva Quinologia of Pavon</span> (1859&#150;62). This boosted his reputation and he became completely freelance in 1860, but he continued to work for <span class="italic">Curtis's Botanical Magazine</span> until he resigned in 1878 (John Fitch lithographed the magazine until 1920). Aged sixty-two, Fitch began to work on W. B. Hemsley's <span class="italic">Biologia Centrali-Americana</span> (1879&#150;88).<br>
<br>Fitch's freest chalk lithographs were made for H. J. Elwes's <span class="italic">Monograph of the Genus Lilium</span> (1877&#150;80). &#145;The lilies he drew &hellip; in a standing position direct on the stone, which was poised at a slight angle, the bold freehand lines were laid on with an unerring sweep of the pencil&#146;  (Hemsley, <span class="italic">Bulletin</span>). Fitch's work was more flamboyant than that of such predecessors as Ehret, Redout&eacute;, or the Bauer brothers, combining botanical accuracy with a flair for page design. In Britain and Europe he had little competition, being rivalled only by the Frenchman Alfred Riocreux (1820&#150;1912), whose lithographs were wisely uncoloured&#151;a simple colour-guide was all that was required by botanists. In some of Fitch's work, a generalized, uniform colouring unfortunately spoiled the perspective of his drawings. (In fact, his better landscapes confirm his abilities as a painter.)<br>
<br>Fitch's finished drawings were often developed from various starting points: he worked directly from observation, making his own dissections and analyses, from the rough fieldwork of botanists, from written or verbal descriptions, or from his own strong visual memory. He wrote, in a series of articles on botanical drawing for the <span class="italic">Gardeners' Chronicle</span> (1869), that &#145;Sketching living plants is merely a species of copying, but dried specimens test the artist's ability to the uttermost and by drawings made from them would I be judged a correct draughtsman&#146;  (<span class="italic">Gardeners' Chronicle</span>, 1869, 499). He was awarded a civil-list pension of &pound;100 per annum in 1880 for his services to botanical science.<br>
<br>Fitch was tall and of slim build. As a young man he was an easy-going, somewhat bohemian character, disliking the more formal side of Victorian society in common with his artist friend Marianne North (1830&#150;1890). A sense of humour is revealed in his light-hearted botanical writings in the <span class="italic">Gardeners' Chronicle</span> (1865&#150;1879) and in some non-botanical work (W. D. Hooker, <span class="italic">Notes on Norway</span>, 1837 and 1839). He continued to paint landscape throughout his life and played the violin and flute by ear, yet botany had become so much his way of living that he even relaxed by botanizing on rambles with family and friends. In later life he suffered ill health and became bitter, convinced that he had given his all to botany and the Hookers for a pittance and was now unappreciated. Yet at the time of his death, his international reputation was high.<br>
<br>Fitch provided important records of an immense number of plants new to botany. He was persuaded by the Hookers to donate nearly 3000 watercolour sketches to the Kew herbarium and library. These, together with thousands of published lithographs, remain his lasting contribution to botanical science and art. His name is commemorated in the genus <i>Fitchia</i>. He died of apoplexy on 14 January 1892 at his home, Llewellyn House, Kew Green, and was buried on 20 January in Richmond cemetery, Surrey.<br>
