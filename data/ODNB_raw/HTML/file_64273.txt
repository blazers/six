<span class="headword">Morris <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Burden]</span>,  Jane</span>  (1839&#150;1914), <span class="occ">embroiderer and artist's model</span>, was born in Oxford on 19 October 1839, the daughter of Robert Burden (<i>d</i>. 1865), a stablehand in Oxford, and his wife, Ann Maizey (<i>d</i>. 1871). Little is known of her childhood, but it was clearly one of poverty and deprivation.<br>
<br>In October 1857 Jane Burden and her sister, Elizabeth, were seen by <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/24140/', "Dante Gabriel Rossetti (1828&#150;1882)")</script> and Edward Burne-Jones at a performance of the Drury Lane Theatre Company in Oxford. The two men were painting murals based on Arthurian tales for the Oxford Union together with a group of artists who included <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/19322/', "William Morris (1834&#150;1896)")</script>. Struck by Jane's beauty, Rossetti and Burne-Jones sought her to model for them. Jane initially sat mainly to Rossetti, who needed a model for Queen Guinevere for the murals. After this, Jane sat to Morris, who had begun an easel painting, <span class="italic">La belle Iseult</span> (Tate collection). During this period Morris fell in love with Jane and they were engaged. Although the details are not known, it seems clear that Jane was privately educated before her marriage. Her keen intelligence allowed her essentially to re-create herself. She read widely, became proficient in French and later Italian, and was an accomplished pianist. Her manners and speech became refined to such an extent that contemporaries referred to her manner as &#145;regal&#146; or &#145;queenly&#146;. Jane Burden married William Morris on 26 April 1859 at St Michael's Church, Oxford.<br>
<br>The Morrises moved to Red House in Bexleyheath, Kent, in 1860. Their two children, Jenny and May Morris [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37787/', "Morris, Mary")</script>], were born in 1861 and 1862 respectively. Creating furnishings for Red House led to the founding of Morris, Marshall, Faulkner &amp; Co. Morris had begun experimenting with embroidery before he met Jane, and soon after their marriage he began working with her to refine embroidery techniques. They studied old pieces of embroidery and recovered knowledge of some stitches by unpicking these old fragments. Jane was apparently already an accomplished needlewoman, and her embroidery shows remarkable technical skill. For Red House, Jane completed panels with repeating floral designs. A number of these designs were worked on blue wool serge which she found in a London shop. This was significant, as wool became the preferred background for the firm's embroideries. Jane also contributed to a series of panels depicting great women with her sister, also an accomplished embroiderer. During the creation of these panels, Jane later recalled, &#145;we were making experiments in silk and gold wools afterwards to bloom into altar cloths etc.&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 45341). In 1865 the Morrises began living over the firm's premises at Queen Square, Bloomsbury, and Jane was in charge of a group of women who did needlework for the firm, producing a variety of ecclesiastical and domestic embroideries. Jane continued to embroider at least until 1910 for friends and, while her husband was still alive, important clients of the firm. Both William Morris and Philip Webb created designs for Jane's embroidery. She embroidered screens, drapery, and other items. In the late 1880s and early 1890s she exhibited her work at the Arts and Crafts Exhibition Society. One of her most notable embroideries was the coverlet for William Morris's bed which she worked with her friend Mary De Morgan (now at Kelmscott Manor). The design is based on antique flower patterns and is signed &#145;Si je puis Jane Morris&#146;.<br>
<br>In the late 1860s Jane Morris began a romantic liaison with Rossetti which lasted until 1876. This corresponded with a period during which Jane was the model for some of Rossetti's most famous paintings, including <span class="italic">Venus Astarte</span> (Manchester City Galleries), <span class="italic">Proserpine</span> (Tate collection), <span class="italic">La pia de Tolomei</span> (Spencer Art Gallery, University of Kansas), and <span class="italic">The Day Dream</span> (V&amp;A). Her striking appearance provided inspiration to Rossetti for over twenty years. Henry James described her after their first meeting:<blockquote>such a wife! Je n'en reviens pas&#151;she haunts me still &hellip; an apparition of fearful and wonderful intensity &hellip; Imagine a tall lean woman in a long dress of some dead purple stuff &hellip; with a mass of crisp black hair heaped into great wavy projections on each of her temples, a thin pale face, a pair of strange sad, deep dark Swinburnish eyes &hellip; in fine Complete. (Henry James to Alice James, 10 March 1869, <span class="italic">Letters of Henry James</span>, 1, 1974)</blockquote>It is clear from Jane's correspondence with Rossetti that she was a participant in his creative work: she frequently created costumes for his paintings, often of her own design.<br>
<br>In addition to her embroidery, Jane Morris produced a number of books. These are elaborately decorated and bound in vellum, velvet, or leather. They were apparently intended as gifts, and their texts are generally handwritten English and French verse, with illuminated capitals or other decoration. The bookbinder Thomas James Cobden-Sanderson first learned his craft at Jane's suggestion.<br>
<br>Jane Morris was actively involved in many of her husband's endeavours. In addition to her contributions to the firm, which continued until his death, she worked for the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings, the 1882 Icelandic Famine Relief Committee, and later the Kelmscott Press. She did not however share his political views. Despite her husband's commitment to socialism, Jane maintained an allegiance to the Liberal Party, although her sympathies leaned towards the party's radical wing. She also ardently supported Irish home rule, a view which she shared with her close friends Rosalind Howard, countess of Carlisle, and Jane Cobden.<br>
<br>In 1883 Jane Morris met the poet and political activist <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/31938/', "Wilfrid Scawen Blunt (1840&#150;1922)")</script> and by 1887 at the latest the couple had become lovers. Jane designed the cover for Blunt's volume of poetry <span class="italic">In vinculis</span>, published in 1889. It was also probably through Jane that Blunt came to have his poetry published by the Kelmscott Press.<br>
<br>After her husband's death in 1896 Jane Morris worked with Sydney Cockerell in the winding-up of operations of the Kelmscott Press. In 1904 she modelled for the queen in Evelyn De Morgan's painting <span class="italic">The Hour Glass</span> (Evelyn De Morgan Foundation, London). Jane made a substantial contribution to May Morris's edition <span class="italic">The Collected Works of William Morris</span>. She assisted her daughter with dating and identifying manuscripts as well as providing her with material for use in the introductions, including reminiscences of Morris; she also reviewed drafts of all the introductions to the volumes, corrected errors, and offered suggestions for improvements. She died on 26 January 1914 at 5 Brock Street, Bath, and was buried at St George's Church, Kelmscott, Oxfordshire.<br>
