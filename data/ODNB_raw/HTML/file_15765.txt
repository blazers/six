<span class="headword">Knowles, Sir  Charles</span>, first baronet  (<em>d.</em> 1777), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, was reputedly the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15754/', "Charles Knollys, styled fourth earl of Banbury (bap. 1662, d. 1740)")</script>; the identity of his mother, the date of his birth, and details of his upbringing are all unknown. His abilities as an engineer suggest a sound education. He may have served as a volunteer on the <i>Bedford</i> in 1708 and the <i>Valeur</i> in 1711, but the muster book of the latter does not record his presence on the ship. In March 1718 he entered the <i>Buckingham</i> with Captain Charles Strickland, whom he followed to the <i>Lennox</i> in April, with the rating of captain's servant; he continued in the <i>Lennox</i> until December 1720. For much of this time the <i>Lennox</i> was in the Mediterranean under the orders of Sir George Byng, and from Knowles's own papers it appears that in the battle off Cape Passaro in August 1718 he was serving on the <i>Barfleur</i>, Byng's flagship. Between June 1721 and June 1726 he served in the frigate <i>Lyme</i> under Lord Vere Beauclerk, rated first captain's servant and later steward and able seaman. Knowles passed his lieutenant's examination on 30 January 1729 and in the following year he was promoted lieutenant of the <i>Trial</i>. In March 1731 he was moved to the <i>Lion</i>, flagship of Rear-Admiral Charles Stewart in the West Indies.<br>
<br>On 24 November 1731 Knowles was promoted commander of the <i>Southampton</i> (40 guns) serving as a hulk at Port Antonio, Jamaica. There Knowles served as an engineer in the development of the port for use by the Royal Navy. He returned to England in 1735 but it was not until February 1737 that he became captain of the <i>Diamond</i>. In her he went out to the West Indies and in November 1739 joined Vice-Admiral Edward Vernon at Porto Bello where he was ordered to destroy the settlement's forts. In March 1740 Knowles was involved in the attack on the port of Chagres to the west-south-west of Port Bello. On its surrender he was appointed governor of the castle pending the destruction of the defences. In June he returned to England and on arrival was appointed to the <i>Weymouth</i> (60 guns). In October the <i>Weymouth</i> was one of the fleet under Rear-Admiral Sir Chaloner Ogle which escorted the expeditionary army under Major-General Lord Cathcart to the West Indies. Knowles took part in the unsuccessful expedition against Cartagena during March and April 1741, and acted throughout as Vernon's principal surveyor and engineer. He was active in examining the approaches to the several points of attack, cutting the boom across the Boca Chica, taking possession of the Castillo Grande, and destroying the captured works before the fleet left. A pamphlet entitled <span class="italic">An Account of the Expedition to Carthagena</span> (1743), highly critical of the army's conduct in the campaign, is generally attributed to Knowles.<br>
<br>After the failure at Cartagena, Knowles was moved into the <i>Lichfield</i>, and in the course of 1742 into the <i>Suffolk</i> (70 guns). In her he commanded a squadron which was sent to act against the Spanish settlements on the Caracas coast. The Spaniards were prepared for his arrival and when the squadron attacked La Guayra on 18 February 1743 it was beaten off with very heavy losses. After refitting, it attacked Puerto Cabello on 15 and 24 April with no better fortune. On 28 April it was decided that the squadron was no longer able to engage the enemy, and Knowles returned to Jamaica where, between 1743 and 1745, he continued as second in command under Ogle. Towards the end of 1745 he returned to England, and after a short time in the Downs, as second in command under Vice-Admiral William Martin, he was, early in 1746, sent out as governor of Louisbourg, which had been captured from the French a few months before. There he remained for upwards of two years, but he disliked the place and was eager to return to the West Indies. In the large promotion of 15 July 1747 he was made rear-admiral of the white, and at the same time was appointed commander-in-chief at Jamaica.<br>
<br>In February 1748, with his flag in the <i>Cornwall</i>, Knowles took the squadron to the south coast of Cuba. After capturing Port Louis, Hispaniola (St Domingue) on 8 March he arrived off Santiago in April and prepared for an attack. An attack was immediately attempted, but the failure of this assault resulted in a disagreement between Knowles and Captain Dent in the <i>Plymouth</i>, the former commander-in-chief, who led in. Dent was sent home to be tried on, and later cleared of, a charge of not having done his utmost. Meanwhile Knowles, having refitted the ships at Jamaica, took them for a cruise off Havana in hopes of intercepting the Spanish treasure fleet. This occurred on 1 October and heavy fighting ensued between the <i>Cornwall</i>, the <i>Strafford</i> (Captain David Brodie), and the Spanish ships <i>Africa</i> and <i>Conquistador</i>. In writing of the engagement to Lord Anson, Knowles spoke of the &#145;bashfulness&#146; of some of his captains. They in turn accused Knowles of delaying the attack, engaging in a straggling line, and providing a false report to the Admiralty. A court martial on Knowles was accordingly ordered, and sat at Deptford in December 1749. Captain Thomas Innes of the <i>Warwick</i> acted as prosecutor, in the name of the captains. The court decided that Knowles was at fault in taking his fleet into action in such a straggling line, and also in not going on board another ship and leading the chase in person. He was sentenced to be reprimanded. The four captains were themselves then put on their trial: Holmes was honourably acquitted, Charles Powlett and Edmund Toll were reprimanded, and Thomas Innes suspended for three months. Many duels followed. Knowles received four challenges and exchanged shots with Holmes on 24 February. A meeting also took place between Innes and Edward Clarke, the principal witness against him, and Innes was mortally wounded. Several more duels were forbidden by the king, who ordered the challengers into custody.<br>
<br>On 28 November 1749 Knowles was elected MP for Gatton in Surrey. His interest in this pocket borough of about twenty-two electors is not clear, but his objective was almost certainly to further his career, and in 1752 he gave it up on being appointed governor of Jamaica. He offended the residents by insisting on the supreme jurisdiction of the English parliament, and by moving the seat of government to Kingston, thus causing a depreciation of property in Spanish Town. A petition for his removal, signed by nineteen members of the assembly, was presented to the king, and charges of &#145;illegal, cruel, and arbitrary acts&#146; were laid before the House of Commons. After examination by a committee of the whole house, the assembly's action was condemned as &#145;derogatory to the rights of the crown and people of Great Britain&#146;, and Knowles's conduct, by implication, fully justified. But Knowles had already returned to England and resigned the governorship in 1756.<br>
<br>On 4 February 1755 Knowles had been promoted vice-admiral, and in 1757, with his flag in the <i>Neptune</i>, he was second in command under Sir Edward Hawke in the abortive expedition against Rochefort. Knowles was among those reproached for this failure and responded with a pamphlet, <span class="italic">The Conduct of Admiral Knowles on the Late Expedition Set in a True Light</span> (1758). This met with scant favour, and a notice of it in the <span class="italic">Critical Review</span> (1758, 5.438) was so extreme that the editor, Tobias Smollett, was tried for libel and sentenced to a &pound;100 fine and three months' imprisonment. Nevertheless Knowles's share in the miscarriage offended the government. He was superseded in his command and, though he retained his flag in the <i>Royal Anne</i>, guardship at Portsmouth, he had no further active service in the English navy.<br>
<br>On 3 December 1760 Knowles was promoted to the rank of admiral of the white. In October 1765 he was created a baronet, and on 5 November 1765 nominated rear-admiral of Great Britain. In October 1770 he accepted an appointment as chief of the surveying branch in the Russian navy and reluctantly resigned as rear-admiral. Knowles carried out surveys of the Baltic yards and ships and made a series of suggestions for administrative and technical improvements, based largely on the British model. He returned to England on the conclusion of peace between Russia and Turkey (1774) and in the following year he published a translation of M. de la Croix's <span class="italic">Abstract on the Mechanism of the Motions of Floating Bodies</span>. In the preface he claimed to have verified the author's principles by a number of experiments, and to have found them effective in several line-of-battle ships and frigates that he built while in Russia. Knowles was married twice: first in 1740 to Mary Alleyne (<i>d</i>. 1742); they had one son, Edward, who was killed in command of the <i>Peregrine</i> (1762). In July 1750 he married Maria-Magdalena Theresa, daughter of the comte de Bouget; they had one daughter and a son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15766/', "Charles Henry Knowles")</script>, also a naval officer. Knowles died at his home in Bulstrode Street, St Marylebone, Middlesex, on 9 December 1777, reportedly after having suffered a paralytic stroke brought on by bathing in the sea at Weymouth. He was buried next to his first wife in St Nicholas's Church, Guildford.<br>
