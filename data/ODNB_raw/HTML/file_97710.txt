<span class="headword">Berman,  Nestor Montague <span class="st"> [Monty]</span></span>  (1913&#150;2006), <span class="occ">film and television producer</span>, was born on 16 August 1913 at 25 Whitechapel Road, London, the son of Israel (otherwise Isadore) Reuben Berman, musician, and his wife, Fanny, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Josephvitz. He was of Jewish descent. He was educated at University College School, Hampstead, and entered the film industry in 1930 as a camera assistant at Twickenham Studios. He then worked as a camera operator at Teddington Studios (1934&#150;8), where he filmed Michael Powell's <span class="italic">The Edge of the World</span> (1937), and at Ealing Studios (1938&#150;40). On 11 November 1940, at Hendon register office, he married Ella Barbara Joan Humphrey, an eighteen-year-old hairdresser, and daughter of Stanley Frederick Humphrey, commercial traveller.<br>
<br>During the Second World War Berman served in the army, attaining the rank of sergeant, and was transferred to the Eighth Army kinematograph unit in north Africa, where he met Robert S. Baker; they worked on the documentary <span class="italic">The Way from Germany</span> (1946). After demobilization Berman continued as a camera operator on several films before forming a production company, Tempean Films, with Baker. They made two low-budget comedies, <span class="italic">A Date with a Dream</span> (1948), financed by friends and relatives, and <span class="italic">Melody Club</span> (1949), both starring Terry-Thomas, before becoming firmly established as second feature producers. They were a complementary team: Berman looked after the finances and cinematography, while Baker focused on script development and direction. Their reputation as efficient and capable producers came through a very tight control of budgets, scripting, casting, and direction, using a limited number of actors and directors (principally John Gilling). To reduce costs they often filmed on location, which allowed Berman more scope as the cinematographer and gave Tempean films a distinctive look in what was a largely undifferentiated market.<br>
<br>Tempean's output of over thirty, mainly crime, films changed from the staunchly British early ones&#151;including <span class="italic">The Frightened Man</span> (1952)&#151;to faster paced American thrillers using second-drawer American stars and designed for the American market. Many, including <span class="italic">Impulse</span> (1954), starring Arthur Kennedy and directed by the blacklisted Cy Endfield, were indebted to <i>film noir</i>. Under a separate banner, CIPA, Baker and Berman produced three films in Ireland, before graduating into first features, beginning with <span class="italic">Sea of Sand</span> (1958), a gripping war film set in the north African desert. Berman directed as well as produced <span class="italic">The Siege of Sidney Street</span> (1960), based on the events of 1911, and the luridly melodramatic <span class="italic">The Hellfire Club</span> (1961), shot in colour. His first marriage having ended in divorce, on 2 November 1956 Berman married Ursula Anne Sharp (<i>b</i>. 1934), actress, and daughter of Percy William Sharp, colliery agent; they had one daughter.<br>
<br>The strict discipline of low-budget film-making was the foundation of Berman's and Baker's success after they moved into television production, working for Lew Grade's Independent Television Corporation, having secured the rights to Leslie Charteris's gentleman outlaw, the Saint. Roger Moore proved to be perfect casting as Simon Templar, and <span class="italic">The Saint</span> (1962&#150;9) was a major international success, changing to colour halfway through. By contrast <span class="italic">Gideon's Way</span> (1964), based on the novels by J. J. Marric (John Creasey), was a sober, realistic police procedural starring John Gregson as Commander George Gideon of Scotland Yard, making expert use of London locations. <span class="italic">The Baron</span> (1966) blended the two, with the American Steve Forrest playing a London antiques dealer who is also a secret agent.<br>
<br>Having broken with Baker, Berman set up Scoton Productions with the scriptwriter Dennis Spooner, who had written over half the episodes of <span class="italic">The Baron</span>. With Berman as producer and occasional writer, Spooner as script supervisor, and a stable team of writers and directors, Scoton produced five further series, beginning with <span class="italic">The Champions</span> (1968&#150;9), a conflation of the spy thriller and superhero adventure story. <span class="italic">Department S</span> (1969&#150;70), in which the three protagonists solve cases that have baffled conventional law agencies, was more popular, especially the foppish character of Jason King (Peter Wyngarde), the professional crime writer turned amateur detective. In <span class="italic">Jason King</span> (1971&#150;2) Wyngarde's hair, clothing, and mannerisms became more extravagantly camp. In between Berman and Spooner produced <span class="italic">Randall and Hopkirk (Deceased)</span> (1969&#150;70), a combination of supernatural fantasy and hard-boiled thriller about two slightly seedy London-based private detectives, Jeff Randall (Mike Pratt) and Marty Hopkirk (Kenneth Cope), the latter dead but returning to give his partner a helping hand. Scoton's final series, <span class="italic">The Adventurer</span> (1972&#150;3), starring Gene Barry as a wealthy government agent posing as a film star to travel the world, was stale and lacklustre.<br>
<br>A talented cinematographer, Berman prided himself on his efficiency, &#145;orderliness&#146;, and quality control, and he had a reputation of being ruthless. These qualities enabled him to prosper in an intensely competitive market. However, his best-remembered films and television series also showed a degree of imagination and inventiveness that testified to his creativity as well as his business acumen. He retired after <span class="italic">The Adventurer</span>, but lived to see several of his television series becoming cult hits and remade. He died on 14 June 2006 at the Chelsea and Westminster Hospital of bronchopneumonia and severe aortic stenosis. He was survived by his wife, Ursula, and daughter, Charlotte.<br>
