<span class="headword">Boheme <span class="st"> [Bohemus]</span>,  Mauritius</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1646&#150;1662), <span class="occ">clergyman and ejected minister</span>, was born at Kolberg, Pomerania. In a rare reference to Boheme's early life, Simon Ford, minister at Reading, states that &#145;being a pilgrim in this land, [he hath] by the gracious providence of God been transplanted from his native soil, to labour in Christ's vineyard within this nation&#146;, which may encourage the speculation that the family's drastic move was occasioned by zeal or persecution  (Bohemus, preface). Certainly Mauritius was the nephew of Johannes Bergius (1587&#150;1658), chaplain to the elector of Brandenburg, but as to the date of his arrival in England it is known only that his parents emigrated some time after the birth in 1628 of Mauritius's younger brother, George (<i>d</i>. 1711), later vicar of New Sleaford, Lincolnshire, who after the Restoration was a schoolmaster at Walcot, Lincolnshire.<br>
<br>Boheme became rector of Hallaton, Leicestershire, some time between the death of a previous incumbent, Edward Shield, who was buried on 16 February 1644, and an incident during the last days of the civil war. On 5 April 1646, the county committee was informed, a band of troopers, having deserted the Leicester garrison in search of plunder, arrived in Medbourne and attacked some of its inhabitants. They then plundered the vicarage, where the minister, Mr Doughty, was entertaining Mr Bohemus, minister of neighbouring Hallaton, and both men were fortunate to escape through a side door.<br>
<br>It seems likely that at first Boheme's legal status in the parish was insecure or uncertain; John Walker records that his successor had been sequestered, and Boheme compounded for the south portion of the rectory on 3 September 1651. Boheme was married at least three times, first to Jane, who was buried at Hallaton on 14 December 1647. His second wife, Eizabeth, gave birth to a daughter, Ann, baptized on 12 March 1652, but also died at an early age and was buried on 10 July 1654. On 27 February 1656 Boheme married Hannah Vowe, who gave birth to a son, Samuel, on 15 December 1656.<br>
<br>Mauritius Boheme served as assistant to the Leicestershire and Rutland commission for approving parish ministers in 1654. In that year, he issued <span class="italic">A Christian's Delight, or, Morning Meditations</span>, with a Latin epistle, dedicating the work to Sir Arthur Heselrige. Evidently the godly ministers of London were anxious to encourage him, for as a second preface by Thomas Jacombe, minister of St Martin Ludgate, reports, several of his brethren in the city, having read the manuscript, &#145;do unanimously judge this treatise to be sound, wholesome, savouring a spirit of piety&#146;. The following year Boheme issued a translation, dedicated to Cromwell, of an eirenic work by his uncle, Bergius, under the title <span class="italic">A Pearle of Peace and Concorde</span>. Walker reports that Boheme was ejected by act of parliament in 1660, and it appears that his successor was instituted to the rectory on 10 October in that year. The Leicestershire antiquary John Nichols, however, asserts that a loose parchment in the parish register maintains that Boheme was ousted from Hallaton only in 1662. All authorities are agreed that not long after his ejection Boheme returned to Germany, but nothing is known of his further activities.<br>
