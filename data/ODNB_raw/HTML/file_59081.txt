<span class="headword">Carmichael,  Amy Beatrice</span>  (1867&#150;1951), <span class="occ">missionary</span>, was born on 16 December 1867 in Millisle, co. Down, Ireland, the daughter of prosperous middle-class Presbyterian parents, David Carmichael (<i>d</i>. 1885), flour miller, and his wife, Catherine Jane Filson (<i>d</i>. 1913). She received her education from a succession of governesses, Marlborough House, Harrogate&#151;a Wesleyan Methodist boarding-school in Yorkshire&#151;and at Victoria College, Belfast. However, a financial crisis in the family business and the death of her father in April 1885 put an end to her academic prospects.<br>
<br>Religion played an important part in the Carmichael family household, and from an early age Amy became involved in both spiritual and practical work in Belfast, holding prayer and <span class="roman">Bible</span> meetings for neighbourhood children and schoolfriends. She organized classes for the mill girls of Belfast which were so successful that a new hall was built to accommodate them. The Welcome, as it became known, was a lively and innovative centre of evangelistic endeavour. In 1889 both she and her mother were invited to Manchester to work for the city mission there, but ill health brought Amy's part in this endeavour to a speedy conclusion. At this stage Robert Wilson, a Quaker and co-founder of the Keswick Convention, became a major influence in her life. It was while staying at his home in Cumberland, deeply engaged with the religious work of her host, that Amy received the &#145;call&#146; to missionary work.<br>
<br>Carmichael arrived in south India in 1895, via Japan and Ceylon, sustained always by the certainty of a divine purpose guiding her life, and, like so many evangelists of the period, believed that her religious mission transcended denominational labels. At first attached to the Church of England zenana mission, she later joined forces with a Church Missionary Society missionary, and, forming her own band of sisters, spent a total of seven years itinerating in the Tinnevelly district, before settling in Dohnavur, Tinnevelly district, south India, which was to be her home until the end of her life.<br>
<br>A central concern of the Christian community which Carmichael established there was the fate of young girls (<i>devadasis</i>), ceremonially married to the deity in the temple, an ancient ritual which seems to have degenerated into prostitution. These girls and, from 1918, boys, who were vulnerable to exploitation, were a central focus of her mission which provided such children with a Christian home, and education and training which would equip them for adult life. The settlement gradually expanded, with outposts in the village, nurseries, schools, a hospital, and a house of prayer added as needed; within forty years the community at Dohnavur numbered more than 600. Despite growing numbers, however, the pattern of life was that of a family, not an institution, with the evangelists sharing in the practical work of teaching, doctoring, nursing, engineering, and farming. Financially too, the institutional approach was rejected; no fund-raising appeals were launched or authorized, instead &#145;Indian and European, men and women, live and work together &hellip; each contributing what each has for the help of all&#146;  (Carmichael, <span class="italic">Gold by Moonlight</span>, 183).<br>
<br>Amy was a prolific writer, particularly after a fall in 1931 which severely restricted her movement. She published thirty-eight books in the course of her life, mostly on the work at Dohnavur. Her books, frequently reprinted and translated into many languages, were important, not only in spreading the word about the work at Dohnavur, but in inspiring and influencing later generations of young Christians. Passionately committed, and unconventional by any standards, the intensity of her faith and her frankness about the difficulties of missionary work in India often attracted the hostility of other Europeans, as did her behaviour. She adopted Indian dress, for example, and insisted that those who worked at Dohnavur would do so without expectation of a salary since no appeals for money were ever made, except through prayer. Knowledge of her work was spreading, however, and others were more appreciative of the Dohnavur initiative. In 1919 she was awarded the kaisar-i-Hind medal for services to the people of India. A greater cause for celebration was the passing of the 1947 act of the Madras state parliament which made it illegal to dedicate young girls to temple service&#151;a cause given wide publicity by Amy's intervention and in works such as <span class="italic">Lotus Buds</span> (1909) and <span class="italic">Things as They Are</span> (1903).<br>
<br>In 1927 the Dohnavur Fellowship was legally established as an independent body, thus ending the loose association with the Church of England zenana mission, already diluted as workers joined from a variety of countries and backgrounds. The ethos of Amy Carmichael's mission was by then quite unique. The celebration of &#145;coming days&#146; (when a new child arrived at the community), the &#145;meetings of vision&#146; between Christmas and the new year, and the triumphant funeral processions clearly bear the imprint of its founder, in particular her close knowledge of the local way of life and her love of nature. An abundance of flowers, the study of birds and insects, and a great deal of singing seem to have been the hallmarks of a community deeply concerned with the happiness and well-being of children, although the founder herself always maintained a strict discipline. Perhaps the greatest testimony to her leadership, however, is the fact that the community survived both the ending of British rule in India and her own death in 1951. Continuity was ensured by adapting both the ethos and the work of Dohnavur to the India of the late twentieth century, and although the fellowship members are now all of Indian nationality, the work still continues today. Amy Carmichael died at Dohnavur on 18 January 1951, and was buried there the same day.<br>
