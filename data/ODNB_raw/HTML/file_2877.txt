<span class="headword">Booth,  George</span>, first Baron Delamer <span class="st"> [Delamere]</span>  (1622&#150;1684), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born on 18 December 1622, the second son of William Booth (<i>d</i>. 1636), and his wife, Vere (<i>d</i>. 1629), third daughter and coheir of Sir Thomas Egerton, son of Viscount Brackley, lord chancellor of England. He was descended from a younger branch of the Booths of Barton, Lancashire, which since 1433 had been settled at Dunham Massey, Cheshire. When his father died in 1636 Booth became the ward of his grandfather Sir George Booth, first baronet. He was educated at the Inner Temple in 1637. Booth is said to have quarrelled with his guardian late in 1639 or early in 1640, and to have fled to France. The quarrel had something to do with Booth's marriage on 30 November 1639 to Lady Katherine (<i>d</i>. 1643), daughter of Theophilus Clinton, fourth earl of Lincoln&#151;a union which produced a daughter.<br>
<br>By the outbreak of the civil war Booth had returned to England and followed his grandfather in being one of the chief supporters of the parliamentary party in Cheshire. Thereafter, they were also in the van of the opposition to the putative parliamentarian leader in the county, Sir William Brereton. The Booths were &#145;more moderate religiously and politically&#146; than Brereton  (Dore, 14). Booth's wife, Lady Katherine, was buried at Bowdon, Chester, on 5 August 1643 and, by a licence of 14 December 1644, Booth cemented his position within the parliamentarian &eacute;lite by marrying Lady Elizabeth (1621/2&#150;1691), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/11537/', "Henry Grey, first earl of Stamford")</script>. They had seven sons, two of whom died before Booth, and five daughters. Early in 1645 Booth was in London spreading anti-Brereton propaganda, and attempting to promote a petition against him in parliament in April. By the autumn of that year he was back in Cheshire taking a leading part in the siege of Chester. In 1646 he resigned his commission as a colonel in the Cheshire forces and was recruited to the county's vacant parliamentary seat, thanks largely to canvassing on his behalf by his grandfather, and probably in an attempt to counter Brereton's influence at Westminster. It was certainly suspected that Brereton, if he could, would obstruct Booth's election.<br>
<br>Booth was secluded at the purge in December 1648, his way into the Commons chamber barred on the 7th by soldiers under the direct instruction of his brother-in-law <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/11563/', "Thomas Grey, Lord Grey of Groby")</script>. Booth signed a protest got up by several of his fellow sufferers that day, explaining to his Cheshire constituents that he and they had been kept out of the Commons because they had &#145;stickled for the privilege of Parliament, and restoration of their members, then in hold, the day before&#146;  (Underdown, 152). On his grandfather's death on 24 October 1652, Booth succeeded to the baronetcy. He sat for Cheshire in the first Cromwellian parliament in 1654, and was appointed to head the new militia commission in Cheshire established in the aftermath of John Penruddock's royalist revolt, and in anticipation of the settlement of the major-generals. However, suspicions arose that he had actually been intended as the commander of an insurrection in Cheshire and north Wales in 1655, and in 1656 he was excluded from taking his seat at Westminster in the second protectorate parliament.<br>
<br>In September 1658 General George Monck recommended to the new protector, Richard Cromwell, that he trust in Sir George Booth and men like him, in order to reassure and encourage the conservative gentry that the objective of &#145;healing and settling&#146; the nation was still a priority, and that religious zealots would receive short shrift. Booth was subsequently returned to sit for Lancashire in the parliament which met in 1659 (having succeeded as lord of the manor of Warrington at the death of his father in 1636). On account of his grandfather's memory, Booth was, according to Clarendon, &#145;of absolute power with the presbyterians&#146;  (Helms, Hampson, and Henning). When the rump of the Long Parliament was restored later in 1659 Booth was chosen one of the committee of fourteen who were appointed by the members secluded in 1648 to attempt to obtain readmittance. After their repulse he joined the plot for an armed insurrection, receiving a commission from Charles II to command in Lancashire, Cheshire, and north Wales. The acquisition of arms and ammunition was conducted under cover of supposed fears of some kind of popular uprising, the possibility of which may have been lent some substance by John Bradshaw's victory at the polls in Cheshire in 1658 with the tumultuous support of freeholders and Quakers, a victory which repudiated utterly the social and electoral dominance of traditional &eacute;lites in the region. However, the plot of 1659 failed at least partly because moderates were fearful of &#145;his Majesty's restoration by tumult&#146;, in the earl of Manchester's words  (Underdown, 351).<br>
<br>Booth was the only would-be insurgent who enjoyed any success. On 5 August 1659, totally ignorant of how matters had gone in other parts of the country, Booth, along with the earl of Derby, Colonel Egerton, and others, at the head of four thousand men, seized the city of Chester, where they were shortly joined by Sir Thomas Middleton from Wales. A proclamation was issued from which the name of the king was omitted, but asserting &#145;the freedom of parliament, of the known laws, liberty and property, and of the good people of this kingdom, groaning under uncomfortable taxes&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>). Leaving a sufficient force to besiege Chester Castle, which held out against them, Booth and Middleton split up, the latter heading for south Wales, while Booth marched towards York. <i>En route</i> he learned of the disaster which had befallen the planned general rising, and that Major-General John Lambert was marching for Cheshire to extinguish the solitary spark of revolt. The two forces clashed at Northwich on 19 August. The skirmish was not bloody, but it was wholly decisive. Booth fled, and at some point on his way to London, whence he hoped to take ship for the continent, he put on female clothing. The disguise was penetrated at Newport Pagnell on 24 August, whereupon Booth was apprehended and conveyed to the Tower. He was interrogated by Sir Arthur Hesilrige and Sir Henry Vane the younger, then was retained to be dealt with by the council of state. He was set at liberty on bail of &pound;5000 shortly after the readmission to the Commons of the secluded members in February 1660. In March he was restored to the Cheshire militia commission.<br>
<br>That spring Booth was elected, probably unopposed, to represent the same county in the Convention Parliament. He was the first of the twelve members chosen on 7 May 1660 to convey to Charles II the reply of the Commons to the declaration of Breda. Marked as a friend on Lord Wharton's list he was teller for the majority which voted that no more than twenty offenders should be excepted from the <span class="roman">Bill for Indemnity and Oblivion</span>. He opposed excepting Bulstrode Whitelocke from the provisions of the <span class="roman">Indemnity Bill</span>, personally submitted Oliver St John's plea for mercy, and spoke in favour of Sir Arthur Hesilrige and even his old foe, John Lambert. He also brought in two papers drawn up by his late brother-in-law, Thomas, Lord Grey of Groby, testifying to &#145;his penitence for his former being against the king&#146;  (Helms, Hampson, and Henning), and persuaded the house to remove him from the list of those denied the benefit of the bill, presumably in order to save Groby's estate from forfeiture. On 30 July, &#145;as a mark of respect for his eminent services and great sufferings for the public&#146;  (ibid.), the Convention granted Booth &pound;10,000 out of excise revenues, which he offered to forgo in return for passage of a bill he had introduced that day permitting him to lease and sell lands in order that he might clear debts and provide portions for his younger children. The house evidently declined, the Lords' concurrence to the proposed gift was obtained, and order given to the excise commissioners that they make payment accordingly. In the second session of the Convention, Booth told for the minority who supported giving a second reading to the bill for establishment of a modified episcopacy.<br>
<br>On 20 April 1661 Booth was raised to the peerage as Lord Delamer, one of six barons created at the coronation of Charles II. He was apparently also granted the liberty of nominating six gentlemen for knighthoods, and he was made <i>custos rotulorum</i> of Cheshire. Reward for his services in promoting the Stuart restoration could not, however, ensure his loyalty to the new regime. Having supported in 1660 the case for cleansing episcopacy of its Laudian, high-church imperfections, Delamer came increasingly to distrust elements of the Restoration ecclesiastical settlement. In an undated letter to the Anglican Lord Bruce, probably written about the time of the debates on the <span class="roman">Conventicle Bill</span> in 1664, Delamer begged him to be &#145;merciful to us Presbiterians and at least give us leave to play innocently at bowls&#146;  (Swatland, 148). As the reign wore on and the cause of comprehension slowly died he was probably among those presbyterian peers who came to favour toleration. Delamer was also suspicious of the parameters within which the royal prerogative began to reassert itself in the immediate aftermath of Restoration. He appears to have believed that restraint on the import of Irish cattle, contrary to the wishes of the king and the lord lieutenant, was a matter of the utmost importance for &#145;the good of England&#146;  (Seaward, 297), although his economic self-interest was plainly involved at a time of depressed rent receipts and a decline in the profitability of farming.<br>
<br>By the time of Lord Treasurer Danby's ministry in the mid-1670s Delamer was firmly in the country party camp, and in 1677 was sympathetic to the duke of Buckingham's attempt, which was opposed by the court as encroaching on the royal prerogative, to secure the dissolution of the Cavalier Parliament. His opposition to government interests carried over during the exclusion crisis, during which he was one of the adverse or whig party in the Lords. In December 1679 he was one of the sixteen peers who signed and presented a petition to the king urging that he summon parliament to meet the following month, in an attempt to keep the threat of the Popish Plot firmly in the public eye, and hence sustain the pressure for the exclusion of the Catholic duke of York from the succession. He voted for the second <span class="roman">Exclusion Bill</span> in November 1680.<br>
<br>Delamer died at Dunham Massey on 8 August 1684, and was buried on 9 September at Bowdon in Cheshire. Lady Elizabeth survived him&#151;she died on 4 January 1691. Delamer was succeeded by his son <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2880/', "Henry Booth")</script>, the future first earl of Warrington.<br>
