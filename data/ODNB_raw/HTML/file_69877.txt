<span class="headword">Doll <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Rickett]</span>,  Josephine <span class="st"> [Jo; </span></span> <span class="st"> <em>performing name </em>Jo Douglas]</span>  (1926&#150;1988), <span class="occ">actress and television producer</span>, was born at 146 The Green, Earlsheaton, near Huddersfield, on 6 October 1926, the eldest of the three children of Bernard Rickett (1899&#150;1985), a manager for Fyffes banana company, and his wife, Jessie Elizabeth (1902&#150;1986), daughter of Edward Churchill Hampson, an engineer. She attended Longley Hall secondary school until, aged fourteen, she became a shorthand typist and started a local unit of the Women's Junior Air Corps. To help raise funds for it, she wrote and produced a performance of <span class="italic">Hansel and Gretel</span>. At fifteen she won a drama prize and then joined the Huddersfield Thespians, with whom she made her stage d&eacute;but in December 1943, playing Hazel in J. B. Priestley's play <span class="italic">Time and the Conways</span>.<br>
<br>Jo Rickett joined the Women's Auxiliary Air Force (WAAF) as a wireless mechanic in 1944, but also staged and appeared in camp shows so that, in 1947, she won a wartime grant to attend the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA), taking the stage name Jo Douglas when she left in 1949. Alfred Hitchcock saw her rehearsing at the academy and gave her a role in the film <span class="italic">Stage Fright</span> (1950). Her West End stage d&eacute;but took place at the Vaudeville Theatre on 6 December 1949, as Nurse Brent in <span class="italic">Bonaventure</span>. Meanwhile, on 16 July 1949 she had married (Victor) Douglas Ponton (<i>b</i>. 1917), an electrician who owned a shop in Sloane Square, Chelsea; her first son, Peter, was born on 5 September 1950.<br>
<br>In 1951 Jo Douglas both produced and acted in an amateur performance of <span class="italic">The Vigil</span> in St Martin-in-the-Fields Church, Trafalgar Square, where Ponton was in charge of lighting the play; she had to rush from this to appear in a revue called <span class="italic">See You Again</span> at the Watergate Theatre. During 1952 she acted in three films, first donning her WAAF uniform once more to appear alongside Jack Hawkins in <span class="italic">Angels One Five</span>, then doubling for Clark Gable's leading lady, Gene Tierney, in <span class="italic">Never Let Me Go</span>&#151;during the filming of which she met her future husband, (John) Christopher Shaboe Doll (<i>b</i>. 1919), then a camera operator with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer&#151;and finally appearing in <span class="italic">Lady in the Fog</span> (released as <span class="italic">Scotland Yard Inspector</span> in the USA). In 1953 she joined the actors George Cole and Sidney James in the film <span class="italic">Will Any Gentleman</span>; presented the Saturday evening television show <span class="italic">In Town Tonight</span>, in which actors were interviewed about their work; and adapted Alan Paton's novel <span class="italic">Cry the Beloved Country</span> into a play with music, which she produced with Edric Connor in the lead. She divorced Douglas Ponton in January 1954, retaining custody of her son, and married Christopher Doll on 8 May 1954.<br>
<br>In August 1954 Jo Douglas played herself in a television play by a fellow RADA student, Lynne Reid Banks, called <span class="italic">It Never Rains</span>. In that year she also became a regular star on the television panel game <span class="italic">Find the Link</span>, for two years (which led to her appearances in <span class="italic">The Name's the Same</span>), and acted as announcer at the national radio show at Earls Court. During 1955 she appeared as a star on <span class="italic">Tall Story Club</span>, and in April the BBC gave her a trial as a producer&#150;artiste for six months, and she became that programme's producer. In October 1955 she was awarded a two-year contract. She thus became the only woman producer of light entertainment in Europe. As Joy Leman remarked, since &#145;few women were involved in the making of television programmes, either as writers or producers in the 1950s&#146;  (Leman, 108), this was a mould-breaking appointment. In July 1955 Douglas produced the popular <span class="italic">Saturday Night Date</span>, followed by <span class="italic">Tin Pan Alley</span>, with Billy Cotton, in 1956. That year also saw her visiting military bases overseas to record material for the <span class="italic">Forces Requests</span> programme. Meanwhile, in the six months prior to the birth of her second son, Christian, on 10 September 1956, she had appeared monthly on a women's programme, describing how her pregnancy was progressing.<br>
<br>Until 1957 the hour between 6 and 7 p.m.&#151;known as &#145;the toddlers' truce&#146;&#151;was designed to allow parents to put their children to bed free from the distractions of television. But Independent Television, launched in September 1955, was facing financial losses and persuaded the government to remove this ban. It ended on Saturday 16 February, a few minutes after the six o'clock news, with the BBC's <span class="italic">Six-Five Special</span>, which Jo Douglas both co-produced with Jack Good and co-presented with Pete Murray. Just how revolutionary the <span class="italic">Six-Five Special</span> presentation appeared at the time is encapsulated in a comment in the <span class="italic">Birmingham Mail</span> (18 February 1957) that it was &#145;just the kind of thing you might have expected from ITV&#146;. With some pride, the BBC <span class="italic">Handbook</span> of 1959 declared that &#145;while primarily designed for a teen-aged audience [it had become] a national institution equally enjoyed by the parents&#146;. To <span class="italic">Punch</span> magazine it was the teenage audience who were &#145;the real stars of the show&#146;  (3 April 1957). After the end of her contract in October 1957, Jo Douglas stayed on for a short time, but Jack Good had been forced out and Pete Murray soon followed. Jim Dale took over from Murray, but it was never the same. Indeed &#145;No-one else could do what Jack Good and Jo Douglas had done. It had been their baby, and once they were gone the party was over&#146;  (Murray, 124).<br>
<br>Jo Douglas briefly then returned to acting, joining Alastair Sim, Ian Carmichael, and Hatti Jacques in the television play <span class="italic">Left, Right and Centre</span>, with Sidney Gilliat directing, before going over to ITV, the &#145;opposition&#146; as the BBC saw it, where she worked first for Granada Television, producing the news programme <span class="italic">People and Places</span> three nights every week, and then joined Associated Television (ATV), where she was, for a while, the sole female producer. She then switched to drama, administering a much needed transfusion to the long-running <span class="italic">Emergency Ward 10</span> (devised by Tessa Diamond), bringing in actors like James Bolam. As she remarked, &#145;I want more exciting bods in beds&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 13 July 1988), and the twice-weekly soap opera attracted audiences of over 20 million within a year. The <span class="italic">Arthur Haynes Show</span> (1957&#150;68) was another Douglas production for ATV, as was the <span class="italic">Arthur Askey Show</span> in the spring of 1961. During 1961 she returned to presenting, on the fortnightly <span class="italic">Home Shopping</span>. Then, with the series <span class="italic">Love Story</span> (1963&#150;7, 1969, 1972&#150;4), she directed twenty plays by writers as diverse as Doris Lessing, Roman Polanski, and Edna O'Brien. She was also responsible for <span class="italic">Fire Crackers</span>, a 1964 sitcom about work-shy firemen, and, in 1968, <span class="italic">Virgin of the Secret Service</span>, thirteen hour-long episodes devised and written by Ted Willis as tongue-in-cheek spoofs on James Bond.<br>
<br>In the early 1970s Jo Douglas produced a number of films, including Danny La Rue's first film, <span class="italic">Our Miss Fred</span> (also known as <span class="italic">Beyond the Call of Duty</span>; 1972), and <span class="italic">Dracula AD 1972</span>. In 1975, with her husband Christopher directing, she produced <span class="italic">Pilots Royal</span>, a portrait of Prince Charles shown on BBC 2, which reflected her own fascination with flying. (She had gained her pilot's licence in 1967.) In that year she joined Willis Worldwide Productions as an executive producer. Beginning in 1978 she produced thirteen programmes featuring David Kossoff reading <span class="roman">Bible</span> stories on Majorca, where she and her husband maintained a holiday home. She worked on various projects from 1980 to 1983, but in 1984 she had an operation and, on the advice of her brother-in-law, the cancer specialist Sir Richard Doll, underwent radiotherapy and chemotherapy. She retired in 1985 and twice visited her sister Julie in Australia before succumbing to cancer on 12 July 1988 at her home, White Briars, Slinfold, Sussex. She was survived by her husband and two sons.<br>
