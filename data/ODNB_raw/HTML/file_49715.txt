<span class="headword">Crisp, Sir  Frank</span>, first baronet  (1843&#150;1919), <span class="occ">lawyer and microscopist</span>, was born in London on 25 October 1843, the only child of John Shalders Crisp (1811&#150;1896), a printer, and his first wife, Harriet (<i>d</i>. 1846), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5302/', "John Filby Childs")</script>, the Congregationalist campaigner against church rates and owner of the printing business for whom her husband worked. His mother died when he was not yet three and he was brought up by his grandfather. He was educated at private schools, then at University College School. Shortly before leaving school he decided to take up law and, having been introduced to John Morris by his uncle, he was articled to the firm of Ashurst and Morris at the age of sixteen. Besides his duties with the firm, Crisp studied privately for the London University examinations; he matriculated in 1862, graduated BA in 1864 and LLB in 1865, and found time to take holidays in Switzerland. On 27 August 1867 he married Catherine (1845/6&#150;1931), daughter of George Durrant Howes of St Mary Bungay, Suffolk; they had four sons and two daughters.<br>
<br>Crisp was admitted as a solicitor in 1869, with honours. As his legal reputation grew, he was brought into partnership in 1871, and in 1877 the name of the firm became Ashurst, Morris, Crisp &amp; Co. His interest lay in company law, and he acted for such important clients as foreign railway companies and the Imperial Japanese Navy (in the purchase of its first British-built battleship). He wrote the contract for the expert who was to cleave the Cullinan diamond. He sat on two commissions for the revision of company law, and for his part in connection with the <span class="roman">Companies (Consolidation) Act</span> of 1906 he was knighted on 7 November 1907. Crisp was legal adviser to the Liberal Party and for this service he received a baronetcy on 5 February 1913.<br>
<br>Besides his town house in Lansdowne Road, Holland Park, Crisp acquired in 1895 the house and gardens of Friar Park, Henley-on-Thames. He was lavish in his hospitality, entertaining King Edward VII and Queen Alexandra, King George V, and other royalty during Henley week. Crisp's passion for landscape gardening preceded his purchase of Friar Park; he was a member of the Linnean Society from 1870 and in 1904 his wife was among the first women to be elected fellow. He served as vice-president and was treasurer from 1881 to 1905. Over the years he was a generous benefactor, meeting various costs including that of the installation of electric light at the society's rooms in Burlington House and endowing awards for research. His garden was divided into the usual specialist areas, but the alpine garden was further embellished with a 20 foot high model of the Matterhorn, to scale, capped by a piece of rock from the original, and there were three highly decorated underground caverns. The public were admitted during the summer, with proceeds from ticket and guide sales going to charity. His weekend hobby was to gather material for a book on medieval gardening, which was seen through the press by his daughter after his death. In 1919 he received the Royal Horticultural Society's Victoria medal of honour, its highest award.<br>
<br>In parallel with his horticultural activities, Crisp joined the Royal Microscopical Society in 1870, was elected to its council in 1874, and was appointed one of its secretaries in 1878, holding that office until he took up the treasurership in 1890 before serving as vice-president between 1893 and 1897. From 1879 he laboured to expand and improve the society's journal, organized a supply of specimens for the meetings, and over the years donated more than one hundred books and various items of furniture. Aware that English scientists were failing to advance their understanding of the theoretical principles involved in microscopy and also the systematic investigation of microscopic phenomena, he set about translating the revised edition (1877) of the three-volume standard German text, <span class="italic">Das Mikroskop</span>, by C. N&auml;geli and S. Schwendener. A fire at the printers destroyed all but the first 374 pages and a few of the numerous woodcuts, but as Crisp was by this time occupied elsewhere, this partial account was issued in 1887 as <span class="italic">The Microscope in Theory and Practice</span>, with a second edition in 1892.<br>
<br>By 1890 Crisp had acquired a notable collection of microscopes and related material. But although he wrote description sheets for many of these, and had numerous engravings made, no complete list exists of instruments which passed through his hands. At his death Stevens auction house disposed of his holdings in five sales, but no proper catalogue was made for that event. It seems that between his death and the sales many instruments and their parts had become separated or were wrongly combined, and that the instruments were not accompanied by their descriptions. Crisp attended to his law work until a few days before his death, at Friar Park on 29 April 1919. He was buried at Henley parish church. His eldest son, Frank Morris Crisp (1872&#150;1938), succeeded as second baronet.<br>
