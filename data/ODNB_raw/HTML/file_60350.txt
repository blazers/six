<span class="headword">Marshall,  David Saul</span>  (1908&#150;1995), <span class="occ">chief minister of Singapore</span>, was born David Saul Mashal in Selegie Road, Singapore, on 12 March 1908, the eldest son and second of the seven children of Saul Nassim Mashal, a Sephardi Jewish merchant from Baghdad, and his wife, Flora Ezekiel, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Gahtan. On the advice of a family doctor their family name was Anglicized to Marshall in 1920 following a similar change of name by his uncle and his family in England. At the age of six the young David Mashal had his first taste of wartime internment when he accompanied his mother and brother to Baghdad in 1914 only to find themselves detained by the Turkish authorities for travelling on British passports. After the liberation of Baghdad by British forces in 1917 they returned to Singapore and he was enrolled in the kindergarten of the Convent of the Holy Infant Jesus, before continuing his education at St Joseph's Institution, from which he was expelled after a year for being absent from school on the celebration of Yom Kippur. He fared better at St Andrew's School (1919&#150;21) and the Raffles Institution (1922&#150;4), where his scholastic abilities soon placed him among the top students of his class. As he prepared to sit for a queen's scholarship examination, he worked himself to exhaustion and had to spend some nine months recuperating in a Swiss sanatorium in 1925, where he put the time to good use by learning French, before returning to Singapore in 1926. He took on various jobs&#151;working as a stockbroker, textile representative, salesman, and shipping assistant&#151;to finance his ambition to study in England.<br>
<br>Deterred by the high costs of studying medicine and psychiatry, his first love, Marshall settled for law and arrived in London in 1934 to pursue his legal education, which he completed within eighteen months. He was admitted to the Middle Temple in 1937. After returning to Singapore in the same year he was called to the Singapore bar in February 1938 and joined the firm Aitken and Ong Siang, and later Allen and Gledhill, only to find his legal career disrupted by the invasion and occupation of Singapore by the Japanese during the Second World War. Having joined the Singapore Volunteer Corps before the war, he was interned and dispatched to Japan in 1943 to work in the coal mines of Hokkaido.<br>
<br>After the war Marshall was flown to Manila before being repatriated, at his request, to Perth, Australia, where his father and brothers had taken refuge before the outbreak of hostilities, before returning to Singapore in February 1946. Resuming his practice at Allen and Gledhill, and later at Battenberg and Talma, he soon established himself as a leading criminal defence lawyer (he later claimed to have won acquittals in 99 out of the 100 cases he defended on murder charges) but was also increasingly drawn to the affairs of the Jewish Welfare Board, becoming its first elected president in June 1946, and remaining in that post for the next six years. Through his legal circle of contacts he joined the Singapore Association, an organization representing mainly European commercial interests, and became a member of its committee in June 1947. When politically active leaders of the Singapore Association pushed for the formation of the Singapore Progressive Party in August 1947, Marshall also drifted into politics and formally joined the party in November 1949. Elected to its committee in March 1950, he remained active in the party but grew increasingly restless and impatient with its gradualist programme for constitutional change and resigned in December 1952.<br>
<br>In 1953 the British government convened the Rendel commission to recommend a constitution that would hasten the steps towards self-government for Singapore. Thereafter Marshall began to associate with Lim Yew Hock and Francis Thomas, two former leaders of the Singapore Labour Party, and together they founded the Singapore Socialist Party in April 1954, only to have it merged a few months later with the Singapore Labour Party to become the Labour Front, which Marshall agreed to head. In November 1954 he published an impassioned personal manifesto, <span class="italic">I Believe</span>, calling for immediate self-government as the party prepared for the run-up to the April 1955 elections. A fiery election campaign left Marshall astonished to find his party winning ten of the twenty-five elected seats and himself installed as Singapore's first chief minister, heading a precarious minority government that was soon assailed by a spate of violent strikes and riots among labour unions and Chinese schools. Marshall's unwillingness to suppress anti-colonial dissent contributed to his stormy relations with the colonial authorities, and particularly the governor, Sir John Nicoll. Within four months he precipitated a constitutional crisis over his right to appoint four assistant ministers. The incident paved the way for the first all-party constitutional talks in London, between April and May 1956, but negotiations faltered over issues of internal security. Failing to deliver on his promise of independence for Singapore, a dejected Marshall returned and resigned as chief minister on 7 June 1956. He gave up his parliamentary seat in April 1957 but came back to win a by-election in Anson in July 1961 as a candidate of the Workers' Party, which he had founded in November 1957. He resigned from the party in January 1963, following an internal dispute. After he lost his seat in the September 1963 general election as an independent candidate his political career petered out, and he played no part in the negotiations that led to Singapore's independence in 1965. He returned to his law practice and became a critic of the government's tough criminal policies (which included abolition of trial by jury), but also lauded its economic achievements. Meanwhile, in April 1961 he had married Jean Mary Gray, a lecturer in social work; they had three daughters, Sarah, Ruth, and Joanna, and a son, Jonathan.<br>
<br>In 1978, at the age of seventy, Marshall left his law practice to accept an appointment that led to him serving as Singapore's ambassador to France, Spain, Portugal, and Switzerland for the next fifteen years. When failing health and eyesight forced him to retire in 1993, he resumed work as a consultant in a leading Singapore law firm, Drew and Napier. In 1987 the National University of Singapore awarded him an honorary doctorate of law for his contributions to Singapore and the legal profession. He died at his home in Balmoral Road, Singapore, on 12 December 1995 of lung cancer, and was buried in the Jewish section of Choa Chu Kang cemetery. He was survived by his wife, Jean, and their four children.<br>
