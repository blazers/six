<span class="headword">Lane,  Thomas</span>  (<em>b. </em><em>c.</em>1660, <em>d.</em> in or after 1704), <span class="occ">civil lawyer</span>, was born at Glendon, Northamptonshire, the son of Francis Lane, landowner, of Glendon Hall, and his wife, Mary Bernard. Educated at a school in Higham Ferrers, Northamptonshire, he matriculated from St John's College, Cambridge, in 1673 and graduated BA in 1678. He then moved to Oxford, where he was admitted a commoner of Christ Church, and on 10 October 1678 was incorporated BA. In 1679 he was elected a probationer fellow of Merton College. His election was only one of the continuous subjects of dispute between the warden, Sir Thomas Clayton, and the fellows of Merton, but it was notable for its acrimony and for the warden's decisive defeat. Lane's champion was William Bernard (later DD), vicar of Overton, Wiltshire, and of the Merton living of Malden, Surrey. Bernard was a longstanding opponent of Clayton, and Lane was probably his kinsman.<br>
<br>Lane graduated MA in December 1683, read civil law, and proceeded to the DCL in July 1686. He was admitted to practice in Doctors' Commons later that year and established a strong reputation as an advocate. He was then reputed to have turned papist, and he accompanied Francis Taafe, later earl of Carlingford, on a mission to Vienna, but he was also active in the affairs of his college, where Wood believed that he had sought to build a Northamptonshire faction. Early in 1688, when Lane was serving as bursar, he left Oxford with an account undischarged and a sum of college money in his possession which the sub-warden followed him to retrieve, apparently without rancour or other consequences.<br>
<br>In 1689 Lane took a more dramatic course. In 1685 Merton had celebrated James II's succession with bonfires and toasts in claret, and contributed volunteers to the troop raised in the university to resist Monmouth's rebellion. Now Lane went to Ireland and accepted a command in James II's army there. He was wounded and taken prisoner at the battle of the Boyne, and spent a year in captivity in Dublin. Before the end of 1691, however, he returned to Merton, and soon afterwards was in practice again in the court of arches. Wood observed, with something less than his customary sharpness, that Lane's taste for adventure had been satisfied and that he had come to value the college as a haven. In 1704 Lane was a candidate for the wardenship, which would have been a piquant climax to his career in Merton. There is no later notice of him, and he probably died soon afterwards.<br>
<br>Lane was evidently persuasive, and he had other qualities. His learning was not confined to the civil law. Wood says that he contributed to Moses Pitt's <span class="italic">English Atlas</span> (Oxford, 1680&#150;84), probably collaborating directly with its literary director, William Nicolson, later bishop of Carlisle and of Derry, with whom he shared philological interests. He translated Cornelius Nepos's life of Epaminondas (1684) and took part in a scheme to reorganize the Ashmolean Museum. His enthusiasms seem never to have outrun his energies, nor yet his resourcefulness.<br>
