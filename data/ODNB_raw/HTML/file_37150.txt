<span class="headword">Barclay,  David</span>  (1729&#150;1809), <span class="occ">banker and brewer</span>, was the younger son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37149/', "David Barclay (1682&#150;1769)")</script>, Quaker merchant, and his second wife, Priscilla, daughter of John Freame, banker, of Lombard Street. David and his brother John became partners in their father's linen and merchant house in Cheapside.<br>
<br>Even before the death of his father in 1769, David Barclay had begun a strategic redirection of the family's efforts and resources. Perceiving more clearly than most the dangers inherent in the darkening American situation, the Barclay brothers first gave up their commission merchant business, and then gradually reduced their export trade to North America. By 1783 they had decided to wind up their old linen business. Through his mother, Barclay was to inherit a share in the Freame bank, the oldest surviving Quaker bank in London. In 1776 he became an active partner in this firm, now styled Barclay, Bevan, and Bening, which developed as the Lombard Street node of a network of Quaker country bankers, financing bridges and canals as well as trading enterprises. (After many changes of partners, with the Barclays, Bevans, and Trittons predominating, this firm became the nucleus of the corporate merger of 1896 which became Barclays Bank.) In 1781 Barclay and his nephews, Robert Barclay and Silvanus Bevan, bought the Anchor Brewery in Southwark from Mrs Hester Thrale. This became Barclay, Perkins &amp; Co., one of the three great London breweries of the nineteenth century. The later partnership records of the bank suggest that he became a sleeping partner at some time in the 1780s.<br>
<br>Like his father, David Barclay was a conscientious and active Quaker, and a pacifist. He was a good friend of Benjamin Franklin and tried unsuccessfully in 1774&#150;5 to mediate between Franklin and the government of Lord North to avoid the impending break with the American colonies. His philanthropies were many, and he used his influence to move English Quakers into a stronger stand against slavery&#151;a difficult position for a retired West India merchant, whose bank financed slavers and slave owners, and had the non-Quaker Bevans, with less severe views on such matters, as partners. On a Jamaican cattle ranch acquired in settlement of some debts, he freed the slaves and transported them at his own expense to Philadelphia for resettlement, incurring a &pound;3000 loss.<br>
<br>On 6 May 1749 Barclay married his first wife, Martha, daughter of John Hudson, of Thames Street, London, hop merchant. They had an only child, Agatha, who married (3 August 1773) Richard Gurney, a Quaker banker of Norwich. She was the mother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/11765/', "Hudson Gurney")</script>, David Barclay's principal heir. In 1767 Barclay married his second wife, Rachel, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37682/', "Sampson Lloyd (1699&#150;1779)")</script>, banker. In his will Barclay remembered numerous nephews and cousins, some of whose descendants were active in his bank and brewery until well into the twentieth century. He died at Walthamstow, Essex, on 30 May 1809.<br>
