<span class="headword">Reid,  John</span> <span class="st"> [<em>pseud. </em>David Toulmin]</span>  (1913&#150;1998), <span class="occ">author</span>, was born on 1 July 1913 at Strathellie Cottages, Rathen, near Fraserburgh, Aberdeenshire, the first of the two children of James Gray Reid (<i>d</i>. 1949), farm servant, and his wife, Margaret, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Todd (<i>d</i>. 1969). After a fitful education at a series of schools he reluctantly followed in his father's footsteps and worked for a succession of masters on the land. The tedium of the farming round was relieved from the start by reading and by visits to the cinema, and then by his marriage, on 5 December 1934, to Margaret Jane Willox (<i>b</i>. 1916), followed by the arrival of three sons, Eric, Jack, and Graham. It was not until Reid suffered a serious illness in 1943 that he finally decided that he wanted to become a writer and, while he did not publish until years later he wrote continuously, finding inspiration not only from memory but also from research and excursions. He discovered some old business ledgers in a long-deserted shop, for example, and made good use of them in a masterly re-creation of a First World War airship station and the local inhabitants of Lenabo, now Forest of Deer. He kept diaries, compiled scrapbooks, and wrote obituaries of film stars and other famous people, which he compiled under the title &#145;Close the door softly&#146;. A man of indefatigable curiosity and dogged persistence, he took the long road leading&#151;after many set-backs, including bouts of depression&#151;to ultimate success.<br>
<br>Under his pen name, David Toulmin, John Reid published a novel, stories, and essays centring on rural life in north-east Scotland, especially the Buchan district. After several years of contributions to such journals as the <span class="italic">Farmer and Stockbreeder</span> and the <span class="italic">Buchan Observer</span> his first book, consisting mostly of short stories, <span class="italic">Hard Shining Corn</span>, was published in 1972; it was soon followed by another such collection, <span class="italic">Straw into Gold</span> (1973). After several rejections and rewrites came his only novel, <span class="italic">Blown Seed</span> (1976), which sold about 25,000 copies. <span class="italic">Harvest Home</span>, resuming the pattern of the first two books, followed in 1978; <span class="italic">Travels without a Donkey</span> (1980) was an account of the car journeys taken around Scotland and the north of England by the author and his wife. <span class="italic">A Chiel Among Them</span> (1982) was a mixture of stories and essays, while <span class="italic">The Tillycorthie Story</span> (1986) was a concise account of a local estate; published in the same year, <span class="italic">The Clyack Sheaf</span> was a final collection of stories and essays. Reid looked upon the award of an honorary MLitt from the University of Aberdeen in 1986 as an academic culmination to the high acclaim that he had already received, not only from literary critics such as John R. Allan, Isobel Murray, and Maurice Wiggin but also from other readers in Buchan and further afield. There was one more major publication to come, in 1989: a glossary of the language of north-east Scotland, <span class="italic">Buchan Claik</span>, in collaboration with a Peterhead fisherman, Peter Buchan. <span class="italic">Collected Short Stories</span>, with an introduction by Robert Smith, was published in 1992.<br>
<br>John Reid died suddenly at his home, 49 West Dyke Avenue, Westhill, Skene, Aberdeenshire, on 13 May 1998, about six years after a debilitating stroke; his body was cremated and his ashes interred at Foveran kirkyard, Aberdeenshire. He was survived by his wife. Many of his unpublished diaries are now in the National Library of Scotland.<br>
