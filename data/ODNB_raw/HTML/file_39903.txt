<span class="headword">Coke,  Gerald Edward</span>  (1907&#150;1990), <span class="occ">merchant banker and patron of the arts</span>, was born on 25 October 1907 at Bruton Street, London, the only son and eldest of three children of Sir John Spencer Coke, major in the Scots Guards and royal equerry (seventh son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32484/', "Thomas William Coke, second earl of Leicester")</script>, of Holkham Hall, Norfolk), and his wife, Dorothy Olive, only child of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/34446/', "Sir Harry Lawson Webster Levy-Lawson, Lord Burnham (1862&#150;1933)")</script>. Coke was educated at Eton College and at New College, Oxford, where he obtained a third class in modern history (1929).<br>
<br>During the 1930s Coke worked at Barrow in Furness in a firm connected with haematite iron-ore mining. He served throughout the Second World War in the Scots Guards and attained the rank of lieutenant-colonel. From 1945 to 1975 he was a director of the merchant bank S. G. Warburg &amp; Co., and rose to be vice-chairman. He also served as a director of the Rio Tinto-Zinc Corporation (1947&#150;75), and as chairman (1956&#150;62). His success in these enterprises owed as much to his charm, patent sincerity, and integrity as it did to his commercial acumen. He was a JP from 1952, and deputy lieutenant of Hampshire from 1974. He was appointed CBE in 1967 and became an honorary fellow of the Royal Academy of Music in 1968. The financial success of his work in commerce and banking allowed him to acquire his home, Jenkyn Place, Bentley, Hampshire, which he and his wife transformed into a residence of great beauty and refined taste, filled with libraries, precious porcelain, the great Handel collection, and many <i>objets d'art</i>. Both partners devoted long hours almost daily to the creation of the large and choice gardens surrounding their property, which were intermittently open, chiefly to connoisseurs and garden societies, and formed the subject of television programmes.<br>
<br>Coke's character obliged him to share the fruits of his wealth and accomplishments with many in the fields of music, scholarship, and similar concerns. His influence contributed much to the success of Glyndebourne, run by John Christie and Sir George Christie, of whose arts trust he was chairman (1955&#150;75). He also served as a director of the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden (1958&#150;64), and of the Royal Academy of Music (1957&#150;74). He was a governor of the BBC (1961&#150;6). Particularly close to his heart was his long association, as treasurer and benefactor, with Bridewell Royal Hospital, and King Edward's School, Witley, where there is a portrait of him by Sir William Coldstream. When Coke took over as treasurer, King Edward's School was a relatively small boys' school, which he made into a co-educational boarding-school of some importance.<br>
<br>The <i>pi&egrave;ce de r&eacute;sistance</i> of his life as a scholar and collector was the Coke Handel collection, which embraced important musical manuscripts, librettos, and autographs. Coke also enabled Handel scholars, such as O. E. Deutsch and W. C. Smith, to persevere with and complete their studies. Towards the end of his life he was instrumental in arranging for the publication of a Handel iconography, and for the creation of the Gerald Coke Handel Foundation, to manage the Coke Handel collection both before and after its transfer to the Foundling Museum, London. His <span class="italic">In Search of James Giles</span> (1983) was the culmination of his other great enthusiasm, his porcelain collection.<br>
<br>If Coke was an amateur, then this term can only be understood in the sense that music, opera, porcelain, or the art of garden cultivation were not the source of his income but the objects of his expenditure. His knowledge and expertise in so many disparate fields were prodigious, but they were always imparted to others with that modesty and self-effacement which characterized him, and which perhaps led to his failure to receive higher official honours.<br>
<br>In appearance Coke was tall and slender, with an upright bearing. On 2 September 1939 Coke married Patricia (<i>d</i>. 1995), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32234/', "Sir Alexander George Montagu Cadogan")</script>, the diplomatist. The marriage was one of exceptional happiness and harmony, and of shared interests in gardening, music, and collecting. They had a daughter and three sons, the third of whom died of meningitis suddenly in 1972, a day after his successful final degree examination at London University. Coke died at Jenkyn Place, Bentley, of heart failure, on 9 January 1990. A concert in his memory was given at Glyndebourne on 5 August 1990, at which it was disclosed that Coke had persuaded his shipping heiress friend, the countess of Munster, to sell one of her ships, and with the proceeds endow a trust for education in music.<br>
