<span class="headword">Kerr,  Norman Shanks</span>  (1834&#150;1899), <span class="occ">physician and temperance advocate</span>, the eldest son of Alexander Kerr, a merchant and shipowner, was born at Glasgow on 17 May 1834. He was educated at Glasgow high school and matriculated in 1852 from Glasgow University, where he supported himself by working on the staff of Glasgow newspapers until he graduated MD and CM in 1861. After a period as resident surgeon to the Lock Hospital, Glasgow, he sailed as surgeon on Canadian mail steamers.<br>
<br>In 1871 Kerr began to practise medicine at Dunstable, where he was the public vaccinator. Three years later he settled at St John's Wood in London and was appointed a parochial medical officer for St Marylebone, a post he retained for twenty-four years. He was twice married: first, in 1871, to Eleanor Georgina, daughter of Edward Gibson of Ballinderry, Ireland; she died in 1892, leaving four daughters and a son, Arthur (<i>d</i>. 1933), a rector in the Church of England. Kerr's second marriage, in 1894, was to Edith Jane (<i>d</i>. 1922), daughter of James Henderson of Belvidere Lodge, Newry, co. Down, Ireland. She served as a vice-president of the British Women's Total Abstinence Union.<br>
<br>The advancement of temperance was a life's work for Kerr. Although he may have consumed alcohol during his time as a ship's doctor and at Dunstable, he was otherwise a life abstainer. He joined the United Kingdom Alliance in 1858, having, at the age of nineteen, already become a founder and secretary of the Glasgow Abstainer's Union. In Glasgow he promoted counter-attractions to discourage the drinking of alcoholic beverages, such as the Coffee Tavern Company and Saturday evening concerts at City Hall. He was also an active member of the Total Abstinence Society, which operated in connection with the University of Glasgow. Later he was vice-president of the Marylebone Temperance and Band of Hope Union, and honorary secretary of a local branch of the Church of England Temperance Society.<br>
<br>Kerr sought to organize medical opinion behind legislation for the compulsory treatment of drunkenness. He argued that drunkenness was a disease rather than a crime or a social problem. However, he did not completely break with the older moralistic condemnation of drunkenness, and stigmatized drunkards as suffering from a type of degeneration that left them morally weak. Despite the conclusions that could be made from his efforts in Glasgow, as a physician he argued for the importance of heredity in creating drunkards against those who stressed the effect of social environment.<br>
<br>Kerr promoted his views through a number of organizations and publications. For many years he was a member and sometimes chairman of the inebriates legislation committee of the British Medical Association. He was elected president of the Society for Promoting Legislation for the Control and Cure of Habitual Drunkards, which he had helped found in 1876. Most important, in 1884 he founded a successor organization, the Society for the Study and Cure of Inebriety. Until his death Kerr served as president of the new society and edited its <span class="italic">Proceedings</span>. In addition he was vice-president (and from 1881 honorary secretary) of the Homes for Inebriates Association and senior consulting physician to the Dalrymple Home for Inebriates, at Rickmansworth, Hertfordshire. He was corresponding secretary to an American organization, the Association for the Cure of Inebriates, and vice-president of the International Council of Medical Jurisprudence. He wrote several books and many articles, including <span class="italic">Inebriety, its Etiology, Pathology, Treatment, and Jurisprudence</span> (1888). The <span class="roman">Habitual Drunkards Act</span> of 1878 and the <span class="roman">Inebriates Act</span> of 1898 resulted in large part from Kerr's labours.<br>
<br>In his 1905 memorial lecture T. D. Crothers characterized Kerr as &#145;calm&#146; and &#145;optimistic&#146;, a tactful speaker and writer who won over temperance reformers predisposed to reject the disease theory, and a masterful organizer who secured the active co-operation of people with discordant views.<br>
<br>Kerr was an Anglican and a Liberal. Retiring for reasons of ill health, he moved to Hastings in Sussex, where he died at his home, 46 Wellington Square, on 30 May 1899. He was buried in the following month at Paddington cemetery in London.<br>
