<span class="headword">Adams,  Norman Edward Albert</span>  (1927&#150;2005), <span class="occ">artist</span>, was born on 9 February 1927 in a flat at 74 Shernhall Street, Walthamstow, Essex, the only child of Albert Henry Adams (1900&#150;1975), a London Transport clerk, and his wife, Elizabeth Winifred Rose, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Humphries (1906&#150;2000). The family moved shortly afterwards to Hendon and later Burnt Oak to be nearer their families, the house in which most of his childhood was then spent being one of the many &#145;sunshine semis&#146; of the suburbs of north London. In 1940 he won a free place at Harrow Art School, where he stayed until 1946, meeting Anna Theresa Butt (<i>b</i>. 1926), daughter of George Baseden Butt, magazine editor, in 1944 when they were both students of painting. They married at Hendon register office on 18 January 1947, just in time for the great Europe-wide snowfall.<br>
<br>From Harrow Adams had won a scholarship to the Royal College of Art but his call-up papers had swiftly followed. He registered as a conscientious objector, but spent &#145;seven terrifying weeks&#146; in Wormwood Scrubs prison for refusing to attend an army medical as ordered by the tribunal that turned him down  (Usherwood, 12). Never a church-goer, and later calling himself a &#145;sort of freelance agnostic&#146;  (<span class="italic">Sunday Telegraph</span>, 14 May 1995), he credited that short but intense experience, during which he was much impressed by the prison chaplain, with convincing him that art had to have a message. Throughout his life he read considerably on religion and various mythologies, and his painting from the very first reflected a deep concern for both spiritual matters and music. He had discovered William Blake at the age of sixteen and Blake remained his great hero. He received no formal musical education but there had been a classical record society at Harrow, attended by staff as well as students; and the new BBC Third Programme became his musical university from 1947.<br>
<br>In 1948, after two years as a farm labourer in lieu of army service, Adams was able to take up his place at the Royal College of Art. He left three years later with the bronze medal for painting, having been taught by many talented figurative artists of the period, notably John Minton, Francis Bacon, Rodrigo Moynihan, and particularly Carel Weight, who continued to take a helpful interest in the young artist. His first solo exhibition was at Gimpel Fils in 1952, which led to a commission to design the sets for a ballet called <span class="italic">A Mirror for Witches</span>, choreographed by Andr&eacute;e Howard and staged at Covent Garden. In 1955 he designed costumes as well as sets for <span class="italic">Saudades</span>, choreographed by Alfred Rodrigues and performed at Sadler's Wells. By this time he had moved to Roland, Browse, and Delbanco in Cork Street as his dealers, who gave him two-yearly shows until the late 1970s.<br>
<br>Another early commission, completed in 1954, was for murals of <span class="italic">The Odyssey</span> for the library of one of the earliest comprehensive schools, Broad Lane in Coventry, Adams and his wife having met the architect, Michael Smith. The school was later listed and renamed the Woodland School and Sports College. Parallel with these early successes Adams undertook stints of part-time teaching at Hammersmith and Maidstone art schools and then for nine years at St Albans. Among his colleagues at this lively school run by Mary Hoad were the experimental sculptor George Fullard and the painter Euan Uglow.<br>
<br>In the spring of 1955, while camping at Clapham in the Yorkshire dales, Adams and his wife found an affordable cottage with a barn that had studio potential. It stood on Butts Hill in Horton-in-Ribblesdale, so-called from the ancient village archery location: it was simply a coincidence it matched Anna's maiden name. In 1956 their eldest son, Jacob, was born, soon followed in 1958 by Benjamin, and the routine of wintering in London and summering in Yorkshire continued for six years. Then in 1962 Adams was appointed head of painting at Manchester College of Art, where he stayed until 1970: for the first four years he stayed for three nights a week in a camper van in Manchester, returning for long weekends at Horton. In 1967, the year Adams was elected an associate of the Royal Academy, he was among several young and up-and-coming artists asked by Oxford University Press to illustrate parts of the <span class="roman">Old Testament</span> in five volumes. His colleagues in this project, including John Bratby and Alan Reynolds, all upheld in their own distinctive ways the English tradition. Adams held a particular distrust of the American influence on European painting, and maintained a missionary zeal that serious painters should be involved in higher education.<br>
<br>Ever enthusiastic explorers (though Adams never flew), the family had spent more than a month in the west of Scotland in 1963 and crossed to the Outer Hebrides. They paid a brief visit to the tiny island of Scarp, where six years later they bought a crofter's shieling where much of the 1970s was spent. This was a very productive decade, being almost free of teaching commitments apart from part-time lecturing at Leeds University from 1975 to 1978. In 1971 St Anselm's Church, in Kennington, commissioned Adams to paint large-scale murals on both sides of its aisle. The theme he chose was the <span class="roman">Pilgrim's Progress</span>, though he portrayed Bunyan's images in a semi-abstract language. In 1975 he made fourteen ceramic panels depicting the stations of the cross for the Roman Catholic church of Our Lady of Lourdes in Milton Keynes. Anna Adams's work as a ceramic sculptor and writer flourished and they began to visit Provence frequently, finding new sources of creativity together: he would say later, &#145;hardly a day goes by when I don't discover a new colour&#146;  (Usherwood, 80). In the spring of 1981, after returning from one of these first expeditions without their sons, Adams applied for the chair of fine art and director of King Edward VII College, Newcastle University, a post he held for five years.<br>
<br>The post for which Adams was best known, keeper of the Royal Academy Schools, was offered in 1986: he was glad to return to London and work in an establishment run by fellow artists. He had been elected a full member in 1972, and after nine years became in 1995 professor of painting, a post he held until he retired in 2000. The major part of his new salary consisted of a spacious and sky-lit residential studio at the top of Burlington House, just off Piccadilly. The academy respected his view that the work of professional artists involved in the training of the young should not be hampered, else they would have little to teach. Adams eschewed bureaucracy in all art schools, managing to tread the fine line between dealing with it while not letting it overtake the primacy of discussion and practical involvement with each student. His facility for watercolour resulted in his being invited by the Royal Watercolour Society to become an honorary member in 1987. In 1988 he illustrated Anna's book of mainly urban poems, <span class="italic">Angels of Soho</span>, and in 1991 contributed eight watercolours to <span class="italic">Island Chapters</span>, a book about their life on Scarp. In 1994 an anthology of articles about their life in Yorkshire, <span class="italic">Life on Limestone</span>, originally written for <span class="italic">The Guardian</span> and the <span class="italic">Craven Herald</span>, reproduced eight Ribblesdale watercolours. Earlier he had also illustrated books written by Glyn Hughes, <span class="italic">Alibis and Convictions</span> (1978), and John Milner, <span class="italic">A Decade of Painting, 1971&#150;81</span> (1981).<br>
<br>In 1994 Dennis Clinch, the visionary parish priest of the oldest Roman Catholic church in Britain, St Mary's, Mulberry Street, Manchester, advised by Wendy Beckett, commissioned what Adams himself considered the greatest work of his life, the cycle in oils for the stations of the cross. Proving more easily comprehensible than the cycle at St Anselm's and more modern, even African in their influence, than his murals at Milton Keynes, they were summarized by Anna Adams as illustrating &#145;everything that has happened in the outside world in the way of men's ongoing crucifixion of one another&#146;  (<span class="italic">Stations of the Cross</span>, 9). Moving many visitors to tears, they were shown at the Royal Academy's Sackler galleries before being installed at the church, affectionately known as the &#145;hidden gem&#146;, in 1995.<br>
<br>Soon after the dedication of the stations, worrying symptoms Adams had gradually been experiencing were diagnosed as Parkinson's disease. While both his travelling life and his ability to draw direct from nature were curtailed his passion for painting from the imagination continued apace, still inspired by an enduring love of Blake and, to name but two others, Giotto and Gr&uuml;newald. He worked on large watercolour compositions for eight years until his right hand lost its cunning. He last used the studio in Yorkshire in 2003 and thereafter, when not in hospital, he lived in the studio in Gainsborough Road, Chiswick, that he and Anna had bought in 1990. Anna was caring for him there when in August 2004 a violent rainstorm caused the main sewers in the road to overflow and their ground floor was completely flooded: Adams's bed became an island. While the water subsided the ensuing damage made life very difficult, so at the beginning of February 2005 he was moved into the Dudley House nursing home at Isleworth. He died there of bronchopneumonia on 9 March 2005 and was buried over the wall from the cottage in Yorkshire, at the Norman church of St Oswald, Horton, next to his mother, who had moved to Settle in her widowhood. He was survived by his wife, Anna, and their two sons. His gravestone is inscribed with a line from John Donne, &#145;I shall be made thy music&#146;.<br>
