<span class="headword">Yewdall,  John</span>  (1795&#150;1856), <span class="occ">poet</span>, was born in Quarries, Leeds, on 29 September 1795, the second of the three children of John Youdel. Nothing further is known about Yewdall's parents, and little is known of his childhood; he received only three weeks' formal education. As a young man he undertook an apprenticeship in the cloth industry, but continued to educate himself, and was an active member of the Wesleyan community in Leeds. Yewdall married Sarah Newton on 3 March 1812 (nothing more is known about his wife, but they had three children: James, George, and Edwin). Following a decline in the woollen industry about 1820, he obtained the post of toll-keeper at Hunslet toll bar, Leeds: this experience provided the inspiration for &#145;The Toll Bar&#146;.<br>
<br>&#145;The Toll Bar&#146; comprises two cantos, is written in the style of Byron's <span class="italic">Don Juan</span>, and was included within <span class="italic">The Toll Bar and other Poems</span> (1827). Canto 1 defends the conduct of toll-keepers and gives a satirical account of the means by which persons from all social ranks attempt to avoid the payment of tolls. The remaining poems within the volume touch on a variety of subjects; there are poems in praise of the Yorkshire cloth industry, two poems in praise of economy, and several poems with Wesleyan themes. Yewdall's poetry is not of great literary significance, but the unusual subject matter and the circumstances surrounding its composition lend it interest.<br>
<br>Yewdall became involved in local politics during the late 1820s when, as a parochial economist, he was involved in the Leeds vestry dispute. He formed an association with Edward Baines senior, and was elected to Leeds council in 1843. During this period Yewdall also established himself as a tea merchant in Briggate, and was appointed assistant overseer for Hunslet where he continued to live. He died at his home in Glasshouse Street, Hunslet, on 30 March 1856.<br>
<br>The autobiographical preface to <span class="italic">The Toll Bar and Other Poems</span> gives some indication of Yewdall's personality. He seems to have been pious and determined, but also to have possessed a sharp sense of humour<br>
