<span class="headword">Master,  William</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1627, <em>d.</em> 1684), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, was baptized on 7 September 1627 at Cirencester, the second son, in a family of six sons and six daughters, of <a name="cosubject_18314"></a><span class="headword">Sir William Master</span>  (1600/01&#150;1662), <span class="occ">local politician</span>, and his wife, Alice Estcourt (<i>d</i>. 1660). Sir William was the son of George Master (<i>b</i>. 1556?) and Bridget Cornwall, and the grandson of Elizabeth I's physician, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18311/', "Richard Master")</script>&#151;the family was one of the most important in the Cirencester area. He was admitted to the Inner Temple in November 1612 and knighted on 3 December 1622. He was MP for Cirencester in 1624 and high sheriff of Gloucestershire in 1627, when he was also among twelve county commissioners who refused either to pay the forced loan or to enforce it on others. He was present when Lord Chandos tried unsuccessfully to execute the commission of array at Cirencester on 15 August 1642 and afterwards smuggled Chandos away through his house to escape the wrath of the mob. Prince Rupert and Prince Maurice quartered at his house and batteries were sited in his garden prior to the sack of Cirencester on 2 February 1643. During the civil war he was a moderately active royalist, though not in arms. He was nominated to the royalist commission of the peace in March 1643 and to several other administrative commissions. Sir William surrendered to the county committee in August 1644 but then entertained the king at his house on the night of 31 October 1644. The estates, already severely reduced in value, were consequently sequestered. He took the covenant and the negative oath on 18 February 1647 and petitioned to compound for his estates, claiming that he had only acted as he had to prevent worse damage. In 1650 he compounded for &pound;1200, plus a further &pound;282 for undervaluations in 1652. He died on 3 March 1662 at the age of sixty-one, a year and a half after the death of his wife, Alice Estcourt, on 5 September 1660, and was buried at Cirencester.<br>
<br>The younger William Master matriculated at Christ Church, Oxford, on 2 April 1647 and was admitted as a fellow of Merton College while still an undergraduate by order of the parliamentary visitors on 25 March 1650. He graduated BA on 7 November 1650 and MA on 19 November 1652. He also took a BD, according to Anthony Wood. In 1653 he published <span class="italic">Essayes and Observations Theologicall and Morall</span>, a series of twenty-five short, well-written essays on the humours of the age, under the pseudonym &#145;A student in theologie&#146;. These actually skirted around theological matters and did not openly express Master's firmly Anglican views. Instead, he contrasted the wise government under bishop or presbyter in the primitive church with the false certainties of contemporary saints who &#145;take upon themselves to be Daniels, persons greatly beloved of God and yet have no better authoritie for their assurance, than that of a presumptuous fancy&#146;. Master also took a wry dig at Cromwell, noting that &#145;Alexander's way with Gordian knots is too well knowne in this age, and too much practised&#146;  (Master, 52&#150;3, 86). In 1654 he published, again anonymously, <span class="italic">Drops of Myrrhe</span>, seven prayers and meditations on such matters as &#145;a distracted Church and state&#146; and the spirit of moderation and discernment. Wing's <span class="italic">Short-Title Catalogue</span> also attributes to Master an anonymous tract of 1653 entitled <span class="italic">Master John Goodwins Quere Questioned</span>, which rebutted Goodwin's denial of the magistrate's right to enforce observation of the sabbath and generally upheld his powers in religious matters. The beliefs this expresses are similar to Master's, but the writing style is different.<br>
<br>At some stage before 20 May 1658 Master was presented to the vicarage of Preston, near Cirencester, the advowson of which was in the family. On that date he officiated at the wedding of George Bull, the future bishop of St David's and a close friend of the family, using the proscribed Anglican form. Master became rector of Woodford, Essex, on 13 February 1661 and prebendary of Chamberlainwood at St Paul's on 17 July 1663. On 18 May 1665, at Woodford, he married Susanna Yate, daughter of the Revd Job Yate, rector of Rodmarton, Gloucestershire. They had two sons and a daughter: Richard, Thomas, and Elizabeth. He resigned the prebend of Chamberlainwood in 1666 and was collated to the rectory of Southchurch, Essex, on 3 July 1666 by Archbishop Sheldon. He resigned this living after he was appointed by royal prerogative to the prebend of Caddington Major in St Paul's on 14 February 1667. On 29 April 1671 Sheldon conferred on him the rectory of St Vedast-alias-Foster, London, with the united parish of St Michael-le-Querne, which he retained until his death. His wife was living when he made his will on 27 April 1684; he was buried at Woodford on 6 September 1684.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_18310"></a><span class="headword">John Master</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1637, <em>d.</em> in or after 1684), <span class="occ">physician</span>, was William Master's younger brother and their parents' fifth son. He was baptized at Cirencester on 25 September 1637, although he was said to be forty-eight years old in 1682. He matriculated at Christ Church, Oxford, on 20 July 1654, graduated BA on 3 February 1657, proceeded MA from St Mary Hall on 25 June 1659, and was created MD from Christ Church on 4 July 1672. He was unmarried. He assisted the noted medical author Thomas Willis in some of his publications and was admitted an honorary fellow of the Royal College of Physicians on 30 September 1680. He is last recorded on 27 April 1684, when William Master named him an executor of his will.<br>
