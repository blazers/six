<span class="headword">Sadler, Sir  James Hayes</span>  (1851&#150;1922), <span class="occ">army officer and colonial governor</span>, was the eldest son of Sir James Hayes Sadler (1827&#150;1910), army officer and consular official, and his wife, Sophia Jane (<i>d</i>. 1902), daughter of James W. Taylor of the East India Company. His father, after reaching the rank of colonel in the Royal Artillery, joined the consular service in 1879, serving successively in Boulogne, Caen, La Rochelle, Panama, Chicago, Valpara&iacute;so, and Santiago; he retired in 1897 and was made a KCMG in 1899. A younger son, Arthur Hayes Sadler (1863&#150;1952), reached the rank of admiral in the Royal Navy.<br>
<br>Little is known of Sadler's early life, until in July 1870 he was commissioned into the Sussex artillery militia. His early postings included the 61st foot (in Canada and Ireland), the 33rd Bengal native infantry (in India), the Indian staff corps, and the government of India's foreign department. In 1875 he married Rita Annie (<i>d</i>. 1918), daughter of Colonel Wemyss Smith, of the Bengal staff corps. In July 1877 he joined the government of India's political department and in May 1881 became assistant agent to the governor-general in Baroda. He then served as assistant secretary in the legislative department. In April 1891 he was appointed political agent in Kotah and Jhallawar. In February 1892 he was on special duty with Prince Damrong of Siam, and in November 1892 he became political agent and consul in Muscat. In June 1893 he was promoted agent in residence and consul-general to the Persian Gulf. In April 1895 he became assistant secretary of the foreign department of the government of India.<br>
<br>Sadler's first major east African posting was as political agent and consul-general in the Somaliland protectorate (1898&#150;1901). On 12 April 1899 he informed the War Office that a mullah named Haji Muhammad &#145;Abdallah Hasan had started collecting weapons and recruiting fighters in hopes of establishing control over the south-eastern part of the protectorate and launching an expedition against Abyssinia's Christian-dominated government. In early 1899 the mullah carried out his first military operation in the Somaliland protectorate by attacking Burao. His force included about 3000 irregular fighters who were armed with daggers and spears; they also had some sixty modern rifles and a small quantity of ammunition. However, Sadler's fear that the mullah's guerrilla force would attack Berbera, an important sea port for the British, and other strategically important towns, proved to be unfounded. On 30 July 1899 Sadler reported to the Foreign Office that the &#145;Mullah has gone off his head&#146; and had fired twice at his nephew. In the aftermath of these incidents, Muhammad became known as the Mad Mullah. His followers subsequently raided many tribal camps and attacked rival religious sects. The mullah and some of his followers then retired to the wells at Odwein, located south-west of Burao, to await the spring rains. By August 1899 he had occupied Burao with a force of some 5000 fighters, 1500 of whom were mounted. On 30 April 1901 Sadler issued a proclamation that supporters of the &#145;mullah&#146; &#145;will be considered as hostile to the government and will be treated as such&#146;. Despite his warning, competing interests in London between the Colonial Office, the Foreign Office, and the War Office prevented immediate action against the mullah, and it was not until 1920 that he was finally defeated.<br>
<br>On 1 January 1901 Sadler became commissioner of Buganda, with responsibility also for the kingdoms of Bunyoro, Ankole, and Toro. He was assisted by a staff of four sub-commissioners, eight collectors, and fifteen assistant collectors. Despite this small staff the protectorate had a high court, secretariat, treasury, public works office, survey offices, and a military headquarters, all of which were located in Entebbe. Their most important duties included magisterial and judicial work, police force supervision, hut tax collection, and the promotion of agriculture and trade.<br>
<br>In April 1901 a sleeping sickness epidemic spread around Lake Victoria's northern shore and eventually claimed the lives of 250,000 people. In January 1902 Sadler started drafting a report on the epidemic. He also authorized the establishment of sleeping sickness isolation camps on islands in Lake Victoria. In 1903 the Royal Society sent David Bruce to Uganda to investigate the disease. He confirmed that the bite of the tsetse fly transmitted the disease. Some of Sadler's other accomplishments in Uganda included the transfer in March 1902 of the government stations at Baringo, Fort Ternan, Kisumu, Mumias, Naivasha, Nakuru, Nandi, and Ravice (al-Dama) to British East Africa. In November 1902 a fire destroyed Mengo Hospital; Sadler dispatched 400 men to help build a temporary hospital. In 1903 he sought to facilitate Uganda's economic development by distributing 1.5 tons of cotton seed to African farmers. In April 1904 he opened the new law courts at Entebbe, and in November that year he presided over the newly built Mengo Hospital. He acknowledged that Uganda would never be a &#145;white man's country&#146; like British East Africa or South Africa.<br>
<br>In early 1904 Sadler received a report that a large Ethiopian force, which included 415 soldiers and 600 camp followers, had raided northern Uganda for cattle and slaves. This deployment challenged British claims north of Mount Elgon. To deter future raids Sadler wanted to send a company of troops to Manimani in Karamoja and to establish permanent police posts at Sebei and Mount Kadem. However, the Foreign Office vetoed these proposals as it feared a harsh Ethiopian reaction. Despite this setback Sadler tried to control ivory raiders by moving the government station in Budaka to Mbale and by introducing legislation to control their activities. He also restricted the number of firearms carried by caravans. Near the end of his tenure he realized that British authority in northern Uganda&#151;which was limited to stations in Gondokoro, Nimule, and Wadelai&#151;exerted very little authority over the tribes in these regions. He also observed that the territory north of Mount Elgon was &#145;destitute of any sign of our authority&#146;.<br>
<br>On 12 December 1905 Sadler became commissioner of British East Africa (Kenya), his title being upgraded to governor as of the end of that year. His most immediate challenge concerned difficulties with the Nandi people, who had been attacking the Uganda railway line and a nearby road. His predecessor, Sir Donald Stewart, had authorized the creation of a field force that included six companies of the King's African rifles and 200 armed police, supported by more than 1000 Maasai and Somali auxiliaries. By November 1905 hostilities had been nearly terminated. The Nandi field force had lost forty-two soldiers killed while forty-eight others had sustained wounds. The Nandi had lost 626 killed. Government forces had also captured 10,300 cattle and 18,000 sheep. In December 1905 Sadler presided over peace talks with the Nandi. He decided that the two most violent sections of the Nandi&#151;the Kamelilo and the Kapchependi&#151;would be moved to a reserve north of their traditional lands. The Colonial Office received the news with satisfaction. In June 1906 Sadler ordered two columns of troops, one from Fort Hall and another from Nyeri, to enter Embu territory around Mount Kenya. Among other things Embu warriors had attacked the pro-British M'bee. Within a month government forces had broken all resistance; only two soldiers were killed, while the Embu had lost 407 warriors, as well as 3180 cattle and 7150 sheep and goats. In January 1908 the Kisii revolted at the urging of a local witch doctor. Sadler responded by again deploying government forces. During the fighting the Kisii lost ninety warriors, 4800 cattle, and 2500 goats and sheep. Sadler also extended colonial administration into northern areas inhabited by the Samburu, Suk, and Turkana.<br>
<br>However, Sadler's firmness with Africans was not matched in his dealings with the colony's European settlers. According to Alfred Claud Hollis, a trader and colonial official, Sadler was &#145;very industrious, kind and hospitable, but weak and vacillating, and quite unable to cope with the unruly settlers&#146;. Charles William Hobley, another colonial official, characterized him as &#145;a charming old gentleman&#146;. Although there were only some 600 European settlers in British East Africa, their political influence was substantial. Such leading personalities as Lord Delamere and Ewart W. Grogan were determined to turn Kenya into a &#145;white man's colony&#146;. Lady Delamere called Sadler &#145;flannelfoot&#146; because of his perceived weakness and his failure to accommodate the European settler community  (Bennett, 26). In November 1907 Hollis became secretary for native affairs and drafted new labour rules that provoked a confrontation between Sadler and the European community. According to the document employers were required to build housing and to provide blankets, food, medical care, and water for African labourers. In addition Hollis prohibited chiefs from compelling labour and instituted regulations to control recruitment. In March 1908 the Colonists' Association immediately attacked Sadler, claiming that the new regulations would raise the cost of labour by 25 per cent. An acrimonious dispute prompted Sadler to suspend Lord Delamere and Arthur Ballie from the legislative council. However, he made some modifications to the new regulations: food would be provided only if African labourers could not find provisions locally, and blankets did not have to be provided to workers who did not regularly use them.<br>
<br>Sadler's final posting, to Grenada as governor of the Windward Islands, a relative backwater, from April 1909 to September 1914, reflected London's displeasure with his inability to quell the incessant demands of the European settler community in Kenya. His time in Grenada was uneventful, and he retired to England in 1914. He had been made a CB in 1902 and knighted KCMG in 1907. He died at St Briac, Brittany, on 21 April 1922 and was survived by a son, his wife having predeceased him and two sons having been killed in the early stages of the First World War.<br>
