<span class="headword">Driscoll,  James <span class="st"> [Jim]</span></span>  (1880&#150;1925), <span class="occ">boxer</span>, was born on 5 December 1880 at 12 Ellen Street in Newtown, Cardiff's main Irish quarter, the second son of the four surviving children of Cornelius Driscoll (1856&#150;1881), a railwayman on the docks who died in an accident at work soon after Jim's birth, and his wife, Elizabeth (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Burns). His first job was in the printing works of the local <span class="italic">Evening Express</span>, where there was a boxing club, and despite its rudimentary facilities&#151;&#145;gloves&#146; were made from waste paper and string from the packing department&#151;the fistic skills of club captain Driscoll soon brought him to the attention of larger and better-organized clubs in Cardiff. By seventeen he was appearing regularly in Jack Scarrott's fight booths in the south Wales valleys, and in 1901 he graduated into professional boxing. On 30 June 1907 he married Edith Gwynne (Edie) Wiltshire (<i>b</i>. 1880/81).<br>
<br>At 5 feet 6 inches tall and weighing 9 stone, the clean-limbed, dark-haired Driscoll was fast and skilful; upright in stance, he possessed a flashing blade of a left hand with which he would beat his opponent into submission before employing a devastating right to deliver the final blow. These trademarks were all in evidence when he beat Joe Bowker on 25 September 1906 at the National Sporting Club (NSC) for the British featherweight title. The world title at that weight was held by Abe Attell, the &#145;little Hebrew&#146; of New York, who won it in 1904. Attell's most difficult fight during the six years he held the title was against Driscoll on 19 February 1909 at the National Athletic Club in New York. The Irish&#150;Welshman's success against each of his nine opponents during his four-month tour of the US between November 1908 and February 1909 made him a worthy opponent for Attell and they met on a &#145;no decision&#146; basis, which meant that to claim the fight a boxer had to knock out or otherwise stop his opponent. For the entire ten rounds Attell was given a master class in the &#145;sweet science&#146; in a performance which, though it failed to achieve the knockout which would have brought Driscoll the championship, earned him the name Peerless Jim. This nickname was first bestowed on him by the gunslinging scourge of Dodge City turned sports journalist and former US marshal Bat Masterson. Attell offered Driscoll a return bout for the world title, but Jim had promised to return home to box an exhibition match at the annual charity show of the Nazareth House Roman Catholic Orphanage in Cardiff. There would never be another chance to challenge for the title.<br>
<br>At home Driscoll was naturally, if inaccurately, hailed as world champion. In February 1910 he beat Seaman Arthur Hayes for the British featherweight title over six rounds, and retained it by defeating Frank (Spike) Robson, twice, to become the first British boxer to become an outright holder of one of the coveted belts donated by Lord Lonsdale. In challenging his compatriot Freddie Welsh for the British welterweight title, however, he was conceding several pounds to his sturdier opponent. On a night choking with tension, 20 December 1910, at Cardiff's American Roller Rink arena, Welsh's street-fighter tactics of elbowing, gouging, and rabbit-punching drove an increasingly frustrated Driscoll into reckless retaliation in the tenth round, when he flagrantly and repeatedly butted Welsh across the ring and was immediately disqualified.<br>
<br>From then on Driscoll fought infrequently. The second match with Robson was his sole contest in 1911, and he fought only once in 1912, though it was to win the European featherweight title by knocking out the French champion Jean Posey in the twelfth round. He drew with the experienced Owen Moran at the NSC in January 1913, then announced his retirement. On the outbreak of war he was drafted into the army as a physical training and boxing instructor, and celebrated the peace by training the British army team to win the allied boxing tournament at the Royal Albert Hall.<br>
<br>At this point Driscoll, now in the early stages of tuberculosis and in financial straits, sought to revive his own boxing career. Although in March 1919 he easily beat the ageing Pedlar Palmer, who had challenged for the world bantamweight title in 1899, two months later he could only draw with the much younger and less experienced Francis Rossi of Pontypridd. Then he ill-advisedly agreed to fight Charles Ledoux, the thickset and stumpy French bantamweight champion known as the &#145;little assassin&#146; who was 6 inches shorter but twelve years his junior. At the NSC on 20 October 1919 the immaculate left jab of a drawn and haggard Peerless Jim kept him well ahead for fourteen rounds, but at the end of that round he was shaken by a desperate right to the body from which he never recovered, and his seconds threw in the towel at the start of the sixteenth. Had this contest been over fifteen rounds instead of twenty, Driscoll, by common consent, would have won. The reluctant victor, Ledoux, paid him a handsome tribute: &#145;Jim Driscoll is the master. He is the greatest man I have ever met or ever shall meet. He played with me for fourteen and a half rounds and I could do absolutely nothing&#146;  (Hails, 16).<br>
<br>Jim Driscoll died at home in the Duke of Edinburgh Hotel at 18 Ellen Street, Cardiff, on 30 January 1925 and his military-style funeral took place on 3 February. After requiem mass at St Paul's Roman Catholic Church 100,000 mourners accompanied his coffin, draped in the union flag and carried behind a gun carriage, to burial at Cathays cemetery. He was survived by his wife, Edie.<br>
