</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Blackie,  John Stuart</span>  (1809&#150;1895), <span class="occ">classical and Scottish Gaelic scholar</span>, was born on 28 July 1809 in Charlotte Street, Glasgow, the eldest son of Alexander Blackie (<i>bap</i>. 1780, <i>d</i>. 1856), banker, and Helen (1783&#150;1819), daughter of William Stodart of Hamilton and his wife, Christina. In that year his father moved as manager of the Commercial Bank to Aberdeen, where Blackie was educated at Merson's academy, a private subscription school, and at Marischal College (1821&#150;4), where he attended the Greek class. Intended by his father for law, he was placed in an advocate's office, but, with a preference for theology, he went to Edinburgh to complete an arts course, including Greek, which he pursued in 1825&#150;6, but without graduating.<br>
<br>Preparing for entry to a divinity hall, Blackie returned to Aberdeen to study theology for two years with a view to entering the ministry. A decisive change in his plans resulted from his being sent to Germany in April 1829, studying in G&ouml;ttingen under scholars including Ottfried M&uuml;ller, and subsequently in Berlin with Boeckh and Schleiermacher. He also developed an enthusiasm for the long walks which were to become characteristic of his whole life. With two friends he travelled to Italy, adding facility in the language to his good knowledge of German. In Rome, with introductions to well-known scholars, in particular the Prussian diplomat Baron Christian von Bunsen, who became a great friend, he became interested in archaeology and art, and through contact with a Greek student learned also to speak modern Greek, becoming particularly fascinated by the accentuation, which differed so much from the traditional pronunciation of the ancient tongue.<br>
<br>On his return to Britain in 1831, when Blackie began to study for the Scottish bar, his enthusiasm for both the church and the law was waning, though he was admitted to the Faculty of Advocates in 1834, in which year he published his first substantial work, a translation of <span class="italic">Faust</span> which was commended by Carlyle. He began a series of articles, often on German literature, in literary periodicals, and joined Edinburgh's Speculative and Juridical societies, which helped him become well known in intellectual circles.<br>
<br>About this time the Liberal MP for Aberdeen, Alexander Bannerman, who was a close friend of Blackie's father, was pressing for the institution of a chair of humanity at Aberdeen, which alone of the Scottish universities did not have one. When in 1839 this was ratified, Blackie was appointed as its first incumbent, giving rise to vocal criticism of this being a &#145;whig job&#146;. Before he could be installed, Blackie was required to subscribe to the Westminster confession of faith, and though consenting to sign he nevertheless expressed reservations, declaring that his agreement was &#145;in reference to university offices and duties merely&#146;. The presbytery then attempted to annul the appointment, and Blackie had to raise an action first against the senatus, then the presbytery. The affair dragged on for two years before his installation was confirmed.<br>
<br>Meanwhile Blackie returned to Edinburgh, and became the suitor of Eliza Wyld (<i>bap</i>. 1819, <i>d</i>. 1908), but found her father opposed to the match. By the time his Aberdeen chair was ratified, Mr Wyld relented, and the couple were married on 19 April 1842. It was a long and happy (though childless) marriage. During his eleven years at Aberdeen Blackie applied himself strenuously to university reform, since<blockquote>the whole style of academical learning seemed so juvenile and pedantic &hellip; I had to sit down in a sort of intellectual Botany Bay, and teach raw country lads and little boys to blunder through Latin sentences, in the human meaning and purport of which they seemed incapable of taking any interest. (<span class="italic">Notes of a Life</span>, 129)</blockquote>In addition to university teaching, he embarked upon his noted popular lectures on a variety of subjects, delivered mainly extempore, which he found more effective than formal reading.In 1850 Blackie published his verse translation of Aeschylus's tragedies, and he seized the opportunity of succeeding to the Edinburgh Greek chair, when, as he put it bluntly, &#145;Dunbar [his predecessor] should retire from Greek, or the world, or from both together&#146;. He was appointed Greek professor in 1852, and &#145;exchanged Latin for Greek, copper for gold&#146;. His inaugural lecture was entitled &#145;Classical literature in its relation to the nineteenth century&#146;. Again he campaigned for reform, instituting an entrance examination, the introduction of a tutorial system, and the appointment of assistants. He published a short volume on his favourite subject of the pronunciation of Greek, lambasting the Oxford style &#145;case-hardened in ignorance, prejudice, and pedantry&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters</span>, 395). In 1857 his <span class="italic">Lays and Legends of Ancient Greece</span> was published.<br>
<br>In 1866 Blackie's substantial four-volume translation and commentary on the <span class="italic">Iliad</span> appeared. Among its often idiosyncratic notes, that on a minor figure, Agamede, had an interesting sequel. Blackie saw her as &#145;prophetic of Florence Nightingale&#146;, and concluded that &#145;a field of activity which has recently been claimed for the sex by English aspiration and American example should develop into the systematic instruction of women in certain departments of the medical art&#146;. At that very time, Sophia Jex-Blake was prosecuting her case for women's medical education in America, having also visited Edinburgh. When in 1869 she made her first attempt to enrol in the university, through the support of David Masson, professor of English, she gained an introduction to Blackie, who showed her his note, and was one of her most prominent supporters in the angry debates which ensued in senate. When the women were barred by an angry mob in the &#145;Surgeons' Hall riot&#146; of 1870, Blackie observed to her &#145;Ye can now say ye've fought with wild beasts at Ephesus&#146;, and on their ultimate victory he composed a Greek triumphal ode for one of the first graduates at a meeting of the Hellenic Society which he formed in Edinburgh, as he had earlier done in Aberdeen. Subsequently, the women's bronze class medal in the Medical College for Women pictured Homer's Agamede, doubtless at Blackie's suggestion.<br>
<br>There was nothing Blackie liked better than to espouse a cause and pursue it with unflagging commitment. He was a proponent of the new fine art chair (1873), and his passion for modern Greek led to the foundation of a theological fellowship for residence in Greece. (He himself had made the first of his journeys there in 1853.) He was active in support of the establishment of student halls of residence. Above all, he threw himself into fund-raising for a chair of Celtic from the 1870s until its establishment in 1882, almost single-handedly setting about raising the &pound;12,000 required by lecturing, hectoring, cajoling, almost compelling people (from Queen Victoria downwards) to contribute. He had been appalled by the plight of highland crofters, and became fired with enthusiasm for Gaelic, publishing <span class="italic">The Gaelic Language</span> in 1864, followed by <span class="italic">Lays of the Highlands and Islands</span> (1871), <span class="italic">The Language and Literature of the Highlands</span> (1876), and <span class="italic">Altavona &hellip; from my Life in the Highlands</span> (1882). Mention might be made here too of his <span class="italic">Life of Robert Burns</span> (1887) and <span class="italic">Scottish Song</span> (1889). Blackie's writings on Scotland made him an important figure in the historicist movement there.<br>
<br>Blackie's early enthusiasm for German student life had already resulted in publication of a collection of student songs (<span class="italic">Musa Burschicosa</span>, 1869) and <span class="italic">War Songs of the Germans</span> (1870), and he wrote the preface and contributed a number of his own songs to the once very popular, and much reprinted, <span class="italic">Scottish Students' Song Book</span> (1891). One song in the 1891 volume is about Blackie himself, by his Sanskrit colleague Julius Eggeling, &#145;A Famous Scotch Professor&#146;, celebrating Blackie's visit to Egypt aged seventy, when&#151;characteristically&#151;he mounted a pyramid to sing &#145;Scots wha hae&#146;. He was nothing if not the archetype of the perfervid Scot, and there was an undoubted coolness in his relations with &#145;those sleek Hellenists on the banks of the Cam and Isis&#146;, as he once remarked, and he argued for a separate Scottish parliament, against &#145;the multitudinous babblement and insolent centralisation&#146; of Westminster  (Kennedy, 111, 216). In 1867 he had engaged in a notorious two-day debate in the George Street Music Hall with Ernest Jones on democracy, when he attacked the <span class="roman">Reform Bill</span>, haranguing for nearly three hours.<br>
<br>As a teacher, Blackie was not entirely successful. One writer of memoirs commented &#145;he did everything well, except what he was paid to do, viz. teach Greek to his students&#146;  (D. T. Holmes, <span class="italic">Literary Tours in the Highlands and Islands of Scotland</span>, 1909, 56), who soon learned how to divert their professor to politics, Scottish song, or the like, and his classes were frequently rowdy. After an uproarious lecture, he could be seen striding cheerfully down the Bridges from Old College playing on imaginary bagpipes. He enjoyed his persona as a flamboyant eccentric, and with his long white hair and in his regular dress&#151;a plaid thrown over his shoulders, a long stick, and a soft hat with a broad band&#151;he was a familiar figure to the citizens. One well-known anecdote relates his posting of a notice that he was unable to meet &#145;his classes&#146;, which students adjusted by deleting the &#145;c&#146;; waiting to see how the professor would react, they saw him study the notice, and imperiously delete further the &#145;l&#146;. The story may be apocryphal, however, since the same tale was told of an earlier Edinburgh professor, W. E. Aytoun, and Blackie himself denied it.<br>
<br>Even after his retirement Blackie continued to lecture with gusto and good humour throughout Scotland, and was widely admired. He remained also an indefatigable traveller, last visiting Greece in 1891. Not until 1894, when he was attacked with asthma, did his health deteriorate somewhat, and his last public appearance was at the opening of the university session in October of that year. He died at his home at 9 Douglas Crescent on 2 March 1895, and after the public funeral service at St Giles was buried in the Dean cemetery four days later. It was a raw, drizzling day, yet the streets were lined with mourners along the route via Princes Street, and the cort&egrave;ge bore wreaths from persons as diverse as the prime minister and Sir Henry Irving. <span class="italic">The Scotsman</span> devoted nearly a whole page to his obituary, and the muse of notorious &#145;poet and tragedian&#146; William McGonagall was stirred to compose a funeral ode, to be found in his <span class="italic">Last Poetic Gems</span>. David Masson in a tribute referred to his &#145;almost childlike innocence of heart and a seraphic kind of goodness&#146;  (Duncan, 202).<br>
<br>In addition to the works mentioned above, Blackie published prolifically on Greek, Scottish, religious, philosophical, and political topics. A. Stodart Walker collected and published from manuscript &#145;random thoughts on life, character, literature, and general economics&#146; in <span class="italic">The Day-Book of John Stuart Blackie</span> (1901), and also compiled a selection of his poems (1896).<br>
