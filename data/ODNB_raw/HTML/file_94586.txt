<span class="headword">Hippisley, Sir  John</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1655), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was the third son of William Hippisley (<i>d</i>. 1630), of Marston Bigot, Somerset; his mother, of whom further details are unknown, was a daughter of one Burley of the Isle of Wight. Hippisley was the scion of a junior branch of a family that had secured gentry status with the purchase by his grandfather in 1544 of former monastic lands in Ston Easton, Somerset. His uncle, John Hippesley (<i>b</i>. before 1530, <i>d</i>. 1570), a successful lawyer, had represented both Bridport and Wells in the early Elizabethan parliaments. John Hippisley's first wife was Margaret (<i>d</i>. in or before 1615), daughter of Thomas Antrobus of Heath House, Petersfield, Hampshire; the couple had no children. His second wife, whom he married on 16 March 1615, was Katherine Norton (<i>d. c</i>.1659), daughter of Sir Richard Norton of East Tisted, Hampshire. The couple had one daughter, who predeceased them.<br>
<br>A younger son, of slender fortune, Hippisley took service with the prominent Roman Catholic sympathizer Henry Percy, ninth earl of Northumberland, and was implicated in the Gunpowder Plot and briefly imprisoned. He was knighted, on 14 April 1617, at about the time he left Northumberland's employ to become &#145;a principal favourite&#146; of the royal favourite, George Villiers, first duke of Buckingham  (Chamberlain, 2.152). Hippisley owed his appointment as keeper of Bushy Park, near Hampton Court, and as a royal equerry, to the duke's patronage. Between his return for Petersfield to the parliaments of 1621 and 1624 (on the interest of the Nortons), he accompanied Charles and Buckingham to Madrid to woo the infanta. Following Buckingham's appointment as lord warden of the Cinque Ports in 1624, Hippisley was made deputy warden and lieutenant-governor of Dover. He was returned for Dover to the parliaments of 1625, 1626, and 1628&#150;9, in which he and Buckingham were repeatedly criticized for illegally detaining foreign vessels and profiteering from the sale of prizes. It was not until 1639 that he obtained a royal pardon for his &#145;Dover offences &hellip; the sommes laid in charge [against him] amounted to &pound;411,000&#146;  (<span class="italic">Report on the Manuscripts of Lord De L'Isle and Dudley</span>, 6.192). His final duty as one of Buckingham's &#145;most slavish dependents&#146; was in August 1628, when he broke the news to Charles of the duke's assassination  (<span class="italic">CSP Venice, 1626&#150;8</span>, 571). Shortly thereafter he sold his lieutenant-governorship to Sir Edward Dering.<br>
<br>Having failed to secure Hippisley's return for Dover to the Short Parliament in 1640, Algernon Percy, tenth earl of Northumberland, found him a seat at the newly re-enfranchised Cumberland borough of Cockermouth in spring 1641. Hippisley's career in the Long Parliament began slowly. He was named to just fifteen committees before the outbreak of civil war, the majority of which related to securing London and Middlesex for parliament. His apparent belief in the existence of a high-level popish plot, and his support for tough measures against Catholics, served to distance him from the court interest. But if he was associated with any political grouping at Westminster it was not the puritan interest but Northumberland and his fellow estranged courtiers, the earls of Pembroke and Salisbury. He was a leading member of the same church congregation as these lords&#151;that of St Martin-in-the-Fields&#151;and was elected to the parish vestry in 1641. Hippisley may well have acted as the eyes and ears of Northumberland and his friends after the Commons gave him leave in July 1642 to attend the court for a month. He was back in the house by late August, when he declared his readiness to support parliament with life and estate. His time at court had apparently left him unconvinced that the king could be trusted to stand firm against popery.<br>
<br>Hippisley's parliamentary activities during the first year of the civil war are broadly consistent with the political concerns of Northumberland and the peace party. In November 1642 he was included on the parliamentary delegation, headed by Northumberland, to present an offer of peace to the king. On 9 August 1643 he was named to a committee for thanking the women who had flocked to Westminster a few days earlier in support of the doomed attempt by Northumberland and his allies to secure a peace settlement before the Scottish covenanters entered the civil war. In general, however, Hippisley seems to have been more active at Westminster in promoting the earl's personal business than his political agenda. He evidently sided with Northumberland and his fellow political Independents in their power struggle in 1645 with the presbyterian vicar of St Martin-in-the-Fields, Daniel Cawdrey.<br>
<br>Most of Hippisley's committee nominations and tellerships between 1643 and 1648 reveal little of his political allegiance. The same is also true of his appointment as a parliamentary commissioner to present the Newcastle propositions to the king in July 1646. In August 1647 he was granted leave to attend the king&#151;probably as Northumberland's agent in the Independents' attempts to secure Charles's acceptance of the <span class="italic">Heads of Proposals</span>. On 2 August 1648 he and John Bulkeley were chosen to inform Charles of parliament's decision to hold an unconditional treaty with him at Newport, on the Isle of Wight. Hippisley was known to remain in good odour with the king and could speak for Northumberland, who was a prime mover behind the treaty.<br>
<br>On 13 December 1648, a week after Pride's Purge, Hippisley arrived at the Commons only to be turned away by army officers&#151;probably because he had favoured the Newport treaty. He played no part in the king's trial and execution. But the regicide did not deter him from seeking admission to the Rump, which he secured on 12 February 1649. On 7 March he was named to a committee on a bill for abolishing kingship. Hippisley was apparently more active after Pride's Purge than he had been before it. He was named to almost fifty committees in the Rump, and served as a teller in nine divisions. Several of his tellerships suggest his alignment with MPs who wished to preserve as much of the established order as possible. Allegations that he was among a group of conservative Rumpers who were party to Christopher Love's presbyterian conspiracy in 1651 were groundless, but revealing of his perceived political sympathies. Nevertheless, he showed few qualms about purchasing crown and church lands. The majority of his committee appointments in the Rump related to diplomatic affairs, the maintenance of the armed forces, and the sale of royal estates. His involvement in nominating ministers to vacant livings, and his addition to the committees for plundered ministers and reforming the universities, imply support on his part for promoting a learned preaching ministry.<br>
<br>Hippisley's public career ended with the dissolution of the Rump in April 1653. He died in 1655, and was buried at St Martin-in-the-Fields on 4 September of that year. In his will he left the bulk of his estate to his widow, who died about 1659.<br>
