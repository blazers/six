<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Norman,  Montagu Collet</span>, Baron Norman  (1871&#150;1950), <span class="occ">banker</span>, was born on 6 September 1871 in Kensington, London, the eldest of the three children of Frederick Norman (1839&#150;1916), barrister and banker, and Lina Susan Collet (1851&#150;1950). He had a sister, and a brother, Ronald Norman (1873&#150;1963), who became chairman of London county council (1918&#150;19) and of the British Broadcasting Corporation (1935&#150;9). Montagu Norman gained little stimulus from formal education: after four unhappy years at Eton College he spent only a year at King's College, Cambridge (1889&#150;90).<br>
<br>Norman's real education was obtained during the next twelve years. In 1890 he lodged in Dresden to improve his German, later travelling around central Europe before perfecting his French in Switzerland. His values, aspirations, and early career were shaped by membership of two dynasties of City merchants and bankers. His father became a partner in Martin's Bank. His maternal grandfather, Mark Collet, to whom he was particularly close, was senior London partner in the Anglo-American merchant bank Brown, Shipley &amp; Co. and was also, like Norman's paternal grandfather <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20257/', "George Warde Norman (1793&#150;1882)")</script>, a long-serving director of the Bank of England with much influence in defining its developing functions; he acted as its governor in 1887&#150;9. Norman began work at his father's bank in 1892, moving two years later to his Collet grandfather's firm. In 1895 he was sent to complete his training with its partners, Brown Brothers of New York. Over the next four years he learned much about Anglo-American financial relationships and American commerce and industry, travelled to many parts of the United States, and acquired important friends&#151;knowledge and friendships renewed and expanded by frequent visits in later life. Norman's family traditions also included admiration for the army: he joined the 4th Bedfordshire and Hertfordshire militia in 1894, returned annually from the USA for its training camps, and was promoted captain. He served with distinction in the South African War in 1900&#150;01, earning the DSO before being invalided home with persistent gastritis. Confidence in exercising leadership under stress had been added to an extensive financial apprenticeship.<br>
<br>Appointed a Brown Shipley partner before he left for South Africa in 1900, on his return to England, Norman soon became its most energetic member. He revealed great skills in assessing financial propositions, expanded the area of the bank's acceptance business, and acquired a close understanding of the bill and exchange markets. His tenacious grasp of orthodox banking principles led, however, to disagreement with partners seeking to diversify the business in what he considered an unsound manner. This, together with an absorption which fostered overwork, aggravated nervous troubles he had suffered periodically since childhood and undermined his health. From 1911 to 1913 he was unable to work, and he suffered further distress when the Z&uuml;rich psychiatrist Carl Jung bizarrely misdiagnosed his condition as general paralysis of the insane (a late consequence of syphilis), and he was given only months to live  (Boyle, 90&#150;95).<br>
<br>During this period Norman drifted apart from his Brown Shipley partners, but the First World War presented alternative activities as adviser to various government departments on financial censorship and blockade, and especially at the Bank of England. As early as 1907 his qualities had been recognized by election to its court of directors; now, his American expertise was invaluable in the bank's tasks of war finance and exchange control. In December 1915 he finally retired from Brown Shipley and became assistant to the bank's deputy governor. He was soon appointed to its policy-making body, the committee of treasury, and was much involved in the sterling&#150;dollar exchange crises of 1916&#150;17 and the 1917 dispute over the powers of the governor, Walter Cunliffe. He was elected deputy governor in late 1917 and governor in 1920.<br>
<br>Norman's governorship was frequently renewed, to become the longest in the Bank of England's history. It was also the most controversial, as the effort to cope with immense post-war difficulties increased the impact and public awareness of the bank's activities. He understood the extent to which the British economy depended not just on international trade and services but also on international systems of payment which the war had dislocated and which remained distorted by war debts and reparations. Consequently he believed that the re-creation of an international monetary system based on the pre-war gold standard and the revival of the international capital market would provide the necessary framework for industrial prosperity, high employment, and social progress, and should therefore take priority over other economic claims. Working closely with the League of Nations financial committee and European and American bankers, he was prominent in successive efforts to revise, and arrange the smooth transfer of, German reparations, which led to the Dawes plan of 1924 and the Young plan of 1929. In the early 1920s he also helped orchestrate, where necessary with the aid of Bank of England loans, the re-establishment of sound currencies and central banks in much of central Europe. This experience was later applied to the establishment of central banks in the dominions, and to advising upon recurrent problems of Indian finance. By the mid-1920s Norman was the accepted international authority on central banking practice. One of his leading principles was that monetary and banking matters should be conducted independently of governments, ever prone to sacrifice long-term interests to political pressures and national rivalries. This was also an important feature in domestic stabilization. Contrary to Bank of England advice, in 1919 the coalition government suspended the gold standard and thereby allowed wartime levels of inflation and public expenditure to continue. But after the brief but alarming post-war boom of 1919&#150;20, the bank and Treasury were allowed to reimpose financial disciplines and to work towards restoring the gold standard, with its supposed &#145;automatic&#146; mechanisms for economic adjustment under autonomous Bank of England supervision. Norman accompanied the chancellor of the exchequer, Stanley Baldwin, at the Washington negotiations in 1923 which arranged the funding of the British war debt to the United States and helped clear the way to stabilizing the pound against the dollar. Conservative ministers and Treasury officials finally sanctioned restoration of the gold standard at the pre-war parity in April 1925.<br>
<br>This decision was famously criticized by J. M. Keynes, and as the British economy failed to recover significantly in the later 1920s a belief that sterling had been overvalued, unnecessarily imposing a damaging burden of high interest rates, became one of the propellants of the Keynesian revolution. Norman himself came to be regarded as bearing much of the responsibility for the inter-war mass unemployment, by putting the interests of the financial sector before those of manufacturing industry. He was sometimes represented as an archetype of the arrogance of irresponsible power, as not just misguided but dictatorial, reactionary, insensitive, and mysterious in ways linked to his supposed psychological instability. Later opening of the archives went some way towards qualifying such interpretations. For most of the 1920s the objectives of &#145;sound money&#146; were supported by almost all political leaders, irrespective of party. Norman certainly dominated the bank, but he proceeded more collectively and upon wider advice and information than his predecessors. Always careful to consult his fellow directors, he implemented organizational reforms, creating a properly professional senior staff and from 1928 appointing expert economic, industrial, and foreign advisers; internal debate was encouraged, and he did not always prevail in the committee of treasury. Himself aware that the restored gold standard was not producing all the expected benefits, he presided over major innovations in practice and policy. Seeking to neutralize the effect of what were believed to be abnormal international money flows, he promoted close co-operation between the major central banks, building upon his already good relations with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. When, with Norman's support, the Bank for International Settlements was formed in 1930 under the Young plan, he hoped it would provide a forum for even closer co-ordination. In defending sterling, the Bank of England also devised techniques which minimized the use of high bank rate and credit restriction; by 1928 Norman was writing of &#145;a more or less managed Currency&#146;  (Clay, 310). As the manager of the now huge government debt and through informal control of capital issues, the bank's supervision of the money markets and financial institutions was greatly extended. Norman became the father confessor to the City, accumulating unrivalled knowledge of its many activities and offering advice which individuals and institutions generally thought it best to accept. From the late 1920s the difficulties of basic industries&#151;and a desire to forestall Labour Party demands for nationalization&#151;drew him into mobilizing the City to help finance industrial rationalization, creating the Securities Management Trust (1929) and the Bankers' Industrial Development Company (1930), which initiated and supervised large-scale restructuring in the cotton, engineering, iron and steel, and shipbuilding industries. Norman even tried to boost consumer demand, encouraging the development of institutions to finance hire purchase. Nevertheless, the attempt to reimpose the pre-war gold standard upon transformed post-war conditions proved to be mistaken, with Norman and the Treasury underestimating the financial nationalism of other central banks and overestimating the flexibility of British industry and wage-levels.<br>
<br>Norman's influence owed something to an impressive presence. Tall, with a broad forehead and pointed beard, wearing his hat at a rakish angle, and seductively courteous, he reminded some of a Spanish grandee. His real power lay in tremendous grasp of complex detail, feel for the mood of the financial markets, and skilful deployment of his information and the authority of his office. Secretiveness&#151;characterized by his occasional use of &#145;Mr Skinner&#146;, his secretary's name&#151;seemed prudent to a man bearing so many secrets, and whose very movements might affect market behaviour. His understanding and powers of exposition should not be judged solely by a calamitous appearance before the (Macmillan) committee on finance and industry (1929&#150;31), when defensiveness before his chief critics, Keynes's deployment of a newly minted theoretical model&#151;so alien to Norman's concrete and intuitive thinking&#151;and refusal to accept largely monetary explanations for unemployment, reduced him to monosyllables and silent gestures. Nor is it surprising that as governor he suffered one or two further nervous collapses: he bore great responsibilities and heavy workloads for a longer period than any other modern public figure.<br>
<br>The burdens increased sharply from 1928, when the American stock market boom threatened the sterling exchange. The 1929 Wall Street crash and the growing effects of the world depression then disrupted the work of industrial rationalization, required rescues of important financial and commercial institutions, and destabilized the international monetary system. In early 1931 Norman sponsored an impressive plan for international reflation, but it met insurmountable American and French opposition. From May there were central European banking collapses, which he struggled to contain by arranging loans to Austria and standstill agreements on funds lent to Germany. But a European liquidity crisis had begun, which from mid-July focused upon London. Since late 1930 Norman had been aware of declining foreign confidence in sterling, and he warned Labour ministers of the damaging impression created by an unbalanced government budget. Now he undertook defensive measures in co-operation with the American and French central banks, while looking to the (May) report on national expenditure to persuade the British politicians to act. But in late July the strain broke his health, and during a long convalescent visit to Canada the emergency National Government was unable to keep sterling on the gold standard.<br>
<br>The remarkable, but patchy, recovery of the British economy between 1932 and 1937, once free trade and the high interest rates required under the gold standard had been abandoned, helped to undermine public confidence in the orthodoxies which Norman had championed; and as the Treasury became partners in the conduct of monetary policy the Bank of England's traditional independence was reduced. But despite the collapse of much of Norman's earlier work, his knowledge and experience still seemed invaluable. He remained prominent in industrial restructuring and helped repair the damage to some City institutions and to central European finance. During 1932 the establishment of the Exchange Equalisation Account enabled the sterling exchanges to be stabilized, and the long-planned conversion of war loan brought cheap money. After the 1933 World Economic Conference failed to agree upon a new international monetary regime, Norman accepted the informal creation of a sterling area and encouraged negotiations which in 1936 produced the tripartite monetary agreement for co-operation with the Americans and French. As the European diplomatic crisis unfolded in the late 1930s, he was principally responsible for preparing the battery of controls which ensured that the outbreak of war did not bring the financial chaos experienced in 1914. From 1939 his advice helped prevent wartime inflation, and during 1943 he began organizing City support for post-war industrial reconstruction. But in early 1944 illness forced his retirement. A privy councillor since 1923, he now accepted a peerage (having declined one twenty years earlier), and became Baron Norman of St Clere.<br>
<br>In 1933 Norman married Priscilla Cecilia Maria, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Reyntiens (1899&#150;1991), the divorced wife of Alexander Koch Worsthorne. A London county councillor from 1925 to 1933, after Norman's death she became chairman of the National Association for Mental Health, and was made CBE in 1963. Her two sons&#151;Norman's stepsons&#151;were Simon Towneley (surname adopted by royal licence, 1955), appointed lord lieutenant of Lancashire in 1976, and Sir Peregrine Worsthorne, editor of the <span class="italic">Sunday Telegraph</span> and writer. Norman himself had no children, and his peerage became extinct when, after a stroke, he died at his home, Thorpe Lodge, Campden Hill, London, on 4 February 1950.<br>
