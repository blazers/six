<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Rymsdyk,  Jan  van</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1790), <span class="occ">artist</span>, was born in the Netherlands. Of his parents, nothing is known. He contributed to the great English obstetric atlases of the eighteenth century and was particularly active as an anatomical illustrator in London in the 1750s, working primarily in red chalk and pastels. By 1750 Rymsdyk was in London providing drawings (Hunterian collection, Glasgow University Library) for the plates to William Hunter's <span class="italic">The Anatomy of the Gravid Uterus</span>, eventually published in 1774.<br>
<br>Familiar with his work for Hunter, William Smellie employed Rymsdyk to contribute preparatory drawings to his <span class="italic">A Sett of Anatomical Tables</span>, illustrated with life-size obstetric plates. The book is dated 1754 but did not appear until the following year. Most of Rymsdyk's drawings for Smellie were completed by 1752 and were later purchased by Hunter in Smellie's posthumous sale on 29 June 1770 (Hunterian collection, Glasgow University Library). Rymsdyk's portrait of Smellie is known only from the print after it by Charles Grignion.<br>
<br>Rymsdyk was also employed by John Hunter, William's brother. All of the illustrations to <span class="italic">The natural history of the human teeth: explaining their structure, use, formation, growth, and diseases</span> were drawn by Rymsdyk &#145;under the Author's direction&#146;. Although published in London 1771, the book is based on work done by Hunter before 1755, and some of Rymsdyk's preparatory drawings, in the library of the Royal College of Surgeons, London, bear this date. Rymsdyk's exceptionally attractive red-chalk drawings of the entire skull for the book were truncated in the finished plates, since only the teeth and jaw area were of relevance.<br>
<br>Rymsdyk's reputation as an anatomical draughtsman brought him to the attention of Charles Nicholas Jenty. Rymsdyk provided drawings for the mezzotint illustrations to Jenty's <span class="italic">An Essay on the Demonstration of the Human Structure</span> (1757). In Jenty's opinion:<blockquote>none imitated Nature better than Mr. Van Riemsdyk; who &hellip; has been for some Time employed by the Doctors Smellie and Hunter in Pieces of Midwifery, &amp;c. and is well known to be the ablest Person we have in London, in anatomical Performances. (pp. 6&#150;7)</blockquote>In the same year, six life-size mezzotint plates to Jenty's <span class="italic">The Demonstrations of a Pregnant Uterus of a Woman at her Full Time</span> were published. These are described in the title as &#145;Done from the pictures painted, after dissections, by Mr Van Riemsdyk&#146;, although the first plate bears the signature of Thomas Burgess. Pastel drawings by Rymsdyk for Jenty, one dated 1755, were sent to the Pennsylvania Hospital, Philadelphia, by John Fothergill for teaching purposes, arriving in 1762.<br>
<br>Despite his success in this genre, it is known from Rymsdyk's later comments in his <span class="italic">Museum Britannicum</span> of 1778 that he felt that his talents as an artist had not been properly recognized. In 1758 he sought a change in career and moved to Bristol, where he advertised himself as a portrait painter and a drawing teacher in <span class="italic">Felix Farley's Bristol Journal</span> (16 December 1758). Some of his subsequent sitters belonged to the Bristol medical community. Richard Smith recorded one such portrait of the surgeon John Page (1713&#150;1792), now in the boardroom of the Bristol Royal Infirmary  (&#145;Bristol Infirmary biographical memoirs&#146;, 2.190). Rymsdyk failed to achieve financial success in Bristol and is described by Smith as being reduced to wearing the cast-off clothing of William Barrett, man-midwife and local historian  (ibid.). A portrait of Barrett attributed to Rymsdyk (<i>c</i>.1764) is in the Bristol Museum and Art Gallery.<br>
<br>By 1764 Rymsdyk had returned to London, where he was residing at Wych Street, Drury Lane, with his son <a href="#cosubject_28099">Andrew [<i>see below</i>]</a>, and was again in the employ of William Hunter as an anatomical draughtsman. On 16 July 1772 Rymsdyk first obtained permission from the British Museum for access to the exhibits to make drawings  (Add. MS 45869, fol. 49<i>v</i>). In 1778 the <span class="italic">Museum Britannicum, being an exhibition of a great variety of antiquities and natural curiosities</span> was published, illustrated with prints after drawings by Rymsdyk and his son Andrew of a selection of objects in the British Museum. A second edition appeared posthumously in 1791. The text is by Jan van Rymsdyk and the extensive annotations frequently reveal his wide range of interests as well as a difficult and petulant character. There are several references to what he considered his lost career as a painter and his lengthy servitude to those who did not fully appreciate him, an allusion to William Hunter. The preparatory drawings, mainly in delicate coloured wash, are in the British Museum print room. The book, according to a supplementary obituary notice of Andrew van Rymsdyk, was not a financial success  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 1145). Jan van Rymsdyk's last works were drawings for Thomas Denman's <span class="italic">A collection of engravings, tending to illustrate the generation and parturition of animals, and of the human species</span> (1787) and an <span class="italic">Introduction to the Practice of Midwifery</span> (1801).<br>
<br>Further anatomical, pathological, and natural history drawings and pastels by Rymsdyk are in the Royal College of Surgeons, London, the British Museum, and the Hunterian collection, University of Glasgow, including those for illustrations to papers in the journal <span class="italic">Medical Observations and Inquiries</span>. Few of his prints survive. He contributed only one engraved figure to Hunter's <span class="italic">Gravid Uterus</span> and one plate to the <span class="italic">Museum Britannicum</span>, preferring instead to hire engravers for the latter book for which he advertised in the <span class="italic">Daily Advertiser</span> (20 September 1775). Rymsdyk was also a collector of old-master drawings, those that he owned identifiable by the mark &#145;Rymsdyk's Museum&#146;. These are now in various collections, including the British Museum.<br>
<br>Rymsdyk had two sons, <a name="cosubject_28099"></a><span class="headword">Andrew  van Rymsdyk</span>  (1753/4&#150;1786)<span class="occ"></span> and John (<i>fl</i>. 1778&#150;1790). At the age of eleven, in 1765, Andrew (or Andries) was awarded a premium prize for drawing from the Society of Arts, and again in 1766 and 1767. He exhibited at the Society of Arts (1769, 1776) and the Royal Academy of Art, London (1775), and contributed drawings to the <span class="italic">Museum Britannicum</span>. In the 1780s he advertised as a miniature painter (misleadingly claiming to be a member of the Royal Academy) in the local press of Norwich, Chester, and Bath, where he died on 13 November 1786. Miniatures by him, <span class="italic">The Seventh Earl of Athlone</span> (1783) and <span class="italic">Sarah Siddons</span> (1783), are in the National Gallery of Ireland, and two miniatures of unidentified sitters, male and female, are in the Victoria and Albert Museum, the latter signed and dated 1780. The &#145;Rymsdyk Jr.&#146; who exhibited two enamels at the Royal Academy in 1778 has been identified as Andrew but is more likely to have been his brother, John van Rymsdyk, who is mentioned in his father's will of 1790.<br>
<br>By 1775 Jan van Rymsdyk had moved to Charles Street, off St James's Square, London, and this is where he was resident with his sister, Maria, and second son, John, when he drew up his will on 14 February 1790. He died there shortly afterwards, on 20 February 1790.<br>
