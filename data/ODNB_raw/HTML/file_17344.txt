<span class="headword">Macaulay <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Sawbridge; <em>other married name </em>Graham]</span>,  Catharine</span>  (1731&#150;1791), <span class="occ">historian and political polemicist</span>, was born on 2 April 1731 at Olantigh in the parish of Wye, Kent, second daughter of John Sawbridge (1699&#150;1762), landowner, and his second wife, Dorothy Wanley (1713&#150;1733), daughter of London banker George Wanley of Tottenham, Middlesex. As well as her elder sister, Mary, she had two brothers, Wanley and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/24750/', "John Sawbridge")</script>, who made a name for himself in radical politics.<h2>
<a name="Familyandeducation"></a>Family and education</h2>The family's origins were among Warwickshire yeomanry, and when some of the family moved south in the early seventeenth century one branch gravitated towards Kent. Catharine's great-grandfather Isaac Sawbridge was in business in London and her grandfather Jacob, banker and stockbroker, was born in Canterbury. The Sawbridge family had already acquired some notoriety long before Catharine Macaulay was born, when Jacob Sawbridge became involved in the South Sea Bubble. Believing that an extension of credit was essential to the prosperity of the country, and resenting the monopoly position enjoyed by the Bank of England and its close relation to government, Jacob and his partners, &#145;the three capital sharpers of Britain&#146;, as Defoe called them, set out to exploit the South Sea scheme. When the crash came Sawbridge was deeply implicated. Despite the expropriation of a large part of his assets, he nevertheless managed to emerge a rich man. When half a century later Catharine Macaulay sought to vindicate her grandfather's memory, she argued that many from both houses of parliament were involved but managed to escape all punishment, and that Sawbridge was merely the unfortunate scapegoat.<br>
<br>Family fortunes, however, did not suffer long as Catharine's father was fortunate in marrying as his second wife an heiress, Dorothy Wanley, on 21 November 1728 at All Hallows, Tottenham. On Dorothy's death in childbirth in 1733 he inherited her fortune, which he used to improve the family estate at Olantigh. Devastated by his wife's death, Sawbridge tended to cut himself off from society, and played little part in his daughters' education. In consequence Catharine had much time to herself. She and her sister were privately educated, and were left in the care of an antiquated and ignorant governess. Some have suggested her education was the result of daily foraging in her father's well-stocked library. Others insist her education was &#145;by no means distinguished from that of other young ladies of the same rank&#146;  (<span class="italic">European Magazine and London Review</span>, 4, 1783, 330). What is certain is that Catharine was a prolific reader, particularly in her twenties. She read Greek and Roman history, probably in translation, and later claimed that this had been the source of her republicanism and the inspiration to her turning historian. Her upbringing without parental direction was undoubtedly lonely and may well have made for a &#145;wayward, headstrong, young woman&#146; but it gave her a rare independence and intellectual self-sufficiency  (Peach, 117n.). Elizabeth Carter, meeting her in 1757 at a Canterbury assembly, was impressed by this &#145;fine, fashionable, well-dressed lady whose train was longer than anybody's train&#146; and who &#145;took her mightily by way of conversation&#146;  (<span class="italic">Series of Letters</span>, 2.260&#150;61).<h2>
<a name="MarriagetheHistoryandpolitics"></a>Marriage, the History, and politics</h2>On 18 June 1760, at Wye, Kent, Catharine married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/73550/', "Dr George Macaulay (1716&#150;1766)")</script>, a man-midwife, son of Archibald Macaulay (<i>c</i>.1686&#150;1760), sometime lord provost of Edinburgh, and his wife, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/65572/', "Carola Macaulay, n&#233;e Young (b. 1682)")</script>, milliner. He had been physician of the British Lying-in Hospital at Brownlow Street since 1751. Richard Baron was a close friend and he and Thomas Hollis were regular visitors at the Macaulays' house in Jermyn Street. Baron described George Macaulay as &#145;a most worthy and benevolent man&#146;  (<span class="italic">Diary of Sylas Neville</span>, 20). From all accounts the marriage was a happy one. Baron was fascinated and more than a little frightened by Catharine Macaulay. He described her as &#145;quite a phenomenon&#151;a woman without passions&#146;, and thought her face &#145;as abstract as the print of Mr Locke&#146;  (Hollis, diary, entries for 6 and 13 Dec 1766). On 16 September 1766 George Macaulay died, aged forty-nine, leaving his widow with their only child, Catherine Sophia.<br>
<br>It was in the brief period of her first marriage that Catharine Macaulay embarked on her eight-volume <span class="italic">History of England</span>. For a woman to have conceived of such a project in the eighteenth century was extraordinary. That her husband actively encouraged her was equally remarkable. When her first volume was published in 1763 it was greeted with acclaim. Overnight she became &#145;the celebrated Mrs Macaulay&#146;. But behind the praise she received there was condescension and the belief that the writing of history was not for women. On her first volume, for instance, the <span class="italic">Monthly Review</span> concentrated not on the nature of the history but on the fact that she was a woman. She was referred to as &#145;the fair Macaulay&#146;, &#145;our fair Historian&#146;. After mild praise the <span class="italic">Review</span> expressed the wish that &#145;the same degree of genius and application had been exerted <i>in more suitable pursuits</i>&#146;, for the writing of history was not recommended &#145;to the practice of our lovely countrywomen&#146;  (<span class="italic">Monthly Review</span>, 29, 1763, 373).<br>
<br>The whigs welcomed the first volumes as a timely answer to what was seen as David Hume's tory interpretation of events. As the <span class="italic">History</span> proceeded, however, it became increasingly clear that Macaulay was no mere whig. It was when she reached her fourth volume in 1768, that dealt with the trial and execution of Charles I, that the gulf between her views and those of the whigs was revealed. It was in this volume that she talked for the first time of &#145;the rise of the republicans&#146; who &#145;looked forward to the reformation of the principles, as well as the executive, of the government&#146;  (C. Macaulay, <span class="italic">History of England</span>, 4.160). The Commonwealth she saw as &#145;the brightest age that ever adorned the page of history&#146;  (ibid., 5.382). For her the events of the seventeenth century remained vividly alive, and they were in the process of being re-enacted in the present. Such views caused the Rockingham whigs to virtually abandon her, and such freely expressed republican ideas were an increasing embarrassment, as was her warmly expressed sympathy with the American colonists.<br>
<br>Catharine Macaulay further expounded her political views in two polemical pamphlets, <span class="italic">Loose remarks on certain positions to be found in Mr Hobbes's &#145;Philosophical rudiments of government and society&#146;</span> (1767) and <span class="italic">Observations on a pamphlet entitled &#145;Thoughts on the cause of the present discontents&#146;</span> (1770). Her <span class="italic">Observations</span> threw into relief her differences with the Rockingham whigs and emphasized her own startlingly radical politics. Burke and Macaulay differed fundamentally in their views of the causes of the political corruption which both believed threatened liberty. Burke believed in the perfection of the constitution established by the revolution settlement of 1688&#150;9 and thought that the causes of the &#145;present discontents&#146; lay in the recent resurgence of the power of the crown from which only strong and principled government of the Rockingham whigs could save the country. Macaulay thought that the revolution settlement itself had been the work of those who called themselves whigs but were in reality the &#145;enemies of public liberty&#146;  (Macaulay, <span class="italic">Observations</span>, 6&#150;7, 10&#150;11) and had diverted the revolution from its original radical course. Her proposed cures involved reactivating their radical programme by introducing shorter parliaments, a system of rotation of office, a place bill, and a more extended and equal power of election. For Americans the pamphlets had the effect of undermining their earlier conviction that the British constitution was the very best form of government and helped them to abandon constitutional monarchy as a model for a free government.<br>
<br>In this period Catharine Macaulay moved in at least two social circles in London. The first had originally been formed around John Wilkes and the Society of the Supporters of the Bill of Rights. Her brother John Sawbridge played a central role in the campaign organized by London radicals on Wilkes's behalf and for a time Catharine Macaulay frequently entertained John Wilkes and his daughter Polly. The second circle was a group of dissenters who tended to share her republican views, namely Thomas and Timothy Hollis, Richard Baron, and Sylas Neville. The growing hostility of the Rockingham whigs, combined with the criticisms levelled at the <span class="italic">History</span>, may have contributed to her decision to leave London for Bath in 1774 to improve her health that had been badly affected by the effort of completing volume 5 of the <span class="italic">History</span>.<h2>
<a name="Macaulaysclaimtoscholarship"></a>Macaulay's claim to scholarship</h2>Catharine Macaulay's <span class="italic">History</span> has been attacked as a &#145;masterly example of how not to write history&#146; and it has been claimed that she was no scholar  (Peardon, 60). But research into the contents of her library, revealed by her <span class="italic">Catalogue of Tracts</span> of 1790, and careful examination of the sources she used in her <span class="italic">History</span> reveal a meticulous scholar. The <span class="italic">Catalogue of Tracts</span> (her purpose in publishing the catalogue remains obscure) consisted of 200 pages listing nearly 5000 tracts and sermons, mostly from the seventeenth century. Its range of tracts from the period 1640&#150;50 is remarkable&#151;even by present standards. She made good use of manuscripts in her <span class="italic">History</span> (seven are referred to in volume 1 alone). If it had not been for her public expressing impatience with the footnotes in her early volumes we might have had even more evidence of the sources she used and the care she took over them. The <span class="italic">Monthly Review</span> in assessing her first volume described it as &#145;collecting and digesting the political fragments which have escaped the researches of so many learned and ingenious men&#146;  (<span class="italic">Monthly Review</span>, 29, 1763, 373). It also suggests her originality in using sources others had passed over. She made extensive use of the <span class="italic">Parliamentary History</span>, and made constant reference to standard works such as Rushworth, Clarendon, Burnet, Ludlow, the state papers of John Thurloe, <span class="italic">Commons Journals</span>, Carte, and Whitelocke. She frequently cited Clarendon and Hume with whom she fundamentally disagreed, and her work reveals a familiarity with other historians, her friend William Harris, Rapin-Thoyras, James Ralph, and William Guthrie. It is no longer possible to dismiss her <span class="italic">History</span> as &#145;the clumsy old volumes&#146;&#151;as Lucy Donnelly described it. Remarkably, given the frequency with which her first four volumes appeared, no further volumes of the <span class="italic">History</span> were published during the following four years. She may well have found it difficult to resume without the facilities she enjoyed in London. Instead she produced in 1778 one volume of <span class="italic">The history of England from the revolution to the present time in a series of letters to a friend [the Revd Thomas Wilson]</span>.<br>
<br>On arriving in Bath, Catharine Macaulay had taken a house in St James's Parade. She had been a widow for eight years and her daughter was still a child. She must have missed the social life of London and the involvement in London politics. Without the British Museum it was more difficult to work on her <span class="italic">History</span>. It was in these circumstances that the offer of a former acquaintance, an elderly member of the Society of the Supporters of the Bill of Rights, the Revd Thomas Wilson (1703&#150;1784), a friend of both Wilkes and her brother, to share his house in Bath was irresistible. She was promised the free run of his library. She and her daughter were soon settled into Alfred House. Wilson at the time was seventy-three, a widower, and a lonely man much in need of company. He was reputed to give generously to charity but he was well able to afford it. His generosity extended to Catharine Macaulay. Shortly after her arrival in Alfred House, David Hume wrote to Hugh Blair:<blockquote>There is one Dr. Wilson, a man zealous for Liberty, who has made her a free and full Present of a house of &pound;2,000 Value, has adopted her Daughter by all the Rites of Roman Jurisprudence, and intends to leave her all his Fortune, which is considerable. (<span class="italic">Letters of David Hume</span>, 2.321)</blockquote>A cultured man, Wilson had an extensive library and was something of a book collector. He was a fervent Wilkite and remained loyal to Wilkes until his death.<br>
<br>Catharine Macaulay's decision to move into Alfred House proved a serious mistake. Wilson, increasingly senile, was clearly besotted with her. To celebrate her forty-sixth birthday, he seated her on a throne, so that she could attend to six odes of little poetic merit, written in her honour, and numerous adulatory addresses. The occasion did little to enhance her reputation. For all Wilson's devotion, her residence at Alfred House was not a happy one, and her health suffered.<br>
<br>In 1777 for reasons of health Macaulay decided to make a visit to Nice. Constant illness meant she got no further than Paris. There she began to recover her strength and eventually to entertain a very select group&#151;the chevalier de Rigemont, the abb&eacute; de Colbert, the duc de Harcourt, the ducs de La Rochefoucauld-Liancourt, and the count of Sarsfield, as well as Madame Bocage and Madame Geoffrin. She was clearly gratified by her reception and the attentions of the great. Turgot, on asking her whether she wished to see Versailles, was told: &#145;I have no desire to see the residence of tyrants&#146;  (<span class="italic">M&eacute;moires de Brissot</span>, 2.237). No doubt for reasons of security she was very careful in her relations with Benjamin Franklin, the American envoy, and did not entertain him. Throughout her visit she was constantly made aware of the excitement generated by the American War of Independence.<h2>
<a name="ThesecondmarriageandcompletionoftheHistory"></a>The second marriage and completion of the History</h2>On 19 December 1778, less than two years after moving in to Alfred House, Catharine Macaulay announced her marriage, to William Graham, a mate to a ship's surgeon, aged twenty-one. The scandal that followed was due less to her marrying beneath her and the discrepancy between the ages of bride and bridegroom than to the rumours of an earlier sexual liaison with Dr Graham, her new husband's brother. A celebrated quack doctor, he had recently moved to Bath and begun to treat Catharine Macaulay, who recommended him to her friends. Her second marriage and the ensuing scandal fatally damaged her reputation. From being the focus of public interest she passed into relative obscurity. Of the last thirteen years of her life very little is known.<br>
<br>Despite predictions that her second marriage would end Catharine Macaulay's career as historian, the <span class="italic">History</span> continued&#151;two more volumes appeared in 1781 and the eighth and final volume in 1783. It was also predicted that the marriage would not last. It did, and to all appearances proved a happy one. In 1784 with her second husband she left for a visit to America of nearly a year. Already she and her <span class="italic">History</span> were well known in America. Among ideas that had influenced the course of the American War of Independence her <span class="italic">History</span> played a significant role. Through it she had become acquainted with Benjamin Franklin, Josiah Quincy, Benjamin Rush, Richard Henry Lee, John Adams, Ezra Styles, and Jonathan Mayhew, many of whom had come to Britain, where the Club of Honest Whigs welcomed them. Catharine Macaulay had frequently entertained them. On reaching America her first visit was to Mercy Otis Warren, wife of James Warren and sister of James Otis. With Mercy she had much in common. Indeed, it may have been Catharine Macaulay's influence that persuaded Mercy to become a historian. She went briefly to New York and met Richard Henry Lee who at this time was president of the continental congress. She spent ten days with the Washingtons at Mount Vernon. She continued to correspond with her many friends in America after she had returned to Britain.<h2>
<a name="Finalworksanddeath"></a>Final works and death</h2>Ill health had dogged Catharine Macaulay's visit to America and on her return she went straight to the south of France in an effort to find a cure. When four years later news of the French Revolution reached England she was jubilant. The American War of Independence, she was convinced, had been its inspiration. In 1790 she published <span class="italic">Letters on Education</span>. It covered a wide range of ideas. She was in favour of co-education and called on parents to reject &#145;the absurd notion, that the education of females should be of an opposite kind to that of males&#146;  (C. Macaulay, <span class="italic">Letters on Education</span>, 1790, 47). She expressed enlightened views on the upbringing of children. Children, she wrote, should be fed on fruit, eggs, and vegetables, and only very occasionally should be given meat. Sugar was bad for the teeth. They should be encouraged to wash regularly. It was a mistake to use baby talk in addressing them. She also argued passionately against capital punishment, and declared that if there had to be executions they should not be public events. She also argued in favour of reform of penal law and the abolition of slavery, decrying the deplorable &#145;treatment given by some of our countrymen to their African slaves&#146;  (ibid.).<br>
<br>On the position of women, Macaulay argued that if it was better than it had been under slavery, &#145;we &hellip; have no great reason to boast of our privileges, or of the candour and indulgence of the men towards us&#146;  (Macaulay, <span class="italic">Letters on Education</span>, 210). She criticized women for their passive acceptance of the claimed natural superiority of men. Women's weaknesses were the result of &#145;situation and education only&#146;. The education of women was an essential ingredient to a happy marriage. She was under no illusion about the operation of the sexual double standard in eighteenth-century society. The reason for the very different attitudes adopted towards any &#145;deviations from chastity in the two sexes&#146;, was, she thought, the result of men treating women as their property and women being denied any rights over &#145;their own persons&#146;  (p. 220). But while Catharine Macaulay was clearly sympathetic to the condition of her sex, it was not a priority in her thought. Neither in her <span class="italic">History</span> nor in her political polemic do women occupy a place and she was not really concerned with the state of women's political representation. Until women were better educated, she thought, there was no hope of achieving political equality.<br>
<br>In 1790 Catharine Macaulay also published an impassioned response to Burke's <span class="italic">Reflections on the Revolution in France</span> (1790). This gave rise to a brief correspondence between her and Mary Wollstonecraft, in which both praised the other's work. Her answer to Burke raised once again their very different interpretations of the revolution of 1688 and what, if anything, it had achieved.<br>
<br>Recurring ill health forced Catharine Macaulay out of London to Binfield in Berkshire, where she died on 22 June 1791 &#145;after a long and very painful illness&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>). She was a remarkable woman. No other woman before her had written history of the kind that she wrote. Though not strictly a feminist she always behaved as though equality between the sexes already existed. She refused to go out of the room with the ladies after dining in mixed company. When she visited the British Museum while writing her earlier volumes, she asked to see the letters exchanged between James I and the duke of Buckingham. The librarian, &#145;observing that many of them were wholly unfit for the inspection of any one of her sex&#146;, asked that he might be allowed to select a few. &#145;Phoo&#146;, said she, &#145;a historian is of no sex&#146;, and then deliberately read through them all  (Taylor, 1.209).<br>
