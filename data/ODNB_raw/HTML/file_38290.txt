<span class="headword">Bayes,  Gilbert</span>  (1872&#150;1953), <span class="occ">sculptor</span>, was born on 4 April 1872 at 6 Oval Road, Gloucester Road, St John's Wood, London, the third of four children of Alfred Walter Bayes (1832&#150;1909), a painter and etcher, and his wife, Emily Ann 
    (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Fielden; <i>fl</i>. <i>c</i>.1840&#150;<i>c</i>.1910)
  . He was the brother of the painters Walter Bayes (1869&#150;1956) and Jessie Bayes (1878&#150;1970). He studied at Finsbury Technical College (1891&#150;6) and at the Royal Academy Schools (1896&#150;9). In 1899 he won the Royal Academy gold medal and travelling scholarship. Most of his overseas study was spent in Paris, where his bronze relief <span class="italic">Jason Ploughing the Acre of Mars</span> (1900; Robert McDougall Art Gallery, Christchurch, New Zealand) won an honourable mention at the Universal Exposition (1900). In 1906 he married the artist Gertrude Smith (<i>c</i>.1875&#150;1952); they had two children.<br>
<br>Bayes's early works are mainly reliefs and statuettes, often equestrian, inspired by classical, medieval, and Nordic mythology (for example, the bronze <span class="italic">Sigurd</span>, 1910; Tate collection). From the outset, he showed remarkable versatility, designing such objects as chessmen, caskets, cabinets, mirrors, medals, statuettes, trophies, and portrait busts. Before 1914 his work formed part of the New Sculpture movement, and reflected the influence of George Frampton and Alfred Gilbert. Like Frampton, Bayes experimented with the decorative and expressive potential of colour, and frequently applied mosaics, enamels, and glazes to his sculpture. In the earliest major article on Bayes (1902), Walter Shaw Sparrow admired his &#145;artistic gaiety and lightness of touch&#146;, adding that his work &#145;is certainly never dull, it never bores you&#146;  (Sparrow, 11&#150;12).<br>
<br>In both his versatility and his careful craftsmanship, Bayes upheld the ideals of the arts and crafts movement and he also had a strong social conscience, without adopting socialism like many of its proponents. In 1945 he declared, &#145;It is up to the artist to serve the community and deserve well of it, not to make feeble things that won't function&#146;  (Irvine and Atterbury, 18). At the same time, he deplored the increasing divergence between the crafts and fine arts. He was elected a member of the Art-Workers' Guild in 1896 and master in 1925. His performances at the guild's theatrical masques and revels won widespread praise.<br>
<br>Bayes began to enjoy national prominence as a sculptor with his First World War memorials. These revealed a tendency towards elegantly stylized, geometrical art deco forms (for example, Hythe war memorial, Kent, 1921), which developed further in the reliefs for the Pavilion of Concrete Utilities Bureau at the 1924 British Empire Exhibition, Wembley (Portmeirion, Wales). His success in the art deco style was reflected in the gold medal he received at the 1925 Exposition International des Arts D&eacute;coratifs et Industriels Modernes, Paris. The simplified, archaic qualities of his distinctive, double-sided reliefs (for example, <span class="italic">The Lure of the Pipes of Pan</span>, 1932; artificial stone, Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery) have affinities with works by his younger contemporaries, such as Ivan Me&#353;trovi&#263; and Paul Manship. Like them, Bayes never rejected his academic training and his work continued to make historical references, evident in the early Renaissance flavour of the Royal Doulton stoneware panel <span class="italic">Madonna and Child</span> (1924). His two large outdoor equestrian bronzes, <span class="italic">Offerings of War</span> and <span class="italic">Offerings of Peace</span> (1918&#150;26; Art Gallery of New South Wales, Sydney), owe much to the French nineteenth-century sculptor Emmanuel Fremiet.<br>
<br>During the inter-war years Bayes eagerly experimented with modern materials. These included Doulton's polychrome stoneware, which was used for many garden sculptures. The most important and ambitious work in this medium was <span class="italic">History of Pottery through the Ages</span> (1939), the frieze for Doulton House, Lambeth Embankment, London, subsequently acquired by the Victoria and Albert Museum when the building was demolished. Bayes also used &#145;artificial stone&#146; or pre-cast concrete, in the large-scale relief <span class="italic">History of Drama through the Ages</span> for the Saville Theatre (now MGM cinema), Shaftesbury Avenue, London (1930). His architectural collaboration with T. P. Bennett in this work and, elsewhere, with John James Burnet and Thomas Tait, maintained an important aspect of the New Sculpture movement, adapting it to updated stylistic demands.<br>
<br>Probably Bayes's best-known landmark is the <span class="italic">Queen of Time</span> clock at Selfridges, London (1930), one of many works commissioned for the department store by Gordon Selfridge, his admiring patron. Bayes's work catered for &#145;high life&#146; in the <span class="italic">Unicorns in Battle</span> decorative panel, executed with Alfred Oakley for the RMS <i>Queen Mary</i> (1936), but he also believed in bringing colour to council estates administered by the St Pancras housing association. The <span class="italic">Four Seasons</span> clock and fairytale lunette panels (1937; Sidney Street estate) still survive <i>in situ</i>. A further area of his practice was as a medallist (for example, <span class="italic">Country Life Marksmanship Medal</span>, 1912; <span class="italic">Queen Mary Medal</span>, 1935). These mirror in miniature his stylistic progress from the New Sculpture to art deco, although their design and modelling are sometimes compromised by poor lettering. A commission in a related genre, the great seal and counterseal of George V (1912), is elegant and intricate but literally failed to make a successful impression.<br>
<br>Bayes's awards and offices culminated with a gold medal at the Salon de la Soci&eacute;t&eacute; des Artistes Fran&ccedil;ais (1939) and election as president of the Royal Society of British Sculptors (1939&#150;44). Although he regularly exhibited at the Royal Academy between 1889 and 1952, he was not elected to it, perhaps because he was a victim of his sheer versatility as a &#145;sculptor&#150;craftsman&#146; at a time when the role of fine art became increasingly important.<br>
<br>Bayes died in the Hospital of St John and St Elizabeth, Marylebone, London, on 10 July 1953. He was liked by his fellow artists, from his mentor, Frampton, to contemporaries such as William Reid Dick and Kathleen Scott. His chief interests were his enormous output of work and the garden at his residence from 1930 in Greville Place, Maida Vale, London, which contained examples of his sculpture. Bayes's last years were saddened by his wife's ill health and, at another level, by what he perceived as the aesthetic narrowness of modern art, which overlooked his craftsmanship and humanism. As a result of the exhibitions &#145;The Doulton story&#146; held at the Victoria and Albert Museum in 1979 and &#145;Gilbert Bayes&#146; at the Fine Art Society, London, and Henry Moore Centre, Leeds, in 1998, his place in twentieth-century British sculpture and ceramics has been favourably reappraised. Examples of Bayes's work may be seen in the Tate collection, the British Museum and Victoria and Albert Museum, London, and the Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery.<br>
