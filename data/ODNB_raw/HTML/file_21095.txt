<span class="headword">Page,  Samuel</span>  (1574&#150;1630), <span class="occ">poet and naval chaplain</span>, was the son of a Bedfordshire clergy family. He matriculated as a scholar of Corpus Christi College, Oxford, on 1 July 1587, aged thirteen; he graduated BA on 5 February 1591 and became a fellow on 16 April. He proceeded MA on 15 March 1594. Before 1595 he took holy orders and became chaplain to the earl of Nottingham, Charles Howard, admiral of the fleet. He accompanied Howard on the Cadiz expedition of 1595 and, as he says in his funeral sermon for Sir Richard Leveson, Howard's son-in-law:<blockquote>It pleased him [Leveson] in this expedition, to take knowledge of mee, and often to vouchsafe me his conference, he received at my hands the Sacrament of the body and blood of Christ &hellip; in one of the harboroughs of that land [Spain]. (Page, <span class="italic">Sermon</span>, 2.234)</blockquote>By 1597 he had obtained the living of St Nicholas, Deptford (or West Greenwich).<br>
<br>Before this appointment, which he retained for the rest of his life, Page had had a reputation as a poet and Francis Meres, in <span class="italic">Palladis tamia</span> (1598), ranked him among the very greatest when describing &#145;the most passionate among us to bewaile and bemoane the perplexities of love &hellip; Spencer, Daniel, Drayton, Shakespeare, Wetstone, Gasgoyne, Samuall Page sometime fellowe of Corpus Christi College in Oxford&#146;  (p. 284). His surviving poems are slight: a short commendatory poem to <span class="italic">Coryats Crudities</span> (1611) and &#145;The Love of Amos and Laura&#146;, published in a miscellany called <span class="italic">Alcilia</span> (1613); in the second edition of 1619 it has a dedication to &#145;my approved and much respected friend Iz[aak] Wa[lton]&#146;, but in the third edition of 1628, this dedication becomes merely an address by &#145;the author to his book&#146;. This &#145;heroic poem&#146; was his &#145;maiden muse&#146;.<br>
<br>Page proceeded doctor of divinity on 6 June 1611. His naval experience led to patronage by the brethren of Trinity House &#145;by whose unexpected and undeserved bounty, my labours and Studies have been comforted and encouraged&#146;  (Page, <span class="italic">Cape of Good Hope</span>, dedication). He was also commissioned to preach <span class="italic">God be thanked: a sermon of thanksgiving for the happy successe of the Englishe fleetes sent forth by the &hellip; Company of Adventurers to the East Indies, preached to &hellip; the whole company of their good ship the Hope Merchant, happily returned to Deptford on Maunday Thursday, 29 March 1616</span>. This is addressed to Sir Thomas Smith, governor of the company, and Page declares that he is &#145;no stranger to your free Charity&#146;. His church in Deptford seems to have had a special relationship with the burgeoning merchant marine for, &#145;we the people of this Congregation, &hellip; have ever ioyned in Common supplications before the Throne of Grace, for the good successe of your voyages&#146;  (<span class="italic">God be Thanked</span>, 30). He compiled a &#145;Divine Sea Service containing sundry and necessary and useful formes of prayer and thanksgiving for the helpe of such as travaile by sea&#146;  (<span class="italic">God be Thanked</span>, added at end).<br>
<br>Page died in 1630 and was buried in St Nicholas's on 8 August. His personality is characterized by his friend Nathaniel Snape of Gray's Inn: &#145;the Clergy thought him a reverend, learned, and orthodoxe Divine; and &hellip; the laytie found him alwaies painfully zealous in his Ministry, upright, and conscionable in his life and conversations&#146;  (Page, <span class="italic">A Godly and Learned Exposition</span>, dedication).<br>
