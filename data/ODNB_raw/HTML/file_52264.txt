<span class="headword">Willis,  Olive Margaret</span>  (1877&#150;1964), <span class="occ">headmistress</span>, was born on 26 October 1877 at 65 Thistle Grove, Kensington, London, the second daughter of the five children (one son, four daughters) of John Armine Willis (1839&#150;1916), a school inspector (and later chief inspector of schools for the west of England), and his wife, Janet, daughter of James Coutts Crawford. Mrs Willis, more interested in the soul than in material matters, brought up the children austerely, and they were in awe of their father who dragged them on strenuous climbing holidays in Switzerland where they &#145;suffered from a surfeit of beautiful things on an empty stomach&#146;, Olive later recalled. Though the children were all baptized into the Church of England, the family attended the services (held in Swallow Street, Piccadilly) of the Theistic church founded by Charles Voysey.<br>
<br>As an adolescent Olive Willis was fiercely argumentative, rebellious, and impatient of authority. With the hope that the Misses Lawrence could tame her, she was dispatched in 1891 to the recently founded Wimbledon House (later to become Roedean) in Brighton, where she stayed until 1895. She disliked the emphasis on games here, and also criticized the school for the absence of religious teaching. Much to the Unitarian Miss Penelope Lawrence's disgust, and to her parents' dismay, she became attracted by Anglo-Catholicism and was confirmed at St Cuthbert's, Earls Court, in her eighteenth year. She always remained a staunch Anglican, though her early high-church enthusiasm moderated.<br>
<br>Olive Willis went up to Oxford in 1898 to read history at Somerville College, but achieved only a third. After she came down in 1901 she taught junior history for a year at Queen Anne's School, Caversham, where her informal approach was not appreciated, then went back for two years to her former school, now called Roedean and rehoused in splendid premises on the cliffs above Rottingdean. After that she worked as a supply teacher in London, and continued teaching practice in a variety of schools ranging from Chesterfield to the Haberdashers' Aske's School in Middlesex. (But curiously she was never to encourage her own staff at Downe to gain this sort of teaching experience.)<br>
<br>In 1906, with a friend, Alice Carver, as a partner, Olive Willis embarked on a school of her own. Helped by money from her mother's marriage settlement, she raised enough capital (&pound;1500) to rent Downe House (the Darwin family home) near Orpington, Kent. It opened in 1907 with five staff and one pupil (plus two temporary companions). Three more pupils were added before the following spring, and by 1910 there were thirty-two boarders and four day girls. Olive Willis taught English, Latin, scripture, and history; Alice Carver ran the house and acted as matron. The latter withdrew from the partnership in 1912, and from 1919 was replaced by Lilian Heather, who had been teaching science and maths on a part-time basis.<br>
<br>The school was popular with discriminating literary and academic parents. In 1913, for instance, the annual <span class="italic">Punch</span> cricket match was played at Downe, with E. V. Lucas (whose daughter Audrey was a pupil) captaining the home team and Sir James Barrie (whose team included A. A. Milne) the authors. Over the years, the school produced some distinguished authors of its own, including Elizabeth Bowen, Anne Ridler, Priscilla Napier, and the philosopher Mary Scrutton, and at least one novel&#151;Elizabeth North's <span class="italic">Dames</span> (1981)&#151;was based upon it. Musically, too, Downe was to become outstanding. The composer Robin Milford taught there for many years, and the pianist Myra Hess gave recitals and played with the school orchestra; the oboist Evelyn Rothwell (Lady Barbirolli) was a pupil. The curriculum was strongly biased towards English, history, French, and music, and inspectors were to comment on low standards in maths, science, and geography. But the religious instruction, given by Olive Willis herself, was stimulating: &#145;she made Christianity seem exciting&#146;, a pupil later commented  (Ridler, 101). Individuality&#151;even eccentricity&#151;was encouraged, but girly behaviour and silliness treated with contempt.<br>
<br>Olive Willis was not always easy to work with; like her mother she was contemptuous of physical weakness, and she never understood the practical difficulties of housekeeping. But she attracted deep devotion from many of her staff, as from Lilian Heather, whose affection verged on the possessive, and from the famously eccentric Maria Nickel, who acted as architect, chauffeur, handyman, and engineer, and slept like a watchdog in Miss Willis's bathroom. Pupils admired and respected her, though some must have been dismayed by her acute insight into their characters, revealed in individual end-of-term interviews. &#145;Holbein should have painted her&#146; Elizabeth Bowen was to comment, referring to her large, calm face as &#145;far from <i>prettiness</i> of any possible kind&#146;  (Ridler, 1).<br>
<br>By 1921 the Downe premises were becoming too small. Olive Willis was told of a large house called The Cloisters, Cold Ash, which had been built by a contemplative order on a hill near Newbury, Berkshire. With the help of a gift from an uncle and a loan from two parents of pupils she bought it and 60 acres of land for &pound;11,976. Eighty-three girls assembled for the first summer term in 1922; three years later there were 118, and Downe had established itself as one of the leading girls' schools.<br>
<br>Lilian Heather died in 1943, after thirty-six years' association with Downe, and in 1944 Olive Willis's ownership of the school was transferred to a public body. She retired in 1946, but proposed to go on living at Hill House, which had been built on the school site for her. This presented obvious difficulties for the member of staff who had been chosen to succeed her, and who instead elected to go to another school. In the event, Olive Willis was to spend only part of the year in Hill House, and the rest in London near Regent's Park. Here she welcomed and entertained old pupils, to whom as ever she was unfailingly generous with time and money. She also took a continuing interest in the Bermondsey Time and Talents Settlement, with which Downe House had long had a connection, in the Girl Guide movement, and in her parish church. Olive Willis died on 11 March 1964, of a perforated duodenal ulcer, at her home, 38 Tedworth Square, London, after many years of ill health. Her ashes were buried in the memorial garden at Downe.<br>
