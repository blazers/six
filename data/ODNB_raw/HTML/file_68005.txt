<span class="headword">Howard <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Mordaunt; <em>other married name </em>Germain]</span>,  Mary</span>, duchess of Norfolk  (1658/9&#150;1705), <span class="occ">noblewoman and divorcee</span>, was the only daughter and heir of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/19163/', "Henry Mordaunt, second earl of Peterborough (bap. 1623, d. 1697)")</script>, and his wife, Lady Penelope (<i>c</i>.1622&#150;1702), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20440/', "Barnabas O'Brien, sixth earl of Thomond")</script>. Her mother later served as groom of the stole to Mary of Modena.<br>
<br>As a member of Charles II's court Lady Mary Mordaunt played Psecas in Thomas Crowne's masque of 1675, &#145;Calisto&#146;. On 8 August 1677 she married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13908/', "Henry Howard (1655&#150;1701)")</script>, who became earl of Arundel in 1678 and seventh duke of Norfolk in 1684. Owing to the differences in their religion (he was a Catholic at the time, she a protestant, though their positions were later reversed) the wedding was private. As Lady Arundel she was lady of the bedchamber to Queen Catherine of Braganza. Like many women of the Restoration court she was the object of obscene satirical poetry. Her name was linked in particular to that of Charles Talbot, duke of Shrewsbury, which caused her to have a semi-publicized quarrel with Betty Felton over his affections.<br>
<br>In 1685 Mary, now duchess of Norfolk, was taken to France by her husband. The duke, who had conformed to the Church of England in 1679, left her in a convent, where she was required to convert to Catholicism. Although he may have been spurred to part with her by the discovery of her adultery she later maintained that the duke was moved by financial necessity, &#145;to ease him in his charge and part; he frequently declaring, that when he should be more easy in his fortunes they should live together&#146;  (<span class="italic">A True Account of the Proceedings</span>, 10). The separation, however, proved permanent. When the duchess returned to England in 1686 she took up residence at her estate at Drayton, Northamptonshire, and sued the duke for alimony of &pound;400 a year, which he had promised in 1685 but never paid. She left England again in 1688, but returned again when her father (who had been imprisoned in the Tower after the revolution of 1688) fell ill. This time she took up residence in &#145;Fox-hall&#146; (Vauxhall) under the assumed name of Lady Bateman, later explaining that she needed to remain incognito because she &#145;had at that time nothing to live upon&#146;, and &#145;not able to appear in a condition answerable to her quality&#146; felt bound to retrench her expenses  (<span class="italic">A True Account of the Proceedings</span>, 21).<br>
<br>In January 1692 the duke of Norfolk introduced the first of what were to be three bills in parliament to allow him to divorce his wife and remarry. A string of witnesses, mostly servants, attested before the House of Lords to the duchess's keeping company in 1685 and again in 1691 with the Dutch adventurer <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/10567/', "Sir John Germain (1650&#150;1718)")</script>. Divorces by act of parliament were at the time almost unprecedented and sparked a highly politicized debate over the relationship of church and state and the unreformed character of English canon law (which in contrast to continental protestantism permitted only separation from bed and board rather than full divorce).<br>
<br>The duchess of Norfolk mounted a vigorous defence in parliament. She drew attention to the irregular nature of the proceedings which, she said, violated <span class="roman">Magna Carta</span> and her rights as an English subject by creating new laws arbitrarily, she emphasized her status as a noblewoman descended from an ancient family, she threatened to prove the duke guilty of adultery, she pointed to the unfairness of making her &#145;prove a negative&#146; of events that had happened so long ago, and she contended that the divorce proceeding was an attempt by the duke to pressure her into relinquishing her interest in Castle Rising, Norfolk, and other estates so that he could sell them to rescue his ailing fortunes. Her use of the press is especially striking. In response to &#145;libellous pamphlets&#146; she published in 1692 <span class="italic">A True Account of the Proceedings</span> (printed again in 1693 as <span class="italic">A Vindication of her Grace Mary Dutchess of Norfolk</span>), a long tract which interspersed summaries of testimony with observations attacking the credibility of the duke's plebeian witnesses. Still conscious of maintaining a wifely image the duchess explained that she had initially intended to release her pamphlet after the Lords rejected the duke's first bill in February 1692, but had suspended publication &#145;that there might be no offence to the Duke&#146;. Given, however, that the duke had tried again with a suit in king's bench against John Germain and another bill for divorce in 1693, &#145;it now may not be thought impertinent for this true account to appear to the world&#146;  (<span class="italic">True Account</span>, advertisement). The jury in king's bench had found Germain guilty of criminal conversation with the duchess, but awarded her husband in damages a derisory 100 marks (&pound;66) rather than the &pound;10,000 that he had sought. Although the duke was unable to obtain the passage of his second bill the duchess was persuaded in April 1694 &#145;after long agitation&#146; to convey to him the use of the manor of Castle Rising and her interest in &#145;a considerable part&#146; of the manor of Sheffield in Yorkshire, &#145;it being condicible to their respective quiets and ease&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Case of Mary Dutchess of Norfolk</span>).<br>
<br>In December 1696 the duchess was called to testify before the House of Lords regarding the behaviour of her cousin <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/19162/', "Charles Mordaunt, earl of Monmouth")</script>, during the attainder proceedings against the Jacobite Sir John Fenwick. Monmouth had apparently used the duchess as a conduit to convey advice to her friend, Mary, Lady Fenwick, to the effect that her husband should save himself by accusing prominent members of William III's government of Jacobite plotting. Whether the duchess wished like Mary Fenwick to expose Monmouth's intrigues, or whether she simply could not avoid testifying, is unclear. James Vernon, under-secretary of state, who certainly relished Monmouth's embarrassment, praised the duchess's performance: &#145;she behaved herself with great prudence and address; she appeared to be an unwilling witness, and yet left little room to suspect her sincerity&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters Illustrative</span>, 1.140). The result, in any case, was that Monmouth was humiliated, and blamed the duchess's malice. The duchess was also embarrassed in the proceedings by testimony that she had tried to recruit a widow, Mrs Norton, to discredit George Porter, the chief witness against Fenwick, by charging him with the murder of her husband.<br>
<br>The antagonism between the duchess of Norfolk and her cousin Charles, who had succeeded her father as earl of Peterborough in 1697, was further inflamed by a legal dispute over the manor of Drayton and other properties. Peterborough's enmity may well have contributed to the reversal of her fortunes when the duke of Norfolk once more brought a bill for divorce in February 1700. A new raft of witnesses came forth to prove her adultery, some of whom claimed to have been sent abroad by Germain to prevent their testifying in 1692. The duke also emphasized the danger of his estate's falling into the hands of his Catholic collateral heirs, or of Germain's not-yet-conceived bastard children begotten on the duchess, should he not be allowed to remarry. This time the bill passed both houses, although with the proviso that the duke pay the duchess back her &pound;10,000 marriage portion.<br>
<br>The duke died in April the following year, and five months later Mary married Sir John Germain, baronet: the licence, dated 15 September 1701, was made out in the names of Lady Mary Mordaunt, spinster, and Sir John Germain, baronet (the title he had held since 1698). She died on 17 November 1705, aged forty-six, at her estate at Lowick, Northamptonshire, and was buried in the parish church there five days later. She had settled Drayton and other Mordaunt family property (according to one estimate worth &pound;70,000) on her second husband: despite legal challenges by Peterborough he retained them until his death in 1718, when they passed to his second wife, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/10565/', "Lady Elizabeth Germain, n&#233;e Berkeley")</script>.<br>
