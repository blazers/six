<span class="headword">Pring,  Martin</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1580, <em>d.</em> 1626), <span class="occ">naval officer and explorer</span>, was baptized on 23 April 1580 at Feniton, Devon, the son of John Pring of Awliscombe. His early life is obscure, but by 1603 he had gained the confidence of Richard Hakluyt and the patronage of the Society of Merchant Venturers of Bristol, especially of John Whitson, the local MP.<br>
<br>Pring was put in charge of a voyage to Virginia to make a more intensive study of the area covered by Gosnold and Bartholomew Gilbert (1602). With a licence from Ralegh, the Virginia patentee, he set out with the 50 ton <i>Speedwell</i> (possibly Drake's ship of 1587&#150;8) and the 26 ton <i>Discoverer</i>, and sailed from Milford Haven (10 April 1603) via the Azores to the coast of Maine. He established a camp on the shore of Massachusetts Bay which he called Whitson Bay. Most commentators place the site at Plymouth harbour, but Quinn suggests it was near modern Provincetown on Cape Cod  (Quinn, 359&#150;62). Having protected his camp with a palisade and two mastiffs to keep the curious natives at bay, Pring stayed there for seven weeks, loading his ships with cedar and sassafras, a tree whose dried root was considered good for flavouring and a cure for plague and the pox. He commented on the fertile soil, the abundance of fish, and the great variety of trees. He arrived home on 2 October 1603, having clarified available knowledge about the region; his descriptions, printed by Purchas, were a great encouragement to future settlers.<br>
<br>Pring is almost certainly identifiable with the Martin Prinx who sailed from Woolwich in March 1604 as master of the <i>Phoenix</i> (or <i>Olive Branch</i>) in Charles Leigh's ill-fated expedition to Guiana. He seems to have led a mutiny against Leigh, who was determined to colonize the area, despite the climate and lack of food, and finally Pring sailed home in a Dutch ship, leaving those who remained to die of disease and hunger or to linger in Spanish prisons.<br>
<br>In 1606 Pring was employed by Sir John Popham to link up with Challons in choosing a site for a new colony in north Virginia. Challons failed to reach the rendezvous (his ship was seized by the Spanish authorities) but Pring's exploration of the coast of Maine produced a chart and report that Sir Ferdinando Gorges later pronounced &#145;the most exact discovery of that coast that ever came to my hands since&#146;  (Gorges, repr. in Baxter, 1.73). Pring's encouraging report led to Popham's attempt to establish two colonies in the area (1607).<br>
<br>Pring then entered the East India Company's service, probably in 1607&#150;8. In 1610 he was employed in surveying the Bristol Channel, but the first mention of him in the East Indies is in 1613&#150;14, when he was master of a new 550 ton vessel, the <i>New Year's Gift</i>, the flagship of a squadron of four ships engaged in the first voyage of the newly formed joint-stock company. The fleet defeated a far larger Portuguese armada off Surat (January&#150;February 1615), and the <i>New Year's Gift</i> proceeded to Bantam to load spices. On Pring's return to England the dividend on the voyage proved to be 120 per cent.<br>
<br>The East India Company's regard for Pring can be seen from his appointment in 1617 to command the fifth joint-stock voyage, with the 1000 ton <i>James Royal</i> as his flagship. After confiscating two interlopers outfitted by Lord Robert Rich, Pring formed a close relationship with Sir Thomas Roe, the English ambassador to the Mughal empire, and with him planned the expulsion of the Portuguese, the extension of British trade in the Red Sea, the Persian Gulf, and Persia, and keener rivalry with the Dutch. Pring joined his ships to those of Sir Thomas Dale off Bantam and in 1618&#150;19 engaged the Dutch fleet in Jacatra Bay, Java, and at Masulipatam, where Dale died in August 1619, leaving Pring in overall command.<br>
<br>The poor condition of the fleet and news of peace made with the Dutch at home persuaded Pring to favour an alliance with the Dutch in the East to overthrow Spain and Portugal there, and in March 1620 he entered into friendly relations with Coen, the Dutch commander. Pring then voyaged to Japan (July) and after a stay of five months, in which his ships were repaired, he arrived back in the Downs on 16 September 1621 with a rich cargo on board. On the voyage home Pring had contributed the largest amount (&pound;6 13 <i>s</i>. 4 <i>d</i>.) towards a collection for the building of a free school in Virginia; he became a freeman of the Virginia Company, and was granted 200 acres of Virginian land. After his return the company censured Pring for his lack of vigour in opposing the Dutch following Dale's death, for his friendship with them after the signature of peace (which the Dutch had not kept), for his diversion to Japan, and for indulging in private trade to his own profit. Pring narrowly escaped a privy council trial and eventually cleared himself, but when he left the company's service in 1623 the customary gratuity was withheld.<br>
<br>In the same year Pring was elected a member of the Society of Merchant Venturers of Bristol, and in 1625 he was one of its wardens. He commanded the 300 ton privateer <i>Charles</i>, authorized by the government to prey on French and Spanish shipping, and was very successful in capturing prizes. He may have sailed to Virginia again in 1626, the year of his death. He was buried in St Stephen's Church, Bristol, where his monument bears a long epitaph, the arms of the Society of Merchant Venturers, and four carved ships. His will mentions his wife, Elizabeth, and six children.<br>
