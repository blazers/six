<span class="headword">Wesley <span class="st"> [Wellesley; <em>formerly </em>Colley]</span>,  Richard</span>, first baron of Mornington  (1690&#150;1758), <span class="occ">landowner</span>, was the youngest son of Henry Colley (<i>d</i>. 1700) of Castle Carbury, Kildare, and his first wife, Mary, daughter of Sir William Usher of Dublin. The Colleys were of English origin, having gone to Ireland like so many Anglo-Irish in the capacity of civil servant or soldier. The first of the Irish Colleys, Robert Colley, served as bailiff of Dublin in 1515 but it was his grandson, Sir Henry Colley, deputy lieutenant and steward of King's county, who firmly established the Colley place in Ireland.<br>
<br>Richard Colley followed a path well worn by the ascendancy Irish. He matriculated at Trinity College, Dublin, where he graduated BA in 1711 and MA in 1714, under the name Cowly. On 23 December 1719 he married Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1738), daughter of John Sale, a lawyer, MP for Carysfort and registrar of the diocese of Dublin. The couple had two daughters, Elizabeth and Frances; Elizabeth married Chichester Fortescue in 1743 and in 1750 Frances married William Francis Crosbie. Colley's son and heir, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29002/', "Garrett Wesley")</script>, was born several years later on 19 July 1735. The death of Richard's elder brother, Henry Colley, in 1723 left the family property of Kildare solely in his hands, though the estate was modest owing to the ample provision his father had made for his unmarried daughters. On 23 September 1728 Richard inherited the property of his cousin Garrett Wesley (or Wellesley) of Dangan and Mornington in co. Meath, who died without issue. On 15 November 1728 he took the surname of Wesley, later altered to Wellesley by his grandson.<br>
<br>An amiable and sociable man, Richard Wesley appreciated his good fortune and he enthusiastically adopted an expansive generosity. He was both gentleman farmer and member of the Irish parliament for the borough of Trim (1729&#150;46), but these were only sidelines. His real occupation was entertaining friends and expanding, remodelling, and enhancing Dangan Castle and its extensive grounds. Wesley's obsession with improving his estate reflected the values of ascendancy Ireland. Rising out of the nondescript landscape of co. Meath, Wesley's estate became a showplace. Mary Delany, Wesley's well-connected friend, left behind flattering descriptions of both the house and the park, but she reserved most praise for its owner:<blockquote>The more I am acquainted with Mr. Wesley the higher my esteem rises for him. He has certainly more virtues and fewer faults than any man I know. &hellip; He values his riches <i>only</i> as they are the means of making all about him happy. (<span class="italic">Autobiography &hellip; Mrs Delany</span>, 2.501)</blockquote>On 17 June 1738 his wife, Elizabeth, died but her loss neither altered nor curtailed Wesley's activities. His daughters served as hostess and surrogate mother until their marriages, and life went on as usual. On 9 July 1746 Wesley was rewarded for his untiring sociability with an Irish peerage, becoming baron of Mornington; he took his seat in the Irish House of Lords on 6 October 1746. He died at his house on Grafton Street, Dublin, on 31 January 1758. Though he had expended enormous sums on Dangan, he still left his son an ample income of &pound;8000 per annum. Garrett Wesley, who later became the first earl of Mornington, was the father of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29001/', "Arthur Wellesley, duke of Wellington")</script>, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29008/', "Richard Wellesley, Marquess Wellesley")</script>.<br>
