<span class="headword">Evans,  John</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1774, <em>d.</em> 1828), <span class="occ">printer</span>, was born at Bristol, the son of David and Mary Evans, and baptized on 16 January 1774 at St Philip and St Jacob's Church. Nothing is known of Evans's early life.<br>
<br>Evans was variously proprietor, printer, and editor of a number of local newspapers, none of which was a great success. In June 1808 Evans became the proprietor of the <span class="italic">Bristol Mercury</span> and from about 1812 he took into partnership John Grabham. Evans retired on 7 March 1814 to set up as a printer. He produced the Bristol directories for the years 1815&#150;17 from his premises at 7 St John Street as well as three books by his namesake, the Revd John Evans: <span class="italic">The Substance of an Oration &hellip; on the Death of William Peter Lunell</span> (1811), <span class="italic">Remains of William Reed</span> (1815), and <span class="italic">Historical Account of the Church of St Mary Redcliffe</span> (1815). On 7 August 1817 Evans published the first number of the <span class="italic">Bristol Observer</span>, a weekly journal, printed by John Sharp until 1823 when the Bristol directory gives Evans as the printer. He was living at 13 Kingsdown Parade and contributed many articles to the <span class="italic">Observer</span>, but the paper ended on 1 October 1823 after 322 numbers had been published. That year Evans also published <span class="italic">Practical Observations on the due Performance of Psalmody</span>. In 1824, while living at 9 Somerset Street, Kingsdown, he put together a <span class="italic">Chronological outline of the history of Bristol, and the stranger's guide through its streets and neighbourhood</span>, a storehouse of entertaining facts, but the book was not a success. He applied for financial assistance from the corporation of Bristol, which awarded him &pound;20 on the delivery of four copies of his book. He then left the printing profession and went to work as a clerk in the Phoenix Glasshouse.<br>
<br>Evans's wife died at the end of 1827 and early in 1828 he left Bristol for London to go into business with a printer named Maurice of Fenchurch Street. Maurice was also the proprietor of the newly decorated Brunswick Theatre in Well Street, Wellclose Square. Evans and Maurice were among the ten people killed when the theatre suddenly collapsed on the morning of 28 February 1828. Twenty others were injured. The company was rehearsing the evening's performance of <span class="italic">Guy Mannering</span>
<blockquote>when suddenly a crackling noise was heard from the wrought-iron roof of the building, and almost instantaneously it fell in with a tremendous crash, throwing the front wall of the theatre into the street. The shouts and wailings of the persons inclosed within the theatre were of the most pitiable description. (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 264)</blockquote>Evans left two young daughters and a son. A subscription was taken for their benefit in Bristol and &pound;200 was raised. His son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8989/', "William Evans (1809&#150;1858)")</script>, became a landscape painter, styled Evans of Bristol.<br>
