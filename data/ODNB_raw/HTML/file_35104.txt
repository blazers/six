<span class="headword">Morgan, Sir  Gilbert Thomas</span>  (1870&#150;1940), <span class="occ">chemist</span>, was born at Essendon, Hertfordshire, on 20 October 1870, the son of Thomas Morgan, a butler, and his wife, Marie Louise Corday, a ladies' maid of French&#150;Swiss nationality. After education at the local school he attended the Central Foundation School, Cowper Street, London, and in 1886 enrolled at Finsbury Technical College as a certified student. Influenced by S. P. Thompson, John Perry, and Raphael Meldola, by the time he left three years later he had prepared a series of new derivatives of benzeneazo-&#946;-naphthol and assisted in the extraction of ceria from cerite. The widely differing natures of his early ventures in research were afterwards to have a far-reaching effect, since he never specialized in any one branch of chemistry, but was at home in its organic, inorganic, and physical branches.<br>
<br>Morgan left Finsbury in 1889 and was employed as assistant chemist for five years in the firm of Read Holliday &amp; Co., dye manufacturers, at Huddersfield (later British Dyes, Ltd). In 1894 he decided to give up his industrial career and resume his scientific education; he was awarded a royal scholarship and became a mature student at the Royal College of Science. He soon began assisting Professor W. A. Tilden with various research projects, and graduated BSc with first-class honours in 1896. He then became successively demonstrator, lecturer, and assistant professor at the Royal College.<br>
<br>In 1912 Morgan married Kathleen Nembhard (<i>d</i>. 1944), daughter of George Desborough. They had no children. In the same year he was appointed professor of chemistry at the Royal College of Science in Dublin; in 1916 he returned to Finsbury as professor in succession to Meldola, and in 1919 he was elected Mason professor of chemistry at Birmingham University. Six years later he crowned his career as the first director of the Chemical Research Laboratory which at the instance of Sir Richard Threlfall had been set up at Teddington. In 1937 he retired, but not into inactivity, for he had become chairman of the research fund committee of the Institute of Brewing, and entered actively into a new and large field of research.<br>
<br>Morgan's experimental work had an important impact in two areas: chemical reactions under high pressures and synthetic resins. The first of these arose from his use of the autoclave at Huddersfield, where he produced the dyestuff titan como blue which enjoyed a brief period of high popularity. The second also made its appearance towards the end of his period as a commercial chemist, for he made an observation which in other hands assumed unusual importance. By the condensation of phenol with formaldehyde he obtained a clear amber resin, possessing unexpected physical properties but useless as a source of dyes; the experiment was therefore laid aside and forgotten, until in 1906 the first of the Baekeland patents for the manufacture of synthetic plastics showed how narrowly Morgan had missed a fortune.<br>
<br>Research into colours and the improvement of autoclaves together with co-ordinated compounds were Morgan's chief areas of study at Dublin and Birmingham; it was Morgan who introduced the term &#145;chelate&#146;, which became widely used for rings containing co-ordinated links (bidentate ligands). At Finsbury during the First World War he devoted his time to investigations carried out for the Chemical Warfare Committee. He constructed autoclaves out of military and naval shell, and used them in making organic arsenicals and antimonials that could be applicable to chemical warfare and also in the preparation of colour intermediates. His former experiences as a colour chemist were of great importance, since materials previously imported from Germany now had to be made in Britain, and Morgan helped to reconstruct the industry.<br>
<br>When Morgan took up his post at Teddington his university research topics, together with the examination of low-temperature tars, became its basic studies. Later he directed investigations into a wide range of microbiological problems, including those relating to chemotherapy, water pollution, and the chemical constituents of woodsmoke.<br>
<br>Morgan's publications were regarded as authoritative in their day, and included <span class="italic">Achievements of the British Chemical Industry in the Last Twenty-Five Years</span> (1939), <span class="italic">British Chemical Industry: its Rise and Development</span> (1938), <span class="italic">Inorganic Chemistry: a Survey of Modern Development</span> (1936), and <span class="italic">Organic Compounds of Arsenic and Antimony</span> (1918). He also contributed alone or in collaboration over 350 original scientific papers, always being careful to acknowledge the work of others, and from 1903 to 1906 he was editor of the <span class="italic">Journal of the Chemical Society</span>.<br>
<br>Many honours were bestowed upon Morgan: he was appointed OBE in 1920 and knighted in 1936; he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1915, and he received honorary degrees from the universities of Dublin, St Andrews, and Birmingham. In 1921 he was awarded the gold medal of the Dyers' Company; in 1931 he was president of the Society of Chemical Industry, which in 1939 awarded him its medal, and in 1933 he was president of the Chemical Society.<br>
<br>Morgan possessed an extraordinarily retentive memory and his love of work was matched by his energy, thoroughness, and efficiency. He died of uraemia at the Royal Hospital, Richmond, Surrey, on 1 February 1940, and was cremated at Golders Green crematorium on 6 February. As a legacy to his interest and competence in all branches of chemistry, he left a bequest to the Chemical Society to fund the Corday&#150;Morgan medal and prize, and established the Corday&#150;Morgan memorial fund, which was to be used &#145;to assist in the unification of the chemical profession&#146;.<br>
