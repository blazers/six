<span class="headword">Broadwood,  Henry Fowler</span>  (1811&#150;1893), <span class="occ">piano manufacturer</span>, was born in London in June 1811, the fifth child of James Shudi Broadwood (1772&#150;1851), piano manufacturer, and his second wife, Margaret Schaw Stewart (1778&#150;1849). The founder of the firm was his grandfather, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/3464/', "John Broadwood (1732&#150;1812)")</script>, whose eldest son, James Shudi Broadwood, together with his half-brother, Thomas Broadwood (1786&#150;1861), from 1812 carried on and developed the business. John Broadwood had been a pioneer in the development and popularization of the piano, both in the &#145;square&#146; form and in the more traditionally shaped &#145;grand&#146; form, in the last quarter of the eighteenth century. James Shudi Broadwood and Thomas Broadwood continued this development into the early nineteenth century with such success that by 1840 the company was one of the twelve largest employers of labour in London, with the factory at Horseferry Road, Westminster, producing 3000 instruments a year at its peak.<br>
<br>Henry Fowler Broadwood had not expected to take over the firm, since he had two older brothers, the sons of their father's first marriage to Sophia Bridget Colville. However, the eldest son, John (1798&#150;1864), took holy orders and became a scholar and collector of folk-songs, and the second son died before he could take any active part in the firm. Henry Fowler, talented at sport in his youth, was educated at Harrow School and at Heidelberg. He matriculated at St John's College, Oxford, but a few months later was admitted to Trinity College, Cambridge (on 24 May 1830), though it would appear that he did not take a degree. In 1840 he married Juliana Maria Birch (1816&#150;1898), daughter of Wyrley Birch, gentleman. They had two sons and nine daughters, one of whom was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/57238/', "Lucy Etheldred Broadwood")</script>, the musician and folk-song collector. In 1861, when his uncle Thomas Broadwood died, Henry Fowler Broadwood became a partner in the firm, and he then took charge of the business until his death.<br>
<br>In 1862 Broadwood contributed a particularly valuable document to the study of the harpsichord in England: <span class="italic">Some notes made by J. S. Broadwood, 1838, with observations and elucidations by H. F. Broadwood</span>. In the section concerning the harpsichord he quotes from his father that: &#145;Tabel, a Fleming, who had learned his business in the house of the successor of Ruckers, at Antwerp, was, it is believed, the first person who made harpsichords in London, where he resided between 1680 and 1720.&#146; Although Broadwood was quoting an earlier document, from 1838, it seems that either this was never published or that copies of it are extremely rare, as are copies of the 1862 pamphlet. In fact Broadwood was wrong in stating that Tabel was the first person to make harpsichords in London, but the significance of the observation concerning him is to show how his harpsichords (on which those of Burkat Shudi and Jacob Kirkman were clearly based) were derived from the Flemish school of the Counchets, and through them, the famous Ruckers family. The 1862 pamphlet is also very useful for the study of the early piano in England, and is particularly relevant to the study of Broadwood pianos.<br>
<br>Despite the excellence of Broadwood pianos, which brought about a great demand for them in both home and export markets (Broadwood pianos were used by Beethoven, Chopin, and Mendelssohn, and there are numerous examples of their use by the British royal family), under Henry Fowler Broadwood the firm did not move with the times. It is thought that he was sceptical of the abilities of British founders to make reliable castings and was therefore reluctant to use the single cast-iron frame and the technique of overstringing, both of which were adopted by his competitors and are still universally employed in piano design. Accordingly the fortunes of the firm declined, and though members of the family accumulated considerable personal wealth it was only through the intervention of C. E. Heath, brother of Ada Randolph Heath, the wife of Broadwood's younger son Henry John Tschudi Broadwood (1856&#150;1911), that the firm received the financial help which restored its stability; it was then reformed with the name John Broadwood &amp; Sons Ltd. Pianos bearing this name were still being made under licence by Whelpdale, Maxwell, and Codd in the late 1990s.<br>
<br>Broadwood died on 8 July 1893 at Lyne House, Newdigate, Surrey, on the country estate bought by his father in 1799. His wife survived him.<br>
