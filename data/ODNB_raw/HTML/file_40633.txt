<span class="headword">Ingram <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Howard; <em>other married name </em>Douglas]</span>,  Anne</span>, Viscountess Irwin <span class="st"> [Irvine]</span>  (<em>c.</em>1696&#150;1764), <span class="occ">poet</span>, was born probably in Naworth, the second daughter and third child of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13887/', "Charles Howard, third earl of Carlisle (1669&#150;1738)")</script>, and his wife, Anne (1675&#150;1752), daughter of Arthur Capel, first earl of Essex, and Elizabeth Percy, daughter of Algernon Percy, tenth earl of Northumberland.<br>
<br>As her parents' separation by 1712 assumed permanence, Anne's sharing of her father's interests in politics, literature, and landscaping acquired a vigour that is evident in her letters to him (those less personal, more objective, printed in <span class="italic">Carlisle MSS</span>). In December 1717 she married Rich Ingram, fifth Viscount Irwin 
    (Irvine; 1688&#150;1721)
  , an army officer commonly known as Lord Irwin. Their financial distress, worsened by the collapse of the South Sea venture, was promised relief through his appointment in 1720 as governor of Barbados. Yet before they could sail he died of smallpox on 10 April 1721, leaving Anne childless to settle with the creditors.<br>
<br>In 1730 a trip through the Low Countries and France further developed Irwin's independence. In 1732, back in England, she published the anonymous <span class="italic">Castle-Howard</span>, a poem in heroic couplets that honoured Carlisle's character, his retirement from court, and creative management of the architecture, landscaping, and staff of their family seat. She saluted what she considered his English sensitivity to natural energies in the landscape. Admiration for Pope's verse prompted her response to his <span class="italic">Epistle to a Lady: on the Characters of Women</span>; her &#145;Epistle to Mr Pope. By a Lady&#146; presumably first appeared in the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> for December 1736. Certainly later (if not already) an acquaintance of Pope, she attempted to tease him away from notions of innate gender differences:<blockquote>
<div>In <i>Education</i> all the <i>Diff'rence</i> lies:<br>
</div>
<div>&hellip; A <i>Female Mind</i> like a rude <i>Fallow</i> lies,<br>
</div>
<div>
<i>Thorns</i> there&#151;&amp; <i>Thistles</i>&#151;all spontaneous rise.<br>
</div>
<div>&hellip; <i>Culture</i> improves all <i>Soils</i>.<br>
</div> (BL, Add. MS 28101, fol. 100<i>v</i>; the manuscript version of the text differs importantly from the version printed in <span class="italic">GM</span>)</blockquote>Where Pope had focused on feminine caprice a male perspective shifting between fawning and scorn, Irwin distinguished the genders mainly by differing styles of a drive to power.<br>
<br>When Queen Caroline in 1736 sent Irwin to fetch Augusta of Saxe-Gotha to marry her son Frederick, prince of Wales, Irwin wrote,<blockquote>she desired me in the strongest terms to recommend to the Princess to avoid jealousy, and to be easy in regard to amours, which she said had been her conduct, and had consequently procured her the happy state she had enjoyed for so many years. (<span class="italic">Carlisle MSS</span>, 167)</blockquote>Irwin continued to attend Princess Augusta as lady of the bedchamber through the 1750s. On 11 June 1737 Irwin married a member of the prince's household, Colonel William Douglas, briefly piquing her father and siblings. Together they weathered the royal family's intergenerational feuds. Douglas rose to brigadier-general, serving on the continent with the allied army from 1742 until his death from a fever in August 1747. Irwin had his body returned for burial on 25 January 1748 in the chapel near their home at Kew where she herself was buried after her own death on 2 December 1764.<br>
<br>Beyond her shorter verse, and letters like her own reliving narrow escapes from highwaymen or seeking her father's blessing on her second marriage, Lady Irwin's characteristic high spirits are chronicled in the correspondence of Carlisle's architect Sir John Vanbrugh, one of John Nichols's subjects, and Horace Walpole.<br>
