</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Hamilton,  Gerald Francis Bernard</span>  (1890&#150;1970), <span class="occ">literary prototype, author, and rogue</span>, was born Gerald Francis Hamilton Souter on 1 November 1890 in Shanghai, China, the son of Frank Thomas Edward Souter (1863&#150;1941), a businessman of Scottish descent with commercial interests in China, and his wife, Edith Minnie, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Holliday (1860&#150;1890). Hamilton claimed to be of &#145;faintly ducal&#146; ancestry, with connections to the Stuarts and Bourbons  (Hamilton, <span class="italic">Mr Norris</span>, 13), but in the words of Anthony Powell, &#145;all that had to be done to disprove that claim was to look it up &hellip; when the father and grandfather named by him would not be found&#146;  (<span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span>, 24 Oct 1974). Hamilton's mother died weeks after his birth and he was raised by an unmarried aunt, May Holliday, at 12 St George's Square, Westminster, London. He was sent to Lambrook preparatory school, Berkshire, where he was bullied, and in January 1905 to Rugby School. He left in April 1908, apparently in disgrace. Hamilton had a strong antipathy to his father, a staunch protestant (&#145;an Orangeman, a true blue, to hell with the Pope of Rome and that sort of thing&#146;;  (Symonds, 121)), and this may have influenced his leaning towards high church ritual&#151;an interest at Rugby&#151;and Irish republicanism.<br>
<br>Hamilton was sent by his father to China on a business venture from 1908 to 1910, where he adopted native dress and fraternized with his house boys. While in China he became seriously ill with dysentery and later claimed that the attention he received from an aristocratic Roman Catholic nurse, Sister Clare of the Denbigh family, led him to convert to Catholicism on his recovery. His father disowned him, and Gerald Souter, as he still was, changed his name to Hamilton.<br>
<br>After returning to Europe, Hamilton had an entr&eacute;e to the royal courts&#151;with which he would be connected for the rest of his life&#151;apparently through his father's sisters. Royal acquaintances seem to have included Kaiser Wilhelm II of Germany; Abbas Hilmi II, khedive of Egypt; Prince Aziz Hassan; Mulai Hafid, sultan of Morocco; Princess Maria Theresa, later the last queen of Bavaria; and Maria Christina, mother of King Alfonso XIII of Spain, who arranged for him to visit Franz Joseph, emperor of Austria. In 1912 Hamilton was in Russia, where he met members of the royal family and Rasputin. He also knew the so-called &#145;black society&#146; of the Vatican, where he was received by Pope Pius X.<br>
<br>At this period Hamilton's flat, in Dean Farrar Street, Westminster, was so elaborately decorated in Chinese Chippendale that strangers made appointments to see it. In 1914 he published (as Patrick Weston) <span class="italic">Desert Dreamers</span>, a homosexual romance set in north Africa. In November of the following year Hamilton's flat was raided by the police. He later presented himself as having spent the war interned owing to his pacifist and Irish sympathies, but was in fact charged with acts of indecency involving soldiers. He received two years' hard labour in February 1916, being released and re-arrested in November 1917, and was only then interned on suspicion of pro-German sympathies, being detained in Brixton gaol until 24 December 1918. Hamilton claimed to have been politically inspired by a friendship with the Irish rebel Sir Roger Casement, but in fact seems not to have known him.<br>
<br>After the war Hamilton was involved with political intrigues and charitable work in Europe, attempting to restore the king of Greece and exerting influence on Pope Benedict XV on behalf of the newly established Save the Children Fund, from which he was forced to resign in 1920 over his expenses. Around the same time, he was active in gun-running for the Irish Republican Army. In 1924 he was involved in a fraud on a San Remo jeweller, obtaining a necklace on credit, and was arrested in Marseilles. He was then transported around a number of French and Italian prisons, and later said that the brutal conditions and shocking scenes he witnessed led him towards socialism.<br>
<br>Freed on Christmas eve 1925, Hamilton began a more respectable career: after finding it was difficult to get <span class="italic">The Times</span> newspaper in Germany, he offered himself as their German representative. He was amused that no checks were made on his background. The <span class="italic">Times</span> job ended with charges of embezzlement and bad debts.<br>
<br>During this period Hamilton was involved in public speaking for progressive causes, notably abortion and German reformatory conditions, in addition to pacifist, internationalist, and communist activities, which brought him to the notice of the security services in several countries; he describes himself travelling with cyanide pills under his wig  (Hamilton, <span class="italic">Sophocles</span>, 208). In Berlin he shared a flat with the occultist Aleister Crowley, and Crowley received money from the special branch for reporting on him. The novelist Christopher Isherwood met him in Berlin in the winter of 1930&#150;31 (the precise details of their first encounter remain unclear), and later immortalized him as the model for the sinisterly comic Mr Norris in his novel <span class="italic">Mr Norris Changes Trains</span> (1935). Prior to the novel's publication Hamilton expressed hurt and alarm at the many similarities between himself and Norris, and was particularly offended by Norris's betrayal of his communist associates&#151;something Hamilton claimed himself incapable of doing. He was subsequently won round by Isherwood's reassurances, and later settled comfortably into his role as a literary prototype.<br>
<br>Hamilton was to be enduringly associated with the character of Norris, and with Isherwood himself. He profited from an unsuccessful plan to obtain Mexican nationality for Isherwood's young partner Heinz Neddermeyer, in an attempt to keep him out of wartime service in the German army, and it was also Hamilton who leaked the contents of an Isherwood letter, written from the United States in 1939, selling Isherwood's frivolous remarks about German refugees in California to the <span class="italic">Daily Express</span> gossip column; this helped to turn British public opinion against Isherwood and W. H. Auden for their wartime departure to the United States. Isherwood nevertheless forgave Hamilton and wrote in his journal, on receiving news of his death, &#145;I don't give a damn whether he swindled us [over Heinz's visa] &hellip; But I do remember all the fun we had together. He had a very cozy personality and an animal innocence, you felt he was only acting according to his nature&#146;  (Isherwood, <span class="italic">Liberation</span>, 87).<br>
<br>Hamilton attended the World Congress Against War in Amsterdam in 1932 and the Anti-War Congress at Shanghai in the following year. He spent the mid-1930s in Belgium, and returned to Britain after the Munich crisis of 1938, where he campaigned against war with Germany and interested himself in the peace plan proposed by the twelfth duke of Bedford. This led to his arrest, shortly before he was able to make his planned escape to Ireland dressed as a nun, and he was interned under regulation 18b with Archibald Ramsay, MP and leader of the Right Club, and the fascist leader, Sir Oswald Mosley. In a characteristic moment Hamilton complained to the authorities that a warder had decanted his bottle of 1916 Gevrey-Chambertin into a metal container. After the war Hamilton drifted to the far right. He was active on behalf of Mosley, and went to the United States in 1948 in an attempt to procure a loan to the Franco government from the Knights of Columbus. In 1959 he accepted South African money to write a travel book, <span class="italic">Jacaranda</span>, which portrayed apartheid in a favourable light.<br>
<br>It is in keeping with Hamilton's Zelig-like appearances in twentieth-century history that John Symonds has him making a speech alongside Michael Foot, Philip Toynbee, and others at Trafalgar Square before the first Aldermaston march in 1958. This seems to have been a Hamilton fantasy. He did, however, model for the statue of Sir Winston Churchill by Oscar Nemon; unveiled in London's Guildhall in 1955. When Hamilton revealed that he, an 18b detainee, had modelled the body, the irony of this was not lost on the press. Churchill is reported to have said: &#145;Couldn't they pick anyone else?&#146;, and Nemon told reporters, &#145;Give Hamilton a good kick from me&#146;  (<span class="italic">Daily Express</span>, 22 June 1955).<br>
<br>Hamilton made two paid marriages of convenience. On 31 August 1929, at St Jude's Church, Kensington, he married Diana Parker (<i>b</i>. 1907/8), daughter of Captain Alfred Parker. Following a divorce Hamilton married, at Chelsea register office on 29 April 1933, Suzanne (Suzy) Renou (<i>b</i>. 1907/8), daughter of Alphonse Renou, company director. Hamilton was long associated with attempts to procure passports, foreign decorations, and honours (although there is no evidence for his claim to have worked with the honours broker Maundy Gregory). Despite these activities it is not clear what Hamilton lived on for long periods, other than the charity of friends and a modest trust fund from his aunt, nor what he was &#145;up to&#146;, as Auden put it in &#145;Ode to the New Year&#146; (1939), which celebrates Hamilton in a stanza:<blockquote>
<div>Uncle Gerald, your charm is a mystery<br>
</div>
<div>I shall not attempt to define;<br>
</div>
<div>It concerns your appearance, your history,<br>
</div>
<div>And your knowledge of servants and wine;<br>
</div>
<div>Do you think if I summoned the waiter,<br>
</div>
<div>He could tell us instantly why<br>
</div>
<div>The Embassy thinks you a traitor,<br>
</div>
<div>And Olive thinks you a spy?<br>
</div>
<div>Now it's you that I raise my cup to,<br>
</div>
<div>Though I haven't the slightest idea<br>
</div>
<div>What on earth it is that you're up to,<br>
</div>
<div>I wish you a happy New Year.<br>
</div>(quoted in C. Osborne, <span class="italic">W. H. Auden: the Life of a Poet</span>, 1979, 181&#150;2)</blockquote>Hamilton ended his life in a bedsitter at 518A Kings Road, London, above a Chinese restaurant named The Good Earth; he liked to say &#145;Better above the Good Earth than below it&#146;  (Symonds, 208). His rather camp wit gave rise to regular <i>bon mots</i>, including &#145;We live in stirring times; tea-stirring times&#146;, which Isherwood gave to Arthur Norris, along with another frequently used Hamilton excuse: &#145;There are some incidents in my career, as you doubtless know, which are very easily capable of misinterpretation&#146; (Isherwood, <span class="italic">Mr Norris</span>, 22, 105; Parker, 275, 285). Hamilton died of heart failure on 9 June 1970 at St Stephen's Hospital, Chelsea, and his body was cremated. Despite his somewhat ugly appearance, with his &#145;twisted mouth and blubber lips&#146;  (Maugham, <span class="italic">Escape</span>, 204), he had a fruity charisma when he talked; his character was once described as being like &#145;a pat&eacute; unusually well-stuffed with truffles&#146;  (&#145;London diary&#146;, <span class="italic">New Statesman</span>, 19 Dec 1959). His eccentric charm is brought out in John Symond's memoir <span class="italic">Conversations with Gerald</span> (1974), although Robin Maugham has left a lurid picture of him as a fraudster, and some people&#151;Stephen Spender being one&#151;found him criminal and distasteful. Hamilton quotes Dante at the close of <span class="italic">As Young as Sophocles</span>, the first of three unreliable autobiographies: &#145;I have appeared vile in the eyes of many&#146;  (Hamilton, <span class="italic">Sophocles</span>, 264).<br>
