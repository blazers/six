<span class="headword">Walker,  John</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1770, <em>d.</em> 1831), <span class="occ">antiquary</span>, son of John and Mary Walker of London, was baptized at the church of St Katharine Cree, London, on 18 February 1770, and was elected scholar at Winchester College in 1783. He matriculated from Brasenose College, Oxford, in 1788, and graduated BCL in 1797. In the same year he was elected fellow of New College; he retained his fellowship until 1820. He also filled the posts of bursar, librarian, and dean of canon law. In 1809 he published <span class="italic">A Selection of Curious Articles from the &#145;Gentleman's Magazine&#146;</span> in four volumes. This undertaking had been suggested by Edward Gibbon to the magazine's editor, John Nichols, in 1792, but, as he recorded in <span class="italic">Literary Anecdotes of the Eighteenth Century</span> (8.557), Nichols never found time to pursue the idea. Inspired by Gibbon's suggestion, Walker began work on a selection and in April 1805 wrote to Nichols asking if he would publish it  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Eng. lett. c. 367, fol. 206). The popularity of the work, published by Longman, led to a second edition in 1811 and a third in 1814.<br>
<br>Walker's other literary and antiquarian pursuits were centred on Oxford. In 1809 he brought out <span class="italic">Oxoniana</span>, four volumes of selections from books and manuscripts in the Bodleian Library relating to university matters, &#145;to exhibit a view of the customs and manners which have prevailed at different periods&#146;  (<span class="italic">Oxoniana</span>, 1809, advertisement, vol. 1, p. i). This was followed in 1813 by a similar work, <span class="italic">Letters Written by Eminent Persons &hellip; from the Originals in the Bodleian Library and Ashmolean Museum</span> (2 vols.). Both proved valuable sources of quotation for succeeding writers. Walker was also the author of <span class="italic">Curia Oxoniensis, or, Observations on the Statutes which Relate to the University Court</span> (2nd edn, 1822). He was one of the original proprietors of the <span class="italic">Oxford University and City Herald and Midland County Chronicle</span>, first published on 31 May 1806, and for several years assisted in the editorial work. He was also, from 1810, the first editor of the <span class="italic">Oxford University Calendar</span>.<br>
<br>In 1819 Walker was presented by the warden and fellows of New College to the vicarage of Hornchurch in Essex, and resided there, apparently unmarried, during the rest of his life. He died of a violent cold and inflammation of the chest, at the vicarage on 5 April 1831. His library was sold by Sothebys in 739 lots on 2 June the same year.<br>
