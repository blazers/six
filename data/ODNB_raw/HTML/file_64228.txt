<span class="headword">Bevan,  Robert Polhill</span>  (1865&#150;1925), <span class="occ">painter</span>, was born at 17 Brunswick Square, Hove, Sussex, on 5 August 1865, the fourth of the six children of Richard Alexander Bevan (1834&#150;1918), a banker of Brighton, and Laura Maria Polhill (<i>d</i>. 1906). After four terms at Winchester College (1880&#150;81) he was educated at home in Horsgate, near Cuckfield, Sussex, by private tutors, one of whom, A. E. Pearce, a designer for Doulton from 1873 to 1930, taught him drawing. His artistic education continued in London at the Westminster School of Art in 1888, in Paris in 1889&#150;90 at the Acad&eacute;mie Julian, and from 1890 to 1891 in the village of Pont-Aven in Brittany, the centre of an artists' colony dominated since 1886 by Paul Gauguin. In 1891 he spent time in Madrid to study the works of Vel&aacute;zquez and Goya on his way to Tangier, where he stayed until 1892 or 1893. He then returned to Pont-Aven where, in 1894, he met Gauguin. During his years in France he also met Renoir and C&eacute;zanne.<br>
<br>Because he enjoyed a degree of financial independence, Bevan was able to discover and nurture his talent slowly and to integrate his art and his life. He loved the country; above all he loved horses. In Tangier he was master of foxhounds for a season. Horses are the subject of his earliest surviving paintings, all done in Brittany. On his return to England in 1894 he went to live at Hawkridge on Exmoor where he could combine painting and hunting. In 1897 he met the Polish painter Stanislawa de Karlowska (1876&#150;1952) and on 9 December they married in Warsaw. Their first child, Edith Halena, was born in December 1898; their second, Robert Alexander, in March 1901. Over the next ten years, in England (from 1900 in London at 14 Adamson Road, Swiss Cottage) and on long summer visits to Poland, Bevan worked largely in isolation, sustained by his early acquaintance with many-faceted French post-impressionism. For the rest of his career as a painter and lithographer he sought nourishment in Van Gogh's rhythmic draughtsmanship and directional brushwork, Gauguin's expressionist use of pure colour, and the schematic simplifications of definition evolved within the Pont-Aven school.<br>
<br>The Polish village scenes included in Bevan's first one-man exhibition in 1905&#151;probably the most radical paintings by a British artist then to be seen in London&#151;were barely noticed by the critics. It was not until 1908, when he contributed to the first Allied Artists' Association non-jury exhibition, that he was discovered by Spencer Gore and Harold Gilman and introduced into the circle orchestrated by Walter Sickert at 19 Fitzroy Street. Bevan was a founder member of the Camden Town group established in 1911, of the London group set up in 1913, and in 1914 of the Cumberland Market group. The last group was named after Bevan's studio at no. 49 where, in 1914 and 1915, he painted the horse-drawn carts in the great cobbled Camden Town square which served as London's hay market.<br>
<br>By 1906&#150;7 the brilliant colours and joyous freedom of Bevan's earlier painting had given way to a more traditional, light-toned, impressionist palette and a more considered, broken touch. His unique contributions to the urban vocabulary of Camden Town group painting were cab-horse scenes and, from 1912, horse sales at Tattersalls, Aldridges, the Barbican, and Wards. He also painted his own neighbourhood, but his sunny views of spacious avenues on the borders of St John's Wood have little in common with the mean back streets of Camden Town painted by Sickert, Gore, and Gilman.<br>
<br>During the summer Bevan painted in the country, most often in the Blackdown hills on the Devon&#150;Somerset borders. In 1912, 1913, and 1915 he was at Applehayes as a guest of the retired rancher and amateur painter H. B. Harrison; from 1916 to 1919 in a cottage rented near by, in the Bolham valley; and in 1920 and 1923&#150;5 on Luppitt Common, further south in Devon. He responded energetically to the west country scenery, with its strong patterning of fields, woods, and clustered cottages, producing a series of paintings expressive of both the angular structure and the poetry of its landscape.<br>
<br>In 1925 Bevan was diagnosed as having cancer; he died&#151;still little known outside his own circle&#151;on 8 July in St Thomas's Home, Lambeth, London, following an operation. He was survived by his wife. <span class="italic">The Cab Yard, Night</span> (exh. 1910, purchased 1913 by Brighton Art Gallery) was the only painting to enter a public collection during his lifetime. Despite memorial shows in 1926 and an Arts Council exhibition in 1956, his unique contribution to British art was not widely recognized until 1965, the centenary of his birth. In that year the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford arranged a comprehensive retrospective and R. A. Bevan, the artist's son, published his informative and well-illustrated memoir.<br>
