<span class="headword">Bacon, Sir  James</span>  (1798&#150;1895), <span class="occ">judge</span>, was born on 11 February 1798, the son of James Bacon and his wife, Catherine Day, of Manchester. His father was a certificated conveyancer between 1805 and 1825 and barrister of Middle Temple.<br>
<br>On 4 April 1822 Bacon joined Gray's Inn, and was called to the bar on 16 May 1827. He also joined Lincoln's Inn on 3 October 1833, and on 8 May 1845 became barrister there. On becoming queen's counsel he was elected bencher on 2 November 1846 and treasurer in 1869.<br>
<br>On 23 April 1827 Bacon married Laura Frances (<i>d</i>. 1859), daughter of William Cook of Clay Hill, Enfield, Middlesex; they had at least two sons.<br>
<br>Bacon practised on the home circuit and the Surrey sessions. He also reported and wrote for the press and was said to have been a sub-editor of <span class="italic">The Times</span>. Eventually he specialized in conveyancing, chancery, and bankruptcy business.<br>
<br>In 1859 Bacon was appointed under-secretary and secretary of causes to the master of the rolls, and on 7 September 1868 commissioner in bankruptcy for the London district, becoming chief judge under the <span class="roman">Bankruptcy Act</span> of 1869 until its repeal in 1883, and transfer of the bankruptcy jurisdiction to the Queen's Bench Division of the High Court of Justice. Having succeeded Sir William James as vice-chancellor on 2 July 1870, Bacon held the two offices until 1883. He was knighted on 14 January 1871.<br>
<br>The <span class="roman">Judicature Acts</span> of 1873 and 1875 allowed existing vice-chancellors to keep their titles for life, giving them the status of justices of the High Court, but provided that no more vice-chancellors would be appointed. Though considerably older, Bacon outlived his fellow vice-chancellors, Malins, Wickens, and Hall, and so became the last vice-chancellor, a post whose creation in 1813 he could remember.<br>
<br>Bacon continued as vice-chancellor after 1883. He was still in good health when he retired on 10 November 1886 at the age of eighty-eight. He was then sworn in as a member of the privy council (26 November 1886). Soon afterwards Bacon told one of the leaders of his court, Mr Miller, that if he had known how pleasant leisure was, he would have retired sooner. Bacon died of old age at his home, 1 Kensington Gardens Terrace, Hyde Park, London, on 1 June 1895.<br>
<br>Bacon's career spanned an era of incessant and unprecedented reform. It was perhaps no wonder that as vice-chancellor he showed some of the foibles of an old practitioner confronted with a new order or that many of his judgments were reversed or modified on appeal. Bacon was a courteous judge who liked to liven up court proceedings with humour and wit. He was a clever cartoonist and his illustrated trial notes were much appreciated by the lords justices of appeal. Lord Coleridge said: &#145;A man of keener intellect, of more vigorous health of mind and body, at 90, I never met.&#146;<br>
