<span class="headword">Gilchrist,  Marion</span>  (1864&#150;1952), <span class="occ">physician</span>, was born on 5 February 1864 at Bothwell Park, Lanarkshire, the daughter of William Gilchrist (<i>d</i>. 1903), a well-to-do tenant farmer, and his wife, Margaret Williamson. Marion was a pupil at the nearby Hamilton Academy, but left school at the age of fourteen to work on the farm. Not content with supervising milking and butter and cheese making, she secretly enrolled in a correspondence course in English and attended evening classes at her old school. In 1887 she matriculated as an arts student from Queen Margaret College for the Higher Education of Women, Glasgow, probably aiming to become a teacher. At the end of her first year she began to take the exams leading to a LLA (lady literate in arts) awarded by the University of St Andrews, which she sat first at Paisley and then at Queen Margaret College itself. This qualification allowed many women throughout the United Kingdom to embark on professional careers. In 1888 Marion Gilchrist passed in physiology, French, and botany, in 1889 in logic and metaphysics and with honours in English and in education, and in 1890 in natural philosophy. She gained her LLA in that year and immediately enrolled along with thirteen other women in the newly opened medical school at Queen Margaret College.<br>
<br>By this time Marion Gilchrist was taking an active part in student politics as a member of the Liberal Club. Since the college was not allowed to present candidates for professional exams, in 1891 she applied on behalf of herself and her fellow students for entry to the University of Glasgow under the terms of the 1889 <span class="roman">Universities (Scotland) Act</span> which sanctioned the admission of women. In the following year the first women students matriculated and Marion Gilchrist, with fifty-five other women, entered the medical faculty. So as to be able to graduate as quickly as possible, she took classes in the summer of 1893 at the Royal Hospital, the military hospital in Dublin. She graduated in July 1894 along with her fellow student Alice Lilian Louisa Cumming. Because Marion Gilchrist gained a high commendation she was technically the first woman graduate of the university. In the same year (Elizabeth) Dorothea Lyness (later Dr Chalmers Smith) also graduated. Along with her fellow women students, Marion Gilchrist had to overcome considerable hostility from some quarters of the male medical establishment and from male students. Despite her remarkable achievement in completing the course in four and a half years, she found time to be vice-president of the Queen Margaret College Student Union, vice-president of the Literary and Debating Society, and convener of the Queen Margaret College committee of the Glasgow University Liberal Club.<br>
<br>After qualifying, Marion Gilchrist assisted in a general practice in the west end of Glasgow, developing an interest in diseases of the eye. The death of her father in 1903 gave her the means to set up in practice at 5 Buckingham Terrace, where she remained for the rest of her life. She never married, but shared her home and consulting rooms until 1928 with <a name="cosubject_74924"></a><span class="headword">Katherine Mary Chapman</span>  (1883&#150;1948)<span class="occ"></span>, who had first matriculated from Glasgow University in 1894. The daughter of John Henry Chapman, a barrister in Cheltenham, Katherine Chapman did not graduate until 1903 when she gained the triple qualification from the Faculty of Physicians and Surgeons in Glasgow. Later she worked in the electrical department at Glasgow Royal Infirmary, the first radiography department in the world. She became head of department&#151;the first woman to achieve such a position in a major Scottish teaching hospital&#151;and university lecturer in radiology, electrotherapy, and diagnosis. She retired from these positions in 1928 and set up practice in the West End of London. She died unmarried at Cardross in Dunbartonshire in May 1948. Marion Gilchrist wrote a touching notice in the <span class="italic">Glasgow Herald</span> in which she praised her friend's pastoral care as much as her clinical skills. Their relationship had remained formal to a fault. To the end they never addressed each other than as Dr Gilchrist or Dr Chapman.<br>
<br>Financial and professional independence allowed Marion Gilchrist to become politically active more openly. During 1903&#151;encouraged by her friends Janie Allan, the daughter of the owner of the Allan Line, and Margaret Irwin&#151;she joined the Glasgow and West of Scotland Association for Women's Suffrage, formed the previous year. Frustrated by the association's lack of progress, in 1907 all three supported a call for more militant action from Grace Paterson, who had been actively involved in establishing Queen Margaret College and was one of the first two women elected to the Glasgow school board. She had also been involved in setting up Redlands Hospital for Women in Glasgow in 1903. Dissatisfied with the committee's response, the four women resigned and joined the Glasgow branch of the Women's Social and Political Union. Unlike Janie Allan and her fellow student Dorothea Chalmers Smith, Marion Gilchrist did not take part directly in militant protest, although she became a member of the Glasgow branch of the Women's Freedom League. She preferred instead to devote her voluntary energies to the Invalid Children's School of the Queen Margaret College Settlement for which she acted as physician from 1903 to 1911. In 1914 she was appointed assistant surgeon for diseases of the eye at the Victoria Infirmary on the south side of the city. From 1916 until 1918, while Hugh Walker, the surgeon for diseases of the eye, was away on war work, Marion Gilchrist took over his duties. She resigned from the infirmary in 1930 as she found it difficult to share the position with that of ophthalmic surgeon at Redlands Hospital for Women to which she had been appointed three years before. She continued to serve Redlands Hospital until the end of her life, not just as a clinician but also assisting with fund-raising events.<br>
<br>As Marion Gilchrist became less engaged with the suffrage movement, she became more involved in medical politics. She was among the first members of the Medical Women's Federation, which she supported actively throughout her life. She was a prominent member of the British Medical Association and the first woman chairman of the Glasgow division. She was a trustee of the Muirhead Trust, which had been established in 1889 with the initial purpose of establishing a medical school in the west of Scotland for women. She used these positions to advance the careers of medical women within the male-dominated medical institutions in the west of Scotland. She was an enthusiastic early motorist and traveller. Above all she was a medical practitioner with a fierce sense of duty&#151;a quality which she expected others to share. When a newly qualified woman doctor was visiting her for tea during the war and the air-raid warning sounded, she told her young colleague that she must return at once to her hospital on the other side of Glasgow even though bombs were falling outside. Marion Gilchrist died at her home in Buckingham Terrace, Glasgow, on 7 September 1952.<br>
