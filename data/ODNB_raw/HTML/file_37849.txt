<span class="headword">Peyton, Sir  Robert</span>  (<em>c.</em>1633&#150;1689), <span class="occ">politician and conspirator</span>, was the fourth son of Henry Peyton (<i>d</i>. 1656), examiner in chancery (1632&#150;54), of Chancery Lane, London, where his son was born. Peyton was admitted to Lincoln's Inn in 1655, having also succeeded his father as an examiner in chancery in 1654. He married Jane Robinson (<i>d</i>. 1684), daughter of Lionel Robinson of Cowton Grange, Yorkshire. They had at least one son and one daughter. He was knighted in 1670, served as deputy lieutenant for Middlesex from 1670 to 1676 and again in 1689, as JP from 1672 to 1676, and as MP for Middlesex in the parliaments of spring 1679 and autumn 1680.<br>
<br>Despite holding these positions of responsibility in the 1670s, Peyton was a leading member of the opposition to Charles II. He was a political associate of both the main opposition leaders, George Villiers, second duke of Buckingham, and Anthony Ashley Cooper, first earl of Shaftesbury. By the mid-1670s Peyton had become the leader of a republican group, &#145;Peyton's gang&#146;, and it has been argued that this group had a hand in the murder of the JP Sir Edmund Berry Godfrey in 1678, which provoked widespread belief in the bogus Popish Plot. Godfrey was a member of Peyton's gang, but after receiving, in his capacity as a JP, the Popish Plot depositions of the false informer Titus Oates, Godfrey promptly warned one of the accused Catholics and the court itself. Peyton may have decided to have Godfrey killed both because of his &#145;betrayal&#146; and to stir up hatred against the Catholics, on whom suspicion would inevitably fall.<br>
<br>Peyton's heavy involvement in opposition plotting had already been noted by the government. In 1676 Peyton and a number of his fellow JPs for Middlesex were removed abruptly from the bench. This was an unusual step, because Charles II&#151;at least prior to 1681&#151;was notoriously tolerant towards his political opponents (much to the chagrin of his supporters). Although most of those removed were members of Peyton's gang, there is also some evidence to suggest that Peyton and his friends were removed for being involved in the distribution of seditious literature.<br>
<br>Peyton was one of the most active members in the turbulent parliament of spring 1679. In the same year he became the chairman of the radical <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/92786', "Green Ribbon Club")</script>, having been a founder member of the club some six years earlier. However, by the end of 1679 Peyton had briefly and secretly come over to the court interest. This remains rather a shadowy affair. Peyton appears to have been won over by the renowned Catholic midwife Elizabeth Cellier. Peyton later claimed that his motives were sexual, and certainly both of them, Peyton in particular, had a reputation for sexual licentiousness. There is also, however, some evidence to suggest that Peyton was partly motivated by fear. When Charles II had fallen seriously ill at the end of summer 1679, Peyton and some of his opposition colleagues, including fellow London radicals such as Sir Thomas Player and Francis Jenks, had apparently discussed rising in revolt against James, duke of York, should he become king. However, Charles had recovered, James was experiencing a temporary resurgence of his fortunes, and Peyton appears to have been afraid of the repercussions. Whatever Peyton's reasons for his temporary defection, he was discovered and bitterly attacked by his former friends in the next parliamentary session.<br>
<br>Peyton did move back into some degree of opposition (now called whig) contact, and he was involved on the peripheries of the 1682&#150;3 Rye House plot. In 1685 he planned to raise London for James Scott, duke of Monmouth, during the Monmouth rebellion. Peyton, however, vacillated, being unsure of support, and Monmouth was defeated in the west while Peyton was still holding meetings. Peyton's plotting was discovered, and, charged with high treason, he fled abroad to the Netherlands.<br>
<br>In 1686 the English envoy to the states general, Bevil Skelton, and some of James II's army officers attempted to kidnap Peyton and bring him back to England, but failed, and the affair caused a diplomatic incident. Two years later, Peyton commanded a regiment in William of Orange's invasion force against James II. However, Peyton died in London less than a year later, on 3 May 1689, reportedly of a fever two days after drinking bad claret. He was buried in London on 8 May.<br>
<br>Peyton had a violent character, behaving viciously in the frequent private quarrels in which he became embroiled. He may well, though, have had a magnetic side to his personality, to be able to rise to such a high position in opposition circles.<br>
