<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Mare, Sir  Peter  de la</span>  (<em>fl. </em><em>c.</em>1365&#150;1387), <span class="occ">speaker of the House of Commons</span>, was probably the son of Sir Reynold de la Mare, a Herefordshire knight. His brother Malcolm was also prominent in Herefordshire and in some parliaments. For some years before October 1371 Peter de la Mare had been collector of the tolls from the iron mines of the Forest of Dean. From December 1372 to July 1373 he was sheriff of Herefordshire. In 1373 he was a member of the commission to raise troops in Herefordshire, Worcestershire, and Shropshire to accompany Edmund (III) Mortimer, earl of March (<i>d</i>. 1381), to Ireland, while in November 1374 he was one of the feoffees to whom March was licensed to enfeoff various estates on the Welsh border, which were later leased back to the earl for a nominal rent. The Mortimer link was no doubt the crucial factor behind de la Mare's political importance&#151;he was later said to have been retained for life to serve the earl in peace and war, and to be the earl's steward.<br>
<br>Peter de la Mare came into prominence in the Good Parliament of April to July 1376, which he attended as knight of the shire for Herefordshire and in which he was appointed speaker of the Commons, the first named holder of this position. He probably owed this to his connection with Mortimer, who had become disaffected with the government in the 1370s, and consequently sympathized with the Commons' attack on the court, becoming a member of the council appointed as a result of demands made by the Commons. The Good Parliament was effective because it embodied a remarkable alliance of varied class interests against the corrupt court of the later years of Edward III: commons offended by the waste of taxpayers' money, merchants anxious to reassert the control of the staple over the wool trade, nobles and bishops critical of the crown's foreign policy, which had been managed by the duke of Lancaster rather than the king. De la Mare acted as spokesman for this collection of interests, and the detailed account of the parliament in the Anonimalle chronicle presents dramatically his forthright adoption of the role of spokesman, summing up the Commons' views to be presented to the Lords, as a critical moment in the whole evolution of parliamentary institutions. As speaker he was decidedly not a spokesman for the crown, but was partly responsible for the feast held at the end of the parliament to celebrate the success of the Commons in damaging the position of Alice Perrers (<i>d</i>. 1400/01), Lord Latimer (<i>d</i>. 1381), and others at court.<br>
<br>The political tide, however, turned quickly in favour of the court in the next few weeks. De la Mare was summoned to appear before the council in November 1376, and then imprisoned in Nottingham Castle. During the so-called &#145;Bad Parliament&#146; early in 1377, when the court was effectively in control, demands by the Commons and by Londoners that he should be released were rejected. His release eventually came immediately after the death of Edward III in June 1377. His return to London under the new king, Richard II, was much celebrated in the city. He was pardoned and later rewarded by the crown, and his expenses in prison compensated. In the parliament of October 1377 de la Mare was again knight of the shire for Herefordshire, and was once again elected speaker, presumably in accordance with the renewed ascendancy of the political wing with which he had been connected in the Good Parliament, and which revived the attack on Alice Perrers, the mistress of Edward III, who apparently regarded de la Mare as an enemy.<br>
<br>In May 1379 de la Mare was appointed to the commission to assess the poll tax in Herefordshire. He was later pardoned for neglect of this duty, on the grounds that he had accompanied the earl of March, appointed lieutenant of Ireland in October 1379. In January 1380, however, he again became knight of the shire for Herefordshire. March crossed to Ireland in May 1380, after appointing de la Mare one of the attorneys for his absence, and also one of his executors. De la Mare was made justice of the peace for Herefordshire in May 1380, and then sat as knight of the shire for the fourth time in the parliament of November and December 1380. When the peasants' revolt broke out in 1381 he was appointed to commissions to resist rebels in Herefordshire. In the same year he appears to have been involved in the administration of the cathedral church of Hereford. After the death of the earl of March in December 1381 de la Mare was one of his executors, and also one of the trustees of the Mortimer estates in many counties; their position as trustees was confirmed by the crown on condition of their paying a rent to the exchequer. He represented Herefordshire in the parliaments of May 1382, October 1382, and February 1383. After the death of Sir Richard Burley in Spain with the duke of Lancaster in 1387 de la Mare was one of his feoffees. That is the last known mention of him. The date of his death is unknown and he may have been unmarried.<br>
