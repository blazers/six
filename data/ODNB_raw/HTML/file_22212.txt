<span class="headword">Pickering, Sir  William</span>  (1516/17&#150;1575), <span class="occ">courtier and diplomat</span>, was, according to his father's inquisition post mortem, born in 1516 or 1517, the son and heir of Sir William Pickering (<i>d</i>. 1542) and Eleanor, daughter of William Fairfax of Bylands Park, Yorkshire. His father was knight marshal to Henry VIII, whose grants to him included a lease on lands formerly belonging to the Denbighshire monastery of Valle Crucis. Pickering was tutored by Sir John Cheke at St John's College, Cambridge, and appears on a list of the young radical scholars who adopted Cheke's new method of pronouncing Greek, but there is no record of his graduation. In 1538 he was nominated to be one of those &#145;most mete to be daily waiters&#146; on Henry VIII and &#145;allowed in his house&#146;  (<span class="italic">LP Henry VIII</span>, 13/2, no. 1184). On 1 April 1543, together with Thomas Wyatt and Henry Howard, earl of Surrey, his patron, he was brought before the council charged with eating flesh in Lent and breaking the windows of houses and churches in London around Candlemas time. Next day he confessed, and was imprisoned in the Tower. He was released on 3 May on entering into recognizances for &pound;200. During the French wars he is said to have served Henry VIII at Calais with Anthony Pickering, its constable, who was probably a relative.<br>
<br>With the imprisonment and execution of Surrey on 21 January 1547, Pickering found a new patron in John Dudley, Viscount Lisle (created earl of Warwick in 1547), who helped him secure promotions and office during Edward VI's reign. On 22 February 1547 he was dubbed knight of the carpet. William Patten refers to him as a sergeant of the band in Somerset's expedition to Scotland in 1547. He sat on the commission of the peace for Cumberland in May 1547, and was elected the senior MP for Warwick the following October. In the summer of 1550, after Warwick's seizure of power, he went briefly on a diplomatic mission to France. In February 1551 he was sent again to France, as special ambassador to discuss peace terms between England and Scotland. He arrived at Blois on 26 February and had an interview with the king at Vend&ocirc;me on 3 March, but on the 15th returned to England on the plea of urgent private affairs. Although he promised to be back within a fortnight or three weeks, the council detained him to deal with Anglo-Scottish negotiations. Edward VI's journal entry for April 1551 notes that he was to be sent to France as &#145;ambassador legier&#146;, but when he returned to France in May, it was as part of the earl of Northampton's embassy. He was only officially notified of his appointment as resident ambassador and given his instructions on 30 June.<br>
<br>As ambassador Pickering earned the respect of Henri II, but he did not enjoy his service in France. He was soon complaining of shortness of funds and that his allowance was 7 crowns a day while he had to spend 13 or 14 to live. Furthermore, he found the work tiring and unproductive. His time spent accompanying the king on his campaign in Lorraine in February 1552 so exhausted him that his health began to suffer. When he raised the grievances of English merchants with the French, they failed to listen to any of his demands and only offered him &#145;fair words&#146;: &#145;The more I cry out, the worse words I give these men, the more am I cherished, banqueted, and presented with venison&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP for.</span>, <i>1547&#150;53</i>, 214, 233). From May 1552 onwards, he begged Sir William Cecil to secure his recall. Pickering was not alone in finding foreign service difficult and unrewarding in the last two years of Edward's reign; the diplomats Thomas Chamberlain and Richard Morrison also pleaded for their recall.<br>
<br>Pickering was not replaced immediately. On 1 April 1553 Dr Nicholas Wotton and Sir Thomas Challoner were sent as commissioners to France, and on the following day Challoner was designated resident ambassador. Pickering, however, continued in France until a month after Mary's accession, when Wotton took his place, but his debts by then were so great that he had difficulty in leaving Paris.<br>
<br>During Edward VI's reign, Pickering was considered to be a committed protestant. The imperial ambassador described him as a zealous protestant and a creature of the duke of Northumberland, as Warwick had become. In early 1553 he was appointed to sit on two commissions in Cumberland to oversee the removal of church ornaments. His absence abroad, however, prevented his becoming actively involved in their work, as it did in Northumberland's attempt to place Lady Jane Grey on the throne.<br>
<br>Back in England, Pickering soon became implicated in the conspiracy against Queen Mary's Spanish marriage. In October 1553 the imperial ambassador reported that he had spoken to Elizabeth and was in contact with the French ambassador. Soon afterwards Pickering began conspiring with his old colleague, Sir Thomas Wyatt, and during the latter's rebellion the government believed that he was plotting to capture the Tower. In March 1554 he escaped with Sir Peter Carew and other associates to Caen in Normandy, where it was rumoured that they were working to intercept the Spanish fleet transporting Prince Philip to England. Wotton asked the French king to arrest them, but without success. On 7 April 1554 Pickering was indicted for treason, but he was then in Paris. Fearing that he would turn the English cipher over to the French, Wotton suggested that Mary should grant him a pardon. In fact, Pickering had no wish to betray his monarch, and he revealed to Wotton information about the plans of the other English conspirators. Suspecting his deceit, some of his old associates plotted to assassinate him, but he was able to slip out of Paris secretly on 25 April 1554 and he spent the next year travelling in Italy and Germany.<br>
<br>Thanks to the intercession of Sir John Mason, Sir William Petre, and Wotton, Pickering was pardoned on 4 December 1554. Early in March 1555 he was in Brussels and soon afterwards he was allowed home. It was not until 1558 that he was again employed on governmental business. In March 1558 he was sent to recruit 3000 foot soldiers in Germany for the queen's service in defence of Calais, but the order was countermanded after he had begun the negotiations. As a consequence, he found himself financially embarrassed and the debts he ran up were still outstanding five years later. In October 1558 he was sick with ague at Dunkirk, and he did not return home until 4 May 1559, six months after Elizabeth's accession.<br>
<br>As early as 26 November 1558, Pickering had been mentioned as a possible husband for Elizabeth, and on his return to England he was evidently taken seriously as a suitor. In the Spanish ambassador's dispatches are reports that Elizabeth had visited Pickering secretly at his own house and had later on given him lodgings at court. De Quadra also recounted that he was living extravagantly, had quarrelled with the twelfth earl of Arundel (another English candidate for her hand), and challenged the earl to a duel for speaking ill of him. Bets placed in London were said to be at 25 to 100 that Pickering would be king. He, however, took himself less seriously, and stated his personal view that the queen intended to die a maid.<br>
<br>Pickering soon faded from the public eye and thereafter lived quietly at Pickering House in London and on his estates in Yorkshire, where he probably devoted himself to study. His public appearances were few. Just before the outbreak of the 1569 northern rising, he reported rumours of unrest to the queen's representative in the north and left for London, where he was appointed one of the queen's lieutenants. In 1570 he was on the special commission to try the Catholic activist John Felton for treason, and was appointed a JP for Middlesex.<br>
<br>Pickering died, unmarried, on 4 January 1575 at his house in London and was buried on the north side of the chancel of St Helen's, Bishopsgate. His father's body was disinterred and buried with him, in a tomb which in his will he ordered should be made at a cost of 200 marks and &#145;garnished and decked with the armes coates of me and my auncestors&#146;  (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/57, fols. 2&#150;3). Clearly a very wealthy man, he disposed of quantities of plate, fine clothes, armour, and household furnishings, as well as money. His residuary legatee was his illegitimate daughter, Hester, whom he directed was to live and be educated in the house of his executor, Thomas Unton. Other bequests went to friends who included Lord Keeper Bacon, John Astley and his wife, Katherine, Thomas Norton and Thomas Heneage, servants, and relations, among whom his sister Anne received favoured treatment. His executors were to &#145;provide a Jewell&#146; worth 200 marks for the queen. He left Lord Burghley &#145;all my papers of Antiquities that are pasted together of the monuments of Rome and other places&#146;, as well as globes, compasses, and a horse. Pickering was clearly proud of his library, and instructed that it was not to be &#145;spoiled nor dispersed&#146;, but should pass to his daughter's future husband. As well as leaving money to the poor of his parish and to St Bartholomew's Hospital, Smithfield, he bequeathed &pound;30 per annum for seven years to maintain poor scholars at one of the universities. His proposed benefactions went further, for after various elaborate schemes had been drafted and discarded he settled his estates on Oxford and Cambridge universities should his daughter die childless. However, she married and had children, so this reversion did not take effect. His library, in so far as it can be traced through subsequent sales, descended with the Wotton library to the fifth earl of Carnarvon. Some of the books had been bought while he was in Paris, while his copies of Italian classics printed in Venice were probably bought during his sojourn in Italy.<br>
