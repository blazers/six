<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Scott <span class="st"> [<em>married name </em>Hamilton-Russell]</span>, Lady  Margaret Rachel</span>  (1874&#150;1938), <span class="occ">golfer</span>, was born on 5 April 1874, the second daughter in the family of five sons and two daughters of John Scott, third earl of Eldon (1845&#150;1926), and his wife, Henrietta Minna (<i>d</i>. 1921), eldest daughter of Captain Henry Turnor.<br>
<br>Lady Margaret grew up playing golf with her father and brothers on a private nine-hole course on the family estate, Stowell Park, in Gloucestershire. She became famous for winning the first three Ladies' Golf Union (LGU) championships, 1893&#150;5, with a consummate ease that secured her reputation as the best woman player of her day. Within her family, however, she had to share golfing honours with her brother Michael, who in 1933, as a 55-year-old grandfather, became British amateur champion.<br>
<br>Women's golf was its infancy in Lady Margaret's day. The first women's clubs in Britain were founded in the 1860s, but the game made slow progress in the face of a litany of objections by men that typified male attitudes towards attempts by women to act independently. According to Mabel Stringer, the first female sports journalist, it was &#145;amazing women learned to play at all considering what they had to contend with and the little inducement there was for them to persevere and practise&#146;  (Stringer, <span class="italic">Golfing Reminiscences</span>, 14), and also considering the cumbersome clothing in which the dictates of fashion compelled them to play.<br>
<br>A watershed in the history of women's golf occurred in the spring of 1893 with the foundation of the LGU and the inauguration of the first annual championship. The competition was held at the Lytham and St Anne's club in Lancashire, 13&#150;15 June; registration was open to members of any golf club, and play was by match over eighteen holes on a relatively short and easy nine-hole ladies' course. There were thirty-eight entrants from England, Ireland, and France, most unmarried and of limited skill. Lady Margaret was expected to win, and she did not disappoint, averaging 42 for nine holes, winning the majority of matches comfortably, and defeating Issette Pearson, the honorary secretary of the LGU, in the final round by 7 and 5. Her victory was a revelation to spectators to &#145;what pitch of perfection a lady golfer might rise&#146;  (Slaughter, 313). At the award presentation ceremony Lady Margaret's acceptance speech was delivered by her father, in keeping with the prohibitions of the day against ladies speaking in public. That the champion was beautiful, charming, and the daughter of a peer, and that her dress, demeanour, and style of play epitomized grace and femininity, helped to quash criticism about competitive golf being unbecoming for ladies and added a touch of glamour that contributed to making the game fashionable and respectable.<br>
<br>The following year in the second championship, 29 May&#150;1 June, Lady Margaret took on a stronger field of more than sixty at the Littlestone club in Kent. Play was from shortened tees on the men's eighteen-hole course &#145;that fairly bristled in sand bunkers, canals, rabbit holes, and endless traps&#146;  (Slaughter, 314). In the final Scott again defeated Issette Pearson &#145;without appearing to exert her powers to any extent&#146;  (Mackern and Boys, 25), confirming her reputation as &#145;a gowfer braw&#146;  (Stringer, <span class="italic">Golfing Reminiscences</span>, 40).<br>
<br>Lady Margaret earned her third consecutive title in May 1895, when she bested a field of eighty-four at the Royal Portrush club in Ireland over the rough and difficult men's course, which was only slightly altered for the occasion. This time she was harder pressed, being forced for once to play the final two holes in a close first-round match against Miss M. E. Phillips. In the semi-final against Mrs Ryder-Richardson she had to &#145;pull up wonderfully&#146;  (Hezlet, 111) after being four down at the turn, in order to move on to the final and victory over Miss E. Lythgoe. With her remarkable unbeaten record intact, Lady Margaret then resigned her golf club memberships and retired. Although she participated occasionally in club matches thereafter, she never played in public again.<br>
<br>By the unanimous consent of her contemporaries, Lady Margaret was in a class by herself among those who competed in the early ladies' championships. Photographs reveal a beautiful, fashionably dressed young woman with a full, easy, confident swing (overswing by later standards). Descriptions of her game as excellent, strong, and finished, and her style as perfect, supple, and powerful yet graceful abound. Neither an exceptional driver nor putter, her greatest strengths as a player were marvellous concentration, coolness, and self-possession, along with a strong, determined grip and easy use of clubs in any kind of lie and outstanding play through the green that was characterized by long, straight drives and crisp, deadly approach shots. Horace Hutchinson, the amateur champion and an eminent writer on golf, was amazed by her ability to &#145;pick the ball off an indifferent, unsympathetic lie with a brassy &hellip; and send it flying straight to the mark &hellip; better than any other lady&#146;  (Hutchinson, <span class="italic">Book of Golf</span>, 202; Hutchinson, <span class="italic">Fifty Years of Golf</span>, 163). The fine quality of Lady Margaret's play helped to alter the conception of the ladies' golf game among sceptical men and set a high standard for other women to emulate.<br>
<br>On 27 April 1897 Lady Margaret married the Hon. Frederick Gustavus Hamilton-Russell (<i>d</i>. 1941), third son of the eighth Viscount Boyne. There were no children. Lady Margaret died at their London home, 3 Cambridge Gate, Regent's Park, on 27 January 1938.<br>
