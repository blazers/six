<span class="headword">Warner,  Ferdinando</span>  (1703&#150;1768), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and writer</span>, was born at Tewkesbury, possibly the son of James Warner, minister at Tewkesbury. He took holy orders, and was ordained deacon by the bishop of Salisbury in August 1727. On 15 December 1730 he was instituted to the vicarage of Rowde, Wiltshire, where he remained for two years. For the next decade his career is hard to trace, although he was married by 1736 when his son was born. He was admitted as a fellow commoner at Clare College, Cambridge, on 19 January 1742. On 13 February 1747 he was appointed to the united rectories of St Michael and Holy Trinity, Queenhithe, London. In that capacity, he preached before the lord mayor on 30 January 1748 and again on 2 September 1749. He attracted some notice from Archbishop Thomas Herring who awarded him a Lambeth LLD in 1754. Herring's death obliged Warner to endear himself to Lord Chancellor Hardwicke and, to a lesser extent, to the duke of Newcastle. These contacts yielded little in practical results, though Warner depicted himself to Newcastle as &#145;having done more notwithstanding in support of Your Grace's administration than any man in England of my Rank&#151;even those whom Your Grace has preferred not excepted&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 32947, fol. 218 11 March 1763). Warner welcomed the duke's return to office in 1765&#150;6 but had no more success in extracting preferment from his patron, though his son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28761/', "John Warner (1736&#150;1800)")</script>, was a beneficiary. He had meanwhile received the rectory of Barnes in Surrey in June 1758 from the dean and chapter of St Paul's Cathedral.<br>
<br>Warner had an eclectic range of interests and published on them all. He began in the field of controversial divinity, editing compendia. The first was <span class="italic">A System of Divinity and Morality</span> (5 vols., 1750), a series of discourses on natural and revealed religion drawn from the writings of Anglican divines, mainly the moderate whigs who were installed in the 1690s, such as Tillotson and Stillingfleet; <span class="italic">A Rational Defence of the English Reformation and Protestant Religion</span> (1752) (dedicated to Archbishop Herring) had extracts from Anglican authors on points of Roman Catholic belief. In 1754 were published <span class="italic">An Illustration of the Book of Common Prayer and Administration of the Sacraments</span> and <span class="italic">A free and necessary enquiry whether the Church of England, in her liturgy &hellip; have not &hellip; given so great an advantage to papists and deists as may prove fatal to true religion</span>, his concern being with some ambiguous expressions in the liturgy too apparently suggestive of transubstantiation and the real presence. He was also the anonymous author of <span class="italic">Advice from a Bishop</span> (1759), intended to be of service to his son, who was on the point of entering the ministry. It was a manifesto for further moderate reformation in the established church. Warner bewailed the &#145;ignorance and sloth&#146; prevalent in the church and used in evidence the failure to obtain subscriptions to his own history of England  (<span class="italic">Advice from a Bishop</span>, 4&#150;6). He was a constant advocate of improved clerical charities, as in <span class="italic">A Scheme of a Fund for the Better Maintenance of the Widows and Children of the Clergy</span> (1752), and <span class="italic">An address to the clergy; with some proposals for raising and establishing a fund &hellip; to make a provision for their widows and children</span> (1755). His later <span class="italic">Letter to the fellows of Sion College &hellip; proposing their forming themselves into a society for the maintenance of the widows and orphans of such clergymen</span> (1765) contained a proposal that was duly accepted.<br>
<br>Warner also tried his hand as a historian, showing some modest success. His <span class="italic">Ecclesiastical History to the Eighteenth Century</span> (1756&#150;7) is the work for which he is best known, with the second volume dedicated to Hardwicke. The latter offered some material help with <span class="italic">The History of Ireland to the Year 1171</span> (1763), only one volume of which was published. Warner worked on original manuscripts in Dublin during 1761. Despite backing from the Dublin Society, the Irish House of Commons extended no financial assistance and he abandoned the project. He made use of the material he collected for <span class="italic">The History of the Rebellion and Civil War in Ireland</span> (1767), a volume which expressed the hope that it would encourage greater religious tolerance in contemporary Ireland. Other miscellaneous writings by Warner were: three sermons; <span class="italic">An imaginary dialogue between Robert Boyle and Lord Bolingbroke, or, A dialogue on the origin and authority of revelation</span> (1755), the piece Warner himself most valued; <span class="italic">Memoirs of the Life of Sir Thomas More</span> (1758), dedicated to Sir Robert Henley, L.K., who helped him secure the living of Barnes; <span class="italic">Remarks on the History of Fingal and other Poems of Ossian</span> (1762); and <span class="italic">A full and plain account of the gout &hellip; with some new and important instructions for its relief, which the author's experience in the gout above thirty years hath induced him to impart</span> (1768). The irony was that Warner died of the disorder on 3 October 1768, within weeks of publication.<br>
