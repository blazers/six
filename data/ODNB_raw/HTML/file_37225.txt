<span class="headword">Bronescombe,  Walter  of</span> <span class="st"> [Walter de Exonia]</span>  (<em>c.</em>1220&#150;1280), <span class="occ">bishop of Exeter</span>, was born in Exeter; of his parentage nothing is known. He was trained at university, no doubt at Oxford, appears to have obtained his first benefice <i>in commendam</i> (Coningsby, Lincolnshire) in 1243, and, probably having been attached to the <i>familia</i> of William of Raleigh, bishop of Winchester (<i>d</i>. 1250), was archdeacon of Surrey by 1245. Between 1245 and 1257 he obtained dispensations to hold several benefices in plurality, which included the rectory of Farnham, annexed to the archdeaconry of Surrey, the rectory of East Clandon in Surrey, the chapel of Bloxworth in Dorset, and a prebend in the king's free chapel of St Nicholas at Wallingford Castle.<br>
<br>During the same period Bronescombe clearly became involved in royal service, for in 1250 he acted for Henry III at the papal curia in securing the confirmation of the highly controversial election to the bishopric of Winchester of Aymer de Lusignan (<i>d</i>. 1260), the king's half-brother; in the following year he was appointed to be the king's proctor at the papal curia. Favour with the king was combined with papal favour, for he was styled papal chaplain by 1250. By 1254 he was a canon of Exeter Cathedral, and became chancellor of the cathedral soon afterwards. His election as bishop of Exeter on 23 February 1258 was apparently undisputed. Royal assent was given on 3 March, and the temporalities were restored on the 6th. Along with the new bishops of Norwich and Coventry and Lichfield, Bronescombe was ordained priest on 9 March and consecrated as bishop on 10 March by the archbishop of Canterbury, Boniface of Savoy (<i>d</i>. 1270). He was enthroned in Exeter Cathedral on 14 April.<br>
<br>In common with most bishops in the thirteenth century, especially those with university training, Bronescombe did not combine his ecclesiastical duties with a high office of state. Even so, he continued in royal service, acting from time to time as royal negotiator and adviser, notably at times of crisis. He gives the strong impression of having been practical and conciliatory, a man who inspired confidence in those with whom he had dealings. He was already in Paris on the king's business during July 1258, and early in 1263 he was one of Henry III's proctors in the French king's court. In these years he was one of a few markedly royalist bishops among a generally Montfortian episcopate.<br>
<br>Between 1263 and 1265 Bronescombe was much involved in treating for peace at home between the king and his barons. When peace came he was one of the committee of six who, having co-opted a further six, devised the settlement: the dictum of Kenilworth of 31 October 1266. On 11 December 1272 he transferred the spiritualities of the see of Canterbury to the new archbishop, Robert Kilwardby (<i>d</i>. 1279), and on the following day was the only bishop recorded as present in London at an important declaration concerning royal rights in respect of the pope's provision of Kilwardby. With the bishop of Winchester he presented Kilwardby with his pallium in May 1273, and immediately set out for Burgundy, to meet Edward I on his return from crusade. He rejoined Edward in Gascony in the autumn, and baptized Edward's son Alfonso, born at Bayonne on 24 November. He then attended the general council at Lyons from May to July 1274, returning to England for Edward's coronation on 19 August. Scarcely any evidence survives to shed light on his particular role during these various activities, but he was clearly a staunch and respected supporter of both Henry III and Edward I.<br>
<br>Bronescombe's diocesan work can be studied in much more detail, for his register is the first extant episcopal register for the diocese of Exeter, and probably in fact the first to be compiled. It reveals a vigorous and conscientious bishop, active in visiting, and often rededicating, the churches of his large diocese. He restored and augmented the collegiate church of Crediton, and founded and endowed another college on a large scale at Glasney in Cornwall, near Penryn, consecrating the church on 27 March 1267; eight years later he endowed a chantry there. In 1268, and again in 1275, he issued statutes for his cathedral church, as he also did for his collegiate foundation at Glasney. Bronescombe is remembered also for his work on the manor house at Bishop's Clyst, where he founded or refounded the chapel and dedicated it to St Gabriel, to whom he had a special devotion. During his last years he was involved in a bitter and ramified dispute with Edmund, earl of Cornwall (<i>d</i>. 1300), in the defence of ecclesiastical rights following the encroachments of the earl and his agents. It was during these years, too, that an eastern extension was begun to Exeter Cathedral, with the addition of a square-ended lady chapel with flanking chapels. From this important beginning a major new project of rebuilding developed, which eventually embraced the whole cathedral. The chapel on the south side of the lady chapel was St Gabriel's chapel, and here on 20 July 1280 the bishop ordained a chantry, where he chose to be buried. Bronescombe died in Bishopsteignton on 22 July 1280, and on his tomb, under the northern arch of his chantry chapel, was placed an impressive monumental effigy, notable for its flowing drapery. An elaborate canopy was added in the fifteenth century.<br>
