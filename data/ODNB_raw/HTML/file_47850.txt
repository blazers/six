<span class="headword">Crackanthorpe <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>Cookson]</span>,  Montague Hughes</span>  (1832&#150;1913), <span class="occ">barrister and eugenicist</span>, was born on 24 February 1832, the sixth son of Christopher Cookson (1791&#150;1834), a cousin of William Wordsworth, of Nowers, near Wellington, Somerset, and Jane (<i>d</i>. 1871), daughter of John Strother Ancrum. He was educated at Merchant Taylors' School, London, where he obtained a scholarship to study at St John's College, Oxford. He had a brilliant academic career, securing a double first in classical moderations and mathematics in 1852 and again in final schools in 1854, and won two university scholarships. He was a fellow of his college from 1850 until his marriage in 1869.<br>
<br>In 1859 Cookson was called to the bar by Lincoln's Inn, and worked for a while with such future judicial luminaries as Farrer Herschell and Horace Davey. He attached himself to the equity court of Mr Justice Fry, where he acquired a leading position, before moving to the court of Mr Justice North. Towards the end of his life he mainly concentrated on cases coming before the House of Lords and the judicial committee. On 6 April 1869 Cookson married Blanche Althea Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 4 June 1928), the younger daughter of the Revd Eardley Chauncy Holt, a cousin of the liberal politician Hugh Childers. The marriage produced three sons, the author <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/38381/', "Hubert Montague Crackanthorpe (1870&#150;1896)")</script>, Dayrell Eardley Montague (1871&#150;1950), who became a diplomat, and the youngest, Oliver Montague (1876&#150;1934), who became an army officer.<br>
<br>Cookson became a QC in 1875, but promotion to the bench eluded him, somewhat to the surprise of those who had once assumed that so brilliant a man would reach the very top of his profession. His obituarist in <span class="italic">The Times</span> attributes this failure to the impression he gave of not taking the law with the wholehearted seriousness shown by some of his competitors, coupled with the distraction of his many outside interests. Nevertheless Cookson was a respected figure in the legal world. He joined the Council of Legal Education and served as chairman of the Council of Law Reporting. He represented the general council of the bar at the International Congress of Advocates at Brussels in 1897 and at the International Congress of the Society of Comparative Legislation in Paris in 1900, where he was nominated for membership of the International Commission on Criminal Sentences.<br>
<br>In 1888 Cookson assumed the name of Crackanthorpe by royal licence upon succeeding to the landed estate of his cousin William Crackanthorpe (1790&#150;1888), who had died unmarried. This bequest brought him the ownership of some 6000 acres at Newbiggin in Westmorland, along with the patronage of its parish. Crackanthorpe enjoyed the traditional life of a landed squire, but on rainy days he would while away the hours wrestling with abstruse mathematical problems, in which he retained an abiding interest. He also kept abreast of contemporary scientific work, about which he was remarkably well informed. Above all, Crackanthorpe relished the role of critic and journalist. He frequently wrote letters on topics of public concern to <span class="italic">The Times</span> and placed a succession of articles in the <span class="italic">Nineteenth Century</span>, <span class="italic">Fortnightly Review</span>, and <span class="italic">Contemporary Review</span>, some of which were later brought together in a book entitled <span class="italic">Population and Progress</span> (1907).<br>
<br>Crackanthorpe's political interests led him to seek a seat in parliament. He stood unsuccessfully for Kensington South in the 1885 general election and for Brixton in the 1886 general election, on both occasions as a Gladstonian, before breaking decisively with the Liberals over the merits of Irish home rule. But Crackanthorpe had a cross-bench mentality which ill fitted him for conventional political life, as had become apparent as early as 1879, when, writing in the <span class="italic">Nineteenth Century</span>, he had advocated the formation of a national party, a theme to which he was to return in the late 1880s.<br>
<br>Crackanthorpe's main claim on posterity lies in his courageous&#151;some contemporaries thought foolhardy&#151;advocacy of the practice of family limitation. This was the theme of one of his most influential articles, &#145;The morality of married life&#146;, published in the <span class="italic">Fortnightly Review</span> in 1872, an article which earned him a reputation as a Malthusian and was later used against him by his political opponents. In retrospect the furore is difficult to understand, since Crackanthorpe always took care to put distance between himself and the controversial Malthusian League, and was simply presenting the case, humanitarian, social, and economic, for a restraint of population growth. In &#145;The morality of married life&#146;, and later, he confined practical information to the recommending of the rhythm method of contraception&#151;in an obscurely worded footnote which cited the works of various medical experts, all of them written in German!<br>
<br>By the start of the twentieth century Crackanthorpe's involvement in population questions was further stimulated by his encounter with the researches of Jacques Bertillon, who had demonstrated that in the urban areas of several European cities a relationship existed between poverty and high fertility. Crackanthorpe concluded that contraception was what he called the &#145;D. E.&#146;, the determining element, in the falling birth-rate among the affluent. He also came under the influence of Sir Francis Galton, the founder of eugenics, who happened to be his London neighbour.<br>
<br>In 1907 the Eugenics Education Society was established, and, following the unexpected resignation in May 1909 of its first president, James Crichton-Browne, it was to Crackanthorpe that its council turned for a successor, in accordance with Galton's expressed wish. Crackanthorpe accepted the offer because he believed that eugenics should be taken out of the scientist's laboratory and publicized more widely, even at the risk of some trivialization. Galton thereupon agreed to associate himself with the society as an honorary president. However, Crackanthorpe was already seventy-seven years of age when he assumed the society's presidency, and he held the post only until 1911. In any case, he was never in the mainstream of Edwardian eugenics. Prior to 1914 most eugenicists rejected all forms of birth control, partly on traditional moral grounds but also out of a belief that restraint was already taking place at the &#145;wrong end of the social scale&#146;, a process which they assumed was leading to the &#145;multiplication of the unfit&#146; and therefore to racial deterioration. Crackanthorpe shared many of these fears, but argued that if the educated classes set a sound example in the responsible control of their own fertility, their social inferiors would quickly follow suit. He also blamed population growth for many of the social problems of the day&#151;overcrowding, unemployment, and the like&#151;and explained Germany's restless ambition on the world stage as the result of its rapid demographic expansion.<br>
<br>Thus, though holding highly conservative views on most political issues, Crackanthorpe is often labelled a reform eugenicist, because he combined eugenic beliefs with a commitment to the traditional liberal causes of peace and progress. He even took a mildly progressive line on female emancipation: &#145;Woman is now wide awake, her long slumber ended; to put her to sleep again is beyond human power&#146;, he proclaimed in 1907  (<span class="italic">Population and Progress</span>, 114&#150;15). Crackanthorpe died at home at 20 Rutland Gate, Knightsbridge, London, as a result of longstanding emphysema and chronic bronchitis on 16 November 1913, shortly before the outbreak of the major war whose advent he had so dreaded. He was buried at All Saints, Ennismore Gardens, London. A close friend described Crackanthorpe as &#145;a man of wide and varied culture and reading, and of a genial temperament&#146;, &#145;a pleasant companion and a most gracious host&#146;. He was survived by his wife.<br>
