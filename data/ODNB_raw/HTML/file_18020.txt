<span class="headword">Donald</span>, sixth earl of Mar  (<em>d.</em> in or after 1297), <span class="occ">magnate</span>, was the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18023/', "William, fifth earl of Mar (d. in or before 1281)")</script>, and Elizabeth Comyn, his first wife. He was knighted by Alexander III at Scone in 1270 and succeeded as earl before 25 July 1281, when his name appears, with other Scots nobles, on the ratification of the treaty for the marriage of Margaret, the maid of Scotland, to Erik, king of Norway. At Scone in February 1284 he was among those who undertook to acknowledge the daughter of that marriage, Margaret, the maid of Norway, as heir to the throne of Scotland in the event of Alexander's death without other issue. Along with many of the barons and prelates of Scotland, he wrote to Edward I of England in March 1290, agreeing to negotiate for the marriage of the king's son to the maid of Norway, and was a signatory to the resulting treaty, signed at Birgham, Berwickshire, in July 1290. After the death of the maid of Norway in September of that year, when different claimants appeared for the Scottish crown, Mar was one of those who was rumoured to be raising forces in Scotland, presumably to support Robert (V) de Brus's claim to the throne. His alignment with the Brus faction is also clearly demonstrated by his involvement with the document known as &#145;The appeal of the seven earls of Scotland&#146;, which seems to have been an attempt to prevent any hasty elevation of John Balliol to the throne. The relationship between the Mar and Brus families was close: Donald's daughter Isabel married Brus's grandson, the future king Robert I, probably in the mid-1290s; it has also been suggested that his son Gartnait married a sister of King Robert.<br>
<br>Mar was an important participant in the Great Cause, the lengthy legal proceedings by which Edward I decided that John Balliol should be king of Scots. He swore allegiance to Edward at Upsettlington, Berwickshire, on 13 June 1291, and acted as one of the forty auditors appointed by Brus to hear the case. He was a witness to Edward's protest at Berwick on 3 July 1292 as to his claim to be lord superior of Scotland. In June 1294 King John, with Mar and other Scottish nobles, was summoned to London to join the English army setting out for France. They did not attend, but instead sent &#145;impotent and brief excuses&#146;  (<span class="italic">Chronicle of Walter of Guisborough</span>, 264). As the Scots prepared to rebel against Edward I in 1295, Mar was one of the council of twelve elected to &#145;advise&#146; Balliol; he was also one of the signatories to the ratification of the treaty of Paris in February 1296. Following the battle of Dunbar (1296) he came to Edward at Montrose, and afterwards swore fealty again at Berwick. He was, notwithstanding, ordered to accompany Edward to England, but was allowed to visit Scotland in June 1297, Edward at the same time exacting from him a pledge that he would serve him against France.<br>
<br>Mar then disappears from the records, and may have died about this time. In December 1297 &#145;Alexander, son of the earl of Mar&#146;, was imprisoned in the Tower of London by order of Edward I. It is not clear, however, if this is Mar's own son or that of his son and successor in the earldom, Gartnait (father of Donald, eighth earl of Mar). Mar married Elena, daughter of the Welsh prince Llywelyn ap Gruffudd, and left at least four children: Gartnait, Duncan, Isabel, and Marjory, who married John, earl of Atholl. A daughter Mary, who is said to have married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/54334/', "Kenneth Sutherland, fourth earl of Sutherland")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/54333/', "Sutherland family (per. c.1200&#150;c.1510)")</script>], may be the same person.<br>
