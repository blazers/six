<span class="headword">Honywood, Sir  Philip</span>  (<em>c.</em>1677&#150;1752), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was the second son of Charles Ludovic Honywood of Charing, Kent, and his wife, Mary, the daughter of a Mr Clement of Portsmouth. The Honywoods were old but minor Kentish gentry who earlier in the century had acquired estates in Essex, at Markshall and elsewhere, which Honywood's elder brother Robert (<i>b</i>. in or before 1676, <i>d</i>. 1735) was to inherit from a distant cousin in 1693.<br>
<br>Honywood was commissioned as ensign into Colonel the Hon. James Stanley's regiment of foot on 12 June 1694, and in the following year saw active service with his regiment at the siege of Namur. In April 1696 he was promoted captain in the Royal Fusiliers, but at the conclusion of the Nine Years' War in 1697 was put on the half-pay list. With the reopening of hostilities with France in 1702 he was commissioned in March that year as captain in the earl of Huntingdon's newly raised regiment of foot (the 33rd foot) and in December 1703 was promoted brevet major. After initial service in Flanders Honywood and his regiment embarked as part of the earl of Galway's expedition to Portugal, and by 1705 he was lieutenant-colonel of his regiment, now under the command of Colonel Robert Duncanson. That spring, during Galway's attack on the frontier town of Valencia d'Alcantara, Honywood courageously led his corps through the breached walls of the town and acted briefly as temporary commander of the regiment when Duncanson was killed. He was none the less superseded in the colonelcy by Colonel (later Field Marshal) George Wade, adjutant-general on Galway's staff. Galway assuaged Honywood's disappointment by assuring him of the next vacant colonelcy, and in the meantime gave him a colonel's brevet. Honywood's conduct at the allied defeat at Almanza in April 1707 earned him appointment to a brigadier's brevet with the command of a battalion and the pay of a colonel, but Galway's promises of a full regimental command remained unfulfilled amid the competing claims of other field officers.<br>
<br>In the spring of 1708 Honywood's mission to convey dispatches from Spain to London and brief the lord treasurer, Sidney Godolphin, first earl of Godolphin, on military progress in the Iberian peninsula provided him with ample opportunity to press his case at the highest level. John Churchill, first duke of Marlborough, commander-in-chief, did not see this as an immediate priority, but Honywood was finally given his own regiment, the 68th foot (lately Colonel Townshend's), on 27 May 1709. Honywood was subsequently transferred to the Flanders theatre, and under Marlborough's eye served in the arduous campaigns of 1709&#150;10. He quickly impressed Marlborough as an officer &#145;who serves here with distinction&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters and Dispatches</span>, 5.135) and was promoted to brigadier in September 1710, though it is likely, too, that his strong whiggish opinions also made their mark with the duke. Before the end of the year, however, Honywood's political outspokenness had cost him his rank and regiment. When the newly installed tory ministers in London, led by Robert Harley, heard reports that Honywood and several other general officers in Flanders were, at their public dinners, &#145;drinking Destruction to the present ministry, and dressing up a hat on a stick, and calling it Harley&#146; and then firing a pistol at the hat  (Swift, 120), Honywood and two colleagues were immediately deprived of their regiments. This sharp reaction, widely publicized, was clearly intended as an example to other disaffected officers as the ministry sought to impose its will on the high command. Now without military employment, Honywood appears to have remained in the Low Countries as a private observer of the closing stages of the war, and during the summer of 1713, following the conclusion of peace, he was at Brussels in the company of Marlborough's son-in-law, John Montagu, second duke of Montagu.<br>
<br>The accession of George I initiated Honywood's rapid restoration to favour, and in October 1714 the king appointed him, along with several other senior officers, to the court post of groom of the bedchamber with a salary of &pound;500. His commission as brigadier-general was renewed in March 1715. As part of the government's plans to augment the army Honywood was directed during the summer to raise a new regiment of dragoons. The 207-strong regiment, known as Honywood's dragoons (later the 11th dragoons), of which he remained colonel for the next seventeen years, was recruited in Essex and based at Colchester. In November he commanded the regiment in the defeat of the Jacobite forces entrenched at Preston, in the course of which he was wounded in the shoulder. Four years later, in September 1719, he led a brigade in the capture of the town of Vigo by Richard Temple, first Viscount Cobham, and the destruction of its dockyard in the joint Anglo-French expedition against northern Spain.<br>
<br>Thereafter Honywood was not to see enemy action again until 1743. Under a political regime committed to keeping the nation out of war, he settled into what was to be a long period of peacetime military routine, the main highlight of which was the annual round of military inspections and reviews. His solid professionalism kept him firmly within the favour of the first two Hanoverian monarchs, which, together with his enjoyment of many aristocratic and military contacts at court, ensured his continued steady rise within the army's senior ranks. He enjoyed particular benefit from his old association with William Cadogan (subsequently Earl Cadogan) during George I's reign, being regarded along with a number of other general officers as one of Cadogan's intimate &#145;cabinet&#146;. In October 1721 he was placed as a brigadier-general on the Irish establishment. The following August, while on command at a training encampment at Hounslow Heath, he attended the state funeral of his old patron the duke of Marlborough. He was promoted major-general in March 1727. In June 1728 George II appointed him governor of the fort of Duncannon in co. Wexford, primarily to compensate him for the loss of his bedchamber post and salary at the king's accession. Further evidence of royal favour came in May 1732 when Honywood was appointed colonel of the King's regiment of dragoons (subsequently the 3rd hussars). In July 1735 he was appointed governor of Berwick upon Tweed and in December promoted lieutenant-general.<br>
<br>Away from military duties Honywood, who never married, devoted much time to equine pursuits. He was a close friend of Charles Lennox, second duke of Richmond (who had married Cadogan's eldest daughter, Sarah), and was a regular guest at Goodwood, belonging also to the Charlton hunt, of which Richmond was master. During the early 1730s he was appointed ranger of Old Windsor Walk and enjoyed the privilege of a &#145;hunting seat&#146; in Windsor Forest. He was also a keen horse breeder, and in one of his recorded triumphs Slammerkin, owned by Lord Walpole, won the Prince's cup at Newmarket in 1735.<br>
<br>By the end of the 1730s continental war with France and Spain had become a distinct possibility, as had the danger of invasion. In May 1740 Honywood was chosen governor of the fortress and garrison of Portsmouth, a key instrument in the coastal defence of southern Britain. During the summer months he was in command of an encampment of five cavalry and three foot regiments at Windsor Forest, one of a series formed across the south-east of England to prepare the army for war. With Britain's eventual entry into the Austrian War of Succession and commitment to lead a &#145;pragmatic army&#146; of allies against France, Honywood was placed in command of the British cavalry and embarked for Flanders in August 1742, the entire force being under the command of John Dalrymple, second earl of Stair. There followed months of inaction, however, before in February 1743 the army began its long eastwards march into Germany. On 26 February Honywood was promoted full general of horse, and in April was made colonel of the King's regiment of horse in fulfilment of a long-held ambition. At the battle of Dettingen on 27 June he was the senior commander in the field after George II and Lord Stair. The cavalry regiments&#151;with one or two exceptions&#151;found it difficult to make any impact in the fighting largely due to their inadequate numbers and to the intensity of the French infantry attack, but there was also a distinct impression that their commanders had given neither a clear nor a strong lead. The lack of generalship was typified by one incident where Honywood's regiment, in turning away from the enemy to regroup, ploughed into the Royal Horse Guards and broke up their formation. The king was nevertheless grateful for his victory and created Honywood and three other generals knights of the Bath, investing them not far from the battlefield on 4 August. Honywood had in fact already solicited a &#145;red ribbon&#146; from Henry Pelham, <i>de facto</i> head of the administration, earlier in the year, citing his recently attained fiftieth year of military service.<br>
<br>Upon Lord Stair's sudden resignation from command of the army a few weeks later, Honywood was appointed as his successor. He was seen as a poor replacement of a much esteemed general, and his known aversion to the guards' regiments won him few admirers among their officers. Although in March 1744 he was directed by the secretary of state, John Carteret, second Baron Carteret, to hold the British troops in Flanders in readiness for fresh action against the French, it was only a matter of weeks before he was replaced in overall command by Field Marshal Wade. His recall from Flanders later that summer marked the end of his participation in the war.<br>
<br>Honywood returned to his duties at Portsmouth, where from 1746 until his death he was much preoccupied with the rebuilding of the garrison fortifications. His long experience as a cavalry commander was called upon in May 1749 when he was chosen to preside over a board of colonels appointed by the king's command to consider changes to the organization and drill of the dragoon regiments. His position near the very top of the military establishment inevitably gave rise to speculation in 1750 that he was to be made colonel of the Royal Horse Guards (on the death of his old friend the duke of Richmond) and promoted to field marshal in 1751, but neither honour was forthcoming. Honywood died on 17 June 1752 at the Governor's House, Portsmouth.<br>
<br>Despite his seniority Honywood has not enjoyed the belated reputation of several of George II's other generals, such as Ligonier, Wade, or Bland, whose careers are linked to specific achievements, on the battlefield or otherwise. Honywood, by contrast, is a prime example of the many general officers who had forged their early careers under Marlborough, and were subsequently obliged to spend long years in senior command in peacetime conditions, doing little more than maintain the standing army as a defensive, policing, and fighting force, often under tight financial constraint. There was little room for generalship to thrive in such conditions, but it was under men of Honywood's plain stamp that the upkeep of the army was preserved in the early and mid-eighteenth century.<br>
