<span class="headword">Hinds,  Samuel</span>  (1793&#150;1872), <span class="occ">bishop of Norwich</span>, was born in Barbados on 23 December 1793, the son of Abel Hinds (<i>d</i>. 1808) and his wife, Elizabeth Thornhill, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Rock (1776&#150;1853). Some members of his family had been among the earlier settlers and chief land and slave owners on the island. He was educated at Charterhouse and then entered Queen's College, Oxford, in November 1811, and graduated BA 1815 (2nd class), MA 1818, and BD and DD 1831. In 1818 he won the chancellor's prize for a Latin essay, and in 1822 he was ordained. He married, in Barbados on 4 April 1821, Eleanor Ann Clinckett (1800&#150;1834), daughter of Abel Clinckett of Barbados.<br>
<br>Early in life Hinds was connected as a missionary with the Society for the Conversion of Negroes. He was for some time principal of Codrington College, Barbados. In 1827 he became vice-principal of St Alban Hall, Oxford, under Richard Whately DD, who had been his private tutor; on Whately's elevation to the archbishopric of Dublin in 1831, Hinds was appointed his domestic chaplain. This office, however, he was obliged to resign owing to ill health, in 1833, when he returned to England. In 1834 he was presented to the vicarage of Yardley, Hertfordshire, which benefice he held with the rural deanery of the district until January 1843, when he was appointed to the vicarage of the united parishes of Castleknock, Clonsilla, and Mullahidart, with the prebend of Castleknock in St Patrick's Cathedral, in the diocese of Dublin. At the same time he again became one of Archbishop Whately's chaplains. In 1846 he was appointed first chaplain to the earl of Bessborough, lord lieutenant of Ireland, and in the following year to the earl of Clarendon, who had succeeded to the lord lieutenancy. He resigned the benefice of Castleknock in September 1848, when he was presented by the crown to the deanery of Carlisle. In October 1849 he was raised to the bishopric of Norwich, on the death of Bishop Stanley, and he held it until 1857, when ill health required him to resign amid comment about his unsuitability for episcopal office  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 31 March 1857).<br>
<br>In 1850 Hinds chaired the royal commission on Oxford University, being appointed by Lord John Russell (who had considered him for the regius chair of divinity in 1847). His chairmanship reflected both his liberal credentials and his competence. His commission's report, in 1852, provided an opportunity of a turning point in the history of the university, of which the latter only partially took advantage.<br>
<br>About 1856 Hinds married his second wife, Sarah Emily, who survived him. He published many sermons, pamphlets, and books of a broad-church character on a variety of subjects, including <span class="italic">History of the Rise and Early Progress of Christianity</span> (2 vols., 1828), <span class="italic">The Three Temples of the one True God Contrasted</span> (1830), <span class="italic">Sonnets and other Short Poems, Chiefly on Sacred Subjects</span> (1834), and <span class="italic">On the Colonisation of New Zealand</span> (1838). He became a promoter of the Canterbury Association to establish a settlement on New Zealand. His <span class="italic">Introduction to Logic</span> (1827) was taken from Whately's <span class="italic">Elements</span>. Several of his works were originally articles in the <span class="italic">Encyclopaedia metropolitana</span>.<br>
<br>Hinds was a man of learning, ability, and engaging character. In politics he was a moderate Liberal, while he represented one of the most &#145;advanced&#146; schools of thought on religious questions, especially during the last few years of his life. He died at 40 Clarendon Road, London, on 7 February 1872, and was buried in Kensal Green cemetery.<br>
