<span class="headword">Napier,  Arthur Sampson</span>  (1853&#150;1916), <span class="occ">philologist</span>, was born at The Hollies, Dean Row Lane, Bollin Fee, Wilmslow, Cheshire, on 30 August 1853, the eldest of the nine children of George Webster Napier (1825&#150;1884), cotton spinner and manufacturer in the firm of Napier and Goodair of Preston and Manchester, and his wife, Martha, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Bridgwood (1827&#150;1904), of Longton, Staffordshire. The family also owned the Mossfield Colliery Company, and his parents managed the firm of Sampson, Bridgwood &amp; Son, Anchor Works, Longton, china, earthenware, and granite manufacturers and millers; his mother was a partner in the firm, along with her sister Mary, until January 1879. The family home, Lightwood Lodge, to the south of Longton, was elegant, comfortable, and well stocked with books. Napier's siblings included Sir Walter John Napier (1857&#150;1945), the attorney-general of the Straits Settlements, and Lieutenant-Colonel George Samuel Frederick Napier (1862&#150;1942), who served with the British army in India and South Africa.<br>
<br>In October 1867 Napier entered Rugby School, where he was a member of the school's natural history society and won prizes for chemistry. But he is later said to have regarded the public-school system at Rugby as &#145;cramping and uncongenial&#146;; and he particularly disliked compulsory games  (Farnell, <span class="italic">An Oxonian</span>, 51). From Rugby he gained an entrance exhibition to study chemistry at Owens College in Manchester, graduating with first-class honours in the London BSc examination in 1873. His choice of chemistry was connected to his family's expectation that he would join their china manufacturing firm after graduation. Between 1874 and 1877, with the benefit of an open scholarship, he undertook a further course of study in chemistry, this time at Exeter College, Oxford, where he took a first class in natural science in 1877. Having studied German at both Manchester and Oxford, he spent a term of the academic year 1876&#150;7 at the University of G&ouml;ttingen conducting chemical experiments, as well as consolidating his knowledge of German. At the same time he began the study of Norwegian. Critically for his future career, he also attended lectures on comparative philology and English philology at Oxford, given by Friedrich Max M&uuml;ller and John Earle.<br>
<br>These linguistic studies proved to be a turning point in Napier's life. By late 1877 he had decided that his future lay not in chemistry, with a guarantee of a managerial position in the family firm, but instead in philology. In February 1878 he was appointed to a two-year post of <i>Lector</i> (which he translated as &#145;reader&#146;) in the department of English at the University of Berlin. The post involved giving classes for at least two hours a week, for example on written and spoken English, and lecturing in German on Shakespeare. The post was renewed for two further years in 1880. He had meanwhile married, on 11 September 1879, Mary Ferrier (1854&#150;1936), second daughter of James Hervey JP (1812&#150;1902) and Elizabeth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Kibble, of Alderley Edge, Cheshire. Three of their six children (five sons and one daughter) were born in Germany.<br>
<br>Napier pursued research in English philology under the supervision of Karl M&uuml;llenhoff (1818&#150;1884), Wilhelm Scherer (1841&#150;1886), and, especially, Julius Zupitza (1844&#150;1895), to whose role as teacher and friend he paid affectionate tribute. In 1883 he obtained the degree of PhD <i>summa cum laude</i> from the University of G&ouml;ttingen for his thesis, supervised by Zupitza, on Archbishop Wulfstan, <span class="italic">&Uuml;ber die Werke des altenglischen Erzbischofs Wulfstan</span> (1882), with the accompanying study of Wulfstan's sermons (1883). In May 1882 he resigned from Berlin and, on Zupitza's recommendation, was appointed by G&ouml;ttingen to the post of <i>ausserordentlicher Professor</i> of English language and literature. He continued in this post until the summer of 1885, when he returned to Britain.<br>
<br>Napier had been encouraged by Zupitza to apply for the newly created post of Merton professor of English language and literature at Oxford. His application, and subsequent appointment, generated a good deal of critical comment, both in public and in private. Some of it was instigated by Henry Sweet, a well-qualified potential candidate for the post, and a scholar who was out of sympathy with the views of Zupitza and his students. Sweet questioned Napier's academic credentials for such a major appointment; other critics queried the juxtaposition of language and literature in the title of the chair, much preferring that it should be literature alone. However, Napier, supported by testimonials from twenty-four colleagues in Britain and Europe, was the unanimous choice of the electors and, despite receiving comparable offers of a chair from the universities of G&ouml;ttingen and Groningen, he accepted Oxford. He was elected a fellow of Merton College, and began work in Oxford in the autumn of 1885, aged thirty-two, and just seven years after formally renouncing chemistry in favour of philology.<br>
<br>Napier's arrival brought a new style of English philological study to Oxford, different from that of, for example, his older colleague John Earle, the professor of Anglo-Saxon: it was strongly influenced by Napier's intimate knowledge of current philological scholarship in Germany. During the course of his career Napier lectured on Old and Middle English texts and dialects, the history of the English language, and, in later years, on English metrics and on Gothic. He concentrated only on the linguistic content of the texts he discussed, without reference, apparently, to any opinions, either of his own or anyone else's, about the aesthetic qualities of such works as <span class="italic">Beowulf</span>, <span class="italic">Pearl</span>, and <span class="italic">Sir Gawayne and the Green Knight</span>. The reason was that he believed strongly that the academic boundaries between linguistic and literary studies had to be respected&#151;a typical German point of view at that time. Thus he interpreted the &#145;literature&#146; element of his post as the linguistic study of literary texts. Whatever his students in general may have thought about his refusal to deal with matters of literary criticism, they generally applauded the quality of his lectures, which took account of the latest research, were sharply focused, and were delivered with clarity and scholarly detachment&#151;even if he was capable of spending three years discussing three pages of the text of <span class="italic">Beowulf</span> in minute detail. Some students, however, found him &#145;dry as dust&#146; and &#145;intolerably dull&#146;  (private information). The special weekly classes that he ran at his house on Headington Hill for senior undergraduate students were, apparently, models of dispassionate and thorough scholarly inquiry. Between 1896 and 1911 he supervised and examined a small number of postgraduate students studying for the BLitt, a newly created graduate research degree; almost all of them were working on Old or Middle English topics.<br>
<br>Napier recognized that the key to encouraging the study of English in the university was to create an undergraduate honours course. An initial proposal, which had his strong backing, to establish a school of modern languages with a strongly philological emphasis was rejected by the university, on a tied vote, in November 1887. More than six years were to pass, to June 1894, before a final honour school of English was on the statute book, the first examination being held in 1896. Napier's resolutely linguistic, as opposed to literary, approach to the new discipline reassured critics who feared that an honour school in English would attract dilettantes: &#145;He was the right man for the time; for the English school was very open to capture by the indolent and the amateur&#146;  (Farnell, &#145;Napier&#146;, 313). In 1903 he was appointed to an additional chair, the Rawlinsonian professorship of Anglo-Saxon, which he held along with the Merton chair until his death. This released funds that enabled the creation, in 1904, of a separate chair in English literature (held by Walter Raleigh).<br>
<br>Napier's published work consisted of various editions of texts, together with articles in journals and book reviews (over a third of them in German) on various aspects of English philology. They included notes (some brief, others in the form of extended commentaries) on, for example, &AElig;lfric, Boethius, the poetry of the Vercelli book, and place names. There were editions of Chrodegang, Theodulf, and Aniane (1916), <span class="italic">Old English Glosses</span> (1900), the <span class="italic">History of the Holy Rood-tree</span> (1894), and <span class="italic">Iacob and Iosep</span> (1916). His edition of Wulfstan's homilies (1883) remained the standard treatment of the subject for more than seventy years. Like several other Oxford dons Napier contributed to the compiling of the <span class="italic">Oxford English Dictionary</span>. Especially in the period 1889 to 1897 he was consulted regularly by the editor, James Murray, for his expert opinion on particular words.<br>
<br>Two of Napier's long-gestating projects that remained unpublished were a historical English grammar, based largely on his lectures on the subject, and a major collation and study of Old English homilies, for which he carried out a good deal of preparatory work, sometimes with the aid of graduate students. The purpose was to extend the corpus of materials that his own thesis on Wulfstan had expounded. The materials finally appeared as <span class="italic">Homilies of &AElig;lfric</span>, under the editorship of John C. Pope, in 1967&#150;8.<br>
<br>President of the Philological Society for the years 1892 to 1894, Napier was an active member of numerous organizations connected with philology and literature, including the Chaucer Society, the Deutsche Shakespeare Gesellschaft, the Modern Language Association, the New Paleographical Society, the Oxford Drama Society, the Shelley Society, the Spenser Society, and the Yorkshire Dialect Society.<br>
<br>Napier was elected a fellow of the British Academy on 29 June 1904, and a foreign honorary member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences on 13 January 1915. He was also a corresponding member of the G&ouml;ttingen Akademie der Wissenschaften. Oxford awarded him the degree of DLitt on 27 June 1901; his brother Walter was awarded the degree of DCL at the same ceremony. Victoria University (Manchester) made him an honorary DLitt on 13 March 1902 as part of the Owens College jubilee celebrations. The University of Groningen made him an honorary DLitt in Dutch language and literature on 1 July 1914.<br>
<br>The most detailed description of Napier's interests and personality was by his long-time friend the Oxford classicist Lewis Farnell, who noted that he was &#145;strikingly handsome&#146;, or, as the Germans put it, &#145;ein bildsch&ouml;ner Mensch&#146;  (Farnell, <span class="italic">An Oxonian</span>, 51). He was keen on foreign travel, walking, horse-riding, and intellectual discussions. The strongest impression, however, was of a &#145;deeply sensitive and devoted friend&#146;  (ibid., 54). Students who studied under him expressed similar views. For relaxation he read detective novels. His health had never been particularly robust, and in his later years younger colleagues deputized for him and delivered his lectures.<br>
<br>Napier died at his home on Headington Hill, Oxford, on 10 May 1916 of apoplexy, and was buried at Headington cemetery on 13 May 1916. Much of his personal library was acquired by the English faculty library at Oxford, thanks to the successful establishment shortly after his death of the Napier memorial library fund by Joseph Wright.<br>
