<span class="headword">Knox,  William</span>  (1732&#150;1810), <span class="occ">government official and pamphleteer</span>, was born at Monaghan, Ireland, the youngest child of Thomas Knox (<i>d</i>. 1760), a physician, and his wife, Nicola, the daughter of John King, of co. Fermanagh. He received his early education in local Church of Ireland schools, and particularly benefited from the tutelage of Philip Skelton, the curate at Monaghan, a respected scholar and author of theological treatises. Some time during the late 1740s or early 1750s he took up residence in Dublin, where he not only attended Trinity College but also received the &#145;first rudiments&#146; of his political education under the patronage of Sir Richard Cox, a prominent member of the Irish House of Commons and a leader of the opposition during the Anglo-Irish political crisis of 1753&#150;6&#151;one of those episodic eruptions of the latent tensions between the Irish parliamentary leaders and the English-dominated executive.<br>
<br>In 1756 Knox, through the influence of his Irish connections, was appointed provost marshal in the colony of Georgia. During the five years he spent in America he became increasingly alarmed by the constitutional practices which prevailed in most of the continental colonies where, as he observed, the lower houses of the legislatures exercised unwarranted sway over governors and their councils. From his perspective as a royal official he viewed such relationships as unduly weighting the balance of colonial constitutions in favour of the democratic elements in America, thus posing a potential threat to the exercise of imperial authority. As a member of the Georgia council from 1757 to 1760 he played a prominent role in the development and implementation of policies and practices which established Georgia as a model royal colony. While in Georgia he also attained the status of a substantial rice planter, who within a decade would earn an income of between &pound;1500 and &pound;2000 per annum from his colonial properties.<br>
<br>Despite the remarkable success that Knox achieved in only a few years in Georgia, his ambitions and attachments drew him back irresistibly towards the centre of the empire. He arrived in London in 1762 during the last stages of the Seven Years' War, and, with his first-hand experience of America, was provided with numerous opportunities to share his expertise with politicians and imperial officials who were attempting to incorporate newly won territories into the expanded empire. Several of his specific recommendations, particularly those regarding a projected colony in East Florida, were incorporated in the proclamation of 1763 which would establish boundaries and administrative structures in the new imperial possessions in America. In London he acted officially as Georgia's colonial agent and for three years conducted the business of the province to the complete satisfaction of his constituents. In 1765, however, the Georgia assembly summarily dismissed him from his agency after he published a defence of the <span class="roman">Stamp Act</span> in the <span class="italic">Claim of the Colonies to an Exemption from Internal Taxation</span>. In this pamphlet, although he questioned the expediency and the equity of the stamp duties, particularly in consideration of the unique circumstances of American colonials, Knox nevertheless simultaneously repudiated the arguments raised in America against the right of parliament to tax Americans. This heresy, by Knox's own account, earned him the honour of being &#145;hung &amp; burn'd in Effigy with Lord Bute and Mr. Grenville at Boston and Savannah&#146;  (Dartmouth MS, D. 1778, 2:1817a).<br>
<br>On 23 September 1765, in Dublin, Knox married Letitia Ford (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1741), the daughter of a fellow Irishman, James Ford. Their marriage was long and contented. They had seven children, three daughters and four sons, and Letitia Knox was a gracious hostess whose hospitality substantially enhanced her husband's social and professional status. She also brought him a &#145;large fortune&#146;  (P. Skelton to W. Knox, 25 Oct 1765, Knox MSS) that was more than sufficient to support his pursuit of an official appointment. During the hiatus following the loss of his Georgia agency his interests were advanced by the patronage of Lord Grosvenor, who was so impressed with his knowledge and ideas about imperial affairs that he provided him with an introduction to George Grenville. The former prime minister, who had also been dismissed from office in 1765 and had subsequently assumed a leading role in the parliamentary opposition to the Rockingham administration and its American policies, found use for Knox's colonial expertise and his talents as a writer of political tracts. In collaboration with Grenville, Knox published two pamphlets that established his reputation&#151;historically as well as contemporaneously&#151;as a major theorist and commentator on imperial policy. The first of these treatises, <span class="italic">The Present State of the Nation</span> (1768), provided the best and most comprehensive expression of his imperial vision&#151;one which postulated an imperial system in which political and economic advantages and responsibilities would be equally distributed to the mutual benefit of Great Britain and the colonies. More specifically he argued that Great Britain, menacingly burdened by enormous debts arising from the successful prosecution of the great war for empire, had every reason to expect that the American colonies, the great beneficiaries of that war, should bear at least part of the escalating costs of defending the expanded empire. In return, he recommended significant concessions to the colonies in keeping with their enhanced status within the empire: allowing them the opportunity to raise imperial contributions by their own means rather than by parliamentary taxation; revising the navigation system to create new trade advantages for American colonies; and providing for colonial representation in parliament. He also expanded the scope of his imperial reforms to encompass Ireland, which was to be assigned obligations and granted concessions commensurate with those extended to the American colonies. Since Knox's <span class="italic">The Present State of the Nation</span> contained explicit attacks on the Rockingham whigs, it not surprisingly drew an immediate response from Edmund Burke, who, in his <span class="italic">Observations on the State of the Nation</span> (1769), categorically rejected Knox's analysis of Britain's fiscal difficulties and, characteristically, dismissed his systematic prescriptions for imperial reform. Contemporary critics none the less praised both Knox's and Burke's works in unison for providing the best published representations of the major competing arguments in the current debate over imperial policy. Within a year Knox published a second tract, <span class="italic">The Controversy between Great Britain and her Colonies Reviewed</span> (1769), which, in its polemical tone and partisan purpose, marked a sudden and drastic departure from the broader perspectives of his earlier work. Apparently alarmed by evidence that the American position on imperial issues was hardening&#151;an impression shared by an increasing number of Britons&#151;and stung by Grenville's uncompromising repudiation of his previous advocacy of concessions for America, he produced a legalistic indictment of the various arguments raised against imperial taxation and uncompromisingly asserted the absolute sovereignty of parliament over the colonies.<br>
<br>In 1770 Knox's reputation as a political pamphleteer won him an appointment as an under-secretary in the American department. Here, in the years before the American War of Independence, by his own account Knox found himself in the remarkable position of promoting both the coercion and conciliation of America. On various occasions he recommended policies of moderation to avoid undue provocation of the colonies; however, as the British government grew increasingly resistant to American rejection of parliamentary authority, the North administration found his talents as a pamphleteer useful in providing published defences of such policies as the <span class="roman">Quebec Act</span> and the <span class="roman">Coercive Acts</span> of 1774. With the outbreak of the American war he not only proved himself an effective administrator: he also contributed to the development of major policies, particularly projects for using loyalist forces in America and proposals for peace settlements. When the strains of war precipitated another serious breach between the Irish parliament and the British government during the years 1778 to 1780, Knox played a prominent role in the campaign of conciliation that kept Ireland from going the way of America. At his urging the North administration adopted many of his earlier recommendations for trade concessions as a means of reconciling the Irish to the imperial connection and also sent him to Ireland, where he assisted in the negotiations that brought an amicable resolution of the crisis.<br>
<br>The end of the American war brought calamity to Knox's private and public fortunes. In America his plantation properties were confiscated by the revolutionary government of Georgia, while at home he was dismissed from office after the Rockingham government, spurred on by his nemesis Burke, dismantled the American department. He experienced a brief but satisfactory reprieve from political exile when, in 1783, acting as an unofficial adviser to the Fox&#150;North government, he drew up the order in council that effectively cut off the valuable American carrying trade with Britain's West Indian colonies. After the fall of this short-lived administration, however, he found himself relegated to the role of supplicant in a lengthy campaign to obtain compensation for his American losses. He maintained an official presence in governmental circles by acting as the provincial agent for the loyalist colony of New Brunswick, but, when the loyalist claims commission honoured his petition for compensation in 1788, he finally withdrew from active politics. During the two decades of his retirement he produced an extraordinary number and variety of publications, ranging over such subjects as slave holding, political reforms in England and Ireland, and theology. He died on 25 August 1810 at his home in Ealing, Middlesex, survived by all seven of his children.<br>
