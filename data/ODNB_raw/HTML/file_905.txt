<span class="headword">Austen,  Ralph</span>  (<em>c.</em>1612&#150;1676), <span class="occ">horticulturist and religious radical</span>, was born into a yeoman family in Leek, Staffordshire; his mother was a cousin of Henry Ireton, the parliamentary leader, a connection Austen repeatedly stressed in his attempts to gain offices or land grants. Austen received no university education (unlike Ralph Austen of Magdalen College, Oxford, a Kentish clergyman who died in 1632), though he became a &#145;privileged person&#146; and lived in Oxford from about 1646 until his death. He helped to enforce the military-backed purge of the university after the siege of 1646, working for the parliamentary visitors as registrar. A religious radical, in 1657 he believed that the &#145;two witnesses&#146; of Revelation had appeared; and in 1660 he encouraged Anabaptists to preach against the restoration of the monarchy. His main vocation, however, was gardening, which he practised for fifty years.<br>
<br>Austen contributed to three areas which, in the millenarian atmosphere of the period, he saw as a single manifestation of godly &#145;light and reformation&#146;. He was a practical nurseryman who greatly increased the range and output of gardens in the Oxford area; he was a radical puritan, rejoicing in the overthrow of the Anglican establishment; and he was a self-taught scientist, who regarded horticulture and fruit-growing as the key to establishing the kingdom of heaven on earth. Like other reformers in the circle of Samuel Hartlib, Austen believed that the nation's problems could be solved by a state-sponsored programme of plantations&#151;supplied by his nurseries and guided by his textbooks. His correspondence with Hartlib served to convey messages from London to other Oxford experimentalists, and also to engage influential statesmen on behalf of these schemes and to publicize his research into new crops and methods of production. Although the government never rewarded Austen's many appeals, the publication of his <span class="italic">Treatise of Fruit-Trees</span> in 1653, 1657, and 1665 did stimulate demand for new plants and orchards, and his letters show increasing confidence in his skill and productivity.<br>
<br>Austen's radical rhetoric subsided after 1660, but he continued to expand his nursery business and to promote his vision of a fruit-eating England. He was particularly renowned for cider production&#151;believing that cider would promote health, allay sedition, and eliminate the call for imported wine&#151;and his customers included Isaac Newton.<br>
<br>Austen's approach to horticulture was innovative, experimental, and sceptical of the authority of theorists; even Sir Francis Bacon was challenged, in <span class="italic">Observations upon some Part of Sir Francis Bacon's Naturall History</span> (1658). Austen taught himself enough botany to enter the controversy about the descent of sap, and he opposed the findings of his friend Robert Boyle. He propagated some seventy-five varieties of fruit-bearing trees, bushes, and vines, and he sowed thousands of timber trees in 1656 to avert a national shortage of wood. His first-hand account of experiments with mulberries and silkworms was published in Hartlib's <span class="italic">Reformed Virginian Silk-Worm</span> (1655).<br>
<br>Austen's <span class="italic">Treatise of Fruit-Trees</span> is as much a revolutionary manifesto and a spiritual autobiography as it is a technical handbook. The horticultural part comprised one of the most systematic and detailed treatments of the subject published in England up to that time, and was preceded by an enthusiastic list of proposals to make England &#145;another <i>Canaan, flowing with Milke and hony</i>&#146;  (Austen, <span class="italic">Treatise</span>, fol. 2<i>v</i>); the <span class="italic">Treatise</span> was followed by <span class="italic">The Spirituall Use of an Orchard or Garden of Fruit-Trees</span> (expanded to book length in 1657 but dropped in 1665 on Boyle's advice). In this devotional exercise on the gardener's work, Austen portrayed wild trees as unregenerate souls and young shoots as believers grafted into Christ; alternatively the stock was the Old Adam and the graft was the spirit of Christ. In a moving passage inspired by the bareness of the trees in winter, Austen, like John Bunyan, also described a period of despair in his own life. The high fruit-yield of small trees proved to him that low-born &#145;mechanic preachers&#146; made the best ministers and that the established clergy had to be hacked down; the debris of pruning denoted the violent political changes of the revolution, which Austen welcomed as a guarantee that the coming season's crop would be good and that England would soon become the apocalyptic kingdom he desired.<br>
<br>Austen died in October 1676 at his home, 30 Queen Street, Oxford; he had no children, and left his leasehold and cider factory to his wife, Sarah. He was buried on 26 October in St Peter-le-Bailey parish church, Oxford; plans to erect a memorial to this local hero and horticultural pioneer never materialized.<br>
