<span class="headword">Hill,  Thomas Ford</span>  (1753&#150;1795), <span class="occ">antiquary</span>, was born on 21 September 1753, the son of George Hill, glove manufacturer of Worcester, and his wife, Elizabeth. He was a Quaker, and intended for a commercial life in the linen trade. After serving an apprenticeship at Pontefract, he was taken into the house of Messrs Dawson and Walker in Cornhill, London, probably securing the position because Walker, also a Quaker, was his brother-in-law. During this period Hill seems to have lived with his mother at Ely Place in London, where she had moved from Worcester after her husband's death.<br>
<br>Hill soon abandoned business for literature and antiquities, and in 1780 he made an antiquarian tour through Scotland. On this tour he collected Erse songs, which he published together with a description of his journeys in the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> of 1782 and 1783. These were held to be a valuable contribution to the &#145;Ossian&#146; debate, on which Hill maintained a largely neutral stance. The songs he collected were privately printed as <span class="italic">Antient Erse poems, collected among the Scottish highlands, in order to illustrate the Ossian of Macpherson</span> in 1784. In 1784 he visited the continent, residing at Geneva to learn French, and afterwards exploring the mountainous district of Savoy. In 1787 he went on to Italy to pursue antiquarian studies and was in Rome by February that year. His portrait was painted in Rome by Gavin Hamilton. During his five years abroad he became acquainted with eminent scholars and with Cardinal Borgia and Prince Kaunitz; he travelled to Ravenna, Venice, Prague, the Netherlands, and various places in Germany. In 1790 he was back in London, where he rented a house in Charlotte Street, Portland Place. He made two other journeys to the continent in 1791 and 1792, when he travelled through a greater part of Germany, and also visited Paris. He published in 1792 a work on current events in France, which a reviewer in the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> found too favourable to the Revolution. In the same year he was elected a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries. He returned to Italy in 1794, and died on 16 July 1795 at Ariano in Apulia, worn out by the difficulties he had encountered on his journey to Calabria earlier that year.<br>
