<span class="headword">Chadwick,  Hector Munro</span>  (1870&#150;1947), <span class="occ">literary scholar</span>, was born on 22 October 1870 at the vicarage, Thornhill Lees, Yorkshire, the third son of the Revd Edward Chadwick and his wife, Sarah Anne Bates, whose father had been in business in Oldham. Far the youngest child, he claimed that his sister, Dora, &#145;brought me up&#146;  (Navarro). From Wakefield grammar school he went, as Cave exhibitioner, to Clare College, Cambridge, in 1889, and became a scholar the following year. In 1892 he was placed in the third division of the first class of part one of the classical tripos. He had, however, been developing individually. As a day boy with an 8 mile trip into Wakefield and back each day, he had taught himself German on the train journeys, and his exceptional qualities began to appear when in 1893 he was placed in the first class of part two of the classical tripos, with distinction in the philology section, and was elected a fellow of his college. From 1895 he taught for section B of the medieval and modern languages tripos, the subjects of which ranged over the whole background of Old English.<br>
<br>In 1899 Chadwick's first book, <span class="italic">The Cult of Othin</span>, appeared, already exhibiting the highest linguistic and archaeological competence in collecting evidence, together with remarkable ability in discerning the significant patterns which evidence yielded in combination. <span class="italic">Studies on Anglo-Saxon Institutions</span> followed in 1905, and <span class="italic">The Origin of the English Nation</span> in 1907 (reprinted 1924). In 1909 the board of medieval and modern languages at Cambridge reported that &#145;it would be of advantage to the University and a fit recognition of the scholarship and learning of Mr. Chadwick&#146; if a university lectureship in Scandinavian were created for him. Quite exceptional as such a step then was, the advice was taken and the appointment made in 1910. In 1912 Chadwick published <span class="italic">The Heroic Age</span>. Its main achievement was to bring together early Teutonic with Greek heroic poetry, to the better understanding of both. There were also &#145;Notes&#146; on Slav and Celtic heroic poetry, indicative of the widening scope of Chadwick's studies. In 1912 he succeeded W. W. Skeat in the Elrington and Bosworth chair of Anglo-Saxon, which he occupied until 1941. He loved to recall the founder's wish that the subject should not be Anglo-Saxon only but &#145;the languages cognate therewith, together with the antiquities and history of the Anglo-Saxons&#146;. The war years which followed gave opportunity to reconsider the studies carried on under the medieval and modern languages board. Modern linguists were declaring that Britain had been a tight little island too long, and needed a living interest in other peoples rather than academic concentration on language. Chadwick saw in this both reason and opportunity for removing English studies from the school of modern languages, and, at the same time, reshaping the study of the origins and background of English literature, so as to make philological scholarship serve the knowledge of history and civilization. For this far-reaching reform of Cambridge studies, Sir Arthur Quiller-Couch declared, in the Senate House, nine-tenths of the credit was due to Chadwick.<br>
<br>On 4 May 1922 Chadwick married Norah (1891&#150;1972), a former pupil, the daughter of James Kershaw, a cotton-mill owner of Farnworth, Lancashire, and his wife, Emma Clara, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Booth. (She was later, as <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/50646/', "Norah Kershaw Chadwick")</script>, to become a fellow of Newnham College, Cambridge.) Their marriage established a most remarkable literary partnership, of which their <span class="italic">Growth of Literature</span> (3 vols., 1932&#150;40) is an abiding monument. Meanwhile the study of modern English literature at Cambridge had greatly developed, and in 1927 Chadwick took the opportunity to transfer his department to the new faculty of archaeology and anthropology, where his group of studies might, like the classics, constitute an independent discipline. On reaching the age limit in 1940 he continued as head of the department until 1945. His last works were <span class="italic">The Study of Anglo-Saxon</span> (1941), <span class="italic">The Nationalities of Europe and the Growth of National Ideologies</span> (1945), and <span class="italic">Early Scotland</span>, which was unfinished when he died, at the Evelyn Nursing Home, Trumpington Road, Cambridge, on 2 January 1947, but was published by his widow in 1949. There were no children of the marriage.<br>
<br>Chadwick was elected FBA in 1925, and received the honorary degrees of DLitt from Durham University (1914) and Oxford (1944) and of LLD from St Andrews in 1919. His talent as a teacher is reflected in some thirty of his pupils who held university posts.<br>
