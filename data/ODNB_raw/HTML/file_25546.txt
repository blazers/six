<span class="headword">Sikes, Sir  Charles William</span>  (1818&#150;1889), <span class="occ">banker</span>, was born on 15 February 1818 in Huddersfield, the second son of Shakespear Garrick Sikes, banker, and his wife, Hannah, daughter of John Hurst of Huddersfield. In 1833 he entered the office of the Huddersfield Banking Company, in 1837 became cashier, and in 1881 managing director.<br>
<br>In 1850 Sikes wrote anonymously to the <span class="italic">Leeds Mercury</span> to propose the establishment of savings banks, and in 1854 developed his proposals in a pamphlet entitled <span class="italic">Good Times, or, The Savings Bank and the Fireside</span>. A state savings bank had been proposed on a number of occasions in the past, by Jeremy Bentham in one instance, who suggested the creation of &#145;frugality banks&#146;. Sikes's initial proposal was to reform the existing trustee savings banks, which were run by local trustees on a voluntary basis; all deposits were handed to the national debt commissioners who paid interest at a fixed rate. The problem was that the hours of opening and coverage of the banks were inadequate, and Sikes's solution was to utilize mechanics' institutes as &#145;feeders&#146; to the nearest trustee savings bank, with a central guarantee fund to provide security. The Yorkshire Union of Mechanics' Institutes adopted his suggestion, but it was clearly only a partial solution. In 1859, in an open letter to the chancellor of the exchequer, William Gladstone, he suggested that the Post Office should take on the role of &#145;feeder&#146;, remitting sums of &pound;1 and above to a central savings bank in London by means of its existing money-order system; in return, depositors would receive &#145;interest notes&#146; paying 2&frac12; per cent. Sikes assumed that the central bank would be a separate institution, and that the existing transfer services of the Post Office would simply offer a means of providing an adequate coverage of the country.<br>
<br>The plan was drawn to the attention of Rowland Hill by Edward Baines, one of the members for Leeds, and it became the basis of a dispute within the Post Office on the limits of state action. On the one side Rowland and Frederic Hill insisted that the money orders should pay the full rate, and that transfers should be limited to multiples of &pound;1, so as to prevent any competition with commercial banks in transmitting money or with the trustee savings banks, and to remove the danger that it would be a distraction from the main business of the Post Office. On the other side were Frank Ives Scudamore and George Chetwynd, who were eager for the Post Office to expand, particularly where competition between public and private concerns was possible as a guarantee of efficiency. Sikes's scheme was transformed by Chetwynd and Scudamore, in opposition to the Hills, whose caution was overruled by the postmaster general: money orders and interest notes were abandoned, and the Post Office simply entered deposits, of any amount, in a bank book; funds were transferred to a central Post Office Savings Bank which was an integral part of the department.<br>
<br>This expansion of the Post Office was accepted by Gladstone as a solution to the financial problems of the trustee savings banks. The national debt commissioners paid more to the banks than was received from investment in government securities, and Gladstone's attempt to resolve this problem had resulted in deadlock. The Post Office Savings Bank offered a solution, for deposits were transferred to the national debt commissioners which paid only the actual interest earned. The Post Office Savings Bank started operation in 1861, in a form far removed from the suggestion of Sikes, whose proposal had fortuituously coincided with the tussle between minimalists and expansionists within the Post Office, and with Gladstone's desire to prevent the trustee savings banks from imposing a financial drain. Sikes was knighted in 1881 in recognition of his role in the creation of the Post Office Savings Bank. He died unmarried on 15 October 1889 at his home, Birkby Lodge, Huddersfield.<br>
