<span class="headword">Balfour,  Nancy</span>  (1911&#150;1997), <span class="occ">journalist and arts administrator</span>, was born near San Francisco, California, USA, on 17 May 1911, the daughter of Alexander Balfour and his wife, Ruth Macfarland. Brought up in England, she was educated at High Wycombe School, and Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford, where she read philosophy, politics, and economics: she later gave significant works of modern British art to her Oxford college. She worked at the research department of the Foreign Office during the war, and subsequently at the North American desk of the BBC until 1948. But the majority of her professional career as a journalist and editor was devoted to <span class="italic">The Economist</span>, where she was to become assistant editor in charge of the American survey, and was nicknamed Colonel Balfour; she was abrasive, frank, and hectoring, and particularly enjoyed a good argument with no holds barred. Although not a gourmet, she entertained extensively: small dinner parties and larger cocktail gatherings; a guest, apologizing the day after a discussion at one of her gatherings had seemed to get out of hand, was reassured by Nancy that the noisy argument had been immensely enjoyable, and just what she liked. Surprisingly, for all her frankness in private she was often muted in public, and could quite calmly sit silent through an entire committee meeting, returning to the fray behind the scenes. She was awarded the OBE in 1967.<br>
<br>Nancy Balfour retired at just over sixty to devote herself to the cause of contemporary art, and to continue to follow her other passion, that of an international tourist and traveller: her recreations, self-defined in her <span class="italic">Who's Who</span> entry, were &#145;sightseeing, ancient and modern; viewing work by living artists&#146;. She set up the Nancy Balfour charitable trust to support working artists. Her vocation was to support contemporary art, in which activity Nancy was both officially and unofficially involved: as a member, honorary secretary, chairman (1976&#150;82), and president of the Contemporary Art Society, founded in 1910 by Roger Fry and other Bloomsbury luminaries to purchase and present contemporary works of art to public museums and galleries. She was an ardent collector. With independent means, she lived in a comfortable flat in Eaton Square, Westminster, London, surrounded by contemporary works of art, some major, but a great many in a minor key in terms of size, and sometimes of quality: charming, delightful, but inconsequential. &#145;I know what I like and that is why I buy&#151;if I can afford it. As I live alone, I have no one to consult but myself.&#146; She described herself as &#145;a compulsive, but perhaps not very discriminating collector&#146;. She always bought work by living artists, and sometimes bought work purely as a gesture of support. She never bought in auctions, but deliberately bought from galleries as a gesture of support to the market which often took risks on the young unknowns, and occasionally from artists' studios, although she disliked having to approve or disapprove in front of the artist himself. She had an interest in contemporary decorative arts and served on the Crafts Council, where she was vice-chairman from 1983 to 1985. She was also a founder member of the British American Arts Association.<br>
<br>Those who worked with Nancy at times compared her to a very small terrier, nipping at their heels to make sure that they did what she saw not only as necessary, but as essential. In this context her irreverent nickname was Gnasher and little was beyond her to make sure the job was done: she was not above going through the desk of her administrator at the Contemporary Art Society. She preferred to work behind the scenes, not only chivvying, but bringing people together who would not otherwise have met for their mutual benefit.<br>
<br>Nancy also chaired SPACE, an organization dedicated to finding workable studio space for artists, often in schools and warehouses awaiting redevelopment; she was on the board of the Public Art Development Trust (1983&#150;91), the moving force behind the arts committee of <span class="italic">The Economist</span>, encouraging temporary exhibitions of sculpture on its plazas in St James's and works of art on its walls, a tradition carried on by the Contemporary Art Society after her death. In old age she was still a determined city walker, visiting East End studios and West End galleries. She took no pleasure in country life, and was bemused when her niece became involved with the Ramblers Association. When she retired from <span class="italic">The Economist</span> she became a visiting fellow of the Kennedy Center for Government at Harvard University (1973&#150;4).<br>
<br>Under Nancy's leadership the Contemporary Art Society pioneered specialist cultural travel for its members and set up a consultancy to advise businesses on corporate art collections, both innovations taken up in the wider art world. She was numerate, realistic, and practical, the least sentimental of characters: it was typical that not only should she leave, after personal bequests, her art collection to the Contemporary Art Society but that she left to the society's discretion what should be given to museums and galleries and what should be sold to benefit the society. She died at her home, 36E Eaton Square, Westminster, on 29 August 1997. She was unmarried.<br>
<br>Nancy was short of stature, extremely hard-working, indefatigably curious, and possessed of unusual tenacity and determination. She dressed elegantly in couture clothes tailored to her diminutive but full-busted figure and until the end of her life kept her neatly coiffed hair ash blonde. She was unusually robust: until her final illness she had been in hospital only once as an adult.<br>
