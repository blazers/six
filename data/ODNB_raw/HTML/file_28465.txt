<span class="headword">Walkelin</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1098), <span class="occ">bishop of Winchester</span>, was one of the Conqueror's chaplains but the claim that he was his kinsman is unsubstantiated. William of Malmesbury tells a story of Archbishop Maurilius of Rouen being concerned with his early career; hence Walkelin the future bishop is probably to be identified with the Walkelin, canon of Rouen, who attests a charter of Maurilius, dated to between 1055 and 1066, in favour of Chartres. Following the deposition of the pluralist Stigand by the papal legate, <i>c</i>.11 April 1070, Walkelin was appointed by the king to the see of Winchester, to which he was consecrated on 30 May by the legate Ermenfrid. Immediately on entering office, Bishop Walkelin sought to replace the monks in his cathedral by canons. This would seem to suggest that he realized the true nature of the problem for a contemporary bishop in that most English of institutions, the monastic cathedral: that is, how to pay the household if the resources of the church were in the main directed to the support of monks. Initially he obtained the support of the king, as well as that of most of his colleagues, for this tactic. His good relations with the Conqueror are evident from the story related by the Winchester annalist, in which William, having granted to Walkelin as much timber as he could take from the wood of Hempage in three days and nights, allowed himself to be appeased after the bishop, with the help of many carpenters, had cut down the entire wood. However, Lanfranc, appointed archbishop of Canterbury later in 1070, successfully resisted this policy. A somewhat embittered narrative of Bishop Walkelin's deeds is placed in the mouth of his successor, Bishop William Giffard, and recorded in the St Swithun's Priory cartulary. Walkelin is said to have divided the goods of the see between himself and the convent and to have appropriated 300 librates of the monks' share of the land for his grandiose building plans, as well as the patronage of all the priory's churches for these same purposes.<br>
<br>Walkelin's principal monument is his building work, for no written material issued in his name appears to survive. His was the decision to destroy the Old Minster church in Winchester, the principal church of Anglo-Saxon Wessex (if not of England in its entirety), and to replace it with the vast Norman cathedral, much of which survives today. The plan was huge in contemporary terms: with a length of almost 180 yards, Walkelin's Winchester was rivalled only by the Cluny III of St Hugh. The work began in 1079 or 1080; the Winchester annalist claimed that the new church was consecrated and the monks took possession of it on 8 April 1093 but the evidence of modern archaeology is that only the eastern portion of the church, and possibly the crossing, could have been completed by then, the remainder not being finished until <i>c</i>.1122, under Walkelin's successor, William Giffard.<br>
<br>Under Rufus, Walkelin remained involved in politics in the royal service&#151;in 1097, shortly before his death, he was appointed regent along with Ranulf Flambard (<i>d</i>. 1128) when the king left England. He continued to attest royal charters, as would be expected while Winchester and the crown-wearing ceremony there at Christmas remained an important manifestation of royal authority. When the dispute between the archbishop of Canterbury and the king concerning papal authority first arose, Walkelin was one of the bishops who tried to persuade Anselm not to pursue his demands for leave to visit Rome. On the occasion of the consecration of Battle Abbey (11 February 1094) he obtained permission for St Giles's Fair, one of the five or six great fairs of medieval England, a major source of wealth for the see and crucial for the economic development of his cathedral city in the twelfth century. Little or no evidence survives on which to base an assessment of Walkelin's career as a diocesan. It is known that he consulted Ernulf of Rochester, an acknowledged expert on canon law, when in difficulty on a point of marriage law. The text of Ernulf's reply, in which it is made clear that Walkelin's point was originally raised in discussion at Canterbury, and not in writing, still survives. In April 1095 the monks of Bury St Edmunds, doubtless to the chagrin of his colleague Hermann, the bishop of Thetford, called in Walkelin to officiate at the translation of the bones of their patron saint. Following this event Bishop Walkelin issued an indulgence, which proved extremely popular.<br>
<br>Walkelin made his brother Symeon prior of St Swithun's Cathedral Priory, and as such, the latter was doubtless a great assistance to him in his dealings with his monks. The narrative of Walkelin's deeds purporting to be issued by William Giffard stresses that it was this link which made the division of the goods of the see a practical proposition. In 1093 Symeon became abbot of Ely. Walkelin's nephew, Gerard, who also began his career in the church of Rouen, was successively bishop of Hereford and archbishop of York. Walkelin died on 3 January 1098.<br>
