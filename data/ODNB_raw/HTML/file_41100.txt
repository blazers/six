<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Asquith,  Raymond</span>  (1878&#150;1916), <span class="occ">scholar and army officer</span>, was born on 6 November 1878 in John Street, Hampstead, the eldest of the five children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30483/', "Herbert Henry Asquith (1852&#150;1928)")</script>, later prime minister and first earl of Oxford and Asquith, and his first wife, Helen (<i>d</i>. 1891), daughter of Frederick Melland of Manchester. Academically gifted, he was educated at Winchester College (1892&#150;7) and at Balliol College, Oxford (1897&#150;1902), winning scholarships at both institutions. As well as being president of the Oxford Union (1900), he won the chief university prizes, including the Ireland, Craven, and Derby scholarships, and took first-class honours in classics and law. With characteristic aversion to self-importance, he wrote to a friend on receiving news of his first that &#145;this stirs no emotion in me&#146;  (Jolliffe, 80).<br>
<br>Asquith was one of those men &#145;whose brilliance in boyhood and early manhood dazzles their contemporaries and becomes a legend&#146;  (Buchan, 57), a legend enhanced by his war record and courage in battle. At Oxford he was the leader of a circle which included Harold Baker, the cousins Aubrey and Auberon Herbert, and John Buchan, who was later to describe the group in print, mentioning in particular their &#145;scrupulous avoidance of parade&#146;, and claimed that &#145;in the world of action we were ready for any venture; in the things of the mind we were critical and decorous, chary of enthusiasm&#146;  (ibid., 53&#150;4). The hero of Buchan's novel <span class="italic">The Half-Hearted</span> (1900) is loosely based on Asquith, to whom the novel is dedicated. A much lesser light in the circle, the solicitor E. S. P. Haynes, commented that although Asquith &#145;was sometimes thought cold and cynical I would like to record that his kindness and friendliness to me never varied&#146;  (Jolliffe, 31). Asquith became a fellow of All Souls in 1902, an honour he prized greatly, although, like his other successes, he appeared at the time to wear it lightly. The <span class="roman">Balliol College war memorial book</span> (vol. 1) records that &#145;some of his contemporaries may have equalled him in intellectual strength, but none came near the variety of his gifts&#146;. Apart from his talent as a classical scholar, he had a fluent and distinctive style in prose and verse, in speech and oratory, and most memorably in his letters of which many hundreds have survived. A good example of his light-hearted vein is in his poem &#145;In Praise of Young Girls&#146;, a pastiche of Pope in thirty heroic couplets, contrasting old and new fashions in seduction. The following brief extract gives a flavour of the whole:<blockquote>
<div>When Mona Lisa posed with rustic guile<br>
</div>
<div>The stale enigma of her simple smile,<br>
</div>
<div>Her leisured lovers raised a pious cheer<br>
</div>
<div>While the slow mischief crept from ear to ear.<br>
</div>
<div>Poor listless Lombard, you would ne'er engage<br>
</div>
<div>The brisker beaux of our mercurial age,<br>
</div>
<div>Whose lively mettle can as easy brook<br>
</div>
<div>An epic poem as a lingering look.<br>
</div>
<div>Our modern maiden smears the twig with lime<br>
</div>
<div>For twice as many hearts in half the time.<br>
</div>
</blockquote>Asquith's own experience was in sharp contrast to either of the fashions which he describes. In 1901 he met Katharine Frances Horner (1885&#150;1976), daughter of Sir John and Lady Horner [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/49524/', "Horner, Frances Jane")</script>] of Mells, Somerset. A long courtship, occasioned by her youth and his lack of money, was eventually followed by marriage on 25 July 1907. Two daughters were born, in 1908 and 1910, and a son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/103465/', "Julian Edward George Asquith")</script> who eventually succeeded his grandfather as second earl of Oxford and Asquith, was born in 1916. Asquith's outstandingly happy marriage brought to light his capacity for deep feeling and personal commitment, always present in his character but which he concealed in youth, giving rise at times to a mistaken impression of cynicism.<br>
<br>In 1904 Asquith was called to the bar at the Inner Temple, but he had a low tolerance for the dull work required of juniors and little professional ambition. His first long case was on an arbitration on the Newfoundland fisheries at the International Court at The Hague. He spent four months at The Hague in 1910, commenting &#145;the Zoo here is very bad too. There is practically nothing in it but a chiff-chaff (called in Dutch Tjif-Tjaf)&#146;  (Jolliffe, 176). By 1914 he had been made junior counsel to the Inland Revenue, and in the previous year he was adopted as Liberal candidate for Derby, where the sitting member was retiring. He made a series of speeches there, but his political career was cut short by the war. Although distrustful of dogmas of all kinds, he was keen to address the genuine problems of the day.<br>
<br>Suspicious of rhetoric, not least of the kind abundantly generated on the outbreak of war in August 1914, Asquith soon decided that it was a matter of honour, at the age of thirty-six, to enlist in the army, and in January 1915 joined the Queen's Westminster rifles. Fretting at the dreariness of the jobs the Westminsters were given, and frustrated by the prospect of not seeing active service, he transferred as a lieutenant into the 3rd battalion of the Grenadier Guards in July 1915, and went out to France in October. In an early letter to his wife from the front he noted the contempt felt for staff officers behind the lines by those in the trenches, and felt that she would think he was right not to become one, adding with tragic irony, &#145;though of course one may find in the end that there are more uncomfortable things than general abuse&#146;  (<span class="italic">Raymond Asquith</span>, 205). As the winter of 1915 drew on, discomforts inevitably increased. These he vividly described, but claimed to &#145;take the same sort of interest in it as an ill-tempered tourist may take in an uncomfortable hotel&#146;  (ibid., 217). He did his best to withstand attempts by his father, the prime minister, to transfer him onto the general staff but for four months (late January to May 1916) was posted, against his wishes, to general headquarters of the British expeditionary force, where he served unenthusiastically in intelligence work. He returned to his regiment in the line to take part in the Somme offensive of July, with all its dangers of constant shelling, sniping, and mortar bombs. Facing these with unfailing courage and cheerfulness he would seize any brief interval to write home with graphic descriptions of his daily life.<br>
<br>On 15 September, as the guards division advanced from Ginchy on Lesboeufs, Asquith was hit in the chest by a bullet. An eyewitness recorded that in order to prevent his men from knowing the worst at once, he lit a cigarette after he fell, before being given morphia. He died on the way to the dressing station, and was buried in the war cemetery on the Guillemont Road. A private soldier wrote home that<blockquote>there is not one of us who would not have changed places with him if we had thought that he would have lived, for he was one of the finest men who ever wore the King's uniform, and he did not know what fear was. (Jolliffe, 296&#150;7)</blockquote>In a letter of sympathy to his widow, Winston Churchill referred to Asquith as &#145;my brilliant hero-friend&#146;, and wrote to the prime minister that &#145;His was a character of singular charm and distinction&#151;so gifted and yet so devoid of personal ambition, so critically detached from ordinary affairs yet capable of the utmost willing sacrifice&#146;  (ibid., 297). This confirms all the other evidence that it was for what he was, rather than for what he did, that Raymond Asquith occupied a unique place in the admiration and affection of his generation.<br>
