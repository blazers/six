<span class="headword">Chilham, Sir  Richard  of</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1246), <span class="occ">soldier</span>, commonly termed Richard fitz Regis or fiz le Roy, occasionally as Richard of Dover, and exceptionally as Richard de Warenne, was the illegitimate son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/14841/', "King John")</script> and one of the sisters of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28739/', "William (IV) de Warenne, earl of Surrey (d. 1240)")</script>. He was probably born in the 1190s, and he was the only one of John's illegitimate children to gain honorific title, following his marriage on or before 10 July 1214 to Rose of Dover, daughter and heir of Fulbert (II) of Dover. Thereby he became lord of the castle and honour of Chilham, Kent, consisting of about fifteen knights' fees in Kent and also Essex. It is not always easy to distinguish Richard from his namesake and half-brother, Richard, earl of Cornwall (<i>d</i>. 1272), especially before the latter's assumption of the titles count of Poitou (1225) and earl of Cornwall (1227), and from another Richard of Dover (<i>d</i>. 1244/5). Knighted in 1215, Richard of Chilham served as a royalist captain and administrator during the civil war between 1215 and 1217. His most important appointment was as constable of the strategically vital castle of Wallingford and as custodian of its honour, comprising some 120 knights' fees. He held the position from June 1216 at the latest to at least March 1218, and then again, if he ever surrendered it, from May 1218, when he was granted the honour at royal pleasure. He appears to have held it until 1227, although when he went on crusade he resigned the castle, at least, to the king, his seneschal answering for the honour on his behalf. From 1217 until 1221 he was also sheriff of Berkshire, Henry de Scaccario accounting for him at the exchequer.<br>
<br>Chilham's single most important action occurred during the critical sea battle off Sandwich on 24 August 1217, when the English royalist naval forces engaged the French fleet bringing equipment, supplies, and reinforcements to Prince Louis of France in support of his bid for the English throne. Chilham commanded one of the ships in the battle and brought his vessel alongside the flagship of the French fleet, commanded by Eustace the Monk. Chilham and his men boarded this vessel, the largest and most formidable of the enemy ships, and, according to Roger of Wendover, it was Chilham himself who beheaded Eustace once he had been captured. Other sources, closer to events, suggest otherwise, although they do not deny the importance of Chilham's action in the engagement. The victory was crucial in obliging Louis to come to terms, thus ending the war. Richard departed on the fifth crusade to Egypt in 1218, presumably in the company of the other English crusaders known to have sailed at this time. That he duly reached the crusaders' camp at Damietta is proved by the fact that in 1228 he was pressed to repay money that he had borrowed there. He returned home in 1220 or, more likely, 1221.<br>
<br>Clearly trusted by his father, Richard of Chilham never seems to have enjoyed a close relationship with Henry III, although he received occasional gifts from his half-brother, and he played only a limited role in affairs following his return from the East. He apparently accompanied the royal forces who fought the Welsh in 1223 and went on pilgrimage to Canterbury with Alexander II, king of Scots, in the same year, although in both cases it may have been Richard of Cornwall who is meant in the records. In 1225 he was certainly one of the collectors in Kent of the tax of the fifteenth granted for the campaign in Poitou that year, and in 1230 was granted a judicial protection in view of his accompanying Henry III on his campaign in Brittany that year. His final significant action occurred in May&#150;June 1242 when he, with William Bardrolf, was specially deputed to lead the seaborne operations against the notorious outlaw, pirate, and would-be regicide William de Marisco, who with his accomplices had based himself on Lundy island in the Bristol Channel, plundering shipping, taking ransoms, and committing robberies on land. Marisco and his associates were successfully captured, and most were subsequently executed in London. Chilham died in 1246, his widow, Rose, performing homage to the king, on or before 24 June, for all the lands that Richard had held in chief of the inheritance of Rose. They left a son, Richard (<i>d</i>. before 1265), and a daughter, Isabel, to whom the honour of Chilham passed.<br>
