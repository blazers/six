<span class="headword">Brown,  Myra Eleanor  Sadd</span> <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Myra Eleanor Sadd]</span>  (1872&#150;1938), <span class="occ">women's rights activist and internationalist</span>, was born on 3 October 1872 in Maldon, Essex, the tenth of eleven children of John Granger Sadd and Mary Ann Price. The family ran a firm of timber merchants and processors in Maldon, and were noted for their innovative ideas: the firm owned what is believed to be the first traction engine in Essex, which caused some local controversy, with fears of damage to bridges and frightening livestock. They also built an electric power station to supply the factory, and eventually the town.<br>
<br>Myra Sadd was educated privately at a school in Colchester. One of her interests was cycling; through this she met Ernest Brown (1868&#150;1931), a co-founder of a firm supplying bicycle parts, whom she married on 21 July 1896. An interesting feature of the wedding was the colour scheme of purple, white, and green, twelve years later to become the suffragette colours, which might be seen as foretelling the future of Myra Sadd Brown (like many couples of progressive convictions at this time, Myra and Ernest combined their surnames). The couple moved to London, first to Finsbury Park, then to Hampstead. They had three daughters and one son. The firm of Brown Brothers rapidly met with success and diversified into electrical appliances and motor car manufacture, assuring Myra Sadd Brown of a degree of independence.<br>
<br>Myra Sadd Brown came from a progressive and independent-minded Congregationalist background; later in life she became a Christian Scientist. She had a keen interest in artistic matters. She was an enthusiastic follower of George Bernard Shaw's plays, and had a number of artistic acquaintances, including William Somerville, Henry Holliday, and Jessie Mothersole; she was even described as keeping a salon. However, her most enduring mark has been as a women's rights activist. Her convictions date back before her marriage; she is believed to have bought a small cottage in order to claim the vote as a ratepayer. She also became a poor-law guardian for Hackney. She was very active in the women's suffrage movement; she became a member of the militant Women's Social and Political Union, being arrested and imprisoned in 1912, on which occasion she went on hunger strike and was forcibly fed. She was a keen propagandist for the suffrage cause, her letters appearing in such periodicals as the <span class="italic">Christian Commonwealth</span>. Later, she was associated with Sylvia Pankhurst's East London Federation of Suffragettes; her eldest daughter, Myra Stedman, recollected being recruited to stand on street corners selling the <span class="italic">Woman's Dreadnought</span>. She would invite bus loads of east London women to visit her house near Maldon.<br>
<br>Myra Sadd Brown was also genuinely interested in other cultures and other countries. She regretted her lack of knowledge of foreign languages, and insisted on her children learning French and German. On several occasions she went with her husband, whose heart had been weakened by rheumatic fever in childhood, to winter in Italy and Egypt. After the First World War she became an active member of the International Woman Suffrage Alliance (later the International Alliance of Women). She travelled widely in Europe to conferences, usually accompanied by her eldest daughter.<br>
<br>Another major interest was the evolving Commonwealth. As early as 1923 Myra Sadd Brown had been involved in meetings which in 1925 led to the formation of the British Commonwealth League (later the Commonwealth Countries League), a feminist organization devoted to the upholding of women's rights in Commonwealth countries. She became treasurer of the league, less because of her skill at double entry bookkeeping than because of her ability to use her funds to guarantee the lease on the league's premises.<br>
<br>Myra Sadd Brown's husband died of rheumatic heart disease in 1931. In 1937 she went on an extended visit to south-east Asia, to be present at the birth of her second grandchild, and extended the tour to visit Angkor Wat and Malaya. She continued the journey to Hong Kong, planning to return via the Trans-Siberian Railway, but suffered a stroke on the way, and died in Kowloon Hospital, Hong Kong, on 13 April 1938. She was cremated the following day at the Hindoo crematory, Happy Valley, Hong Kong.<br>
<br>As a memorial, the British Commonwealth League established the Sadd Brown Library of material on women in the Commonwealth as part of the then Women's Service Library (now the Women's Library). Her active interest in the Commonwealth Countries League, and the International Alliance of Women, has been maintained first by her daughter Myra Stedman, and subsequently by her granddaughter, Diana Dollery, both of whom have been closely involved in the development of the Sadd Brown Library.<br>
