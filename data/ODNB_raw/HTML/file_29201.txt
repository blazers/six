<span class="headword">Whichcord,  John</span>  (1823&#150;1885), <span class="occ">architect</span>, was born on 11 November 1823 at Maidstone, Kent, the son of John Whichcord (1790&#150;1860), an architect who designed two churches (St Philip and Holy Trinity), the corn exchange, and the Kent fire office in Maidstone, and various churches, parsonages, and institutions elsewhere in Kent. His father was also surveyor to the county of Kent and to the Medway Navigation Company, for whom he executed extensive hydraulic works, some tidal locks, and a number of bridges.<br>
<br>Whichcord was educated at Maidstone and at King's College, London. He was married twice, the first time to an Italian woman. He had seven children. In 1840 he became an assistant to his father, and in 1844 a student at the Royal Academy. In 1848 he was elected a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries. After extensive travel in Italy, Greece, Asiatic Turkey, Syria, Egypt, and the Holy Land (1846&#150;50), and a tour of France, Italy, Germany, and Denmark (1850), he entered into a partnership (until 1858) with Arthur Ashpitel. Together they carried out additions to Lord Abergavenny's house, Birling, Kent (1852), and built fourteen houses on the Mount Elliott estate at Lee, also in Kent (1858). Subsequently most of his output was concentrated upon the design of offices in the City of London; he was responsible for 9 Mincing Lane, 24 Lombard Street, 8 Old Jewry, Mansion House Chambers, the New Zealand Bank, and the National Safe Deposit, all in Queen Victoria Street, and Brown Janson &amp; Co.'s bank, Abchurch Lane. He built the Grand Hotel at Brighton (1862&#150;4) and the Clarence Hotel at Dover, as well as St Mary's Church and parsonage at Shortlands, near Bromley, Kent. One of Whichcord's best-known works is the St Stephen's Club (1874), a classical building with boldly corbelled projections which faces Westminster Bridge. He designed the internal fittings for the house of parliament at Cape Town. He was often employed as an arbitrator of disputes connected with government contracts, and was one of the surveyors to the railway department of the Board of Trade.<br>
<br>From 1854 Whichcord held the post of district surveyor for Deptford, and from 1879 to 1881 was president of the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA), where he delivered various addresses and papers. The <span class="italic">Transactions</span> of the RIBA (1845&#150;80) record his instrumental role in the establishment of the examination system. Whichcord's publications include <span class="italic">The History and Antiquities of the Collegiate Church of All Saints, Maidstone</span> (1845); <span class="italic">Observations on the sanitary condition of Maidstone, with a view to the introduction of the act for promoting public health</span> (1849); and, with A. Ashpitel, <span class="italic">Observations on Baths and Wash-Houses</span> (2nd edn, 1851) and <span class="italic">Town dwellings: an essay on the erection of fireproof houses in flats; a modification of the Scottish and continental systems</span> (1855).<br>
<br>In 1865 Whichcord unsuccessfully stood as a Conservative candidate for the Barnstaple constituency. He also served with the Kent yeomanry and in 1869 became a captain in the 1st Middlesex artillery volunteers, where he formed a battery composed mainly of young architects and lawyers. He died at his home, 23 Inverness Terrace, London, on 9 January 1885, and was buried at Kensal Green cemetery, London. His second wife, Marian Emma, survived him.<br>
