<span class="headword">Hitchins,  Malachy</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1741, <em>d.</em> 1809), <span class="occ">astronomer</span>, the son of Thomas Hitchins, was born at Little Trevince, Gwennap, Cornwall, where he was baptized on 18 May 1741. His mother was a sister of Thomas Martyn, the compiler of a map of Cornwall, and the missionary Henry Martyn (1781&#150;1812) was his cousin. The topographical writer Richard Polwhele, a friend of Hitchins, says that he worked first as a miner, but went to Exeter to assist Benjamin Donn in the creation of his map of Devon, which was published in 1765. Hitchins had previously contributed mathematical replies to the <span class="italic">Ladies' Diary</span> for 1761. In December 1762 he was residing at Bideford. On 10 October 1763 he matriculated at Exeter College, Oxford. Polwhele says that the expenses of his university education were met by his wife, Joanna Hawkin, whom he married on 10 January 1764 at Buckland Brewer, Devon. Hitchins did not, however, graduate BA until 27 February 1781; in 1785 he was incorporated at St John's College, Cambridge, where he graduated MA in the same year.<br>
<br>The first British <span class="italic">Nautical Almanac</span> was that for the year 1767. It was edited by the astronomer royal, Nevil Maskelyne, who devised a &#145;cottage industry&#146; system of computation whereby all important calculations were done twice, by two &#145;computers&#146; working quite separately in their own homes; these two sent their results to Maskelyne at Greenwich, and he would forward them to the &#145;comparer&#146; for checking the one against the other. Late in 1767 Hitchins was recommended to Maskelyne by Thomas Hornsby as a possible computer, which he became in 1768. In 1769 he became the comparer, a post he retained, working in Cornwall, until his death forty years later.<br>
<br>From April to August 1769 Hitchins was at the Royal Observatory, Greenwich, temporarily acting as Maskelyne's assistant in the place of William Bayly, who went to Norway in order to observe the transit of Venus on 3 June. Hitchins himself successfully observed the transit in the eastern summer house at Greenwich with the Revd William Hirst. While at Greenwich he entered holy orders, and after moving to Exeter was for a short time vicar of Hennock. On 6 November 1775 Bishop Keppel presented him to the vicarage of St Hilary, Cornwall, and on 23 May 1785 to that of Gwinear. Hitchins retained both livings until his death.<br>
<br>In 1793 there occurred a crisis in the affairs of the computers of the <span class="italic">Nautical Almanac</span> when the board of longitude decided that, because much improved astronomical tables were about to be produced in France, the <span class="italic">Nautical Almanac</span> should in future be published five, rather than ten, years in advance. (That for 1804 was already published.) Hitchins petitioned the board:<blockquote>Having been employed for 26 years past by the Hon. Board of Longitude in computing and revising the <span class="roman">Nautical Almanac</span> &hellip; he is sorry to find that he is now suddenly and unexpectedly to lose his Appointment for 7 or 8 years to come, and perhaps for ever. (CUL, RGO MS 14/22, fol. 221)</blockquote>In the event, work was found for the computers, but their income was much reduced.Hitchins assisted Polwhele with his <span class="italic">History of Cornwall</span>, published between 1803 and 1808. He was a friend of Davies Gilbert, a fellow Cornishman who became president of the Royal Society. Hitchins died at St Hilary on 28 March 1809 and was buried in the church there.<br>
<br>Hitchins and his wife had four sons. The eldest, Richard Hawkin Hitchins (1764&#150;1827), was a fellow of Exeter College, Oxford, and rector of Baverstock in Wiltshire. The youngest, <a name="cosubject_13372"></a><span class="headword">Fortescue Hitchins</span>  (1784&#150;1814), born at St Hilary on 22 February 1784, became a <span class="occ">solicitor</span> at St Ives. He published a number of poems and other slight works, admired in their day, and compiled material for a history of Cornwall, which after his death was edited by Samuel Drew and published in 1824. He died at Marazion on 1 April 1814.<br>
