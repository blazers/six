</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Redmond,  John Edward</span>  (1856&#150;1918), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born on 1 September 1856 at Ballytrent House, co. Wexford, an old family mansion. He was the elder son of William Archer Redmond MP (<i>d</i>. 1880) and his wife, Mary, daughter of Major Hoey of Hoeyfield, co. Wicklow. Of his sisters, one (who died young) became a nun of the order of Marie R&eacute;paratrice and the other married L. G. Howard, an Englishman in New South Wales. The Redmonds were an established Catholic gentry family in the county and had long been associated with Wexford town. One of the family became member for Wexford in 1859 and on his death in 1872 was succeeded by his nephew Redmond's father, a supporter of the home-rule policy of Isaac Butt.<h2>
<a name="Familyinfluencesandearlycareer"></a>Family influences and early career</h2>Redmond's family heritage was rather more complex than that of most of his colleagues in the nationalist political class. His mother came from a protestant and unionist family and, though she converted to Catholicism on marriage, she never converted to nationalism. His uncle General John Patrick Redmond, who had inherited the family estate, was created CB for his role during the Indian mutiny; he disliked his nephew's involvement in agrarian nationalism of the 1880s. John Redmond liked to boast of his family's involvement in the 1798 rising in co. Wexford: a &#145;Miss Redmond&#146; had ridden to the support of the rebels, and a moderate Father Redmond was hanged by the yeomanry, as was a maternal ancestor, William Kearney. But another ancestor, William Redmond, had been on the yeoman side and John Redmond's nationalist colleague John Dillon privately insisted that the Redmonds of the 1790s had been prosperous drapers who were even more conservative than their protestant neighbours.<br>
<br>From 1868 to 1874 Redmond and his brother Willie were educated by the Jesuits at Clongowes Wood, co. Kildare, where John was regarded as the best speaker in the college debating society and performed the lead in school plays. After leaving Clongowes, he entered Trinity College, Dublin, but left in 1876 to live with his father in London, with a view to becoming a barrister. He acted as his father's assistant at Westminster; even at this stage, politics was more of a fascination than law. Redmond's father inclined to the conservative nationalism of Isaac Butt, but in 1877&#151;in a gesture which reflects above all the sentimentalism which surrounded the Fenians a decade after their spectacularly unsuccessful rising&#151;he took his two sons to the reception in a London hotel to mark the release of a celebrated Fenian prisoner, Michael Davitt. This seems to have been John Redmond's first recorded political act. In 1880 he took up a paid clerkship in the House of Commons; though there is a suggestion of familial pressure in the opposite direction, he increasingly identified his fortunes with those of C. S. Parnell, a noted &#145;obstructionist&#146; in the House of Commons and president of the Land League movement founded in 1879.<h2>
<a name="Politicsinthe1880s"></a>Politics in the 1880s</h2>In the spring of 1879 Redmond attended with Parnell the meeting at Enniscorthy, when the supporters of the then representative for Wexford County, The O'Clery, attacked Parnell's platform. After Redmond was knocked down by the crowd, Parnell commented drily &#145;well, you have shed your blood for me at all events&#146;  (Bew, <span class="italic">John Redmond</span>, 8). When his father died later in 1880, Redmond sought Parnell's support as the natural replacement as the MP for Wexford. Parnell, however, insisted that his then secretary, Tim Healy, was the better candidate. Reluctantly swallowing his disappointment, early in the next year Redmond was to become the official candidate for New Ross in a by-election, and was returned unopposed. On election (31 January 1881) he rushed straight away to the House of Commons, where there were stormy scenes following the arrest of Michael Davitt, by then a Land League leader. The next day Redmond took his seat, made his maiden speech, and was expelled from the House of Commons all on the same evening.<br>
<br>The Land League conflict now entered a very turbulent phase; unlike most of the other Parnellite lieutenants, Redmond managed to stay out of gaol. This, in part, reflected Wexford's relatively low-key involvement in agrarian disturbance. Even the beleaguered Irish government regarded him as decent and moderate. In early 1882, by luck in the ballot, he won first place for a bill to amend the <span class="roman">Land Act</span> of 1881; his bill became the focus of attempts to reach a compromise between the Land League and the government and played a part in the events leading to the Kilmainham &#145;treaty&#146; of 1882.<br>
<br>In early 1882 Redmond and his brother Willie were sent to Australia on a fund-raising mission; despite bad publicity resulting from the Phoenix Park murders, the trip was a success, both in political and personal terms. Not without arousing local jealousy&#151;expressed in a fist fight on the eve of the wedding&#151;he and his brother married into the prosperous Daltons, an Irish-Australian family, with Redmond marrying Johanna Dalton in September 1883. She died in early 1889, having borne Redmond three children; but it was a happy, if short-lived, marriage. Although he was to use more extreme language on American trips in 1884, 1886, and 1904, the Australian trip had an enduring moderating effect on Redmond's political outlook: in part, because as William O'Brien noted in 1886, he found his contacts with Irish-American extremism daunting. Impressed by the success of Irish Australians such as the Daltons, he now embraced an Irish version of Liberal Imperialism; he was always anxious, for example, to retain Irish representation at Westminster even after the implementation of home rule. During the debate which followed Gladstone's conversion to home rule in 1886, he declared:<blockquote>As a Nationalist, I do not regard as entirely palatable the idea that forever and a day Ireland's voice should be excluded from the councils of an empire which the genius and valour of her sons have done so much to build up and of which she is to remain. (D. Gwynn, 55)</blockquote>In 1888, following an unusually strong and conceivably intimidatory speech, Redmond received five weeks' imprisonment with hard labour. Having belatedly qualified as a barrister (he was called to the Irish bar in Michaelmas 1887), he now busied himself with agrarian cases; he was involved in an appeal in such a case to the Clonmel county court judge in November 1890, when he heard of the news of Parnell's decision not to contest the O'Shea divorce petition. As he immediately told a journalist friend: &#145;I don't know what you will do but I'll stick to Parnell&#146;  (<span class="italic">Freeman's Journal</span>, 9 March 1918). This he did, despite his very conventional Catholic religious views, though some detected a wavering when he did not attend&#151;as advertised&#151;Parnell's last public meetings. Following Parnell's death, and by now the undisputed leader of Parnellism, he resigned the Wexford seat which had been his since the <span class="roman">Redistribution Act</span> of 1885, and stood unsuccessfully for Cork, which Parnell had represented. He did, however, win a seat in Waterford a few months later, on 23 December 1891.<h2>
<a name="LeaderoftheParnellitesandpartyreunion"></a>Leader of the Parnellites and party reunion</h2>As leader of the small Parnellite minority of MPs, Redmond pushed policy in a novel conciliatory direction&#151;though hints of his approach can be found in Parnell's increasingly moderate speeches of 1890&#150;91. He also dropped all interest in agrarian radicalism and, unlike the mainstream nationalists, worked alongside Unionists in the recess committee of 1895 which led to the establishment in 1899 of the department of agriculture. After the democratization of Irish local government in 1898, he argued that Parnellite voters should use some of their electoral clout to return public-spirited non-nationalists&#151;the &#145;policy of toleration&#146;, as it was known. In 1899 Redmond married his second wife, Ada Beesley, an English protestant who later converted to Catholicism (but only after his death).<br>
<br>In 1900 the split in parliamentary nationalism was healed. Redmond was elected chairman of the new party but he was never granted the authority and prestige of true leadership by powerful colleagues such as John Dillon, William O'Brien, Tim Healy, and Joe Devlin. Leadership was at best a balancing act; following the amicable land conference of 1903, involving landlord and tenant leaders, the benign and imaginative Wyndham <span class="roman">Land Act</span> of 1903 was passed. Redmond, in tune with his characteristic themes of the 1890s, was inclined to see a great opportunity for a new strategy of conciliation of those in Ireland who were traditionally suspicious of nationalist objectives. Dillon in his famous &#145;Swinford revolt&#146; blocked any such move; William O'Brien urged Redmond to follow his own deepest convictions but, fearing another split, he quietly endured Dillon's diktat. He was also weakened at that moment by the general bad publicity arising out of the price he had originally sought for the sale of the family estate inherited from General Redmond: it seems also that General Redmond had so arranged his will that the inheritance was financially and politically a burden.<h2>
<a name="HomeruleandtheLiberals"></a>Home rule and the Liberals</h2>The Liberal landslide of 1906 gave an increasingly rotund Redmond renewed opportunities for working with, rather than against, the grain of government policy. He was privately keen to accept the scheme of devolution offered in 1907, but a convention of his party insisted that only the full measure of Gladstonian home rule was acceptable. Redmond also had to accept with great reluctance the revival of agrarian radicalism in the ranch war of 1916&#150;10 but help was at hand. The closely fought general elections of 1910, combined with the destruction of the veto power of the House of Lords, gave him the balance of power at Westminster and thus the ability to pursue a Dublin parliament more seriously. In February 1912 the third <span class="roman">Home Rule Bill</span> was introduced; Redmond had at last become a nationalist hero of Parnellite stature. But like many of his colleagues in the nationalist leadership, he knew little of Ulster and the intensity of Unionist sentiment there. Protracted attempts to broker a compromise with the Unionist leader, Sir Edward Carson&#151;with whom he had always had good personal relations, based on shared experiences at Trinity College, Dublin, and the Irish bar&#151;eventually failed at the Buckingham Palace conference of July 1914. Many feared that Ireland was drifting towards massive civil strife as Unionist and nationalist volunteers drilled openly and armed; but the First World War intervened. Redmond reacted in a precisely calculated fashion when, in exchange for prime minister H. H. Asquith's commitment to place the <span class="roman">Home Rule Bill</span> on the statute book (and to make some later provision for Ulster), he supported the British war effort. His reasons were complex; he had a niece who was a nun in Belgium and this led him to sympathize profoundly with the anti-German cause. He also hoped that common sacrifice by Irish nationalists and Unionists would bring them closer together; even if not, Irish nationalists could not afford to allow the Ulster Unionists to cash the benefits of being the only &#145;loyal&#146; faction in Ireland. Nevertheless, following his declaration of a pro-British policy at Woodenbridge, the Irish Nationalist Volunteers split; a large majority, calling themselves &#145;national volunteers&#146; supported him but a vocal and increasingly influential minority, the Irish Volunteers, broke away and provided the cadre for the Easter rising of 1916. Until Easter 1916&#151;judged by the steady, if decidedly unspectacular, electoral success of the Irish Parliamentary Party in every contested Irish by-election&#151;he held the support of a majority of nationalists for this approach. He felt strong enough to turn down the offer of a cabinet place in 1915, even though this would have given him greater opportunity to influence the War Office, which he felt was guilty of insensitivity in important matters of Irish military symbolism. It would also have &#145;balanced&#146; Sir Edward Carson's appointment to the war cabinet. Redmond flew the union flag alongside the green flag at Augavanagh; and he was the first to sing the national anthem at Westminster social gatherings while some of his fellow countrymen looked on in disbelief.<h2>
<a name="TheEasterrising1916anditsaftermath"></a>The Easter rising, 1916, and its aftermath</h2>Despite friendly warnings from Bonar Law and others, Redmond had not expected the Easter rising and certainly felt that the execution of the inner core of its radical nationalist leaders was just. Later in 1916, and finally and most gallantly at the 1917 Irish convention representative of the principal political interests in the country, he made desperate efforts to broker a new compromise with Irish unionism but, as public opinion in nationalist Ireland turned decisively against his party, these efforts had little chance of success; Unionists clearly perceived that he could no longer deliver on his side of any bargain. A series of blows fell that were political but with a bitter personal element. His brother Willie died gallantly at the front, but in July 1917 his seat in East Clare was won by Eamon de Valera, the most senior surviving commandant of the Easter insurgents. In September de Valera's campaign organizer, Thomas Ashe, died on hunger strike; Redmond's son-in-law Max Green was chairman of the general prisoners' board and involved in key decisions concerning the Ashe case. Inevitably, Max Green became the object of much caustic nationalist comment. Redmond himself was assaulted in the street by a crowd of young Dublin Sinn F&eacute;in supporters, including C. S. &#145;Tod&#146; Andrews, one of the most single-minded (some would say narrow-minded) apparatchiks of the approaching new revolutionary order.<br>
<br>Redmond had a conciliatory agenda&#151;&#145;a plea for concord between the two races that providence has designed should work as neighbours together&#146;&#151;as he expressed it in his final words in parliament. But this agenda often remained hidden as he was forced to pursue the twin objectives of survival and party unity. As Warre B. Wells, one of his biographers, explained:<blockquote>In retrospect, one sees the dominant purpose of his political life as a recurrent <i>motif</i> of gathering force: the Recess Committee, the Land Conference, the Convention, that last chance of recovering the lost and misused opportunity which the war created&#151;in these episodes most unmistakably the purpose grows and broadens. (Wells, 204)</blockquote>But &#145;in retrospect&#146; is the key phrase here; Redmond's public purposes were often unclear; for every moderate speech there was a militant counterpart. Above all, during the Ulster crisis, he seems to have accepted the concept of a (non-time limited) county opt-out from the home-rule scheme, but failed to give it real political expression until it was too late. There is an Irish nationalist view that he was &#145;let down by everyone&#146;, in particular the Ulster Unionists, the British tories, and both the British government (especially Lloyd George) and the War Office during the war. But this is to ignore the well-advertised convictions of the Ulster Unionists, the relative indeterminacy of view among the British tories on the eve of the home-rule crisis, and the priorities of the British war machine, locked as it was in a life or death struggle with imperial Germany. Redmond, it should not be forgotten, was supremely confident and optimistic on the eve of the Easter rising; it was the insurrection which destroyed his plans, as he himself always acknowledged. He was allowed one posthumous victory of note: his son Captain William Archer Redmond retained his Waterford seat in 1918, despite the Sinn F&eacute;in landslide, in part because of his father's excellent record as a local member. Indeed, the family's strong political influence survived in Waterford well into the 1930s, as a reminder of a more cosmopolitan and relaxed form of nationalist politics in which an Irish parliament existed for democratic reasons, not to fulfil some intense racial and cultural agenda handed down by history.<br>
<br>Aloof, often a recluse at Parnell's old shooting lodge when in Ireland, Redmond had a distinctive Irish political temperament that can be detected in an elegant phrase by Alexander Sullivan: &#145;He was slow, cautious, cynical, with a prejudice in favour of truth that was almost English&#146;  (p. 137). His health was permanently affected by an accident in 1912. By mid-1917 he was visibly in decline; an operation in March 1918 to remove an intestinal obstruction followed, after which he at first made good progress but then suffered heart failure. He died a few hours later in a London nursing home at 8 York Place on 6 March 1918. After a funeral mass in Westminster Cathedral his remains were interred in a family vault at St John's graveyard in Wexford town.<br>
