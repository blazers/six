<span class="headword">Bligh,  Thomas</span>  (1685&#150;1775), <span class="occ">army officer and politician</span>, was born on 15 January 1685, the second son of Thomas Bligh (<i>c</i>.1654&#150;1710) of Rathmore, co. Meath, Ireland, and his wife, Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1737), the daughter of Colonel James Naper, of Longhcrew, co. Meath. His father, a grazier by origin who was granted lands under the Williamite confiscations of 1688, was MP for County Meath (1695&#150;1710) and was made a privy councillor by James Butler, second duke of Ormond. His elder brother, John (1683&#150;1727), who was in 1725 created earl of Darnley, was buried in Westminster Abbey. Thomas Bligh was often entitled &#145;honourable&#146; by contemporary writers, as if he were the younger son of an earl. He was returned to the Irish parliament as member for Athboy, co. Meath, in 1715, and held the seat for sixty years.<br>
<br>In 1717 Bligh purchased a captaincy in the 6th Irish horse (later the 5th dragoon guards). His promotion to lieutenant-colonel of the regiment in October 1719 owed much to his uncle Lieutenant-General Robert Naper, colonel of the regiment. In 1737 he married Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1759), the daughter of John Bury of Shannon Grove, Limerick. Their only child died young. In 1740, having failed to secure the colonelcy of his regiment upon the death of his uncle, Bligh was appointed colonel of the 20th foot, which served in Flanders during the War of the Austrian Succession (1740&#150;46). In 1745 he became brigadier-general, and commanded in a very sharp action at the causeway of Melle when marching to reinforce the garrison of Ghent. In 1746 he was transferred from the 20th foot to the 12th dragoons, in 1747 he became major-general, in December the same year he was transferred to the colonelcy of his old regiment, the 5th dragoon guards, which had then become the 2nd Irish horse, and in 1754 he became lieutenant-general.<br>
<br>In July 1758 preparations were made on an extensive scale for another descent on the French coast, to create a diversion in favour of the army under Prince Ferdinand of Brunswick in Germany. Against his better judgement, and under pressure from Pitt's government, Bligh (now aged seventy-three) accepted command of the expedition, in place of Lord George Sackville and the duke of Marlborough, who successfully lobbied to be sent with the British forces to Germany&#151;a command Bligh had expected to fill upon his arrival in London. The fleet under Howe, with the troops under Bligh on board, left England at the beginning of August 1758, and in seven days arrived in Cherbourg Roads. The troops were landed and Cherbourg was captured, but Bligh and his staff showed themselves inadequate leaders of men. The harbour, piers, and forts of Cherbourg were destroyed as ordered, but the troops were allowed to plunder and pillage the surrounding area with devastating effect, and the plans for re-embarkation had to be drawn up and supervised by Howe. The troops took with them Cherbourg's brass ordnance as trophies. On 3 September Bligh landed his force at St Luniare in preparation for a siege of St Malo. While the infantry were being disembarked a reconnaissance revealed that the plan to force a passage across the River Rance was impracticable. A sudden change in the weather forced the fleet to weigh anchor with the artillery and horse still on board. It was then decided to march the infantry a short distance westwards to the Bay of St Cast, where the fleet would be waiting.<br>
<br>However, the march was poorly conducted, the condition and morale of the line regiments had deteriorated, and there were considerable losses from harrying French militia. The expedition reached Matignon, inland from St Cast, on 11 September and the fateful decision was taken to make camp rather than re-embark immediately. Intelligence was received during the night of an approaching French force under the command of the duc d'Aiguillon which was of similar size. Instead of slipping away quietly in the night, Bligh and his staff waited until break of day, announcing their plans to the enemy with the drumming of the reveille. The first troops were embarked at 9.00 a.m. By 11.00 a.m. three brigades of the line together with the wounded were on board when the French appeared on the heights above. They were met by the rear guard, now stranded on the beach, consisting of the Grenadier Guards and the grenadier companies of the line regiments, under the command of Major-General Alexander Dury. Despite inflicting severe casualties upon the French, the bulk of this force (approximately a thousand men) were either killed, wounded, or taken prisoner. Dury was among those who drowned in a desperate attempt to swim out to the boats.<br>
<br>Bligh was severely censured for his conduct in the affair. He was criticized by the commander-in-chief, John, Viscount Ligonier, for compromising the expedition's diversionary strategy by failing to land his artillery and horse and meet the French in battle. More recent commentators have pointed to the poor condition of his troops; his real failure was in not making a more rapid re-embarkation. Bligh was snubbed at court and, believing himself to have been made a scapegoat by Pitt, he resigned all his commissions and offices and retired to his property in Ireland.<br>
<br>The incident became the subject of a pamphlet war in London between supporters and opponents of Pitt's war policy. A rigid censorship was imposed and the military dispatches were never published. Bligh himself publicly disowned authorship of a pamphlet purporting to be <span class="italic">A Letter from the Honourable L&#151;t G&#151;l B&#151;gh to the Rt. Hon. W&#151;m P&#151;t Esq.</span> (London, 1758), which set out a defence of his actions. However, this is believed to be founded on a genuine letter combining his own narrative with remarks by the anonymous pamphleteer.<br>
<br>It is also thought that the foolhardy decision to attack St Malo (the geographical difficulties were well known) was pressed upon Bligh by the court of George, prince of Wales (the future George III), at Leicester House. The prince's brother, Prince Edward, served as a volunteer in the fleet under Howe, and General Clark, Bligh's incompetent quartermaster-general, was close to the Leicester House faction. The ministry's treatment of Bligh was taken as a slight by this group, and it was the prince of Wales's adviser, John Stuart, third earl of Bute, who prevailed upon him to resign his offices. Notwithstanding his incapacity for this command, which age alone should have precluded and his better judgement attempted to resist, his subsequent treatment as a pawn of political faction was a sad end to what had been an honourable and brave, if somewhat modest, military career.<br>
<br>Some time after his retirement Bligh married again. His second wife, Frances, the daughter of Theophilus Jones, of Leitrim, had no children. He died at Brittas, near Dublin, on 15 September 1775, at the age of ninety, and was buried at Rathmore. His ample fortune of &pound;100,000 he bequeathed to his younger brother, Robert Bligh (1703&#150;1778), dean of Elphin.<br>
