<span class="headword">Sharp,  Richard</span> <span class="st"> [<em>called </em>Conversation Sharp]</span>  (1759&#150;1835), <span class="occ">politician and wit</span>, was born in the garrison of St John's, Newfoundland, the elder son of Richard Sharp (1737&#150;1765), a British army officer, and Elizabeth Adams (1739&#150;1799), a citizen of St John's. He was related to the Sharps of Romsey, Hampshire, a well-known family of successful merchants. The family returned to London from Newfoundland in the early 1760s, and as a member of a staunchly nonconformist family the young Sharp was educated by the classical scholar the Revd Dr John Fell, Independent minister for Thaxted, Essex. Having been &#145;bred to trade from infancy&#146;  (Wilson, 133), Sharp successfully completed his apprenticeship before taking over the hatter's business which had been started by his grandfather on Fish Street Hill, London. In recent times Sharp has been credited with having been &#145;the world's first truly famous hatter&#146;  (McDowell, <span class="italic">Hats: Status, Style and Glamour</span>, 1992, 54). About 1798 his business interests moved to 17 Mark Lane where, as a partner in the West India firm of Boddington, Philips, Sharp &amp; Co., he prospered to become one of London's most prominent merchants. He subsequently lived briefly at Mansion House Place before purchasing in 1808 23 Park Lane, where portraits by Reynolds&#151;of Burke, Johnson, and of Reynolds himself&#151;adorned his drawing-room.<br>
<br>At both Park Lane and his much loved country retreat at Fredley Farm in Mickleham, Surrey, Sharp received and entertained many of the most able and cultured minds of the day, including Babbage, Faraday, Walter Scott, Grattan, Brougham, Horner, Romilly, John Russell, Chantrey, Porson, Hallam, Macaulay, Rogers, and Horne Tooke. Sydney Smith was such a frequent visitor to Fredley that he was nicknamed the Bishop of Mickleham and following the French Revolution other visitors included Talleyrand, D'Arblay, and Mme de Sta&euml;l. According to Clayden, Sharp was possibly the most popular person in London society during this period, his gifted eloquence and kindly good nature making him &#145;universally welcome&#146;  (Clayden, <span class="italic">The Early Life of Samuel Rogers</span>, 280). Such tributes to Sharp's personal qualities were widespread: Sir James Mackintosh the respected lawyer, historian, and metaphysician, described Sharp as the best critic that he had ever known and someone who had &#145;produced more effect on my character than any other man&#146;  (Hills, 43). Macaulay was impressed that Sharp never gossiped or spoke badly of anyone: &#145;if he can say nothing good of a man he holds his tongue&#146;  (ibid., 66). Among the poets, Samuel Rogers, who was later offered the laureateship, owed much to his close and lifelong friendship with Sharp, and others who benefited from his advice and beneficence included Wordsworth, Coleridge, Hazlitt, and Sheridan. The extraordinary social impact which Sharp made during his lifetime is summarized by Kegan Paul who wrote that &#145;both in Parliament and in Society he had a power quite out of proportion to that which most other persons in his seeming position would have wielded&#146;  (Paul, 12).<br>
<br>Sharp was a frequent and welcome guest at Holland House [<i>see also </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/93786', "Holland House set")</script>] and he belonged to many London clubs including Brooks's, Eumelean, the Unincreasable, Clifford Street, and the exclusive King of Clubs of which&#151;with Mackintosh, Robert (Bobus) Smith, Rogers, Scarlett, and Allen&#151;he had been a founder member. Sharp was elected FSA on 19 April 1787. In 1806 he was one of the first members of the Literary Society and on 12 June that year he was elected FRS. He played a leading role in establishing the London Institution for the Improvement of Science and Literature and, having joined the Fishmongers' Company at the age of twenty-one, he was elected their prime warden for the years 1810&#150;12.<br>
<br>Politically Sharp represented the pocket borough of Castle Rising, Norfolk, in 1806&#150;12 as a staunch whig and one of very few dissenters to be returned and he was appointed to the finance committee of the House of Commons because of his experience in banking and commerce. In this position, and later as a member of Horner's bullion committee, he met with success and he was complimented by Henry Bankes for his contribution to the house. In 1808 Sharp made his Copenhagen speech, fiercely criticizing the government for the unprovoked attack on the Danish fleet. Although this was received with the &#145;utmost applause and favour&#146;  (Clayden, <span class="italic">Rogers and his Contemporaries</span>, 1.44) Sharp thereafter preferred, much to the disappointment of his friends, to exert his influence less overtly. At the by-election of 1816 he was returned for the Irish constituency of Portarlington which he retained at the general election of 1818 but from which he resigned in 1819 in order to make way for his friend David Ricardo.<br>
<br>As a dissenting whig Sharp pressed hard for greater civil and religious liberties. He served as a &#145;deputy&#146; among London's dissenters and in 1790 wrote his stirring keynote letter to the public meeting of the friends to the repeal of the <span class="roman">Test and Corporation Acts</span>. Sharp was a member of the Society for Constitutional Information and in 1791&#150;2 he, Rogers, and others initiated the Friends of the People group which agitated for political reform. In the cause of greater personal freedom Sharp stressed the importance of education, holding strong views on the subject of the English language. He wrote the preface to Fell's <span class="italic">Grammar</span> (1784), addressed the Manchester Society on &#145;The nature and utility of eloquence&#146; (1787), and advocated&#151;in reaction to &#145;Johnsonism&#146;&#151;the common use of a purer, less pedantic form of English language which might owe less to Latin and other languages. His wit, wisdom, and interesting views on many subjects are contained in <span class="italic">Letters and Essays in Poetry and Prose</span>, published anonymously and to wide acclaim in 1834. This was his only significant publication although he corresponded with his friend John Adams, the future president of the United States, about writing an account of the establishment of American independence.<br>
<br>Sharp did not marry and for the earlier part of his life, following his father's premature death, he remained at Fish Street Hill with his grandfather, mother, brother, stepfather (Thomas Cable Davis), and a number of stepsiblings. Later, about 1813, Maria Kinnaird became the much loved ward and adopted daughter of Richard and his brother William, and they, with William's wife Anna, lived together at their Park Lane address. When Richard Sharp died Maria inherited the bulk of his &pound;250,000 estate and she married Thomas Drummond shortly afterwards.<br>
<br>Throughout his life but increasingly from 1815 onwards Sharp delighted in travel, particularly in France, Switzerland, Italy, Scotland, and the Lake District, and became such an expert on itineraries that many were grateful for his advice. According to Wordsworth, Sharp knew Italy better than anyone he had ever met  (Knight, 3.250&#150;51). For much of his life Sharp suffered from a bad chest and a persistent &#145;winter cough&#146; so his trips were partly motivated by concern for his health and from about 1832, when his condition worsened, increasing periods of time were spent at his house on Higher Terrace, Torquay. He died at Dorchester, Dorset, on 30 March 1835 at the age of seventy-six while returning to London from Torquay and he was buried on 4 April alongside other members of his family in the dissenters' burial-ground of Bunhill Fields, London. Sharp was an accomplished businessman, politician, philosopher, and author but he achieved distinction as Conversation Sharp, a highly acclaimed critic and popular conversationalist, whose opinions and advice on a wide range of issues were sought by many of the cleverest people of his day. He is believed to have been the inspiration for Dickens's Conversation Kenge in <span class="italic">Bleak House</span>.<br>
