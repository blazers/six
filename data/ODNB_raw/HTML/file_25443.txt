<span class="headword">Shirley,  William</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1739&#150;1777), <span class="occ">playwright</span>, was also a merchant who for many years conducted business in Portugal. In 1753 he argued with the English consul at Lisbon, which resulted in an order from the Portuguese government to leave the country within five days. From that time he lived in London, though he occasionally went abroad, and even revisited Portugal, where he narrowly escaped with his life in the earthquake of 1755. He was an authority on affairs of trade and international commerce, and wrote several letters in the <span class="italic">Daily Gazetteer</span>, signed Lusitanicus, on the relations of Portugal and Britain. He also wrote on currency in Sir William Browne's <span class="italic">Proposal on our Coin</span> (1771); and produced his <span class="italic">Observations on a Pamphlet Lately Published Concerning a Portuguese Conspiracy</span> (1759).<br>
<br>Shirley also wrote plays, but his output was far greater than his talent. His earliest play was a tragedy called <span class="italic">The Parricide</span> which appeared at Covent Garden on 17 January 1739, but was never performed again as there was a riot in the audience. Shirley defends himself in a later published preface to the work, claiming that the riot was planned: &#145;their expelling the ladies from the pit, and sending for wine to drink, were likewise strong indications of their arbitrary and violent dispositions&#146;, and says &#145;faulty as it is, it deserv'd a better fate than it met with&#146;. Genest, on the other hand, finds &#145;nothing in it either pleasing or interesting&#146;, and this seems to be the view which has lasted.<br>
<br>Shirley's next play, <span class="italic">King Pepin's Campaign</span>, was performed at Drury Lane in 1745 and published in 1755, but the reviews felt that for a burlesque comedy it was sadly lacking in humour. After this he wrote <span class="italic">Edward the Black Prince</span>, which appeared at Drury Lane on 6 January 1750, with David Garrick in the part of Edward and Spranger Barry as the French nobleman, Lord Ribemont. Opinions were mixed: the audience mostly applauded, while groaning at the hackneyed love scenes; others found it dull and considered it to be an unsuitable vehicle for an actor such as Garrick. Shirley soon afterwards quarrelled with Garrick and took his revenge in 1758 by printing a pamphlet entitled <span class="italic">Brief Remarks on the Original and Present State of the Drama</span>, with a humorous dialogue called &#145;Hecate's Prophecy&#146;, in which Garrick was criticized under the name of Roscius.<br>
<br>The two men seem, however, to have been reconciled, for when new proprietors acquired Drury Lane from Garrick in 1776, one of the terms of sale was that a new piece by William Shirley be performed as soon as possible. <span class="italic">The Roman Sacrifice</span> opened on 18 December 1777, but closed after four nights of decreasing audiences. According to Horace Walpole it was &#145;without a tolerable line&#146;  (Walpole, <span class="italic">Corr.</span>, 23 Dec 1777). Shirley wrote several other plays which were not published; nothing further is known about his life.<br>
