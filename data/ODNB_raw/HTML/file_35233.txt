<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Nicholson, Sir  William Newzam Prior</span>  (1872&#150;1949), <span class="occ">artist</span>, was born at 12 London Road, Newark-on-Trent, on 5 February 1872, the youngest child of William Newzam Nicholson (1816&#150;1899), engineer, of the Trent ironworks, and later MP for Newark, and his second wife, Ann Elizabeth Prior (1839&#150;1899), of Woodstock, Oxfordshire. Nicholson's disinclination, at an early age, for the normal routine of studies at Magnus Grammar School, Newark (1881&#150;8), where he was at first a boarder, and the lively interest that he took in the lessons of the school's drawing master, W. H. Cubley, finally convinced his parents that it would be foolish to oppose his determination to become an artist.<br>
<br>At the age of sixteen Nicholson passed the entrance examination to the school of art at Bushey run by Hubert von Herkomer. Here he met fellow student Mabel Scott Lauder Pryde (1871&#150;1918), who was to become his first wife. She introduced him to her brother, the artist <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35626/', "James Ferrier Pryde")</script>. Nicholson left Herkomer's in 1891 following what Herkomer termed &#145;a piece of Whistlerian impudence&#146; (William had posed a nude model with an open umbrella)  (Steen, <span class="italic">William Nicholson</span>, 44). In the autumn of that year Nicholson visited Paris and enrolled for a short time at the Acad&eacute;mie Julian. After his marriage on 25 April 1893, he settled first at the Eight Bells, Denham, Buckinghamshire, where he and his wife were almost immediately joined by her brother, James Pryde.<br>
<br>In 1894 Pryde and Nicholson, as J. &amp; W. Beggarstaff, began to collaborate on a series of posters which were revolutionary in style with their boldness of outline, simplicity of treatment, and striking silhouettes, and their flat, pure colours. These included designs for <span class="italic">Don Quixote</span> (made for the 1895 production of Sir Henry Irving but not used on the hoardings), <span class="italic">Harper's Magazine</span> (1895), and <span class="italic">Rowntree's Elect Cocoa</span> (1896).<br>
<br>The Beggarstaff partnership was short-lived but the originality of their posters was widely recognized. In the following years Nicholson evolved out of the posters a personal style which he began to exploit through the medium of the woodcut. In this venture he had the good fortune to be encouraged by J. A. McNeill Whistler who recommended him to the publisher William Heinemann. The publications that followed established Nicholson's solo reputation. <span class="italic">An Alphabet</span> and <span class="italic">An Almanac of Twelve Sports</span>, with verses by Rudyard Kipling, both appeared in 1897 (title-pages postdated 1898), <span class="italic">London Types</span>, with verses by W. E. Henley, in 1898, and <span class="italic">The Square Book of Animals</span> in 1899. Nicholson also made a series of portrait woodcuts, the first of which was the irreverent, affectionate jubilee portrait of Queen Victoria (originally published in Henley's <span class="italic">New Review</span> in June 1897), which brought him great success. These were collected in the two series of <span class="italic">Twelve Portraits</span> (1899 and 1902), the first of which was awarded a gold medal at the 1900 Paris Exhibition. The Heinemann windmill colophon still used today was designed by Nicholson at this time.<br>
<br>After the turn of the century Nicholson concentrated on painting, and portrait commissions were his main means of support. His subjects included many of the prominent figures of the period, and in 1909 he wrote of &#145;relays of sitters every twenty minutes&#146;  (Nicholson to T. W. Bacon, 26 May 1909, Whitworth Art Gallery, Manchester). He was best-known in his lifetime as a portrait painter. Among his finest portraits are those of Max Beerbohm (<i>c</i>.1903) and Gertrude Jekyll (1920), both in the National Portrait Gallery, London; of his friend Walter Greaves (1917) in Manchester City Galleries; and of George Saintsbury (1923) at Merton College, Oxford. Nicholson's real love, however, was landscape and still-life painting, and it is these works that are especially highly regarded today. His son <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/31498/', "Ben Nicholson")</script> admired&#151;and acknowledged a debt to&#151;their &#145;poetic spirit&#146;  (B. Nicholson, 73). Modest in scale, they have a tonal mastery, economy of means, sensitivity of touch, and acuteness of perception which is very distinctive. Nicholson had a special feeling for the English downlands, whether the Sussex downs around Rottingdean where he moved in 1909 or, later, the Wiltshire downs. Between the wars he also painted in France and Spain. His still-life compositions took as their subjects the silver, lustreware, jugs and mugs, vases, goblets, glass, flowers, fruit, mushrooms, and fish of his domestic surroundings. His repertory of still-life objects was a heritage Ben Nicholson prized.<br>
<br>William Nicholson's painting has affinities with Whistler and Manet: he did not respond to later French painting. He had a great admiration for the work of Vel&aacute;zquez. In the 1920s his palette lightened and his handling became freer: these later paintings are more experimental and he learned from the younger artists of his own family&#151;his second wife, Edith (Edie) Stuart Wortley (1890&#150;1958), daughter of Sir Lionel Phillips, first baronet, and widow of Lieutenant-Colonel John Stuart Wortley, whom he had married in 1919 after his first wife died of influenza, his son Ben, and Ben's wife, Winifred Nicholson [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37810/', "Nicholson, (Rosa) Winifred")</script>]. William was independent of any school of painting and refused election to the Royal Academy, at which he never exhibited. He was knighted in 1936 and had an important retrospective at the National Gallery, London, in 1942.<br>
<br>Nicholson had a strong interest in the theatre and made designs for a number of productions. In 1904, for example, J. M. Barrie invited him to design costumes and scenery for the first production of <span class="italic">Peter Pan</span> and in 1922 he contributed sets and costumes to Nigel Playfair's production of John Gay's opera <span class="italic">Polly</span>. In 1925 he designed the d&eacute;cor and costumes for L&eacute;onide Massine's ballet <span class="italic">The Rake</span> in the revue <span class="italic">On with the Dance</span> mounted by C. B. Cochran and No&euml;l Coward at the London Pavilion. Nicholson loved poetry and illustrated the works of his writer friends (such as W. H. Davies and Siegfried Sassoon) and others. Together with the writer and poet Robert Graves, who married Nicholson's daughter Nancy in 1918, he edited the review <span class="italic">The Owl</span>. His natural sympathy with children produced work of great charm such as <span class="italic">The Pirate Twins</span> (1929), written and illustrated by Nicholson, and his illustrations for Margery Williams's <span class="italic">The Velveteen Rabbit</span> (1922).<br>
<br>In figure Nicholson was slight and graceful and very agile. His friend Gordon Craig described him as &#145;skilful beyond words in handling anything where eye and hand and brain have to be under perfect control, and in absolute harmony&#146;  (G. Craig, <span class="italic">Woodcuts and some Words</span>, 1924, 8). He dressed with meticulous but unconventional fastidiousness. His wardrobe was famous for its delicately spotted shirts and dressing gowns, canary-yellow waistcoats, and immaculate white trousers&#151;worn also for painting. His distinctive taste was evident in his homes, for example The Grange at Rottingdean and his London studio-residence at Apple Tree Yard. He had a very particular sense of humour and a fondness for puns. He was companionable and would paint unperturbed while a stream of visitors passed through his studio. Ben Nicholson observed: &#145;Behind his personality lay a very simple direct painterly approach&#146;  (B. Nicholson, 71). He did not like to talk about art and eschewed art theory.<br>
<br>Nicholson's singular achievement rests on three diverse strands of work: the pioneering and influential posters and woodcuts made when he was still in his twenties, the portraits of distinguished contemporaries, and the poetic landscapes and still-lifes. His best work has a subtlety, virtuosity, and individual voice that places it with the finest of its period.<br>
<br>With his first wife, Mabel, Nicholson had four children, Ben, Tony, Nancy, later a fabric designer, and the architect Christopher (Kit). Tony was killed on active service in France in 1918 a few months after his mother's death. With his second wife, Edie, Nicholson had a daughter, Liza, who was born in 1920. The writer Marguerite Elena May Steen (1894&#150;1975) was Nicholson's companion from 1935 until his death. Nicholson died at his home, Little Triton, Blewbury, Berkshire, on 16 May 1949. He was cremated on 19 May and his ashes were buried at Newark on 22 July.<br>
