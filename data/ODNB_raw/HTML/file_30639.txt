<span class="headword">Bateson, Sir  Alexander Dingwall</span>  (1866&#150;1935), <span class="occ">judge</span>, was born at Allerton, Liverpool, on 30 April 1866, the youngest of the six sons of William Gandy Bateson, a partner in a well-known firm of shipping solicitors in Liverpool, and his wife, Agnes Dingwall, daughter of Sir Thomas Blaikie, of Aberdeen. Like his elder brother Harold Dingwall Bateson, he was educated at Rugby School and at Trinity College, Oxford, where he took a third in classical moderations (1887) and graduated with a pass BA degree in 1888. He played rugby for the college but, unlike Harold, did not obtain a blue; as a cricketer he was an adventurous batsman and sound wicket-keeper.<br>
<br>Having been called to the bar by the Inner Temple in 1891, Bateson began his professional career in the chambers of Joseph Walton. With such backing and under such a mentor, as well as his family connections, he had conspicuous advantages: he quickly specialized in shipping work, mainly in salvage and collision cases in the Admiralty division, occasionally in the commercial court. His progress was steady, his practice substantial. With a pleasing voice, incisive in manner and speech, he was both a lucid and a businesslike advocate. In 1893 he married Isabel Mary (<i>d</i>. 1919), fourth daughter of William Latham QC; they had four sons and two daughters.<br>
<br>In 1909 Bateson was appointed junior counsel to the Admiralty for Admiralty division work, but did not hold that office for long: in 1910, with his friend, and principal rival in the Admiralty court, (Edward) Maurice Hill, he took silk, and thereafter there were few shipping cases in the Admiralty division, House of Lords, or privy council in which he was not on one side or the other. He secured the confidence of the maritime business community more by his attention to detail and capacity for decision than through any profound legal learning, such as his same rival who preceded him to the bench enjoyed. He was elected a bencher of his inn in 1920.<br>
<br>Under the <span class="roman">Administration of Justice Act</span> (1925) power was given to appoint an additional judge of the Probate, Divorce, and Admiralty Division, which had become congested: divorce-law reform increased divorce cases, while depression in shipping had not yet decreased shipping cases. With the universal approbation of the bar&#151;and in accordance with its universal expectation&#151;the lord chancellor (Viscount Cave) in May 1925 selected Bateson for appointment to the new post. He received the customary knighthood. The division in which he sat brought together in a single court quite disparate legal disciplines, and indeed from 1970 no longer survived in that form, the subjects being dispersed between the Queen's Bench (Admiralty), Chancery (Probate), and Family (Divorce) divisions. Bateson was entirely conversant with maritime law and practice; in the probate and matrimonial jurisdiction he lacked any previous expertise. Although he never wholly assimilated all the historical principles of the earlier ecclesiastical law, his sound common sense and humanity stood him in good stead. He appreciated that the duty of a judge in family matters is to give judgments, not to deliver sermons. He disliked anything which attracted public attention to himself, and made no gratuitous comments on manners or morals. Dignified, courteous, careful, and diligent, Bateson was a master of fact, not of law. He seldom reserved a judgment, yet his judgments were rarely reversed. He continued to show that supreme judicial qualification, the ability to reach a conclusion. As a result he gave full satisfaction not only to the shipping community but also to other litigants and the bar.<br>
<br>During the First World War, Bateson had been a regular worker at the Kensington Red Cross depot, where he helped to make thousands of &#145;Thomas splints&#146;, rings of mild steel shaped to fit round the thigh. Bateson said to a colleague of this experience, &#145;the noise of the hammering prevents my hearing the bombs&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 16 Jan 1935, 12). He had the English quality best captured by the French word &#145;sangfroid&#146;. His outside interests included agriculture, forestry, and shooting, and for many years he farmed at Lotus, Beeswing by Dumfries, Kirkcudbrightshire, where he usually spent his vacations. He died at his home, 30 Phillimore Gardens, London, on 11 January 1935. His obituary in <span class="italic">The Times</span> (12 January 1935) commented that &#145;the premature close of his judicial career must be regarded as a serious public loss&#146;. Today a judge of his age would be compelled to retire.<br>
