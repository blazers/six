<span class="headword">Murray <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em> Home Drummond]</span>,  Anne</span>, duchess of Atholl  (1814&#150;1897), <span class="occ">courtier</span>, was born in Edinburgh on 17 June 1814, the only daughter and second of the three children of Henry Home Drummond, MP (1783&#150;1867), of Blair Drummond, Perthshire, and Christian Stirling (1779&#150;1864), elder daughter of Charles Moray of Abercairny. She was rejected, sight unseen, as the potential bride of an unspecified duke before marrying, on 29 October 1839, George Augustus Frederick John Murray (1814&#150;1864), Baron Glenlyon and heir presumptive to the dukedom of Atholl. The marriage was successful, Anne Glenlyon observing to her father in its early days, that &#145;my ticket in the marriage lottery is a prize&#146;  (Abercairny MSS). They had an only child, a son, born in 1840, later seventh duke.<br>
<br>Connections with the court were initially formed in 1842, when Victoria and Albert visited the Glenlyons at Dunkeld, in Perthshire, during their first visit to Scotland; this visit was also the occasion of Victoria's first attendance at a Church of Scotland service, in Blair Atholl. In 1844 the royal couple again visited the Glenlyons, taking over Blair Castle during September. These connections were made the more important by financial difficulties: the Atholl estates were held in trust during the lifetime of the fifth duke who was insane, and the Glenlyons actively sought positions at court to enhance their incomes. In 1846 Glenlyon obtained the position of lord in waiting from Peel, whom he supported in parliament, but changes in the administration removed him from the court after six months. On 14 September 1846, Glenlyon succeeded as sixth duke of Atholl (which he and his wife consistently spelt Athole).<br>
<br>In March 1852 Anne Atholl was invited to serve at the head of the female household as mistress of the robes under the Derby administration, which position she filled until the following January. In May 1854 she was invited to become a lady of the bedchamber, a position of lower rank than that which she had previously held, but which involved closer contact with the queen through regular residence at court. Their relationship was always friendly, in part because the duchess understood how to manage the queen, &#145;the complete folly of opposition if started at once, without any care, and the ease with which advice may be given and well received, if you don't begin in antagonism&#146;  (Ponsonby, 63). The death of the duke in 1864 from cancer of the neck after a lengthy illness, drew the duchess closer to the queen, who took comfort from the presence of another mourning widow, describing her as &#145;so wise, so excellent and so pleasant and so truly Scotch&#146;  (Fulford, 26).<br>
<br>After the death of the duke, Anne Atholl lived at Dunkeld House with her cousin Emily Murray MacGregor as a companion, and here the queen stayed with her on a number of occasions. She took an active interest in the local community, particularly in the school for girls which she had opened in Dunkeld in 1856. She continued to hold her position at court, and served as acting mistress of the robes with the dowager duchesses of Bedford and Roxburghe during Gladstone's final ministry when no duchess could be persuaded to accept the office. She denied having party political opinions, although her husband and father had been Peelites and her son, who succeeded as seventh duke in 1864, was a Conservative; Miss Murray MacGregor, by contrast, was a convinced Gladstonian.<br>
<br>Anne Atholl died at Dunkeld House on 18 May 1897 at the age of eighty-two and was buried four days later with her husband in the ruined Old Kirk at Blair Atholl.<br>
