<span class="headword">Litchfield <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Sylvester Hay]</span>,  Harriett</span>  (1777&#150;1854), <span class="occ">actress</span>, is said to have been born on 4 March 1777. Her father, John Sylvester Hay (<i>d</i>. 1787?), the only son of the vicar of Maldon, Essex, was surgeon of the East Indiaman <i>Nassau</i>, and afterwards head surgeon of the Royal Hospital, Calcutta, where he is stated to have died in his thirty-seventh year, leaving his daughter aged about nine. He may have been the &#145;Mr John Hay&#146; who was &#145;proprietor and printer of the <span class="italic">Calcutta Gazette</span>&#146;, and proprietor and manager of the Calcutta theatre, who died at Fort William in April 1787  (<span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span>, 2, 1787, 1024).<br>
<br>Miss Hay, sometimes called Miss Sylvester, made her first appearance at Richmond in the summer of 1792, as Julia in Colman's <span class="italic">The Surrender of Calais</span>. Encouraged by Dorothy Jordan's applause, she played three or four other characters. Early in 1793 she acted in Scotland and later received a letter from Robert Burns inviting her in the name of the citizens of Dumfries to revisit that town. Her next engagement, under Francis Aickin at Liverpool, proved unsatisfactory. He allowed her only two parts: Sophia in Thomas Holcroft's <span class="italic">The Road to Ruin</span> and Edward in Elizabeth Inchbald's <span class="italic">Everyone has his Fault</span>. On 27 May 1796 she appeared in London at Covent Garden &#145;as a young Lady&#146; for the benefit of Mary Ann Davenport, playing her Liverpool role of Edward.<br>
<br>Parish records at St Paul's, Covent Garden, confirm that Harriett Sylvester Hay married John Litchfield (1774&#150;1858) on 14 September 1796. He was a clerk of the privy council, and Gilliland in the <span class="italic">Dramatic Mirror</span> reported that he was &#145;a gentleman well known and admired in the literary world, and much esteemed as a private character&#146;. He was also the author of some prologues and epilogues, and he occasionally acted. After their marriage the couple settled at 36 Bedford Street, Covent Garden. A child, the first of six, most of whom died in infancy, was born on 30 September 1796, and baptized Thomas Litchfield at St Paul's on 21 November 1796.<br>
<br>Harriett Litchfield had briefly left the stage upon her marriage, but reappeared in the benefit performances for Mary Ann Yates at the Haymarket on 9 February 1797 and later for other benefits at Covent Garden. Her reception on these occasions gained her an engagement for the following season, and she performed at Richmond during the summer. Engaged at &pound;3 a week, she appeared at Covent Garden on 20 September 1797 as Marianne in Reynolds's <span class="italic">The Dramatist</span>. Her other roles that season included Catalina in <span class="italic">The Castle of Andalusia</span>, Lady Anne in <span class="italic">Richard III</span>, and Dimity in Arthur Murphy's <span class="italic">Three Weeks after Marriage</span>. In October 1797 the <span class="italic">Monthly Mirror</span> was enthusiastic in praising her performances, and it is possible that the reviews of her work in that journal were written by her husband.<br>
<br>On 5 December 1800 Mrs Litchfield played Lady Macbeth, making such a success that she was established as a judicious actress. The <span class="italic">Monthly Mirror</span> enthused &#145;the attempt was bold and hazardous, but her success in the character was complete&#146;. After a quarrel in 1806 with her managers, she returned to the Haymarket. Richard Brinsley Peake recalled that Colman relied on her &#145;capability of sustaining a variety of parts&#146;. Thereafter her name all but disappears from the theatrical record. She played for six nights at Bath in May 1810, enacting Lady Clermont in Dimond's <span class="italic">Adrian and Orilla</span> and performing in a monodrama by Matthew Gregory Lewis that had been written especially for her. On 8 October 1812 she appeared at the Haymarket as Emilia in <span class="italic">Othello</span>, one of her best characters. This was announced as her first appearance on the stage for six years; it seems also to have been her last.<br>
<br>The <span class="italic">Thespian Dictionary</span> (1805) complimented her skill in tragedy and in irascible characters such as Mrs Oakley in Colman's <span class="italic">The Jealous Wife</span>, and further commented &#145;that the animation of her performance makes ample compensation for the disadvantage of figure&#146;. Thomas Gilliland and Anne Mathews remembered her as an esteemed and celebrated actress, and the former further recorded her cheerful and unaffected manners in private life.<br>
<br>Harriett Litchfield and her husband survived another four decades. She died, probably in London, on 11 January 1854. The <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> (July 1858) reported John Litchfield's death as having occurred on 30 May 1858, at the age of eighty-four, at the home of his only surviving daughter, Mrs Harriet Sarah Abraham, of Mountfield House, Harrow Road, London.<br>
