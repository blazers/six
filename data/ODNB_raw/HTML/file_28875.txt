<span class="headword">Watson, Sir  William</span>  (1715&#150;1787), <span class="occ">physician and natural philosopher</span>, was born in St John's Street, Smithfield, London, on 3 April 1715, the son of William Watson, a corn chandler. He entered the Merchant Taylors' School in 1726 and on 6 April 1731 was apprenticed to an apothecary, Thomas Richardson. A keen student of pharmacy and botany during the eight years of his apprenticeship, Watson won a prize that included a copy of John Ray's <span class="italic">Synopsis methodica stirpium Britannicarum</span>, awarded annually by the Society of Apothecaries for identifying plants during country excursions from the Chelsea Physic Garden. During the summer of 1738 Watson married, purchased his freedom from the society ten months before completing his apprenticeship, and set up as an apothecary in Aldersgate, London.<br>
<br>Watson began attending the Royal Society in March 1738, first as a guest of the Cambridge botany professor John Martyn, then under the patronage of the president, Hans Sloane. Watson was elected a fellow on 9 April 1741 and regularly joined both the society's public meetings and its private club, founded in 1743, at The Mitre in Fleet Street, and later at the Crown and Anchor in the Strand. He sat on many of the society's committees, and after 1772 served as its vice-president. He also belonged to the Monday Club, which met at the George and Vulture Coffee House, Cornhill, from at least the 1760s; and he was an ally both of the whig magnate Philip Yorke, Lord Hardwicke, for whom he acted as physician, and of John Pringle, the society's president in the 1770s. He was a sociable and energetic member of London's learned world, hard-working, an early riser, and endowed with a remarkable memory. His initial publications concerned the means and importance of correct plant identification. In December 1744 he wrote on the previously undescribed star puffball, attracting interest from European botanists. He produced several accounts of accidental poisoning by hemlock and henbane, and in 1754 argued for the polygamous character of holly. Much of his work as a naturalist involved reviews of foreign studies, such as a 1742 paper on Albrecht von Haller's list of Swiss plants and a paper of May 1752 on the hitherto neglected French report that corals were animal, not vegetable. In the spring of 1748 Per Kalm, a pupil of the great Swedish naturalist Linnaeus, stayed with Watson before a botanical survey in America. The history and the reform of English botany were among Watson's concerns. In 1749 he re-examined the ruins of the Tradescants' garden at Lambeth, and in 1752 accompanied the Swiss naturalist Abraham Trembley to investigate the vegetable origin of coal deposits in Sussex. The first English account of Linnaeus's <span class="italic">Species plantarum</span> (1753) was a laudatory and detailed review Watson published, with Linnaeus's approval, at the end of 1754 in the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span>. When the British Museum was founded in 1756 Watson, named a trustee by Sloane, arranged its gardens at Montague House. Unimpressed by the staffing arrangements, Watson strongly backed the appointment of specialist naturalists to maintain the museum's natural history collections. In 1760 he made a pilgrimage to the Essex house and grave of John Ray, whom he viewed as English natural history's patriarch. Richard Pulteney, chief English campaigner for Linnaean taxonomy, and Watson's eulogist, judged Watson himself &#145;the living lexicon of botany&#146;  (Pulteney, 337).<br>
<br>From late 1744 Watson initiated experimental work on electricity, based first on reports from the Leipzig professor Johann Winkler that warm alcohol in a spoon could be ignited by an electric spark. As yet unfamiliar with electrical lore, the apothecary Watson saw chemical significance in the effect. In March and April 1745 he reported that many volatile liquids could also be fired electrically, and distinguished between firing into an earthed spoon and what he called &#145;repulsive&#146; firing when the spark was passed over the surface of an electrified one. During 1745 Watson developed his electrical expertise, showing the weakening of successive electrical shocks between insulated experimenters and the varying behaviours of glass, metal, and cork when held by an electrified man standing on an insulating wax cake. These trials, which took place with the assistance of the society's new president, Martin Folkes, were witnessed by the prince of Wales and the duke of Cumberland. On Sloane's nomination the trials won Watson the Royal Society's Copley medal in 1745 and were described in a pamphlet first published that year, <span class="italic">Experiments and Observations Tending to Illustrate the Nature and Properties of Electricity</span>, which in a new version had four reprints during 1746.<br>
<br>In February 1746 Watson matched this success with experiments linking electrical effluvia with the active fire described by the Dutch medical chemist Hermann Boerhaave. Watson considered electricity a particulate, elastic, and subtle fluid which moved objects by impact and would naturally seek to restore any temporary imbalance in its distribution. It flowed in straight lines away from a rubbed tube, was refracted through conductors, but must reach a certain strength as it soaked into a conductor before then being able to penetrate glass. He showed that sparks could be drawn from a metal conductor attached to a frictional electrical machine only if the operator of the machine, or else the conductor itself, were grounded. During the rest of 1746 he established that such machines would work better if their operators were not insulated but earthed, and reckoned these devices should be understood as pumps, drawing the fluid up from the ground. Watson's theory of pumping, which he compared with the prestigious fluid theory of the French natural philosopher Jean Nollet, became significant when in early 1746 the Royal Society learned of the invention of the Leyden jar, a glass bottle which gave huge shocks if a grounded experimenter simultaneously touched its outer surface and a metal conductor linked to the inside surface of the bottle. On the suggestion of the London physician John Bevis, Watson increased the jar's effect by covering both sides of the glass with lead and making the glass thin. He designed tricks to convey the jar's shock unawares to his victims, then argued at the society in late October 1746 that his fluid theory perfectly explained its effects. The electric fire flowed out from the experimenter's body to the jar and to the conductor, and was resupplied to the experimenter from the ground. Watson's work was again released as a pamphlet before the end of the year.<br>
<br>Early in 1747 Watson revised this initial electrical theory. Bevis reported that if an insulated man touched a rotating globe worked by an insulated operator, both became electrified though cut off from the ground. Watson explained the phenomenon as a redistribution of electrical fluid across zones of different fluid density, preserving aspects of his model of equilibrium and pumping. Later in 1747, in collaboration with Folkes, Bevis, James Bradley, and Charles Cavendish, Watson spent several weeks trying to measure electricity's speed by laying a wire from a Leyden jar across Westminster Bridge, then passing the fluid back through the Thames and their own bodies. Similar trials were conducted at Highbury and Shooter's Hill. They judged the fluid's speed was too fast to measure. Just as he acted as reviewer of natural history, so Watson made himself the expositor of electrical doctrines of colleagues such as the clockmaker John Ellicott and the painter Benjamin Wilson, who also designed competing theories of the electrical fluid. Charles Cavendish forwarded to Watson a letter from Benjamin Franklin, written in June 1747 in Philadelphia, which also proffered a theory of the jar's action. On 21 January 1748 Watson read to the society extracts from Franklin's letter and claimed that his own density theory and Franklin's apparently novel doctrine of electrical atmospheres and positive and negative charges were to all intents identical. Watson's role as the Royal Society's reviewer, in such fields as thermometry, industry, or chemistry, also brought him news about electricity. In 1749 he criticized claims by Venetian experimenters and Winkler that medically active fluids could allegedly be transmitted from the interior of sealed electrified glass tubes, and he revealed the recipe for various German tricks involving the electrical discharge from metal hidden beneath a performer's clothes. In 1752 he reported on trials done with Charles Cavendish of electric discharge in vacua, which he compared with the phenomena of the northern lights. Cavendish provided Watson with a remarkable mercurial tube which made a vacuum and electrical flow simultaneously. When the Quaker physician John Fothergill, a friend of Watson, arranged the publication of Franklin's letters on electricity in 1751, Watson reviewed them for the Royal Society rather favourably, though he denied that the electrification of the jar took place entirely within the glass; in 1752 he failed to draw electricity during a thunderstorm. By the later 1750s Watson had become an ally of Franklin in natural philosophy and in politics. They both joined the reformist Society of Honest Whigs; in December 1762 Watson petitioned the first lord of the Admiralty, Lord Anson, for the installation of Franklin's designs for lightning rods at Purfleet arsenal, and published a pamphlet on the rods in 1764. In 1772 Watson joined Franklin on a Royal Society committee which decisively recommended such a strategy for the defence of Purfleet.<br>
<br>Watson's pharmaceutical skills and interest in aerial activity helped to prompt his subsequent medical work. As early as 1742 he published in the <span class="italic">Philosophical Transactions</span> on ways of extracting foul air from ships, and from the 1750s set out to establish himself in medical practice. He wrote on public welfare, including advice in 1757 on preventing the freezing of lead water pipes by means of pairs of taps rather than by covering the pipes with horse manure. On 6 September 1757 Watson was created a doctor of physic at Halle, and may also have got similar degrees from Wittenberg and Edinburgh. At the end of that year he was disfranchised from the Apothecaries' Society for a fee of &pound;50. Watson had employed several apprentice apothecaries, including William Jordan (from 1740) and Rudolph Hobbes (from 1745): one of them, Timothy Lane, took over Watson's apothecary's business and continued his electrical studies into the 1760s. Watson was eventually admitted a licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians on 22 December 1759.<br>
<br>After moving to Lincoln's Inn Fields, Watson became physician for the Foundling Hospital, a central institution of whig philanthropy, in October 1762. He published in the <span class="italic">Philosophical Transactions</span> on the influenza and dysentery epidemics of that year and in 1763 used his electrical expertise to describe cures of muscular rigidity in tetanus by the application of shocks. In 1768 Watson published an influential pamphlet on smallpox inoculation, arguing on the basis of his major work at the Foundling Hospital against treating children less than three years old, and recommending abstinence from meat and heating liquors. After violent attacks by licentiates on the Royal College establishment in 1767&#150;8, Watson joined the Society of Collegiate Physicians' campaign, backed by allies such as Fothergill and William Heberden, to force the college to admit fellows from outside the English universities. Watson contributed papers on putrid measles to Fothergill's reformist <span class="italic">Medical Observations</span>, and in 1771 Heberden tried unsuccessfully to get both Fothergill and Watson elected fellows of the Royal College, a status Watson gained only on 30 September 1784. He was made censor in 1785&#150;6 and was knighted on 6 October 1786. Many of Watson's circle, such as the Cavendish clan, Heberden, and Pringle, shared his engagement in enlightened reform and some of his sympathy for dissent. In his last years Watson rose to a central place in the genteel world of metropolitan philosophical society. He died at Lincoln's Inn Fields on 10 May 1787, leaving a son, and a daughter who was married to Edward Beadon, rector of North Stoneham, Hampshire, brother of Richard Beadon (1737&#150;1824), bishop of Bath and Wells.<br>
<br>Watson's son, <a name="cosubject_28875"></a><span class="headword">Sir William Watson</span>  (1744&#150;1824), was, like his father, a <span class="occ">physician and naturalist</span>. He was born in London in early September 1744 and educated at Charterhouse before entering Queens' College, Cambridge, as pensioner on 17 February 1761, whence he migrated to Gonville and Caius College on 26 April 1762. Watson obtained his MB in 1766 and was elected fellow of the Royal Society on 10 December 1767. A resident of Bedford Square in London, he graduated MD in 1771, then practised medicine in Bath. About 1772 Watson married Christiana Freame, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Barclay (<i>c</i>.1739&#150;1796); she was the mother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/70499/', "Priscilla Hannah Gurney")</script>. In 1778 he published on the blue shark in the <span class="italic">Philosophical Transactions</span>, and maintained considerable interest in botany and mineralogy. In December 1779 he joined the new Bath Philosophical Society, and was instrumental in introducing William Herschel, then a Bath musician, to the society's membership. Watson became Herschel's close friend and correspondent. They discussed problems in natural history and astronomy and collaborated on measures of the heights of the hills round Bath, the results being published in 1810 in Joseph Wilson's <span class="italic">History of Mountains</span>. Watson supplied Herschel with a valuable nebular catalogue in late 1781, successfully lobbied for Herschel's royal pension in 1782, produced important drawings of Herschel's 7 foot telescope in 1783, and in 1784 advised on the proper depiction of Uranus on Josiah Wedgwood's portrait medallion of Herschel. In January 1785 Watson suggested to Herschel that the regular distribution of stars in space might resemble the patterns of mutually repulsive particles of powdered resin on the surface of an electrically charged wax and turpentine cake. The same year Watson published <span class="italic">A Treatise on Time</span>, a philosophical essay dedicated to Herschel and heavily indebted to Joseph Priestley, another member of the Bath Society. Watson was linked by marriage with some members of the Lunar Society of Birmingham, including Samuel Galton. He was knighted on 6 March 1796, joined a revived Philosophical Society in Bath in 1799, and became the city's mayor in 1801. Watson died in Bath on 15 November 1824.<br>
