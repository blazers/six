<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Hicks,  George Elgar</span>  (1824&#150;1914), <span class="occ">genre painter</span>, was born in Lymington, Hampshire, on 13 March 1824, the youngest son of Edward Hicks (1783/4&#150;1861). His father rose from a cashier to become a partner in St Barbe and Co., the Lymington bank, from which he retired in 1840; he was made a county magistrate in 1843, and in 1837, 1841, and 1847 was mayor of Lymington, where he was active in local charities and promoted the building of churches. Originally Hicks's parents wanted him to follow a medical career, like his elder brother John Braxton Hicks (1823&#150;1897), who became a distinguished London physician and obstetrician; he thus spent three years of what he later described as &#145;arduous and disagreeable study&#146; pursuing medicine at the University of London  (Hicks, <span class="italic">Guide to Figure Drawing</span>, 30n). However, in 1843 Hicks changed the course of his career by entering Sass's Academy (also called the Bloomsbury School of Art) and in 1844 gained admission to the Royal Academy Schools. That year he won a medal at the Society of Arts for his chalk drawings and also a silver medal at the Royal Academy for one of his studies after the antique. In 1845 he was awarded the Art Union prize of &pound;60 for his renditions of the revelations of St John and was then commissioned by the Art Union to produce drawings for Thomas Campbell's popular poem <span class="italic">Gertrude of Wyoming</span> about life in Pennsylvania amid native American conflicts.<br>
<br>Hicks married, at St Pancras on 27 March 1847, Maria (1825/6&#150;1880), daughter of Joseph Harriss, tallow miller, and settled in Kensington. In the first seven years of marriage they had six (of eight) children. Hicks confided in his notebook that<blockquote>the pictures painted during the first 5 years of married life were small and unimportant. Attention too much divided between Parish work, ragged schools, profession, and domestic concerns to make much progress. Possibly if more time and attention had been exclusively devoted to professional study and intercourse with other artists the result would have been better. (Allwood, 54)</blockquote>Before attaining success as a painter he gained some distinction as an illustrator, having produced thirteen plates for an 1846 edition of Campbell's poem and four illustrations for the 1857 publication of Robert Bloomfield's <span class="italic">Farmer's Boy</span>. Drawing from his medical knowledge he also wrote two books aimed at art students, <span class="italic">A Guide to Figure Drawing</span> in 1853 and <span class="italic">Studies of the Human Figure</span> in 1868, both for George Rowney &amp; Co. For Rowneys educational series he produced a series of <span class="italic">Rustic Figures</span> lithographed from his drawings.<br>
<br>However, it was his paintings that gained Hicks particular recognition. He began exhibiting at the Royal Academy in 1848, and over the course of six decades (until 1908) sent more than a hundred entries, mostly narrative paintings and portraits. He also contributed a dozen entries between 1850 and 1865 to the British Institution, and was a member of the Royal Society of British Artists.<br>
<br>The turning point in Hicks's career occurred in 1859 with his Royal Academy entry <span class="italic">Dividend Day, Bank of England</span> (priv. coll.). This large canvas elicited widespread acclaim, primarily for its original topic, although some thought the characterization of figures verged on caricature. Buoyed by this success Hicks undertook a series of other large-scale, modern life, mostly urban, subjects from everyday life, notably <span class="italic">The General Post-Office: One Minute to Six</span> (priv. coll.), exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1860; <span class="italic">Billingsgate Market</span> (Worshipful Company of Fishmongers) in 1861; <span class="italic">Infant Election at the London Tavern</span> (priv. coll.) in 1865; and <span class="italic">Before the Magistrates</span> (priv. coll.) in 1866. These works typically received mixed, and often negative, criticism, with reviewers in the <span class="italic">Art Journal</span>, <span class="italic">Athenaeum</span>, the <span class="italic">Illustrated London News</span>, <span class="italic">The Times</span>, and other magazines disparaging the allegedly &#145;vulgar&#146;, &#145;meretricious&#146;, and excessively literal elements of Hicks's approach. Many critics linked him with William Powell Frith, whose own contemporary canvases like <span class="italic">Ramsgate Sands</span> (Royal Collection) of 1854 and <span class="italic">Derby Day</span> (Tate collection) of 1858 galvanized viewers at the Royal Academy and paved the way for the popularity with the public of his own&#151;and Hicks's&#151;interpretations of contemporary city life and its colourful activities and denizens. The two artists knew one another (Hicks mentions speaking to Frith about the hanging of a picture in the Royal Academy in 1880; Allwood, 60), but the extent of their interaction remains unexplored. Besides his visual indebtedness to Frith there is evidence that Hicks was inspired by the writings of the journalist George Augustus Sala  (ibid., 11&#150;13).<br>
<br>By 1867 Hicks seems to have shifted some of his focus to historical themes, and by the mid-1870s concentrated primarily on society portraits. The latter earned him a solid income, and his notebooks itemizing his subject pictures and portraits record the increasingly higher prices his portraiture commanded. After the 1870s prices of 350 guineas or more were not uncommon, and this earned him a very comfortable lifestyle. Beyond the realm of portraiture, throughout his career Hicks enjoyed a strong relationship with London dealers, selling most of his subject pictures to them rather than directly to individual collectors. Among his dealers were William Vokins (1815&#150;1895), Louis Flatow (1820&#150;1867), Henry Wallis (1804/5&#150;1890), and the Tooth Gallery, all well-established in the Victorian commercial art domain.<br>
<br>Besides his large urban canvases of crowds Hicks expended considerable energy on rural subjects, especially in his early career, painting such works as <span class="italic">Gleaning</span> (priv. coll.), 1855, which used a wet white technique &#145;to get [the] vibrations of heat&#146;  (Allwood, 20) in a manner reminiscent of William Mulready and the early Pre-Raphaelites. A more unconventional rustic subject was <span class="italic">Osier Whitening</span> (priv. coll.), 1856&#150;7, with its frieze-like arrangement of figures preparing willow for basket making and other uses.<br>
<br>A specialized aspect of Hicks's genre paintings relates to Victorian womanhood and femininity, as found in <span class="italic">Changing Homes</span> (Geffrye Museum, London) and the triptych <span class="italic">Woman's Mission</span> (central section, Tate collection), both exhibited in 1863 at the Royal Academy. The <span class="italic">Art Journal</span> reviewer and others highly approved of <span class="italic">Woman's Mission</span>, which defined the female roles of angelic guide, companion, and comforter, in relation to the lives and needs of males. The first compartment in the triptych places a young mother in nature guiding her child along a path, while in the second vignette a wife consoles her grieving husband as he contemplates bad news communicated by a black-edged letter he has just received. The third part or d&eacute;nouement depicts a young woman tenderly caring for her aged, bed-ridden father. In addition to numerous literary and religious heroines Hicks painted other works (whose current locations are unknown) with female protagonists, among them <span class="italic">Maternal Love</span> (exh. British Institution, 1856), <span class="italic">Maidenhood</span> (exh. RA, 1856), <span class="italic">Maid of All Work</span> (1856), <span class="italic">The Sinews of Old England</span> (1857), <span class="italic">The Croquet Player</span> (1864), <span class="italic">Reflected Smiles</span> (exh. RA, 1867), <span class="italic">L'Allegro</span> and <span class="italic">Il Penseroso</span> (both 1865; engravings after them, 1868, V&amp;A), <span class="italic">Woman's Sanctuary</span> (exh. RA, 1869), and an exotic rarity of 1871 entitled <span class="italic">The Banks of the Nile</span>.<br>
<br>A related recurrent theme in Hicks's oeuvre involved childhood, as attested by such titles as <span class="italic">The First Toy</span> (exh. RA, 1851), <span class="italic">The Pleasures of Childhood</span> (1858), <span class="italic">Childhood</span> and <span class="italic">Life's Sunshine</span> (both 1861), <span class="italic">First Step</span> and <span class="italic">Mother's Idol</span> (1866), <span class="italic">Pat-a-Cake</span> (1870; priv. coll.), <span class="italic">Football: Will He Do It?</span> (1875; priv. coll.), and the undated yet poignantly idealized <span class="italic">Parenthood</span>.<br>
<br>By the mid-1870s, however, perhaps for financial purposes, Hicks redirected his efforts to portraiture, producing scores of renderings of affluent sitters like <span class="italic">Lady Wimborne and Daughter</span> (exh. RA, 1884). None the less his career encompassed a range of subject matter, some historical (<span class="italic">The Bayeux Tapestry</span>, 1899), others religious (<span class="italic">The Lament of Jephthah's Daughter</span>, exh. RA, 1871), and many invoking modern life and experience. Besides the non-traditional paintings of London in subjects like the post office, fish market, or orphan election, others reflected more typical contemporary issues: poverty in <span class="italic">Parish Soup Kitchen</span> (exh. RA, 1852); emigration in <span class="italic">Letters from Home: Post Office and Store at the Australian Diggings</span> (exh. RA, 1872); racial issues in <span class="italic">Skins May Differ, but Affection Dwells in White and Black the Same</span> (exh. RA, 1874); and death in <span class="italic">A Cloud with a Silver Lining</span> (exh. RA, 1890; priv. coll.).<br>
<br>In content and style Hicks is sometimes termed a follower or imitator of Frith, the most illustrious of all Victorian genre painters. Like Frith, Hicks paid astute attention to detail, character, and incident and was a canny observer of the facial expressions, physiognomy, poses, manners, social class, attire, and objects consonant with the teeming microcosm of Victorian middle- and upper-class life. While much of the detail is crystalline and crisply rendered, Hicks himself expressed a desire to &#145;avoid hardness and tidiness&#146;. Accordingly he mentioned his 1867 canvas <span class="italic">Escape of the Countess of Morton</span> (exh. RA, 1868; priv. coll.) as one of &#145;many experiments &hellip; painted on a brilliant ground of broken color laid on with the palette knife&#146;  (Allwood, 56). Despite the broken colour effect in some works it is the pellucid, hard-edged, almost quasi-photographic style of his best-known panoramas of modern life that are mostly connected with his reputation and that of Victorian genre painting overall.<br>
<br>After the death of his first wife in 1880 Hicks married, in York on 23 September 1884, Anne (1842&#150;1908), daughter of William Ross, of Pendleton, Manchester. By the turn of the twentieth century they were living at Western House, Odiham, Hampshire, where Hicks died on 4 July 1914.<br>
