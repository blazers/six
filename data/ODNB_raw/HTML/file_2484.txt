<span class="headword">Bisset,  William</span>  (1669/70&#150;1747), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and pamphleteer</span>, was the son of William Bissett of Middlesex. His father was a royalist, but Bisset claimed he was not rewarded for his devotion to the crown. After being educated at Westminster School as a king's scholar (<i>c</i>.1684), he went in 1687 to Trinity College, Cambridge, where he was elected a scholar in 1688 and took his BA degree in 1691. Having taken orders, he was for some time in charge of the parish of Iver, Buckinghamshire. From the start of his career he was a pugnacious clergyman. While at Iver he married, and his wife brought him some money. With this he set up a coach, which gave his enemies occasion to make many sneers at his foolish ostentation in the pamphlet war he afterwards engaged in. He defended himself in the second part of <span class="italic">The Modern Fanatick</span> by declaring that he bought this &#145;leathern conveniency&#146; in order to enable himself to fulfil an engagement to preach three times a week in a neighbouring parish. During this period of his life he appears to have been industrious in his clerical work. He became rector of Whiston, Northamptonshire, in 1697. Having been elected elder brother of the hospital church of St Katharine by the Tower in 1699, he resided much in London, leaving his wife and children at Whiston.<br>
<br>The first of the books for which Bisset is remembered, <span class="italic">Plain English</span>, was published in 1705. It was the text of his sermon before the Society for the Reformation of Manners, which he had been asked to preach as a substitute at the last moment. To the astonishment of all, he attacked the society for wanting to quieten the people rather than reform them; he also criticized its prosecution of poor sinners, rather than the affluent and prominent. The tract caused a controversy in which Isaac Sharpe responded with <span class="italic">Plain English Made Plainer</span>, but Bisset produced six editions of the work. As a low-churchman and a whig he was offended by Dr Sacheverell's sermon at St Paul's on 5 November 1709, and at once preached and published a reply to it. He followed up this attack in a pamphlet entitled <span class="italic">The Modern Fanatick</span>, which appeared in 1710. In it he raked up Sacheverell's family background, and published stories of Sacheverell's debts to besmirch his character. Nevertheless <span class="italic">The Modern Fanatick</span> ran through eleven editions in 1710 alone. The pamphlet stimulated many replies, and among them one by Dr W. King. Bisset responded by publishing a second part of <span class="italic">The Modern Fanatick</span> in February 1711, and a third part followed in May 1714. William Cole, in his manuscript &#145;Athen&aelig; Cantabrigienses&#146;, described him as &#145;almost a madman&#146;  (Cole MSS), yet the character of the pamphlets put forth by both sides in this controversy is little proof of the sanity of any of the parties concerned in it. A more recent historian has called him a &#145;muckraker&#146;  (Holmes, 14). Bisset was the champion of an unpopular cause. He fought with courage, and bad as his weapons were, they were of much the same kind as those used against him. There is no reason to doubt the truth of his assertion that he was constantly mobbed and insulted, especially by Sacheverell's &#145;female proselytes&#146;. He also declares that there were three attempts on his life. He deserves credit for having raised an indignant protest against the cruel floggings then often inflicted on soldiers. A probably exaggerated account of the flogging of a man and his wife is given in the collective edition of the <span class="italic">Fanatick</span> tracts. He was made chaplain to Queen Caroline. He died on 7 November 1747.<br>
