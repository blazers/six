<span class="headword">Knatchbull,  John Ulick</span>, seventh Baron Brabourne of Brabourne <span class="st"> [<em>known as </em>John Brabourne]</span>  (1924&#150;2005), <span class="occ">film and television producer</span>, was born on 9 November 1924 at 7 Upper Belgrave Street, London, the younger son of Michael Herbert Rudolf Knatchbull, formerly Knatchbull-Hugessen, fifth Baron Brabourne of Brabourne (1895&#150;1939), and his wife, Lady Doreen Geraldine, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Browne (<i>d</i>. 1979), third daughter of George Ulick Browne, sixth marquess of Sligo. Part of his childhood was spent in India, where his father was governor successively of Bombay (1933&#150;7) and of Bengal (1937&#150;9). He was sent to Eton College, which he did not enjoy, before going to Brasenose College, Oxford, where he passed his military exam after nine months and immediately joined the Coldstream Guards. He became seventh baron, and sixteenth baronet, in September 1943, when his elder brother, Norton (<i>b</i>. 1922), an officer in the Grenadier Guards, was shot by the Germans after his escape from a train in northern Italy. Brabourne was wounded himself in combat near Brussels, and later became aide-de-camp successively to General Sir William Slim and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/31480/', "Admiral Lord Louis Mountbatten")</script>, when supreme allied commander south-east Asia. He was demobilized with the rank of captain in 1946. On 26 October that year, at Romsey Abbey, Hampshire, with princesses Elizabeth and Margaret acting as bridesmaids, he married Mountbatten's elder daughter, Lady Patricia Edwina Victoria Mountbatten (<i>b</i>. 1924). The marriage was happy, and they had five sons and two daughters.<br>
<br>Brabourne was fascinated by cinema. At Oxford he had visited the cinema twice a day, and three times on Sunday. With Mountbatten's assistance he obtained an introduction to the producer Ian Dalrymple, who employed him as a production assistant under the name John Brabourne. During the next seven years Brabourne worked his way up the production ladder, principally under Herbert Wilcox and Daniel Angel. Well aware that Brabourne's father-in-law was now the first sea lord, Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger employed Brabourne as production manager on <span class="italic">The Battle of the River Plate</span> (1956), for which the Royal Navy's Mediterranean Fleet agreed to recreate the movement of ships off wartime Uruguay.<br>
<br>Brabourne's d&eacute;but production was <span class="italic">Harry Black</span> (1958). Backed by Twentieth Century Fox, it starred Stewart Granger as a professional hunter who tracks down a Bengal tiger that has been menacing an Indian village. Brabourne's next two films, both directed by Lewis Gilbert, had naval themes: <span class="italic">Sink the Bismarck!</span> (1960), starring Kenneth More and Dana Wynter, and <span class="italic">HMS Defiant</span> (1962), starring Alec Guinness and Dirk Bogarde.<br>
<br>In 1960, together with Anthony Havelock-Allan, Brabourne formed British Home Entertainment, a cable television service that, as a partner in &#145;pay-TV&#146;, offered quality productions to discerning audiences on a pay-per-view basis, starting in 1966. Brabourne produced film versions of Laurence Olivier's National Theatre productions of Shakespeare's <span class="italic">Othello</span> (1965) and Strindberg's <span class="italic">Dance of Death</span> (1968). Other productions included <span class="italic">The Mikado</span> (1967). British Home Entertainment's biggest success, however, was its live transmission of the heavyweight boxing match between Cassius Clay and Henry Cooper, when subscribers sold their neighbours ringside seats in their sitting rooms. This early venture into cable television closed in 1968 when, under pressure from the BBC, the government refused to allow the &#145;pay-TV&#146; experiment to expand. Brabourne's and Havelock-Allan's next venture was a Paramount-backed production of <span class="italic">Up the Junction</span> (1967), Nell Dunn's tale of a Chelsea girl's discovery of the gritty realities of working-class life across the river in Battersea. Starring Suzy Kendall and Denis Waterman, it was the top money-maker for 1968 in British cinemas. Brabourne and Havelock-Allan went on to produce Shakespeare's <span class="italic">Romeo and Juliet</span> (1968), in which the director Franco Zeffirelli infused Shakespeare's verse with the teenage lovers' physical passion. Starring the newcomers Leonard Whiting and Olivia Hussey, it was backed by Paramount and the Italian public service broadcaster RAI. Financially it was very successful, grossing over $14.5 million in North America alone.<br>
<br>For several years Brabourne had enjoyed a close working relationship with his production manager, Richard Goodwin. In 1971 he acted as executive producer on <span class="italic">Tales of Beatrix Potter</span>, a musical starring members of the Royal Ballet, which Goodwin produced and scripted from an idea by his wife, Christine Edzard. The same team produced a follow-up in 1979: <span class="italic">Stories from a Flying Trunk</span>, based on the fairy tales of Hans Christian Andersen. Brabourne and Goodwin turned to fairy tales of another genre with their adaptations of four Agatha Christie mysteries: <span class="italic">Murder on the Orient Express</span> (1974), <span class="italic">Death on the Nile</span> (1978), <span class="italic">The Mirror Crack'd</span> (1980), and <span class="italic">Evil under the Sun</span> (1982). They distanced the narratives of all four films from Christie's original stories by adding period elements to her formal plot structures, and camp sensibilities to her sparse characterization. Three featured the Belgian detective Hercule Poirot, while <span class="italic">The Mirror Crack'd</span> was a Miss Marple story. For <span class="italic">Murder on the Orient Express</span> Brabourne carefully packaged a Hollywood director, Sidney Lumet, with a raft of British and Hollywood stars, and for twenty years it held the record as the British film industry's most profitable film. The other three were less successful, however. During the 1970s Brabourne also turned to children's films, acting as executive producer on three projects backed by the Children's Film Foundation: <span class="italic">Smokey Joe's Revenge</span> (1974), <span class="italic">The Copter Kids</span> (1976), and <span class="italic">Seal Island</span> (1977).<br>
<br>In 1979 one of Brabourne's sons, Nicholas, was murdered by the Provisional IRA, along with Brabourne's mother, the dowager Lady Brabourne, and father-in-law, Lord Mountbatten, and their Irish boat boy, Paul Maxwell, when it blew up their fishing boat off the west coast of Ireland. Brabourne, his wife (who became Countess Mountbatten of Burma by special remainder on the death of her father), and Nicholas's twin brother, Timothy, were all seriously wounded. Brabourne courageously returned to film production, and scored a success with <span class="italic">A Passage to India</span> (1984), which was scripted and directed by David Lean, after Brabourne's long struggle to persuade the fellows of King's College, Cambridge (the author's literary executors), to allow him to film E. M. Forster's book. His final film for the cinema was a third collaboration with Goodwin and Edzard, <span class="italic">Little Dorrit</span> (1987), which ran for nearly six hours. As a producer Brabourne's main interests lay in the story, the script, and the editing. Although the director was in charge on the studio floor, for Brabourne it was the producer who chose the story and ensured that the film actually reached the screen. His films were well regarded by his colleagues, and he received two Oscar nominations, as the co-producer of <span class="italic">Romeo and Juliet</span> and <span class="italic">A Passage to India</span>.<br>
<br>As cinema audiences declined Brabourne became increasingly involved in television. In 1969 Mountbatten refused to allow Associated Rediffusion to make the <span class="italic">Life and Times of Lord Mountbatten</span> unless Brabourne became the associate producer for the series. Brabourne also used his contacts with the royal family to persuade the queen to donate the substantial fee that she received from the BBC documentary <span class="italic">The Royal Family</span> (1969) to the embryonic British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA), which he and others were attempting to establish with suitable west London premises. He produced three television series, <span class="italic">Romantic versus Classic Art</span> (1973), <span class="italic">The National Gallery: a Private View</span> (1974), and <span class="italic">Leontyne</span> (1987), as well as <span class="italic">A Much-Maligned Monarch</span> (1976), a television programme about George III, in which Alistair Cooke interviewed Prince Charles.<br>
<br>From the mid-1970s Brabourne became more widely involved in industry matters. He was a director of the Copyright Promotions Group, Euston Films, Thorn EMI, and Thames Television (becoming chairman of the latter in 1991&#150;3), and a governor of the British Film Institute (of which he was also made a fellow), the National Film School, the British Screen Advisory Council, and the National Museum of Photography, Film and Television. In 1975 Harold Wilson appointed him a member of his working party on the British film industry, and its successor, the interim action committee; and in the same year Brabourne became a trustee of BAFTA. He also served on many committees in the fields of education, science, charitable work, and Kentish matters, some of which he also chaired. He was particularly attached to the Caldecott Foundation, a therapeutic community for disturbed children, of which he was chairman from 1961 to 1992. His chairmanship was always scrupulously fair and his interventions were few, but always incisive, and finely calibrated. He was appointed CBE in 1993.<br>
<br>Brabourne was almost universally liked, although his polite and diffident manner masked a steely mind that understood the values of discretion and, on occasion, silence. He died on 22 September 2005 at his home, Newhouse, Mersham, Ashford, Kent, of heart and kidney failure. He was survived by his wife, Countess Mountbatten of Burma, four sons, and two daughters, and was succeeded as eighth baron by his son Norton (<i>b</i>. 1947).<br>
