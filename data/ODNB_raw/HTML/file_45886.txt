<span class="headword">Cockburn,  John, of Ormiston</span>  (1679&#150;1758), <span class="occ">politician and agricultural improver</span>, was born in Scotland, the second son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5764/', "Adam Cockburn (c.1656&#150;1735)")</script> of Ormiston, lord justice clerk and lord of session with the judicial title Lord Ormiston, and his first wife, Lady Susanna Hamilton, daughter of the fourth earl of Haddington. He was educated at the University of Glasgow between 1691 and 1695. In 1700 he married Lady Beatrice Carmichael (<i>d</i>. 1702), daughter of the first earl of Hyndford; they had no children. His second wife was Arabella, third daughter of Anthony Rowe of Muswell Hill; they had one son, George, of the Navy Office.<br>
<br>Cockburn represented Haddingtonshire in the Scottish parliament from 1703. He was a junior member of the squadrone, and represented the party on the commission to negotiate the treaty of union with England in 1706. He duly voted for the parliamentary union of Scotland and England in 1707. He was a member of the parliament of Great Britain until 1741 and held minor office as a lord of trade, from 1714 to 1717, and then as a lord of the Admiralty until 1732. He gained a reputation for competence in office but was passed over for the position of first lord, after which he gave his political support to the opposition. Although Cockburn did not stand for re-election in 1741 he was reappointed to the Board of Admiralty from 1742 to 1744.<br>
<br>It is doubtful whether it was his failure to retain office that caused Cockburn to turn away from political life, because his main interests were already directed to agricultural improvement, particularly of his own estate of Ormiston in Haddingtonshire. His father had initiated improvements and these were greatly extended when John succeeded him, his elder brother having died young. Through much of the period when he was devoting his energies to improvement Cockburn was away in London, but he always directed and followed every aspect of his estate by correspondence. His improvements were those that others were to follow later in the century&#151;enclosure, the planting of new crops such as barley and turnips, the use of artificial grasses and rotations, the planting of trees&#151;but in Cockburn's case they formed part of two distinctive features of his work.<br>
<br>The first was his deliberate policy of granting long leases, usually of nineteen but sometimes even of thirty-eight years, to ensure that the tenants were encouraged to adopt the long-term outlook on improvements that Cockburn deemed essential. In this scheme he was fortunate in having among his tenantry succeeding generations of the Wight family, who made their own independent contribution to agricultural improvement and with whom he corresponded regularly when away. Cockburn's attitude to his tenantry, as well as his political philosophy, was expressed well in a letter he wrote to one of them:<blockquote>I hate tyranny in every shape, and shall always have greater pleasure in seeing my tenants making something under me, which they can call their own, than in getting a little more myself, by squeezing a hundred poor families, till their necessities make them my slaves. (<span class="italic">Farmer's Magazine</span>, 136)</blockquote>Second, Cockburn extended his improvements to the entire reorganization of his estate. The village of Ormiston was rebuilt and used as the centre for a range of industrial activities, notably the manufacture and bleaching of linen. It became a place where others gained insights into the new ways and where Cockburn promoted them by launching a discussion group in 1736.<br>
<br>Posterity has accorded Cockburn his due recognition as an agriculturist but he himself did not reap a financial reward. Unable to finance the costly wait that (as he constantly reminded his tenants) had to be endured to gain the long-term benefits of improvement, he was forced to sell Ormiston to the earl of Hopetoun in 1747. As the family historian wryly commented, &#145;for the interests of his family, it would have been well had he been satisfied with a political life; but unfortunately he was an enthusiastic agriculturist&#146;  (Cockburn-Hood, 157). Cockburn died at his son's home in London on 12 November 1758.<br>
