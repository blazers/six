<span class="headword">Reid, Sir  Robert  Gillespie</span>  (1842&#150;1908), <span class="occ">railway contractor and entrepreneur in Canada</span>, was born on 12 October 1842 in Coupar Angus, Perthshire, Scotland, the son of William Robertson Reid, a linen miller, and his wife, Catherine Gillespie. He was educated locally, and trained as a stonemason. In 1865, drawn by the gold rush, he emigrated to Australia, but was disappointed as a prospector and worked on railway viaducts in the Blue Mountains. He was back in Scotland between 1869 and 1871, then moved to Canada, where by 1872 he was working on the Grand Trunk Railway's bridge between Fort Erie (Ontario) and Buffalo (New York). His family&#151;he had married Harriet Duff in Auckland, New Zealand, in 1865&#151;joined him the following year.<br>
<br>During this period Reid established himself as a builder of railway bridges. In the late 1870s and early 1880s he worked in the United States, but returned to Canada in 1883 to take a series of bridge contracts with the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR). He was closely involved with the line being built by the CPR along the north shore of Lake Superior, including the very difficult Jackfish Bay section. In 1886 he completed the Lachine Bridge near Montreal, where he was then living. The following year he contracted to build his first railway line&#151;the CPR's Sudbury branch&#151;as well as, on Cape Breton, the foundations of the Grand Narrows Bridge and a section of line for the Intercolonial Railway.<br>
<br>By this time Reid was wealthy, well established, respected for his professional skill and reliability, and closely connected to the prominent and influential Montreal businessmen who controlled the CPR, of which he became a director. It is not surprising, therefore, that in 1890 the government of Newfoundland, led by Sir William Whiteway, awarded him, in partnership with G. H. Middleton, the contract to complete a partially built railway from St John's, the capital, to Hall's Bay on the island's north-east coast. In a second contract, settled in 1893, Reid and the government agreed to abandon the idea of a terminus at Hall's Bay and to continue the line across the island to Port aux Basques, where a ferry could connect with the Intercolonial on Cape Breton. In addition, Reid agreed to operate the railway for ten years in return for substantial land grants&#151;10,000 acres per mile, for a total entitlement of nearly 4000 square miles.<br>
<br>Reid's financial stability was threatened in 1894&#150;5, when, in the wake of the collapse of the colony's two banks, the Newfoundland government hung on the edge of bankruptcy. Reid was being paid in government bonds, which suddenly became virtually worthless. His precise role in the events which followed is unclear, but it is probable that he encouraged the Bank of Montreal, with which he was closely connected (he later became a director), to go to Newfoundland, take over the government's accounts, and advance temporary loans. Reid also did his best to facilitate the negotiation of terms of union between Newfoundland and Canada in March 1895. When it proved impossible to arrive at suitable terms he used his influence to help Robert Bond obtain an emergency loan in Montreal, which enabled the colony to avoid default and to stabilize its finances.<br>
<br>The main line of the Newfoundland Railway was completed in 1897. The following year Reid signed a third contract with a new government led by Sir James Winter. It was a complex and wide-ranging document, which represented the aspirations of his family as much as himself. At that point, suffering from &#145;inflammatory rheumatism&#146;, Reid lived in Montreal, spent much time abroad unsuccessfully seeking a cure, and visited Newfoundland infrequently; the business there was looked after by his sons (the eldest, William D. Reid, was general manager). The deal provided that Reid would operate the entire Newfoundland railway system for fifty years, at which time it would become the property of his successors. Reid would pay $1 million and receive an additional 2400 square miles in land grants. He agreed in addition, among other concessions, to take over the government's telegraph system and dry dock, and to operate the Gulf ferry and a coastal steamer service. Clearly, the Reids intended to become much more than railway contractors.<br>
<br>The new contract sparked heated controversy within the colony, and was severely criticized by the colonial secretary, Joseph Chamberlain. The Winter government was eventually defeated in the legislature and replaced by an anti-contract government led by Bond, who was confirmed in office by a landslide election victory in 1900. The result of prolonged negotiations was a revised contract in 1901 whereby &#145;Czar Reid&#146;, as the local press called him, surrendered the reversionary interest in the railway, the telegraph system, and a large amount of land in return for financial compensation (to be decided in part by arbitration) and permission to assign his assets to the Reid Newfoundland Company, of which he became the first president.<br>
<br>It was not long before relations between Bond and the Reid interests deteriorated, so much so that in 1905 Reid offered to sell out to the Newfoundland government. When the offer was rejected, Reid and his sons made a determined and successful attempt to destroy Bond and install a more friendly administration. This was by no means the first time they had intervened in local politics, but perhaps the most blatant example. Their candidate to replace Bond was Sir Edward Morris, who had supported the 1898 contract. In 1907 he left the Bond government, and the following year, funded largely by Reid money, started a new party and a new newspaper. By the spring of 1909 he was prime minister.<br>
<br>Sir Robert Reid&#151;he was knighted in 1907&#151;died at 275 Drummond Street, Montreal, on 3 June 1908, before these plans had come to fruition; he was cremated on 6 June at the city's Mount Royal crematorium. The company he had founded, with its virtual monopoly on public transportation and its extensive land holdings, remained a major factor in the colony's political and economic life into the 1920s. In addition to the operation of the railway and their steamers, the Reids were closely involved with the development of Newfoundland's newsprint and electricity industries. Reid himself, quiet and unostentatious, was remembered more with respect than with affection as a competent, dependable contractor of considerable integrity&#151;the blame for the family's questionable political behaviour being placed, with some justice, on his sons.<br>
