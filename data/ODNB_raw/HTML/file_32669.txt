<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Cunningham,  William</span>  (1849&#150;1919), <span class="occ">economic historian and Church of England clergyman</span>, was born on 29 December 1849 at 50 Queen Street, Edinburgh, the second of three children born to James Cunningham, a lawyer, and his second wife, Elizabeth Boyle Dunlop, youngest daughter of Alexander Dunlop of Keppoch, Dunbartonshire. Religion was an important part of family life: William's father moved from the Episcopal church to founding a branch of the Church of England in Edinburgh, and later to the Free Church of Scotland. His mother came from a strong Presbyterian background, and her brother took a leading part in the Free Church.<br>
<br>Cunningham suffered from asthma and was educated at home by an English tutor. From the age of twelve he intermittently attended Edinburgh Institution (1861&#150;4), before proceeding to the Edinburgh Academy (1864&#150;5). In 1865 he entered the arts course at Edinburgh University, where he received his MA in 1869. In the summer of 1868 he studied German at the University of T&uuml;bingen, and entered Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, in 1869. In 1872 he won a scholarship at Trinity College and was listed first with Frederick William Maitland for the moral science tripos.<br>
<br>Having resolved his religious doubts by embracing the personal theology and social views of F. D. Maurice, Cunningham hoped to combine a clerical and academic career. He was ordained in 1873 and served as a curate at Horningsea, near Cambridge (1873&#150;4), as chaplain at Trinity College (1880&#150;91), curate of Great St Mary's, Cambridge (1879&#150;83), of which he was subsequently vicar (1887&#150;1908), and as archdeacon of Ely (1907&#150;19). Cunningham took both his pastoral and administrative duties seriously throughout his career and in later years was active in convocation.<br>
<br>Cunningham was attracted to both Hegelian and Comtist philosophy but his failure to win a fellowship threatened his academic prospects. He wrote a dissertation, <span class="italic">The Influence of Descartes on Metaphysical Speculation in England</span>, which was published in 1876 and took a doctorate in mental science from Edinburgh in the same year. He became a DD at Cambridge in 1889 with a dissertation on Augustine of Hippo. Although he was deputy to the Knightbridge professor of moral philosophy in 1879, a Hulsean lecturer in 1885, a Birkbeck lecturer in ecclesiastical history in 1886&#150;90 and 1908&#150;10, and wrote dozens of papers and pamphlets on church subjects, he failed in his applications for a permanent university teaching position in philosophy or theology.<br>
<br>Instead Cunningham launched his academic career through the new university extension scheme, serving as an extension lecturer (1874&#150;8) in Leeds, Bradford, and Liverpool, and teaching as many as 600 students per term. On 1 June 1876 he married his cousin Ad&egrave;le Rebecca Dunlop, daughter of Andrew Anderson Dunlop, a merchant of Dublin. The couple had two children: James Michael, who died as an officer in France in 1918, and Audrey, a historian and biographer of her father. In 1878 Cunningham was named an examiner for the new history tripos at Cambridge. His duties included lecturing on economic history. He had attended Alfred Marshall's lectures in economics and had developed a strong interest in social questions. Realizing that a textbook was needed in economic history, he seized the opportunity. <span class="italic">The Growth of English Industry and Commerce</span> (1882) was an immediate success and laid the foundation for the study of economic history at Cambridge. It went through six editions and expanded to fill two large volumes.<br>
<br>Cunningham was an early supporter of the education of women at Cambridge and his subsequent volumes owed much to the assistance of the first generation of women economic historians, including L. C. A. Tomn, who, as L. C. A. Knowles, occupied the first chair in economic history in England at London. From 1884 to 1888 Cunningham served as a university lecturer in history and from 1888 to 1906 he was a lecturer at Trinity College. From 1891 to 1897 he was the Tooke professor of economics and statistics at King's College, London. In 1891 he was elected a fellow of Trinity College. In 1899 he taught at Harvard and in 1914 he gave the Lowell lectures in Boston. Cunningham was a founding fellow of the British Academy, president of the economic section of the British Association (1891, 1905), and president of the Royal Historical Society (1911). He received honorary degrees from Edinburgh and Brown universities. In 1880&#150;81 he travelled widely in India, and in later years also visited South Africa and Palestine.<br>
<br>Cunningham's reputation rests largely on his economic history, which has been called neo-mercantilist, and as an apologist for British imperialism. He explained that Britain's economic success was not rooted in <i>laissez-faire</i>, but in a tradition of national economic regulation from the medieval through the mercantilist periods. Indeed, he put forward the view that Victorian free trade policy had been the imperialism of free trade. Cunningham's support for an inductive economics placed him in opposition to Alfred Marshall's efforts to lay a more deductive and theoretical foundation for political economy in Britain. These differences, aggravated by personal and academic competition, broke into an open controversy with Cunningham's paper of 1892, &#145;The perversion of economic history&#146;. The English <i>Methodenstreit</i>, the conflict between inductive and deductive economics, was further inflamed when Cunningham and most of the economic historians supported protection during the Edwardian tariff reform agitation, while Marshall and most economic theorists defended free trade. In his numerous writings on tariff reform, Cunningham insisted on the proposition that economics must be seen in relation to a particular time and place.<br>
<br>Cunningham expounded his imperial views in numerous articles, speeches, and books, such as his two-volume <span class="italic">An Essay on Western Civilization in its Economic Aspects</span> (1898&#150;1900). His vision consisted of a combination of British nationalism, an established religion with a social gospel, an evolutionary view of society, and a belief that economic history and political economy should be an applied subject in the service of Western civilization, the British empire, and conservative social reform. His views were an important component of a social imperialism which supplanted a tradition of liberal individualism in Britain. After several years of ill health he died on 10 June 1919 in Cambridge. The funeral was held at Great St Mary's on June 13 and he was buried in the cemetery at Wilburton, halfway between Cambridge and Ely. His wife survived him.<br>
