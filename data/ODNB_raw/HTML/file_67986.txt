<span class="headword">Nicks <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Barker]</span>,  Catherine</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1709), <span class="occ">merchant</span>, arrived in India in 1678 as Catherine Barker, &#145;a participant in one of the early nuptial sweepstakes sponsored by the company&#146;  (Saxe, 136). In England Catherine had at least one sister, Dionysia, and one brother, Ted. Nothing is known of Catherine's life prior to her arrival in India, though on the evidence of her autograph letters she does not appear to have had an especially good education. On 4 November 1680 she married John Nicks (<i>d</i>. 1711), secretary to the Fort St George (Madras) council, who had arrived in India in 1668.<br>
<br>Both Catherine and John developed extensive private trading interests during the 1680s and prospered thereby. In 1688 John was made chief of the new &#145;Conimeer&#146; factory situated north of Pondicherry, an appointment only confirmed by the court on the condition that the company's position was not prejudiced &#145;by his Wife's crafty trading &hellip; [who] makes her gains of our loss&#146;  (<span class="italic">Diary of William Hedges</span>, 2.cclviii). Indeed, Catherine was certainly notorious, and possibly unique at the time, for trading under her own name rather than that of her husband. In 1691 John was dismissed his position because of a debt he owed the company, and in May 1692 was imprisoned at Fort St George. In that same year Catherine and Elihu Yale (1649&#150;1721), president of Fort St George, allegedly conspired to steal a quantity of fine cloth from the company's Conimeer warehouse. A warrant was issued for Catherine's arrest but she appears not to have been imprisoned.<br>
<br>Catherine also attained notoriety as a result of her alleged romance with Yale. Rumours of an affair, the veracity of which has since been disproved by Yale's biographer Hiram Bingham, were circulated by Yale's critics who claimed the relationship had begun by the time of their collusion in the Conimeer theft, when Catherine lived with Yale and a second woman, Hieronima de Paiva, during several visits to Madras. Yale's opponents also maintained that he was father to three of Catherine's children, an allegation likewise since discredited. Catherine had ten children in total. These included eight daughters (Anne, Isabella, Jane, Katherine (or Catherine), Mary, Sibella, Betty, and Ursa) and two sons (John, who died at Madras on 6 December 1686, and Elihu, who went to England). In 1699 John Nicks went to England with Betty and Ursa, where he was able to clear his name with the company. He returned to Madras as a free merchant but lived estranged from Catherine until his death on 14 March 1711.<br>
<br>During this time Catherine expanded her trading interests, many of which were clearly illicit. She owned two country ships and had shares in various others, and traded extensively in a variety of English and East Indian goods including diamonds. She appears to have been highly motivated in her trading to provide for the education and social advancement of her children in England, where they were under the supervision of Yale, their godfather, and Dionysia and Henry Toombs, Catherine's sister and brother-in-law. Periodically Catherine remitted portions of her estate to Yale, who, however, proved to be an unreliable agent.<br>
<br>Catherine died in Madras on 9 December 1709 and was buried in the compound of St Mary's Church, Fort St George. Her son-in-law William Warre acted as executor of her modest estate of about 20,000 pagodas (about &pound;7000), over which there was some wrangling. A substantial portion of Catherine's funds in England, designed for the use of her children, was lost in 1711 following the bankruptcy of Sir Steven Evance, with whom Yale had deposited the money. As a summary, Colonel Henry Yule's assessment of Catherine as a &#145;crafty and ill-conducted &hellip; but warm-hearted woman&#146;  (<span class="italic">Diary of William Hedges</span>, 2.cclx) seems fair.<br>
