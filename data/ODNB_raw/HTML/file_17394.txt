<span class="headword">McCombie,  William</span>  (1809&#150;1870), <span class="occ">farmer and journalist</span>, was born on 7 May 1809 at Alford, Aberdeenshire, the son of William McCombie, farmer, and his wife, Marjory Wishart. McCombie received little formal education and was largely self-educated under the influence of his mother. <span class="italic">The Spectator</span> regarded him as the greatest example of the autodidact in Scotland after his fellow journalist Hugh Miller  (<span class="italic">The Spectator</span>, 14 May 1870). His early life was spent on his father's farm with his spare time devoted to the composition of essays on religious and philosophical subjects. These essays were collected in 1835 under the title of <span class="italic">Hours of Thought</span> (1835), which reached a third, expanded edition by 1856; a second early work, <span class="italic">Moral Agency and Man as a Moral Agent</span> (1842), was an attack on Calvinist theology. In early 1840 McCombie married Anne, daughter of Joseph Robertson of Aberdeen. In this period McCombie was also active in the Mutual Improvement Movement which operated in the north-east of Scotland, becoming honorary president of the Aberdeenshire and Banffshire Mutual Instruction Union. The activities of this organization extended beyond adult education and provided a link between the Free Church of Scotland, the Liberal Party, and the conservative peasantry. It is in connection with a lecture for a Mutual Improvement Society in 1850 that a description is provided of McCombie as &#145;a tall slightly stooping man, in the prime of life &hellip; with a fine intellectual face, a keen searching, yet pleasant and slightly humorous glance and expression&#146;  (Smith, 67).<br>
<br>From 1849 McCombie was on the staff of the <span class="italic">Aberdeen Gazette</span>, and soon became the editor, changing the title of the paper to the <span class="italic">Aberdeen Free Press</span> in 1853. The paper was a supporter of the Liberal cause and of the Free Church which was powerful in Aberdeen, although McCombie himself was a Baptist. Under McCombie's editorship it supported some quite advanced causes such as universal suffrage. In journalistic terms McCombie's regime saw an improved standard of editorship but this may have had more to do with his assistant and successor, William Alexander, than with McCombie, who devoted more time to farming than to day-to-day editorial duties. McCombie was a keen Liberal in politics and wholly behind the Liberal cause, being particularly active in the cause of tenant farmers who became increasingly restive throughout Scotland in the 1860s, especially on the issue of the Game Laws. His cousin, William McCombie of Tillyfour (<i>bap</i>. 1805, <i>d</i>. 1880), the famous cattle breeder, was Liberal MP for West Aberdeenshire from 1868 to 1876 and president of the Scottish chamber of agriculture. The <span class="italic">Aberdeen Free Press</span> also reported at great length on the American Civil War, which was an important influence on Scottish Liberalism in the mid-nineteenth century. McCombie positioned himself firmly behind the North on the grounds of the evil of slavery, which he felt had been forced on the South by Britain in the eighteenth century.<br>
<br>McCombie's final publication in 1869 was a pamphlet entitled <span class="italic">The Irish land question practically considered: a letter to the Rt Hon William E. Gladstone, M.P.</span> (with whom he had corresponded during the 1860s). In order to prepare himself for constructive comment on the Irish land issue McCombie toured Ireland in the autumn of 1868. In the pamphlet he argued that Irish nationalism was &#145;exotic&#146;  (p. 13) and was only sustained by the continuing injustices of the land system and the church. If these two issues were dealt with then, in McCombie's view, it would &#145;speedily die&#146;  (ibid.). He was critical of both tenants and landowners, the former for their lack of initiative and exertion and the latter for their selfishness and &#145;utter disregard for the public interest&#146;  (ibid., 33). Nevertheless, he felt that &#145;were the resources and capabilities of the soil properly developed it might maintain in comfort as large a population as that before the famine&#146;  (ibid., 10). This pamphlet was perhaps McCombie's most accessible and most practical piece of work; his other writings were, like much of his journalism, rather abstract and even metaphysical.<br>
<br>McCombie was an active lay preacher in the John Street Baptist Church in Aberdeen and his <span class="italic">Sermons and Lectures</span> (1871) were prepared for posthumous publication by his daughter. He also published two volumes commemorating the work of George Murray, a shoemaker and journalist (<span class="italic">Literary Remains of George Murray</span>, 1860) and Alexander Bethune, a farmer poet (<span class="italic">Memoirs of Alexander Bethune</span>, 1845). His other principal publication was a collection of essays on the subject of education: <span class="italic">On Education in its Constituents, Objects and Issues</span> (1857).<br>
<br>McCombie remained a practical farmer throughout his career, first on his father's farm at Cairnballoch, and then, from the late 1860s, at Milton of Kemnay, also in Aberdeenshire. <span class="italic">The Spectator</span> recorded in 1870 that &#145;he rapidly made his fine farm a model for both the completeness of its arrangements and the quality of its stock&#146;  (14 May 1870). Indeed, McCombie's reputation as an agriculturist did much to improve the profile of the <span class="italic">Aberdeen Free Press</span> which until his editorship had been in the shadow of the <span class="italic">Aberdeen Journal</span>.<br>
<br>In early 1870 McCombie was laid low with a severe attack of bronchitis and chronic dyspepsia, ailments from which he had suffered for most of his life, and which resulted in his death on 6 May 1870 at 9 Broadford Place, Aberdeen. He was survived by his widow and their four sons and two daughters.<br>
<br>McCombie could be characterized merely as a provincial newspaper editor and obscure essayist, but within the confines of the north-east of Scotland, however, he was much more than this. The very clear regional identity of this part of the country, allied to his political activities, especially concerning the fate of tenant farmers, assured him a wider prominence. He was also well known as a practical farmer. Much of his literary output, with the possible exception of his <span class="italic">Hours of Thought</span> and his pamphlet, <span class="italic">The Irish Land Question</span>, was rather obscure; on his death <span class="italic">The Spectator</span> commented &#145;the world has never given a welcome to his books &hellip; his written dissertations were not distinctive or complete enough to be singled out for special remembrance&#146;  (14 May 1870). His contemporary prominence stemmed from his editorship of the <span class="italic">Aberdeen Free Press</span> which was sustained and developed by his successor, William Alexander, who turned the paper into a daily in 1872. McCombie's life, however, fits a nineteenth-century Scottish stereotype which emphasized his self-education, his piety, and his contribution to his locality.<br>
