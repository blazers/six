<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Boyle,  Richard</span>, third earl of Burlington and fourth earl of Cork  (1694&#150;1753), <span class="occ">architect, collector, and patron of the arts</span>, was born on 25 April 1694 at Burlington House, Piccadilly, London, the only son of Charles Boyle, second earl of Burlington and third earl of Cork (<i>d</i>. 1704), and Juliana (1672&#150;1750), daughter and heir to Henry Noel, second son of the fourth Viscount Campden. He was educated at home, and at his father's death on 9 February 1704 he succeeded to his titles and estates. In 1715 Burlington was made lord treasurer of Ireland and governor of co. Cork and was sworn of the Irish privy council. In the same year he became vice-admiral of the county of York and lord lieutenant of the East and West Ridings of Yorkshire. Burlington was sworn of the privy council of England on 15 May 1729. His nomination as knight of the Garter came on 18 May 1730, and he was installed at Windsor on 18 June 1730. On 21 June 1731 he was made captain of the band of pensioners. His legal claim to the barony of Clifford was granted on 25 May 1737. In May 1733 Burlington resigned all his offices, apparently because George II failed to honour a promise to appoint him to a high household office, probably that of lord treasurer. Until that date he was a supporter of Walpole's government but in the pre-sessional forecast of January 1734 was listed as against the ministry. He attended the House of Lords only intermittently after coming of age in 1715, and showed particular interest in debates and committees concerned with Ireland, Yorkshire, and other personal interests.<br>
<br>Burlington was elected a fellow of the Royal Society on 1 November 1722 and a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries on 5 February 1724. On 21 March 1721 he married Dorothy Savile (1699&#150;1758), lady of the bedchamber to Queen Caroline [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/66564/', "Boyle, Dorothy")</script>], eldest daughter and coheir of William Savile, marquess of Halifax, and Mary, daughter of Daniel Finch, earl of Winchilsea. They had three daughters: Dorothy (1724&#150;1742), who married George, earl of Euston; Juliana (1727&#150;1731); and Charlotte (1731&#150;1754).<br>
<br>Burlington owned four principal seats, three of which were acquired by his great-grandfather Richard, the first earl of Burlington and second earl of Cork, by marriage and purchase. He resided annually in three of these seats: his London town house, Burlington House in Piccadilly; his suburban seat on the Thames at Chiswick in Middlesex; and his country seat at Londesborough in the East Riding of Yorkshire. His Irish seat of Lismore Castle in co. Waterford, located on a vast estate numbering some 42,000 acres in the counties of Cork and Waterford, was the original family seat purchased by Richard, the first earl of Cork, from Sir Walter Ralegh in 1602. Although his Irish estates provided the major source of revenue for his architectural projects on his English estates, Burlington never visited Ireland.<h2>
<a name="Burlingtonandarchitecture"></a>Burlington and architecture</h2>Architecture was Burlington's outstanding area of contribution to the arts. Like his fellow aristocrat and contemporary Henry Herbert, ninth earl of Pembroke, Burlington was an &#145;Architect earl&#146;, who practised architecture not from economic necessity but as a passionate avocation. Surprisingly, he showed no interest in architecture during his grand tour of 1714&#150;15. While on it, he purchased a number of paintings and several drawings, made the acquaintance of William Kent, and indulged his passion for music: he returned to England with three Italian musicians. Like Lord Shaftesbury, who in his 1712 <span class="italic">Letter Concerning Art, or Science of Design</span> argued for a national architecture based upon classical precedents, Burlington aimed to place England within the mainstream of the classical tradition. His architecture&#151;with its didactic, lucid character&#151;was intended to demonstrate that England could create an architecture worthy of Rome. It was the centrepiece of an elaborately orchestrated campaign, with Burlington as the spokesman for the revival of an English classical style whose content he would dictate.<br>
<br>The traditional view of Burlington as a whig nobleman has been challenged. It has been argued that Burlington led a double life in service to the Jacobite cause, that his public life and architectural endeavours were a subterfuge for clandestine political activity in support of the exiled Stuarts, and that his grand tour and 1719 Italian sojourn served as opportunities for both cultural enrichment and political contacts with the exiled Stuart court. Burlington's reliance on the Stuart architect Inigo Jones as a cornerstone of his architecture is interpreted as a return not merely to Jonesian classicism but also to the early Stuart court, and as a reaffirmation of the divine right of kings  (Barnard and Clark). Jacobite sympathies could explain one important early architectural commission: the Westminster School dormitory, a building erected under the aegis of the Jacobite dean of Westminster Abbey, Francis Atterbury. However, Burlington's record in the House of Lords, and his conduct during the Jacobite risings of 1715 and 1745, give no hint of Jacobite sympathies, and it is extremely doubtful that his architecture is encoded with Jacobite symbolism or that his architectural patronage reflected Jacobite leanings. Until more than circumstantial evidence is produced, Burlington's putative crypto-Jacobite proclivities must remain in the realm of speculation.<br>
<br>Burlington's interest in architecture began during the four and a half years between his two Italian sojourns. About 1717 he was probably responsible for replacing James Gibbs with Colen Campbell as the architect responsible for remodelling Burlington House. This change reflects his evolving tastes from Gibbs's baroque classicism to Campbell's more rigorous classicism based on the architecture of Andrea Palladio. Under Campbell's tutelage at Burlington House and in the garden at Chiswick, Burlington learned the practical aspects of architecture. When he returned to Italy in 1719 he had made architecture his muse. In Venice and the Veneto he studied Palladio's architecture, recorded annotations of his impressions in a prepared copy of Palladio's <span class="italic">I quattro libri dell'architettura</span>, and purchased a large collection of Palladio's drawings of his reconstructions of the Roman baths. On returning to London in November 1719, Burlington began what became his lifelong architectural project: the transformation of his suburban estate at Chiswick, Middlesex.<br>
<br>Burlington was one of the most rigorous practitioners of the English classical architectural movement known as Palladianism. His architecture is didactic in character and is based upon the architecture of Inigo Jones, Palladio, and classical Rome, as represented in Palladio's drawings and in his treatise <span class="italic">I quattro libri dell'architettura</span>. Like Alberti, Burlington believed that the visual arts should provide moral instruction: for him classical architecture was a mute but eloquent language capable of conveying ideas and stimulating the imagination visually and intellectually.<br>
<br>With two notable exceptions Burlington's executed designs were for town or country houses and were executed for his fellow aristocrats and members of his family. At Chiswick he designed a suburban villa with its gardens and garden buildings. In the garden at Oatlands, Surrey, he designed a small villa (<i>c</i>.1725) for the seventh earl of Lincoln. He also designed: the huge Belvedere Tower (1725&#150;7) for Sir Robert Furnese at Waldershare Park, Kent; an octagonal temple (1743) at Woburn Farm, Surrey, for Sir Philip Southcote; a summer house (<i>in situ</i> by 1744) for Sir Robert Clifton at Clifton Hall, Nottinghamshire; and wings (<i>c</i>.1733) to Petersham Lodge, Surrey, for the first earl of Harrington. For his brother-in-law Charles, Lord Bruce, he designed a country house at Tottenham Park, Wiltshire, begun in 1721, with wings added about 1730&#150;38 and an octagonal building and banqueting house (1743) in the garden. Also for Lord Bruce he designed a <i>pied-&agrave;-terre</i> (1726&#150;7) at Round Coppice, Iver Heath, Buckinghamshire, located halfway between his Wiltshire country house and London, and interior alterations to Warwick House (1726&#150;7), his London residence.<br>
<br>Burlington also designed five town residences, of which, however, only three were built. Two were erected on land behind Burlington House that he had provided for a town house development in 1717: one for Lord Mountrath (<i>c</i>.1721) and the other for General Wade (1723). His third London town house was designed for the second duke of Richmond at Whitehall (1733&#150;4). The two unexecuted designs were a sumptuous London residence for the earl of Bath and an elegant house for Colonel James Gee (<i>c</i>.1722) at Bishop Burton in the East Riding of Yorkshire. He also designed five institutional buildings: York assembly rooms (1731&#150;2), Westminster School dormitory (1722&#150;30), Chichester Council House (1730), a hospital, and Sevenoaks School and almshouses (<i>c</i>.1724). Of these, only the assembly rooms and dormitory were erected.<br>
<br>Tottenham Park, Wiltshire&#151;Burlington's only country house&#151;was designed for his brother-in-law Charles, Lord Bruce, to replace the family seat destroyed by fire. Burlington's work at Tottenham Park spanned his entire architectural career, from 1721 to 1743. Henry Flitcroft, Burlington's personal draughtsman and architectural assistant, executed the drawings and was the site architect for at least the first building phase. Although Tottenham Park was Burlington's first and largest commission, he was in full command of his architectural ideas, and designed a house containing architectural elements that would become his architectural leitmotifs, and bearing allusions to the architecture of Jones and Palladio.<br>
<br>Begun in 1721, the front elevation of Tottenham Park was a slightly recessed three-bay central section crowned by a cupola, reminiscent of the north elevation of Amesbury Abbey, a nearby country house then believed to be by Inigo Jones (later attributed to John Webb) and owned by Burlington's uncle Lord Carleton. Its tall, two-storey corner towers punctuated by Serliana windows (often referred to as Palladian or Venetian windows) recall towers found in many of Palladio's villa designs in Burlington's drawing collection and similar towers on the villas Pisani and Thiene in Palladio's treatise. Large expanses of wall punctuated by single and double hung windows dominate the front elevation, giving it an emphatic rhythm. In addition to the house, Burlington designed two service buildings facing each other across the courtyard. Their fa&ccedil;ades are pared-down versions of Palladio's design for a small villa in Burlington's drawing collection, but without the recessed Serliana entrance portal and the robust aedicular windows flanking it.<br>
<br>In the early 1730s Burlington added elaborate wings to the front and garden elevations of Tottenham Park. On the garden elevation, corner towers matching those on the front elevation were added, but without Serliana windows. Defining the central section was an impressive free-standing, hexastyle, Ionic portico with an Italianate rusticated podium, derived from the podium of Burlington's villa at Chiswick. The wings consisted of a series of individual units, or small buildings, each with its own roof and fenestration. This, which Rudolf Wittkower terms the &#145;staccato principle&#146;  (Wittkower, 155), is a defining characteristic of the villa and Link Building at Chiswick. The elevations at the end of each wing have Serliana windows with Ionic capitals and a full entablature flanked by niches and Italianate rusticated quoins at the corners. In 1743 Burlington designed two garden buildings for Tottenham Park: a 70 foot Tuscan banqueting house and an octagonal garden building.<br>
<br>From 1720 Burlington transformed his suburban estate at Chiswick into a paradigm of classical architecture, with buildings exemplifying his architectural theory and practice. His first act was to complete the formal garden begun before his 1719 Italian trip. Every aspect of the garden was made subservient to its architecture, with each of the four garden buildings representing aspects of the architecture of Inigo Jones, Palladio, and classical Rome. At the end of the east <i>all&eacute;e</i> of the <i>patte d'oie</i> Burlington designed a diminutive rustic building whose front elevation was modelled on Jones's vineyard gate at Oatlands Palace, Surrey; buildings attributed to Campbell and Gibbs probably occupied the termini of the west and central <i>all&eacute;es</i>. Along the western boundary of the garden Burlington designed two buildings. Overlooking an apsidal pool within its own garden enclosure stood a (now demolished) banqueting house featuring a portico with a pair of Tuscan columns patterned after the Tuscan portico of Jones's St Paul's Church, Covent Garden. To the south, in its own garden enclosure, a tetrastyle Ionic temple was erected, a miniature version of two famous classical Roman buildings, the Pantheon and the Temple of Fortuna Virilis, both depicted in great detail in Palladio's treatise. The Ionic temple faces an orange-tree garden in the form of an amphitheatre. It consists of three concentric grass terraces where tubs of orange trees were placed during the summer months. From the circular pool at the centre of the orange-tree garden rises a stone obelisk on a pedestal. Burlington's fourth garden building (also now demolished), was an orangery located on the eastern boundary of the estate. There are two extant orangery designs: a domed and arcaded one, inspired by Palladio's thermal drawings, such as the Baths of Agrippa; and a seven-bay design with a gigantic, superimposed Corinthian portico in the manner of Palladio's Venetian church fa&ccedil;ades. As the domed and arcaded orangery design could function successfully as a greenhouse, it was probably this design that was erected.<br>
<br>Burlington now embarked on a more ambitious project by designing an extraordinarily idiosyncratic villa (1726&#150;9) facing the Thames. Erected in close proximity to an existing Jacobean house, the villa at Chiswick was designed without the amenities of a residence, which the earlier house provided. To confirm this symbiotic relationship, the villa and house were connected by the so-called Link Building and loggia in the early 1730s. Diminutive in size and jewel-like in the intensity of its architectural detailing, the villa is a paean to Jones, Palladio, and classical Rome. Its design was based upon Palladio's two famous suburban villas, La Rotonda at Vicenza and the Villa Foscari, near Venice. Palladio's standard Corinthian order in his treatise defines the exterior and interior. The free-standing hexastyle portico derives from Palladio's Villa Foscari, but was dramatically altered by the addition of a boldly rusticated podium. This rustication was inspired by that defining Palladio's Palazzo Thiene (Vicenza), which Burlington described as &#145;certainly the most beautifull modern building in the world&#146;. For the portico's capitals, Burlington deviated from Palladio's Corinthian order and selected the luxuriant Corinthian capitals from the Temple of Castor and Pollux in the Roman Forum, as illustrated in Palladio's treatise. The Serliana windows on the side and garden elevations and the thermal windows in the drum of the dome also derive from Palladio's Roman bath drawings.<br>
<br>The villa's innovative floor plan consists of simple geometric forms. Circles, semicircles, octagons, squares, and rectangles create a circular flow of space unlike the traditional linear spatial disposition of English domestic architecture. Burlington's novel treatment of such space derives from Palladio's Roman bath drawings and his Palazzo Thiene, in which similar spatial configurations were employed. The rooms on the piano nobile of the villa bristle with sumptuous architectural detailing, deriving in large part from Inigo Jones and to a much lesser degree from Palladio and classical Rome. There is nothing perfunctory or merely decorative about the interiors of the villa. The architectural detailing is a lexicon of classical architecture and is intended to be a standard for others to follow.<br>
<br>Burlington designed his villa as a temple to the arts. It functioned as a place for contemplation, entertainment, and the exhibition of art. Lord Hervey's scathing epigram based on the Roman poet Martial suggests that the villa did not function as a residence:<blockquote>
<div>Possess'd of one great hall for state,<br>
</div>
<div>Without a place to sleep or eat;<br>
</div>
<div>How well you build let flattery tell,<br>
</div>
<div>And all mankind how ill you dwell!<br>
</div> (Hervey, 1.574)</blockquote>The walls of the piano nobile were lined with Burlington's painting collection, interspersed with pieces from his sculpture collection and gilt furniture designed by William Kent. In such an ambience, Burlington could escape the formalities of the nearby Jacobean house to study, work on his architectural projects, and meet friends. The circular flow of space and the openness of the floor plan also made the piano nobile an ideal place for musical gatherings and entertainments, with the Serliana windows providing views of the formal garden and glimpses of Burlington's garden architecture.<br>
<br>In contrast to his suburban villa at Chiswick, the York assembly rooms (1731&#150;2) are the finest public statement of Burlington's architectural principles. With an unprecedented archaeological fidelity and reliance upon Palladio as his guide to classical Rome, Burlington created a building that was a precursor to neo-classicism. Austere on the exterior, clearly and sumptuously articulated on the interiors, the assembly rooms functioned as a place for the nobility and gentry of town and county to meet and entertain. From Palladio's drawings of the Roman baths came the severe five-bay arcaded front elevation of the assembly rooms (now demolished), as well as the apsidal and domed circular rooms surrounding the Great Assembly Room. With this room, Burlington attempted to rival the ancients, creating a modern version of Vitruvius's Egyptian Hall for dancing and other entertainments. Relying upon Palladio's reconstructions of the Egyptian Hall and the Roman basilica, he combined these to create a peripteral hall of forty-four Corinthian columns supporting a clerestory, and in accordance with Vitruvius and Palladio, an open loggia around the building at the clerestory level to view the activities in the Great Assembly Room.<br>
<br>Burlington's opinion and imprimatur on classical architecture were sought by his fellow peers. With Lord Pembroke, he oversaw Roger Morris's remodelling of Castle Hill, Devon (1729&#150;<i>c</i>.1740), for Lord Clinton; his advice was solicited about details such as the proportions of the hall entablature. For Sir Mark Pleydell at Coleshill, Berkshire (1744), the chimney-stacks at the angles of the house were rebuilt at the direction of Burlington and the earl of Leicester. With the assistance of William Kent, Burlington was instrumental in formulating the design of Holkham Hall (<i>c</i>.1734), the Norfolk country house of his friend the earl of Leicester. For the earl of Carlisle at Castle Howard, Yorkshire, Daniel Garrett designed and obtained Burlington's approval for the addition to Nicholas Hawksmoor's mausoleum of an elaborate staircase based on the one at the villa at Chiswick (1737&#150;42). In 1727, as part of his campaign to create an English classical architecture, Burlington paid for repairs to the Tuscan portico of Jones's St Paul's Church, Covent Garden, and in 1733 similarly for Jones's Barber&#150;Surgeons' Hall, London. To save Jones's Beaufort House gate from demolition, Burlington had it removed from Hans Sloane's Chelsea garden in 1733, and re-erected in his garden at Chiswick.<br>
<br>Through influence wielded behind the scenes, Burlington placed a contingent of his Palladian architectural prot&eacute;g&eacute;s in positions throughout the office of works. At the core of the English architectural establishment, the office of works was responsible for the care and the design of royal buildings. William Kent, whom Burlington promoted as a history painter and then architect and landscape architect, was appointed first master carpenter (1726), then master mason and deputy surveyor (1735). Henry Flitcroft held a number of positions, among them the clerkship of works at St James's, Whitehall, and Westminster (1726). Isaac Ware, architect, author, and translator, held several offices, among them clerk of the works at Windsor (1729) and Greenwich (1732&#150;3). Even such minor prot&eacute;g&eacute;s as Daniel Garrett and Stephen Wright were also given positions in the office of works.<h2>
<a name="Burlingtonsartcollections"></a>Burlington's art collections</h2>Burlington's art collections, although not large by the standards of the day, reflected not only his fondness for Italy but also his architectural interests. His painting collection, hung at Burlington House and in the villa at Chiswick, consisted mainly of works from the Italian baroque by such artists as Annibale Carracci, Domenichino, Pietro da Cortona, and Carlo Maratta. In addition, Burlington owned a representative sample of paintings by Dutch masters, including Rembrandt, as well as English family portraits. His small sculpture collection, located primarily at Chiswick, expressed his devotion to the classical tradition. Three full-length Roman statues, which according to Daniel Defoe were excavated from Hadrian's villa, stood in the garden along with sphinxes, a boar, and other statues modelled on classical prototypes by John Cheere, Giovanni Battista Guelfi, and Peter Scheemakers. John Michael Rysbrack's full-length statues of Palladio and Jones flanked the stairs to the piano nobile of the villa.<br>
<br>Burlington's most important collection was that of his architectural drawings. The collection consisted of the single largest corpus of Palladio's architectural drawings, including his reconstructions of the Roman baths and other Roman monuments. Jones's architectural drawings as well as his masque drawings, the drawings of John Webb, Jones's pupil, and a miscellaneous collection of sixteenth- and seventeenth-century drawings, mainly Italian, also formed part of the collection. Complementing this was a superb architectural library consisting of virtually all published editions of architectural treatises and texts, beginning with a mid-fifteenth-century incunabulum on vellum of Vitruvius's <span class="italic">Ten Books of Architecture</span>.<br>
<br>Burlington's drawing collection was not only indispensable to his own architecture: he also employed it as a means to disseminate his architectural principles. He made the collection available to his prot&eacute;g&eacute;s for study and inclusion in their architectural treatises and design books. In 1727 William Kent published a lavishly illustrated two-volume folio, <span class="italic">The Designs of Inigo Jones</span>, for which Burlington probably provided a subvention. The majority of the book's designs came from Burlington's drawing collection, including the ground-plans, elevations, and a section of the tribune of the villa at Chiswick. In 1731 Isaac Ware published the <span class="italic">Designs of Inigo Jones and Others</span>. Ware too was deeply indebted to Burlington, and informed his readers that the unexecuted designs in his text were at Burlington House. The majority of the plates in Ware's publication were devoted to designs by Inigo Jones, including those for the chimney-pieces erected in Burlington's villa; gate piers designed by Burlington for Chiswick were also included. Another publication supported by Burlington was Thomas Malie's publication <span class="italic">A New and Accurate Method of Delineating All the Parts of the Different Orders in Architecture</span> of 1737, a translation of Revesi Bruti. Burlington advocated the translation of Bruti's 1627 text, read Malie's manuscript, and encouraged him to publish it; consequently the text was dedicated to him. With the publication of a selection of Palladio's drawings of the Roman baths, Burlington wrapped himself in Palladio's mantle. In his treatise <span class="italic">I quattro libri dell'architettura</span> Palladio promised but failed to publish his drawings of the Roman baths; Burlington completed the master's work by publishing <span class="italic">Fabbriche antiche disegnate' da Andrea Palladio Vicentino</span>. Although 1730 is the stated publication date of the <span class="italic">Fabbriche</span>, it probably was not published until later in the decade. Of the fewer than 100 copies published, Burlington gave most to his friends and fellow <i>cognoscenti</i>. Burlington was also intimately involved with Isaac Ware's 1738 English translation of Palladio's influential treatise, published as <span class="italic">The Four Books of Architecture</span>. Ware dedicated his publication to Burlington, stating that he was given &#145;free access to your study, wherein many of the original drawings of Palladio, besides those which compose this work, are preserved&#146;. Burlington also revised and corrected Ware's translation and probably provided a subvention for its publication.<h2>
<a name="Burlingtonandmusic"></a>Burlington and music</h2>Music was Burlington's other great passion. Unlike his interest in architecture, which occupied him for approximately twenty-five years, his devotion to music was constant and continual. Throughout his life Burlington patronized composers, librettists, musicians, and the Italian opera, and held musical performances in his various residences. He undoubtedly acquired his love of music, and in particular the Italian opera, from his mother, Juliana, dowager countess of Burlington, who was its ardent champion. The libretto of <span class="italic">Antioco</span>, an Italian opera by Francesco Gasperini, was dedicated to her, and George Frideric Handel may have stayed at Burlington House during his first brief London sojourn of 1710&#150;11. On his return to London in 1712, Handel was given an apartment at Burlington House, where he wrote the opera <span class="italic">Amadigi di Gaula</span> (1715), the libretto of which is dedicated to Lord Burlington.<br>
<br>On his grand tour Burlington was never without music. He rented harpsichords and other instruments in Rome, Florence, Venice, and Paris for musical performances in his lodgings, and his grand tour account book records that he attended the opera in Rome and Florence. In Rome Burlington acquired the musical services of the string players Filippo Amadei and the brothers Pietro and Prospero Castrucci, who joined his entourage on its homeward journey through Italy and France. Supported and sponsored by Burlington, the Castrucci brothers settled in England, where they played at private musical gatherings in his residences and performed with opera orchestras in London and Dublin. Amadei, a cellist and composer, was also supported by Burlington and he too played for Burlington's musical gatherings and gave concerts, as well as composing for and playing in Handel's opera orchestra. Unlike the Castrucci brothers, Amadei eventually returned to Italy.<br>
<br>As his account books indicate Burlington was an ardent supporter of public musical events throughout his life, attending operas, masques and Handel's oratorios. His support of the Italian opera, whose performances dominated London's musical life during the first third of the eighteenth century, was unswerving. He was a member of the board of directors of the Royal Academy of Music from its inception in 1719 until its demise in 1728. The academy was formed to provide financial support for the Italian opera with the ultimate goal of making it self-supporting, and each director was required to subscribe &pound;200. Burlington pledged a sum far in excess, &pound;1000. In 1728, however, the academy collapsed, its finances in disarray and torn asunder by internal feuding between Handel and an Italian faction led by the composer Giovanni Bononcini, the librettist Paolo Rolli, and the castrato Senesino. From the dissolution of the academy came two rival opera companies: the Second Academy of Music (1729&#150;33), led by Handel, and the Opera of the Nobility (1733&#150;7), led by Rolli. Although Burlington was a founder member of the Opera of the Nobility, he did not let his support for the rival opera company prevent him from attending Handel's oratorios. Throughout the 1740s until his death in 1753, he purchased boxes for family and friends.<br>
<br>Both the opera and London's Italian community provided Burlington with an opportunity to immerse himself in the Italian language and culture he so admired. Furthermore, his association with them may well have played an important role in the development of his architectural ideas. During the early years of the century Burlington knew a number of Italian literary figures who were members or partook of the tenets of the Accademia dell'Arcadia, a literary society founded in 1690 in Rome. The Arcadians' aim was to purge Italian literature of its mannered excesses by returning to the literary exemplars of classical Rome and the Renaissance. Like the Arcadians, Burlington's architectural principles were founded upon a classical revival. He may well have discussed and refined his concepts of a classical revival with fellow Arcadians Pietro Grimani, the Venetian ambassador with whom he established a lifelong friendship, and Paolo Rolli, leader of London's Italian opera community, who dedicated his opera libretto <span class="italic">L'Astarto</span> to Burlington and taught his daughters Italian.<h2>
<a name="Burlingtonandliterature"></a>Burlington and literature</h2>Although primarily remembered for his architectural patronage, Burlington was one of the great literary patrons of his day. The wide spectrum of his literary interests is reflected in the variety of the thirty-nine publications dedicated to him. These range from art and architecture, literature, and music to sermons and scientific works. The most famous dedication is Alexander Pope's <span class="italic">Epistle to Burlington</span> (1731), which contains the classic statement of Burlington's architectural principles:<blockquote>
<div>You too proceed! making falling Arts your care,<br>
</div>
<div>Erect new wonders, and the old repair;<br>
</div>
<div>Jones and Palladio to themselves restore,<br>
</div>
<div>And be whate'er Vitruvius was before.<br>
</div>
</blockquote>Burlington's major support for writers came through his munificent patronage of publication subscriptions. Not only did he subscribe to ninety-seven separate publications, but in many instances he subscribed for more than one copy. The majority of his subscriptions were devoted to literature (twenty-eight) and history (twenty-six), with only nine to architecture, and the remainder to travel, music, science, and religion. He was an ardent supporter of contemporary poets, subscribing for six copies of Alexander Pope's translation of Homer's <span class="italic">Iliad</span> (1715&#150;20) and five copies of <span class="italic">The Odyssey</span> (1725), five copies of Matthew Prior's <span class="italic">Poems</span> (1718), five copies of James Thomson's <span class="italic">The Seasons</span> (1730), and fifty copies of John Gay's <span class="italic">Poems on Several Occasions</span> (1720). Another form of patronage that Burlington extended to writers and artists was residence at Burlington House. William Kent, described by Horace Walpole as &#145;a proper priest&#146; to Burlington's &#145;Apollo of Arts&#146;  (Walpole, 56) and Burlington's artistic confidant, was a permanent resident and the poet John Gay, whose <span class="italic">Epistle to Burlington</span> was part of his <span class="italic">Poems on Several Occasions</span>, was a guest for long periods during the 1720s.<br>
<br>Alexander Pope, however, was <i>primus inter pares</i> among the artists and writers Burlington supported. With Kent, Pope was a member of Burlington's inner circle and a friend and confidant of Lady Burlington. The earl's deep and abiding friendship with him went beyond mere patronage and was based on mutual artistic and aesthetic ideals. Burlington's library contained more of Pope's works than any other poet, including numerous editions as well as an early manuscript and a presentation copy of his <span class="italic">Epistle to Burlington</span>. Burlington shielded Pope and his family from anti-Catholic sentiment and provided legal assistance during the publication of Pope's at times scurrilous <span class="italic">Dunciad</span> (1728). In 1718 he offered Pope free tenancy of a plot of land behind Burlington House. Pleading that he could not afford to build a house on the plot, Pope declined the offer. At Pope's Thames-side villa, Burlington paid for the remodelling of the interiors and for the stone for the remodelling of the portico. Regarding his villa, the poet wrote to Burlington:<blockquote>that there should be nothing Durable in my building which I was not to owe to Chiswick. I am sure there will be nothing in it Beautiful besides, nor (I believe) in this nation, but what is owed to the Lord of Chiswick. (<span class="italic">Correspondence of Alexander Pope</span>, 3.341&#150;2)</blockquote>
<h2>
<a name="Deathandreputation"></a>Death and reputation</h2>Judging from his many portraits, Burlington was of average height and of slight build, small-boned, with delicate features, brown eyes, a high forehead, and a receding chin. So closely are his public and private personae intertwined that it is extremely difficult to separate the man from his deeds. His high-minded idealism made him the object of ridicule by his contemporaries. His architectural ideals were lampooned by William Hogarth in the satirical engraving <span class="italic">Masquerades and Operas</span> (also referred to as &#145;The bad taste of the town&#146;, 1723&#150;4, British Museum, London) and he was the butt of sarcastic remarks by lords Chesterfield and Hervey, and Sarah, duchess of Marlborough, among others. Walpole's comment is probably a fair assessment of Burlington's personality: &#145;Never was protection and great wealth more generously and more judiciously diffused than by this great person, who had every quality of a genius and artist, except envy&#146;  (Walpole, 53).<br>
<br>Burlington died on 3 December 1753 at Chiswick and was buried in the family vault at Londesborough on 15 December 1753. Charlotte, his youngest daughter and sole heir, married William Cavendish, fourth duke of Devonshire. She inherited the barony of Clifford, and the Boyle family's landholdings in Ireland, Yorkshire, and elsewhere passed to the Devonshire family. Burlington's personal belongings, papers, and art collection are at Chatsworth, the Devonshire family's country seat in Derbyshire. His drawing collection is divided between Chatsworth and the Royal Institute of British Architects, London, given in trust by the eighth duke of Devonshire in 1894.<br>
<br>During the nineteenth century Burlington's accomplishments were denigrated. The villa at Chiswick was variously attributed to Campbell and Kent, and at the turn of the century it was let as a mental institution. Burlington was excluded from James Fergusson's <span class="italic">History of the Modern Styles of Architecture</span> (1846) and Inigo Jones credited with designing Chiswick Villa. Reginald Blomfield in his <span class="italic">A History of Renaissance Architecture in England, 1500&#150;1800</span> (1897) claimed that Burlington paid Campbell, Kent, and others to design buildings to which he affixed his name. In the early twentieth century J. Alfred Gotch in his <span class="italic">The English Home from Charles I to George IV</span> simply dismissed Burlington, characterizing him as merely dabbling in design.<br>
<br>With the rise of architectural history after the First World War Burlington's reputation was slowly revived. The American historian Fiske Kimball led the way with a careful analysis of Burlington's autograph designs, followed by Rudolf Wittkower, who acknowledged Burlington's architectural accomplishments but diminished him in comparison with Kent. Not until Burlington's inclusion in Howard Colvin's <span class="italic">A Biographical Dictionary of English Architects, 1660&#150;1840</span> (1954) was his significant contribution to British architecture properly acknowledged.<br>
