<span class="headword">Cannan <span class="st"> [<em>married name </em>Slater]</span>,  May Wedderburn</span>  (1893&#150;1973), <span class="occ">writer</span>, was born at 34 St Giles, Oxford, on 14 October 1893, the second daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32277/', "Charles Cannan (1858&#150;1919)")</script>, Aristotelian scholar and publisher, and his wife, Mary Wedderburn (1857&#150;1943). Her twin, Frances Keir Cannan, died in infancy. Cannan's elder sister, Dorothea, married John Johnson, printer and assistant secretary to the delegates of Oxford University Press, and her younger sister <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/56904/', "Joanna Maxwell Cannan (1896&#150;1961)")</script>, became a novelist and children's writer. She grew up at Magdalen Gate House in Oxford's High Street and, like her sisters, was educated at the Wychwood School, Banbury Road, Oxford, run by Annie Batty and Margaret Lee.<br>
<br>Cannan's veneration of books began in her father's library, &#145;the room I loved best &hellip; At four I could read and had found my world&#146;  (Cannan, 5&#150;6). The Cannan sisters created their own family magazine, which they wrote in penny exercise books every morning and read as it was written to their cousin. In 1907 their anthology <span class="italic">The Tripled Crown</span> was published: &#145;My father started it&#146;, May asserted. &#145;On our complaining that there was no Anthology with all the things we wanted in it he said &#147;do one yourselves&#148;, so we did&#146;  (ibid., 34). Sir Arthur Quiller-Couch wrote an introductory poem. In 1908 she was sent with Dorothea to Downe House School in Kent. Although she passed the higher certificate examinations she was never happy there, and having caught pneumonia, she was allowed to return to Oxford and to Wychwood.<br>
<br>In the run-up to the First World War Cannan, like many women of her class and generation, took first aid and home nursing classes. She was a member of an Oxford Voluntary Aid Detachment (VAD) that had been approached by the War Office to set up a hospital in the event of mobilization. She was able to procure Magdalen College School for the hospital, but it was eventually decided that military not VAD hospitals would be used and that military nurses not amateur volunteers would run them. Cannan and her fellow volunteers were summarily dismissed. With her sisters she undertook voluntary war work at the Clarendon Press, which produced pamphlets and books for the government's propaganda bureau. Cannan herself was responsible for putting together Oxford University Press's general catalogue.<br>
<br>In 1915 Cannan spent four weeks in France running a railway canteen for soldiers, the experience providing inspiration for one of her finest poems, &#145;Rouen&#146;, which describes a day in the life of the busy port town. She records the incidentals of her experience from &#145;the coming of provisions&#146; and &#145;the little piles of Woodbines&#146; to &#145;the Drafts just out from England&#146; and &#145;the truck train full of wounded&#146;, and thus grounds the poem in the immediacy of the war. The repetitive question &#145;Can you recall&#146; combined with the insistent repletion of &#145;And&#146;, blend these concrete details within a lyrical memory of &#145;our Adventure&#146;. Her first volume of poetry, <span class="italic">In War Time</span>, was published in 1917 by Basil Blackwell. In August 1918 Cannan went to work for the bureau of central intelligence, a branch of MI5 in Paris, and she was there when the armistice was declared in November. Her poem &#145;The Armistice: in an Office in Paris&#146;, which ends with the assertion &#145;peace could not give back her Dead&#146;, is a moving encapsulation of the conflicting emotions of women for whom the celebrations had come too late.<br>
<br>In December 1918 Cannan was officially engaged to her childhood friend Major Bevil Quiller-Couch MC, RFA (1890&#150;1919), son of Arthur Quiller-Couch (Q), professor of English literature at Cambridge and editor of the <span class="italic">Oxford Book of English Verse</span>. Bevil Quiller-Couch survived the fighting at Mons, Ypres, the Ancre, and elsewhere, but he died in the influenza pandemic on 6 February 1919. Cannan's grief was poured into some of the most poignant poems of the war, including &#145;Young Adventure&#146; and &#145;When the Vision Dies&#146;, which Vera Brittain quoted as the epigraph and title of chapter 6 of <span class="italic">Testament of Youth</span> (1933). Her second poetry collection, <span class="italic">The Splendid Days</span>, dedicated to Bevil, was published in 1919. Cannan typed out every letter Bevil wrote to her and to his parents, as well as letters from his fellow officers and her own copy of the official war diaries chronicling his service  (Fyfe, vii). In the aftermath of Bevil's death she was sustained by her work on the <span class="italic">Oxford Magazine</span> and the friendship of her former schoolmate and fellow VAD volunteer Carola Oman, whose volume of poems <span class="italic">The Menin Road</span> Cannan helped to get published.<br>
<br>In the early 1920s Cannan worked as a secretary at King's College, London, and as an assistant librarian at the Athenaeum. The publication of her third volume of poetry, <span class="italic">The House of Hope</span> (1923), inspired a letter from an admirer&#151;Percival James Slater (1892&#150;1967)&#151;who had written to her previously about <span class="italic">The Splendid Days</span>. Slater had been wounded in the war, joined the Royal Flying Corps, and served in captive balloons, for which he was awarded the DFC. Although they had met only five times the couple were married on 26 July 1924 at the parish church of St George, Campden Hill, London. They had one son, James Cannan Slater. <span class="italic">The Lonely Generation</span>, her fictionalized memoir, appeared in 1934. She then gave up writing for publication, partly owing to her husband's reaction to the book, and committed herself to the animals and land of the Staffordshire farm they shared for forty years. &#145;Long years after, he told me he was sorry he had had a &#147;thing about it&#148; and about my writing&#151;he could not tell why&#151;and I said it did not matter, which had become nearly true&#146;  (Fyfe, 174).<br>
<br>May Wedderburn Cannan suffered a heart attack and died in her sleep at her home, St Margaret's Cottage, 15 The Moors, Pangbourne, Berkshire, on 11 December 1973. Her funeral was held at St Mary's, Whitchurch-on-Thames.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">Grey Ghosts and Voices</span>, Cannan's autobiography (left at her death in manuscript), was published posthumously in 1976, and is both an evocative portrait of her Oxford childhood and a moving account of her experience of war and its aftermath. She regarded it as &#145;a salute to my generation&#146;  (Cannan, 152). Unlike Vera Brittain, May Cannan did not subscribe to the idea that the First World War was a futile waste of a generation: &#145;I had admired much of Sassoon's verse but I was not coming home with him. Someone must go on writing for those who were still convinced of the right of the cause for which they had taken up arms&#146;  (ibid., 113). &#145;Rouen&#146; is one of the most anthologized First World War poems by a woman. Philip Larkin, who found it &#145;enchanting&#146;, chose it for his <span class="italic">Oxford Book of Twentieth Century English Verse</span> (1973), and Jon Stallworthy likewise selected it for successive editions of the <span class="italic">Norton Anthology of Poetry</span> and <span class="italic">The Oxford Book of War Poetry</span>. <span class="italic">The Tears of War: the Love Story of a Young Poet and a War Hero</span>, edited by Charlotte Fyfe, Cannan's great-niece, which brings together May Cannan's poetry and her correspondence with Bevil Quiller-Couch, was published in 2000.<br>
