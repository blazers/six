<span class="headword">Kelsall,  Charles</span>  (1782&#150;1857), <span class="occ">traveller and architect</span>, was baptized on 1 August 1782 at Greenwich, Kent, the son of Thomas Kelsall, a member of the council of the East India Company and his wife, Sarah. He was educated at Eton College and Trinity College, Cambridge, where he became a fellow-commoner in 1800. He left in 1803 without taking a degree and spent three years in a Wiltshire militia regiment. In subsequently adopting the life of a travelling scholar, he was doubtless influenced by the academic study of Greece being undertaken about 1800 by a remarkable group of Cambridge scholars. He first visited Sicily while he was still an undergraduate, and it was on a second visit to the island in 1808&#150;9 that he wrote the first of his many privately published books, a translation of Cicero's <span class="italic">The Last Two Pleadings &hellip; Against Caius Verres</span> (1812). He unexpectedly appended to this a &#145;Post script containing remarks on the state of modern Sicily&#146; in which his sympathy with contemporary trends in secular rationalist thought led him to argue that Sicily was in need of drastic modernization along liberal and democratic lines.<br>
<br>Kelsall adopted the cause of Greek independence in <span class="italic">A Letter from Athens Addressed to a Friend in England</span>, a lengthy poem published in 1812, the same year as <span class="italic">Childe Harold</span> by Lord Byron. In a footnote he held up the Greek Doric style as the model for a reformed modern architecture. In idealist language derived from J. J. Winckelmann, he praised Doric for its permanence and longevity, recording &#145;the rapid progress of the present age to the attainment of true taste in architecture&#146;. He admired recent Greek revival buildings in St Petersburg, Berlin, Trieste, London, and Cambridge, but reserved his greatest praise for Paris, where &#145;grecian architecture triumphs&#146; and was consequently &#145;a better school for young architects than either Rome or Venice&#146;.<br>
<br>Kelsall designed buildings in various styles, including Grecian, of which he published engravings by Henry Moses and other artists in <span class="italic">Phantasm of an University</span> (1814), a book which has something in common with Claude-Nicolas Ledoux's <span class="italic">L'architecture consid&eacute;r&eacute;e sous le rapport de l'art, des m&#339;urs, et de la l&eacute;gislation</span> (1804), with the proposals of Thomas Jefferson for the University of Virginia, and with the founding of London University. Kelsall argued for the fundamental reform, academically and architecturally, of Oxford and Cambridge, urging them to &#145;Take at last measures to keep peace with the improvements made in the present age, in all the departments of science and art.&#146; Denying that &#145;universal science is centred in mathematics, in the classics&#146;, he proposed as fields of study civil policy and languages, fine arts, agriculture and manufactures, natural philosophy, moral philosophy, and mathematics. The course would be followed by a world tour. The university buildings were themselves instructive, incorporating all the &#145;orders to be seen in the ruins of Greece and Italy&#146; as well as English medieval styles.<br>
<br>In his <span class="italic">Classical Excursion from Rome to Arpino</span> (1820) Kelsall published designs for a monument to Cicero in the Amalthea at Arpino. In 1841 he acquired a villa called Knightons in Hythe, Hampshire, which he renamed the Villa Amalthea, setting up busts of poets and scholars in the garden. His <span class="italic">Remarks Touching Geography Especially that of the British Isles</span> (1822) proposed the introduction of Napoleonic departments, while his <span class="italic">Horae viaticae</span> (1836) included a novel about a radical reforming pope. Kelsall also published <span class="italic">Esquisse de mes travaux, de mes voyages, et de mes opinions</span> (1830). On his death at Nice on 3 January 1857 he left his books and manuscripts to Morden College, Blackheath, London, where a building was designed to house them by Philip Hardwick.<br>
