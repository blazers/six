<span class="headword">Wheatly,  Charles</span>  (1686&#150;1742), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and liturgical scholar</span>, the son of John Wheatly, a gentleman of London, and his wife, a descendant of Sir Thomas White, founder of St John's College, Oxford, was born on 6 February 1686 in Paternoster Row, London. He was sent to Merchant Taylors' School in 1699 and in 1705 matriculated at St John's College, Oxford, where he was elected a fellow in 1707, graduating BA in 1710 and proceeding MA in 1713. He incorporated at Cambridge in 1728. His tutor was James Knight (1672&#150;1735), later vicar of St Sepulchre's in London: Wheatly maintained that he continued &#145;&hellip; his <i>pupil</i> to his dying-day.&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 1801, 110). He resigned his fellowship in 1716, on his marriage, on 9 August that year, to Mary (<i>c</i>.1676&#150;1724), daughter of William Findall of the Clarendon Press, and after her death in 1724 he married Mary, daughter of Daniel Fogg, rector of All Hallows Staining; she survived him. After holding lecturerships in London at St Mildred Poultry and St Swithin with St Mary Bothaw, Wheatly was instituted in 1726 to the combined benefices of Brent and Furneux Pelham in Hertfordshire, where he built a new vicarage house and secured augmentation for the livings from Queen Anne's Bounty.<br>
<br>Arguably the most influential liturgical scholar of his generation, Wheatly is best remembered for <span class="italic">The Church of England Man's Companion, or, A Rational Illustration of &hellip; the Book of Common Prayer</span> (1710; 8th edn, 1759; many other edns). This epitomized earlier studies by Hamon L'Estrange, Anthony Sparrow, Thomas Comber, and William Nicholls, and remained the standard work on its subject for over 100 years. Markedly high-church in emphasis, it drew on deep patristic learning to uphold the Church of England's claims to a spiritual commission independent of any reliance upon the State; to assert the indispensable nature of the apostolic succession in the ministry; and to justify the use of external ceremonies in the conduct of public worship. Much of its teaching, particularly in relation to eucharistic theology, was identical to that of &#145;usager&#146; nonjurors. However, Wheatly rejected Jacobitism, arguing in the <span class="italic">Rational Illustration</span> and elsewhere in favour of allegiance to the <i>de facto</i> powers.<br>
<br>Wheatly was an active writer and controversialist, who maintained a regular correspondence with both conforming high-churchmen, such as Daniel Waterland, and nonjurors like Thomas Brett and Richard Rawlinson. His Moyer lectures for 1733&#150;4 (published in 1738) defended the Nicene and Athanasian creeds as indispensable statements of orthodox Christian belief. A notable opponent of the spread of Methodism, he used an important opportunity at St Paul's in October 1739 to distinguish between the calm spirit of real devotion and &#145;&hellip; those high Raptures and <i>Feelings</i> of Joy &hellip; to &hellip; which some modern Enthusiasts pretend.&#146;  (Wheatly, <span class="italic">Fifty Sermons</span>, 1.217). He died of dropsy and asthma on 13 May 1742 at Furneux Pelham, and was buried in the parish church there, where an inscription was placed in his memory. He left several of his books to St John's College, including important annotated editions of R. Hooker's <span class="italic">Ecclesiastical Polity</span> and the <span class="roman">Book of Common Prayer</span>. A collection entitled <span class="italic">Fifty Sermons on Several Subjects and Occasions</span>, edited by Wheatly's friend John Berriman, with a short biographical note, was published in three volumes in 1746 and reprinted in 1753.<br>
