<span class="headword">Francis, Sir  Richard Trevor Langford</span>  (1934&#150;1992), <span class="occ">broadcasting executive and public servant</span>, was born at the Imperial Nursing Home, Harrogate, Yorkshire, on 10 March 1934, the son of Eric Roland Francis (1902&#150;1987), production engineer, and his wife, Esther Joy Todd (1906&#150;1999). He was educated at Malsis Hall, Crosshills, Yorkshire (1944&#150;8), and Uppingham School (1948&#150;53) before going to University College, Oxford, on an open scholarship to read natural sciences. In his second year, he switched from chemistry to politics, philosophy, and economics. At Oxford he acted with the Oxford Experimental Theatre and the Oxford University Dramatic Society. He graduated with a third-class degree in 1956. After two years' national service, commissioned in the Royal Artillery, he entered the BBC as a general trainee&#151;a highly competitive entry system which was one of the most prized undergraduate career entry schemes.<br>
<br>After developing one of the BBC's first successful afternoon programmes, <span class="italic">Table Talk</span>, Francis graduated to <span class="italic">Panorama</span>, working with Britain's first-rank television reporters such as Richard Dimbleby, Ludovic Kennedy, and Robin Day. Apart from his command of the studio, he made some elegant films on subjects as diverse as Albert Schweitzer in Lambarene and the struggle for black emancipation in the southern states of America. Typically, matching his physical appearance (he could have been taken for a rugby international) he played a sturdy role in internal debates about <span class="italic">Panorama</span>&#151;then the BBC's leading television current affairs programme, but under threat from heavy competition from ITV. In a cogently argued memorandum to Paul Fox, the BBC's head of public affairs broadcasting, he said:<blockquote>
<span class="roman">Panorama</span> is losing its status &hellip; faced with increasing competition, we are no longer indispensable. The concept of the studio as the House of Richard Dimbleby has become dull and predictable. We must get more contracted experts as reporters in the fields of Defence, the Communist Block, Science. (BBC WAC, 732/1, 191/9, 11 Aug 1964)</blockquote>This was the beginning of a long, almost theological debate about the role and structure of <span class="italic">Panorama</span> in the 1960s.<br>
<br>Francis became assistant editor of the BBC's late evening programme <span class="italic">24 Hours</span> in 1966, and ran the BBC's general election coverage in 1970 (and the coverage of the US presidential election in 1972). &#145;General Elections are to television as wars are to the aircraft industry&#151;they force development and invention&#146;, he said  (<span class="italic">The Independent</span>, 29 June 1992). The 1970 election programme was the first to use computer online processing. This complex, leading-edge studio responsibility was built on Francis's experience as the producer of global live coverage of the extraordinary American Apollo space programme (including the landing on the moon in July 1969). He was known to lapse frequently into NASA space communication language&#151;and once was presented with 400 feet of negative film when he responded to a question about its possible inclusion with the word &#145;negative&#146; instead of &#145;no&#146;.<br>
<br>After a period as assistant head of BBC current affairs Francis became in 1973 BBC controller, Northern Ireland. This followed his production in 1971 of a special programme on Northern Ireland called <span class="italic">The Question of Ulster</span> which, he said, was &#145;designed to be a long, cool programme of talk, not action&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Independent</span>, 29 June 1992)&#151;giving considered background and context to the daily diet of news film of the troubles which had broken out in August 1969. The then home secretary, Reginald Maudling, urged the BBC not to transmit. The governors discussed the issue and decided to go ahead with the broadcast on 5 January 1972. Over two-thirds of the population of Ulster watched the programme, chaired by Lord Devlin. The dire warnings that had preceded the programme proved unfounded. As controller, Northern Ireland, Francis was courageous and clear, and &#145;established clear and effective ground rules&#146;  (Hussey). His five years covered a period of great trouble in Northern Ireland, and he won the admiration of his staff and the BBC management for his carefulness and calmness when faced with many conflicting political and social pressures. He deployed his Yorkshire determination in defence of high editorial standards. In a speech at Chatham House in February 1977 he said:<blockquote>The experience of broadcasting in Northern Ireland, for all the threats to society and to human life, suggests that the practice of free speech within a well tested framework of responsibility is the best&#151;if not the easiest&#151;way to cover extraordinary circumstances. I believe we have a contribution to make to the maintenance of democracy both by providing a forum where harsh differences of opinion can be aired, and by reporting and courageously investigating the unpalatable truths which underlie the problems in our midst. I am sure that if and when the communities of Northern Ireland reconcile their conflicts, it will be by understanding them rather than by ignoring them. (Francis, &#145;Broadcasting&#146;)</blockquote>In 1977 Francis gained a seat on the BBC board of management, as director of news and current affairs. He guided a disparate group of news and current affairs producers, many of whom saw his role as a touch bureaucratic (as did some other members of the board). He construed his role as one of trying to set common standards, and as being a spokesman for policy. A speech at the Royal Television Society in 1981 captured the essence of his views:<blockquote>Any really democratic society is vulnerable to its own openness. That is, perhaps, the paradox with which all of us, as citizens and broadcasters, have to grapple. There are those who, for the best and most honourable of motives, believe that this very openness contains the seeds of democracy's self destruction. I cannot believe that our democracy is so fragile a thing that it has neither the will nor the strength to identify and withstand the pressures upon it. (Francis, &#145;Television&#146;)</blockquote>During the Falklands War, he incurred the displeasure of Margaret Thatcher for saying, in a speech in Spain (about broadcasters' responsibilities in covering the conflict), that &#145;the widow of Portsmouth is no different from the widow of Buenos Aires&#146;&#151;stressing the need for impartiality to underpin a reputation for telling the truth  (Francis, address). The chairman of the BBC, Marmaduke Hussey, later said that &#145;Dick Francis set standards for BBC journalists while arguing a persuasive case for editorial freedom. His reward was the respect of both journalists and politicians&#151;chafing communities who rarely applaud the same man&#146;  (Hussey).<br>
<br>Francis's career towards what some saw as the possible prize of the BBC's director-generalship took a step further when he became managing director, radio, in 1982. To some he was something of a technocrat, with more of a stubborn determination than a nimble, lightfooted wit. But he saw the BBC as a cause, and when he gave his loyalty to a task, he didn't let go. As managing director, radio, he embraced local radio and its separate management structure. (He had already shown his enthusiasm in Northern Ireland, by establishing Radio Ulster.) He also fought for the redevelopment of the Langham Hotel&#151;a prime property owned by the BBC for many years and sold by the governors (to the surprise of many staff) as part of a deal to buy the White City racetrack site. He involved many members of staff in helping to develop the architect Norman Foster's plans for the Langham Hotel. His deputy, Charles McLelland, said:<blockquote>More than anything else, this gave everybody working in Radio, the feeling that they had a boss who cared not just for the future of Radio, but for them as individuals. For the first time in many years they felt they were part of a dynamic future. (<span class="italic">The Guardian</span>, 29 June 1992)</blockquote>Francis's determination in the interests of local radio and the Langham redevelopment led him to be seen as something of a problem on the BBC board of management. He had the capacity to be relentless in his point of view. He was engineered out of the BBC, to the dismay of many, in 1986. (His departure set a blueprint for further sudden removals from high office a year or so later.) The process upset him badly. Like some others on the board of management, he had not realized that the BBC was beginning to be in the grip of forces which almost resented the public service successes of its past, and which needed to associate that past with managerial failure to justify its new accountancy-led, market-orientated thinking.<br>
<br>Within a very short period of his departure from the BBC Francis became director-general of the British Council. He had bounced on the trampoline and emerged higher than the point from which he fell. In his five years as director-general, he managed to extend the council's programme by 20 per cent in real terms, and to increase its grant from the government each year. He introduced new planning mechanisms and efficiency savings, being &#145;convinced that the best way to protect the Council's independent but complementary role [to the Foreign Office] and its traditional values was to prove its worth by business criteria&#146;  (Orr, <span class="italic">The Times</span>, 3 July 1992). He travelled frequently&#151;as he had done with the BBC, where his reputation for enjoying jet travel and the comforts of the VIP lounge was legendary. Some British Council staff thought that he spent too much time away from base, but he believed in walking his global ship (in his interests in <span class="italic">Who's Who</span> he listed &#145;off-shore sailing and listening to music six miles high&#146;. Others admired his stamina and were energized by the excitement with which he reported on local achievements. He wanted to expand the council's activities in eastern Europe and, at home, he successfully relocated half the council's staff to new premises in Manchester&#151;a demanding managerial challenge. He was a doughty promoter of the English language and wanted to see the best of British art in all its forms exhibited abroad. The British Council was well served by him, and his own artistic enthusiasms for good music, opera, and photography underpinned what was to be his last professional achievement. &#145;His representation of the Council, at home and abroad, has lifted its standing throughout the world&#146;, said Marmaduke Hussey in his appreciation in <span class="italic">The Times</span>.<br>
<br>Francis was professionally self-assertive, and was well-versed in the art of presentation. He was implacable in his consistency for what he believed to be right. He was, above all, a public servant. His career began at a time when Britain strongly embraced the concept of the public services. It ended as that world, which was assaulted by Prime Minister Thatcher, had begun to crumble. In many ways, he was an intrepid figure, with great enthusiasms masking an inner shyness. His was a life of achievement in a competitive environment. He took risks, and could keep calm under the greatest pressure&#151;a characteristic that made him one of Britain's top (and pioneering) live studio television directors, and that served him well when he was responsible for all global television coverage outside the USA of the Apollo space programme which landed man on the moon. Equally, he brought his cool head to technically complex general election television programmes, as well as to the complexities of Northern Ireland as the BBC controller during a critical and dangerous period for journalists and staff. He conducted his hobby of offshore sailing with the energy (and occasional insouciance to danger) that marked his professional career. Privately, he was a kind and generous friend&#151;with little of the pomposity that some professional observers felt was characteristic.<br>
<br>Francis was married twice: first, on 22 December 1958, to Beate Ella Paula Stientje Ohlhagen (<i>b</i>. 1931), air hostess, daughter of Karl Wilhelm Ohlhagen, from whom he was divorced in 1973; and second, on 1 October 1974, to Elizabeth Penelope Anne Fairfax-Crone (<i>b</i>. 1945), a television researcher and producer, daughter of Fairfax Chinnery Fairfax-Crone. There were two sons by each marriage.<br>
<br>Francis was at various times a member of the &#145;D&#146; Notice Committee and of the Press Complaints Commission, the Media Law Group, the UK&#150;Japan 2000 Group, and the Franco-British Council; a council member of the Royal College of Art and of Voluntary Service Overseas; a governor of Westminster College; a trustee of the Charities Aid Foundation; a vice-president of the Royal Institute of Public Administration; and a deputy chairman of Visnews and of the International Press Institute. He was elected a companion of the British Institute of Management in 1984, honorary president of the Radio Academy in 1986, and a fellow of the Royal Society of Arts in 1988. He was made KCMG in 1989 and a fellow of Kings College, London, in 1991. He died, following a heart attack, at Queen Mary's University Hospital, Roehampton, on 26 June 1992, and was buried in Queen's Road cemetery, Richmond, on 3 July. His memorial service was held in St Paul's Cathedral on 17 November 1992 under the auspices of the two organizations he had served so well. It was attended by over a thousand people, and the BBC Symphony Orchestra played Elgar's &#145;Nimrod&#146; and Richard Strauss's <span class="italic">Also sprach Zarathustra</span> (which he had used for his Apollo space programmes). The music linked this quintessential Englishman with the creative inventiveness and expansive style that had marked his life.<br>
