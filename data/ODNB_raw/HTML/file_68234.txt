<span class="headword">Wilmot <span class="st"> [<em>alias </em>Quartermain]</span>,  William</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1720), <span class="occ">Roman Catholic priest</span>, was born in Yorkshire and entered the English College at Valladolid in 1670 under the name Quartermain. In view of his already mature age he was ordained priest after a shortened course of studies, and returned to England on 23 February 1676. Titus Oates, who was expelled from that college the following year after only four months there (apparently taking with him part of the college register covering the previous few years), identified Quartermain as Wilmot in his <span class="italic">Exact narrative of the horrible plot and conspiracy of the popish party against the life of his sacred majesty, the government, and the protestant religion</span>. Most later references follow Oates in this, and it could be argued that the Gulielmus Quaterman in the college register was nothing more than an alias adopted by Wilmot on arrival at Valladolid.<br>
<br>During 1685&#150;6, if not for longer, Wilmot acted as secretary to Bishop John Leyburn, the vicar apostolic appointed by Rome for England following the succession of the Catholic James II to the English throne in February 1685. In that capacity he probably lived with Leyburn in Lincoln's Inn Fields and presumably accompanied him to the ceremonies in the new royal chapel in Whitehall on Christmas day 1686, vividly described by John Evelyn. By 1687 Wilmot was sufficiently well known for Oates to imagine that he might become bishop of Carlisle in any Catholic restoration. Despite his reputation, he does not seem ever to have been an elected member of the chapter, but he did attend the important meeting on 9 July 1694 as proxy for George Barrett, the archdeacon of Shropshire.<br>
<br>Kirk mentions a John Wilmot, secretary to Bishop Leyburn, who wrote a pamphlet in answer to William Sherlock's <span class="italic">Discourse Concerning the Nature, Unity and Community of the Catholick Church</span>; translated by William Darrell it was published at St Omer in 1697 as <span class="italic">Controversial Discourses Relating to the Church</span>, under the initials B. D. Given the link with Leyburn and that no later writers have identified another Wilmot contemporary with William, it may be that William Wilmot (alias Quartermain) was its author.<br>
<br>In later life Wilmot lived at Holywell, Flintshire. Kirk states that he was already there by 1694, but according to the 1718 deposition of Thomas Parry, innkeeper of the Cross Keys, he came to live there only in 1716, the inn being a front for the Catholic secular chapel in Holywell, just as the Star fronted the Jesuit mission there. The national scare that followed the abortive Jacobite rebellion of 1715 led to an attack on both chapels in the course of 30 June 1718 by a party of dragoons sent from Preston under the direction of the renegade priest Richard Hitchmough. Although the Jesuits managed to save most of their effects, at the secular chapel furniture and other items were seized under the terms of the warrant. Wilmot himself was arrested and charged before the local JP with being a popish priest after identification on oath by Hitchmough. He was bailed soon afterwards and died at Holywell on 2 August 1720.<br>
