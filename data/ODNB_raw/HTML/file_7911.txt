<span class="headword">Douglas, Lady  Margaret</span>, countess of Lennox  (1515&#150;1578), <span class="occ">noblewoman</span>, only child of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7866/', "Archibald Douglas, sixth earl of Angus (c.1489&#150;1557)")</script>, and his second wife, Margaret Tudor [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18052/', "Margaret (1489&#150;1541)")</script>], daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/12954/', "Henry VII of England")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8635/', "Elizabeth of York")</script>, was born on 8 October 1515 at Harbottle Castle in Northumberland.<h2>
<a name="Earlyyears"></a>Early years</h2>Margaret's mother's first husband had been James IV, king of Scots, and her childhood was complicated by her parents' matrimonial adventures and the bitter power struggles in which they engaged during the minority of her half-brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/14591/', "James V")</script>. Having lost the regency of Scotland by her hasty second marriage, Queen Margaret had been fleeing south to the court of her brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/12955/', "Henry VIII")</script>, when she was seized with labour pains and forced to seek shelter in the castle of Thomas, second Lord Dacre, at Harbottle. A hastily arranged baptism was held the day after her daughter's birth, &#145;with such provisions as couthe or mought be had in this baron and wyld country&#146;  (Ellis, 265&#150;7), so Lord Dacre told Henry VIII. The queen dowager was ill for a long time after the birth, but the following spring she took Margaret to the English court, and the baby stayed in the royal nurseries at Greenwich Palace until in June 1517 Henry VIII sent mother and daughter back to Scotland.<br>
<br>Margaret's parents were reunited, but their domestic harmony was brief. When she was three, her mother discovered that Angus was keeping a mistress; a violent quarrel erupted and the earl, conscious of his daughter's dynastic significance, snatched her from her mother's arms and took her first to his fortress of Tantallon in Haddingtonshire, probably to France, then to England, and finally back to Scotland again. Ignoring his wife's attempts to marry her to James IV's illegitimate son, James Stewart, fourteenth earl of Moray, Angus kept custody of the child and when he was driven out of Scotland in 1528, found shelter for her at Norham Castle and then at Berwick, with Thomas Strangeways, comptroller of the household of Cardinal Wolsey, who was her godfather. After Wolsey's death in November 1530, Margaret's aunt Mary, duchess of Suffolk and dowager queen of France, came to the rescue and invited her to London. Henry VIII then decreed that she should live at Beaulieu, in the household of his daughter Mary. With only four months between them in age, the two girls became lifelong friends, despite the fact that in 1536 Henry removed both his daughters from the succession on the grounds of their alleged illegitimacy, and for a time treated his niece as heiress presumptive.<br>
<br>Margaret was a great favourite at court. The French ambassador, Louis de Perreau, noted in 1534 that she was both &#145;beautiful and highly esteemed&#146;  (<span class="italic">LP Henry VIII</span>, 7, appx 13). Apart from a Holbein miniature in the Royal Collection speculatively reidentified as Lady Margaret, the surviving portraits show her in later life. In these her hair is covered and so its colour is not shown, but she had heavy-lidded, deep-set eyes, a long nose, broad jaw, and fairly thin lips. Lively and attractive, she was somehow able to charm reformers and Catholics alike. Sent to be lady-in-waiting to Anne Boleyn, she got on surprisingly well with the new queen, and fell in love with Anne's uncle, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/70793/', "Thomas Howard")</script>. The two became secretly engaged but Henry VIII was furious when he found out, declaring that Howard was aiming at the throne by trying to capture a royal bride. Henry sent him to the Tower and imprisoned Margaret there too, until she fell ill with a recurring fever. He then allowed her to live at the abbey of Sion, near Isleworth, under the supervision of the abbess, who was soon complaining about the large number of servants she kept and her constant stream of visitors. She was finally released on 29 October 1537. Howard died in the Tower two days later.<br>
<br>When Henry VIII's son, Edward, was born, the king convinced himself that Margaret, like his daughters, was illegitimate. Thus rendered harmless, she was restored to favour, becoming successively first lady of honour to Anne of Cleves and Katherine Howard. However, when she fell in love with Katherine's brother Charles, Henry sent her back to Sion and then to Kenninghall, in Norfolk, where Thomas Cranmer reproved her for &#145;over much lightness&#146;, warning her to &#145;beware the third time&#146;  (Fraser, <span class="italic">Lennox</span>, 1.427). She remained at Sion until Henry VIII decided to use her father again to promote his own interests in Scotland and allowed her to return to court. On 10 July 1543 she was a bridesmaid at his wedding to Katherine Parr and the following year Henry arranged her own marriage.<h2>
<a name="CountessofLennox"></a>Countess of Lennox</h2>On 6 July 1544, in St James's Palace, London, Margaret married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26497/', "Matthew Stewart, thirteenth or fourth earl of Lennox (1516&#150;1571)")</script>, one of Scotland's leading noblemen. A descendant of James I of Scotland, he had been brought up in France by an uncle, and was well educated and handsome, &#145;a strong man, of personage well shaped &hellip; fair and pleasant faced, with a good and manly countenance&#146;  (<span class="italic">Historie and Cronicles</span>, 2.16&#150;18). He had been lured back to Scotland with promises that Mary of Guise might marry him, but he soon realized that she simply wanted to use him as a counterpoise to his hereditary enemy, James Hamilton, second earl of Arran. Disillusioned, he entered into negotiations with the pro-English earl of Angus, asking for Margaret as his bride in return for his future support of Henry VIII. On his wedding day he became a naturalized Englishman, receiving from the king grants of property in London and Yorkshire.<br>
<br>Margaret and her husband were deeply in love with each other, but Lennox had to leave London almost at once to attempt to advance Henry's policies in Scotland and was forfeited by the Scottish parliament on 1 October 1545 as a result. His wife remained in the south, first in the household of Queen Katherine and then in her own residence of Stepney Palace, where she gave birth to a son, Henry, Lord Darnley, named after the king. Leaving the baby at Stepney, she moved to Temple Newsam, one of Lennox's properties in Yorkshire, to be closer to Scotland. Her first child died on 28 November 1545 and was buried in St Dunstan's Church, Stepney, but just over a week later she gave birth to another son, a second <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26473/', "Henry Stewart, Lord Darnley")</script>.<br>
<br>Shortly before Henry VIII's death in 1547 Margaret quarrelled bitterly with him over her attachment to the Roman Catholic church, and when he made his will he cut her out of the succession. Her parents were by now divorced and she began a lengthy dispute with her father when he too bypassed her and entailed his property on his heirs male. After Queen Margaret's death he remarried and had two sons, but although neither survived infancy, he still insisted that his titles would eventually go to his brother, not to his daughter, and they were on bad terms for several years.<br>
<br>When Edward VI succeeded his father, Margaret hastened to court with little Lord Darnley to show him off to the young king, but for much of protestant Edward's reign she found it prudent to stay at Temple Newsam, her household becoming the centre for Roman Catholics in England. In 1553 Edward VI died, Mary I became queen, and Margaret suddenly found herself at the centre of court life once more. Mary granted her apartments in Westminster Palace, sent her luxurious furniture and tapestries, authorized the provision of food and drink for her household free of charge, and showered her with gifts: new gowns, a girdle of gold set with diamonds and rubies, diamond rings, and revenues of nearly 3000 marks a year from taxes on the wool trade. Moreover, as Mary's relations with her half-sister, Elizabeth, deteriorated, she began to give Margaret precedence over the latter, treating her as though she were heir presumptive once more. When Mary married Philip of Spain, Margaret was in attendance as first lady and soon afterwards she named her next child Philip.<br>
<br>Margaret and her father were reconciled shortly before his death in 1557. For a time she styled herself &#145;countess of Lennox and Angus&#146;, but the fact that her husband had forfeited his Scottish lands complicated her claim and in the end her father's earldom passed to a male cousin. Mary was by now seriously ill; she died the following year. As always the earl and countess of Lennox were among the first to congratulate the new monarch, and Elizabeth I received them graciously. In private Margaret made no secret of the fact that she thought she had the better claim to the throne, for she considered Elizabeth to be illegitimate. Once more Roman Catholics in England looked to the countess of Lennox for leadership and she moved from Temple Newsam to Settrington House, near Burlington Bay, where she could have more direct contact with France, and with her niece Mary, queen of Scots. Soon her house was full of secret agents, plotting both for and against Elizabeth I.<h2>
<a name="LordDarnley"></a>Lord Darnley</h2>Margaret had always envisaged a splendid future for her son Lord Darnley. Tall and fair, with a ready smile, handsome, athletic, well-educated, and apparently intelligent, he was the focus of her life and she had long cherished hopes that he would one day marry her niece Mary, queen of Scots. Mary was the wife of the French dauphin, of course, but Fran&ccedil;ois was delicate and immature. Perhaps he would not survive. Determined to draw Mary's attention to the boy, Margaret sent him across with congratulations when Fran&ccedil;ois succeeded his father, and again with condolences when he died. Now all her hopes could be realized. Lennox, who according to a contemporary was &#145;wholly governed by his wife&#146;  (Strickland, 2.366), was happy to go along with her plans.<br>
<br>When Mary, queen of Scots, arrived safely back in Scotland in August 1561, Margaret was so delighted that she forgot to be discreet, telling people openly that her son would marry Mary, they would rule Scotland together, claim the English throne and dispose of protestant Elizabeth. Needless to say, the various spies in the Lennox household were quick to report this to the English queen, who immediately summoned Margaret and her family to London, imprisoned Lennox in the Tower, and sent Margaret and two of her younger children to the custody of Sir Richard and Lady Sackville at Sheen. When Lennox fell ill Margaret pleaded for his release, reminding Elizabeth that he suffered from an illness that made him unable to tolerate being alone, but it was not until November 1562 that he was allowed to join his wife and the following February before they were released.<br>
<br>Undeterred by their recent reverses Margaret set about winning Elizabeth's confidence once more by means of flattering letters. By July 1564 she was back at court, acting with the queen as godmother to William Cecil's new daughter, while Lord Darnley carried the sword before Elizabeth on official occasions, as the prince nearest to the throne. Gratifying though that might be, Margaret had not abandoned her ambitious plans for him, and although her husband and son later denied it, she may well have had a hand in Elizabeth's puzzling decision to allow Darnley to travel to Scotland, where his father had recently gone to reclaim his estates. Lennox's restoration and his wife's final abandonment of her claims to the earldom of Angus in November 1565 were the key events that ushered in the reshaping of the Scottish court as a prelude to Queen Mary's marriage to Darnley. Moreover Lady Lennox plied Mary with letters urging her son's virtues, and sent gifts of jewellery to the Scottish nobility to encourage them to favour the union.<br>
<br>It had suited Elizabeth to divert Queen Mary with thoughts of Darnley as a possible husband, but when Mary took her at her word and announced her betrothal to him, the English queen was appalled. Realizing that she had made a dreadful mistake, she immediately summoned Darnley and Lennox back to London. They refused to go and so Margaret was sent to the Tower once more, arriving by water at Traitors' Gate on 20 June 1565. At the same time the privy council seized all the Lennox properties. An inventory of the contents of Temple Newsam, made for the court, records sumptuous furnishings, portraits of Margaret and her husband, her mother, and Henry VIII, and some touching personal items such as the ermine-trimmed crimson velvet and crimson satin bearing cloths used at the baptisms of the all too often short-lived Lennox children.<br>
<br>Margaret was still in the Tower on the afternoon of 19 February 1567 when William Cecil's wife and Lady William Howard arrived with terrible news. Lord Darnley had been murdered, and they mistakenly told her that Lennox had been killed too. This was later contradicted, but Margaret was in such a state of shock that her visitors had to summon Dr Huick, one of the royal physicians, and the dean of Westminster to come to her assistance. She was later allowed to go back to Sheen, while Lennox remained in Scotland, trying to prosecute James Hepburn, fourth earl of Bothwell, for his son's murder.<br>
<br>Bothwell was acquitted, and Lennox left Scotland in disgust. He joined his wife at Sheen and Elizabeth gave them the dilapidated royal palace of Coldharbour in London as their residence. They were desperately short of money, but although the queen at last permitted them to have the revenues from their estates she refused to allow them to administer their properties themselves. In spite of these difficulties, in January 1568 they commissioned a large picture showing the body of Darnley in gilded armour, with the earl, countess, their younger son, Charles, and their grandson James VI grouped around, calling for vengeance. According to one of the many inscriptions, the countess commissioned the painting so that if she and her husband did not live long enough to see their grandson and tell him to seek revenge, the picture would convey the message for them.<br>
<br>When they heard that autumn that Mary, queen of Scots, had arrived in England, the earl and countess hurried to court, clad in deepest mourning, and threw themselves on their knees before Elizabeth, begging for justice. Margaret's face &#145;was all swelled and stained with tears&#146;  (Strickland, 2.423) but her passionate cries for vengeance lasted so long that Elizabeth's initial sympathy turned to impatience and she told her not to prejudge the issue. In 1570, however, when the Scottish regent, the earl of Moray, was assassinated, Elizabeth agreed to consider a plan for bringing James VI to England. At her urging Lennox became the next regent, and set off for Scotland, intending to bring his grandson south. Margaret stayed with the queen to guarantee his good faith.<h2>
<a name="Widowhood"></a>Widowhood</h2>It seems to have been Elizabeth I herself who broke the news to Margaret when Lennox was shot in the back in a fracas outside Stirling Castle on 4 September 1571 and died at four o'clock that same afternoon, asking his friends to &#145;remember my love to my wife Meg, whom I beseech God to comfort&#146;  (Fraser, <span class="italic">Lennox</span>, 1.416). He was buried in the castle chapel, and Margaret put up an elaborate monument. According to some accounts she commissioned the famous Lennox jewel, now in the Royal Collection, at this time. A locket made in the shape of a heart, it is richly enamelled, set with a large sapphire and decorated with allegorical figures, her husband's initials and enigmatic inscriptions which seem to refer to her future hopes for James VI.<br>
<br>Margaret's son Charles was now the only one of her eight children still alive. In 1574 she obtained the queen's permission to visit Scotland with him, but from the very beginning Elizabeth was suspicious, believing that she might be plotting with Mary, queen of Scots. Margaret's passionate grief and rage at Mary had long since passed and soon after the death of Lennox the two women had been reconciled, united by their shared concern for their &#145;peerless jewel&#146;, James VI  (Fraser, <span class="italic">Lennox</span>, 2.449). Knowing this, Elizabeth was convinced that Margaret would try to see Mary, but although Margaret does not seem to have done so, she found herself in trouble for another reason. Staying at Rufford on the way north, Charles fell in love with Lady Shrewsbury's daughter, Elizabeth Cavendish, and the two mothers arranged their marriage. Her suspicions redoubled, the queen summoned them to London and sent both Margaret and Lady Shrewsbury to the Tower. During this imprisonment Margaret corresponded regularly with Mary, queen of Scots, sending her the gift of a small piece of lace made partly from her own white hairs.<br>
<br>Released in the autumn of 1574, Margaret lived at Stepney with her son, his wife, and their baby daughter, Arabella Stuart. By now she was deeply in debt and Charles, earl of Lennox, was seriously ill with tuberculosis. When he died in 1576, his mother fell into &#145;a languishing decay&#146;  (Strickland, 2.448) but she roused herself to try to claim the earldom of Lennox for Arabella. Her efforts were unsuccessful, and on 7 March 1578 she was taken violently ill after entertaining Robert Dudley, earl of Leicester, to supper. She died peacefully two days later, on the evening of 9 March. There was talk of poisoning, but such rumours often accompanied a sudden death in court circles at the time. In fact, Margaret had long been suffering from a colic, presumably a digestive disorder. She was buried in Henry VII's chapel in Westminster Abbey on 3 April, at the expense of the queen, and a quarter of a century later her grandson James VI and I erected a fine monument in her memory.<br>
<br>Margaret Douglas's position as granddaughter of Henry VII of England, aunt of Mary, queen of Scots, and countess of Lennox drew her into many of the complex political events of her time. She never hesitated to employ her consummate charm as well as her taste for devious scheming in her efforts to advance the interests of both her family and the Roman Catholic religion. It was her tragedy that her ambitions brought nothing but disaster to herself, her husband, and her adored son Lord Darnley.<br>
