<span class="headword">Nevill,  Meresia Dorothy Augusta</span>  (1849&#150;1918), <span class="occ">political activist</span>, was born on 14 December 1849 at 29 Upper Grosvenor Street, London, the eldest of the four surviving children of Reginald Henry Nevill (1807&#150;1878) and the hostess and horticulturist <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37805/', "Lady Dorothy Fanny Nevill (1826&#150;1913)")</script>, daughter of Horatio Walpole, third earl of Orford, and Mary Walpole, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Fawkener.<br>
<br>The outstanding influence in Meresia Nevill's life was undoubtedly her mother, Lady Dorothy, a notable society hostess and a woman with extensive connections in the world of politics and literature. Her early years were spent at Dangstein, Sussex, where Lady Dorothy guided the education of her three sons and only daughter, and where Meresia studied with a governess. In keeping with upper-class custom she was presented at court in 1871, but by all accounts her coming out as a d&eacute;butante was an unhappy experience, made the more awkward perhaps by signs of the St Vitus's Dance from which she suffered all her life. A &#145;manly&#146; young woman, with cropped hair and a deep gruff voice, hers might have been the lot of the dutiful, unmarried daughter: becoming social secretary and companion to her busy and sometimes difficult mother. However, from an early age she demonstrated a marked interest in public affairs, and embarked on a productive life in politics. Her powerful talents for organization and public speaking were nurtured within the embryonic <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/42172', "Primrose League")</script> and Ladies' Grand Council. A generous inheritance from her father precluded any financial need to marry, and consequently there was no impediment to a political career that consumed much energy and took her on speaking tours around the country.<br>
<br>Although mainly a tory stronghold, Lady Dorothy's London home in Charles Street, Berkeley Square, attracted men and women from across the political spectrum. Disraeli had been a neighbour and close friend, and it was at her famed luncheon table in the 1880s that members of the so-called Fourth Party discussed the idea of the Primrose League. Eschewing her mother's less partisan views, but acquiring her taste for politics, Meresia Nevill became an &#145;uncompromising Tory&#146;, which she steadfastly remained all her life. Having joined the Primrose League on 6 February 1884, once women were admitted to membership, Meresia and Lady Dorothy were among those attending the inaugural meeting of the Ladies' Grand Council the following year. Appointed honorary treasurer at her mother's prompting, Meresia remained on the executive committee of the Ladies' Grand Council in that capacity until 1904, when she became honorary secretary, and then a vice-president until her death in 1918.<br>
<br>The <span class="roman">Corrupt Practices Act</span> of 1883, which forbade the payment of canvassers at elections, indirectly paved the way for the Dames of the Primrose League to provide an &#145;army of unpaid substitutes&#146;. Meresia Nevill was perhaps the person most instrumental in directing this new force in politics. From her organizational base at the league headquarters in Victoria Street, Westminster, she transformed the Dames into an efficient organization of backroom constituency workers, which quickly became the envy of other political parties. Guy Nevill was later to observe that &#145;Like Boadicea she led an army&#146;, and could be seen at election time wheeling around the streets of London in her blue and white dog cart  (<span class="italic">Exotic Groves</span>, 166). Any apprehensions about the public nature of this new political activity for women were quickly dispelled by the success of their efforts at the general elections of 1885, 1892, and 1895. She publicized the work of the league in effective speeches at habitation meetings around the country and in articles in society magazines. While thus developing the political skills of a great many women&#151;she likened canvassing to political district visiting&#151;she was none the less lukewarm on the feminist implications of their work, and always maintained the official league line on women's suffrage: that it was a matter of personal opinion which should not be made an object of league policy. Her own views on the subject are not recorded.<br>
<br>Meresia Nevill remained her mother's indispensable companion&#151;&#145;my sheet anchor and rudder&#146;&#151;both at social functions on behalf of Erridge habitation at the family home of Lord Abergavenny and at their London residence in Charles Street until Lady Dorothy's death in 1913  (<span class="italic">Life and Letters</span>, 287). When the First World War broke out the Ladies' Grand Council, with Meresia Nevill at the centre of activities, turned its attention to fund-raising for the war effort. After an illness of a few months she died of cancer on 26 October 1918 at 29 Sloane Gardens, London.<br>
