<span class="headword">Goodwin,  Ronald Alfred <span class="st"> [Ron]</span></span>  (1925&#150;2003), <span class="occ">conductor, composer, and arranger</span>, was born at 10 Corry Street, Devonport, Plymouth, Devon, on 17 February 1925, the younger son of James Goodwin (<i>d</i>. 1952), a Metropolitan Police constable engaged in security work at the naval dockyard, and his wife, Bessie Violet, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Godsland (<i>d</i>. 1966). He learned to play the piano from the age of five, and when he was nine the family returned to London. At Willesden county grammar school he took up the trumpet and joined the school band. When the Second World War broke out the family moved to Harrow, and Goodwin transferred to Pinner county grammar school, where he formed his own band&#151;Ron Goodwin and the Woodchoppers.<br>
<br>In 1943, after a brief spell as an insurance clerk, Goodwin joined the arranging department of the music publisher Campbell, Connelly &amp; Co. There he received invaluable help from the arranger Harry G. Stafford, and he also took private conducting lessons from Siegfried de Chabot, a professor at the Guildhall School of Music. He subsequently worked as an arranger for Paramor&#150;Gold Orchestral Services and played trumpet for Harry Gold and his Pieces of Eight. In 1945 he became head of the arranging department at Bron Associated Publishers, and very soon he was arranging for bands of the day including the Ted Heath, Geraldo, and BBC dance orchestras. On 3 July 1947 he married Ellen Gertrude Drew, daughter of William Lewis Drew, postman. They had one son, Christopher Russell Goodwin (<i>b</i>. 1951).<br>
<br>From 1949 Goodwin conducted for the Polygon company, arranging and conducting recordings of Petula Clark and Jimmy Young, including the latter's number one hit, &#145;Too Young&#146; (1951). He then began an association with George Martin of Parlophone Records, which from 1953 saw him arranging and conducting more than 300 recordings for over fifty artists, including Peter Sellers in the series of three LPs that culminated in 1960 in <span class="italic">Peter and Sophia</span> and its hit single &#145;Goodness, Gracious Me!&#146;. He simultaneously made his own recordings and broadcasts as Ron Goodwin and his Concert Orchestra, and in addition began to compose scores for documentary films at Merton Park studios.<br>
<br>In 1958 Goodwin wrote his first feature film score for <span class="italic">Whirlpool</span>, with screenplay by Lawrence P. Bachmann. After Bachmann became executive producer at MGM British Studios in 1959 Goodwin composed and conducted the music for most of its productions, as well as working for other film studios. Especially successful was his music for <span class="italic">Murder She Said</span> (1961), and for other films featuring Margaret Rutherford as Agatha Christie's Miss Marple. However, he really made his name with the wider public with the film <span class="italic">633 Squadron</span> (1964), producing an ingenious main theme using six fast beats and three slow beats. Music for <span class="italic">Those Magnificent Men in their Flying Machines</span> (1965) cemented Goodwin's high public profile, as did that for <span class="italic">Battle of Britain</span> (1969), commissioned to replace a score by Sir William Walton that the studio deemed unsuitable. Others of over sixty feature films to use his music included <span class="italic">The Trap</span> (1966), which featured Oliver Reed and whose theme became widely familiar through television coverage of the London marathon. Goodwin also composed the scores for <span class="italic">Where Eagles Dare</span> (1969), Alfred Hitchcock's <span class="italic">Frenzy</span> (1972), and <span class="italic">Force Ten from Navarone</span> (1978).<br>
<br>Meanwhile Goodwin's LPs on the Columbia Studio Two label, models of good taste in their integration of elements of jazz and swing into the classical orchestral format, won wide popularity and earned him a gold disc for the album <span class="italic">Spellbound</span> (1973). In 1970 he first appeared as guest conductor of leading orchestras, with a repertory combining current popular music and film themes, with his own linking anecdotes. These concerts proved hugely popular, leading to invitations to conduct across the world. Goodwin's more extended compositions included his <span class="italic">Drake 400 Suite</span> (1980) and <span class="italic">Armada 400 Suite</span> (1988), both commissioned by his native Plymouth. His <span class="italic">New Zealand Suite</span> (1983) marked a long association with the New Zealand Symphony Orchestra, which in 1978 had earned him a platinum disc from EMI New Zealand for the album <span class="italic">Going Places</span>. He received three Ivor Novello awards, including a lifetime achievement award, and was a fellow of the City of Leeds College of Music and a freeman of the City of London. On 22 September 1986, after the dissolution of his first marriage, he married Heather Elizabeth Mary Dunsden, whom he had known since her childhood. She was the daughter of Harold Wesley Dunsden, civil servant.<br>
<br>Goodwin was a musical perfectionist, but with a fine rapport with his fellow artists. He was recognized as a kind, caring man, with a wonderful sense of humour. A keen worker with young people, he was much involved with the Hampshire County Youth Orchestra and the City of Birmingham Schools' Concert Orchestra. For many years he conducted a series of light-hearted Christmas shows with the Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra, the final ones only a few days before his death at his home, Blacknest Cottage, Brimpton Common, Berkshire, on 8 January 2003, following a heart attack. He was survived by his wife, Heather, and his son, Christopher.<br>
