<span class="headword">Dent, Sir  Francis Henry</span>  (1866&#150;1955), <span class="occ">railway administrator</span>, was born at Cerrig Domas, Holyhead, Anglesey, on 31 December 1866, the second son of Charles Bayley Calmady Dent (1832&#150;1894), and his wife, Corinna, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Courcoumelli (or Kurkomellis) (1840&#150;1918), who was born in Corfu. His father, who had served as an officer in the Royal Navy and held the rank of admiral, was marine superintendent of the London and North-Western Railway (LNWR) at Holyhead from 1867 to 1892. His elder brother, Charles Hastings Dent (1864&#150;1956), also became a railway manager.<br>
<br>In October 1884, at the age of seventeen, Dent began his own railway career with the LNWR, joining the general manager's office at Euston, before transferring to the superintendent's department two years later. The superintendent of the line, G. P. Neele, quickly recognized Dent's abilities, and made him outdoor assistant to the superintendent in 1889. At the end of 1893 Dent moved to Chester to become assistant district superintendent of the Chester and Holyhead district, and was promoted to district superintendent in 1899. His success in organizing the freight traffic in north Wales led to his appointment as goods traffic superintendent for the LNWR's Metropolitan district in 1901.<br>
<br>Back in London, Dent was entrusted with the reorganization of Broad Street station, which at the time was handling half a million tons of merchandise per year. Through the introduction of new working practices, including a bonus payment scheme for the workers, Dent was able to improve the throughput of goods at the station and eliminate the need for Broad Street to undergo a costly enlargement. On 2 July 1902 he married Helen Janet (1876&#150;1920), daughter of James Morten, farmer, of Denham, Buckinghamshire; they had three sons. The following year Dent travelled to the United States to observe the latest railway operating methods.<br>
<br>In 1907 Dent left the LNWR to become chief goods manager of the South-Eastern and Chatham Railway (SECR), with the subsidiary title of assistant general manager. In 1909 he chaired the Goods Managers' Conference of the Railway Clearing House. He became general manager of the SECR in 1911 at a salary of &pound;3000 per annum, a figure which rose to &pound;4000 the following year. Prior to the outbreak of war, Dent recommended the electrification of the SECR's network and advocated the creation of a national pool of freight wagons to help reduce working expenses. In July 1911 he was commissioned in the Engineer and Railway Staff Corps, Royal Engineers, and held the rank of lieutenant-colonel until his resignation from the corps upon his retirement in April 1920.<br>
<br>The SECR's position, serving both the Channel ports of Folkestone and Dover, plus the Royal Arsenal at Woolwich, meant that in May 1913 Dent was invited to join the railway executive committee (REC), the group of leading managers responsible for the operation of Britain's railways during the First World War. He continued to be responsible for running the SECR, which from the spring of 1915 contained the main port of embarkation (Folkestone) for troops heading to the western front. He chaired a sub-committee of the REC tasked with providing ambulance trains to deal with the higher-than-expected number of casualties returning from the front. In September 1914 he visited France with representatives of the Great Eastern Railway and LNWR to ascertain the modifications required to allow British rolling stock to function effectively on French rails. In December 1914 he offered the services of the SECR to the War Office to run the operations of the port of Boulogne on behalf of the British army using civilian working methods. Under the resulting &#145;Dent scheme&#146;, the SECR ran the unloading of ships and removal of goods from the port by rail for the military between April and October 1915.<br>
<br>Dent oversaw the work of identifying, organizing and employing thousands of skilled Belgian railwaymen from among the 250,000 refugees estimated to have fled to Britain, and from April 1915 onwards was responsible for interviewing suitable applicants for commissions in the Railway Operating Division. His contribution was officially recognized with the receipt of the L&eacute;gion d'honneur in 1915. Knighted in January 1916, he was chosen by Sir Eric Geddes to investigate the army's railway organization in Egypt and Salonika. When America entered the war, its military authorities also sought his advice on the most effective means of evacuation for wounded troops from the battlefield. In 1918 Dent was elected chairman of the Railway Clearing House General Managers' Conference by his peers.<br>
<br>After the war Dent became a member of the advisory committee on railway subjects at the London School of Economics (LSE), and a council member of the newly formed Institute of Transport. In April 1920 his wife died and he resigned as general manager of the SECR, ending his full-time professional career. However, he continued to play a role in the formation of railway policy, by visiting Austria as president of the commission which reapportioned the rolling stock of the former Austrian State Railways, and acting as director of the Southern Railway.<br>
<br>In 1923 Dent married at the British Consulate in Malaga Winifred Grace Culling (1895&#150;1970), daughter of William Archibald Culling Fremantle, Church of England clergyman; she was the divorced wife of Captain Frederick Hamilton. From March 1929 until January 1949 Dent was chairman of the Railway Clearing House. His talents as a railway manager were widely acknowledged within and outside the industry, and his contribution between 1914 and 1918 personified the importance of effective administrative practices to the co-ordination of Britain's war effort. He died at his home, Warblington Lodge, Havant, Hampshire, on 4 June 1955.<br>
