<span class="headword">Kennedy,  Vans</span>  (1783&#150;1846), <span class="occ">army officer and Sanskrit and Persian scholar</span>, was born at Pinmore in the parish of Ayr, Scotland, the youngest son of Robert Kennedy of Pinmore and his wife, Robina, daughter of John Vans of Barnbarroch, Wigtownshire, who on marrying his cousin assumed the name of Agnew. Kennedy belonged to an old Ayrshire family and was connected with the houses of Cassillis and Eglintoun. His father was ruined by the failure of the Ayr Bank, and had to sell Pinmore and retire to Edinburgh, where he died in 1790. The care of their numerous children, who included the writer of religious tales <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15371/', "Grace Kennedy (1782&#150;1825)")</script>, then fell to his widow, who was a woman of great strength and ability.<br>
<br>Kennedy was educated in Edinburgh, at Berkhamsted, and finally at Monmouth and was noted in youth for his studious habits. He was particularly fond of language study, rather in its theoretical and grammatical sides than in the spoken. On the completion of his fourteenth year he returned to Edinburgh, and, having obtained a cadetship in the East India Company's Bombay army, he sailed for Bombay in 1800. Shortly after his arrival he was employed with his corps, the 1st battalion of the 2nd grenadiers, against the people of the Malabar district, and received a wound in his neck, from the effects of which he suffered all his life. In 1807 he became Persian interpreter to the peshwa's subsidiary force at Sirur, then commanded by Colonel W. Wallace (<i>d</i>. 1809). While at Sirur Kennedy had frequent opportunities of meeting Sir Barry Close and Sir James Mackintosh, both of whom greatly admired him. In 1817 he was appointed judge-advocate-general to the Bombay army, and on 30 September of the same year he contributed a paper on Persian literature to the Literary Society of Bombay, forerunner of the Bombay branch of the Asiatic Society. Mountstuart Elphinstone, who described Kennedy as the most learned man of his acquaintance, gave him the appointment of Marathi and Gujarati translator of the regulations of government, but the post was abolished a few months after Elphinstone's retirement. Kennedy was promoted to major in 1820, and held the office of judge-advocate-general until 1835, when as the result of a dispute or misunderstanding he was removed by Sir John Keane. After that he was appointed oriental translator to the government, and he held this office until his death.<br>
<br>Kennedy remained a student throughout his life, and he seems to have belonged to the type of the recluse and self-denying scholar. He was described as working sixteen hours a day, and as spending all his money on manuscripts and munshis, as well as in relieving the wants of others if he felt they were the victims of injustice. He contributed several papers to the Bombay branch of the Asiatic Society, of which he served successively as secretary, president, and honorary president, and in 1824 he published at Bombay a Marathi&#150;English dictionary. In 1828 he published in London a quarto volume entitled <span class="italic">Researches into the Origin and Affinity of the Principal Languages of Asia and Europe</span>, and in 1831 he followed this with another quarto entitled <span class="italic">Researches into the Nature and Affinity of Ancient and Hindu Mythology</span>. These were scholarly works for their time and show energetic and independent thinking. Though their findings and hypotheses are now almost entirely superseded, they none the less both deserve attention as documents in the history of western studies in Indology, historical philology, and comparative religion. The first considers both semitic and Indo-European linguistics and makes some corrections to the assertions of other early scholars in these fields. But the erroneous conclusion of the work, based on examination of comparative vocabulary, was that Sanskrit was the parent language of Greek, Latin, and Gothic. In the second work Kennedy similarly tries to derive the Graeco-Roman, Etruscan, and Thracian religious systems from that of India. Kennedy also wrote five letters on the Puranas, and had a controversy with Horace Hayman Wilson and Sir Graves Champney Haughton on the subject of Vedanta philosophy. He published in Bombay in 1832 a work on military law, of which a second edition appeared in 1847. A list of his principal writings is appended to the biographical memoir by James Bird in the journal of the Bombay branch of the Royal Asiatic Society for 1848. Kennedy died in Bombay on 29 December 1846, and the next day was buried with due military honours at the old European cemetery in Sonepur, Bombay. He does not appear to have married.<br>
