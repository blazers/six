<span class="headword">Spert, Sir  Thomas</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1541), <span class="occ">naval administrator</span>, of unknown parentage, must have distinguished himself in naval service well before 1512. His marine skills are attested by payment to him from January 1512 of 8<i>d</i>. a day from the petty customs of London for looking after the king's new ship, <i>Mary Rose</i>. Sir Edward Howard's appointment as lord admiral on 7 April 1512 brought Spert to prominence as Howard immediately sought competent captains for his fleet of eighteen ships. On 16 April Thomas Spert of Stepney was paid &#145;conduyte money&#146; at the rate of 6<i>d</i>. per man recruited for each 12 miles of distance travelled in &#145;garderying together&#146; mariners. By 12 June Spert had recruited men at distances of between 130 and 150 miles from London. The significance of that wartime allowance (later raised to 30<i>s</i>. a month under Sir William Fitzwilliam) emerged six months later when Spert together with three other expert masters were paid 100<i>s</i>. for horse hire during the week that they journeyed from Southampton to Eltham and back to share with the king &#145;their mynde in bestowyng the Kyng's shippes this winter&#146;&#151;that is from 28 October 1512 until 11 February 1513. As &#145;Master of the <i>Mary Rose</i>&#146;, Spert had a budget of &pound;200 for her winter care, approving payment of &pound;132 4<i>s</i>. 3&frac12;<i>d</i>. to John Hopton, then clerk controller, for organizing her hard standing near Woolwich between 28 October 1512 and 11 February 1513, and to pay John Brown, painter, for fourteen flags and pennants with St George's cross. On 15 March 1513 Spert was paid 100<i>s</i>. for his &#145;lodesmanshippe&#146; or pilotage to Danzig; &pound;4 for the lodging of himself and another pilot in Zeeland (Thomas Frende, purser of the <i>Dragon</i>, for whom he had signed a petition to the lord chancellor seeking diplomatic protection as he had retained his services for the war effort); plus 60<i>s</i>. for piloting the <i>Mary Rose</i> into the Thames. On 21 April 1513 Spert assumed a similar role for the bigger <i>Henri Grace a Dieu</i> procuring her new rigging and decking, and also flags and pennants. On 10 November 1514 Spert was granted an annuity of &pound;20 in succession to Master Woodless for keeping the secret of the newly discovered Black Deep Channel into the Thames.<br>
<br>From 1511 to 1514 Spert petitioned to transform the body administering Trinity House's almshouses in Deptford into an important marine corporation, and to initiate a census of all English shipping over the next decade he acted with Robert Brygandyne, clerk of the ships, and others when charging the treasury of the chamber for naval repairs. A letter from the lord high admiral, William Fitzwilliam, to Wolsey of 16 August 1522 reveals Spert had found at Portsmouth &#145;a place nearly a mile within the haven where the <i>Henry</i> and the <i>Great Galley</i> can lie without spending half as much tackle as now, and they will be safer from rafts&#146;. In April 1523 Spert was consulted by Fitzwilliam on how to destroy Scottish vessels at Boulogne.<br>
<br>Spert was promoted clerk comptroller of the king's ships in 1524 to work with &#145;the rule of all the foresaid ships maisters, and maryners with the advise of Brygandine&#146;. From 1524 he worked closely with William Gonson authorizing many repairs&#151;for example approving payment of &pound;79 13<i>s</i>. 4<i>d</i>. in August 1529 for rigging and trimming for the <i>Minion</i> and the <i>Mary Guildford</i>, and making payments for the victuals and wages of the keepers of the king's ships while the ships were wintering. Spert was knighted for his part in such matters at Whitehall Palace in 1529 and received a grant of arms. Until 1533 he acted as master of the <i>Henri Grace a Dieu</i>. From 1527 Thomas Jermyn, Trinity House pilot, who had found the Black Deep Channel, succeeded Brygandyne as his deputy and paymaster. In 1535 Spert was described as master of the king's ships while undertaking a seagoing command to curb &#145;certain rovers active in the Channel&#146;.<br>
<br>During 1536 Spert sat as an assessor in the high court of admiralty when Trinity House's right to levy pilotage charges for the Thames was upheld. In 1536 he saw the Trinity House of Newcastle upon Tyne chartered and in 1537 had its charter of 1514 slightly amended. During 1538 and 1539 as the captain of Portsmouth he supervised the fortification of Gosport later known as &#145;Spert's bulwark&#146;. In March 1539 he led a formal naval inspection of the <i>Great Nicholas</i> of Bristol because Gonson was incapacitated by gout.<br>
<br>Spert's version of the charter of 1514 (London, Guildhall, MS 3001A, later misdated 20 May 1513) follows a woodcut of two carracks flying St George's crosses and a waterside chapel. Another element drafted on 21 February 1541 shows him as the master of Trinity House devising an educational regime for children of the brotherhood free of charge to their parents or friends, to which duty he appointed the chaplain (first envisaged in 1514) to teach for &pound;8 a year plus lodging and clothing. His piety is apparent as these pages are bound with <i>Horae beatissme virginis</i> and woodcuts by Wynkin de Worde printed between 1509 and 1534.<br>
<br>In August 1541 Spert acted for the last time as an assessor in the high court of admiralty. He had married three times, first Margery, then Anne Salkell, and last Mary Fabian, daughter of John Fabian and his wife, Anne Waldegrave; John Fabian's uncle was the chronicler Robert Fabyan. With Mary, Spert had two children, Anne, who married Thomas Brook and later John Skott, and Richard, who later married Grissell Salkell of King's Wood, Wiltshire. Mary was the executor named when on 28 November 1541, &#145;sick in bodie&#146;, Spert made his will . He died at Stepney in the following December (not, as erroneously stated on his monument in St Dunstan and All Saints, Stepney, on 8 September). Under the terms of the will, Mary received his profitable Blackwall pasturage until Richard should come of age. Lesser bequests went to his married daughter and to his cousin, Margaret Spert, married to the famous Guinea seaman, John Lok.<br>
