<span class="headword">Sheffield,  Robert</span>, marquess of Normanby  (1711&#150;1715), <span class="occ">subject of a memorial effigy</span>, was born on 11 December 1711, probably at Buckingham House (now Buckingham Palace), Westminster, the second son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25297/', "John Sheffield, first duke of Buckingham and Normanby (1647&#150;1721)")</script>, and his third wife, Katherine, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Lady Katherine Darnley (1681/2&#150;1743), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/14593/', "James II")</script> and his mistress <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25020/', "Catharine Sedley")</script>, and widow of James Annesley, third earl of Anglesey (<i>d</i>. 1702). The couple's first son, John, had died before Robert's birth; consequently Robert was the heir to the dukedom and bore his father's second title of marquess of Normanby by courtesy.<br>
<br>Robert was baptized at St Margaret's, Westminster, on 16 December 1711 by John Robinson, then bishop of Bristol and as lord privy seal a ministerial colleague of the duke of Buckingham. Aged three years and one month he died, probably at Buckingham House, on 1 February 1715, and was buried in St Margaret's, Westminster. Following his father's death, his remains were moved in 1721 to the family vault in the Henry VII chapel, Westminster Abbey, as part of his mother's plan to glorify the Sheffield ducal line. It was probably at this time that a memorial effigy was constructed, although no accounts of its manufacture are known to survive. An alternative is that the effigy was constructed in 1735 to accompany the effigy of Normanby's younger brother, Edmund Sheffield, second duke of Buckingham and Normanby, although the clothes in which the effigy is dressed date from 1715.<br>
<br>The effigy stands 3 feet 3 inches tall; the head and bust are wax, with glass eyes and a wig of human hair. The face may be based on a death mask, possibly by Mrs Goldsmith, &#145;arguably the finest wax modeller of the day&#146;  (Harvey and Mortimer, 14) who in 1700 had made the death mask of William, duke of Gloucester, son of Queen Anne. The hands and forearms are also wax, but the rest of the figure is yellow canvas stuffed &#145;with tow and other materials&#146;  (ibid., 125). The effigy wears the formal clothes of an aristocratic child of the period, which were themselves modelled on the dress of an adult, with velvet robe and long coat of silk and satin, showing Polish and Turkish influences in design. The effigy also wears formal children's shoes, a rare survival for the period; at its base is a painted wooden unicorn, a heraldic device probably referring to the duchess of Buckingham whose armorial bearings included a unicorn and a goat as supporters.<br>
<br>The memorial effigy remains in Westminster Abbey with others commissioned by the duchess. It has been stated that the carrying of these effigies at Sheffield family funerals in the early eighteenth century &#145;had no connection whatsoever with the traditional role of the monarchical effigy&#146;  (Harvey and Mortimer, 19). Nevertheless the association suggests a wish on the part of the duchess to commemorate her own royal descent and to assert the right of the Sheffield family to a prominence in contemporary politics. The duchess's dynastic ambitions were thwarted, but the effigy of her son provides an example of the dress and posture of a child of the early eighteenth-century British &eacute;lite.<br>
