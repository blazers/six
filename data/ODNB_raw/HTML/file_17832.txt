<span class="headword">Maitland,  Richard</span>, fourth earl of Lauderdale  (1653&#150;1695), <span class="occ">Jacobite nobleman</span>, was born on 20 June 1653, the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17818/', "Charles Maitland, third earl of Lauderdale (c.1620&#150;1691)")</script>, and Elizabeth, younger daughter and heir of Richard Lauder of Hatton. He was known by the designation Maitland of Grogar until his father succeeded to the Lauderdale earldom in 1682, after which he assumed the title Viscount Maitland. On 1 July 1678 he married Lady Anne (<i>b</i>. 1657/8, <i>d</i>. 1734), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4473/', "Archibald Campbell, ninth earl of Argyll")</script>. They had one son, baptized on 3 May 1679, who died in infancy. On 23 September 1678, he was appointed general of the mint, an office he held jointly with his father. In October of that year he was named as a privy councillor, and on 8 April 1680 attained further office when he was appointed lord justice clerk. He was, however, not to hold this position for any length of time. In February 1684 he was dismissed from office and replaced by Sir James Foulis of Colinton, on being suspected of complicity in the schemes of his exiled father-in-law, Argyll. It would appear Maitland was implicated by a ciphered letter from the countess of Argyll to her husband, intercepted on its way to the Netherlands. In August he was deprived of his position as one of the commissioners of the exchequer, further evidence of his fall from grace.<br>
<br>Nevertheless, it seems that Maitland had little interest in the machinations of Argyll, and by April 1687 was evidently back in favour with James VII and II. On the 9th of that month he was appointed treasurer-depute, with a pension of &pound;300 sterling, and in May was named in the new commission of the privy council. At the revolution he adhered to King James, and in July 1689 was ordered before the council charged with &#145;carieing on horid and unjust designes against the present government &hellip; befor his returne from the Viscount of Dundie and his being in armes with him&#146;. Consequently a warrant was issued for his arrest at his &#145;dwalling hous in Edinburgh, at Hatton and Lauder&#146;, and in August he was denounced as a rebel and put to the horn  (<span class="italic">Reg. PCS</span>, 3rd ser., 13.541). Therefore, it was hardly surprising that he chose to join his king in France rather than accept the Williamite settlement. Subsequently, he was said to have joined James's expedition to Ireland, where he was present at the battle of the Boyne.<br>
<br>Although a Catholic and stalwart Jacobite, Maitland disapproved of James's more extreme Catholic policies, and consequently lost favour at the court of St Germain. His wife shared the strong presbyterian sympathies of her father, Argyll, and was apparently ordered to return to Britain, while her husband was forbidden to appear at the Stuart court, and had his pension reduced to 100 pistoles a year. On 9 June 1691 Maitland succeeded his father as fourth earl of Lauderdale, but was outlawed by the court of justiciary on 23 July 1694. He produced a &#145;m&eacute;moriall&#146; on the state of Scotland dating from approximately 1690, and published with Nathaniel Hooke's correspondence in 1870&#150;71, and a two-volume translation of the works of Virgil, perhaps first published in 1707.<br>
<br>Lauderdale died in exile at Paris in 1695 and his wife, who survived her husband and subsequently married Charles Stewart, sixth earl of Moray, died on 18 September 1734, aged seventy-six years. He was succeeded as fifth earl by his younger brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17828/', "Sir John Maitland (c.1655&#150;1710)")</script> of Ravelrig, first baronet.<br>
