<span class="headword">Firbank,  Joseph</span>  (1819&#150;1886), <span class="occ">railway contractor</span>, was born at Bishop Auckland on the south-western edge of the north-east coalfield, the son of Ralph Firbank (1788&#150;1866), a Durham miner, and his wife, Barbara, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Thompson (1790&#150;1874). At the age of seven he was sent to work in a colliery, and attended a night school. In 1833 he obtained employment on the permanent way, and in 1841 secured a sub-contract in connection with the Woodhead Tunnel on the railway from Sheffield to Manchester. In 1845 and 1846 he took similar contracts on the Midland Railway.<br>
<br>The local opposition to railway construction on the part of the aristocracy and landed gentry was so great at this time that on one occasion Firbank was captured while surveying the line and kept a prisoner for twenty-four hours. In 1848 he was engaged on the Rugby and Stamford branch of the London and North Western Railway and lost most of his savings by the bankruptcy of the former contractor of the line. He married, in 1848, Sarah (1820/21&#150;1854), widow of George Fryatt and daughter of William Black, innkeeper and grazier, of Melton Mowbray; they had two sons and a daughter.<br>
<br>Firbank's first large contract was offered by the Monmouthshire Railway and Canal Company in 1854, following a decision to transform all of the company's mineral tramways and canals into passenger railways. He was recommended by Charles Liddell, the company's engineer, with whom he had worked on the London and North Western Railway contract, and he also took the contracts for maintaining the canals in the town of Newport and for the maintenance of the lines for seven years. The latter contract was renewed continually until the company was absorbed by the Great Western Railway. In 1855 he married his deceased wife's sister, Isabella Black (1829/30&#150;1889), with whom he had two daughters and seven sons.<br>
<br>Firbank established his home at Newport, where he formed a close friendship with Crawshaw Bailey, the ironmaster, who supported him financially in his early undertakings. He was employed in South Wales for thirty years. In 1856 Firbank undertook a contract for the widening of the London and North Western Railway near London, and between 1859 to 1866 was engaged upon a number of contracts for the London, Brighton, and South Coast Railway. He was also engaged upon the Midland Company's Bedford and London extension from 1864 until 1868. Liddell was the consulting engineer for this line and it was on his recommendation that Firbank was awarded contracts no. 2 and no. 3 in the vicinity of Kentish Town and the Brent Viaduct. At the height of constructional activity in 1866, Firbank was employing two thousand men, a figure which rose further when he took over the fourth contract from the Waring brothers. In overall terms, the extension gave rise to considerable engineering difficulties and ultimately cost the Midland more than &pound;3 million.<br>
<br>In 1870, in consequence of the quality of his work on the London-based contracts, Firbank was engaged as contractor on the Smardale to Newbiggin section of the Settle and Carlisle extension of the Midland Railway, a stretch of line noted for its impressive physical features and geographic isolation. In the face of appalling weather conditions and difficulties of access at least one contractor retired from the project. Firbank completed his work, however, having taken on further responsibilities involving a junction with the North Eastern Railway. After completing this onerous contract Firbank was engaged in the construction of the Birmingham west suburban section of the Midland Railway, a complex undertaking in view of idiosyncratic local geography and the density of human settlement in the area.<br>
<br>In 1884 Firbank built the St Pancras goods depot of the Midland Railway. The last contract taken by him was for the Bournemouth direct line from Brockenhurst to Christchurch. It proved to be the most troublesome of all his undertakings, and was finally completed by his son. In all, forty-nine lines were constructed by Firbank from 1846 to 1886. Some of them were of decisive importance in extending the railway network of Victorian Britain and his contribution places him in the first rank of railway contractors in company with such towering figures as Thomas Brassey and Samuel Morton Peto. Throughout his career Firbank was a generous and sympathetic employer, anxious to promote the welfare of those whom he employed and to mitigate the worst efforts of their exposure to harsh physical conditions. This was exemplified in the hutted encampment, embracing shops, hospital, reading room, and coffee house, erected in connection with his contract on the Settle and Carlisle line.<br>
<br>Firbank was assisted in his work, first by his nephew, Ralph, and subsequently by his eldest son, Joseph Thomas Firbank. Ralph Firbank established his own contracting business in 1877, but died five years later, aged forty-six. Joseph Thomas Firbank (1850&#150;1910) was educated at Cheltenham College, served as the Conservative MP for Hull East from 1895 and was knighted in 1910; his son was the novelist <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37415/', "Ronald Firbank")</script>.<br>
<br>Firbank died at his home, St Julian's, Christchurch, near Newport, on 29 June 1886. He was described by Samuel Laing as &#145;an excellent specimen of the class of Englishmen who rise up not so much by any transcendent talents, as by intelligence and energy&#146;, and above all by a scrupulous &#145;honesty, inspiring confidence&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>). He was tireless in his work, retiring to bed by nine o'clock and rarely rising later than five. His business acumen was considerable. He was a justice of the peace and deputy lieutenant for the county of Monmouth. Both of these posts, as well as the office of high sheriff, were also filled by his son.<br>
