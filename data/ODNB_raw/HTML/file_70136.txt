<span class="headword">Bridges,  Thomas</span>  (<em>c.</em>1842&#150;1898), <span class="occ">dictionary compiler, missionary, and sheep farmer</span>, was found abandoned, perhaps on a bridge near Bristol, aged about two and a half, and taken to an orphanage, the name of which remains unknown. He was adopted by the Revd George Pakenham Despard, master of a private school in Stapleton, Bristol, and later secretary of the Patagonian Missionary Society. The aim of the society was to establish a mission among the indigenous Y&aacute;mana, or Yaghan, people of the Beagle Channel area of southern Tierra del Fuego. Earlier attempts to establish a mission had failed. In 1833 Robert Fitzroy repatriated to Tierra del Fuego the Fuegians that he had taken on his first voyage, with the intention of leaving one, Jemmy Button, in the care of Richard Matthews, who hoped to establish a mission on the island. The terrified Matthews soon re-embarked on the <i>Beagle</i>. A second attempt was made in 1850, by Allen Gardiner and six companions, who starved to death in 1851. In 1856 Despard, a close friend of Gardiner and now mission superintendent, travelled to Keppel Island, in the Falklands, taking his family with him. An attempt to establish a settlement on Tierra del Fuego in 1859 ended in the massacre of the missionaries by the Y&aacute;mana. Bridges had been left behind on Keppel because of his youth. Despard, who had stayed behind to deal with administrative matters, resigned and returned to England, leaving the young Bridges temporarily in charge of the mission. With the help of the Y&aacute;mana who had been settled by Despard on Keppel, Bridges set about compiling a dictionary of their language. On his arrival, in January 1863, Despard's successor, the Revd W. H. Stirling, found Bridges proficient in Y&aacute;mana and studying its intricate grammar system. In that year they travelled together to Tierra del Fuego, to find that measles had killed many of the Y&aacute;mana. In 1867 they founded a settlement in Ushuaia (&#145;inner harbour to the west&#146;), a large natural harbour on the northern shore of the Beagle Channel. <br>
<br>Recalled to England in the following year by the Patagonian Missionary Society (now renamed the South American Missionary Society), Bridges was ordained deacon. While lecturing in Bristol in 1869 he met and married Mary Ann Varder (1842&#150;1922), a teacher from Harbeton, Devon, and almost immediately set sail for the Falklands. With their nine-month-old daughter (also Mary Ann, who later married the missionary <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/98450/', "Wilfrid Barbrooke Grubb")</script>) they left Keppel in 1871 to settle permanently in Ushuaia. There Bridges acted as judge and peacemaker to the Y&aacute;mana, whom he named Yaghan after their word for the Murray Narrows, the geographical centre of their land. In 1884, as visitors to Tierra del Fuego increased, another outbreak of disease struck Ushuaia, killing over half the native population. Bridges urged the missionary society to obtain land away from encroaching civilization for the Yaghan to settle on, but they declined on the grounds that a mission should confine itself to evangelical work. Disillusioned, and with a growing family, Bridges abandoned his missionary work and obtained a lease on land some 40 miles east of Ushuaia. In 1887 the family moved there and began rearing sheep brought over from the Falklands on a farm named Harbeton after Mary's birthplace in Devon. <br>
<br>Early in 1898 the <i>Belgica</i>, carrying an expedition to the South Pole, ran aground near Harbeton. On board was Dr Frederick A. Cook, the American explorer, who persuaded Bridges that he could arrange publication of his Y&aacute;mana&#150;English dictionary. Bridges had continued his work on the dictionary with enthusiasm:<blockquote>Incredible though it may appear, the language of one of the poorest tribes of men, without any literature, without poetry, song, history or science, may yet through the nature of its structure and its necessities have a list of words and a style of structure surpassing that of other tribes far above them in the arts and comforts of life. My dictionary of Yaghan has One Thousand and Eighty One pages, each averaging 30 words, which multiplied make thirty-two thousand four hundred and thirty words. (T. Bridges, xvii)</blockquote>Cook arranged to pick up the manuscript on his return from Antarctica. In the meantime Bridges sailed with a cargo of timber for sale in Buenos Aires, but fell ill in Bah&iacute;a Blanca during the return journey and was transferred to the British Hospital in Buenos Aires, where he died, of stomach cancer, on 15 July 1898. He was buried in the city's Chacarita cemetery. On his return Cook carried off the manuscript, the fruit of some thirty years' work by Bridges, together with a collection of papers relating to the Y&aacute;mana language. News later reached the Bridges family that the Observatoire Royal Belgique was printing the dictionary under the authorship of Cook, with a statement in small print that Thomas Bridges had been &#145;instrumental in collecting the words&#146;  (L. Bridges, 534). <br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_70136"></a><span class="headword">(Stephen) Lucas Bridges</span>  (1874&#150;1949), <span class="occ">writer and sheep farmer</span>, was born on 31 December 1874 at Ushuaia, the third of Thomas Bridges' six children. On hearing of Cook's appropriation of his father's work Bridges travelled to Belgium in 1910 and convinced M. Lequent, curator of the observatoire, that the order of names on the cover should be reversed, with the authorship going to Thomas Bridges &#145;while at the foot it was to be stated in small type that Dr. Frederick A. Cook had brought the work to the notice of the Observatoire Royal&#146;  (L. Bridges, 534). With the outbreak of the First World War, in 1914 the manuscript of the dictionary disappeared until, fifteen years later, the family received a letter from Dr Ferdinand Hestermann, professor at the University of M&uuml;nster, informing them that he had the manuscript. Hestermann transcribed the dictionary into the anthropos phonetic system and in 1933 it was privately printed at M&ouml;dling, in Austria, in a limited edition of 300 copies. The Bridges family wanted the manuscript donated to the British Museum, but on the outbreak of the Second World War both Hestermann and the manuscript disappeared. At the end of the war both were rediscovered, Hestermann having hidden the manuscript in a kitchen cupboard. It was presented to the British Museum on 9 January 1946. <br>
<br>During its early years Harbeton farm was visited by a small party of Haush, or Manekenk. Their numbers reduced to around sixty, the Haush had been gradually forced further into the swamps and marshes of south-eastern Tierra del Fuego by the Selk'nam, or Ona. In 1894 Bridges made contact with the Selk'nam, feared nomadic hunters who roamed over the steppes of northern and central Tierra del Fuego and were the last Patagonian tribe to come into contact with Europeans. The discovery of gold in 1881 and the establishment of large sheep farms over most of their territory led to conflicts in which the poorly armed Selk'nam suffered heavy loss of life. Many more died from disease and despair in the missions established by the Salesians on Dawson Island and Tierra del Fuego. Bridges befriended the survivors, who had been forced into the inhospitable mountains of southern Tierra del Fuego, learned to speak their language, and accompanied them on trips hunting guanaco (a close relative of the alpaca) and witnessed their religious ceremonies. As pressure on their hunting grounds increased the Selk'nam asked Bridges to establish a farm on the Atlantic coast where they could spend the winter safe from the sheep farmers and miners. In 1907 he obtained a lease to land on the east coast, which he named Viamonte, where he provided shelter and work for some of the Selk'nam. <br>
<br>Falsifying his age, Bridges joined the Royal Field Artillery in 1914 and saw action in the third battle of Ypres, at Passchendaele. While on leave in 1917 he met and married Jannette McLeod Jardine (<i>b</i>. 1890), with whom he had three children. After the war he leased land in an area between the Devuli and Sabi rivers from the British South Africa Company. News of the murder of a farm manager and mounting financial losses in a joint venture brought him back to Patagonia, this time to the remote Rio Baker region of mainland Chile. After suffering several minor heart attacks Bridges retired to Buenos Aires and wrote his autobiography, <span class="italic">Uttermost Part of the Earth</span> (1948). He died in Buenos Aires, of a heart attack, on 4 April 1949; he was buried in the city's Chacarita cemetery. Harbeton and Viamonte are still owned by direct descendants of Thomas Bridges. <br>
<br>In 1850 there were four distinct groups of natives living in Tierra del Fuego and its adjacent archipelago, each with its own language and customs and together numbering at least 10,000. Archaeological evidence suggests that they had been there for over 10,000 years. By the beginning of the twentieth century they were down to a few hundred, and a century later only a handful of old people survived, their languages and traditions forgotten. The Bridges' efforts did not alter their fate, but Thomas's dictionary stands as a record of the Y&aacute;mana language, while Lucas's autobiography records the customs and way of life of his friends the Selk'nam.<br>
