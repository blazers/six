<span class="headword">Elliot,  Ann</span>  (1743&#150;1769), <span class="occ">courtesan and actress</span>, was born on 16 November 1743 in Tonbridge, Kent, the daughter of Richard Elliot (1706?&#150;1771), the sexton of Tonbridge parish church, and his wife, Mary (1716&#150;1748). She moved to London as a lady's servant, but was soon a high-class prostitute, using the name Miss Hooper. She became the prot&eacute;g&eacute;e of the playwright Arthur Murphy (1727&#150;1805), who trained her as an actress and wrote the part of Maria for her in his comedy <span class="italic">The Citizen</span>. She made her d&eacute;but in this role on 2 July 1761, during the summer season at Drury Lane Theatre managed jointly by Murphy and Samuel Foote. Murphy later dedicated the play to her, ascribing its success to her &#145;uncommon talents&#146; and &#145;genuine comic genius&#146;.<br>
<br>In a letter to Murphy dated 22 June 1761, David Garrick had criticized Elliot's pronunciation and claimed that her face was &#145;more form'd to create Passion, than to Express it&#146;; he offered to give her a trial without salary in the coming season. However, she preferred to go to the Crow Street Theatre, Dublin, where Richard Cumberland remembered her playing Maria &#145;with admirable spirit and effect&#146;  (Cumberland, 1.232). After another summer season with Foote, she spent the rest of her career at Covent Garden under John Beard's management. For three seasons she played lively roles in comedies, such as Cherry in George Farquhar's <span class="italic">The Beaux' Stratagem</span>, Bizarre in his <span class="italic">The Inconstant</span>, and Berinthia in Sir John Vanbrugh's <span class="italic">The Relapse</span>. She was particularly successful in comic afterpieces, playing Polly in George Colman's <span class="italic">Polly Honeycombe</span>, Termagant in Murphy's <span class="italic">The Upholsterer</span>, and, above all, Maria in <span class="italic">The Citizen</span>. Her appearances were reduced by illness, particularly in the 1764&#150;5 season. George Ann Bellamy, whose roles she had taken over, remembered that she regained her parts, &#145;Miss Elliot's ill health obliging her often to decline playing&#146;  (Bellamy, 4.103). In 1765&#150;6 she performed only once, for the benefit of the actor Charles Holland at Drury Lane, and the next season at Covent Garden was to be her last. In November 1766 she took her only tragic role, Calista in Nicolas Rowe's <span class="italic">The Fair Penitent</span>; the <span class="italic">Court Miscellany</span> (November 1766, 618) thought she had &#145;very great merit as a tragic actress&#146; but <span class="italic">Thespis</span> found her too &#145;circumscrib'd in voice&#146;  (Kelly, 43). Murphy's final gift to her was the role of Mary Ann in <span class="italic">The School for Guardians</span>, his reworking of Wycherley's <span class="italic">The Country Wife</span>. He quarrelled with Garrick (&#145;a little sneaking rascal&#146;; Taylor, 1.194), accusing him of forestalling the play with his own <span class="italic">Country Girl</span>. Murphy's play was acted six times in January and February 1767, and he gave Elliot the proceeds of the two author's nights.<br>
<br>In his <span class="italic">Life of Arthur Murphy</span>, Jesse Foot gives a description of the &#145;sylphic and enchanting&#146; Ann Elliot as she was in January 1763, when he first saw her: &#145;she was a good figure, somewhat above the middle stature &hellip; her complexion was very clear; her eyes were dark hazel, and her hair a beautiful brown&#146;  (Foot, 188). Her charms attracted lovers, including Augustus Hervey, later third earl of Bristol (1724&#150;1779), who is said in the <span class="italic">Genuine Memoirs of the Life and Adventures of the Celebrated Miss Ann Elliot</span> (1769) to have removed her from the stage (possibly in 1765&#150;6), and the king's brother, Henry Frederick, duke of Cumberland (1745&#150;1790). Cumberland set her up in a house in Greek Street, and it was there that she died, on 30 May 1769, after a long and painful illness. She had remained in touch with Murphy and wished to bequeath him her estate, but he insisted that it should go to her poor relations and acted as one of her executors. The <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> reported that she left &pound;8000; her will mentions plate, jewellery, a considerable quantity of furniture, and &pound;5000 promised her by the duke of Cumberland, of which part had been paid, &pound;1000 being invested in the funds. Her relationship with Cumberland probably ended some months before her death, but he is said to have fulfilled her dying request and ensured that her body was buried with her mother's remains, erecting a monument in Tonbridge churchyard with memorial verses almost certainly written by Murphy.<br>
