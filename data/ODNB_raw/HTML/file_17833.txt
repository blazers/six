<span class="headword">Maitland,  Richard</span>  (<em>c.</em>1714&#150;1763), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, is of unknown origin and parentage. He enlisted with the Royal Artillery as a matross on 1 November 1732, &#145;when about 18&#146;  (Kane, 250). In 1742 he was commissioned a lieutenant-fireworker. His subsequent commissions show the possibility of rapid promotion by merit in the more technical positions during time of war (in this case the War of the Austrian Succession): he was made second lieutenant on 1 May 1743; first lieutenant on 1 April 1744; and captain-lieutenant on 1 August 1747. He fought at Fontenoy in 1745 and probably at some of the less successful battles of the two following years. Following the peace Maitland's promotion was less rapid, but he was made full captain on 1 March 1755.<br>
<br>Maitland was given command of one of the four companies of Royal Artillery formed for service in India in February 1755. One was lost on the way out; the other three arrived safely at Bombay in November 1755, where they joined the garrison. In February 1756 all three companies were engaged in the expedition against the pirates based at Gheria under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel Robert Clive. After returning to Bombay the Royal Artillery companies remained with the garrison and did not take part in the expedition to Bengal in 1757 for the recapture of Calcutta.<br>
<br>On 9 February 1759 all three companies sailed from Bombay with the object of capturing Surat, a prosperous seaport on the River Tapti, 155 miles north of Bombay. The town was defended by a castle, a considerable fortress, which had been taken over by Sidi Masud, admiral to the Mughal emperor, who had installed his own forces and was interfering in the commercial affairs of the town, including trading posts of the Dutch and British East India companies.<br>
<br>As the senior king's officer present Maitland was placed in command of the land force. In addition to the three Royal Artillery companies the expedition included 800 troops from the Bombay European regiment and 1500 sepoys, a total of 2718. Maitland thus has the distinction of being the first Royal Artillery officer to command an overseas expedition comprising a mixed force. The troops took with them six months' supplies and were to receive 200,000 rupees from the merchants of Surat as compensation for not looting the city. Maitland's force landed at Damas (later known as Dentiloury) on 18 February 1759, 9 miles from Surat, where the first camp was formed. On 20 February a new camp was established at Umra, a village on the river bank, close to the city. Maitland assembled his forces to besiege the castle; work began on the breaching of the town's defensive walls on 24 February but on 26 February, Maitland lost about twenty of his men when they drove Sidi Masud's men from Surat's French gardens. However, this action allowed him to bring a battery into close action and bombardment continued for several days, resulting in a small breach in the outer wall. When the frontal assault was repulsed Maitland, fearing heavy casualties, decided on a new plan: to make the main attack from the river, between the outer and inner walls, under covering fire from the accompanying naval force. After a heavy bombardment during the night of 1 March, Maitland sent an assault party comprising 200 European troops and 800 sepoys, which threw the defenders back and took command of the main gate of the outer wall. On 3 March heavy mortars were landed on the river bank to assist the reduction of the inner wall. In the meantime the East India Company agent had been negotiating with the governor of the castle and terms for capitulation were finally agreed at 10 p.m. on 4 March, when British troops marched into Surat. The losses to the besiegers amounted to some 130 killed and 74 wounded. Maitland had proved the capability of the Royal Artillery as well as his own leadership. His skilful deployment of the artillery had been crucial in the defeat of Sidi Masud's forces, who were worn down by the well-judged bombardment.<br>
<br>Maitland spent the next month putting the castle in good order for the remaining garrison, before moving his troops down the river&#151;the last of which arrived back in Bombay on 21 April 1759. Upon his arrival Maitland received a 13-gun salute as well as the thanks of the East India Company, to whom the acquisition of Surat brought an additional revenue of &pound;50,000 a year.<br>
<br>On 3 April 1760 a payment of 120,000 rupees was distributed among the troops as gratuity money for taking the castle of Surat. Maitland's share as officer commanding was 3560 rupees in addition to 1004 rupees as captain of one of the Royal Artillery companies. On 4 May 1760 Maitland led all three Royal Artillery companies into the campaign against the French forts of the Pondicherry coast, which culminated in the capture of Pondicherry after a long siege on 15 January 1761. Maitland's company returned to Bombay shortly after. He remained in India and in November 1762 learned of his promotion to the rank of major, with effect from the previous March&#151;recognition for having commanded the Royal Artillery in India since 1759.<br>
<br>Maitland died in Bombay on 21 February 1763. The whole council of the Bombay presidency attended his burial, later the same day, and the castle battery fired 60 half-minute guns.<br>
