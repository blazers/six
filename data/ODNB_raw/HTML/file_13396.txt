<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Hobart,  Robert</span>, fourth earl of Buckinghamshire  (1760&#150;1816), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born on 6 May 1760, second but first surviving son among the four sons and four daughters of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13390/', "George Hobart, third earl of Buckinghamshire (1731&#150;1804)")</script>, politician, of Nocton, Lincolnshire, and his wife, Albinia Bertie (1737/8&#150;1816), elder daughter and coheir of Lord Vere Bertie [<i>see </i><a target="_top" href="/view/article/74209">Hobart,  Albinia</a>, <i>under</i> <a target="_top" href="/view/article/13390">Hobart,  George</a>]. His parents resided at Nocton from 1766. His surname was then pronounced &#145;Hubberd&#146;. As a boy he performed in plays produced for select audiences by his mother and, like his father, he became a patron of opera and theatre in his adult life. He entered Westminster School in 1770 and after enlisting as ensign in the 59th foot proceeded in 1776 to Strasbourg military academy for a year. He subsequently served in North America, becoming a captain in the 30th foot in 1778, and major in the 18th light dragoons in 1783. He returned from service in 1784 on becoming aide-de-camp to the lord lieutenant of Ireland; subsequently he was made inspector-general of recruits in Ireland. He was a supporter of the ministry, as he assured Pitt in 1788 when aspiring to a lieutenant-colonelcy, though his father leaned to opposition. He sat in the Dublin parliament for Portarlington from 1784 to 1790 and Armagh from 1790 to 1797, where he was mocked for his affected lisp. He was also by-elected to Westminster as member of parliament for Bramber on 15 December 1788 and was returned, after a contest, in 1790 for Lincoln, a seat for which he had been recommended four years before. His parliamentary career, however, was confined largely to Dublin, especially when in 1789 he was appointed chief secretary to the lord lieutenant and sworn on 21 April an Irish privy councillor. Lord Buckingham valued him for having &#145;quickness, parts and the most intimate knowledge of every man in Ireland&#146;  (<span class="italic">Fortescue MSS</span>, 1.428). On 4 or 5 January 1792 he married Margaretta Adderley (<i>d</i>. 1796), daughter of Edmund Burke of Corry and widow of Thomas Adderley of Inishannon, co. Cork, an Irish member of parliament. Lady Holland, in reporting his honourable conduct in so doing, described him as &#145;pleasing, sensible and well-looking, the finest teeth imaginable&#146;  (<span class="italic">Holland</span>, 1.236). The couple had a son, who died young, and a daughter, Sarah, the future countess of Ripon.<br>
<br>Although Hobart acquired a reputation for a convivial personability in Irish government circles, his parliamentary performance in Dublin was less convincing. In the 1790&#150;91 session he failed to answer the oppositionist Henry Grattan's charge that over a third of the 300 members were in the pay of the government. He refused to accept a petition for enfranchisement from the Catholic Committee at the end of the session; however, no member was willing to present it either. He had nevertheless to come to terms with the British government's wishes, as expressed by Pitt and Henry Dundas, for concessions to be made to the Irish Catholics. During visits to London in November 1791 and April 1792, as well as in correspondence in the interim, he defended the protestant ascendancy in Ireland and, supported in 1792 by Sir John Parnell, persuaded ministers temporarily that, if withstood, the Catholics would back down. Richard Burke, Hobart's former schoolfellow, tried to dissuade him from this role, which caused his father, Edmund Burke, to write off Hobart as a stooge of the ascendancy establishment. A cosmetic <span class="roman">Relief Bill</span>, affecting just a few of the Catholic disabilities, was substituted.<br>
<br>On 27 April 1792 Hobart spoke at Westminster in favour of abolition of the slave trade, but three days later disparaged parliamentary reform, particularly in Ireland. Despite his warnings that the Irish administration would be undermined by such a measure, and the lord lieutenant the earl of Westmorland's attempts to dissuade the British ministers, Hobart was by them compelled to introduce a comprehensive <span class="roman">Catholic Relief Bill</span> in the Dublin parliament, on 4 February 1793. London insisted on this as a concomitant to the <span class="roman">Irish Militia Bill</span> intended to raise Catholic as well as protestant recruits to replace the British regiments being withdrawn from Ireland now that war against revolutionary France had started. Hobart consoled himself with the reflection that, at least on the continent, Catholicism was a crippled creed, but the thrust of the debate on the principle of concession lay rather with the argument that protestants and Catholics, as property owners, should unite against the threat presented by the French Revolution. The bill, though mauled in detail, was carried in five weeks, and so was the <span class="roman">Militia Bill</span>. Hobart, sworn of the British privy council on 1 May, was cock-a-hoop, and proposed at the end of the session to induce leading Irish oppositionists to coalesce with government. In October he was named governor of Madras, and dismissed a vengeful letter from Richard Burke on his dereliction of Ireland as downright insanity. When he left Dublin in December he was assured that he might eventually become governor-general of Bengal, and obtained the reversionary grant of the Irish clerkship of the common pleas in exchequer. At Westminster he defended the Irish administration on 8 April 1794, before leaving for India. He did not vacate his seat before the dissolution, and later maintained an interest in Lincoln elections.<br>
<br>Hobart took over at Fort St George on 7 September 1794. His government began with a personally conducted expedition to Malacca which destroyed the Dutch settlements, but subsequent developments were less favourable to him. The death of Mohammed Ali, nawab of the Carnatic, soon after his arrival prompted Hobart to propose fiscal reforms there conducive to the relief of the oppressed peasantry. The new nawab opposed this policy by reference to a treaty of 1792 which had the assent of the former governor-general, Cornwallis. Recognizing this agreement as his chief obstacle, Hobart proposed, without consulting Sir John Shore, the current governor-general, to seize Tinnevelly as compensation for the nawab's debts to the East India Company. Shore objected to this as being contrary to treaty. After an appeal to the company's court of directors in London, the eventual decision went in favour of Shore, and Hobart's recall was ordered. Meanwhile Hobart had placed himself in similar jeopardy by extracting a surrender of territory from the raja of Tanjore in satisfaction of his debts to the company. Shore objected to this treaty as an exercise of <i>force majeure</i>, but this time the court of directors sided with Hobart. Shore was by his own admission better advised by Hobart when the latter refused to back Shore's projected expedition against Spanish Manila, and he ceased to regard Hobart as an unsuitable successor. This prospect, however, was marred by the arrival of the court of directors' order on the Carnatic appeal. Hobart, whose wife had died in Madras on 7 August 1796, left in August 1798, complimented on his services. Later he was credited with having laid the ground for the campaign against Tipu in Mysore. The company awarded him a pension of &pound;1500 a year in view of his disappointed expectation of the governor-generalship; he might have received more, but in May 1798, he had succeeded to his sinecure Irish clerkship for life. He also had hopes of a peerage, but failing this was summoned to the Lords in his father's barony of Hobart on 30 November 1798. In the Lords he supported Pitt's proposals for Irish union, assisting <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8459/', "William Eden, first Baron Auckland")</script>, in drawing up details. He remained hostile to an accompanying measure of Catholic relief, though he accepted a state subsidy for the Catholic clergy. On 1 June 1799 he married the daughter of Auckland and his wife, Eleanor Eliot, Eleanor Agnes Eden (1777&#150;1851), whom her father had intended to become Pitt's wife. They had no children, but Hobart's illegitimate son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8695/', "Sir Henry Ellis")</script>, was brought up in their household.<br>
<br>Suitable employment for Hobart had become problematic. He was considered as a possible envoy to Russia, but preferred domestic office, especially as neither the governor-general nor the East India Company board were prepared to reinstate him in India. In March 1801 Pitt's successor, Addington, gratified him by appointing him (as second choice) secretary for war, adding to his duties in July by transferring charge of the colonies to him from the Home Office. In August 1803 his circular curbing the proliferating volunteer militias was not well received, and when Pitt, whose consent to his accession to the cabinet in 1801 he had sought, returned to power in 1804 he lost his office and declined the compensatory captaincy of the yeomen of the guard. He was, however, immortalized in the naming of the new town of Hobart in Van Diemen's Land.<br>
<br>On 14 November 1804 Hobart succeeded his father in the earldom. In January 1805 he returned to office as chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster, as part of Addington's uneasy reconciliation with the premier; this gave him a cabinet seat again. In July, however, he resigned with his chief over Lord Melville's naval administration: he had hoped to succeed Melville to the Admiralty. He nevertheless visited Pitt on his deathbed. It was he who induced Addington, by then Lord Sidmouth, to adhere to the Grenville administration in January 1806, and he himself became joint postmaster-general, though without a seat in the cabinet, to his disappointment. Resident at this time at Derby House, St James's Square, of which his father had been a tenant, he was a member of White's Club from 1805. On the dismissal of Grenville in 1807 he was left without office until April 1812 when the new premier, Lord Liverpool, made him president of the Board of Control for India and, for two months only, chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster. On 9 April 1813 he vindicated the renewal of the East India Company charter in the Lords. He retained his presidency until his death on 4 February 1816 in Hamilton Place, London, which followed a fall from his horse in St James's Park some time before. He was buried at Nocton and succeeded in the title by his nephew George Robert Hobart, fifth earl of Buckinghamshire.<br>
