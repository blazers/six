<span class="headword">Tregellas,  Walter Hawken</span>  (1831&#150;1894), <span class="occ">writer</span>, born at Truro, Cornwall, on 10 July 1831, was the eldest son of John Tabois Tregellas (1792&#150;1863), merchant at Truro, purser of Cornish mines, and author of the popular <span class="italic">Cornish Tales</span> (1860). His mother was Anne (1801&#150;1867), second daughter of Richard Hawken. He was educated by his uncle, John Hawken, at Trevarth School, Gwennap, from 1838 to 1845, and from 1845 to 1847 at the grammar school of Truro.<br>
<br>Tregellas was fond of drawing from an early age, and won prizes as an artist at the Royal Cornwall Polytechnic Society at Falmouth between 1846 and 1848. He began his career as a draughtsman in the War Office on 10 July 1855, was promoted second draughtsman in February 1860, rose to be chief draughtsman in May 1866, and retained the post until August 1893. Tregellas married at Holy Trinity Church, Brompton, on 2 November 1861, Zo&euml; Wilson (<i>b</i>. 1840), third daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17126/', "Charles Lucas (1808&#150;1869)")</script> and his wife, Frances.<br>
<br>Tregellas was also a keen writer, publishing many works including <span class="italic">China, the Country, History and People</span> (1867) and <span class="italic">The Horse Guards Memoranda</span> (1880). His interest in military matters was further illustrated in his <span class="italic">Historical Sketch of the Defences of Malta</span>, printed for the Royal Engineers' Institute at Chatham in 1879, and in a similar study of the coastal defences of England, which was published in 1887, having originally appeared in the engineers' occasional papers series. He contributed several articles to the <span class="italic">Archaeological Journal</span> (1864&#150;6) and the <span class="italic">Journal of the Royal Institution of Cornwall</span> (1883, 1891). Many of his publications were inspired by his native county, including <span class="italic">Cornish Worthies</span> (1884) and his <span class="italic">Tourist Guide to Cornwall</span> (1878), which reached a seventh edition in 1895. He also wrote many of the articles on Cornish people in the first thirteen volumes of the <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span>. His principal work, a history of the Tower of London, was left unpublished after his death.<br>
<br>Tregellas died at Stanley House, Prince of Wales Terrace, Deal, on 28 May 1894, and was buried in Deal cemetery on 30 May. He had no children, and his wife survived him.<br>
