<span class="headword">Pembrey,  Marcus Seymour</span>  (1868&#150;1934), <span class="occ">physiologist</span>, was born at Oxford on 28 May 1868, the second son of John Crips Pembrey, a proof-reader in oriental languages at the Oxford University Press, and his wife, Annie Coster Tanner. He was educated at Oxford high school and from 1885 at Christ Church, Oxford, where he became a Fell exhibitioner in 1888 and graduated in natural science (physiology) in 1889. The award of the Radcliffe travelling fellowship in 1890 enabled him to visit the physiological laboratories at Kiel and W&uuml;rzburg. However, Sir Henry Acland influenced Pembrey towards a career in medicine. After qualifying in medicine in 1892 from University College Hospital, London, he became a demonstrator in physiology at Oxford under J. S. Burdon-Sanderson. In 1895 he qualified MD and was appointed lecturer in physiology at Charing Cross Hospital medical school. He vacated this post in 1900 for a similar position at Guy's Hospital medical school, becoming professor in 1920. Pembrey was elected FRS in 1922.<br>
<br>Pembrey's first research on the respiratory exchange of mammals was soon coupled with an investigation of the regulation of body temperature, and experiments on the developing chick and newly born mammals did much to explain the characteristic difference between warm- and cold-blooded animals. This led him to investigate the respiratory process in hibernating mammals, which resemble cold-blooded animals during their winter sleep. After serving from 1906 to 1909 on a War Office committee which inquired into the physiological effects of food, training, and clothing on the soldier, he devoted much attention to the problem of general physical fitness and to the effects of muscular exercise on respiration, circulation, body temperature, and the kidneys. Pembrey himself took part in some of the long experimental marches, carrying full military equipment.<br>
<br>Working in co-operation with the physicians at Guy's Hospital, Pembrey showed how the physiologist could help the clinician and, with a quick appreciation of the significance of the discoveries of J. S. Haldane, he made important observations on clinical cases of periodic or Cheyne&#150;Stokes breathing, on the respiratory phenomena associated with diabetes and cardiac disability, on changes of temperature resulting from lesions of the spinal cord, and on the elimination of water by the kidneys and skin. He contributed many papers to the <span class="italic">Journal of Physiology</span> and <span class="italic">Guy's Hospital Reports</span>; he edited <span class="italic">A Textbook on General Pathology</span> (1913) in collaboration with James Ritchie and was joint author of the textbooks <span class="italic">Physiological Action of Drugs</span> (1901) and <span class="italic">Practical Physiology</span> (1902). He was elected a member of the Physiological Society in 1893, and became treasurer in 1925.<br>
<br>Pembrey was a stimulating and original teacher, always ready to debate scientific problems, forthright in argument but never bitter. In 1895 he married Bessie Cecily Crake, daughter of Edward Ebenezer Crake, rector of Jevington, Sussex, and they had five sons and five daughters. He enjoyed country life and farmed on a small scale at his home in Sussex while working at Guy's, and on his retirement moved to a farm at Ramsden in Oxfordshire. Pembrey died unexpectedly in the Acland Nursing Home, Oxford, on 23 July 1934. He was survived by his wife.<br>
