<span class="headword">Purefoy,  William</span>  (<em>c.</em>1580&#150;1659), <span class="occ">politician and regicide</span>, was born at Caldecote, Warwickshire, the son of Francis Purefoy (<i>d</i>. 1613), and his wife, Eleanor, daughter of John Baskerville of Curdworth, Warwickshire. He was briefly at Emmanuel College, Cambridge, in 1598 and Gray's Inn in 1599; in 1622 he was granted leave to travel abroad for three years.<br>
<br>The Purefoys were a long-established family from the Warwickshire&#150;Leicestershire border with branches also in Lincolnshire and Berkshire; kinsmen still co-operated over political and financial affairs in the seventeenth century. The marriage of William's grandfather to an heir of the Wigstons of Wolston, Warwickshire, had added to the family's status and wealth, while his aunt Magdalen Purefoy (1572/3&#150;1653) was the wife of Anthony Grey, earl of Kent (1556/7&#150;1643). The Purefoys of Caldecote were none the less on the fringes of the county &eacute;lite; William served as sheriff of Warwickshire in 1630&#150;31 and was an active justice of the peace from 1632. He was added to the quorum only in 1649, however, by which time he was among the most influential politicians in England.<br>
<br>William Purefoy was a consistent and early opponent of Charles I's policies. He was summoned before the privy council for his refusal of the forced loan in February 1627, and his election, in a disputed contest, to the parliament of 1628 as member for the nearby city of Coventry was attributed by some newsletter writers to his status as a loan refuser. In 1630 he gave the defiant answer &#145;that he believeth himself not legally liable to be fined&#146;  (TNA: PRO, E 178/7154/186) to the commissioners for distraint of knighthood, but he paid up in the following year (during his shrievalty). Purefoy was already close to Robert Greville, second Lord Brooke (and was indeed credited by some with an undue influence on the younger man) and a patron of godly clergy in Warwickshire, especially Richard Vines, rector of Caldecote and the adjacent parish of Weddington. Through Brooke Purefoy was elected as MP for Warwick in both the Short and the Long parliaments, having failed to become knight of the shire. He was an active and determined opponent of the personal rule. He argued for the removal of popish commanders from the English army, and in a famous and stormy session on 15 December 1641 moved that the grand remonstrance be printed, &#145;that so we might satisfy the whole kingdom&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Journal of Sir Symonds D'Ewes</span>, ed. W. H. Coates, New Haven, 1942, 294&#150;5).<br>
<br>From the start of the civil war Purefoy worked tirelessly to defeat the royalists, both as a military leader and administrator in Warwickshire and as a conscientious MP in Westminster. With Brooke he raised troops in the summer of 1642 under the authority of parliament's militia ordinance; the two men were indicted at the Warwickshire assizes by a royalist gentleman for opposing the king's commission of array. Purefoy had married, in 1609, Joan, the daughter of Aleyn Penkeston and widow of George Abbott&#151;both minor Yorkshire gentlemen. There were apparently no children of the Purefoy marriage, but her son George Abbott the younger was a close political associate of his stepfather in Warwickshire's civil war administration. Joan Purefoy was a plucky woman, praised in the London press in the autumn of 1642 for defending Caldecote from Prince Rupert's forces.<br>
<br>Purefoy held command in the association army of Staffordshire and Warwickshire under Lord Brooke in 1642&#150;3; when these forces were dispersed on their commander's death Purefoy was commissioned by the earl of Essex as colonel of a regiment of cavalry to be raised in Warwickshire. Despite his advanced age, Purefoy did see some military service in 1643&#150;4, contributing to the relief of Gloucester, and for the rest of his life was known as Colonel Purefoy. More broadly, however, he cemented a position as the archetypal &#145;county boss&#146;, with a tight political and administrative hold on Warwickshire parliamentarianism. He was named to every parliamentary committee established for Warwickshire from 1642 until 1659; throughout the 1640s his stepson Abbott, his cousin Gamaliel Purefoy, and three of the latter's sons were also prominent in Warwickshire's war effort. Purefoy's dominance was not popular with the more moderate, established county gentry, who in 1644 mobilized behind the attempt of Basil Feilding, second earl of Denbigh, to establish a military association independent of the Warwickshire county forces. An ally of the earl claimed Purefoy's &#145;estate being inconsiderable, his actions so harsh and resolutions so disconsonant to the welfare of the country that he hath wholly lost himself in his reputation there&#146;  (Parl. Arch., Main papers, 8 Nov 1644). None the less, Purefoy's national political connections and his military and financial dominance in Warwickshire sabotaged Denbigh's association, and he survived also the later challenges to his local administration by moderates on the local subcommittee of accounts.<br>
<br>Purefoy lost his military command with the self-denying ordinance and in the summer of 1645 he resided with the unpopular Scottish army while it was in the midlands. In parliament he supported a determined prosecution of the war and a stern peace settlement. He was hostile alike to &#145;prelacy&#146; and to sectarianism. He led local iconoclasm, tearing down Warwick's market cross and offensive monuments in the Beauchamp chapel in 1642; but unlike many of his closest associates he favoured a strict presbyterian church settlement. In October 1647, for example, he was on the opposite side to Cromwell as he attempted (unsuccessfully) to have a permanent presbyterian settlement written in to the peace propositions to be sent to the king.<br>
<br>In January 1649 Purefoy was named to the commission to try Charles I and signed the death warrant with no apparent hesitation, but he was clearly unhappy about the military purge of the Commons and the abolition of the House of Lords [<i>see also </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/70599/', "Regicides")</script>]. It was as an indefatigable MP during the Rump or Commonwealth regime (1649&#150;53) that Purefoy reached the apex of his political power. He served on the council of state throughout and was on all the important committees of the Rump, particularly concerned with religious affairs. Purefoy was predictably opposed to the dissolution of the Rump and to Cromwell's assumption of rule as a &#145;single person&#146;, but he was not an irreconcilable enemy of the protectorate. He continued to be active in local government and as member for Coventry in the first protectorate parliament he acquiesced in the demand that all MPs recognize Cromwell's authority. Purefoy's close links with Coventry were emphasized when he turned down the more prestigious Warwickshire county seat, to which he had also been elected. He sat on several committees, including, characteristically, one charged with revising the religious liberty granted under the &#145;Instrument of government&#146; and enumerating &#145;damnable heresies&#146;  (<span class="italic">JHC</span>, 7.399).<br>
<br>Purefoy was also elected for Coventry in 1656 and protested, unsuccessfully, against the council of state's exclusion of republican MPs. He played a full role in the parliament himself, however, sitting on the crucial committee for privileges, a committee to reform alehouses, and the committee that oversaw the trial and punishment of the Quaker James Nayler. He turned up in a thin house on 25 December 1656 for a debate on the decimation tax and sat on several heavyweight committees concerned with the <span class="italic">Humble Petition and Advice</span>. Purefoy was clearly hostile to the offer of the crown to Cromwell, and his sympathies were vividly revealed when he was one of the few members willing to take the oath of the provocative Commonwealthman Arthur Hesilrige, who attempted to enter the Commons in January 1658 despite being nominated to the upper house by the protector.<br>
<br>Purefoy was elected yet again for Coventry for Richard Cromwell's parliament, but his health was clearly failing, as he was one of the elderly MPs excused at the end of a long debate on the &#145;other house&#146; in March 1659. His status as an elder statesman ensured his nomination to important committees such as that for elections. The old man rallied quickly to the restored Rump in May 1659, but he was not active after August when he made his will. His wife was dead by then and his lands were settled, apparently reluctantly, on his nephew and namesake who had married a distant relative, Dorothy, daughter of George Purefoy of Wadley, Berkshire. Those with whom Purefoy had the closest ties&#151;his trustees, executors, and witnesses to his will&#151;were all veterans of Warwickshire's civil-war administration, minor gentlemen and tradesmen of Coventry. The veteran parliamentarian and puritan trusted to &#145;be taken into those blessed mansions of everlasting happiness prepared for and predestined to the elect&#146;  (will). At the very end of his life William Purefoy kept Coventry secure during the scare of Sir George Booth's presbyterian&#150;royalist rising in the August in which he made his will, and died in Warwickshire shortly afterwards, spared the collapse of his political hopes in the restoration of Charles II. His unloved nephew seems to have recovered the estates confiscated for regicide.<br>
