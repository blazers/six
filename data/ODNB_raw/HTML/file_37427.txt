<span class="headword">Fowler, Sir  Henry</span>  (1870&#150;1938), <span class="occ">mechanical engineer and metallurgist</span>, was born in Port Street, Bengeworth, Evesham, Worcestershire, on 29 July 1870, the eldest son of Henry Fowler, cabinet-maker, upholsterer, and house agent, and his wife, Mary Hughes. He was educated at Evesham grammar school and, from 1885 to 1887, at Mason Science College, Birmingham, where he gained the junior engineering diploma. From then until 1891 he was apprenticed under John Aspinall, chief mechanical engineer of the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway at its Horwich works near Bolton.<br>
<br>In 1891 Fowler gained the first Whitworth exhibition awarded to a member of the Horwich Mechanics' Institute. He then became assistant to George Hughes, chief of the testing department, whom he later succeeded. This enabled him to pursue his appreciation and devotion to metallurgy, which had been first inspired by his mechanical engineering studies at Mason College. In 1895 he married Emma Needham Smith (1870&#150;1934), daughter of Philip Smith. They had two sons and one daughter.<br>
<br>In the same year as his marriage Fowler became a gas engineer and in 1900 transferred to a similar post on the Midland Railway at Derby, where he became assistant works manager in 1905, works manager in 1907, and chief mechanical engineer in 1909. He made a major contribution to production methods in the railway's workshops and to the use of improved metallurgy, in locomotive and rolling-stock construction, as well as being an advocate of the use of super-heated steam and compound expansion to increase locomotive power and efficiency.<br>
<br>Shortly after the outbreak of the First World War in 1914, Fowler became secretary to the railway munitions committee and the following year was appointed director of production at the Ministry of Munitions. He became superintendent of the Royal Aircraft Factory at Farnborough in 1916 and also assistant director of aircraft production in 1917. In 1918&#150;19 he was chairman of the inter-allied conference on standardization of aircraft components and deputy member of the Munitions Council. For his wartime work he was appointed CBE in 1917 and KBE in 1918.<br>
<br>Three years after Fowler's return to railway work he became deputy chief mechanical engineer of the newly formed London, Midland, and Scottish Railway (LMS) in 1923 and two years later succeeded George Hughes as chief mechanical engineer. The task of integrating the locomotive, carriage, and wagon design, and the building and repair activities of six important former companies with their own individual practices was extremely difficult. Fowler inaugurated the introduction of line production in locomotive repairs, greatly reducing time spent in workshops, and a firm standardization programme to reduce, as rapidly as possible, the 393 individual locomotive types inherited by the LMS. By 1926 new, and much more powerful, express passenger and freight locomotive designs had been prepared to his directions and, while these were nullified by opposition within a divided management structure, in 1927 the Royal Scot express locomotives were introduced for principal main-line services. In 1931 Fowler was appointed scientific and research adviser to Sir Harold Hartley, vice-president of the LMS and director of research.<br>
<br>Fowler was a man of great energy and enthusiasm and pursued his wide interests in many fields of engineering with great vigour. He took a keen and sympathetic interest in the education of young engineers and was a member of the governing body of the Midland Institute at Derby. He was awarded an honorary LLD by Birmingham University and an honorary DSc by Manchester. He was president of the Institution of Locomotive Engineers in 1912, the Institution of Automobile Engineers in 1921, section G of the British Association in 1923, the Institution of Mechanical Engineers in 1926&#150;7, and the Institute of Metals in 1932&#150;3. From 1925 he was also a member of the permanent commission of the International Railway Congress Association, in which he played a very active part, and a member of council of the Institution of Civil Engineers from 1928 to 1934.<br>
<br>Sir Henry Fowler died at his home, Spondon Hall, Spondon, Derbyshire, on 16 October 1938, and was buried at Nottingham Road cemetery, Derby.<br>
