<span class="headword">Rattee,  James</span>  (1820&#150;1855), <span class="occ">woodcarver and mason</span>, was born at Fundenhall, Norfolk. Of his parents, nothing is known. He was apprenticed to a carpenter and joiner of Norwich, named Ollett. He became interested in ecclesiastical art, frequenting the cathedral and other churches in the city and its neighbourhood; at his request his employer taught him carving, in which he soon demonstrated a remarkable skill. In 1842 he left Norwich and went into business as a woodcarver in Sidney Street, Cambridge. His talent was recognized by the Cambridge Camden Society which employed him on the famous restoration of Holy Sepulchre Church (the Round Church) in Cambridge (1841&#150;3), under the direction of Anthony Salvin. The continuing patronage of members of the society enabled him to expand his business and in 1850 he established large-scale workshops, with steam-powered plant, on the Hills Road, Cambridge.<br>
<br>Rattee worked with A. W. N. Pugin in restoring the choir of Jesus College chapel (1846&#150;9); some of the design work was carried out by Rattee and submitted to Pugin before execution. In the choir of Ely Cathedral, beginning <i>c</i>.1850, he carried out the designs of George Gilbert Scott, and his work on the oak screen, stalls, organ-case, and restored tomb of Bishop William de Luda (<i>d</i>. 1298) was of the highest quality. In 1852 he was sent abroad for his health and travelled in Belgium and Germany, studying the work of such medieval artists as Quinten Metsys (1466&#150;1530). On his return he was commissioned to construct an elaborate new reredos at Ely Cathedral to Scott's design, incorporating carved alabaster and inlaid work. His work, on a more modest scale, is found in numerous churches in Cambridgeshire and across the country, with examples abroad as far away as Newfoundland Cathedral.<br>
<br>Rattee died at his house in Hills Road, Cambridge, on 29 March 1855, and was buried on 6 April in the cemetery in Mill Road. He had no children, but his widow, Caroline, kept an interest in his business which, renamed Rattee and Kett, continued under the direction of another Norfolk woodcarver, George Kett (1809&#150;1872), and his descendants until it was sold in 1926.<br>
