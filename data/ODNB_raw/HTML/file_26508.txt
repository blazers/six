<span class="headword">Stewart, Sir  Robert Prescott</span>  (1825&#150;1894), <span class="occ">organist and composer</span>, born at Dublin on 16 December 1825, was the son of Charles F. Stewart, a librarian of the King's Inns, Dublin. He received his musical education in the school attached to Christ Church, Dublin, of which church he became organist in 1844. He was also appointed in the same year organist to Trinity College, Dublin, and in 1852 to St Patrick's Cathedral, where he also was a vicar-choral. In 1846 he married Mary Anne, the daughter of Peter Browne of Rahurs, Castlebar. Also in 1846 he became conductor of the Dublin University Choral Society, which presented him with his robes and a jewelled baton when he graduated DMus in 1851. Ten years later he became professor of music at Dublin University. In 1872 Stewart declined an invitation to represent Ireland at the peace festival at Boston, USA. In the same year he became professor of theory at the Royal Irish Academy of Music, and was knighted by Earl Spencer. In 1873 he was appointed conductor of the Dublin Philharmonic. After his first wife died, on 7 August 1887, Stewart married, on 9 August 1888, Marie, the daughter of Joseph Wheeler of Westlands, Queenstown.<br>
<br>Stewart was a remarkable organist and extemporizer, while his memory is said to have been phenomenal. His compositions, many of which gained prizes, were numerous, the most popular being his glees and church music. He wrote various odes, for the opening of the Cork exhibition (1852), the Birmingham festival (1870), the Boston peace festival (1872), and the tercentenary festival of Trinity College, Dublin (1892). The list of his published works includes a number of cantatas, songs, and organ music. Stewart delivered many series of lectures on subjects ranging from Bach and Handel to musical styles, lyrical drama, and Irish music, including one on bagpipes, on which he was an acknowledged authority. He instituted the requirement for candidates for musical degrees at Dublin to pass a literary test, an example followed some years later at Oxford and Cambridge. He was also editor of the <span class="italic">Irish Church Hymnal</span> (1876), and a contributor to Sir George Grove's <span class="italic">Dictionary of Music and Musicians</span> (1879&#150;89). At the time of his death he was vice-president of the Royal Academy of Music as well as of the Royal College of Organists. He died at his residence in Upper Fitzwilliam Street, Dublin, suddenly but peacefully, on 24 March 1894. A statue was erected in his memory on Leinster Lawn, Dublin.<br>
