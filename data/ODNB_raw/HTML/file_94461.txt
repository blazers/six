<span class="headword">Best,  Richard</span>  (1916&#150;2004), <span class="occ">film editor</span>, was born Augustus Percy Best on 28 June 1916 at Sandford, Ferens Avenue, Hull, Yorkshire, the son of George Augustus Blakeney Best, a wholesale provision merchant then serving as a private in the 10th battalion of the East Yorkshire regiment, and his wife, Vera, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Bantoft. He attended a dame school in Acton, west London, and St Paul's School, London. He was fascinated by the cinema from an early age and found a way into the industry through the approach of his mother to J. Arthur Rank, the Rank family having been neighbours of hers in Hull as a child. He began as a lowly assistant in the cutting rooms at the British and Dominions Film Corporation, and later worked on the editing team of David Lean for the production of <span class="italic">As You Like It</span> (1936), before graduating to editing assistant on low budget films produced by Anthony Havelock-Allan at Pinewood. Best recalled this hectic and exciting period as the most enjoyable of his career.<br>
<br>On 3 September 1939, the day that Britain declared war on Germany, Best married, at Ruislip parish church, Margaret Charcella Warren (<i>b</i>. 1914), secretary, and daughter of Samuel Higgs Warren, accountant. Best was called up in 1940, when he joined the Royal Berkshire regiment, but found a more suitable role back at Pinewood with the army film unit, which he joined in 1942. There he worked on numerous training and documentary films, most importantly on the acclaimed <span class="italic">Desert Victory</span> (1943), which enjoyed great success in America and won the Oscar for best documentary film, and <span class="italic">Burma Victory</span> (1945), his first collaborations with the director Roy Boulting. Both films were decidedly cinematic, with Best ably cutting to Boulting's vision, as in the celebrated &#145;gun flash montage&#146; of <span class="italic">Desert Victory</span>, the dynamic sequence that heralds Montgomery's break-through at Alamein. Following the war Best edited three of the Boulting brothers' feature films. <span class="italic">Fame is the Spur</span> (1947), an adaptation of the Howard Spring novel, was not a commercial success, but was distinguished by an impressive visual design for which Best offered able dramatic support. He created considerable tension in the sequence of the striking miners storming a pithead, with the fluid movement of the body of men through the narrow cobbled streets punctuated with closer shots of angry and anxious faces. Best had the highest regard for the Boultings and made significant contributions to <span class="italic">The Guinea Pig</span> (1948) and <span class="italic">The Magic Box</span> (1951). The latter&#151;the industry's official contribution to the Festival of Britain&#151;was a biography of the cinema pioneer William Friese-Greene, and required the editor to contend with a complicated flashback structure.<br>
<br>On the recommendation of John Boulting, Best joined ABPC Studios at Elstree and stayed there for eighteen years and thirty-three films. He wisely requested to join the production of <span class="italic">The Dam Busters</span> (1954), which became a huge commercial success and a classic of the war film genre. Best's editing skilfully kept the story moving forward and integrated the different lines of development: the invention narrative of Barnes Wallis; the training of the aircrews under Guy Gibson; and the final raid. While the film was quite stately and matter of fact in approach&#151;there were a large number of scenes played in a single master shot&#151;Best countered this static quality through &#145;shock&#146; cuts to the following scene, thus imposing a forward-moving dynamic to the narrative. The extended raid sequence proved a masterclass in film editing: though played without any music, it achieved a remarkable tension through expert cutting between each of the three raiding parties and the officers anxiously waiting on events back at base.<br>
<br>Best developed a close working relationship with the stylish director J. Lee Thompson on six features during the 1950s. They first worked together on <span class="italic">The Yellow Balloon</span> (1953), a technically proficient crime film, but had greater critical and commercial success with <span class="italic">Yield to the Night</span> (1956), a controversial drama about capital punishment produced a year after the Ruth Ellis affair. The brilliant skills of Thompson, Best, and the cinematographer Gilbert Taylor were evident in the acclaimed pre-credit sequence, a three-minute montage of disquieting angles, reflected images, and disembodying close-ups as the protagonist&#151;marvellously realized by Diana Dors in her first serious dramatic role&#151;stalks her victim. Best and Taylor made significant contributions to the social dramas <span class="italic">Woman in a Dressing Gown</span> (1957) and <span class="italic">No Trees in the Street</span> (1959), but the outstanding film of the period was the ground-breaking war film <span class="italic">Ice Cold in Alex</span> (1958). Unconventionally, the film depicted a British officer, nerves shattered by war, struggling to bring an ambulance and crew through the desert to Alexandria. Best responded brilliantly to the opportunity for cranking up the tension and executed a series of classic set pieces: the nerve-wracking journey through the mine field; the desperate attempts to pull a colleague out of quicksand; and the laborious and painful efforts to manhandle the truck up a sand dune. It was the film Best was most proud of. He worked with Thompson again on <span class="italic">The Most Dangerous Man in the World</span> (1969), a highly unsatisfying experience marred by interference from the American Fox company.<br>
<br>Best had little sympathy for the innovations or politics of the &#145;new wave&#146; in the late 1950s. He detested working on Tony Richardson's adaptation of <span class="italic">Look Back in Anger</span> (1959) and largely ruled himself out of some of the more interesting directions British cinema took in the 1960s. Instead he found himself working on low-grade comedies like <span class="italic">Go to Blazes</span> (1962), vapid international productions such as <span class="italic">The Double Man</span> (1967), and derivative horrors including <span class="italic">Psychomania</span> (1971). One high spot in this period of mediocrity was his work on the prestigious television series <span class="italic">The Avengers</span>, for which he edited fourteen episodes in 1965&#150;66. He ended his career in the early 1980s at British Transport Films, back in documentary film-making.<br>
<br>Best's first marriage ended in divorce, and on 2 June 1956, at Harrow register office, he married (Mabel) Noreen Ackland (<i>b</i>. 1921), also an editor, who had a long professional association with the film-maker Michael Powell. She was the daughter of William Henry Ackland, driving instructor. He died at his home, 39 The Greenway, Ickenham, Uxbridge, Middlesex, on 19 December 2004 following a heart attack, and was survived by his wife and two children (a son and a daughter).<br>
