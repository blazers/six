<span class="headword">Love,  David</span>  (1750&#150;1827), <span class="occ">pedlar and poet</span>, was born at Torriburn (Torryburn) on the north shore of the Firth of Forth in Fife, Scotland, on 17 November 1750 and baptized in nearby Culross on 2 January 1751. His parents were Anne, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Robertson (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1773), and her husband, William Love (1696&#150;1788), a work-shy, hard-drinking coalminer, who had two sons and three daughters by a previous marriage. Another son, John, was baptized at Culross on 22 June 1752, soon after which William abandoned his family and Anne lost her sight and became a wandering beggar.<br>
<br>David had a year's schooling to the age of nine, probably in Culross, then worked as an errand boy and farmer's boy, and spent a year driving ponies underground in the earl of Dundonald's coalmines at Culross, where his arm was broken; he kept a village school for five months, but from an early age his chief occupation was selling tracts and small books as a pedlar.<br>
<br>About 1775, having accumulated &pound;3, Love married Mary Thomson (<i>c</i>.1755&#150;1806), with whom he had five sons and a daughter in eight years. They kept a shop in a village near Falkirk, but when they ran into debt Love resumed his itinerant bookselling as a &#145;flying-stationer&#146;  (<span class="italic">Life, Adventures</span>, 31) and began to print, sing, and sell satirical ballads, &#145;godly poems for Christians of all denominations&#146;, and other verse of his own composition. He advertised himself as &#145;a lame man, who makes verse on any subject, if employed&#146;  (Love, <span class="italic">A Few Remarks</span>, title-page). Sadly, the verse is also lame.<br>
<br>Love served for about four years (probably 1778&#150;82) in the duke of Buccleuch's regiment of fencibles before resuming his pedlar's and balladeer's trade, which he now extended into England. If his wife was as shrewish as he claimed  (<span class="italic">Life, Adventures</span>, 36&#150;7) this may have been because she was obliged to leave their children with her sister in Scotland and unwillingly take to the road with her husband. They travelled over much of England, with settled spells in London and Bristol, where Love met his aged father, now a reformed pedlar of religious books, and they spent nearly a year in Gosport, Hampshire, where there was good trade among sailors just returned from Earl Howe's victory on 1 June 1794. Love experienced religious conversion at Newbury, Berkshire, on 17 April 1796, and thereafter celebrated that date as a new birth, but he had been writing and publishing religious verse from the 1770s.<br>
<br>Mary Love died in November 1806. On 20 July 1807, at Duffield, Derbyshire, Love married Mary Falconer, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Thomson, aged about forty-nine and widow of an artilleryman. She died in March 1809. Both wives were buried at Rugby, Warwickshire: the first on 26 November 1806, the second on 17 March 1809.<br>
<br>Love married his third wife, Elizabeth Laming (<i>c</i>.1775&#150;1853), a silk spinner, on 21 May 1810 at Nottingham and they had five children together, the last when David was nearly seventy. Nottingham now became their chief home, though they still sometimes tramped as pedlars and were persuaded by the poor-law overseers to travel to Edinburgh in 1812 and later to London: Love published his prose account of the second trip in <span class="italic">David Love's Journey to London and his Return to Nottingham</span> (<i>c</i>.1814). A stay in Nottingham workhouse as well as occasional imprisonment in other towns for vagrancy and a spell on the treadmill in Hull at the age of seventy-five provided further material for Love's rough, comic, topical ballads. Nicknamed Old Glory, singing his own hymns and ballads, composing acrostics on demand, selling haberdashery as well as books, and proclaiming his evangelical faith, Love became a familiar figure in Nottingham, and very popular &#145;considering his extreme lack of talent&#146;  (Sutton, 18).<br>
<br>Love undertook to publish his autobiography by penny numbers at least three times. Incomplete sets of a chapbook version in stanzaic verse (n.d.) and of a different broadside version in octosyllabic couplets (<i>c</i>.1818) survive, as do complete sets of <span class="italic">The Life, Adventures, and Experiences of David Love, Written by himself</span> in twenty-four numbers (1814&#150;23). This largely prose autobiography thriftily incorporated his stanzaic <span class="italic">Life</span> as well as many other poems, and ran to a fifth edition (1825). Some copies contain an engraved portrait of the author, aged seventy-four.<br>
<br>Love remained active to within a few weeks of death. He died in Nottingham on 12 June 1827 and was buried on 14 June in St Mary's churchyard.<blockquote>In person David was below the middle stature; his features were not unhandsome for an old man; his walk was exceedingly slow, deliberately placing one foot before the other, in order perhaps to give his customers time to hear what he had got; his voice was clear, and strongly marked with the Scotch accent. He possessed a readiness of wit and repartee. (Hone, 3, col. 179)</blockquote>
