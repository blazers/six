<span class="headword">Peake,  Thomas</span>  (1771?&#150;1837), <span class="occ">barrister and law reporter</span>, was the only son of Thomas Peake of Lleweni, Denbighshire, and his wife, Martha, daughter of Robert Coventry. His father, who practised as an attorney at Lincoln's Inn, held office as a side-clerk in the exchequer office of pleas between 1792 and about 1801. Peake was admitted to Lincoln's Inn as a student on 13 February 1788 and was called to the bar on 6 February 1796. His practice included work as a special pleader. He was a member of the Oxford circuit and of Worcester and Stafford sessions.<br>
<br>In 1795 Peake published a collection of annotated reports of <i>nisi prius</i> cases in the court of king's bench covering the period 1790&#150;94. Three editions of this popular work were produced, the last in 1820. The chief justice, Lord Tenterden, commended Peake's reports as being &#145;remarkably correct&#146;. He added, &#145;I went the same circuit and was in the habit of taking notes. On many occasions I have compared the cases, and I know his to be particularly accurate&#146;  (Manning).<br>
<br>In 1801 Peake published <span class="italic">A Compendium of the Law of Evidence</span>. His aim, declared in the preface, was to produce a book &#145;which should be a companion on the circuit; always at hand, and ready for immediate reference&#146;. Five editions in all appeared between 1801 and 1822. The popularity of the <span class="italic">Compendium</span> was not confined to practitioners. It won praise even from Jeremy Bentham, the radical critic of English law, who applauded the clear dividing line drawn between principles of evidence on the one hand and, on the other, rules of law governing proof in relation to particular causes of action. With characteristic robustness Bentham declared that existing works dealing with evidence by Lord Chief Baron Gilbert and Sir Francis Buller were, in comparison with Peake's work, &#145;like the drivelings [<i>sic</i>] of an old woman in her dotage&#146;  (Bentham, 7.341). The <span class="italic">Compendium</span> was also popular in America, where several editions appeared in the early decades of the nineteenth century.<br>
<br>On 21 January 1800 Peake married Eleanor (1773&#150;1866), daughter and heir of James Budgen, an alderman of the City of London. There were five sons and three daughters of the marriage. The eldest son, Hugh Budgen Peake (<i>b</i>. 1803), was called to the bar by the Middle Temple and practised at Worcester. The second son, Thomas Peake jun. (1805&#150;1837), was called to the bar by Lincoln's Inn. He produced in 1829 a compilation, with his own annotations, of additional cases recorded by his father between 1795 and 1812.<br>
<br>In February 1820 Peake was created a serjeant-at-law. He died of heart disease on 17 November 1837 at Chalfont St Peter, Buckinghamshire, and was buried at Kensal Green cemetery. An armorial window and a brass to his memory were placed at Henllan church, Denbighshire.<br>
