<span class="headword">Livesay,  Richard</span>  (1750&#150;1826), <span class="occ">painter and engraver</span>, was born on 8 December 1750. Of his parents, nothing is known. He entered the Royal Academy Schools on 21 March 1774, as a draughtsman. He exhibited for the first time at the Royal Academy in 1776. Between 1777 and 1785 he lodged with William Hogarth's widow in Leicester Fields, and executed for her a series of facsimiles of drawings by Hogarth, among them the seven illustrating the well-known tour, <span class="italic">An account of what seemed most remarkable in the five days' peregrination of the following five persons, viz. Messieurs Tothall, Scott, Hogarth, Thornhill and F. Begun on Saturday, May 27, 1732, and finished on the 31st of the same month</span>, by E. F. (Ebenezer Forrest), published in 1782. He also made engravings after Hogarth's paintings. He was engaged by Benjamin West, of whom he was a pupil, to copy pictures at Windsor Castle. Livesay went to reside there about 1790, and gave lessons in drawing to some of the royal children. While at Windsor he executed many portraits of young Etonians, generally small whole-lengths, many of which were exhibited at the Royal Academy. His large unfinished picture of <span class="italic">Eton Boys Going to Montem</span> hangs in Eton College.<br>
<br>Livesay exhibited sixty-nine pictures in total at the Royal Academy between 1776 and 1821. On 8 October 1793, Joseph Farington recorded Livesay as being one of the candidates for the election of two associates. In 1796 he was appointed drawing-master to the Royal Naval Academy (later College) at Portsmouth and so moved to Portsea. On an address card which he issued at that time he described himself as &#145;Portrait, Landscape, and Marine Painter, Drawing-Master to the Royal Academy, Portsmouth, 61 Hanover Street, Portsea.&#146; He painted some of the English warships and their French prizes, and in 1800 published a set of four plates of the reviews of the Isle of Wight Volunteers, aquatinted by Wells. Archibald noted his &#145;impressive picture of a review of the Worcestershire Regiment with a background of Portsmouth harbour and shipping&#146;  (Archibald, 148). Livesay's large picture <span class="italic">The Grand Review of Troops at Hatfield by King George III on June 13, 1800</span>, is in the collection at Hatfield House. It was engraved by J. C. Stadler. He also made engravings after marine subjects. His portrait of James Caulfeild, first earl of Charlemont, is in the National Portrait Gallery, London. Several of Livesay's portraits have been engraved. Livesay was succeeded at the Royal Naval College in 1811 by John Schetky and then returned to London. He was in Winchester in 1821 but when he wrote his will in January 1826 he was resident in Bath. He died at Southsea, Hampshire, in November 1826. The sole legatee, his nephew John Livesay of Penny Street, Portsmouth, renounced his claim when it became apparent that his uncle's debts were likely to exceed his assets.<br>
