<span class="headword">Bobart,  Jacob, the younger</span>  (1641&#150;1719), <span class="occ">botanist</span>, was born in Oxford on 2 August 1641, the elder of the two sons of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2741/', "Jacob Bobart the elder (c.1599&#150;1680)")</script> and his first wife, Mary (<i>d</i>. 1655). After a schooling which imparted a graceful literary style but a poor command of Latin he worked under his father in the Oxford Physic Garden until the age of nearly forty. Though Thomas Baskerville may merely have been referring to their respective sizes in saying the son was but a shrimp compared to the father, the forceful personality suggested by the father's portrait could have produced a diffident son.<br>
<br>In contrast to the elder Bobart, who remained essentially a gardener, the younger displayed more scholarly inclinations. At about the age of twenty he started a personal herbarium, which grew to fill twelve folio volumes with some 2000 named specimens, most presumably from the garden; although not documented further, it is of lasting value for tracing the history of old horticultural varieties. A record contributed to Merret's <span class="italic">Pinax</span> (1666) shows that he was also studying the local wild flora by then, to such effect that he impressed John Ray by producing from his herbarium a British species new to Ray. A short list of his finds in Ray's 1691 <span class="italic">Synopsis</span> includes four plants new to Britain and shows that, besides extensive fieldwork around Oxford, he had ranged as far as Somerset. He also botanized in the Netherlands, Flanders, and the Jura before his marriage to Anna (<i>d</i>. 1718), about 1673.<br>
<br>On his father's death in 1680 Bobart succeeded him as superintendent. Only three years later he lost his scientific mentor too, with the untimely death of the professor of botany, Robert Morison, in an accident, and was asked to take over the latter's lecturing. This caused many of his contemporaries to assume he had also succeeded to Morison's post, but that was precluded by his never being a member of the university. The elevation nevertheless led to his contributing to the proceedings of the Philosophical Society of Oxford and, more important, to being entrusted by the University Press with the editing and completion of Morison's <span class="italic">Plantarum historiae universalis Oxoniensis</span>, of which only the second of three projected parts had been published. Bobart necessarily had to neglect his garden work for much of the thirteen years this massive undertaking took. The first part proved irretrievable, but with much help from William Dale of Queen's College he substantially wrote <span class="italic">Pars tertia</span>&#151;as it is traditionally known&#151;and greatly extended it to include very many plants unknown to Morison, in the research for which he was much assisted by the young William Sherard. External events, however, led the press to lose interest for five years and, demoralized, Bobart talked about leaving Oxford for a position elsewhere, preferably at Chelsea. Fortunately at that point, in 1691, the project was revived and concluded, but Bobart's key role was not adequately acknowledged and for a century afterwards botanical authors denied him the credit he deserved.<br>
<br>Bobart published nothing further in his lifetime, reserving his energies for manual work in the garden and further enrichment of its collections by exchanging seeds, plants, and dried specimens with a wide range of fellow enthusiasts, especially with Petiver, with whom he was on particularly friendly terms. Hence, expecting a fellow learned gentleman, Zacharias von Uffenbach was shocked, on paying a visit in 1710, to find a <i>praefectus horti</i> not at all as he had imagined. Instead, he was confronted with:<blockquote>an unusually pointed and very long nose, small eyes deeply set in his head, a wry mouth with scarcely any upper lip, a large and deep scar on one cheek, and his whole face and hands as black and coarse as those of the meanest gardener or labourer,</blockquote>dressed in clothes that were &#145;very bad&#146;  (<span class="italic">Merkw&uuml;rdige Reisen</span>, 3, 1754, 163).<br>
<br>In 1717 illness caused Bobart to place the garden temporarily in the care of his brother, Tilleman, who substantially exceeded its approved budget. The vice-chancellor declared the university would rather have no garden than pay as much as &pound;100 a year for its upkeep, and Bobart was required to resign as a result. His family and friends denounced this as callous, but he was allowed to stay on in the Garden House. Only a few months later, though, on 28 December 1719, he died. He was buried two or three days later in the church of St Peter-in-the-East, Oxford, alongside his parents and his wife of forty-five years, who predeceased him by just over a year. His personal stock of plants, seeds, and tools, extensive library, papers, and the two herbaria he had formed (one, the so-called &#145;Morisonian herbarium&#146;, designed to illustrate the <span class="italic">Historia</span>) were left to the university; he also bequeathed a field for the use of the poor of the parish. A year later his twelve-page <span class="italic">Historiae naturalis sciographia</span>, of high interest as the sole complete exposition of Morison's classificatory system, was published anonymously. Apart from the genus <i>Bobartia</i>, which Linnaeus named in honour of father and son jointly, he is commemorated in a colour form of the knotted figwort, <i>Scrophularia nodosa</i>.<br>
