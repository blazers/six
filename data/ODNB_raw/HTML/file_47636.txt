<span class="headword">Lee,  Peter</span>  (1864&#150;1935), <span class="occ">trade unionist</span>, was born on 20 July 1864 in a house in Duff Heap Row, Fivehouses, Trimdon Grange, in the Durham coalfield. His father, Thomas Lee, was also a miner but his mother, Hannah (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Simpson), was an educated woman, whose grandfather had been a schoolmaster and whose father had worked as a mill foreman in Lancashire. The Lee family moved frequently between Lancashire and Durham during Lee's early years, which may have accounted for a restlessness which seemed to be a part of the character of the young man. It certainly prevented regular attendance at school.<br>
<br>By the age of nine Lee was working as a piecer in a cotton mill and had a succession of jobs in the brickyards after this before going down the pit as a pony driver at Littletown colliery, Sherburn Hill, back in Durham. He was only ten. At thirteen he was putting, bringing the tubs back and forth from face to shaft, and by sixteen and a half had joined his father and older brother as a hewer of the coal. This hard and dangerous work was often reflected in the lifestyles of the men who did it, rough, drinking, gambling, and fighting men, whose social life centred on the pub. Even union meetings were held there when they were held at all. Lee built a reputation for hardness and had occasional confrontations with the police. His life remained nomadic as he moved around the northern coalfields looking for better places and better pay. He later calculated that he had worked in fifteen different pits between 1879 and 1886, some more than once.<br>
<br>In 1885 Lee thought to go to Australia, where silver had been discovered, but could not arrange an assisted passage. Instead, at the beginning of 1886 he went to the coal mines of Pennsylvania where an uncle was already working. He stayed about a year and also worked underground in Indiana and Kentucky. A mixture of homesickness and disillusionment propelled him back to Durham in 1887.<br>
<br>The experience, however, boosted Lee's confidence. He had occasionally acted as spokesman for the men in disputes with the management, and back in Durham at Wingate colliery he went to union meetings and was elected delegate to the council of the Durham Miners' Association (DMA). Neither his reading nor his writing were good, but in other respects he was a noticeable figure. In a world of small workmen he was 6 feet 1&frac12; inches tall, with long black hair and grey eyes. He spoke clearly without an accent, probably through the influence of his mother who had read to her young family on winter evenings.<br>
<br>Lee also returned from America to marry Alice Thompson, a young dressmaker, whom he had known since they were children. She was religious and the marriage was celebrated at the Wesleyan church in Haswell on 29 February 1888. As Lee himself said much later, &#145;she took a great risk when she first threw in her lot with me. You should have seen me then&#151;a man in the rough, with no education and a drunkard&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>). They lived with her parents for the first six weeks as Lee had been sacked, circumstances that emphasize the insecurity of working-class life. They had a son and three daughters.<br>
<br>Marriage brought some physical as well as temperamental stability, but after nearly four years as checkweighman at Wingate, Lee left his wife and young family in 1896 to work in the goldmines of South Africa. He returned after eighteen months, resuming work in the Durham pits and becoming checkweighman at Wheatley Hill in 1902. In many respects he was a changed man. He had improved his education during the nineties and his love of books later led to the conversion of one room in his home into a library. He gave up drinking and smoking and became a Methodist preacher. He was active in the union, though apart from two short spells on the executive it was 1919 before he was elected an agent of the miners. He soon became financial secretary of the DMA and in 1924 the executive and joint committee secretary. After the sudden death of W. P. Richardson he was appointed general secretary of the DMA in 1930, at the age of sixty-six. He was vice-president of the Miners' Federation of Great Britain and president the following year.<br>
<br>Lee came to trade union leadership late in life. In 1914, aged fifty, he was little known in the industrial and political world of Durham, but had already begun his work as a reformer in local government, notably in the fields of housing, roads, sanitation, and water supplies; and it was in those areas that he did most to improve the living standards of Durham people. He was chairman of Wheatley Hill parish council in 1903 and elected to Easington rural district council in 1907, later becoming chairman there too. His biographer noted the great attention to detail which buttressed his success. He kept a notebook for the parish council, the rural district council, and the Co-op, and one each for the young men's classes he taught, his public speaking, and preaching. In 1909 he was elected to the Durham county council, one of fewer than a dozen workers' representatives, and he was the obvious chairman when Labour won its first ever majority on a county council there in 1919. He sat continuously until 1932, serving two terms as chairman. In spite of the depressed state of the coal trade in inter-war Britain, Lee presided over improvements in the health of Durham people including falling infant mortality and death rates. Two most appropriate memorials to his work were the Burnhope Reservoir and the new town of Peterlee, which was named after him in 1954.<br>
<br>Lee died at his home, Bede Rest, in the city of Durham, on 16 June 1935 after a long illness. He was survived by his wife and children. He was buried in the cemetery at Wheatley Hill, which his own efforts had done much to provide.<br>
