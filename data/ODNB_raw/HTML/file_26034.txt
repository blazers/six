<span class="headword">Sorocold,  Thomas</span>  (1561/2&#150;1617), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, was born in Lancashire. Of his parents it is known only that his father survived him and must therefore have lived to a very great age indeed. Sorocold may have been related to Ralph Sorocold, a wealthy merchant of Manchester, and have come under the tutorship of Oliver Carter, fellow and subdean of Manchester collegiate church. On 10 December 1579 the executors of the will of Philip Nowell, the educational benefactor, provided 10<i>s</i>. for &#145;Thomas Sorrocold, scholare of Manchester, commended by certen gentlemen and Mr Carter&#146;  (Grosart, 2.170). Sorocold matriculated on 18 July 1580, aged eighteen, from Brasenose College, Oxford, graduating BA on 6 February 1583 and MA on 8 July 1585. After his ordination he returned to Lancashire and became a preacher there; among his more illustrious hearers was the earl of Derby, at his chapel at Lathom House in July 1587. On 22 October 1590 Sorocold was instituted to the rectory of St Mildred Poultry in London. On 4 August 1592 he was granted a licence to marry Susan, daughter of Richard Smith, a grocer of St Benet Sherehog, with whom he had a daughter, also named Susan, baptized on 12 March 1597. Susan Sorocold was buried in the chancel of St Mildred's on 16 March 1605.<br>
<br>The work for which Sorocold is chiefly remembered is his <span class="italic">Supplications of Saints</span>, a devotional aid containing a meditation on Christ's life, death, and passion, aimed at a wide audience. Registered with the Stationers' Company in 1608, it went through nearly fifty editions by 1723; in the third edition of 1617, dedicated to Prince Charles, Sorocold recalled that Princess Elizabeth, before going with her husband to the Palatinate in 1613, had consented to sponsor the work. In his will, dated 7 December 1617, Sorocold requested that he be buried as near as possible to &#145;my deceased wife&#146; Susan. To Elizabeth, his wife at the time of his death, he bequeathed a little house and garden &#145;neer the Moorefeildes in the suburbs of London&#146;  (LMA, DL/C/360/Thomas Sorocold, X19/5, fol. 313), while her son Thomas Methwold received a gold piece. Sorocold's interest in property in Salford, near Manchester, where his father was still living, went to his daughter Susan. Sorocold was buried at St Mildred Poultry on 12 December 1617.<br>
