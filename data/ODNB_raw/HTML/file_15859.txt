<span class="headword">Lacy,  Michael Rophino</span>  (1795&#150;1867), <span class="occ">violinist</span>, was born on 19 July 1795 at Bilbao in Spain. His father was an Irish merchant, his mother Spanish. He began learning the violin at the age of five, and when he was six made his public d&eacute;but at a concert given in Bilbao by Andreossi, an Italian violinist, playing a concerto by Giovanni Giornovichi. It is said that he was so small that he had to stand up on a table before the audience could see him, but the performance was very well received. As an infant prodigy he was patronized by the court of Madrid until 1802, in which year he commenced his schooling at Bordeaux. After eighteen months there he proceeded (in 1803) to a <i>lyc&eacute;e</i> in Paris to finish his education. While in Paris he was a pupil of Rodolphe Kreutzer, under whom he made rapid progress, and towards the end of 1804, as &#145;le petit Espagnol&#146;, he played a violin solo before Napoleon at the Tuileries.<br>
<br>Meanwhile, his father had been ruined by some American speculations, and Lacy was brought to England at the end of October 1805 to study under Giovanni Battista Viotti. On the journey he played in various Dutch towns, and became a great favourite in The Hague. It is reported that, at the time of arriving in England, when he was ten years and three months, he was able to speak fluent English, French, Italian, and Spanish, and had a fair knowledge of Latin. He was at first known merely as &#145;the young Spaniard&#146;, for his real name was not publicly revealed in England until May 1807, when an engraved portrait of him by Cardon (from a drawing by Smart) was published. Among his patrons were the prince of Wales, the duke of Sussex, the duchess of York, and Count Stahremberg, the Austrian ambassador. His first concert in London was given at the Hanover Square Rooms, and soon afterwards he played at Angelica Catalani's first concert in Dublin, during a visit to Ireland of Michael Kelly's opera company. On this occasion his patrons were the lord lieutenant, the duke of Richmond, and his wife. Performances at Natale Corri's concerts in Edinburgh followed, for which he received the large fee of 20 guineas per night.<br>
<br>In obedience to his father's will, Lacy subsequently abandoned the musical for the theatrical profession, and for about ten years (1808&#150;18) filled &#145;genteel comedy parts&#146; in Edinburgh, Dublin, and Glasgow, playing the violin in public only at his benefits. In 1818, at the invitation of the directors, he succeeded Felix Yaniewicz as leader and director of the Liverpool concerts, the musicians for which were recruited from the best talent in London. At the end of 1820 Lacy returned to London and became leader of the ballet orchestra at the King's Theatre, where he is said to have directed the ballets and composed most of the ballet music for the Italian opera. However, in 1823, following disagreements with the musical director, he returned to the management of the Liverpool concerts, though he resumed his position at the King's Theatre in 1824.<br>
<br>For the rest of his professional life Lacy employed his musical and linguistic skills principally in the adaptation of foreign librettos for the English stage, as well as translating several French plays and arranging the music of well-known French and Italian operas. It was Lacy who made the first English adaptations of several of Rossini's operas, including <span class="italic">Semiramide</span> (first performed at Covent Garden, 7 March 1829) and <span class="italic">La Cenerentola</span> (Cinderella; Covent Garden, 13 April 1830). Contemporary conventions allowed a great deal of artistic licence to be exercised, and Lacy often used music from different operas in a single adaptation. For example, <span class="italic">Cinderella</span> includes music from Rossini's <span class="italic">Maometto II</span>, <span class="italic">Armida</span>, and <span class="italic">Guillaume Tell</span>, while the &#145;dramatic oratorio&#146; <span class="italic">The Israelites in Egypt</span> (Covent Garden, 22 February 1833) is a pasticcio combining Handel's <span class="italic">Israel in Egypt</span> and Rossini's <span class="italic">Mos&egrave; in Egitto</span>. Other adaptations include music from operas by Mozart, Auber, Meyerbeer, and Weber. Lacy also arranged favourite airs for beginners to play in public (1826). Among his compositions are a set of three rondos for the piano, a quintet for two violins, viola, flute, and cello with piano accompaniment, numerous fantasies on operatic themes (mainly for piano), and songs. He assisted with the research for Victor Schoelcher's biography of Handel during the 1850s. Lacy died at Pentonville, London, on 20 September 1867.<br>
