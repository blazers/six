<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Donoghue,  Stephen</span>  (1884&#150;1945), <span class="occ">jockey and racehorse trainer</span>, was born on 8 November 1884 at Aikin Street, Warrington, Lancashire, the eldest son in the family of three sons and two daughters of Patrick Donoghue (1862&#150;1936), an iron puddler at the steel-wire works of Pearson and Knowles, and his wife, Mary Mitchell (<i>d</i>. 1936). He attended St Mary's Roman Catholic School, Buttermarket Street, Warrington, from the age of six until he was twelve, when he started work half-time in his father's works. In 1899, aged fourteen, he walked from Warrington to Chester races to secure employment in the Kingsclere stables of the famous trainer John Porter. Within four months, however, homesickness took him back to a job in a Warrington wireworks. Then, fearing he had killed a bully in a fight, Donoghue fled with his younger brother to the Middleham stables of Dobson Peacock, a leading northern trainer. However, the two had given assumed names and left in 1901 with the arrival of census officials, this time travelling to Newmarket, where Steve (as he was always called) joined the stables of Alfred Sadler junior.<br>
<br>In 1903 Donoghue went to France where he gained experience of race riding and won for the first time, on Hanoi at Hy&egrave;res in April 1905. Two years later he went to ride for Philip Behan's stable in Ireland, and became the leading Irish jockey. He married Bridget Behan, the daughter of his employer, in 1908. In 1910 he was retained by H. S. &#145;Atty&#146; Persse at Stockbridge, Hampshire, to replace the American Danny Maher, who was suffering from tuberculosis; by 1914 Donoghue had won the first of ten consecutive champion jockey titles. Rejected as unfit for military service, he rode two wartime Derby winners (at Newmarket), in 1915 and 1917. He spent a season in South Africa, after his return from where, in November 1917, his marriage was dissolved following his wife's adultery while he was there; there were two sons of the marriage, Stevie and Patrick (who had a brief riding career), and a daughter, Kathleen. During his visit to South Africa, Donoghue himself began a long affair with Lady Torrington, the actress Eleanor Souray (<i>c</i>.1882&#150;1931). Together they trained her horses and enjoyed a high social life. She divorced her husband, the ninth Viscount Torrington, in 1921.<br>
<br>Donoghue developed a reputation for having other riders &#145;jocked off&#146; mounts in major races and was no respecter of his own contracts if he fancied the chances of another owner's horses. Although this enabled him to win four out of five Derbys between 1921 and 1925 (he won six Derbys in all), ultimately it cost him the chance of retainers later in his career as no owner or trainer would trust him to honour his obligations. After 1925 he rode no more classic winners until he piloted Exhibitionist to victory in the 1937 Oaks and One Thousand Guineas. At the end of that season he retired to become a trainer at Blewbury, though only with modest success. He also did some broadcasting and appeared in several films. Donoghue was a fearless jockey with great tactical skill, soft hands, and perfect balance, though never as strong in a finish after an accident in the 1925 grand prix de Paris in which he dislocated and fractured his left shoulder. Two horses are indelibly associated with him: at the start of his career he rode &#145;the spotted wonder&#146;, the unbeaten Tetrarch, and later he piloted Brown Jack to six consecutive wins in the Queen Alexandra stakes (1929&#150;34).<br>
<br>During the 1928 racing season Donoghue rode 108 consecutive losers. Worse was to follow. By then his relationship with Lady Torrington had become unhappy, not least because of financial problems due to their improvident living. In September a bankruptcy petition showed that he had debts estimated at &pound;15,000 and assets of less than &pound;600. His generosity to friends accounted for some of the problem but primarily it was due to illegal (for a jockey) and unsuccessful betting. Eventually he was rescued by a retainer from Sir Victor Sassoon and a decision by his creditors, early in 1929, to accept 5<i>s</i>. in the pound. At the start of the 1929 season, on 17 March, Donoghue secretly married Ethel Finn (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1896), an American dancer. On 9 December 1931, following bankruptcy proceedings, Lady Torrington took her own life by gassing herself; a suicide verdict was returned. Donoghue's family disapproved of his 1929 marriage, which ended in separation in 1934. In April 1940 Ethel sued for arrears of maintenance payments but Donoghue showed that he had helped her on numerous occasions and her demand for &pound;946 was reduced to &pound;312. She died in February 1942 from an overdose of sleeping tablets; a verdict of misadventure was recorded.<br>
<br>Donoghue himself died suddenly of a heart attack at 24 Porchester Gate, Paddington, on 23 March 1945, during a visit to the capital. He died intestate which meant that the mementoes of his career had to be sold. His son Pat bought the Manchester cup won by Steve in 1922 and the portrait of his father in the royal colours by Sir James Lavery. Donoghue was buried on 29 March 1945 in Warrington cemetery, where a memorial stone was erected. In 1957 a pair of gates dedicated to his memory was placed at the entrance to the Epsom grandstand.<br>
