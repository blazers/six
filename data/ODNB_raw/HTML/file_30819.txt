<span class="headword">Birch,  (Evelyn) Nigel Chetwode</span>, Baron Rhyl  (1906&#150;1981), <span class="occ">economist and politician</span>, was born in London on 18 November 1906, one of two sons (there were no daughters) of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/31892/', "General Sir (James Frederick) Noel Birch (1865&#150;1939)")</script> GBE KCB KCMG and his wife, Florence Hyacinthe (1876&#150;1938), the daughter of Sir George Chetwode, sixth baronet, and sister of Field Marshal Lord Chetwode. Educated at Eton College, he became a partner in the stockbroking firm of Cohen Laming Hoare. A skilful operator, especially in the gilt-edged market, he acquired at an early age a sufficient fortune to assure him independence. He joined the Territorial Army (King's Royal Rifle Corps) before 1939 and served in the Second World War on the general staff in Britain and the Mediterranean theatre, attaining the rank of lieutenant-colonel in 1944.<br>
<br>Birch was elected to parliament for Flintshire in 1945 and quickly made a formidable reputation on the Conservative opposition benches for his mordantly witty interventions and speeches, and for his advocacy of strictly honest public finance and his critique of the prevalent Keynesian trend. He married on 1 August 1950 Esm&eacute; Consuelo Helen (<i>b</i>. 1908) OBE, daughter of Frederic Glyn, fourth Baron Wolverton. There were no children. On forming his government, in November 1951 Winston Churchill appointed Birch&#151;some believed as a result of mistaken identity&#151;not, as was expected, to a financial post but as parliamentary under-secretary at the Air Ministry and subsequently at the Ministry of Defence (from the end of February 1952).<br>
<br>Birch attained ministerial rank in October 1954 as minister of works where he enjoyed, as he said, &#145;gardening with a staff of three thousand&#146; and deserved to be remembered for his insistence upon retaining the trees in Park Lane when it was widened. He served in the government of Sir Anthony Eden as secretary of state for air from December 1955; but the first appointment in his special field came only when Harold Macmillan made him economic secretary to the Treasury&#151;technically a demotion&#151;in January 1957.<br>
<br>Birch supported and encouraged the chancellor of the exchequer, Peter Thorneycroft, in evolving a theory of inflation which was the recognizable forerunner of the monetarism of later decades, and when Thorneycroft failed to obtain from his cabinet colleagues the restraint in public expenditure he considered essential, Birch joined him and the financial secretary (J. Enoch Powell) in the triple resignation on 6 January 1958 which Macmillan, in a jaunty phrase which became famous, dismissed as &#145;a little local difficulty&#146;.<br>
<br>Though he never held office again, Birch exercised great influence on economic and financial questions and continued to castigate what he regarded as the lax and inflationary proclivities of Macmillan's government. When Macmillan was about to be toppled by the scandal of the &#145;Profumo affair&#146;, Birch demanded his resignation in a philippic long famous for its closing phrase from Robert Browning's &#145;The Lost Leader&#146;, &#145;Never glad confident morning again&#146;, which went down in parliamentary memory along with his exclamation to a full house on the announcement of Hugh Dalton's resignation: &#145;They've shot our fox!&#146; The failing eyesight which increasingly inhibited Birch's other activities did not interfere with his stream of contributions to economic debate, which, though meticulously prepared, were invariably delivered without a note.<br>
<br>Birch, who once accused the Treasury of &#145;the reckless courage of a mouse at bay&#146;, was representative of a distinctive element in the House of Commons after the Second World War. He combined with personal courage, independence, and integrity an understanding of public finance and economic affairs acquired and perfected in the practical life of the City. He was appointed OBE in 1945 and sworn of the privy council in 1955.<br>
<br>Having continued from 1950 to represent West Flint, where he resided at Saithailwyd (&#145;Seven Hearths&#146;), near Holywell, Birch went to the House of Lords in 1970 as a life peer, Baron Rhyl. He died on 8 March 1981 at Holywell House, Swanmore, Hampshire.<br>
