<span class="headword">Mendoza y R&iacute;os,  Joseph  de</span>  (1761&#150;1816), <span class="occ">astronomer</span>, born in Seville, Spain, on 29 January 1761, was the son of Joseph-Ygancio de Mendoza and his wife, Mar&iacute;a-Romana Morillo y R&iacute;os. He later added the prestigious name R&iacute;os of his maternal grandmother to that of his father&#151;a common practice at the time. He was educated at the Royal College of San Isidro, Madrid, where he showed a remarkable aptitude for mathematics, and then joined the army as a cadet in the Royal regiment of dragoons. However, he soon requested to be transferred to the navy, which was a much more attractive place from the point of view of astronomy and mathematics. The transfer became effective on 16 March 1776. In August 1779, while returning from Manila, his ship, the <i>Santa In&eacute;s</i>, engaged in combat with two English cruisers; Mendoza R&iacute;os was taken prisoner to Cork, where he arrived in early September. He was released one year later, and returned to Cadiz in September 1780.<br>
<br>Other naval postings and promotions followed. During this period Mendoza R&iacute;os wrote a treatise on navigation, which in early 1787 he submitted to the navy minister, <i>teniente general de la armada</i> Baylio Fray Antonio Vald&eacute;s, a man dedicated to the modernization of the Spanish navy; he recommended its publication. Mendoza R&iacute;os, released from duties at sea because of ill health, was sent to Madrid to oversee its printing. After his two-volume treatise was published, in late 1787, he was promoted to <i>capitan de fragata</i>. Thus he began a second career, as a scientist, in areas of naval interest.<br>
<br>Back in Cadiz, Mendoza R&iacute;os submitted a proposal for an institute for the sciences of navigation, including a cartographic depot, to be located at the naval headquarters near Cadiz. His ideas were accepted and the king set aside a large sum of money for it. The intention was to collect, or copy, maps and documents held by former officers and members of the nobility in Spain, for which task Mendoza R&iacute;os suggested a young naval officer, Martin Fern&aacute;ndez de Navarrete. Another purpose was to acquire, from other European locations, maps and charts and books and instruments relevant to navigation, and to report on recent scientific and industrial advances. Mendoza R&iacute;os undertook this aspect. He left Spain in October 1789, accompanied by another young naval officer, Jos&eacute; Mar&iacute;a de Lanz.<br>
<br>Through the publication of his treatise on navigation, Mendoza R&iacute;os's name became known in scientific circles in Europe; Sir Joseph Banks was his correspondent in London, and in Paris he became acquainted with some of the leading scientists of the time. He took a serious interest in the use of new materials (precious stones and newly available metals, such as platinum) in the design and improvement of a variety of scientific instruments. Some of the instruments he designed or improved were sent to Malaspina to be used by the scientists attached to his expedition. At the time of his stay in Paris, French scientists were considering the construction of a large telescope to emulate Herschel's achievements in England. Mendoza R&iacute;os advocated testing platinum for the mirror of the projected French telescope; the matter was discussed by a committee which included Lavoisier. He was elected foreign correspondent to the French Academy of Sciences on 4 August 1792.<br>
<br>As the political situation became more unstable in Paris and the telescope project collapsed, Mendoza R&iacute;os moved to the safety of London. In 1792 he visited a number of industrial establishments in England and wrote detailed confidential reports on them. On account of his contributions to nautical astronomy he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society on 11 April 1793.<br>
<br>In 1796 Mendoza R&iacute;os sent to Spain, from London, a large and valuable collection of maps, charts, and scientific and geographic books. In the same year he opened negotiations for one of Herschel's large telescopes. However, once installed in Madrid, this instrument, then the second largest in Europe, was not used to its full potential. Mendoza R&iacute;os made his home in England, where he married Anna Maria Parker on 8 November 1798. They had two daughters, Francisca and Anna Fermina (<i>b</i>. 1799); the latter married in 1829 Sir Patrick Bellew (1798&#150;1866), afterwards Lord Bellew of Barmeath Castle, Dunleer, co. Louth, Ireland.<br>
<br>From the 1790s Mendoza R&iacute;os was in the forefront of those who sought to modernize a wide range of activities in the Spanish Navy, such as chronometry, precision mechanics, optics, and numerical calculation. Through his acquaintance with the best instrument makers he was able to place young Spanish apprentices in their workshops, even having one of them instructed in precious stone cutting, a very secretive craft. He also played an important role in the introduction into Spain of modern lighthouse techniques.<br>
<br>Mendoza R&iacute;os was interested in the use of mathematical tables as aids to nautical astronomy. Soon after his arrival in London he proposed the publication of such a collection of tables. In 1797 he contributed to the <span class="italic">Philosophical Transactions</span> of the Royal Society an important paper on the central problems of nautical astronomy. He succeeded in simplifying mathematical calculations considerably, reducing them to the reading of a few entries in a set of pre-calculated, compact, and easy-to-use auxiliary tables. In the design of these tables he displayed a great deal of mathematical ingenuity. For their construction he used several &#145;computers&#146; working in parallel, each person doing a simple and repetitive task. In 1801 he published, again in <span class="italic">Philosophical Transactions</span>, a full description of his reflecting circle, an improvement of Borda's circle. After lengthy discussions Mendoza R&iacute;os obtained funds to publish his tables, enabling him to reduce their price and make them widely available. He also persuaded Portugal, Russia, and other foreign powers to buy copies. From the early 1800s his various tables were reprinted a large number of times and published in several languages; the last editions were made in the first decades of the twentieth century. A copy of Mendoza R&iacute;os's paper is depicted in a portrait of his close friend Joseph Banks, commissioned by the Spaniard in 1807; a copy of the portrait (1815, also by Thomas Phillips) was requested by the Royal Society and now hangs behind the president's chair in the society's council room.<br>
<br>In September 1796 Mendoza R&iacute;os requested permission to retire from the Spanish Navy. No action was taken then, but in May 1800 the king of Spain decided to remove his name from the navy list, probably, although not explicitly stated, because he had not returned to Spain when his country was at war with England. However, the navy and the Spanish court continued to consult him on naval matters until the end of his life.<br>
<br>Mendoza R&iacute;os had always suffered from ill health; there were frequent references to his health in his correspondence (even in his scientific works) throughout his life, and these became more insistent and obsessive towards the end of it, when he commuted between his London and Brighton homes. He died on 4 March 1816 as a result of hanging himself in his country home, in New Steine, Brighton. The coroner's report stated that &#145;being a lunatic he hanged himself&#146;. On 11 March Mendoza R&iacute;os was buried in the church of St Nicholas, Brighton. He left, when he died, a considerable amount of money in trust for his wife and daughters. He is probably the mathematician and astronomer of Spanish origin who has received the widest international recognition for his scientific work. However, secondary literature on him is rare and, while respecting his achievements, often hostile to his personality.<br>
