<span class="headword">Radclyffe,  William</span>  (1783&#150;1855), <span class="occ">engraver</span>, was born on 20 October 1783 at Birmingham, and was self-educated. Nothing is known of his parents, but he was a relative of John Pye (1782&#150;1874), and both were apprenticed to W. Tolley, a writing engraver, of 17 New Meeting Street, Birmingham. They also attended drawing classes under J. V. Barber (1788&#150;1838). At the end of their indentures in 1801 Radclyffe and Pye decided to try their fortunes in London, where Pye's brother was already working. However, Radclyffe's resources ran out, and he returned from Stratford upon Avon, leaving Pye to go on alone. On 30 October 1804 Radclyffe married Elizabeth Hemming at Aston Juxta, Cheshire. He was probably the William Radcliffe, engraver, at Gough Street, Birmingham, in 1810, but William Radclyffe was an engraver and copperplate printer by 1814 at 21 Edmund Street, and in 1817 he had taken in Thomas Radclyffe (possibly a younger brother, whose major work was engraving forty-seven plates for William West's <span class="italic">Picturesque Views &hellip; in Staffordshire and Shropshire</span>, 1830&#150;31). During this period J. T. Willmore and S. Fisher were taken on as pupils, and Joseph Goodyear, Thomas Jeavons, and Thomas Garner were his assistants.<br>
<br>Among Radclyffe's earliest important engravings was a portrait of Bishop Milner after Barber, followed by a portrait of Lord Nelson in 1805. Both demonstrated his technical abilities. He engraved some plates for Oliver Goldsmith's <span class="italic">Animated Nature</span> (1813), thus attracting the attention of Charles Heath, which later resulted in commissions for London publications. Six plates after J. Roe were done for <span class="italic">A Historical &hellip; Account of &hellip; Warwickshire</span> (1815), and for John Britton's <span class="italic">History &hellip; of &hellip; the Cathedral Church of Norwich</span> (1816) he engraved Plate 2 after Frederick Mackenzie. Four plates of Kenilworth Castle were exhibited at W. B. Cooke's exhibition of engravings in London in 1821. Radclyffe used steel-engraving from about 1823, notably for thirty-two plates for A. Blair's <span class="italic">Graphic Illustrations of Warwickshire</span> (1823&#150;9), after Barber, David Cox, William Westall, and Peter DeWint. This was followed by fifty plates for <span class="italic">Jones' Views of the Seats of Noblemen and Gentlemen</span> (1829&#150;31), all after J. P. Neale. About 1825 Radclyffe expanded the printing and engraving business and moved his residence to George Street, Edgbaston, leaving the joint business at 18 Edmund Street and 34 New Street, Birmingham. His reputation as a landscape engraver was enhanced by the ninety-seven plates done for Thomas Roscoe's <span class="italic">Wanderings and Excursions in North Wales and &hellip; South Wales</span> (1836), for which David Cox the elder was originally intended to provide all the drawings, since Radclyffe was almost alone in appreciating his talent. Wrightson and Webb the publishers, however, insisted that about half the total should be done by George Cattermole, Thomas Creswick, Copley Fielding, J. D. Harding, and others. He had worked earlier for Roscoe in his <span class="italic">Tourist</span> series (1832&#150;3), with four plates after Harding. He engraved four plates after J. M. W. Turner for <span class="italic">Turner's Annual Tours</span> (1833&#150;6), and George Virtue employed him from 1836 to 1840 for landscape plates in some of his works. From 1840 to 1855 he provided a series of plates for the <span class="italic">Oxford Almanack</span>, and in 1842&#150;3 he engraved five plates for <span class="italic">London Interiors</span>; he may have done six more signed only &#145;Radclyffe&#146;. His plates were usually signed &#145;W. Radclyffe&#146;, &#145;W. Radcliffe&#146; or &#145;W. Radcliff&#146;. <span class="italic">Prayer in the Desert</span>, after W. Muller, and <span class="italic">Crossing the Sands</span>, after William Collins, appeared in the <span class="italic">Art Union</span> in 1847&#150;8. Radclyffe did much to encourage the group of engravers emanating from and working in Birmingham and from 1814 took an active part in the promotion of the local artistic community, by whom he was much respected, culminating in 1842, when what is now the Royal Birmingham Society of Artists was formed. He was affectionately regarded by his many friends and pupils. His great skill in landscape engraving was well known nationally and enhanced the reputation of those associated with him. He died in Birmingham on 29 December 1855.<br>

<a name="cosubject_22995"></a><span class="headword">Edward Radclyffe</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1810, <em>d.</em> 1863), <span class="occ">engraver</span>, the eldest son of William Radclyffe, was baptized on 1 August 1810 at St Phillip's, Birmingham. Taught engraving by his father and drawing by J. V. Barber, he showed early promise by some etchings done at Hazlewood School in 1823, and in 1824 he was awarded the Society of Arts silver Isis medal presented by the duke of Sussex for an etching of animals. The following year he was given the society's silver palette for an engraving of cattle. At the end of his apprenticeship he moved to London about 1831, and immediately set up on his own. One of his earliest steel plates was for Roscoe's <span class="italic">Wanderings in &hellip; North Wales</span> (1836). He was primarily a landscape and figure engraver, and worked extensively for Charles Heath in <span class="italic">The Keepsake</span> (1836&#150;47), <span class="italic">Heath's Book of Beauty</span> (1839&#150;47), <span class="italic">Heath's Versailles</span> (1836), and <span class="italic">Heath's Picturesque Annuals</span>. By 1838 he was sufficiently well established to marry Maria, the daughter of Major Revell of Round Oak, Englefield Green, Surrey. He contributed often a single plate to George Virtue's and H. Fisher's topographical volumes, although he engraved seven plates for Christopher Wordsworth's <span class="italic">Greece</span> (1839), eleven for E. W. Brayley's <span class="italic">Topographical History of Surrey</span> (1841&#150;8), and nineteen for John D'Alton's <span class="italic">History of Drogheda</span> (1844). He engraved after contemporary artists, including Thomas Allom, W. H. Bartlett, Cattermole and Creswick. For the <span class="italic">Art Journal</span> he engraved seven plates published between 1848 and 1866, among them <span class="italic">The Homeward Bound</span> and <span class="italic">Morning on the Sea Coast</span>, both after F. R. Lee, and his last, <span class="italic">Hay Time</span>, after Cox. He engraved a number of plates after his brother <a href="#cosubject_67507">Charles [<i>see below</i>]</a>, eighteen of which were brought together in Robert Bell's compilation <span class="italic">Golden Leaves</span> (1863). He engraved views on Admiralty charts, of which <span class="italic">The Persian Gulf</span> was exhibited at the Paris Universal Exhibition of 1862. After 1859 he returned to etching for eleven designs after Cox, 300 sets of which were given as prizes by the Art Union of London in 1862. He began a <span class="italic">Liber Studiorum</span> of Cox's work, but completed only three before his death. These were published in 1876 by the Liverpool Art Club in connection with their Cox exhibition by the print publishers. Radclyffe used mezzotint especially for four plates after Cox, two of castles and two of Welsh scenery. He exhibited six engravings at the Royal Academy between 1859 and 1863. He died on 25 November 1863 at his home in Camden Town, London, and was buried in Highgate cemetery. His plates were variously signed, probably on account of mistakes by writing engravers; variants were &#145;E. Radcliffe&#146;, &#145;E. Ratcliffe&#146; and &#145;E. Ratclyffe&#146;.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_22996"></a><span class="headword">William Radclyffe junior</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1813, <em>d.</em> 1846), <span class="occ">painter</span>, was baptized on 21 January 1813 at St Phillip's, Birmingham, the second son of William Radclyffe. Although his mezzotint of <span class="italic">The Serenade</span>, after H. Liverseege, showed his promise as an engraver, he became a portrait painter and worked mainly in London. He exhibited two portraits at the Royal Academy and two still lifes at Suffolk Street. His portraits of David Cox (1830; National Portrait Gallery, London) and his elder brother Edward were quite highly regarded. He died in London on 11 April 1846 of paralysis.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_67507"></a><span class="headword">Charles Walter Radclyffe</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1817, <em>d.</em> 1903), <span class="occ">painter</span>, the youngest son of William Radclyffe, was baptized on 11 March 1817 at St Phillip's, Birmingham, in which city he lived all his life. He became a landscape painter and exhibited three paintings at the Royal Academy between 1849 and 1881. He also exhibited elsewhere in London, and <span class="italic">The Path through the Wood</span> is among his best work. Credited with lithographing some views of Rugby School about 1840, Radclyffe also proposed the exhibition of engravings of Birmingham men in 1877. In 1863 he lived at 268 Hagley Road, Birmingham. He died at King's Norton, Birmingham, in the first quarter of 1903, aged eighty-six.<br>
