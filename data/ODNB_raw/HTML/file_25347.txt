<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Sheppard,  Samuel</span>  (<em>c.</em>1624&#150;1655?), <span class="occ">writer</span>, was the son of Harman Sheppard, physician, who died on 12 July 1639, aged ninety, and of Petronella (Parnell) Sheppard, who died on 10 September 1650. His parents married at Christ Church, London, on 10 April 1623, and all historical records relating to Samuel Sheppard situate him in London and its environs. No record of his education survives, though he appears to have been a presbyterian minister; John Hackluyt, a rival writer, called Sheppard a &#145;blasphemous Cleargy-spot&#146;  (<span class="italic">Metropolitan Nuncio</span>, 3, 6&#150;13 June 1649, C.i.v). Sheppard's main activity, however, was as a writer, and from 1646 to 1654 he wrote copiously, in news weeklies, prose reports, essays, poetry, and drama, about the events of the civil war.<br>
<br>In <span class="italic">God and Mammon</span> (1646) and <span class="italic">The Yeare of Jubile</span> (1646), Sheppard supports Fairfax, Cromwell, and the parliamentarian reforms, but he also takes pains to represent King Charles as a noble man unfortunately surrounded by weak and corrupt counsellors, &#145;wicked <i>Incendiaries</i> &hellip; resident about the KING&#146;  (<span class="italic">God and Mammon</span>, title-page). In <span class="italic">The Famers Fam'd</span> (1646) and <span class="italic">The False Alarum</span> (1646) Sheppard attacks John Lilburne, and in <span class="italic">The Times Displayed in Six Sestyads</span> (1646), Sheppard's first large poetic work, he satirizes a wide variety of religious denominations and appends an account of the best and worst in English poetry up to the death of Francis Quarles.<br>
<br>Although Sheppard had hitherto supported parliamentarian reforms from a presbyterian standpoint, he was greatly alarmed at the imprisonment of the king in 1646, and his subsequent writings aimed to support Charles and preserve his life. <span class="italic">The Committee-Man Curried</span>, a play in two parts (1647), depicts parliamentarians as corrupt and hypocritical while allowing a modicum of dignity and moral worth to the royalist character, Loyalty. From 1647 to 1649 Sheppard was active in the writing and editing of underground royalist mercuries and news weeklies, such as <span class="italic">Mercurius Melancholicus</span>, <span class="italic">Mercurius Pragmaticus</span>, <span class="italic">Mercurius Elencticus</span>, <span class="italic">Mercurius Aulicus</span>, <span class="italic">Mercurius Dogmaticus</span>, the <span class="italic">Parliament Kite</span>, and the <span class="italic">Royall Diurnall</span>. From late 1647&#150;8 the newsbooks become openly hostile towards Fairfax and Cromwell, while Charles is idealized. In the context of bitter rivalry between news weeklies, persecution by parliamentary authorities, and the frequent imprisonment of editors and writers, Sheppard's activities cannot be determined precisely. The poet John Cleveland wrote <span class="italic">Mercurius Pragmaticus</span>, and Sheppard appears to have been connected with this journal at the outset  (<span class="italic">Metropolitan Nuncio</span>, 3, 6&#150;13 June 1649, C.i.v). In January 1648, probably while writing for <span class="italic">Mercurius Dogmaticus</span>, Sheppard was sought, and possibly imprisoned, by parliamentary authorities (<span class="italic">Mercurius Melancholicus</span>, 21, 15&#150;22 Jan 1648, 120; <span class="italic">Mercurius Anti-Mercurius</span>, 1, 12&#150;19 Sept 1648, 2&#150;3). The revival of <span class="italic">Mercurius Aulicus</span> from early February to mid May 1648 has been attributed to Sheppard, chiefly because these editions bear his personal motto, &#145;Quis me impune lacessit&#146;. In the spring of 1648 Sheppard became the chief writer of <span class="italic">Mercurius Elencticus</span> when its editor, George Wharton, was imprisoned  (<span class="italic">Mercurius Anti-Mercurius</span>, 1, 12&#150;19 Sept 1648, 1&#150;2). In June 1648 Sheppard was imprisoned in Petre House, Aldersgate Street  (<span class="italic">Mercurius Melancholicus</span>, 44, 19&#150;26 June 1648, 265), and by the end of July he was at liberty and contributing to the <span class="italic">Royall Diurnall</span> and possibly the <span class="italic">Parliament Kite</span> as well as a counterfeit version of <span class="italic">Mercurius Melancholicus</span> (<span class="italic">Mercurius Melancholicus</span>, 51, 7&#150;14 Aug 1648, title-page verso; the <span class="italic">Royall Diurnall</span>, 4, 14&#150;22 Aug 1648, D.i.v).<br>
<br>On 16 April 1649 a warrant was issued for the arrest of Sheppard and William Wright, identified as writer and printer respectively of <span class="italic">Mercurius Elencticus</span>  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1649&#150;50</i>, 529). Sheppard remained in prison until at least May 1650  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1650</i>, 143), by which time Charles had been executed and Sheppard's cause lost; John Thurloe, secretary of state, appears to have supported Sheppard's release  (Sheppard, <span class="italic">The Weepers</span>, 1652, 11). During this longest period of imprisonment, spent at Newgate and possibly also at Lollards' Tower, Lambeth, and again at Petre House, Sheppard completed his most interesting and ambitious work, <span class="italic">The Faerie King</span> (Sheppard, <span class="italic">Epigrams</span>, 1651, 6.16; &#145;Postscript&#146;, c.1654, to <span class="italic">Faerie King</span>). Unlike the preceding news weeklies, <span class="italic">The Faerie King</span>, existing in a single holograph MS (Bodl. Oxf., MS Rawl. Poet. 28) and unpublished until 1984, offers a richly ambivalent portrait of Charles and the nature of monarchy. The Spenserian title belies the originality and thoughtfulness of this verse epic.<br>
<br>After his release in 1650 Sheppard continued to publish in a variety of genres and managed to avoid further trouble with parliamentarian authorities: a prose romance, <span class="italic">Amandus and Sophronia</span> (1650); <span class="italic">The Joviall Crew</span> (1651), a play satirizing the ranters; <span class="italic">Epigrams Theological, Philosophical, and Romantick</span> (1651), which includes an epigram to Cromwell; <span class="italic">The Socratick Session</span> and <span class="italic">A Mausolean Monument</span>, both printed with <span class="italic">Epigrams</span> and the latter a tribute to his late parents, dedicated to his &#145;Kinsman&#146; Christopher Clapham of Beamsley, Yorkshire, and also mentioning his wife, Mary; <span class="italic">Discoveries</span> (1652); the commendatory poem in Thomas Manley's <span class="italic">Veni; vidi; vici</span> (1652), a panegyric to Cromwell; possibly <span class="italic">Mercurius Mastix</span> (1652), a diatribe against news weeklies; <span class="italic">The Weepers</span> (1652), a darkly bitter work matching the mood of <span class="italic">Mercurius Mastix</span> and <span class="italic">The Faerie King</span> and hinting at Sheppard's continued respect for the king; <span class="italic">Merlinus Anonymous</span> (1653), a mock almanac, and probably <span class="italic">Good-Ale Monopolized</span> (1654), a satire on Robert Tichborne, both works published under the anagrammatic pseudonym Raphael Desmus. The last reference to Sheppard (which suggests he was still alive at the time of writing) is in William Winstanley's <span class="italic">The Muses Cabinet</span>  (1655, 22), and he presumably died later in this year.<br>
