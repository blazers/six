<span class="headword">Pepys, Sir  Lucas</span>, first baronet  (1742&#150;1830), <span class="occ">physician</span>, son of William Pepys (<i>bap</i>. 1698, <i>d</i>. 1743), a banker, and his wife Hannah (<i>d</i>. 1761), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/56302/', "Dr Richard Russell")</script> of Brighton and widow of Alexander Weller, was born in London on 24 May 1742 and baptized at St Mary Woolnoth on 8 June. He was educated at Eton College and at Christ Church, Oxford, where he graduated BA on 9 May 1764. He then studied medicine at Edinburgh in 1765, and afterwards graduated at Oxford, MA on 13 May 1767, MB on 30 April 1770, and MD on 14 June 1774. Before his MB degree he obtained a licence to practise from the University of Oxford, took a house in London, and on 10 February 1769 was elected physician to the Middlesex Hospital, where he held office for seven years. In the summer months he practised in Brighton. On 30 October 1772 he married Jane Elizabeth Leslie (<i>d</i>. 1810), the widowed countess of Rothes, with whom he had two sons and a daughter.<br>
<br>Pepys was elected a fellow of the Royal College of Physicians on 30 September 1775, was censor in 1777, 1782, 1786, and 1796, treasurer from 1788 to 1798, and president from 1804 to 1810. In 1777 he was appointed physician-extraordinary to the king, and in 1792 physician-in-ordinary. He was created a baronet on 22 January 1784.<br>
<br>Pepys attended George III during his illness of 1788&#150;9, and in that of 1804. He was examined on the subject of the king's health by a committee of the House of Commons on 7 January 1789. He then thought it likely that the king would recover in time, and stated that he had observed signs of improvement. He attended two days a week at Kew, where the king was, from four in the afternoon until eleven the next morning, having a consultation often with either Sir George Baker or Richard Warren.<br>
<br>In 1794 Pepys was made physician-general to the army, and was president of an army medical board, on which it was his duty to nominate all the army physicians. When so many soldiers fell ill of fever at Walcheren, he was ordered to go there and report. When he declined, the board was abolished; but he was granted a pension. Pepys had a large practice, and became an active supporter of the National Vaccine Institution. He was punctual and assiduous as president of the College of Physicians. His only published work was the Latin preface to the <span class="italic">London Pharmacopoeia</span> of 1809.<br>
<br>After the death of his first wife in 1810, Pepys married Deborah (<i>d</i>. 1848), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/799/', "Dr Anthony Askew")</script>, on 29 June 1813. His house was in Park Street, Grosvenor Square, London, where he died on 17 June 1830. He was described by William Munk, as &#145;a person of great firmness and determination, somewhat dictatorial in his manner&#146;.<br>
