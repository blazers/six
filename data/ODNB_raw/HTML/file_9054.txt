<span class="headword">Fabyan,  Robert</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1513), <span class="occ">chronicler</span>, is said to have been born in London. The son of John and Agnes Fabyan, he had at least one brother, John, who is mentioned in his will. Several other Fabyans are also recorded in London about this time, including John (<i>fl</i>. 1439&#150;1477) and Stephen (<i>fl</i>. 1468&#150;1469), but it is unclear whether any of these were relatives. Robert married Elizabeth Pake, daughter and heir of Johannes Pake, draper, and his wife, Elizabeth Stokker, and through his wife inherited lands in Essex at Theydon Garnon, including a mansion called Halstedys. With her he had sixteen children, only six of whom survived him.<br>
<br>Robert Fabyan was made free in the Drapers' Company in 1476&#150;7, having been apprenticed to William Holme about 1470, and took up the livery a year later. He was elected renter warden of the company in 1485 and acted as auditor of the city's accounts in 1486 and 1487. Elected sheriff in 1493 on the nomination of the lord mayor, he became alderman of Farringdon Without about December 1494. In 1495&#150;6 he served as master of the Drapers' Company, and held this office again in 1501&#150;2. In 1496 he was assigned to petition the king regarding levies on English cloth exported to Flanders, while in 1497 Fabyan was appointed with John Brooke and John Warner to keep the gates of Ludgate and Newgate against the Cornish rebels, and to accompany the king to Woodstock afterwards. In 1498 he was an assessor of the fifteenth for the Scottish war. In 1503 he resigned from the office of alderman, claiming that he did not have the financial backing to take on the mayoralty&#151;it is recorded that on &#145;the xx<sup>th</sup> day of Julii &amp; feest of Seynt mergaret Robert Fabyan aldyrman that long beffore hadd labourid to be dyschargid, at that daye by auctoryte of a Court of aldyrmen was dysmyssid of that Charge&#146;  (<span class="italic">Great Chronicle</span>, 325). Since Fabyan, who was the executor of his father-in-law's will, was then involved in a dispute with another alderman, William Welbeck, over payment of the orphan's portion overdue to Welbeck's wife, it is possible that his retirement was the result of both financial and social embarrassment.<br>
<br>Although clearly a man at the forefront of civic affairs, respected by his peers and the king, Robert Fabyan is best known for the chronicle attributed to him, <span class="italic">The Newe Cronycles of England and Fraunce</span>, also known as Fabyan's chronicle. In the prologue to the work the author himself calls it the &#145;Concordance of Storyes&#146;, an indication of its uniqueness in presenting parallel histories of England and France. The chronicle exists in manuscript in two volumes, with Holkham Hall, MS 671, covering the period from Brutus to the death of Philip Augustus of France in 1223, and BL, Cotton MS Nero C.xi, continuing from 1223 to 1485. Like all London chronicle manuscripts, Holkham 671 and Cotton Nero C.xi are anonymous. Although these manuscripts are almost certainly not in Fabyan's hand, it is probable that the text was written or continued by Robert Fabyan. Stow states that Fabyan:<blockquote>gathered out of divers good Authors, as well Latin as French, a large Chronicle of England and of France, which he published in English, to his great Charges, for the Honour of this City, and common Utility of the whole Realm. (Stow, bk 1, 262)</blockquote>Fabyan was certainly conversant with French and Latin, and is recorded as borrowing a French chronicle from the Guildhall Library for an extended period of time.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">The Newe Cronycles</span> was first printed by Pynson in 1516, but was not attributed to Robert Fabyan until Rastell's edition in 1533, which was entitled <span class="italic">Fabyans Cronycle Newly Prynted</span>. In the following year, 1534, the court of aldermen agreed that a copy of &#145;Mr. fabyans cronycles&#146; should be held in the court. It would seem that the continuation to 1509 was also attributed to Fabyan. This is certainly the case in the 1548 Ipswich edition of John Bale's <span class="italic">Illustrium maioris Britanniae scriptorum &hellip; summarium</span>  (Bale, 209) where the chronicle and also the continuation are said to be Fabyan's work. John Stow attributes both <span class="italic">The Newe Cronycles</span> and the great chronicle  (London, Guildhall Library, MS 3313) to Robert Fabyan, sometimes confusing the manuscripts. This was easily done as the manuscripts of <span class="italic">The Newe Cronycles</span> and that of the great chronicle after 1439 are all written largely in the same hand, and contain some similar styles of lettering and decoration. As the writer of the great chronicle records that he was apprenticed to Thomas Coke, there has been some speculation that Robert Fabyan may have been initially apprenticed to Thomas Coke and later changed to William Holme. This is a simple way of supporting the attribution of this manuscript to Fabyan. Because the Drapers' Company registers have been destroyed it is not known when Fabyan's apprenticeship commenced and so this association can be neither confirmed nor denied. However, much internal evidence suggests that the extant manuscripts of both <span class="italic">The Newe Cronycles</span> and the great chronicle were all copied in the same workshop. Although the similarity of hand does not mean Fabyan wrote the great chronicle, it is evident that all three manuscripts were compiled by individuals with a thorough and personal knowledge of the administration of London. In the case of <span class="italic">The Newe Cronycles</span> this is consistent with Fabyan's status and interests. It is notable, too, that these texts were perceived by contemporaries as valuable resources.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">The Newe Cronycles</span> is written in seven parts, each celebrating a joy of the Virgin Mary. The first six books draw heavily on the <span class="italic">Brut</span> as the basis of the English history, and also cite numerous medieval sources including Bede, William of Malmesbury, Ranulf Higden, and Henry of Huntingdon. Book 7 begins with the Norman conquest, and at 1189 the English history becomes a London chronicle, dating by mayoral years, and including the names of the mayors and sheriffs of the city of London. This text is clearly related to the London chronicle texts in BL, Cotton MS Vitellius A.xvi, and London, Guildhall Library, MS 3313 (the great chronicle), which, as noted above, has also been attributed, although somewhat dubiously, to Robert Fabyan, and is more distantly related to Bodl. Oxf., MS Gough London 10. <span class="italic">The Newe Cronycles</span> is particularly important in reflecting a change in the perception of history. It is the first of the London chronicles to cite its sources and to extend a localized history to a more general account of England and France. Furthermore <span class="italic">The Newe Cronycles</span> is unique in marking a shift from history as a literary representation of the visual (as it was in the earlier London chronicles), to history as a truly literary form. The comparison of different sources throughout the chronicle, and the importance placed on developing historical themes, are further indications of a changed perspective. It is through <span class="italic">The Newe Cronycles</span> that the London chronicle tradition was transmitted to the later English renaissance writers. John Bale (<i>d</i>. 1563) claims that the first edition of <span class="italic">The Newe Cronycles</span> (1516) was burnt by Cardinal Wolsey, although there is no corroborating evidence for this, save the scarcity of this edition. The second edition, with a continuation, was printed in 1533 after Wolsey's death. Further editions with continuations appeared in 1542 and 1559. The modern edition was edited by Henry Ellis in 1811.<br>
<br>At the time of his death Fabyan had property at Theydon Garnon as well as tenements within the parish of Benet Fink within Warde at Bradstrete, London, and tenements in the parish of St Michael Cornhill. He had other lands and tenements in East Ham, West Ham, and Leyton, and freehold copy in Lambourne, Theydon Bois, Theydon Garnon, Theydon Mount, and Stanford Rivers. He was survived by his wife, two daughters, Joan Haryat and Mary, and four sons, John, Robert, Thomas, and Antony. Also mentioned in his will are his cousin Dorothy and Robert Tate, the latter a mercer and former mayor of London. In his will (which was proved on 12 July 1513) he bequeaths a &#145;masse bok and a prymer&#146;, but does not explicitly bequeath any chronicles. Chronicles are bequeathed in the will of John Fabyan, written in 1541, perhaps a grandson of Robert. Robert Fabyan asked to be buried in Essex, although according to Stow he was buried at St Michael Cornhill. No trace of his monument remained there when Strype's edition of Stow's <span class="italic">Survey</span> was published in 1720.<br>
