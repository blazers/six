<span class="headword">Fitzgerald,  Maurice fitz Maurice</span> <span class="st"> [<em>called </em>Muiris Mael]</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1286), <span class="occ">justiciar of Ireland</span>, called Muiris Mael (&#145;Maurice the Bald&#146;) by the annals of Connacht, was the second son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9576/', "Maurice Fitzgerald (d. 1257)")</script>, the justiciar, and his wife, Juliana. The death of his elder brother, Gerald fitz Maurice Fitzgerald, in 1242/3 and the minority and early death of his nephew, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9575/', "Maurice Fitzgerald (d. 1268)")</script>, made him for most of his active life the most powerful member of his family. His position was reinforced by a considerable landed base. Shortly before he died, his father got from him the abandonment of all claims to the family lands in Kildare and Offaly, in return granting him the property, mostly in Connacht and Ulster, that he himself had acquired during a long career of military expansion and royal service. This included Sligo and largely theoretical claims in Fermanagh and T&iacute;r Conaill. In addition Maurice fitz Maurice held lands in Mayo, together with the extensive manors of Ardrahan and Kilcolgan in Galway and the manor of Inchiquin with the port of Youghal in Cork. His first marriage, about 1258, to Matilda (Maud), daughter of Gerald de Prendergast and widow of Maurice de Rochford, brought him Corran, which consolidated his possessions in Sligo. His second, before 1276, to Emeline (<i>d</i>. in or after 1330), daughter of Stephen Longesp&eacute;e and his wife Emeline (the daughter and coheir of Walter Ridelisford, who had earlier been married to Hugh de Lacy, earl of Ulster), added Corrofin, Galway, to his possessions. He also obtained Ossurres in Kerry from the other Ridelisford heiress and Corcomohide in Limerick from Richard Fitzwilliam. In 1259 he was appointed keeper of the Lord Edward's castle of Athlone and sheriff of Connacht.<br>
<br>This accumulation of power in the west and north of Ireland made Maurice fitz Maurice a serious rival to his overlord, Walter de Burgh (<i>d</i>. 1271), lord of Connacht, who also held lands in Limerick and Tipperary and in 1263 was granted Ulster by the Lord Edward. Serious disputes broke out between them in 1264; in December fitz Maurice and his nephew, Maurice Fitzgerald, lord of Offaly, captured and imprisoned Edward's justiciar, Richard de la Rochelle, and other magnates. Walter de Burgh responded by seizing the Fitzgerald castles and lands in Connacht. It is possible that fitz Maurice was at this stage in favour with the Montfortians: in September 1264 he had been ordered by the Montfort government to assist the earl of Gloucester (who was still in Earl Simon's camp) in recovering seisin of Kilkenny, the custody of which Walter de Burgh had held. But if this was so, the connection was not deep. In April 1265 Geoffrey de Geneville succeeded in negotiating a settlement which involved a restoration by all parties of lands that had been captured. According to the Waverley annals, fitz Maurice, together with other Irish barons, arrived in England shortly after the battle of Evesham &#145;to assist the Lord Edward&#146;  (<span class="italic">Ann. mon.</span>, 2.365). In the spring and early summer of 1266 he had a further safe conduct to England and in August of that year he was with the court at Kenilworth, where he witnessed a charter relating to the marriage-settlement of his nephew with a daughter of William de Valence, Henry III's half-brother.<br>
<br>During the 1270s Maurice fitz Maurice was heavily involved in the attempt to occupy Thomond, where earlier settlements had failed. In the summer of 1272 he took part in an expedition by the justiciar, James Audley, against the U&iacute; Bhriain of Thomond. When Audley was killed in a fall from his horse, he succeeded him as justiciar. His appointment was accepted by Edward's representatives in England, and he seems to have remained in office at least until April 1273, renewing the campaign against the U&iacute; Bhriain and taking hostages from them. In 1274 or 1275 he married his daughter, Juliana, to Thomas de Clare, brother of the earl of Gloucester, settling Youghal and other lands upon them. He was the first witness of a charter in which Clare granted the church of Corcomohide to St Mary's Cathedral, Limerick, for the souls of himself and his wife, his parents, and his parents-in-law. Through an exchange with the Muscegros family and a grant by Edward I, Clare acquired a title to the lordship of Thomond. A close alliance developed between him and his father-in-law. In 1276, when they were involved in helping the justiciar, Robert Ufford, to quell Irish disturbances in Wicklow, fitz Maurice brought troops from his Connacht lands to fight in Glenmalure. In the following year, according to <span class="italic">Caithr&eacute;im Thoirdhealbhaigh</span>, the Gaelic history of the wars in Thomond, he and Juliana were present with Clare at Bunratty Castle and advised him, after an unsuccessful campaign, to revenge himself by killing Briain Ruadh &Oacute; Briain, with whom he had earlier been allied. In 1283 he was again associated with Clare and other lords in an expedition against the MicCharthaigh of Desmond.<br>
<br>Maurice fitz Maurice had died by November in 1286, when his widow, Emeline, was in England. According to <span class="italic">Caithr&eacute;im Thoirdhealbhaigh</span>, he had had a son named Patrick, who was killed in Thomond in 1277, but there is no confirmation of this. His heirs were his two daughters, Juliana de Clare and Amabilia. Long before, he had enfeoffed his younger brother, Thomas fitz Maurice Fitzgerald (<i>d</i>. 1271), of Banada in Sligo. Between 1288 and 1293 Thomas's son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9645/', "John fitz Thomas Fitzgerald, later first earl of Kildare (d. 1316)")</script>, whose aim was to achieve the reintegration of the lands of his grandfather, negotiated the acquisition of Amabilia's share. He also obtained property from Emeline, who was still living in 1330, and for more than forty years appointed attorneys to protect her interests in Ireland. These transactions, together with the earlier settlement of lands on Juliana, led to protracted lawsuits between the various parties. During the 1290s John's aggrandizement provoked further clashes with the de Burghs. These eventually resulted in the loss by the Fitzgeralds of many of the lands that had allowed Maurice fitz Maurice's father to endow him.<br>
