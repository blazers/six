<span class="headword">Maxwell,  James</span> <span class="st"> [<em>pseud. </em>Poet in Paisley]</span>  (1720&#150;1800), <span class="occ">poet and essayist</span>, was born at Auchenback, parish of Mearns, Renfrewshire, on 9 May 1720. At the age of twenty he went to England as a packman, became a weaver, and was at various times clerk, usher, schoolmaster, and stonebreaker. In 1787 he became the recipient of a charity in the gift of the town council of Paisley, which he enjoyed until his death  (Motherwell, 1828, citing council records of 11 Oct 1787). Maxwell was one of the most prolific rhymers of his day, usually designating himself Poet in Paisley, and on some of his title-pages adding to his name the letters &#145;SDP&#146;, meant to signify &#145;student of divine poetry&#146;. He represents the terminus of the virile strain of poetry of Calvinist pietism in eighteenth-century Scotland. His work, however, rarely rises above doggerel. A bibliography of Maxwell's works, comprising fifty-two separate publications, is given in Brown's <span class="italic">Paisley Poets</span> (1.17&#150;22). The main interest in Maxwell today follows from his vocal antagonism to Robert Burns and Thomas Paine. His essay &#145;On the Ayrshire ploughman poet, or poetaster, R. B.&#146; was published in his <span class="italic">Animadversions on some Poets and Poetasters of the Present Age</span> (1788). Of some interest also, for its observation of economic history, is his poem &#145;The great canal, or, The Forth and Clyde Navigation&#146; (1788). His chief works are: <span class="italic">Divine Miscellanies</span> (1756), <span class="italic">Hymns and Spiritual Songs</span> (1759), and <span class="italic">A New Version of the Whole Book of Psalms in Metre</span> (1773), in which he exemplifies his objection to the employment of the organ in church by paraphrasing all of the references to instrumental music in worship so as to suit his own views. In 1795, on his seventy-fifth birthday, Maxwell published an autobiographical poem entitled <span class="italic">A Brief Narrative, or, Some Remarks on the Life of James Maxwell, Poet, in Paisley</span>. From this the reader learns that Maxwell had married, and had had at least one son, though no more is known of his family. He died nearly five years later, in March or April 1800.<br>
