<span class="headword">David <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Gwynne]</span>,  Elizabeth</span>  (1913&#150;1992), <span class="occ">writer on cookery</span>, was born on 26 December 1913 at Wootton Manor, near Polegate, Sussex, the second of four daughters of Rupert Sackville Gwynne (1873&#150;1924), politician, and his wife, the Hon. Stella, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Ridley (<i>d</i>. 1973), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35754/', "Matthew White Ridley, first Viscount Ridley")</script>. Her father was the Conservative MP for Eastbourne from 1911 until his death, and she was baptized in the chapel of the House of Commons on 22 January 1914. She and her sisters were educated at home until their father's sudden death in 1924, when they were sent to boarding-school. She attended Godstowe preparatory school and then St Clare's Private School for Ladies, Tunbridge Wells. At the age of sixteen her mother sent her to Paris to study art and French, and it was there that she had her first taste of good French food.<br>
<br>Restless and independent, Elizabeth Gwynne tried (without much success) to become an actress during the mid-1930s, and for a brief time she worked as a junior vendeuse at the fashion house of Worth. She taught herself to cook, collected recipes, and bought a refrigerator with money given for her twenty-first birthday. Yet she also wanted adventure. In early 1939 she and her lover Charles Gibson Cowan&#151;another social rebel, though from the East End rather than the home counties&#151;bought a boat, the <i>Evelyn Hope</i>, and set off for Greece. The outbreak of the Second World War found them in the south of France, and they were forced to spend the winter of 1939&#150;40 in Antibes. There Elizabeth Gwynne met her most important mentor, the writer and traveller Norman Douglas, who inspired her love of the Mediterranean. She and Cowan set off again in the spring of 1940, and had reached the Strait of Messina when the Italians entered the war on 10 June. The <i>Evelyn Hope</i> was impounded, they were briefly interned, and they reached Athens&#151;boatless and penniless&#151;in July 1940. In September Cowan found a job teaching English on the island of Syros in the Cyclades. There, living in primitive conditions in the village of Vari, Elizabeth Gwynne learned how to cook with the basic staple foods of the Mediterranean. The German invasion of Greece in the spring of 1941 forced them to flee to Egypt, where she spent the rest of the war&#151;first in Alexandria and then in Cairo, where between 1942 and 1945 she ran the ministry of information's reference library. On 30 August 1944, in Cairo, she married Lieutenant-Colonel Anthony David (1911&#150;1967), an officer in the Indian army (Royal Deccan horse regiment), later a club manager and shop owner, and son of Ivor David. She followed him to India after the war, fell ill, and returned to England alone in 1946. That winter, which was exceptionally harsh, she began writing out her yearning for the food she had grown to love in France, Greece, and Egypt. Her husband returned to England in 1947, and in 1949 they bought the house she was to live in for the rest of her life, at 24 Halsey Street, Chelsea, London.<br>
<br>In 1949, encouraged by a friend who worked on the magazine, Elizabeth David began writing a cookery column for <span class="italic">Harper's Bazaar</span>. Her first book, <span class="italic">A Book of Mediterranean Food</span>, was published in 1950 by John Lehmann. It proved an immediate success, and was followed by <span class="italic">French Country Cooking</span> (1951). Her next book was <span class="italic">Italian Food</span>, for which she made an extensive research trip to Italy which took up most of 1952. Of all her books it was the one in which she felt she had put the best of herself, though it was by far the most difficult. It was published in 1954, and was followed a year later by <span class="italic">Summer Cooking</span>. She had not stopped writing for <span class="italic">Harper's</span>, but in 1956 she was easily persuaded to move to <span class="italic">Vogue</span>, which offered her more money and more prominence. <span class="italic">Vogue</span> also gave her the opportunity to visit many different areas of France, during which she completed her research on the book for which she would be best remembered: <span class="italic">French Provincial Cooking</span> (1960). The book was dedicated to &#145;PH&#146;, a man with whom she had been in love since the early 1950s. The affair coincided with her separation from Tony David, from whom she was divorced in 1960. There were no children of the marriage.<br>
<br>The publication of <span class="italic">French Provincial Cooking</span> marked the end of a decade of strenuous work, during which David had written for a number of newspapers, including the <span class="italic">Daily Express</span>, the <span class="italic">News Chronicle</span>, and (from 1955 to 1960) the <span class="italic">Sunday Times</span>. She left the paper in 1960 and soon after was taken on by <span class="italic">The Spectator</span>. Her professional career was at its height. She was hailed not only as Britain's foremost writer on food and cookery, but as the woman who had transformed the eating habits of middle-class England. To her editors she was a stickler for detail, but to her readers she was a joy. Her books and articles were filled with historical anecdote and irreverent wit, and she could describe food in a way that inspired people to cook&#151;though her recipes took no short cuts, and demanded time and trouble. &#145;To one reader who totted up the deadly total of bowls, sieves, spoons and forks needed to make a smoked haddock souffl&eacute;, she wrote back: &#147;You forgot the plates&#148;&#146;  (&#145;Profile of Elizabeth David&#146;, <span class="italic">New Statesman</span>, 9 Aug 1968).<br>
<br>Tall and well-built, with a long neck and slanting black eyes, David's feline grace was accentuated by the severe, well-cut suits she wore with crisp white shirts in her professional life. Some people found her cold and daunting, but around the kitchen table at Halsey Street her friends saw a very different person. She loved to sit and talk for hours over a bottle of wine and a packet of Gauloise cigarettes, with her back to her old gas cooker. Every now and again she would lean round to peer into the oven or twiddle with a knob, but her attention was on the conversation&#151;which was colourful, wide-ranging, and punctuated by gales of laughter. When the food was ready it was served in the dishes it had cooked in, without fuss or comment.<br>
<br>Yet for all David's success, she was not happy. Her long-standing affair with PH ended, and a combination of misery, alcohol, sleeping pills, and overwork resulted in a cerebral haemorrhage, in the spring of 1963. She recovered, but her sense of taste was impaired for a time, and she felt that she could never write another book. Instead, she and four other partners decided to set up a kitchen shop. Elizabeth David Ltd opened at 46 Bourne Street, Pimlico, in November 1965. It pioneered a new generation of shops devoted exclusively to kitchenware. David chose the stock and compiled the catalogues, and Bourne Street became the centre of her life. She wrote four little booklets, for sale on the premises: <span class="italic">Dried Herbs, Aromatics and Condiments</span> (1967), <span class="italic">English Potted Meats and Fish Pastes</span> (1968), <span class="italic">The Baking of an English Loaf</span> (1969), and <span class="italic">Syllabubs and Fruit Fools</span> (1969). She even found time to write another full-length book, <span class="italic">Spices, Salt and Aromatics in the English Kitchen</span> (1970), which she saw as one of the first of a series of volumes on English cookery. But she was not a businesswoman. Tensions between her and her partners became intolerable, and in 1973 she severed all connection with the shop&#151;which continued trading under her name. Over the years she tried repeatedly to get her name back, but without success.<br>
<br>In 1977 David was badly injured in a car accident, from which she took a long time to recover. She was still in hospital for the publication of <span class="italic">English Bread and Yeast Cookery</span> (1977), which was hailed as a masterpiece of scholarship. Once on her feet again she immersed herself in researches for her next project, <span class="italic">Harvest of the Cold Months: the Social History of Ice and Ices</span> (1994). This book developed slowly, as a series of essays. It was still far from completion when she published a book of her journalism, <span class="italic">An Omelette and a Glass of Wine</span> (1984). Although she made several visits to California in the 1980s, David's health was failing. A series of falls resulted in long periods in hospital, and she never got over the death in 1986 of her sister Felicit&eacute;, with whom she had shared her house for the previous thirty years. She was seventy-eight when she suffered a severe stroke, followed two days later by another. She died at her Halsey Street home on 22 May 1992, and was buried on 28 May at the family church of St Peter's, Folkington. On 10 September 1992 a memorial service was held at St Martin-in-the-Fields, followed by a &#145;memorial picnic&#146; in the Nash Room at the Institute of Contemporary Arts.<br>
<br>Elizabeth David appeared on <span class="italic">The Food Programme</span> with Derek Cooper on Radio 4, broadcast on 24 October 1982, and a few years later she agreed to take part in a documentary about herself presented by Jancis Robinson&#151;<span class="italic">A Matter of Taste</span>, broadcast by Channel 4 on 26 December 1989. These were exceptional: she usually shunned publicity, rarely gave interviews, and never spoke about her private life. However, she was much photographed, by Cecil Beaton and Anthony Denney among others. There is also a portrait of her by John Ward now in the National Portrait Gallery, showing David in the kitchen of her house in Halsey Street.<br>
<br>David was the best writer on food and drink this country has ever produced. When she began writing in the 1950s, the British scarcely noticed what was on their plates at all, which was perhaps just as well. Her books and articles persuaded her readers that food was one of life's great pleasures, and that cooking should not be a drudgery but an exciting and creative act. In doing so she inspired a whole generation not only to cook, but to think about food in an entirely different way.<br>
