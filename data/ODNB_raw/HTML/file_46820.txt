<span class="headword">Clayton,  Nathaniel</span>  (1811&#150;1890), <span class="occ">engineer and manufacturer of steam engines</span>, was born on 25 August 1811 at Lincoln, the second son of Nathaniel Clayton (<i>d</i>. 1827), of Lincoln. His father was the proprietor of a horse-drawn packet boat that plied the River Witham between Boston and Lincoln. Clayton junior went to work at the Butterley ironworks in Derbyshire, but after his father died in 1827 he returned to Lincoln to be packet captain for his mother, who continued with the business. A few years later he bought the steam packet <i>Celerity</i> on his own account.<br>
<br>Clayton had not lost touch with the world of engineering, one of his contacts being William Howden, of Boston, who was one of the pioneers in the manufacture of portable steam engines. Clayton started a small iron foundry in Lincoln, next to the boat-building yard of Shuttleworth and Godwin, in which his brother-in-law, Joseph Shuttleworth, was a partner. In 1842 Shuttleworth formed a partnership with Clayton as Clayton, Shuttleworth &amp; Co., and they established the Stamp End foundry, Lincoln. At first they undertook small contracts, making pipes, bridges, and railway equipment. The firm's first portable steam engine was made in 1845, and further ones were made in the following few years. Shortage of capital hampered development, causing Clayton and Shuttleworth to seek extra support. Coupland, Keyworth, and Seely, millers and leaders of Lincoln's business establishment at this time, became sleeping partners. Seely, the last of these, was finally bought out in 1869.<br>
<br>The Great Exhibition of 1851 helped to establish the firm's national reputation as the leading British manufacturer of portable steam engines and threshing machines: Clayton and Shuttleworth showed a 6 horsepower portable engine, a threshing machine, and a grinding mill. Their output of steam engines that year exceeded 100. By 1854, when the Royal Agricultural Society of England show was held in Lincoln, the company employed 520 men and 80 boys. Exports were already becoming a major part of the firm's trade, principally to central and eastern Europe. One branch establishment was opened in Vienna in 1857, and others followed at Pest, Prague, Cracow, and Lemberg (Lw&oacute;w). In later years exports to South America also became important. More than two-thirds of the products were commonly exported every year. By 1890 the firm had made about 26,000 steam engines in total. Most were portable, in which market Clayton, Shuttleworth &amp; Co. had an unassailable lead, but the firm's traction engines and fixed steam engines also had a good reputation. The manufacture of threshing machines was on a similar scale: about 24,000 had been made by 1890.<br>
<br>In 1837 Clayton married Hannah Shortcliffe, and they had three daughters, one of whom married Alfred Shuttleworth, the son of his partner. Clayton served on Lincoln city council and was mayor of the city for the year 1856&#150;7. He served as a magistrate there, and later also for the county. He was a deputy lieutenant, and in 1881 he was high sheriff for the county. In 1884 he was asked to stand as Liberal candidate in a parliamentary by-election, but he declined on grounds of ill health and age. The seat was won instead by Joseph Ruston (1835&#150;1897). Clayton was a great supporter of the improvements to the city of Lincoln, especially in education, health, and sanitation. He did this partly through his position on the council, but also through philanthropy, of which one of the most important examples was his provision for the rebuilding of Lincoln County Hospital between 1876 and 1878.<br>
<br>In 1875 Clayton bought the Withcall estate, near Louth. His main residence in Lincoln was Eastcliffe House, built in 1877, but he had another house on the Isle of Wight. He was a member of the Royal Yacht Squadron, and also served as a volunteer lieutenant in the 2nd company, Lincoln rifle corps. Clayton died from heart disease, at the church of St Peter in Eastgate, Lincoln, on 21 December 1890.<br>
