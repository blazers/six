<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Manners,  John</span>, marquess of Granby  (1721&#150;1770), <span class="occ">army officer and politician</span>, was born at Kelham, Nottinghamshire, on 2 January 1721, the eldest son of John Manners, third duke of Rutland (1696&#150;1779), and his wife, Bridget (1699&#150;1734), the younger daughter and heir of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26805/', "Robert Sutton, second Baron Lexington")</script>. He entered Eton College in 1732, and on 2 July 1738 matriculated from Trinity College, Cambridge. Although he did not take a degree, he was awarded an LLD in 1769. From Cambridge he completed the continental grand tour in company with his tutor John Ewer, later bishop of Bangor. While he was still abroad his father's political interest saw Granby returned to parliament for the borough of Grantham (June 1741).<h2>
<a name="Theyoungofficer"></a>The young officer</h2>On 4 October 1745, during the Jacobite rising, the duke of Rutland, having raised in support of the Hanoverian dynasty the Leicester blues, one of fifteen &#145;noble&#146; regiments, inaugurated Granby's military career by making him its colonel. His regiment never saw action, seeing out the rebellion as part of the garrison of Newcastle upon Tyne. Granby could have interpreted his colonelcy as a post taken up out of aristocratic duty at a time of national crisis, but instead he sought to be taken seriously as a soldier. He volunteered to serve on the duke of Cumberland's staff in Scotland, and in March 1746 is reported to have been present during operations at Strathbogie, a prelude to Culloden. Upon the disbandment of his regiment Granby retained his rank and seniority as a colonel in the army and in 1747 campaigned in the Low Countries. At about this time he had a mistress who became the mother of his illegitimate children George (<i>c</i>.1746&#150;1772), MP for Scarborough from 1768 until his death, and Anne, who married her cousin John Manners-Sutton (1752&#150;1826), MP for Newark from 1783 to 1796.<br>
<br>As a young man Granby made his mark not as a soldier or parliamentarian but as an enthusiastic huntsman, a racegoer, and a gambler; on 1 September 1750 Horace Walpole wrote, &#145;He is in debt &pound;10,000&#146;  (Walpole, <span class="italic">Corr.</span>, 20.183). On 3 September 1750 he married Frances (1728&#150;1761), the eldest daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25158/', "Charles Seymour, sixth duke of Somerset")</script>, and his second wife, Lady Charlotte Finch; among their children were <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17950/', "Charles Manners, later fourth duke of Rutland (1754&#150;1787)")</script>, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17961/', "Lord Robert Manners (1758&#150;1782)")</script>. Granby's new bride also had a reputation as a spendthrift, and Walpole joked that the couple were well matched not only in their lineage but in their lack of ready funds.<br>
<br>In 1752, as a means of securing the support of the Rutland family's parliamentary interest, the Pelham ministry urged George II to appoint Granby colonel of the Royal Horse Guards (the Blues), one of the army's most prestigious regiments. The king at first refused, denouncing Granby as &#145;a sot, a bully, that does nothing but drink and quarrel&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 32729, fol. 4). However, Granby's credit with the king gradually increased. He was elected MP for Cambridgeshire in 1754, and although he expressed a genuine loathing of party divisions he allied himself with the government whig Philip Yorke (later second earl of Hardwicke). Once elected, he defended the duke of Newcastle's administration in speeches in the Commons. In 1755 he was promoted major-general, and in May 1758 he gained the colonelcy requested in 1752.<h2>
<a name="TheSevenYearsWar"></a>The Seven Years' War</h2>Three months later, Granby was sent to Germany in command of a brigade of cavalry in the British expeditionary force. When the force commander, Charles Spencer, third duke of Marlborough, died in October 1758, Granby succeeded Lord George Sackville as second in command, and in February 1759 he was promoted lieutenant-general. At the battle of Minden in August 1759 Granby led the second line of cavalry and was praised in orders by Prince Ferdinand of Brunswick, overall commander of the allied army. Prince Ferdinand did this, however, as a means of indirectly criticizing Granby's superior, Sackville, who Ferdinand felt had disobeyed orders by failing to bring forward the cavalry in time to exploit victory. Sackville resigned in protest, and on 14 August Granby became commander-in-chief of the British contingent in his place. At Sackville's subsequent court martial Granby, without rancour, stated his belief that the cavalry had indeed been led forward too slowly. He was uncomfortable at testifying against his former superior officer and endeavoured to suggest that Sackville had not been negligent, but at best could only give the impression that Sackville had been confused rather than disobedient. If Granby had sought to prevent a verdict of guilty, he failed. Sackville later &#145;always wrote with contempt [of Granby], referring to promises extracted from him &#147;in the midst of riot and dissipation&#148;&#146;  (Mackesy, 247).<br>
<br>At the battle of Warburg on 31 July 1760 Granby took the opportunity to show the capability of the cavalry when under his personal command. Three times his impetuosity scattered the French troops opposing him; and the loss of his hat when leading the charge gave rise to the expression &#145;To go at it bald-headed&#146; (Granby, who by his twenties had lost most of his hair, famously disdained to wear a wig). At Vellinghausen on 15&#150;16 July 1761 he showed himself a general as well as a fighter when, on successive days, his able dispositions repulsed the assaults of the French. He then launched a counter-attack and secured victory. His beaten opponent, the duc de Broglie, so admired Granby that he commissioned a portrait of him by Sir Joshua Reynolds. At the battle of Wilhelmstahl on 25 June 1762 Granby secured another triumph, the troops under his command cutting off the French rearguard and compelling the surrender of some of their finest regiments. &#145;Il a manoeuvr&eacute; comme un ange &hellip; no man ever acted with more courage or more like a commanding officer&#146;, commented an enraptured Lord Ligonier  (Whitworth, 369). Finally, at Br&uuml;ckerm&uuml;hl on 21 September 1762, Granby raised himself from his sickbed to bring two brigades to the relief of the Brunswicker, General Zastrow.<br>
<br>Although a successful battlefield commander, Granby did not possess all the attributes of a general. He was no administrator&#151;a serious failing in someone who was responsible for the welfare of no fewer than 25,000 British troops&#151;and he cheerfully admitted that he hated writing. During the winter campaign of 1760&#150;61, when the commissariat was under his direct control, payments were late and supplies became scarce. Not only did military operations suffer but costs increased and monthly expenditure by the commissariat rose from a budgeted &pound;150,000 to &pound;340,000. Fraud by contractors was rife. As discipline in a hungry army came under strain, officers schooled under the harsher regime of the duke of Cumberland became critical of Granby's leniency towards deserters and marauders. Lord Frederick Cavendish, while acknowledging Granby to be &#145;indefatigable and diligent&#146; at the head of an advance guard, believed that his inability to maintain discipline made him an unfit commander  (Devonshire MSS, Chatsworth, Derbyshire, MS 397.111). Amid such circles the expression &#145;German discipline&#146; took on ironic connotations.<h2>
<a name="Politics"></a>Politics</h2>To the wider public, however, this mattered less than Granby's battlefield successes; and at the end of the Seven Years' War his reputation stood at its height. Much of his popularity derived from his well-publicized solicitude for his men. Edward Penny's painting <span class="italic">The Marquess of Granby Relieving a Sick Soldier</span>, exhibited in 1765, overturned conventional expectations of the history painting by showing Granby acting heroically in an act of private charity and not on the field of war. The engraving outsold even that of Benjamin West's <span class="italic">Death of General Wolfe</span>. The large number of public houses called the Marquess of Granby is testimony to the lasting gratitude felt towards him by the disabled non-commissioned officers whom he is believed to have set up as publicans. Horace Walpole might have sneered that he was the &#145;mob's hero&#146;  (Walpole, <span class="italic">Corr.</span>, 21.315), but this simply provided another reason why, even before his return home from Germany, Granby was being assiduously courted by politicians. Most importantly, the political world speculated whether he would lead the Rutland parliamentary vote in support of the terms of peace negotiated by the Bute government. That in the end he did vote for the treaty of Paris, notwithstanding his personal regard for the duke of Newcastle&#151;who now led the opposition&#151;was a reflection of the fact that he thought the measure right and he knew that the new monarch, George III, wished it. Granby felt an instinctive aversion towards party politics; at most he would work with individuals whom he believed public-spirited. But this was not an easy path to pursue amid the turbulent politics of the 1760s. Initially he gravitated towards George Grenville, whom he trusted even if he disliked his political associates, and on 1 July 1763 he accepted from Grenville's new ministry the master-generalship of the ordnance. He supported the government over Wilkes and general warrants, but on 10 January 1765 he spoke against the dismissal of army officers from their employments on the basis of their votes in parliament. In May 1765, when the London silk weavers rioted, Grenville's colleague George Montagu Dunk, second earl of Halifax, tried to persuade the king to appoint Granby commander-in-chief of the army: &#145;Lord Granby is a very popular man and might save the lives of these deluded wretches which may be exposed and sacrificed by another commander&#146;  (<span class="italic">Correspondence of George III</span>, 1.105). Although the king, having promised the reversion to the duke of Cumberland, refused, when the Grenville administration fell a month later Granby remained master-general of the ordnance at George III's request. Granby nevertheless declined to act with the new Rockingham ministry and voted against it over the repeal of the <span class="roman">Stamp Act</span>.<br>
<br>With the formation of the ministry of William Pitt, earl of Chatham, the following year, Granby was finally appointed commander-in-chief of the army (13 August 1766). He accepted reluctantly, knowing that his predecessor, the octogenarian John, Earl Ligonier, resented being forcibly retired. It was then rumoured that he would leave parliament, but during the general election of April 1768 Granby campaigned more vigorously than ever and increased the Rutland group's parliamentary representation to seven&#151;adding to his debts in the process. By now his personal loyalty was directed towards Chatham. But when ill health prompted Chatham's resignation from office in October 1768, Granby was cut adrift; he remained in a cabinet headed by Augustus Fitzroy, third duke of Grafton, without finding political consistency easy to come by. His biggest test came with the controversy aroused by the return in the general election of John Wilkes to parliament by the electors of Middlesex. Granby had been against moves in government to have him expelled, but his distaste for Wilkes's character and demagoguery eventually overcame his principles, and when, on 3 February 1769, the motion for expulsion was put to the Commons, he voted in favour. Upon Wilkes being returned again by the electors of Middlesex, Granby voted for the seating of Henry Luttrell in his place. The timing of his volte-face was unfortunate. On 21 January 1769 the first letter of the controversialist Junius had appeared in the <span class="italic">Public Advertiser</span>. Amid an attack on the Grafton administration as a whole, Junius accused Granby of nepotism, brokering the sale of commissions, and servility towards the court. Ordinarily, Granby's continuing popularity would have been proof against the assault, and besides, as Junius later admitted, he had no particular quarrel with him; but when Granby's school contemporary Sir William Draper, the conqueror of Manila, published a defence of his old friend, Junius felt compelled to justify his allegations. His task was made easier by the ineptitude of Draper's reply, which in effect admitted that the convivial (and famously hard-drinking) Granby was liable to be imposed upon by unscrupulous associates. Junius pounced gleefully: &#145;It is you, Sir William Draper, who have taken pains to represent your friend in the character of a drunken landlord, who deals out his promises as liberally as his liquor&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters of Junius</span>, 41). Further ammunition against Granby's reputation was provided by the vote in parliament just four days before on the Middlesex election: &#145;Does he not at this moment give up all character and dignity as a gentleman in receding from his own repeated declarations in favour of Mr Wilkes?&#146;  (ibid., 40). The knife was then given a final twist with a well-informed attack on Granby for the deplorably undermanned condition of the army overseas&#151;in the West Indies, the Mediterranean, and North America&#151;and closer to home in Ireland, lending credence to the argument that Junius was the <i>nom de plume</i> of Philip Francis, a senior clerk in the war office.<br>
<br>So counter-productive were Draper's interventions over the following weeks against Junius on Granby's behalf that it was believed he was asked to desist by his friend. Thereafter Junius took notice of Granby only when addressing a public appeal to him (6 May 1769) to cease his continued votes for the seating of Luttrell. That Granby eventually changed his mind on the issue once again had less to do with Junius's strictures, however, than the return to the political arena of Lord Chatham [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/95095', "Chathamites")</script>]. Strongly opposed to the government, and especially over the Middlesex election, Chatham used John Calcraft, the influential army agent, as his intermediary in persuading Granby to break with the Grafton ministry. As late as November 1769 Granby was reluctant to throw up office, telling Calcraft that it must &#145;look like skulking to Junius, or that he saw himself as unfit for the command of the army&#146;  (<span class="italic">Correspondence of William Pitt</span>, 3.363). But at the opening of parliament on 9 January 1770 he announced that his opinion on the Middlesex election had changed, and he voted against the government on the address. His resignation as commander-in-chief of the army and as master-general of the ordnance followed eight days later.<h2>
<a name="Deathandassessment"></a>Death and assessment</h2>Out of office Granby found that his creditors, of whom there were many, became anxious, and he was increasingly dunned for repayment. By resigning as master-general of the ordnance he had given up a salary of &pound;1500 per annum. Moreover, his resignation forfeited him the reversion of the colonelcy of the 1st foot guards, worth &pound;3000 per annum, which on the death of Lord Ligonier went instead to William, duke of Gloucester, brother of George III. In the summer he went to Scarborough to support his candidate, George Cockburne, comptroller of the navy, in a parliamentary by-election. His man was defeated, but Granby remained to recuperate from illness. He died in Scarborough on 18 October 1770 from a seizure brought on by an attack of gout in the stomach. He was buried in Bottesford church, Belvoir, Leicestershire, on 28 October; his remains were reinterred in the mausoleum at Belvoir Castle in 1829.<br>
<br>Granby left debts estimated at &pound;60,000 and assets of just &pound;23,000. Since he died intestate, his affairs were administered by the army agent John Calcraft, who, as was his wont, had secured Granby's debts to him through life insurance. Horace Walpole for one claimed that Calcraft, with his financial hold on Granby, had been able to wield an excessive influence over him. In his entry on Granby for the <span class="roman">History of Parliament</span>, Sir Lewis Namier suspected that Granby was probably indulgent towards Calcraft's contractor friends.<br>
<br>Granby was an instinctive soldier. He achieved rank through his family and political connections without serving an apprenticeship as a regimental officer. Yet on the battlefield his tactical judgement was unerring. When a more considered approach or a measure of application were necessary, whether in military administration or in politics, he was found wanting; but the public could identify with the gifted amateur, especially when he appeared to embody so many of the unsophisticated virtues of the English country gentleman. Even Walpole, one of Granby's severest critics, could on this basis pen a generous obituary:<blockquote>His large and open countenance &hellip; his robust and commanding person, and a proportion of florid beauty so great, that the baldness of his head, which he carried totally bare, was rather an addition to its comely roundness than a defect &hellip; all distinguished him without any extrinsic ornament, and pointed out his rank when he walked without attendance &hellip; Intrepidity, sincerity, humanity, and generosity, were not only innate in his breast, but was never corrupted there &hellip; His modesty was incapable of ostentation.</blockquote>But to Walpole's mind, at least, Granby's merits were as often as not vitiated by his lack of understanding:<blockquote>Of money he seemed to conceive no use but in giving it away: but that profusion was so indiscriminate, that compassion or solicitation, and consequently imposture, were equally the master of his purse &hellip; No man meant to feel more patriotism, or to be more warmly attached to the constitution of the country; yet his unsuspicious nature suffered him to be easily made the tool of its enemies &hellip; In a rude age he would probably have been a successful general from his own valour, and the enthusiasm &hellip; which his soldiers felt for him; but in times wherein military knowledge is so much improved it was perhaps fortunate for his country that the sole command was never entrusted to him in any capital emergency. (Walpole, <span class="italic">Memoirs</span>, 2.117&#150;19)</blockquote>
