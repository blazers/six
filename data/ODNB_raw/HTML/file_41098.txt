<span class="headword">Ross,  (John) Carl</span>  (1901&#150;1986), <span class="occ">fishery entrepreneur</span>, was born in Cleethorpes, Lincolnshire, on 29 July 1901, the second of three sons and fourth of six children of Thomas Ross, Grimsby fish merchant, and his wife Marie, daughter of Herbert Bannister, trawler owner. He was educated at the East Anglian School at Culford, Suffolk, and served for a brief time in the Royal Navy, which he had joined shortly before armistice day in 1918. Upon demobilization, he entered the family fish merchanting firm of Thomas Ross Ltd, from which his father retired early, through illness, in 1928. In that year he married Elsie, daughter of Samuel Hartley, a cotton salesman based in Blackburn. They had two sons and two daughters. From that time Ross initiated a steady decade of expansion, which included the import of frozen halibut and salmon from North America, a very innovative activity, which was to continue well into the years following the end of the Second World War in 1945.<br>
<br>While Carl Ross was developing his fish merchanting activities, he had the foresight to recognize that the future of the fishing industry might lie in integrating fish catching, processing, and merchanting, and he built the first diesel trawlers in the mid-1930s. However, his first major incursion into trawler owning was when he purchased the nine vessels of the late Sir Alec Black, first baronet, in 1943. In 1944 he acquired a majority shareholding in Trawlers Grimsby Ltd, a publicly quoted company into which Thomas Ross Ltd was injected. This was the foundation-stone of what became the Ross Group.<br>
<br>It was at this stage that Ross demonstrated a remarkable ability to deal with financial and accountancy matters, although he had no formal training. He had a formidable talent for reading and understanding figures and gained great respect in City financial circles. This ability triggered off an extensive series of take-overs of companies engaged in all aspects of the fishing industry, including major catching and processing companies in Hull, which gave the Ross Group a dominant situation on the Humber. In 1956 the Ross Group acquired G. F. Sleight Ltd, owners of a substantial but ageing fleet, and thus, in one swoop, Carl Ross secured the services of twenty of the best North Sea skippers. It was a move that allowed him to announce a major North Sea and Middle Water trawler-building programme to accommodate these skippers. The programme was a resounding success and the subsequent profitable record of the Bird and Cat class of Ross vessels became a legend. The Ross Group built many more vessels, including deep-sea freezer trawlers, most of which were constructed at the Cochrane yards at Selby, which it acquired. At its peak, the Ross Group owned the largest fishing fleet in Europe.<br>
<br>In the very rapid growth of the Ross Group, the only set-back Carl Ross encountered was in 1966, when the Monopolies Commission refused to allow the Ross bid for Associated Fisheries Ltd, the other major publicly quoted company in the fishing industry, although the financial and business logic was irrefutable. Ironically, only two years later, the government itself was instrumental in bringing the fleets of the Ross Group and Associated Fisheries together to form British United Trawlers. In the early 1950s, when Carl Ross recognized that the fish industry was but part of the food industry, he extended the Ross frozen fish business to become Ross Foods. An added dimension to the Ross Foods business was the acquisition of the Youngs shellfish company. Carl Ross established Ross Poultry (1961), which played a major role in the integration and rationalization of the British poultry industry; created Ross Vegetable (1960), the biggest single UK potato distributor; and developed a series of peripheral activities including the chain of Ross Motorway Services (1965).<br>
<br>Carl Ross parted company with the Ross Group after a somewhat acrimonious boardroom struggle in the late 1960s, which culminated in the take-over of the company by Imperial Group Ltd in 1970. Although almost seventy, he then played a major role as chairman in developing Cosalt plc. He maintained an active interest in the affairs of that company until he died.<br>
<br>In his youth Ross was a distinguished county hockey player. Almost until his death he also enjoyed golf and shooting and for a period owned several racehorses. He obtained a pilot's licence in 1930 and played an active role in the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve cadet force during the Second World War. He was a high steward of Grimsby (1970&#150;86) and a member of the companies of Poulterers and Fruiterers. He was a past president and leading member of the Fishing Industry Sports Association and a generous contributor to many charities. He was president of the Grimsby Conservative Association for some twenty-five years from 1954.<br>
<br>Ross was 5 feet 9 inches tall, of medium build, with a strong face and distinguished appearance. Ross died in Grimsby on 9 January 1986.<br>
