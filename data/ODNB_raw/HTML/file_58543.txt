</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Gernsheim,  Helmut Erich Robert</span>  (1913&#150;1995), <span class="occ">photographer and historian</span>, was born in Munich on 1 March 1913, the third son of Karl Gernsheim, a historian of literature at Munich University, and his wife, Hermine, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Scholz. He was educated at St Anne's College, Augsburg, and began a degree course in art history at Munich University in 1933, but soon realized he was unlikely to complete it in the prevailing political climate: he feared being drafted into Hitler's army, and in any case he was partly Jewish. He decided to move to London, where his brother ran an art gallery, but the latter advised him to acquire a practical skill first (on the grounds that he would make no living as an art historian in Britain). So in 1934 he enrolled in the Bavarian State School of Photography in Munich, where he studied for two years, emerging with a first-class diploma. In 1937 he moved to London and set up as a freelance photographer; he became a British citizen in 1946.<br>
<br>Gernsheim's outlook on photography and his own practice as a photographer were influenced by <i>Neue Sachlichkeit</i> (new objectivity), which characterized much radical German art and design in the 1920s. <i>Neue Sachlichkeit</i> was suppressed in Nazi Germany (Gernsheim became properly conscious of it only from books he bought in London during the war), but by the 1930s its influence on German photography was irrevocable. This is evident in Gernsheim's photographs of the details and surfaces of objects, often in close-up and isolated from their usual contexts.<br>
<br>Gernsheim was a man of strong opinions and a justified faith in his own taste and judgement, and his criticisms could be trenchant (the British, he declared &#145;are not a visually minded nation&#146;). However, they were rarely groundless. He pronounced the generality of 1930s British photography &#145;antiquated, fuzzy, sentimental, sugary &hellip; an artificial world one associates with chocolate and soap boxes&#146;  (Hill and Cooper, 166). It is certainly true that British taste and practice were at odds with Gernsheim's <i>Neue Sachlichkeit</i> approach. Many British photographers remained influenced by the pictorialism of Victorian and Edwardian photography, drawing their aesthetic from painting, and employing printing techniques to impart a more &#145;painterly&#146; quality to their work. Gernsheim saw the Royal Photographic Society (RPS) as a bastion of this approach, and felt frustrated in his attempts to convert the society to his views, eventually resigning his RPS fellowship in 1952.<br>
<br>In 1940 Gernsheim was interned as an enemy alien, and he ended up in a camp in Australia. His photographic training came to his rescue, and in 1941 he was permitted to return to Britain to work for the National Buildings Record, photographing buildings of national importance ahead of anticipated war damage. While waiting for clearance to undertake this work, Gernsheim revised some lectures he had given during his internment in Australia, and in 1942 they were published as his first book, <span class="italic">New Photo Vision</span>. The book lays down &#145;a challenge to those photographers for whom photographic means are not &#147;artistic&#148; enough&#146;  (<span class="italic">New Photo Vision</span>, 3), illustrating the point with his own photographs.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">New Photo Vision</span> also initiated Gernsheim's friendship with Beaumont Newhall, the American photo-historian. It was Newhall who persuaded Gernsheim of the need for a photo-historian also to be a collector. Gernsheim recounts finding his first Julia Margaret Cameron prints &#145;more or less by accident&#146;, at a dealer where they were in danger of being used for packing &#145;because of their stout cardboard&#146;  (Hill and Cooper, 182). He amassed a collection of great importance, and made two especially significant discoveries. He rediscovered Charles Dodgson (Lewis Carroll) as a photographer, and found what is considered the earliest extant photograph, Ni&eacute;pce's image of a view from a window, taken in 1826 or 1827 with an exposure of eight hours.<br>
<br>Gernsheim collaborated closely with his wife, Alison, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Eames (<i>c</i>.1911&#150;1969), whom he met in 1942 and married in 1946; indeed, his most significant work was produced during their marriage. He published prolifically, adopting an approach whereby research and writing were closely dependent on the fruits of his collecting. Alison, a historian by training, undertook the historical research, and she is named as his collaborator in a number of his publications. He wrote more than twenty monographs on subjects including Julia Margaret Cameron (1948), Lewis Carroll (1949), and Roger Fenton (1954). In 1955 he published <span class="italic">The History of Photography</span>, a monumental work of photo-history which appeared in an enlarged edition in 1969, and out of which came the very popular <span class="italic">Concise History of Photography</span> (1965).<br>
<br>The Gernsheims selected works from their collection for a ground-breaking exhibition held in 1951 at the Victoria and Albert Museum, entitled &#145;Masterpieces of Victorian Photography&#146;. They envisaged their collection forming the basis of a British national collection of photography, with Gernsheim as director. However, a suitable home was not forthcoming, partly due to widespread ignorance about the need for such a museum, but also on account of Gernsheim's very particular specifications. The collection (33,000 photographs, together with cameras and Gernsheim's library) was ultimately sold to the University of Texas in 1963, though the Gernsheims finally decided against moving to Texas with it. They moved instead to Castagnola, Lugano, Switzerland, from where Gernsheim continued to work, though his output decreased after Alison's death on 27 March 1969. In 1971 he married Ir&egrave;ne Gu&eacute;nin of Geneva. Gernsheim died in Switzerland on 20 July 1995, survived by his second wife.<br>
<br>Gernsheim's importance to photography cannot be overstated. The Gernsheim collection immeasurably enriches our photographic inheritance, and the scholarship that he built upon the collection was instrumental in establishing the academic credibility of photo-history.<br>
