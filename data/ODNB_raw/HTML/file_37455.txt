<span class="headword">Rothbury,  Gilbert</span>  (<em>b. </em>in or before 1260, <em>d.</em> 1321), <span class="occ">administrator and justice</span>, makes his first appearance in surviving records in 1281. The context suggests that he must already by then have been of age and so was born in or before 1260. He probably came from Rothbury in Northumberland, and the Hugh of Rothbury who was a clerk of the common bench justice William of Brompton in the 1280s may have been his brother. The provisions made by Rothbury's executors to establish loan chests at the universities of Oxford and Cambridge after his death suggest that he may have received some sort of university education.<br>
<br>During the 1280s Rothbury was probably one of the clerks serving the justices of the &#145;northern&#146; eyre circuit. It is in 1290, however, that he first comes into prominence, with his appointment to the responsible post of clerk of the king's council. At the same time he also became the first known clerk of parliament, and thus was responsible for beginning the compilation of the rolls of parliament. Only a much less comprehensive record had hitherto been kept of business done in parliament. Rothbury was probably not himself responsible for the change, merely the executor of a policy determined by others.<br>
<br>Rothbury ceased to be clerk of the council when he was appointed a justice of the court of king's bench in 1295, but he remained clerk of parliament until at least 1307 and perhaps as late as 1314. The few surviving reports of cases heard in king's bench during the period he was a justice (1295&#150;1316) do not suggest that he made a major contribution to the work of the court. His senior colleague, Roger Brabazon (<i>d</i>. 1317), evidently had the sharper legal mind. In 1316 Rothbury was transferred to the common bench, of which he remained a junior justice until the time of his death. Again there is little evidence to suggest that he made a significant contribution to the work of the court.<br>
<br>In 1297 an Irish attorney acting for the abbot of Mellifont in a case before king's bench suggested to the abbot that he would be guaranteed success in his litigation if he paid Rothbury a bribe of 20 marks through the attorney. This appears simply to have been a trick on the part of the attorney, and not evidence that Rothbury was known to have been corrupt. Surprisingly for a royal justice of this period, there is no evidence of Rothbury's accumulating lands or other property, although he did come to hold a number of benefices, and in 1306 and 1307 received papal dispensation to do so. He died in 1321, at some time between early February (the end of Hilary term) and 4 May (the beginning of Easter term).<br>
