<span class="headword">Porter,  Walter</span> <span class="st"> [<em>name in religion </em>Francis]</span>  (1631/2&#150;1702), <span class="occ">Franciscan friar</span>, was born in Kingstown, co. Meath, in 1631 or 1632, the son of Simon Porter. In September 1653 he received a testimonial from the Jesuits in their college at Lille on completion of his studies in the humanities. He may have entered the Franciscan noviciate in Rome in October that year; certainly in September 1654 he wrote a testament (as Franciscans did before their religious profession), resigning his right of primogeniture and any possible future income to his brother Patrick. He was a priest at St Isidore's College, Rome, in April 1663, and was appointed lecturer in philosophy there on 17 June 1664, and in theology on 8 October 1668 (though he did not teach it until March 1669) and in June 1674 he was acting superior at St Isidore's. He was appointed procurator for the Irish Franciscan province in 1672 and 1684, the year he was declared &#145;lector bis iubilatus&#146;, though the double honour was questioned. He sought to become bishop of Meath following the death of Patrick Plunkett in 1679, and had the anti-religious Meath diocesan statutes corrected by the Holy See in 1686.<br>
<br>In 1674 Porter had published <span class="italic">Securis evangelica ad haeresis radices posita</span>, of which distinctio 9, comprising one-sixth of the work, relied on Bossuet's <span class="italic">Exposition de la doctrine catholique</span> (1671). The anonymous translator of the latter into English (identified as Henry J. Johnson) erroneously stated that Porter had translated it into Irish, a task undertaken instead by Francis Molloy OFM in his <span class="italic">Lucerna fidelium</span>, a third of the second part of which is based on Porter's <span class="italic">Securis evangelica</span>. This long &#145;Axe of the gospels put to the roots of heresy&#146;, a work of controversy, was published in both Rome and Bohemia, first in 1674 and again posthumously in 1722 after an enlarged second edition in Rome, 1687. In it Porter aimed to convict all heretics of atheism using their own principles, and to reduce all Christian debates to the question of the infallibility of the Roman church. He contributed to <span class="italic">Informatio cum favourabili decreto</span> (1676/7) concerning the parentage of the Capuchin friar Francisco Gough de Xerez. By 1679 he was working for a condemnation of Jansenism in Rome and published two further works of controversy or apologetics, <span class="italic">Palinodia religionis praetensae reformatae suam reformationem per propria principia reprobantis</span> (1679) in which he again turned the reformers' principles against themselves, and <span class="italic">Syntagma variarum ecclesiae definitionum</span> (1681), in which he collected condemnations of errors and commented on them. Though printed in the Vatican this latter work was placed on the Index in 1682, by enemies he believed. It was, however, enlarged and republished at Avignon in 1693 in an expensive edition entitled <span class="italic">Systema decretorum dogmaticorum</span>, serving as a useful collection of ecclesiastical decrees (some of Franciscan and Irish interest) in the days before the concise codification of canon law. His brother Patrick, tutor since 1688 to Henry Fitzjames, son of James II and Arabella Churchill, was in Avignon in 1696 and perhaps earlier, and helped with his expenses.<br>
<br>In France on 6 October 1690 Porter was appointed theologian and historian to the exiled James II. In Rome in 1689 he had solemnly blessed a statue of Our Lady of Consolation commissioned by him for the Dublin friary. It never reached Dublin, and is now in the cathedral at St Malo, Brittany, with its history attached; the Porter family had business connections there (<span class="italic">Seanchas Ardmhacha</span>; Lyons, 121). His <span class="italic">Compendium annalium ecclesiasticorum regni Hiberniae</span> (1690), a brief account of Ireland, and of its history from 1532, was written in the Stuart cause, and translated into French by Sebastian Mambre Cramoisy. Later it was used in the contentious chapter 7 of Thomas de Burgo's <span class="italic">Hibernia Dominicana</span> (1792). Porter's very rare pamphlet <span class="italic">Disquisitio theologica, de praesenti foedere inito et continuato cum principe Auriaco</span> may have been published at Rome in 1690.<br>
<br>Further rare works of Porter include <span class="italic">De abolitione consuetudinis praestandi iuramentum reis</span>, published at Rome in 1696, <span class="italic">Opusculum contra vulgares quasdam prophetias de electionibus pontificum S Malachiae</span> (Rome, 1698), a translation (with additions) of the French work of Father Menestrier SJ against the invention of the prophecies of St Malachy concerning the popes, and <span class="italic">Tractatus de amphibologia et restrictione mentali earumque natura et licito usu</span>. He did not write <span class="italic">Interpretatio numeri 666</span> (1677), a translation of <span class="italic">An Interpretation of the Number 666</span> (1642) by Francis Potter. His &#145;Directorium confessarium&#146;, ready for the printer, is in the Franciscan library at Killiney, with his &#145;Exceptiones&#146; to the censuring of it by Francesco M. Campione, and other papers.<br>
<br>Porter died at St Isidore's College, Rome, on 6 April 1702 and was buried there. According to his monument, erected in 1736, he was aged about eighty, but he himself said in 1696 that he was then sixty-four, which gives his age at death as seventy.<br>
