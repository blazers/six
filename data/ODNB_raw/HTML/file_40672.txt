<span class="headword">Burn,  Duncan Lyall</span>  (1902&#150;1988), <span class="occ">economist</span>, was born on 10 August 1902 at Holloway, London, the younger child and younger son of Archibald William Burn, engineer, and his wife, Margaret Anne Mead, who, prior to her marriage, worked as a nanny. He was taught history at Holloway county school by Arthur Bryant and won a scholarship to Christ's College, Cambridge, where he took a first class (division two) in both parts of the history tripos (1923 and 1924). On graduation he won a Wrenbury scholarship, which enabled him to spend a year (1924) as a bachelor research scholar at Christ's. After two years at Liverpool as a university lecturer in economic history (1925&#150;6) he returned to Cambridge in 1927 in the same capacity. There he remained until the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939, living out of Cambridge and with no college attachment. During that time he completed his authoritative study of the British steel industry, <span class="italic">The Economic History of Steelmaking, 1867&#150;1939</span> (1940). He was also a kindly and rigorous supervisor, some of whose students maintained a lifelong friendship with him.<br>
<br>A self-taught economist, Burn never ceased to be an academic, pursuing research in industrial economics throughout his life. He was not much interested in macroeconomics, dismissing demand management after the war as &#145;penny-in-the-slot-economics&#146;. Throughout the war he served with Robert Shone in the iron and steel control of the Ministry of Supply, taking part in the later stages in government planning for the post-war steel industry. In 1946 he did not return to Cambridge but joined <span class="italic">The Times</span> as leader writer and industrial correspondent, continuing in that capacity for the next sixteen years, and displaying an impressive knowledge of industry in Britain and abroad. He won a high reputation in the main industrial countries and maintained close and frequent contact with Jean Monnet, the French economist and politician. He was a natural choice to edit a two-volume study of British industry (<span class="italic">The Structure of British Industry</span>, 1958), and contributed to it chapters on oil and steel, as well as an analytical survey. He continued to write on the steel industry, producing in 1961 a sequel to his earlier book, <span class="italic">The Steel Industry, 1939&#150;59</span>. When re-nationalization was under debate he argued (in <span class="italic">The Future of Steel</span>, 1965) that the proposal misconceived the problems of the industry and misjudged the likely effects. &#145;More scope&#146;, he maintained, &#145;must be given to rebels in management&#146;, who backed far-sighted but unfashionable or unpopular projects.<br>
<br>In 1962 Burn left <span class="italic">The Times</span> and adopted a third career as an industrial consultant, acting for three years as director of the economic development office set up by four leading manufacturers of heavy electric generators. This increased his interest in nuclear energy, on which he wrote extensively over the next fifteen years, beginning with a lengthy study in 1965, after a visit to America, entitled <span class="italic">The Significance of Oyster Creek</span>, the first large boiling water reactor to be ordered. He also acted as consultant to firms in the aircraft and chemical industries, and wrote <span class="italic">Chemicals under Free Trade</span> (1971). He served on a number of official and academic committees such as the economic committee of the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research (1963&#150;5), and had two further spells of academic life as visiting professor at the University of Manchester (1967&#150;9) and the University of Bombay (1971). At his death he had been working for a number of years on his book <span class="italic">The Public Interest</span>.<br>
<br>In 1967 Burn developed his criticisms of British plans for a programme of gas-cooled reactors (AGRs) in <span class="italic">The Political Economy of Nuclear Energy</span>, maintaining that the AGR was well behind light water reactors in performance and likely to fall further behind. By the time he published <span class="italic">Nuclear Power and the Energy Crisis</span> in 1978 it was apparent that, instead of Britain leading the world in nuclear energy as ministers claimed even in the mid-1960s, no British nuclear reactors had ever been built abroad. Burn continued to interest himself in nuclear energy, acting from 1980 until his death as specialist adviser to the House of Commons select committee on energy.<br>
<br>The distinguishing feature of Burn's work was his deep interest in what made for successful industrial and technological development. He stressed the contribution made by competition in encouraging a variety of approaches and allowing scope for differences of opinion. His research was meticulous and quantitative, and aimed to single out the key elements in competitive success. He had many contacts in industry and, as he was a good listener with a retentive memory, he came to have a rare knowledge of expert industrial opinion as well as its divisions and weaknesses. In expressing his own views he was never daunted by the authority or eminence of those from whom he differed. He could be scathing in his criticisms, but his views were well documented and carefully argued.<br>
<br>Burn was short in stature and clean-shaven, with blue eyes and a slightly puckered face. He spoke slowly and quietly, but with assurance, and he enjoyed an argument. Normally serious-minded, he did not lack a sly humour and was given to an occasional quip and twinkle of the eye. On 30 December 1930 he married Jessie Mabel (Mollie), four years his senior and daughter of William Louis White, a chemist who worked in a retail pharmacy. It was an extremely happy marriage, producing two daughters and lasting for nearly sixty years until his death from heart failure on 9 January 1988 in the Royal Free Hospital, London.<br>
