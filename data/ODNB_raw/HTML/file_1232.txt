<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Ballantyne,  Robert Michael</span>  (1825&#150;1894), <span class="occ">author</span>, was born on 24 April 1825 at 25 Ann Street, Edinburgh, the ninth of ten children of Alexander Thomson Ballantyne (1776&#150;1847), newspaper editor and printer, and his wife, Anne, known by her second name, Randall (<i>c</i>.1786&#150;1855), daughter of Dr Robert Grant and his wife, Mary. Ballantyne's father transcribed the manuscripts of Walter Scott's novels to preserve the author's anonymity when they were printed at the Ballantyne press of Ballantyne's uncle, James Ballantyne (1772&#150;1833), and the family's fortunes fell with Scott's financial crisis in 1826. Ballantyne's only formal schooling was a brief period (1835&#150;7) at Edinburgh Academy, his education being completed by his mother and sisters in the bosom of a musical and artistic family. His eldest brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1229/', "James Robert Ballantyne (1813&#150;1864)")</script>, attended East India College, Haileybury, on a scholarship and subsequently edited and translated many works of oriental religion and philosophy; his other brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/64299/', "John Ballantyne (1815&#150;1897)")</script>, an artist, painted the portrait of him which is in the National Portrait Gallery.<br>
<br>At sixteen Robert Ballantyne, the youngest son, signed on for five years with the Hudson's Bay Company, which he served in Rupert's Land and Canada (the modern Canadian provinces of Manitoba, Ontario, and Quebec), travelling extensively by canoe and sleigh and trading with Indians for furs, experiences he described in a journal and in letters home. On return to Edinburgh he took employment as a clerk and only at the suggestion of a family friend revised his journal and letters for publication, with his own illustrations, as <span class="italic">Hudson's Bay, or, Every-Day Life in the Wilds of North America</span> (1848). Some years later, again at the suggestion of another (the publisher William Nelson), Ballantyne used his knowledge of Canada to provide the setting for a story for boys, <span class="italic">Snowflakes and Sunbeams, or, The Young Fur Traders</span> (1856), establishing a pattern for his career as author of boys' adventures set in authentic backgrounds. When he had exhausted his personal experience, he turned to published accounts of travel as sources, most successfully with <span class="italic">The Coral Island: a Tale of the Pacific Ocean</span> (1858), which is the only one of his many tales still read and remembered. He set other works in places he had not visited, such as Brazil (<span class="italic">Martin Rattler</span>, 1858) and equatorial Africa (<span class="italic">The Gorilla Hunters</span>, 1861), but he preferred to write from experience. According to his own autobiographical account, a &#145;blunder&#146; in <span class="italic">The Coral Island</span>, in which he described coconuts growing without husks, &#145;in the same form as that in which they are usually presented to us in grocers' windows&#146;, led him &#145;to visit&#151;when possible&#151;the scenes in which my stories were laid&#146;  (Ballantyne, 13, 15). Many of his later books were indeed based on personal research, which took him 12 miles off the Scottish coast to the Bell Rock for <span class="italic">The Lighthouse</span> (1865) and to the bottom of the Thames in a diving suit for <span class="italic">Under the Waves</span> (1876).<br>
<br>After the death of a sister in 1848 Ballantyne became a regular churchgoer and at twenty-four was elected an elder of the Free Church of Scotland, his firm faith pervading his writing as well as his life. His social conscience and commercial sense were successfully combined in works like <span class="italic">The Lifeboat</span> (1864) and <span class="italic">Fighting the Flames</span> (1867), which simultaneously inspired and thrilled, and in public lectures in which Ballantyne, well built and hirsute, singing in a fine baritone or shooting a stuffed eagle, publicized good causes and his own books. A Scottish lifeboat was gratefully named in his honour, but his principal achievement was his corpus of tales of manly boys in exotic locations, tales which opened to young readers the imperial prospect of a wide world to explore and exploit. Following the lead of Marryat and other previous writers, Ballantyne adapted the <span class="italic">Robinson Crusoe</span> model for Victorian boys and influenced subsequent Scottish writers such as R. L. Stevenson, who admired as a boy Ballantyne's works and their author, &#145;an exceedingly good-looking, dark, full-bearded man&#146;  (Stevenson, 226) he later acknowledged in the verses prefacing <span class="italic">Treasure Island</span> (1883). William Golding's <span class="italic">Lord of the Flies</span> (1954) was a twentieth-century reaction to this whole tradition, and to <span class="italic">The Coral Island</span> in particular.<br>
<br>Ballantyne's boy heroes were not distracted by girls and his own adventures in researching fire brigades and railway trains were not disrupted when he married on 31 July 1866 a minister's daughter, Jane Grant (<i>c</i>.1845&#150;<i>c</i>.1924), with whom he had three sons and three daughters. Control of his copyrights and continuing success afforded Ballantyne the opportunity to move in 1873, for the health of his family, from Edinburgh to Europe, from where he returned to England for his children's education, settling at Harrow in 1879. The vertigo symptomatic of (undiagnosed) M&eacute;ni&egrave;re's disease began to trouble him in 1890 and when this worsened he was unable to complete his autobiography, which was published nevertheless, entitled <span class="italic">Personal Reminiscences</span>, in 1893. He travelled to Italy for an unsuccessful cure in October 1893, died at via del Corso 7, Rome, on 8 February 1894, and was buried there in the protestant cemetery.<br>
