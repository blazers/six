<span class="headword">Forster,  William</span>  (1784&#150;1854), <span class="occ">philanthropist and Quaker minister</span>, was born at Tottenham, Middlesex, on 23 March 1784, the second of the ten children of William Forster (1747&#150;1824), schoolmaster and later land surveyor, and Elizabeth (1759&#150;1837), daughter of Robert and Mary Hayward of Kelvedon, Essex. William senior's father, Josiah (1693?&#150;1763), who hailed from co. Durham, settled in 1752 in Tottenham, a village which was to become a Quaker stronghold and, until 1880, the home of members of the family.<br>
<br>After education at the village schools and with private tutors, William junior learned land surveying in Sheffield with his uncle <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/45592/', "William Fairbank (c.1730&#150;1801)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/57040/', "Fairbank family")</script>]. On returning to Tottenham he joined his father, but in 1806 he was released from business responsibilities and devoted himself to working for the Society of Friends and his various philanthropic concerns. Before he was twenty he had begun to take a vocal part in Quaker worship, and his gift in the ministry was acknowledged by Tottenham monthly meeting in August 1805. Next month he received the meeting's support for the first of a succession of religious visits in Britain, including (1812) the Hebrides. Like other itinerant ministering Friends his concern was not only domestic and pastoral but also to reach a wide audience through specially appointed meetings, often where there was no Quaker presence. This was particularly true of his extensive visit to Ireland (1813&#150;14).<br>
<br>Forster's head and hands were huge and his frame unwieldy; his whole body would shake with emotion and his voice deepen as he gave expression to his feelings. His ministry was evangelical, but his sense of awe was such that he felt it almost profane to talk of religion, and his humanitarian zeal transcended the doctrinal. His intellectual capacity was considerable, but it was the manner of his ministry that was remembered rather than the content. Forster accompanied the American Quaker Stephen Grellet (1773&#150;1855) in visiting London prisons in January 1813, and went with him to Elizabeth Fry to report the appalling conditions on the women's side of Newgate. Her first visit, next day, with clothing for the children was (as were later visits) with Anna Buxton (1784&#150;1855), whom Forster married on 3 October 1816. She was the daughter of Thomas Fowell and Anna (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Hanbury) Buxton of Earls Colne, Essex, and sister of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4247/', "Sir Thomas Fowell Buxton, first baronet")</script>, the anti-slavery protagonist. For two decades they lived at Bradpole, Dorset, but in 1837 moved to Norwich, which was their home until his death.<br>
<br>Forster travelled extensively in North America in 1820&#150;25, viewing with increasing misgiving the growth among Friends there of what he considered unitarian views. His and concurrent visits by George Withy (1763&#150;1837) in 1821, Elizabeth Robson and her brother Isaac Stephenson (1765&#150;1830) in 1823, and Anna Braithwaite in 1824 had the cumulative effect of giving the suspect Elias Hicks (1748&#150;1830) and his many adherents the impression that they were being preached at rather than listened to, and may well have hastened the American Quaker separations of 1827&#150;8.<br>
<br>Forster's second visit to America (1845&#150;6) was with his brother <a href="#cosubject_46946">Josiah [<i>see below</i>]</a>, George Stacey (1786&#150;1857), and John Allen (1790&#150;1859), following a breach in Indiana yearly meeting over the slavery issue: it was perhaps ironic that the anti-slavery militants whom the deputation condemned for separating were, in effect, closer to the views of British Quakers on slavery than the main body, who received the deputation's support.<br>
<br>Irish Quakers, following the 1846 failure of the potato crop, set up on 13 November a central relief committee. Forster spent over four months visiting the worst-stricken districts, especially in Connaught. His knowledge from 1813&#150;14 stood him in good stead, and his reports and contacts, not least with Catholic parish priests, were crucial to the relief committee's work. His son <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9926/', "William Edward Forster")</script> accompanied him for part of the time, as also did James Hack Tuke. For each it was an introduction to a lifetime's concern. Forster and his brothers Josiah and <a href="#cosubject_46949">Robert [<i>see below</i>]</a> also served on a committee of British Friends to arouse awareness of the need and to raise funds.<br>
<br>In 1849 British Quakers drew up a memorial against the continuance of the slave trade: from then until 1852 Forster was on a number of deputations to continental rulers. In 1853, with his brother Josiah, John Candler (1787&#150;1869), and William Holmes (1805&#150;1867), he paid his third American visit. After seeing the president, Franklin Pierce (1804&#150;1869), they travelled through many of the southern and mid-western states, securing interviews with the governors of thirteen of them. Forster died at the home of Samuel Low, near the Holston River, Knox county, East Tennessee, on 27 January 1854, his body being interred in the Friends' burial-ground, Friendsville, Tennessee.<br>
<br>Of William Forster's nine brothers and sisters, one died in childhood. The others remained single except for <a name="cosubject_46946"></a><span class="headword">Josiah Forster</span>  (1782&#150;1870), who in 1808 married Rachel Wilson (1783&#150;1873), daughter of John Wilson (1748&#150;1801) and Sarah, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Dillworth (1754&#150;1788) of Kendal: there was one child, who died aged eleven weeks. In 1805 Josiah opened a school at Southgate, which moved to Tottenham in 1820 and closed in 1826. He had a reputation for na&iuml;vety&#151;as when, confiscating fireworks as dangerous toys, he threw them on the fire to ensure their destruction. But with his adult fellow Quakers, so far from being na&iuml;ve, he could be stentorian and unyielding. He was from 1820 to 1831 clerk (presiding officer) of the yearly meeting of British Quakers, a body he consistently attended from the late eighteenth century until his death, and in which he was an ever more frequent speaker. His wife was recorded as a minister in 1810. In 1811 he was appointed to the meeting for sufferings (the representative committee of the yearly meeting) and in 1817 he became an elder: both offices he held until his death. He frequently accompanied ministering Friends visiting the continent and was an indefatigable correspondent. He was for many years on the committees of the British and Foreign Anti-Slavery Society and of the British and Foreign Bible Society.<br>
<br>Another brother, <a name="cosubject_46949"></a><span class="headword">Robert Forster</span>  (1791&#150;1873)<span class="occ"></span>, carried on the family land surveying business. For many years steward to the earl of Darnley, he managed the Kentish estates during the young earl's minority and built a great part of Northfleet, Kent. Perhaps his most notable Quaker service was as a member of deputations to present to European governments &#145;A plea for liberty of conscience&#146;, drawn up by the yearly meeting of 1856: that year he visited Paris, in 1857 the Netherlands and Germany, and in 1858 Russia and northern Europe. He served as an elder and for many years on the meeting for sufferings. He was a member of the committee of the British and Foreign School Society from 1817 until his death. He was also on the committee of the Quaker school at Croydon, and he and Josiah were longtime members of the London committee for Ackworth School. They were lifelong trustees, and active in the management, of Grove House School, Tottenham, established in 1828 and notable for the part that science had in the curriculum.<br>
<br>In his later years Robert, who suffered a decline of mental powers, was tended by his sister <a name="cosubject_46950"></a><span class="headword">Anne Forster</span>  (1797&#150;1873), whose philanthropic interests extended to the animal kingdom if the ascription to her of the broadside <span class="italic">To Butchers, their Men and Boys</span> (Norwich, n.d.) be correct. <a name="cosubject_46947"></a><span class="headword">Mary Forster</span>  (1786&#150;1873) was with relatives in Plymouth from 1810 to 1834; on her return to Tottenham she devoted herself to visiting women prisoners and in 1837 was appointed an elder. Sarah (1799&#150;1880), who was recorded a minister in 1848, was granted minutes for religious service on seventeen occasions. Most of the sisters' activities were local rather than national, and the family home in Philip Lane, Tottenham Green, was noted for its warm hospitality.<br>
<br>Josiah Forster died on 27 June 1870; and the year 1873 saw the deaths of his widow on 5 March, of Mary on 24 February, Robert on 11 October, and Anne on 14 October. Elizabeth died on 29 March 1879 and Sarah on 14 September 1880. The bodies of all were interred in Tottenham Friends' burial-ground.<br>
