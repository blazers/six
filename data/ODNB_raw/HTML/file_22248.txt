<span class="headword">Pigot, Sir  Robert</span>, second baronet  (1720&#150;1796), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was born on 20 September 1720, probably in Westminster, the fourth but second surviving son of Richard Pigot (<i>bap</i>. 1679, <i>d</i>. 1729) and his wife, Frances (1695&#150;1769), a servant of Caroline, princess of Wales, and daughter of Peter Godde. He was the brother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22244/', "Sir George Pigot, Baron Pigot")</script>, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22246/', "Admiral Hugh Pigot")</script>. Small and sturdily built, he was a brave and competent soldier. He first served with the 31st regiment in Flanders during the War of the Austrian Succession, and was present at the battle of Fontenoy in 1745. In October he returned to England and in 1749 he began a tour of duty in Minorca and Scotland. He was promoted captain on 31 October 1751. In 1758 his battalion of the 31st regiment was transferred to the 70th regiment, and on 5 May he was promoted major. On 1 October 1764 he became lieutenant-colonel of the 38th regiment. He married Anne (<i>d</i>. July 1772), daughter of Allen Johnson, of Kilternan, co. Dublin, on 18 February 1765; they had four children. In 1768 he succeeded his brother George as MP for Wallingford. He was not very active, though he is recorded as having voted with the government on the Middlesex election. He was appointed warden of the Royal Mint in January 1772, but failed to win re-election in Wallingford, and an attempt to return to the Commons at Stafford in 1774 was also unsuccessful.<br>
<br>In 1774 Pigot was ordered to Boston, Massachusetts, with the 38th regiment to help quell the political ferment in America. On 19 April 1775 he accompanied a relief force commanded by Hugh, Earl Percy, sent to support the withdrawal of Lieutenant-Colonel Francis Smith from Lexington and Concord. He distinguished himself in the battle of Bunker Hill on 17 June. The previous night the rebels had constructed a redoubt on Charleston Heights, and General William Howe resolved to remove this threat to his position. Pigot was given command of the army's left wing with the local rank of brigadier-general, while Howe led the right wing in a flanking attack. In a series of direct assaults Pigot and his men broke the Americans' resistance, but with huge losses. For his distinguished service and bravery Pigot was promoted by George III on 11 December to the colonelcy of the 38th regiment. When the British army evacuated Boston in March 1776 Pigot accompanied Howe to Halifax, Nova Scotia. On 27 August he commanded the 2nd brigade in the battle of Long Island, New York.<br>
<br>At the death of his brother George on 11 May 1777 Pigot inherited his baronetcy, his estate at Patshull in Staffordshire, and a one-third share of the famous Pigot diamond, which was valued at &pound;30,000. On 15 July 1777 he took command of the important British garrison at Newport, Rhode Island, and on 29 August he was promoted major-general. In March 1778 he was considered for appointment as Howe's second-in-command, but nothing came of the idea. A bon vivant, he missed the society and entertainments of New York. During August 1778 he struggled tenaciously to defend Newport against combined operations by John Sullivan's army and a French fleet commanded by the Comte d'Estaing. Remaining cool and quiet, according to Sir Henry Clinton, he was rescued on 8 August by the arrival of a British fleet commanded by Admiral Lord Howe and by reinforcements from Clinton three weeks later. On 29 August he fought a sharp battle with Sullivan at Butt's Hill, but was repulsed with heavy losses. He relinquished his command in October and in 1779 returned to England. On 20 November 1782 he was promoted lieutenant-general. He died at Patshull on 2 August 1796 after a long and painful illness. He was succeeded in his title and estate by his eldest son, Lieutenant-Colonel (later Major-General) George Pigot.<br>
