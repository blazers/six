<span class="headword">Stucley,  Thomas</span>  (<em>c.</em>1520&#150;1578), <span class="occ">soldier</span>, was the third of five sons of Sir Hugh Stucley (<i>c</i>.1495&#150;1559) of Affeton Castle, West Worlington, Devon, and his wife, Jane, second daughter of Sir Lewis Pollard. His family was important locally (his father served as sheriff of the county) and had connections with the wider world of Tudor politics. There were contemporary reports that Thomas was an illegitimate son of Henry VIII. He probably attended one of the inns of court, before embarking on a military career. In 1545 he was serving as a soldier in Berwick Castle, and from 1547 he was paid as standard-bearer at Boulogne the substantial sum of 6<i>s</i>. 8<i>d</i>. a day. He was a standard-bearer again on the Scottish borders in 1550 and in May of that year he helped escort the marquis de Maine, a French hostage held in England, when he travelled to Scotland. He accompanied Robert Dudley on an embassy to Henri II at Amboise in April 1551. Stucley was associated with the disgraced duke of Somerset, and this placed him under suspicion with the regime of the duke of Northumberland. Thus on 21 November 1551 the privy council ordered Stucley's arrest, and he fled to France; it was also useful for him to be abroad at this time to escape his creditors.<h2>
<a name="FrenchandHabsburgservice15511557"></a>French and Habsburg service, 1551&#150;1557</h2>In France Stucley entered royal service, and probably played a part in the siege of Metz. He returned to England in August 1552, bearing a letter of recommendation addressed to Edward VI from Henri II. As he delivered the letter Stucley claimed that he had been sent by Henri as a spy, to help the French, who planned to attack Calais and then launch an invasion of England. The English government did not know what to make of this, but after consulting the ambassador in France, who mentioned it to the French king, decided it was a fabrication. In any case the government wished to improve relations with France, so Stucley was put in the Tower of London, where he remained until Mary I released him on 6 August 1553.<br>
<br>Freed from prison Stucley served as a volunteer in the armies of Queen Mary's allies. He was at Brussels in December 1553, and in February 1554 he fought with the emperor's forces at St Omer. He wrote to the queen from St Omer offering her his services and those of his band of soldiers, perhaps to help maintain order at the time of Wyatt's rebellion; he also sent the English government a letter from the French king to his ambassador in England which had been intercepted and might be of value to English security. His military aid not being required in England, Stucley is next found working for Philibert, duke of Savoy, to whom he had been recommended the previous year by Queen Mary. This involved playing a part in the successful military campaigns that Savoy led on behalf of the Habsburgs against the French in Picardy. The duke of Savoy came to England in December 1554, and Stucley accompanied him. He took the precaution of writing to the queen before arriving in England in order to receive a safe conduct to prevent his arrest for debt.<br>
<br>Stucley probably married during this visit. His wife was an heiress, Anne Curtis, granddaughter of the wealthy pewterer Sir Thomas Curtis who later became lord mayor of London. This was clearly a sensible marriage in the light of Stucley's debts. But it did not prevent him getting into financial trouble: in May 1555 the sheriffs of Devon and Cheshire were ordered by the privy council to arrest him on the charge of coining false money. Stucley fled the country, leaving his bride to deal with the difficulties that ensued, and resumed his work for the duke of Savoy. It was probably as part of the English contingent under Lord Pembroke and Lord Dudley that he fought in the great victory over France at St Quentin on 10 August 1557. For a gentleman soldier of the Tudor age this was a highly significant personal achievement.<h2>
<a name="Maritimeactivities15571565"></a>Maritime activities, 1557&#150;1565</h2>Having returned to England, Stucley began the first of his maritime exploits. He acted, it seems, as a privateer, attacking French shipping, a legitimate enterprise once England was at war with France, and one that his Devon connections made easy for him to pursue. But the line between privateering and piracy was thin; there is a suggestion that he had already engaged in attacks on the French before war was declared. On 30 May 1558 he was summoned before the council on the charge of plundering Spanish ships. The court of admiralty, however, found that there was insufficient evidence for Stucley to answer. It is perhaps significant in this connection that Mary employed Stucley late in 1558 to attend a visiting Spanish admiral, the marqu&eacute;s de Saria, when he was at Dartmouth, which suggests that he retained the confidence of the queen, and that the naval dignitaries of her Spanish allies were not averse to him.<br>
<br>Family matters engaged Stucley's attentions in the succeeding months. In 1558 he seized the house of his niece's deceased husband, Serjeant Prideaux, in order to secure the property of his great-nephew, whose wardship he had been granted, partly as a result of a letter of support from the Spanish admiral to the queen. This led to a reprimand from the privy council. The death of his wife's grandfather in November 1559 provided him with much needed cash, which he was not slow to spend. Stucley accommodated himself to the accession of the protestant Queen Elizabeth with little difficulty, and for the first years of her reign he enjoyed her favour. He was engaged in local militia duties in Berkshire in 1560, at a time when war with France and Scotland seemed imminent, and he received very good reports from his superiors for his hard work. In the following year he was a captain in Berwick. In the winter of 1561&#150;2 he helped to entertain Shane O'Neill, the Irish leader, on a visit to England; O'Neill wrote to the queen strongly commending him. In 1562 reports show Stucley to be a supporter of Lord Robert Dudley, engaged in intrigues on his behalf to thwart the possible marriage between Elizabeth and Erik, prince of Sweden.<br>
<br>On 23 June 1563, a fortnight after staging a naval pageant on the Thames for the queen, Stucley sailed off with a small fleet financed jointly by the queen and himself, in the company of the French explorer Jean Ribaut. The expedition was said to be bound for Florida, from which Ribaut had recently returned, although this was probably no more than a cover for the real intention which was to prey on French shipping. Before leaving London Stucley paid a mysterious visit to the Spanish ambassador, apologizing in advance for anything he might do on the voyage to the prejudice of the king of Spain: the ambassador did not know whether to trust Stucley or not. He almost certainly never crossed the Atlantic, but for over a year he attacked shipping off the coast of France and Spain, using ports in Ireland and Devon as bases, and taking time off in between to visit London. He did not discriminate very carefully between enemy and neutral shipping, and attacked two French ships while they were in a Galician port, which drew justifiable complaints from Spain. The queen decided to put a stop to Stucley's adventures and to the piracy of others based in Ireland, largely in order to repair relations with France, and at Michaelmas 1564 gave a commission to Sir Peter Carew, a cousin of Stucley's, to fit out two ships in order to apprehend pirates in the Irish seas. A ship crewed by Stucley's men was taken by Carew in Cork Haven in the spring of 1565, by which time Stucley had himself surrendered to the English authorities in Ireland. He was then sent back to England, and held for a while in ward. Although there was a case entered against him in the court of admiralty and a list of offences drawn up, he was discharged for lack of evidence. He visited the Spanish ambassador to apologize.<h2>
<a name="InIreland15651570"></a>In Ireland, 1565&#150;1570</h2>In view of O'Neill's friendship with Stucley, Cecil sensibly agreed to send him to assist the lord deputy of Ireland, Sir Henry Sidney, who was preparing to send an embassy to O'Neill. This deputation, which finally departed from Dublin with Stucley early in 1566, was intended to persuade O'Neill to come to meet the lord deputy in the pale to negotiate a peace treaty in person. At the same time Stucley and his companions were to sound out O'Neill's true intentions and feelings. As Sidney reported to Cecil, the embassy failed to persuade O'Neill it was safe to come to Dublin, but Stucley and his companions were made aware of O'Neill's dangerous anti-English ambitions. Sidney was most pleased with Stucley's conduct in this matter and for the next four years tried to support his efforts to recover his credit with Elizabeth and make a career for himself in Ireland. In March 1566, with Sidney's strong support, Stucley wrote asking to be permitted to buy from Sir Nicholas Bagenal for the sum of Ir&pound;3000 the important office of marshal of Ireland, and some valuable estates in northern Ireland close to O'Neill's territory. According to Sidney, Stucley hoped to settle in Ireland and was planning to marry the earl of Worcester's sister, his first wife having died about 1564. This scheme did not succeed, but he did marry a rich Irish widow, Elizabeth Peppard, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Popley, about 1566. The queen, however, utterly refused to consider his promotion, and reminded Sidney that Stucley was still out of favour and had a case pending against him in the admiralty court, and therefore should not be given any position of trust in Ireland.<br>
<br>Following this set-back Stucley returned to England, but in 1567 he was back in Ireland, attempting to buy the office of seneschal of Wexford and other positions and lands from Sir Nicholas Heron. He faced the same opposition from Elizabeth in this as he had done before, and she ordered Heron to be reinstated. Heron's death meant that Stucley was able to prevent the complete failure of these schemes for two years, although in 1567 he ceded the barony of Odrone to his old adversary Sir Peter Carew. Despite Sidney's support, Stucley was eventually forced, by the summer of 1569, to relinquish the rest of his claim to Nicholas White, sent from England to take Heron's place. White arrived in Dublin and had Stucley committed to prison, charged with obstructing his rights but also with using coarse language against the queen and supporting Irish rebels. Stucley was in Dublin Castle for eighteen weeks, and then released for lack of evidence. Being ousted a second time seems to have been decisive in shifting Stucley, increasingly ambiguous over the last few years, into a position of open disloyalty to the queen.<h2>
<a name="FlighttoSpain1570"></a>Flight to Spain, 1570</h2>The years 1569&#150;70 were very difficult for the Elizabethan regime, with rebellion in northern England, the publication of the papal bull of excommunication, and hostility from Catholic Spain. These wider opportunities for sedition chimed in with Stucley's personal grudges, a yearning for more adventure, and probably also a long-felt sympathy for the old religion. Released in October 1569 and still enjoying the friendship of Sidney, Stucley began to prepare a vessel for his departure from Ireland, claiming that he would sail for England. While these preparations were proceeding, he sounded out both the Spanish and French ambassadors. He then set out for Spain, arriving at Viviero on 24 April 1570. He was favourably received in Madrid, where Jane, the English-born duchess of Feria, and her husband provided him with influential support. This charming old soldier, with his eight-year-old son, William, was soon very much at home at the Spanish court. He was given a pension and a house in a nearby village, was enrolled as a knight of the order of Calatrava, and was generally addressed as duke of Ireland. But Stucley faced difficulties in persuading Philip II to equip an expedition to Ireland. Throughout most of the 1570s the king was attempting to improve relations with England. In any case, Irish exiles in Europe were dubious about Stucley and had their own schemes which they hoped to sell to the Spanish. Nevertheless Philip's caution and hospitality meant that he would never completely dismiss Stucley. From the perspective of the English government he was a real threat once in exile, and Elizabeth used a number of diplomatic channels to try to remove his Spanish support. There were repeated rumours in London in the 1570s that he was about to launch an attack on Ireland.<br>
<br>In April 1571, having received no real promises of Spanish support, Stucley left for Rome to enlist aid there and was again very well received. It was typical of Stucley that he should have played a part, while waiting for his Irish plans to mature, as captain of three galleys in the great victory of the Spanish over the Turks at Lepanto in October 1571. He then returned to Spain, and continued to urge Philip II to use his triumphant naval forces to attack England. In early 1572 he was in Paris, then back in Spain, where he made his base, by now something of a hero. In 1575 there were rumours that he was once more in England, but he was certainly in Rome in autumn and winter that year, when the pope granted him the right to sell indulgences commemorating the jubilee to raise cash for his English enterprise. In 1576 he made the pilgrimage to Loreto. By this time Stucley had received promises in Rome and Madrid of support for a limited expedition to Ireland of the sort that he eventually led two years later. In 1577, however, these plans were shelved, and he travelled twice to Flanders from Rome, where the new Spanish governor and his former companion-in-arms, Don John of Austria, was contemplating a major invasion of England, and there seemed a real chance of Spanish support.<h2>
<a name="ThebattleofAlcazar1578"></a>The battle of Alcazar, 1578</h2>The death of Don John put an end to any real prospect of a Spanish invasion of Ireland or England, and Rome was now Stucley's only hope. The pope was enthusiastic, but had little to offer in terms of major military support. The situation was complicated by divisions among the exiled English Catholics in Rome, many of whom distrusted Stucley, as did Irish Catholic exiles. However, it was at last settled that the scheme first agreed by Stucley and Pope Gregory XIII in 1576 was to be implemented, and Stucley seemed now to have the support of James fitz Maurice Fitzgerald, the leading Irish exile. The pope and Philip II provided enough money to equip a force of perhaps 700 English and Irish exiles, Italian bandits, and sundry soldiers, some press-ganged by Stucley himself. He set off from Civita Vecchia in February 1578 in the <i>San Juan</i> of Genoa, a ship of 800 tons, which after a minor mutiny among the crew arrived by easy stages at Lisbon in May. Here King Sebastian, who was desperate, despite all his advisers, to attack the Moors of north Africa, persuaded Stucley to join him in that enterprise, in clear contravention of his papal instructions and despite the strong opposition of the papal nuncio in Lisbon. Stucley had his reasons for being thus diverted from his Irish course: his ship was leaky, and Sebastian had told him that when they had defeated the Moors they would sail together in a Portuguese fleet to Ireland. Stucley had far more military skill than Sebastian, and when they had crossed into Africa and he saw the size of the Moorish forces ranged against them, he advised against immediate fighting. Having been overruled by the foolhardy king he fought bravely at the battle of Alcazar on 4 August 1578. He was killed early in the battle, with both legs shot off by a cannon, and the Portuguese expedition was overwhelmed by the vastly superior Moorish cavalry.<br>
<br>Stucley's life became a subject for balladeers and dramatists, who saw him as a hero whose martial reputation was enhanced by his notoriety. The duke of Northumberland said of him as early as 1552: &#145;I dare say there is not in Italy or Christendom a better soldier of his time&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1547&#150;53</i>, 713). He was certainly a brave and intelligent soldier, but he was also devious and he loved the limelight. Burghley accused him of &#145;the highest degree of vain-glory, prodigality, falsehood, and vile and filthy conversation of life &hellip; altogether without faith, conscience, or religion&#146;  (Simpson, 136). Yet before he went to Spain his record had not been worse than that of a number of his flamboyant contemporaries. It is a mystery why Elizabeth withdrew her favour so comprehensively in 1566, when Stucley had the support in Ireland of the deputy, and indeed at that stage the support of the future Lord Burghley, and when he was clearly the sort of tough frontiersman required to help subdue the island. But her decision was the turning point in Stucley's career, and its apparent unfairness helps to justify his move into open treason in 1570. Whether Elizabeth's suspicions and Stucley's intemperate response to them really did stem from a belief that he was her half-brother is an interesting and unanswerable question.<br>
