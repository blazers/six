<span class="headword">Kenyon,  John</span>  (1784&#150;1856), <span class="occ">patron of the arts and poet</span>, was born in December 1784 in the parish of Trelawney, Jamaica, the eldest of three sons of John Kenyon (Kennion), wealthy sugar plantation owner, and his wife, a daughter of John Simpson of Bounty Hall. After the death of his wife in 1789, Kenyon's father brought John and his brothers Edward and Samuel to England, probably to the vicinity of Chester. On the death of their father about 1792, the boys' uncle Samuel Kenyon became their guardian and custodian of their considerable property. As a youth, John attended schools at Cheshunt (where Robert Browning's father was a fellow student), Fort Bristol, and Charterhouse School, London. He also received tutoring in science by William Nicholson of the Philosophical Institute. Kenyon matriculated at Peterhouse, Cambridge, in 1802, but left without a degree in 1803 or 1808. He entered Lincoln's Inn in 1804.<br>
<br>Kenyon lived at Woodlands, between Alfoxden and Nether Stowey, between 1802 and 1812, and became acquainted with Thomas Poole, S. T. Coleridge, Robert Southey, and William Wordsworth. He also married in this period. His wife's death at Naples in 1818 terminated their European tour, begun in 1815. After his second marriage, to Caroline Curteis of Lewisham in 1822, Kenyon and his wife made Bath their headquarters, with frequent visits to London and the channel resorts until they left for a year in Italy in 1830 when they became acquainted with the Landors at Fiesole. On their return to London, the couple probably established themselves at 39 Devonshire Place, the home of Caroline's wealthy brother John Curteis, until her death on 6 August 1835.<br>
<br>A seasoned traveller and a lion of London society, Kenyon made his home a mecca for the intelligentsia and for foreign travellers, especially Americans. Several names suggest the scope of his guest list: Charles Babbage, Charles Dickens, Benjamin Haydon, Charles Macready, Sir Anthony Panizzi, Bryan Procter, and Henry Crabb Robinson. A close friend of Elizabeth Barrett, his distant cousin, and of Robert Browning, Kenyon was influential in igniting their famous correspondence and courtship and supported their marriage. To Kenyon, Browning dedicated his <span class="italic">Dramatic Romances and Lyrics</span>. Failing to procure for Kenyon a copy of the picture of <span class="italic">Andrea del Sarto and his Wife</span> in the Pitti Palace, Browning wrote and sent to him from Florence the poem &#145;Andrea del Sarto&#146;. When the Brownings visited England, Kenyon offered them his home and there in 1856 Elizabeth Barrett Browning finished &#145;Aurora Leigh&#146; and dedicated it to Kenyon in grateful remembrance of a friendship &#145;far beyond the common uses of mere relationship and sympathy of mind&#146;. Another friend of several years was Sarah Bayley, a prominent Unitarian and intellectual, who aroused feelings of admiration and spiritual kinship in Kenyon on his first meeting her at Rome and Naples in 1840; she was to see him through his painful illness and death.<br>
<br>Kenyon's encounters with George Ticknor and Edward Everett in Paris in 1817 promoted his acquaintance with increasing numbers of Americans whom he entertained and aided with letters of introduction. James T. Fields, George Hillard, Charles Eliot Norton, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, and James Lowell were guests at his renowned breakfast and dinner parties, as were Daniel Webster and his family whom Kenyon escorted to Oxford on the occasion of Webster's speech at the agricultural meeting in July 1839. Indeed, his later claim to fame rested largely on his generosity; his favourite role of host fostered his aptitude for arranging fruitful introductions, which in turn contributed to his popularity and extended his influence. Kenyon's reputation as a wealthy dilettante with a genial disposition and generous purse was universally acknowledged. Crabb Robinson's remark about Kenyon's having the &#145;face of a Benedictine monk and joyous talk of a good fellow&#146; is legendary. The author of the obituary in the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> (March 1857) emphasizes his acts of charity; George Hillard in his letter to the <span class="italic">Boston Daily Courier</span> (9 March 1857), while noting him to be &#145;remembered more for what he did than for what he wrote&#146;, stressed his qualities as a scholar and gentleman.<br>
<br>Kenyon published three volumes of poetry: <span class="italic">A Rhymed Plea for Tolerance</span> (1833), a strong statement of his liberal religious thinking rather than an imaginative effort; <span class="italic">Poems, for the Most Part Occasional</span> (1838); and <span class="italic">A Day at Tivoli, with Other Verses</span> (1849). The prefaces and many of the poems, aptly called &#145;occasional&#146;, reflect his inherent modesty and familiarity with English literature and its backgrounds. His poem, &#145;Champagne ros&eacute;e&#146; appeared in the <span class="italic">Oxford Book of English Verse</span> in 1939.<br>
<br>Kenyon's reputation for generosity is confirmed by his will with its lengthy list of legacies which included &pound;5000 to University College Hospital, &pound;10,500 to the Brownings, and &pound;5000 and Lime Cottage at Wimbledon to Miss Bayley.<br>
<br>Kenyon died at his home, 3 Parade, West Cowes, on 3 December 1856, probably of cancer, although the death certificate reads &#145;natural decay&#146;. His remains were interred in the Curteis family vault in St Mary's churchyard, Lewisham.<br>
