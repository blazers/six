<span class="headword">Welsh,  John</span>  (1824&#150;1859), <span class="occ">meteorologist</span>, eldest son of George Welsh of Craigenputtoch, and his wife, Margaret Kissock, was born at Boreland, Kirkcudbrightshire, on 27 September 1824. His father, who held a small estate which had been long in the family, died in 1835 and his mother settled at Castle Douglas, where Welsh received his early education. In November 1839 he entered the University of Edinburgh with a view to becoming a civil engineer, and studied under professors Philip Kelland, James David Forbes, and Robert Jameson. In December 1842 Sir Thomas Brisbane, on the advice of Forbes, engaged Welsh as an observer at his magnetical and meteorological observatory at Makerstoun under John Allan Broun, then director. In 1850, the magnetic observations being terminated, Welsh was appointed assistant to Francis Ronalds, superintendent at Kew observatory. Welsh read, at the Ipswich meeting of the British Association in October 1851, a report on Ronalds's three magnetographs, and described two sliding rules which he had devised for reducing hygrometrical and magnetic observations. In 1852 he read an important report on the methods used in graduating and comparing standard instruments at the Kew observatory, and subsequently standard thermometers and barometers destined for scientific use were verified and certificated at the observatory.<br>
<br>Ronalds retired in 1852 and Welsh succeeded him as superintendent of the observatory. Between August and November 1852 Welsh and Charles Green made four balloon ascents from Vauxhall in order to make meteorological observations. In March and May 1854 Welsh and the barometer maker Alexander Adie made several voyages to investigate and remedy the pumping, or motion, of mercury in marine barometers. In 1855 Welsh supervised at the Paris Exhibition the exhibit of magnetic and meteorological instruments used at Kew. In 1856 he began at Kew a series of monthly determinations of absolute magnetic intensity and magnetic dip with instruments provided by General Edward Sabine. In the same year a set of self-recording magnetic instruments was constructed, based on the models devised originally by Ronalds and improved by Welsh.<br>
<br>In 1857 Welsh was elected FRS. In the same year, the society's Kew committee having decided on a magnetic survey of the British islands, Welsh was appointed to undertake the north British division, and he spent part of the summers of 1857 and 1858 on this work. But he suffered from lung disease during the intervening winter and this became worse during the following year. Acting under medical advice he spent the winter of 1858&#150;9, accompanied by his mother, at Falmouth, and died there, at Woodlane Terrace, on 11 May 1859.<br>
