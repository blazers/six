<span class="headword">Denison,  Joseph</span>  (<em>c.</em>1726&#150;1806), <span class="occ">banker</span>, was probably the elder son of Joseph Denison, cloth merchant, of Burmantofts Hall, Leeds, and his first wife, Rebecca, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Wainman. Nineteenth-century accounts of Denison's life, seeking to contrast his great wealth in later life and the fine marriages of his daughters with his humble origins, went so far as to assert he was &#145;a parish boy, ignorant of reading and writing, who made his way from Yorkshire up to London on foot&#146;  (Taylor, 231). Certainly, identification is not made easier by the fact that the name of Denison was extremely common in the Leeds area, and no evidence of Denison's baptism there has been unearthed. Nevertheless, given that rags to riches was a rare phenomenon in Georgian England, a mercantile background seems more plausible.<br>
<br>Reputedly, Denison became a clerk in the counting-house of an Irish Catholic merchant (Dillon) before starting out on his own account. He was connected with the Liverpool banking firm of Heywood, acting as their London agent and eventual partner, as well as handling the accounts of other large-scale north-country merchants and bankers. By the 1780s he had made a very considerable fortune, the reward, according to Taylor, of &#145;unabated industry and the most rigid frugality&#146;  (Taylor, 231). In fact, little is known of Denison's banking activities. But his success was evident enough. In 1787 he purchased Denbies in Surrey, built by Jonathan Tyers, the celebrated proprietor of Vauxhall Gardens; five years later he acquired, for around &pound;100,000, the east Yorkshire estates of the duke of Leeds.<br>
<br>Joseph Denison was twice married. His first wife, Sarah, was the daughter of William Sykes of Salford. After her death in 1768 he married Elizabeth (1738/9&#150;1771), the daughter of William Butler, variously described as merchant of Lisbon and Southwark hatter. The second marriage produced a son and two daughters, before Elizabeth's early death. Their son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7491/', "William Joseph Denison (1770&#150;1849)")</script>, continued his father's banking business, becoming senior partner in Denison, Heywood, and Kennard. W. J. Denison was high sheriff of Yorkshire in 1808, MP for Camelford (1796&#150;1802), Kingston upon Hull (1806&#150;7) and, surviving eight elections to become father of the house, MP for the western division of Surrey from 1818 until his death in 1849. His estate, reckoned to be worth a colossal &pound;2.3 million, and realizing &pound;80,000 a year, passed to his nephew, Lord Albert Denison Conyngham (created Baron Londesborough in 1850). By 1883 the latter's son, who became the first earl of Londesborough in 1887, was the largest landowner in the East Riding of Yorkshire, with 52,655 acres.<br>
<br>However, the fame of Joseph Denison's elder daughter surpassed that of her brother. Elizabeth Denison [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/45483/', "Conyngham, Elizabeth")</script>] married Henry Burton Conyngham: she achieved notoriety as George IV's avaricious, overweight mistress, acquiring a marquessate for her husband (lord steward of the king's household), a barony (Wenlock) for the husband of her younger sister, Anna Maria, and a peerage (which he declined) for her brother, William Joseph. By the early nineteenth century, the wealth and social range of the Denisons was a byword in Regency England. Both were founded on Joseph Denison's extraordinary assiduity as a banker. He died at home in the parish of St Mary Axe, London, on 12 December 1806, aged, according to his obituary in <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span>, about eighty. He was buried in Bunhill Fields, just outside the City of London.<br>
