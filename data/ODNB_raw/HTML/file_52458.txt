<span class="headword">Henty,  Edward</span>  (1810&#150;1878), <span class="occ">pioneer colonist in Australia</span>, and his brother <a name="cosubject_52458"></a><span class="headword">Stephen Henty</span>  (1811&#150;1872) were born respectively, on 28 March 1810 and 3 November 1811, the fourth and fifth surviving sons of Thomas Henty (1775&#150;1839), a farmer and latterly a banker from West Tarring, near Worthing, Sussex, and Frances Elizabeth Hopkins (<i>c</i>.1776&#150;1847) of Poling, near Arundel, Sussex. They were educated locally before working on the family farm. Thinking their prospects better in Australia than in agriculturally depressed Sussex, the family decided to emigrate, and sent the eldest son James (1800&#150;1882) with Stephen and their younger brother John to Western Australia in 1829 to establish a farm.<br>
<br>Finding Western Australia unpropitious farming country, James recommended they relinquish the land granted to them, in the hope of receiving in exchange a smaller grant in Van Diemen's Land. Although the Colonial Office had already refused this request, in November 1831, his father, mother, Edward, and two other brothers sailed for Launceston, Van Diemen's Land, where they landed in April 1832. The colonial government naturally followed the Colonial Office in refusing a land grant, but the father bought a 2000 acre farm on the Tamar, where the brothers worked and the family settled. However, grazing land was expensive, so Edward began to think of other activities and other places. In April 1833 he joined a whaling ship, but soon transferred to the family's schooner, <i>Thistle</i> (58 tons); when she called at Portland Bay on the Australian mainland in July he was impressed by its possibilities for settlement. In March 1834 James sailed for London to seek permission to buy 20,000 acres at Portland Bay to be paid for over ten years, but Edward persuaded his father to allow him to &#145;squat&#146; at Portland without waiting for an answer to their request. This was a formal &#145;no&#146; but it was made known unofficially that the Hentys would not be ejected.<br>
<br>On 13 October 1834 Edward left Launceston in the <i>Thistle</i>, and after an extremely stormy voyage in which much of the livestock was lost he landed at Portland Bay on 19 November with four indentured servants, thirteen heifers, two working bullocks, six dogs, plants, provisions, building materials, and farm implements. Edward began to build his house and to plant his fruit, vegetables, and wheat; a month later he welcomed his youngest brother, Francis (1815&#150;1889), who arrived with more livestock (including the first thoroughbred merino sheep in Victoria), plants, and stores. In September 1836 Stephen arrived, having finally left Western Australia, with his bride, Jane (1817&#150;1906), the daughter of an East India Company captain, Walter Pace, whom he had married on 14 April 1836 at Fremantle. In 1837 Francis and Stephen moved inland, but Edward preferred to continue farming and trading at Portland. On 15 October 1840 he bought 20 acres of suburban land. The following day he married Anne Maria, the daughter of Hugh Gallie of Plymouth, whom he had met when he was in Melbourne on business; the couple had no children.<br>
<br>By then Edward was an established citizen and magistrate, but he soon began to suffer from the prevailing economic depression. When the family businesses were reorganized in 1842, Francis took the 14,000 acre Merino Downs and Edward moved to Muntham, a sheep station of 57,300 acres on the Wannon River, which in 1849 carried 3520 cattle and 24,000 sheep. This made him a prosperous squatter, but in 1856 he moved back to live in Portland. He sat in the legislative assembly as a conservative until 1861 and became actively involved in the Western Victorian Separation League, which advocated breaking away from &#145;the intolerable yoke of Melbourne&#146;. Unfortunately his stock gradually deteriorated, and when sold after his death none was fit to breed from. Like Stephen, Edward had moved permanently to a large town house in Melbourne. He died at Offington, St Kilda Road, Melbourne, on 14 August 1878 and was buried the next day in Boroondara cemetery. Stephen, a merchant and magistrate at Portland and an MP from 1856 to 1870, had died on 18 December 1872 at Hamilton, leaving four sons and six daughters. He was buried in the cemetery there.<br>
<br>Edward was the first permanent settler at Portland. At first capable and energetic, he became somewhat extravagant and socially pretentious as he played the part of the country squire, but though Francis at Merino Downs and Stephen as Portland's leading merchant may have done more for the district's progress, Edward's distinction of &#145;being the first&#146; remains.<br>
