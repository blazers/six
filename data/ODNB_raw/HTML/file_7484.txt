<span class="headword">Denis, Sir  Peter</span>, baronet  (<em>c.</em>1713&#150;1778), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, was born at Chester, the eleventh of twelve children of Revd Jacob Denis, or Dennis as he was known in England (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1667, <i>d</i>. before 1746), a Huguenot who had fled from France after the revocation of the edict of Nantes, and Martha Leach (<i>c</i>.1669&#150;1746), originally from Manchester. His father became a naval chaplain in 1718, and Peter, who retained the surname Denis, entered the navy as chaplain's servant to his father on 9 June 1724 in the <i>Success</i> (Captain Isaac Townshend), succeeding Robert Denis, probably a brother, who seems later to have become a purser. In 1728 he entered the <i>Tartar</i> as able seaman and became midshipman ordinary and then midshipman. After spells in the <i>York</i>, he became mate in the <i>Hound</i>, but he left her &#145;for preferment&#146; in May 1734. Although he passed for lieutenant on 16 October 1734 he next appears only in 1739 when appointed lieutenant to the <i>Centurion</i> and then the <i>Wager</i>, both ships being in the squadron dispatched under George Anson against Spanish possessions in South America. Anson brought Denis back to the <i>Centurion</i>, where he proved a useful officer, his activities including detached services. As with most of the <i>Centurion</i>'s officers, he was promoted soon after his return, becoming captain on 9 February 1745 at a time when Anson was called to the Board of Admiralty; Denis also became Anson's political follower.<br>
<br>In 1746 Denis commanded the <i>Windsor</i> (60 guns) and in 1747 his old ship, the <i>Centurion</i>, with a reduced armament of 50 guns. In her he took part in Anson's action with De la Jonqui&egrave;re, and afterwards carried home Anson's dispatches. In the autumn he joined the fleet under Rear-Admiral Edward Hawke, but not until after the defeat of L'Etendu&egrave;re. On 2 September 1750 he married Elizabeth (<i>c</i>.1721&#150;1765), illegitimate daughter of John James Heidegger; they had no children. In 1754 he was elected MP for the borough of Hedon in Yorkshire, but he was to attend only rarely. Early in the following year he was appointed to command the <i>Medway</i> (60 guns). In her he continued on the home station during 1756, and he sat as a member of the court martial which tried and condemned Admiral John Byng. In 1757 he had command of the <i>Namur</i> (90 guns) which formed part of the fleet under Hawke in the unsuccessful expedition against Rochefort, Denis being one of those appointed to survey the coast. In 1758 he commanded the <i>Dorsetshire</i> (70 guns), in which he captured, after a sharp action, the French ship <i>Raisonnable</i> (64 guns) on 19 April, and the following year shared in the great victory in Quiberon Bay, the <i>Dorsetshire</i> being the first to engage. In March 1760 he was moved to the <i>Thunderer</i>, and in August 1761 he commanded the yacht <i>Charlotte</i> as flag-captain to Lord Anson, on the voyage which took to England George III's bride, Princess Charlotte of Mecklenburg. He continued to command the yacht until 18 October 1770, when he was promoted rear-admiral of the blue, having been made a baronet on 19 September 1767. In the spring of 1771 he was commander-in-chief of the <i>Medway</i>, and in the summer he went out to the Mediterranean, with his flag in the <i>Trident</i>. His command there was uneventful. After his return he was advanced to vice-admiral of the blue on 31 March 1775. Sir Peter lived with his wife in Queen Square, London, and later at Valence, near Westerham. Following Elizabeth's death on 30 December 1765 he moved to Maze Hill House, Greenwich. He died vice-admiral of the red on 12 June 1778 at his Greenwich home. At the time of his death Denis also had a house in Percy Street, London, and land in Romney Marsh. His will shows him to have had considerable means&#151;he made bequests of &pound;12,600, to numerous friends and also to many charities, as well as his property, much of which he left to his sister Anne, and he had shares in the Pantheon and the opera house in London and the public assembly rooms, Bath. Unfortunately nothing comes through of his character, though he was clearly a competent commander.<br>
