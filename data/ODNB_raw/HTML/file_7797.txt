<span class="headword">Donald,  Adam</span> <span class="st"> [<em>called </em> the Prophet of Bethelnie]</span>  (1703&#150;1780), <span class="occ">spiritualist</span>, was born into a poor family of peasant farmers at the hamlet of Bethelnie, 20 miles north of Aberdeen. Despite an extraordinarily large stature and build, which caused him to be regarded as a changeling, Donald was unable to use his hands for work. Required to find an alternative source of income, Donald &#145;affected an uncommon reservedness of manner, pretended to be extremely studious, spoke little, and what he said was uttered in half sentences, with awkward gesticulations and an uncouth tone of voice, to excite consternation and elude detection&#146;  (<span class="italic">Life and Character</span>). Though scarcely able to read, he was said to have studied books in all languages, and to have been particularly knowledgeable of John Gerard's <span class="italic">The Herball, or, Generall Historie of Plants</span> (1597). He made, too, a practice of haunting the ruined church of Bethelnie, where he was thought to converse with and learn from the dead.<br>
<br>Donald's supposed necromancy meant that he was frequently questioned about inexplicable occurrences in his community and his talent for generalized advice meant that his comments often appeared prophetic. He also acted as a quack physician and dealt principally with lingering disorders supposed to owe their origin to witchcraft. His prescriptions invariably required the application of certain unguents of his own making to various parts of the body. This was to be accompanied by particular ceremonies, described in minute detail and intended to confirm his mystical persona. Donald's assumed character provided both popularity and financial security. His house was frequently crowded with visitors seeking cures or details of their futures, for which he charged a maximum of 1<i>s</i>. Such was his fame that he was asked to sit for a full-length portrait, which was later engraved. To relieve the boredom of sitting he composed the prophetic lines:<blockquote>
<div>Time doth all things devour,<br>
</div>
<div>And time doth all things waste.<br>
</div>
<div>And we waste time,<br>
</div>
<div>And so are we at last.<br>
</div>
</blockquote>In later life Donald persuaded a local woman, details of whom are unknown, to marry him on account of his powers, the limitations of which proved difficult to hide in an intimate relationship. His artifice, while kept secret by his wife, was exposed by his daughter who openly mocked him. Donald died in 1780.<br>
