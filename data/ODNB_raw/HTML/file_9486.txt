<span class="headword">Fish,  Simon</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1531), <span class="occ">religious controversialist</span>, was born according to some accounts in Kent. It has been claimed that he attended Oxford University, but there is no conclusive evidence for this, and the first event that can be approximately dated in his life is his entering Gray's Inn about 1525. Very few details survive of his career, but it is clear that, following his arrival in London, Fish forged fraternal bonds with other like-minded young men, some of whom would come to be prime movers of the English Reformation. His participation in the performance at Gray's Inn of a Christmas play satirizing Cardinal Wolsey during the 1526&#150;7 season aroused the cardinal's wrath, and forced Fish into a first period of exile in the Low Countries. After his return to London Fish continued to challenge the cardinal's authority by smuggling proscribed books, including Tyndale's <span class="roman">New Testament</span>, and distributing them from his house by the Whitefriars. This activity again provoked Wolsey's ire, and prompted Fish to withdraw once more to the relative safety of the continent late in 1527. It was during this second exile that he translated and published at Antwerp <span class="italic">The Sum of Holy Scripture</span> (<span class="italic">STC</span>, 2nd edn, 3036) from a French version of Henricus Bomelius's <span class="italic">Summa der godliker scrifturen</span>, and penned his famous satire against purgatory and the intercessory clergy entitled <span class="italic">Supplication for the Beggars</span>.<br>
<br>This short and violently anti-clerical tract challenged the existence of purgatory and presented cruel and wildly exaggerated accounts of clerical abuses done in the name of the souls, and in doing so introduced new strategies for controversial debate into the early stages of the English Reformation. Fish's treatise was first printed at Antwerp, possibly by J. Grapheus, but its exact date of publication remains uncertain (<span class="italic">STC</span> 10883). According to dubious and contradictory accounts contained in John Foxe's <span class="italic">Acts and Monuments</span>, the <span class="italic">Supplication</span> was introduced into England by either of two means. In one account Anne Boleyn presented a copy of the book to Henry VIII who &#145;kept the book in his bosom for three or four days&#146; and who then embraced Fish &#145;with a loving countenance&#146; when he appeared at court, took him hunting for several hours, and gave him a signet ring to protect him from his enemies. In an alternative account that diminished Fish's importance significantly, Foxe reported that the <span class="italic">Supplication</span> came into the hands of two London merchants, George Robinson and George Elyot, who then showed their copy to the king  (<span class="italic">Acts and Monuments</span>, 4.656&#150;8).<br>
<br>From these tales it has been suggested that the <span class="italic">Supplication</span> was printed sometime late in 1528 or early in 1529, arrived in London soon afterwards, and began to circulate during the spring and summer of 1529. Certainly, the tract was freely available by November, as on the first day of the Reformation Parliament copies of Fish's <span class="italic">Supplication</span> were &#145;scattered at the procession in Westminster&#146; and distributed throughout the city's streets  (<span class="italic">Acts and Monuments</span>, 4.659, 666&#150;7). The first edition of the text to be published in England appeared seventeen years later, and was most likely produced by London's influential protestant printers John Day and William Seres, who bound it together with Henry Brinkelow's <span class="italic">A Supplication of the Poor Commons</span> (<span class="italic">STC</span> 10884). Later editions were made available in 1680 in a revised version entitled <span class="italic">The Very Beggars Petition Against Popery</span> (<span class="italic">STC</span> F983) and in F. J. Furnivall's collection of Reformation-era treatises prepared for the Early English Text Society in 1871.<br>
<br>Couched in the form of a plea coming from the outcasts of society and directed to the king, Fish's <span class="italic">Supplication</span> was a sensational call for Henry to undertake a policy to save his kingdom from falling into the hands of Rome. Making no pretensions to a spirit of even-handedness or reconciliation, the lepers, sick, needy, and impotent on whose behalf Fish wrote all cried out to the king that they were dying of hunger because of the holy beggars and vagabonds who had taken into their hands fully one-third of the kingdom. In exchange for all these riches, the clerics claimed that they alone could deliver souls out of purgatory; yet as Fish pointed out, learned men had challenged the existence of such a place, and had argued that it was merely an invention of the covetous Roman church.<br>
<br>In framing this critique, Fish was among the first English humanists to link popular pamphleteering, already practised elsewhere by reform-minded writers, with the royal interests. Previous to the problems raised by Henry VIII's divorce struggle, the English humanist community was primarily academic, and its writers and rhetoricians were regarded as useful and prestigious adjuncts to the princely court. The king's pressing needs demanded innovations; thus Fish crafted the <span class="italic">Supplication</span> for a readership that included not only the political &eacute;lite but the whole of the English people. The work's depiction of the English clergy as parasites and traitors certainly was designed to appeal to Henry's desire to subjugate the clergy, and to reinforce his growing conviction of his own power over cleric and layman alike in the realm. Its brevity and satirical tone, however, were also designed to appeal to readers who might struggle to follow the often complex theological and political debates in more lengthy and sophisticated tomes and who could ill afford the expense of such books. In this regard Thomas More's refutation of Fish's text was telling. His <span class="italic">Supplication of Souls</span> (<span class="italic">STC</span> 18092), published at London before 25 October 1529 by William Rastell, was more than ten times the length of Fish's work, and its point-by-point rebuttal, of a kind appropriate to learned debate, although movingly written, failed to attain the rhetorical power of Fish's more populist tract.<br>
<br>During 1529 Fish returned to England and took up residence within the precincts of London, where he found himself accused of heresy, and saw his book condemned by Archbishop Warham. According to More, Fish experienced a change of heart following his return from exile, so that he &#145;repented himself, and came into the church again&#146;  (<span class="italic">English Works</span>, 881). The nature of Fish's opinions at this stage remain unknown, since he was struck down by plague while in London, dying suddenly in 1531. After his death his widow married James Bainham, an outspoken proponent of reform who was himself burnt as a heretic in April 1532.<br>
