<span class="headword">Thorkell the Tall</span> <span class="st"> [&THORN;orkill inn H&aacute;vi]</span>, earl of East Anglia  (<em>fl. </em>1009&#150;1023), <span class="occ">viking leader, magnate, and regent</span>, was, according to saga tradition, the son of Str&uacute;t Harald, earl of Sj&aelig;lland, and the brother of Sigvaldi, the supposed leader of the J&oacute;msvikings. He may have been married to a daughter of &AElig;thelred II the Unready, whom sources variously name as Edith or Wulfhild. In August 1009, after an adventurous early career in Scandinavia, Thorkell arrived off the coast of Sandwich with a large fleet intent upon pillage. He immediately joined forces with other viking chieftains then operating in England, including his brother Hemingr, and for the next three years plundered towns and villages in Kent, Essex, East Anglia, Wessex, and the eastern midlands. The English response to the threat, which included a programme of public prayer and penance, proved ineffectual and in 1011 King &AElig;thelred II agreed to pay &pound;48,000 to the raiders as tribute (<i>gafol</i>), in return for peace. In September 1011, however, while the money was being raised, Thorkell's forces seized Canterbury and took its archbishop, &AElig;lfheah, captive. The archbishop's refusal to pay ransom led to his martyrdom on 19 April 1012 at the hands of his enraged, drunken captors, despite Thorkell's strenuous efforts to protect him. When the tribute was finally paid and oaths of peace were sworn, the viking fleet dispersed, but Thorkell chose to remain in England and, in a remarkable turnabout, entered the service of &AElig;thelred II with forty-five ships, promising to defend his country in return for food and clothes.<br>
<br>Thorkell fought for &AElig;thelred II against Swein Forkbeard, king of Denmark, when the latter, inspired and perhaps goaded by Thorkell's success, invaded England in 1013 and he was with the English king in London during Swein's unsuccessful first siege of the town. But Thorkell proved almost as costly an ally as enemy: despite demanding and receiving payment and provisioning, his forces still &#145;ravaged as often as they pleased&#146;  (<span class="italic">ASC</span>, s.a. 1013, text C). When London finally submitted late in 1014, Thorkell abetted King &AElig;thelred's flight to Normandy to join his wife and children in exile at the court of his brother-in-law Duke Richard (II). From 1014 to 1016 Thorkell disappears from the pages of the <span class="roman">Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</span>. For these critical years historians are forced to rely upon cryptic skaldic poetry and the dubious authority of the <span class="italic">Encomium Emmae Reginae</span> and the later Norse sagas, which present conflicting traditions about his relations with King &AElig;thelred, Edmund Ironside, and their great opponent, Cnut. Thorkell apparently helped restore &AElig;thelred to his throne in the spring of 1014, a month or two after Swein's sudden death, but how long he remained loyal to the English king is questionable. The favour that Cnut showed Thorkell in 1017 suggests that he had switched his support to the Danish victor at a most opportune moment. According to the <span class="italic">Encomium Emmae</span>, this occurred even before Cnut's invasion. The encomiast reports that Thorkell, regretting that he had remained in England without Cnut's permission after the death of King Swein, sailed to Denmark with nine ships to make amends. There he renewed his fealty to Cnut and pledged him the aid of thirty-nine ships for his planned conquest of England. A later Scandinavian tradition asserts that Thorkell defected in response to the death of his brother Heming, who was supposedly treacherously killed in a massacre of Swein's &#145;thingmen&#146; engineered by Ulfcytel and Edmund Ironside. But it is more likely that Thorkell remained loyal to &AElig;thelred for some months following Cnut's arrival in England. He may have commanded the fleet of forty ships which, according to the <span class="roman">Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</span>, Eadric Streona &#145;seduced&#146; and brought over to Cnut in late 1015. Thorkell distinguished himself fighting for Cnut in the battle of Sherston in the summer of 1016 and, according to the &#145;Supplement to <i>J&oacute;msv&iacute;kinga saga</i>&#146;, preserved in the late fourteenth-century <span class="italic">Flateyjarb&oacute;k</span>, avenged his brother by slaying Ulfcytel (here called Snilling) during the battle of &#145;Assandun&#146; on 18 October 1016. This same source also claims that he married Ulfcytel's widow, Wulfhild, the daughter of King &AElig;thelred, and was instrumental in arranging Cnut's marriage to &AElig;thelred's widowed queen, Emma.<br>
<br>King Cnut rewarded Thorkell's services handsomely, bestowing upon him the earldom of East Anglia, one of the four great provinces into which England was now divided. Between 1017 and 1021 Thorkell was the most powerful secular magnate in England, his name invariably appearing first among the earls in the witness lists of Cnut's surviving charters. He probably served as regent during Cnut's sojourn in Denmark in 1019&#150;20, since he is the only earl Cnut addresses by name in his letter to the English people  (<span class="italic">English Historical Documents</span>, 1, no. 48) and is explicitly charged in that text with enforcing royal authority and law. In 1020 he was present with Cnut at the dedication of a minster at &#145;Assandun&#146; and in that same year supported Bishop &AElig;lfwine of Elmham's replacement of clerics with monks at Bury St Edmunds.<br>
<br>In November 1021 Thorkell, for reasons not explained in the sources, fell out with Cnut and was outlawed. He returned to Denmark and may have resumed his old profession of marauder. Just as mysteriously, two years later he and Cnut met together in Denmark and were reconciled. Cnut entrusted Denmark and the care of his son to Thorkell and Thorkell gave Cnut his own son to take back with him to England. How Thorkell achieved this stunning reversal of fortune is unclear, but his activities in Scandinavia after his exile may have persuaded Cnut that it was more dangerous to have him as an enemy than a friend. After 1023 Thorkell disappears from the historical record. When and how he died is unknown.<br>
