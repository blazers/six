<span class="headword">Perkins,  William</span>  (1558&#150;1602), <span class="occ">theologian and Church of England clergyman</span>, was born at Marston Jabbett in the parish of Bulkington, Warwickshire. His parents, Thomas and Anna, both outlived him. While his father's vocation is unknown, the family apparently had sufficient means to enrol William in June 1577 as a pensioner at Christ's College, Cambridge. He graduated BA there in 1581 and proceeded MA in 1584.<h2>
<a name="Youthandreformation"></a>Youth and reformation</h2>Perkins's early adulthood at Cambridge was apparently marked by moral laxity and dissipation. Indeed, one possibly apocryphal story has it that he reformed his life after hearing a Cambridge woman say to her child, &#145;Hold your tongue, or I will give you to drunken Perkins yonder&#146;  (Haller, 64). Some have speculated that during his years of undergraduate debauchery Perkins may have fathered a daughter out of wedlock, but the rumour cannot be confirmed; there is also speculation regarding his youthful flirtation with astrology, an encounter which may explain his vehement opposition to astrology in his mature years. But although scholars disagree as to the nature of Perkins's reformation of life, it is generally acknowledged that probably between 1581 and 1584, and concurrently with his taking up of the study of theology, he made a religious decision which shaped his future vocation within the Church of England.<br>
<br>Perkins was recognized as an able and popular advocate of that Calvinist doctrine common among &#145;the group of moderate Puritans&#146; in Cambridge, &#145;a spiritual brotherhood&#146; which included his tutor and lifelong friend, Laurence Chaderton, and Richard Greenham. His particular version of Calvinism was similar to that of such second-generation continental Calvinist theologians as Theodore Beza, Girolamo Zanchi, and Zacharias Ursinus, who &#145;faced with a resurgent Rome, were concerned to weld the protestant case into a coherent and self-consistent whole&#146;  (Lake, <span class="italic">Moderate Puritans</span>, 218&#150;19).<br>
<br>Employing a style which modern historians have described as &#145;denunciatory&#146;, Perkins preached first and briefly to the prisoners in Cambridge gaol, and soon after as lecturer at St Andrew's Church, where large numbers of scholars and lay people assembled to hear him. Thomas Fuller reports that &#145;his sermons were not so plain but that the piously learned did admire them, nor so learned but that the plain did understand them&#146;  (Fuller, <span class="italic">Holy State</span>, 81). He also records how Perkins &#145;would pronounce the word <i>Damne</i> with such an emphasis as left a dolleful Echo in his auditours ears a good while after&#146;  (Merrill, xvi). The protestant polemicist Samuel Clarke describes Perkins's ministry in Cambridge as &#145;a burning and a shining light, the sparks whereof did fly abroad into all the corners of the kingdom&#146;  (Clarke, <span class="italic">Generall Martyrologie</span>, 23).<h2>
<a name="Godlyluminary"></a>Godly luminary</h2>Perkins is frequently described as a &#145;puritan&#146; or a &#145;moderate puritan&#146;. Indeed, Collinson describes him as &#145;the prince of puritan theologians and the most eagerly read&#146;  (Collinson, <span class="italic">Elizabethan Puritan Movement</span>, 125). Yet the term &#145;puritan&#146; should not be applied without some qualification. Perkins was perhaps the most significant English theologian of his age. And while his theology was generally representative of a Calvinist scholasticism or orthodoxy that elevated the doctrine of election and placed particular emphasis on the religious experience of the individual&#151;doctrinal positions which have been equated with &#145;puritanism&#146; by some scholars&#151;it has also been demonstrated that &#145;between 1560 and 1625 the doctrine of predestination was accepted without question by virtually all of the most influential clergymen in England, puritan and nonpuritan alike&#146;  (Durston and Eales, 7). Although Perkins, along with other theologians who have been described as &#145;moderate puritans&#146;, raised a version of predestination common among Calvinist theologians to a central position, his thought transcends narrow doctrinal labels. It is more credible, following Peter Lake, to understand Perkins as a &#145;moderate puritan&#146; in the light of his ecclesiology. Lake observes that &#145;the core of the moderate puritan position lay neither in the puritan critique of the liturgy and polity of the church nor in a formal doctrinal consensus&#146;, but &#145;in the capacity, which the godly claimed, of being able to recognize one another in the midst of a corrupt and unregenerate world&#146;  (Lake, <span class="italic">Moderate Puritans</span>, 282). Perkins's writings in such works as <span class="italic">A treatise tending unto a declaration whether a man be in the state of damnation or in the estate of grace</span> (<i>c</i>.1588) and <span class="italic">A Graine of Musterd-Seede</span> (1597), often reflect precisely such an understanding, though his ecclesiology also recognized the historical problem that the visible church consists of both elect and reprobate.<h2>
<a name="RelationswiththeChurchofEngland"></a>Relations with the Church of England</h2>As a fellow of Christ's College, where he taught from his election in 1584 until he resigned his fellowship at Michaelmas 1594, Perkins exercised considerable influence. Through lectures and writings he helped establish the boundaries for a moderate churchmanship that rejected the extremes of separatism and nonconformism, and especially the opinions of those sectarian branches of English protestantism which had Anabaptist, chiliastic, and millenarian tendencies. Yet he also became a powerful advocate for protestants whose theological convictions were in conflict with anti-puritans within the Church of England, as is apparent in his defence of Francis Johnson, a fellow of Christ's College who was imprisoned because he favoured a presbyterian form of church polity. Perkins's resentment over Archbishop John Whitgift's repression of puritanism&#151;the primate used subscription in an attempt to enforce unity in the Church of England and strenuously resisted forms of protestantism which encouraged presbyterian structures of ecclesiastical government&#151;emerges clearly in the preface to <span class="italic">Armilla aurea</span> (1590).<br>
<br>Despite Perkins's criticism of what he termed &#145;corrupt&#146; and &#145;idolatrous&#146; Roman Catholic influences on its worship, he remained a devoted defender of the essential doctrines and liturgical practices of the Church of England. He raised critical objections to certain of these latter; for example, in a sermon preached at Christ's on 13 January 1587 he objected to such practices as kneeling at the reception of the eucharist, and had to answer to the vice-chancellor and other officials for his remarks. On the other hand, some historians have argued that Perkins &#145;was as powerful an apologist for the Anglican Church as Richard Hooker&#146;  (Merrill, xvii), even though Hooker directed his arguments against presbyterians while Perkins reserved his fiercest criticisms primarily for Catholicism. However, Perkins's attitude toward the Church of England was perhaps more complex than this comparison admits. Although he was undoubtedly cautious in public statements about the latter's liturgy and discipline, especially in light of the criticism he received after his confrontation with the vice-chancellor over the eucharist, he remained tenaciously supportive of the puritan movement within the church, and was deliberately less helpful than the prosecution seems to have wished when he was called as a witness in the 1590&#150;91 trial of puritan ministers. When asked about meetings of puritans to discuss the <span class="roman">Book of Discipline</span>, he recalled clearly that those present had discussed whether the <span class="roman">Book of Discipline</span> was consistent with the word of God, but he said he had no recollection of the identity of anyone who was actually present at the discussion.<h2>
<a name="Theologicaldoctrine"></a>Theological doctrine</h2>Although Perkins was conversant with the thought of John Calvin, Martin Luther, Philip Melanchthon, and William Tyndale, his theology was more profoundly indebted to the Calvinist scholasticism of Pietro Martire Vermigli, Theodore Beza, Girolamo Zanchi, and Caspar Olevianus. His theological method also reveals a considerable reliance on Peter Ramus, whose approach to logic was characterized by an intentional bifurcation of subjects. The influence of Ramus on Perkins is given vivid visual expression in charts like the one appended to <span class="italic">A Golden Chain, or, Description of Theology</span> (1591), illustrating the main points of religion and their interconnection, although it must be added that such charts also reveal a marked similarity to the approach of Theodore Beza who, while he ardently opposed Ramus, nevertheless represented the broad outlines of his theology in the form of a similar chart in his own <span class="italic">Summa totius theologicae</span>.<br>
<br>Perkins's moral theology, as expounded in <span class="italic">A Discourse of Conscience</span> (1596), addresses both the puritan preoccupation with the individual Christian's need to gain an assurance of election and the writer's concern for the social as well as individual aspects of Christian morality. Rejecting the notion that the human conscience is interior to the individual, Perkins instead places it between God and the individual, thus showing that he understands the conscience as that place where God strives with human beings in order to give them an apprehension of his judgement upon their actions. Perkins followed the <span class="italic">Discourse</span> with a fuller treatment of moral theology, <span class="italic">The Whole Treatise of the Cases of Conscience</span>, published posthumously in 1606, in which he returns to a scholastic approach to casuistry, distinguishing, for instance, between mortal and venial sins, and providing tools to determine the degree of one's moral culpability. Porter, indeed, maintains that Perkins's reputation rests primarily on his casuistry; he is:<blockquote>at one with the medieval moralists and with such godly pastors as Lancelot Andrewes, George Herbert and Jeremy Taylor in the resolve &#145;to educate the individual conscience in the way of holiness and to educate the social conscience in the way of justice&#146;. (Porter, 288)</blockquote>Commenting upon Perkins's <span class="italic">Cases of Conscience</span>, Louis Wright observes that Max Weber could have found in Perkins evidence that &#145;Calvinism produced a hospitable milieu for the development of the capitalistic spirit&#146; generations earlier than the examples Weber drew from English puritans such as Richard Baxter  (Wright, 182).<br>
<br>The genius of Perkins's work did not lie in its originality&#151;his theology represents a conventional recital of Calvinist scholasticism in virtually every respect. His gift lay rather in bringing to a broad audience a variety of theological and moral issues, popularizing essentially technical discussions, and therefore, as Fuller observed, humbling &#145;the towering speculations of philosophers into practice and morality&#146;  (Fuller, <span class="italic">Holy State</span>, 81). In Perkins's own words, &#145;Theology is the science of living blessedly for ever&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 177); for him, theology was in every respect a practical study.<h2>
<a name="Contemporaryandposthumousinfluence"></a>Contemporary and posthumous influence</h2>In 1597 Perkins's polemical influence spread throughout Europe following the publication of <span class="italic">A Reformed Catholike</span>. Perkins argues in this treatise that the term &#145;reformed Catholic&#146; properly conveys the posture of the protestant. His purpose, he writes, &#145;is to show how near we may come to the present Church of Rome in sundry points of religion and wherein we must ever dissent&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 521). Although his arguments are unrelentingly anti-Roman, they led William Bishop, titular bishop of Chalcedon and author of <span class="italic">Reformation of a Catholike Deformed by W. Perkins</span> (two parts, 1604&#150;7), to say that he had &#145;not seene any book of like quality, published by a Protestant, to contain either more matter, or delivered in better method&#146;  (Merrill, xvii).<br>
<br>Perkins's <span class="italic">De praedestinationis modo et ordine</span> (1598), while positively received by most Calvinists, drew fire from Jacob Arminius, the controversial Dutch Reformed theologian and opponent of the Calvinist doctrine of predestination, who charged Perkins with returning protestant theology to scholasticism. Nor was Arminius satisfied with Perkins's treatise <span class="italic">God's Free Grace and Man's Freewill</span> (1602). His refutation of Perkins, completed in the year of the latter's death, takes issue not only with the Calvinist interpretation of predestination which Perkins taught, in which God by immutable decree before creation has arbitrarily elected some for salvation and condemned the rest, but also his doctrine of limited atonement which, following Beza and other Calvinist scholastics, taught that Jesus Christ did not die for all humanity, but for the elect alone. Such controversies did nothing to hinder the dissemination of Perkins's writings abroad. They were usually translated into Dutch, German (as much for circulation in Switzerland as in Germany itself), and Latin, sometimes into French and even Czech. This process continued into the last quarter of the seventeenth century, when a number of his works appeared in Welsh.<br>
<br>The list of students influenced by Perkins reads like a who's who of seventeenth-century Calvinism. William Ames, probably his most important pupil, embraced the more extreme elements of puritan thought and eventually left England for the Netherlands, where he took up the post of professor of theology at Franeker. As J. D. Eusden observes, while &#145;Amesian theology reworked much of the old and explored areas not entered by his respected teacher&#146;  (Ames, 4), Ames's theology none the less reflects both the practical aspects of Perkins's moral thought and the latter's doctrine on such issues as predestination. John Robinson, the founder of congregationalism in Leiden, extended Perkins's influence when he published his own catechism there. Other heirs of Perkins's thought included the elder Thomas Goodwin, Paul Baynes, Samuel Ward, later master of Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge, the poet Phineas Fletcher, Thomas Draxe, Thomas Taylor, James Ussher, the celebrated archbishop of Armagh, and his close friend Richard Montagu, master of Sidney Sussex and later bishop of Winchester. His practical and theological works (many of which were first published only after his death) remained popular in England throughout the seventeenth century. In the words of William Haller: &#145;No books, it is fair to say, were more often to be found upon the shelves of succeeding generations of preachers, and the name of no preacher recurs more often in later Puritan literature&#146;  (Haller, 65).<br>
<br>Perkins's writings are notoriously lacking in autobiographical statements, and it is difficult to glean from contemporary sources a reliable picture of the company he kept. He knew the Yorkshire puritans Sir Thomas and Lady Margaret Hoby, and the dedications of his books suggest that he was acquainted with Edward Russell, seventh earl of Bedford, Valentine Knightley, whose father, Sir Richard Knightley of Fawsley, was a leading figure among the Northamptonshire godly, Robert Beale, clerk of the council, Sir Edward Denny, who in 1626 became first earl of Norwich, Sir William Peryam, chief baron of the exchequer, and Margaret Clifford, countess of Cumberland. But there is nothing in them to explain Perkins's relationships with those to whom these dedications were given.<br>
<br>A portrait of Perkins hangs in the combination room of Christ's College; he looks heavy-faced, and his right hand is visibly maimed. It is known that he married Timothye Cradocke of Grantchester on 2 July 1595, and that together they had seven children, three of whom died in childhood. Immediately after his marriage Perkins resigned his fellowship, and largely for that reason almost nothing is recorded of the last seven years of his life, though his theological output continued unabated. He died in Cambridge on 22 October 1602, aged forty-four, after suffering intensely for several weeks from the stone. James Montagu preached at his funeral, which took place three days later, on <span class="roman">Joshua</span> 1: 2&#151;&#145;Moses my servant is dead&#146;. Perkins was interred in St Andrew's Church at his college's expense. In his will he bequeathed 10<i>s</i>. apiece to his father, mother, and each of his siblings, and left his small property in Cambridge to his wife, who subsequently remarried. His library was purchased by William Bedell, a pupil of Perkins who in 1629 became bishop of Kilmore and Ardagh.<br>
