<span class="headword">Denisot,  Nicolas</span>  (1515&#150;1559), <span class="occ">French poet and tutor</span>, was born at Le Mans, the son of Jean Denisot (<i>d</i>. 1539), bailiff of Ass&eacute; and advocate in the provincial court of Le Mans. He learned the arts of engraving and cartography and produced maps of Maine and Peru. In 1540 he was a member of the entourage of Cardinal Philippe de Luxemburg at Le Mans. He also figured in a group of Le Mans poets who became involved in a literary argument between Clement Marot and Fran&ccedil;ois Sagon. Denisot's verses in defence of Sagon were so clumsy that his name was used by his opponents to imply that he was a fool (<i>sot</i>). Most of his subsequent works were written under a pseudonym, usually Le conte d'Alsinois, an anagram of his name. In 1545 he composed a series of religious songs, the <span class="italic">No&euml;ls</span>. In the course of that year he left Maine for Paris, entering the service of Fran&ccedil;ois I where he was given a post in the household &#145;for his good qualities and merits&#146;  (Jug&eacute;, 42). During this period his poetic style was refined by his contact with the Renaissance poets of the Pl&eacute;iade.<br>
<br>Between 1547 and 1549 Denisot was in England and became a tutor to the three daughters of the duke of Somerset, lord protector during the minority of Edward VI. He may have ingratiated himself by writing poems in praise of the new king and his father, Henry VIII. These survive in the British Library, in an exquisite little vellum book probably made by Denisot. On his return to France he edited a collection of Latin poems by the daughters of Somerset and a number of French poets, which paid tribute to Marguerite de Navarre, who had recently died. The following year, 1551, he brought out another edition with translations in Greek, French, and Italian by members of the Pl&eacute;iade; it was prefaced by an engraving of Marguerite de Navarre by Denisot. He may have left England under a cloud; subsequently Dr Wotton, England's ambassador in France, expressed the opinion that he had forged letters and was &#145;a crafty child&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP for.</span>, <i>1553&#150;8</i>, 267).<br>
<br>It was probably on his return from England that Denisot had been appointed valet of the chamber to Henri II. In 1553 he distanced himself from the Pl&eacute;iade by publishing the devout <span class="italic">Cantiques du premier advenement de J&eacute;sus Christ</span>, which condemned both paganism and the laxity of priests. Yet he does not seem to have inclined towards protestantism. Indeed, in 1556 he was probably asked by Henri to go to Calais under the pretext of tutoring the children of the controller, again ingratiating himself by exploiting his handsome appearance and pleasing manner. He drew a plan of the town which he sent to the French king; he was identified as a spy and imprisoned but managed to escape. His efforts probably contributed to the French capture of Calais in 1558. He may subsequently have married, as his second wife, a peasant girl who assisted his escape, Michelle Mesnil; in 1567 she was involved in a dispute with his heirs over her dowry.<br>
<br>In 1557, under the name Th&eacute;odose Valentinian, Denisot composed his largest work, <span class="italic">Amant resuscit&eacute; de la mort d'amour</span>. This sentimental novel subverts the cult of carnal love in favour of the duty owed to God and Christian marriage. In September 1559 he died of a fever while residing in the faubourg St Marceau in Paris and was buried in the church of St &Eacute;tienne-du-Mont. His reputation as a poet remained high during the sixteenth century but was subsequently eclipsed; he was later seen as occupying an &#145;eccentric&#146; position in French literature outside the circle of Pl&eacute;iade poets  (Balmas, 21).<br>
