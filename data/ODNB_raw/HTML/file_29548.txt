<span class="headword">Williams,  Thomas</span>  (1513/14&#150;1566), <span class="occ">lawyer and speaker of the House of Commons</span>, was the eldest son of Adam Williams of Stowford, Devon, and his wife, Alice, daughter and heir of Thomas Prideaux of Ashburton in the same county. His father, a lawyer who served several towns in south Devon, had obtained a grant of arms in 1538 and enjoyed the favour of the prominent Edgcumbe family. Thomas was admitted to the Inner Temple in 1539 and was Lent reader there in 1558 and 1561. He soon established a legal practice centred on Plymouth, serving as feodary for Devon and Exeter in 1559, subsidy commissioner in 1565, counsel for both Plymouth and Exeter, and JP from 1559 until his death. He bought property at Ugborough and elsewhere in Devon.<br>
<br>Williams's parliamentary career began under Mary Tudor. It was probably through the influence of Richard Edgcumbe, who owned houses at Mount Edgcumbe and Cotehele, that he was elected for the boroughs of Bodmin in 1555 and Saltash in 1558. Unlike Edgcumbe's son Peter, who sat in the Commons for Totnes, Williams displayed his protestant convictions in 1555 (later also made manifest in the preamble to his will) by opposing a government bill dealing with religion. Here Williams may have enjoyed the support of Francis Russell, second earl of Bedford, since his brother-in-law John Belfield was in the service of the Russell family.<br>
<br>Williams sat for Tavistock in Elizabeth's first parliament in 1559, and in 1563 was returned for Exeter. On 12 January 1563 he was chosen speaker of the Commons. Described by a contemporary as grave, wise, and learned in the laws of the realm, he referred to himself in his disabling speech as &#145;one among the Romans, chosen from the plough to a place of estimation&#146;, for he was &#145;a countryman, fit for the same and not for this place&#146;  (HoP, <span class="italic">Commons, 1558&#150;1603</span>, 3.626). On 15 January he was presented to the queen and made the traditional oration, an unusually literate exercise in which he spoke of the past, present, and future. Describing time past as notable for the great benefits Elizabeth had bestowed upon her people, Williams proceeded to delineate the three monsters of necessity, ignorance, and error that threatened the present, and concluded by urging the construction of an invincible fortress of spiritual virtues ruled by the queen as the lieutenant of God, one whose stones would be the hearts of faithful people.<br>
<br>The problem of succession was the chief issue under discussion in this session. Williams helped draw up articles for a succession committee and on 28 January read the committee's petition to the queen in the gallery at Whitehall. After urging her to marry, Williams advocated the enactment of &#145;sharp and terrible statutes&#146; to punish any who might presume to threaten the queen's safety. Elizabeth thanked him for his excellent oration but, as so often, deferred her answer to a further time. The speaker pressed the issue again when Elizabeth came to prorogue the session on 10 April. Her response, typically opaque, was that it should be dealt with by the &#145;zealous Prince's consideration&#146;, not by &#145;lip-laboured orations out of wrangling subjects' mouths&#146;; they should not &#145;tempt too far a Prince's patience&#146;  (Neale, <span class="italic">Elizabeth I and her Parliaments, 1559&#150;1581</span>, 171&#150;6).<br>
<br>During this session Williams secured the passage of five bills desired by the city of Exeter and was paid &pound;20 for his services. He died probably in Devon, still &#145;in his young flourishing age&#146; (in fact he was fifty-two) on 1 July 1566, thus leaving the Commons with the necessity of naming a new speaker when it met for a second session in September that year. He was buried in the church at Harford, Devon, where an effigy depicts him as an esquire in armour. Memorial verses conclude:<blockquote>
<div>The common peace he studied to preserve<br>
</div>
<div>And true religion ever to maintain.<br>
</div>
<div>In peace of justice where as he did serve<br>
</div>
<div>And now in heaven with mighty Jove doth reign.<br>
</div> (HoP, <span class="italic">Commons, 1558&#150;1603</span>, 626)</blockquote>Williams was married to Emmeline, daughter and coheir of William Cruwys of Chudleigh, Devon, with whom he had at least two sons and three daughters. Both of the sons were said to be thriftless. In his will he left &pound;40 to his daughter Elizabeth if she married the heir of John Trevelyan of Nettlecome&#151;&#145;no more in consideracion of the greate charge that I have and must be at abowte the education and bringinge upp of the sonne of the saide John Trevilian&#146;&#151;or &pound;200 if she chose not to do so  (will, fol. 147). His law readings were published in 1680, over a century after their author's death, as <span class="italic">The Excellency and Praeheminence of the Law of England above All other Lawes in the World</span>. Their appearance in print should probably be associated with that of other historic legal texts at about this date, notably the standard edition of the year-books between 1678 and 1680.<br>
