<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Cooper <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Manners]</span>,  Diana Olivia Winifred Maud</span> <span class="st"> [<em>known as </em>Lady Diana Cooper]</span>, Viscountess Norwich  (1892&#150;1986), <span class="occ">actress, society hostess, and author</span>, was born on 29 August 1892 in London into the Manners family where she was accepted as the third of three daughters and the fifth of five children. Her assumed father was Henry John Brinsley Manners, marquess of Granby, later eighth duke of Rutland, MP (1852&#150;1925), and her mother was (Marion Margaret) Violet (1856&#150;1937) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/49527/', "Manners, (Marion Margaret) Violet")</script>], artist, daughter of Colonel Charles Hugh Lindsay. It was generally believed, and certainly by Diana, that her true father was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32683/', "Henry John Cockayne (Harry) Cust (1861&#150;1917)")</script>, politician, journalist, and brother of the fifth Baron Brownlow. She received no formal education, but was educated at home by governesses and the culture of her surroundings. She learned much, including great drifts of poetry, which she remembered to her dying day. In her voluminous correspondence and in the drafts for her books, her prose was vivid and imaginative, and her idiosyncratic spelling added to its charm.<br>
<br>At ten years old, Diana contracted Urb's disease, a form of paralysis, and for five years was a semi-invalid. She never complained, but, because of her illness, was certainly over-indulged by the family. In 1910 she formally came out and took her place at the centre of that so-called golden generation, soon so largely to perish in war. At this time her beauty was first acknowledged. She was hailed &#145;queen of beauty&#146;, but also acquired some notoriety. She and her immediate circle dubbed themselves the &#145;corrupt coterie&#146;, and lived their lives of privilege to the full and sometimes to excess. Diana was much criticized when, at a party on the Thames in 1914, Sir Dennis Anson swam for a dare and was drowned; this tragedy haunted her all her life. When the First World War came in 1914, Diana Manners trained as a member of the Voluntary Aid Detachment at Guy's Hospital. She was hard-working and conscientious, and acted as a nurse at Guy's and at the hospital established by her parents in their London house in Arlington Street.<br>
<br>Diana had many suitors and mourned the deaths of several of them in the fighting. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32547/', "(Alfred) Duff Cooper (1890&#150;1954)")</script>, at first in the Foreign Office and then in the Grenadier Guards, was among her most ardent admirers. In 1916 she promised to marry him, but was prevented by lack of money and opposition from her ambitious mother. Even the DSO, to which Duff Cooper was appointed in 1918, failed to overcome this opposition. Eventually, however, agreement was given and they were married on 2 June 1919. It was a marriage which never staled. Diana had many who loved her and Duff was frequently unfaithful; but for each the relationship with the other remained the most important thing in their lives.<br>
<br>To earn money Diana acted in two unmemorable films before her marriage and gained the reputation of a hard-working actress as well as a transcendent beauty. Marriage and Duff Cooper's wish to enter politics increased the need for money and Diana was glad to accept Max Reinhardt's offer to play the Madonna in a mime play, <span class="italic">The Miracle</span>. This was first staged in the USA from November 1923 to the following May, and again for the following three autumns and winters. It toured Europe in 1927, and London and the provinces in 1932; the last performance was in January 1933. <span class="italic">The Miracle</span> was a phenomenal success, and Diana Cooper's triumphant part in it was remembered as long as she lived. The money earned allowed her husband to enter parliament, as MP for Oldham, in 1924.<br>
<br>On 15 September 1929 Diana had a son, John Julius. He was her only child and she took a close and intelligent interest in his education. Once <span class="italic">The Miracle</span> was ended, she was primarily concerned with her husband's career rather than her own, and she gave him powerful support, as chatelaine of Admiralty House (Duff Cooper became first lord of the Admiralty in May 1937). There she first had the opportunity to display her outstanding talent as a hostess in a splendid setting. In the 1930s the Coopers were friendly with Edward VIII and Mrs Simpson and accompanied them on the cruise of the <i>Nahlin</i> in 1936. They were spoken of as belonging to Mrs Simpson's camp, but this was never the case.<br>
<br>Diana supported Duff throughout the Second World War, even accompanying him to Singapore and the Far East against convention, and in the face of opposition. When in Britain, they lived in the Dorchester Hotel and at Bognor in a house given to Diana by her mother, where she found complete happiness running a smallholding farm. In January 1944 Duff Cooper became British representative to the French committee of liberation in Algiers and in November British ambassador in Paris. His wife was unfailingly at his side; her French was fluent but inaccurate, and she was by no means a conventional ambassadress, but she gave the embassy a glamour possessed by none other. With her remarkable ability to get on with people, she collected a group of artists and writers known as &#145;La Bande&#146;; it was said with criticism that some of them had collaborated with the Germans. While at the embassy Diana Cooper discovered and rented the house &#145;she loved best in the world&#146;, the Ch&acirc;teau St Firman at Chantilly. On leaving the embassy at the end of 1947, contrary to convention and to the aggravation of their successors, the Coopers returned to live at Chantilly.<br>
<br>In 1952 Duff Cooper was created Viscount Norwich, but Diana would have none of it, announcing in <span class="italic">The Times</span> that she wished to retain her former name and title, so Lady Diana Cooper she remained. In 1953 Duff Cooper was taken violently ill; he recovered, but died on 1 January 1954 on a cruise to Jamaica. He was buried at Belvoir Castle, but Diana did not attend the funeral: she never attended the funerals of those she loved. Her life had been centred round Duff for thirty-five years, and she was distraught without him.<br>
<br>Diana lived for a further thirty-two years. She disliked getting old, but found solace in writing a three-volume autobiography, which was a resounding success. She gained much comfort from John Julius, her grandchildren, and her many friends. She retained her love of travel and her interest in people: she still enjoyed each new experience, even, it seemed, two burglaries, when she displayed her courage and her enduring star quality. She is remembered mostly for her outstanding beauty, but for most people this obscured the fact that she was a shy, very clever, and sometimes extremely funny woman. She died on 16 June 1986, at her London home, 10 Warwick Avenue.<br>
