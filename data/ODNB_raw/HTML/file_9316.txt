<span class="headword">Ferguson, Sir  Adam</span>  (1771&#150;1855), <span class="occ">friend of Sir Walter Scott</span>, was the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9315/', "Professor Adam Ferguson (1723&#150;1816)")</script>, historian and philosopher, and Katharine Burnet (1746&#150;1795). At Edinburgh University he became the companion of Sir Walter Scott, who said that he combined the &#145;lightest and most airy temper with the best and kindest disposition&#146;  (&#145;Autobiography&#146; in Lockhart, 2.55). He was also one of the nineteen original members of the literary society called &#145;the Club&#146;, among whom he was nicknamed Linton, supposedly after a Newhaven fisherman mistook him for another of that name  (ibid.). It was in Ferguson's company that Scott in 1793 first visited the scenes in Perthshire on the highland border which he afterwards described in his poems and romances. They were visiting the English Lake District together in 1797 when Scott met his future wife.<br>
<br>About 1800 Ferguson entered the army becoming captain of the 101st regiment in February 1808, and afterwards serving in the Peninsular campaign under Wellington. Scott enjoyed relating that the &#145;Lady of the Lake&#146; having reached Ferguson in the lines of Torres Vedras he read to his company, while lying on the ground exposed to the enemy's artillery, the description of the battle in canto VI. In a letter to Scott in 1811 Ferguson expressed the resolve, should he survive the campaign, to try his hand &#145;on a snug little farm&#146; somewhere in Scott's neighbourhood  (Lockhart, 2.350). He was taken prisoner during Wellington's retreat from Burgos in 1812, and was not released until the peace of 1814.<br>
<br>On 8 October 1816 Ferguson went on half pay. In 1817 he accompanied Scott on an excursion, and in the following year he and his sisters took up residence in the mansion house of Toftfield, which Scott had recently purchased, and which, at the sisters' request, he renamed Huntly Burn. In the autumn of 1818 Ferguson, chiefly through the exertions of Scott, was appointed Deputy Keeper of the Regalia of Scotland, which had recently been discovered. About this time Sir David Wilkie executed for Scott the picture in which his family is represented as a group of peasants and Ferguson as a gamekeeper or poacher. In 1819 Ferguson, in the capacity of secretary, accompanied Scott's friend the duke of Buccleuch, then in declining health, to Lisbon. On 16 April 1821 he married Margaret, the widow of George Lyon of London, and daughter of John Stewart of Stenton, Perthshire (described in a humorous letter of Scott's on the ceremony; Lockhart, 5.63). After his marriage Ferguson lived on his estate in Dumfriesshire, when he was not at Abbotsford or in Edinburgh. During the visit of George IV to Edinburgh he received a knighthood on 29 August 1822. He died in Edinburgh on 1 January 1855. His obituary described him as &#145;brimful of Scotch anecdote&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 195).<br>
