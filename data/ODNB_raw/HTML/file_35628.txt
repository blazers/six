<span class="headword">Puddicombe <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Evans]</span>,  Anne Adalisa</span> <span class="st"> [<em>pseud. </em>Allen Raine]</span>  (1836&#150;1908), <span class="occ">novelist</span>, was born on 6 October 1836 in Bridge Street, Newcastle Emlyn, Carmarthenshire, the eldest child of the two sons and two daughters of Benjamin Evans (1809&#150;1884), solicitor of that town, and his wife, Letitia Grace Morgan (<i>b</i>. 1814, <i>d</i>. after 1871), daughter of Thomas Morgan, surgeon, also of Newcastle Emlyn. Both parents came from families noteworthy in the cultural history of Wales: Benjamin Evans was the grandson of the Revd David Davis (1745&#150;1827) of Castellhywel, Cardiganshire, a leading figure in the Unitarian movement and translator into Welsh of Gray's &#145;Elegy&#146;, and Letitia Evans was the granddaughter of the religious reformer Daniel Rowland (1711?&#150;1790). Anne Adalisa herself (known as Ada to her family) went to school in Carmarthen (1846&#150;9) before being sent to Cheltenham to be educated with the family of the Revd Henry Solly, Unitarian minister, pioneer of the movement for working men's institutes and friend of literary figures such as Charles Dickens, George Eliot, Mrs Henry Wood, and Bulwer-Lytton. In 1851 the Sollys moved to Southfields, near Wimbledon; Ada, who had now been joined by her sister, Lettie, went with them and the two girls stayed at Southfields until 1856, when they returned to Newcastle Emlyn.<br>
<br>Once home, Ada led the conventional life of a young lady of the period, but she maintained her intellectual interests, learning French and Italian and studying botany. She also edited a short-lived magazine called <span class="italic">Home Sunshine</span> with a group of friends (in particular the Leslie family of Adpar, Cardiganshire, through whom she was to meet her future husband). She remained at Newcastle Emlyn for the next sixteen years until, on 10 April 1872, she married Beynon Puddicombe (1839&#150;1906) at Penbryn church, Cardiganshire. Puddicombe was foreign correspondent at Smith Payne's Bank, London, and the couple settled at Elgin Villas, Addiscombe, near Croydon, where they stayed for the next eight years, a period during which Ada suffered from serious, but unspecified, ill health. This improved when the Puddicombes moved to Winchmore Hill, Middlesex. Despite her poor health, Ada learned to play the violin during these years, becoming a capable musician.<br>
<br>There is also evidence to suggest that Ada's earliest attempts at novel writing also date from this period in the 1880s, though her official career as Allen Raine, novelist, did not begin until 1894, when she was fifty-eight. In that year she shared a prize given at the national eisteddfod for a story descriptive of Welsh life; &#145;Ynysoer&#146; was then serialized in the <span class="italic">North Wales Observer</span> and finally published posthumously in book form as <span class="italic">Where Billows Roll</span> (1909). <span class="italic">A Welsh Singer</span>, her first full-length novel, was published in 1897. Originally entitled <span class="italic">Mifanwy</span>, it had been rejected by six publishers before Hutchinson &amp; Co. accepted it, but it became an immediate best-seller on publication. <span class="italic">A Welsh Singer</span> was followed by ten more novels, of which <span class="italic">Torn Sails</span> (1898), <span class="italic">Garthowen</span> (1900), <span class="italic">A Welsh Witch</span> (1902), and <span class="italic">Queen of the Rushes</span> (1906) are the most accomplished; she also published a collection of short stories, <span class="italic">All in a Month</span> (1908), and an <span class="italic">Allen Raine Birthday Book</span> appeared in 1907. The novels sold worldwide and in April 1908 <span class="italic">The Bookman</span> ranked her as one of the four best-selling novelists of the day, along with Marie Corelli, Hall Caine, and Silas Hocking. Her books eventually went out of print at the beginning of the Second World War, though three appeared in Welsh translations in the 1960s and a fourth, <span class="italic">Garthowen</span>, was published in 1983. However, the late twentieth-century growth of women's studies led to a new interest in her work and <span class="italic">Queen of the Rushes</span>, perhaps her most completely achieved work, set in west Wales during the religious revival of 1904, was republished by Honno, the Welsh women's press, in 1998, with a new critical introduction.<br>
<br>Although based in London, the Puddicombes had kept their links with west Wales, building a house, Bronm&ocirc;r, at Tre-saith, Cardiganshire, in 1897. In 1900 Beynon Puddicombe retired from the bank, due to mental illness, and the couple moved permanently to Tre-saith. Beynon Puddicombe died on 29 May 1906 and Ada herself died of cancer at Bronm&ocirc;r on 21 June 1908; they were both buried in nearby Penbryn churchyard. They had no children.<br>
<br>The pseudonym Allen Raine appeared to Ada in a dream, and it is unlikely that she deliberately chose a masculine pen-name. Whether this affected the earliest critical response to her novels is not clear, but in his obituaries in 1908 (when she was known to be a woman) Ernest Rhys was typical in categorizing her novels as unsophisticated potboilers with cardboard characters. As he said, &#145;She wrote love-stories, in short&#146;  (<span class="italic">Manchester Guardian</span>, 27 June 1908). Ironically, in view of the way in which she is so often contrasted with Caradoc Evans, her work too was stigmatized as a caricature of Welsh life. Rhys commented that &#145;Welsh readers who wish to see Wales pictured as it really is were not satisfied to accept her as a genuine Welsh novelist&#146;  (<span class="italic">Manchester Guardian</span>, 24 June 1908), while H. Elvet Lewis asserted that &#145;the dialect she has used in her stories &hellip; distressed those who know Wales from within and love its everyday speech&#146;  (<span class="italic">British Weekly</span>, 25 June 1908). However, the appearance of a volume on Allen Raine in the <span class="roman">Writers of Wales</span> series led to the beginnings of a critical reappraisal which rejects her easy categorization as a popular novelist of romance, with little realism or depth of analysis.<br>
