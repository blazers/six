<span class="headword">Dingley,  Robert</span>  (1618/19&#150;1660), <span class="occ">clergyman</span>, was born in Surrey, possibly in Chertsey, the second son of Sir John Dingley (<i>d</i>. 1679) of London and his wife, Jane, daughter of John Hammond of Chertsey Abbey. He matriculated from Magdalen College, Oxford, on 10 October 1634 aged fifteen, graduating BA on 27 January 1638 and proceeding MA on 3 November 1640; he held a fellowship at the college from 1638 to 1644. If Wood is to be credited, he was at first &#145;a great observer of church ceremonies, and a remarkable bower to the altar when he came into the chapel&#146; but cynically turned presbyterian  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 3.487). He was admitted by the House of Lords on 17 June 1643 to the rectory of Barnes in Surrey, in place of John Cutts, then absent at Oxford, on the petition of the leading parishioners. A Thomas Rutton is listed as having been appointed to the benefice three days later; the reasons are unclear, but Dingley did indeed serve as a minister at Barnes. In <span class="italic">The Spirituall Taste Described</span> (1649) there appears a preface to Elizabeth, daughter of Daniel Oxenbridge, third wife of Oliver St John (<i>d</i>. 1673), and her sister Mary, wife of William Langhorn (possibly father of the East India Company merchant of the same name), signed 4 November 1648, in which Dingley reveals that they had been &#145;members of my congregation&#146; there, &#145;the fairest flowers in my garden&#146;. The book also contains a portrait of the author.<br>
<br>In 1648 Dingley was presented to the rectory of Brighstone near Newport on the Isle of Wight, close to Wolverton House, where his father Sir John, deputy to the earl of Pembroke, then had his chief residence. There he published three works, notably <span class="italic">The Deputation of Angels, or, The Angell-Guardian</span> (1654). This contained an epistle to Colonel William Sydenham, councillor of state and governor of the Isle of Wight, Major Bowerman, the deputy governor, Lord Commissioner Lisle, and Colonel Robert Hammond thanking them for their &#145;many favours&#146;, and urging them to &#145;do worthily for sion; to undermine atheism, profaneness, and heresy&#146;. Dingley attacks those who &#145;condemn the ministry and cannot endure sound doctrine&#146; as also &#145;despisers of all superiority and government political&#146;. In furtherance of these views he acted as an assistant to the Hampshire commissioners for ejection of insufficient or scandalous ministers and schoolmasters. In the preface to his <span class="italic">Vox coeli</span> (1658) Dingley observed that Edward III, Henry VIII, and Sir Walter Ralegh were among the many who &#145;could equally handle both the sword and pen&#146; and hoped to &#145;provoke our military worthies to the love of the muses&#146;; he notes that the dedicatee, Captain Samuel Bull JP, captain of Cowes Castle, has been &#145;instrumental in carrying the gospel to a town [West Cowes] that never before enjoyed it; consisting of about a thousand souls; and have helped them to build a synagogue&#146;. He died, possibly in Brighstone, on 12 January 1660 and was buried in the chancel of Brighstone church.<br>
