<div class="para">
<span class="headword">White,  Joseph</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1746, <em>d.</em> 1814), <span class="occ">orientalist and theologian</span>, was born at Ruscombe, Gloucestershire, and baptized at Stroud on 19 February 1746, the eldest son of Thomas White (1724&#150;1804), a journeyman broadloom weaver, and Elizabeth Harmer (1723&#150;1772). He received his earliest education from his father and in one of the Gloucestershire charity schools. He started his working life in his father's employment; his talents and attainments, however, attracted the notice of Joseph Ellis, a wealthy neighbour, who, together with the Stroud physician Dr Samuel Jones, paid for him to pursue his studies at Ruscombe, and afterwards at a school in Gloucester. Their generosity and the liberality of John Moore, a future archbishop of Canterbury, enabled White to enter Wadham College, Oxford, as a commoner on 6 June 1765. In September of that year he was made a scholar of his college and from 1766 to 1773 he held the Hody exhibition for Hebrew. He graduated BA (1769), MA (1773), BD (1779), and DD (1787), and from 1773 he was a fellow of Wadham. At Moore's request he devoted himself to the study of Syriac, Arabic, and Persian, and in 1774 he was elected unanimously to the Laudian chair of Arabic. His command of these languages was clearly demonstrated in his edition of the Syriac Philoxenian version of the gospels, published as <span class="italic">Sacrorum evangeliorum versio Syriaca Philoxeniana</span> (2 vols., 1778). This scholarly and accurate work was based on four manuscripts acquired from Mesopotamia by Glocester Ridley, fellow of New College.<br>
<br>On 17 November 1779 White preached before the university an elegant sermon afterwards published as <span class="italic">A Revisal of the English Translation of the Old Testament Recommended</span>, and about the same time he was appointed one of the preachers at the Whitehall chapel. From 1780 to 1783 he was occupied in preparing an edition of the Persian text of the &#145;Institutes of Timur&#146;, which was published at the expense of the East India Company in 1783 as <span class="italic">Institutes Political and Military &hellip; by the Great Timour</span>. The text was accompanied by a translation into English by Major William Davy, then Persian secretary to the governor-general of Bengal.<br>
<br>In 1783 White was chosen to preach the Bampton lectures the following year and he took as his subject a comparison of Islam and Christianity. He called upon the assistance of Samuel Badcock and Samuel Parr but failed to acknowledge his obligation when the lectures were published in 1784. The lectures, which contained a courteous answer to Gibbon as well as a reply to Hume, met with general approbation in academic and literary circles and established White's reputation as &#145;one of the ablest vindicators of the Christian doctrines modern times has witnessed&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 84/1, 627). Largely as a result of this success White was appointed rector of Melton in Suffolk in 1787, whereupon he resigned his fellowship. In 1788 he was presented to a prebend in Gloucester Cathedral, an appointment &#145;which at once placed him in easy and independent circumstances&#146;  (Nichols, <span class="italic">Illustrations</span>, 4.861). It was not until after Badcock's death in 1788 that the assistance that White had received in the writing of the sermons came to light. Eventually, in 1790, he was obliged to publish a statement of his literary debt to Badcock and Parr; his scholarly reputation was somewhat tarnished but it was generally accepted that White had been responsible for the greater part of the work.<br>
<br>On 31 October 1791 at Prestbury, near Cheltenham, White married Mary (<i>d</i>. 1811), daughter of a prosperous grocer, John Turner of Gloucester, and sister of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27864/', "Samuel Turner (1759&#150;1802)")</script>. He published little over the few years until 1800, when his edition of &#145;Abd al-Latif's manuscript description of Egypt at the close of the twelfth century appeared under the title <span class="italic">Abdollatiphi historiae Aegypti compendium</span>. He had printed the text sixteen years previously but, not being satisfied with it, had presented the copies to Paulus of Jena, who issued the work in Germany. White's edition embodied a translation begun by the younger Edward Pococke but completed by White himself. He planned to follow this with a comprehensive history of Egypt but this proved unsuccessful and his <span class="italic">Observations on Certain Antiquities of Egypt</span> (1804) soon became out of date once the modern study of Egyptology began.<br>
<br>The rest of White's literary work was concentrated on the textual study of the <span class="roman">Old</span> and <span class="roman">New</span> testaments and earned him in 1804 the regius professorship of Hebrew at Oxford, carrying with it a canonry of Christ Church. Besides various pamphlets, in which he advocated a retranslation of the <span class="roman">Bible</span>, and proposed a new edition of the <span class="roman">Septuagint</span>, to be based on the Hexplar&#150;Syriac manuscript then recently discovered in Milan, he published in 1800 a <span class="italic">Diatessaron, or, Harmony of the Gospels</span>. In his edition of the <span class="roman">New Testament</span> in Greek (1808; often reprinted) he endeavoured to simplify and popularize Griesbach's <span class="italic">Critical Studies</span>, and his last work, <span class="italic">Criseos Griesbachianiae in Novum Testamentum synopsis</span> (1811), contains a summary of the more important results.<br>
<br>White was an accomplished and versatile scholar who ranks alongside Humphrey Hody, Robert Lowth, and Benjamin Kennicott as one of &#145;the major Hebraists of the century&#146;  (Patterson, 539). In his private life &#145;he united a degree of roughness with great simplicity of manners&#146;  (Nichols, <span class="italic">Illustrations</span>, 4.865). He never recovered from the death of his wife on 25 August 1811 and died, as a result of a paralytic stroke, at his residence in Christ Church on 23 May 1814. He was buried in Christ Church, where there is a monument to his memory.<br>
