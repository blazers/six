<span class="headword">Clausen, Sir  George</span>  (1852&#150;1944), <span class="occ">painter</span>, was born at 8 William Street, Regent's Park, London, on 18 April 1852, the second son of Jurgen Johnsen Clausen (1821&#150;1911), a decorative painter of Danish extraction, and his Scottish wife, Elizabeth Fillan. In 1867, after attending St Mark's School, Chelsea, Clausen became a learner in the drawing office of the Chelsea firm of decorators Messrs Trollope, where he remained until 1873. During these years he received additional drawing instruction from John Cleghorn which prepared him for entry, with a two-year national scholarship, to the National Art Training School, South Kensington, in 1873. About this time he also worked as an assistant to the classical painter Edwin Long (1829&#150;1891), and copied works by Rembrandt, Titian, and Vel&aacute;zquez in the National Gallery. Clausen then studied briefly at the Antwerp Academy, and he returned regularly to Holland until 1880. He made his d&eacute;but at the Royal Academy in 1876 with <span class="italic">High Mass at a Fishing Village on the Zuyder Zee</span> (Nottingham Castle Museum) when he was mistaken by <span class="italic">The Times</span> critic for a &#145;very clever Dutch painter&#146;  (22 May 1876, 6). Throughout the 1870s Clausen worked in London, and exhibited street scenes such as <span class="italic">A Spring Morning, Haverstock Hill</span> (1881; Bury Art Gallery, Bury). However, in 1881, following his marriage to Agnes Mary Webster (1856/7&#150;1944) on 1 June, he decided to leave London for Childwick Green near St Albans. This move, and a term spent at the Acad&eacute;mie Julian in Paris, heralded a significant change in Clausen's output. In the country he was able to paint pictures of rural life which showed, as he stated, &#145;people doing simple things under good conditions of lighting: and there was always landscape. And nothing was made easy for you: you had to dig out what you wanted&#146;  (Clausen, &#145;Autobiographical notes&#146;, 19). The resulting works revealed Clausen's allegiance to the almost photographic detail of the rustic naturalist painter Jules Bastien-Lepage, whose work was much admired by the younger artists of his generation. With subjects such as <span class="italic">Winter Work</span> (1883&#150;4; Tate Collection), shown at the Grosvenor Gallery and so obviously different in treatment from those of more conservative Victorian painters of rural life, he stormed the citadel of &#145;aesthetic&#146; and late Pre-Raphaelite painting.<br>
<br>Clausen's radical posture was confirmed by his role in the founding of the New English Art Club in 1886 and by his attempts to defend continental methods of art training in a polemical article, &#145;The English school in peril: a reply&#146;, published in the <span class="italic">Magazine of Art</span> in 1887. This was followed by two essays on Bastien-Lepage in 1888 and 1892 in which he attempted to show that only through objective recording of appearances was the painter able to free himself from studio conventions. &#145;All his personages&#146;, he wrote, &#145;are placed before us in the most satisfying completeness, without the appearance of artifice, but as they live; and without comment, as far as is possible on the author's part&#146;  (Clausen, &#145;Bastien-Lepage and modern realism&#146;, 114). The exemplification of this new objectivity is found in <span class="italic">The Girl at the Gate</span> (1889; Tate Collection), a work that Clausen showed at the final Grosvenor Gallery summer exhibition and which was purchased by the Chantrey Trust for the national collection.<br>
<br>However, while he was working on this picture, Clausen became interested in a broader range of technical and atmospheric effects. Closer contact with the work of the impressionists led him by 1892, in works such as <span class="italic">The Mowers</span> (Usher Gallery, Lincoln), to abandon the grey tonalities of Bastien-Lepage for a much brighter palette. This change is apparent in <span class="italic">Evening Song</span> (1893; priv. coll.), of which the critic D. S. MacColl noted that the painter was moving &#145;in the direction of colour and shaking off the photographic idea of drawing&#146;  (<span class="italic">Saturday Review</span>, 13 May 1893, 515). In 1890 Clausen moved to the village of Widdington, Essex, and it was there that the rural scenes of the 1890s were painted in the rickyards, barns, and fields around nearby Newport. These images present a glowing report upon country life, linking Clausen to writers such as Rider Haggard and Charles Masterman, for whom the values of rural England were infinitely preferable to those of the metropolis. Clausen, in association with Thomas Hardy, supported the struggle to retain Stonehenge when it was purchased and threatened with shipment to America in 1899.<br>
<br>Such was Clausen's standing in the late 1890s that after his election as associate of the Royal Academy in 1895 he was invited to teach at the Royal Academy Schools. Then, in 1904, he was appointed professor of painting. The two lecture series he delivered during this appointment were extremely popular with students, and were later published as <span class="italic">Six Lectures on Painting</span> (1904) and <span class="italic">Aims and Ideals in Art</span> (1906). Throughout this period of intense activity, the quality of Clausen's work remained undiminished. Works like <span class="italic">Sons of the Soil</span> (1901; priv. coll.), <span class="italic">The Golden Barn</span> (1901; Walker Art Gallery, Liverpool), and <span class="italic">Harvest, in the Beanfield</span> (1904; Durban Art Gallery, South Africa), exemplify the painter's ability, acquired from studying the works of Raphael, to find &#145;naturalness and variety&#146; in the grouping of figures  (Clausen, <span class="italic">Lectures</span>, 219). About 1910 Clausen's peasant figures became more heroic and monumental, and by the time of the First World War he had introduced a new strand into his work, in the nudes and intimate interiors painted at his London home at Carlton Hill, St John's Wood.<br>
<br>As an official war artist in 1918 Clausen was assigned to the Woolwich arsenal. The monumental work that he produced, <span class="italic">In the Gun Factory at Woolwich Arsenal</span> (1918; IWM), recording the cavernous interior, the huge radial crane, and the tiny workmen, was regarded as one of the most successful war works to have been commissioned by the Ministry of Information. It led directly to a further commission to paint <span class="italic">Returning to the Reconquered Land</span> (1919; Canadian War Museum, Ottawa) for Lord Beaverbrook's Canadian War Memorials Fund and to a private scheme to decorate High Royd, a house near Huddersfield, owned by G. P. Norton (1921). In 1925 Clausen was chosen as one of the muralists for a series &#145;The Building of Britain&#146; in St Stephen's Hall in the Palace of Westminster. Working alongside painters such as William Rothenstein, Charles Sims, and D. Y. Cameron, he painted <span class="italic">The English people, in spite of persecution for heresy, persist in gathering secretly to read aloud Wycliffe's English Bible</span> (1927), a work that was praised as being &#145;simple in arrangement &hellip; of singular beauty &hellip; [and] deeply moving&#146;  (H. Furst, <span class="italic">Apollo</span>, Sept 1927, 119). Following the unveiling, the painter was knighted by George V for his services to art, on 7 July 1927.<br>
<br>Throughout the inter-war period Clausen continued to live in London, although he now maintained a country cottage at Duton Hill, Essex, close to the home of one of his most faithful patrons, W. F. Crittal (1887&#150;1956). The surrounding fields provided material for a succession of misty landscapes which became Clausen's hallmark. When not at work in the Royal Academy Schools, of which he was temporarily appointed director and master of the painting school in 1927, following the resignation and then death of its keeper, Charles Sims, he could be found pushing his bike to favourite sketching haunts in the Essex countryside. With the outbreak of the Second World War, he and Lady Clausen left London to live at Cold Ash, Newbury, Berkshire, where he continued to work intermittently. Throughout the war Lady Clausen's health was poor, and her death in March 1944 was followed by that of the artist himself on 22 November 1944, at Cold Ash. A few months earlier Clausen had received a letter from Kenneth Clark inviting him to stage a retrospective exhibition at the National Gallery. With characteristic modesty he wrote, &#145;I think such an exhibition as you suggest would be more appropriate when I am dead and indifferent to praise or censure! However, I will help you all I can&#146;  (letter dated 10 June 1944, McConkey, <span class="italic">Sir George Clausen, RA</span>, 98).<br>
