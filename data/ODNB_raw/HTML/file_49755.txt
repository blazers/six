</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Gowing, Sir  Lawrence Burnett</span>  (1918&#150;1991), <span class="occ">painter and art historian</span>, was born on 21 April 1918 at 53 Stamford Hill, London, the son of Horace Burnett Gowing (<i>d</i>. 1944), master draper, and his wife, Clara Louise Lawrence. His grandfather was a treasurer of the Pawnbroker's Benevolent Society. Gowing's oil painting <span class="italic">Mare Street, Hackney</span> (1937&#150;8) shows a no. 31 double-decker tram going past the family drapery shop as well as the newly introduced Belisha beacon. He attended the Quaker preparatory school the Downs, Colwall, from 1927 to 1932, where the ex-Slade student Maurice Feild arrived to teach art in 1928 and encouraged the boys to paint outdoors in oil on 15 by 11 inch strawboard during their Wednesday afternoon hobby time. From 1932 he studied at another Quaker school&#151;Leighton Park, Reading&#151;until in 1935 he was privately coached for matriculation, living at home at Oakleigh Park, London. At this stage his parents intended him to become an insurance clerk. But at Leighton Park he had heard Feild's friend W. H. Auden (who taught at the Downs from 1932 to 1935) lecture on film as a career, and Gowing wrote to him for advice. Auden replied from Iceland: &#145;You only want to become a film director because you think it is the art of the future. It isn't. Art is the art of the future&#146;  (Laughton, 176). Auden introduced Gowing to the painter William Coldstream, whose pupil he became in 1936 at 12 Fitzroy Street, London.<br>
<br>This location became the home of the School of Drawing and Painting, set up by Coldstream, Claude Rogers, Victor Pasmore, and Graham Bell. It became known eponymously, after its move in February 1938 to a vacant motor showroom at 314/316 Euston Road, as the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/64717/', "Euston Road School")</script>. Inspired by C&eacute;zanne and Degas, and rejecting what they saw as the false realism of the Royal Academy, the pupils struggled to find an objective, verifiable, and, indeed, measurable approach to the painting of their everyday surroundings. Gowing closely identified with Coldstream's penchant for discrete paint strokes, <i>tache</i> against <i>tache</i>. He befriended another pupil, the ballet critic and writer on art <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/31722/', "Adrian Durham Stokes")</script>, whose literary executor and editor of his collected works Gowing became. Stokes's <span class="italic">Colour and Form</span> (1936&#150;7) profoundly influenced Gowing, not only for its discussion of &#145;surface colour&#146; and the carving and modelling of space, but also for its championing of C&eacute;zanne. Stokes's concern for a &#145;sense of the existent world&#146; was equally influential  (<span class="italic">Critical Writings</span>, 11). Both contributed to Coldstream's retrospective exhibition at the South London Art Gallery, Camberwell, in 1962.<br>
<br>The sale of <span class="italic">Self-Portrait in Oakleigh Avenue</span> (1936) to Kenneth Clark, director of the National Gallery and also a backer of the School of Drawing and Painting, persuaded Gowing's father to let him become a painter. Having moved into Stokes's old top-floor studio at 6 Fitzroy Street at a rent of &pound;78 a year, Gowing painted chest patients lying out on the iron balconies of University College Hospital, theatrical backdrops, nudes, and portraits, including one of a young Alfie Bass. He survived by selling work and writing for the <span class="italic">Dancing Times</span>. He was drawn into the life of adjacent Bloomsbury and met Julia Frances Strachey (1901&#150;1979), daughter of Oliver Strachey, codebreaker, widow of Stephen Tomlin, and author of the minor novel <span class="italic">Cheerful Weather for the Wedding</span> (1932). She was seventeen years his senior. Julia's impression of Gowing&#151;&#145;With his long, slender legs and arms, Lawrence reminded me of a daddy-long-legs&#146;  (Partridge, 162)&#151;did not prevent them moving into 88 Charlotte Street and living together from 1940 to 1948. They married on 28 March 1952, although they then spent much time apart. <span class="italic">Lady with Book</span> (1941&#150;2), now in the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford, is a portrait of Julia reading Percy Lubbock's <span class="italic">Art of Fiction</span> in the sitting room at Chilton Foliat, Wiltshire, warmed by a slender white enamel oil stove.<br>
<br>The Second World War broke up the Euston Road School. Gowing's Quaker schooling and Bloomsbury connections lay behind his conscientious objection: remarkably, the tribunal gave him total exemption on condition that he continued to paint! Bombing led to his abandoning London in favour of, first, Chilton Foliat, then Shalbourne, Wiltshire, where the countryside became his prime subject matter. This engagement with landscape was fuelled not only by his various reading of Sturt, Grigson, Piper, and Gilbert White, but by his admiration for C&eacute;zanne and Courbet. Writing too became the adjunct to painting: he contributed anonymously <span class="italic">Notes of a Painter</span> to John Lehmann's <span class="roman">Penguin New Writing</span> series, and in 1945 the eccentric dialogue &#145;Painter and apple&#146;, based on a series of fourteen still lifes entitled <span class="italic">Green Apples</span> (1940&#150;46), to <span class="italic">Arts</span>. Gowing and his wife returned to London in 1943, first to Paultons Square, then 25 Wellington Square, Chelsea; they were fire-watchers based at Chelsea Public Library.<br>
<br>Before the end of the war, Gowing started to teach at Camberwell School of Arts and Crafts, where Coldstream and Pasmore were recreating the Euston Road School. In 1945 he received his first portrait commission, <span class="italic">Lord Lindsay</span>, for Balliol College; other portraits included <span class="italic">Cecil Day-Lewis</span>, <span class="italic">Lord Halifax</span>, and <span class="italic">Clement Attlee</span>. The summers of 1946 and 1947 were spent landscape painting in Sutton, between Pulborough and Petworth; he later described his confrontation with nature, stripping off his clothes to make himself &#145;defenceless against the place&#146;  (<span class="italic">Lawrence Gowing</span>, 30). In 1947, after a chance encounter with Robin Darwin on a bus, he applied for, and in 1948 was somewhat surprisingly appointed to, the post of professor of fine art, Newcastle, where he remained until 1958. In 1948 he had a very successful one-man exhibition at the Leicester Gallery, run by Oliver Brown. In 1949 he was diagnosed as tuberculous and underwent sanatorium treatment. He used this opportunity to write a book on Vermeer, published in 1952, that established his reputation as an art historian. John Pope-Hennessy remarked that the difference between the unrevised and revised versions was that &#145;in the interval &hellip; Lawrence had transposed his text into the key of Adrian Stokes&#146;  (Wollheim, 22). In 1954 he organized a major C&eacute;zanne exhibition, shown in Edinburgh and the Tate Gallery, in which he controversially challenged the conventional dating of several major works.<br>
<br>In 1959 Gowing became principal of the new Chelsea School of Art, formed from the merger of the Chelsea and Regent Street polytechnics. Under Gowing, Chelsea became a model for art education: art history was integrated with studio practice; an option programme ranging across science, music, philosophy, and literature was introduced; and with Michael Doran's help the foundations of a specialist modern art history library were laid. His lectures were always engaging: for example, he divided, Ruskin-style, painters into those who used red and blue (expressionists) or green and yellow (himself).<br>
<br>Gowing resigned from Chelsea in 1965 in order to become keeper of the British collections and deputy director of the Tate Gallery (despite some chagrin at his failure to become director). The highlights of this period were his re-hanging of Turner's work and two exhibitions in America, &#145;Turner: imagination and reality&#146;, connecting the colour explorations of Turner's later works with the abstract expressionists through the simple expedient of removing their frames, and &#145;Matisse&#146;, both shown at the Museum of Modern Art, New York, in 1966. A preoccupation with Matisse also resulted in an exhibition at the Hayward Gallery (1968) and a film for the Arts Council, <span class="italic">Matisse, a Kind of Paradise</span> (1969). During this period Gowing's own painting attained its most abstraction in such works as <span class="italic">Wood: Parabolic Perspective</span> (1963) or <span class="italic">Track through Willis's Wood V</span> (1964): the abstract qualities were translated into his later, much looser landscapes, which seemed to imitate the effects of watercolour in oil paint.<br>
<br>In 1967 Gowing became professor of fine art at Leeds University, where he remained until 1975. Having divorced his first wife earlier in the year, on 22 December 1967 he married Jennifer Akam Wallis (<i>b</i>. 1927), lecturer, and daughter of Sydney Herbert Wallis, civil servant with the Board of Trade. He and his second wife set up home at 49 Walham Grove, Fulham, where they brought up three daughters.<br>
<br>After arranging the Hogarth exhibition at the Tate in 1971, Gowing organized in 1973 the &#145;Watercolours by C&eacute;zanne&#146; exhibition at Newcastle and London, which led to his involvement in &#145;C&eacute;zanne: the Late Works&#146;, an exhibition (accompanied by a book) at the Museum of Modern Art, New York, the editorship of C&eacute;zanne's Basel sketchbooks, and <span class="italic">C&eacute;zanne: the Early Works</span> (1988). He was a member of the Arts Council from 1970 to 1972 and from 1977 to 1981. In 1975 he began a ten-year spell as Slade professor of fine art. This coincided with a stylistic development in his own painting: in 1976 he embarked on a series of figurative painting, using his students and studio assistants to cover his body with paint or spray paint around its naked Vitruvian shape: these were shown to less than critical acclaim at his 1982 retrospective at the Serpentine Gallery. On retirement in 1985 he went to the National Gallery, Washington, as a research fellow, later becoming a curator at the Phillips Collection. Appointed a CBE in 1952, he was made a knight in 1982. He was elected an associate of the Royal Academy in 1978 and a Royal Academician in 1989. He died on 5 February 1991 at Charing Cross Hospital, Fulham, London; he was survived by his second wife and three daughters.<br>
<br>Gowing's enthusiasms were catholic and sometimes eccentric&#151;the minor Welsh landscape painter Thomas Jones, Joseph Beuys, Francis Bacon's use of medical illustration, Lucian Freud, as well as Matisse and C&eacute;zanne. His visible and audible enthusiasm, emphasized by his peculiar taste for black leather trousers and a rhetorically effective expectorative stutter, made him a remarkable advocate for painting as seen by a painter: this proved attractive to the wider audience of his three BBC television series, <span class="italic">Three Painters</span> (1984, 1986, and 1987), on Massaccio, Vermeer, Brueghel, Goya, Matisse, Rembrandt, Turner, Giotto, and, inevitably, C&eacute;zanne.<br>
