<span class="headword">King <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Gore-Browne]</span>, Dame  Ethel  Locke</span>  (1864&#150;1956), <span class="occ">motor-racing promoter and hospital patron</span>, was born on 3 June 1864 at Government House, Hobart, Tasmania, the younger daughter of Colonel Sir Thomas Gore-Browne (1807&#150;1887), governor of Tasmania, and his wife, Harriet Louisa, daughter of James Campbell of Craigie House, Ayrshire. Wilfred Gore-Browne (1856&#150;1928), bishop of Kimberley and Kuruman, and Sir Francis Gore-Browne (1860&#150;1922), an authority on company law, were her brothers. Ethel left Tasmania in 1868 and spent 1870 and 1871 in Bermuda during her father's term as governor of the colony. The family subsequently returned to England.<br>
<br>On 3 January 1884, at St Mary Abbots, Kensington, at the age of nineteen, Ethel married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/66280/', "Hugh Fortescue Locke King (1848&#150;1926)")</script>. They were married by her uncle, the bishop of Winchester. Her husband was the eldest surviving son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15584/', "Peter John Locke King (1811&#150;1885), MP")</script>. After their wedding Ethel and her husband travelled to Cairo in Egypt where they spent the remainder of the winter. There were no children from the marriage. Wintering abroad became a regular practice, and after Hugh's father died in 1885 the couple acquired the Mena House, once a royal lodge used by the khedive Isma&#145;il, as a home for themselves. The house was near the pyramids and they turned it into a hotel, enlarging and furnishing it with the proceeds from the sale of parts of the Portmore estate which Hugh had inherited. Because of the couple's extravagance the hotel ran at a loss and was eventually sold at some point after 1900.<br>
<br>Back in England, Ethel Locke King played an important part in her husband's management of his property and in farming his estates in Surrey and elsewhere. She was also involved in his decision in 1906 to build the world's first banked motor-racing course in a &#145;swampy, rabbit infested corner of Surrey&#146;  (Gardner, 14). According to his own account the idea had come to Locke King at Brescia, in northern Italy, after the Coppa Florio motor race meeting in 1905, when he had spoken to some of the owners and drivers of the French, German, and Italian cars which had been competing. In reply to his question about why no English car was entered, he was told that the English had no practice in racing cars at speed. A month later, hearing it suggested that a circular track was needed where the cars could be watched over the whole course, Locke King realized that a suitable site lay on his own land.<br>
<br>Motor racing on roads was against the law and, in conjunction with the Royal Automobile Club, Hugh and Ethel Locke King founded the British Automobile Racing Club. The cost of the enterprise escalated and Hugh's health suffered under the strain of meeting demands for more and more money to pay for the project. When they were faced with bankruptcy in 1907 the task was largely taken over by Ethel, who was supported by her brother Francis, their long-standing friend Baron de Rodakowski, and other members of the family. It is doubtful if the circuit ever made a profit, but an industrial estate was later developed on adjacent land.<br>
<br>The Brooklands track was officially opened on 17 June 1907 and a celebratory circuit of the track was headed by Ethel driving her Itala car &#145;Bambo&#146;, which she subsequently raced, notably in the Ladies' Bracelet Handicap of 1908. It was felt that women drivers should not wear smocks like the men, so they sported coloured scarves instead. Ethel was also interested in flying, and Brooklands became one of the pioneering centres for powered flight. On 29 October 1909 she made a flight of ten minutes' duration and reached a height of 200 feet in the Gnome-engined pusher-biplane &#145;la Gypaete&#146;, piloted by the French aviator Louis Paulhan.<br>
<br>In November 1912 Ethel became vice-president of the north Surrey division of the British Red Cross, and she commenced her war service with that organization on the outbreak of the First World War. A spectacular field day was held by the army, at Brooklands in June 1914, to publicize Voluntary Aid Detachments. The event was organized by Ethel and attended by Queen Alexandra and her sister the empress Maria Feodrovna of Russia. Subsequently, Ethel received a letter of thanks and congratulations from the queen.<br>
<br>During the course of the First World War, Ethel Locke King established fourteen auxiliary hospitals in the county, some of which were in houses owned by her husband. One of these, Vigo House, was given to Weybridge in 1923 for use as its cottage hospital. Ethel became assistant county director of the British Red Cross for Surrey, and later she was honorary commandant for Surrey (Weybridge). For her war service she was made DBE on 1 January 1918, and she also received the order of St John.<br>
<br>The War Office took over Brooklands in 1914 and the Royal Flying Corps established its headquarters there. Having started a flying school at Brooklands in 1912, Vickers began building aeroplanes at the site three years later. It was not until 1920 that the motor track reopened. During the following two decades the circuit at Brooklands became renowned, especially for its steeped, banked turn. Motor-racing events at Brooklands became not only great social events, but the circuit also played a key role in British motor-racing history. A number of leading drivers, including Malcolm Campbell, George Eyston, Raymond Mays, Kay Petre, and John Cobb, first came to prominence by winning races at Brooklands.<br>
<br>Hugh Locke King died in 1926, leaving his entire estate to his widow, who was then sixty-one years old. As well as becoming managing director and chief shareholder of the Brooklands Estate Company, Dame Ethel also ran the motor track and the aerodrome. In 1936 she transferred the undertaking to a new company, Byfleet Estates Ltd; and later that year Brooklands (Weybridge) Ltd was formed to acquire the track and aerodrome. Ethel subsequently moved to a house at Caen's Hill on the right of the &#145;Shell Way&#146; entrance road. Motor racing finally ceased in 1939, and most of the site was sold off for development purposes after the Second World War. Part of the track survived, however, including the famous banked turn, and a Brooklands Museum was opened there.<br>
<br>Dame Ethel died at her home, Caen's Hill, Weybridge, Surrey, on 5 August 1956, at the age of ninety-two. In an obituary in <span class="italic">The Times</span> the earl of Portsmouth paid tribute to her trenchant wit and courageous nature, adding that &#145;She had a carriage that had no need of pride yet added inches to her slight, gallant figure&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 14 August 1956).<br>
