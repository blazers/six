<span class="headword">Punch <span class="st"> [Ponce]</span>,  John</span>  (1599&#150;1672/3), <span class="occ">theologian</span>, was born in Cork. Nothing is known of his parents. At an early age he went to study in the Irish college at Louvain, where he entered the Franciscan order. After studying philosophy at Cologne he moved to Rome to join the newly established Irish college at St Isidore's on 7 September 1625. Upon graduating, he taught philosophy and later theology at St Isidore's. By 1630 he was rector of St Isidore's, and on 8 June that year became governor of the Ludovisian college at Rome for the education of Irish secular priests. <br>
<br>During the 1640s Punch was an active agent at Rome for the Catholic confederation of Ireland. He did not trust the royalists and strongly supported the stance taken by Giovanni Rinuccini, papal nuncio to Ireland from 1645 to 1649. After the defeat of the confederates several Irish exiles established themselves in Paris, where they engaged in bitter recriminations; Punch himself was based mainly in Paris from 1648, lecturing there and at Lyons. Taking exception to Richard Bellings's criticisms of Rinuccini, Punch published his <span class="italic">D. R. Bellingi vindiciae eversae</span> in 1653. This defended the nuncio's rather questionable 1648 excommunication of those confederates who supported a truce with protestant forces commanded by Murrough O'Brien, Lord Inchiquin. Punch also attacked John Callaghan, an associate of Bellings, for his Jansenist views. In a withering riposte Bellings characterized Punch as having spent too long abroad in academia to appreciate the realities of Irish politics. Throughout the 1650s Irish Franciscan refugees continued to arrive in Paris, arousing the ire of the local friars. In September 1657 Punch was given jurisdiction over the Irish Franciscans to investigate accusations made against them. <br>
<br>Punch is best remembered for being foremost among the Irish scholars under Luke Wadding at St Isidore's who contributed hugely to the seventeenth-century revival of Scotism. From 1634 he assisted Wadding in the laborious task of producing the first complete edition of the works of John Duns Scotus. Wadding describes him as combining a subtle intellect with the capacity to communicate knowledge. Punch's first major work, <span class="italic">Philosophiae cursus integer</span>, was published at Rome in three volumes in 1642&#150;3. The celebrated Scotist theologian Mastrius challenged Punch's conclusions, leading the latter to reply in 1648 with the <span class="italic">Appendix apologetica</span>. In the <span class="italic">Appendix</span> Punch declared that while he accepted Scotus's conclusions, he did not agree with all his proofs. Mastrius subsequently accepted the force of Punch's reasoning. In 1652 Punch published a textbook on Scotism, derived mainly from his <span class="italic">Cursus</span>. This was a hugely significant contribution to the study of Scotism, as it was the first time a complete course of Scotist theology, as opposed to the traditional commentaries, had been written. He continued to publish books related to this subject during the 1650s and early 1660s, the most significant being his magnum opus, <span class="italic">Commentarii theologici</span>, in 1661. He died between early 1672 and early 1673, presumably at Paris.<br>
