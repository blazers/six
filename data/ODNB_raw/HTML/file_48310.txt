<span class="headword">Fantosme,  Jordan</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1170&#150;1180), <span class="occ">historian</span>, was the author of an important Anglo-Norman poem on the war of 1173&#150;4 between Henry II and his rebellious eldest son, Henry the Young King (preserved in Durham Cathedral, MS C.N.27, fols. 139<i>r</i>&#150;167<i>v</i>; Lincoln Cathedral, MS 104). He probably composed his chronicle, as this work has become known, in England in late 1174 or 1175, but the place and date of his birth and of his death are unknown, and all external biographical evidence is circumstantial. The significance of the epithet Fantosme, from the Latin <i>fantasma</i> (&#145;apparition&#146;, &#145;ghost&#146;), is unclear. It may refer to his pale appearance or perhaps to an elusive character.<br>
<br>Almost certainly intended for recitation at court, Fantosme's subtle and diplomatic poem celebrates the victory of Henry II, lauds the fidelity and bravery of his loyal barons, but equally urges reconciliation between father and son. While gently censuring the Young King for the folly of rebellion, Fantosme reminds Henry II of the grievances of his heir, who, although crowned, has been denied effective power or a realm of his own. Fantosme likewise has Henry II admit responsibility for Thomas Becket's death, but regards the miraculous correlation of Henry's penance at Canterbury and the capture of William the Lion, king of Scots, on 13 July 1174, as clear proof that St Thomas and the king have become reconciled.<br>
<br>Fantosme's detailed knowledge of Anglo-Scottish political and military affairs, coupled with a measured sympathy for William the Lion's <i>casus belli</i> and lavish praise for the king's younger brother, Earl David of Huntingdon, suggests intimate contact with the Scottish court, possibly at a diplomatic level. Fantosme seems to align himself strongly with an element of William's court headed by Ingelram, bishop of Glasgow, and Waltheof, earl of Dunbar, that urged peace with England in 1173, and is highly critical of influential but unnamed &#145;aliens&#146; who incite William into a foolish and disastrous war.<br>
<br>Internal evidence also indicates Fantosme's widespread connections, for example with the citizens of London, and particularly close links with the baronage of Yorkshire and Northumbria, focusing his attention on such northern lords as Robert de Vaux, Roger Fitzrichard, Odinel de Umfraville, the Stutevilles, and others. Fantosme claims to have been with the forces of Ranulf de Glanville when the English surprised and captured William the Lion as he breakfasted outside Alnwick Castle on 13 July 1174. Certainly, in its vivid and detailed portrayal of warfare and chivalry in the later twelfth century, his poem must rank second only to the <span class="italic">Histoire de Guillaume le Mar&eacute;chal</span> (the Anglo-Norman verse biography of William (I) Marshal), and Ambroise's <span class="italic">History of the Holy War</span>, an eyewitness account of the third crusade.<br>
<br>The rarity of the name Fantosme has led to general agreement that the poet is identical with the man who was a clerk of the bishop of Winchester and master of the schools, prominent in the household first of Henry de Blois (<i>d</i>. 1171), then of his successor, Richard of Ilchester (<i>d</i>. 1188), though the link remains unsubstantiated. The Jordanus Fantasma of Winchester was a man of some importance, who testified <i>viva voce</i> for Henry de Blois in 1160, and whose house in Minster Street was regarded as a prominent landmark in contemporary charters. His claim to a teaching monopoly in the city's schools was recognized by Archbishop Theobald in a letter to Pope Adrian IV (<i>r</i>. 1154&#150;9), preserved by John of Salisbury, concerning a dispute between Fantosme and another of the bishop of Winchester's clerks, Master John Joicel.<br>
<br>Fantosme may have studied under the philosopher Gilbert de la Porr&eacute;e, when the latter was bishop of Poitiers (1142&#150;54), as a twelfth-century St Amand manuscript of Gilbert's commentaries on Boethius contains a miniature showing the master with his most distinguished pupils at his feet, including Ivo of Chartres and one Jordanus Fantasma. No firm evidence links this scholar and Jordan the poet, but the influence of Proven&ccedil;al lyric on the poem, and its accordance with Porretanian views of free will, do not rule out this connection. An early thirteenth-century manuscript labels a Latin poem on the death and incarnation of Christ as the &#145;Poem of Jordan Fantasma&#146; (<span class="italic">Rithmus Jordanis Fantasmatis</span>), though again the connection between Jordan the poet or Jordan the clerk remains circumstantial.<br>
<br>From his involvement in a serious dispute in 1171, Fantosme appears as an unscrupulous litigant, manipulating papal appeals and playing off rivalries between secular and ecclesiastical courts to gain letters barring prosecution witnesses from appearing. In the last known stage of the case, the pope ordered Bishop Bartholomew of Exeter (<i>d</i>. 1184) to suspend Fantosme and to deprive him if found guilty of active intimidation.<br>
<br>If clerk and poet are one and the same, however, Jordan Fantosme was in a position influential enough by 1174 to attempt to reconcile Henry II and his son by means of a courtly praise poem, remarkable as much for the insight it affords into the world of Angevin politics as for its complex and innovative prosody.<br>
