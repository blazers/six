<span class="headword">Fitzcharles,  Charles</span>, earl of Plymouth  (<em>c.</em>1657&#150;1680), <span class="occ">courtier and army officer</span>, was born, probably in Bruges, in 1657, the illegitimate son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5144/', "Charles II (1630&#150;1685)")</script>, and Catherine Pegge (<i>d</i>. 1678). His mother's liaison with the exiled king had come to an end by 1658, and he was brought up by her in the Spanish Netherlands with the financial support of his maternal grandfather, Thomas Pegge of Yeldersley, a Derbyshire squire and partisan of the royalist cause. After receiving a rudimentary education in Flanders&#151;which subsequently earned him the scathing epithet of Don Carlos from the English court&#151;Fitzcharles arrived in London in 1672 and gained for himself a reputation as a quick-witted and personable youth. Acknowledged by the king as his natural son, his endeavours&#151;for a time&#151;thoroughly captivated Charles II, and he was briefly even considered to be a serious political rival to the duke of Monmouth in any future struggle for the succession to the throne. On 8 October 1672 Michael Boyle, archbishop of Dublin, reported a rumour that Fitzcharles was to be given a commission as the colonel of the Queen's regiment of foot and an allowance of &pound;10,000 per annum. <br>
<br>Although this came to nothing, Fitzcharles was ennobled as Baron Dartmouth, Viscount Totnes, and earl of Plymouth on 28 July 1675. Granted a royal warrant for his coat of arms on 20 October 1675, he was also allocated a pension of &pound;2000 a year from the excise&#151;a sum which was later increased to &pound;4000 per annum. With his finances thus secured, he moved into a suite of fashionable apartments at the Cockpit in the palace of Whitehall, placing himself at the very heart of the court and the governmental machine. Unfortunately, the effect of this sudden paternal indulgence&#151;after early neglect&#151;was seriously damaging to both his character and behaviour. He accrued debts at an alarming rate, failed to pay his servants on time, and hung his rooms with the finest and most expensive damask. It was alleged that he languished in bed every day until well after noon, and his mother sadly lamented that &#145;much ill company [had] made him loose&#146; (<span class="italic">Sixth Report</span>, HMC, 388; <span class="italic">Leeds MSS</span>, 18). A plan to settle his debts in return for his promise to enrol at Cambridge University and to finally dismiss his Roman Catholic servants, whom he had brought over from France and Flanders, was set forth but never seriously pursued. <br>
<br>However, Plymouth was soon preparing for his entry into high politics, and gained a valuable ally in the form of the lord treasurer, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20884/', "Thomas Osborne, earl of Danby (1632&#150;1712)")</script>, who accepted his friendship as a valuable commodity &#145;not easily to be removed&#146;  (Browning, 2.527). In the summer of 1677 Plymouth took service with the Dutch army and acted as a useful conduit for the exchange of intelligence between Charles II, Danby, and William III, prince of Orange. On his return to England, via Paris, he emphasized his credentials as a protestant career soldier who had chosen to serve the Dutch state when the duke of Monmouth had not. He was married &#145;very privately&#146; to Danby's third daughter, Lady Bridget Osborne (1661&#150;1718), at the parish church at Wimbledon, Surrey, on 19 September 1678. Having, at last, taken his seat in the House of Lords on 8 May 1679, he cheerfully assented to the trial and condemnation of the Roman Catholic peers and gave qualified support to his by now beleaguered father-in-law. Danby's fall did, however, dramatically affect his position at court and coincided with renewed Moorish assaults upon the English colony of Tangier. <br>
<br>With interest in the stricken city rising to unprecedented levels at Whitehall and Westminster, Plymouth now took the lead in recruiting gentleman volunteers for a relief expedition, and was commissioned on 13 July 1680 as the colonel of a new regiment, the 4th foot, which was being raised especially for service in the defence of Tangier. Anxious not to miss the fighting, he had however already left for the colony, together with his gentleman recruits and a scratch force drawn from the existing military establishment. His arrival in Tangier on 2 July 1680 served to bolster the morale of the &#145;Old Souldiers&#146; among the garrison, and to compel the few remaining merchants and &#145;burghers&#146; to assist in the city's defence  (Ross, 4). Having won glowing reports for his energy and zeal in drilling the troops, he was entrusted with leading one of the columns that assaulted the Moorish positions outside the city walls on 20 September 1680. Achieving complete surprise, the British soldiers quickly reoccupied the entrenchments and outlying forts that had been abandoned to the enemy years before, and Plymouth &#145;did not let any action pass either on Foot, or Horseback, in which [he] had not a share&#146;  (<span class="italic">Particular Relation</span>, 4). By nightfall the Moors had been thrown back repeatedly and Plymouth's soldiers were put to work building a stockade on the site of the Pole Fort, which effectively served to anchor the centre of the British position. Unfortunately, the ruined fort resembled &#145;a Pond without Thatch or Cover save the Clouds and Sky&#146;, and a sustained downpour dampened spirits and washed out the trenches  (Ross, 11). Chilled to the bone but thirsty after the day's hard fighting, Plymouth now drank from contaminated water and fell ill with dysentery. After being carried back to the city, his condition worsened and he died of the &#145;Bloody flux&#146; on 17 October 1680. <br>
<br>Plymouth's servants brought his body back to England in November 1680, but his estates were in such disorder and so burdened by debt that they were not permitted to land at Deal until the Treasury promised to pay the captain of the <i>Foresight</i> the sums owed for their passage home. In the meantime, Plymouth's corpse was escorted to London by his friend Charles, Lord Mordaunt, and was honourably interred on 18 January 1681 in Henry VII's chapel, Westminster Abbey, in the vault vacated by the removal of the bodies of the Cromwell family. <br>
<br>In the absence of an heir Plymouth's title became extinct, while his estate was placed at the disposal of his numerous creditors in December 1686. His widow subsequently began a relationship with her chaplain, Philip Bisse (1666&#150;1721), who later became bishop of Hereford. The couple were married in secret in August 1704, and publicly acknowledged their union two years later. Plymouth had a younger sister, Catherine (<i>b</i>. 1658), who is often claimed to have taken orders at Dunkirk and lived to an extraordinary age. However, on the balance of probability it would appear that she died as an infant, and that her identity was confused with that of her half-sister, Justinia. This child was born to Catherine Pegge and Sir Edward Green, bt, shortly after their marriage in 1667, and was recorded as being among the English ladies at the convent at Pontoise. She died there in 1717. <br>
<br>A mezzotint by J. Savage shows Plymouth, shortly before his death, as a plump-faced young man, with the eyes and nose that he had unmistakably inherited from his father.<br>
