<span class="headword">Bradbury,  Henry Riley</span>  (1829&#150;1860), <span class="occ">writer on printing</span>, the eldest of the seven children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/76346/', "William Bradbury (1800&#150;1869)")</script>, co-owner of the printing and publishing firm Bradbury and Evans, and his wife, Sarah, was born on 20 September 1829 at Wingrove Place, Clerkenwell, London. He was baptized at St James's Church, Clerkenwell, on 21 October 1829, and his younger brother was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/56409/', "William Hardwick Bradbury")</script>, with whom he later worked as a publisher. In 1850 Henry went to Vienna to study at the imperial printing office. There he became acquainted with the art of nature printing, a process whereby natural objects are impressed into metal plates, from which electrotypes are taken that can be used in relief printing. Bradbury afterwards claimed that he invented this process, but the imperial printer, Alois Auer, in <span class="italic">Discovery of the Natural Printing Process</span> (Vienna, 1854, in English, German, Italian, and French), published six facsimile letters from Bradbury purporting to indicate that he first saw the process in Vienna. Certainly Bradbury brought the process back to Britain and there perfected it. In 1855 he produced in folio the fine &#145;nature-printed&#146; plates to <span class="italic">Ferns of Great Britain and Ireland</span>, written by Thomas Moore, curator of the Chelsea Botanic Gardens, and edited by the eminent botanist John Lindley (1859). These were followed by the plates to William Grosart Johnstone's and Alexander Croall's <span class="italic">Nature-Printed British Sea-Weeds</span> (4 vols., 1859&#150;60), a copy of which G. H. Lewes asked John Blackwood to obtain for him. Bradbury consolidated his knowledge of nature printing first in a lecture on 11 May 1855 at the Royal Institution (London, 1856), translated badly into German by an employee of Bradbury and Evans to counteract Auer's <span class="italic">Das Benehmen eines jungen Engl&auml;nders namens Henry Bradbury</span> (Vienna, 1854) and his <span class="italic">Discovery</span>. Bradbury's amplified disquisition, <span class="italic">Autotypography, or, Art of Nature-Printing</span>, was printed for private circulation in 1860.<br>
<br>Bradbury lectured to the Royal Institution on 9 May 1856 about a different topic, the ease with which banknotes were being forged; this was published under the title <span class="italic">On the Security and Manufacture of Bank Notes</span> by his father's firm in 1856, and illustrated with plates by John Leighton FSA. About this time Bradbury established his own firm, Bradbury and Wilkinson, in Fetter Lane, London. In 1860 he produced <span class="italic">Specimens of Bank-Note Engraving</span> incorporating samples of banknote paper manufactured by T. H. Saunders.<br>
<br>On 14 May 1858 Bradbury again addressed the Royal Institution, this time attempting &#145;to illustrate &hellip; the power and the spread of printing as an intellectual agent in the destinies of man&#146;  (Bigmore and Wyman, 1.77). This address, issued in 1858 as <span class="italic">Printing: its Dawn, Day, and Destiny</span>, reviewed letterpress, intaglio, chemical, photographic, siderographic, and electro processes. Over the next two years Bradbury worked up a prospectus for a folio treatise on the graphic arts of the nineteenth century. Before this could be put into production, however, on 2 September 1860 Bradbury committed suicide in Cremorne Gardens by drinking soda water laced with prussic acid. Dickens speculated to W. H. Wills that the family's &#145;strong influence&#146; kept the story out of the papers; George Holsworth, employee of <span class="italic">All the Year Round</span>, believed Bradbury was depressed because one of Frederick Mullet Evans's daughters was marrying another, but Dickens doubted &#145;whether any blurred vision of that most undesirable female &hellip; ever crossed his drunken mind&#146;  (letter of 4 Sept 1860, <span class="italic">Letters of Charles Dickens</span>, 302&#150;3). The firm Bradbury founded had moved about 1859 to Farringdon Street, London, and continued under the name Bradbury, Wilkinson &amp; Co.<br>
