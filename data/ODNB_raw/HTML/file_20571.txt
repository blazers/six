<span class="headword">Offord,  John</span>  (<em>c.</em>1290&#150;1349), <span class="occ">diplomat and administrator</span>, was a brother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20570/', "Andrew Offord (b. c.1305, d. in or before 1358)")</script> and possibly a kinsman of the John Offord who died in 1375. Presumably born in Offord in Huntingdonshire, where in 1332 he was to have custody of lands pending the majority of the heir, he was a bachelor fellow of Merton College, Oxford, in 1313, and fellow in 1315. He had probably vacated his fellowship by 1322 by when he was MA. Subsequently he studied law, perhaps at Cambridge if, as seems likely, he is identifiable as the man recorded in the register of Bishop John Salmon of Norwich. He was BCL by 1327 and DCL by 1331.<br>
<br>Offord is termed king's clerk in 1328, but between 1332 and 1336 he appears intermittently as dean of the court of arches. In common with other well-qualified lawyers he soon found employment in diplomatic service. Appointed on 5 November 1334 to renew the truce with France, he continued to serve on various missions during 1337&#150;8, and in October 1338, following the breakdown of negotiations, he accompanied Edward III to the Low Countries. From there he was sent to the curia in Avignon, where he was resident proctor for a year from May 1339, and where with William Bateman, dean of Lincoln, and John Thoresby he presented the king's case against Archbishop John Stratford, using arguments anticipating those of the <i>libellus famosus</i> of the following year. He was also entrusted with securing dispensation for the marriage of Hugh Despenser, son of Edward II's favourite, with Elizabeth Montagu&#151;for the quieting of former quarrels between their families. In 1341 he was engaged in missions both to the French court and to Edward's allies or prospective allies, the dukes of Brabant and Gueldres, the marquess of Juliers, and the count of Hainault, while in 1342 he negotiated with the French ambassadors at Aunteyn near Tournai, and in April to May was appointed principal commissioner for negotiating a truce. He returned to France in June at the request of the papal envoy.<br>
<br>Between October 1342 and March 1343 Offord was with the king during the latter's indecisive intervention in Brittany and was involved in negotiating the truce of Malestroit (19 January 1343). At the Easter parliament of 1343 the king ordered the annulment of the articles of 1341 against Stratford, and directed Offord to bring the documents into the chamber for destruction. In August he and his brother Andrew were members of an embassy to Avignon. This was to negotiate a final peace with the French envoys, subject to the &#145;private arbitration&#146; of Pope Clement VI&#151;who hoped to unite the French and English in a crusade&#151;and to renew the long-standing request for a dispensation permitting marriage between the prince of Wales and Margaret, daughter of the duke of Brabant. At the beginning of October 1344 Offord's letters incorporating the pope's proposals were discussed at a secret royal council. In the event little was achieved. The claim of Edward III to the French throne doomed the peace negotiations from the start, the pope's reluctance blocked the dispensation, and the continental alliance against France rapidly disintegrated. Offord was the last of the disappointed English envoys to leave. Two years later he was engaged with William Edington and John Stratford in raising loans for Edward's expedition to the continent.<br>
<br>Although especially respected as a diplomat, Offord also held high office at home, acting as keeper of the privy seal from 4 June 1342 until after 29 September 1344. While with the king in Brittany during 1342&#150;3 he was entrusted with the great seal, which thus for the first time since 1340 returned to clerical hands. He was appointed chancellor on 26 October 1345, an office he held until his death in 1349, and with Edington, the treasurer, he shared responsibility for government during Edward's absence in France in 1346&#150;7. As might be anticipated, a man so constantly engaged in royal business benefited from royal patronage and papal provision. Offord's first benefice was Deepdale rectory in Norfolk, to which he was admitted as a &#145;clerk&#146; on 21 April 1316. In 1327 he was provided to a canonry of St Paul's with expectation of a prebend, and secured that of Totenhall by exchange in 1330, at which time he was also canon and prebendary of St Chad's, Shrewsbury. He was collated to a canonry of Lincoln with Liddington prebend in 1331, and the king granted him the long-disputed Leighton Buzzard prebend in 1342, though he failed to gain possession. He likewise failed to secure the archdeaconry of Chester in 1330, but was archdeacon of Ely between 1335 and 1344. Royal nomination to the deanery of York in 1343 proved unsuccessful owing to a papal provision, but in the following year he was himself provided to the deanery of Lincoln, notwithstanding his canonries and prebends of York, Lincoln, London, Wells, Salisbury, and Hereford. On the vacancy at Canterbury following John Stratford's death on 23 August 1348, the chapter of Christchurch elected Thomas Bradwardine, but Offord was provided to the see at the king's wish by bulls dated 24 September 1348&#151;four days before the election. The temporalities were restored on 14 December 1348 but before he could be consecrated he died, on 20 May 1349 at Tottenham, probably of the plague. The Rochester chronicler William Dene described him as being by then a weak and paralytic man, who had uselessly borrowed a great sum of money only to die and leave his creditors impoverished, and who was buried secretly in his cathedral church.<br>
