<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Murray,  Margaret Alice</span>  (1863&#150;1963), <span class="occ">Egyptologist and folklorist</span>, was born in Calcutta on 13 July 1863, the younger daughter of James Charles Murray (<i>d</i>. 1891) and his wife, Margaret Carr (<i>d</i>. 1913?). James Murray, whose family had been in India for several generations, was managing partner of a firm of Manchester merchants; his wife was from a Northumbrian family, and had gone to India as a missionary and social worker among Indian women. Margaret Murray's early life was spent partly in India and partly in England, with a period (1873&#150;5) in Bonn, Germany. She was educated mainly by her mother, but when she was in England without her parents she normally stayed with her uncle John Murray, vicar of Lambourn, Berkshire, and later rector of Rugby. From him she acquired an interest in ancient monuments. Nevertheless she first decided on a nursing career, and trained for three months&#151;the most her father would permit&#151;in Calcutta General Hospital in 1883 as the first &#145;lady probationer&#146; in India; she acted briefly as sister-in-charge during an epidemic. She returned to England in 1886 but had to give up her hopes of a nursing career because she was too small (only 4 feet 10 inches) to qualify. She next tried a career in social work, first in Rugby and then in Bushey Heath, Hertfordshire, where her parents settled in 1887, but found it uncongenial.<br>
<br>Murray's main career did not begin until her sister, Mary, who had been impressed by the work of the famous Egyptologist W. Flinders Petrie, prevailed on her to study under him. In January 1894 she entered his department at University College, London, where she made rapid progress under the tuition of J. H. Walker and F. Ll. Griffith. Petrie, recognizing her abilities, started her on research and encouraged her to publish the result, as &#145;The descent of property in the early periods of Egyptian history&#146; (<span class="italic">Proceedings of the Society of Biblical Archaeology</span>, 17 (1895), 240&#150;45). She remained Petrie's devoted disciple for the rest of her life; it was even rumoured that she had wanted to marry him.<br>
<br>In 1898, after Griffith's departure from London, Murray took over the teaching of the beginners' language classes. Despite her lack of formal qualifications she was appointed a junior college lecturer the following year, and was later promoted assistant (1909), lecturer (1921), senior lecturer and fellow (1922), and assistant professor (1924); in 1931 she gained the degree of DLitt. After Walker's death in 1914 she effectively ran the Egyptology department, since Petrie was absent for much of the year on excavations, and she was largely responsible for organizing the teaching into a formal training course (1910) leading to a certificate in Egyptian archaeology. This involved her in a wide range of subjects: besides Egyptian language, history, art, and religion, there were drawing, photography, surveying, mineralogy, and dating of objects, as well as anthropology and ethnology. Her salary was not high, and in order to bring her income up to &pound;200 per annum she undertook much outside teaching, mostly evening classes but also extension lectures at Oxford (1910) and London (1911), and proved a conscientious cataloguer, first of the Egyptian collection of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland, to which she belonged from 1900, and later of the Egyptian antiquities in the National Museum of Ireland, the Royal Scottish Museum, Manchester University Museum, and the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford.<br>
<br>Murray's first experience of fieldwork came when she assisted Petrie in his excavations at Abydos in 1902&#150;3 and she also worked in Saqqara in 1903&#150;4, but later her teaching duties prevented her from digging except in the summer, when work in Egypt is virtually impossible; but she took such opportunities as were available, excavating in Malta (1920&#150;23) and Minorca (1930&#150;31). After she retired from University College in 1935&#151;the normal retirement rules having been suspended for seven years, for she was then seventy-two&#151;she went on a lecture tour of Norway, Sweden, Finland, and Estonia. She then spent time with Petrie in Palestine (where he had retired in 1933); she was involved especially in his work at Petra (1937) and Tell Ajjul (Gaza; 1938).<br>
<br>Murray was highly industrious, and published more than a hundred books and articles (see her bibliography in <span class="italic">Folklore</span>, 72, 1961, 560&#150;66), including several valuable excavation reports, such as <span class="italic">The Osireion at Abydos</span> (1904), <span class="italic">Saqqara mastabas</span> (2 vols., 1905&#150;37; perhaps her best work), and <span class="italic">Seven Memphite Tomb Chapels</span> (1952, with Hilda Flinders Petrie). Of the works she intended for a wider audience, such as <span class="italic">Egyptian Temples</span> (1931), the best-known is <span class="italic">The Splendour that was Egypt</span> (1949), unfortunately not one of her best, since it was marred by her uncritical acceptance of Petrie's superseded chronology and of the theory that inheritance in Egypt was matrilineal and led to frequent sibling marriages. In general her scholarship showed breadth of interest rather than profundity; she was not an expert philologist, and was occasionally guilty of making unsubstantiated statements. Perhaps the main criticism that might be levelled is that she tended to take a myopic view of Egyptian civilization; lack of perspective is particularly evident in her failure to appreciate the important outside influences which were manifest in the Proto-Dynastic period. Nevertheless, her knowledge of the language was of the greatest help to Petrie. At heart she was a true archaeologist who enjoyed concentrating on the material remains. Her main legacy to the study of the ancient world was probably her fieldwork, together with her influence on the large number of Egyptologists who were her pupils.<br>
<br>Murray was remembered as a forceful character, with bright blue eyes that could flash in indignation; her strength of character was shown in her success in the hitherto entirely male world of professional Egyptologists. Like her mother, she was determined to do whatever she could to improve the conditions of women. This had been her motive for attempting a career in social work, and was shown in her time at University College by her undemonstrative but unfailing support for her female colleagues and pupils. Furthermore she ventured into territory not then considered suitable for women by her involvement in anthropology. This began as part of her Egyptology, but became a second academic legacy after, in two ground-breaking books, <span class="italic">The Witch-Cult in Western Europe</span> (1921) and <span class="italic">The God of the Witches</span> (1933; 2nd edn, 1952), she explained medieval European witchcraft as a survival of the pre-Christian nature cult of the horned god (Cernunnos). This theory was controversial but proved popular and widely influential. She became a recognized authority on the subject, a fellow of the Royal Anthropological Institute from 1926 and a member of the Folk-Lore Society from 1927 (its president for 1953&#150;5). However, her later, characteristically independent-minded, &#145;attempt to attribute the death of certain English monarchs to the survival of the killing of the divine king in a Frazerian context&#146;&#151;in <span class="italic">The Divine King in England</span> (1954)&#151;&#145;can hardly be regarded as among her more convincing anthropological contributions&#146;  (<span class="italic">Folklore</span>, 74, 1963, 569). Another idiosyncrasy was her occasional practice of the arts she studied; more than once she was reported by friends to have cast spells in a saucepan to try to reverse academic appointments of which she disapproved  (Janssen, 56). Such activities may not have been entirely serious, for she was practical and quite unsuperstitious, and her sense of humour was well developed, as is shown by her remark to Leonard Cottrell in a BBC broadcast she made at the age of ninety-six: &#145;I've been an archaeologist most of my life and now I'm a piece of archaeology myself&#146;  (<span class="italic">Folklore</span>, 72, 1961, 437).<br>
<br>Murray remained relatively active in her old age and in her hundredth year published not only her last academic work, <span class="italic">The Genesis of Religion</span> (1963), but also her fascinating autobiography, <span class="italic">My First Hundred Years</span>. Two days after her hundredth birthday she was still able to attend a celebration held in her honour by University College, but she died a few months later, on 13 November 1963, at the Queen Victoria Memorial Hospital, Welwyn, Hertfordshire. She never married. Her funeral was held and her body cremated on 20 November at Golders Green crematorium, Middlesex.<br>
