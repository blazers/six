<span class="headword">Sheepshanks,  Mary Ryott</span>  (1872&#150;1960), <span class="occ">educationist, feminist, and internationalist</span>, was born on 25 October 1872 at Bilton vicarage, near Harrogate, Yorkshire, the second of the thirteen surviving children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/100457/', "John Sheepshanks (1834&#150;1912)")</script>, later bishop of Norwich, and his wife, Margaret Ryott (1852&#150;1943), a descendant of Oliver Cromwell. Mary Sheepshanks experienced her childhood home in Anfield vicarage, Liverpool, as austere and joyless&#151;she felt isolated and uncherished, causing her lifelong opposition to large families and total alienation from religion. The educational and other privileges granted her seven brothers fed into her feminism. At fourteen Mary was permitted to attend one of the first Girls' Public Day School Company high schools&#151;Liverpool High School for Girls (later the Belvedere School)&#151;where she distinguished herself in modern languages and literature. Her brilliant young teacher Lucy Silcox, later headmistress of St Felix School, Southwold, &#145;gave and inspired love&#146;  (Sheepshanks). Mary Sheepshanks read medieval and modern languages at Newnham College, Cambridge, discovering too late that her real bent was for moral sciences, psychology, and economics. While at Cambridge (1891&#150;5) she began her commitment to social intervention, teaching adult literacy classes in the town. In October 1895, having been cut off by her family for her &#145;advanced views&#146;, Mary joined the Women's University Settlement, later the Blackfriars Settlement, in Southwark, the worst poverty blackspot in London. There, and later in Stepney, she became a pioneer social worker.<br>
<br>In 1897 Mary was appointed vice-principal&#151;but <i>de facto</i> principal&#151;of Morley College for Working Men and Women, becoming also a pioneer woman educational administrator. &#145;She possessed exceptional breadth of culture and determination of character&#146;  (Richards, 142). Mary Sheepshanks expressed her feminism at Morley by giving support to the tired working-class women students there, perceiving that they lacked the intellectual and social confidence of the men. She encouraged women's gymnastics, women's cycling, and debating clubs, enlisting Virginia Woolf (then Virginia Stephen) to teach history evening classes, and she also set up single inspirational lectures on Charlotte Bront&euml;, the Women's Co-operative Guild, and heroines.<br>
<br>Mary Sheepshanks's (leased) home during 1899&#150;1919 was 1 Barton Street, Westminster, which she shared with a succession of women friends, including the Quakers Dr Hilda Clark and Alice Clark, Catherine Marshall, and Irene Cooper, all suffragists. She herself became a prominent suffragist speaker 1908&#150;13 and invited Christabel Pankhurst and Amber Reeves to speak at Morley. Mary Sheepshanks's attitude to the suffragettes was ambivalent&#151;alienated by their violence, yet greatly admiring of their courage. In 1913 she was invited to go on a suffrage lecture tour that included visits to Brussels, Paris, Vienna, Munich, Berlin, Prague, Cracow, Warsaw, and Budapest, speaking in French or German on women and local government, industry, temperance, and education. Her letters to Bertrand Russell concerning the women's movement in Europe at this time are most illuminating  (see Oldfield, 154&#150;9). In June 1913 Jane Addams urged her to become secretary of the International Women's Suffrage Alliance and editor of its monthly paper, <span class="italic">Ius Suffragii</span>. Mary Sheepshanks's feminism was inspired both by outrage at the brutal injustice suffered by women and by faith that emancipated, enfranchised women could help to humanize the world.<br>
<br>When Europe descended into its competition in inhumanity in 1914, Mary helped draft an international manifesto of women protesting against the imminent catastrophe. In October 1914 her signed editorial in <span class="italic">Ius Suffragii</span>, &#145;Patriotism or internationalism&#146;, prophesied: &#145;[The] world is relapsing into a worse, because a more scientific, barbarism than that from which it sprang&#146;  (<span class="italic">Ius Suffragii</span>, 9, 1914, 184), and in November 1914 she already looked ahead to what must be done after the war: &#145;Armaments must be drastically reduced and abolished, and their place taken by an international police force. &hellip; Peace must be on generous, unvindictive lines, &hellip; only so can it be permanent.&#146; Simultaneously she was organizing refugee relief on a massive scale, agitating for the admission of hundreds of thousands of Belgians into Britain &#145;for the duration&#146;, while also arranging relief and travel permits for &#145;enemy&#146; German women stranded in Britain. She continued throughout the war to bring out the international and internationalist <span class="italic">Ius Suffragii</span>, obtaining and disseminating humanist feminist news across enemy frontiers via neutrals. In April 1915 Mary Sheepshanks was one of the pacifist suffragists who broke with Mrs Fawcett by supporting the Women's International Congress at The Hague, which founded the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom.<br>
<br>At the end of the First World War, Mary, now based in Hampstead, was appointed secretary of the Fight the Famine Council, recently founded by Gilbert Murray, R. H. Tawney, Leonard Woolf, Maynard Keynes, Olive Schreiner, and others to educate public opinion concerning the need for a new, just economic order in Europe and to relieve the hunger consequent upon the allied blockade (one off-shoot of the council was to be the Save the Children Fund). In 1920 Mary, as representative of the council, lobbied the League of Nations unsuccessfully for the immediate admission of Germany and the revision of the punitive reparations clauses of the treaty of Versailles. In 1923 she spoke on international conciliation in Berlin, Einstein calling her speech &#145;masterly&#146;; in Munich she needed socialist bodyguards at her speaking engagements because of Hitler's Bierkeller toughs. In 1927 Mary became international secretary of the Women's International League (WIL), based in Geneva, editing its monthly paper <span class="italic">Pax International</span>. In September 1928 she headed another unsuccessful deputation to the League of Nations to present an urgent memorandum calling for a world disarmament conference. In 1929 she organized the first scientific conference on modern methods of warfare and the civilian population in Frankfurt, and in 1930 the first Conference on Statelessness in Europe (held in Geneva). Feeling increasingly isolated on the WIL international executive among its French or German &#145;left-extremists&#146;, however, she resigned in 1931. She then went on an undercover fact-finding mission to the Ukrainians of Galicia, whose brutal oppression by the Polish regime of Marshal Pilsudski she proceeded to publicize. Twenty years later, she was told that there were 300,000 Ukranian migrants now settled in Canada who loved her.<br>
<br>During the late 1930s Mary Sheepshanks gave shelter in her own home to a succession of Trotskyist exiles, to Sudetenland socialists, and, increasingly, to German and Austrian Jews. Finally, in 1939, she had to renounce her lifelong pacifism and back the war against Nazi Germany. In 1945, however, she was deeply opposed to the dropping of the atom bomb. On 21 January 1960, confined by arthritis to a chair and faced with compulsory institutionalization, she took her own life, dying at her home, 15 Thurlow Road, Hampstead, London.<br>
<br>Mary Sheepshanks was a tall, upright woman with bespectacled, brilliantly blue eyes and a brusque manner. Incomparably articulate, her exceptional intellectual competence masked deep personal insecurity; she found it difficult to believe she was liked. But the many colleagues who crossed swords with her never doubted her prescience, her altruism, or her integrity.<br>
