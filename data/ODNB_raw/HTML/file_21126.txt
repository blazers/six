<span class="headword">Pagit,  Eusebius</span>  (1546/7&#150;1617), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, was born at Cranford, Northamptonshire, the third son of Richard Pagit, gentleman, and his wife, Katherine, daughter of Euseby Isham of Pitchley, Northamptonshire. In 1559, at the age of twelve Pagit was admitted to Christ Church, Oxford, as a chorister. According to his son, he injured his right arm while carrying the pax in a religious service, an accident that may have prompted him to question aspects of the traditional ceremony. The arm failed to heal properly, and he later subscribed documents as &#145;lame Eusebius Pagit&#146;. Admitted to Christ's College, Cambridge, on 22 February 1564, Pagit graduated BA in early 1568, having earned repute as &#145;the golden sophister&#146;. He was ordained deacon in London in June 1569, aged twenty-two, and priest three months later. In either 1569 or 1570 he became rector of Old, Northamptonshire, where his uncle, John Isham, was patron. At Old, Pagit became a popular preacher of funeral sermons. For refusing to subscribe the articles, he was suspended in 1571. He became rector of nearby Lamport, which was also in John Isham's patronage, on 21 April 1572. On 12 June of that year, in a sermon preached less than a mile from Greenwich Palace, he likened the English bishops to Pharisees and to Catholic abbots and cardinals. Edmund Scambler, bishop of Peterborough, suspended Pagit on 29 January 1574 for nonconformity, depriving him of Lamport three weeks later. However, Pagit was appointed rector of Barnwell St Andrew, also in Northamptonshire, on 19 June 1575. By the following year he and John Oxenbridge were serving as moderators of the prophesyings at Southam, Warwickshire. With the support of such gentry as Sir Richard Knightley and, probably, Anthony Cope of Hanwell, he travelled throughout the midlands, visiting exercises, organizing classes (clerical conferences), and acting as what John Aylmer, later to be bishop of London, called a &#145;posting apostle&#146;. For these activities Pagit and Oxenbridge were arrested and taken to London. Although no record of his fate at the hands of the ecclesiastical commission survives, his deprivation must be assumed.<br>
<br>Pagit found refuge with his uncle, John Isham, in whose Northamptonshire household he used a catechism, published in 1579 as <span class="italic">Short Questions and Answeares</span>, intended to benefit both householders and outsiders in worship and instruction. Appearing in thirty-one known editions by 1641, it contained brief answers averaging just over twenty words apiece. Pagit and Robert Openshaw later revised it, doubling the number of questions and halving the length of answers (other than biblical quotations). A Latin version appeared in 1585. Every day for twenty-six years, Pagit had a question-and-answer session on the <span class="roman">Bible</span> in his household, reading an <span class="roman">Old Testament</span> chapter at dinner and a <span class="roman">New Testament</span> one at supper.<br>
<br>Although Pagit refused to conform, John Woolton, bishop of Exeter, instituted him as rector of Kilkhampton, Cornwall, in 1580. The living, which was in Sir Richard Grenville's gift, had been obtained with the help of Sir Francis Hastings of Leicestershire. During Pagit's tenure he published two of his sermons, <span class="italic">A Verie Fruitful Sermon</span> (1583) on predestination, and <span class="italic">A Godlie and Fruitefull Sermon</span> (1583) on <span class="roman">Genesis</span> 14: 20&#150;21, in which he defended tithing, outlined acceptable social behaviour, and criticized bishops who granted leases of benefices to relatives. In March 1584 Woolton insisted that Pagit conform, but he refused to do so. Later that year, the curate of Barnstaple, Devon, brought charges against Pagit before the high commission. He was cited before the court on 11 January 1585 for declining to observe all the provisions of the <span class="roman">Book of Common Prayer</span>. He denied the charge, admitting only that he had varied from some of its provisions. Such practice, he argued, was followed by Archbishop Whitgift, Woolton, and other clergy. Although the commissioners suspended him, he continued to preach, possibly having received a royal pardon, but was eventually deprived for refusing to wear the surplice, use the sign of the cross when baptizing, and read the prayers in full. Grenville took possession of the parsonage, prompting allegations that he had terrorized Pagit's wife and committed unlawful violence. Pagit in turn charged Woolton with failing to undertake diocesan visitations, not attending sermons, and refusing to punish two members of his household who had impregnated harlots.<br>
<br>With the Scot David Black, Pagit established a &#145;reformed College&#146; at Kilkhampton, but this, too, he was forced to relinquish for refusing to subscribe the articles. He subsequently taught for a time at Heston, Middlesex, and then at Deptford, Kent. A homily preached at Deptford was published in 1586 under the title <span class="italic">A Godly Sermon</span>. Wrongly suspected of having written the Marprelate tracts, Pagit was cruelly satirized by the anonymous author of <span class="italic">The Returne of the Renowned Cavaliero Pasquill</span> (1589) as a man with two clubs, &#145;one in his foote, another in his head&#146;, and by the author of <span class="italic">An Almond for a Parrat</span> (1590) as a schismatic, whoremaster, and &#145;poltfoote Paget&#146;  (Carlson, 66&#150;7, 70).<br>
<br>Weary of being harried for his beliefs, Pagit wrote to the lord admiral, Charles, Lord Howard of Effingham, on 3 June 1591, after Sir John Hawkins had approached Howard on his behalf. For twenty years, Pagit averred, separatists had urged him to join them, and in the past six months he had devoted considerable time to conferences with them, and with learned men opposed to them. Professing loyalty to the established church notwithstanding its blemishes, he insisted that the essence of a true church was gospel preaching. Calling attention to his children and orphans entrusted to his care, he appealed not to be evicted from his house and forced to beg. He appears to have continued to live and to teach at Deptford until 1598, when he was appointed lecturer at St Botolph, Aldgate, in London, succeeding William Hubbock, who obtained the post for him. For failing to obtain a proper licence he was temporarily suspended, but by 1599 he was attracting so many people from neighbouring parishes to his lectures that the vestry complained. He explored biblical passages in depth, lecturing on <span class="roman">John</span> 19: 1&#150;33 from 17 June to 30 September 1599. In 1603 he published another best-seller, <span class="italic">The History of the Bible</span>, which used the question-and-answer format. Having now made his peace with the ecclesiastical authorities, Pagit left his lectureship to become rector of St Anne and St Agnes, Aldersgate, on 21 September 1604, a position he held until his death in May or June 1617. He was interred in his church. His son, the heresiographer <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21125/', "Ephraim Pagett")</script>, was granted letters of administration for his estate on 16 June that year.<br>
