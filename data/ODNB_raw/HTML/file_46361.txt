<span class="headword">Newlands,  James</span>  (1813&#150;1871), <span class="occ">architect and civil engineer</span>, was born in Edinburgh on 28 July 1813, the son of Thomas Newlands, a rope maker, and his wife, Janet, <i>n&eacute;e</i> MacKay. He was educated at the Edinburgh high school and at Edinburgh University where he was a student of John Leslie and excelled in mathematics and natural philosophy. In 1827 he began working in the office of Thomas Brown, architect to Edinburgh corporation, and became a skilled draughtsman. From 1833 to 1836 he assisted David Low, professor of agriculture at Edinburgh, on a large work on agriculture concerned with the laying out of farms and the design of farm buildings (probably his work <span class="italic">On Landed Estates</span>, 1844). About 1838 Newlands also began to study chemistry, another of Low's interests. For most of the next decade Newlands was in private practice as an architect and surveyor. He is said to have designed the manses for several Scottish churches, and to have been valuing agricultural land in connection with railway bills. He had also by this time become an accomplished painter, exhibiting at the Royal Scottish Academy, and was a skilled flautist. On 11 August 1845 he married Joanna Handerson at St Cuthbert's Church, Edinburgh; she died in 1848.<br>
<br>On 26 January 1847 Newlands was appointed, from among five candidates, engineer to Liverpool corporation at a salary of &pound;700 (ultimately raised to &pound;1300). This was a new post established by the 1846 <span class="roman">Liverpool Sanitary Act</span>, which also established the first medical officership of health, held by Dr William Henry Duncan. While some large towns, including Liverpool, employed surveyors to look after town buildings, and while some metropolitan sewers commissions employed sanitary engineers, the Liverpool post was the first for a municipal engineer who would be concerned with comprehensively improving the health, amenity, and efficiency of the city.<br>
<br>During his first year in office Newlands carried out a detailed survey of the city on a scale of 1 inch to 20 feet. His first report of April 1848 included plans for a complete system of sewers, but addressed much else as well. It has been rightly said that it &#145;elucidates with clearness and precision almost every matter connected with the sanitary arrangements of a great population&#146;  (<span class="italic">PICE</span>, 229). Indeed, in many ways it presaged the structural changes that characterize Haussmann's Paris. Much concerned with access of light and air, Newlands proposed regulations on building height, street width, and room size. He proposed a series of boulevards along the parliamentary boundary, and to rebuild courtyard housing to allow communal cooking, baking, and washing. Newlands's sewer scheme was adopted, and while most of his other suggestions were deemed too radical to be adopted in full, he was successful in leading Liverpool to undertake responsibility for municipal services in many areas. Newlands's report pioneered both the regulation of housing and the provision of new public housing, as well as the provision of baths, wash-houses, and swimming baths. Supplementary reports appeared every few years reviewing the sanitary progress of the city and identifying new needs.<br>
<br>While in many ways Newlands's efforts paralleled those of Edwin Chadwick, who was attempting to establish state responsibility for sanitary reform, the two were not close. Newlands's survey, carried out by private practice surveyors, undermined Chadwick's claim that a corps of military engineers should do such work; Newlands's successful working relationship with Liverpool council seemed to indicate that successful sanitation was not necessarily predicated on the existence of a general board of health.<br>
<br>In 1855 Newlands took leave from his post to advise on the sanitation of army camps in the Crimea. In 1860 he published <span class="italic">The Carpenter and Joiner's Assistant</span>, a treatise that went through five editions during his life and was republished in 1890. He was elected associate member of the Institution of Civil Engineers in 1848, and to full membership in 1857.<br>
<br>The first municipal engineer, Newlands was also for more than twenty years an exemplar of the profession which was only beginning to take formal shape at the end of his life. He quietly managed to begin the transformation of many aspects of the urban landscape by introducing a concept of urban planning, all the while maintaining popularity with all segments of the community in a city where there were deep political divisions. By the late 1860s he was being treated for the effects of chronic bronchitis and exhaustion through overwork. Rest cures did not help. In early June 1871 he moved to a role as consulting engineer, and died six weeks later, on 15 July. Crowds lined the route of his funeral procession. He was buried in the Liverpool necropolis.<br>
