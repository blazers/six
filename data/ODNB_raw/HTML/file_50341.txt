<span class="headword">Lewes,  Robert  of</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1166), <span class="occ">bishop of Bath</span>, was of Flemish descent, though born in England apparently of noble parents. He had been a monk of the Cluniac priory of Lewes when he attracted the attention of Henry de Blois (<i>d</i>. 1171), who was to be his patron for the rest of his life. Of his pre-episcopal career little is known. Contemporaries comment that Henry de Blois secured for him first an administrative post at Glastonbury and then, at Easter 1136, promotion to the bishopric of Bath. It is possible that Robert had spent a brief period as prior of Winchester, but the evidence for this rests entirely on the appearance of a Robert, prior of Winchester, in the 1130 pipe roll and the comment of a fifteenth-century Wells historian.<br>
<br>Within his diocese, Bishop Robert's importance lies in his organizational work and above all in his establishment at Wells of a secular chapter. His period in office saw the appearance of three territorial archdeaconries, and it is evident from the frequency with which the archdeacons witnessed the bishop's charters that they were his closest companions and assistants. Of the six men who served in this capacity, three at some point used the title <i>magister</i>, revealing a new necessity for and emphasis on administrative competence. The greatly increased number of surviving <i>acta</i> from Robert's episcopate, as compared with those of his immediate predecessors, and the appearance for the first time in the diocese of an episcopal seal, similarly suggest a more bureaucratic approach towards his diocesan duties.<br>
<br>Closely related to this was Bishop Robert's work of rebuilding and reorganization at Wells, which enabled him to provide canonries for his clerical staff. Following the moving of the bishop's see to Bath under John of Tours (<i>d</i>. 1122), the canons of Wells had suffered the alienation of much of their revenue. In a document drawn up under the guidance of Henry de Blois, and almost certainly issued at Stephen's Easter court in 1136 (the occasion on which Robert was confirmed in the temporalities of his see), the bishop reorganized their existing estates and himself gave a number more. These were divided into prebends to endow a dean, precentor, subdean, and, initially, fifteen canons. A common fund was established to provide bread for those clergy attending the early morning office, and revenue was also set aside to maintain the fabric and ornaments of the church of Wells. The partially rebuilt church was dedicated within the period 1142&#150;8.<br>
<br>As a Cluniac monk, Robert of Lewes's dealings with the religious houses of his diocese are clearly of some interest. He appears to have had entirely cordial relations with the cathedral priory at Bath, where he continued the rebuilding of the church begun by his predecessor, John of Tours, and gave generous gifts but nevertheless did not fully restore the priory's alienated properties. He showed no especial favour towards Montacute Priory, the one Cluniac house in the diocese, but does seem to have been keen to promote the Augustinian cause (as was Henry de Blois in the diocese of Winchester). Among his surviving <i>acta</i> the largest single beneficiary is the Augustinian house at Bruton. Robert was also involved with the economic development of the town of Wells, granting it borough status and conferring privileges on traders visiting for three annual fairs.<br>
<br>Beginning in 1962 R. H. C. Davis made a good case for Bishop Robert as the author of the <span class="italic">Gesta Stephani</span>. The issue is not one on which certainty is possible, but if the identification is correct, it shows the bishop to have been a scholar of some stature, adept at employing both biblical and, as one might expect of a Cluniac, classical idioms. Pastoral concerns are apparent in the humanity with which the suffering inflicted by the civil war is treated. The work also reveals a very high conception of the episcopal office, appropriate for one who was both a prot&eacute;g&eacute; of Henry de Blois and a supporter of priests, regular and secular, within his diocese. In political terms the author can be seen initially to have been an enthusiastic partisan of Stephen's, though subsequently a supporter of Duke Henry. From other sources the bishop is known to have been with the king at the siege of Bedford in 1138, present with his patron at the reception of the empress in Winchester in March 1141, and witness to a deed of Duke Henry's in April 1153. An elderly man when Stephen's reign ended in 1154, Bishop Robert was recorded as being ill in May 1163, and he died on 31 August 1166. He was buried before the high altar at Bath.<br>
