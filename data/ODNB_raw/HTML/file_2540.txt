<span class="headword">Blackwell <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Blachrie]</span>,  Elizabeth</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1707, <em>d.</em> 1758), <span class="occ">botanical author and artist</span>, was baptized on 22 June 1707 at St Nicholas, Aberdeen, the sixth daughter of a prosperous stocking merchant, William Blachrie (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1669) and his wife, Isobel Fordyce. Elizabeth married her second cousin <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2539/', "Alexander Blackwell (bap. 1709, d. 1747)")</script>, reportedly eloping to London about 1728. Elizabeth's dowry enabled her husband to establish a printing business at the Atlas, opposite Catherine Street in the Strand, about 1730, but the business foundered and Alexander was incarcerated in the debtors' prison by 1734. Elizabeth decided to extricate her husband from his financial difficulties by applying her artistic talents to drawing and painting lifelike reproductions of medicinal plants. Encouragement came from Sir Hans Sloane, Richard Mead, and apothecary Isaac Rand, director of the botanical garden at Chelsea. Elizabeth took lodgings at 4 Swan Walk in Chelsea, close to the garden where she would find the living models for her botanical drawings. She was assisted in her task by Philip Miller, head of the garden's staff.<br>
<br>Elizabeth Blackwell's <span class="italic">A curious herbal: containing five hundred cuts, of the most useful plants, which are now used in the practice of physick</span> has been described as &#145;among the earliest publications on botany by a woman ... links an older female tradition of herbal work with an emergent female tradition of botanical illustration&#146;  (Shteir, 40). Before her work on the <span class="italic">Curious Herbal</span> was completed, Elizabeth's son, William, died, and was buried at Chelsea on 3 May 1736. After finishing the drawings Elizabeth engraved them on copper herself, and coloured the 500 prints individually by hand. Alexander assisted with textual translation. Initially published in weekly parts, the first volume, which contained commendations from the Royal College of Physicians, was completed in 1737, the second in 1738 or early 1739. Among those to whom the volumes were dedicated was Elizabeth's uncle by marriage, John Johnstoun, professor of medicine at the University of Glasgow, as well as Richard Mead, Isaac Rand, and other luminaries of the medical profession. The book enjoyed considerable success in the eighteenth century, selling for about &pound;5 for both volumes. A woman of many talents, Elizabeth was personally involved in the accounting and bookkeeping tasks associated with the marketing of her publication, which successfully rescued the family from debt. Although Blackwell's original edition has been seen by some as inferior to the augmented German version published in Nuremburg by J. Trew between 1757 and 1773, it remains aesthetically superior. The text is delicately engraved in her elegant hand (as opposed to the heavy print of the German text) and boasts a more sensible arrangement, with drawings closely integrated with the relevant text. Blackwell's format, as well as the English text, invited lay readership. Elizabeth remained in England when her husband travelled to Sweden in 1742, the year she bore her second son, Alexander, who was baptized at St Paul's, Covent Garden, Westminster, on 7 September 1742. Widowed in 1747 by the execution in Sweden of her husband, after he had become involved in a political intrigue, Elizabeth lived until October 1758. She was buried in the churchyard at Chelsea Old Church.<br>
