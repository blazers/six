<span class="headword">Raymond,  Robert</span>, first Baron Raymond  (1673&#150;1733), <span class="occ">judge</span>, was born on 20 December 1673 in London, the only son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/23208/', "Sir Thomas Raymond (1626/7&#150;1683)")</script>, judge, and his wife, Anne (1633&#150;1715), daughter of Sir Edward Fishe, baronet, of Southill, Bedfordshire. At his father's request he was formally admitted to Gray's Inn at the age of nine, in 1682; he subsequently attended school at Eton College and became a pensioner of Christ's College, Cambridge, in 1689. Despite the early start to his legal career he was not called to the bar until November 1697, and his early entry into business suggests the fruits of sustained and conscientious study. Indeed, his common-law reports begin in 1694, and in Michaelmas 1698 he reported his own argument for the defendant in <i>Pullein v. Benson</i> (1698), an action of debt on a bond. The extent of his early success is evidenced by his retention as junior counsel for the crown in the 1702 trial of Richard Hathaway, a Southwark blacksmith's apprentice who had been exposed for a malicious prosecution of witchcraft. In April 1704 he appeared for the defence in the trial for high treason of the Scot David Lindsay, who was indicted under a statute enacted after the treaty of Ryswick which was designed to minimize the threat of Jacobites returning from France. Although Lindsay was convicted, Raymond made an ambitious and learned argument to the effect that <i>pace</i> <i>Calvin's case</i>  (<span class="italic">State trials</span>, 14.1007&#150;15) as a Scot he was not within the scope of an act passed by the English parliament which referred to English subjects. Two years later he opened for the prosecution in the trial of Robert (Beau) Fielding, who was indicted for bigamy, having married the notorious Barbara Villiers, duchess of Cleveland, while his first wife was still alive.<br>
<br>Raymond's standing as a rising barrister was confirmed by his appearance in 1709 before the House of Lords against the Naturalization Bill, on behalf of the City of London, but there is little evidence of any early political commitment on his part. Certainly in December of the same year he was retained as one of the counsel for the defence of Dr Henry Sacheverell, but in the event he was not prepared to countenance Sacheverell's provocative high toryism, and in January 1710 he and Serjeant John Pratt returned their fees after reading their client's intemperate &#145;Answer&#146; to the articles of impeachment. Nevertheless, on 13 May he was named solicitor-general in succession to Robert Eyre, and at the October general election he was brought into parliament for Bishop's Castle in Shropshire on the nomination of Robert Harley. Raymond was subsequently knighted and voted with the tory administration during the last years of Queen Anne, being returned again for Bishop's Castle by Harley in 1713; but although he was not especially active in parliament, at the accession of George I he was replaced as solicitor-general on the recommendation of Lord Cowper.<br>
<br>After the 1715 election, having been elected on the tory interest for Yarmouth in the Isle of Wight, Raymond spoke on behalf of the tory opposition and defended his former patron Oxford against the charge of treason brought against him under articles of impeachment. Although he was unseated by petition on 12 April 1717, the delivery of a major speech against the <span class="roman">Septennial Bill</span> in 1716 suggests Raymond had established his parliamentary voice. He was sufficiently important to attract an offer of a seat from the whig government, and pliable enough to accept, returning to the Commons as MP for Ludlow in 1719, and being elected for Helston at the general election of 1722. Indeed, Raymond was one of the leading barristers in chancery and the House of Lords during 1720, and became attorney-general on 9 May 1720. In that capacity he conducted the proceedings arising out of the Atterbury plot, including the prosecution of Christopher Layer in king's bench at the end of 1722, but in parliament his previous tory affiliation was an embarrassment when it came to promoting the bill of pains and penalties against his former ally Atterbury, and he retired to a puisne judgeship in king's bench at the beginning of January 1724.<br>
<br>Despite his former toryism and limited parliamentary usefulness, Raymond clearly enjoyed the confidence of the Walpolian regime. In 1725 he was named one of the lords commissioners who had custody of the great seal for six months between the resignation of Lord Chancellor Macclesfield and the appointment of Lord Chancellor King, and on the death of Sir John Pratt he was advanced to be lord chief justice of king's bench (2 March 1725). He presided there for eight years, and evidently gave satisfaction, being reappointed on the accession of George II and raised to the peerage in 1731 as first Baron Raymond of Abbots Langley, Hertfordshire. As lord chief justice he is remembered for elaborate and very learned judgments which applied the common law carefully and conservatively. Certainly he helped to develop the law's distinction between murder and manslaughter. In 1727, giving judgment on a special verdict found against Major John Oneby for killing a man after a gambling argument, Raymond determined that an &#145;act of deliberation&#146; on the part of the protagonist which occurred after the first quarrel showed that he was not deprived of his reason and therefore was guilty of murder. And two years later in <i>R. v. John Huggins</i>  (<span class="italic">State trials</span>, 17.370&#150;82), which arose out of the parliamentary inquiry into the condition of the prisons (Huggins was warden of the Fleet prison), he held that an officer could not be held criminally responsible for the acts of his deputy in the absence of his express consent, and Huggins was therefore not guilty of murdering an inmate who had died after ill treatment. He also had some impact on the law of libel, establishing the principle in <i>R. v. Curl</i> (1728) that publication of an obscene book is punishable as a libel at common law, if it &#145;tends to disturb the civil order of society&#146;, and temporarily shoring up the orthodox defences of government against criticism of the press in the important case of <i>R. v. Francklin</i> (1728), where the publisher of <span class="italic">The Craftsman</span> was indicted for criticizing the ministry's foreign policy. On this occasion Raymond reaffirmed the seventeenth-century principle that the jury were judges only of the defendant's responsibility for the publication and of its application to the king's ministers, and it was an issue of law for the court to determine whether the words were libellous. He also insisted that in seditious libel the truth of the matter alleged was no defence: &#145;it is not material whether the facts charged in a libel be true or false, if the prosecution is by indictment or information&#146;  (<span class="italic">State trials</span>, 17.658&#150;9). This was the position later followed by Lord Mansfield.<br>
<br>Raymond was manifestly dedicated to the common law: near the end of his life he spoke in the Lords against the bill for recording legal proceedings in English; he also told his fellow peers that as a judge he would commit any one of them who claimed privileged immunity from giving evidence on oath. His reports continued to within a year of his death. He had married Anne (<i>d</i>. 1721), daughter of his colleague Sir Edward Northey, attorney-general when he was solicitor-general, and when he died at his London home at Red Lion Square on 18 March 1733 he left his estate of Langley Bury, at Abbots Langley in Hertfordshire, to their only son, Robert. He was buried at Abbots Langley church. His reports were published in 1743 and reached a fifth edition in 1832.<br>
