<span class="headword">Fraser <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Day; <em>married name </em>Foss]</span>,  Winifred</span>  (1868&#150;1951), <span class="occ">actress</span>, was born Agnes Catherine Mary Day at 59 City Road, London, on 29 February 1868 (though in theatrical directories she gave her birth date as February 1872). She was the only daughter (she had a younger brother) of Edward Day (1825&#150;1870), who descended from an Irish gentry family, vicar of St Mark's, Old Street, Shoreditch, and his wife, Catherine Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Pope. After her father's sudden death, her mother supported the family by teaching. Her mother married, in 1873, Edward Roger Cooper Hays, a schoolmaster, and settled in the Hampstead area, but they divorced in 1882. She was educated in Hampstead and made her professional acting d&eacute;but in 1888 as Sophia in an adaptation of Oliver Goldsmith's <span class="italic">The Vicar of Wakefield</span> alongside William Farren junior. Early in her career she adopted the stage name Winifred Fraser. After a period of touring, first in the classical repertory, in the company managed by Ben Greet, and later in more modern works, including <span class="italic">Jim the Penman</span>, by Sir Charles Young, and <span class="italic">The New Magdalen</span>, by Wilkie Collins, she made her first appearance in the West End in November 1889, as Alice Fairfax in <span class="italic">Her Own Witness</span>. She then played several small roles in major London productions, including Rosie in Lady Bancroft's <span class="italic">My Daughter</span> and Lucy in the same author's <span class="italic">A Pair of Spectacles</span>. On 23 April 1892, at All Saints', Notting Hill, she married the actor and manager George Rose Foss (1859&#150;1938), with whom she had a daughter, born in the following year. Within a decade they were separated, and were presumably later divorced, as her husband remarried.<br>
<br>Winifred Fraser's first major success seems to have been as Hedvig in the first London production of Ibsen's <span class="italic">The Wild Duck</span>, at the Royalty Theatre in May 1894. The power of her acting at this period is well caught by a first-night review of this production:<blockquote>Miss Winnifred [<i>sic</i>] Fraser, who had the fascinating but extremely difficult part of Hedwig [<i>sic</i>] the fourteen-year-old girl, showed rare qualities in so young an actress. Though actually a woman, she had the charm of childhood, and yet power. She possesses the rare gift of holding a house when saying nothing, but merely thinking and wondering, yet there was no visible effort or pulling of faces. (Theatre Museum, London)</blockquote>This role was one of many that she was offered in the late 1890s, a period in which she seems to have been in constant demand, working with many of the leading figures in the London theatre, including Olga Nethersole, Ben Greet, E. S. Willard, and Sir Augustus Harris, and doing much touring, notably in <span class="italic">Under the Red Robe</span> (1897).<br>
<br>By 1900 Winifred Fraser had been invited to become part of Mrs Patrick Campbell's company&#151;once more at the Royalty&#151;in, among others, the first London production of Edmond Rostand's <span class="italic">Les Romanesques</span>, &#145;[f]reely done into English verse&#146;  (programme, Theatre Museum) as <span class="italic">The Fantasticks</span>, by George Fleming. She played Sylvette, the lover of Campbell's principal-boy hero Percinet, in a production also notable for the performance of the young George Du Maurier as the &#145;Bravo&#146; Straforel, and according to a review she &#145;interpret[ed] the na&iuml;ve heroine's sentimental passages with exceptional charm and pathos&#146;  (Theatre Museum). In 1903 she made her first acquaintance with the title role of J. M. Barrie's <span class="italic">Little Mary</span>, understudying Nina Boucicault; she subsequently made the part her own, playing it in many revivals at Wyndham's Theatre, and in 1905&#150;6 touring it, with other leading roles, around Australia. In 1907 she took part in another major tour, in the leading female roles of R. B. Sheridan's <span class="italic">The School for Scandal</span> and Oscar Wilde's <span class="italic">The Importance of being Earnest</span>. This period of travel culminated, in 1910, in her first visit to the United States, where she played Barbara Pennymint in <span class="italic">Pomander Walk</span>, by Louis N. Parker, at Wallack's theater in New York, and in the following two years toured the role around the remainder of the country.<br>
<br>From this point Winifred Fraser's career seems to have been entirely based in the United States. She returned to classical repertoire in 1913, taking the role of Good-Dedes in a production of <span class="italic">Everyman</span> at the New York Children's Theater, and later in that year made her first appearance in Chicago&#151;as Nellie Heron in <span class="italic">The Necessary Evil</span>. She remained in the USA for the duration of the First World War, and, by this time in her forties, carved out a niche for herself in New York playing the many middle-aged matrons who populate turn-of-the-century melodramas, among them Mrs Greville in <span class="italic">Hush</span>, at the Little Theater in October 1916; Mrs Torrance in <span class="italic">The New Word</span>, at the Empire in May 1917; and Mrs Martha Van Zile in <span class="italic">Polly with a Past</span>, by G. Middleton and G. Bolton, at the Belasco Theater in September 1917. She maintained her home in America&#151;as well as her penchant for these roles&#151;when the war ended, and spent the 1920s on Broadway playing&#151;among many other roles&#151;Mrs Morland in J. M. Barrie's <span class="italic">Mary Rose</span> (at the Empire in December 1920), Mrs Smallwood in <span class="italic">The Enchanted Cottage</span>, by Sir Arthur Pinero (at the Ritz Theater in March 1923), and Mrs Considine in <span class="italic">Mary, Mary, quite Contrary</span>, by St John Ervine (at the Belasco in September 1923). From the late 1920s she had addresses in London, and was latterly resident in Eastbourne, Sussex, where she died on 25 November 1951. Her daughter Iris Fraser Foss (1893&#150;1973), also an actress, survived her.<br>
