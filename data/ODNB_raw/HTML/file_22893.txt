<span class="headword">Purcell,  Daniel</span>  (<em>c.</em>1670&#150;1717), <span class="occ">organist and composer</span>, was long thought to be the son of Henry the elder (<i>d</i>. 1664) and his wife, Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1699), but was in fact probably the youngest son of Thomas Purcell (<i>d</i>. 1682), Henry's brother, and his wife, Katherine. Born probably in London, he was a chorister in the choir of the Chapel Royal, where payments are recorded for his attendance at Windsor from 14 August to 26 September 1678, 22 April to 30 June 1682, and 8 July to 10 September 1682, after which his whereabouts and the source of his musical training are unknown. He was appointed organist of Magdalen College, Oxford, at some time about 1689&#150;90, and was well known as a musician and socialite. Although his earliest published compositions predate this appointment, it was while in this post that he wrote most of his early music, including an ode for Oxford's St Cecilia's day celebrations in 1693, <span class="italic">Begin and Strike th'Harmonious Lyre</span>, and a number of anthems.<br>
<br>When Henry Purcell fell ill in 1695, Daniel seems to have moved to London and taken over most of his work in the theatre. Here he wrote music for Cibber's <span class="italic">Love's Last Shift</span>, Behn's <span class="italic">The Younger Brother</span>, the anonymous <span class="italic">Neglected Virtue</span>, the unfinished <span class="italic">The Indian Queen</span>, and Manley's <span class="italic">The Lost Lover</span> before finally resigning his post at Magdalen College (probably at Easter 1696) and moving to London permanently. He kept his Oxford connections, though, writing music for St Cecilia's day odes in 1698, 1699, and 1707. However, it was in the London theatre that Purcell worked most during this hectic period, contributing music to over forty plays between 1696 and 1707, the bulk of them (over thirty) being in the first five years. The largest of these productions were Nahum Tate's <span class="italic">Brutus of Alba</span> and Thomas D'Urfey's <span class="italic">Cynthia and Endymion</span> (1696), Elkanah Settle's <span class="italic">The World in the Moon</span> (1697), and Peter Anthony Motteux's immensely popular <span class="italic">The Island Princess</span> (1699), on which he collaborated with Jeremiah Clarke and Richard Leveridge. Of his large-scale productions, only John Oldmixon's <span class="italic">The Grove</span> (1700) and an adapted version of Nathaniel Lee's <span class="italic">The Rival Queens</span> (1701) date from the eighteenth century, as Purcell suffered because of the growing vogue for Italianate opera. His only contribution towards this genre, the advertised setting of an adaptation of Philippe Quinault's <span class="italic">Orlando Furioso</span> (1707), was never produced and possibly never even written.<br>
<br>Purcell's setting of William Congreve's Musick Prize masque <span class="italic">The Judgment of Paris</span> (1701) was awarded third prize, behind John Weldon and Jeremiah Clarke, although Gottfried Finger (who finished fourth) claimed it was the best work after his own. In London, he also wrote odes for the return of William III from Flanders (1697), a St Cecilia ode (&#145;Begin, begin the noble song&#146;, with words by Samuel Wesley the elder) for 1698, and two odes for the celebration of Queen Anne's birthday, <span class="italic">Welcome, Welcome, Glorious Day</span> (1698) and <span class="italic">Again the Glorious Morn</span> (1700). His collection of Italian-style cantatas with English words, published in 1713, was one of the first of its type.<br>
<br>Soon after Purcell moved to London he became organist at St Dunstan-in-the-East. The surviving records suggest that he played for no pay from 1696, but he was certainly in the post by November 1698, where the churchwardens' accounts record the first payment: &#145;Mr Purcell 1/2 years salary &pound;10&#146;. He seems to have kept this job throughout all of his time in London, as his final payment is dated 11 November 1717, only days before his death. He was also organist at St Andrew's, Holborn, where in 1713 Dr Henry Sacheverell (formerly his colleague at Magdalen College) was appointed to the living. Sacheverell found the organ shut up and unpaid for, and so arranged for the money to be raised and appointed Daniel as organist. This may have been an unpopular move, as future organists were democratically elected, comments being recorded about the previous appointment procedures at these subsequent elections. Purcell's association with Sacheverell and the high-church party contributed to the suspicion that he had nonjuring sympathies. He also wrote instrumental music, his numerous sonatas for one or two flutes being published in 1708&#150;10 and performed in a number of concerts at the York Buildings and at Stationers' Hall. <span class="italic">The Psalms Set Full</span>, which demonstrates the genre of psalm organ interludes, was published posthumously in 1718. Autograph manuscripts of his anthems can be found in the British Library (Add. MSS 17841, 31461) and in the Bodleian, Oxford (T 310).<br>
<br>Daniel Purcell was also famous as a punster and socialite. While at Magdalen College, he was threatened with summons to the university court owing to non-payment of debt, and his payments of college battels were sporadic, to say the least. <span class="italic">Joe Miller</span>, the collection of jokes and puns first published in 1738, contains many examples of his celebrated wit, some of which were reproduced by Sir John Hawkins.<br>
<br>On 9 May 1705, at St Anne Blackfriars, a Daniel Purcell married Elizabeth Tozer. In the vicar-general's marriage licence application, the couple are described as from the parish of St Paul's, Covent Garden, and are stated to be aged &#145;about 35 years&#146; and &#145;27 years&#146; respectively. If this was Daniel Purcell the composer, then a birth date of <i>c</i>.1670 must follow. This places his birth considerably after the death of his supposed father, Henry the elder, in 1664. It appears that Franklin B. Zimmerman, in his major biography of Henry Purcell, suppressed this information for some reason, transcribing the entire document apart from the reference to Daniel's age. While some doubt may be cast on this person's identity, as Daniel Purcell the composer is described as &#145;Celibis&#146; in a record relating to his will, the existence of a wife would explain the appearance of a portrait miniature depicting a female in a portrait putatively thought to be of Daniel.<br>
<br>The date of Purcell's death is unknown, but he was buried at St Andrew's, Holborn, on 26 November 1717. Although some of his music was performed throughout the eighteenth century, he has remained in the shadow of his illustrious relative ever since.<br>
