<span class="headword">Dingley, Sir  Thomas</span>  (1506<span class="mult">x</span>8&#150;1539), <span class="occ">knight of the hospital of St John of Jerusalem</span>, was the son of John Dingley of the Isle of Wight and Mabel, or Mabell, Weston of Rozel, Jersey. His mother was the sister of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29136/', "Sir William Weston")</script>, a prominent hospitaller who became prior of the order of St John in England in 1527. Weston granted Dingley a pension of 125 &eacute;cus on his reception into the order in 1526, when he would have been at least eighteen, and continued to favour him throughout his career. Although licensed to return home almost immediately, between 1528 and 1532 the young knight remained with the order's convent as it migrated between Italy, southern France, and Malta. In 1531 he was rewarded with the preceptory of North Baddesley, Hampshire, and was retained in the service of the grand master, a sign that further advancement was likely. Shortly after this he returned to England, where Weston granted him the prioral estate of Stansgate, and secured royal letters asking the grand master that he should receive further preferment. In 1535&#150;6 he shuttled back and forth between England and Malta, and passing through southern France during one of these journeys he managed to persuade the grand master elect, Didier de Sainct-Jailhe, to collate him to another preceptory, Shingay (Cambridgeshire). Sainct-Jailhe, however, had no right to confer any benefices until he should reach the convent, and died before he could make the journey. In the meantime Ambrose Cave had been appointed to Shingay from Malta. A bitter row developed, with the prior taking Dingley's side, refusing to obey conventual mandates to put Cave in possession, and securing royal confirmation of his nephew's appointment.<br>
<br>The situation was completely transformed in September 1537, when an envoy of the order and three English brethren gained access to court. On 18 September, probably as a result of accusations advanced by his brethren, Dingley was committed to the Tower under suspicion of treason. It was alleged that at Richard Pate's house in Genoa he had openly discussed the possibility of Henry VIII losing his throne, had accused the king of bloodthirstiness before a prominent French hospitaller, and had committed youthful misdemeanours of which Henry was reminded by Clement West, the head of the English brethren in Malta. Soon after Dingley's arrest Baddesley and Shingay were granted to Thomas Seymour and Richard Longe. On 18 May 1539 Dingley was attainted, on the grounds that he had &#145;moved divers outward princes to levy war&#146; against the king  (<span class="italic">LP Henry VIII</span>, 14/1, 867(15)), and on 9 July he was beheaded on Tower Hill, along with Sir Adrian Fortescue.<br>
