<span class="headword">Browne, Sir  Denis John Wolko</span>  (1892&#150;1967), <span class="occ">paediatric surgeon</span>, was born on 28 April 1892 in Melbourne, Australia, the eldest in the family of four sons and two daughters of Sylvester Browne, explorer, gold prospector, and farmer, whose father had emigrated from Ireland in 1831, and his wife, Anne Catherine (Nancy), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26332/', "Sir William Jonas Foster Stawell (1815&#150;1889)")</script>, chief justice of Victoria, Australia. He was nephew of the author Thomas Alexander Browne (Rolf Boldrewood) (1826&#150;1915). Denis Browne was educated at King's School, Parramatta, Sydney, and Sydney University (MB, 1914). He joined the 13th light horse regiment and served in Gallipoli before being invalided home. He spent the last two years of the war in France as a major with Australian field ambulance units. Between 1922, when he gained his FRCS, and 1927, he was appointed successively house surgeon, registrar, and resident surgical officer at the Hospital for Sick Children, Great Ormond Street, London. He was also appointed consultant in congenital abnormalities to the London county council, working at Queen Mary's Hospital for Children, Carshalton. He was made consultant surgeon to the Hospital for Sick Children in 1928. He worked there until his retirement in 1957.<br>
<br>Browne was the first surgeon who operated exclusively on children and was the founder of modern paediatric surgery in England. He made outstanding contributions to all branches of children's surgery but his lifelong interest was the aetiology of malformations. From his great clinical experience he was able to postulate his &#145;mechanical theory&#146;, a conception of the fundamental part played by intra-uterine position and pressure on the production of congenital malformations. He was a magnificent surgical technician, a perfectionist who constantly improved his techniques, and ingenious in developing many new surgical instruments and splints. His methods of treatment were new and often revolutionary and were frequently attacked and criticized, but they worked.<br>
<br>Browne was Arris and Gale lecturer (1934 and 1954) and Hunterian professor (1947, 1949, 1950, and 1951) of the Royal College of Surgeons, and co-founder and first president of the British Association of Paediatric Surgeons in 1953. In 1957 he received the Dawson-Williams prize for services to paediatrics and the William E. Ladd medal in the USA for outstanding contributions to paediatric surgery. In 1961 he was appointed KCVO and a chevalier of the legion of honour. In 1965 he was made an honorary fellow of the Australasian College of Surgeons and became president of the International College of Surgeons. He was visiting professor at many universities in all five continents. Later, the Denis Browne gold medal became the highest honour the British Association of Paediatric Surgeons could bestow.<br>
<br>Browne was widely read, had a keen cynical sense of humour, and was intolerant of ignorance, illogicality, and conformity. He disliked committee procedures and bureaucracy. All his life he fought against prejudice, a struggle he greatly enjoyed. He was tall and elegant, a tennis player of a high standard, and an excellent shot.<br>
<br>In 1927 Browne married the novelist Helen de Guerry Simpson (1897&#150;1940), daughter of Edward Percy Simpson, solicitor, of Sydney. They had one daughter. In 1945 he married Lady Moyra Blanche Madeleine, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35567/', "Vere Brabazon Ponsonby, ninth earl of Bessborough")</script>, former governor-general of Canada. They had a son and a daughter. Browne died at his home, 16 Wilton Street, Grosvenor Place, London, on 9 January 1967. He was survived by his second wife.<br>
