<span class="headword">Christiansen,  Arthur Robin</span>  (1904&#150;1963), <span class="occ">newspaper editor</span>, was born in Wallasey, Cheshire, on 27 July 1904, the only son and second of the three children of Louis Niels Christiansen, a master shipwright of Danish descent, and his wife, Ellen Miller. From the age of fourteen, at Wallasey grammar school, he was producing a magazine&#151;reporting school events, writing the short stories, drawing the illustrations, and stitching the pages together on his mother's sewing machine. He had fallen in love with the printed word, and he never fell out of it. Soon after his sixteenth birthday he joined the <span class="italic">Wallasey and Wirral Chronicle</span> as a reporter. From there, three and a half years later, he moved to the <span class="italic">Liverpool Evening Express</span> and <span class="italic">Daily Courier</span>, and in 1925 he was appointed the <span class="italic">Evening Express</span>'s London editor. Within a year he was news editor of the <span class="italic">Sunday Express</span>, and in 1928 assistant editor. He took charge of the office on the Sunday morning in 1930 when the airship R101 crashed in flames at Beauvais on its maiden voyage to India, and brought out a special late-morning edition which won the admiration of Fleet Street and, more importantly, brought him to the attention of the proprietor, Lord Beaverbrook.<br>
<br>In 1932 Beaverbrook sent Christiansen to Manchester to edit the northern edition of the <span class="italic">Daily Express</span>; he then brought him back to London in 1933, first as assistant editor and then, in the same year, as editor of the <span class="italic">Daily Express</span>. He was only twenty-nine. It was the beginning of a remarkable association which was to last nearly twenty-five years and to lift the <span class="italic">Daily Express</span> from a sale of 1.7 million to 4 million. Christiansen described their association thus: &#145;I was a journalist not a political animal. My proprietor was a journalist and a political animal. The policies were Lord Beaverbrook's the presentation mine&#146;  (Griffiths, 154). This was a frank and truthful piece of self-analysis but it conveys no flavour of the battles, the tensions, the coolnesses, the moments of warm affection that made up the association of the two men.<br>
<br>Christiansen's presentation was not simply a matter of making headlines bigger and bolder; by the brilliant and highly personal use of type and illustration he combined legibility with dramatic appearance in a harmony new to popular journalism. His best work represented a revolution in newspaper design&#151;not always acceptable to the typographical purists but much copied by other newspapers and overwhelming in its appeal to the public. At the very outset of his editorship Christiansen&#151;who had the support and understanding of Beaverbrook's able manager E. J. Robertson&#151;surrounded himself with forceful, energetic men of his own generation, many of whom stayed with him throughout his career. A constant flow of talent was recruited into the paper's columns.<br>
<br>In a particularly turbulent period of a turbulent calling Christiansen inspired loyalty not only by the exercise of considerable personal charm but by his daily staff conferences and his daily bulletins. His conferences were conducted with a high-spirited, shirt-sleeved exuberance which not only expressed his own jovial, generous nature, but also set the tone for the next day's paper. Dullness was banished; optimism shone through. What was good for the executives turned out to be a formula which had an intense appeal for those millions of readers whose struggles, ambitions, and aspirations Christiansen instinctively understood. Immediately the morning conference ended he wrote his daily bulletin, in which he analysed the paper, gave praise or blame, stated general principles, produced such much-quoted phrases as &#145;the man in the back streets of Derby&#146; (a character who grew into the prototype <span class="italic">Express</span> reader), and developed his ideas on presentation of news.<br>
<br>Yet policy and presentation could not be wholly divorced; in the printed word the medium can also be the message. An example of this occurred when in 1938 the <span class="italic">Express</span> published the headline &#145;There will be no war&#146;, with the later addition of &#145;this year, or next year either&#146;. Authorship remains doubtful; what is certain is that Christiansen projected the slogan so prominently and so vigorously that the headline subsequently became a convenient weapon for critics to employ in attacking everything they found hateful about <span class="italic">Express</span> political policies. Criticism of political policies, however, did nothing to halt the rising sales of the <span class="italic">Express</span> and for many years, until the post-war rise of the <span class="italic">Daily Mirror</span>, it had the highest sale of any newspaper in Britain.<br>
<br>In July 1956, after twenty-three years of editorship, Christiansen had a heart attack while staying with Beaverbrook in the south of France. He was no longer able to edit in the pattern of vigorous leadership that he had established, and after an unhappy period when he tried, and failed, to adjust himself to new jobs and to a new relationship with Beaverbrook, he resigned in May 1958 and finally severed his connection with the Beaverbrook press in 1959.<br>
<br>Christiansen switched his energies to work in television and films but he never found there the satisfaction that newspapers had brought him. On 27 September 1963 he collapsed and died of a heart attack in a television studio at Anglia House, Norwich; a funeral service was held on 3 October at the church of St Bartholomew, Holland-on-Sea, Essex.<br>
<br>In 1926 Christiansen had married Brenda Winifred Shepherd, with whom he had two sons and two daughters, and who survived him. His elder son, Michael Robin, edited the <span class="italic">Sunday Mirror</span> from 1964 to 1972.<br>
