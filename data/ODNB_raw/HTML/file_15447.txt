<span class="headword">Ker,  (Charles) Henry Bellenden</span> <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>Charles Henry Gawler]</span>  (<em>c.</em>1785&#150;1871), <span class="occ">law reformer</span>, was the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15454/', "John Bellenden Ker, formerly Gawler (1764&#150;1842)")</script>, botanist, and his wife, Ann. He was baptized at St Andrew's, Holborn, London, on 18 February 1787. He joined Lincoln's Inn in London in November 1804, was called to the bar in June 1814, and afterwards practised as a conveyancing barrister. He was eventually appointed a conveyancing counsel to the court of chancery, and for some years was recorder of Andover. He married Elizabeth Anne, daughter of Edward Clarke, a solicitor. She was &#145;a very handsome, clever, and at heart most kindly woman, of whom he was in fact very proud, but they certainly did not hit it off together&#146;  (Ludlow, 46). They had no children.<br>
<br>Ker was a contemporary at Lincoln's Inn of Henry Brougham, who provided the material for Ker's first article in the <span class="italic">Edinburgh Review</span>, on the education of the poor, in 1819. Ker possibly wrote two further articles at this time on the abuse of charities. He was an energetic member of the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge and contributed woodcuts, and lives&#151;of Wren and Michelangelo, for instance&#151;to its <span class="italic">Penny Magazine</span>. He promoted parliamentary reform from 1830 to 1832 and was a member of the Parliamentary Boundary Commission established by the <span class="roman">Reform Bill</span>. He stood, unsuccessfully, as a whig for the Norwich constituency in the reformed parliament. He gave evidence before the real property commission in 1828 and sat as a member of the public records commission in 1831.<br>
<br>Ker's most important work as a law reformer was in corporation law, conveyancing, criminal law, and statute law. In 1837 he produced for the Board of Trade a comprehensive report on partnership law and the possible adoption of the French conception of the limited partnership into English law. Ker's suggestion of a system of registration of large partnerships was implemented in the <span class="roman">Joint Stock Companies Act</span> (7 &amp; 8 Vict. c. 110) of 1844. These developments were significant in the eventual acceptance of limited liability companies. Ker was an early advocate of a deeds' registration system for conveyancing transactions, and he was a member of the real property commission that recommended such a system in 1850. He was also responsible for drafting the <span class="roman">Real Property Amendment Act</span> (8 &amp; 9 Vict. c. 106) of 1844.<br>
<br>In 1833 Lord Brougham, as lord chancellor, appointed Ker a member of the royal commission on the criminal law, which was instructed to digest the criminal law into a single statute. This commission produced eight reports between 1834 and 1845 which culminated in &#145;An act of crimes and punishments&#146;, the first draft code of English criminal law. Lord Brougham attempted to enact this code, but the lord chancellor Lord Lyndhurst decided to appoint another commission to reconsider it. Ker was a member of this commission also, and it produced five reports between 1845 and 1849. It proved impossible to enact their recommendations, though their efforts contributed to the seven criminal-law consolidation acts passed in 1861. Ker was possibly the most important member of these commissions: indeed, it was largely due to his badgering of Brougham that Lyndhurst appointed the second commission.<br>
<br>Ker had a lifelong commitment to the improvement of statute law. His &#145;great interest and labour&#146; during the first years of the criminal law commission was the preparation of its outline for the reform of statute law  (<span class="italic">Parl. papers</span>, 1835, 35.365). He gave evidence before a select committee of the House of Commons in 1836 on the improvement of statutory drafting, and contributed an article on statute law to the <span class="italic">Edinburgh Review</span> in 1847. In early 1853 the lord chancellor Lord Cranworth took up the cause of statute law reform, establishing an informal statute revision board of five members and appointing Ker at its head. In August 1854 Lord Cranworth replaced this board with the statute law commission, which included many senior lawyers, judges, and politicians. Ker was its primary working member. He continued to serve on this commission until its demise in 1859.<br>
<br>The 1853 board and the subsequent commission attracted considerable criticism, much of which was personally directed against Ker. The <span class="italic">Law Review</span> and the <span class="italic">Law Magazine and Review</span> devoted a series of articles to the failures and defects of the board and the commission, calling attention at one point &#145;to evidences of the eminent inability and unfitness for his task which are to be found in Mr. Bellenden Ker &hellip; Ten thousand years would not produce a result in the present fashion of working&#146;  (<span class="italic">Law Review</span>, 22.93&#150;5). There was criticism in both houses of parliament of the commission's expense and lack of progress. Nevertheless, Ker retained the confidence of Lord Cranworth, who often consulted him on legislative matters, and Lord Brougham paid warm tribute in the House of Lords to his work. Fitzroy Kelly defended the commission in the Commons and referred to the difficulties in translating its work into legislation. Ker retired from practice in 1860 and lived the rest of his life in Cannes, France, where he bought a house with his presumed sister-in-law, the artist <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5498/', "Harriet Ludlow Clarke")</script>. He died in Cannes on 2 November 1871. He was survived by his wife.<br>
<br>Ker was interested in art and science; he became a fellow of the Royal Society in 1819 but lost his membership in 1831 through non-payment of dues. The story that he resigned in 1830 in protest against the election of the duke of Sussex as president is incorrect. He sought reinstatement, claiming the burden of other work for his failure to pay, but received no response. He was an original member of the Arundel Society (founded in 1848, for producing printed copies of paintings by old masters) and was interested in the foundation of schools of design. He was one of the first private growers of orchids and wrote a series of articles in the <span class="italic">Gardeners' Chronicle</span>. He had a hasty temper and a sarcastic manner, and he was quick to criticize the work of others. In 1829, for instance, he took up claims of financial mismanagement of the Horticultural Society, which resulted in voluminous correspondence with its secretaries. He was also an energetic and innovative, if sometimes impractical, law reformer. He exemplified the tireless organizer of detail&#151;in the form of data, papers, articles, reports, and draft legislation&#151;whose perseverance and labours provided the foundation for the transformation of the law during his lifetime. He enjoyed strong friendships, as is evidenced by his surviving correspondence with Brougham, Lyndhurst, and Cranworth. Physically, Ker was a short, rotund man, with a ruddy complexion.<br>
