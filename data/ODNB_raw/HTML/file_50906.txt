<span class="headword">Willdey,  George</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1676, <em>d.</em> 1737), <span class="occ">optical instrument maker and retailer</span>, was baptized on 8 February 1676 at St Editha's Church in Church Eaton, Staffordshire. He was the son of Thomas Willdey, a &#145;gentleman&#146; of Church Eaton, and his wife, Frances, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Chetwind. Following his father's death Willdey moved to London, where on 25 February 1695 he was bound apprentice to the optician John Yarwell (<i>d</i>. 1708), a talented lens maker, of Ludgate Street. He gained his freedom from the Spectaclemakers' Company on 26 March 1702 and thereafter worked as a journeyman for Yarwell and then for his rival John Marshall, whose premises were at the sign of the Archimedes and Spectacles in Ludgate Street.<br>
<br>Within four years Willdey had entered into a business partnership with Timothy Brandreth, with whom he opened a shop in Ludgate at the sign of the Archimedes and Globe. Willdey and Brandreth used trade cards and newspapers to advertise a wide range of mainly optical instruments including vision aids, microscopes, telescopes, and burning glasses. In 1707 the partners participated in a brief but vitriolic print advertising war with John Yarwell and Brandreth's former master Ralph Sterrop, even placing wagers on a public comparison of their respective telescopes. Yarwell and Sterrop claimed that their former apprentices were selling microscopes made by Edmund Culpeper, whose mathematical instruments they openly advertised. It seems likely that Culpeper made the bodies of the microscopes, but that Willdey and Brandreth inserted their own lenses. This was a common practice in early modern instrument making, given the different skills required for making glass and non-glass components, and one which Willdey would continue to adopt. He later supplied both finished instruments and instrument components to a number of other makers in London.<br>
<br>On 30 November 1709 Willdey married Judith Sene or De Senne (1679&#150;1740), a French Huguenot immigrant of St Anne's, Blackfriars, where the couple married. The Willdeys had at least five children, two of whom&#151;George (<i>bap</i>. 1713) and Judith (<i>bap</i>. 1715)&#151;died in childhood. Another George (<i>bap</i>. 1716) died of consumption in 1736 at his father's residence at Clapton, near Hackney. Thomas (1717&#150;1748) later took over the family business, and in April 1733 Jane Frances married Peter Fenoulhet of St Margaret's, Westminster, then clerk of the entries in the Excise Office. Fenoulhet's filing of a number of lawsuits on behalf of their son, James John, over purported mishandling of the family business has ensured the preservation of eleven inventories of household goods and commercial stock from 1737. It also preserved partial shop and household accounts, both dated and undated, unevenly drawn from across the period 1710 to 1737. These are the only extant shop accounts from the London instrument trade before the late eighteenth century.<br>
<br>Willdey's marriage into the Huguenot community brought craft and trade connections that enabled him to expand his stock to sell a range of &#145;curious Toys&#146;, as well as instruments  (<span class="italic">Flying Post, or, the Post Master</span>, 24 Jan 1713). In the early eighteenth century &#145;toys&#146; denoted small fashionable d&eacute;cor and accoutrements for adults, such as mother of pearl game counters or ingenious snuff boxes. Willdey also sold printed goods, beginning in 1709 with maps and globes produced in collaboration with the publisher John Senex and his associates. He later purchased and reused the copper plates for popular historical maps, such as Christopher Saxton's atlas of England and Wales of 1574&#150;9. In 1711 Willdey parted company with Brandreth and, four years later, moved his premises at the corner of Ludgate and St Paul's Churchyard. Thereafter his stock expanded further to include snuff, coffee and tea, medicinal and cosmetic elixirs, cutlery and china, and commemorative items. He was unique in the instrument trade, and unusual among retailers, in advertising hundreds of times in the fledgling London newspapers, boasting that &#145;no shop in Europe can shew so great a Choice as his contains&#146;  (<span class="italic">Daily Post</span>, 26 March 1729). One of his more remarkable advertising ploys was to erect a giant burning glass on his roof, which recalled recent scientific experiments with these instruments  (<span class="italic">Post Man</span>, 1&#150;3 Nov 1720). Willdey was also unusually active on the court of the Spectaclemakers' Company, attending almost all of its meetings over two and a half decades. He worked his way up the ranks and served as master for an unprecedented eleven-year term between 1722 and 1733, only cutting ties at the apparent onset of ill health.<br>
<br>As the range of its stock grew, Willdey's &#145;Toy-shop&#146; attracted titled and royal visitors such as the whig politician James, first Earl Stanhope, and the prince and princess of Wales, as well as foreign ambassadors and royalty. His wholesale business exported vast quantities of wares to the British provinces as well as to Portugal, Spain, Italy, Germany, and the Netherlands. Willdey accumulated such a large and diverse stock by using tens of thousands of instruments and instrument tubes to barter for other types of wares. He was regularly assisted by his wife and by fifteen apprentices who were mainly drawn from Staffordshire, the Huguenot community, and his family. Eight were women, which was unique in the male-dominated instrument trade and unusual even in the toy trade.<br>
<br>George Willdey died on 9 November 1737 at Ludgate of an apoplectic fit, having suffered ill health for a number of years. He had requested burial &#145;in a decent manner [with] only three Coaches and a Hearse with Gloves Rings and Scarves to the Pall Bearers&#146;  (will, TNA: PRO, PROB 11/686/128). On the following day the <span class="italic">London Evening Post</span> commented on Willdey's &#145;noted great Toyshop at the Corner of Ludgate-street by St. Paul's, where he acquir'd a plentiful Fortune with a fair Character&#146;. A week later he was described as &#145;the most noted Toyman in Europe&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Old Whig, or, The Consistent Protestant</span>, 17 Nov 1737). Willdey left behind houses in Clapton and Ludgate, fashionable trappings including a carriage, retail and wholesale stock worth over &pound;7000, and an estate of more than &pound;9000.<br>
<br>In his will Willdey had expressed concern that &#145;my Son Thomas will not nor canst Settle his mind to Business&#146;  (will, TNA: PRO, PROB 11/686/128). His widow duly took over the shop with the assistance of a former apprentice, Susanna Passavant&#151;daughter of a deceased Huguenot jeweller of Soho&#151;until Judith's death at Clapton in 1740. Passavant then continued as shop manager under Thomas, who, freed from the Spectaclemakers' by patrimony, apprenticed one woman in 1746. After Thomas's death in 1748 Passavant left to run her own successful shop at Ludgate Hill. However, George Willdey's reputation survived the closure of his shop. In her poem of 1750, &#145;Soliloquy on an Empty Purse&#146;, Mary Jones fondly recalled the &#145;temptations thick and strong&#146; to &#145;stop / At Wildey's toys&#146; (quoted in Lonsdale, 162).<br>
