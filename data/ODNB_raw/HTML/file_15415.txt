<span class="headword">Kenrick,  Timothy</span>  (1759&#150;1804), <span class="occ">Unitarian minister and tutor</span>, was born on 26 January 1759 at Wynn Hall in the parish of Ruabon, Denbighshire, one of the four sons of John Kenrick (<i>d</i>. 1803), a landowner, and his wife, Mary, the daughter of Timothy Quarrell of Llanfyllin, Montgomeryshire. The family was Presbyterian, and Timothy was baptized at Chester Street Chapel, Wrexham, on 6 February 1759. His brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/50557/', "Archibald Kenrick (1760&#150;1835)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/53590/', "Kenrick family")</script>] founded a dynasty of hardware manufacturers in West Bromwich.<br>
<br>In 1774 Kenrick entered the dissenting academy at Daventry, then conducted by Caleb Ashworth and from 1775 by Thomas Robins. At the end of his course in 1779 he was appointed tutor in mathematics and natural philosophy, and on Robins's resignation in 1781 he continued under Robins's successor, Thomas Belsham. He left the academy in January 1784 to take up the post of assistant minister to James Manning at George's Meeting, Exeter, and was ordained there on 28 July 1785. On 24 February 1786, at St Mary Major, Exeter, Kenrick married Mary (<i>d</i>. 1793), the daughter of John Waymouth of the city. They had five surviving children: Lucy, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15414/', "John Kenrick")</script>, Samuel, Mary (<i>b</i>. 1791), and <a href="#cosubject_15413">George [<i>see below</i>]</a>; the twin of Samuel, George, died in infancy. In 1794, following Mary's death, Kenrick married the sister of his former tutor, Elizabeth (1743&#150;1819), who was the second daughter of James Belsham (<i>d</i>. 1770), a dissenting minister, and Anne Woodward (<i>d</i>. 1780).<br>
<br>During his ministry in Exeter, Kenrick encountered both religious and political controversy, especially in the years following the French Revolution. Although he worked well with his senior colleague, Manning, they differed theologically, for Manning was an Arian and Kenrick followed Belsham in holding a Unitarian view of Christ's nature. This division was underlined when Kenrick wrote a preamble to the rules of the Western Unitarian Society, which was formed in 1792 and explicitly excluded Arians. News of the Birmingham riots of 14 July 1791 compelled Kenrick to condemn the rioters, who had attacked dissenting chapels, in a sermon preached on 24 July. A number of his congregation gathered to request him to refrain from discussing &#145;subjects of a political nature &hellip; in the pulpit&#146;  (&#145;Kenrick letters&#146;, 4/1, 69). Kenrick responded by defending his right &#145;to treat of any Political duty in the Pulpit&#146; should &#145;a just occasion&#146; arise  (ibid., 70), a response that satisfied his congregation. A year later, however, in October 1792, he again courted controversy when he &#145;prayed for success to those who were endeavouring to promote the liberty &amp; happiness of mankind&#146;  (ibid., 80). This apparent expression of support for the French revolutionaries led John Merivale to withdraw from Kenrick's congregation in protest. Although Kenrick was appalled at the violence of the terror in France, he deplored the British government's measures to restrict civil liberties and refused to observe the general fast on 1 February 1793, the day that Britain went to war with France. Continued criticism led him to offer his resignation in April 1793, but separate petitions of support from the men and women in his congregation persuaded him to withdraw his resignation. He none the less considered escaping the atmosphere of religious and political intolerance in Britain by following the example of his brother-in-law Ralph Eddowes, and emigrating to the United States, yet concern for the health and welfare of his wife and family seems to have dissuaded him. By 1798 he had decided to stay in Exeter, for he declined the invitation to become divinity professor at Manchester Academy.<br>
<br>In October 1799 Kenrick and Joseph Bretland reopened the dissenting academy in Exeter that had flourished under Joseph Hallett and had been revived by Samuel Merivale in the 1760s; it was known as the third Exeter Academy. Three pupils were in attendance by mid-October, and, as Kenrick reported to his father, &#145;this is but a small beginning, but we hope it may come to something more. A Subscription has been opened &amp; a Society formed for ye support of Divinity Students wch will I hope in time do much good&#146;  (Byng Kenrick, 125). Kenrick rented the house adjacent to his own to house boarding pupils, the first of whom, Coffin, was a grandnephew of Richard Price, and sent for the academy's library, which since 1786 had been loaned to Hackney Academy and was no longer in use, Hackney Academy having closed in 1796. The two tutors divided the teaching between them: Kenrick took responsibility for logic, metaphysics, moral education, the evidences of natural and revealed religion, the <span class="roman">New Testament</span>, and Jewish antiquities, and shared the teaching of Latin, Greek, Hebrew, and English composition and elocution. Eleven students, including James Hews Bransby, underwent the whole course, and four others, among them Kenrick's eldest son, John, received a part of their training before the academy closed on 25 March 1805.<br>
<br>While on a preaching tour Kenrick died suddenly, &#145;as he was walking in the fields, near Wrexham&#146;  (Bogue and Bennett, 4.273), on 22 August 1804. He was buried on 26 August in the dissenters' burial-ground at Rhosddu, near Wrexham. In addition to four sermons published separately during his lifetime, two volumes of <span class="italic">Discourses on Various Topics</span> (1805) were published posthumously, as was Kenrick's most important work, <span class="italic">An Exposition of the Historical Writings of the New Testament</span> (3 vols., 1807). The <span class="italic">Exposition</span> demonstrated Kenrick's considerable learning, yet was soon to be superseded by the new methods of historical criticism and philology developed by German scholars.<br>
<br>Kenrick's fourth son, <a name="cosubject_15413"></a><span class="headword">George Kenrick</span>  (1792&#150;1874), <span class="occ">Unitarian minister</span>, was born at Exeter on 28 October 1792 and was educated at the boarding-school established in Exeter by Lant Carpenter, who had succeeded Timothy Kenrick as co-pastor at George's Meeting. He matriculated from Glasgow University in 1808, and from 1810 to 1813 studied under Charles Wellbeloved at Manchester College, York, where his elder brother John was classics tutor. He served as Unitarian minister to congregations at Chesterfield (1813&#150;14), Hull (1815&#150;21), Maidstone (1822&#150;6), Hampstead (1829&#150;45), and Battle (1845&#150;7). From 1833 to 1860 he was a trustee of Dr Williams's foundations. He published sermons and contributed to the <span class="italic">Monthly Repository</span> and other periodicals. Of his three marriages, his first, on 10 September 1817, was to Mary Ann, the youngest daughter of Richard Hodgson, Unitarian minister at Doncaster; they had a daughter, Marianne, who married Abraham Champion, a Bristol engineer. His second wife, whom he married at St Leonard's, Exeter, on 11 October 1822, was Margaret (<i>bap</i>. 1794, <i>d</i>. 1824), the daughter of Charles Bowring, a wool merchant, and his wife, Sarah Jane Anne Lane, and the sister of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/3087/', "Sir John Bowring (1792&#150;1872)")</script>. Lastly, in May 1848 he married Sarah (<i>d</i>. 1888), the daughter of Thomas Walters. In 1860 he retired in considerable ill health to Tunbridge Wells, where he died on 2 December 1874.<br>
