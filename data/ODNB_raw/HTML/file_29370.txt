<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Wight,  Robert</span>  (1796&#150;1872), <span class="occ">botanist</span>, was born at Milton, Duncra Hill, East Lothian, on 6 July 1796, the twelfth of fourteen children of Alexander Wight, a writer to the signet, and his wife, Jane. He was educated at Edinburgh high school and the University of Edinburgh, gaining his surgeon's diploma in 1816 and graduating MD two years later.<br>
<br>Wight went on several voyages as surgeon, including one to America, before entering the East India Company's service in 1819. He was appointed assistant surgeon on 25 May of that year, and attached to the 42nd native infantry stationed at Madras, where he employed Indians to collect plants, and, then knowing little about botany, obtained copies of G. L. Willdenow's <span class="italic">Species plantarum</span>, C. H. Persoon's <span class="italic">Synopsis</span>, and an English translation of Linnaeus's <span class="italic">Genera plantarum</span>. A collection sent by him to Professor Robert Graham in 1823 was lost at sea, but one formed at Samulcotta, Rajahmundry, Vellore, and Madras, reached W. J. Hooker at Glasgow in 1826. In that year Wight was appointed to succeed James Shuter as naturalist in the Madras presidency. He made an extensive tour, lasting nine months, in the southern provinces (his route is marked on the map in N. Wallich's <span class="italic">Plantae Asiaticae rariores</span>) during which he collected birds, insects, and minerals as well as many plants. In 1828, on the abolition of his Madras office, Wight was appointed garrison surgeon at Negapatam and thoroughly explored that neighbourhood and Tanjore, employing Indian collectors and artists at his own expense.<br>
<br>In 1831, having attained the rank of surgeon on 22 February, Wight contracted jungle fever and returned home on three years' leave, most of which he spent in Edinburgh. He carried with him about 100,000 plant specimens, the duplicates of which he distributed to institutions and individuals in Britain and Europe. He published an account of part of his Indian collection in four articles in W. J. Hooker's <span class="italic">Botanical Miscellany</span> (vols. 2 and 3, 1830&#150;33). These were included in his <span class="italic">Illustrations of Indian Botany, Principally of the Southern Parts of the Peninsula</span> (1831&#150;2). This book and three of the four articles incorrectly give Wight's forename as Richard.<br>
<br>However, during his leave Wight was mainly occupied in preparing, with George Walker-Arnott, one of his chief works, the <span class="italic">Prodromus florae peninsulae Indiae orientalis</span> (1839), which J. D. Hooker and T. Thomson, in their introductory essay to the <span class="italic">Flora Indica</span> (1855), described as &#145;the most able and valuable contribution to Indian botany which has ever appeared, and one which has few rivals in the whole domain of botanical literature&#146;. Wight's return to India resulted in only the first volume's being published: even so, that work describes nearly fourteen hundred species, using A. P. de Candolle's natural classification, and in 1833&#150;7 Wight issued a lithographic catalogue of 2400 species enumerated in it. While Wight was staying with Hooker in Glasgow he learned the craft of lithography and purchased presses and tools to use in India. With J. E. Smith's and J. Sowerby's <span class="italic">English Botany</span> (1790&#150;1814) as his model, it was his intention to publish a series of plates of Indian plants.<br>
<br>On returning to India in 1834 Wight was attached to the 33rd native infantry at Bellary, and marched with them to Palamcottai, near Cape Comorin, a distance of some 700 miles. There he recruited three Indian collectors. He then planned a systematic series of plates to illustrate J. R. Ainslie's <span class="italic">Materia medica of Hindustaan</span> (1813; 2nd edn, 1826), a scheme which he never carried out but in the course of which he published various papers on medicinal plants in the <span class="italic">Madras Journal of Science</span>. The garden formed by the Agri-Horticultural Society of Madras in 1835 got off to a good start with Wight as its dynamic secretary. The following year he was seized with a severe attack of fever in Tinnevelly and convalesced for a few weeks in Ceylon. In the same year he was relieved of military duties and transferred to the revenue department, with instructions to investigate the state of agriculture in south India, in particular, cotton, tobacco, coffee, senna, and other useful plants. In this capacity he had charge from February 1842 to 1850 of experimental cotton farms at Coimbatore. (A detailed account of his work there is given in J. F. Royle, <span class="italic">On the Culture and Commerce of Cotton in India</span>, 1851, 467&#150;523.) On 17 January 1838 Wight married Rosa Harriet, daughter of Lacy Gray Ford of the Madras medical board.<br>
<br>By 1838 Wight had trained a team of Indian craftsmen capable of lithographing two illustrated books almost simultaneously. He embarked on their publication fully convinced that textual descriptions of plants alone were inadequate. <span class="italic">Illustrations of Indian Botany</span> (1838&#150;50) ceased after only two volumes with 182 crudely hand-coloured plates by Indian artists. The 2101 plates in the companion work, <span class="italic">Icones plantarum Indiae orientalis</span> (1838&#150;53), were uncoloured. Although the government of Madras subscribed to a small number of copies, Wight lost money on the venture but he had the satisfaction of knowing that &#145;The Indian Flora can now, I believe, boast of being more fully illustrated than that of any other country under British sway, Great Britain alone excepted&#146;  (<span class="italic">Icones</span>, 6, 1853, v). He selected 200 plates from the <span class="italic">Icones</span>, depicting plants in the Nilgiri hills in south India, and had them coloured for his <span class="italic">Spicilegium Neilgherrense</span> (1846&#150;51) in a limited edition of 100 copies.<br>
<br>Wight remained at Coimbatore until March 1853, when he retired, taking with him nearly 10,000 specimens, representing more than 4000 species, which he presented to Kew Gardens in 1871. He then purchased Grazeley Lodge, Shinfield, near Reading in Berkshire, formerly the residence of W. Mitford the historian, and farmed the 66 acres of this property. In 1861 and 1862 he contributed articles on cotton farming to the <span class="italic">Gardeners' Chronicle</span>, and from 1865 to 1868 he gave information on medicinal uses of Indian plants to Edward John Waring's <span class="italic">Pharmacopoeia of India</span> (1868). He died at Grazeley Lodge on 26 May 1872; he was survived by his wife, four sons, and a daughter.<br>
<br>A man of exceptional energy, tenacity and industry, Wight was never daunted by the magnitude of the tasks he undertook. He was an outstanding collector who described more than 3000 species of the Indian flora, some of them new to science. His achievements are even more impressive with the limited resources at his disposal in India and the absence of any financial support. He was elected a fellow of the Linnean Society in 1832 and of the Royal Society in 1855 and is commemorated in the names of more than 120 plants (listed by R. K. Basak in <span class="italic">Taxon</span>, 30, 1981, 787&#150;8).<br>
