<span class="headword">Lloyd, Sir  Nathaniel</span>  (1669&#150;1741), <span class="occ">college head</span>, was born in the Savoy, London, on 29 November 1669, the eldest son of <a name="cosubject_16853"></a><span class="headword">Sir Richard Lloyd</span>  (<em>c.</em>1634&#150;1686), <span class="occ">judge</span>, and his wife, Elizabeth, daughter of John Jones, an apothecary. Richard Lloyd was the fourth son of the parliamentary colonel Andrew Lloyd (<i>d</i>. 1663) of Aston, Shropshire, and Margaret Powell of Whittington Park, Shropshire. Having been educated in Shrewsbury he was admitted to Gray's Inn in 1655 and became an advocate at Doctors' Commons in 1664. As a fellow of All Souls, Oxford, he proceeded BCL (1659) and DCL (1662). He was Admiralty advocate (1674&#150;85) and chancellor of the dioceses of Lichfield and of Durham. A tory and an Anglican, he sat as MP for Durham city in the parliaments of 1679&#150;81, 1681, and 1685; he was knighted on 16 January 1677. He was dean of the arches in 1684 and a judge of the high court of Admiralty in 1685&#150;6. He died on 28 June 1686 and was buried in the church of St Benet Paul's Wharf, London.<br>
<br>The eldest of eight sons, Nathaniel Lloyd was educated at St Paul's School and at Trinity College, Oxford, whence he matriculated on 9 April 1685. He was elected fellow of All Souls in 1689, graduated BCL on 22 June 1691, and proceeded DCL on 30 June 1696, in which year he was admitted a member of the College of Advocates on 21 November. He was appointed deputy Admiralty advocate, during the absence of Dr Henry Newton, on 15 November 1704 and was king's advocate from 1715 to 1727.<br>
<br>Lloyd was knighted on 29 May 1710, and in the same year was incorporated at Cambridge University and admitted, on 20 June, master of Trinity Hall; he served as vice-chancellor of the university in 1710&#150;11. Under his mastership the college chapel was remodelled and the principal court transformed by the addition of Palladian doorways, sash windows, and new dormers. Lloyd, who remained unmarried, was an aloof figure in college, and in later years lived mainly in his rooms in Doctors' Commons or in his house in Sunbury-on-Thames. He resigned as master on 1 October 1735. He died at Sunbury on 10 March 1741, and was buried on 8 April in Trinity Hall chapel, where a marble monument, bearing an inscription composed by him six years earlier, was erected in his memory. He bequeathed &pound;3000 to rebuild the hall in a classical style, and &pound;1000 to All Souls to complete the building of the Codrington Library.<br>
