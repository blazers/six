<span class="headword">Mac Con Midhe,  Giolla Brighde</span> <span class="st"> [Gilbride MacNamee]</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1272?), <span class="occ">poet</span>, was a member of a family which for more than three centuries acted as hereditary poets of the Cen&eacute;al E&oacute;ghain, the &Oacute; N&eacute;ill family, and related septs. He sprang from one of these septs, the Cen&eacute;al Mo&aacute;in, settled around Ardstraw in Tyrone, although he tells that his mother was a member of the Cen&eacute;al Conaill. The <span class="italic">Ceart U&iacute; N&eacute;ill</span>, a traditional listing of &Oacute; N&eacute;ill's tributes, places the land of Mac Con Midhe, known as &#145;the Reciter's land&#146;, at Lough U&iacute; Mhaoldubh&aacute;in, which has been identified as the modern Lough Katherine at Baronscourt. Giolla Brighde Mac Con Midhe has at times been confused with an earlier poet, Giolla Brighde Albanach (surname unknown) who addressed a number of poems to Cathal Croibhdhearg &Oacute; Conchobhair, king of Connacht (<i>d</i>. 1224), but this is now rejected as mere scribal error, based on the identity of forenames.<br>
<br>Of the twenty-one poems clearly attributable to Giolla Brighde Mac Con Midhe, the earliest dateable ones are addressed to Domhnall M&oacute;r &Oacute; Domhnaill, king of T&iacute;r Conaill (<i>d</i>. 1241), containing allusions appropriate to the period of political weakness in T&iacute;r Eoghain in the years after 1230. He also eulogized Domhnall M&oacute;r's four sons, Maoilsheachlainn, Gofraid, Aodh, and Domhnall &Oacute;g, three of whom succeeded their father in the kingship of T&iacute;r Conaill. His most famous composition, however, was an elegy of some eighty-one verses lamenting the death of Brian &Oacute; N&eacute;ill and his vassal chiefs at the battle of Down in 1260. In this composition he makes clear that he held the position of <i>ollamh</i>, or court poet, to &Oacute; N&eacute;ill, who awarded him twenty cows as the price of a poem, and a stipend of twenty cows on May day, besides presents of gold and clothing. Presumably after &Oacute; N&eacute;ill's death, Mac Con Midhe entered a similar relationship with Domhnall &Oacute;g &Oacute; Domhnaill, who ruled T&iacute;r Conaill from 1258 to 1281, and he records receiving twenty cows with their calves from this king each May day. Single compositions of his to other contemporary chiefs survive, and some formal religious poems, but most touching is his poem of supplication to God for a surviving son, all his previous children having died &#145;while they drank their first milk&#146;, a situation particularly distressing for a poet, since Irish custom demanded a more stringent monogamy from this profession than from ordinary laymen. As with many of his other poems, this supplication ends by invoking the saint &#145;Bridget, after whom I was baptized&#146;.<br>
<br>A fifteenth-century poet from the same family, Briain Ruadh Mac Con Midhe, recalled a tradition that Giolla Brighde died while his patron, Domhnall &Oacute;g &Oacute; Domhnaill, was on a plundering expedition to the Erne. &Oacute; Domhnaill is said to have raided Cen&eacute;al Mo&aacute;in on his way back, but, learning that he had met no resistance because the inhabitants were in the act of burying their celebrated poet, he returned the prey. If true, this would place Giolla Brighde Mac Con Midhe's death certainly before 1281, when Domhnall &Oacute;g himself died, and possibly in the year 1272, when the king is recorded as going on an expedition to Lough Erne and Lough Oughter.<br>
