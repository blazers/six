<span class="headword">Edward <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Grant]</span>,  Catherine</span>  (1813&#150;1861), <span class="occ">missionary</span>, was born on 2 April 1813, eldest daughter of Patrick Grant (1783&#150;1816), minister of Kirkmichael, Banffshire, and his wife, Isabella Mitchell (<i>d</i>. 1845). After her father's death Catherine was brought up in Edinburgh, where her mother supplemented her annuity by taking in boarders. As a young woman she was a governess in the family of Principal Nicoll of St Andrews, where she remained for eight years, and later for Lord William Douglas. She was with his family in Germany when the Disruption of 1843 took place. At the end of that year she went to live with her brother William, a Free Church of Scotland minister, in Ayr.<br>
<br>In 1845 Catherine and William were visited by Daniel Edward (1815&#150;1896), a Free Church missionary who had worked among the Jews of Jassy in Moldavia since 1841. Daniel knew William Grant from their college days, renewed the acquaintance, and thus met Catherine. She shared his enthusiasm for Jewish missions and they were soon engaged. He returned to Jassy that autumn and she later went out to Germany, where they married on 25 August 1846, before going on to Moldavia. The homogeneity of the Jewish community in Jassy made the missionaries' task difficult; the few converts were generally a source of disappointment. By 1848 the mission's difficulties were compounded by the threat of war and the reality of cholera. This allowed a decent withdrawal to a new field of labour, Lemberg (Lw&oacute;w) in Galicia, where the society and the surroundings were more congenial. However, it still proved impossible to establish the mission on a proper footing and in January 1852 the Austrian authorities expelled the missionaries. By this time Catherine was pregnant with the fourth of her five children and the winter journey to Breslau in Silesia proved arduous. A son was born there in March, but he did not survive and she later referred to him as her &#145;martyr boy&#146;. Although the Edwards resumed their missionary work at Breslau, Catherine's part in it was reduced. On a visit to Scotland in 1852 she was described as &#145;so changed in appearance as &hellip; to look more like her mother than herself&#146;  (<span class="italic">Missionary Life</span>, 247); her voice had weakened and her health continued to deteriorate until her death on 21 February 1861 at Breslau (where she was also buried).<br>
<br>Catherine's <span class="italic">Memoir</span> contains ample evidence of the strength of her commitment to mission work but her distaste for Jews also emerges, those in Moldavia being described as &#145;an indolent, idle population, which is likewise detested for its cunning, fraud and filth&#146;  (<span class="italic">Missionary Life</span>, 142). The disappointments and rigours of Jassy and Lemberg (Lw&oacute;w), endured during years of child bearing, took a heavy toll on her. Her later life, despite poor health, was at least accompanied by a more tolerant attitude of mind.<br>
