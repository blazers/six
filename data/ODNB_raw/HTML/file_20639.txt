<span class="headword">Hempson,  Denis</span>  (1694/5?&#150;1807), <span class="occ">harpist</span>, was the son of Brian Darragher Hempson, and was born on his father's farm at Craigmore, near Garvagh, co. Londonderry. Hempson lost his sight due to smallpox at the age of three, and at twelve began to learn the harp from Bridget O'Cahan (Br&iacute;ghid N&iacute; Chath&aacute;in), afterwards receiving instruction from John Garragher, Lochlann Fanning, and Patrick Connor, all Connaughtmen. When eighteen he lodged with the Canning family at Garvagh who, along with Squire Gage and Dr Bacon, bought him a harp. This harp was probably the one described as being made by Cormac Kelly in 1702 at Ballynascreen, co. Londonderry, of white willow, with a back of fir dug out of the bog. Hempson spent many years as an itinerant harper travelling through Ireland and Scotland, being entertained by many Scottish gentlemen. In 1745, during his second trip to Scotland, his popularity was confirmed when he played in front of Prince Charles Edward Stuart, the Young Pretender, at Holyrood.<br>
<br>Hempson subsequently travelled all over Ireland, playing in Dublin, Cork, and many other towns. Frederick Augustus Hervey, fourth earl of Bristol and bishop of Derry, bought him a house at Magilligan, where he spent the rest of his long life. Lord and Lady Bristol attended the house-warming, and their children danced to Hempson's harp. In 1781, at the reputed age of eighty-six, he married a woman (said to be lame) from Innisowen, and they had one daughter. In 1792 he attended the famous Belfast meeting of traditional harpers, where he met Edward Bunting, who transcribed much of Hempson's music and published a collection including these pieces. Hempson was a staunch traditionalist in terms of both performance technique and repertory, regarding the music of Turlough Carolan (1670&#150;1738) as too modern. He was the only harper at the Belfast meeting to play with the traditional fingernail technique, by then abandoned by most other players.<br>
<br>The intricacy of Hempson's playing was said to amaze his listeners, and his staccato and legato passages, shakes, turns, and graces were executed with ease and clarity, and he often achieved better results than more modern harpers. He had a keen sense of humour, and often interspersed his playing with humorous anecdotes. He became temperate towards the end of his life and his favourite drink, once beer, became milk and water, and his diet consisted largely of potatoes. On the day before he died, Hempson was said to have sat up in bed and played a few notes on his harp to his carer, the Revd Sir Harvey Bruce. He died at Magilligan in 1807 having, according to popular folklore, reached the age of 112.<br>
<br>Lady Morgan, in her <span class="italic">Wild Irish Girl</span>, published a letter written in 1805 from George Sampson, a Londonderry historian and protestant clergyman, which described an interview with Hempson. It is in this letter that most of his biographical information can be found. Hempson won no prizes at the harpers' meetings, nor did Arthur O'Neill mention him in his famous memoirs. Whether this is a result of rivalry, or whether O'Neill merely considered Hempson as a musical anachronism, will probably never be known.<br>
