<span class="headword">Carter <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>Barrington]</span>,  Ann</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1629), <span class="occ">protester</span>, of Maldon in Essex, was twice leader of protests over food in 1629, actions which brought her brief public notice and execution in the same year. Details of her parentage and birth, or whether she married more than once, are unknown.<br>
<br>Ann Barrington married John Carter, a Maldon butcher, on 6 December 1620. What little is known of her personal life after marriage suggests that the couple struggled to maintain a living. Rather more is on record about her public relationship with the authorities. By 1629 she had had a number of clashes with the town's rulers which reflected a willingness by her to defy authority. Questioned in 1623 as to why she was not at church, she told one of the town's rulers, &#145;yf he woold provide one to do hir worke shee would goe&#146;, adding that &#145;she searved god as well as he&#146;  (Essex RO, D/B3/3/1/19, fol. 154). A year later she prevented the arrest of her husband, cudgelling the town's serjeant-at-arms in the process.<br>
<br>In March 1629 Ann Carter was part of a large crowd of women who protested over the export of grain. Defying attempts by Maldon's authorities to stop them, the women marched to where foreign ships were loading and made the sailors pour grain into their bonnets and aprons. The women's actions reflected a belief that to allow grain to be exported when local populations faced dearth and possibly famine was both against the moral economy and government policy. As one of the women replied when asked who had prompted her to riot: &#145;the crie of the country and her own want&#146;  (Essex RO, D/B3/3/208). Maldon's authorities suspected Ann Carter of being the women's leader. Her previous history as well as her behaviour at examination (where the surviving document with its many crossings-out suggests a confidence to challenge any description of her action as either violent or illegal), certainly qualified her for the role. That she had found herself in the same month presented to the court for a minor infringement of market regulations while the town's authorities failed to stop the larger activities of foreign merchants probably increased her sense of outrage.<br>
<br>To this point, the episode reflected the protocols of early modern protest&#151;crowd restraint was matched by reform by authority&#151;and Ann Carter's actions were no different from those of other women who often predominated in crowd actions over food, exploiting the licence given them by their marginal political and legal positions and responsibility for feeding their families. But two months later Ann led a second crowd of several hundred unemployed clothworkers. This time there was no doubt about her role. She had ridden through the region, and had a local baker write letters, to summon support. Giving herself the title of Captain, she was reported to have said, &#145;Come my brave lads of Maulden, I will be your Leader, for we will not starve&#146;  (BL, Harleian MS 7000, fol. 259). Two protests in as many months challenged the convention whereby crowds expressed contrition in exchange for conciliation by the authorities. The changed context of intensifying depression in the cloth industry and the changed nature of the crowd's behaviour&#151;the protesters broke into a grain store and took away a large quantity of grain&#151;alarmed the central government which moved swiftly to punish the attack. Only a week after the riot a special judicial commission sat to execute justice. Ann Carter was found guilty and hanged the next day, 30 May 1629. This exceptional punishment&#151;she was the only woman hanged in the period for a food riot&#151;owed less to the nature of her crime than to the political instability of Charles I's government. Her husband survived her, but his frequent appearances before the town's courts confirm the family's slide into poverty and, perhaps, suggest anger at the authorities' treatment of his wife.<br>
