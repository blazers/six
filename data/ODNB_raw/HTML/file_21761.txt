<span class="headword">Peel, Sir  Lawrence</span>  (1799&#150;1884), <span class="occ">judge in India</span>, was born at Wandsworth, Surrey, on 10 August 1799, the third son of Joseph Peel (<i>d</i>. 1821), of Bowes Farm, Middlesex, and his wife, Anne, second daughter of Jonathan Haworth of Harcroft, Lancashire. His father was a younger brother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21763/', "Sir Robert Peel, first baronet (1750&#150;1830)")</script>, and so he was first cousin to <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21764/', "Sir Robert Peel, second baronet (1788&#150;1850)")</script>. He was educated at St John's College, Cambridge, matriculating in Lent 1817 and graduating BA in 1821 and MA in 1824. He was admitted at the Middle Temple on 31 October 1820 and called to the bar on 7 May 1824, went on the northern circuit, and attended the Lancaster, Preston, and Manchester sessions.<br>
<br>Peel was advocate-general at Calcutta from 1840 to 1842, and in 1842, on promotion to the chief-justiceship of the supreme court at Calcutta, was knighted by patent on 18 May. During 1854 and 1855 he was also vice-president of the legislative council at Calcutta. He resided in the suburbs, first at Cossipore and then at Garden Reach. He gave away in public charity his official income of &pound;8000 per annum. He was consequently very popular and on his retirement in November 1855 a statue of him was erected in Calcutta.<br>
<br>After his return to England, Peel was sworn of the privy council and was made a paid member of the judicial committee on 4 April 1856. He was elected a bencher of the Middle Temple on 8 May 1856 and became treasurer of his inn on 3 December 1866. From 1857 he was a director of the East India Company, and on 16 June 1858 was made an Oxford DCL. In January 1864 he became president of Guy's Hospital, London. He was president of the East India Association (1874). He was for some years a correspondent of <span class="italic">The Times</span> on legal and general topics. He wrote <span class="italic">Horae nauseae</span> (1841), poems translated and original (the latter probably juvenile), and <span class="italic">A Sketch of the Life and Character of Sir R. Peel</span> (1860). He died, unmarried, at his home, Garden Reach (named after the Calcutta suburb), Ventnor, Isle of Wight, on 22 July 1884.<br>
<br>Peel has sometimes been confused with his quasi-namesake <a name="cosubject_73765"></a><span class="headword">Laurence Peel</span>  (1801&#150;1888), sixth, youngest, and &#145;least distinguished&#146;  (Gash, 63) son of Sir Robert Peel, first baronet, who was born on 28 June 1801 and was educated at Rugby School from 1812 and at Christ Church, Oxford, where he matriculated in October 1819. Laurence Peel on 20 July 1822 married Lady Jane Lennox (<i>d</i>. 1861), daughter of the fourth duke of Richmond; they had several children. He was conservative MP for the Lowther family pocket borough of Cockermouth, Cumberland (1827&#150;30), and a secretary of the India board. He died at 32 Sussex Square, Brighton, on 10 December 1888.<br>
