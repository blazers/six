</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Wild,  Jonathan</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1683, <em>d.</em> 1725), <span class="occ">thief-taker</span>, was born in Wolverhampton, Staffordshire, and baptized on 6 May 1683. He was the eldest of five children of &#145;mean but honest Parents&#146;: his father, possibly John Wyld, was a carpenter who probably died about 1699; his mother (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1721), a fruit seller  (<span class="italic">Authentick Narrative</span>, 3). After learning to read, write, and cast accounts at the Wolverhampton charity school Wild, at about the age of fifteen, was bound apprentice to a Birmingham buckle-maker. Most accounts agree that the man who would become the greatest criminal mastermind of the eighteenth century served out his time &#145;honestly enough&#146;  (<span class="italic">Life of Jonathan Wild</span>, 2), returning about 1705 to Wolverhampton, where he married, and &#145;work[ed] very diligently for some time&#146; as a buckle-maker  (<span class="italic">True and Genuine Account</span>, 230). However, less than two years later Wild abandoned his wife and infant son and set out for London.<h2>
<a name="Marriagesandthemakingofacriminal"></a>Marriages and the making of a criminal</h2>Only a few months after his arrival Wild was arrested for debt and thrown in the Wood Street compter where, according to his own account, he was to spend &#145;above &hellip; four Years&#146;  (Wild, ii). Wild languished for a time in the common side of the prison; however, such was his &#145;Address&#146; that he soon earned the confidence of the keepers, and was not only granted the &#145;Liberty of the Gate&#146;, but was appointed &#145;Underkeeper&#146; to those &#145;disorderly Persons&#146; kept in the compter until they could be brought before a magistrate  (<span class="italic">Lives of the most Remarkable Criminals</span>, 17). Here Wild cultivated the acquaintance of prostitutes and petty criminals&#151;not least of whom was one Mary Milliner, a &#145;common Street-Walker&#146; who was to become both Jonathan's &#145;first instructor&#146; in the ways &#145;of the sharping and thieving world&#146; (<span class="italic">History of the Lives</span>, 7; <span class="italic">Select Trials</span>, 1735, 2.54; <span class="italic">True and Genuine Account</span>, 232), and the first of his many mistresses (he was reported to have had six &#145;wives&#146; altogether&#151;the last of whom, Mary Dean, he formally married in 1719, although his first wife was then still living).<br>
<br>Wild was discharged from the compter in December 1712, apparently taking advantage of a recent parliamentary act for the relief of debtors, and promptly set up house (or, according to some accounts, a brothel) with Mary Milliner in Lewkenor's Lane; several months later they moved to Cock Alley, Cripplegate. Their relationship came to an end about 1714. A liaison with Judith Nun about 1714/15 produced a daughter, born at this time. Both were said to have survived Wild. Another short-term relationship <i>c</i>.1714/15 was with Sarah Perrin, alias Gregstone or Grigson, who also survived him. There were no children of this relationship and several accounts suggest that Wild had become sterile as a result of mercury treatment for syphilis. His relationship with Elizabeth Man, or Mann, was deeper and more lasting. Wild had not lived with Nun or Perrin, but treated Man as his common law wife and lived publicly with her for perhaps four years. She died in late 1718 or early 1719 and was buried in St Pancras churchyard. Wild lost no time in mourning but went through a marriage ceremony on 13 February 1719 at St Pancras Church with Mary Dean, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Brown, widow of John &#145;Skull&#146; Dean, executed for burglary in 1717; she may have died in or before 1732. The &#145;wedding&#146; was well attended, but Howson could find no record of it, presumably because Wild had it omitted or destroyed to avoid a bigamy charge.<br>
<br>Wild's London career began while he was living with Mary Milliner. Initially he seems to have cobbled together a living from the proceeds of prostitution and from sporadic work as a bailiff's assistant; however, he soon graduated to racketeering and dealing in stolen goods. It seems he was initiated into this line of work by none other than Charles Hitchen, who had recently been suspended from the office of under city marshall after being accused of receiving and various other shady practices. Some time in the spring or summer of 1713 Hitchen, who was still empowered to act as a constable, approached Wild, asking him to accompany him as an assistant in his nightly &#145;Rambles&#146;&#151;ostensibly to reform disorderly houses, but in reality to extort protection money and to traffic in stolen goods  (Wild, 13). After Hitchen was reinstated to his office in April 1714 he and Wild &#145;fell to Loggerheads&#146; and &#145;parted &hellip; each of them separately pursuing the Business of Thief-taking&#146;  (<span class="italic">Select Trials</span>, 1735, 2.57).<h2>
<a name="Thieftakerandmaker"></a>Thief-taker and maker</h2>It was then that Wild began his career as a thief-taker and receiver in earnest. By the end of 1714 he had moved his quarters to the Little Old Bailey, where &#145;at length his House became an Office of Intelligence for lost Goods&#146;  (<span class="italic">History of the Lives</span>, 37). Skilfully evading a 1706 act which made receiving stolen property a felony Wild acted as a kind of middleman who helped the victims of theft recover their goods, but without ever keeping them in his possession. The newspapers were &#145;daily cramm'd&#146; with advertisements &#145;calling loudly out for all Sorts of strayed Valuables to be brought in to Mr. Wild's in the Old Baily, upon Promise of great Rewards and no &#147;Questions&#148;&#146;  (<span class="italic">Authentick Narrative</span>, 18). In the eyes of many contemporaries Wild performed a vital public service, especially by arranging the return of various paper notes and bills which were of little use to thieves but of great value to their owners. Initially, at least, Wild was cautious enough to refuse any fees (although he took a large cut from the thieves); and often, to cement his &#145;reputation for a mightily honest man&#146;, he would take measures to have the thieves&#151;or at least those whom he could not &#145;bring to comply&#146; with him&#151;apprehended and prosecuted  (<span class="italic">True and Genuine Account</span>, 237, 235). Thus Wild played a wily double game in which he acted both the part of a receiver and a thief-taker who earned not only &#145;public applause&#146; for bringing &#145;offenders to justice&#146;, but the rewards offered by parliament for the successful conviction of burglars and highwaymen  (ibid., 238).<br>
<br>Wild's credit soared in the spring of 1716, when he apprehended several street robbers who had murdered a gentlewoman in the course of an assault. In May 1716 he inserted an advertisement in the government newspaper, the <span class="italic">London Gazette</span>; other notices placed around the same time describing him as a man who &#145;[made] it his Business to apprehend [thieves], and bring them to Justice&#146;  (<span class="italic">Daily Courant</span>, 22 June 1716), furthered the impression that Wild was acting in a semi-official capacity. &#145;Mr. Jonathan Wild&#146; began to &#145;make a considerable Figure in the World&#146;: he began to &#145;stile himself Esquire&#146;, wore a sword, kept a carriage and footmen, and became so successful in his &#145;Business&#146;, that &#145;a vast Resort of People of all Ranks and Conditions&#146;, now flocked to his &#145;Office&#146; (<span class="italic">Weekly Journal, or, Saturday's Post</span>, 19 Jan 1718; <span class="italic">History of the Lives</span>, 14). By January 1717 Wild was openly proclaiming himself to be the &#145;Head Theif Catcher&#146;, or &#145;Thief-catcher General of Great Britain&#146; (<span class="italic">Weekly Journal, or, British Gazetteer</span>, 19 Jan 1717; <span class="italic">Weekly Journal, or, Saturday's Post</span>, 28 Feb 1719, 5).<br>
<br>In early 1718 Hitchen, evidently piqued at his old rival's success, published several pamphlets denouncing Wild as &#145;the Regulator&#146; of a vast network of thieves and fences  (Hitchen, <span class="italic">Regulator</span>, 5). Moreover, the &#145;Thief-Taker&#146; was a &#145;Thief-Maker&#146;, who &#145;pervert[ed] the good Intention &hellip; of Parliament&#146; (in granting immunity to robbers who turned evidence against two or more accomplices) by manipulating and stifling the testimony of witnesses to protect his &#145;Pensioners&#146; on the one hand, or to hang those criminals who had outlived their usefulness or defied his authority on the other  (ibid., 16). Wild promptly responded with a pamphlet of his own accusing his old &#145;Grand Master in Iniquity&#146; of being &#145;guilty of more flagrant Crimes&#146; than his former &#145;servant&#146;  (Wild, ii). Wild enumerated all &#145;of the dealings, and good Correspondence between the M[arsha]l and the Thieves&#146;  (ibid., 23), with a particular emphasis on Hitchen's attachment to &#145;his beloved Subjects, the Pickpockets&#146;  (ibid., 7&#150;8), and his intimate acquaintance with the &#145;Sodomitish Academy&#146;  (ibid., 41). (Hitchen was indeed convicted of attempted sodomy in 1727.) Wild emerged on all fronts the clear victor of this paper war: a series of exchanges printed in the weekly newspapers ended with one editor refusing to be further bullied by &#145;Tom Teltruth&#146; (Hitchen), whose &#145;Truth&#146; was now called into question (<span class="italic">Authentick Narrative</span>, 7; <span class="italic">Weekly Journal, or, Saturday's Post</span>, 12 April 1718).<h2>
<a name="TheJonathanWildActanditsaftermath"></a>The Jonathan Wild Act and its aftermath</h2>The timing, if not the wisdom, of Hitchen's attack on Wild may be explained by the fact that a clause in the 1718 <span class="roman">Transportation Act</span> would make it a felony to accept a reward for recovering stolen goods without attempting to prosecute the thief. Many have seen this legislation as directly aimed at Wild: indeed, the City recorder, Sir William Thomson, the principal architect of this act, had begun to look askance at Wild. Several accounts claimed that in 1718 Thomson had taken Wild aside to warn him &#145;against going any longer at his old Rate&#146; now that it had &#145;become a capital crime&#146;  (<span class="italic">Lives of the most Remarkable Criminals</span>, 46). However, all the evidence suggests that Wild, far from heeding this caution, &#145;went on in his wicked trade &hellip; with more impudence and shameless boldness than ever&#146;  (<span class="italic">True and Genuine Account</span>, 251).<br>
<br>This raises the question of why, for nearly seven years after the passage of the so-called <span class="roman">Jonathan Wild Act</span>, Wild not only continued but flourished in his trade of receiver&#150;thief-taker. This has often been explained in terms of the corruption of early eighteenth-century society in general and the system of private prosecution in particular: contemporaries and later commentators alike saw Wild as &#145;in league with several trading justices&#146; as venal as himself  (Place MSS, fol. 13), while Gerald Howson, Wild's modern biographer, has suggested that even such high-ranking City officials as Thomson long turned a blind eye to the thief-taker's double-dealing. It is possible that after Wild's and Hitchen's paper war the authorities were unwilling to further expose the degree to which they themselves were implicated in questionable activities, although it is more likely that, as &#145;Philanthropos&#146; (Bernard Mandeville) implied, magistrates &#145;made use of [Wild] for an Evidence&#146;, and were &#145;beholden to him in the Administration of Justice&#146;, simply because in a period of mounting anxiety about violent crime and gang activity he was viewed as a necessary evil  (<span class="italic">British Journal</span>, 27 Feb 1725).<br>
<br>Perhaps, after 1718, to &#145;support his Credit with the Magistrates&#146; and to divert attention away from his effective role as a receiver, perhaps simply because he had become hardened by his success, Wild focused more and more on the very public business of gang breaking and thief-taking (<span class="italic">Lives of the most Remarkable Criminals</span>, 2.46; <span class="italic">True and Genuine Account</span>, 237). This was, moreover, a business which became more lucrative after a 1720 royal proclamation offered rewards of &pound;100 (over and above those granted by parliament) for the successful conviction of robbers in the vicinity of London. Wild became a fixture at the Old Bailey and other criminal courts where &#145;scarce an Assize or Sessions past but Jonathan slew his Man&#146;&#151;appeared as an evidence for the prosecution  (<span class="italic">Authentick Narrative</span>, 7). Wild's divide and conquer tactics began to elicit complaints from defendants&#151;one of whom in 1723 loudly descried Wild as a villain who &#145;gets his Livelihood by &hellip; swear[ing] away honest Men's Lives&#146;  (<span class="italic">Select Trials</span>, 1742, 1.345).<br>
<br>Public opinion turned sharply against Wild in the autumn of 1724 with his involvement in the arrest and prosecution of two of the most famous criminals of the day&#151;Jack Sheppard and his accomplice Joseph &#145;Blueskin&#146; Blake. The press championed Sheppard's cause, casting him as a kind of underdog hero who had resisted having any dealings with Wild and employing him as a mouthpiece to denounce &#145;the Scandalous Practice of Theif-catching&#146;  (<span class="italic">Narrative of the Robberies</span>, 164). Conversely, Blueskin served as an example of one of the many &#145;foster children&#146; whom Wild &#145;had [bred] &hellip; up to be thieves&#146; and later brought to the gallows  (<span class="italic">True and Genuine Account</span>, 252). On 14 October, while Blueskin was awaiting trial, Wild casually informed him that he could do nothing for him short of paying for his coffin; enraged, Blake fell on the thief-taker and slit his throat with a clasp-knife. While Wild survived the wound his reputation was not so easily salvaged: the <span class="italic">Newgate's Garland</span> ballad, prematurely celebrating Jonathan's demise, broadcasted the &#145;Good News&#146; that &#145;Honester poor Rogues&#146; could, like their betters, now rob with impunity.<h2>
<a name="Trialexecutionandreputation"></a>Trial, execution, and reputation</h2>The Blueskin incident &#145;made People a little more inquisitive into [Wild's] Honesty&#146;; indeed, it would seem that Jonathan had now become so notorious that the authorities found &#145;themselves obliged &hellip; to take Notice of Him&#146; (H. D., iv; <span class="italic">Lives of the most Remarkable Criminals</span>, 2.50). On 15 February 1725 Wild was arrested for assisting one of his henchmen, Roger Johnson, &#145;to make his Escape from a Constable&#146;  (<span class="italic">Select Trials</span>, 1735, 2.44). Wild was held on a warrant of detainer, consisting of eleven articles accusing him of, among other things, being both a receiver and a confederate of thieves; of having &#145;form'd a kind of Corporation of Thieves&#146;; and of having &#145;often sold human blood, by procuring false Evidence&#146;  (ibid., 2.44&#150;5). There was as yet no precise charge against Wild, and it seems that the authorities were still casting about for prosecution witnesses when on 10 March Wild &#145;saved them that Trouble by committing a Felony while &hellip; in Newgate&#146;  (<span class="italic">Select Trials</span>, 1742, 2.206): he had accepted 10 guineas for returning some stolen lace to one Mrs Statham without attempting to prosecute the thieves (who had, in any case, committed the robbery on his instructions). On 15 May 1725 Wild was tried at the Old Bailey for &#145;privately stealing&#146; the lace, and for &#145;helping&#146; Statham &#145;to the said Lace&#146; for a reward  (<span class="italic">Select Trials</span>, 1735, 2.46). In a vain attempt to influence the jurors Wild &#145;dispers'd&#146; a list of names of seventy-five &#145;Persons&#146; he had &#145;discover'd, apprehended and convicted&#146; to the courtroom (a modest estimate; some contemporaries put the figure as high as 120; ibid., 2.46). Neither this, nor all the art employed by Wild's counsel in the course of his four-hour trial, could save him; although acquitted of the theft he was convicted of the second indictment&#151;a charge made capital by the clause of the 1718 act supposedly drafted with him in mind&#151;and sentenced to hang.<br>
<br>After conviction &#145;Jonathan's Cunning and Courage forsook him&#146;; he refused even to attend chapel for fear of being &#145;insult[ed]&#146;, or worse, by enemies  (<span class="italic">Select Trials</span>, 1735, 2.108, 111). Wild appeared &#145;disorder'd&#146; and almost stupefied, complaining that &#145;he thought he deserved well&#146; for having &#145;regain'd Things of great Value for Dukes, Earls and Lords&#146; and for his strenuous efforts to apprehend &#145;the greatest and most pernicious Robbers&#146;, which had left his body covered with &#145;Wounds and Scars&#146;  (ibid., 110&#150;11). The night before his execution Wild attempted to commit suicide by taking a large dose of laudanum&#151;so large, in fact, that he &#145;vomited it up in a great measure, and liv'd to be hang'd&#146;  (<span class="italic">Evening Post</span>, 25 May 1725).<br>
<br>On 24 May 1725 Wild, still &#145;almost insensible&#146; from the effects of the drug, embarked on what would prove to be an arduous journey to Tyburn. A &#145;numerous Crowd&#146; of hostile spectators greeted him with triumphant jeers&#151;some, according to one account, &#145;calling out <i>Blewskin</i>, &amp;c&#146;&#151;and pelted him so violently with stones that &#145;Blood flew from him plentifully&#146; (<span class="italic">Mist's Weekly Journal</span>, 29 May 1725; <span class="italic">Parker's Penny Post</span>, 26 May 1725). At the place of execution Wild was hastily turned off after it became clear that the mob would brook no delays. Such was Wild's unpopularity that &#145;the Noisy Multitude&#146; only &#145;acquiesc'd&#146; in allowing his body to be carried off in a coach after it was &#145;given out that it was design'd for the Surgeons&#146; (<span class="italic">London Journal</span>, 29 May 1725; <span class="italic">Evening Post</span>, 25 May 1725). Wild had desired to be buried next to Elizabeth Man and was quietly interred late the following night at St Pancras churchyard, but early in the next month his body was &#145;dug up from the grave and carried off&#146; by persons unknown  (<span class="italic">Original Weekly Journal</span>, 5 June 1725). Many years later a skeleton believed to be Wild's resurfaced and was eventually donated to the Royal College of Surgeons in 1847.<br>
<br>If Wild's remains belonged to posterity, his name had long been the property of satirists and pamphleteers. As Peachum in John Gay's <span class="italic">Beggar's Opera</span> (1728), or Henry Fielding's <span class="italic">Jonathan Wild the Great</span> (1743), Wild&#151;and by analogy, his counterpart in high life, Robert Walpole&#151;had become a byword for hypocrisy and corruption in high places, an illustration of the old dictum that great rogues prosper while little rogues hang. In Harrison Ainsworth's <span class="italic">Jack Sheppard</span> (1839), Wild was resurrected as Sheppard's evil nemesis and the embodiment of the corruption and brutality of a bygone age. The real Jonathan Wild, however, rivals any of his fictional incarnations: there were thief-takers before and after Wild, but none of them, as Mandeville pointed out, reigned &#145;with such an absolute Sway, or so long and successfully as himself&#146;, or &#145;was ever more universally known in his Occupation&#146;  (<span class="italic">British Journal</span>, 17 April 1725). Those who wish to learn more about this Jonathan Wild are referred to Gerald Howson's excellent biography, <span class="italic">Thief-Taker General: the Rise and Fall of Jonathan Wild</span> (1970).<br>
