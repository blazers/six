<span class="headword">Rowse,  Herbert James</span>  (1887&#150;1963), <span class="occ">architect</span>, was born on 10 May 1887 at 15 Melling Road, Walton, Lancaster, the son of James William Rowse, foreman builder, and his wife, Sarah Ann, formerly Cammack. After local pupillage, in 1905 he entered the school of architecture at Liverpool University, where Charles Reilly had just been appointed Roscoe professor. Rowse gained a first-class certificate in 1907 and was joint winner of the Holt travelling scholarship, which took him to Italy and started a lifelong interest in Italian Romanesque and Renaissance architecture, and yielded a set of measured drawings which won an honourable mention in the silver medal competition of the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA) in 1910. He became an associate of the RIBA in 1910 while employed as an assistant to Frank Simon, who in 1912 won the competition for the Manitoba parliament building. Rowse worked in Simon's Winnipeg office in 1913. He also travelled extensively throughout North America and worked briefly in Chicago and New York. He then returned to Liverpool, where he opened his own practice in July 1914. During the First World War he worked for the Admiralty designing &#145;purely functional buildings&#146;. On 29 July 1918 he married Dorothy (<i>b</i>. 1892/3), daughter of Thomas Parry of Crosby, and relaunched his practice with a commission for the Fairrie sugar refinery in Liverpool.<br>
<br>Rowse's competition-winning design for the Liverpool shipping office (the India Buildings) in 1924 was the first among a series of large-scale commercial commissions in the city, often carried out in partnership with other individuals or firms; these included Martins Bank (1927&#150;32), Lloyds Bank (1928&#150;32), and the Bibby Shipping Line offices (1930). The Lloyds Bank branch in Church Street was in Italian Romanesque, while for bigger buildings Rowse used a rich, eclectic classicism, often with a distinct transatlantic flavour. In 1931 he was appointed consultant to the Mersey tunnel authority, and designed the tunnel approaches, arched entrances, and ventilation towers. The largest tower, the Woodside Tower, housed the tunnel authority offices, and was a distinguished addition to the group of tall buildings at Liverpool's pierhead; it won Rowse the 1937 RIBA bronze medal. His tunnel authority schemes featured low-relief sculpture and art deco work, leaning towards the stripped classical style favoured by both European totalitarian regimes and American New Deal designers. At this time Rowse was working closely with Tyson Smith, Liverpool's leading modern sculptor. The Philharmonic Concert Hall (1936&#150;9), with its simplified brick massing and its restrained decoration, was much closer to mainstream European modernism, and is apparently inspired by W. M. Dudok. It was this approach which informed his designs for the British pavilion at the Empire Exhibition, Glasgow (1938), the Pharmaceutical Society headquarters in Brunswick Square, London (1937), and the Pilkington Glass Company offices in St Helens, Lancashire (1938&#150;9).<br>
<br>War again frustrated Rowse's professional career just when he was beginning to win substantial commissions outside Merseyside, and had purchased 1000 acres in Anglesey, where he planned to improve the estate's buildings and to modernize its husbandry. Whether he then planned to retire is unclear. Rowse served as sheriff for Anglesey during the war, and in 1947 completed the Pharmaceutical Society building (now London University's pharmacy school). In 1947 he secured the Woodchurch 2500 cottage housing scheme, in Birkenhead, upstaging his mentor Professor Sir Charles Reilly with a scheme &#145;traditionally English in character &hellip; modified to suit contemporary limitations and resources&#146;. Woodchurch was one of the biggest regional projects in the era of post-war austerity, and won Rowse a bronze medal for housing from the Ministry of Health. However, the architect resigned before completion, following a dispute with the client. Rowse designed diplomatic buildings at Delhi and Karachi in 1951. He also advised the Belgians on post-war reconstruction, and was awarded the order of Leopold II in 1950. However, he took no further recorded part in British practice until he won the competition for the renovation of the &#145;Rows&#146; in Chester (with Thomas Harker) just before his death at his home, Chapel House, Puddington, Cheshire, on 22 March 1963. His wife survived him. Temperamentally, Rowse was a perfectionist with meticulous attention to detail, persuading his clients to invest in the finest materials. He worked long hours and set himself high standards, demanding the same of his staff. Donald Bradshaw, writing Rowse's obituary, noted that he was fond of saying &#145;Never present an alternative; it shows that you have not solved your problem&#146;  (<span class="italic">RIBA Journal</span>).<br>
