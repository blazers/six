<span class="headword">Lyons,  Richard</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1381), <span class="occ">merchant and financier</span>, was of unknown origins, though it is possible that he was a Fleming who settled in London. It is likely that he was also illegitimate, and this may help explain alike the lack of family information, his apparent failure to marry into an established London family, and his slow acceptance into the ranks of the ruling classes of London. There appear to have been no children of his marriage to Isabella Pledour, from whom he was divorced in 1363.<br>
<br>Lyons had by then become a very wealthy vintner and shipowner. At the time of his divorce his property, revenues, and goods in London alone were valued at &pound;2443, and his wife claimed 5000 marks (&pound;3333. 6<i>s</i>. 8<i>d</i>.) as her share of his total wealth. Lyons dealt in wine, wool, cloth, iron, and lead. Not surprisingly, with an apparently Flemish background, he had considerable business interests in Flanders and was heavily involved in overseas trade, travelling abroad with three servants in 1368. Although probably resident in London from the 1340s, it was not until 1359 that he first purchased property in the city. Similarly, although an active London tradesman in the 1340s, it was not until the later 1350s that he became accepted into the London merchant community. After 1359 Lyons emerged as a leading city merchant and became increasingly involved in city politics and government, though it was not until 1374 that he was appointed both alderman (of Broad Street ward) and sheriff. Like many other fourteenth-century London merchants Lyons sought wealth in the city but gentry status in the countryside by purchasing property outside London. In 1364 he bought his first extra-mural property, in Essex, and his assumption of gentry status and a decline of interest in London gradually followed. In 1380 he represented Essex in parliament, and during the peasants' revolt in 1381 his manor of Overhall at Liston in Suffolk was a target for attack. At his death he held lands in Essex, Kent, Suffolk, Surrey, Sussex, Middlesex, and Hertfordshire, as well as London property which included a large house adjoining the Guildhall of the merchants of the Hanse of Germany in Thames Street, and other property situated in Cosyn Lane in the Ropery.<br>
<br>Lyons was closely involved with John Pecche (<i>d</i>. 1380) and Adam Bury, both leading London merchants, engaged in the exercise of the sweet wine monopoly. The latter was granted to Pecche by the crown in November 1373, when Bury was mayor of London. Under this monopoly only three taverns in London were allowed to sell sweet wines; all of them had been leased by Lyons from the city during Bury's first mayoralty in 1365. In 1376 all three Londoners were impeached on various charges of corruption by the Good Parliament, which also brought a number of other accusations against Lyons alone, including the misuse of his position as collector of the wool subsidy and member of the king's council to avoid exporting his wool via the staple at Calais; the appropriation for himself of customs duties that had not been sanctioned by parliament; the charging of usurious levels of interest on loans to the crown; and the purchase of royal debts owed to others at a fraction of their worth but obtaining full repayment of them at the exchequer. He was found guilty of these charges and imprisoned, his property was seized in June, and he was dismissed from his aldermanry in August. Although he was pardoned by the crown in March 1377, he was never restored to office in London.<br>
<br>Lyons had been closely linked to the crown as a financier and adviser. He lent sums to the crown himself, but mainly acted as a middleman on behalf of the crown during the 1370s to arrange loans from denizen and alien merchants in London and to secure the payment of royal debts. Undoubtedly his involvement with the crown gave him influence; in June 1375, for example, he obtained the king's consent to the release of Thomas Gisors, a London merchant, from prison, together with royal protection against his creditors while he was conducting his business, so as to enable Gisors to raise money to repay his debts. Lyons held a number of royal appointments, including a commission to investigate an attack on three Portuguese merchant ships in 1371. He was keeper of the king's moneys at the Tower of London in 1375, and collector of the petty customs in 1373 and of customs and subsidies in 1375.<br>
<br>Lyons was killed in Cheapside during the peasants' revolt on 14 June 1381. Froissart suggests that Lyons was killed as an act of revenge for some much earlier slight to Wat Tyler, the leader of the rebels, who had been his servant or apprentice. But the chronicler Knighton, perhaps more plausibly, connects Lyons's death with his lasting unpopularity from the days when he had been convicted of extortion and fraud. Lyons was buried in the church of St Martin Vintry, London, where according to Stow there was an impressive effigy of him.<br>
