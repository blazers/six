<span class="headword">Hodgkinson,  George Edward</span>  (1893&#150;1986), <span class="occ">local politician</span>, was born on 9 August 1893 at 21 Villa Street, Beeston, the eldest of four sons born to Walter Hodgkinson (1872&#150;<i>c</i>.1943), a lace-making-machine minder, and his wife, Charlotte Wormell (1876&#150;1907). He attended Nether Street elementary school in Beeston until he was thirteen. After several jobs with engineering firms he enrolled for evening classes at Nottingham University and completed his engineering education at the Harris Institute in Preston. He was much influenced by the harsh working conditions he witnessed, and in 1913 he joined the Independent Labour Party and the Amalgamated Society of Engineers on the same day.<br>
<br>In September 1914 Hodgkinson moved to Coventry, where he worked as a turner. On 26 December that year he married (Victoria) May Smith (1892/3&#150;1925), daughter of Herbert Smith, waggon examiner. By 1915 he had become the leading shop steward at the Radford Daimler factory. In 1919 he was nominated for a place at Ruskin College, Oxford. His experiences there are vividly recorded in his surviving correspondence with his first wife. He returned to Coventry in 1920 to find his reputation as a shop steward had preceded him. He was often victimized, and, with a young family to support, he was driven to seeking poor relief before regaining employment with Daimler in January 1923.<br>
<br>In October 1923 Hodgkinson began work as the full-time Coventry Labour Party agent. His dynamism helped transform the local party: the debt of &pound;240 was cleared, women's sections were established, and the membership increased significantly. In 1936 Richard Crossman became the local Labour candidate. Crossman and Hodgkinson became close friends: Hodgkinson admired Crossman's intellect and energy, while Crossman learned much from Hodgkinson's expertise in party management. After the death of his first wife in 1925, Hodgkinson married, on 7 May 1927, Carrie Wilson (1895/6&#150;1997), a tailor, daughter of Thomas Arthur Wilson, iron polisher.<br>
<br>Hodgkinson's career in local government began in 1928 when he won the Radford ward. Nine years later, the Labour Party won control of Coventry council for the first time. He led the council for a year before making way for Sidney Stringer; between them, they dominated the Labour group. Hodgkinson played a pivotal role in co-ordinating the local response to the devastation caused by the German air raid on Coventry in November 1940. He was instrumental in restoring gas supplies and in establishing communal restaurants. After the war his enthusiasm for the bold changes envisaged by the city architect, Donald Gibson, helped persuade his fellow councillors to accept them. He was mayor of Coventry in 1944&#150;5 and, as his membership of strategic committees continued unabated throughout the 1940s and 1950s, he played a major role in Coventry's post-war development. His hopes of a parliamentary seat were, however, dashed in 1945 when the Labour Party vetoed his nomination on the grounds that he was a paid official. In 1949 he was appointed OBE.<br>
<br>Though Coventry council achieved much in the post-war period, there was a feeling that the local Labour Party was increasingly out of touch with the social trends of the 1950s. Hodgkinson's public pronouncements sometimes betrayed a hint of puritanism which sat uneasily with the prevailing mood of an age of increasing affluence. Although his ability to express his political views was circumscribed by his being a party agent, a position he finally relinquished in 1958, there is no doubt that his sympathies were with the left.<br>
<br>Hodgkinson was a frequent visitor to eastern Europe after the war and deplored what he considered to be the crude distinctions made between the eastern bloc and western Europe. In 1967 he lost his council seat when Labour was swept from power in Coventry. His autobiography, written at Crossman's insistence, was published in 1970 and he continued to live an active life thereafter, particularly as a campaigner for international understanding. He was a genial, sincere man: a near teetotaller, he lived in a council house on principle until his death. He was an accomplished fisherman, who competed in the 1936 All England championships. His life was an epitome of dedication to the labour movement and its ideals. He died on arrival at Coventry and Warwickshire Hospital on 19 August 1986 as a result of a heart attack while at the wheel of his car; his body was cremated at Canley crematorium. He was survived by his wife, a daughter from his first marriage, and a son from his second.<br>
