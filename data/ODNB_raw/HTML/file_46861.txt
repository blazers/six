<span class="headword">Owen, Sir  Hugo  von Reitzenstein Cunliffe-</span>, first baronet  (1870&#150;1947), <span class="occ">tobacco industrialist</span>, was born at Kensington on 16 August 1870, the fourth and youngest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20997/', "Sir Francis Philip Cunliffe-Owen (1828&#150;1894)")</script>, of Lowestoft, sometime secretary of the Colonial Institute and director of the Victoria and Albert Museum, and his wife, Jenny (<i>d</i>. 1894), eldest daughter of Baron Fritz von Reitzenstein, aide-de-camp to King Friedrich Wilhelm IV of Prussia. He was educated at Clifton College for a few months in 1885, and at Brighton College. He was then articled to the civil engineer John Wolfe Barry in London.<br>
<br>In 1886 the second of his six sisters married Henry Herbert Wills, who in the 1890s recruited Cunliffe-Owen to assist him at the Virginia Cavendish works of his family's tobacco business, W. D. and H. O. Wills. He later worked in the Wills export department, and was sent as an emissary to the USA after James Buchanan Duke initiated the American Tobacco Company's attack on British markets. The Wills family retaliated by leading the formation of the Imperial Tobacco Company, and in 1902 negotiated a truce: world tobacco markets were divided by agreement and the joint British American Tobacco (BAT) Company was formed. Cunliffe-Owen was appointed as secretary of BAT, with a seat on its board, in 1902. Thereafter, he made frequent visits to the United States. He succeeded Duke as chairman of BAT in 1923, when its world sales amounted to 50,000 million cigarettes annually. He was an autocratic, self-reliant, and bold capitalist who centralized control and inculcated a strong company culture. His strategies and risks were often vindicated by events. His decision to cut profit margins in order to secure higher sales volumes was crucially successful. So too was his insistence on entering the American market by purchasing the North Carolina based Brown and Williamson Tobacco Company in 1927. The USA accounted for 13 per cent of BAT's total sales by 1939. One of BAT's main markets was China, which Cunliffe-Owen first visited in 1904; he maintained contacts with several Chinese politicians and financiers. He retired as chairman of BAT in 1945, retaining the honorific title of president until his death.<br>
<br>Cunliffe-Owen was a director of the Midland Bank from 1925, and in 1928 recruited its chairman, Reginald McKenna (1863&#150;1943), to serve as chairman of the Tobacco Securities Trust, which he formed to buy and hold shares in associated and subsidiary companies of BAT, and to act as his own investment operation. An early deal was to buy control of Boots, the retail chemist chain, from the American combine Drug Inc. in 1933; an attempt to corner the British pepper market in 1934 was, however, an expensive failure. Cunliffe-Owen's American contacts were an important component in his success. He was also a director of Eagle Star Insurance from 1941.<br>
<br>His knowledge of the Orient led his friend Lord Beaverbrook to appoint him as controller of eastern propaganda at the Ministry of Information in 1918; he received a baronetcy in 1920, ostensibly for his wartime services. This friendship also led him to serve as a director of Beaverbrook's Colonial Bank in 1917&#150;19, and of Provincial Cinematographic Theatres in 1920&#150;21. He was later treasurer of Beaverbrook's Empire Crusade (to which he donated &pound;5000 in 1930). His opinions on fiscal matters were summarized in his pamphlet, <span class="italic">Industry and the Empire Crusade: a Statement to Manufacturers</span> (1930).<br>
<br>In the late 1930s Cunliffe-Owen bought the British manufacturing rights of the American twin-engined Burnelli aircraft, and set up the Cunliffe-Owen Aircraft Company at Eastleigh, near Southampton. It undertook government contracts during the Second World War, and in peacetime developed a fourteen-seater passenger aircraft called the Concordia. Production was suspended in November 1947 after it became clear that there was no possibility of sales of the Concordia in sufficient numbers. The company was wound up after his death a month later.<br>
<br>Cunliffe-Owen was plutocratic in his friendships and interests. His horses won the Derby in 1928 and the One Thousand Guineas and the Oaks in 1938. He kept a yacht, and was attracted to pretty young women. There were unsubstantiated stories of an early first marriage. In Massachusetts in 1918 he married Helen Elizabeth (1896&#150;1934), daughter of James Oliver of New York. They had two daughters and two sons, of whom the eldest (his namesake) was killed in action in 1942. He married in 1935 Mauricia Martha, daughter of Herbert Shaw of San Francisco, but was judicially separated from her in 1946. He was by then devoted to a dancer called Marjorie Daw, who changed her surname to Cunliffe-Owen in 1947; three weeks later he made a will leaving her half of his fortune. Nineteen days afterwards, on 14 December 1947, he died of heart failure at his house, Sunningdale Park, near Ascot, his estate being sworn at &pound;1,353,744 gross. His funeral was at Sunningdale parish church on 17 December.<br>
