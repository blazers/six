<span class="headword">Stone,  (Alan) Reynolds</span>  (1909&#150;1979), <span class="occ">engraver and letter cutter</span>, was born at Eton College, Buckinghamshire, on 13 March 1909, the eldest of the three children and the only son of Edward Wellington Stone (1867&#150;1936), an Eton housemaster, and his wife, Laura Neville (1872&#150;1925), the daughter of J. E. Bovill, a corn merchant of Dorking. His mother had studied drawing under the painter and Slade professor of fine art Henry Tonks. His father's sister married the writer Compton Mackenzie. Stone was educated first at Eton and then at Magdalene College, Cambridge, where he read history, in which he obtained second classes (second division) in both parts of the historical tripos (1929 and 1930).<br>
<br>Stone began work at the Cambridge University Press under a scheme inaugurated by Walter Lewis, the university printer, for the training of graduate apprentices. It was here that he began his first experiments as an engraver, first on pieces of type metal and later on boxwood. Two great influences of this period were F. G. Nobbs, the press overseer, and the work of Stanley Morison, at that time typographical adviser to the Cambridge University Press. Morison was in part responsible for the revival of interest in classical letter forms and had edited three volumes of <span class="italic">Fleuron</span>, a typographical periodical, which Stone read at Cambridge. In 1932 he spent a formative fortnight at Pigotts, the home and workplace of the master craftsman and engraver Eric Gill, who had such a profound effect on modern typography and design. Stone found the atmosphere of worship and work at Gill's too powerful; he felt a need to make his own way.<br>
<br>In 1932 Stone moved to Taunton to work for the printers Barnicott and Pearce. It was there that he produced some of his first engraved designs, including his first book-plate for Armide Opp&eacute;. Two years later he left to pursue his own career as a freelance engraver and designer, and exhibited book-plates at the <span class="italic">Sunday Times</span> book exhibition, where he first attracted critical attention.<br>
<br>Until the Second World War, Stone worked on numerous book-plate designs, armorial devices, and illustrations. Notable books he illustrated include <span class="italic">The Shakespeare Anthology</span> (Nonesuch Press, 1935), <span class="italic">The Praise and Happinesse of the Countrie Life</span> (Gregynog Press, 1938), and <span class="italic">The Confessions of J. J. Rousseau</span> (Nonesuch Press, 1938).<br>
<br>In 1938 Stone married <a href="#cosubject_69288">Janet Woods [<i>see below</i>]</a>, with whom he had two sons and two daughters. They moved to Bracken Cottage, Bucklebury, Berkshire. In 1939 he taught himself to cut letters in stone, and his mastery of this form led to various important commissions, such as the memorials to Alfred Duff Cooper, Viscount Norwich (1955), Sir Winston Churchill (Westminster Abbey, 1965), T. S. Eliot (Westminster Abbey, 1966), and Lord Britten (Aldeburgh, 1977).<br>
<br>During the war Stone worked with the RAF in photo interpretation, but still produced engraved designs. The post-war period saw some of his finest work, including illustrations for Adrian Bell's <span class="italic">The Open Air</span> (1936 and 1949) and designs for <span class="italic">Breviarium Romanum</span> (1946), commissioned by Stanley Morison. He also engraved devices for <span class="italic">The Times</span>, notably the masthead, introduced in 1951.<br>
<br>Stone moved with his family to Dorset in 1953 to the Old Rectory, Litton Cheney, Dorchester, where he lived for the rest of his life. In 1955 he designed the coat of arms for Her Majesty's Stationery Office and in 1963&#150;4 the &pound;5 and &pound;10 notes for the Bank of England (using his daughter Phillida as the model for Britannia); she subsequently married the documentary film-maker <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/94329/', "Jonathan Francesc Gili")</script>. Stone contributed the article on Gwendolen Raverat to the <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span>. He always painted, often using his watercolours as starting points for engravings. The wilderness of his large wooded garden with its stream and ponds was a constant source of inspiration. He had one-man exhibitions at the Aldeburgh Festival (1958), the Arts Council (1959), Agnews (1965 and 1969), and the New Grafton Gallery (1972, 1975, and 1978). Stylistically he was a descendant of the engraver Thomas Bewick (1753&#150;1828) and, in lettering, of the Renaissance calligraphic masters. He achieved near perfection with his engraved alphabets and roman capitals on wood and stone. He was appointed CBE in 1953 and a royal designer for industry in 1956, and in 1964 was elected a fellow of the Royal Society of Arts.<br>
<br>Stone was a man of quiet charm and humour whose friendship was greatly valued. He died, following a stroke, on 23 June 1979 in Dorchester, Dorset.<br>
<br>Stone's wife, <a name="cosubject_69288"></a><span class="headword">Janet Clemence Stone <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Woods]</span></span>  (1912&#150;1998), <span class="occ">photographer and hostess</span>, was born on 1 December 1912 at Cromer, Norfolk, the fourth of the six children of Edward Sydney Woods (1877&#150;1953), bishop of Lichfield, and his wife, Clemence Rachel, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Barclay (1874&#150;1952). Two of her brothers became bishops. Educated at the Perse School for Girls, Cambridge, a finishing school in Lausanne, and the Royal College of Music, she started a singing career as a soprano but ended it after marriage. She became a notable hostess, entertaining at Litton Cheney leading writers, painters, and intellectuals including John Betjeman, J. B. Priestley, Benjamin Britten, Kenneth Clark, Henry Moore, Iris Murdoch, and John Bayley; she and her husband were particularly close to Murdoch and Bayley. She often photographed her guests (she also undertook commissions for books and magazines), and at Murdoch's suggestion, published some of her portraits in <span class="italic">Thinking Faces</span> (1988). After Stone's death she moved to Salisbury, Wiltshire, where she died on 30 January 1998, survived by her four children. Some of her portraits are in the National Portrait Gallery.<br>
