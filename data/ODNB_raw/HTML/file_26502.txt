<span class="headword">Stewart,  Robert</span>, first duke of Albany  (<em>c.</em>1340&#150;1420), <span class="occ">prince and governor of Scotland</span>, was the third son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/23713/', "Robert II (1316&#150;1390)")</script>, son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26511/', "Walter Stewart")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/49411/', "Stewart family (per. c.1110&#150;c.1350)")</script>], and his first wife, Elizabeth Mure (<i>d</i>. before 1355), daughter of Adam Mure of Rowallan. The younger Robert was probably born about 1340, since he was described as an octogenarian when he died. His parents were not in a canonically legitimate marriage at the time of his birth. It was only in 1347 that the elder Robert sought a retrospective papal legitimation for the children born of his relationship with Elizabeth, and the couple's formal marriage ceremony may not have occurred until 1349. In 1361 the younger Robert found a prestigious and lucrative wife in Margaret Graham, countess of Menteith in her own right, the papal dispensation for the union being obtained on 9 September of that year. The marriage was certainly completed before 14 May 1363, when Robert was styled &#145;of Menteith&#146;.<h2>
<a name="EarlofFife"></a>Earl of Fife</h2>On 22 February 1371 David II died, and his nephew, Robert's father, hereditary steward of Scotland, succeeded to the throne as Robert II. As a member of the new royal dynasty Robert, who soon became tenth earl of Menteith, was the beneficiary of considerable patronage in the years after 1371. One of the most significant gains he made, however, came as the result of a deal he concluded on 30 March 1371 with Isabel, countess of Fife. By the terms of the arrangement the childless countess recognized Robert as her heir in the earldom of Fife in accordance with an agreement made in 1315 between Isabel's father, Duncan, earl of Fife, and Robert I. The transaction of 1315 had stipulated that on the failure of Duncan's legitimate heirs the earldom of Fife was to go to Robert I and the king's lawful heirs, although it was also stated that the earldom could not be held directly by the king because the earl of Fife played a key role in the enthronement of Scottish monarchs. If Robert I died without a lawful heir to whom the earldom could be assigned, then it was to revert to Earl Duncan's heir Allan, son of Allan, earl of Menteith. Robert fulfilled all the conditions of the 1315 indenture, being both the third son of Robert II, Robert I's grandson and heir, and also the husband of Margaret, countess of Menteith, the grandniece and heir of the Allan of Menteith named in the agreement. Unfortunately, in 1370 Isabel had been persuaded to resign her rights of lordship over Fife to John Dunbar, a favourite of David II. Dunbar contested Robert's claims to the earldom of Fife for a year after the arrangement of March 1371. Finally, during a parliament of March 1372, and certainly before 8 April 1372, Robert became twelfth earl of Fife following a settlement with John Dunbar, which saw Dunbar compensated with a grant of the northern earldom of Moray.<br>
<br>Fife played a leading role in his father's administration of the realm after 1371, becoming a regular witness to royal charters and on 7 February 1373 receiving a grant of the hereditary constableship of Stirling Castle. On 4 April 1373 his position in the royal succession was confirmed when a parliament at Scone approved the creation of a male entail to govern the descent of the kingship, naming the five sons of Robert II with his first and second wives in order of seniority. The heir to the throne, Fife's elder brother, John, earl of Carrick (the future <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/23714/', "Robert III")</script>), had no son in 1373, while Fife's marriage to Margaret Graham had produced a male heir, Murdoch. From 1373 until the birth of Carrick's eldest son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26468/', "David Stewart")</script>, in 1378 Fife and his son were second and third in line to the throne. Fife's importance in central government was also reflected in his appointment as chamberlain, the chief financial officer of the crown, after the assassination of the previous office-holder, Sir John Lyon, on 4 November 1382. Robert II may have chosen Fife for this post to set up a powerful counter-weight inside the royal administration to the influence of the king's eldest son, Carrick. Lyon's assassin, Sir James Lindsay of Crawford, was a member of Carrick's affinity. Fife was to hold the chamberlainship until 12 March 1407, when it was granted to his son John.<br>
<br>In the autumn of 1384 Carrick organized a bloodless coup against his ageing father and was appointed guardian of the kingdom by a general council which met in Edinburgh in November 1384. Fife retained the office of chamberlain, however, and maintained a prominent role in Anglo-Scottish warfare and diplomacy during the 1380s. In particular, he was credited with the leadership of Scottish forces which raided the English west marches in 1385 and 1388, although his military record and abilities seem to have been exaggerated as a result of a propaganda battle between him and his elder brother from 1388 to 1392. Their rivalry entered a new phase during 1388 after the death of Carrick's principal political ally, James, second earl of Douglas, at the battle of Otterburn on 5 August that year. James died childless and a struggle over his vast inheritance broke out between his sister's husband, Sir Malcolm Drummond, and James's kinsman Archibald Douglas, lord of Galloway, who claimed the bulk of the earl's estates by virtue of a charter of entail dating from 1342. While Carrick supported Drummond's rights, Fife backed the powerful lord of Galloway. Carrick's position as guardian was undermined by the loss of key adherents and supporters at Otterburn, and also through fighting within his own affinity over the Douglas inheritance. In addition, Carrick seems to have been left lame (and perhaps with more severe injuries) after being kicked by a horse, a condition which was used by his opponents to question his ability to perform the role of guardian, particularly with regard to leading the military defence of the kingdom. On 1 December 1388 Carrick was forced to surrender the guardianship of the kingdom to Fife during a general council at Edinburgh.<h2>
<a name="Guardianofthekingdom"></a>Guardian of the kingdom</h2>Fife's guardianship after December 1388 was marked by the triumph of Archibald, lord of Galloway, in the matter of the Douglas inheritance and by a dramatic expansion of the political and territorial interests of Fife and his family in the north of the kingdom, an advance achieved at the expense of his younger brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26451/', "Alexander Stewart, earl of Buchan")</script> and lord of Ross and Badenoch. On 7 April 1389 the first general council of Fife's guardianship ratified the entail by which Archibald Douglas claimed a substantial part of the inheritance of the second earl of Douglas; by 10 April Archibald was using the title earl of Douglas. Fife's personal support for Archibald's cause is suggested by the fact that Douglas's chief rival, Sir Malcolm Drummond, refused to attend the April 1389 council without an explicit assurance of his personal safety from Fife. While Archibald Douglas flourished, Fife's younger brother, Buchan, whose exercise of royal judicial offices in the north had aroused considerable resentment, suffered a catastrophic decline in power and influence. On 11 December 1388, within ten days of his becoming guardian, Fife removed Buchan from the office of justiciar north of Forth. His replacement, appointed on 2 April 1389, was Fife's own son <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26499/', "Murdoch Stewart")</script>. Fife also encouraged the divorce action initiated by Buchan's estranged wife, Euphemia, countess of Ross, against her husband. The annulment of the marriage in 1392 saw Buchan lose his rights to lordship in the earldom of Ross, control of which passed to the countess and her son from her first marriage, Alexander Leslie, who was contracted in marriage to Fife's daughter.<br>
<br>On 19 April 1390 Robert II died. Fife's elder brother Carrick, who had been declared incapable of governing the kingdom as a royal lieutenant in December 1388, succeeded to the throne as Robert III, but Fife's position as guardian was maintained because of the new king's continued incapacity. This may well have contributed to the attacks on the burghs of Elgin and Forres by his arch-rival, the earl of Buchan, in the summer of 1390. During the early 1390s Fife arranged a series of marriage alliances with prominent families in Argyll and Lennox which strengthened his hold on the south-western highlands. In particular, in February 1392 Fife concluded a deal with Duncan, earl of Lennox, by which his son Murdoch was to marry Isabella, Lennox's eldest daughter and the heir to the earldom of Lennox.<h2>
<a name="RivalrywithRothesay"></a>Rivalry with Rothesay</h2>In February 1393 Fife's guardianship was terminated, possibly because of the increasing influence in royal government of Robert III's young son and heir, David, earl of Carrick (later duke of Rothesay). On 8 February Fife was granted a royal pension of 200 merks in return for his service to Carrick. The pension partly offset the loss of the 1000 merk annuity associated with the office of guardian. Despite the earl of Carrick's growing authority and the withdrawal of the guardianship, Fife remained a hugely important figure in the kingdom. The status of Fife and his nephew, as the most influential and active members of the royal family, exercising many of the functions of government for the infirm Robert III, was reflected in their joint elevation to ducal rank in a ceremony at the abbey of Scone on 28 April 1398. Robert took the title duke of Albany, which appears to derive from the ancient name given to Scotland north of the Forth, while David became duke of Rothesay. The titles were bestowed during the course of a general council in Perth at which the two new royal dukes were assigned the task of leading royal forces in an expedition against Donald of the Isles in the summer of 1398. The April general council also witnessed direct criticism of Robert III's role in government. As a result of King Robert's incapacity, Rothesay was officially appointed lieutenant of the realm for a three-year period in January 1399, to act with the advice of a council of twenty-one named men, headed by his uncle.<br>
<br>During 1401 Albany became alarmed by Rothesay's increasingly independent and aggressive approach to the administration of the realm. Late in that year he plotted the arrest of Rothesay, who was subsequently imprisoned in Albany's castle of Falkland, where he died in suspicious circumstances the following spring (25&#150;27 March 1402). Many clearly felt that Albany had arranged for his nephew to be starved to death, although Robert and his supporters argued that Rothesay had died of natural causes and that his initial arrest was justified by the danger his political aggression presented to the common good. Later chronicle and literary portrayals of Rothesay's death did much to secure Albany's reputation as the archetypal &#145;wicked uncle&#146;. A general council held in May 1402, however, officially exonerated Albany and the fourth earl of Douglas of any responsibility for Rothesay's death and declared that the heir to the throne had died through God's will and not otherwise. In the same council Albany was appointed lieutenant of the kingdom for two years as successor to his dead nephew, a commission which was renewed for a further two years in May 1404. In addition, Albany took on the role of justiciar north of Forth after the capture of his son Murdoch, the previous office-holder, at the battle of Homildon Hill on 14 September 1402.<h2>
<a name="Lieutenantofthekingdom"></a>Lieutenant of the kingdom</h2>Albany's activity as lieutenant after 1402 was largely concerned with the north of the kingdom, although he led an army to the relief of Cocklaws tower in Teviotdale during 1403. The chronicler Bower relates a highly favourable tale of Albany's part in the Cocklaws campaign. Faced with an assembly of Scottish magnates chastened by the disastrous defeat at Homildon Hill and unwilling to commit themselves to an attempt to relieve the Scottish garrison in Cocklaws, Albany roused them to action with a stirring speech: &#145;I vow to God and St Fillan that if I am spared I shall be there on the appointed day even if no one comes with me save my boy Patrick as rider of my warhorse&#146;  (Bower, 8.55). In the north Albany's principal aim was to uphold and exercise the rights of his infant granddaughter, Euphemia Leslie, in the earldom of Ross, and to prevent the earldom from falling into the hands of Donald, lord of the Isles, the husband of Euphemia's aunt.<br>
<br>During the early months of 1406 a new crisis affected the family of Albany's incapacitated brother, Robert III. David Fleming, one of the guardians of King Robert's only remaining son, James, earl of Carrick (the future <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/14587/', "James I")</script>), was killed in a conflict with James Douglas of Balvenie. At the same time the king's ill health prompted concern about arrangements for the young earl of Carrick after his father's death. The king and his advisers were clearly unwilling to let James fall into the custody of his uncle Albany, and made secret plans for the heir to the throne to be sent to the French king for safe keeping until his minority was ended. But on 22 March 1406 James was captured at sea by English ships and delivered into the custody of Henry IV. Shortly afterwards, on 4 April 1406, Robert III died.<h2>
<a name="GovernorofScotland"></a>Governor of Scotland</h2>In July 1406 Albany, in the absence of the late king's son and heir, was appointed governor of the Scottish kingdom by a general council at Perth. Albany's governorship (1406&#150;20) has traditionally been seen as a period in which the duke, lacking the natural authority of a king, was routinely defied by his fellow great magnates, leading to endemic political disorder and the systematic plundering of royal resources and revenues. The dissipation of royal authority was also said to have been advanced by Albany's use of his power to promote the interests of his own family and retainers. Moreover, his issuing of charters dated by the year of his governorship, rather than by the regnal year of James I, along with his failure to obtain the release of his nephew from English captivity, has been used to suggest that he harboured ambitions to usurp his nephew and secure the position of his immediate family as Scotland's royal dynasty.<br>
<br>The view of Albany as a weak and ineffective governor with little commitment to the defence of royal resources has been thoroughly rejected in recent analysis. During his governorship and, indeed, during his numerous spells as guardian of the kingdom from 1388 Albany was noted as a strong and active administrator and an able and energetic war leader. Scottish chroniclers writing in or shortly after his lifetime are universally positive in their appraisal of the duke's personal qualities and his governance of the realm. Bower comments on the &#145;honourable fashion&#146; in which Albany conducted himself as governor and notes:<blockquote>If &hellip; outrages were committed by powerful men in the kingdom, he patiently hid his feelings for the time being. He knew how to put things of this kind right wisely enough when the time came and to secure reparation as he wished. (Bower, 8.133&#150;5)</blockquote>Andrew Wyntoun produced a similarly glowing obituary for the governor, emphasizing his status as a descendant of the eleventh-century royal saint Queen Margaret and suggesting that his conduct resembled that of &#145;a mychty King&#146;, while an anonymous chronicler of the 1390s presents Robert, then earl of Fife, as an accomplished and skilful general. The record evidence generally supports the chronicle view that, within the restrictions of his position as governor, Albany remained a remarkably energetic ruler despite his advancing years. In 1412, for example, he personally led royal forces into the west to extract oaths of submission and hostages from Donald, lord of the Isles. His action was prompted by events of the previous year when Donald's continuing struggle with Albany over the earldom of Ross had encouraged the lord of the Isles to threaten Aberdeenshire with an army drawn from the Hebrides and Ross. On 24 July 1411, at Harlaw near Aberdeen, Donald's force was fought to a standstill by an army headed by Albany's lieutenant in the north, Alexander Stewart, earl of Mar. As governor, Albany may have increasingly relied on co-operation and alliances with powerful regional magnates such as Mar to defend the crown's interests in the localities, but this was not a noticeable departure from the style of government deployed by Albany's father and brother.<br>
<br>Recent research has further attempted to modify the view that Albany harboured sinister ambitions in terms of his nephew's position as king of Scots. His appointment as governor, rather than as guardian or lieutenant in the name of King James, was not a unilateral act, but was sanctioned by a meeting of the three estates in 1406. The novelty of the title probably reflected the fact that James had not been formally invested as king before his capture by the English in 1406. Moreover, Albany's creation as lieutenant or guardian would have implied that the ruler of the Scottish realm had his position sanctioned by, and was thus ultimately answerable to, someone who was in the power of the English crown.<br>
<br>The governor's supposed lack of enthusiasm in attempting to secure the release of his nephew James from English captivity has also been disputed. The release of Albany's own son and heir, Murdoch (held since 1402), in February 1416 is not proof that the duke lobbied harder in the interests of his immediate family. The key to James's release was the attitude of successive English kings, and Henry V, in particular, never gave any indication that he was prepared to countenance the surrender of such a valuable hostage. James would be liberated only after Henry's death and as a result of factional politics in and around the English court.<br>
<br>Although he obtained Murdoch's freedom, Albany generally maintained the traditional Scottish foreign policy position of alliance with the French and hostility towards England. In 1417 he commanded an unsuccessful siege of Berwick, the so-called Foul Raid, while his son <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26483/', "John Stewart, earl of Buchan")</script>, was one of the principal commanders of a large Scottish expeditionary force which arrived in France in October 1419 to assist the dauphin, Charles, against the English. In ecclesiastical affairs Albany, who was lauded as a hater of heretics by Wyntoun, initially ignored the attempts of the Council of Constance to end the papal schism and maintained a conservative adherence to the Avignon pope Benedict XIII, deposed by the council on 26 July 1417. There was considerable opposition to Albany's policy within Scotland, and in a general council at Perth in October 1418 Albany agreed to abandon Benedict and adhere to Martin V, the pope appointed by the Council of Constance.<br>
<br>Albany died about 3 September 1420 in Stirling Castle, when he must have been about eighty years of age, and was buried in the abbey of Dunfermline, a traditional burial site for members of the Scottish royal dynasty. Wyntoun and Bower both wrote glowing obituaries of him. He was succeeded as duke of Albany and governor of the kingdom by his eldest son, Murdoch, who remained governor until James I's release from captivity in April 1424. In the following year, on 25 May 1425, Murdoch was executed at Stirling on the king's orders. The title duke of Albany thereafter lapsed until it was bestowed on Alexander Stewart, second son of James II, in the 1450s.<h2>
<a name="Wivesandchildren"></a>Wives and children</h2>Albany's first wife, Margaret Graham, countess of Menteith (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1334, <i>d</i>. in or before 1380), was the daughter and heir of Sir John Graham and Mary, countess of Menteith. About 1380 he married Muriella Keith, eldest daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15275/', "Sir William Keith")</script>, great marischal of Scotland [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/54235/', "Keith family (per. c.1300&#150;c.1530)")</script>]; she survived her husband and died shortly before Whit Sunday 1449. Murdoch was the only son of Albany's first marriage, but he and his second wife had at least three sons, who were named together in charters of entail from 1389 and 1406. The eldest, John, became chamberlain of Scotland in place of his father on 12 March 1407 and led the Scottish expeditionary force to France in 1419. He was killed at the battle of Verneuil on 17 August 1424, leaving a daughter, Margaret, who became the wife of George, Lord Seton. John's younger brother Andrew died young without heirs, while the youngest brother, Robert, also seems to have left no children, although he was alive as late as April 1431.<br>
<br>Albany's two marriages produced a number of daughters. The eldest, Janet, was still under age when contracted in marriage on 20 July 1372 to David Loen, son of Sir Bartholomew Loen and Philipa Mowbray of Barnbougle, as part of a settlement of Albany's claims to the barony of Barnbougle. It is uncertain whether the Loen marriage was ever concluded, and Janet may have been the daughter of Albany who married Sir William Abernethy of Saltoun. Sir William's sons, William and Patrick, were described as Albany's grandsons on a number of occasions before the younger William's death at the battle of Harlaw in 1411. Another daughter, Margaret, apparently married Sir John Swinton of Swinton, who was killed at the battle of Homildon Hill&#151;Swinton's son and heir, also John, was described as the nephew (sister's son) of John, earl of Buchan, and as Albany's grandson in Bower's account of the battles of Baug&eacute; and Verneuil. Albany used the marriages of several of his other daughters to cement his alliances with important lords in the north and west of Scotland during the 1390s. Before 1398 his daughter Isabel married Alexander Leslie, earl of Ross, who died on 8 May 1402, and the prosecution and defence of the rights of their daughter, Euphemia, in the earldom of Ross absorbed much of Albany's energy after 1402. Isabel subsequently married Walter Haliburton, lord of Dirleton. Albany's daughter Johanna received a dispensation to marry Robert Stewart, son of John Stewart of Lorne, on 27 September 1397, and at about the same time Johanna's sister Marjory married Duncan Campbell, son and heir of Sir Colin Campbell of Loch Awe. Finally, on a date before 28 June 1413 Albany's daughter Elizabeth married Malcolm Fleming of Biggar and Cumbernauld.<br>
