<span class="headword">Thomson, Sir  Edward  Deas</span>  (1800&#150;1879), <span class="occ">administrator and politician in Australia</span>, the third son and fourth child to survive infancy of Sir John Deas Thomson (<i>c</i>.1764&#150;1839), commissioner for the navy, and his wife, Rebecca (<i>d</i>. 1825), the daughter of John Freer, a South Carolina planter, was born at Edinburgh on 1 June 1800. He was educated at Edinburgh high school and at Harrow School, before spending two years in private tuition at Caen. On his return to London he prepared for a mercantile career, and in the meantime assisted his father with the public accounts in a semi-official capacity.<br>
<br>In 1826 Thomson made a journey to the United States to wind up his father's affairs, and afterwards travelled through the eastern states and Canada, recording his impressions in letters to his father. These helped win him the patronage of William Huskisson, who appointed him clerk of the council of New South Wales. Thomson arrived in Sydney in December 1828 and soon won the favour of the tory governor, Ralph Darling, and his whig successor, Sir Richard Bourke, whose second daughter, Anne Maria, Thomson married in 1833. In 1837 Bourke appointed him to be colonial secretary and registrar of deeds and a member of the executive and legislative councils. The appointment was denounced then and later as a job, but Thomson proved himself a capable administrator.<br>
<br>With the introduction of an experimental, partially representative form of government in 1843, Thomson was thrust into the centre of a conflict between the energetic but sometimes impetuous governor Sir George Gipps and talented colonists, including William Charles Wentworth and John Dunmore Lang, who were eager to assert their power. As leader and senior member of the government in the legislative council, Thomson won respect for his tact and political acumen. Under Gipps's successor, the more languid Sir Charles FitzRoy, he was widely regarded as the most powerful man in the colony. He was instrumental in introducing uniform postage arrangements, a fiscal system based on the principles of free trade, and electoral legislation based on town, rural, and pastoral interests. When the gold rushes began in 1851, he was responsible for a licence system that allowed ready access to the diggings and helped maintain social order during a period of tumultuous change.<br>
<br>Early in 1854 Thomson was granted two years' leave on the grounds of ill health, and he travelled with his family to London, where he was often consulted by members of the Colonial Office. In 1855 he acted as commissioner for New South Wales at the Paris Universal Exhibition.<br>
<br>After returning to Sydney in 1856, Thomson found it hard to come to terms with the new political order that followed the introduction of responsible government. Invited to form a ministry, he made political miscalculations and failed to win sufficient support. He did, however, remain briefly as caretaker colonial secretary and helped determine administrative arrangements under the new system. From 1856 until his death he was a member of the upper house, except for a short interruption in 1861, when he and his conservative colleagues resigned in protest against the intended swamping of the chamber. He served in the ministry of Henry Watson Parker in 1856&#150;7 as vice-president of the legislative council. An early advocate of intercolonial union, he proposed in the council in 1857 a motion for the federation of the Australian colonies. This made him one of the first federationists, though his support for the cause owed more to his desire for administrative efficiency than to national sentiment.<br>
<br>In his later years Thomson devoted his attention chiefly to educational questions; he was vice-chancellor of Sydney University from 1862 to 1865, and was elected chancellor annually from 1865 to 1878. He was president of various institutions, including the Australian Jockey Club and the Sydney Infirmary. In the late 1860s he corresponded with Florence Nightingale about hospital improvements and the introduction of Nightingale nurses to New South Wales.<br>
<br>Throughout his long career Thomson remained committed to administrative efficiency, social order, and the welfare and improvement of the colony. Although radicals criticized his conservative politics, he won and retained the respect of most colonists as well as successive governors. He died at his home, Barham, Darlinghurst, Sydney, on 16 July 1879, leaving his wife, two sons, and five daughters. He was buried at St Jude's Church, Randwick, New South Wales. He had been made CB in 1856 and KCMG in 1874.<br>
