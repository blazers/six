<span class="headword">Simson,  Patrick</span>  (1628&#150;1715), <span class="occ">Church of Scotland minister</span>, was born in New Abbey manse, Kirkcudbrightshire, on 2 October 1628, the second son and sixth child of Adam Simson (1594&#150;1642), the minister there, and his wife, Margaret Spens. His early years are obscure. He may not have accompanied his parents when they went about 1632 to Ireland, where his father died ten years later, leaving his wife in penury; he may instead have been brought up by his cousin George Gillespie. He matriculated in arts at Edinburgh in 1643 and was a member of the class of James Wiseman (<i>d</i>. 1655), professor of philosophy, but did not graduate. Once licensed (date unknown), he served between 1649 and 1653 as chaplain and tutor to the marquess of Argyll at Inveraray.<br>
<br>Having already been an observer at six general assemblies of the kirk on 11 November 1653 Simson was ordained and inducted to Renfrew. On 30 August 1654 he married Elizabeth Hay, daughter of his predecessor (and successor); they had five children. Little is seen of Simson's Renfrew ministry before his ejection on 1 October 1662. Following the death of his wife on 31 March 1662, on 30 June 1664 he married Janet Peadie (<i>bap</i>. 1635, <i>d</i>. 1714), widow of Robert Cullen, a Glasgow merchant. Of their seven children, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25604/', "John Simson")</script> became a Glasgow professor of dubious orthodoxy.<br>
<br>After accepting the second <span class="roman">Act of Indulgence</span>, Simson was appointed to Kilmacolm in 1672, but the family's unsettled life was not at an end. In 1674 he was charged with ministering outside his parish. He supported the covenanter preacher Alexander Peden during the latter's imprisonment on the Bass Rock in 1677, and, having refused the privy council's summons in 1678&#150;9 to answer for &#145;keeping of conventicles&#146;, was deposed, but the sentence was not enforced for some years. The 1687 declaration of indulgence allowed his reappointment to Renfrew, but this was not implemented until 1690.<br>
<br>In his later years Simson proved a valued counsellor in ecclesiastical business, for example, during the restoration of presbyterianism in 1690 and the union debates of 1707. He served in 1695&#150;6 as moderator at a general assembly which moved towards realizing the Scottish reformation's aim of a school in every parish, was involved in witch trials in 1697, and was dean of the faculties in Glasgow University from 1690 to 1701. The communion cups presented on his ministerial jubilee in 1703 were still in use at the end of the twentieth century, but although plans to authorize for congregational use his <span class="italic">Spiritual Songs, or, Holy Poems</span> (1685&#150;6), drawn from the <span class="roman">Bible</span>, came close to fruition in 1708, they lapsed thereafter. Simson retained a sharp mind and memory, being father of the kirk at the end of his life. His wife having died on 19 September 1714, Simson himself died on 24 October 1715. Robert Wodrow, who knew him well, paid him a glowing tribute. Three of his writings on church controversies survive in manuscript (NL Scot., Wodrow MSS).<br>
