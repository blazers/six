<span class="headword">Waldegrave,  Samuel</span>  (1817&#150;1869), <span class="occ">bishop of Carlisle</span>, was born at Cardington, Bedfordshire, on 13 September 1817, the second son of William Waldegrave, eighth Earl Waldegrave (1788&#150;1859), and his first wife, Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1843), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29231/', "Samuel Whitbread")</script>. Elizabeth Waldegrave was an evangelical and led her son, at an early age, to faith in Christ. He was educated at Cheam School under Charles Mayo, an evangelical, before entering Balliol College, Oxford, in 1835. His tutor, A. C. Tait, cared for him during a serious illness, becoming a lifelong friend. After obtaining first-class honours in classics and mathematics he graduated BA in 1839 and MA in 1842. He was elected to a fellowship of All Souls College in 1839. He remained in Oxford, and was public examiner in mathematics between 1842 and 1844.<br>
<br>Waldegrave was ordained deacon in 1842 and priest in 1843, serving as curate of the working-class parish of St Ebbe's, Oxford, where, in conjunction with his fellow curates Charles Thomas Baring and Edward Arthur Litton, he promoted the erection of Holy Trinity, which opened as a district church in 1844. In that year he was appointed to the All Souls living of Barford St Martin, Wiltshire. After relinquishing his fellowship he married in 1845 Jane Ann (<i>d</i>. 1877), daughter of Francis Pym of The Hasells, Bedfordshire; they had two children. At Barford his views brought him into conflict with the bishop of Salisbury (Walter Kerr Hamilton).<br>
<br>In 1854 Waldegrave delivered the Bampton lectures at Oxford, in which he countered the popularly held premillennialist view of the second coming of Christ (a literal belief in the 1000 years predicted in Revelation 20) with a powerful presentation of the amillennialist (non-literal) position. The eight lectures were published in 1855 as <span class="italic">New Testament millenarianism, or, The kingdom and coming of Christ as taught by himself and his apostles</span>. Waldegrave regarded premillennialism as unscriptural, a &#145;bewitching phantasy&#146; which needed to be refuted.<br>
<br>Palmerston appointed Waldegrave a canon residentiary of Salisbury Cathedral in 1857, and then bishop of Carlisle in 1860. Waldegrave built on the work of his predecessor (H. M. Villiers), and spent much of his time in diocesan administration and securing the position of the evangelical party in his diocese. He appointed evangelicals as archdeacons and attracted a number of evangelicals into the diocese, supporting the patronage work of Alfred Peache. He was the first bishop to ordain men from the London College of Divinity. Waldegrave was particularly vigilant over the selection, examination, and ordination of ordinands, and like Villiers tried to improve the academic quality of the candidates. He was also concerned about the housing and salary of his clergy, a particular problem in a diocese where half of the livings were valued at under &pound;100 a year. The Carlisle Diocesan Church and Parsonage and Benefice Augmentation Society (founded in 1862) raised money from local sources as well as obtaining grants from the ecclesiastical commissioners. His aristocratic connections were used to good effect; Angela Burdett-Coutts, the duke of Westminster, and Waldegrave's stepmother, Sarah, the Countess Waldegrave, gave financial support to church building in the diocese.<br>
<br>Waldegrave and Francis Close were united in their opposition to the English Church Union, an Anglo-Catholic body in Barrow in Furness. Waldegrave erected an evangelical church to counter the union's activities, and in his third charge (1867) made a strong attack upon ritualism. Although not a frequent speaker in the House of Lords, he supported Lord Shaftesbury's efforts to legislate against extreme ritualism and vigorously defended the law of Sunday observance. Waldegrave was a gentle, quiet-spoken, sensitive, devout, and hard-working bishop, held in high regard by his evangelical contemporaries. J. C. Ryle described him as a man &#145;of rare gifts and graces&#146;  (S. Waldegrave, <span class="italic">Christ the True Altar</span>, 1870, vi).<br>
<br>In December 1868, exhausted, Waldegrave developed a brain tumour. During his prolonged illness the diocese was in the hands of Bishop David Anderson, the vicar of Christ Church, Clifton, Bristol. Waldegrave died at Rose Castle, Carlisle, on 1 October 1869 and was buried in the graveyard of Carlisle Cathedral. A monument was erected to his memory in the cathedral in 1872. He left a son, Samuel Edmund Waldegrave (1856&#150;1907), rector of Oborne, Dorset, and a daughter, Elizabeth Janet (1858&#150;1890), who married Richard Reginald Fawkes, vicar of Spondon, Derbyshire.<br>
