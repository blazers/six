<span class="headword">Bion,  Wilfred Ruprecht</span>  (1897&#150;1979), <span class="occ">psychoanalyst</span>, was born on 8 September 1897 at Mathura, North-Western Provinces, India, the elder son (there was one daughter) of Frederick Fleetwood Bion (1870?&#150;1949), civil engineer, and Rhoda Salter Kemp (1869?&#150;1939). Bion spent his first eight years in India, described vividly in his autobiography, <span class="italic">The Long Weekend</span> (1982), in which he recaptured both the vividness of India and some of his early psychological difficulties: his fear of his father's anger, his deeply felt hatred of both parents, the dreams in which &#145;Arf Arfer&#146; (his father) made a terrifying appearance. These were compounded when, aged eight, he returned with his mother and sister to England for schooling at Bishop's Stortford College, a nonconformist public school, which he attended from 1905 to 1915. The period between the ages of eight and twelve he looked back on as appalling, subject to cataclysmic storms of confusion and religious guilt; only sex, &#145;wiggling&#146;  (Bion, <span class="italic">Long Weekend</span>), redeemed him. From the age of twelve he spent holidays with the families of schoolfriends, where he found hospitable warmth, and began to appreciate the good qualities of school, its intellectual and emotional liveliness. Bion's youth was overshadowed by the First World War. He was of the generation who felt doomed, and who did not expect to survive military service, which he scarcely did, being one of the few survivors of the tank regiment at the battle of Cambrai. Bion's DSO celebrated his bravery in saving the crew of his disabled tank. He was also a chevalier of the L&eacute;gion d'honneur and was mentioned in dispatches. In his <span class="italic">War Memoirs</span> (1997) Bion recounts his prolonged, dangerous experiences over two years in the front line. His distinguished military career held him in good stead in military psychiatry during the Second World War.<br>
<br>In 1919 Bion entered Queen's College, Oxford, to read modern history, graduating in 1921. The philosophical bent which marked his future writings was stimulated by his tutor, H. J. Paton, a Kantian moral philosopher. A good athlete, Bion was a rugby blue and a swimming half-blue. After graduating Bion returned to Bishop's Stortford College, where he taught history and French and stimulated enthusiasm for both rugby and swimming. His interest in psychoanalysis already aroused, he studied medicine at University College Hospital, London, in 1924, graduating MRCS LRCP in 1930, and was awarded the gold medal for clinical surgery. Bion worked for the great neurosurgeon and psychologist Wilfred Trotter, who was brother-in-law to Ernest Jones, the leading British psychoanalyst.<br>
<br>From 1933 until 1948 Bion worked at the Tavistock Clinic where, in 1936, the writer Samuel Beckett was his patient. Bion did not train as a psychoanalyst until after the Second World War, though he had personal psychotherapy in the 1930s with J. Hadfield and one year of psychoanalysis with his future mentor and colleague, John Rickman, with whom he later had a productive working collaboration at Northfield Military Hospital. In 1939 Bion joined the Royal Army Medical Corps and was one of the psychiatrists appointed to a senior position by J. R. Rees, director of the pre-war Tavistock Clinic. He held the rank of major. His brief appointment to the training wing at Northfield Military Hospital led to a significant publication with Rickman on what was later known as the &#145;first Northfield experiment&#146;. Bion introduced the leaderless group method of officer selection which significantly improved both the quality and the quantity of officers for the greatly enlarged post-Dunkirk British army. This period of his life was darkened by the death in childbirth, in 1945, of his beautiful actress wife Elizabeth (Betty) McKittrick Jardine (<i>b</i>. 1904), daughter of William James Jardine, cotton manufacturer, whom he had married on 17 April 1940. Their daughter, Parthenope (<i>d</i>. 1998), became a psychoanalyst. On his return to the Tavistock Clinic, Bion was appointed chairman of the medical committee. Accorded great respect and authority by his colleagues, he was responsible for the radical reshaping of the clinic, which had followed an eclectic approach, to one strictly psychoanalytic.<br>
<br>Bion had developed a theory of unconscious group processes as a result of his wartime experiences. He observed that individuals in a group unconsciously disown parts of their mentalities and contribute to a group mentality, then behaving as if in the grip of powerful unconscious forces. These he named as the basic assumptions of dependence, fight&#150;flight, and pairing. These forces interfere with the work mentality of the group unless and until they have been made conscious. Bion's basic assumptions theory was adopted by his colleagues at the Tavistock Clinic and the Tavistock Institute of Human Relations, which was formed for psychological work in industry and organizations. Bion himself soon ceased to work with groups and for the rest of his professional life concerned himself with psychoanalytic training and the treatment of severely disturbed persons, schizoid, borderline, and psychotic. His experiences formed the basis of many influential papers and books in which he developed original ideas on the birth of the capacity for thought in earliest infancy and how this is lost in the psychoses. His insight into psychotic states of confusion, persecution, and appalling guilt arose from his recall of his own disturbed childhood where he was himself close to madness. His <span class="italic">Experiences in Groups and other Papers</span> was published in 1968.<br>
<br>Bion's analysis with Melanie Klein was a powerful influence on his personality and mind but he went on to develop his original ideas about thinking and its disturbances. Bion's concept of &#145;containment&#146; advanced Klein's concept of projective identification (that an infant attempts to rid itself of unacceptable and unbearable parts of the self by projection into the outer world) into an interpersonal process. When the infant's unbearable experience is understood as communication and appropriately responded to by the mother, then the infant can regain the disowned part, now made bearable, transformed through the interpersonal relation. His work had great influence on psychoanalytic studies of schizophrenia. Though his writing style is often condensed, combining psychoanalytical thought and philosophical argument, which can make for difficult reading, his legacy, as in <span class="italic">Cogitations</span> (1994), is a considerable addition to the study of mental processes of infancy and in severe mental illness.<br>
<br>Bion was director of the clinic of the British Psychoanalytical Society in 1955&#150;62, and its president in 1962&#150;5. In 1968 he left Britain to live for eleven years in Los Angeles, which he left to return to England in his dying year. His period in North America allowed him the freedom of thought and action which he would not have had staying in London. His ideas were also influential in Latin America through his visits there. He considered that in London he would have either become a mystic in conflict with the establishment or &#145;loaded with honours and sunk without trace&#146;.<br>
<br>Bion was a large bulky man, round faced, red cheeked; his voice was deep and his manner shy. An encounter with him was a memorable experience; he possessed an original mind and focused his concerns and attention on deep and difficult psychic issues. His spontaneous humour was reserved for his family and can be seen in his letters to them published in his autobiography. He began a happy second marriage on 9 June 1951 to Francesca (Patricia Ivy) McCallum (<i>b</i>. 1922), a widow, daughter of Archibald John Purnell, schoolmaster. She was a researcher at the Tavistock Clinic, and together they had two further children, Julian (<i>b</i>. 1952) and Nicola (<i>b</i>. 1955).<br>
<br>Bion died in the John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, of myeloid leukaemia on 8 November 1979 and was cremated in Oxford on 12 November. His ashes were buried two days later at Happisburgh church, Norfolk, a county which he loved and in which he spent many holidays. He was survived by his second wife.<br>
