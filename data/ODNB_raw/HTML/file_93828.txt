<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Barnes,  Peter Henry</span>  (1931&#150;2004), <span class="occ">playwright and screenwriter</span>, was born on 10 January 1931 at 33 Devons Road, Bromley, London, the son of (James) Frederick Barnes, fairground caterer and caf&eacute; owner, and his wife, Martha, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Miller.<blockquote>I grew up in a downmarket seaside resort on the east coast where my parents worked in amusement arcades on the pier and later owned two caf&eacute;s on the seafront, along with the cockles and whelks stalls, the deckchairs, Punch and Judy booths, and artists who would draw, with a pointed stick, elegant pictures in the wet sand. (<span class="italic">The Guardian</span>, 5 July 2004)</blockquote>It was a background that may explain some of the carnivalesque elements in his later writing. It may also account for his fascination with comedy created from improbable circumstances&#151;a wet, windswept English summer, for instance. On his birth certificate his father's occupation was given as &#145;amusement caterer&#146;. It was a title Barnes might have chosen for himself.<br>
<br>Educated at Stroud grammar school, Barnes did his national service in the RAF, worked for London county council, and then, in 1954, joined the magazine <span class="italic">Films and Filming</span>. In 1956 he became a screenwriter for Warwick Films. His scripts were good, sharp, and professional, and from then on provided his main source of income. &#145;They never got made, of course&#146;, he once said, &#145;but you still got paid&#146;  (personal knowledge). They paid for his lifelong passion&#151;playwriting.<br>
<br>Barnes's first stage play was <span class="italic">The Time of the Barracudas</span> (San Francisco, 1963), his first UK stage play was <span class="italic">Sclerosis</span> (Edinburgh, 1965), and his first major success was <span class="italic">The Ruling Class</span> (Nottingham Playhouse, 1968; Piccadilly, 1969). Directed by Stuart Burge and led by Derek Godfrey, it won both the John Whiting award and the Evening Standard award. In 1972 it was filmed with Peter O'Toole. <span class="italic">The Ruling Class</span> was the first of his great plays and the first to explore fully his anti-authoritarian stance, his mockery of worship, and his refusal to be bound by stage conventions. His hero, the Fourteenth Earl of Gurney, is deemed mad when he thinks he is Jesus Christ and preaches love and compassion, and regarded as perfectly sane when he thinks he is Jack the Ripper and preaches punishment and revenge. &#145;I don't believe in God, the afterlife (this one is surely enough) or any of the other aspects of desperation&#146;, Barnes said in later life, &#145;but I am concerned with faith. What is it? How does it operate through men and women and why?&#146;  (Rabey, 256).<br>
<br>The success of <span class="italic">The Ruling Class</span> made Barnes popular for the next decade. <span class="italic">Leonardo's Last Supper</span> and <span class="italic">Noonday Demons</span> (double bill, Open Space, 1969) were both well received, as was his adaptation and co-direction of Frank Wedekind's <span class="italic">Lulu</span> (Nottingham Playhouse and Royal Court, 1970). But it was <span class="italic">The Bewitched</span> (Royal Shakespeare Company at Aldwych, 1974), directed by Terry Hands and starring Alan Howard, that introduced the word &#145;Barnesian&#146; to theatre language. It brought together all Barnes's obsessions&#151;religion, authority, cruelty, anarchy, history&#151;all served up in a carnival of popular music, black comedy, and irreverence. Barnes admired Ben Jonson and particularly <span class="italic">Bartholomew Fair</span>. <span class="italic">The Bewitched</span> stands comparison with what is arguably Jonson's greatest play.<br>
<br>In 1976 Barnes turned to directing with his adaptation of Georges Feydeau's <span class="italic">The Purging</span> (Old Vic and Criterion). This was followed by Jonson's <span class="italic">The Devil is an Ass</span> (Edinburgh/National Theatre, 1977), Wedekind and Bertolt Brecht's <span class="italic">For All Those Who Get Despondent</span> (1977), Jonson's <span class="italic">Bartholomew Fair</span> (Round House, 1978), Edward Marston's <span class="italic">Antonio</span> (Nottingham Playhouse, 1979), Wedekind's <span class="italic">The Devil Himself</span> (1980), and again Jonson's <span class="italic">Bartholomew Fair</span> (Round House, 1987).<br>
<br>Throughout the majority of Barnes's career anger had been the primary energy fuelling his best work&#151;anger at injustice, inhumanity, or bureaucratic barbarism. In 1978, with <span class="italic">Laughter</span> (Royal Court), it was generally regarded that this anger had gone too far. It was a double bill that moved from the cruelties of Ivan the Terrible to the insane horrors of Auschwitz. As a Jewish writer Barnes felt that he could make jokes about the extermination camps. The world disagreed. It was a turning point. Whether consciously or unconsciously Barnes began to allow the warmth of his own personality to inform his work. Those who knew him well turned to him often for support and advice. Those who worked with him loved him: those who worked with him often, like Dilys Laye, regarded him as a friend for life. When asked, &#145;What do you see as the main function of your comedy?&#146;, Barnes replied: &#145;Revolution&#146;  (Rabey, 254). But now instead of anger the mainspring became love.<br>
<br>Written in 1978, the same year as <span class="italic">Laughter</span>, <span class="italic">Red Noses</span> (RSC at the Barbican, 1985) became his third great play. Directed by Terry Hands and starring Anthony Sher, it dealt with a group of fools called God's Zanies bringing laughter and momentary happiness to those dying of the plague. The concept was typically Barnesian and so too the targets&#151;organized religion, bureaucracy, and injustice. And as always it was irreverent. &#145;I see God&#146;, cries Flote (their leader) at one point, &#145;and &hellip; (pause) &hellip; she's black!!&#146; <span class="italic">Red Noses</span> won the Olivier award for best new play.<br>
<br>In 1986 Barnes adapted Feydeau's <span class="italic">Scenes from a Marriage</span> (RSC at the Barbican) and then continued this &#145;warmer&#146; phase with <span class="italic">Sunsets and Glories</span> (West Yorkshire Playhouse and Queens, 1990), the story of a man too saintly to be pope, and <span class="italic">Dreaming</span> (Royal Exchange, Manchester, and Queens, 1999), the story of a soldier from the Wars of the Roses seeking a home. In 1991 he adapted Kunio Shimizu's <span class="italic">Tango at the End of Winter</span> and in 1997 Charles Dickens's <span class="italic">A Christmas Carol</span> (Clwyd Theatr Cymru)&#151;later televised with Patrick Stewart as Scrooge. This was followed in 2001 by <span class="italic">Jubilee</span> (RSC at The Swan), a lighthearted look at the Shakespeare industry.<br>
<br>With political correctness gaining ground it was becoming increasingly difficult to mount or remount a Barnes play. His screenwriting continued to be a financial support and increasingly his scripts were actually being made, particularly for television. These included <span class="italic">The Spirit of Man</span> (1989), <span class="italic">Nobody Here But Us Chickens</span> (1990), which won the Royal Television Society award for best screen play, <span class="italic">Enchanted April</span> (1991), based on the novel by Elizabeth von Arnim (also adapted for film in 1993, for which he won an Oscar nomination), <span class="italic">Bye Bye Columbus</span> (1992), <span class="italic">Hard Times</span> (1994), and <span class="italic">Babies</span> (2004), along with various adaptations for American television. He was particularly pleased with the Oscar nomination. &#145;It's put my fees up&#146;, he said gleefully. &#145;I can write more plays. Not that anybody'll put them on&#146;  (personal knowledge).<br>
<br>Barnes loved actors, and radio enabled him to work with the best. His radio plays included <span class="italic">My Ben Jonson</span> (1973), <span class="italic">The Two Hangmen</span>, from Wedekind and Brecht (1979), <span class="italic">The Jumping Minuses of Byzantium</span> (1981, Giles Cooper award), <span class="italic">A Mad World My Masters</span> from Thomas Middleton (1983), <span class="italic">The Primrose Path</span> from Feydeau (1984), <span class="italic">The Old Law</span> from Middleton, William Rowley and Philip Massinger (1986), <span class="italic">Don Juan and Faust</span>, from Christian Dietrich Grabbe (1987), <span class="italic">The Magnetic Lady</span> from Jonson (1987), and four instalments of <span class="italic">Barnes' People</span> (1981, 1983, 1986, and 1989). His <span class="italic">Collected Plays</span> were published in three volumes, in 1981, 1993, and 1996.<br>
<br>For a writer whose plays sprawled with epic exuberance through every barrier known to convention, Barnes's personal life was a model of discipline and restraint. Every morning he would write. Initially it was in the reading room of the British Museum, where he taught himself everything there was to know about the Jacobeans and unearthed those corners of forgotten history that inspired his plays, and latterly in a hamburger bar in central London. He would work from nine until one with his hamburger cooling in front of him. The bun went into the bin and the meat went home with him for the dog. This was eccentric, perhaps, but there was a statement in everything Barnes did and that would have included sitting defiantly for four hours on one of those downward-sloping plastic seats.<br>
<br>Barnes had a happy home life, first with the Austrian Charlotte Beck, whom he married in 1958, and then, after she died in 1995, with an American computer animation designer, Christie Jane Horn, whom he married on 4 March 1995. They had a daughter, Leela (<i>b</i>. 2000), followed by triplets, Zachary, Nathaniel, and Abigail (<i>b</i>. 2002). His happiness was complete. &#145;Maybe it's what I always wanted&#146;, he said. &#145;It's just that I always seem to do things the wrong way round&#146;  (personal knowledge).<br>
<br>Barnes always did things the wrong way round. While others were writing &#145;through-the-letterbox&#146; plays&#151;complete with stage directions and instructions on how to reduce the seven-man cast to five in case of touring&#151;he was writing vast epics with casts of forty-five and more locations than a travel guide. He wrote with the wild freedom of an Elizabethan, delighting in language, and inventing words when he could not find the ones he wanted. When asked about influences on his writing he answered, &#145;Wedekind, Feydeau, Jonson and the Jacobean playwrights&#151;Middleton, Marston and to a lesser extent Otway. In films, Lubitsch, Renoir. Comedians, Laurel and Hardy, W. C. Fields, Keaton, Will Hay, Spike Milligan. Vaudeville and Music Hall. Writers&#151;William Burroughs, Rabelais, James Joyce&#146;  (Rabey, 255). To these one can surely add Ingmar Bergman and Alfred Jarry. It all added up to being &#145;Barnesian&#146;.<br>
<br>Peter Barnes was the boldest playwright of the late twentieth century. He died on 1 July 2004 at St Mary's Hospital, Westminster, following a stroke, and was survived by his wife, Christie, and their four children.<br>
