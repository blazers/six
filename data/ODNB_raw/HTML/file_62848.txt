<span class="headword">Kettle,  Thomas Michael <span class="st"> [Tom]</span></span>  (1880&#150;1916), <span class="occ">politician and writer</span>, was born on 9 February 1880 at Artane, co. Dublin, the seventh of the twelve children of Andrew Kettle (1833&#150;1916), farmer, and his wife, Margaret, daughter of Laurence McCourt of St Margaret's, co. Dublin. He was exposed to politics from an early age. His father, who had been active in the Tenant League in the 1850s, presided at the first meeting of the National Land League in 1879 and was instrumental in persuading Charles Stuart Parnell to become involved in the Land League. Andrew Kettle was an exacting man, stern, demanding, and stubborn, but his imprisonment in 1881 for involvement in land agitation and his enduring support for Parnell provided his son Thomas with considerable cachet when he embarked on his own political career.<br>
<br>Tom Kettle was raised in comfortable rural surroundings, and like his brothers he attended the Christian Brothers' O'Connell Schools at Richmond Street, Dublin, where he excelled. In 1894 he was sent as a boarder to the Jesuit-run Clongowes Wood College. Quick-tempered, mischievous, and clever, he became known as a wit and an athlete. He enjoyed cycling and cricket and, true to his upbringing, he was also a keen debater and a devout Catholic. After leaving Clongowes with honours in English and French, in 1897 Kettle entered University College, Dublin, a Jesuit-administered constituent college of the Royal University of Ireland. Surrounded by ambitious and politically minded young men, Kettle quickly established himself both as a leading student politician and as a brilliant scholar. He was elected to the prestigious position of auditor of the college's literary and historical society for the 1898&#150;9 session. He distributed pro-Boer leaflets during the early months of the South African War and protested against the Irish Literary Theatre's production of W. B. Yeats's <span class="italic">The Countess Cathleen</span> in 1899. His studies were marred by a mysterious illness which prevented him from taking his bachelor of arts examinations in 1900. He was prone to colds, but it is likely that the &#145;nervous condition&#146; he suffered was in fact a nervous breakdown. Irregular but revealing references in his diaries, notebooks, and correspondence disclose a melancholy disposition which was prone to depression. He renewed his spirits, as he often did, by travelling on the continent and improving his French and German. Upon his return to Dublin he resumed his studies and took his BA in mental and moral science in 1902.<br>
<br>Kettle was admitted into the Honourable Society of King's Inns to read law in 1903, but even after qualifying in 1905 he rarely practised and devoted most of his time to political journalism. He also maintained his contacts with University College and his fellow students, continuing to participate in debates, contributing to and becoming editor of the college newspaper, and helping to found the Cui Bono Club, a discussion group for recent graduates. A vocal supporter of the Irish Parliamentary Party, Kettle strengthened his links to the constitutionalists by co-founding and becoming president of the Young Ireland branch of the United Irish League in 1904. He had by this time earned the attention of John Redmond, Irish party leader, who hoped that he would stand for a parliamentary seat. Kettle declined the offer and turned instead to the founding and editing of <span class="italic">The Nationist</span>, an unconventional weekly journal. <span class="italic">The Nationist</span> pursued an unashamedly pro-Irish party line, but it also reflected Kettle's liberal and often controversial views on a wide range of topics which included education, women's rights, and the Irish literary revival. He resigned from the editorship over a controversy about an allegedly anti-clerical article in 1905.<br>
<br>Kettle accepted the candidature for the vacant parliamentary seat of East Tyrone at a by-election in July 1906, and secured the seat by the narrow margin of eighteen votes to become one of the very few young men to gain admission to the ageing ranks of the Irish Parliamentary Party in the first two decades of the twentieth century. Lauded as a future party leader, in late 1906 he went to America, where he engaged in a series of successful fund-raising and propaganda meetings. An amusing and often caustic speaker in the House of Commons, he remained a staunch supporter of the Irish party and of the constitutional path to home rule, but turned his attention to a number of topical questions, including the provision of higher education for Irish Catholics, and to Ireland's economic condition. Increasingly busy and in demand as a speaker, Kettle began to earn a reputation as a heavy drinker and a frequent visitor of bars and clubs.<br>
<br>On 8 September 1909 Kettle married Mary Sheehy (<i>b</i>. 1884), a fellow graduate of the Royal University, a suffragist, and, like Kettle, a member of a well-known nationalist family (her father, David Sheehy, was a nationalist MP). Their daughter Elizabeth (Betty) was born in 1913. Kettle was appointed professor of national economics at University College, a constituent college of the new National University of Ireland. Critics claimed that Kettle could not combine academic life with his work as an MP, and although he held his East Tyrone seat in January 1910, he did not contest it at the general election held in December 1910. Even after he was out of parliament, he remained an active party member and in 1910 he published a collection of essays which reiterated his dedication to home rule by constitutional means. A popular teacher, he was known at University College as a &#145;professor of all things&#146;, but his genuine interest in economics was reflected in a number of publications on financial matters. He greeted the removal of the Lords' veto and the <span class="roman">Home Rule Bill</span> of 1912 with great optimism, but his brusque dismissal of Unionist objections to the bill reflected his misunderstanding of their fears about the bill's possible effects. He also crossed swords with Irish feminists who condemned the bill; although he was a vocal and long-time supporter of women's suffrage, Kettle disapproved both of attacks on private property and of placing any cause before the implementation of home rule.<br>
<br>In contrast to most middle-class commentators, Kettle refused to condemn striking workers in 1913 and published a series of articles which outlined the living and working conditions of Dublin's poor. He presided over the formation of a peace committee which endeavoured to negotiate an agreement between workers and their employers; this organization enjoyed little success, and Kettle's own reputation was tarnished by his appearance at an important meeting in a less than sober state. His excessive drinking became more obvious to friends and colleagues and his work was affected; he appeared to be depressed and he was sent in 1913 to a private hospital in Kent for treatment for &#145;dipsomania&#146;. Despite this, he became deeply involved with the nationalist Irish Volunteers, a quasi-military organization established in 1913 in opposition to the militant Ulster Volunteer Force. Sent in 1914 to continental Europe to buy arms for the volunteers, Kettle witnessed at first hand the outbreak of the First World War. He travelled through Belgium and France as war correspondent for the <span class="italic">Daily News</span>, praising the courage of the Belgians and warning against the dire threat to Europe of Prussian militarism. A firm believer in the rights of small nations, Kettle supported Irish involvement in the British war effort, and volunteered for active service upon returning to Dublin in 1914. He was refused an immediate commission on the grounds of ill health (in reality, because of his heavy drinking); he received the rank of lieutenant, but his activities were restricted to recruiting throughout Ireland and England.<br>
<br>Kettle presented himself as an Irish party candidate for a forthcoming by-election at East Galway in December 1914. He was not selected, but his support for the party did not abate and he continued to publish tracts advocating home rule. By 1916 Kettle had published more than ten books and pamphlets and had contributed numerous articles to journals and newspapers, including the <span class="italic">Fortnightly Review</span>, the <span class="italic">Irish Ecclesiastical Review</span>, and the <span class="italic">Freeman's Journal</span>. Many of his works were concerned with Irish politics, but he also published literary reviews, philosophical treatises, and translations from French and German. A prolific and well-regarded poet and essayist, he is probably best remembered for a poem composed shortly before his death, &#145;To my Daughter, Betty, the Gift of God&#146;, which is often included in anthologies of First World War poetry.<br>
<br>Although disillusioned with the war as it dragged on, and questioning British war aims, Kettle maintained that Irish soldiers had a moral duty to join the allied stand against Germany. He was frequently warned and disciplined for being intoxicated while in uniform, but he none the less continued to apply to be sent on active service. His appeals were refused until 1916, when the commanding officer of the 16th division took a chance on Kettle and commissioned him into the Dublin fusiliers. Kettle's health had evidently improved by this time, but it remained delicate. Appalling conditions in the trenches broke his health and he was given a rear area job shortly before the Somme battles. However, he refused offers of a permanent staff position and sick leave, and insisted on returning to his battalion, the 9th Dublin fusiliers.<br>
<br>Before he finally left Ireland in July 1916, Kettle prophesied that the Easter rebels of 1916 would be remembered as heroes while Irishmen serving in the British army would be deemed traitors. His prediction was remarkably astute. Kettle was killed on 9 September 1916, while taking part in the Irish brigade's capture of Ginchy and he was buried near by. The news of his death provoked a wealth of tributes, testifying to Kettle's brilliance, generosity, and wit; he was widely acknowledged as the leading constitutional nationalist of his generation. But the radicalization of Irish politics and the denunciation of the men and women who had supported home rule and the war effort ensured that his fame faded together with the primacy of the constitutional agenda. An attempt to erect a commemorative portrait bust of Kettle was beset by controversy until it was finally placed&#151;without an official unveiling&#151;in St Stephen's Green, Dublin, in 1937.<br>
