<span class="headword">Blount <span class="st"> [Blunt]</span>,  Edward</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1562, <em>d.</em> in or before 1632), <span class="occ">bookseller and translator</span>, was baptized on 31 January 1562 in the parish of St Laurence Pountney, London, probably the sixth of eight known children of Ralph (Rafe) Blount 
    (Blunt or Blonte; <i>d</i>. 1571)
  , merchant tailor. Ralph, freed of his apprenticeship in 1548, was reasonably prosperous, but never became a member of the Merchant Taylors' Company. Edward's unknown mother must have died when he was quite young; his father remarried in 1566. Edward's stepmother, Margaret Roberdine Blount, was buried on 5 August 1571, followed by his father on 9 September. His father's will, written just four days before, divides his estate equally between his six surviving &#145;welbelovde children&#146;  (Guildhall Library, MS 9171, fol. 77<i>r</i>).<br>
<br>Born into the urban middle class, orphaned at a young age, Edward lived seventy years in London, a tradesman like his father, but unlike most small shopkeepers he had a profound impact on English cultural life. He had an unparalleled gift for recognizing new works that would eventually become classics: he was more consistently successful in anticipating the cultural consensus of the future than Daniel, Sidney, Jonson, or any other early modern critic. This achievement was made possible by his father's most important legacy: a literary education. The son of a merchant tailor, Edward almost certainly attended&#151;as did his two elder brothers&#151;the Merchant Taylors' School, founded in 1561. There, with Edmund Spenser and Lancelot Andrewes among others, he would have been taught by the famous schoolmaster, humanist intellectual, and educational theorist Richard Mulcaster. Blount read and wrote Latin and Italian, and an early aptitude and interest in reading may explain why, on 24 June 1578, he began an association with the Stationers' Company that lasted fifty-four years. Having been apprenticed on 24 June 1578 and freed on 25 June 1588, he acquired his own first apprentice in 1595, rose to the company's livery on 10 May 1611, was elected an assistant on 25 October 1625, and served on the court of assistants until December 1630. During most and perhaps all of that time, he lived and worked in St Paul's Churchyard, the centre of the retail book trade, first as an apprentice at the Bishop's Head, later in his own shop at the Black Bear (1609&#150;27). His friends were other booksellers: in 1600 Thomas Thorpe dedicated Marlowe's translation of Lucan to &#145;his kind and true friend, Edward Blount&#146;, and Thorpe and Blount were still drinking partners in the 1620s  (<span class="italic">Lucans First Book</span>, sig. A2<i>r</i>). Even his wife was the widow of another stationer: Elizabeth Royden married Richard Banckworth in 1595, and was granted administration of his estate on 11 April 1614. Blount married her before 1618.<br>
<br>Blount had been apprenticed for ten years (not the usual seven) to William Ponsonby, described by McKerrow as &#145;the most important publisher of the Elizabethan period&#146;  (McKerrow, 39). Ponsonby published almost all the work of Edmund Spenser and Sir Philip Sidney; he pioneered commercial exploitation of a developing market for contemporary vernacular literature, and Blount&#151;the most important publisher of the early seventeenth century&#151;followed in his master's footsteps. But Blount did not inherit Ponsonby's shop, or his priorities. By contrast with most early modern stationers (including Ponsonby), Blount was a remarkably secular bookseller. For instance, until he formed a business partnership with William Barrett (1609&#150;13), he did not publish a single sermon, although that genre was popular and profitable.<br>
<br>The first book Blount published did not appear until six years after he was freed of his apprenticeship: Josuah Sylvester's <span class="italic">The Profit of Imprisonment</span> (1594), a French poem translated by an English merchant living in the Low Countries. (Sylvester was then unknown; his translations of Du Bartas, in part published by Blount, would eventually make him one of the English writers most admired by his contemporaries.) Blount's second publication was Charles Tessier's <span class="italic">Le premier livre de chansons</span> (1597), a book of French and Italian songs; his third was John Florio's Italian&#150;English dictionary, <span class="italic">A Worlde of Wordes</span> (1598). The cosmopolitan ambition of these first three books was characteristic of Blount's career: he published European histories and European travel books; dictionaries of Italian, Spanish, and Latin; and works translated out of French, Italian, Spanish, Dutch, Greek, Latin, and neo-Latin.<br>
<br>Blount also developed relationships with English ambassadors abroad. Between 27 October 1613 and 25 January 1620, the name Ned Blunt appears repeatedly in John Chamberlain's letters to Sir Dudley Carleton, ambassador to Venice (1610&#150;15) and The Hague (1616&#150;25). Three documents, signed by Blount between 15 June 1614 and 23 June 1615, show him involved in Carleton's efforts to deliver Italian works of art for the collection of his new patron, Robert Carr. The Blount&#150;Carleton connection links the book trade with international commercial networks in art objects, currencies, cloth, seeds, and foodstuffs. More interesting as human documents are Blount's five surviving letters, written between 15 June 1621 and 9 May 1623, to William Trumbull, English agent in Brussels. They establish that Blount also sold manuscripts and banned books, and document his &#145;neerenesse of freindship&#146; with his fellow stationer John Bill (Sir Thomas Bodley's agent in acquiring books printed abroad) and at least two authors whose work he published, the Italophile Sir Robert Dallington and the Hispanophile James Mabbe  (BL, Add. MS 72361/116). Another of his authors, Leonard Digges, was sending a package &#145;to Ned Blounte&#146; in a letter from Oxford written on 30 January 1631  (BL, Lansdowne MS 841, fol. 30<i>v</i>).<br>
<br>Blount was the chief publisher&#151;listed on the title-page alongside the printer Isaac Jaggard&#151;of the first folio edition of Shakespeare's <span class="italic">Comedies, Histories, and Tragedies</span> (with commendatory verses by his friends Mabbe and Digges). He also published Shakespeare's &#145;The Phoenix and the Turtle&#146;, Marlowe's <span class="italic">Hero and Leander</span>, and the first essays of Thomas Hobbes; the first (and still most admired) English translations of Montaigne's essays, Cervantes' <span class="italic">Don Quixote</span>, and Matteo Aleman's picaresque classic <span class="italic">Guzman de Alfarache</span>, as well as <span class="italic">Naturall and Morall Historie of the East and West Indies</span>, after the original by Jos&eacute; de Acosta, &#145;the most original and influential of all histories of the New World&#146;  (Grafton, 207), and <span class="italic">Of Wisdom</span>, a translation of Pierre Charron's banned &#145;scandalous book&#146;, one of the foundational texts of post-Christian philosophical atheism  (Gregory, 87); significant literary texts by George Chapman, John Earle, Joseph Hall, Ben Jonson, and John Lyly; and Samuel Daniel's <span class="italic">Defence of Rhyme</span>, the most important work of English literary criticism written between Sidney's <span class="italic">Apology</span> and Dryden's <span class="italic">Of Drammatick Poesie</span>.<br>
<br>Blount probably translated the works that he published and dedicated as Tomasso Garzoni's <span class="italic">Hospitall of Incurable Fooles</span> (1600) and Lorenzo Ducci's <span class="italic">Ars aulica, or, The Courtier's Arte</span> (1607). He also signed prefaces to nine other books, including <span class="italic">Hero and Leander</span> (1598), in which he called Christopher Marlowe his &#145;friend&#146; and described himself as &#145;executor&#146; of Marlowe's &#145;intellectual will&#146;  (sig. A3<i>r</i>), and <span class="italic">Sixe Court Comedies</span> (1632), which praises the wit and originality of John Lyly&#151;&#145;The <i>Lyre</i> he played on, had no borrowed strings&#146;  (sig. A3<i>v</i>). This last preface acknowledges that Blount himself is &#145;no executor, yet I presume to distribute the Goods of the Dead&#146;  (ibid.).<br>
<br>Blount's own goods were soon to be so distributed. By October 1632 he was dead, and on 3 October 1636 his widow sold his remaining copyrights to Andrew Crooke. But his real heirs were the two seventeenth-century publishers who, from Blount, took up the task of shaping the English literary canon: Humphrey Moseley and Jacob Tonson.<br>
