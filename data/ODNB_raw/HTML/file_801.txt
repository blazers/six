<span class="headword">Askham,  John</span>  (1825&#150;1894), <span class="occ">shoemaker and poet</span>, was born on 20 or 25 July 1825, in a cottage off Market Street, adjoining White Horse Yard, in Wellingborough, Northamptonshire, the youngest among the seven children of John Askham, a shoemaker from Raunds, and his wife, who was originally from Kimbolton. The young Askham was educated at a dame-school for a brief period, and then went to the Wellingborough free school. His formal education was limited, as he noted later in life: &#145;I have no recollections of learning anything, my most vivid remembrance being of having to stand up with my legs straddled out to their fullest extent in a window recess, with a tall fool's cap on my devoted head.&#146; Before he was ten Askham was put to work at his father's trade, working long hours during which he recalled that although &#145;nothing but one long, unbroken perspective of toil&#146; had presented itself, he had nevertheless &#145;ever cherished a deep love for poetry&#146;  (<span class="italic">Wellingborough News</span>, October 1934). He was largely self-educated, and was to become a well-known working-class poet.<br>
<br>Askham married Hannah Bonham (1822/3&#150;1860) in the late 1840s, and they had five children, two of whom died in childhood. A few years after his marriage, at twenty-five, he began to write and publish poetry in earnest. He contributed poems to the <span class="italic">Wellingborough Independent</span>, and the quality of these greatly impressed the editor of the <span class="italic">Northampton Mercury</span>, G. J. de Wilde, who consequently hired Askham as a correspondent for his paper, and also became a good friend. Askham had been urged to write his first verses by a workmate who was a vehement Chartist, but Askham himself never subscribed to Chartism proper, although he fervently advocated the rights and worth of the working classes. This can be seen in the poem that he published first: &#145;The Dignity of Labour&#146;. Askham's first collected volume of verse, <span class="italic">Sonnets on the Months, and other Poems</span> (1863), was &#145;composed for the most part in the comparative quiet of the warehouse of a shoe upper manufactory&#146;, whereas the pace and concerns of the second volume, <span class="italic">Descriptive Poems</span> (1866), reflect its genesis &#145;in the ceaseless din of twenty machines in the factory of Messers Singer&#146;  (<span class="italic">Wellingborough News</span>, October 1934). One of his most effective social poems was entitled &#145;The Singers&#146;, and refers to his time working for the sewing machine manufacturers.<br>
<br>Askham eventually left Singers &amp; Co. and went into the shoemaking business for himself. He continued to write poetry, furthering his reputation in the region, where increasingly he became known as &#145;the Shoemaker Poet&#146;. All his books were published by subscription, and it was shortly after the publication of <span class="italic">Judith, and other Poems</span> (1868) that one of his subscribers, George Ward Hunt, arranged for Askham to receive a grant of &pound;50 from the queen's bounty fund. <span class="italic">Poems and Sonnets</span> followed in 1875, and his final volume, <span class="italic">Sketches in Prose and Verse</span>, appeared in 1893. Askham cited John Clare as a particular influence on his poetry, and this is reflected in his early sonnet &#145;To John Clare&#146;. The fidelity of Askham's nature poetry has been much praised, particularly as he lacked Clare's opportunities for appreciating country life.<br>
<br>Askham was also very much involved in the life of his village community; he co-founded the Wellingborough Literary Institute, and became librarian and hall-keeper when it was established in the newly built corn exchange. He was elected a member of the first school board of the town in 1871, and in 1874 he became school attendance officer. Between 1875 and 1887 he served as sanitary inspector of the local board of health. He was forced to retire from these occupations in 1887 because of ill health, and in his later years he was stricken with paralysis.<br>
<br>Askham died on 28 October 1894 at Clare Cottage, 76 High Street, Hardingstone, near Northampton, and was buried on 1 November in the London Road cemetery, Wellingborough. He was survived by his second wife, Rebecca Eliza, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Cox (1846&#150;1918), and by three daughters from his first marriage: Mrs Elizabeth Smith, Mrs Alice Douglas, and Mrs Spencer.<br>
