<span class="headword">Giffard,  Henry</span>  (1694&#150;1772), <span class="occ">actor and theatre manager</span>, the youngest of the eight sons of William Giffard (<i>d</i>. 1722) of Buckinghamshire, was born in London and educated at a private school. In 1716 he found employment as a clerk in the South Sea Company, but after three years he abandoned this position, moved to Bath, and joined an itinerant group of actors. About a year later he moved to the Smock Alley Theatre, Dublin, where he took a number of major roles, including Valentine in William Congreve's <span class="italic">Love for Love</span> and Sir Charles in Colley Cibber's <span class="italic">The Careless Husband</span>. Giffard's importance to the company at Smock Alley led to his being offered a part share in the management. While in Dublin he married Mary (Molly) Lyddal, an actress in the company. In either 1726 or 1727 she gave birth to a son, William, and a year later she died while giving birth to a daughter. In 1728 Giffard married Mary's sister, Anna Marcella (Nancy) Lyddal. The couple then moved to London, where they joined the company of Thomas Odell, who had recently opened a theatre at Goodman's Fields.<br>
<br>Giffard made his London d&eacute;but as Plume in George Farquhar's <span class="italic">The Recruiting Officer</span>, and he went on to play a number of leading roles in the 1729&#150;30 season. His wife Nancy also made her London d&eacute;but around this time, and the two often appeared on stage together. Their roles as a dramatic couple included those of Bevil Junior and Indiana in Richard Steele's <span class="italic">The Conscious Lovers</span> and Altamont and Calista in Nicholas Rowe's <span class="italic">The Fair Penitent</span>. Following Odell's decision to relinquish control of Goodman's Fields in 1731, Giffard took over the management. He quickly drew up plans to erect a second, more spacious theatre near the site of the first, meeting the cost of over &pound;2000 through a number of individual subscriptions. The new theatre, designed by Edward Shepherd, opened on 2 October 1732 with a performance of <span class="italic">1 Henry IV</span>. As well as managing the theatre, Giffard made regular appearances on stage until the end of the 1735&#150;6 season, playing parts as diverse as Jaffeir in Thomas Otway's <span class="italic">Venice Preserv'd</span> and Loveless in John Vanbrugh's <span class="italic">The Relapse</span>. In September 1733, while still managing the theatre at Goodman's Fields, he purchased a share in the theatre at Drury Lane, and appeared on stage there several times at the beginning of the 1733&#150;4 season before selling his share to Charles Fleetwood. In the summer of 1735 he toured Ireland with the company of the Aungier Street Theatre, Dublin.<br>
<br>In the autumn of 1736 Henry and Nancy Giffard moved to the vacant Theatre Royal at Lincoln's Inn Fields. In order to fill this older, larger house, Giffard offered subscribers the chance to purchase books of twenty tickets &#145;at half the expense&#146;  (<span class="italic">Daily Post</span>, 19 Nov 1736). He made only occasional appearances as an actor during the 1736&#150;7 season, the majority of his time being taken up by the management of the theatre. In December 1736 he found himself in dispute with E. D. Cole, a dancer in the Drury Lane company. Cole accused him of causing a disturbance in the Drury Lane audience during a performance of <span class="italic">Tiddi-Doll</span>, a burlesque featuring Cole's daughter. Giffard rejected the charge. Gifford's counter-accusation, that Cole had employed a number of people to hiss performances at Lincoln's Inn Fields, was similarly denied.<br>
<br>In May 1737 Giffard attempted to sell his interest in Goodman's Fields. However, the simultaneous introduction of Walpole's <span class="roman">Licensing Act</span> made the sale impossible. Walpole, who believed himself to have been unfairly lampooned by Fielding's players at the New Haymarket, found an ingenious way of persuading George II of the merits of the <span class="roman">Licensing Act</span>. He commissioned a two-act anti-government play, <span class="italic">The Vision of the Golden Rump</span>, and made sure that it found its way to Giffard at Lincoln's Inn. Giffard refused to stage the piece, but mistakenly attempted to earn Walpole's favour by surrendering the play to the government. Walpole was able to present the play to George II as the work of an anonymous player, and the king's fury was such that the <span class="roman">Licensing Act</span> was pressed through parliament with ease. The act prohibited the staging of theatrical performances in London beyond the confines of the city of Westminster, a measure that rendered Giffard's theatre at Goodman's Fields useless.<br>
<br>In June 1737 the Giffards left London to join the Smock Alley company in Dublin. The following summer Henry Giffard sold off the scenery, props, and costumes belonging to the theatre at Goodman's Fields. In autumn 1738 the Giffards accompanied the Smock Alley players on a tour of Carlow and Drogheda, and in the winter of the same year Henry Giffard led a company to Edinburgh. In March 1739, however, the Giffards returned to London, where they rejoined the company at Drury Lane. A year later Giffard successfully petitioned the lord chamberlain for permission to reopen the theatre at Goodman's Fields. He ran the theatre for two seasons, taking advantage of the summer break in 1741 to take his company to Ipswich.<br>
<br>Although by no means a great actor himself, Giffard was a keen student of the theatre and a diligent coach of his fellow players. His insistence upon the importance of thorough rehearsals brought the best out of the young actors in his company, chief among them David Garrick. In October 1741 Giffard gave Garrick his London d&eacute;but in the title role of Shakespeare's <span class="italic">Richard III</span>. For the 1742&#150;3 season he returned to Lincoln's Inn Fields, but without the attraction of Garrick the theatre quickly began to lose money, and the company was soon disbanded. In the autumn of 1743 the Giffards joined the company at Drury Lane for a third time, where they remained until the summer of 1747. Henry Giffard's final performance, as Aimwell in Farquhar's <span class="italic">The Beaux' Stratagem</span>, was given at Covent Garden on 7 October 1748. Four days later Nancy Giffard made her final stage appearance, as Lady Fanciful in Vanbrugh's <span class="italic">The Provoked Wife</span>. Following their retirement from the stage the couple moved to New Brentford, Middlesex, where they lived for over twenty years. Henry Giffard died there on 20 October 1772, and was buried in the local cemetery five days later. He was survived by Nancy Giffard, who died on 21 January 1777.<br>
<br>William Giffard, Henry Giffard's son by his first wife, also made a career from the stage. He appeared as a child at Goodman's Fields in the early 1730s, and made his adult d&eacute;but at the same theatre in the 1740&#150;41 season. He remained at Goodman's Fields for two years before moving with his father to the theatre at Lincoln's Inn. William Giffard's final London performance was on 5 May 1744, after which he appeared exclusively in the regional theatres. He finally retired from the stage towards the end of the 1760s, and died at Cockermouth, Cumberland, in 1807.<br>
