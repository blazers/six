<span class="headword">Wood, Sir  Robert Stanford</span>  (1886&#150;1963), <span class="occ">civil servant and educationist</span>, was born in Islington, London, on 5 July 1886, the younger son of the Revd John Roskruge Wood, Baptist minister, and his wife, Frances Ann Wren. He was educated at the City of London School and at Jesus College, Cambridge, where in 1908 he obtained first-class honours in part one of the classical tripos and, the following year, second-class honours in part two of the historical tripos. After two years of teaching, mainly at Nottingham High School for Boys, and of serving as a scout commissioner, Wood joined the Board of Education in 1911 as an inspector of schools. In 1922 he married Iris Cecilie, daughter of Frederick Arnsby, piano manufacturer, with whom he had a daughter. During the inter-war years Wood rose through the ranks of the civil service to be principal private secretary to the president of the board, Lord Eustace Percy (1926&#150;8), director of establishments (1928&#150;36), and principal assistant secretary for technical education (1936&#150;40).<br>
<br>In 1938 Wood was seconded for special service with Sir John Anderson (later Viscount Waverley), then lord privy seal and later home secretary, working on matters relating to home security in the event of war. In 1940 he returned to the Board of Education as deputy secretary (Maurice Holmes being secretary), an appointment which he held for six years. When almost all the board's staff moved to Bournemouth during the blitz, Wood remained in London to provide support to the president, Herwald Ramsbotham. In October 1940 he joined an informal committee of senior Board of Education officials which discussed plans for educational reconstruction. They produced a pamphlet, <span class="italic">Education after the War</span> (1941), widely referred to as the &#145;green book&#146;, which was circulated among educational bodies. Wood contributed an important paper, &#145;Partnership in education&#146;, which contended that the board should reassert itself in relation to local education authorities and should take the lead in forming policy. His note to the committee of 20 November 1940 contained &#145;most of the more important changes in the school system which were to be made after 1944&#146;  (Gosden, 242). It proposed the raising of the school-leaving age to fifteen and the replacement of the existing distinction between elementary and grammar schools with a new, age-based division between primary schools (catering for five- to eleven-year-olds) and a tripartite system of secondary schools for those aged over eleven.<br>
<br>From July 1941 R. A. Butler, Ramsbotham's successor as president, worked closely with Wood, who was made KBE in that year. Butler was anxious to support his senior civil servants' proposals for educational reform, and he consulted Wood on technical education and the relations between schools and industry. Wood played a key role in determining the membership and terms of reference for Sir Arnold McNair's wartime inquiry into teacher training and for Sir Cyril Norwood's committee on the secondary school curriculum and examinations. During the first part of 1943 much of Wood's time was consumed by developing ideas and drafting proposals on further education that featured in the white paper <span class="italic">Educational Reconstruction</span>, and which subsequently formed an important part of the 1944 <span class="roman">Education Act</span>. Wood also chaired an office committee on the post-war emergency recruitment and training of teachers and, over the winter of 1943&#150;4, was the principal speaker at a series of Board of Education conferences intended to justify the controversial introduction of the one-year teacher training scheme. Some of those who attended these meetings were sceptical about his assurances that emergency-trained teachers could expect professional parity with colleagues trained for two years in permanent colleges and graduate teachers emerging from universities. The experience of operating the scheme tended to confirm these doubts, but Wood's achievement in developing an initiative that produced 35,000 additional teachers between 1945 and 1951 was nevertheless considerable.<br>
<br>By the terms of the 1944 act, the board became the Ministry of Education and, upon the retirement of Sir Maurice Holmes in 1945, it was widely expected that Wood would become permanent secretary. This did not happen, possibly because of objections from Ellen Wilkinson, the Labour minister of education. Disappointed, Wood departed from the ministry in 1946 to succeed Kenneth Vickers as principal of Southampton University College. Having over many years become acquainted with some of the college's strengths, ambitions, and constraints, especially in the areas of technical education and teacher training, he was well qualified to lead the drive for university status, a task that was accomplished within five years.<br>
<br>Wood made the acquisition of new buildings and equipment a priority, although the building programme had to be carried through not only in the face of the usual post-war difficulties but in a town which also needed to replace the port, the thousands of houses, and the industrial buildings destroyed during the war. He continued his predecessor's policy of providing halls of residence for students, one of the main objects of his principalship being that the university should be a body of scholars leading a communal life. During his six years at Southampton, student numbers almost doubled, considerable funds were raised for development, and close contact was established with the educational authorities of both Southampton and Hampshire. A major development was the establishment of an institute of education with a circle of affiliated training colleges. In conjunction with Lillian Penson, vice-chancellor of London University (for whose external degrees Southampton students were then prepared), he developed the idea of a &#145;special relationship&#146; with the University of London, which culminated in 1952 in the granting of a full university charter to Southampton. Wood became Southampton's first vice-chancellor but he retired on grounds of age at the end of the session.<br>
<br>Wood was made an honorary fellow of Jesus College, Cambridge, in 1952, and was also an honorary member of the Goldsmiths' Company of London. In 1955 he visited Palestine and Iraq to lecture on British universities for the British Council. He died at his home, 104 Iverna Court, London, on 18 May 1963.<br>
