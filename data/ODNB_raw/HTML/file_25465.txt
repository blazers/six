<span class="headword">Shortland,  John</span>  (1769&#150;1810), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, born on 5 September 1769, was the elder son of Commander John Shortland (1736&#150;1804), with whom he has sometimes been confused; he was the elder brother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25467/', "Thomas George Shortland (1771&#150;1827)")</script>. He entered the navy in 1781 under his father, then employed in transport service to and from North America. He was afterwards in the <i>Surprise</i>, and from 1783 to 1787 in the frigate <i>Latona</i> in the West Indies. On his return to England in 1787 he joined the <i>Sirius</i> (Captain John Hunter) and in her went out to New South Wales, made the voyage to the Cape of Good Hope, and was wrecked at Norfolk Island, from where he returned to England with Hunter in April 1792. On 10 October 1793 he was promoted lieutenant of the <i>Arrogant</i>, and in 1795 he was selected by Hunter as first lieutenant of the discovery vessel <i>Reliance</i>, in which Hunter was going out as governor of New South Wales. As Hunter's duties detained him on shore, Shortland was in acting command of the ship, in which he made several voyages to the Cape of Good Hope, Tahiti, and New Zealand. He was granted land in Australia but returned to England with Hunter in 1801, and, having been promoted commander on 1 January 1801, he was appointed transport agent for the expedition to Egypt. The following year he commanded the cutter <i>Dolphin</i>, from which he was moved to the sloop <i>Trompeuse</i> (18 guns) going out to the Guinea coast, where, on a death vacancy, he was promoted captain of the <i>Squirrel</i> (24 guns). On his return to England his commission as captain was confirmed, to date from 6 August 1805. He was then sent out to the Halifax station, where, in February 1809, he was transferred to the frigate <i>Junon</i> (36 guns). In September he sailed for the West Indies, being then a hundred men short of complement, and on 13 December fell in with four large frigates sailing under Spanish colours. They proved able to answer the private signals, and Shortland consequently stood towards them to gain intelligence of the enemy. But, when the <i>Junon</i> was well within gunshot, they struck the Spanish colours, hoisted French, and poured in their broadsides. Notwithstanding the odds against him he defended his ship with the utmost gallantry until he was carried below, dangerously wounded. The <i>Junon</i>, which had lost ninety men killed and wounded, was then boarded and captured, but she was such a complete wreck that she was cleared out and set on fire. Shortland had both legs and his left arm shattered, and also had a severe wound in his side, and others less serious. His mangled body was taken on one of the French frigates and was afterwards sent, 13 miles in a canoe under a blazing sun, to the hospital at Guadeloupe, where he died, unmarried, on 21 January 1810 and where he was buried at Basse Terre with military honours.<br>
