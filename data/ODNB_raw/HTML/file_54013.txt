<span class="headword">Nugent,  James</span>  (1822&#150;1905), <span class="occ">social reformer and Roman Catholic priest</span>, was born on 3 March 1822 at Hunter Street, Liverpool, the eldest of nine children, three boys and six girls, of John Nugent, fruiterer, and his wife, Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Rice (1803&#150;1887). He was baptized a Catholic at St Nicholas's Church on 17 March. His father was a Catholic from co. Meath and his mother was a convert to Roman Catholicism. On the completion of his education at a private academy in Queen Square, Liverpool, from about 1827 to 1837, his father's ambition for him to be a merchant was overruled by his devout mother and the local priest who encouraged him to enter the priesthood.<br>
<br>Trained at St Cuthbert's College, Ushaw (1838&#150;42), and the English College in Rome (1843&#150;6), Nugent was ordained at his local church of St Nicholas's, Liverpool, on 30 August 1846. His first ministry was at St Alban's, Blackburn, and then at St Mary's, Wigan (March to December 1848). He then moved back to Liverpool, in the midst of a crisis of poverty and disease, where ten out of twenty-four priests had died, and where the Irish immigrants needed hope and a brighter future.<br>
<br>Nugent's whole life was given to the task. As an educationist he opened on 7 November 1850 a Catholic middle school for boys in Rodney Street, and by 31 October 1853 had opened the Catholic Institute, becoming its first director. He served the educational needs of both children and adults for the next ten years and set the tone which was to be followed by his successors.<br>
<br>Nugent felt the need to look after street children, whom he called nobody's children, his slogan being &#145;Save the child&#146;. He set up shelters, training schools (one on the River Mersey), and residential homes. Later, he assisted a large number of the children to emigrate to the New World. He became the pioneer of children's emigration and travelled extensively in the USA on a mission which was encouraged by Archbishop Ireland, a fervent colonizer. Some of the schemes were total failures, such as the attempt of 1882 to settle poor families from Ireland on farms in Minnesota.<br>
<br>As the first Catholic chaplain at Walton gaol (appointed under the act of 1863) Nugent saw how drink made men and women criminals, and he established the Total Abstinence League of the Cross, a movement which spread to India, America, and Australia. He also saw the potential of the press, and in 1861 established a printing press that produced newspapers including the <span class="italic">Northern Press</span> (renamed the <span class="italic">Catholic Times</span> in 1872), which soon had a circulation of 73,000.<br>
<br>At the time Nugent retired in 1885 he was still extremely active, travelling extensively and overseeing the building of new churches such as St Joseph's, Blundelsands. Honours came his way: he was created a monsignor in 1892, was given a testimonial by Liverpool city council in 1897, and his portrait by Sir James Shannon, later based in the Walker Art Gallery, was painted. On a return journey from New York in 1903 he had a serious fall. His health declined and two years later a chill which he caught in Southport turned to pneumonia. He died at Harewood, Duke Street, Freshfield Road, Formby, on 27 June 1905 and was buried at Ford cemetery, Liverpool, on 30 June. Ten thousand mourners gathered for his funeral. A statue to his memory was unveiled on 8 December 1906 and placed in St John's Gardens, Liverpool.<br>
