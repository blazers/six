<span class="headword">Bowtell <span class="st"> [Boutel; <em>n&eacute;e </em>Davenport]</span>,  Elizabeth</span>  (1648/9&#150;1714/15), <span class="occ">actress</span>, was the second daughter of Christopher Davenport and his wife, Frances Ridley. Some time after October 1669 she married Barnaby Bowtell, one of ten children of Barnaby Bowtell of Parham Hall, Suffolk. Mrs Bowtell's husband was commissioned a lieutenant in the Holland regiment of William III on 2 December 1681, a position he retained until 24 January 1705.<br>
<br>The beginnings of Mrs Bowtell's career are hazy. John Downes suggests that she began acting &#145;some few Years after&#146; the Restoration, and he lists her in three revivals of pre-Commonwealth plays, all most likely produced during the 1663/4 season. Certainly by 1667 Elizabeth Davenport (as she then was) was an active member of the King's Company: in March she played the exuberant ing&eacute;nue Sabina in Dryden's <span class="italic">Secret Love</span>. Her career spanned three decades. After 1678 she left the stage for ten years, claiming during that time to have lived &#145;in a Monastery in France where shee was a Pensioner&#146;  (Milhous, 126). She returned to London in spring 1688, performing with the United Company until 1690. In 1692 she surfaced in a Benedictine convent in Paris  (Highfill, Burnim &amp; Langhans, <span class="italic">BDA</span>, 2.261). By the autumn of 1695 Mrs Bowtell was acting with Thomas Betterton's new company at Lincoln's Inn Fields, but she appears to have left the stage permanently after November 1697 to join her husband in the Netherlands. She spent her final years in Middlesex, a prosperous widow who benefited from inheritances on both sides of her family and perhaps from liaisons with lovers.<br>
<br>Mrs Bowtell was a talented actress, popular with audiences and dramatists alike. Dryden wrote several roles for her, aside from Sabina in <span class="italic">Secret Love</span>: Donna Theodosia in <span class="italic">An Evening's Love</span> (1668); Benzayda in <span class="italic">The Conquest of Granada</span> (1670/1671); Melantha in <span class="italic">Marriage a-la-mode</span> (1671); Laura in <span class="italic">The Assignation</span> (1672); and Cleopatra in <span class="italic">All for Love</span> (1677). William Wycherley gave her two of his greatest female roles, Margery Pinchwife in <span class="italic">The Country Wife</span> (1675) and Fidelia in <span class="italic">The Plain Dealer</span> (1676). Other notable Restoration playwrights, such as Thomas Shadwell, Nathaniel Lee, and Thomas D'Urfey also created roles for Mrs Bowtell, while still others commented upon her skill. In the dedication to his play <span class="italic">The Roman Empress</span> (1671) William Joyner praised her performance as Aurelia, &#145;which, though a great, various, and difficult part, was excellently performed&#146;  (sig. A2<i>v</i>).<br>
<br>Whether deserved or not, Mrs Bowtell had a reputation for promiscuity. One lampoon called her &#145;chestnut-maned Boutell, whom all the Town fucks&#146;  (Wilson, <span class="italic">Court Satires</span>, 206). Edmund Curll, in his memoir of Thomas Betterton, noted that &#145;besides what she saved by Playing, the Generosity of some happy Lovers enabled her to quit the Stage before she grew old&#146;  (Curll, 21). Her stage roles also capitalized on her sexual appeal. In Thomas Duffett's play, <span class="italic">The Spanish Rogue</span> (London, 1674), her character is told she should &#145;know, you'r beauty can Command so large a pow'r ore any heart&#146;  (ibid., 16). Curll says &#145;she was low of Stature, had very agreeable Features, a good Complexion, but a Childish Look. Her Voice was weak, tho' very mellow; she generally acted <i>the young Innocent Lady</i> whom all the Heroes are mad in Love with&#146;  (ibid., 21). This latter statement best describes the roles of her youth. After 1670 Mrs Bowtell turned to a wider range of parts: cuckolding wives and tragic heroines, especially meek, virtuous women caught up by larger forces, such as Cyara in Lee's <span class="italic">The Tragedy of Nero</span> (1674). Several times she was coupled with Rebecca Marshall, who played the villainess to Bowtell's innocent. Mrs Bowtell nevertheless continued to play youthful roles, including breeches parts, through her forties. Clara in Joseph Harris's play <span class="italic">The City Bride</span> (1696) is an unmarried young woman, and Mrs Fantast in Shadwell's <span class="italic">Bury-Fair</span> (1689) is the &#145;Daughter to my Lady Fantast by a Former Husband&#146;. She also played parts more suitable to her age: Aurelia in Thomas D'Urfey's <span class="italic">A Fool's Preferment</span> (1688) is a basset-playing wife who &#145;rules&#146; her &#145;half-witted Country-Gentleman&#146; husband.<br>
<br>Mrs Bowtell's life was not without hardship: her sister Frances Davenport, also an actress with the King's Company in its early years (Pepys on 7 April 1668 called her &#145;a very bad actor&#146;; Pepys, 9.156), died insane in 1696; and Mrs Bowtell was caught up in several legal disputes. Her final years, however, bespeak a fate more clement than that faced by some seventeenth-century actresses. She died between 2 November 1714, when she made her will, in which she was able to leave bequests worth &pound;830 and in which she asked to be buried at Winchester, and 1 September 1715, when it was proved.<br>
