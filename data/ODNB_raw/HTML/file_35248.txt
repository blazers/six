<span class="headword">Norgate,  Kate</span>  (1853&#150;1935), <span class="occ">historian</span>, was born in St Pancras, London, on 8 December 1853, the only child of Frederick Norgate, bookseller, later a partner in the firm of Messrs Williams and Norgate, and his wife, Fanny, daughter of John Athow, stonemason and surveyor of the Norwich city pavements. Her grandfather <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20254/', "Thomas Starling Norgate")</script>, a friend of William Taylor (1765&#150;1836), gave her a link with the active literary group that throve in Norwich in the first half of the nineteenth century. When Norgate became the prot&eacute;g&eacute;e of the historian John Richard Green, she was ready to use to the full the opportunities that he gave her. Green encouraged her to devote herself to a history of the Angevins. By 1877 she had already made some progress with her first book. Her mother is said to have accompanied her to the British Museum and to have sat by her in the reading-room. <span class="italic">England under the Angevin Kings</span>, in two volumes, was published in 1887, four years after Green's death. Its merits were recognized at once: E. A. Freeman wrote a long appreciation of it in the <span class="italic">English Historical Review</span> (vol. 2, 1887). Norgate's mastery of the original sources showed critical skill and found expression in a clear narrative. If she was influenced by Green's strong preference for the chronicles and avoided unpublished material, including the generally uncatalogued manuscript sources in the Public Record Office, she did not share his deliberate indifference to records and used them assiduously in her later studies. Her work reveals her extensive knowledge and accurate rendition of the printed sources then available for a history of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. In addition, Norgate stressed the importance of topography and travelled extensively, especially in Anjou, in support of her work. Self-trained, yet scholarly in her approach to research, Norgate represented a transition point in the professionalization of women historians.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">England under the Angevin Kings</span> carried her narrative to 1206. It was continued in <span class="italic">John Lackland</span> (1902) and <span class="italic">The Minority of Henry the Third</span> (1912). In <span class="italic">Richard the Lion Heart</span> (1924) Norgate retraced her steps to follow the life of Richard I, as a hero of the Christian West. All three books are well-arranged, spirited narratives. At the time, they were the best available history of the Angevin empire, and were well received by contemporaries. They are still occasionally cited by scholars today. Steeped in the historical controversies of her day, Norgate joined with her friend Thomas Andrew Archer in a passionate defence of Freeman against the attacks of J. H. Round  (<span class="italic">English Historical Review</span>, 9, 1894). Of her critical studies, the most important are her defence of the authenticity of Adrian IV's bull <span class="italic">Laudabiliter</span>  (<span class="italic">English Historical Review</span>, 8, 1893), and her consideration of the alleged condemnation of King John by the French court in 1202  (<span class="italic">Transactions of the Royal Historical Society</span>, new ser., 14, 1900). Her work elicited critical attention from historians such as Round, another indication of the growing importance of women in the historical field.<br>
<br>In these early years Norgate was very active: she contributed forty-four entries to the <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span>, collaborated with Alice Stopford Green in the preparation of the illustrated edition of Green's <span class="italic">Short History of the English People</span> (1892&#150;4), and worked on her next book in the society of learned friends such as William Hunt. Her historical contributions were later recognized by Somerville College, Oxford, which in 1929 elected her an honorary fellow. She died unmarried at her home, Jasmine Cottage, 2 Church Lane, Gorleston, Great Yarmouth, on 17 April 1935, and was fittingly described in her <span class="italic">Times</span> obituary as the &#145;most learned woman historian of the pre-academic period&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 6 May 1935).<br>
