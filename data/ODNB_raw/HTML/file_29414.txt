<span class="headword">Wilkie,  William</span>  (1721&#150;1772), <span class="occ">Church of Scotland minister and poet</span>, was born on 5 October 1721, the son of James Wilkie, a farmer at Echlin in the parish of Dalmeny, 10 miles north-west of Edinburgh. He was educated at the local school and then at the University of Edinburgh, where he studied arts and prepared for the ministry in association with the William Robertson circle of young clergymen of letters. His father's death during his student days obliged him to run the family farm, 2 miles west of Edinburgh, for the benefit of his three unmarried sisters, and farming would continue to be his primary occupation for eight years after obtaining his licence to preach from the presbytery of Linlithgow on 29 May 1745. In September 1745 he enlisted in the college company, formed to defend Edinburgh from the Jacobite army of Charles Edward Stuart, but he never saw action in that conflict. He was befriended by a neighbour, George Lind, the sheriff-substitute of Edinburghshire, who introduced him to the third duke of Argyll, Lord Milton, and the earl of Lauderdale, patron of the nearby parish of Ratho. Thanks to Lauderdale, Wilkie was called to Ratho on 15 February 1753 and was ordained as assistant; he became successor three months later, finally becoming the sole minister there after the death of the aged incumbent, John Guthrie, on 28 February 1756. At Ratho he used sophisticated enclosures and drainage systems to increase yields from the glebe allotted to the minister, and he founded the Husbandry Club for rural improvement.<br>
<br>In late May 1757 Wilkie published anonymously in Edinburgh, with a dedication to Argyll, the <span class="italic">Epigoniad</span>, a long, ponderous epic that was harshly criticized in the London reviews as well as in a pamphlet, <span class="italic">A Critical Essay on the &#145;Epigoniad&#146;</span>. Among his Scottish admirers, however, the epic earned him the epithet the Scottish Homer, just as his lifelong passion for agricultural improvement spawned such nicknames as Potato Wilkie and the Potato Minister. Blaming the failure of the <span class="italic">Epigoniad</span> on the prejudice of English readers and a conspiracy of English booksellers, Wilkie's friend David Hume encouraged the publication of a second edition in London early in 1759, and he praised it in the April issue of the <span class="italic">Critical Review</span>. The title-page of the second edition identifies Wilkie as the author and calls the work &#145;carefully corrected and improved&#146;, meaning the deletion of Scotticisms and some self-serving critical remarks about Pope in the preface, and the addition of &#145;A Dream, in the Manner of Spenser&#146;. But the second edition also sold poorly, and the surplus stock was reissued ten years later with two different cancelled title-pages.<br>
<br>Wilkie took an interest in geometry and history as well as poetry, and his scientific ability, along with the influence of Professor Robert Watson, helped him to win election to the chair of natural philosophy at the University of St Andrews in July 1759, after several unsuccessful attempts to obtain academic positions at Glasgow and Aberdeen. He was admitted to the university on 12 November and resigned his clerical charge at Ratho three days later. Although he never published in his academic field, he acquitted himself well in the classroom, focusing his attention on scientific principles of agriculture, which he practised on a few acres of farmland that he purchased in the vicinity of St Andrews. In late March 1768 he is believed to have interceded with Principal William Tullidelph to reinstate the future Scots poet Robert Fergusson after the principal had expelled him for a prank. Shortly after this event Wilkie published in London his second book of poetry, <span class="italic">Fables</span>, with a dedication to the earl of Lauderdale. Declaring himself a little &#145;disappointed&#146; after reading this work, James Beattie wondered, in a letter of 1 July 1768, how &#145;a man of good sense&#146; could demonstrate &#145;such a poverty in his language and versification&#146;  (Aberdeen University Library, MS 30/1/15). Similarly, Henry Mackenzie, who considered the <span class="italic">Epigoniad</span> a work of &#145;great merit&#146;, judged <span class="italic">Fables</span> harshly  (Mackenzie, <span class="italic">Account</span>, 15&#150;16). <span class="italic">Fables</span> attracted little attention and never went to a second edition, but both of Wilkie's books were reprinted in 1795, along with an important biographical sketch, in volume 11 of Robert Anderson's <span class="italic">Complete Edition of the Poets of Great Britain</span>.<br>
<br>Wilkie, who was unmarried, was a man of extraordinary eccentricity. He dressed shabbily, went about dirty and unkempt, was absent-minded in the extreme, employed grotesque gestures, chewed tobacco excessively, and slept under a large pile of heavy blankets in an effort to stave off the feverish chills to which he was prone. Mackenzie states that his circle of Edinburgh literati considered him &#145;superior in original genius to any man of his time, but rough and unpolished in his manners, and still less accommodating to the decorum of society in the ordinary habits of his life&#146;  (Mackenzie, <span class="italic">Account</span>, 15). One member of that circle, Alexander Carlyle, recounted a remarkable evening of verbal jousting in 1759, after which the English visitor Charles Townshend said that &#145;he had never met with a man who approached so near the two extremes of a god and a brute as Wilkie did&#146;  (<span class="italic">Autobiography</span>, ed. Burton, 413). Yet Sir Robert Liston, while admitting that Wilkie was slovenly in his dress and personal hygiene, asserted that he was gentle, kind, and good-humoured, and deserved Mackenzie's description as &#145;rough and unpolished&#146; only in the sense that &#145;he abstained from every thing like flattery or compliment, and perhaps too frankly spoke the truth&#146;  (Mackenzie, <span class="italic">Account</span>, 183&#150;4). Liston's insistence that Wilkie was an excellent companion is supported by his role as a participant in a philosophical dialogue by Adam Ferguson, set on a highland jaunt with David Hume and others.<br>
<br>Wilkie was elected to the Select Society of Edinburgh on 4 December 1754, and was a member of the general assembly of the Church of Scotland in 1758 and 1762; he received honorary DD degrees from St Andrews University in 1766 and from Marischal College, Aberdeen, in 1767. Owing to his agricultural efforts, he accumulated an estate worth between &pound;2000 and &pound;3000, which he left to his two unmarried sisters. His manuscripts were bequeathed to his friend the Revd Robert Liston of Aberdour, but they do not seem to have survived. Shortly after his death on 10 October 1772, from an undisclosed &#145;lingering indisposition&#146;  (Anderson, xiii), he was eulogized by Robert Fergusson in &#145;An Eclogue to the Memory of Dr William Wilkie&#146;, which appeared in the <span class="italic">Weekly Magazine</span> on 29 October.<br>
