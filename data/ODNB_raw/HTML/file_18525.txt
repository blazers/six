<span class="headword">Meldrum, Sir  John</span>  (<em>b. </em>before 1584?, <em>d.</em> 1645), <span class="occ">parliamentarian army officer</span>, came of obscure Scottish origins. Nothing is known of his parents and all that is known of his date of birth is the statement by an adversary that he was over sixty in the year of his death, a plausible claim in the light of what is known of his early career. In April 1611 he was described as a captain in the Irish army; in 1642 he was to remind the king of his thirty-six years' service to the crown, and of his &#145;zeal to your majesty's father's service in settling the province of Ulster&#146;  (Rushworth, 4.627&#150;8). As a result of his Irish service he was granted lands in co. Fermanagh in 1617. The following year he and Sir William Erskine purchased a monopoly to build and maintain a lighthouse at Winterton Ness on the Norfolk coast, for which they were entitled to levy a penny per ton of cargo on every ship passing; this patent set them at odds both with Trinity House and&#151;for the charges it imposed on the east coast coal trade&#151;with the hostmen of Newcastle and the City of London. The monopoly was complained of to the privy council and in every parliament from 1621 to 1626. Meldrum retained the patent and acquired another for a lighthouse at Orford Ness on the Suffolk coast.<br>
<br>After fighting as a mercenary in the Low Countries, Meldrum returned to England where James I, who evidently liked his fellow Scot, knighted him on 6 August 1622. In 1627 Meldrum was collecting weapons and recruits for the R&eacute; expedition, in which he took part and was generously paid &pound;600 for his services. During the early 1630s Meldrum returned to the continent, in Swedish service under Gustavus Adolphus: in 1632 he was serving in east Prussia as a colonel of foot. By 1635 he was back in England, defending another lighthouse patent, for three lights at the North Foreland and South Foreland to guide ships passing by the Goodwin Sands. A royalist opponent later taunted Meldrum that his desire to protect his monopoly&#151;those &#145;lights you study to preserve&#146; rather than &#145;the dazeling lighte of Reformation&#146; had &#145;misled you out of the way of obedience&#146; and prompted him to become one of the first mercenary officers to side with parliament  (<span class="italic">Abergavenny MSS</span>, 156).<br>
<br>In June 1642 Meldrum commanded a force of 1500 men sent from London to reinforce the arsenal at Hull. Early that month Meldrum explained his choice of allegiance in an open letter to Charles I. He reminded the king of their conversation in Newcastle the previous November, when the veteran of the Thirty Years' War warned of the &#145;inhuman Butcheries of an intestine war&#146;. Blaming the failure of the king's policies on &#145;Court parasites&#146;, Meldrum begged Charles to heed the advice of parliament. &#145;I could find no better way to do your majesty a more general service than by stopping the course of the civil war&#146; he concluded, &#145;as to cast myself into Hull&#146;  (Rushworth, 4.627&#150;8). The contradictions of the argument that he was going to war to stop a war may suggest other motivations. The Scottish mercenary may have felt poorly done by. Without mentioning the land in Ireland and the lighthouse monopoly, Meldrum complained that during his thirty-six years of royal service he had incurred debts of &pound;3000.<br>
<br>There was no more vigorous defender of Hull than Sir John Meldrum. In early July at the head of 500 men he ambushed an approaching royalist column of some 3000 under the king's command, driving them back to Beverley. This was &#145;the first blood&#146;, reported a news sheet, &#145;that was shed in these unnatural wars&#146;  (Rushworth, 4.610). A couple of weeks later he led a night attack against the royalists at Anlaby, capturing some fifteen cannon, as well as a 36 lb mortar called &#145;the Queen's pocket pistol&#146; (which the parliamentarians immediately renamed &#145;Sweet Lips&#146; after Hull's most celebrated prostitute). It was reported that the king &#145;was much incensed at the news thereof&#146;  (Cooper, 4). Certainly Meldrum's vigorous defence of Hull persuaded Charles to lift the siege.<br>
<br>After helping Sir William Waller capture Portsmouth in September 1642, Meldrum commanded an infantry brigade on the parliamentarian right at the battle of Edgehill on 23 October. Lord Saye, who had raised most of the troops from his north Oxfordshire estates, had sense enough to let the Scots veteran lead them. One regiment panicked, but the other two stood their ground and acquitted themselves with credit. After the battle Meldrum was one of six parliamentarian officers who sent John Pym a report of the battle, which was published five days later on 28 October (<span class="italic">An Exact and True Relation of the Dangerous and Bloody Fight</span>, 1642).<br>
<br>During 1643 parliament employed Meldrum, who had gained the reputation as &#145;a Scot of good capacity&#146;, as a trouble-shooter in the midlands  (<span class="italic">CSP Venice</span>, <i>1642&#150;3</i>, 292). In June he arrested Captain John Hotham, his old commander from Hull, for treachery. In October he reinforced the besieged garrison at Hull with 400 men, and as a result of the sally he led on 9 October, in which he was wounded, forced the royalists to lift the siege. He took part in the capture of Gainsborough in December 1643, and expelled the royalists from the Isle of Axholme the following February.<br>
<br>After laying siege to the important garrison of Newark in late February 1644, Meldrum complained to his good friend Colonel John Hutchinson &#145;of the envyings, heart-burnings and dissensions&#146; of his officers. Recruited from several counties, the garrison would not co-operate. &#145;It galled the poor old gentleman to the heart&#146;, recalled the colonel's wife, Lucy Hutchinson, &#145;who having commanded abroad, and been used to deal with officers that understood the discipline of war, was confounded among those who knew not to obey any orders&#146;  (Hutchinson, 173). On 22 March 1644 Meldrum was forced to surrender Newark to Prince Rupert's relieving force and give up a large quantity of arms: eleven brass cannon, two mortars (including &#145;Sweet Lips&#146;), fifty barrels of gunpowder, and 4000 muskets. Although the royalists had agreed to let Meldrum's troops march away with colours flying, they plundered the troops to their shirts, &#145;and sent many captains quite naked away&#146;  (ibid., 177). The surrender had a tremendous effect on the morale of both sides. &#145;Even the most zealous were cast down and gave up all for lost&#146;, remembered the parliamentarian Lucy Hutchinson. Edward Hyde the royalist historian crowed that Meldrum's capitulation was &#145;a victory as prodigious as any happened throughout the war&#146; (ibid.; Clarendon, <span class="italic">Hist. rebellion</span>, 3.327).<br>
<br>Over the next eight months Meldrum learned much from his defeat, admitting in November 1644 that &#145;I have passed an apprenticeship&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1644&#150;5</i>, 129). He now thought of the royalists as &#145;This potent and vigilant enemy, which is now &hellip; wasting and spoiling&#146;. He recognized that Prince Rupert was their most dangerous leader, telling the committee of both kingdoms in August that he would follow up his victory at Ormskirk, &#145;If Prince Rupert does not enter upon the stage and interrupt the game&#146;  (ibid., <i>1644</i>, 180, 442). On 9 September he and Sir William Brereton captured Montgomery Castle, killing 500 royalists and taking 1200 prisoners. At the end of the month Meldrum started the siege of Liverpool. &#145;The enemy is stronger in the town&#146;, he reported, &#145;than we are without, beside the advantage of very strong works&#146;  (ibid., <i>1644</i>, 543&#150;4). Yet by 1 November he persuaded the garrison to surrender, granting clemency to the Irish troops, whom he paroled home.<br>
<br>The following February, Meldrum besieged Scarborough, the royalist stronghold on the north Yorkshire coast, which was defended by Sir Hugh Cholmley. Meldrum bombarded the castle with a 57 lb cannon and two 27-pounders. He nearly died when he fell down a 200 foot cliff, but was saved by his cloak, which acted as a parachute. &#145;Yet hee is taken up for dead&#146;, Cholmley admiringly recorded:<blockquote>lyes 3 dayes speachless, his head opened and the bruised blood taken out [i.e. he was trepanned], though a Man above three score yeare old, recovered thus soe perfectlie that within six weekes hee is on foote againe, and begins to batter the Castle. (<span class="italic">Memoirs and Memorials</span>, 156)</blockquote>Soon afterwards he suffered a &#145;shot through the Codds&#146;  (ibid., 158) which so discouraged him that the committee of both kingdoms wrote saying how much they appreciated his fine service, and that the House of Commons had voted him &pound;1500. Leading an assault on the castle on 11 May, Meldrum was shot in the stomach. Cholmley is probably wrong in asserting that he &#145;dyed with in six dayes of this wound&#146;  (ibid.), as the date on the preserved copy of his will, 24 May, suggests an even more horribly prolonged death. By it he appointed his nephew Robert Meldrum executor, the only kin named, though the will alluded to legacies which Robert was to pay. The will proclaimed Meldrum's commitment to the parliamentarian cause:<blockquote>since theis unhappie troubles began, God is my witnes I have denied myselfe and all private ends, and followed the publicke cause with a single hearte and unwearied spirite, and am nowe readie to give up my life in a willinge sacrifice for the honour of God and welfare of these Kingdomes.</blockquote>However, he was hard-headed enough to remember orders made by the Commons for his arrears of pay, &#145;which I have not yet receaved&#146; and &#145;for the establishing in my Person the Pattent of Goodwin Lights, which is a necessarie service for the good of the Navigation&#146;  (will, TNA: PRO, PROB 11/200, fol. 494<i>r</i>). He was buried with full military honours on 4 June at the church of the Holy Trinity, Hull. His death so demoralized the troops that they ceased offensive operations, starving the royalists into surrender on 21 July 1645.<br>
<br>Had Meldrum lived he might have gone on to become one of the parliament's leading generals, who as a Scot in English employ might have helped deal with the covenanters. As it was, Meldrum was a fine soldier who learned from his mistakes. He had a firm understanding of his profession and of European affairs, and a sincere reluctance to take up arms against his sovereign. He alerted parliament to the dangers of getting bogged down in sieges which could &#145;rather forment than finish a war&#146;, and urged them to treat their troops fairly, since such will be &#145;to the advancement of the public service&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1644</i>, 91, 523&#150;4). Historians have assessed Meldrum positively. S. R. Gardiner described Meldrum as &#145;A Scottish Officer of tried ability and character&#146;  (Gardiner, 1.190). J. P. Kenyon thought him to be &#145;one of Parliament's most enterprising and successful generals&#146;  (Kenyon, 45). The last word, however, must go to his fatal adversary, Sir Hugh Cholmley, who called him &#145;a bold Scot&#146;  (Rushworth, 4.627).<br>
