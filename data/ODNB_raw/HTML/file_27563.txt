</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Torrens, Sir  Henry</span>  (1779&#150;1828), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was reportedly, but questionably, descended from a Swedish Count Torrens, a cavalry captain in the army of William III who settled in Ireland after the battle of the Boyne (1690). Sir Henry's great-grandfather Thomas Torrens, of Scottish descent, was settled at Dungiven, co. Londonderry, early in the eighteenth century. Thomas's third son, Dr John Torrens (<i>d</i>. 1785), Sir Henry's grandfather, was prebendary of Derry, headmaster of Derry diocesan school, and rector of Ballynascreen. Sir Henry's father, the Revd Thomas Torrens, married Elizabeth, daughter of Samuel Curry of Londonderry. The eldest son, John (1761&#150;1851), was archdeacon of Dublin; the second, Samuel, captain of the 52nd regiment, died of wounds received in action at Ferrol in 1800. The third son, Robert (1776&#150;1856), was a justice of the court of common pleas in Ireland.<br>
<br>Henry, the fourth son, was born in Londonderry. Both his parents died during his infancy. He and his brothers were brought up by their maternal grandfather, the Revd Dr Thomas, before Henry went to his father's cousin, Thomas Torrens. He was educated at the military academy of Dublin where &#145;from the hilarity of his disposition, he was universally designated &#147;Happy Harry&#148;&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 374). He received a commission as ensign in the 52nd (Oxfordshire) foot on 2 November 1793, became a lieutenant in the 92nd on 14 June 1794, and was transferred to the 63rd on 11 December 1795. He accompanied the 63rd to the West Indies and took part in the expedition under Abercromby against St Lucia; he was also present at the attack on Morne Chabot on 29 April 1796, and at the siege of Morne Fortun&eacute; and its surrender on 26 May, before which he was severely wounded in the right thigh. Despite this wound Torrens joined the 63rd in time for the attack on St Vincent, and on 8 June took a prominent part in the assault of three French redoubts, when the French were driven out and took refuge in the New Vigie; they capitulated on the following day. He was employed for seven months in command of an outpost in the forests of St Vincent against the Charib Indians of the island, and, on their defeat on 28 March 1797 the commander of the forces rewarded him with promotion to a company, with which he served in Jamaica as captain and paymaster until June 1798, when he returned to England.<br>
<br>In August 1798 Torrens was appointed aide-de-camp to Major-General John Whitelocke, second in command under the earl of Moira and lieutenant-governor of Portsmouth. In November he went to Portugal as aide-de-camp to Major-General Cornelius Cuyler, who commanded the auxiliary troops sent by the British government against the threatened Spanish invasion. On 8 August 1799 he was transferred to the 20th foot, then forming part of the force under the duke of York for the expedition to The Helder. Torrens served with the 20th throughout the campaign; he landed on 28 August, and took part in the repulse of the French attack at Crabbendam, under General Daendels, on 10 September, when the regiment was complimented by Sir Ralph Abercromby for its gallantry; he was also engaged in the battle of Hoorne on 19 September, and in the two battles of Egmont-op-Zee on 2 and 6 October. At the latter Torrens was wounded by a bullet which passed through his right thigh and lodged in his left thigh; the bullet was never extracted.<br>
<br>Torrens returned to England in November 1799, and was promoted on 3 November to a majority in the Surrey rangers, a fencible regiment then being raised. Its formation devolved upon Torrens, who subsequently embarked with it for North America. He commanded it for a year in Nova Scotia, and returned to England in the autumn of 1801.<br>
<br>On 4 February 1802 Torrens exchanged, as major, into the 86th foot, then forming part of the Indian force in Egypt under Sir David Baird. He accompanied it across the desert to the Red Sea, and embarked with it on the return to India of Baird's expedition in the summer. On arrival at Bombay, Torrens was so ill from sunstroke that he was obliged to sail at once for Europe. The ship touched at St Helena; he remained there, recovered his health, and married, about May 1803, Sarah (<i>c</i>.1781&#150;1863), daughter of the governor, Colonel Robert Patton of Kirkcaldy, Fife; they had four sons, including <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27562/', "Sir Arthur Wellesley Torrens")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27564/', "Henry Whitelocke Torrens")</script>, and two daughters.<br>
<br>Torrens rejoined his regiment in India in 1804, and commanded in the field during the Second Anglo-Maratha War. He was promoted brevet lieutenant-colonel on 1 January 1805, and returned to England. Torrens was made assistant adjutant-general on 17 October 1805, and was employed on the staff of the Kent military district. He was transferred as regimental major to the 89th foot on 19 February 1807. On 11 May he was appointed military secretary to Major-General John Whitelocke, who had been nominated to the command of the army in South America. Torrens arrived at Montevideo in June, and took part in the disastrous attack on Buenos Aires on 5 July, when he received a contusion from a bullet which shattered his sabretache. He returned to England with Whitelocke, and was reappointed on 27 November an assistant adjutant-general on the staff in Great Britain; in December he became assistant military secretary to the commander-in-chief, the duke of York. He gave evidence at Whitelocke's court martial in January, February, and March 1808. His position as a member of Whitelocke's personal staff was a delicate one, but he acquitted himself with credit at the hearing.<br>
<br>In June 1808 Torrens was appointed military secretary to Sir Arthur Wellesley (later Viscount Wellington), and accompanied him to Portugal; they arrived in July. He was present at the action of Roli&ccedil;a on 17 August and at the battle of Vimeiro on 21 August. Torrens received the gold medal for these victories, and was made a knight of the order of the Tower and Sword by the Portuguese regency. He returned to England in October with Wellesley on the latter's supersession, and resumed his duties as assistant military secretary at headquarters.<br>
<br>Torrens was promoted military secretary to the commander-in-chief on 2 October 1809. On 13 June 1811 he was transferred from major of the 89th foot to a company (captain and lieutenant-colonel) in the 3rd foot guards. On 11 January 1812 he was appointed aide-de-camp to the prince regent, and promoted colonel in the army; and on 4 June 1814 he was promoted major-general. In 1815 he was made a KCB, military division (15 January), and appointed to the colonelcy of the second garrison battalion (5 April); later that year (27 November) he was transferred to the colonelcy of the Royal African Colonial Corps. On 21 September 1818 he was transferred to the colonelcy of the 2nd West India regiment, and on 25 March 1820 he was appointed adjutant-general of the forces. Because he now earned less than when a military secretary, a civil-list pension of &pound;800 a year was bestowed on his wife to compensate him.<br>
<br>In 1824 was published Torrens's revision of the official <span class="italic">Regulations for the Exercise and Field Movements of the Infantry of the Army</span>. Intended to consolidate, not innovate, it incorporated changes made by regiments during the war, so that drill would again be uniform. It retained repetitive movements and long words of command, and its main provision was for a line of two ranks, not three. It was criticized, and again revised in 1833.<br>
<br>On 26 July 1822 Torrens was transferred to the colonelcy of the 2nd or Queen's Royal regiment of foot. On 23 August 1828 he was out riding with his wife and two daughters while on a visit to a friend at Danesbury, Hertfordshire, when he was &#145;seized with apoplexy&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 375) and died two hours later. He was buried in Welwyn church, Hertfordshire, on 28 August.<br>
