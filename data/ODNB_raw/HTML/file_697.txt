<span class="headword">Arneway,  John</span>  (1599/1600&#150;<em>c.</em>1653), <span class="occ">polemicist</span>, was the third surviving son of John Arneway (<i>d</i>. 1622), yeoman of Peplow, Hodnet, Shropshire, and Dorothy (<i>fl</i>. 1599&#150;1621), probably <i>n&eacute;e</i> Hinstocke. He had one elder sister who survived until adulthood. In 1618, aged eighteen, he matriculated at St Edmund Hall, Oxford. The profits of his father's lands at Wixhall were left in his father's will to maintain him at Oxford for five years, and by this means he graduated BA in 1622 and proceeded MA in 1624, and possibly studied theology thereafter.<br>
<br>Perhaps through the influence of John Rawlinson, principal of St Edmund Hall, who was on close terms with bishops William Laud and William Juxon, Arneway obtained influential patronage, and in May 1633 he became prebendary of Wolvey at Lichfield Cathedral. By 1634 he had obtained the interest of secretary of state Sir Francis Windebank, whose request to Bishop Robert Wright of Lichfield led the earl of Arundel to present him to Ightfield rectory, Shropshire. A power struggle delaying the institution, Sir Robert Vernon meanwhile presented him to the much richer Hodnet rectory nearby, worth &pound;300 a year. Wishing to hold both livings Arneway successfully appealed to Windebank to obtain temporary letters of qualification for him until he had been examined for a further degree at Oxford, and settled at Hodnet. In or after June 1642 he became archdeacon of Coventry.<br>
<br>On the outbreak of the civil war Arneway signed the loyal address of the Shropshire clergy and, according to John Walker, supplied eight horsemen to serve under Sir Vincent Corbett. On 12 December 1642 he was made an Oxford DD by royal letters. About 1643 he was driven from Hodnet by the parliamentary garrison at Wem, who plundered all his books and papers, and he lost wealth which may have included land. He apparently remained based in Shropshire, perhaps at Ightfield, though his anonymous <span class="italic">No Peace 'till the King Prospers</span>, written after the Uxbridge peace negotiations broke down in February 1645, was published by the Oxford University printer. This pamphlet argues passionately that all suffer by the continuation of war except the parliamentary leaders, and predicts that parliamentary victory will not end it, since it will necessitate a new constitution imposed by force, and army factions will start internecine war. The king can make no more concessions. Thus his opponents, and those indifferent, are enemies to peace, and Arneway appeals to all who fear God and honour the king to give him their support, to bring peace and prosperity.<br>
<br>When the parliamentarians captured Shrewsbury in February 1645 Arneway was among the prisoners. He claims he was not allowed &#145;a <span class="roman">Bible</span> of my library to comfort me, nor a sheaf of my means to nourish me, nor a suit of my clothes to cover me, nor use of common air to refresh me&#146;  (Walker, 2.40). He was pressurized to take the covenant, and was offered restitution of &pound;400 to do so, but refused and was later interrogated as a suspect Roman Catholic. Ultimately he was banished and went to The Hague.<br>
<br>There Arneway wrote <span class="italic">The Tablet</span> and <span class="italic">An Alarum to the People of England</span>, eventually published together in 1650. The former was a reply to John Milton's <span class="italic">Eikonoklastes</span>, and idealized Charles I as perfect, even in intellect, so that his enemies' only recourse was violence, against which he had to defend both church and monarchy. He is compared to Christ, and seen as a conqueror of carnal lusts who is numbered with the saints. The <span class="italic">Alarum</span>, portraying government and religion in England as in a woeful state, argues that current natural disasters are punishments from God on the nation, which will see terrible judgment. Passionately Arneway exhorts repentance, and predicts that God will restore the monarchy, and the &#145;second in the kingdom&#146; will end at Tyburn. The works are dedicated to Charles II &#145;as an earnest of my resolution rather to starve in exile, then change my Allegiance&#146;  (<span class="italic">Tablet</span>, 6).<br>
<br>At the end of 1649 Arneway was perhaps one of those royalists who sailed on <i>The Virginia merchant</i> to take refuge in the colony, which he describes in <span class="italic">The Tablet</span> as desert. He settled on the south bank of the James River estuary, and died somewhere between Lyn Haven and &#145;Nausunum&#146; (probably the Nansemond River) about 1653. Whether he married is unknown.<br>
