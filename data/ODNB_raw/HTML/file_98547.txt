<span class="headword">Kogan,  Maurice</span>  (1930&#150;2007), <span class="occ">civil servant and scholar of education and public policy</span>, was born Maurice Cohen on 10 April 1930 at 48 Stephens Road, West Ham, London. He and his identical twin, Philip, were the youngest of five boys and one girl of Barnett Cohen, born Barnett Kogan (1884/5&#150;1935), and his wife, Hetty, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Vicker (1893&#150;1978). The family was Jewish; his father, who had fought for Britain in the First World War, came from Russia, his mother from Poland. Though the birth certificates of the twins were in the name Cohen, their passports were always in the name Kogan, the story being that Barnett, arriving in England as Kogan, assumed the Anglicized form Cohen under family pressure, but the family reverted to the Russian form Kogan after 1945. When Maurice and Philip were four their father died and their mother ran a sweetshop to make ends meet.<br>
<br>The young Maurice Kogan won a place at Stratford grammar school in east London. Hard working, politically minded, he typified the clever grammar school pupils given a chance by the <span class="roman">Education Act</span> of 1944. He won an exhibition to read history at Christ's College, Cambridge, and went on to gain a first in the historical tripos in 1953. In the same year he also achieved first place in the home civil service administrative grade examinations. Preferring, as he put it, the hands-on intrigues of Whitehall to the archival intrigues of medieval popes, he chose the Ministry of Education, where he was to remain for fourteen years.<br>
<br>On 11 August 1960 he married Ulla-Britta Astrid Svensson, daughter of Vilehard Svensson, florist. The marriage took place in Stockholm, the city in which she had been born and brought up. The newly married couple immediately set off for the United States on the Harkness fellowship that Kogan had been awarded for 1960&#150;61, which gave him visiting status at Harvard, Chicago, and Stanford. On their return they settled in a terrace house in Islington decades before the area became fashionable, and had two sons, Tom and Peter. After the children started school Ulla became a social worker. Later they bought a house in Suffolk.<br>
<br>Kogan stayed in the Ministry of Education (from 1964 the Department of Education and Science) until 1967. He had been identified early as a high-flyer. From 1957 to 1959 he was private secretary to Sir Edward Boyle, at the time an influential parliamentary secretary. From 1963 to 1966 he was secretary to the Central Advisory Council (England) which, under the chairmanship of Bridget, Lady Plowden, produced a ground-breaking report on child-centred primary education. He was rewarded with promotion to assistant secretary status in 1966. During his time at the Central Advisory Council he and his superiors had hoped he would have a spell in the prime minister's office, another marker of his civil service career potential. But Lady Plowden, a forceful chairman, would not let him go.<br>
<br>In 1967 Kogan, convinced he had missed his civil service chance, moved into academia, joining Brunel University as director of the Hospital Organisation Unit. Brunel was a former college of advanced technology which had become a university in 1966, following the 1963 Robbins report on higher education. Though the former colleges of advanced technology did not have the cachet of Oxford and Cambridge, the major civic universities, or the new campuses like Sussex and York, Brunel stood out as attracting some very distinguished social scientists who believed that &#145;the new map of knowledge&#146; of the 1960s should include technological institutions. They included Elliott Jaques, Keith Hopkins, Dan Miller, and John Vaizey. In 1969 Kogan became professor of government and social administration. In 1970 he was made head of department, a post he held for twenty years. From 1971 he was dean of the faculty of social sciences. In 1989 he became acting vice-chancellor for nine months, following the sudden death of the incumbent. By that time he was such an internationally acclaimed scholar of public policy, and particularly higher education, that full-time academic politics and management did not tempt him&#151;other than &#145;their bloody great cars and their salaries&#146;  (personal knowledge). In 1990 Brunel established the Centre for the Evaluation of Public Policy, which he directed until 2004.<br>
<br>Kogan produced many notable publications over forty years. Four books came out in 1971 alone, built around the public policy contracts he had won for Brunel and his experience at the Ministry of Education. By the end of his life he had produced almost forty books and about seventy articles. Their themes were power, politics, policies, and the processes of change, with a focus on public policy and the way in which forms of knowledge, the governance of knowledge, and professional values interacted with institutional change. There were important books on health but the majority were on education, especially higher education, and latterly on issues of evaluation. A hallmark was what came to be called evidence-based research (a revealing comment on social-science research of the 1970s and 1980s). Illuminated by empirical evidence, the conclusions of Kogan and the collaborators with whom he regularly worked (including Tony Becher, Mary Henkel, Ivar Bleiklie, and Stephen Hanney) were major contributions in conceptualizing the shift that was taking place from government to governance, and in particular how conflicts of values, beliefs about knowledge, and institutional pressures work out within political and administrative systems.<br>
<br>Notable among these &#145;evidence-based&#146; books were <span class="italic">The Politics of Education</span> (1971), an analytic conversation guided by Kogan between politically opposed ministers of education; <span class="italic">County Hall</span> (1973), on the inner London education authority; <span class="italic">Directors of Education</span> (with Tony Bush, 1982); <span class="italic">Government and Research: the Rothschild Experiment in a Government Department</span> (with Mary Henkel, 1983; second edn, 2006), a study of the Department of Health (unravelling the issue of how government and scientists interacted on policy gave Kogan great satisfaction and continued to illuminate his thinking); <span class="italic">Reforming Higher Education</span> (with Stephen Hanney, 2000); and <span class="italic">Transforming Higher Education</span> (with Marianne Bauer, Ivar Bleiklie, Mary Henkel, and others, 2000; second edn, 2006). In parallel were Kogan's works that were destined to become standard social-science texts exploring policy-making theory: <span class="italic">Educational Policy-Making</span> (1975), <span class="italic">The Politics of Educational Change</span> (1978), and, most important, <span class="italic">Process and Structure in Higher Education</span> (with Tony Becher, 1980; second edn, 1992).<br>
<br>A third group of publications reflected Kogan's passionate engagement in political issues. Notable among these were the two books he co-wrote with his journalist nephew David Kogan. The first was <span class="italic">The Battle for the Labour Party</span> (1982). Horrified by the advance in London politics of the so-called Outside Left&#151;the unlikely alliance of Trotskyists, Communist Party members, and supporters of Tony Benn MP&#151;they uncovered the process by which the Outside Left's preferred candidate, Ken Livingstone, was able to seize the leadership of the London Labour Party and the Greater London council in 1981. <span class="italic">The Attack on Higher Education</span> (1983) followed, chronicling the undermining of the collegial tradition in the management of universities. Both reflected Kogan's passionate beliefs as much as his rigour.<br>
<br>Kogan was much in demand for national and international public-policy inquiries; his public service included membership of the Davies committee on hospital complaints procedure (1971), the Houghton committee on teachers' pay (1974), the education sub-committee of the University Grants Committee (1972&#150;5), and the Social Science Research Council (1975&#150;7). He undertook reviews for the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development of education or higher education policy in the USA, Finland, Greece, Sweden, and Norway, and for many years edited its journal <span class="italic">Higher Education Management and Policy</span>. In 1988 he was one of the founders of the academically respected Consortium of Higher Education Researchers. In 2000 he became a founding fellow of the Academy of Social Sciences. He received honorary doctorates from two universities (Hull, 1987; Brunel, 1991).<br>
<br>The respect, affection, and gratitude in which Maurice Kogan was held was demonstrated on his birthday in 2005, when leading scholars of higher education came from around the world to offer him a Festschrift devoted to themes on which he had provided inspiration and leadership. Edited by his long-time collaborators Mary Henkel and Ivar Bleiklie, <span class="italic">Governing Knowledge</span> showed how much his rigorous and humane work had permeated scholarship and public-policy thinking. Although already diagnosed with a cancer that doctors expected to carry him off before then, he lived almost two years more. He died on 6 January 2007, survived by his wife, Ulla, and their sons.<br>
