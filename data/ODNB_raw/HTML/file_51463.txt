<span class="headword">Crace,  John Dibblee</span>  (1838&#150;1919), <span class="occ">interior decorator and author</span>, was born on 19 January 1838 at 14 (later renumbered 38) Wigmore Street, Cavendish Square, London, the eldest of eleven surviving children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/50537/', "John Gregory Crace (1809&#150;1889)")</script>, interior decorator and author, and his wife, Sarah Jane Hine Langley (1815&#150;1894), the daughter of John Inwood Langley (1790&#150;1874) of Greenwich, a civil servant at the Royal Naval Hospital. His father was renowned as a decorator who was in partnership for eight years with A. W. N. Pugin, the eminent Gothic revival architect, and was head of a decorating firm founded in 1768 by his great-great-grandfather <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/60734/', "Edward Crace")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/67885/', "Crace family")</script>], a coach-decorator and keeper of the king's pictures.<br>
<br>Possessing a quiet, even reserved, personality, J. D. Crace was artistically gifted from an early age. He studied the classics at Romanoff House School in Tunbridge Wells, Kent, from 1848 to 1852, where he was tutored by Thomas Alifree, who had spent three years in Russia teaching the children of Tsar Nicholas I. Crace was apprenticed in 1852 to his grandfather Frederick Crace (1779&#150;1859), renowned as the decorator of the Royal Pavilion, Brighton. From 1852 to 1854 he studied at King's College School, London, but was recalled from school in the autumn of 1854, when his father's health broke down in the midst of important commissions. This marked the end of his formal education, but he continued to study continental decorative art by means of study tours for the rest of his life.<br>
<br>At the age of seventeen, and aided by his 75-year-old grandfather, young Crace took over the running of the family decorating firm until his father's recovery in the spring of 1855. The principal work in hand was the preparation of rooms at Windsor Castle for the reception of the French Emperor Napoleon III and Empress Eug&eacute;nie on the occasion of their first state visit to Britain, in April 1855. Two letters written by J. G. Crace from Spain to his eldest son, now in the Victoria and Albert Museum archive of art and design, testify to the close working relationship between the two men. In 1855 they travelled together to Paris for the Universal Exhibition, then on to Berlin for study.<br>
<br>In his memoirs, now in the Victoria and Albert Museum archive of art and design, J. D. Crace recalled having grown up in a house where Pugin and Sir Joseph Paxton, designer of the Crystal Palace, were frequent visitors. Despite this, he was never to become a leading practitioner of the Gothic revival style. In early life, and into adulthood, Crace was subject to bronchial infection, which occasioned his first trip to the Middle East&#151;Egypt (partly in the company of Frederick Leighton)&#151;in 1868, followed by a visit to Palestine in 1869. The result was a lifelong fascination for Islamic design and active membership of the Palestine Exploration Fund. This was second only to his fascination for the art of Renaissance Italy, the result of a study tour in 1859 on the advice of another family friend, Sir Matthew Digby Wyatt, a leading Victorian designer. Crace was to return to Italy frequently throughout the next forty years of his career, and his interpretation of the Renaissance style was to characterize his career.<br>
<br>In 1859 J. D. Crace had been granted the freedom and livery of the Painter&#150;Stainers' Company, but he first came to public notice for his role in assisting his father at the 1862 exhibition in London, where he exhibited his own designs and assisted his father with the latter's difficult task of decorating the exhibition building in a very short time. In 1866 J. D. Crace was admitted as a contributing visitor to the RIBA, followed by his participation in the 1867 Universal Exhibition in Paris.<br>
<br>The 1870s and 1880s were busy decades for Crace, who increasingly took over the running of the firm, having become a full partner with his father in 1873 on the occasion of his marriage on 6 February that year to Caroline Elizabeth Foster (1845&#150;1947), daughter of Richard Foster, banker, of Lostwithiel, Cornwall. Important commissions during this time include Knightshayes, Devon (1874&#150;82), where Crace worked in a mixed Gothic&#150;Islamic style after the dismissal of the architect William Burges, and the Pompeian Room at Ickworth in Suffolk (1879) in conjunction with the architect Francis Penrose, a personal friend. J. D. Crace later noted that the principal figurative paintings had been executed by Henry Scholtz, a decorative painter his father had engaged in Paris to work on the lower library of Chatsworth in Derbyshire (1840&#150;44). Such continuity is typical of the Crace firm and ensured its recognizable decorative style throughout the nineteenth century.<br>
<br>The most important work of J. D. Crace's career was undoubtedly the series of state and private rooms in a rich Renaissance style at Longleat House, Wiltshire (1874&#150;82), for the fourth marquess of Bath. In Lord Bath, Crace found a patron completely attuned to his own passion for Renaissance Italy, which resulted in Crace's publication of <span class="italic">The Art of Colour Decoration</span> in 1912. Major late commissions were the redecoration of Leeds town hall in 1894, replacing his father's scheme of 1857, and the redecoration of the Royal Pavilion, Brighton (1884&#150;98), replacing the work of his grandfather (1815&#150;22) and great-grandfather (1801&#150;4). During the 1890s Crace worked extensively for W. W. Astor, designing in a rich &#145;Fran&ccedil;ois Ier&#146; manner at Cliveden, Buckinghamshire, 18 Carlton House Terrace, London, and the Astor estate office in London.<br>
<br>In 1884 J. D. Crace was elected master of the Painter&#150;Stainers' Company; in 1908 the eminent painter Sir Lawrence Alma-Tadema presented him with a gold medal on behalf of the Institute of British Decorators, of which he was a founder and first president. In addition he held memberships of the Society of Arts and the Architectural Association. In 1889 his father died, and, feeling the loss keenly, he closed the business ten years later and worked as a consultant from home. In 1916 he suddenly lost his eyesight, and the last of the Crace decorators died quietly at home at 15 Gloucester Place, London, on 18 November 1919, leaving his wife and two children. He was buried in Norwood cemetery, London. His son, John Foster Crace, had been apprenticed to his father in 1900 but instead became a classics master at Eton College. His daughter, Mabyn Crace Collingham, did much organizing of the family papers after her father's death. In his own lifetime J. D. Crace prepared large gifts of drawings to the Victoria and Albert Museum and the Royal Institute of British Architects, ensuring the legacy of this remarkable family of designers to future generations.<br>
