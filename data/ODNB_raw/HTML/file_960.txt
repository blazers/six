<span class="headword">Ballon <span class="st"> [Baalun]</span>,  John  de</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1235), <span class="occ">baron</span>, came of a family that took its name from Ballon, Maine, France, and was established in Herefordshire, as lords of Much Marcle, during the reign of William II. John succeeded his father, Reginald de Ballon, when the latter died in 1203. Reginald had succeeded his brother William, and this seems to have given rise to litigation, since John is recorded in 1207 as owing 100 marks and a palfrey so that a fine made by his father over the family lands should be observed. John is also recorded as engaged in litigation concerning property in Wiltshire, where he held the manor of Great Cheverell, and Herefordshire between 1206 and 1212. Although he went to Ireland with King John in 1210, he later joined the baronial revolt against that ruler, with the result that in July 1216 his lands were given to Peter de Bosco; there is no obvious motive for Ballon's rebellion, but the fact that the Herefordshire antiquary W. H. Cooke names his wife as Joanna, daughter of William de Brouse, raises the possibility of a connection with William (III) de Briouze, ruined by the king in 1210.<br>
<br>However, by 22 June 1217 Ballon had come into Henry III's allegiance, and his estates were restored to him. He was in the king's army at the siege of Newark in 1218, and served on the Welsh march in 1223. On 11 February 1225 his name occurs as the last witness to the reissue of the charters, and four days later he was appointed to assess that year's fifteenth in Gloucestershire. Later in 1225 he was appointed one of the justices to hear assizes of novel disseisin and to deliver gaols in the same county. In 1228 he was summoned to serve on the Montgomery campaign; it is not known if he went, but in 1230 he paid 40 marks for scutage and for exemption from the expedition to Brittany. John de Ballon died in 1235, and was succeeded by the eldest of his three sons, another John, whose payment of a relief of &pound;100 for succession to his father's lands shows that they were regarded as constituting a barony, notwithstanding their relatively insignificant extent. The elder John de Ballon, in an early instance of a practice that was later commonplace, had previously safeguarded the descent of some of his Herefordshire lands by conveying them to trustees, who subsequently reconveyed them to the heir. The Ballon family afterwards fell into obscurity, and its manor of Much Marcle was acquired by the Mortimers later in the thirteenth century.<br>
