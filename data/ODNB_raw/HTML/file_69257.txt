<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Sarmiento de Acu&ntilde;a,  Diego</span>, count of Gondomar in the Spanish nobility  (1567&#150;1626), <span class="occ">diplomat</span>, was born on 1 November 1567 in Astorga in Leon, Spain, where his paternal uncle was bishop. Rightly has it been said that his family possessed more breeding than money. Through his father, Don Garc&iacute;a Sarmiento de Sotomayor (<i>d</i>. 1579), a minor courtier under Charles V, he was closely connected to the Sotomayor counts of Salvatierra; through his mother, Do&ntilde;a Juana de Acu&ntilde;a y Enr&iacute;quez (<i>d</i>. 1600), he could claim two kings among his ancestors, Pedro I of Portugal and Enrique II of Castile.<h2>
<a name="Earlyyears"></a>Early years</h2>Gondomar's early life was spent in the small seignorial house across the river from the town of Gondomar, the lordship of which his father, a younger son, had bought about the time of his marriage. Despite the death of his father when he was only twelve, Gondomar retained the most profound affinity for his eponymous home. His mother continued to live there until her death, and Don Diego constantly returned, adding to the house and estate whenever he could. Gondomar was conspicuously proud of where he had been brought up, and was unusually fond of enumerating its produce in his many nostalgic letters. In 1614 he wrote from London to a friend about spending a summer in Galicia, mentioning &#145;a small house and a fine little mountain of mine which I think of every day here, and that is what keeps me going&#146;  (Real Biblioteca, Madrid, MS II-2168, fol. 229).<br>
<br>Virtually nothing is known of Gondomar's education, despite the fact that he became the greatest private collector of books in Spain, with his library in the city of Valladolid cited as one of the wonders of the age. He may have received some formal instruction in the nearby episcopal cities of Tuy or even Toro. In addition to his native Galician and Castilian, Gondomar probably acquired early on a firm grasp of French and Latin, the languages in which he conducted diplomatic business in London. French he may have practised with the merchants who frequented the various Galician ports, notably Bayona. Though perfectly able to converse in Latin, he never claimed a classical mastery. It is likely that his Sotomayor cousins oversaw his education, not only because his father had decreed that this branch should always be regarded as head of the family, but also because Gondomar was married to his cousin, Do&ntilde;a Beatriz Sarmiento de Mendoza (<i>d</i>. 1586), on 27 December 1581, when he had just turned fourteen.<br>
<br>As a first-born son Gondomar was marked out for a life of action. He may have fought on the Portuguese border at about the time of his first marriage, and it is probable that he was in Italy when his first wife died, childless, in 1586. During his absence his mother arranged his second marriage in 1588, to Constanza de Acu&ntilde;a y Avellaneda (<i>d</i>. in or after 1626). She was another if more distant cousin, whose father had seen distinguished service in Italy and in the duke of Alba's army in Flanders, where he probably met Constanza's Netherlandish mother. According to the prenuptial agreement, Gondomar was to live with his wife in the northern Castilian city of Valladolid and be absent from her for no more than two months in the year, unless he was at court. The union proved blissfully happy, producing three daughters and four sons, though one son died shortly after birth.<br>
<br>The early days of Gondomar's second marriage were interrupted by possibly his first encounter with the English. As lord of Vincios and Gondomar, and with responsibilities for the soldiers of the bishopric of Tuy, either he or an older cousin of the same name was obliged to return to Galicia to defend the coasts from any attack from Sir Francis Drake, who set sail in the spring of 1589 to support a pro-English pretender to the Portuguese throne. He must soon have returned to Valladolid, where on 6 December his first child, Lope Ambrosio (<i>d</i>. 1618), was born, father of Diego, second count of Gondomar. Soon afterwards Gondomar undertook his first role at court. On 31 March 1590 he carried a motto during a joust attended by Philip II. It read: &#145;The torments which afflict me, stronger and firmer do they leave me&#146;. This was prescient. For the next seven years Gondomar achieved little. He continued to oversee the defence of the Galician coasts and was rewarded with the perpetual governorship of the fortress of Monte Real in Bayona. He was also active in the church, joining the confraternity of Santa Mar&iacute;a de Esgueva, and later became a member of the military order of Calatrava, after proving that he was untainted by Jewish blood.<h2>
<a name="Administrator15971612"></a>Administrator, 1597&#150;1612</h2>Early in 1597 Gondomar was appointed <i>corregidor</i> or royal representative in the city of Toro. He undertook a programme of modernization, including repairs to the bridge and to the highways, as well as securing supplies of wheat for the inhabitants. He also saw to it that the city acceded most readily to the crown's demands for taxation. All this made him an ideal choice for the much more important position of <i>corregidor</i> of Valladolid, which in 1601 had once more become the capital of Spain and the principal residence of the royal court. He took up office on 14 September 1602, after declining various other posts, including the governorship of the Philippines. In addition to running the city Gondomar was intimately involved in arranging numerous royal festivals. This may have given him especial pleasure because it brought him into contact with numerous artists and poets, including Quevedo and G&oacute;ngora, with the latter satirizing the tight watch Gondomar maintained over the comings and goings from the city. Less welcome was the fact that his new-found prominence also brought him to the attention of the duke of Lerma, Philip III's chief minister and the prime mover in translating the court from Madrid to his own city. The duke seems for some reason to have taken against Gondomar, and for as long as he remained in power prevented him from coming too close to the king and court. In 1605 Gondomar lost the position of <i>corregidor</i> to the duke's twenty-year-old son, the count of Salda&ntilde;a. He followed the court on its return to Madrid in 1606 but failed to achieve any significant reward other than a place on the <i>consejo de hacienda</i>, which looked after the crown's finances. Early in 1612 he wrote an impassioned letter to Lerma asking to be made <i>corregidor</i> of Madrid. It was no secret, however, that he hoped to become head of the council of Castile, the kingdom's main administrative body, in succession to one of his own cousins.<br>
<br>Though Gondomar had consistently refused to consider an overseas posting in Spain's vast empire, Lerma's response was to engineer his appointment on 21 August 1612 as permanent ambassador to London. There had been rumours to this effect as early as June, and it was taken as a further sign of continued ducal hostility, though Gondomar was probably also offered a post in Seville, which too would have kept him away from the court. Perhaps the fact that if he undertook the ambassadorship he would be allowed to keep his seat in the <i>consejo de hacienda</i> tipped the balance in favour of London. He finally embarked for England on 9 July 1613. Meanwhile, he had drawn up plans for the decoration of his family crypt in the church of St Benedict the Old (San Benito el Viejo), next to his house in Valladolid. He commissioned a final judgment, to include figures of Christ and the saints, and with images of Do&ntilde;a Constanza and of himself under the protection of Benedict, his patron saint.<br>
<br>For all Lerma's wish to be rid of an irritating suitor, a new Spanish ambassador was being appointed at a crucial time for relations between London and Madrid. Since the ending of the Anglo-Spanish war on the accession of the Scottish king to the English throne, relations between the two dynasties had been good, despite occasional tensions in Ireland and the New World. But by 1612 the British king's friendship could no longer be taken for granted, especially as his children were all of or approaching marriageable age. James I's daughter, Elizabeth, was about to marry the foremost Calvinist prince in Germany, the elector palatine, Frederick V, whereas his heir, Prince Henry, was looking for a bride, possibly French. A renewal of protestant or anti-Spanish solidarity threatened Habsburg interests in the Low Countries and in Germany and Austria.<h2>
<a name="FirstembassytoEngland16131618connectionsandintelligence"></a>First embassy to England, 1613&#150;1618: connections and intelligence</h2>Gondomar's motto was &#145;Osar morir da la vida&#146; (&#145;Risking death gives life&#146;). His arrival in Portsmouth on 21 July 1613 was evidence of that as well as an auspicious beginning for an embassy based on his willingness to play for high stakes. When the captain of the English escort ordered him, in accordance with English custom, to lower the flags of King Philip III in salute to those of King James, Gondomar seized the opportunity to make his presence felt. He was told that the present king of Spain's father had done the same when he landed in 1554 to marry Mary Tudor. If Gondomar refused to strike his colours, the captain warned him, he would blow him out of the water. Fortunately, James was hunting nearby, and Gondomar wrote that day to explain his refusal, asking that he be allowed merely to return to Spain:<blockquote>because I was born of a good and honourable family, and I wish to emulate them; all of which obliges me to die, as I will, to defend my honour and duty, which is that these ships should enter and then return from this kingdom in the state that they left Spain.</blockquote>The letter was passed to the king as he was about to kill a stag and, captivated by the swagger of the new ambassador, James made an exception for his entry into the country  (<span class="italic">Correspondencia oficial</span>, 3.71&#150;86).<br>
<br>Gondomar was accompanied to London by Do&ntilde;a Constanza. They kept on the embassy in a house just outside the city walls at the Barbican, taking over the lease at a cost of 720 ducats a year from John Egerton, earl of Bridgewater. Together they enhanced its existing reputation as the principal centre of Catholic worship in the city. From its chapel a bell rang out to announce mass or even give warning of a raid by the authorities. Many committed Catholics took up residence in the vicinity for protection. Gondomar described it as &#145;the parish and cathedral church for London&#146;  (Fern&aacute;ndez, 260). This was not simply his accustomed hyperbole. At the start of 1614 he reported that seventy-two people were either living in the embassy or were being fed there on a daily basis. Numbers were so great that on Sundays two services were held, one for his staff and the other a public celebration. The leading Catholic laywoman in London, the 48-year-old Do&ntilde;a Luisa de Carvajal, received up to 500 reales a month until her death on 23 December 1613. Her funeral in the ambassadorial chapel was determinedly ostentatious. In addition, Gondomar rented a house in the country. This he justified as necessary for his country's reputation, and his generosity as a host, not least with the products of his native Galicia, was duly noted.<br>
<br>There can be no question of Gondomar's diligence as an ambassador. In the first year of his embassy he wrote over 100 letters to Philip III and almost half as many to the king's chief minister, the duke of Lerma. He also maintained an active intelligence network. He supplemented his many friendships at court with an impressive list of pensioners, often disguised in his accounts with names taken from romances of chivalry. Many of these pensioners he inherited from previous ambassadors; indeed, soon after he arrived in London he wrote to Philip III warning that, &#145;times being what they are and given what these people are like&#146; he would doubtless be expected to expend more money  (<span class="italic">Correspondencia oficial</span>, 3.88). Despite C. H. Carter's suggestions to the contrary, the Spanish pensions were paid, albeit erratically. To scrutinize one of the many accounts Gondomar sent back to Madrid, in November 1617 he paid to &#145;Priam&#146; (Katherine Howard, countess of Suffolk) 4000 ducats; to &#145;Socrates&#146; (Admiral William Monson) and to &#145;Florian&#146; (Lady Drummond) he handed over a total of 2250 ducats each. He usually reckoned that there were 4 ducats to the pound sterling, and these were all pensions established before he had arrived. Among the pensioners he had himself recommended, Secretary Sir Thomas Lake received his annual pension of 2000 ducats backdated for one and a half years, making 3000 ducats in total. Among other high-placed recipients, George Villiers's name appears for the first time when he received full payment of the annual pension of 6000 ducats which he had been awarded in August 1616, the month he was created Viscount Villiers. Even so, Gondomar was becoming disenchanted with the pensions he was expected to pay out, and he suggested to the king that the money might be better spent on Spain's armies. Really useful information, he said, came either from those who &#145;were devoted to the service of God&#146; or those who could be induced by occasional gifts or demonstrations of friendship. Villiers's pension none the less increased as he made his way up the ranks of the English peerage as earl and then marquess of Buckingham  (<span class="italic">Correspondencia oficial</span>, 1.128&#150;31).<br>
<br>Gondomar's informants were not confined to the royal court. In September 1613 he announced that in the French ambassador's house there was &#145;someone extremely well placed and his confidant, who has offered to tell me what is going on and even pass me copies of his papers&#146;  (<span class="italic">Correspondencia oficial</span>, 3.122). He also had his spies in the English parliament. During his second embassy an unnamed source provided him with a daily account of activities in the first session of the parliament of 1621, which he had translated into Spanish. His best sources of information were often the king and his ministers, however. Especially during the parliamentary crisis of late 1621 and the concomitant threats to the Rhineland, Gondomar was given copies of James's correspondence with his son-in-law or even with the House of Commons. On one occasion Gondomar was allowed to copy for himself a letter from General Mansfeldt in the Palatinate, even if the original had to be returned to Buckingham's safekeeping. Perhaps in terms of espionage Gondomar was most successful in exercising a watching brief over Ireland. Many Irish Catholics sought temporary refuge in the embassy before being provided with money and the necessary contacts in Flanders or Spain, and in this respect Gondomar was merely continuing his interest in the welfare of Irish exiles in Spain, the vast majority of whom had first landed in Galicia.<h2>
<a name="FirstembassythefallofRaleghandthebeginningsoftheSpanishmatch"></a>First embassy: the fall of Ralegh and the beginnings of the Spanish match</h2>In political terms Gondomar's principal task as ambassador was to smooth over the rough edges of the treaty of London, by which James had established peace with Spain shortly after arriving in his new kingdom. English trade in the New World, even as far north as Bermuda and Virginia, seemed to Spain to be no more than a continuation of the piracy that had typified Elizabeth's reign. Gondomar reiterated Spain's promise not to interfere in Ireland, in return for sterner treatment of the more notorious corsairs of the age. The most notable example of this involved Sir Walter Ralegh. Imprisoned in the Tower of London since 1605, Ralegh was released in 1616, principally because of an offer he made to sail to the Guyanas and discover the legendary source of gold known as El Dorado. In a <i>d&eacute;marche</i> worthy of the greatest ambassadors, Gondomar quietly referred the scholarly king of Great Britain to folio 584 of the third part of Antonio de Herrera's <span class="italic">History of Philip II</span>. It confirmed that this now invaluable source of gold had already been visited by Ralegh some twenty years earlier. Not only that, it proved that the area was legitimately claimed by Spain and, to top it all, that the stories about the mine were &#145;laughable&#146;  (<span class="italic">Correspondencia oficial</span>, 1.54&#150;7). Gondomar extracted promises from James that if Ralegh were allowed to sail then an absolute guarantee would be given that no harm would befall Spanish settlements. Instead, Ralegh raided the Canary Islands before launching attacks in the New World, including upon San Tom&eacute; in the Guyanas, where the governor, a relative of Gondomar, was killed. In June 1618 the ambassador had been given permission to return to Madrid, but Philip III ordered him to remain until Ralegh had been brought to justice. Gondomar kept up a barrage of complaints to the privy council and, in a letter of 13 July, he informed his king that he had personally told James that &#145;Ralegh and those who went with him should be sent as prisoners to your majesty so that you may order them to be hanged in the square in Madrid&#146;  (Cant&oacute;n, 125). Ralegh was duly taken prisoner on his return. News of his execution on 29 October 1618 reached Gondomar after he had left for Spain. Henceforth the ambassador was stigmatized by many English protestants for his marked role in the death of one of their heroes.<br>
<br>The issue that came to dominate Gondomar's first embassy was the Spanish match. With the death of Henry, prince of Wales, in 1612, eyes focused on the marriage of Prince Charles. An anti-Spanish marriage, either to the house of Bourbon or with Savoy, seemed the most likely choice, but there remained the possibility of reviving plans to marry the heir to the British throne to Philip III's daughter, the Infanta Mar&iacute;a. In England one of Gondomar's closest allies in promoting this alliance was James's consort, Queen Anne. She had a particular fondness for the ambassador not only on account of her own Catholicism and of the Habsburg blood which, she liked to point out, ran through her veins, but also because both Gondomar and the queen viewed the match as a counterbalance to the protestant marriage of her daughter, Elizabeth, to the elector palatine. In 1614 the British minister in Madrid, Sir John Digby, raised the matter with Lerma, though firmly &#145;insinuating that it was of his <i>motu proprio</i>&#146;  (Madrid, Ministerio de Asuntos Exteriores, MS 243, fol. 1<i>v</i>). By the time Gondomar's first embassy was over the terms of a possible marriage were being negotiated, though without a sense of urgency on either side.<br>
<br>The close links between Gondomar and James were apparent by the time of his first departure for home. Though he had secured his recall by citing evidence of his deteriorating health, Gondomar was feasted by the greatest nobles, including the lord chancellor, Francis Bacon, with whom he had enjoyed many a philosophical conversation, and by the earl of Arundel, who had passed on many titbits in return for his pension. His farewell from the king was memorable. Not only were &#145;the two James&#146;&#151;the king and Diego&#151;in tears, but the former granted Gondomar a series of historic concessions. He was given the right to take out of England &#145;horses, dogs and falcons&#146;  (Madrid, Biblioteca Nacional, MS 9408). Further evidence of improved relations with Spain came from the fact that seventy Catholic priests were released from prisons all over England. (When the previous ambassador had left, shortly after Gondomar's arrival in 1613, a mere dozen had been released.) It fell to Gondomar to send for the priests, take them to London, and feed them, all at his own expense, before they marched out of the city with him in July 1618. Finally, in the most symbolic gesture of all, Gondomar was presented with the Spanish artillery captured by Drake and other English corsairs as a token of esteem of a quite exceptional magnitude. The departure of the countess of Gondomar was also marked, but in a less formal way. She also received many letters from fellow Catholics thanking her for all she had done, including one particularly ornate sheaf dated Channell Row, 1 October 1618, from Francis of Kildare (no doubt Frances Fitzgerald, countess of Kildare) promising her &#145;constant love&#146; and saying how pleased she would be &#145;yf you would commaund any thing in this cuntrey&#146; that was in her power to grant.  (Real Biblioteca, Madrid, MS II-2160, fol. 45). The apprentices of London, however, had a different attitude to his departure and gave him a rowdy send off, much to James's disgust. Gondomar was informed that the king had taken the rare step of appointing members of his council to act as judges in the matter within the jurisdiction of the City of London.<h2>
<a name="GondomarKingJamesandPrinceCharles"></a>Gondomar, King James, and Prince Charles</h2>Gondomar had achieved a degree of intimacy with his royal host rarely paralleled in diplomatic history&#151;on occasion members of the English court called upon him to intervene on their behalf with King James. In 1619 William Lake wrote to him, even though he was now in Spain, in the hope that he would intercede for the release of his namesake and master Sir Thomas Lake and his family, who were imprisoned in the Tower of London. The family, Gondomar was told, had done nothing to dishonour either James or even Buckingham, and that the cause of the family's downfall (and William's loss of the office of Latin secretary to the king) was that James had received written reports from Brussels claiming that Lake was there being prayed for as &#145;the friend and protector of Catholics&#146;. Gondomar was told that they were like &#145;lakes without fishes&#146;  (Real Biblioteca, Madrid, MS II-2160, no. 4a). Indeed, such was the perception of Gondomar's influence that even Buckingham sought his help, as at Christmas 1621 when he asked him to press James to be firm with his enemy, the earl of Oxford. Gondomar was listened to by the king (but by no stretch of the imagination was what he said always followed) because of their interest in a common goal, a marriage between the prince of Wales and the infanta. A union with the foremost Catholic power would greatly enhance James's claim to be a peacemaker among Christian princes, just as much as it would advance Gondomar's career at home. Yet there was also something entirely personal about their relationship. Gondomar's scholarship and bibliophilia attracted and flattered the king, as did his mannered Castilian sense of deference. These attributes the ambassador spiced with an agile wit. An example of this combination is that Gondomar said to the monarch that he, Gondomar, spoke Latin badly, like a king, whereas James spoke Latin well, like a scholar. His sense of humour also worked with the royal favourite. When Buckingham was raised from an earldom to the rank of marquess, Gondomar, who had himself been made a count on 12 June 1617 <span class="smallcap">NS</span>, congratulated him, as he said, most genuinely, even though it pained him to see him leaving the rank of count. After his return to England, Gondomar consolidated an easy relationship with Prince Charles, thus making himself a friend to king, prince, and favourite at one and the same time. His way with words did not endear him to everyone, however. In January 1614 he had confessed to Juan Hurtado de Mendoza, his confidant at the Spanish court and the king's secretary, that complaints had come back to him about the brevity of some ambassador's letters and &#145;the longwindedness of my own&#146;  (Real Biblioteca, Madrid, MS II-2168, fol. 67<i>r</i>).<br>
<br>Despite Gondomar's personal triumph at the court of St James he was not oblivious to the underlying rivalry between Spain and Great Britain. He never forgot that he was the servant of the Spanish crown. In fact, his early dispatches as ambassador were marked by a barely concealed belligerence towards a protestant monarchy which he believed had imposed its religion against the will of the majority of its subjects. In November 1616 he composed a long dispatch dealing with all aspects of Hispano-British relations. If war were again advisable (and he felt that peace allowed England to build up her commercial wealth and naval prowess at Spain's expense), then he suggested that invasion should take place through Ireland or Scotland, where Catholic uprisings were to be expected. If through the latter, which he considered defenceless, it would take only eight days to reach London, &#145;because all is totally flat, and without a single castle or fortress anywhere&#146;  (<span class="italic">Cinco cartas</span>, 66).<br>
<br>During Gondomar's absence from England relations between Madrid and London deteriorated along with the situation in central Europe. James's son-in-law, the elector palatine, had accepted election to the Bohemian crown which the Habsburgs of Vienna felt belonged to them. In October 1619 Gondomar wrote to James to announce his return, saying that only the death of his eldest son, Lope Ambrosio, had detained him. In fact, his son had died twelve months earlier, and Gondomar was doing his utmost to avoid being sent as ambassador to Paris, let alone London. In the following month he wrote to Secretary Ciriza from Casarrubios, the village between Madrid and Toledo where he was staying, protesting yet again that he was &#145;of no use, since the matter of England requires someone who is healthy and robust&#146;  (<span class="italic">Correspondencia oficial</span>, 2.240). His unwillingness to leave Spain and Do&ntilde;a Constanza accounts in part for the sentiments he expressed when consulted about James's protestations that he neither supported the elector Frederick's actions nor was in favour of an alliance with the Dutch. Like all heretic kings, he said, James would say anything to please, and the danger was that Spain would allow herself &#145;to be taken in by his words, while each year he took money from Seville and Lisbon in such abundance, only to build up his navy and support Spain's enemies&#146;  (ibid., 2.228).<h2>
<a name="SecondembassytoEngland16201622"></a>Second embassy to England, 1620&#150;1622</h2>Gondomar left Spain in January 1620. This time he left Do&ntilde;a Constanza behind and travelled overland through France before reaching London on Wednesday 8 March. Lodgings were provided for him in the former residence of the bishops of Ely, in Hatton Gardens. He had his first audience with James the following Sunday at the royal mansion Theobalds in Hertfordshire. There a beam gave way and he took shelter in a stone doorway, while others, including the earl of Arundel, fell through a hole in the floor. Gondomar reported that this was nothing more than an unfortunate accident involving old wood and, in a rare rejection of his normal fears for his safety, he discounted the fact even though &#145;the puritans have tried and are trying to have me killed&#146;  (<span class="italic">Correspondencia oficial</span>, 2.263&#150;4). James's welcome for the ambassador was enthusiastic, and he announced in French to all that he looked just like an old friend of his, the count of Gondomar. In the subsequent discussions the king wanted to know if the war would spread out from Bohemia with the emperor pursuing his son-in-law and his family into their hereditary lands in the Upper and Lower Palatinate. Gondomar replied that this was the same as asking him what James would do if someone seized London. The ambassador faithfully reported what he called the puritan pressures on James to act decisively in defence of his grandchildren's inheritance. When a parliament was summoned in 1621 he advised Madrid that James was responding to pressures to be seen as doing something; it did not necessarily mean that war with Spain was imminent. Gondomar sent back to Madrid detailed accounts of events at Westminster. This included transmitting a copy of the Commons' declaration of June 1621. Madrid was left in no doubt that, if James ever did decide to break with Spain, then MPs at least claimed they were willing to offer up their lives and their money in defence of the Palatinate.<br>
<br>The military situation became still more acute during the autumn, when the last fortresses loyal to Frederick in the Palatinate were under threat from pro-Habsburg forces, despite the token presence of English garrisons commanded by Sir Horace Vere. James's daughter and grandchildren fled to the Netherlands and the calls for intervention increased. With the return of Digby (now Lord Digby) from Brussels after the failure to achieve a ceasefire from the emperor and the elector, Gondomar was informed that James had no alternative but to recall parliament and ask for further supply, in order to be seen to be ready to go to his family's defence. Buckingham went to see Gondomar in Hatton Gardens. The favourite revealed the divisions within the king's innermost counsels. He poured scorn on Digby, saying he just wanted to make himself immortal with the puritans as the restorer of the Palatinate. Nothing would be done in the parliament without Buckingham's knowledge and approval, since &#145;the king trusted no one so entirely as him and myself&#146;, the ambassador related, &#145;because he knew that we had no other goal but peace and the common good&#146;  (Archivo General de Simancas, MS Estado 374, fol. 308ff.). Gondomar was summoned to see the king on the following day, Friday 2 November 1621. Anxious to transmit to Spain his keenness to maintain peace, James reminded Gondomar how even Digby had spoken warmly of the Spanish king's efforts to induce the emperor to call a halt to hostilities, but he also said he was determined to help Elizabeth &#145;recover and hold onto the state that she had married into&#146;. James then uttered some of the most contested words of his reign. He would go to Newmarket and Gondomar was not to worry about what he might hear in parliament. He would leave Prince Charles to attend, &#145;with a secret commission &hellip; and if the parliament wanted to meddle in anything other than aid for the Palatinate, the Prince would dissolve it&#146;  (Pursell, 436). Money for the defence of the Rhineland was the sole reason why he was recalling the parliament, the king explained, and he himself was going to be far away so this could be undertaken without peers and MPs coming to him with their complaints and remedies. The ambassador was being reassured, nothing more. Buckingham then joined in, sniggering that they would not even send the money to the elector but use it against the common enemy. The king laughed and, taking the ambassador by the arm, said he was wrong if he thought the common enemy was the Turk. Rather it was the solemn burghers of Holland. Gondomar was asked to react coldly to the recall of parliament, so that the king's subjects would believe that a rupture with Spain was a distinct possibility. Digby, whom the royal trio blamed for the recall of parliament, also came in for some undignified mockery. Gondomar quaintly asked the king where he would think of putting the images which the puritans were making of Digby.<br>
<br>James's words to Gondomar have been portrayed as indicating that the king deliberately &#145;sabotaged the parliament of 1621&#146;  (Pursell, 428). This is hard to believe, since towards the end of the parliament James struggled to come to a compromise which would enable him to extract some taxation from MPs. Certainly Gondomar feared that the parliament might pressurize the king into breaking with Spain and pursuing an anti-Catholic policy throughout the Stuart dominions as well as abroad. After hearing reports that his king had been disrespectfully spoken of during debates in the Commons, Gondomar informed Madrid that he had written at the end of November reminding James of the promise he had made before the parliament began. The ambassador apparently said that, had he not trusted &#145;the word and goodness of the king that he would punish and set things right with the speed and severity that was called for, I would have left his kingdoms within three days&#146;  (ibid., 440). Gondomar added that if only he had an army with him he would punish those responsible himself. That his threats were real enough is shown by the fact that he certainly wrote directly to the duke of Alburquerque, the Spanish ambassador in Rome, advising him that no further action should be taken on the dispensation for Charles's marriage, &#145;because though the king's intention is without doubt good, it is not known what he will choose to do, as he is not here&#146;, he being still at Newmarket. Gondomar's audacity meant that he had to write separately to his king, justifying why he had sent instructions to a fellow ambassador  (Archivo General de Simancas, MS Estado 2558, nos. 17 and 16). In January 1622 parliament was formally dissolved. Gondomar was shown the draft of a proclamation announcing its failure, and he successfully lobbied for direct references to the abuse of the king of Spain to be removed on the grounds that this would be highly disrespectful to a prince with whom James claimed to enjoy amicable relations. James now needed the Spanish match more than ever, and Gondomar intensified his efforts to bring about a marriage on Spanish terms. He felt that if the prince of Wales could be induced to come to Madrid to collect his bride then it would be possible to persuade him to convert to Catholicism.<h2>
<a name="ThefailureoftheSpanishmatchandthedeathofGondomar"></a>The failure of the Spanish match and the death of Gondomar</h2>Gondomar left England for the last time at the end of May 1622. With James's full approval he was recalled to Madrid in order to negotiate with Lord Digby, who had arrived in Spain to finalize details of the marriage between Charles and Mar&iacute;a. Before he left Gondomar had concentrated his efforts on persuading Charles that it might be necessary for him to travel to the court of Philip IV (who had succeeded his father in March 1621). In an astonishing aside, Charles apparently told him that if he were to send word from Madrid that he should come to collect his bride, he would travel in disguise, with just two servants in attendance, to &#145;place himself in the hands&#146; of his most Catholic majesty  (Redworth, 406). Negotiations carried on apace in Madrid, and in September 1622 Gondomar penned a letter to Buckingham, claiming that &#145;the decision has already been taken, and with enthusiasm, that the Prince of Wales should mount Spain&#146;. Charles was advised to come to Madrid &#145;post haste&#146;  (BL, Harley MS 1583). Though Gondomar was premature in his advice, by December a final marriage treaty was sent to England, and confirmed early in January 1623. Gondomar's endorsement and the subsequent treaty helps explain Charles's decision to leave for Madrid the following month; he travelled in the belief that his bride was waiting for him. When he arrived in Madrid, Gondomar was the first Spaniard to be informed. His comment was &#145;Nunc dimittis&#146; (&#145;Lord, now let your servant depart in peace&#146;). He duly reported the prince's arrival to Philip IV's favourite, the count-duke of Olivares. Gondomar was immediately promoted to the council of state. Both Gondomar and Olivares initially assumed that Charles had come to convert to Catholicism before taking his bride. By the time Charles left Madrid at the end of August 1623, Gondomar's advice was to wait until James actually carried out his promises to grant full toleration of Catholics before dispatching the infanta. As it turned out, Charles and Buckingham had irrevocably turned against the Spanish match. Within a year war seemed inevitable with Great Britain, and Gondomar was ordered at the end of October 1624 to return to London. Again he cited ill health and his departure was postponed until March 1625. He travelled as far as Ir&uacute;n, at which point news of James's death reached him. This he used to delay his journey further. After a stay in France, where ironically he was obliged as ambassador-extraordinary to offer his congratulations on the news of the prince of Wales's marriage to a French princess, he reached Brussels in October 1625. He drew up his will in January 1626; despite his deteriorating health he managed to commence his return to Spain. He died on 2 October 1626 <span class="smallcap">NS</span> in Casa de la Reina in Logro&ntilde;o; he was survived by his second wife. His body was transferred to the family vault in San Benito el Viejo in Valladolid and remained there until it was disturbed by French invaders in the nineteenth century. In 1990 the crypt of the church was restored to allow the count's remains to be returned to where he had always wished to be buried.<br>
<br>Gondomar's notoriety during his time in England ensured that, for more protestant writers, he was the incarnation of the Machiavellian diplomat. Thomas Scott caricatured him in <span class="italic">Vox Populi, or, Newes from Spayne</span> (1620) and in <span class="italic">The Second Part of Vox Populi, or, Gondomar Appearing in the Likeness of Matchiavell in a Spanissh Parliament</span> (1624). In the following year he was again lampooned in Thomas Middleton's <span class="italic">A Game at Chesse</span>, which ran for nine nights before packed audiences at the Globe Theatre before being taken off, the playwright imprisoned, and the actors fined.<br>
