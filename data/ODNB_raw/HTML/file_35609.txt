<span class="headword">Price,  (Frederick George) Hilton</span>  (1842&#150;1909), <span class="occ">antiquary and banker</span>, born in London on 20 August 1842, was the son of Frederick William Price (<i>d</i>. 1888), for many years partner and eventually chief acting partner in the banking firm of Child &amp; Co. Educated at Crawford College, Maidenhead, in 1860 he entered Child's Bank, where he succeeded his father as chief acting partner. Much of his early leisure was devoted to the history of Child's Bank, and in 1875 he published <span class="italic">Temple Bar, or, Some Account of ye Marygold, No. 1 Fleet Street</span> (2nd edn, 1902), where Child's Bank had been established in the seventeenth century. In 1877 he brought out a useful <span class="italic">Handbook of London Bankers</span> (enlarged edn, 1890&#150;91). He was a member of the council of the Bankers' Institute and of the Central Bankers' Association.<br>
<br>Price's life was mainly devoted to archaeology. Always keenly interested in the prehistoric as well as historic annals of London, he formed a fine collection of antiquities of the stone and bronze ages and the Roman period. It also included Samian ware vessels imported during the first and second centuries from the south of France, English pottery ranging from the Norman times to the nineteenth century, tiles, pewter vessels and plates, medieval inkhorns, coins, tokens (many from the burial pits on the site of Christ's Hospital), and other artefacts. His collection was secured to form in 1911 the nucleus of the London Museum at Kensington Palace.<br>
<br>Interested in excavations in Britain and abroad, Price took a leading part in the excavation of the Roman villa at Brading in the Isle of Wight, the remains of which were by his exertions temporarily opened to the public, and on which, in conjunction with J. E. Price, he read a paper before the Royal Institute of British Architects on 13 December 1880. He was treasurer for the research fund for the excavations at Silchester or Calleva Attrebatum, on the subject of which he read a paper at the Society of Antiquaries on 11 February 1886. At the same time he was actively engaged in studying and collecting Egyptian antiquities. In 1886 he described part of his collection in the <span class="italic">Proceedings of the Society of Biblical Archaeology</span> (of which he was elected member in 1884, vice-president in 1901). A large selection from his collection was exhibited at the Burlington Fine Arts Club in 1895, and two years later he published an elaborate catalogue of his Egyptian antiquities, which was followed in 1908 by a supplement. In 1905 he was elected president of the Egypt Exploration Fund, which he had joined in 1885.<br>
<br>Price was an enthusiastic member of the Society of Antiquaries of London, of which he became a fellow on 19 January 1882. He was elected director on 23 April 1894, and retained the post until his death. A keen numismatist, he joined the Royal Numismatic Society in 1897; he was also elected fellow of the Geological Society in 1872. He was a voluminous contributor to the journals of most of the societies and institutions to which he belonged. A valuable series of illustrated papers on &#145;Signs of old London&#146; appeared between 1903 and 1908 in consecutive issues of the <span class="italic">London Topographical Record</span> (2&#150;5).<br>
<br>Price married on 5 November 1867 Christina, daughter of William Bailey of Oaken, Staffordshire, with whom he had one son and one daughter. They lived at 17 Collingham Gardens, South Kensington. He died at Hotel Gallia, Cannes, France, on 14 March 1909, after an operation, and was buried at Finchley in the next grave to his father. His wife survived him. He bequeathed &pound;100 to the Society of Antiquaries for the research fund. His books, coins, old spoons, and miscellaneous objects of art and virtu fetched at auction (1909&#150;11) the sum of &pound;2606 10<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>. His Egyptian collection realized &pound;12,040 8<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>. at Sothebys on 12&#150;21 July 1911. The same firm sold his coins on 17&#150;19 May 1909 and 7&#150;8 April 1910, 575 lots realizing &pound;2309 9<i>s</i>.<br>
