<span class="headword">Jackson,  Humphrey</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1721, <em>d.</em> 1801), <span class="occ">chemist and inventor</span>, who was baptized at Hinderwell, Yorkshire, on 28 February 1721, was the son of Thomas Jackson, later of Stockton-on-Tees, co. Durham. He was apprenticed in 1735 to a Stockton apothecary and surgeon. He later moved to London, where he set up as a chemist in Upper East Smithfield during 1743. <span class="italic">Reflexions Concerning the Virtues of Tar Water</span> (1744), his first book, cogently argued the case for his product over the well-known medicine of George Berkeley, bishop of Cloyne. His chemical skill was further evidenced by experimental findings in 1751 in support of the famous fever powder patented by Dr Robert James and by his patent specification of 1753 (no. 680) for a very successful cordial bitter tincture. Jackson's next work, <span class="italic">An Essay on Bread</span> (1758), defended bakers and millers against allegations concerning adulteration of bread levelled by Peter Markham and James Manning; it was the first reliable book on the chemical detection of food adulteration. In 1768 Jackson patented a method for hardening and preserving wood (no. 910), which was approved by the College of Physicians and effectively applied to several warships. It was publicized by an eight-page advertisement (1770) that described thirty-one items tested at his Great Tower Hill works, ranging from brewing implements, building components, and wooden pipes for London waterworks to twenty-five new standing gun carriages treated for the Tower of London garrison.<br>
<br>Jackson obtained another patent in 1760 (no. 749), following a journey to Russia, for manufacturing isinglass from British materials at his own factory, which employed fifteen workmen. His book, <span class="italic">An Essay on British Isinglass</span> (1765), graphically described his chemical method for producing isinglass from the air bladders of certain fishes. The Society of Arts, of which he became a member in 1760, serving on its chemistry and trade committees (1760&#150;61), awarded him a premium in 1766 for importing American sturgeon and he informed Benjamin Franklin about a technique for making glue from this fish. Elected FRS on 19 November 1772, Jackson contributed a paper to the <span class="italic">Philosophical Transactions</span> for 1773, stressing that over forty tons of isinglass had been processed from fish in the Great Lakes which resembled those imported expensively from Russia. Captain James Cook, on completing his second global circumnavigation, highly praised Jackson's beer concentrate, which had been used for its antiscorbutic qualities. The <i>Resolution</i> and the <i>Discovery</i> also carried it on Cook's last voyage.<br>
<br>Jackson married three times; first, in 1743, to Elizabeth Savory (<i>d</i>. 1748). His second marriage, in 1763, was to Mary or Maria, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18175/', "Benjamin Martin")</script>, public lecturer and instrument maker. She died at their home in Woolwich Common in 1784. His third marriage was to Jane (probably Chamberlain), a widow. Nothing is known of any children.<br>
<br>Jackson received an MD from Aberdeen University in 1761. A freemason, he wrote a Masonic ode and song, and was treasurer of the Soul Captain's Lodge near Hermitage Bridge, at London Docks, in the 1750s. He was a JP for the Tower of London Liberty (1772), Kent (1780), and Middlesex (1783), and wrote on 27 March 1791 to William Pitt, the prime minister, detailing improvements in the impress system. When he died in Tottenham on 29 June 1801, Jackson was the owner of property there and at Woolwich, Wapping, and Tower Street.<br>
