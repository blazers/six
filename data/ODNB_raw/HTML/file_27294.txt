</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Thomson,  Charles Poulett</span>, Baron Sydenham  (1799&#150;1841), <span class="occ">politician and governor-in-chief of British North America</span>, was born on 13 September 1799 at Waverley Abbey, Wimbledon, Surrey, the third son and youngest of the nine children of John Thomson (after 1820 John Poulett Thomson), a London merchant engaged in trade with Russia and the Baltic, and his wife, Charlotte, the daughter of John Jacob, a Salisbury physician. Educated privately, at the age of sixteen Thomson entered the family firm in St Petersburg. In 1817 he left Russia because of poor health, but embarked on several lengthy continental tours before joining the firm's London office. He returned to Russia from 1821 until 1824, when he settled permanently in London. Thomson was not particularly interested in business, travelled frequently on the continent, and was an early advocate of free trade, despite his family's support for protection. As an advocate of parliamentary reform and the ballot, he was a member of the Political Economy Club.<br>
<br>With the support of Jeremy Bentham and Joseph Hume, and at great financial cost, Thomson was elected as MP for Dover in May 1826. In the whig administration formed in November 1830 he became vice-president of the Board of Trade and treasurer of the navy. Since his superior, Lord Auckland, was a nonentity, Thomson conducted the real business of the board and helped to draft the abortive free-trade budget of 1831, thus incurring the undying enmity of the protectionists and completely alienating his family. He was re-elected for Dover in 1830 and 1831. In 1832 he was elected for both Dover and Manchester but chose to sit for the important industrial centre of Manchester, where he was re-elected in 1834 and 1837. From June until November 1834 and again after April 1835 he served as president of the Board of Trade, filling the department with free-traders, making numerous minor reductions in customs regulations, and negotiating free-trade agreements with several European countries. He dramatically expanded the responsibilities of the board by exercising more effective control over railway bills and bank charters and attempting to extend greater superintendence over colonial legislation. But Thomson, whom Charles Greville described as &#145;the greatest coxcomb I ever saw, and the vainest dog&#146;  (<span class="italic">Greville Memoirs</span>, 3.230), was not particularly effective in the Commons or popular with his aristocratic whig colleagues. Early in 1839 he was passed over for the post of chancellor of the exchequer, and he was increasingly disillusioned by the cabinet's failure to adopt a major change in economic policy and embrace free trade. Suffering from declining health and aware of the growing unpopularity of the whig government, he declined the post of chancellor in the summer of 1839; on 6 September, however, he became governor-in-chief of British North America, and received an unusually high salary and the pledge of a peerage.<br>
<br>Thomson had played only a minor part in formulating the cabinet's response to the rebellions of 1837 in Upper and Lower Canada, but he supported the recommendation made in the 1839 Durham report for an immediate union of the two Canadas, and before departing he met with Durham, once his friend, and received the latter's blessing. He arrived at Quebec city and assumed control of the administration of Lower Canada on 19 October 1839. His priority was to secure legislative support for union. In Lower Canada he faced few difficulties, since the assembly had been replaced by an appointed council dominated by the British minority. Although Thomson admired French culture (and French cuisine, which he introduced into the colony) and spoke French fluently, like Durham he believed it was undesirable&#151;and ultimately impossible&#151;for French Canadians to preserve their separate nationality on the North American continent. He saw the gradual assimilation of the French Canadians as essential to maintain imperial control, and he pushed through the council after two days' debate a union on terms which were clearly unfair to Lower Canada. He was castigated by the French-Canadian press, which satirically referred to him as &#145;notre poulet&#146;  (Monet, 37).<br>
<br>Thomson then travelled to Toronto, and assumed control of the government of Upper Canada on 23 November 1839 in order to persuade the Upper Canadian legislature to vote itself out of existence. Although he rejected the more extreme demands of the conservative-dominated assembly, he promised an imperial loan to pay the huge public debt of the colony and equal representation for both Canadas within the union. He managed to win the support of the Upper Canadian reformers by appointing Robert Baldwin as solicitor-general. After securing the support of the Upper Canadian legislature early in 1840, he sent home the draft of a union bill. He also sent home a bill which, although modified in London, resolved the controversial issue of the clergy reserves. Having prorogued the Upper Canadian legislature he returned to Lower Canada, where he shoved through the special council a series of ordinances designed to pave the way for union. Particularly important were those incorporating the cities of Quebec and Montreal, reorganizing the system of justice, and establishing an efficient police force. Although he failed to persuade any prominent French-Canadian politician to join his administration, he refused to accede to the more extreme demands of the British minority, and his actions helped convince French-Canadian reformers such as Louis-Hippolyte LaFontaine to moderate their opposition to the union. To Thomson's disappointment the whig government, in order to get the consent of Sir Robert Peel and the Conservatives, dropped his arrangements for the creation of municipal institutions and inflated the number of constituencies dominated by the British minority in Lower Canada. None the less, the <span class="roman">Union Act</span> of 1840 was largely Thomson's work, and he arranged for the union to come into effect on 10 February 1841. On 19 August 1840 he was raised to the peerage as Baron Sydenham and on 19 August 1841 was further rewarded with a GCB (civil division).<br>
<br>At the request of the secretary of state for the colonies, Lord John Russell, Thomson, although suffering from gout, travelled to Nova Scotia in July 1840 to try to resolve the dispute between Lieutenant-Governor Sir Colin Campbell and the Nova Scotian assembly. On his return he persuaded Russell to dismiss Campbell and appoint a more conciliatory governor. During the trip he also visited Prince Edward Island and New Brunswick, where he was particularly impressed by Lieutenant-Governor Sir John Harvey's success in working with the New Brunswick assembly. Ironically, when Harvey failed to take aggressive measures to prevent American encroachments in the disputed territory between Maine and New Brunswick in 1840, Thomson complained to Russell, who dismissed Harvey.<br>
<br>The first elections to the assembly of the united province of Canada were held in March and early April 1841. Lord Sydenham, in effect acting as his own prime minister, interfered flagrantly in the elections and managed to get the support of a majority in the assembly, but the moderate Upper Canadian reformers led by Robert Baldwin had become disenchanted and they constructed an alliance with the French-Canadian reformers led by LaFontaine. On 12 June, when Baldwin demanded that Sydenham reorganize his executive council and give all the seats to the Baldwin&#150;LaFontaine reform alliance, Sydenham dismissed him as solicitor-general. Although Sydenham was able to push a number of important measures through the first session of the legislature, which he convened on 15 June, his majority was increasingly precarious. On 3 September the reformers sought to embarrass him by demanding that he accept that the executive council would be reconstructed if it lost the confidence of the assembly, thus in effect conceding the principle of responsible government. Sydenham refused to make an absolute commitment. He continued to act as his own prime minister and to dictate the policies of the government, but his ministers increasingly functioned like a cabinet and indicated they would resign if they lost the confidence of the assembly. In fact, Sydenham's ability to command the support of the assembly was already breaking down when he had a riding accident and contracted lockjaw. On 19 September 1841 he died, in agony, in Kingston, Canada West. He was buried in St George's Church, Kingston, on 24 September. Although he was known as a &#145;sensualist&#146; whose affairs with married women caused a scandal in Canada  (Richardson, 186), he had never married and left no heirs.<br>
<br>From an imperial perspective Thomson was probably the most successful governor ever sent to Canada. He made union possible and established a workable form of responsible government, although in line with imperial policy he did not concede the principle itself. French Canadians did not view his regime sympathetically, and the measures he introduced to promote assimilation were quickly abandoned after his death. The union of the Canadas, however, endured until 1867 and laid the foundation for confederation. Irving Abella has described Thomson as &#145;a ruthless Machiavellian, unprincipled and cunning, selfish and egotistic, autocratic, narrow-minded, and unbelievably vain&#146;  (Abella, 326&#150;7). All of this is true, if overstated, but no governor had greater influence on the future development of British North America&#151;not even Lord Durham.<br>
