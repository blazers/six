<span class="headword">Barton,  John</span>  (1789&#150;1852), <span class="occ">political economist and botanist</span>, was born on 11 June 1789 in Southwark, London, the son of John Barton (1755&#150;1789) and his second wife, Elizabeth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Horne (1760&#150;1833). He was the half-brother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/11834/', "Maria Hack")</script>, children's writer, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1595/', "Bernard Barton")</script>, poet. The elder John Barton, a manufacturer, was a member of the first committee formed for the abolition of the slave trade in 1787. Towards the end of his life he was engaged in the malting business in Hertford. After his death in 1789, the children were brought up by Mrs Barton and her family in Tottenham, Middlesex. A man of independent means, Barton travelled widely, visiting France and Italy and possibly venturing as far afield as Poland and Russia, and pursued interests in economics and botany. In 1827 he left the Society of Friends and joined the Church of England. Throughout his life he was a staunch supporter of mechanics' institutes and schools, and he helped to establish the Chichester savings bank. His <span class="italic">A Lecture on the Geography of Plants</span> (1827) shows Barton to have been well read in German scientific literature, notably in A. Humboldt's work on the geographical distribution of plants.<br>
<br>Although he never published the systematic economic treatise which might have established his reputation, Barton's closely argued pamphlets were influential. His <span class="italic">Observations on the Circumstances which Influence the Condition of the Labouring Classes</span> (1817) questioned the linkage by Thomas Malthus of population growth to increasing wage rates, arguing that the likely age of first marriage and thus birth rates were influenced, not by wage rates or poor-relief practices, but by perceived employment prospects which, paradoxically, were best when wages were low. A rise in wage levels, Barton argued, encouraged employers to invest in labour-saving technology. In opposition to David Ricardo, he maintained that only when circulating capital increased did employment rise: any increase in fixed capital was unlikely to stimulate, and might significantly diminish, the demand for labour.<br>
<br>Barton's pamphlets influenced both Ricardo and Malthus. In the third edition of his <span class="italic">The Principles of Political Economy</span> (1821) Ricardo added a chapter on machinery, conceding that Barton &#145;had taken a correct view of some of the effects of an increasing amount of fixed capital on the condition of the labouring classes&#146;, but maintaining that there was a, perhaps imperfect, positive relationship between increases in capital and the demand for labour. Malthus accepted Barton's contention that any increase in poor relief should be measured, not in nominal terms, but in real monetary terms.<br>
<br>Later Barton became increasingly preoccupied with the effects of overpopulation. In his <span class="italic">An inquiry into the causes of the progressive depreciation of agricultural labour in modern times</span> (1820) and <span class="italic">A Statement of the Consequences Likely to Ensue from our Growing Excess of Population</span> (1830) Barton argued that only where land was cheap and plentiful would economic growth be maximized and accordingly favoured emigration schemes and colonization of Canada and other territories. He dismissed claims that free trade and cheap food could transform the economy, perceiving instead a tendency to overstock the labour market in industrial areas. The expansion of capital and population beyond a certain point was &#145;a national evil&#146;, creating social problems which could be offset by greater prosperity. Accordingly Barton favoured the maintenance of agricultural protection. By 1846 he was deeply worried by the likely effects of free trade on monetary policy, and in two letters to <span class="italic">The Standard</span> he argued that, by increasing the demand for imports, free trade would precipitate an outflow of gold and thereby provoke a monetary crisis. His last pamphlet, <span class="italic">The Monetary Crisis of 1847</span> (1847), offered a brief vindication of this analysis.<br>
<br>In 1811 Barton married Ann Woodrouffe Smith (<i>d</i>. 1822). With his second wife, Frances (Fanny) Rickman (<i>d</i>. 1842), daughter of James Rickman, he had six surviving children, one of whom, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30631/', "John Barton (1836&#150;1908)")</script>, became a missionary in India. Barton died in Chichester on 10 March 1852. His <span class="italic">Economic Writings</span> were edited by G. Sotiroff (2 vols., 1962).<br>
