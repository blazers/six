<span class="headword">Tilt,  Charles</span>  (1797&#150;1861), <span class="occ">bookseller and publisher</span>, was born in June 1797, the son of William Tilt, a confectioner of St Paul's Churchyard, London, and his wife, Mary. It is thought that the Tilt family originated in Worcestershire and had a connection with the family of Oliver Cromwell. Charles Tilt attended boarding-schools outside London, but after his father's death was apprenticed by his mother at fourteen to Mr Whitehead, a bookseller and stationer at Portsea, Hampshire. He returned to London in January 1817 and worked intermittently at Hatchards and other bookselling businesses, and from 1818 to 1819 at Longman &amp; Co., where his brother Henry (<i>d</i>. 1829) was also probably, by that time, an employee. He returned to Hatchards in April 1820 and continued there until September 1826.<br>
<br>On 9 October of that year Tilt started his own extremely lucrative publishing and bookselling business at 86 Fleet Street, at the corner of St Bride's Passage or Avenue, where he remained until 1840. He shrewdly marketed richly illustrated books in a variety of formats appropriate for all classes. He frequently used the extensive side windows of his shop to display his offerings, which were often so popularly received that railings were required to hold back the crowds who came to view them, and their availability was reported in newspapers such as <span class="italic">The Times</span>. Besides gift books, annuals, travel books, and children's literature, Tilt published novelty items such as an almanac which would fit neatly into the top of a man's hat, and a series, <span class="roman">Tilt's Miniature Classics</span>, which was sold with a satin or rosewood cabinet and a glass door and lock. On 16 December 1828 Tilt married Jane May (<i>d</i>. 1858) of Reading; they had one daughter, also named Jane May, who married the physical chemist <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/33418/', "John Hall Gladstone (1827&#150;1902)")</script>.<br>
<br>Like many in his trade, Tilt was regularly involved in copyright and remuneration disputes with authors, artists, editors, and his fellow publishers. Thomas Hood, George Cruikshank, William Makepeace Thackeray, J. M. W. Turner, and Mary Eliza Lamb were among those who were unhappy with Tilt's treatment of them at one time or another, but these disagreements were nearly always resolved to Tilt's benefit, while he maintained the persona of a genial commonsensical tradesman. His wealth from the 1830s onwards is often mentioned by contemporaries. The greater part of his success derived from his virtual monopoly of the early lithography market, which he achieved by importing at low cost sheets of elaborate designs from the continent. He was also well known for purchasing the rights to previously published prints by famous artists after copyright had lapsed, having them re-engraved on steel plates on a smaller scale by other less well-known artists, and selling the newer versions at comparatively inexpensive rates while retaining the original and usually much more famous artists' names on the new plates. J. M. W. Turner complained before the lord mayor of London about such treatment in regard to some illustrations that he completed for some of Walter Scott's works. But the account of the hearing in <span class="italic">The Times</span> of 16 October 1833 gives Tilt the last word: &#145;Oh, Mr. Turner, you ought to let your brother artists have a little slice. (Laughter).&#146;<br>
<br>Tilt's collaborations with George Cruikshank and Thomas Hood were the most significant over the course of his career. Hood knew Tilt by at least 1827, when the author's mother-in-law Charlotte Reynolds published through Tilt <span class="italic">Mrs. Leslie and her Grandchildren</span> under the <i>nom de plume</i> Mrs. Hamerton. Tilt published the second volume of <span class="italic">Hood's Whims and Oddities</span> (November 1827), Hood's <span class="italic">The Epping Hunt</span> with illustrations by Cruikshank (September 1829), and an edition of his <span class="italic">Dream of Eugene Aram</span> (November 1831). Tilt also published four volumes of Hood's popular <span class="italic">Comic Annual</span>, but after an intense quarrel&#151;probably over Tilt's unwillingness to publish Hood's novel <span class="italic">Tylney Hall</span>&#151;the relationship ended with the publication in November 1833 of the 1834 <span class="italic">Comic Annual</span>. Hood died twelve years later, after feuding with several other publishers and persisting in his ill will towards Tilt.<br>
<br>The association with Cruikshank also began as early as 1827, but took on a more significant character with the publication of Cruikshank's nine-part <span class="italic">My Sketch Book</span> (1833&#150;6) and his <span class="italic">Comic Almanack</span> (1834&#150;52), which was edited for its first four years by James Henry Vizetelly (Rigdum Funnidos). Along with a fictional co-publisher (Mustapha Syried [must-have-as-a-read] of Constantinople) Tilt issued <span class="italic">The Loving Ballad of Lord Bateman</span> (1839) with famous illustrations by Cruikshank, and text almost certainly by Charles Dickens but long associated with Thackeray, who may have contributed the bogus scholarly apparatus to the book. Until Tilt's death he and his successors were Cruikshank's primary publishers, especially when the artist wanted complete control of projects such as <span class="italic">My Sketch Book</span> and the later <span class="italic">Omnibus</span> (May 1841&#150;January 1842), edited by Laman Blanchard with contributions by Frederick Marryat, Horace Mayhew, and Thackeray.<br>
<br>In 1840 Tilt chose from his employees a junior partner, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/47444/', "David Bogue (1807/8&#150;1856)")</script>, who in 1843 assumed, according to Tilt's plan, sole ownership of the firm. The firm's imprint from late 1840 until 1843 was Tilt and Bogue, but then became simply David Bogue or D. Bogue. Tilt retired from publishing to his house at Clapham Rise and then travelled extensively on the continent and in the Middle East, writing for children a popular account of one trip: <span class="italic">The Boat and the Caravan: a Family Tour through Egypt and Syria</span> (1847).<br>
<br>After 1848 there were fewer trips abroad and Tilt now divided his time between Brighton, London, and Bath, where he was residing at the time of his wife's death in Southsea, Hampshire, on 27 September 1858. At the untimely death of his successor Bogue in November 1856, Tilt served as executor of his estate. Tilt was a short man, &#145;with dark curly hair, bright eyes and a square jaw&#146;  (Gladstone). He remained active in various philanthropic activities in Bath until his death from heart disease at his home, 28 Pembridge Gardens, Bayswater, London, on 28 September 1861, leaving Bogue's estate still not entirely settled.<br>
