<span class="headword">Dunhill,  Alfred</span>  (1872&#150;1959), <span class="occ">manufacturer of pipes and tobacco</span>, was born on 30 September 1872 at 2 Church Path, Hornsey, Middlesex, the second son of five children of Henry Dunhill (1842&#150;1901), a master blind-maker, and his wife and cousin, Jane, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Styles (1843&#150;1922). Henry Dunhill ran his business from the Euston Road, making among other things, accessories for horse-drawn vehicles. The young Alfred joined the firm when he was fifteen, following his formal education at a private Hampstead school and by tutors. In 1893 he acquired the business and quickly demonstrated his perspicacity and eye for the main chance by switching emphasis to the needs of the fledgeling motor industry. By the time of his first marriage, to Alice Stapleton (1873/4&#150;1945) on 15 June 1895, he had established a separate business, Dunhill's Motorities, selling everything but the motor to early enthusiasts of the sport. Five years later he set up the Discount Motor Car Company, selling his accessories through mail order. However, Dunhill was determined to capture a good corner of the market and made the decision to tap its top end by forgoing mail order and entering the world of retail sales. In 1902 he opened his first shop in Conduit Street, Mayfair, selling clothing and accessories to both chauffeurs and their employers. The days of draughty driving offered wide scope for Dunhill's creative talents and indeed it was the chance idea of a &#145;windshield pipe&#146;, designed to protect sportsmen from the dangers of flying sparks, that was to herald his entry into the crowded world of the tobacco trade. The patent application for this unique pipe in 1904 prompted him to open his first tobacconist shop in Duke Street, St James's, in 1907. It was evident from the choice of location that Dunhill was intent on offering the very best to a select clientele. His shop, more redolent of a gentleman's club, offered all manner of pleasures for the discerning smoker: individual blends of exotic tobaccos and a whole array of smokers' requisites combined to create a heady mix of opulence and preserve.<br>
<br>By 1910 Dunhill had taken additional premises in Duke Street to accommodate more comfortably the thirteen employees engaged in cigarette manufacturing. The expansion of the business was enhanced further when Dunhill's youngest brother, Herbert, and his eldest son, Alfred, joined him in 1912, followed by his second son, Vernon, in the following year. The war provided the company with its real opportunity to prosper&#151;not only to exploit the mail-order business but to change the image of the smoker, from simperer to decent, home-loving soldier, evoking memories of home and hearth with a flick of the match.<br>
<br>However, it is the pipe that has enjoyed the closest and most enduring association with the name Dunhill. His 1924 monograph, <span class="italic">The Pipe Book</span>, reveals an encyclopaedic knowledge of the history of the pipe as well as claims to its long-standing appeal. The self-seasoned briar root, used for the manufacture of all top-rate pipes, was hailed by Dunhill as the ideal pipe material, and although briar pipes sold by the company were nearly twice as expensive as any others available there was never a shortage of customers.<br>
<br>The post-war period witnessed both expansion and the commissioning of fresh products. The company always ensured its products were covered by patent and trade mark, a policy prosecuted with vigour from the outset. The early 1920s saw the wholesale and export side of the business move to Notting Hill Gate, close to the pipe and cigarette division located at Campden Hill Road. In 1921 the firm received its first royal warrant, as tobacconist to Edward, prince of Wales; it enjoyed his loyal custom even during his years in exile. The 1920s also saw the opening of shops in New York, Toronto, and Paris as well as a branch in the City of London to serve the appreciative businessman.<br>
<br>The inter-war years were also a time for innovation and invention. The Unique lighter, a product that Dunhill and his brother had much interest in developing, proved a vast improvement on the undependable match and sold in thousands. This pocket version was followed by a variety of table models and joined a long list of other original ideas, including the somewhat bizarre Lite-up handbag for ladies who needed to see its contents in the dark.<br>
<br>Dunhill's decision to chair his final meeting of the company on 5 February 1929 was precipitated by personal circumstances. Having placed the firm on a steady course, he felt able to leave his son Alfred in charge. He left his wife and journeyed to Worthing to join his mistress of long standing, Vera Mildred Wright (<i>b</i>. 1902/3), who changed her name to his by deed poll. Together they enjoyed their autumnal years, yachting, fishing, and motoring around the south coast. He married Vera on 28 March 1945, shortly after the death of his wife. He died at Hopedene Nursing Home, Wordsworth Road, Worthing on 2 January 1959, and was cremated at Golders Green crematorium. His wife survived him.<br>
