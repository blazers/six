<span class="headword">Cole,  William</span>  (<em>c.</em>1622&#150;1701), <span class="occ">naturalist</span>, was born in Dorset, from where his family moved to Salisbury about 1639 and thence to Southsea in 1644. Cole seems to have remained there until at least the mid-1660s; about 1668 he moved to Bristol where he obtained the post of surveyor of the customs (1671), which he retained until 1691. At Bristol, and at the small estate in Bradfield, Wiltshire, which he held in right of his wife, Anne James, he built up substantial collections of natural rarities, local and foreign, carried out experimental fieldwork, and corresponded with fellow natural philosophers. Sir Robert Southwell was an active and helpful patron, and he was also well known to Robert Hooke. He corresponded regularly with Robert Plot, John Ray, Martin Lister, John Woodward, and Edward Lhwyd.<br>
<br>Cole's early researches mainly centred on botany&#151;particularly lichens and fungi. A letter of 30 September 1669 from him to Hooke (published in Hooke's <span class="italic">Lampas</span>, 1677) made important advances in explaining the reproduction of ferns. Thereafter Cole devoted many years to an (unsuccessful) attempt to find an experimental proof of the spontaneous generation of insects. He collected shells and fossils intensively, as well as investigating disparate subjects such as the crystalline structure of snowflakes, oysters, and the <i>Murex lapillus</i>. He published a detailed account of specimens of the last, gathered from near Minehead, to show that they belonged to the family that produced Tyrian purple in the Roman world.<br>
<br>Cole was a strong supporter of the natural history movement organized at Oxford by Robert Plot, and he presented many specimens to the new Ashmolean Museum there. From the early 1690s he engaged in protracted discussions with the university about donating to it his whole collection if the university would undertake publication of his <span class="italic">Generall Natural History</span>. Edward Lhwyd, Plot's successor at the Ashmolean, was eager to acquire Cole's collection because it consisted only of natural things, and because Cole had been careful to record the provenance of his specimens. These numbered well over a thousand with very few duplicates. Despite dragging on for some ten years the negotiations came to no conclusion. Cole died intestate in early October 1701, and the collection was sold elsewhere. He was buried on 12 October at Bradfield.<br>
<br>Although from his letters Cole emerges as a somewhat pompous, rather self-opinionated, person who could easily become tedious, he was also a very seriously committed naturalist who combined his passion for natural things with a deeply felt providentialist view of the world. His life exemplifies that interpenetration of natural theology with natural philosophy which his activities helped to establish.<br>
