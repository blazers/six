<span class="headword">Monteath, Sir  James</span>  (1847&#150;1929), <span class="occ">administrator in India</span>, was born at Guileburn, Lockerbie, on 7 September 1847, the fourth son of Thomas Monteath, of the Bank of Scotland, who came from an old Perthshire family, and his wife, Hannah Johnstone. Monteath attended the Royal Belfast Academical Institution, and afterwards Queen's College, Belfast, where he graduated MA. In 1868 he passed the open competition for the Indian Civil Service and in November 1870 arrived in Bombay to begin a career in the Bombay presidency [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/95501', "competition wallahs")</script>].<br>
<br>Monteath was initially posted to Dharwar as an assistant collector and thence, in October 1871, to Kanara, where for several months in 1873 he was engaged on the Kanara land assessment case. Subsequently he wrote chapters on the land revenue administration and history of Kanara for the <span class="italic">Bombay Gazetteer</span> (1883). On 9 December 1872, while still based at Kanara, he married Amelia (<i>d</i>. 1927), daughter of Thomas Hunter of Belfast, a member of a Scottish family long settled in Ireland, with whom he had five sons and three daughters.<br>
<br>In April 1874 Monteath began a short stint as under-secretary to the government in the revenue, financial, and general departments, the first of many postings in the secretariat. He returned to Kanara in February 1875, but was called back to the secretariat in 1878, after which he undertook only one extensive period of district work as the collector of Bijapur from 1892 to 1895. He was private secretary to Lord Reay, governor of Bombay, from 1885 until 1890, and in July 1896 was appointed chief secretary to the government of Bombay.<br>
<br>As chief secretary it fell to Monteath to deal with the Bombay famine of 1896&#150;7, an onerous duty for which he was created a CSI. In spite of the official recognition, however, implicit criticism of his famine administration appeared in the reports of the two famine commissions of 1899 and 1901, each of which castigated the Bombay government for over-enthusiastic collection of land revenue during the crisis.<br>
<br>In August 1900 Lord Northcote, governor of Bombay, appointed Monteath revenue member of his council with special responsibility for famine. Monteath was thus in charge again throughout the famine years of 1899&#150;1902, during which time his health began to falter from overwork. As both Northcote and Lord Curzon noted with some dismay, Monteath lacked the instincts of a politician and often blundered, not least when he sent a curtly worded letter to <span class="italic">The Times of India</span> in July 1900 stating that he would take no notice of anonymous complaints about the famine administration. In May 1901 he introduced a land bill into the Bombay legislative council which, in the aftermath of famine indebtedness, was designed to limit the transfer of land from cultivating castes to moneylending castes by prohibiting the alienation of land by tenants whose revenue payments were in arrears. Possibly because he had little faith in the bill himself, Monteath promoted it with such ineptitude that its attempt to free peasants from the grip of moneylenders was perceived instead as an attack by the state on the occupancy rights of indebted tenants. Opposition came from many quarters, but Monteath persisted with the bill, provoking a walk-out on 23 August 1901 by five Indian members of the council when he accused them of opposing it on the grounds of economic self-interest.<br>
<br>Monteath retired in August 1905. He had served as acting governor of Bombay from 6 September to 13 December 1903 and in January of that year had been promoted to KCSI, an honour which Northcote had requested for him on account of his loyalty in implementing a revenue policy he personally disliked and the intense public criticism to which his work had been subject. A Conservative, he was delighted to receive a farewell letter from Curzon praising his devotion to duty.<br>
<br>After retirement Monteath lived at Buckerell Lodge, Honiton, Devon, where he died on 19 April 1929; he was buried on 23 April. His wife, Amelia, had died in 1927. Of their five sons, two followed their father into the Bombay civil service, a third joined the Indian forest service, and a fourth entered the India Office and became private secretary to the secretary of state.<br>
