<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Bowyer, Sir  George</span>, seventh baronet  (1811&#150;1883), <span class="occ">jurist and politician</span>, was born on 8 October 1811 at Radley Park, near Abingdon, Berkshire, the eldest son of Sir George Bowyer, sixth baronet (1783&#150;1860), of Denham Court, Buckinghamshire, and his wife, Anne Hammond, daughter of Captain Sir Andrew Snape Douglas RN. He received much of his early education in Italy, before spending a short time as a cadet at the Royal Military Academy at Woolwich. However, Bowyer soon abandoned any idea of a military career and turned instead to the law. He spent a year in Genoa in 1835, studying Roman law, and later compiled a manuscript, <span class="italic">Libro della nobilit&agrave; di Genova</span>, with his friend Stacey Grimaldi. On his return to England, he became a member of the Middle Temple on 1 June 1836. He was called to the bar on 7 June 1839, and was awarded an honorary MA at Oxford in the same month. In 1844 he received the degree of DCL. He was also admitted a member of Lincoln's Inn in January 1845.<br>
<br>Although Bowyer practised for some time as a draftsman and conveyancer at the equity bar, this did not suit him for he was more interested in the academic side of law. As a legal writer, he first attracted attention with a book published in 1841, <span class="italic">The English Constitution: a Popular Commentary on the Constitutional Laws of England</span>. This work sought to place within the reach of educated people the constitutional knowledge to which, in the aftermath of the <span class="roman">Reform Act</span>, Bowyer felt it was essential that all voters had access. It sold well, and helped to establish his reputation as a constitutional lawyer. In 1850 he was appointed reader in law at the Middle Temple, and in the following year he published his <span class="italic">Readings Delivered before the Honourable Society of the Middle Temple</span>. In these lectures, in which he drew widely on Roman and canon law, he sought to show the connection of the various branches of jurisprudence with each other, and to show their place in a general system of moral science. This ambition was echoed in 1854 in his <span class="italic">Commentaries on Universal Public Law</span>, where he sought to show the universal nature of legal obligation, in the manner of Domat and the civil lawyers. His interest in comparative jurisprudence and Roman law continued, and in 1874 he published his <span class="italic">Introduction to the study and use of the civil law, and to commentaries on the modern civil law</span>.<br>
<br>In his youth, Bowyer was a follower of the Oxford Movement, and in 1839 he wrote an article on ecclesiastical discipline in Newman's <span class="italic">British Critic</span>. He converted to Roman Catholicism in August 1850 and immediately became an active spokesman for the Catholic church on legal and constitutional questions. He was soon called on to act as a constitutional adviser to Cardinal Wiseman, at the time of public agitation against the pope's decision to create the archbishopric of Westminster. In his pamphlet, <span class="italic">The Cardinal Archbishop of Westminster and the New Hierarchy</span> (1850), Bowyer argued for the legal right of the pope to exercise his spiritual authority by creating a permanent episcopacy in England, saying that the Catholic church was recognized in English law. He remained a regular contributor to the press on religious questions, writing letters frequently to <span class="italic">The Times</span>, and being a regular contributor to the <span class="italic">Dublin Review</span>. He was also a consistent defender of Catholic causes in parliament, his attitudes to politics often reflecting his religious rather than strictly party loyalties. For these services he was made a knight commander of the order of Pius IX, as well as a chamberlain to that pontiff; he was also made knight grand cross of the order of St Gregory the Great, and was awarded the grand collar of the Constantinian order of St George of Naples.<br>
<br>Bowyer was a fervent whig and an enthusiastic supporter of Lord Henry Brougham, as well as being a friend of Henry Fox, fourth Baron Holland. His passion for politics lasted throughout his life. In the late 1830s, he aspired to become Thomas Duffield's successor as MP for Abingdon, the seat which his father had held between 1811 and 1818, and in August 1849 he stood (unsuccessfully) as a Liberal for the parliamentary seat of Reading, in the by-election caused by the elevation to the bench of T. N. Talfourd. He was finally elected to parliament in July 1852, as MP for Dundalk, co. Louth. As an MP, Bowyer was always independent-minded, and he found himself unsuited to the strictures of party discipline. He flirted with Disraeli's Conservatives in the 1860s, and lost his seat in the election of 1868 to a Gladstonian Liberal. Bowyer returned to parliament in 1874 as MP for co. Wexford, having stood in the election as a home-ruler primarily because he realized that this was the only way in which he could continue his political career. He remained thereafter an indisciplined member of an indisciplined group, continuing to sit on the government benches, and remaining a member of the Reform Club, until 23 June 1876, when he was expelled by a two-thirds majority at a general meeting, for frequently voting against the Liberal Party. In March 1880 Bowyer retired from politics.<br>
<br>In 1862 Bowyer was one of the sponsors of a bill in parliament to reform the government of the inns of court and the discipline of the bar, which failed as a result of opposition by the inns. He also played a leading part in the parliamentary agitation of 1873&#150;4, which succeeded in persuading Disraeli's government to retain the appellate jurisdiction of the House of Lords. In addition, he was a member of the royal commission appointed to examine the expediency of digesting the law in 1866, although he did not sign its report.<br>
<br>Bowyer succeeded his father as seventh baronet on 1 July 1860, though the family's landed estate had been leased in 1847 to a nonconformist school (the forerunner of Radley College). He was a magistrate and a deputy lieutenant for Berkshire. He was found dead in his bed at 13 King's Bench Walk on 7 June 1883, having suffered a heart attack. His funeral service was held in his church of St John of Jerusalem, Great Ormond Street, London, and he was buried in the family vault at Abingdon. Bowyer was unmarried, and was succeeded in the baronetcy by his brother William (1812&#150;1893), another barrister of the Middle Temple.<br>
