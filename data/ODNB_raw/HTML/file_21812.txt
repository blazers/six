<span class="headword">Pellow <span class="st"> [Pellew]</span>,  Thomas</span>  (<em>b. </em>1703/4), <span class="occ">writer of an account of Morocco</span>, was born to parents of modest means but who were related to a family with numerous branches in Devon and Cornwall and which included Edward Pellew, first Viscount Exmouth of Canonteign. Pellow attended Penryn School for some years and, though still only eleven years old, on the death of his father in 1715 he went to sea with his uncle John Pellew. He embarked at Falmouth in the spring of 1715 in the merchant ship <i>Francis</i>, but before the ship reached Genoa he had come to regret his decision to go to sea. Unfortunately on its return journey the <i>Francis</i> was captured off Cape Finisterre by a couple of Sal&eacute; rovers, pirates operating from Sal&eacute; on the Moroccan coast. The rovers were in turn surprised off the bar of Sal&eacute; by an English cruiser commanded by Captain Delgarnoe, but the Moroccans saved themselves by running ashore. After getting to land as best they could the prisoners, consisting of twenty-five Englishmen and seventeen Frenchmen, were taken to a prison, and thence, after a brief delay, to Mesquinez or Meknes where the palace of the sultan, Mawlay Isma&#145;il (1646&#150;1727) (<i>r</i>. 1672&#150;1727), was situated.<br>
<br>Being only a boy at the time Pellow was at first sent to clean arms in the armoury and was then given as a slave to the emperor's son, Mawlay Spha. His influence&#151;reinforced by torture, according to Pellow's own account&#151;caused Pellow to become a Muslim. Again according to Pellow's own testimony, however, he remained in his heart a Christian. Torture was commonly applied to Christian captives to induce them to renounce their faith, but it seems to have been especially severe in Pellow's case and he recounts how he was starved, beaten, and tortured by fire before he agreed to become a Muslim. Though the story rings true it would have been impossible for Pellow to say anything else in an account written for a British audience. As a Muslim, Pellow was excluded from the treaty negotiated by Commodore Charles Stewart in 1720, under which 296 Britons, mostly sailors, were released from slavery and allowed home. Pellow was thus left in Morocco a renegade, an object of suspicion to Muslim and Christian alike.<br>
<br>When he reached adulthood Pellow was given military training and about 1725 was put in command of a Moorish castle at Tannorah; he was subsequently employed by the sultan to put down an insurrection at Guzlan. Mawlay Isma&#145;il died in 1727 and was succeeded by Mawlay Ahmad IV, during whose brief reign Pellow made an unsuccessful attempt to escape to Gibraltar, but was recaptured and narrowly escaped execution. He subsequently took part in the siege of Fez. In 1728 his wife, whom he had married under Mawlay Isma&#145;il's order, and their daughter died. In his account he professed himself little upset by their deaths, but this was perhaps influenced by his need to support his claims that he had remained a true Christian at heart. With the death of Ahmad IV and the succession of Mawlay Abdullah V (1728&#150;1757) his master changed, but his duties and way of life continued unaltered. During the next few years he was employed as a captain of horse helping to put down the frequent insurrections which characterized this unstable period of Moroccan history. Pellow's own fortunes waxed and waned as did those of his master. He was also, according to his own account, entrusted with a large caravan to Timbuktu looking for slaves and other merchandise. Pellow may be identified with Pilleau in Braithwaite's <span class="italic">History of the Revolutions in the Empire of Morocco</span> (1729), which corroborates some of Pellow's claims in his own work. Pellow was occasionally employed as an interpreter at the embassy, but his staple employment&#151;like that of a large number of renegades&#151;was as a soldier, in which capacity he had to gain a precarious livelihood by plunder. Though he shared the prosperity of many renegades it was probably the strain of this hazardous way of life that decided him to plot his escape. It was not, however, until the beginning of 1738 that he was able to put his plan into action. The difficulty was to find a ship's captain bound for England who would take on board a Moroccan subject and conceal him until safe out of the sultan's dominions. To achieve this, after leaving Meknes he wandered the country for several months in disguise. After travelling with a party of conjurors, and as an itinerant quack, and after being several times attacked by brigands who robbed him of all his goods he arrived at Santa Cruz. There he lived for a long time in a cave in company with other outcasts, but failing to find a ship which would carry him he set out for El Waladia where he kept himself alive by stealing carrots. Finally he reached Sal&eacute; where he managed without the knowledge of the Moroccan authorities to get a passage to Gibraltar in a small trading vessel, commanded by a Captain Toobin of Dublin. From Gibraltar, where a subscription was raised on his behalf, he sailed for London in the <i>Euphrates</i> (Captain Peacock) and, after a few days in London where the account of his long captivity drew some attention, he returned to Penryn on 15 October 1738.<br>
<br>The story of Pellow's experiences was published in 1739 under the title <span class="italic">The History of the Long Captivity and Adventures of Thomas Pellow in South Barbary; Giving an Account of his being Taken by Two Sallee Rovers and Carry'd a Slave to Mequinez at Eleven Years of Age</span>. A second edition appeared in 1740 and a third as <span class="italic">Adventures of Thomas Pellow of Penryn, Mariner</span> was edited by Dr Robert Brown for the <span class="roman">Adventure Series</span> (1890). Pellow's narrative, corroborated as it is by Braithwaite's book and the accounts of other captives in Morocco, appears to be based on personal experience accurately recorded but it was evidently edited rather liberally. As well as Pellow's own account it contains long extracts from John Windus's <span class="italic">Journey to Mequinez</span> (1725) and there is much stereotypical comment on the plight of Christians enslaved in Morocco. The most original and also the most graphic part is the account of Pellow's escape, which gives a picture of the turbulent state of the country under Mawlay Abdullah.<br>
<br>Nothing more is known of Pellow.<br>
