<span class="headword">Bentley,  Richard</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1645, <em>d.</em> 1697), <span class="occ">bookseller</span>, was baptized on 18 December 1645 at Barton on the Heath, Warwickshire, the son of Thomas Bentley. Nothing further is known of his childhood or his parents' circumstances, but when Bentley was apprenticed for the term of eight years to James Magnes in March 1659, his father was described as &#145;gent.&#146;. Magnes, of Russell Street, Covent Garden, was a member of the Merchant Taylors of London, but worked in the book trade. After his apprenticeship Bentley seems to have stayed on in the business as a journeyman and after the death of Magnes in 1678 went into partnership with his master's widow. When she died in July 1682, her part of the stock was left to her daughter Susanna, whose name appeared with Bentley's in the imprint of publications until 1689. In 1684 Bentley was made free of the Stationers' Company, and only then was he able to register titles in the Stationers' register under his own name. Throughout his career, Bentley worked from the address that Magnes had used, the Post House (or Office) in Russell Street. In August 1689 Bentley acquired a lease on a house in King Street, Covent Garden, and married Katherine Davis (<i>d</i>. 1699) on 13 February of the following year. The couple had at least three children, Dawbenny, Richard, and Thomas, all three baptized in the local church of St Paul's, Covent Garden.<br>
<br>Bentley published mainly, but not exclusively, novels and plays, which led John Dunton, a fellow stationer, to call him &#145;novel Bentley&#146;  (Mandelbrote, 56). He had varying percentages of shares in the copyright of many literary works such as Milton's <span class="italic">Paradise Lost</span> and <span class="italic">Paradise Regained</span> and some of Shakespeare's plays. Bentley often made up collections of novels or plays, which were sometimes no more than a reissue with a new title-page of unsold publications from the time when he and Magnes worked together. He frequently published works in association with other members of the book trade, owning only a part share in the rights. In one instance Bentley fell foul of the authorities over Gabriel de Br&eacute;mond's <span class="italic">Hattige</span>, a satire on the conduct of Charles II, but the work was published nevertheless with a false imprint in 1680 and incorporated into one of Bentley's collections, <span class="italic">Modern Novels</span>, in 1692.<br>
<br>Bentley died at King Street very shortly after his will was drawn up on 15 June 1697 and was buried in St Paul's Church, Covent Garden, on the 23rd of the same month. Probate was granted on 16 July 1697 to Katherine, whom Bentley had named executor and guardian of Dawbenny and Thomas; Richard junior presumably died before his father. Katherine sold the copyrights that Bentley had held on his publications and part of the stock to Richard Wellington, but kept the shop going until she herself died; she was buried on 16 September 1699. The one surviving child of the marriage, Dawbenny, died in May the following year. Administration of Katherine's estate was granted to Anna Davis, her sister. The shop passed into the hands of Edmund Rumball, a former apprentice of Bentley, who went into partnership with Wellington, bringing Bentley's assets back together again.<br>
