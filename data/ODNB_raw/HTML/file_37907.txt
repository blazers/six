<span class="headword">Rocque,  John</span>  (1704?&#150;1762), <span class="occ">land surveyor and cartographer</span>, was born in France, one of four children of a Huguenot family which settled in Geneva after fleeing France. He probably arrived in England in 1709, though his life before his publishing career began in 1734 is obscure. He always remained in close touch with the French protestant community in London and many of his works have bilingual titles.<br>
<br>Between 1734 and 1740 Rocque established his name as a &#145;dessinateur des jardins&#146;, publishing elaborate plans of gardens, generally including views of the aristocratic houses to which they belonged and drawings of other garden features. These estates were mostly around London and included the royal parks and gardens at Richmond (1734), Kensington (1736), and Windsor (1738). His brother Bartholomew was a horticulturist and landscape gardener in Walham Green, Fulham. From the late 1730s he began to develop a more ambitious career in cartography. His works reflect his travels; as he gained commissions as an estate surveyor he would use the opportunity to survey for county maps and town plans. In addition to original surveys his business in London maintained a steady production of general maps and atlases, notably plans of foreign towns, including Paris and Rome. It is this breadth of output which established his reputation as one of the most prolific and innovative map makers of the eighteenth century.<br>
<br>Rocque's survey of London was planned with George Vertue, surveyed from 1738, engraved by John Pine, and published in twenty-four sheets in 1746. It was the outstanding plan of the capital in the eighteenth century. He also published large-scale plans of other towns based on original surveys (Bristol 1743, Exeter 1744, Shrewsbury 1746, Dublin 1756, Kilkenny 1758, and Cork 1760). His six county surveys (Shropshire 1752, Middlesex 1754, Armagh 1760, Dublin 1760, Berkshire 1761, and Surrey 1768; projected surveys of Kent, Oxfordshire, and Buckinghamshire came to nothing) were innovative in their portrayal of land use and vegetation. His distinctive contribution was to apply the conventions of estate and garden plans to county maps. His estate surveys included the Barnard lands in Shropshire (1746&#150;8) and the earl of Kildare's estates (1755&#150;60).<br>
<br>Rocque lived in Great Windmill Street on the edge of the French quarter in Soho until 1743, in Piccadilly opposite Green Park until 1749, and in Whitehall until a fire on 7 November 1750 destroyed his possessions. After purchasing new stock in Paris he re-established his business in 1751 in the Strand, at the centre of the London map trade. There he remained at three successive addresses until his death.<br>
<br>From 1751 Rocque styled himself chorographer or topographer to the prince of Wales and from 1760 to the king, but his modest means came chiefly from printselling and, in common with many of his trade, his cartographic projects were often financially precarious and consequently protracted. &#145;The French school of Rocque&#146; (as it was called in the nineteenth century) earned an outstanding reputation in Irish cartography, but his chief memorials are his county maps and, above all, his plans of London and Dublin. The latter so impressed George II that he had it hung on the walls of his apartment, and it was reprinted as late as 1821.<br>
<br>Rocque died on 27 January 1762. His widow, Mary Ann, carried on the business with the assistance of her late husband's associates, including Pierre Andr&eacute;, who with John Chapman began a large-scale map of Essex &#145;for Mrs. Rocque&#146;.<br>
