<span class="headword">Taylor,  John Edward</span>  (1791&#150;1844), <span class="occ">newspaper editor</span>, was born at Ilminster, Somerset, on 11 September 1791. His father was the Revd John Taylor (1753&#150;1817), who came of a Lancashire farming family and was educated at Stand grammar school, near Manchester; his mother was born <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/45861/', "Mary Scott (1751/2&#150;1793)")</script>, daughter of a linen manufacturer of Milborne Port, Dorset. He had one elder sister. Taylor senior was one of two ministers sharing dissenting chapels at Ilminster and South Petherton who were decisively influenced by the French Revolution but in different directions: Taylor to become a Quaker and his colleague, the Revd John Noon, to enter extreme radical (Jacobin) politics. Mrs Taylor, a friend and correspondent of the poet Anna Seward, wrote feminist essays, religious verse, and an epic entitled <span class="italic">The Messiah</span>. The parents' marriage (May 1788) took place after an engagement of eleven years, protracted by Miss Scott's attentions to her aged mother. It was described  (McLachlan, 30) as unhappy, deeply so for the mother, who was unable to reconcile her adherence to the Unitarian faith with the evident harshness of her husband's Quakerism. She died on 4 June 1793, when John Edward was not yet two.<br>
<br>After a short appointment in Bristol, Taylor senior moved to Manchester where, under Quaker patronage, he set up a classical academy in the rural suburb of Hulme. John Edward received all his formal education, apart from some instruction in mathematics by the scientist John Dalton, at his father's school, which he left at the age of fourteen. Against his father's wishes he decided as a young man to follow his mother's religious persuasion, and became an active member, from 1840 a trustee, of the Cross Street Chapel, the home of Unitarianism in Manchester.<br>
<br>Taylor was originally intended for medicine, but his father apprenticed him instead to a cotton manufacturer, Benjamin Oakden, with whom, before he was twenty-one, he became a partner. On parting from Oakden he became a partner in the mercantile business of John Shuttleworth. He plunged into public life in Manchester as a founder of the Junior Literary and Philosophical Society and secretary, about 1810, of the Lancasterian school in the town.<br>
<br>During Taylor's boyhood popular opinion in Manchester was almost as much opposed to the early reformers, most of them middle class, as were the magistracy and the moneyed inhabitants of the town. (&#145;The people&#146;, Haslam Mills wrote, &#145;voted steadily for Barabbas&#146;.) With the economic crisis towards and at the end of the war with France, sentiment shifted. Strikes became frequent. Machine smashing disturbed the Lancashire cotton towns. It was then that Taylor, alongside a successful business career, involved himself in liberal politics. He went to London occasionally and was much impressed by, among others, Leigh Hunt, whom he visited in gaol. In 1812&#150;13 he began to write regularly for the town's newspapers, principally William Cowdroy's <span class="italic">Manchester Gazette</span>, which among the several, mostly short-lived, papers of the time was the only representative of liberal opinion. Taylor's contributions were given credit for much of the paper's success in circulation. In a time of social turbulence he found himself constantly balancing his keen desire for political reform against inflammatory outbursts in the streets. Judicious comment, where friends and colleagues would have preferred more vigorous opposition to the perceived abuses of the time, was to be characteristic of his later career.<br>
<br>Also in 1812 a meeting called to support Lord Sidmouth's appointment as home secretary led to a riotous counter-demonstration in which the Royal Exchange was burned down. Rumours attributed to Taylor a handbill headed &#145;Now or never&#146; which was posted in the town and was held to have provoked the arson. Six years later, in 1818, a conservative manufacturer, John Greenwood, at a meeting of commissioners of police called to appoint assessors, caused Taylor's name to be rejected on the specific ground that he was indeed the author of the manifesto. Taylor demanded withdrawal of the charge and, failing to secure it, published a letter calling Greenwood &#145;a liar, a slanderer, and a scoundrel&#146;. A grand jury at Salford quarter sessions found an indictment against him for criminal libel. At his trial at Lancaster assizes on 29 March 1819, in which he conducted his own defence, Taylor made legal history in being allowed by the judge, Baron Wood (who was otherwise hostile), to plead the truth of his statement, a defence not previously admitted in a libel case. Counsel for the prosecution, James Scarlett (later Lord Abinger), surprisingly acquiesced in that decision. In his address to the jury Taylor asserted that he, not Greenwood, was the injured party. After conferring well into the night, under the persuasive foremanship of John Rylands, the jury went to the judge's lodgings and delivered to him, in bed, its verdict of not guilty.<br>
<br>This episode was quickly followed by a graver one. On 16 August 1819 a huge but apparently peaceful crowd gathered in St Peter's Fields, Manchester, to hear the popular orator Henry Hunt. The magistrates ordered Hunt to be arrested by the Manchester yeomanry, who were largely recruited from young members of the tory families in the town, supported by six troops of the 15th hussars. The mounted yeomanry quickly found themselves immersed in the crowd, and turned their swords on those around them. In the bloodshed which became known as the Peterloo massacre eleven people were killed and some hundreds wounded. <span class="italic">The Times</span>'s correspondent, John Tyas, having been arrested along with Hunt, Taylor sent a report of the event to a London newspaper so that the magistrates' own report should not by default become the received version. Archibald Prentice, his colleague on the <span class="italic">Gazette</span> and neighbour in Islington Street, Salford, did likewise, and their reports were corroborated by the <span class="italic">Liverpool Mercury</span> and <span class="italic">Leeds Mercury</span>. Sidmouth wrote to thank the magistrates for their &#145;prompt, decisive, and efficient&#146; measures and placed the government's own account before parliament. Taylor responded with a substantial pamphlet, <span class="italic">Notes and Observations Critical and Explanatory</span> (1820), which, though anonymous, was known to be from his hand, in eloquent rebuttal of the government's account of the disturbance. Here again his cautious use of language was evident. He referred to the &#145;tragedy&#146; rather than the &#145;massacre&#146;, differentiated between good and bad magistrates, and attributed the attack upon the crowd to a minority in the yeomanry's ranks &#145;whose political rancour approaches to absolute insanity&#146;. He devoted much time to the committee set up to relieve the sufferers.<br>
<br>Largely on the strength of these events Taylor became the obvious choice among leaders of the moderate reform movement, most of them Unitarians, as the man to control a new newspaper catering for their interests. Twelve men together subscribed &pound;1000, although Taylor was sole proprietor from the start. These men were mostly engaged in the textile trade, and included George Philips MP as well as the leading Manchester Liberals Thomas and Richard Potter. The <span class="italic">Manchester Guardian</span> was launched on 5 May 1821.<br>
<br>Until then Taylor had enjoyed the friendship and support of Prentice, who was influential among the radicals of the town, but Prentice soon found the <span class="italic">Guardian</span> insufficiently outspoken for his taste. In later years his criticism developed into animosity, more especially after Prentice, supported by some of Taylor's original backers who were disillusioned by the line taken by the <span class="italic">Guardian</span>, had himself taken over one rival newspaper and started another. Taylor joined the Anti-Corn Law League on its foundation in 1838, but was prepared to accept a reduction in the levy on imported grain if abolition was not forthcoming. His detractors alleged that his opposition to the grain duty owed more to his wish to keep wages down than to his consideration for the poor, but the ethical underpinning of his career suggests that was a calumny.<br>
<br>Taylor's <span class="italic">Manchester Guardian</span>, which he conducted in collaboration with Jeremiah Garnett, established a personality which endured for many years. It combined reformist editorial policies with a much more thorough news service than the town had previously been given. It thus became the required reading of manufacturers and merchants who valued its reporting and overlooked its politics; its price at 7<i>d</i>., including 4<i>d</i>. stamp duty, in any case restricted a wider sale.<br>
<br>Taylor's credit with the business community was augmented in 1823 by another libel action which this time he lost. He had denounced a local lawyer, John Dicas (though not by name), for putting out worthless currency notes. Dicas sued, was technically successful, but was awarded only &pound;10 in damages against the &pound;5000 he demanded. The action cost Taylor &pound;483, of which businessmen contributed &pound;307. The balance was in effect Taylor's purchase price for much favourable publicity. He was able to repay the initial subscribers and assume the sole ownership.<br>
<br>Taylor took on the business and civic responsibilities expected of one in his position. He frequently attended deputations to London to promote parliamentary legislation in the interests of his town and for several years he was deputy chairman of the improvement committee of the commissioners of police. He was a small man of louring mien and a priggish temperament. &#145;Moral indignation came easily to him and he could be infuriatingly patronising&#146;  (Ayerst, 87). On 4 May 1824, after a five-year engagement, he married his cousin, Sophia Russell Scott, daughter of Russell Scott, Unitarian minister, and C. P. Scott's aunt. The fourth of their children, also named <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36436/', "John Edward Taylor")</script>, succeeded to the headship of the newspaper. Sophia died in 1832; on 1 June 1836 Taylor married Harriet Acland (1802&#150;1844), youngest daughter of Edward Boyce of Tiverton, who had joined his household the previous year as governess. Of the three daughters of this marriage, Harriet Ann Taylor married the economist <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/14809/', "William Stanley Jevons")</script>. Taylor died of a chronic inflammation of the throat at his home, Beech Hill, Cheetham, on 6 January 1844, and was buried on 13 January.<br>
