<span class="headword">Haryett <span class="st"> [<em>married name </em>Trelawny]</span>,  Elizabeth Ann</span> <span class="st"> [<em>known as </em>Lizzie Howard]</span>, countess of Beauregard in the French nobility  (<em>bap. </em>1823?, <em>d.</em> 1865), <span class="occ">courtesan</span>, was, like most of her kind, of obscure origins, but she has been tentatively identified with the Elizabeth Ann Haryett who was baptized at the church of St Nicholas, Brighton, on 13 August 1823, the daughter of Joseph Gawan Haryett and Elizabeth Alderton. After an early introduction to the life of a courtesan, she took the name Lizzie Howard and rapidly advanced in her profession; by 1840 she was among the most sought-after whores in London. She rapidly made a large fortune (one client was said to have paid &pound;1000 for one night's entertainment).<br>
<br>Haryett was introduced to Prince Louis Napoleon, later Napoleon III, by the Count D'Orsay at Gore House in 1839, and apparently fell in love. Whether she part-financed his Boulogne expedition of 1840 as was often claimed is not now known, but over the next eleven years she certainly advanced him large sums of money. The son she bore in 1842, Martin Constantin Haryett, was widely regarded as Louis Napoleon's, although it is equally likely that he was not. She rebuffed a potential client, the historian A. W. Kinglake, at about this time: he was unremittingly hostile to the French emperor. In 1846, when Louis Napoleon escaped from his captivity and returned to London, he set her up as his mistress in a house in Berkeley Street, where they remained until, following the revolution of 1848, he returned to France to contest the presidential elections. Miss Howard, who followed him across the channel, contributed largely to the presidential coffers (the sums have been estimated at anything between &pound;13,000 and &pound;320,000) and lived openly as his mistress. She evidently hoped to emulate the great mistresses of previous French kings, but in 1852, having declared himself emperor, Napoleon III decided to marry. Miss Howard was now surplus to requirements and, after some difficult scenes, was paid off. Accounts of the total amounts she received from the emperor vary as wildly as those of her gifts to him, but it is certain that she was created countess of Beauregard, and given the Ch&acirc;teau Beauregard and its 450 acre estate near Versailles, together with an annual pension estimated at &pound;20,000. Her son was created count of Bechevet, which some have taken as an acknowledgement of his imperial parentage.<br>
<br>On 16 May 1854 the countess married Clarence Trelawny (<i>b</i>. 1826), a scion of the Salusbury&#150;Trelawny family, who was at that time an officer in the Austrian army. It was an unhappy marriage and ended in divorce in February 1865. (No mention of it is made in the genealogies of <span class="italic">Burke's Peerage</span>.) Elizabeth long bore a grudge against the emperor, and especially against his wife, the Empress Eug&eacute;nie, and when in Paris flaunted herself before them, taking boxes at the opera opposite theirs and driving her carriage behind the empress's. In the early 1860s Trelawny took a shooting lodge in Scotland for two years, but they did not visit the neighbours; great was the consternation when it was discovered that the religious and moral society of Ross-shire had been harbouring so notorious a woman. After the divorce the countess returned to her ch&acirc;teau outside Paris, and to her amusement of pestering the imperial couple. She died unexpectedly on 19 August 1865 at the Ch&acirc;teau Beauregard. Rumours of foul play were probably unsubstantiated. Her entry in the death registers of La Celle St Cloud described her as &#145;Elizabeth Ann Haryett, called Miss Howard, Countess de Beauregard, born in England in 1823&#146;.<br>
