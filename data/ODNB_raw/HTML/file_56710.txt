<span class="headword">Ramabai, Pandita  Mary Saraswati</span> <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Ramabai Dongre]</span>  (1858&#150;1922), <span class="occ">social reformer and writer</span>, was born on 23 April 1858 in Gangamul, near Mangalore, India, the youngest of the six children (of whom three survived infancy) of Anant Shastri Dongre, Sanskrit scholar, and his second wife, Lakshmibai, daughter of Madhavrao Abhyankar. Her father, who was a Marathi Brahman, had an unusual belief in the education of women. He taught his wife Sanskrit, in which Ramabai was instructed in the sacred books by both her parents. The family lived on a pilgrim route in a remote part of the Western Ghats, where her father spent so much in entertaining pilgrims and students that he had to sell off his rice fields and coconut plantations. He and his family then became travelling pilgrims, earning their living by reciting the Sanskrit <span class="italic">Puranas</span> in the villages. In the famine of 1876&#150;7 all the family died except for Ramabai and her brother Shrinivas, who eventually arrived in Calcutta in 1878, where Ramabai studied the Hindu scriptures further. She was so disgusted with their treatment of women and of low castes that she became associated with the reforming Brahmo Samaj. Her lectures on the rise and fall of the Aryan race and on the position of women, as well as her knowledge of the sacred books, caused Calcutta University to confer on her the title Saraswati, after the goddess of learning; a gathering of scholars also awarded her the title of Pandita (learned woman). Her brother died in 1880. On 13 June in the same year she married, in a civil ceremony, a Bengali schoolteacher, Bipin Behari Das Medhavi, who was a member of the Brahmo Samaj. He died of cholera in 1881, leaving her with a daughter, Monorama, with whom she returned to Maharashtra, the home of her ancestors, where she earned a living by lecturing on social questions.<br>
<br>In 1883, hoping to study medicine, Ramabai went to England, where she and her daughter stayed with the community of St Mary the Virgin in Wantage while she improved her English. Impressed by the sisters' work, particularly among prostitutes, she was baptized with the name Mary and confirmed in the Church of England in 1883. When her defective hearing made a medical career impossible the sisters arranged for her to study at Cheltenham Ladies' College and to teach Sanskrit in return. Ramabai now came to question the Anglo-Catholic position of the community and was irritated by what she regarded as its patronizing attitude; it was a relief to all when in 1887 she accepted an invitation to visit the Women's Medical College in Philadelphia. There she decided to devote her life to the protection and the education for employment of Hindu widows, particularly those who were children. She prepared herself by taking a teaching course and by studying the school systems of America. At the same time she wrote <span class="italic">The Hindu High Caste Woman</span> (1887), the first book by an Indian woman to appear in English. Its vivid description of the cruelties suffered by Hindu widows and her lectures throughout America led to the formation of a Ramabai Association, which raised sufficient funds to enable her to return to India in 1889 and open a school for high-caste Hindu widows and orphans, first in Bombay, then in Poona, and finally in her Mukti Sadan (House of Salvation) near Poona. Rapidly becoming a public figure, in 1889 Ramabai was the first woman to address the Indian National Congress, recommending that Hindi should be used as the common language of India. At the Indian National Social Conference in the same year she urged that it should be made a legal offence to shave the heads of widows.<br>
<br>In 1896&#150;7 and 1899 severe famines occurred in central India. With the memory of her parents' fate, Ramabai rescued hundreds of women and girls from starvation and prostitution and settled them at Mukti, where they were educated and set to work in fruit farming and small industries. A church was built with space for 5000 worshippers; services were usually conducted by American Methodist ministers. In 1905 a phenomenon occurred which has been variously treated with admiration, puzzlement, or reserve by Ramabai's biographers. As she was reading from the eighth chapter of St John, the whole congregation began to weep and speak in tongues, and waves of prayer swept through the church. Evangelical activity outside the settlement was now intensified. Though Ramabai dampened the manifestation of the revival when it verged on hysteria, it brought her a personal message to translate the <span class="roman">Bible</span> into a language which, unlike the current Marathi versions, could be understood by the people. For the remaining fifteen years of her life this translation from the original Hebrew and Greek became her main occupation, in addition to running her institution. She gave up travelling and public speaking.<br>
<br>Some 2000 people lived at Mukti, which was largely self-supporting, and where Ramabai had ten American and European helpers. In addition to the girls' school with its industrial and agricultural sides there was a rescue department for former prostitutes, homes for the elderly and sick, and a boys' orphanage which eventually provided Christian husbands for many of the girls. Despite occasional tussles with the British authorities, notably over insensitive plague control measures, Ramabai was awarded the kaisar-i-Hind medal in 1919. In 1921 she suffered a severe blow on the death of her only child, Monorama, who had been trained to succeed her. Shortly after completing her translation of the <span class="roman">Bible</span> she died in her sleep on 5 April 1922 at Mukti, where she was buried the following day. Her work was successfully continued by her foreign and Indian colleagues.<br>
<br>Ramabai was described by Sarojini Naidu as the first Christian to be enrolled in the calendar of Indian saints. In her twenties Max M&uuml;ller found her &#145;truly heroic in appearance, small, delicate and timid, but in reality bold as a tigress&#146;  (M&uuml;ller, 42). The timidity disappeared; later a visitor to Mukti described her as &#145;very charming and humble but imperious&#146;  (Dongre and Patterson, 123). She lived very simply, owning nothing but her books and clothes and wearing the white sari and cropped hair of a Hindu widow.<br>
<br>Ramabai's achievements were of many kinds. As an educationist she was a pioneer of methods which combined academic and practical work. Her girls operated and maintained the printing press, and as masons and carpenters did much of the construction of the Mukti buildings, organizing themselves and electing their own leaders. She also introduced kindergarten methods and braille into India. In modern India she was the first woman to become prominent in public life. She was a brilliant lecturer, earnest but witty. As a social reformer she aroused a strong sentiment against the cruel traditional treatment of widows. As a religious leader and evangelist she was closer to nonconformists than to Anglicans in later life, though she never formally renounced her membership of the Church of England. She was prophetic in calling for closer co-operation between Christian churches and for the acceptance by Christians of what was good in Hindu tradition and custom. She attributed all successes to God, in whose providence she was completely confident throughout the frequent financial crises at Mukti.<br>
<br>In addition to her <span class="italic">Hindu High Caste Woman</span> and her <span class="roman">Bible</span> translation, Ramabai was a prolific writer of books and articles on social and religious subjects in English and Marathi. Her many biographers draw largely on her own <span class="italic">Testimony</span> (1917), her recollections included in S. M. Adhav's <span class="italic">Pandita Ramabai</span> (1969), and her <span class="italic">Letters and Correspondence</span> (1977). The two latter contain bibliographies of her writings.<br>
