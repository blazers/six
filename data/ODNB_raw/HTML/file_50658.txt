<span class="headword">Nicholson,  Wilfred</span>  (1821&#150;1921), <span class="occ">paint manufacturer</span>, was born in London on 13 September 1821, the third surviving child of Thomas Nicholson and his wife, Elizabeth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Coulson (<i>d</i>. 1859). In 1810 his father had moved from co. Durham to London to find work and after various jobs joined Henry Grace, white lead manufacturer of Bethnal Green, where he later became manager.<br>
<br>Nicholson left school at thirteen and started work at Graces, gaining practical knowledge of paint ingredients and colours; most decorators of the day mixed their own paints and varnishes rather than buying ready-made products. Nicholson's interests were in selling rather than manufacture, and he became the firm's commercial traveller when he was twenty-six. He was popular and within ten years had been elected to the Commercial Travellers' Association Council; there he was a strong supporter of the association's charitable work, especially with its schools.<br>
<br>Nicholson met his future wife, Ann Clements (<i>d</i>. 1892), through his work with the Sunday school and social work at St Matthew's Church, Bethnal Green, and they were married on 23 July 1843. They had ten children; the two surviving boys attended the City of London School and the two youngest girls were taught at the school newly established by Frances Mary Buss at Camden Town. Henry Grace died in 1858 but Nicholson was not offered a partnership in the firm. Instead, three years later he was invited into partnership by John Jenson, whose high class varnish business at that time was much smaller than Grace's. Jenson and Nicholson developed a range of ready-to-use paints to supplement the business in oils, colours, and varnishes. Nicholson concentrated on marketing the firm's products. He travelled widely in the United Kingdom and on the continent, exhibiting in Paris in 1869/70 and Moscow in 1872. Agencies were set up to serve the major export markets in France and Belgium; sales to Australia and New Zealand were supplied through merchant houses.<br>
<br>Jenson retired from the partnership in 1874. Within a few years Nicholson was joined by two of his sons, one of whom stayed only for a short time while the other, John (<i>b</i>. 1860), became a partner in 1893. They had been sent to George Mence Smith, who had a chain of hardware and oil shops, to learn about the paint business, and to Paris to learn some French and about continental business methods, before they joined their father. After John became a partner, Nicholson gradually reduced his involvement in active management although he never formally relinquished his partnership. Instead he spent more time on outside charitable activities. He had become a liveryman in the Painter&#150;Stainers' Company in 1860 and master in 1881&#150;2, and was closely involved in the company's charitable work for almost fifty years.<br>
<br>Nicholson was brought up in a Christian home and throughout his life was a regular worshipper, latterly in the local Congregational church. His connection with the Sunday school movement was lifelong and he first visited the continent in 1864 as a representative of the Sunday School Union. He supported the 1870 <span class="roman">Education Act</span>, even though it prohibited denominational teaching in board schools. As well as his work on the management committee of the Royal Commercial Travellers' Schools, he was interested in the Reedham Orphanage and many other charities. The Nicholson family moved a number of times but their homes were close to the business in north London. In 1894 Nicholson and his old friend Smith went on a cruise through the Norwegian fjords. Nicholson remained active in his charitable work until his mid-nineties and died on 9 January 1921, a few months short of his hundredth birthday.<br>
