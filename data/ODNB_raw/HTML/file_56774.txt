<span class="headword">McLachlan,  Donald Harvey</span>  (1908&#150;1971), <span class="occ">journalist and intelligence officer</span>, was born in London at Flat 6, 23 Cathcart Hill, Islington, on 25 September 1908, the only child of David James McLachlan, a hotel manager, and his wife, Elizabeth Hine. From the City of London School he won a scholarship in French at Magdalen College, Oxford, where he took a first in modern Greats in 1930. He held a Laming fellowship at Queen's College, Oxford, in 1932&#150;3.<br>
<br>Two sisters called Harman, daughters of Nathaniel Bishop Harman, a surgeon, who were at Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford, resolved to marry their two brightest contemporaries. Elizabeth married the future seventh earl of Longford; Katherine (1909/10&#150;1997), known as Kitty, married McLachlan on 12 May 1934. It was a close and happy marriage, to which three sons and a daughter were born.<br>
<br>By the time it began McLachlan was on the staff of <span class="italic">The Times</span> as its correspondent in Warsaw. He was standing in for the Berlin correspondent, who was on holiday, on the night of the Reichstag fire, 27 February 1933. His dispatch on this was so telling that he was brought back to London to write leading articles. He happened to be in charge of the paper the night that news came in, at 8.45 p.m., that Albert I of Belgium had died; he went to press at 9.22 with a news article, a leading article, and a complete obituary, the last ten years of which he had also just written. Yet he found the work less interesting than being a foreign correspondent, and in 1936 he left for two years as an assistant master at Winchester College, where he taught German, Russian, and current affairs&#151;the last two hitherto untaught subjects. As an agnostic he was in a difficulty in compulsory divinity classes: instead of instilling Christianity, he taught ethics out of lives of Socrates and Voltaire. He was a stimulating teacher, encouraging his pupils to think for themselves, and sharing with them his knowledge of European personalities as well as his gift for languages. <span class="italic">The Times</span> lured him back with the offer of the editorship of the <span class="italic">Times Educational Supplement</span>, which he ran in 1938&#150;40.<br>
<br>In spite of his defective eyesight&#151;he wore heavily horn-rimmed spectacles&#151;McLachlan was accepted by the army, with an emergency commission as a second lieutenant, general list, on 8 July 1940. After a brief intelligence course at Swanage he was posted to the intelligence branch of southern command, where he served until late October, while German invasion was thought imminent. He was then attached to the Duke of Cornwall's light infantry for training.<br>
<br>From this McLachlan was rescued by the director of naval intelligence, J. H. Godfrey, who had him posted probationary lieutenant in the special branch of the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve on 31 December 1940. He served no sea time; he worked in the naval intelligence department, at first on U-boat tracking. Later in 1941 he moved to naval intelligence division (NID) 17 Z. NID was now only cover for him: in fact, though in naval uniform, he joined the political warfare executive, running black broadcasts under the aegis of Sefton Delmer of the <span class="italic">Daily Express</span>, who had known him before the war. His rank, from 1942 to 1945, was acting temporary lieutenant-commander.<br>
<br>McLachlan's task was to run Kriegswellensender Atlantik, an ostensibly German short-wave station that aimed at rotting the morale of U-boat crews, partly by scabrous accounts of what their wives and girlfriends were doing while they were at sea. No one has ever been able to establish what impact it had. In March 1944 he again moved, to the psychological warfare branch of Supreme Headquarters, Allied Expeditionary Force, where he worked, still under Delmer, against the morale of the German army; again without precisely assessable results. Authority was satisfied with him, and he was appointed OBE in 1945.<br>
<br>After the war McLachlan returned to journalism and served from 1947 to 1954 as joint foreign editor of <span class="italic">The Economist</span> with Barbara Ward, under Geoffrey Crowther's editorship. He took, as always, a sternly rationalist line about foreign policy, attacking the sentimentality of the left as sharply as he opposed any tendencies towards tyranny of the right. In 1954 he moved to the <span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span> as deputy editor. It was he who wrote the article headed &#145;The smack of firm government&#146; early in 1956 that so much annoyed Sir Anthony Eden. He alternately exhilarated and alarmed his colleagues, because of the many bright ideas he put before them. He was a tall, thin, clean-shaven man, thin-lipped, decisive in manner, and noticeably helpful to anyone he thought promising. He was a visiting fellow of Nuffield College, Oxford, in 1960&#150;68, and sat on the BBC's General Advisory Council from 1961 to 1965.<br>
<br>For its first five years, from 5 February 1961, McLachlan edited the <span class="italic">Sunday Telegraph</span>, intended to &#145;fill the gap&#146;&#151;as he put it on its first page&#151;between the two quality Sunday papers, <span class="italic">The Observer</span> and the <span class="italic">Sunday Times</span>, and the more popular ones. He meant to make it readily readable in a single day, and yet to include plenty of hard news and commentary as well as many cultural features, but never escaped from the quip that the gap it filled was between Saturday's <span class="italic">Telegraph</span> and Monday's <span class="italic">Telegraph</span>.<br>
<br>In 1966 McLachlan resigned, because he wanted to write books instead of articles. First he produced <span class="italic">Room 39</span> (1968), a long and original account of wartime naval intelligence, studded with asterisks (inserted whenever he wanted to refer to most secret sources, still then unavowable, to which he had himself been privy in NID). It remains one of the leading texts on practical intelligence work.<br>
<br>McLachlan then wrote <span class="italic">In the Chair</span>, a life of R. W. Barrington-Ward, the wartime editor of <span class="italic">The Times</span>, a sympathetic biography which appeared after its author's death. He also wrote a novel, <span class="italic">No Case for the Crown</span> (1972), about the secret world, in which a principal character is removed by the counter-espionage service by being forced to drive into a tree. He next began a life (never finished) of Kurt Hahn, the headmaster of Gordonstoun, the Scottish public school on the Moray Firth. He went there early in 1971 to pursue research. On long journeys, he and Kitty normally shared the driving; she happened to have a broken wrist, and he went alone. On 10 January, early on the way back, he drove into a tree and died at once. His ashes were scattered, close to his country home, on the Hanger near Selborne, Hampshire; friends put up trees there to his memory.<br>
