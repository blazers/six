<span class="headword">Young, Sir  Hubert Winthrop</span>  (1885&#150;1950), <span class="occ">army officer and administrator</span>, born at Wrexham on 6 July 1885, was the second of the four distinguished sons of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37081/', "William Mackworth Young (1840&#150;1924)")</script> of the Indian Civil Service, and lieutenant-governor of the Punjab, and his second wife, Frances Mary (<i>d</i>. 8 March 1932), daughter of Sir Robert Eyles Egerton. His father and maternal grandfather were both lieutenant-governors of the Punjab. His brothers included <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/34769/', "Gerard Mackworth-Young (1884&#150;1965)")</script>, civil servant in India and archaeologist, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/51588/', "Sir Mark Aitchison Young (1886&#150;1974)")</script>, colonial governor. Having been educated at Eton College (1898&#150;1902), where he was a scholar, and the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich (1902&#150;4), he was commissioned in 1904 in the Royal Garrison Artillery (lieutenant 1907). He intended to transfer to the Indian army and eventually into the Indian political service, and was advised to study Arabic to facilitate his later learning Persian or Urdu. After being posted to Aden in 1907 he studied Arabic there. He was invalided from Aden, and in England studied Arabic with a Baghdadi coach, before qualifying as an interpreter in Arabic in July 1908. In the same year he transferred to the 116th Marathas, Indian army. Returning from leave in 1913 he travelled via Syria and Iraq and at Carchemish stayed with T. E. Lawrence, there as an archaeologist. This made a deep impression on both men and had an important influence on Young's career.<br>
<br>When appointed adjutant of the 116th Marathas in 1913 Young was given by the colonel scope for his exceptional abilities. He transformed the battalion, increasing efficiency and morale by his energy, organizing ability, and knowledge of the men, his design of a smart <i>pagri</i>, and the composition, with the Indian officers, of marching songs celebrating the great Maratha exploits (one, <span class="italic">Ek sau solah mahrataja</span>, became very popular). When war came in 1914 Young worked at army headquarters for a while, but he returned to his regiment and served on the north-west frontier. In 1915 he was sent to Mesopotamia where he served as assistant political officer (1915&#150;17) and was chiefly responsible for the construction of the Shaybah <i>bund</i>. He was transferred to the local resources department in 1917 as deputy director (1917&#150;18), and was mentioned in dispatches for speeding up grain deliveries.<br>
<br>At Lawrence's request Young was transferred to the Hejaz operations in March 1918 as general staff officer, grade 2 (GSO2). He organized transport and supplies for the composite force which cut the railway behind the Turkish army just before Allenby's final attack. He was mentioned in dispatches, and received the DSO (1919), and order of El Nahdha, third class. After a short period as president of the local resources board in Damascus (1918), he took leave to England. In <span class="italic">Seven Pillars of Wisdom</span> (1926) Lawrence praised Young as energetic, capable, and strong-willed, &#145;a regular of exceptional quality &hellip; rising, as ever, to any occasion&#146;  (Lawrence, 524, 577).<br>
<br>Young served in the new eastern department of the Foreign Office (1919&#150;21), where his Arab experience helped form the policy eventually adopted in Iraq. He was assistant secretary in the Middle East department, Colonial Office, from its formation in 1921 until the end of 1926. He was colonial secretary, Gibraltar (1927&#150;9), counsellor to the high commissioner for Iraq (1929&#150;32), and envoy-extraordinary and minister-plenipotentiary in Baghdad (October and November 1932). After this he was governor respectively of Nyasaland (1932&#150;4), Northern Rhodesia (1934&#150;8), and Trinidad and Tobago (1938&#150;42). In his last post, at the most important of the Lend Lease bases, he attempted to safeguard the interests of the colony and his own authority as governor in the presence of a considerable American air, land, and naval force. In this difficult task he fell foul of an unsatisfactory and unco-operative American commanding officer, whose reports about Young led to complaints by General Marshall to Winston Churchill in Washington in 1942. In the interests of harmonious relations at this critical time, Churchill instructed the colonial secretary in February to replace him. He was given no opportunity to defend himself. His health prevented him from accepting another post, and much of his heavy wartime work in Trinidad was done despite a warning heart attack.<br>
<br>In the colonial service&#151;though like other colonial officials of the period, his policy-making was much constrained by the Colonial Office&#151;he was noted for energy and foresight in helping to develop air communications, and for his sympathy with indigenous interests, which did not, however, cause him to neglect those of the European community. At a time when the settlers were being attacked by London critics, and were pressing for amalgamation of the Rhodesias, in Northern Rhodesia Young considered the settlers beneficial, tried to encourage secondary industries, and favoured closer co-operation among the Rhodesias and Nyasaland, and the creation of a new association, British Central Africa. He negotiated with the other governors and with settler leaders, but the Colonial Office forbade any step likely to lead to amalgamation or federation of the Rhodesias. He increased the role of the settler-elected unofficial members of the legislative council, and defended against London critics his administration's policies on African employment, arguing that these were affected by the underlying financial constraints on African education. He identified himself with provisions for the constant review of labour conditions and with the development of social services and the establishment of trust lands for Africans. In Trinidad, labour, hospitals, and housing occupied his special attention. Young was created CMG in 1923, was knighted in 1932, and appointed KCMG in 1934. After retirement he engaged in relief work, notably as European regional officer for the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (1944&#150;5); for this he was made a commander of the order of Orange Nassau in 1949. In 1945 he unsuccessfully contested Harrow West as a Liberal, and in 1947 Edge Hill, Liverpool. He served on the board of the Royal Free Hospital, London, from 1945 and was chairman from 1946 until his death; he was also chairman of the consultative council of the Southern Electricity area. On 7 February 1924 Young married Margaret Rose Mary, daughter of Colonel Frank Romilly Reynolds RE; they had three sons.<br>
<br>Young had many talents. He wrote well, as his book <span class="italic">The Independent Arab</span> (1933) showed; he talked well, was an excellent linguist, a gifted amateur pianist and organist, and keen chess-player. Intellectual and man of action, he was fertile in ideas and determined in implementing them. He appeared formidable, and was sometimes overbearing; but his moral courage made him at least as stiff with his superiors, if he thought their policy mistaken, as with anyone else. Kind-hearted, he was sympathetic to the underdog and devoted to the public service.<br>
<br>He died at Evora, Portugal, on 20 April 1950 and was survived by his wife.<br>
