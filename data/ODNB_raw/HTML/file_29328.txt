<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Whittingham, Sir  Samuel Ford</span>  (1772&#150;1841), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, elder son and second child of William Whittingham of Bristol, was born at Bristol on 29 January 1772. His Christian names were contracted by himself and his friends into Samford.<h2>
<a name="Earlylife17721806"></a>Early life, 1772&#150;1806</h2>Whittingham was educated at Bristol and was intended for the law. Determined to be a soldier, but unwilling to oppose his father's wishes during his lifetime, he entered temporarily his brother-in-law's merchant firm, and travelled for it in Spain. In 1797 at Bristol he joined the mounted volunteers, an anti-invasion force of the wealthier citizens. His father died on 12 September 1801 (aged sixty), at Earl's Mead, Bristol, and Samford, who was in Spain, became independent. He returned to England and was gazetted ensign on 20 January 1803; he bought a lieutenancy on 25 February, and was brought into the 1st Life Guards on 10 March. Whittingham went to the Royal Military College at High Wycombe, and joined his regiment in London towards the end of 1804. He was introduced by Thomas Murdoch, an influential merchant, to William Pitt, the prime minister, as an officer whose knowledge of Spanish would be useful, and as a result was sent by Pitt at the end of 1804 on a secret mission to the Peninsula; on 14 February 1805, during his absence, he was promoted captain in the 20th foot. On his return he was complimented by Pitt, and on 13 June 1805 he was transferred to the command of a troop in the 13th light dragoons.<h2>
<a name="Argentina1807"></a>Argentina, 1807</h2>On 12 November 1806 Whittingham sailed from Portsmouth as deputy assistant quartermaster-general of the force, under Brigadier-General Robert Craufurd, intended for Lima; but on arrival at the Cape of Good Hope on 15 March 1807 its destination was changed, and on 13 June it reached Montevideo, recently captured by Sir Samuel Auchmuty. General John Whitelocke had arrived to command the combined forces, and as Whittingham's staff appointment ceased on the amalgamation of the forces, Whitelocke made him an extra aide-de-camp to himself. He took part in the disastrous attack on Buenos Aires and in the surrender on 6 July, and sailed for England on 30 July. He gave evidence before the general court martial, by which Whitelocke was tried in London in February and March 1808. Owing to his having served on Whitelocke's personal staff, Whittingham's position was a delicate one; but he acquitted himself with discretion.<h2>
<a name="Spain18081819"></a>Spain, 1808&#150;1819</h2>Whittingham was immediately afterwards appointed deputy assistant quartermaster-general on the staff of the army in Sicily. On arrival at Gibraltar, however, he acted temporarily as assistant military secretary to Lieutenant-General Sir Hew Dalrymple, the governor, and, hearing of a projected campaign of the Spaniards under Don Xavier Casta&ntilde;os against the French, obtained leave to join Casta&ntilde;os as a volunteer, with instructions to report in detail to Dalrymple. This special duty was approved from London on 2 July 1808, and on 18 July Whittingham was appointed a deputy assistant quartermaster-general to the force under Sir Arthur Wellesley, but was ordered to remain with Casta&ntilde;os. He took part under Manuel La Pe&ntilde;a on 18 July 1808 in the victorious battle of Bail&eacute;n, being almost the only British officer present, and for his services he was made a colonel of cavalry in the Spanish army on 20 July.<br>
<br>On his recovery from a severe attack of rheumatic fever, Whittingham was sent to Seville on a mission from the duke of Infantado, and in February 1809 joined the army corps of the duke of Albuquerque in La Mancha, where he took part in several cavalry actions with such distinction that he was promoted brigadier-general in the Spanish army, an appointment dated 2 March 1809. He was present at the battle of Medellin on 28 March, when the Spanish general Cuesta was defeated by the French general Victor. On this occasion Whittingham re-formed the routed cavalry and led them against the enemy. He reported constantly throughout these campaigns to the British minister in Spain, John Hookham Frere, as to the state and operations of the Spanish army.<br>
<br>Shortly before Wellesley's advance into Spain, Whittingham joined the British headquarters on the frontier of Portugal, and became the medium of communication with the Spanish general Cuesta. On 28 July 1809 at Talavera he was severely wounded when gallantly bringing up two Spanish battalions to the attack; he was mentioned in Wellesley's dispatch a day later. He went to Seville to recover, and lived with the British minister, Lord Wellesley; during his convalescence he translated Dundas's <span class="italic">Cavalry Movements</span> into Spanish. He was promoted major-general in the Spanish army on 12 August.<br>
<br>Whittingham married at Gibraltar, in January 1810, Magdalena, the elder of twin daughters of Don Pedro de Creus y Jim&eacute;nez, intendant of the Spanish royal armies, and they had a large family, several of their sons serving in the Spanish army.<br>
<br>During his stay at the British embassy in Seville, Whittingham proposed the idea that was to form the basis of his participation in most of the rest of the war. Convinced that Spaniards would make splendid soldiers if commanded by British officers, he suggested to Henry Wellesley that he form a model division of 10,000 troops in the security of Majorca. Armed and clothed by the British and with at least two British officers per battalion, they could then threaten the French armies in eastern Spain (British command of the sea would enable them to be a powerful raiding force on the Mediterranean coast); meanwhile they might also act as a model for reform in the rest of the army. Though Wellesley eagerly took up the idea, such was Spanish suspicion of the British that Whittingham's proposals met a frosty reception when he presented them at the new capital, Cadiz, in August 1810. However, through the patronage of General Casta&ntilde;os, one of the original members of the collective regency established to govern Spain following the fall of the provisional government (the Junta Central) in January 1810, Whittingham was appointed to command the cavalry of the Spanish army based in Cadiz, in which he succeeded in effecting some improvement. In this capacity in March 1811 he took part in an attempt to raise the siege of Cadiz by landing a substantial force of British and Spanish troops behind the lines of the French forces blockading the city. However, owing to the lack of initiative of the Spanish commander, La Pe&ntilde;a, the operation failed, while Whittingham's own part in it was limited to containing a few squadrons of enemy cavalry in the action at Barrosa on 5 March.<br>
<br>Immediately after the Barrosa campaign Whittingham left Cadiz for Palma de Mallorca, the regency having at last been persuaded to adopt his plans for the establishment of a new mobile division under his command. Even then, because of obstruction from the Spanish authorities, and especially the captain general of Majorca, Gregorio Garc&iacute;a de la Cuesta, the new force&#151;known as the divisi&oacute;n de Mallorca and composed of six battalions of infantry and four squadrons of cavalry&#151;was not ready until the middle of 1812. By then, however, the situation was much changed, and Whittingham's division was incorporated into the expeditionary army sent to Spain from the British base in Sicily. Initially the intention was to besiege the French-held fortress of Tarragona, but this plan was abandoned, and the entire force disembarked at the Spanish-held base of Alicante on 7 August.<br>
<br>Whittingham's troops remained cantoned in the Alicante area through the winter of 1812&#150;13, and suffered extreme privation for want of supplies. The front in this region remained quiet, but in March 1813 the new British commander at Alicante, Sir John Murray, launched an offensive, Whittingham's division being involved in skirmishes at Jijona and Concentaina on 6 and 15 March. In the latter action Whittingham was shot in the cheek, but his wound was apparently not serious enough to force him to relinquish command. Notwithstanding its initial success the offensive soon halted, and in the first week of April a French counter-offensive quickly regained much of the lost ground. By 12 April Murray's entire force was concentrated at Castalla, and on the following day it was attacked by the French forces of Marshal Suchet. Posted on the extreme left of the allied line, Whittingham's division received the full force of the French attack, but managed to beat it off despite a muddle in its orders that led to the English general being caught in the midst of a major change of position. For this action Whittingham deserved great credit: the hard fight by his men vindicated his efforts, and he displayed considerable tactical skill.<br>
<br>Following the battle of Castalla the Alicante front was quiet. Whittingham's next action was Murray's expedition to Tarragona in June 1813. This was a humiliating fiasco; Murray panicked and hastily re-embarked his men in most discreditable circumstances&#151;and the army returned once again to Alicante, being placed under the command of Lord William Bentinck. However, on 21 June Wellington won the decisive victory of Vitoria, which forced the French to evacuate much territory, including the province of Valencia. Whittingham assisted in its reoccupation, then was soon on the Ebro, invading Catalonia on 26 July. Within three weeks, however, a French counter-offensive had sent the army back across the Ebro, the last stages of the retreat being covered by Whittingham, who had to fight a fierce rearguard action at Amposta on 19 August. In the following month Bentinck crossed the Ebro again, but was unable to advance any further than Tarragona due to want of transport and supplies. With the French few in numbers and largely tied up in garrison duty, there was little fighting; Whittingham's division, being left in reserve, did none.<br>
<br>When Ferdinand VII returned to Spain from his French imprisonment in March 1814 Whittingham was in garrison at Valencia, well placed to intervene in the military coup that overthrew the 1812 constitution and restored absolutism. With little love lost between himself and the liberal regime&#151;throughout 1812 and 1813 his long series of disputes with the authorities had become so acrimonious that he had offered his resignation&#151;Whittingham immediately declared his support for the rebellion. To the annoyance of Henry Wellesley, who advocated British neutrality, he headed the march on Madrid, where on the night of 10&#150;11 May 1814 his troops arrested most of the liberal leaders. According to Whittingham, he advised Ferdinand to grant a new constitution more in line with Spanish tradition, but there is no evidence that he ever pressed his views further&#151;he always retained the favour of the king, who in June 1814 presented him with a mosaic snuff-box and made him a lieutenant-general, and on the escape of Napoleon from Elba obtained permission from the British government to appoint him to the command of a division in the army that had hastily to be mobilized in the Pyrenees. For his services on this occasion, he received the grand cross of the order of San Fernando. He continued to enjoy the favour of the court, and from 1815 to 1819 remained in Spain. However, his family was increasing, his private means had been much reduced by losses, and no support was available from the Spanish government. So he was delighted, in July 1819, to accept the governorship of the newly acquired British colony of Dominica.<h2>
<a name="WestIndiesandIndia18191841"></a>West Indies and India, 1819&#150;1841</h2>Whittingham's period in Dominica was apparently popular; the island's &#145;plantocracy&#146; marked his departure with the presentation of a sword of honour, and a cross of the order of San Fernando set in diamonds. Moreover, despite his involvement in the 1814 coup he had never fallen from favour in England. In 1814 he received the rank of colonel in the British army and was appointed an aide-de-camp to the prince regent; and having received praise for his discretion at the court martial of Sir John Murray for his Tarragona failure, Whittingham was knighted and created CB on 3 May 1815. The Dominican appointment was only the first in his distinguished career in British service. In October 1821 he was made a KCH and appointed quartermaster-general&#151;effectively chief-of-staff&#151;of the British forces in India.<br>
<br>Whittingham reached Calcutta on 2 November 1822. He was busy in 1824 with the preparations for the expedition to Ava, and in November with the Barrackpore mutiny. On 27 May 1825 he was promoted major-general; he retained his appointment as quartermaster-general until a command became vacant. He took part in the siege of Bharatpur, was slightly wounded on 13 January 1826, but was present at the capture on 18 January. For his services in this action he was made KCB (military division), on 26 December, and received the thanks of the House of Commons. In February 1827 he was appointed to command the Cawnpore division. On 1 November 1830 he was transferred to the Meerut command, on exchange with Sir Jasper Nicholl. His tenure of command came to an end in August 1833, and he then acted temporarily as military secretary to his old commander, Lord William Bentinck, the governor-general, with whom he returned to England in 1835.<br>
<br>On arrival in England in July he almost fought a duel with Sir William Napier, on account of the slur which he considered Napier had cast on the Spanish troops in his <span class="italic">History of the War in the Peninsula</span>, but the matter was arranged by Sir Rufane Donkin. In October 1836 Whittingham was appointed to command the forces in the Windward and Leeward islands. He sailed for Barbados on 22 December, with the local rank of lieutenant-general (exchanged in a few months for the substantive). In September 1839 he was given the command of the Madras army; he arrived at Madras on 1 August 1840, and died there suddenly on 19 January 1841, at Fort George, where he was buried with military honours on the following day. A memorial tablet was placed in the garrison church, Madras. He had written several published and unpublished military works.<br>
