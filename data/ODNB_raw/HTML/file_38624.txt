<span class="headword">Dimond,  William</span>  (<em>c.</em>1784&#150;1837?), <span class="occ">playwright</span>, the eldest surviving son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/64331/', "William Wyatt Dimond (c.1750&#150;1812)")</script>, actor and theatrical manager, and his wife, Matilda Martha, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Baker (<i>d</i>. 1823), was born at Bath, where Dimond senior managed the Theatre Royal jointly with the theatre at Bristol. He was educated by the Revd Dr Morgan; the title-page of <span class="italic">Adrian and Orrila</span> (1807) describes him as &#145;of the Honourable Society of the Inner Temple&#146;. But he had already entered on a literary career by contributing Della Cruscan poems to the <span class="italic">Morning Herald</span> under the signature Castalio. <span class="italic">Petrarchal Sonnets, and Miscellaneous Poems</span> was published in 1800 by subscription and dedicated to the duchess of York; the volume was criticized for its immature extravagances of diction. In the following year, however, Dimond had a comic opera, <span class="italic">The Sea-Side Story</span>, produced as a benefit piece, with some success. In all he wrote about thirty pieces for the stage, including operas, musical entertainments, and melodramas. Despite his rejection of &#145;scenic shew&#146; in the prologue to <span class="italic">The Sea-Side Story</span>, his dramas evinced a strong tendency towards the striking tableau, the exotic setting, and the picturesque pose; his adaptation of Byron's <span class="italic">Bride of Abydos</span> (1819) offers a series of frenzied encounters and explosive scenic effects. The <span class="italic">British Critic</span> found <span class="italic">Adrian and Orrila</span> interesting, but criticized the dialogue for being &#145;generally too florid, bordering frequently upon affectation, and occasionally &hellip; not far removed from nonsense&#146;  (<span class="italic">British Critic</span>, 29, 431&#150;2). Six years later the same journal, reviewing Dimond's patriotic extravaganza <span class="italic">The Royal Oak</span> (1811), commented:<blockquote>We have often met with Mr. Dimond, and have always found something to praise and something to censure in him. It will never be better. The talents he received from nature have wanted the cultivation of good taste; and the offences against propriety which wild genius commits, will never be corrected by ill-judging audiences. (ibid., 41, 302&#150;3)</blockquote>Hazlitt found in Dimond's plays<blockquote>so strong a family likeness that, from having seen any one of them, we may form a tolerable correct idea of the rest &hellip; The author does not profess to provide a public entertainment at his own entire expense, and from his own proper funds, but contracts with the manager to get up a striking and impressive exhibition in conjunction with the scene-painter, the scene-shifter, the musical composer, the orchestra, the chorusses on the stage, and the <i>lungs</i> of the actors! (<span class="italic">Complete Works</span>, 5.366)</blockquote>In a late play, however (<span class="italic">Stage Struck</span>, 1835), Dimond burlesques melodramatic styles of acting.<br>
<br>Dimond's father died in 1812, leaving him a joint share of the estate. He took over the management of the Bath and Bristol theatres. In 1817 he was living in what was his father's house in Norfolk Crescent, Bath. He relinquished control of the Bath theatre in 1823, according to Alfred Bunn, who added that since that time, Dimond had been<blockquote>in many jails (in Horsemonger Lane, under the name of James Bryant,) and tried in many courts, (he was tried at Croydon assizes under the name of <i>William Driver</i>,) under many names, for heinous crimes&#151;out of all of which he escaped by more miracles; his deeds at Bath, the early and great scene of his profligacy, would fit a volume in the narration. (Bunn, 10&#150;11)</blockquote>Bunn was not, however, a disinterested witness, having been hoaxed by Dimond in 1834 by some forged letters purportedly from Mrs Mardyn, a lover of Byron, volunteering to come and perform Byron's work as he had taught her in Bunn's production. Bunn announced the coup, &#145;Mrs Mardyn&#146; pulled out at the last minute, and Bunn investigated to find that Dimond (writing from Paris) had been the author of the letters. Bunn reports that Dimond died in Paris in late 1837.<br>
