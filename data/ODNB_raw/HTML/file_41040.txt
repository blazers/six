<span class="headword">Walford <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Colquhoun]</span>,  Lucy Bethia</span>  (1845&#150;1915), <span class="occ">novelist and artist</span>, was born on 17 April 1845 at 11 Brighton Crescent, Portobello, Edinburgh, the seventh child of Frances Sara Fuller Maitland (1813&#150;1877), poet and hymn writer, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5989/', "John Colquhoun (1805&#150;1885)")</script> of Luss, Dunbartonshire, a sportsman, naturalist, author of <span class="italic">The Moor and the Loch</span>, and former military officer. Her paternal grandfather was Sir James Colquhoun, baronet, and her grandmother was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5987/', "Lady Janet Colquhoun (1781&#150;1846)")</script>, a religious writer. Other family connections included her aunt, the evangelical novelist Catherine Sinclair (1800&#150;1864). Lucy Colquhoun led a privileged childhood, spending summers either at her mother's family home near Henley-on-Thames, Oxfordshire, at the highland family seat at Rossdhu, Dunbartonshire, or in touring the Western Isles. Educated at home by German governesses, she began reading avidly at an early age and was strongly influenced by the works of Charlotte Yonge, Susan Ferrier, and, in later years, Jane Austen&#151;influences reflected in her subsequent writing. In 1855 the family moved to 6 Eton Terrace in Edinburgh, but dissatisfaction with the accommodation prompted a move shortly after to 1 Royal Terrace. Here the family entertained members of Edinburgh society, including the painter No&euml;l Paton, who encouraged Lucy Colquhoun to take up painting. Success came in 1868 when she exhibited work at the annual Royal Scottish Academy exhibition, a practice she continued for several years following. About this time she also began writing secretly and her first short piece was published in May 1869 in the <span class="italic">Sunday Magazine</span>. In June of that year she married Alfred Saunders Walford (<i>d</i>. 1907), magistrate, of Cranbrook Hall, Ilford, Essex, and they moved to London; they had two sons and five daughters.<br>
<br>In 1874, after many years of work, Lucy Walford published her first novel, <span class="italic">Mr Smith: a Part of his Life</span>, with the Edinburgh firm William Blackwood &amp; Son. A light-hearted treatment of domestic life, it proved a great success and was admired by Queen Victoria, to whom she was presented at Buckingham Palace a year or so later as a consequence. Coventry Patmore also admired it, and he praised her in the <span class="italic">St James Gazette</span> as the equal of Thomas Hardy. Her subsequent works continued in the same vein and included <span class="italic">Pauline</span> (1877), <span class="italic">The Baby's Grandmother</span> (1884), <span class="italic">Cousins</span> (1885), <span class="italic">Stiff Necked Generation</span> (1889), and <span class="italic">The Havoc of a Smile</span> (1890). Her last novel, <span class="italic">David and Jonathan on the Riviera</span>, was published in 1914. She also wrote extensively for various London journals, including <span class="italic">The World</span>, and from 1889 to 1893 served as the London correspondent for the New York-based publication <span class="italic">The Critic</span>. By the time of her death on 11 May 1915 at her London home, 17 Warwick Square, Pimlico, Lucy Walford had published more than forty-five books, including two memoirs, <span class="italic">Recollections of a Scottish Novelist</span> (1910) and <span class="italic">Memories of Victorian London</span> (1912).<br>
