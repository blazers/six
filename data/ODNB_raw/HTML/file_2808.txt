<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Bolton,  Samuel</span>  (1605/6&#150;1654), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and college head</span>, was the son of William Bolton of Lancashire. Educated at Manchester School, he matriculated as a pensioner at Christ's College in 1625, graduated BA in 1629, and proceeded MA in 1632. In 1633 he married Elianor Little, and in 1634 was curate of Harrow, Middlesex. For three years from about 1638 he was minister of St Martin Ludgate, London, and then for seven years minister of St Saviour's, Southwark. In 1641 he was also appointed as a lecturer at St Anne and St Agnes, Aldersgate.<br>
<br>Highly regarded both as a preacher and as a pastor, in 1642 Bolton was appointed to the Westminster assembly. His first publication was a set of fast sermons, <span class="italic">A Tossed Ship Making to Safe Harbor, or, A Word in Season to a Sinking Kingdome</span> (1644). In <span class="italic">The Guard of the Tree of Life</span> (1645), dedicated to his &#145;beloved friends&#146; the congregation at Southwark, he described his work and that of his fellow minister in encouraging a right attitude to the Lord's supper. Pastoral concern and an essentially moderate stance characterize both this volume and his <span class="italic">The True Bounds of Christian Freedome</span> of the same year, dedicated to the earl of Manchester.<br>
<br>In 1645 Bolton was chosen as master of Christ's College, Cambridge, but &#145;his desire to win souls to Christ by preaching was so great&#146;  (Calamy, 25) that he continued to give regular sermons in London, especially at St Andrew's, Holborn. He was still described as the minister of St Saviour's in <span class="italic">The Arraignment of Error</span> (1646), dedicated to John, &#145;Lord Roberts&#146; (Robartes). Despite its title the work stressed the need to avoid unnecessary controversy and seek happy accommodation; the pastoral use of synods and the power of the civil magistrate, &#145;a nursing father to the church&#146;  (p. 317) were necessary, but both should be limited and clearly defined. On 29 July 1646, choosing as his texts verses on waiting in hope and the blessedness of peacemakers, he gave a fast sermon to the Lords, subsequently published as <span class="italic">Deliverance in a Birth</span> (1647). He was probably the Mr Bolton who, on 9 March 1649, attended the failed peacemaker, the earl of Holland, on the scaffold.<br>
<br>Bolton did not neglect Cambridge, serving as vice-chancellor of the university from 1650 to 1652. In December 1650 he was one of six college heads who, in response to the parliamentary visitors' demands for subscription to the engagement, petitioned &#145;protesting as we had adhered to the parliament, soe we would live peaceably not disturbing the present government, desireing this might be accepted for our subscription&#146;  (Twigg, 156). In 1654 he was nominated as an assistant to the committee of ejectors in Cambridgeshire, Huntingdonshire, and the Isle of Ely, but by this time he had succumbed to a &#145;long, tedious and costly sickness&#146;: his diseases, according to Edmund Calamy, who visited him, were &#145;many, very many&#146;  (Calamy, 26).<br>
<br>Bolton died on 15 October 1654, aged forty-eight, and was buried four days later. His funeral sermon, preached by Calamy at St Martin Ludgate, was published both as <span class="italic">The Saint's Transfiguration</span> (1655), an official version dedicated to the earl of Warwick and acknowledging the deceased as &#145;very dear to Lady Lucy Roberts&#146;, and also as <span class="italic">The Doctrine of the Bodies Fragility</span> (1655), a surreptitious version&#151;the duplication a testament to Bolton's standing among the godly. &#145;He was&#146;, asserted Calamy, &#145;a shining light in this our Israel &hellip; a workman that needed not to be ashamed &hellip; [whose] life was an excellent commentary upon his sermons&#146;  (Calamy, 24). Two years later a series of Bolton's treatises &#145;prepared for the press in the author's lifetime&#146; were published as <span class="italic">The Dead Saint Speaking</span>. Dedicated by his widow, Elianor, to the earl and countess of Warwick, these were largely devotional in character, but in &#145;The wonderful workings of God for his church and people&#146; Bolton exhibited continuing public, political concerns: &#145;the Grounds of hope from the Church of God, the good of most other reformed Churches in the Christian world doth depend upon the welfare of England&#146;.<br>
