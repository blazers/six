</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Dawson, Sir  John William</span>  (1820&#150;1899), <span class="occ">geologist and educationist</span>, was born on 13 October 1820 in Pictou, Nova Scotia, the elder of the two sons of James Dawson (1789&#150;1858?), then a merchant and later a bookseller, and Mary Rankine of Stirlingshire. Mary, whose parents had died when she was young, was raised by relatives in Edinburgh, possibly the Boyds of the well-known firm of booksellers Oliver and Boyd. James Dawson was also Scottish, from Ordiquhill, in the north. By the time William (as he was always called by family and friends) was born, James Dawson had embarked on a career as a bookseller, enabling him eventually to discharge earlier debts incurred in maritime trade. William Dawson's intense earnestness and self-reliance were honed in this environment, where his parents constantly struggled to make ends meet. Frugality was probably as important as piety in the Dawson household, both giving him an inescapable and omnipresent seriousness of purpose.<br>
<br>Although lacking in material wealth, Dawson had access to a good education at Pictou Academy, which provided him and his peers with a firm grounding in a range of subjects, especially in the natural sciences. It housed an extensive collection of scientific apparatus, a small natural history museum, and a library with a remarkable assortment of treatises in natural philosophy and natural history. Physically the coastal town was surrounded by rich sandstone and shale rock formations, which contained Carboniferous fossil plants. These provided fertile ground for Dawson's first scientific explorations, and allowed him to put together a respectable collection of geological and palaeontological specimens. When he was sixteen he delivered a paper, &#145;The structure and history of the earth&#146;, to the Pictou Literary and Scientific Society.<br>
<br>In 1840, at the age of twenty, Dawson decided to return to his parents' homeland, where he matriculated at the University of Edinburgh and studied natural history. Although he remained fiercely proud of his birthplace and sensitive to any charges of hailing from the backwoods, Canadian life must have seemed impoverished compared to the riches of Edinburgh, a city still riding the fame of its golden years. Financial difficulties called him back to Pictou at the end of the academic year but he subsequently returned to Edinburgh in 1847, to extend his studies and to marry Margaret Ann Young Mercer (<i>b</i>. 1829/30), a distant cousin and the daughter of a lace merchant. (Later, as principal of McGill University, he received an MA from the University of Edinburgh in 1856 and an LLD in 1884.) So smitten was he with Edinburgh and its university that he stood unsuccessfully for posts there on two later occasions.<br>
<br>Dawson's return to Pictou in 1841 to help with the family bookselling business could not have been better timed. The following summer he met William Logan, who was about to become director of the geological survey of Canada, and accompanied him on a geological tour of the Nova Scotian countryside, as he did about the same time with Charles Lyell. Thereafter Dawson maintained a cordial relationship with Logan and became the lifelong prot&eacute;g&eacute;, confidant, and disciple of Lyell. On his return to Nova Scotia in 1847 after the completion of a second academic session at the University of Edinburgh (accompanied then by his seventeen-year-old bride), he sought to enlarge the sphere of his business activities beyond bookselling. He was hired by the General Mining Association of London to conduct a geological survey of Cape Breton, and also investigated coal and other mineral deposits for the provincial government and for small mining companies.<br>
<br>Dawson turned his talents, as well, to educational matters, a realm that would increasingly occupy him. During the early 1850s he travelled the length and breadth of Nova Scotia as its first superintendent of education (1850&#150;53). His devotion to the task was so complete that he is credited with single-handedly reforming the public educational system of the province. He managed at the same time to continue his scientific investigations, leading to some of his most important palaeontological discoveries. These included unearthing a fragment of a skeleton of the earliest North American reptile or batrachian (<i>Dendrerpeton acadianum</i>), the oldest land snail (<i>Pupa vetusta</i>), and the oldest millipede (<i>Xylobius sigillariae</i>). His investigations into the geology and mineral deposits of Nova Scotia provided data for his <span class="italic">Acadian Geology</span> (1855; 4th edn, 1891). This work, the most complete treatment of maritime geology of its day and only slightly modified by the findings of the geological survey of Canada years later, made his reputation as a geologist of the first rank.<br>
<br>In 1855 Dawson left his native province to accept the unanticipated offer of the position of principal of McGill University, Montreal, a post which he held until 1893. He became the indefatigable architect of McGill's rise to educational eminence. Besides his responsibilities as principal, he served as professor of natural science and principal of McGill Normal School (1857&#150;70), which trained teachers for Quebec's protestant schools. After he stepped down from the principalship he continued to serve McGill as emeritus principal and professor, governors' fellow, and honorary curator of the Peter Redpath Museum.<br>
<br>Dawson's vigorous promotion of Canada's scientific institutions extended beyond the boundaries of McGill. He successfully lobbied for the formation of a national scientific organization, resulting in the creation of the Royal Society of Canada in 1882, for which he served as the first president. During the early 1880s, as well, he brought both the American and the British associations for the advancement of science to meet in Montreal. His firm guidance was felt in the affairs of the geological survey of Canada and in myriad scientific societies, especially the Natural History Society of Montreal.<br>
<br>From the 1860s onwards Dawson published an average of ten scientific papers a year, in addition to articles on educational, social, and religious matters. His scientific writings appeared in a wide range of journals and society proceedings, but the <span class="italic">Canadian Naturalist</span>, <span class="italic">Quarterly Journal of the Geological Society</span>, and <span class="italic">American Journal of Science</span> each published more than thirty individual papers.<br>
<br>Dawson's contributions to palaeontology and geology extend beyond publications alone. His unstinting fieldwork, first in Nova Scotia and later in Quebec, increased the number of post-Pliocene fossils known in Canada from about 30 to more than 200. He often chided his scientific adversaries that they should leave their armchairs and cabinets in order to observe specimens <i>in situ</i>. He helped to perfect the examination of thin fossil slices using a microscope, a technique that allowed him to describe 125 new species of Palaeozoic plants. His own collection of Canadian rocks and fossils formed the nucleus of the holdings of the Peter Redpath Museum, which was donated to McGill in Dawson's honour in 1882. Dawson discovered the puzzling fossil <i>Eozo&ouml;n canadense</i> in 1864, a fragment that appeared to be a foraminifer. For the rest of his life he argued that the specimen proved the presence of animal life in the Laurentian rocks, despite mounting evidence of its inorganic composition.<br>
<br>Dawson wrote numerous works of popular science. Some of these served polemical purposes in his arguments against the glacial theory (he pushed the efficacy of icebergs or &#145;floating ice&#146;) and evolution (he even took issue with Asa Gray's theistic version), or to promote his views on <i>Eozo&ouml;n</i>. Examples include <span class="italic">The Story of the Earth and Man</span> (1872), <span class="italic">The Dawn of Life</span> (1875), and <span class="italic">Modern Ideas of Evolution</span> (1890). Almost all sought to reconcile scientific truths with religious doctrine, as in <span class="italic">Archaia</span> (1857), <span class="italic">Nature and the Bible</span> (1875), and <span class="italic">The Meeting Place of Geology and History</span> (1894). Because of his devout Presbyterianism, intense anti-evolutionism, and firm commitment to the letter of biblical scripture, he was in great demand as a lecturer at religiously affiliated educational institutions across the United States and Canada. Reflecting his abiding interest in education and lucid scientific exposition, he also wrote textbooks geared towards Canadian students&#151;<span class="italic">Agriculture for Schools</span> (1864), <span class="italic">Hand-Book of Canadian Zoology</span> (1871), and <span class="italic">Hand-Book of Canadian Geology</span> (1889).<br>
<br>Apart from his important role as a popularizer and institution builder, Dawson's scientific reputation rests on his work in palaeobotany. He investigated Canadian formations stretching from the maritime provinces to the west coast, culminating in the <span class="italic">Geological History of Plants</span> (1888), and published several papers on the subject every year. His more uneven contributions to palaeozoology (the interminable <i>Eozo&ouml;n</i> controversy marred his reputation in this realm) treated a variety of organisms ranging from the lowest forms of life to prehistoric man (in <span class="italic">Fossil Men</span>, 1880). His scientific legacy includes pioneering work in Canadian geology, particularly for the eastern provinces and the St Lawrence River valley.<br>
<br>Dawson accumulated many scientific honours and awards, both in Canada and abroad. He became a fellow of the Geological Society in 1854 and of the Royal Society in 1862. He presided over the British Association's meeting at Birmingham in 1886, and over the American Association at Montreal in 1882. In 1893 he became president of the American Geological Society. He was knighted in 1884. He also received honorary or corresponding memberships in many other learned societies. Five of his six children survived to adulthood. The eldest son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32753/', "George Mercer Dawson")</script>, became Canada's leading field geologist and director of the geological survey of Canada. Dawson died at his home, 293 University Street, Montreal, on 19 November 1899 following several years' struggle with chronic pneumonia; he was buried in Mount Royal cemetery in Montreal on 21 November.<br>
