<span class="headword">Constable,  Henry</span>, first Viscount Dunbar  (1588&#150;1645), <span class="occ">landowner and royalist army officer</span>, was the eldest son of Sir Henry Constable (<i>c</i>.1559&#150;1608) of Burton Constable and Halsham in Holderness, and Margaret Dormer (<i>d</i>. 1637), daughter of Sir William Dormer of Wing, Buckinghamshire. Sir Henry Constable was elected MP for Hedon in 1584, 1586, and 1604, and for the county of Yorkshire in 1589, and was sheriff there in 1586&#150;7. Although the Constables had become one of the richest families in the East Riding as a result of their acquisition of many former monastic properties, Henry Constable's mother and uncle Joseph Constable were two of the most obstinate recusants in Yorkshire; his father conformed outwardly but left legacies to students in foreign seminaries. Accompanied by his private tutor he entered Trinity College, Oxford, at the age of eight and spent three years there. He succeeded to the considerable family estate at the age of twenty.<br>
<br>Constable was knighted on 14 March 1615 and created Baron Constable and Viscount Dunbar in the Scottish peerage on 14 November 1620. He was deputy justice in eyre for Galtres forest and deputy lieutenant in the East Riding, but was best-known as a hard-drinking, heavy-gambling papist. At one session alone he was said to have lost &pound;3000. In 1630 he compounded for his recusancy and later received a letter from King Charles excusing him from church attendance.<br>
<br>In 1639 Dunbar helped the king raise money for his Scottish war and in 1642 he was denounced in the Commons as &#145;a powerful papist&#146; who had supplied Charles with &#145;great store of arms&#146;  (Coates, Young, and Snow, 240). Early in 1644 he subscribed to the Yorkshire engagement and took a colonel's commission in Newcastle's royalist army. All three of his sons fought on the king's side: John (1615&#150;1668), the eldest, was eventually exiled to Amsterdam, and Matthew and Henry joined their father when he took refuge with Sir Hugh Cholmley at Scarborough. On 28 June 1645 Dunbar died of wounds received in the siege of the castle, where both his younger sons were injured. Burton Constable Hall was plundered, the estate sequestered by parliament, and John inherited debts of &pound;17,550. On account of her recusancy John's widowed mother, Mary (<i>d</i>. 1659), daughter of Sir John Tufton of Hothfield, Kent, lost all but one third of her portion of &pound;200 a year.<br>
