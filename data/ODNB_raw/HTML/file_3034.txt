<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Bowen,  Charles Synge Christopher</span>, Baron Bowen  (1835&#150;1894), <span class="occ">judge</span>, was born on 1 January 1835 at Woolaston, Gloucestershire, the eldest son of the Revd Christopher Bowen (1801/2&#150;1890), clergyman, an Irishman from co. Mayo, and Catherine Emily Steele (1807/8&#150;1902), whose father, Sir Richard Steele, of the 4th dragoon guards, was an Irish baronet, and whose mother was of mixed Austrian and Irish parentage. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/31998/', "Edward Ernest Bowen")</script>, schoolmaster, was his younger brother. After attending school in Lille, France, and at Blackheath, Kent, Bowen entered Rugby School at the age of fifteen, already a precocious scholar: he was discovered on his first day reading Euripides' <span class="italic">Alcestis</span> for &#145;amusement&#146;  (Cunningham, 18). The masters found him &#145;delightfully clever&#146;  (ibid., 17), and the perennial prize-winner was also popular as an outstanding all-round athlete. Well built, outgoing, and adventurous, he was at one point sorely tempted to join the army. In 1853 he won a scholarship at Balliol College, Oxford. His glittering attainments included the Hertford scholarship for Latin, the chancellor's prize for Latin verse, the Ireland scholarship for classics, and the Arnold historical prize. In 1857, while still an undergraduate, he was elected a fellow, subsequently obtaining first-class honours in <i>literae humaniores</i>, and graduating with a BA. He was president of the Union in 1858.<br>
<br>The same year, Bowen began to read for the bar as a student at Lincoln's Inn. The contrast with Oxford he found deeply depressing: so painful was the memory of that time that in after years he would avoid the very vicinity of his former chambers. In 1860 he suffered the first of many breakdowns in health that were to dog his entire career. Very soon after being called to the bar in January 1861, he became engaged to Emily Frances (<i>d</i>. 1897), eldest daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/23364/', "James Meadows Rendel")</script>, a civil engineer; he joined the western circuit in October and on 7 January 1862 the couple married. Marriage was a bold, perhaps a reckless step for a man without private means who, at twenty-seven, had still to make his way, and who, his constitution already undermined, henceforth enjoyed precarious health, suffering further breakdowns in 1865 and 1868, by which time he had two sons and a daughter. After an unpropitious start on the circuit, he gained the friendship of one of the leaders there, John Duke Coleridge, later lord chief justice, who invited him to join his chambers. With his help, Bowen gradually acquired a reputation for perception and thoroughness. In 1868 he was appointed secretary to the Totnes bribery commission, in 1869 a revising barrister, in 1870 a member of a commission to investigate the operation of the <span class="roman">Truck Acts</span>, and later that year he was made recorder of Penzance.<br>
<br>From 1871 to 1874, throughout the protracted hearings of the Tichborne case, Bowen was active as junior counsel for the defendants against the claimant Orton. His senior, John Duke Coleridge, always stressed the immense debt which he owed to Bowen, who, with a diligence and pertinacity which Coleridge classed as &#145;superhuman&#146;  (Cunningham, 133), and aided by a prodigious memory, made himself master of every detail of the case, and who, by painstakingly testing the claimant's minutest allegations, enabled Coleridge successfully to rebut them and to expose Orton as an impostor. Bowen is thought to have devised the preamble much used by Coleridge as a means of avoiding a leading question: &#145;Would you be surprised to hear that&#151;?&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>). At Orton's subsequent trial for perjury Bowen was appointed one of four prosecuting counsel. But the cumulative strain proved too much, and he again collapsed. The celebrated Tichborne case later (1998) became the subject of a film.<br>
<br>When Coleridge became attorney-general, he appointed Bowen as junior counsel to the Treasury in 1872. In this capacity Bowen appeared for the crown in many important common-law and commercial cases and rapidly acquired a large commercial clientele. In 1878 his health once more broke down, and he took a tour through Russia to Constantinople. In 1879 he was knighted, and Lord Chancellor Cairns appointed him a judge of the Queen's Bench Division. A year later he again fell seriously ill. In June 1882 he was raised by Lord Chancellor Selborne to the Court of Appeal, where he served for nine years. In Lord Davey's words: &#145;it is upon his work there that his judicial reputation will rest&#146;  (Davey, 215).<br>
<br>According to his entry in the <span class="italic">Biographical Dictionary of the Common Law</span>, Bowen &#145;does not rank as one of the greater of the Victorian judges&#146;. This verdict is somewhat harsh. Sir Frederick Pollock considered Willes, Macnaghten, and Bowen &#145;the greatest English judges I have known&#146;  (Pollock, 172); and C. H. S. Fifoot held that a Court of Appeal of which Bowen, Lindley, and Lord Justice Fry were members &#145;challenges comparison with any before or since&#146;  (Fifoot, 20). Liberal and open-minded, Bowen was a reformer, rightly impatient of legal technicalities which impeded justice. His views on the function of law in society were dynamic: &#145;it changes, it must change, it ought to change&#146;  (Bowen, &#145;Administration of the law&#146;, 329); and his judicial activism is exemplified in the case of the armament manufacturer Nordenfelt (1892), where he held that a worldwide covenant in restraint of trade&#151;prima facie void&#151;was enforceable in the public interest. In <i>The Mogul Steamship Company v. McGregor</i> (1889), he ruled that the elimination of commercial competitors, however robust the means employed, as long as they are not unlawful, is not actionable. <i>Thomas v. Quartermaine</i> (1887) remains an authority on contributory negligence and the maxim <i>volenti non fit injuria</i>.<br>
<br>Bowen was ever the scholarly Oxonian, &#145;precise, scrupulous, even fastidious, in the spoken and in the written word&#146;  (Fifoot, 40). Observers noted his deferential mildness as an advocate, &#145;that extremely polite and lady-like manner for which he was famed&#146;  (Williams, 223) and his &#145;ineffectiveness&#146; when addressing juries  (Lord Justice Mathew, in Coleridge, 2.404). A self-deprecating irony sometimes misfired. In an early case, he prosecuted a burglar who had been apprehended on the roof with the tools of his trade. &#145;If, gentlemen of the jury&#146;, Bowen is supposed to have said:<blockquote>you think that the accused was on the roof of the house to enjoy the midnight breeze, and, by pure accident, happened to have about him the necessary tools of a housebreaker, with no dishonest intention of employing them, you will, of course acquit him. (Fifoot, 20)</blockquote>The jury took him at his word.Bowen's legal reputation owed more to his intellectual finesse than to his style of advocacy: another contemporary described him as &#145;a legal archangel who danced with ease on the point of a needle&#146;  (Smith, 129). But the ease was deceptive: his forensic triumphs were the hard-earned fruit of strenuous lucubrations, of a self-doubting and almost morbid perfectionism in preparing his cases. &#145;Cases&#146;, he said, &#145;are won at chambers&#146;  (Cunningham, 135); and the fine points which he successfully pleaded were drafted and redrafted beforehand &#145;with the finest camel-hair pencils&#146;  (Smith, 129). Members of his chambers, who included H. H. Asquith, had a very high regard for him. On the bench he demonstrated the same meticulous attention to detail, the same &#145;mastery of the law, expressed in fastidious prose&#146;  (Fifoot, 20), and the same anxious, to some over-anxious, solicitude for justice which characterized what Lord Esher called his &#145;intense sense of duty&#146;  (Davey, 216).<br>
<br>But his heart was not altogether in the law. &#145;Professional life&#146;, he confessed, &#145;is not worth the sacrifices it entails&#146;  (Cunningham, 193). In early years he admitted to hating the law; and for one whom some thought &#145;perhaps the most brilliant man of his generation&#146;  (Biron, 89), ceaseless toil in an essentially uncongenial calling sapped his vitality and was perhaps the underlying cause of his chronic ill health. Even promotion to the bench&#151;which curtailed his hopes, probably illusory, but long nurtured, of a parliamentary career&#151;left him &#145;a bitterly disappointed man&#146;  (Graham, 111). A lifelong friend of Benjamin Jowett, master of Balliol, he might have been happier as a don or man of letters. &#145;He might have been a poet&#146;, Lord Justice Davey reflected, &#145;as he might have been a good many other things&#146;  (Davey, 231). Poetry, classical and English, he relished both as reader and practitioner. He published a verse translation of Virgil's <span class="italic">Eclogues</span> and the first six books of the <span class="italic">Aeneid</span> in 1887, and almost his last composition was an exquisite Latin rendering of Landor's valedictory quatrain &#145;I strove with none&#146;.<br>
<br>To write a legal textbook Bowen dismissed as a task too ephemeral to be worth the effort. In 1868, however, he published a pamphlet advocating Anglo-American arbitration in the <i>Alabama</i> dispute; and he wrote several pieces relating to the administration of justice: in 1886 on the effects of the <span class="roman">Judicature Acts</span>; in 1887 on law reform across the reign of Victoria. In 1892, having served on a unique committee of judges charged with reviewing the administration of the courts, he compiled and published its far-reaching recommendations; and in 1893, as chairman of a Home Office commission set up following rioting at Featherstone colliery in Yorkshire, he produced a report on the citizen's duty to lend assistance in time of public disturbance. All these writings are compendious, perspicuous, judicious, and authoritative.<br>
<br>Having been snubbed as a young barrister in his first appearance before Lord Justice Cockburn, Bowen never forgot that wounding experience, and he was always gracious and courteous on the bench. Out of court he was remarkably relaxed, companionable, and expansive, &#145;bright and youthful&#146;, as Mr Justice Mathew observed, &#145;ready to discuss any subject&#146;  (Cunningham, 155). He was much sought after for his ready wit, full of whimsy and repartee, often preceded by a misleadingly solemn air. His fellow judges, drafting an address to Queen Victoria, objected to the phrase &#145;Conscious as we are of our shortcomings&#146;. It was Bowen who demurely suggested: &#145;Conscious as we are of one another's shortcomings&#146;  (Cunningham, 183). Throughout his life Bowen retained his youthful looks and remarkably fine eyes. But his friendly mien and sense of humour concealed a spirit sometimes despondent and sceptical. Behind the kindly smile ran a vein of melancholy, a sense of life's brevity and vanity. Relief and diversion were afforded by the purchase of a country house at Colwood in Sussex, by travel at home and abroad, including a journey across Canada with Lord Coleridge in 1883, which, however, exhaustion obliged him to cut short.<br>
<br>Bowen was an active member of the Council of Legal Education. He was a bencher of Lincoln's Inn in 1879. Oxford granted him a DCL (1883), Balliol elected him its visitor (1885). He was a fellow of the Royal Society (1885) and a trustee of the British Museum. He was elected to a number of clubs, including the Athenaeum (1878), the Literary Society and Grillons (1880), the &#145;Dilettanti&#146;, and &#145;The Club&#146;. Lord Chancellor Herschell appointed him a lord of appeal in ordinary as Baron Bowen of Colwood in August 1893; but since 1890 illness had again supervened, and after only a few months in the upper house, he died of abdominal cancer on 10 April 1894 at his home at 13 Princes Gardens, Knightsbridge, aged fifty-nine. He was buried in Slaugham churchyard, Sussex, near his country home. A marble tablet was raised to his memory in the vestibule of Lincoln's Inn chapel.<br>
