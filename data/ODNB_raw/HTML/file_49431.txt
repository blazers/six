<span class="headword">Cust,  Maria Eleanor Vere</span>  (1862/3&#150;1958), <span class="occ">first woman fellow of the Royal Geographical Society</span>, was the second daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32685/', "Robert Needham Cust (1821&#150;1909)")</script>, orientalist, and his first wife, Maria Adelaide Hobart (<i>d</i>. 1864), daughter of Henry Lewis Hobart, dean of Windsor. Miss Cust acted for many years as her father's secretary, materially aiding his studies, and also worked for many years as a medical missionary in India. Her father, an active fellow of the Royal Geographical Society, keenly advocated the admission of women as fellows. The society's desire for pre-eminence in sponsoring exploration sat ill with its inability to elect eminent women travellers to its numbers, and its decision to award medals to Lady Franklin and Mary Somerville served only to emphasize how untenable was its more general exclusion of women. After deciding in 1847 that it was &#145;not deemed expedient at present&#146;  (Mill, 57) to consider a suggestion that women be admitted as members, and in 1860 that women should not be admitted as honorary members, the council of the society agreed on 4 July 1892 to the election of women to the fellowship on the same footing as men. On 28 November 1892 fifteen &#145;well qualified ladies&#146;  (Mill, 107) were elected after the approval of a motion by Robert Cust that &#145;this meeting desires to associate itself with the gracious act of the Council in recognising the right of ladies to the fellowship of the Royal Geographical Society&#146;  (<span class="italic">GJ</span>, 1893). The women were to be presented to the president in alphabetical order and, in the absence of Isabella Bird Bishop who was in Tibet, the ceremonial welcome was received by Miss Cust. Opponents ensured that the 1892 election was followed by a long period in which no women were elected and the issue was finally settled only in 1913, since when women have been elected on the same basis as men. Maria Cust's pride in her fellowship was shown by her including it on the title-page of her only published work, <span class="italic">Lucem sequor</span> (1906), a collection of her own indifferent verse&#151;which shows the influence of her religion and the East&#151;and of her passable translations of Heine, von Eichendorff, Hugo, and others. Miss Cust died at The Hydro, Stansboroughs, Watford, Hertfordshire, on 2 January 1958 at the age of ninety-five, a few days after breaking her leg. Her obituarist wrote: &#145;knowledgeable and well travelled, she retained to the end of her life &hellip; friends of all ages who regarded her as a pioneer of women's activity in a sphere wider than the domestic one&#146;  (<span class="italic">GJ</span>, 1958, 146). This is a kind interpretation and she is remembered now chiefly as a symbol of the recognition of women's fitness to engage in public life on the same terms as men.<br>
