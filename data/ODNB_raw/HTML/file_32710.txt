<span class="headword">Fachiri <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>D'Ar&aacute;nyi]</span>,  Adila Adrienne Adalbertina Maria</span>  (1886&#150;1962), <span class="occ">violinist</span>, was born in Budapest, Hungary, on 26 February 1886, the eldest of the three daughters of Taksony Ar&aacute;nyi de Hunyadvar, chief of police in Budapest, and his wife, Adrienne Nievarovicz de Ligenza, the fourteenth child of a Pole of good family from the Cracow district. Her sister, the third daughter, <a name="cosubject_32710"></a><span class="headword">Jelly Eva D'Ar&aacute;nyi</span>  (1893&#150;1966), also a <span class="occ">violinist</span>, was born in Budapest on 30 May 1893. Their mother, Adrienne, was the niece of Joseph Joachim, the celebrated violinist and friend of Brahms. The entire family was musical and both girls began their musical training as children at the piano; B&eacute;la Bart&oacute;k, as a student of twenty-two, was among their teachers and became a lifelong friend. It was as violinists, however, that the two entered the Budapest Academy of Music as children; they became pupils of the great violinist Jen&oacute; Hubay.<br>
<br>Adila began to play in public when she was fourteen, winning the approval of Budapest critics and the affection of audiences not only for her playing but also for her charm. In 1906, the year of her d&eacute;but in Vienna, she won the artists' diploma of the Budapest Academy and, although an impresario at once offered her a favourable contract, she went to Berlin to become the only private pupil of her celebrated great-uncle.<br>
<br>Although Joachim died in 1907, not only was Adila's playing profoundly influenced by him, but it also brought her into contact with Joachim's circle, including such musicians as Grieg, Humperdinck, Casals, Ysa&yuml;e, and the distinguished English musicologist Donald Tovey. Her work under Joachim included not only the standard concertos and the violin and piano works of the nineteenth-century masters but also the music of eighteenth-century composers, including the accompanied and unaccompanied violin music of Bach. At the same time she never disdained effective showpieces by composers like Saint-Sa&euml;ns, Sarasate, and Wieniawski.<br>
<br>Joachim had planned to conduct Adila's d&eacute;but in Berlin, with the Philharmonic Orchestra there, in November 1907, and the concert was given in spite of his death; the impression Adila made opened the doors of many other important concerts for her, and she travelled widely, introducing Jelly as a supporting artist and as her partner in Bach's D minor double concerto. Jelly's formal training thus ended by the time she was fourteen.<br>
<br>Adila's English d&eacute;but took place in 1909. Supported by her great-uncle's English friends and disciples she was a great success. The liveliness, personality, and quite un-English attractiveness of the D'Ar&aacute;nyi sisters made them welcome in England, and their associates included Bertrand Russell, as well as Fanny Davies, the pianist pupil of Clara Schumann, and Sir Henry Wood. Kept in Britain by the outbreak of the First World War, they settled down to become a regular part of English musical life, assisted by such friends as Herbert Asquith and A. J. Balfour over any difficulties arising from their nationality. When, after 1919, their international careers could be resumed, England remained their base. Wartime music-making, much of it at private concerts in great houses, turned Adila's attention to chamber music, often with the cellist Guilhermina Suggia.<br>
<br>In November 1915 Adila married Alexander P. Fachiri (<i>d</i>. 1939), an American lawyer of Greek descent, and adopted her husband's name for professional purposes. In 1919 Alexander Fachiri, also an accomplished cellist, took British citizenship and practised in international law. They had one daughter. Of a retiring disposition, Fachiri was never entirely happy for his wife to undertake public recitals. However, following his death on 27 March 1939 she was restored to the concert platform. Her broad, powerful style, responsive and high-spirited but essentially classical, remained unimpaired, and her readiness to tackle new music was as great as it had ever been. She was in demand as a teacher, and although after the Second World War she settled near Florence, she returned from Italy from time to time to play in London, where she was last heard in 1957 playing in Bach's double concerto with her sister. She died in Florence after a short illness on 15 December 1962.<br>
<br>It was customary during the lifetime of the two sisters to contrast the classical style of Adila Fachiri with the more impulsively romantic playing of Jelly D'Ar&aacute;nyi. The two were, however, such frequently and perfectly matched partners in many works of a variety of styles and periods that to hear them together was to realize that, essentially, they were in complete musical sympathy. Gustav Holst dedicated his double violin concerto to them, and the sisters gave its first performance in 1930.<br>
<br>During the 1920s and 1930s, when Adila Fachiri was heard less frequently in public as a soloist, Jelly D'Ar&aacute;nyi combined recitals with concerto performances with major European orchestras and established a reputation in the USA. As well as Bach's unaccompanied violin works she played the concertos of Szymanowski, Respighi, and Vaughan Williams, whose <span class="italic">Concerto accademico</span> was dedicated to her; she also played his <span class="italic">Lark Ascending</span> very frequently. Her recital repertory included Ravel's <span class="italic">Tzigane</span>, perhaps the most important of all the works dedicated to either of the sisters. She played the violin and piano sonatas of Bart&oacute;k, written for her and her sister, and the sonatas of John Ireland, Eugene Goossens, and Richard Strauss. In addition, Jelly was partly responsible for the rediscovery of Schumann's violin concerto, and she first played it to the public in 1938. This concerto, dismissed as an inferior work by Clara Schumann, the composer's widow, had been allowed to become forgotten. What Jelly apparently called a &#145;game&#146; with a wine glass on an improvised ouija board put her on to the track of a work she did not even know existed (the violin concerto was not at that time listed in catalogues of Schumann's compositions). It was found in the composer's manuscripts in the Prussian State Library.<br>
<br>Apart from many appearances with her sister Adila, Jelly formed a close friendship and effective musical partnership with the pianist Myra Hess. In 1933 Jelly suggested and began to carry out a series of charity recitals in English cathedrals. She was appointed CBE in 1946. Jelly joined her sister in Florence after the Second World War; she died there, unmarried, on 30 March 1966.<br>
