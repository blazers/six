<span class="headword">Maas,  Joseph</span>  (1847&#150;1886), <span class="occ">singer</span>, was born on 30 January 1847 at Dartford, Kent, the son of Joseph Maas, descended from an old Dutch family. At the age of ten he became a chorister at Rochester Cathedral, and was soloist there for five years. He studied with the cathedral organist, and with a Mrs Galton, eldest sister of Louisa Bodda-Pyne, who engaged him to sing as a boy treble at her concerts in the provinces. When he left the cathedral he became a clerk in Chatham Dockyard, but continued his musical studies with Louisa Bodda-Pyne in London. In 1869, financed by a Mr Wood of Rochester, he went to Milan, where he had singing lessons for two years under San Giovanni.<br>
<br>In February 1871 Maas replaced Sims Reeves at a concert given by Henry Leslie's choir at London's St James's Hall with great success, and on 29 August 1872 made his stage d&eacute;but at Covent Garden as Prince Babil in Dion Boucicault's <span class="italic">Babil and Bijou</span>. In 1872 he went to the United States as a member of Clara Kellogg's English Opera Company. He returned to England in 1877, and the following year sang Gontrau in the first English performance of Ignaz Br&uuml;ll's <span class="italic">The Golden Cross</span> at the Adelphi Theatre under Carl Rosa. As a result of this he was engaged as principal tenor in the Carl Rosa company. During the three seasons 1878&#150;80 his main roles were the title part in Wagner's <span class="italic">Rienzi</span>, Wilhelm Meister in Ambroise Thomas's <span class="italic">Mignon</span>, and Radames in Verdi's <span class="italic">Aida</span>, all of these being performed in English for the first time. Maas also sang for the Italian Opera at Her Majesty's Theatre in 1880, and in 1883 he made a memorable appearance in Wagner's <span class="italic">Lohengrin</span> at Covent Garden. At the 1884 Norwich festival he performed <span class="italic">Apollo's Invocation</span>, written for him by Massenet, and in May 1885 he created the part of the Chevalier des Grieux in the first London performance of Massenet's <span class="italic">Manon</span> at Drury Lane. He was an indifferent actor, but he had a pure tenor voice, of considerable power and compass, which he managed with ease and feeling.<br>
<br>Maas was popular in the concert room as well as on the stage, and in Handel's oratorios and in English ballads he was almost without a rival. His first oratorio appearance was at the Sacred Harmonic Society in <span class="italic">Messiah</span> on 4 April 1879. He had many engagements in London and the provinces and sang in Paris in 1884 and in Brussels at the Bach and Handel festival in 1885. His last important performance was at the Birmingham festival in 1885, where he sang in the first English performances of Dvo&#345;&aacute;k's <span class="italic">The Spectre's Bride</span> and Stanford's <span class="italic">Three Holy Children</span>.<br>
<br>Maas married Catherine, daughter of J. H. Ball JP, of Stroud, Gloucestershire. They had one daughter. He died of a rheumatic affliction at his home, 21 Marlborough Hill, St John's Wood, London, on 16 January 1886, and was buried at Child's Hill cemetery, West Hampstead. His grave is marked by a marble monument with a carved portrait. A Maas memorial prize was founded in 1887 for the encouragement of tenor singers and is competed for annually at one of the British music colleges in turn.<br>
