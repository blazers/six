<span class="headword">Watson,  John Dawson</span>  (1832&#150;1892), <span class="occ">painter and illustrator</span>, was born on 20 May 1832 in Sedbergh, Yorkshire, the eldest son of Dawson Watson, a wealthy solicitor, and his wife, Mary Bragg. Watson was educated at King Edward VI Grammar School, Sedbergh (1842&#150;7), and at the Manchester School of Design between 1847 and 1851, later studying in the London studio of Alexander Davis Cooper and at the Royal Academy Schools. He returned to Manchester in 1852. His first exhibit was <span class="italic">The Wounded Cavalier</span> at the Manchester Institution in 1851, followed by <span class="italic">An Artist's Studio</span> (which contained portraits of himself, Cooper, and Cooper's family) at the Royal Academy in 1853.<br>
<br>Watson was predominantly a narrative figure painter, who worked in oils and watercolour and also produced very fluent line drawings. In 1856 he sold a number of works to the Liverpool merchant and art collector John Miller; these pictures attracted the attention of the Pre-Raphaelite painter Ford Madox Brown, who invited Watson to exhibit at his house in London. Watson was a member of the literary and artistic Letherbrow Club in Manchester from 1857, and over the next two years contributed twelve papers and numerous pen-and-ink drawings to the club's volumes. On 23 November 1858, at Giggleswick, Yorkshire, he married his cousin, Jane Dawson Edmondson (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1831), the daughter of Christopher Edmondson, solicitor of Settle, Yorkshire, with whom he had two sons and three daughters. His elder son, Dawson Watson, was a pupil of the Royal Academician Mark Fisher.<br>
<br>In 1860 Watson settled in London where, a year later, he was commissioned by Routledge to execute 110 black and white drawings, engraved by the Dalziel brothers, for a new edition of <span class="italic">The Pilgrim's Progress</span>. These were pronounced by the <span class="italic">Art Journal</span> to be of &#145;uniform excellence&#146;  (1861, 46), and made Watson's name in the field of illustration. <span class="italic">Robinson Crusoe</span> followed in 1864 as a companion volume. Illustrations by Watson appeared regularly in <span class="italic">Good Words</span> (1861&#150;3), <span class="italic">London Society</span> (1862&#150;7), <span class="italic">The Graphic</span> (1870&#150;77), and other similar periodicals. He was elected an associate of the Society of Painters in Water Colours in 1864, with full membership in 1869, when he exhibited <span class="italic">Carrying in the Peacock</span>, which the <span class="italic">Art Journal</span> considered &#145;brilliant as Veronese &hellip; Mr. Watson bids fair to become one of our first artists&#146;  (1869, 173). A version of this medieval theme was painted as a fresco for the Surrey home of Birket Foster, who had married Watson's sister, Frances, in 1864. <span class="italic">Raising the Maypole</span> for another room was never finished, although Watson was living near by in the village of Milford from 1865.<br>
<br>Early success was said to have made Watson somewhat lazy, and critics were often disappointed with later work. Certainly he did not fully exploit his talent as a theatrical designer. In 1871 he organized an amateur performance of <span class="italic">Twelfth Night</span> at Newcastle in aid of victims of the Franco-Prussian War, for which he designed and cut out fifty costumes, and in 1872 he executed sixty-five costume designs in watercolour for a professional production of <span class="italic">Henry V</span> at the Princes Theatre, Manchester. Meticulous observation of historical dress was a feature of his work, as in the Elizabethan setting for <span class="italic">The Poisoned Cup</span> (exh. RA, 1866), which was awarded a medal at the Vienna International Exhibition in 1873. Watson also painted portraits and contemporary domestic genre scenes, many examples of which were set in and around Cullercoats, Northumberland, and depicted the local fishing community. <span class="italic">Saved</span>, a sea rescue scene (exh. RA, 1871), achieved exceptional popularity as a print. He was elected an honorary member of the Royal Watercolour Society of Belgium in 1876.<br>
<br>In 1877 Watson returned to London, from Milford, before settling in Conwy, Caernarvonshire, in 1884, where he was a founder member of the Royal Cambrian Academy. He maintained links with Manchester throughout his life, culminating in a retrospective exhibition at the Brazenose Club in 1877. Exhibits included a new oil painting, <span class="italic">The Yeoman's Wedding</span>, which was also shown at the Manchester Jubilee Exhibition that year. Works in public collections include <span class="italic">Sancho Panza</span> at the Victoria and Albert Museum and <span class="italic">Bubbles</span> (a characteristic study of children) at the Cecil Higgins Gallery, Bedford. There are examples in Manchester City Galleries and holdings at Conwy, Birmingham, Liverpool, Newcastle, Norwich, and Worcester. More than sixty of Watson's works remain, many on public view, at the Castle Hotel, Conwy, together with a bust of Watson by Edward E. Geflowski.<br>
<br>Watson was regarded as a kind, liberal-minded man and had many interests, including riding to hounds and amateur theatricals. He died at his home, Plas Uchaf, Lancaster Square, Conwy, on 3 January 1892 of a respiratory complaint and was buried on the 7th of that month at St Agnes cemetery, Conwy.<br>
