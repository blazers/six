<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Greenway,  Charles</span>, first Baron Greenway  (1857&#150;1934), <span class="occ">oil industrialist and merchant</span>, was born in Taunton on 13 June 1857, the only son of the three children of John David Greenway, a draper, and his wife, Lucy Emily Wiffen, of Essex. He was educated at Taunton, and after working for a London cotton trader, in 1876 he joined the London branch of a Calcutta-based mercantile company headed by (Charles) William Wallace.<br>
<br>In 1883 Greenway married Mabel Tower of Caterham, a solicitor's daughter; they had a son and two daughters. Two years later, he moved to India to take a post with the merchants Ralli Brothers. Then in 1893 Wallace, back in Britain, invited Greenway to join the Calcutta office of what had become Shaw, Wallace &amp; Co. Since 1891 Shaw Wallace had been marketing agent in the subcontinent for the kerosene of the Burmah Oil Company, and when Greenway joined them he immersed himself mainly in the oil side of this prosperous firm; later he became senior partner. Thanks to his energy and commercial acumen, Greenway rapidly built up Burmah Oil's trade throughout India, the largest single market in the eastern hemisphere outside Europe. This success aroused very determined opposition from larger rivals, especially Royal Dutch&#150;Shell's marketing subsidiary in the East, the Asiatic Petroleum Company. After a prolonged price war, in 1905 Burmah Oil reached a market-sharing agreement with Asiatic; yet by the time Greenway left India three years later, Burmah Oil was supplying nearly half the kerosene marketed there.<br>
<br>Wallace called Greenway home for a far more demanding assignment. In May 1908, extensive oil deposits had been discovered in Persia. Under the shah's original concession, granted in 1901 to William Knox D'Arcy and later taken over by a syndicate including Burmah Oil, a separate company had to be set up. As the only executive director of Burmah Oil in London, Wallace bore the main burden of launching that company, and needed Greenway's immediate help. Greenway proved to be resourceful over large and small matters alike, even borrowing furniture from Wallace's firm for the new offices. In April 1909 the Anglo-Persian Oil Company (from 1954 the British Petroleum Company) was floated in London, to considerable popular interest. With the great imperial figure of Donald Smith, Baron Strathcona and Mount Royal, as part-time chairman, Wallace took charge as managing director, and Greenway became his executive assistant with a seat on the board. In 1910 Wallace handed over the managing directorship to Greenway, who thus had the major responsibility (as vice-chairman under Wallace) for technical and financial matters. Two years later John Cargill, the chairman of Burmah Oil (which was Anglo-Persian's largest shareholder) became alarmed at Greenway's resolve to bid for a concession in neighbouring Mesopotamia (later Iraq), because there were already problems over pipeline-laying and refining in Persia, and the marketing of refined products. Cargill therefore refused to authorize further funds for Anglo-Persian and Greenway at once turned for assistance to the British government. The subsequent period, during which he carried out many arduous negotiations in Whitehall, took Greenway to the brink of exhaustion, but it ended successfully in two agreements signed in May 1914. The first lord of the Admiralty, Winston Churchill, was anxious to obtain a secure source of fuel oil for the navy at a time when there were no substantial oil deposits in the British empire, except in remote Burma. The Treasury thus acquired a 51 per cent stake in Anglo-Persian, while the Admiralty signed a contract to purchase large quantities of fuel oil over the next twenty years.<br>
<br>Greenway became chairman of Anglo-Persian in 1914 but continued as managing director until 1919. It was very largely his initiatives that converted the company from merely a producer in Persia into a vertically integrated oil major, capable of taking its place in the world league. Between 1914 and 1918 he planned systematically to this end. Most importantly, he laid the foundations of a fully-fledged selling organization by acquiring in 1917 the British Petroleum Company, the marketing subsidiary of a recently expropriated German company. He also placed orders with British shipyards for a fleet of tankers, to escape from Shell's domination of the tanker-chartering market. Longer-term plans included the building of a refinery in Britain, at Llandarcy, near Swansea; this was completed in 1921.<br>
<br>Greenway received a baronetcy in recognition of his public services in 1919, and thereafter he continued to extend Anglo-Persian's activities world-wide. He set in motion exploration projects in many parts of the world, and established oil-bunkering stations on the principal sea routes as well as marketing organizations in most European countries. Recognizing that future developments required the expertise of scientifically trained top management, in 1921 he recruited as technical adviser Sir John Cadman, a distinguished professor and government scientific adviser, who had been chairman of the petroleum executive and of the inter-allied petroleum conference during the First World War. Cadman later became deputy chairman of Anglo-Persian, and was chairman designate when Greenway retired in 1927. In recognition of his signal achievements, a barony, named for Stanbridge Earls, Greenway's Hampshire country home, was bestowed on him in that year. In retirement Greenway took no part in public affairs but enthusiastically pursued a range of leisure activities. He enjoyed entertaining on a generous scale. As well as riding and shooting, he played golf on his private course and fished in the River Test.<br>
<br>Greenway's most marked attribute was an exuberance of spirit, which invigorated not only himself but also those aides striving with him for the latest objective. He set himself practical goals, which more often than not he achieved through persistence. He never flinched from the company's tussles with commercial rivals, and particularly with Shell, which, quite as pertinaciously, had striven to clip the wings of the fledgeling Anglo-Persian. Greenway was a past master at playing the patriotic card and whenever public figures accused Shell of being unpatriotic and mercenary, that company suspected his malign influence. Since Greenway had no scruples about denigrating rivals in Whitehall circles, those rivals not unexpectedly denigrated him before a wider world. Henri Deterding of Royal Dutch&#150;Shell declared that Greenway would never have got anywhere near the top of a major corporation but for the backing of the British government.<br>
<br>The American radical author Upton Sinclair, in <span class="italic">Oil!</span> (1927), characterized Greenway as &#145;Old Spats and Monocle&#146;; yet in essence he was a tough merchant adventurer. Indeed, no establishment figure could have matched Greenway's almost single-handed achievements in preserving the independence of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company and transforming it into a corporation that dominated oil production in the Middle East until the end of the Second World War. Greenway died on 17 December 1934 at Stanbridge Earls.<br>
