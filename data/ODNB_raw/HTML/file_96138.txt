<span class="headword">Mill,  Robert Duguid Forrest  Pring-</span>  (1924&#150;2005), <span class="occ">scholar of Catalan, Spanish, and Latin American literature</span>, was born on 11 September 1924 at Talbot House, Stapleford Tawney, Essex, the son of Captain (later Major) Richard Pring-Mill, an officer in the Royal Field Artillery, and his wife, Nellie Morton Turner, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Duguid. He was educated at the Jesuit school of Montesi&oacute;n, Palma de Mallorca, before enlisting in 1941 and serving in the Far East as an intelligence officer in the Black Watch, rising to the rank of captain and being mentioned in dispatches. His first published work, improbably in view of what he would go on to achieve, was entitled <span class="italic">Chinese Triad Societies</span> (1946), and arose out of his post-war military service. He was demobilized in 1947 and graduated with a first-class degree in modern languages (French and Spanish) from New College, Oxford, in 1949. A visit to South America earlier that year under the auspices of Sir Eugen Millington-Drake kindled a lifelong interest in the continent. In 1950 he was elected to a senior demyship at Magdalen College, Oxford, and on 19 August the same year, at the Roman Catholic chapel of Our Lady and St Paulinus, Dewsbury, married (Maria) Brigitte Heinsheimer, a 28-year-old undergraduate, and daughter of Ludwig Heinsheimer; they had a son, Francis, and a daughter, Monica. He was appointed university lecturer in Spanish in the University of Oxford in 1952, from which post he retired in 1988. He was simultaneously a lecturer at New College (1956&#150;88) and Exeter College (1963&#150;81), and tutor at St Catherine's College (1965&#150;88). He was a fellow of St Catherine's College until his death.<br>
<br>Pring-Mill was one of the most distinguished British Hispanists of his generation, with an unusually wide range of interests, reflected in a series of published works that achieved international critical recognition. His fascination with interlocking patterns of language and ideas found particular expression in his work on medieval Catalan and golden age Spanish literature. His interest in the medieval Catalan polymath Ram&oacute;n Llull was sustained throughout his working life; his earlier studies, for which he was awarded the Premi Cr&iacute;tica &#145;serra d'or&#146; de Recerca (Barcelona), were collected in <span class="italic">Estudis sobre Ram&oacute;n Llull (1956&#150;78)</span> in 1992. Golden age Spanish drama also claimed his attention from an early stage. His introduction to Jill Booty's translation of five plays by Lope de Vega (1961) proved very influential, while his extensive writing on Calder&oacute;n culminated in his <span class="italic">Calder&oacute;n: estructura y ejemplaridad</span> (2001). His fascination with the intellectual currents of golden age poetry and prose, especially <i>conceptismo</i>, led to other important articles.<br>
<br>Pring-Mill was also closely involved in the study of Latin American literature. He was instrumental in bringing the Chilean poet Pablo Neruda to Oxford in 1965 to be awarded a DLitt. He was proud that for some years Neruda, who would go on to win the Nobel prize for literature in 1971, was the only living author studied in a major paper in the final honour school of modern languages in Oxford. Pring-Mill's epic, year-long journey across the Americas in 1967, from Montreal to Puerto Montt, which Brigitte and their children shared in part, brought him new contacts with emerging trends in Latin American culture, most notably the poetry of the Nicaraguan Ernesto Cardenal, with whom he worked on the Solentiname islands in Lake Nicaragua in 1972, and of whose work he published editions, translations, and pioneering studies. Cardenal was minister of culture in the Sandinista government from 1979 to 1987, which brought Pring-Mill into contact with liberation theology (of which, as a practising Roman Catholic, he approved) and political revolutionary movements in Latin America (about which he became more sceptical). He also acquired a deep interest in the protest poetry and songs arising out of the political ferment of the continent, and devoted considerable scholarly attention to these. But it is probably for his work on Neruda, as editor, translator, and commentator, that he was best known. His <span class="italic">Pablo Neruda: a Basic Anthology</span> (1975) quickly established itself as a standard work. He left his substantial collection of recorded and published material concerning protest poetry to the Institute of Popular Music at Liverpool University, and a significant archive of material relating to Neruda to the Taylor Institution in Oxford.<br>
<br>Pring-Mill served as president of the Anglo-Catalan Society from 1973 to 1976. He was made an Oxford DLitt in 1986, and elected a fellow of the British Academy two years later. His work was recognized abroad in a series of honours and prizes: he became a corresponding member of the Institut d'Estudis Catalans in 1966 and of the Reial Acad&egrave;mia de Bones Lletres, Barcelona, in 2002. He was awarded the Premi Pompeu Fabra (1956) and the Premi Catal&ograve;nia (1991). He received the Creu de San Jordi from the Generalitat de Catalunya in 1990, and the same year was made a Comendador de la Orden de Isabel la Cat&oacute;lica by the Spanish government. The Chilean government honoured him twice, as an officer of the order of Bernardo O'Higgins in 1992, and with the Medalla Presidencial de Honor in 2004.<br>
<br>Alongside his many contributions to scholarship, and in no sense for him less important or deserving of his full attention, was Pring-Mill's commitment to the teaching of undergraduates. As an assiduous and devoted tutor he won the respect and affection of generations of them. He was a man of innate courtesy and deep charity, and possessed a real gift for sustaining friendships, most memorably through the generous hospitality he and Brigitte provided in their home. Having lived latterly in Brill, Buckinghamshire, he died at the John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, on 6 October 2005, following an internal haemorrhage brought on by a duodenal ulcer. He was survived by his wife, Brigitte, and their two children.<br>
