<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Taylor,  Alma Louise</span>  (1895&#150;1974), <span class="occ">film actress</span>, was born in Peckham, London, on 3 January 1895, the eldest of three children of John Harry Taylor (<i>b</i>. 1853), a metal broker, and Kate Caroline, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Harvey (<i>b</i>. 1870). She grew up in Sunbury-on-Thames, Surrey, and in 1907, aged twelve, started appearing as an extra in films made at the studios of the Hepworth Manufacturing Company Ltd in neighbouring Walton-on-Thames. Thus began an association with the film-maker Cecil Hepworth that would last for nearly twenty years.<br>
<br>In 1910 Hepworth cast Taylor in one of the lead roles in his popular long-running (1910&#150;15) <span class="roman">Tilly the Tomboy</span> series of short films, in which Taylor and her co-star Chrissie White (1895&#150;1989) played a pair of rebellious teenage girls who created inappropriate and often violent mayhem in a variety of genteel social situations. Taylor starred in forty feature-length films for Hepworth between 1912 and 1924, of which her most famous was undoubtedly a 1916 adaptation of Helen Mathers's pastoral melodrama <span class="italic">Comin' Thro' the Rye</span>.<br>
<br>Hepworth's was the first studio in Britain to imitate the burgeoning American practice of promoting film actors as recognisable celebrities. Taylor was not the first of Hepworth's employees to receive this treatment, but, after he started publicizing her name in advertisements for his films from 1912 onwards, she quickly became established as the studio's leading performer. Various polls conducted by fan magazines and newspapers confirm that Taylor was the best-known and most popular film star in silent British cinema over a formative ten-year period, from 1914 to 1924. In July 1915 the weekly publication <span class="italic">Pictures and the Picturegoer</span> published the results of a poll designed to assess which British-born film actors were most popular among its readers, and Taylor was placed first, ahead of Charlie Chaplin (then in the second year of his screen career). In April 1916 another fan magazine, <span class="italic">Picture Palace News</span>, conducted a poll which asked readers to vote for their favourite female film star, European or American. Taylor came third in this popularity contest with 142,571 votes, behind the Hollywood stars Mary Fuller (142,635 votes) and Mary Pickford (185,910).<br>
<br>At the height of her career Taylor was occasionally described as the &#145;English Mary Pickford&#146;, but the publicity campaigns contrived by Hepworth's press agents sought to create a star image which was markedly distinct from that of her transatlantic rivals. The first generation of American film actresses regularly endorsed fashion and beauty products, and public fascination centred on their avowed preferences in clothes and men. By contrast publicity features on Alma Taylor portrayed her as a woman without earthly desires and certainly no interest in clothes or shopping. Her image as a uniquely homely and chaste star clearly struck a chord with many British filmgoers. One female fan wrote in to <span class="italic">Pictures and the Picturegoer</span> in September 1918 to describe a chance personal encounter with her idol in Sunbury, and noted with approval that Taylor was as unostentatiously dressed off-screen as she was wont to appear in front of the cameras, wearing a &#145;simple cotton costume&#146; and appearing every inch &#145;the embodiment of charming, unspoilt, British girlhood&#146;  (Tremayne, 301). British film fans of the time occasionally complained that Taylor lacked glamour in her appearance and vigour in her performances. Her popularity was certainly culturally specific: she enjoyed little fame overseas, and, unlike several of her British contemporaries, made no attempt to launch a career in Hollywood.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">Comin' Thro' the Rye</span> had been so successful that Hepworth remade it, with Taylor once again in the starring role, in 1923. In April 1924 the <span class="italic">Daily News</span> published the results of a new readers' poll measuring the relative popularity of British film stars, and Taylor was still placed in first position, which she jointly shared with a relative newcomer, Betty Balfour (1903&#150;1977). However, 1923/4 marked a negative turning point in her career. The <span class="italic">Comin' Thro' the Rye</span> remake was not the box office success that Hepworth had anticipated and desperately needed, and, following a disastrous public flotation which was supposed to provide the funding for a major expansion of the studios, his company entered voluntary liquidation in 1924. Between 1924 and 1928 Taylor was cast as the star in four more feature films, all made at different studios for different directors, and also made her d&eacute;but as an actress on the legitimate stage. But her appeal proved to be intimately wedded to the Hepworth film-making style and publicity machine, and before the silent era ended she was demoted to the status of a supporting player. She appeared in minor roles in five early sound films before officially retiring from film acting following her marriage, on 2 June 1936, to Major Leonard Avery (1869&#150;1953). Her husband, the Australian-born son of James Watts Grimes, pastoralist, had changed his name by deed poll, and was the divorced husband of Helen May, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Reeves. He had qualified in medicine, and served as an army medical officer in the South African War, when he devised a horse-drawn ambulance, and in the First World War in the Middle East. In 1928 he was a member of the British Colonial Film Company's expedition to Kenya and Tanganyika.<br>
<br>After her husband's death, Taylor returned to the film industry, accepting uncredited work as an extra on several films and television productions. Poignantly one of these films, <span class="italic">Stock Car</span> (1955), was made at Nettlefold, which was formerly Hepworth's old studio at Walton. Taylor's last-known screen appearance was in <span class="italic">A Night to Remember</span> in 1958. She died at her home, 38 Carlton Drive, Putney, London, on 23 January 1974. Sixteen films from her silent era heyday are known to have survived.<br>
