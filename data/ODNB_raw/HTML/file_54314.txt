<span class="headword">Euphemia</span> <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Euphemia Ross]</span>  (<em>b. </em>in or before 1329?, <em>d.</em> 1388/9), <span class="occ">queen of Scots, consort of Robert II</span>, was the daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/54310/', "Hugh Ross, fourth earl of Ross (d. 1333)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/54308/', "Ross family")</script>], and his second wife, Margaret Graham, and was possibly one of the children born before her parents obtained a retrospective papal legitimation of their marriage in November 1329. She married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/23119/', "John Randolph, third earl of Moray")</script>, who was killed at the battle of Nevilles Cross in 1346. She remained unmarried for almost a decade, until in 1355 a papal dispensation, styling her countess of Moray and widow of John Randolph, was granted for her marriage to Robert the Steward (1316&#150;1390). Euphemia's property rights as the widow of the earl of Moray probably allowed the Steward to claim control of the former Randolph lordship of Badenoch, while the marriage also served to cement Robert's relationship with Euphemia's brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/54311/', "William Ross, fifth earl of Ross")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/54308/', "Ross family (per. c.1215&#150;c.1415)")</script>].<br>
<br>On 22 February 1371 Euphemia's husband succeeded to the Scottish throne as <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/23713/', "Robert II")</script>. Although she was recognized and styled as queen from the moment of his succession, her formal coronation took place much later than the new king's. Whereas Robert was crowned on 27 March 1371, Walter Bower's <span class="italic">Scotichronicon</span> suggests that Euphemia's coronation occurred between 6 December 1372 and 24 March 1373, in a service conducted at Scone by Alexander Kininmund, bishop of Aberdeen. The delay may have been caused by some uncertainty about the status of David II's recently divorced queen, Margaret Logie, who had set out to the papal court in 1372 in order to protest against her exclusion from her rights as queen of Scots. Scottish clergymen, in particular, may have been unwilling to conduct a ceremony which created a new queen of Scots and pre-empted papal judgement on the issue. Euphemia does not appear in any contemporary accounts as an active or influential figure in the life of the kingdom, and this may partly reflect the transfer of Robert II's affections to his long-term mistress, Mariota Cardeny, a relationship which was openly acknowledged as early as March 1372.<br>
<br>The marriage of Euphemia and Robert produced two sons, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/54325/', "David Stewart")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26512/', "Walter Stewart")</script>, but the king's nearest male heirs were the three sons of his first wife, Elizabeth Mure: John (the future Robert III), Robert, and Alexander. The place of David and Walter in the royal succession was detailed in an entail of 4 April 1373, which stipulated that only after the failure of the male lines descending from the three sons of Robert II and Elizabeth Mure could they or their male heirs succeed to the throne. Perhaps it is significant that Euphemia was not crowned queen until shortly before the entailing of the royal title. Euphemia's sons were, however, the beneficiaries of substantial royal patronage after 1371. David became earl of Strathearn and Caithness and lord of Urquhart before his death (1386?). All three titles may have been acquired by David partly through his mother's rights as a kinswoman of Malise, eighth earl of Strathearn and Caithness, and as the widow of John Randolph. Euphemia's second son, Walter, married the heiress to the lordship of Brechin in 1378 and went on to obtain the earldoms of Atholl and Caithness early in the fifteenth century. In March 1437 Walter was executed for his involvement in the assassination of his nephew, James I.<br>
<br>Euphemia and Robert II also had at least two daughters, Egidia and Elizabeth. Egidia was married about 1388 to William Douglas of Nithsdale, an illegitimate son of Archibald Douglas, third earl of Douglas and lord of Galloway; William was killed in 1391 in a quarrel with English knights at K&ouml;nigsberg, during preparations for an expedition against the pagan Lithuanians. A dispensation for Elizabeth's marriage to David Lindsay, lord of Glen Esk (created earl of Crawford in 1398), was obtained in 1375 and the couple were married before 1384.<br>
<br>In an addition to a fifteenth-century manuscript of Bower's <span class="italic">Scotichronicon</span>, Euphemia is said to have died on 20 February 1388 and to have been buried in Dunfermline Abbey. The intended date may be 20 February 1389, as she was apparently alive on 19 June 1388, but dead by 23 February 1389. A conventional and stylized representation of her as queen is to be found on a seal dating from 1375, which depicts her standing between the arms of the Scottish kingdom and those of the earldom of Ross.<br>
