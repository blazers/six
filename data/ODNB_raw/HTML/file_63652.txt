<span class="headword">Agar,  Charles</span>, first earl of Normanton  (1736&#150;1809), <span class="occ">Church of Ireland archbishop of Dublin</span>, the third son of Henry Agar, MP for Gowran, co. Kilkenny, Ireland, and Anne Ellis, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8714/', "Welbore Ellis (1661/2&#150;1734)")</script>, bishop of Meath, and Diana Briscoe, was born on 22 December 1736 at Gowran Castle, co. Kilkenny. He was educated at Westminster School (1747&#150;1755?) and Christ Church, Oxford, where he graduated BA in 1759, MA in 1762, and DCL in 1765. In 1763 he was appointed chaplain to the duke of Northumberland, lord lieutenant of Ireland. This was a sure path to preferment and Agar became rector of Ballymagarvey and Skryne, in the diocese of Meath, in the same year. He was successively rector of Annagh, in the diocese of Kilmore (1765&#150;6), and dean of Kilmore (1765&#150;8), and was consecrated bishop of Cloyne in 1768. In 1774 he wondered why, in view of his consistent support for the administration, he had not been offered the archbishopric of Tuam, although he candidly admitted that it was not his preference. Four years later he assured the viceroy, Buckinghamshire, of his devotion to his majesty's business in Ireland and clearly hoped to succeed the dying archbishop of Dublin. He was disappointed in this, partly, in his view, because of bad relations with the archbishop of Armagh, and was given the archbishopric of Cashel, to the considerable dissatisfaction of his family and connections. On 22 November 1776 he married Jane Benson (1751/2&#150;1826), eldest daughter of William Benson of co. Down and Frances Macartney-Porteous. They had three sons and one daughter.<br>
<br>In late eighteenth-century Ireland, when patronage and political connections counted for much, and government management of Irish affairs called for considerable skill, Agar was well placed to receive recognition, and he relentlessly pursued his political and ecclesiastical ambitions. He was described by one contemporary as &#145;very active in business, a good speaker, and very ambitious of being employed by government as minister in the house of lords&#146;  (G. O. Sayles, ed., &#145;Contemporary sketches of the members of the Irish parliament of 1782&#146;, <span class="italic">Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy</span>, 56/ 3c, 1954, 273). Through family and other connections (his brother James, Viscount Clifden, alone controlled four borough seats), he was a power to be reckoned with, and when Edmund Sexten Pery, speaker of the Irish Commons and one of his family connections, sought Agar's support in obtaining a bishopric in 1780 (secured in 1781) for his brother William Cecil he was solemnly assured that his and the candidate's dependability as &#145;the sincere and steady friend of administration&#146; was crucial  (<span class="italic">Buckinghamshire MSS</span>, 160&#150;62). Yet Agar himself was forced briefly into opposition during the regency crisis mainly because of the English whig connections of his maternal uncle and mentor Welbore Ellis (later first Lord Mendip). He soon returned to his allegiance, being described by one modern historian as &#145;one of the fastest movers throughout the crisis&#146;  (McDowell, 342). Although never a major political figure such as Boulter or Stone, he was a prominent member of the &#145;Irish cabinet&#146; of the 1780s and 1790s, and was a formidable draftsman of legislation and parliamentary speaker. His standing in the House of Lords was such that he was able both to carry and defeat measures there, occasionally against the wishes of government, and came nearly top of the ballots for the secret committees of 1793, 1797, and 1798, set up to inquire into the United Irishmen and the causes of the unrest that foreshadowed the rising in 1798.<br>
<br>Agar's experience of agrarian agitation in the Munster dioceses of Cloyne and Cashel, particularly the Rightboy resistance to the payment of tithes to the established Church of Ireland, convinced him of the vulnerability of that church, which played a vital role in maintaining the constitution, and informed his opposition to Catholic relief, which he believed would undermine the principle of protestant ascendancy. His opposition to concessions to Catholics and dissenters was strongly felt, yet not expressed to the point of defeating government relief measures. In 1780 he protested against the bill to relieve dissenters of the sacramental test as making a material alteration in the constitution, but his most trenchant criticism was reserved for the Catholic relief bills of 1782, 1792, and 1793. The Catholic promoters of relief understandably regarded Agar as adamantly opposed to their cause, given his uncharacteristically tactless and ill-considered reference to Catholicism as &#145;a religion for knaves and fools&#146;  (<span class="italic">Report &hellip; on the Roman Catholic Bill</span>, 245), a remark that drew a rebuke from Lord Donoughmore. Despite commenting that the 1793 bill, by extending the parliamentary franchise to Catholics, would concede too much, Agar reluctantly voted for the measure because it had been framed by &#145;his majesty's ministers in this country&#146;  (<span class="italic">A Full and Accurate Report</span>, 384&#150;5). His loyalty was rewarded by his creation in 1795 as Baron Somerton.<br>
<br>Agar's temperament responded freely to the rebellion of 1798, and in the face of those politicians and others who advocated a degree of leniency towards the insurgents and their leaders&#151;for example, through their preference for transportation rather than execution&#151;he pressed for the death penalty as a surer deterrent. In the matter of the proposed union of Ireland with Great Britain in the aftermath of the rebellion he showed himself more open to negotiation, and his behaviour during the immediate pre-union period provides an example of his capacity to extract the maximum reward from government for his services. The distribution of honours that paved the way for the passing of the <span class="roman">Act of Union</span> presented him with a fresh opportunity for promotion in the church. He had misgivings about the measure, partly because he believed that the position of the established Church of Ireland was not secured thereby; he was proved right in this, for disestablishment came within seventy years. He also criticized the provision whereby the Irish spiritual peers would be represented at Westminster by one archbishop and three bishops, the archbishops taking their turn. In Agar's view the four archbishops alone would have provided the appropriate representation. He gave way, persuaded by his advancement from baron to Viscount Somerton in 1800, and his election as one of the original twenty-eight Irish representative peers, which secured him a seat for life, as well as by confirmation from government that the archbishopric of Dublin might soon come his way, which it did in the following year. His ambitions for Armagh were not given official encouragement as the crown had since 1701 passed over Irish-born prelates for that office. Nor did his ambitions end there, and in 1806 he received the earldom of Normanton. Not, as his wife explained, that he &#145;is a flight of stairs above it in his own person already&#146; but &#145;for his dear son's advantage&#146;  (M. MacDonagh, <span class="italic">The Viceroy's Post-Bag</span>, 1904, 207&#150;8).<br>
<br>Agar was a friend of the equally career-conscious John Hely-Hutchinson, provost of Trinity College, Dublin, who had strong views on the improvement of Irish education, and some correspondence between them would suggest that Agar held thoughtful views on the subject, such as raising the age of entry to the college, and bringing masters from leading English schools to enhance those in Ireland. He served on a government commission of inquiry into Irish education, established in 1806, but to judge from the minutes he neither attended nor contributed much. More notable was the great wealth that he accumulated, partly, it was incorrectly claimed by his critics, by a tendency to treat episcopal property as his own. His fortune was divided between the English and Irish Funds, and he had cash in the Bank of Ireland (often called the National Bank) and some bank stock.<br>
<br>Agar died on 14 July 1809 at his home in Great Cumberland Place, London, and was buried on 21 July in Westminster Abbey, where an immodest but accurate inscription on his monument credits him with the building of at least seventeen churches and twenty-two glebe houses, and with the framing of eighteen acts of parliament for regulating and supporting the Church of Ireland. He is also credited with instigating the completion (apart from the spire) of the new cathedral at Cashel which had been founded in the 1750s to replace the medieval edifice on the Rock and had languished ever since. He paid part of the cost of building it out of his own personal resources, and donated to it what was then one of the best organs that money could buy. To him was also attributed the high standard of music at the cathedral and in the metropolitical province of Cashel generally. His widow died on 25 October 1826, aged seventy-four, at 13 Montague Square, and was buried with him in Westminster Abbey.<br>
