<span class="headword">Cooke,  William</span>  (1709&#150;1780), <span class="occ">antiquary and numismatist</span>, was born at Barnard Castle in co. Durham on 16 August 1709, the eldest son of John Cooke (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1714), apothecary and surgeon there, and citizen and member of the Barber&#150;Surgeons' Company of London. In 1719 Cooke's mother, Lucy, obtained his admission to Christ's Hospital whence he proceeded as a Moses exhibitioner to Pembroke College, Cambridge, in June 1726. In 1730 he graduated BA and in 1733 MA, taking orders as a priest in 1731. He was instituted to the living of Enford, Wiltshire, in 1733, and held it until his death. He was also rector of Oldbury on the Hill and Didmarton, Gloucestershire, and by 1754 had been appointed chaplain to the earl of Suffolk.<br>
<br>Cooke's first publication, which came out in 1746, was a translation of the works of Sallust, with a life of the historian and a summary account of the relevant period of Roman history. In 1752 he was incorporated a member of St Mary Hall, Oxford, and in 1754 his <span class="italic">Enquiry into the Patriarchal and Druidical Religion, Temples, &amp;c.</span>, appeared, arguing for the close kinship of the Hebrews and ancient British, on the basis of archaeological, religious, and cultural similarities, as well as such feats of comparative philology as seeing &#145;Hartlepool&#146; as &#145;a manifest corruption of <i>Heracleopolis</i>&#146; and deriving the Welsh toponym element <i>aber</i>- from Apher, the companion of Hercules. The book, which drew upon the works of Stukeley for its data and those of John Hutchinson for its spirit, fitted into a well defined eighteenth-century category of erudite, druid-inspired fantasies. A second, revised edition appeared in 1755. A desire to reconcile classical mythology with Christian reason also led him, about 1760, to undertake a revised edition of Samuel Boyse's <span class="italic">New Pantheon</span>, which he described as a work intending to divest heathen theology of &#145;the Marvellous&#146;. Further editions came out until the seventh and last in 1777.<br>
<br>Cooke died at Enford on 25 February 1780. For some time previously he had suffered from ill health, but managed to complete and send to press a laborious numismatic work, which was corrected and published by his son in two volumes in 1781 as <span class="italic">The Medallic History of Imperial Rome</span>. Prefaced by a lengthy list of subscribers, it applies coins to the illustration of Roman history and the lives of the emperors. The plan of the book is good but the engravings very poor, and most of the coins seem to have been previously published in other works. The name of Cooke's wife is not known; his son William matriculated from New College, Oxford, in 1765, aged nineteen, and graduated BA in 1768.<br>
