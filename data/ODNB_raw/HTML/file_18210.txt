<span class="headword">Martin, Sir  Samuel</span>  (1801&#150;1883), <span class="occ">judge</span>, was the son of Samuel Martin of Culmore, Newtownlimavady, co. Londonderry. He graduated BA at Trinity College, Dublin, in 1821 (MA in 1832) and received an honorary LLD on 2 September 1857. In May 1821 he entered Gray's Inn, and in 1826 the Middle Temple, where he was called to the bar on 29 January 1830, after practising for the previous two years as a special pleader. He was a pupil of Sir Frederick Pollock, afterwards lord chief baron of the exchequer, and subsequently became close friends with him on the northern circuit, where he rapidly acquired an extensive commercial practice. In Easter term 1843 Martin was made queen's counsel, and on 28 August 1838 he married Frances (Fanny) Homera (<i>d</i>. 1874), eldest daughter of Sir Frederick Pollock. They had one daughter, Frances Arabella, (<i>d</i>. 1903), who later married Sir Edward Macnaghten.<br>
<br>In 1847 Martin entered parliament as Liberal MP for Pontefract, and made his maiden speech on the <span class="roman">Crown and Government Security Bill</span> of 1848. On 6 November 1850 he succeeded Baron Rolfe in the court of exchequer. He was created serjeant-at-law the following day, and was knighted on 13 November. He was a judge of unusual strength. Though adept in the refinements of special pleading and the intricate procedure of the time, he was not a pedantic stickler for forms, and tried to prevent their being used unfairly. His knowledge of business and quick mastery of the essential points made his judgments terse and precise. As a criminal judge he did not shrink from imposing heavy sentences, but his natural kindness often led him to find mitigation. Increasing deafness led Martin to retire early from the bench on 26 January 1874. On 2 February he took the privy council oath but his deafness meant he took no part in the proceedings of the judicial committee.<br>
<br>Martin was a keen horseman and was said to have been a good judge of horses; in 1874 he was elected an honorary member of the Jockey Club. He died at his rooms, 132 Piccadilly, on 9 January 1883.<br>
