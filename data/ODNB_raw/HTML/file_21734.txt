<span class="headword">Pechell, Sir  George Richard  Brooke</span>, fourth baronet  (1789&#150;1860), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, was born in London on 30 June 1789. He was the second son of Major-General Sir Thomas Brooke Pechell, second baronet (1753&#150;1826), MP for Downton, Wiltshire, and his wife, Charlotte (<i>d</i>. 1841), second daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5553/', "Lieutenant-General Sir John Clavering")</script>. He was the younger brother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21736/', "Sir Samuel John Brooke Pechell")</script>. Pechell entered the navy in 1803, served in the <i>Triumph</i> in the fleet off Toulon under Nelson in 1804, and afterwards in the <i>Medusa</i>, at the capture of the Spanish treasureships off Cape St Mary on 5 October. In 1806 he was in the <i>Revenge</i> off Brest and Rochfort, and in 1809 in the <i>Barfleur</i> in the Tagus. On 25 June 1810 he was promoted lieutenant of the <i>Caesar</i>, from which he was moved in 1811 to the <i>Macedonian</i>, and in 1812 to the <i>San Domingo</i>, commanded by his brother, and flagship of his uncle, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28779/', "Sir John Borlase Warren")</script>, on the North American station. By Warren he was appointed to the acting command of the brig <i>Colibri</i>, and afterwards of the <i>Recruit</i>, in both of which he cruised with some success on the coast of North America. On 30 May 1814 he was promoted commander, and in May 1818 commissioned the brig-sloop <i>Belette</i> (18 guns) for the Halifax station, where he enforced the treaty stipulations on the fisheries.<br>
<br>In October 1820 Pechell was appointed by Rear-Admiral Griffith to the command of the frigate <i>Tamar</i> which, being very sickly, had come north from Jamaica, and had lost her captain and a large proportion of her officers and men. The commander-in-chief on the Jamaica station, however, claimed the vacancy, and the matter being referred to the Admiralty, all the promotions were disallowed, and Pechell returned to the <i>Belette</i>. While in the <i>Tamar</i> he had obtained the authority of the Haitian government for stopping piracy by vessels claiming to be Haitian, and for searching all suspected vessels. He captured a large brigantine, with a crew of ninety-eight men, and forged commissions from different South American states. On 26 December 1822 Pechell was promoted captain.<br>
<br>Pechell married, on 1 August 1826, Katherine Annabella Bisshopp (<i>d</i>. 1871), daughter and coheir of the twelfth Lord de la Zouche; they had one son and two daughters. In July 1830 he was nominated gentleman usher of the privy chamber, and in April 1831 became equerry to Queen Adelaide. From January 1835 until his death he was whig MP for Brighton, taking an active part in public affairs, and especially in questions relating to the navy, mercantile marine, and fisheries. He favoured vote by ballot and a system of national education for all sects, and voted against church rates. On the death of his brother, on 3 November 1849, he succeeded to the baronetcy, and took the additional surname of Brooke. He became a rear-admiral on the retired list on 17 December 1852, and vice-admiral on 5 January 1858. He died at his house, 27 Hill Street, Berkeley Square, London, on 29 June 1860. As his son had predeceased him, the baronetcy passed to his cousin, George Samuel Pechell.<br>
