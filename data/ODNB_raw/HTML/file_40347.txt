<span class="headword">Milne, Sir  David</span>  (1896&#150;1972), <span class="occ">civil servant</span>, was born at 14 Comely Bank, Edinburgh, on 11 March 1896, the son of David Munro Milne, a Church of Scotland minister, and his wife, Jane Mackay. He attended Daniel Stewart's College, Edinburgh, where he excelled as a pupil, becoming dux and gold medallist. He then entered Edinburgh University, but when the First World War intervened he took a commission in the 9th Royal Scots, being wounded while serving with the 51st Highland division in France. On demobilization in 1919 he returned to Edinburgh, where he gained a first-class MA degree in classics and the John Welsh and Vans Dunlop scholarships. In 1921 he entered the Scottish Office, then based in London, as an assistant principal. He married on 23 August 1928 at the High Pavement Chapel, Nottingham, Maud Winifrede Mary Greg Kilroy (<i>b</i>. 1901/2), the daughter of Lancelot Kilroy, a surgeon-captain in the Royal Navy. They had a son and a daughter.<br>
<br>In 1928 Milne was appointed private secretary to the permanent under-secretary of state at the Scottish Office and in 1930 became private secretary to the Scottish secretary. It was in this office, during the minority Labour government, that he was first able to demonstrate his administrative talents, combining sympathy and tact with an ability to appreciate ministerial wishes and act as an interpreter between them and the civil servants' views on the nature of the Scottish interest. The hitherto devolutionary views of the ministerial team were rarely found in the memoranda submitted to the cabinet and in other correspondence. In 1935 he was promoted assistant secretary to head the newly established local government branch, based in Edinburgh. The branch was meant to signify an element of administrative devolution in Scottish affairs by ensuring that Scottish institutions could deal with a senior official in Scotland without travelling to London and paralleled the establishment of the Scottish special areas commissioner (who also reported to the Scottish secretary). His ability to deal with the commissioner with discretion (and prevent too ready an experimentation of state intervention in economic affairs) and generally ensure a better acquaintance between domestic institutions and the Scottish Office saw him promoted in September 1939 to deputy secretary of the Scottish home department. This department was newly created on the reorganization of the Scottish offices, and was based in Edinburgh. He became its secretary in 1942.<br>
<br>In 1945 Milne was appointed permanent under-secretary of state to the Scottish Office on the retirement of Sir Horace Perkins Hamilton. It was not an automatic succession. The Scottish secretary, Tom Johnston, had wanted a previous Scottish health department secretary, William Scott Douglas; there were also doubts whether Milne had the character to operate with authority as head of the four rather disparate Edinburgh departments (dealing with agriculture, education, health, and home affairs) and the reputation to check the growing centrifugal force of Scottish domestic opinion. However, Douglas had been earmarked for the Ministry of Health and the other Scottish alternatives appeared to have even more cogent administrative weaknesses to operate at that level. Milne remained in the post until he retired in autumn 1959.<br>
<br>During Milne's period as permanent under-secretary the Scottish Office was transformed from a rather minor Whitehall department that dealt mainly with re-drafting English bills and generally adapting English departmental deliberation to meet the exigencies of Scots law into a major department that often as not insisted that Scottish conditions demanded special consideration. Much of this was due to Milne's desire to deal effectively with the forces of Scottish centrifugalism, particularly the nationalists, who argued that unemployment and social deprivation could be more effectively reduced by home rule. In the late 1940s, using his contacts with Scottish institutions (then anti-nationalist, although somewhat reluctant to state their views in public) and the press, he carefully co-ordinated a ministerial campaign to deflate the Scottish covenant movement (which had gathered over 1 million signatures in favour of a Scottish parliament) with minor political concessions. The corollary of this was an official policy that sought to maximize government subvention of Scottish provision. During the 1950s, under Milne's guidance, Scottish officials were able to ensure government acceptance of the idea that Scottish provision should equal that in England, despite an increasingly lower rate (and tax) base. Milne even argued that to satisfy Scottish opinion of the benefits of the union, such provision ought, on occasion, to demonstrate that it exceeded that in England.<br>
<br>In administrative affairs Milne was essentially a club man, preferring to meet, talk, and agree a matter with others rather than resort to lengthy minutes and correspondence. His unobtrusiveness and unassuming manner might have suggested lack of authority and unwillingness to deal with matters directly, but his brand of comfortable unionism had successfully managed Scottish affairs since the nineteenth century. In a period of increased government intervention in social and economic affairs and when Scottish institutions were more likely to be affected by that intervention, his administrative style and ability to select deputies of similar mind did much to ensure that Scottish opinion felt able to work and prosper with the United Kingdom government.<br>
<br>In 1958 Milne published <span class="italic">The Scottish Office</span>, one of the series of books published on Whitehall departments by the Institute of Public Administration. He was knighted in 1947 and became a knight grand cross on retirement in 1959. In private life Milne liked to listen to music and generally appreciate the arts. He was chairman of the Scottish National Orchestra Society, 1961&#150;70, as well as a governor of the BBC in Scotland, 1960&#150;65. He died at the Royal Infirmary, Edinburgh, on 4 February 1972; his wife had predeceased him.<br>
