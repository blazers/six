<span class="headword">Felton, Sir  William, the younger</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1367), <span class="occ">soldier and administrator</span>, was the son of Sir William Felton of Northumberland, who died about 1358, and his first wife, Isabel. Sir William Felton the elder has often been confused with his son, who seems to have been born between <i>c</i>.1315 and 1325. In the records of the Cr&eacute;cy campaign the father is said to have been with the king from the landing at La Hogue until the siege at Calais. He is described as &#145;Sir William Felton the elder&#146;, while &#145;Sir William Felton, chyvaler&#146; is named as the last member (and therefore implicitly a junior figure) in the retinue of the bishop of Durham. It is reasonable to assume that it was Sir William Felton the elder who played a distinguished part in Edward III's Scottish wars, and that it was he who was at the battle of Halidon Hill in 1333, and commanded Bamburgh and Roxburgh castles from 1334 to 1340. He was sheriff of Northumberland and governor of Newcastle in 1342&#150;3, and was summoned to parliament in the latter year. After this it is less clear which of the two Sir Williams is intended; it was probably the elder who fought at Tournai in 1339 and at Sluys in 1340, but in the Breton campaigns of 1343 it could have been either, since the younger man's military career must have begun about this time. After Sir William the younger's service at Cr&eacute;cy, he next appears in Brittany with Henry, duke of Lancaster, in 1355; he is unlikely to have fought at Poitiers, as some historians have assumed, as he does not appear in any of the records of that campaign, and he was probably still in Brittany.<br>
<br>Felton may have been on the Rheims campaign of 1359. He was one of the commissioners appointed to supervise the transfer of territories under the provisions of the treaty of Br&eacute;tigny, signed in May 1360. He was appointed seneschal of Poitou in February 1362, and later seneschal of Limousin as well, and was lieutenant to Sir John Chandos, the king's lieutenant-general in France. He now played a leading military role in the administration of Aquitaine by Edward, prince of Wales. He defeated a group of Bretons belonging to the Great Company in Limousin in Lent 1362, and was active in securing castles and attempting to suppress the English freebooters whom the truce had deprived of a livelihood. Following the truce of Landes d'Evran between John de Montfort, duke of Brittany, and Charles, duke of Blois, in July 1363, Felton was put in charge of Bertrand du Guesclin, who had been pledged as a hostage, but du Guesclin negotiated his release within a month. Felton challenged du Guesclin with breaking his word in a letter of 24 November 1363, a charge du Guesclin rejected on 9 December. On 29 February 1364 the <i>parlement</i> of Paris, sitting as a court of honour, freed du Guesclin from the requirement to defend his actions. On the prince's expedition to Spain in 1366&#150;7, he was in the vanguard under the duke of Lancaster. A day or two before the battle of N&aacute;jera he and his kinsman Sir Thomas Felton were with a small body of men, probably a foraging party, about 2 or 3 miles from the main army. Enrique da Trastamara's brother, Don Tello, led a surprise attack on the English camp, which was driven off with some difficulty. Don Tello's force then attacked Felton's men, who made a stand on a small mound near the village of Ari&ntilde;ez, about 3 miles from Vitoria; Felton had 200 men-at-arms and the same number of archers, but they were greatly outnumbered. Sir William Felton and many others were killed, and the remainder were taken prisoner. The exploit passed into local folklore, and in the eighteenth century the &#145;Englishmen's hill&#146; was still a landmark. Du Guesclin's biographer makes du Guesclin the prime mover in the attack, which is his revenge for Felton's challenge to his honour; but the Spanish chronicler, Pedro Lopez de Ay&aacute;la, was with Enrique da Trastamara's army, and his account is likely to be more accurate.<br>
<br>Felton was married; Sir Thomas Gray's erroneous claim that he married Isabella, countess of Fife, probably derives from a writ of 1359, which gives his wife's name as Isabel; Isabella, countess of Fife, was married four times, but her first husband died <i>c</i>.1360. William Felton's heir was Sir John Felton, who was of age at his father's death.<br>
