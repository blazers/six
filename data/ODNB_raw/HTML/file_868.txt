<span class="headword">Atlay,  James</span>  (1817&#150;1894), <span class="occ">bishop of Hereford</span>, was the second son of the Revd Henry Atlay and his wife, Elizabeth Rayner Hovell. Born on 3 July 1817 at Wakerley in Northamptonshire, he was educated at Grantham and Oakham schools, and entered St John's College, Cambridge, as a foundation scholar in 1836. He was elected to a Bell university scholarship in 1837, and graduated BA in 1840 as a senior optime and ninth classic. In 1842 he was elected to a fellowship, and he proceeded MA in 1843, BD in 1850, and DD in 1859. After being ordained deacon in 1842 and priest in the following year, he held from 1843 to 1846 the curacy of Warsop in Nottinghamshire, and from 1847 to 1852 the vicarage of Madingley near Cambridge. In 1856 he was appointed Whitehall preacher, and in 1858 and the following year was one of the select preachers before the university; but it was by his work and influence as tutor of St John's from 1846 to 1859 that he made a mark among his contemporaries which spread far beyond the walls of his own college.<br>
<br>In 1859 Atlay married Frances Turner, daughter of Major William Martin of the East India Company; they had several children. Also in 1859 the trustees of the advowson of Leeds elected Atlay as vicar in succession to Walter Farquhar Hook, who had been a strikingly innovative vicar. Atlay carried on the work of his predecessor with conspicuous success. His businesslike qualities won him respect in a great mercantile city. He initiated a great scheme of church extension, and his organizing capacity made Leeds the best-worked parish in the kingdom. He was appointed canon residentiary at Ripon in 1861; in 1867 he refused the bishopric of Calcutta, but in 1868 he accepted Disraeli's offer of the bishopric of Hereford in succession to Renn Dickson Hampden.<br>
<br>Atlay brought to the management of his diocese the same thoroughness which had marked his career at Leeds and Cambridge. Rarely leaving it except to attend the House of Lords or convocation, he lived and died among his own people. He made a point of officiating in every church of a wide though sparsely populated diocese. His great parochial experience rendered him the trusted counsellor and guide of his clergy; his geniality and frankness, united to a fine presence, endeared him to all who were brought near him. Archbishop Benson described him as &#145;the most beautiful combination of enthusiasm, manliness, and modesty&#146;. In 1889 Benson selected him as an assessor in the trial of Bishop King of Lincoln for alleged ritual offences. Atlay was a high-churchman of the old school and a conservative in politics; he was one of the four bishops who voted against Frederick Temple when he was appointed bishop of Exeter by Gladstone. He died on 24 December 1894, after a long illness, and was buried in &#145;the ladye arbour&#146; under the walls of his cathedral.<br>
<br>One of Atlay's sons, the Revd George William Atlay, attached to the Universities' Mission to Central Africa, was murdered on the shores of Lake Nyasa in August 1895; another, Charles Cecil, died in March 1900 of wounds received at Wagon Hill, Ladysmith, while serving in the Imperial light horse.<br>
