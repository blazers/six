<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Storks, Sir  Henry Knight</span>  (1811&#150;1874), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was born in London, the eldest son of Serjeant Henry Storks (1778&#150;1866), a county court judge, and his wife, Mary, daughter and coheir of Thomas Trundle. He was educated at Charterhouse School. He was commissioned ensign in the 61st foot on 10 January 1828, and became lieutenant on 2 March 1832. On 23 March he exchanged into the 14th foot, in which he became captain on 30 October 1835, and from which he exchanged on 30 May 1836 into the 38th foot. He served with the regiment in the Ionian Islands, obtained his majority on 7 August 1840, and went on half pay from the regiment on 23 May 1845. He was employed as assistant adjutant-general at the Cape during the Cape Frontier War of 1846&#150;7, and was assistant military secretary at Mauritius from 1849 to 1854. He was given an unattached lieutenant-colonelcy on 15 September 1848, and became colonel on 28 November 1854. He married, in 1841, the daughter of Cav. Giuseppe Nizzoli of Milan; she died in 1848.<br>
<br>During the Crimean War, Storks was in charge of the British establishments in Turkey, from the Bosphorus to Smyrna, and received the local rank of major-general on 23 November 1855. He superintended the final British withdrawal from Turkey at the end of the war, and was then employed at the War Office as secretary for military correspondence from 1857 to 1859. He obtained one of the rewards for distinguished service on 25 September 1856, and was made KCB on 2 January 1857.<br>
<br>In February 1859 Storks became the last high commissioner of the Ionian Islands (taking over from W. E. Gladstone). The British protectorate was resigned by treaty in November 1863, and the islands united with Greece. Shortly before this Storks had made changes in the judicial bench, following complaints against the two Ionian judges. Their two English colleagues took their part, and acrimonious correspondence followed, but Storks's action was upheld by the Colonial Office. He received the GCMG in 1860, and was promoted major-general on 12 November 1862. On 1 July 1864 he received the GCB.<br>
<br>Storks was made governor of Malta on 15 November 1864, but at the end of 1865 Cardwell, the colonial secretary, sent him to Jamaica to replace the governor, E. J. Eyre, and serve as a member of a royal commission on the recent disturbances in Jamaica and their suppression, which had aroused much controversy in Britain. The other commissioners were two distinguished lawyers, Russell Gurney and J. B. Maule. The commission investigated, then submitted its report in April 1866. A &#145;masterly and notably impartial document&#146;  (Morrell, 418), it stated that the rising had been a real danger and that Eyre had responded effectively to it, but that the punishments had been excessive.<br>
<br>Storks gave up the governorship of Jamaica on 16 July 1866, and was rewarded with a privy councillorship in November. On 19 December 1867 he was appointed controller-in-chief and under-secretary at the War Office. The control department, of which he was the head, was formed at that time, at the suggestion of Lord Strathnairn's committee, to give unity to the administration of army transport and supply, hitherto dealt with by several separate branches. But the amalgamation of the branches caused resentment: the new department encroached on the field of the quartermaster-general, and the title &#145;controller&#146; (i.e. of army expenditure) was open to misinterpretation and was unpopular. The department did not last many years. There was disagreement on whether the charge of &#145;warlike stores&#146; should be committed to the new department. Eventually it was decided, in 1870, that the stores should be entrusted to a sub-department under the director of artillery, who (with the director of supplies and transport) should be subordinate to the surveyor-general of the ordnance&#151;an old title revived, the functions of which were fixed by order in council of 23 June 1870. Storks exchanged the controllership-in-chief for this new office, which he held until his death.<br>
<br>One object of the change was to afford more support to the secretary of state for war in parliament. Storks therefore in November 1870 contested, as a government candidate, the Colchester by-election. The campaign for the repeal of the <span class="roman">Contagious Diseases Acts</span>, led by Josephine Butler and others, attempted to put pressure on the government by challenging government candidates at by-elections. They targeted Storks, largely because he had implemented a regulation system at Malta, strongly supported the acts, and favoured their extension to soldiers' wives. The repealers' intervention resulted in Liberal abstentions and a Conservative victory. However, Storks became Liberal MP for Ripon in February 1871, and assisted Cardwell in the prolonged debates on the abolition of purchase of commissions. He was one of Cardwell's staunchest supporters in his attempt to reform the War Office.<br>
<br>Storks became lieutenant-general on 25 October 1871, and lost his seat at the 1874 election. Not a brilliant speaker or writer, he was a competent administrator, tactful and devoted to the public service. He died on 6 September 1874 at 43 Queen's Road, Finchley Road, London, and was buried on 15 September at Highgate cemetery.<br>
