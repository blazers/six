<span class="headword">Veitch,  William</span> <span class="st"> [<em>alias </em>William Johnston, George Johnston]</span>  (1640&#150;1722), <span class="occ">Church of Scotland minister</span>, was born at Roberton, Lanarkshire, on 27 April 1640, the fifth son of John Veitch (1589&#150;1673), minister of that parish, and his wife, Elizabeth Johnston, daughter of a Glasgow merchant. He studied at the University of Glasgow, graduated MA in 1659, and was awarded the title of laureate. The following year he became tutor to the family of Sir Andrew Ker of Greenhead, and was later governor to Greenhead's son at the University of Edinburgh. His memoirs suggest that the eminent presbyterian John Livingstone persuaded him to become a minister. He joined the family of Sir Hugh Campbell of Calder as chaplain in 1663, though he was forced by the local bishop to leave about September 1664. On 23 November the same year he married Marion Fairlie (1639&#150;1722) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/45831/', "Veitch, Marion")</script>] of the family of Braid, with whom he had five sons and five daughters.<br>
<br>In 1666 Veitch joined the presbyterian Pentland rising and was sent by the rebels to Edinburgh to seek the advice of Sir James Stewart of Goodtrees. He was captured but later freed, after which he fled as an outlaw to England, where he adopted his mother's name, being known as William or George Johnston. For some time he was chaplain to the wife of the mayor of Newcastle, and, after preaching both in London and in other places in the north of England, he was in 1671 ordained minister of a meeting-house at Fallowlees in Northumberland, where his wife and sons William and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28261/', "Samuel Vetch")</script> joined him. He afterwards preached at Hanham Hall in the parish of Rothbury, also in Northumberland; four years later he removed to Stanton Hall in the parish of Longhorsley.<br>
<br>On 16 January 1679 Veitch was arrested and, having been suspended on 22 February before the committee of public affairs in Edinburgh, was imprisoned on the Bass Rock. However, on 17 July he was set at liberty (possibly at the intercession of Sir James Dalrymple of Stair and the first earl of Shaftesbury, among others) and returned to Northumberland. When in 1681 Archibald Campbell, earl of Argyll, escaped from prison, Veitch not only sheltered him in his house, but also used his own experience as a fugitive to conduct the earl safely to London. Two years later Veitch had to make his own escape to the United Provinces, but during the Monmouth rising of 1685 he was sent to Northumberland to foment an outbreak there. The failure of Argyll's parallel uprising in Scotland put an end to the project, and after remaining for some time in hiding under various names, Veitch became minister of a meeting-house at Beverley, Yorkshire, where he remained for six or seven months.<br>
<br>After the declarations of indulgence of James VII and II, Veitch returned to Scotland and was called to the parish of Whittonhall, Morebattle, in the presbytery of Kelso, where he was admitted in April 1688. He was translated successively in 1690 to Peebles and in 1694 to Dumfries, and was a member of the general assembly of the Church of Scotland from 1690 to 1692. He published four sermons in the 1690s and two tracts against Catholicism in 1718 and 1720. He demitted his charge on 19 May 1715, and died, probably at Dumfries, on 8 May 1722; his wife died a day later. He was buried at Dumfries parish church. Several of his children had predeceased him, including William, who had died during the ill-fated Darien expedition in 1699. Samuel (1668&#150;1732) became the first governor of Nova Scotia.<br>
