<span class="headword">Dunlop,  Marion  Wallace-</span>  (1864&#150;1942), <span class="occ">suffragist and artist</span>, was born on 22 December 1864 at Leys Castle, Inverness, in Scotland, the daughter of Robert Henry Wallace-Dunlop, of the Bengal civil service, and his wife, Lucy Dowson (1836&#150;1914). Two of her sisters, Madeline and Rosalind Wallace-Dunlop, wrote <span class="italic">Timely Retreat, or, A Year in Bengal before the Mutinies</span> (1858), which became a best-seller. Her father, who had been decorated for distinguished service in the Indian mutiny, retired from India in the year of her birth. Although she lived most of her life in London, she did not forget her Scottish origins, describing herself as &#145;a direct descendant of the mother of William Wallace&#146;  (<span class="italic">Votes for Women</span>, 2 July 1909). Indeed, the large house that her father built in what is now Montpellier Road, Ealing, was named Ellerslie after Wallace's birthplace. She herself was called after the patriot's wife.<br>
<br>Marion Wallace-Dunlop studied at the Slade School of Fine Art and exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1903 (when she also exhibited a painting at the Royal Glasgow Institute of the Fine Arts), and in 1905 and 1906. Her paintings were also exhibited in Paris. She illustrated in art nouveau style two books, <span class="italic">Fairies, Elves, and Flower Babies</span> and <span class="italic">The Magic Fruit Garden</span>, both published in 1899.<br>
<br>From 1906 to 1913 Wallace-Dunlop was a member of the Fabian Women's Group. She was involved in the suffrage movement from 1900, when she subscribed to the Central Society for Women's Suffrage, but militancy made an immediate appeal to her, and from 1908 she was active in the Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU). She was arrested and imprisoned in Holloway for the first time in July 1908 for &#145;obstruction&#146; and again in November of that year for leading a deputation to the House of Commons. In June 1909 she stencilled the following extract from the <span class="roman">Bill of Rights</span> on the wall of St Stephen's Hall in the Palace of Westminster: &#145;It is the right of the subject to petition the King, and all commitments and prosecution for such petitions are illegal&#146;  (Rosen, 118). Back in Holloway prison she went on hunger strike, an entirely independent action that was then taken up by the WSPU as future policy. After ninety-one hours of fasting she was released.<br>
<br>At that time (5 July) Frederick Pethick-Lawrence wrote to Marion Wallace-Dunlop: &#145;Nothing has moved me so much&#151;stirred me to the depths of my being&#151;as your heroic action&#146;  (Rosen, 120). In common with a number of other suffragettes, Marion became a vegetarian. In 1910 and 1911 she helped to design many of the spectacular WSPU processions. In November 1911 she helped to organize a window-smashing campaign and was imprisoned for her own part in this. In her entry for the <span class="italic">Women's Who's Who</span> in 1913, under &#145;Recreations&#146; she recorded: &#145;No time for them&#151;till the vote is won.&#146; Nevertheless, early in 1918 she was visited by Mary Sheepshanks, who observed her leading an idyllic pastoral life in the countryside:<blockquote>we found her in a delicious cottage with a little chicken and goat farm, an adopted baby of 18 months, and a perfectly lovely young girl who did some bare foot dancing for us in the barn; we finished up with home made honey. (M. Sheepshanks to C. Marshall, 7 April 1918, box 23, Catherine Marshall papers, Cumbria AS)</blockquote>In 1928 Wallace-Dunlop was a pallbearer at Emmeline Pankhurst's funeral, and for a time after that she took care of Mrs Pankhurst's adopted daughter, Mary, in her magnificent Elizabethan house at Peaslake, Surrey. She died on 12 September 1942 at the Mount Alvernia Nursing Home, Guildford.<br>
