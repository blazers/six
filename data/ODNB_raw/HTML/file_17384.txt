<span class="headword">Macartney,  George</span>  (<em>c.</em>1660&#150;1730), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was born in Belfast about 1660, the elder son of George Macartney, a recent settler from Scotland, and his wife, Martha Davies. One of the vanguard of a new, steady flow of Scots into Ulster, his father set up as a merchant and prospered. His mother came from the family of a prominent lawyer and politician, Sir John Davies (<i>d</i>. 1626), who had been attorney-general for Ireland. Macartney's younger brother Isaac belonged to the more civilized, urban element in an Ireland still regarded as semi-barbarous; he and his sons became influential in the expanding commercial life of Belfast, which by 1700 &#145;had replaced Limerick as the fourth port of Ireland&#146;  (Foster, 127).<br>
<br>Macartney was educated at home, and then in France. He may have been sent there to qualify for foreign commerce, like Francis Osbaldistone in Scott's <span class="italic">Rob Roy</span>. Like Francis, he broke away from any such prudent course. With or without paternal approval, he joined the Scots guards, and from then on was an army man to the backbone. Much of his career was to be linked with his ancestral Scotland. His military and Scottish bent showed even in his marriage, to the widow of a General Douglas. There were offspring, but this branch of the family, unlike Isaac's, died out before making its mark.<br>
<br>Macartney rose as a soldier, climbing the ladder from &#145;volunteer&#146; to lieutenant-colonel, with the Nine Years' War (1688&#150;97) in his ears. Only a brief interval of peace divided this from the last of Louis XIV's challenges to Europe, the War of the Spanish Succession (1702&#150;13). Macartney's service in the field belonged to the years 1706 to 1710, when he was in his forties, and when promotion could be swift for a man of courage and enterprise. In April 1703&#151;the year before Marlborough's first grand victory, at Blenheim&#151;he was appointed to the colonelcy of a new infantry regiment, to be raised in Scotland, and to be in a sense his own corps in an army still run largely by private enterprise. It was soon seeing action in Flanders, that &#145;cockpit of Europe&#146;, and before the end of 1705 Macartney was a brigadier. Not much later he and his men were sent to take part in the fighting in Spain. In April 1707 at the battle of Almanza, in the south-east, near Albacete, he was at the head of a brigade. His commander was Ruvigny, a Huguenot exile now earl of Galway, of whose 15,000 men only one-third were British. Ruvigny was outnumbered, and after severe losses had to effect a withdrawal. Macartney's regiment was cut to pieces, and he was captured.<br>
<br>Before long Macartney was free again, by an exchange; Marlborough knew his value and took a personal interest in getting him back. He was soon displaying a side of his nature&#151;and of his Ireland&#151;by some drunken misbehaviour to an old woman. She proved to be a clergyman's widow and took her complaint to the bishop of London, who carried it to Queen Anne; the latter summarily dismissed the culprit from the army. He had to sell his regiment, which after its wear and tear may not have been worth much; then, going back to his early beginnings, he rejoined the army as a gentleman volunteer.<br>
<br>Circumstances favoured Macartney. In 1709 Marlborough was trying to penetrate northern France. His bloodiest encounter took place at Malplaquet, just inside the frontier, in September. Very large forces were engaged on each side; Marlborough could claim victory, but with far more severe losses than those of his opponent Villars, who had occupied a better position. It was the kind of situation where Macartney could be at his best, and the following year saw him promoted major-general, directing the siege of Douai. But Marlborough and his war policy were losing favour, and in August 1710 the whig ministry was replaced by a tory government headed by Harley and St John. In December, Marlborough was deprived of all his posts and charged with peculation, and Swift could crow, in his letters to Stella, over the dismissal of Macartney and other like-minded officers.<br>
<br>A duel was to be the cause of Macartney's next discomfiture, though the quarrel was not his own. His fellow tory-hater Charles, fourth Baron Mohun, had for years been at loggerheads with James, fourth duke of Hamilton, a Scottish ally of the tories and high in favour with the queen. With everyone anxiously awaiting Anne's death, politicians' nerves were under acute strain.<br>
<br>In November 1712 the bitterness between Mohun and Hamilton erupted in a challenge, and the former enlisted Macartney as his second. There is no sign of any close friendship between the two men, and the link must have been chiefly political. The affray, in Hyde Park on 15 November 1712, ended with both principals mortally wounded. Their seconds seem to have made only a show of using their swords; but at a privy council enquiry the duke's second, another Hamilton, declared on oath that Macartney had given the death blow to the helpless duke. Macartney hid for a few days, and escaped to the Netherlands with a price on his head. He was in exile for four years and thus missed the Jacobite rising of autumn 1715, following Anne's death; however, its failure enabled him to return and submit to the law.<br>
<br>In June 1716 Macartney was tried for murder and virtually acquitted; Hamilton had more or less withdrawn his accusation, and been retired from the army. Macartney was clearly the kind of man that a new dynasty, still insecure, stood in need of as a prop. He was immediately reinstated in the army with the rank of colonel and soon raised to lieutenant-general. There were no more wars in store for him, but in 1718 he was made governor of the strategic border town of Berwick, and in 1722 he became a comptroller of army accounts; later he was commanding general in Ireland and governor of Portsmouth. Macartney died in 1730. He was a man of no great note on his own account, but he belonged to a band of fighting-men who built an army that in some degree altered the course of European history.<br>
