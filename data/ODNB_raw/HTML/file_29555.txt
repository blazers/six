<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Williams, Sir  William</span>, first baronet  (1633/4&#150;1700), <span class="occ">lawyer and politician</span>, was born at Nantanog in Llantrisant, Anglesey, the second son of Hugh Williams (<i>c</i>.1596&#150;1670), rector of Llantrisant and later canon of Bangor and prebendary of St Asaph, and of Emma, the daughter of John Dolben of Caeau Gwynion near Denbigh.<br>
<br>After studying at Shrewsbury School Williams entered Jesus College, Oxford, in 1650 and in the same year was entered at Gray's Inn. His father was ejected from his rectory during this period, but this did not hinder Williams's entry into the legal profession, and he was called to the bar in 1658. The young lawyer began his practice in his native Wales and its marches, starting with his appointment as clerk of the crown in Denbighshire and Montgomeryshire. He also appeared in the borough courts of Shrewsbury where at one point he successfully represented Walter Kyffin of Llansilin in Denbighshire. On 14 April 1664 Williams married Kyffin's daughter and heir, Margaret (<i>d</i>. 1705); they had four sons and one daughter. Margaret and her husband ultimately inherited Glascoed House in Llansilin, which became their principal residence. Williams also purchased Llanforda in Shropshire and lands thereabout, much to the dismay of at least one neighbour who begged to be released from Williams's grasp: &#145;Suffer not me to be a prey to this prodigious glutton who will not buy my land unless for sauce my discretion is served up to his taste&#146;  (Jenkins, 93).<br>
<br>Williams first appeared in the courts of Westminster Hall in the early 1660s. In 1667 he was unanimously chosen recorder, freeman, and alderman of Chester, where he helped the city fend off over-eager excise collectors and countered heavy tax assessments by county leaders. As a city justice of the peace Williams was equally energetic against protestant dissenters. Thus he began an association with Chester that would provide the foundation for his legal and political career.<h2>
<a name="Parliamentarycareerto1681"></a>Parliamentary career to 1681</h2>Williams stood at a by-election at Chester in early 1673. Though considered one of &#145;the royal party&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1672&#150;3</i>, 505&#150;6), many felt that he split that interest by appearing against Robert Werden, a lieutenant-colonel in the duke of York's guards. A hot contest ensued and on the day of the poll Williams whipped up his supporters, at least nine of whom died when too large a crowd surged into too small a city hall. The mayor had endorsed Williams, who claimed that all freemen were required by their oaths to vote as the mayor did: an assertion of political deference that Williams would pointedly reject in later years. Such arguments availed little, and Werden was returned after a close poll. Williams unsuccessfully challenged the result in the Commons.<br>
<br>Williams had to wait two more years before he obtained a seat, at Chester's next by-election in 1675. Once at Westminster he immediately addressed a major concern of his friends in Chester: excise charges which they thought were too high and too aggressively collected. Closely related was Chester's complaint that to enforce excise collection in the city county justices&#151;normally barred from the city by Chester's charter&#151;had been empowered to act there by a special commission of association. Williams prompted the Commons to vote that the appointment of county justices to serve on normally autonomous urban benches was a grievance. After this, county justices apparently withdrew from Chester's bench.<br>
<br>Williams quickly became a leading member of the house. He served on many committees, including those for a bill for &#145;the liberty of the subject&#146;&#151;promoting the use of the writ of habeas corpus&#151;and another charged with considering ways to limit the threats to common-law jurisdiction posed by courts of equity. Though a champion of some law reforms, he opposed a proposal to establish a public register of land transactions arguing that it would unleash &#145;an earthquake on estates&#146;  (Grey, 5.146&#150;7). Williams spoke regularly and energetically against the power of France. More tendentiously, he suggested that the king could not legitimately raise troops. Sir Robert Sawyer and others challenged this surprising claim, and after being reprimanded by the speaker for using words that undermined the prerogative, Williams admitted his error and begged the house's pardon. None the less, Williams would continue throughout his life to speak against the prerogative of raising royal forces: &#145;I look upon the army as a sham upon the people&#146;  (Grey, 6.279&#150;80).<br>
<br>But Williams's views of the prerogative and its role in law were by no means simple. In June 1677 he appeared in king's bench to represent the earl of Shaftesbury, pleading on the habeas corpus by which the earl hoped to gain release from his imprisonment by the House of Lords for an alleged contempt. Williams contended: &#145;That the cause was of great consequence, in regard that the king was touched in his prerogative; the subject was touched in his liberty, and this court in its jurisdiction&#146;  (<span class="italic">State trials</span>, 6.1276&#150;7). Though he ultimately failed, Williams argued vigorously that the writ from king's bench to the House of Lords was good. Habeas corpus, he explained, was an unusual writ, founded on the king's prerogative to protect the liberty of the subject by empowering king's bench, in the king's name, to inspect the actions of other judges and administrative officers; as such, the writ should go wherever there was a threat to liberty, even to parliament. For Williams, the prerogative could protect liberty as well as threaten it.<br>
<br>Williams quickly became an ardent believer in the Popish Plot when Titus Oates began telling his tales late in 1678. Re-elected for Chester in the parliaments of 1679 to 1681, he chaired the committee which prepared the articles of impeachment against the earl of Danby. Having led the attack on the king's leading servant and challenged the grant of supply to the king and the maintenance of a royal army, Williams was dismissed early in 1680 from the county commissions of the peace for Denbigh, Montgomery, and Shropshire.<br>
<br>But Williams's profile in parliament continued to grow, and in October 1680 he was named speaker of the House of Commons. The Commons now decided to publish their votes, the responsibility for which was assigned to the speaker, who was to sign the votes before sending them to the printer. For now this decision seemed of little importance; later it had a profound impact on Williams, who was again named speaker at the third Exclusion Parliament in March 1681. He clearly relished the speaker's role. When Sir Robert Peyton was expelled the house in November 1680, Williams lashed out: &#145;You are absolutely the worst man and have committed the greatest of offenses for which you deserve to be obliterated from the knowledge of all &hellip; you are become nauseous to this house and therefore they now spew you out&#146;  (NL Wales, Coedymaen MS 51). Peyton challenged him to a duel but Williams reported him to the privy council, which sent Peyton to the Tower.<h2>
<a name="Partisanpoliticsandlitigationinthe1680s"></a>Partisan politics and litigation in the 1680s</h2>With parliaments in abeyance from April 1681, the nation's attention turned to the courtroom and the localities; Williams played a prominent part in both arenas. Throughout his years in parliament he had remained one of the leading practitioners in the courts in Westminster Hall. He defended Benjamin Harris, Henry Care, and other publishers of political pamphlets in a series of proceedings against them for libel in 1680. Prosecuting in most of these cases was Sir George Jeffreys, who quickly became Williams's nemesis.<br>
<br>Williams joined other whiggish lawyers&#151;George Treby, Sir Francis Winnington, and Henry Pollexfen&#151;to provide counsel to Edward Fitzharris, on trial for treason in June 1681. Williams argued in support of Fitzharris's plea that king's bench did not have jurisdiction of the matter since there was already an impeachment brought against Fitzharris in parliament. Though parliament had been dissolved, Williams contended that this was a good plea since &#145;parliament is the supreme court certainly, and this court is every way inferior to it, and it will be strange that that supreme court should be hindered by an inferior&#146;  (<span class="italic">State trials</span>, 8.286). By relying on the supremacy of parliament over king's bench, Williams now undermined the ground on which he had made his case for the earl of Shaftesbury four years earlier. Williams knew this well, and turned it to his advantage, saying that the justices' decision in Shaftesbury's case&#151;that a habeas corpus could not run from king's bench to parliament&#151;had determined king's bench's inferior status, which now precluded it from hearing a matter that still lay before parliament. Creative as he was, he could not prevent the justices from proceeding and ultimately entering judgment against Fitzharris. Again, Jeffreys had led the prosecution.<br>
<br>In 1683 Williams defended London sheriffs Thomas Pilkington and Samuel Shute, along with others, for their part in an alleged riot during the contested City elections of 1682. He also joined Winnington, Pollexfen, and Treby to defend Sir Patience Ward from charges of perjury. In both cases, Jeffreys conducted the prosecution. Williams also prepared extensive written advice for Algernon Sidney before his treason trial in 1683; in 1684 he counselled John Hampden in his treason trial and made extensive arguments on his behalf in court. In these two cases Jeffreys now presided as chief justice of king's bench, baiting Williams whenever he could.<br>
<br>Throughout these years Williams also spent considerable time in Chester cultivating his political base. In September 1682 the duke of Monmouth visited the city and received a clamorous welcome from the populace, stirred up as they were by Williams's cronies on the corporation. Many were bound over, but a city grand jury returned <i>ignoramus</i> to the charge of riot against them. Shortly thereafter none other than Chief Justice Jeffreys arrived in Chester to preside at the assizes, where he ultimately used a special commission of oyer and terminer to try the rioters again. Williams &#145;addressed himself to the people in a very factious harangue&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1682</i>, 438&#150;9), claiming that Jeffreys's commission was void since Chester's charter reserved purview of such matters to the city's own magistrates. Jeffreys proceeded, commanding a new grand jury to return a true bill, which they did, over Williams's energetic opposition.<br>
<br>Williams's Chester interest was crumbling rapidly, but he now had other concerns: the protection of London's charter from the <i>quo warranto</i> brought by Attorney-General Sir Robert Sawyer in order to undermine the City's independence. Williams, Sir Francis Winnington, and six other &#145;true Protestant lawyers&#146;  (<span class="italic">Seventh Report</span>, HMC, 359) signed the City's plea to the <i>quo warranto</i>, though Williams did not join them in court to plead on the City's behalf. With judgment entered against London in early 1683, most expected that all towns would now submit when threatened with <i>quo warranto</i>. Most did; Chester did not. In August 1683, when &#145;loyal&#146; Cestrians and area gentry subscribed an address to the king submitting to a <i>quo warranto</i> brought against the city, Williams convinced the corporation overwhelmingly to reject the address. He and his friends then signed another address full of humble loyalty, but without the expected words of submission. When both addresses arrived at Whitehall, the king graciously received the first but refused the second.<br>
<br>This did not deter Williams. On Christmas eve 1683, when the corporation was setting the annual mayor's Christmas watch, Williams made another important speech, contending that to surrender the charter would be a &#145;self-homicide&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1683&#150;4</i>, 166). He encouraged them to fight on. At the city quarter sessions soon after the new year the grand jury proposed that the corporation appear in court to defend the city's charter rather than surrender it. But less than two months later, despite all the enthusiasm Williams initially inspired, the corporation voted not to answer the <i>quo warranto</i>. It was, in short, a vote to surrender. Williams still refused to concede. Joining with the mayor and a handful of like-minded aldermen, he applied the mayor's seal to a warrant authorizing him to plead for the city against the <i>quo warranto</i>, a legally dubious man&#339;uvre at best, given the corporation's vote. But king's bench refused to hear him after thirty-nine of the corporation's members petitioned the court not to admit Williams's pleas. Williams had finally failed, Chester's charter was forfeit, and when the crown passed another charter, Williams and his friends were notably absent from the list of the city's new officers.<br>
<br>Williams remained active in Westminster Hall. When the East India Company sued Thomas Sandys for violating their monopoly, Williams joined other prominent barristers arguing for the defence. He juxtaposed public good&#151;free trade&#151;with the private greed of the company, and again relied on the king's prerogative as the protector of the subject's liberty and of the public welfare:<blockquote>The property and liberty of the subjects, are put into the power of the company; and they are to dispose of the liberty and property to serve their own Company, and not the public &hellip; We that argue for Mr. Sandys argue for the king's prerogative. (<span class="italic">State trials</span>, 10.496)</blockquote>Williams also assisted the earl of Macclesfield when he unsuccessfully sued Sir Thomas Grosvenor&#151;Williams's main foe at Chester and the mastermind behind the new charter&#151;and other Cheshire grandees for <i>scandalum magnatum</i> when they presented Macclesfield for disaffection to the king at the county's quarter sessions.<h2>
<a name="Fromdefendanttosolicitorgeneral16841688"></a>From defendant to solicitor-general, 1684&#150;1688</h2>Williams faced greater trouble in 1684 when he found himself the target of charges that he had libelled the duke of York when, according to Commons' orders to him as speaker, he had authorized the publication of Thomas Dangerfield's <span class="italic">Information</span>. Williams pleaded that he had simply acted according to Commons' orders and thus could not be liable for any wrong. He also suggested that because what he did was done in parliament, it could not be inspected by the lesser court of king's bench. To provide more protection than these pleadings could give he sought a seat in parliament in 1685. His position at Chester having been destroyed by the new charter, he was instead returned for the Montgomeryshire boroughs. But he was unseated in June when the Commons resolved that he had been chosen without the votes of the out-boroughs entitled to vote for the seat. The prosecution against him could now resume. Henry Pollexfen represented him in court in May 1686 when the case at last came on. The justices refused to hear Pollexfen on the plea to the court's jurisdiction and the matter soon concluded with a &pound;10,000 fine against Williams. Williams now made the most abject of apologies to the king in hopes of pardon. Within days the earl of Peterborough brought a similar action against him, and another fine for &pound;20,000 soon followed.<br>
<br>With &pound;30,000 in judgments against him, Williams arranged to mortgage his properties. But he also discovered that he had supporters, if not friends, in high places. In a meeting with Chief Justice Sir Edward Herbert, he learned that it was his plea against the court's jurisdiction that had required judgment against him: &#145;I looked upon the plea as a diminution to the prerogative and not fit to continue upon record undetermined&#146;. Herbert added, &#145;you have some friends near the king and I shall not oppose what shall be moved for you&#146;  (NL Wales, Wynnstay MS C47). By mid-July 1686 various agents for Williams at court seemed ready to help him strike a deal. The earl of Rochester in particular worked on his behalf. In the end Williams paid only &pound;8000 of the fine in the judgment for the duke of York, who by now was James II; the king convinced Peterborough to drop his demands against Williams with only a token payment.<br>
<br>Adverse judgments and heavy fines proved crucial to turning Williams from a foe of the court into its great champion. Ellis Lloyd reported to him in July 1686 that &#145;the king took it kindly that you had promised hereafter not to be of counsel against the prerogative and more that he expected that you should serve him hereafter and behave yourself loyally&#146;  (NL Wales, Trevor Owen MS 47). Despite Williams's protestations of loyalty, he was still advising the corporation of Montgomery early in 1687 about how to fight a <i>quo warranto</i> brought against them by the king. None the less he ultimately kept his promise to serve the king: on 13 December 1687, James made Williams his solicitor-general, having knighted him two days before. Williams was now condemned as a turncoat:<blockquote>
<div>Williams, thy tame submission suits thee more,<br>
</div>
<div>Than thy mean payment of thy fine before.<br>
</div>
<div>Poor Wretch! Who after taking down thy arms<br>
</div>
<div>Hast a court smile! Strange over ruling charms!<br>
</div>
<div>Bankrupt in honor, thou art tumbled down<br>
</div>
<div>Below the abject'st creature of the gown &hellip;<br>
</div>
<div>Is this Wi. Williams, who made such a noise,<br>
</div>
<div>Dreadful to all the lewd abhoring boys?<br>
</div> (Bodl. Oxf., MS Firth c.15, 228&#150;9)</blockquote>Popular disdain notwithstanding, he could now redeem the mortgage of his houses at Llanforda, Glascoed, and in Spread Eagle Court in Gray's Inn. On 1 June 1688 the king promoted him to baronet. Williams was now deeply engaged in preparing his most important brief as solicitor: the case against the seven bishops who had refused to co-operate with James II's religious policies. In court against them at the end of June, Williams was described as &#145;violent and mighty zealous in the prosecution&#146;  (Luttrell, 1.448). Arrayed against him were many of the most prominent lawyers in the land, men who had figured prominently in the politically charged courtroom dramas earlier in the decade. Many of these Williams had worked with closely, such as Pollexfen and Winnington, but others were old tory foes such as Sawyer and Sir Heneage Finch. This wide range of legal talent on the other side suggests how marginalized Williams had become by serving James II. His strenuous efforts proved insufficient; when the judgment came in for the bishops he was hissed by the crowd.<br>
<br>Throughout 1688 Williams provided legal leadership in two controversial areas. First, he assisted the king by helping to manage the effort to find pliable persons who would support James's policy of religious toleration. Second, as part of this effort, he now led the way in suing dozens of corporations on <i>quo warrantos</i> to force them to surrender their charters, completely reversing his ardent defence of town governments earlier in the 1680s. It was hoped that by imposing new charters new corporators could be named who would return MPs that would support the king in the parliament he planned to call. Williams now worked closely with Jeffreys, though gossip suggested that Williams hoped to supplant him as lord chancellor.<br>
<br>Williams spent most of September and October in Cheshire and Wales working on the election effort. Shortly before he returned, and as the popularity of the king's measures reached bottom, the windows in his Gray's Inn chambers were broken. By now it was clear both to the king and his solicitor that their policies would have to be reversed. Williams arrived back in London just in time to draft the proclamation of 17 October by which the king restored the urban charters surrendered since 1679. This was his last significant act in the service of James II. Given that service, and given his rather different political loyalties before 1686, Williams can only have watched the prince of Orange's arrival in England with great perplexity.<h2>
<a name="Aftertherevolution"></a>After the revolution</h2>In mid-December 1688, after William had arrived at Windsor and James II had fled, Williams tried to have an audience with the prince, who refused to see him. This left parliament as the only stage on which Williams might restore his badly damaged political fortunes. In the convention of 1689, to which he was elected by Beaumaris, Williams turned on James, joining those&#151;mostly Williams's former whiggish allies of the early 1680s&#151;who argued that his departure amounted to an abdication. Williams's approach to the nation's current problem was strictly pragmatic, with a bit of his characteristic humour tossed in for good measure. &#145;'Tis a plain fact that he is gone&#146;. Worse, James had gone to France, &#145;a nation that has ever been averse to England and we to them (for we never liked anything of France but their wine, [and] that indeed we like very well)&#146;  (D. Jones, <span class="italic">A Parliamentary History of the Glorious Revolution</span>, 1988, 240). Williams further recommended that parliament consider abuses of the last two reigns, especially the grant of too much supply to the king, the appointment of toadying judges, and the purging of corporations, a surprising addition to the list given Williams's own promotion of such purges in 1687&#150;8.<br>
<br>Williams recovered surprisingly well from the difficulties created by his participation in James's regime. In April 1689 he was named a king's counsel. He was also reappointed to the commission of the peace for the various Welsh counties on which he had served, and was made <i>custos rotulorum</i> for Denbighshire and Merioneth, though gentlemen in the latter county refused to act with him. In parliament Williams worked to regain his former stature. In the debate on an indemnity bill in June 1689 he grandly declared that &#145;Though I have suffered by parliaments, I will vindicate them while I live&#146;  (Grey, 9.282&#150;3). When he proclaimed that he had paid his &pound;8000 fine &#145;for the commons of England&#146;  (NL Wales, Wynnstay MS C52), the Commons passed a resolution declaring illegal the judgment against him for printing Dangerfield's <span class="italic">Information</span>. Williams hoped this might lead to a parliamentary order reimbursing him the amount of his fine, but this was not to be. When the Commons turned its interest from the prosecution of Williams by former attorney-general Sawyer&#151;whose actions in office Williams consistently condemned&#151;to the prosecution of the seven bishops by the former solicitor-general Williams, Williams suddenly took a very different line: &#145;Where there was counsel on both sides, I might be counsel&#146;  (Grey, 9.527). There was even a suggestion that for his part in James's government Williams might be excepted by name from any statutory indemnity.<br>
<br>Williams was not returned to parliament in 1690, but he remained prominent at the bar, and in 1692 became the queen's solicitor. Throughout the 1690s he frequently argued appeals in the House of Lords. His most interesting brief after 1688 came in king's bench in 1690 when, as king's counsel, he argued for the legality of proceedings by informations, by which the attorney-general may prosecute without first obtaining a grand jury indictment&#151;a procedure used most notoriously in <i>quo warrantos</i> against corporations and in prosecutions for seditious libel in the 1680s. Williams had figured prominently on both sides of such proceedings; his appearance now to defend informations must have raised eyebrows, which he well understood. He confessed that the crown had abused informations, but &#145;the abuse of a thing will not destroy it&#146;. He then referred to the prosecution of the seven bishops by information: &#145;I will not undertake to justify the proceedings of the late government; we have all done amiss, and must wink at one another&#146;  (5 Mod. 462, 87 ER 766). A majority of the justices agreed; informations were safe.<br>
<br>Williams remained involved at Chester where, in 1693, he helped the mayor, Colonel Roger Whitley, to purge the corporation of its foes by reverting to an ancient practice of holding annual elections to the common council. For the next two years Williams managed the legal battle to maintain the new advantage gained by his political friends there. Then in 1695, when Williams and Whitley were to stand together at Chester for election to parliament, Whitley at the last moment abandoned Williams&#151;amid mutual recriminations&#151;and was returned with the tory Sir Thomas Grosvenor after another riotous election.<br>
<br>Williams was instead returned for Beaumaris. Once seated he again worked unsuccessfully on a bill that would reimburse him the fine he had paid in 1686. After the assassination plot of 1696 he joined others in refusing to subscribe the new association oath declaring William the &#145;rightful and lawful&#146; king. Williams complained that if oaths were such an important security for the crown, then neither he nor anyone could have been justified in abandoning James. More to the point, he said he had once paid &pound;8000 for signing something in parliament; because of that, he would never subscribe anything there again. The king was not pleased and Williams was dismissed as king's counsel. He remained a thorn in the king's side when, true to old form, he strenuously opposed a bill reforming the militia as it would create a permanent tax to fund a standing army.<br>
<br>Now completely without political authority in Westminster or Chester, Williams died at his chambers in Gray's Inn on 10 July 1700 aged sixty-six and was buried in the church at Llansilin. He was survived by his wife, Margaret, who died in 1705, and was succeeded in the baronetcy by his son, William (<i>d</i>. 1740). A man of some dash and bravado, Williams was a marvellous orator, capable of galvanizing listeners in parliament or in the streets of Chester. He was a vigorous opponent both in court and out. As one observer noted, he was &#145;an obstinate competitor&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1672&#150;3</i>, 559); others remarked on his &#145;fiery and vicious temper&#146;  (Knights, 125). He was certainly a vain man: on being selected as speaker, instead of professing his unworthiness for so great an honour he explained the difficulty of the job and the subtlety required, suggesting that he was precisely the person to hold such an eminent position. Given his political apostasy in the reign of James II, many reviled him. Burnet called him &#145;a corrupt vicious man, who had no principles&#146;  (<span class="italic">Bishop Burnet's History</span>, 3.234). But he was a regular communicant of the Church of England, unsubstantiated rumours of 1687 that he had become a Catholic notwithstanding. In parliament he spent his entire career opposing standing armies and the higher taxes needed to fund them. He was a creative and energetic pleader, though at times he clearly strained law, logic, or both in trying to win his case. Resilient, even courageous, he possessed a good sense of humor, one that permitted self-deprecation&#151;a fine quality in one whose actions or words often shocked his contemporaries, even his friends.<br>
