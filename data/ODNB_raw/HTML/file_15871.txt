<span class="headword">Ladyman,  Samuel</span>  (1625/6&#150;1684), <span class="occ">Church of Ireland clergyman</span>, was probably born at Dinton, Buckinghamshire, the son of John Ladyman. Aged seventeen, Ladyman, a servitor, matriculated at Corpus Christi College, Oxford, on 3 March 1643, graduating BA on 13 July 1647. Appointed a fellow by the parliamentary visitors in 1648, he proceeded MA on 21 June 1649. According to Anthony Wood he began preaching in the Oxford area about this time, becoming well known in presbyterian circles. On 20 August 1652 the government allocated &pound;50 and &pound;20 respectively to Edward Wale and Ladyman, who were commissioned to go to Ireland with Charles Fleetwood as chaplains. They departed the next month, sailing from Bristol to Waterford. In Ireland, Ladyman became the minister at Clonmel, perhaps at the suggestion of Joseph Eyres, his friend and contemporary at Corpus Christi. Initially Ladyman received &pound;100 per annum at Clonmel, but in 1655 he was earning &pound;170. When Edward Worth founded the Cork Association in 1657, initially to ordain ministers but with the ultimate goal of imposing uniformity through a national church, Ladyman and Eyres participated. Henry Cromwell invited Ladyman and approximately thirty other clergymen to Dublin in the spring of 1658 to discuss church finances and other issues. With eighteen others Ladyman drafted an address to Cromwell in May, praising his support of protestantism and interest in settling clerical maintenance. Although Cromwell invited Ladyman to move to Dublin, he opted to remain at Clonmel.<br>
<br>Ladyman's only published work is <span class="italic">The Dangerous Rule</span> (1658), from a sermon preached at Clonmel before the Munster judges on 3 August 1657. In it he articulated the defining characteristic of his career, namely, the subordination of conscience to &#145;the guidance and superintendency of known Laws&#146;  (p. 8). Conscience, he argued, is defective, uncertain, and arbitrary unless guided by law, and it must therefore be subordinate to understanding. If the consciences of the few become a law for all, the result is tyranny. He pointed to Jan of Leyden and the Quakers as examples of what could happen if claims of conscience were pre-eminent, and he urged his readers to &#145;behold the Monstrosity &amp; rugged deformity of Conscience, when seated upon the Throne, as Queen Regent; whilst standing Laws are constrain'd to lie gasping under her Imperious Feet&#146;  (ibid., sig. a1<i>v</i>). Freedom of opinion, he warned, would lead to liberty in practice and the destruction of people's souls.<br>
<br>On the eve of the Restoration, Ladyman was one of the twenty highest-paid clergymen in Ireland, earning &pound;200 in 1659. He was now assisted at Clonmel by Galatius Hickey, formerly a minister in the diocese of Killaloe. True to his belief in the supremacy of law Ladyman conformed at the Restoration, remaining at Clonmel as vicar, though he did not undergo episcopal ordination until February 1665. Three years later as archdeacon of Limerick he was receiving &pound;120 per annum. By 1677 Dr Ladyman was prebendary of Cashel. His wife, Grace, daughter of Dr William Hutchinson of Oxford, whom Ladyman had married before 1655, had died in March 1663 or 1664. Three of their children, Samuel, Francis, and Grace, died in infancy, and the others died young&#151;John on 9 December 1675, aged twenty, and Jane on 27 September 1681, aged twenty-one. Following his own death in February 1684 Ladyman was interred in the chancel of St Mary's, Clonmel. By his will, he left &pound;5 per annum for the education of ten poor children, and &pound;5 per annum to be distributed in alms.<br>
