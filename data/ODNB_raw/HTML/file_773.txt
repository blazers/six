<span class="headword">Ashton <span class="st"> [Assheton]</span>, Sir  John</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1427), <span class="occ">soldier and administrator</span>, came of a gentry family which took its name from Ashton under Lyne in Lancashire, and which had estates there, as well as at Manchester, Wardle, and Alt in that county, and at Morley in Yorkshire. The son of another <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/772/', "Sir John Ashton (c.1354&#150;c.1398)")</script>, a servant of John of Gaunt, duke of Lancaster, whose career as a soldier took him at various times to France, Spain, Ireland, Scotland, and the Low Countries, and of his first wife, Joan, the daughter of William Radcliffe of Smithills in Lancashire, he followed his father into Lancastrian service during the 1380s, receiving an annual fee of &pound;20, and being dubbed a knight by Henry IV on the eve of his coronation. The new king's favour brought him such benefits as an additional annuity of &pound;10, a profitable wardship of lands in Lancashire and Lincolnshire, and the farm of the manor of Rothwell, Northamptonshire, at a reduced rent. His evident trustworthiness made Ashton an appropriate person to be several times a commissioner of array, and also to be appointed in May 1402 to take steps against the spread of treasonable rumours. In 1404 he became a JP for Lancashire, and in 1411 and 1413 he was elected to represent the county in parliament. He may have fought against the Welsh and the Scots during Henry IV's reign; he certainly served under Henry V in 1415 on the Agincourt campaign. Elected to parliament again in 1416, in the following year Ashton returned to France, where he was appointed seneschal of Bayeux in 1417 and <i>bailli</i> of the Cotentin in 1418, offices he held until 1421. During those years he was also sent three times on embassy to Brittany. After the death of Henry V he played less part in public life, beyond becoming a JP for Yorkshire as well as Lancashire. Ashton was married twice, first to Jane, daughter of Sir John Saville, with whom he had three sons (among them the alchemist <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/779/', "Sir Thomas Ashton (c.1403&#150;c.1460)")</script>) and eight daughters, and second to Margaret Gray, with whom he had a son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/776/', "Sir Ralph Ashton (c.1425&#150;1487x90)")</script>. Sir John Ashton died on 3 September 1427.<br>
