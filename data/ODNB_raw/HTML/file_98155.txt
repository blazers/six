<span class="headword">Tupper, Sir  Reginald Godfrey Otway</span>  (1859&#150;1945) <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, was born at 30 Nottingham Place, Marylebone, London, on 16 October 1859, the second son of Charles William Tupper (1818/19&#150;1881), an iron merchant and manufacturer who held the rank of captain in the Royal Fusiliers, and his wife, Letitia Frances (1821/2&#150;1908), daughter of Sir Jonah Wheeler-Cuffe, an Irish baronet. His elder brother was the Indian administrator and legal historian <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36577/', "Sir Charles Lewis Tupper")</script>.<br>
<br>Tupper joined the Royal Navy through the cadet training ship <i>Britannia</i> in 1873; his early career was solid rather than brilliant; he achieved only second-class certificates in navigation and gunnery, along with a first in seamanship. Serving on the Australian station under Admiral Sir George Tryon, in 1880&#150;82 he took part in punitive operations and developed local expertise. In the mid-1880s he studied at the naval gunnery school <i>Excellent</i>, before becoming an instructor at <i>Cambridge</i>, the Devonport gunnery school. He married, on 30 April 1888, Emily Charlotte Greer (1863/4&#150;1929), daughter of Lieutenant-General Henry Harpur Greer, of The Grange, Moy, co. Tyrone. They had three daughters.<br>
<br>Service on the East Indies station included the Vitu expedition of 1890, where Tupper worked with Captain Assheton Curzon-Howe, who became a significant figure in his subsequent career. Between 1891 and 1895 Tupper served on the China station, emphasizing his regional specialization. Returning to Britain in 1896, he conducted early trials of the newly developed destroyers before joining the naval intelligence division, the naval planning centre, between 1896 and 1899. Here he worked on the Spanish-American War of 1898, among other subjects. After two years on the Australian station, which included acting as deputy commissioner for the Western Pacific, Tupper attended the first Royal Navy war course at Greenwich, where he lectured on the Spanish-American War. He was promoted captain on 30 June 1901.<br>
<br>Discharged from the war course, in April 1902 Tupper served as secretary to the Camperdown committee, which recommended subsidizing merchant ships for use as auxiliary cruisers, resulting in the construction of the Cunard liners <i>Lusitania</i> and <i>Mauritania</i>. Tupper developed a friendship with the inquiry chairman, Robert Adam Philips Haldane Haldane-Duncan, third earl of Camperdown (1841&#150;1918). In 1903 he took command of the cruiser <i>Venus</i> in the Mediterranean, where he reverted to intelligence work, monitoring Russian activity in the Suez Canal during the Russo-Japanese War (1904&#150;5). Subsequently he commanded British naval forces policing civil disorder in Crete, a role he retained when he took command of the battleship <span class="italic">Prince of Wales</span> in July 1905.<br>
<br>In July 1907 Tupper became captain of the <i>Excellent</i>, the most prestigious command for a gunnery officer, a post he held for four years. He directed the gunnery trials of the dreadnought era, working on improved ammunition, fire control, and armour protection in close co-operation with his friend Rear-Admiral Sir John Jellicoe. He organized an impressive display of amphibious power for visiting Commonwealth leaders in 1909 and the naval gun carriage that carried King Edward VII's coffin at the state funeral, for which service he was appointed CVO. Promoted rear-admiral on 23 September 1910, Tupper escorted high-profile guests at George V's coronation fleet review in June 1911, and in November 1912 took command of the reserve squadrons of the Home Fleet, based at Portsmouth, for a year.<br>
<br>When war broke out in 1914 Tupper was on half pay, only returning to sea in January 1915, as senior naval officer auxiliary rear-admiral patrols. Based at Stornoway, he was tasked with securing the north-western approaches to the United Kingdom against enemy raiders and submarines. Having successfully discharged these duties Tupper was promoted vice-admiral on 26 January 1916.<br>
<br>On 6 March 1916 Tupper was appointed to the command of the 10th cruiser squadron, a force of armed merchant cruisers intercepting neutral ships attempting to evade the blockade of Germany, with his flag in the <i>Alsatian</i> (Captain Humphrey Smith). In October 1916 Tupper and Smith recommended convoying merchant shipping, but the Admiralty ignored their advice. In command, Tupper tightened up discipline, improved gunnery, and, critically, provided the leadership needed to maintain the morale and commitment of a force largely manned by reservists on a vital, but unglamorous, demanding, and dangerous mission, frequently conducted in appalling conditions. In April 1917 he was knighted KCB for his work, just as the entry of the United States into the war reduced the task.<br>
<br>In December 1917 Tupper took over the 2nd cruiser squadron, which conducted anti-U-boat patrols over the northern minefield barrage, between Scotland and Norway. He hauled down his flag in August 1918 when his command was reduced, and went on half pay. In April 1919 he relieved Admiral Sir Lewis Bayly as commander-in-chief western approaches, based at Queenstown, now Cobh, in Ireland, a post he held for two years. Presiding over the break-up of the United Kingdom was painful for a man with his Anglo-Irish background and imperial service ethic. It was his last naval appointment. In May 1921, a month after leaving Cobh, Tupper voluntarily retired, to make way for younger officers. In 1923 he was appointed GBE.<br>
<br>In retirement Tupper found outlets for his energy, as chairman of the council of the Royal United Services Institute, and with the British Fascisti, an aristocratic right-wing group. In 1929 Tupper published his <span class="italic">Reminiscences</span>, a slightly unreliable compilation of charming vignettes. After the death of his first wife he married second, on 24 June 1933, Caroline Maud Abadie (1863&#150;1948), the widow of General Sir Henry Richard Abadie; she was the daughter of Colonel Fanshawe Gostling, of the Royal Berkshire regiment. In 1935 Tupper received a good service pension. In 1939, aged eighty, he volunteered his services to the Admiralty, but the offer was not taken up. He died, of pulmonary oedema, at 22 Draycott Place, Chelsea, London, on 5 March 1945.<br>
<br>Characteristically Tupper avoided taking sides in the vicious controversies that split the service in the Edwardian decade, having good friends in both camps. A member of the masonic naval lodge, he was nicknamed &#145;Holy Reggie&#146; by his sailors in the First World War and was considered a martinet. Tupper was a thoroughly professional sea officer. While he remained devoted to the class distinctions that had shaped the late Victorian navy, his gunnery expertise, intelligence work, and colonial administration demonstrated impressive intellectual range and depth, while his outstanding wartime leadership was based on mastery of the human factor in warfare.<br>
