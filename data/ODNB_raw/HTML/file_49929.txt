<span class="headword">Poett, Sir  (Joseph Howard) Nigel</span>  (1907&#150;1991), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was born on 20 August 1907 at Kew House, Winterbourne St Martin, near Dorchester, the only son among the five children (the youngest girl was his twin) of Major-General Joseph Howard Poett (1858&#150;1929), army officer, and his wife, Julia Baldwin Caswell of Rhode Island, USA. On Joseph Poett's retirement from the army the family moved to farming in British Columbia, where they remained until the early part of 1914. They arrived in London shortly before the outbreak of the First World War and Nigel began formal education at preparatory school and then, as a member of a Roman Catholic family, entered Downside School.<br>
<br>Tall and strong, keen to learn in the classroom, Poett gained in confidence through considerable success at games. Modest, open, and good-humoured, he got on well with his peers and schoolmasters alike. Indeed if he had a fault it was aimlessness; he had no interest in any profession. If pressed he spoke vaguely of entering a university. His headmaster judged otherwise and urged Nigel to enter the army. In January 1926 he reported as a gentleman cadet to the Royal Military College, Sandhurst.<br>
<br>Cadet life seemed to Poett like life at Downside. Even his posting as a subaltern in 1927 with the 1st battalion of his regiment, the Durham light infantry, in Alexandria, did not break wholly that association. Playing games and shooting wildfowl occupied many hours of an officer's day. Early in 1930, however, he was sent to the 2nd battalion, then at Razmak on the notoriously rebellious north-west frontier of India. The task of &#145;showing the flag&#146;, involving picketing heights to outmanoeuvre local skirmishers, took precedence over everything else, even sports. Garrison duties in Calcutta followed, in which social activities intruded. Poett passed through this as an auxiliary aide-de-camp and member of the army staff, intermittently as battalion machine-gun officer, and finally as adjutant, principal assistant to and confidant of his commanding officer. The maturing of his talents over ten years augured well for the future. While on local leave he became engaged to Julia, daughter of E. J. Herrick of Hawkes Bay, New Zealand; after a year of regimental duties they were married on 26 May 1937. They had two sons and a daughter.<br>
<br>Poett passed the entrance examination for the Staff College, Camberley, in 1936 and began the course in 1938. War cut this short. Now a major, Poett was sent to the policy co-ordination branch of the general staff but, in the expectation of invasion in 1940, succeeded in joining a beach defence division. When the German offensive strategy broke instead upon Russia the War Office demanded his return. Soon he was promoted and drawn into Cabinet Office work. Restless for active service, he secured command of the 11th battalion of his regiment in 1942. Within a year he was selected a brigade commander. General Gale, raising the new 6th airborne division, chose Poett to command the 5th Parachute brigade as much for his physical as for his military talent.<br>
<br>The brigade consisted principally of the 7th, 12th, and 13th battalions forming up from volunteers, to whom parachuting was a novelty. Brigadier Poett inspired his command to throw themselves into making ready for a crucial role in the forthcoming assault into France. Aimlessness had long passed from him. His open nature and enthusiasm fired his soldiers. He pondered ways and means of enhancing airborne warfare. Anticipating that his troops might be scattered on landing he decided to drop himself with the reconnaissance and <i>coup de main</i> parties, in case it became necessary to rebalance his plans. It was a risky decision. From the moment of landing he maintained the practice of being in the midst of events from the battles in Normandy, through the Ardennes offensive at the end of 1944, and across the Rhine in May 1945. Some thought he toured his foremost lines too often; shellfire seemed to follow him. But his forces knew that he shared their perils and he led them in this way to the war's end on the Baltic.<br>
<br>Poett emerged from the war in Europe with a high reputation as a field commander and a staff officer. He had been awarded a DSO and bar, and the United States Silver Star. He was of the right age among his peers to be retained in his rank when others were retired or reduced to lower ranks. He was thus marked for further promotion. In the meantime, the 5th Parachute brigade was dispatched to join the war in the Far East, expecting to fight the Japanese. The armistice overtook them. Anxious not to be disposed in garrison duties, Poett persuaded the army commander to employ the brigade in an active role. It was sent to maintain internal security between the Dutch colonial authorities and Sukarno's nationalist forces in Semarang, a task which required as much political as military judgement. While this continued Poett was posted home in February 1946 to be director of plans in the War Office.<br>
<br>Politics were never far from his remaining posts in the army. He passed from the War Office in 1948 to be deputy commander to the British military mission in Greece during 1949 and chief of staff in the Far East from 1950 to 1952, and to command of the 3rd division in the Suez Canal. After returning to the War Office as director of military operations in 1954 he became commandant of the Staff College in 1957, general officer commanding southern command in 1958, and commander-in-chief of Far East land forces (1961&#150;3). He was made knight commander of the Bath in 1959. He was persistent, as the army passed through successive reorganizations, in pressing his peers to take account of their own errors of judgement as they reshaped their policies. In this he had very much in mind what he reckoned to be his own failure to press for a quick military response to the blocking of the Suez Canal&#151;a Parachute brigade and Royal Marine commandos should have been used at once instead of waiting months for the arrival of a British corps, &#145;all due to being overawed by the opposition&#146;, as he remarked. When the Azahari uprising was attempted in Brunei during his command in the Far East he was advised that it would be necessary to gather a major force to suppress the rebels. But the force would take two or three months to assemble. Poett declined to lose the potential advantages of surprise and speed. Though he lacked a close reserve, a commander and staff were taken from his own headquarters to back a fighting core of Ghurkas. Made ready in a few days, they were flown in quickly to Brunei and routed Azahari's followers.<br>
<br>After retirement Poett became a member (and later director) of the British Productivity Council, but his main interest lay in working for and congregating with the soldiers with whom he had served&#151;in the Durham light infantry, whose colonel he became, and with the Parachute regiment and airborne forces. His wife, ever ready to &#145;follow the drum&#146;, accompanied him often on these visits. They fostered the relationships between the veterans of the 6th airborne division and the French armed forces, and continued to do so even after Nigel Poett was stricken by illness. He died at his home, Swaynes Mead, Great Durnford, Salisbury, Wiltshire, on 29 October 1991, survived by his wife and children. His memoirs, <span class="italic">Pure Poett</span>, were published later that year.<br>
