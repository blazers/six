<span class="headword">Littledale,  Richard Frederick</span>  (1833&#150;1890), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and religious controversialist</span>, the fourth son of John Littledale, auctioneer of Dublin, was born there on 14 September 1833. On 15 October 1850 he entered Trinity College, Dublin, as a foundation scholar, graduated BA as a first class in classics, and in 1855 obtained the senior Berkeley gold medal and the first divinity prize. He proceeded at Dublin MA in 1858, and LLB and LLD in 1862, and at Oxford on 5 July 1862 DCL <i>comitatis causa</i>. He was curate of St Matthew in Thorpe Hamlet, Norfolk, from 1856 to 1857, and from 1857 to 1861 curate of St Mary the Virgin, Crown Street, Soho, London, where he took a great interest in the House of Charity. For the rest of his life he suffered from chronic ill health, performed few parochial duties, and devoted himself mainly to writing.<br>
<br>Littledale was a significant controversialist, becoming a leading exponent of ritualism in the Church of England in the 1860s and 1870s. In a series of pamphlets and lectures he argued that the Tractarian movement was ripe for a further advance, specifically in terms of ceremonial practice. In pamphlets such as <span class="italic">The Real Presence</span> (n.d.) and <span class="italic">The Christian Sacrifice</span> (n.d.) he asserted that Tractarian eucharistic doctrine had reached a point where its visible expression in ceremonial had become essential. In <span class="italic">The Law of Ritual</span> (n.d.) he further claimed a legal basis for this, arguing that all pre-Reformation uses were legal unless specifically repealed. In <span class="italic">The North Side of the Altar</span> (1865) legalistic complexity led him into a detailed examination of the precise meaning of such terms as &#145;side&#146; and &#145;end&#146; of the communion table. A further line of argument developed from his long association with John Mason Neale (1818&#150;1866), namely that the restoration of church buildings led inevitably to a desire for a more elaborate ceremonial, a point he first made in <span class="italic">On the Application of Colour to the Decoration of Churches</span> (1857) and repeated in <span class="italic">Ritualists not Romanists</span> (1876).<br>
<br>Yet despite Littledale's claim that the ritualists were the inheritors of the Tractarians, he never gained the support of all the clergy of that older generation. Some of them, such as William Gresley, William Butler, and Thomas Stevens, were deeply concerned that country parishioners were unprepared for such elaborate ceremonial. The parishes most influenced by Littledale's theories were mainly in London and other urban centres with more sophisticated congregations. As ritualistic practices spread among them, so the controversy they aroused extended throughout the Church of England and beyond, leading to royal commissions sitting from 1867, and finally to the <span class="roman">Public Worship Regulation Act</span> of 1874 and the prosecution of ritualist clergy that followed.<br>
<br>Another area of controversy in which Littledale engaged was the defence of Anglicanism against the claims of Rome following the declaration of papal infallibility in 1870. His arguments were elaborated in a series of works such as <span class="italic">An Inner View of the Vatican Council</span> (1877), <span class="italic">Why Ritualists do not Become Roman Catholics</span> (1878), <span class="italic">Plain Reasons for not Joining the Church of Rome</span> (1880), <span class="italic">Words for Truth: Replies to Roman Cavils Against the Church of England</span> (1888), and <span class="italic">The Petrine Claims: a Critical Inquiry</span> (1889). For Littledale the revival of Catholic doctrine and ceremonial in the Church of England, combined with what he saw as unauthorized additions to the faith by Rome, made conversion both unnecessary and morally dubious.<br>
<br>Littledale also collaborated with other authors, most notably John Mason Neale in the <span class="italic">Liturgy of SS Mark, James, Clement, Chrysostom, Basil</span> (1868&#150;9), and after Neale's death in 1866 he completed the <span class="italic">Commentary on the Psalms from Primitive and Mediaeval Writers</span> (vols. 2, 3, and 4, 1868&#150;74), and later re-edited two other editions of the entire work. With James Edward Vaux he wrote <span class="italic">The Priest's Prayer Book</span> (1864), <span class="italic">The People's Hymnal</span> (1867), <span class="italic">The Christian Passover</span> (1873), and <span class="italic">The Altar Manual</span> (n.d.). Littledale was also a noted confessor, and it was claimed that he had heard more confessions than any other priest in the Church of England apart from Pusey.<br>
<br>Littledale died on 11 January 1890, at his home, 9 Red Lion Square, London. A reredos to his memory was erected in the chapel at St Katherine's, 32 Queen Square, London, in March 1891.<br>
