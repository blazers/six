<span class="headword">Fitzalan, Sir  Brian</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1306), <span class="occ">baron</span>, was descended from a younger branch of the counts of Brittany and earls of Richmond and has been described as &#145;an English baron of more reputation than fortune&#146;  (Barrow, <span class="italic">Bruce</span>, 35). Following participation in the Welsh war of 1282, and also attendance at a royal council held at Gloucester in 1287, Fitzalan was given custody of the castles of Forfar, Dundee, Roxburgh, and Jedburgh during the adjudication of the Great Cause, holding them from 1291 until 1292. In 1291, also, he was elevated to the position of guardian of Scotland, to work beside the Scottish guardians, and along with Sir John Comyn (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1302) of Badenoch and the bishop of St Andrews he received the fealties of the Scottish nobility at Perth. As an auditor in the Great Cause, Fitzalan duly surrendered the documentation relating to his office to John de Balliol when the latter became king. Sir Brian then returned to his career as an English baron, receiving a summons to fight against the Welsh in 1294 and attending the English parliament of 1295. Since his lands were mostly in the honour of Richmond, Fitzalan's regular calls to parliament are indicative of his usefulness to the government, rather than of his status as such.<br>
<br>Although he held no office in Edward's government of Scotland instituted in 1296, Fitzalan found himself almost constantly occupied in the north after the resumption of war in 1297. Despite a summons to go to Flanders with the king, he was appointed captain of royal fortifications in Northumberland on 12 July 1297 in expectation of a Scottish attack. On 29 July, however, he was offered the post of lieutenant of Scotland, a position eschewed by the earl of Surrey, the current incumbent. On 4 August Fitzalan wrote to the king, effectively turning down the offer for lack of an income sufficient to sustain the required retinue of fifty armed men and their horses. Surrey had received, or was supposed to receive, &pound;1333 13<i>s</i>. 4<i>d</i>., but Fitzalan was being offered a mere &pound;1128. Nevertheless, the English regency evidently regarded the matter as settled, issuing letters patent to Fitzalan as lieutenant on 18 August; on the 28th all the sheriffs north of the Trent were ordered to help him in his new office.<br>
<br>Although the receiver in the north of England, Robert Beaufey, received &pound;200 from Fitzalan as &#145;keeper of the said kingdom&#146;  (TNA: PRO, E159/71, m. 102), the latter did not go north until news of Surrey's defeat at Stirling Bridge reached London. On 1 November he and others were thanked by the regency for their efforts to protect the north of England against forays made by the victorious Scots. Fitzalan again occupied the post of captain of royal fortifications in Northumberland and he remained as such throughout 1297 and 1298. He certainly fought at Falkirk, but was not one of those summoned from Berwick to come to a secret meeting at York on Scottish affairs in April 1298. The resumption of war meant that there was no further need for the office of lieutenant; the position was not filled again until 1305, when most Scots had submitted to King Edward once more.<br>
<br>Fitzalan himself fought against the Scots in 1299, 1300, and, for the last time, in 1303. He died in 1306, before he could attend parliament for the knighting of Prince Edward. He and his wife, Matilda, had two daughters, Matilda (or Agnes) and Catherine, his coheirs.<br>
