<span class="headword">Masson,  (George Joseph) Gustave</span>  (1819&#150;1888), <span class="occ">French scholar and teacher</span>, was born in London on 9 March 1819, the son of Emile Masson, who served under Napoleon and having survived the retreat from Moscow lived in exile in London where he met and married Masson's English mother. Gustave Masson received his primary and secondary education in Tours. As the eldest son of a highly decorated officer's widow Masson was, ironically enough, exempted from military service, but he quickly developed into a precocious scholar and earned the diploma of <i>bachelier-&egrave;s-lettres</i> at the Universit&eacute; de France in August 1837 when he was still only eighteen years old. On completion of his studies Masson embarked on a decade of intense but ultimately futile literary struggle in Paris. On 26 September 1844 he married Janet, daughter of George Clarke. They had two sons and two daughters. In 1847, with his resources at an end, Masson accepted an invitation to cross the channel and serve as private tutor to a wealthy family in Harrow, Middlesex. The decision to settle in Harrow was a fortuitous one and it was followed, in 1855, by Masson's appointment as French master at the renowned Harrow School. Over the next thirty-three years Masson proved an able administrator, a beloved teacher, and an innovative librarian (of the Vaughan Library), who balanced his official duties with an ambitious scholarly agenda that ranged from the middle ages to the nineteenth century, but placed emphasis on articulating the development and main contours of modern French literature.<br>
<br>Indeed, Masson was a critic, editor, translator, lexicographer, linguist, textbook compiler, and journalist on a prodigious scale, whose chief works on French literature, language, and history include <span class="italic">Introduction to the History of French Literature</span> (1860), <span class="italic">La lyre Fran&ccedil;aise</span> (an anthology in the <span class="roman">Golden Treasury</span> series, 1867), <span class="italic">A Compendious Dictionary of the French Language</span> (1874), <span class="italic">Outlines of French Literature</span> (1877), <span class="italic">Early Chronicles of Europe: France</span> (1879), <span class="italic">The Huguenots: a Sketch of their History</span> (1881), <span class="italic">French Literature</span> (1888), and <span class="italic">Medieval France from Hugues Capet to the Sixteenth Century</span> (1888). In addition, Masson published original monographs of Richelieu (1884) and Mazarin (1886), and numerous successful school and university editions of French classics, including Moli&egrave;re, Racine, Corneille, Madame de S&eacute;vign&eacute;, Voltaire, Regnard, Musset, Victor Hugo, George Sand, and Germaine de Sta&euml;l (Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1867&#150;80). In terms of scope, lucidity, and contemporary importance, Masson's contributions to French studies in Victorian England may be compared to Thomas Carlyle's and George Saintsbury's construction, respectively, of German and English literary history during the same period.<br>
<br>While engaged in producing a vast and, for its time, innovative body of scholarship for specialists and valuable study aids for students and pupils, Masson was also a frequent contributor to <span class="italic">The Athenaeum</span> and the regular reviewer of French literature for the <span class="italic">Saturday Review</span> from 1872 to 1880. He gave up his Harrow mastership in 1888 and died a few weeks later on 29 August at Woodlands, Tooting Common, Streatham, Surrey, while on a visit to his good friend Sir Henry Doulton. Masson was buried in Harrow churchyard. He was survived by his wife and four children.<br>
