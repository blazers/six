<span class="headword">Seeman <span class="st"> [Zeeman]</span>,  Enoch</span>  (1689/90&#150;1744), <span class="occ">portrait painter</span>, was born at Danzig in Germany, where his father, of Flemish origin, Enoch Seeman (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1661), was settled as a painter. It is possible that the famous German virtuoso painter Balthasar Denner, who received some of his early instruction in painting at Danzig, may have been a pupil of Seeman's father, for some of Seeman's early paintings were executed in imitation of Denner's highly detailed style, including a self-portrait at the age of nineteen.<br>
<br>In 1704 Seeman was taken by his father to London, and practised there as a portrait painter with great success. He resided in St Martin's Lane, and at first styled himself Enoch Seeman, junior. His earliest known portrait, <span class="italic">Colonel Bissett and his Family</span> (Forbes Castle, Aberdeenshire), inscribed &#145;Enoch Seeman pinx. AE 18&frac12; 1708&#146;  (Allen, 352) was painted by more than one hand. He was probably helped in its execution by members of his family. Seeman's portraits or portrait groups were sometimes on a very large scale, such as the family group <span class="italic">Lady Cust and Nine Children</span> (1743) at Belton House, Grantham, his last recorded work. Seeman frequently painted his own portrait. An example of 1716 is in the British Museum, and was engraved by J. G. Schmidt. Another, with his daughter in boys' clothes, was at Strawberry Hill, Twickenham. A portrait by him of Sir Isaac Newton, formerly in the possession of Thomas Hollis FSA, was engraved in mezzotint by J. MacArdell. From 1717 Seeman received royal patronage, and painted a full-length portrait of George I (Middle Temple, London). He also painted George II and other members of the royal family. Another attributed work (<i>c</i>.1711&#150;20) is a dual portrait of the first duke of Marlborough and the military engineer John Armstrong, now at Blenheim Palace, Oxfordshire.<br>
<br>Seeman died suddenly in St Martin's Lane, London, in March 1744. His son, Paul Seeman, painted portraits and still life, and his three brothers were all painters, one of whom, Isaac Seeman, died in London on 4 April 1751. The name is sometimes, but erroneously, spelt Zeeman. Further works by Seeman are in the National Portrait Gallery, London; Yale University Art Gallery, New Haven, Connecticut; the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York; Dunham Massey, Cheshire; Belton House, Lincolnshire; and Dalkeith House, near Edinburgh.<br>
