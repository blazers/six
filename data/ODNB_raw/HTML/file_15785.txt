<span class="headword">Knox,  John</span>  (1720&#150;1790), <span class="occ">bookseller and economic improver</span>, was born in Scotland; details of his parents are unknown. About Knox's early life before he moved to London to become a successful bookseller in the Strand, or his domestic circumstances, almost nothing is known. His London business was well established by the 1760s, and to his staples of selling and dealing in books he added some publishing, including in 1767 a seven-volume <span class="italic">New Collection of Voyages and Travels</span>, prepared (or so his preface alleged) not because he thought the work would be likely to sell, but &#145;because it was wanting&#146;  (<span class="italic">Monthly Review</span>, 37, 1767, 57). Another venture with which he was closely associated was William Guthrie's popular <span class="italic">New System of Commercial Geography</span>, the first edition of which appeared in 1770. Although there is no internal corroboration&#151;the frontispiece merely states that it was &#145;Printed for J. Knox&#146;&#151;he is said to have been the real compiler of this work  (Watt, <span class="italic">Bibl. Brit.</span>, 1824, 1.453). In the section on Scotland there are certainly themes with which Knox was to be closely identified, such as the value of fishing to the north, a cause which in later life he made his own. Though resident in London, Knox retained the strongest connections with his native Scotland, especially, it seems, in the Clyde area at Old Kilpatrick in Dunbartonshire; the minister there, John Davidson, was one of the two executors of his will. Among the beneficiaries was a stepson, John Morrison, also resident there. Davidson and Knox may have shared similar politics, with both being seen as pro-American because of their opposition to the war with the American colonists. Knox's contribution to the cause is thought to have included a pamphlet, published in 1777, <span class="italic">The American Crisis</span>  (T. R. Adams, <span class="italic">The American Controversy</span>, 1980).<br>
<br>There had been for many decades an established community of expatriate Scots in London: linen factors, bankers, and the like. But it was with the Highland Society of London, established in 1778, that Knox formed particularly strong links, channelling his time, abilities, and moneys into acquiring first-hand knowledge of conditions in northern Scotland. He made a series of tours from 1764 onwards to both the west and east coasts of Scotland, sixteen times in twenty-three years, a formidable undertaking in an era when travel in remote areas was still difficult. His journey in the autumn of 1786, published in the following year as <span class="italic">A Tour through the Highlands of Scotland and the Hebride Isles</span>, showed how the sea-crossings by open boat at that season of the year were especially hazardous. Nor was travel on foot much safer in the far north. As Knox wryly remarked, Sutherland with its bogs and precipices was a country where the traveller needed to climb like a goat and jump like a grasshopper. In 1784 appeared his <span class="italic">View of the British Empire, More Especially Scotland</span>, which argued&#151;understandably&#151;that transport links in the highlands had to be improved, and advocated the construction of what became the Crinan and Caledonian canals.<br>
<br>Knox became known as an expert on the possibilities for fishing, and, to draw on his expertise, the Highland Society of London invited him in March 1786 to lecture on his schemes for some forty planned fishing settlements from Dornoch to Arran. Knox's ideas, which were quickly rushed into print under the title <span class="italic">Observations on the Northern Fisheries</span>, were much in vogue that year. There was a general context of anxiety about how to retain a productive population in the highlands, the region being seen not as a haven for rebels, as it once had been, but as an essential reservoir of seamen and soldiers. While linen had been tried, fishing appeared to offer much more potential. Parliament took an active interest, with Knox giving expert evidence to a House of Commons committee on the British fisheries. The committee's findings gave rise to legislation, including a premium per barrel of herring caught, as well as a tonnage bounty on fishing boats. A private joint-stock company, the British Fisheries Society, was formed to buy land in the north for lease to fishermen and curers. When the list opened at London in May 1786, Knox was among the first subscribers, and he was also active later that year in Scotland, helping to raise additional capital. He was commissioned by the society to make the tour mentioned above in October 1786, and recognition of its value came in the form of a gold medal for Knox, support for its publication, and the implementation of many of his recommendations, such as the choice of Ullapool and Tobermory as suitable places to locate fishing stations.<br>
<br>But Knox's attention was not solely focused on fisheries. His travels in the north had made him aware of the growing enthusiasm for Scotland as a tourist destination, a market into which he intended to tap: &#145;Travelling through the Northern parts of our island, besides being conducive to health, has now become a fashionable amusement during the summer and harvest months&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 59.326). In November 1789 Knox announced a scheme for a complete set of Scottish scenic and architectural views. Some preliminary work had already taken place on his proposed book <span class="italic">The Picturesque Scenery of Scotland</span>, for which the artist Joseph Farrington, who was in Edinburgh during July 1788, had made the first sketch of a view of Edinburgh Castle. However, the project was abandoned following Knox's death, at Dalkeith, on 1 August 1790.<br>
