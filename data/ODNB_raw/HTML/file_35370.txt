<span class="headword">Palmer, Sir  Elwin Mitford</span>  (1852&#150;1906), <span class="occ">colonial official</span>, was born in London on 3 March 1852, the second son of Edward Palmer and Caroline, daughter of Colonel Gunthorpe. After education at Lancing College, he entered the finance department of the government of India in 1870, becoming assistant comptroller-general in November 1871. In 1881 he married Mary Augusta Lynch, daughter of Major Herbert Clogstoun VC, with whom he had a son and two daughters. Palmer was seconded briefly to Egypt between 31 December 1878 and 30 April 1879, during the period when the Egyptian khedive sought to reassure the European powers that he would carry through an extensive programme of financial reconstruction. Subsequently, on 16 August 1885, three years after the British occupation, Palmer succeeded Sir Gerald Fitzgerald as director-general of accounts in Egypt. Fitzgerald and Palmer were largely responsible for creating a modern system of public accounts in Egypt. Palmer was created CMG in 1888. In the following year he succeeded Sir Edgar Vincent as financial adviser to the Egyptian government, a key position in the &#145;veiled protectorate&#146; which Evelyn Baring had created after 1883. As financial adviser, Palmer played a major role in the conversion of parts of Egypt's public debt (the Daira and domains loans) and was closely concerned with the contract for the construction of the Aswan Reservoir. When the National Bank of Egypt was set up in 1898, Palmer resigned as financial adviser to become its first governor. In the same year he became the chairman of the Cairo committee of the Daira Sanieh Company, which had taken over from the government the management of the <i>daira</i> or private estates of Isma&#145;il Pasha. In 1902, he was appointed president of the Agricultural Bank of Egypt, an offshoot of the National Bank.<br>
<br>Palmer was a shrewd, hard-working man, with long financial training and wide knowledge of accounts; his expertise lay more in public finance than in general administration. The later part of his career was occupied in the commercial development stimulated by Egypt's return to solvency, its buoyant cotton exports and the irrigation and drainage works promoted by British officials. Palmer was made KCMG in 1892, KCB in 1897, and held the grand cordons of the orders of Osmanieh and Mejidiye (conferred formally by the Ottoman sultan). He died in Cairo on 28 January 1906.<br>
