<span class="headword">Arber <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Robertson]</span>,  Agnes</span>  (1879&#150;1960), <span class="occ">botanist</span>, was born at 26 Regent's Park Road, London, on 23 February 1879, the eldest child of Henry Robert Robertson (1839&#150;1921), an artist, and Agnes Lucy Turner, a descendant of Robert Chamberlain (<i>d</i>. 1798), ceramicist, of Worcester. Her brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35777/', "Donald Struan Robertson (1885&#150;1961)")</script> became regius professor of Greek at Cambridge University (1928&#150;50) and her sister Janet, a painter.<br>
<br>Agnes Robertson entered formal education at the age of eight and attended the North London Collegiate School for Girls, run by Frances Mary Buss, a leading proponent of education for girls. While at school Agnes came into contact with Ethel Sargant, in whose private, home-based laboratory she later worked during vacations. On leaving school Agnes commenced a degree course at University College, London (UCL), where she was one of many women students to study under Francis Wall Oliver. Agnes Robertson was awarded a first-class honours degree prior to winning an entrance scholarship to Newnham College, Cambridge, in 1899. Women were not awarded degrees by Cambridge University until 1948, but Robertson did achieve a further first-class pass in the natural sciences tripos in 1902.<br>
<br>After working for a year in Sargant's laboratory Robertson returned to UCL, funded by a Quain studentship, and was awarded a DSc for her research. In 1908 she was, in addition, appointed to a lectureship alongside Oliver, Arthur Tansley, and Marie Stopes. However, the following year she left UCL to marry Edward Alexander Newell Arber (1870&#150;1918), on 5 August, and join him in Cambridge, where he was demonstrator in the department of geology. He was the son of Edward Arber, emeritus professor of English literature. The couple had one child, Muriel Agnes (<i>b</i>. 1913), who became a teacher and geologist.<br>
<br>Arber's research centred on the form of plants, both living and fossil specimens, for its own sake, and the light this could shed on subjects such as classification and evolution. The main body of her work (which in total included seventy scientific articles and four morphology books) was on the form of the major groups of flowering living plants. Her publications were characterized by distinctive diagrams and a thorough grounding in the history and philosophy of botany. Though allied to the &#145;new botany&#146; of the late nineteenth century, Arber's comparative studies of plant form contrast with both the ecological and the mechanistic approaches that grew out of the new botany.<br>
<br>The philosophy of plant form not only underpinned Arber's laboratory but was also reflected in a range of historical and philosophical publications (including four books) which have perhaps had a wider and more enduring impact. The first of these was <span class="italic">Herbals: their Origin and Evolution</span> (1912), which looks back to the origins of botany. One of her later books, <span class="italic">The Mind and the Eye: a Study of the Biologist's Standpoint</span> (1954), sets out a methodology for biological science. It is based on Arber's own research, which integrated detailed morphological studies with reflection on broader philosophical issues, such as Goethe's ideas on plant forms and archetypes.<br>
<br>At UCL, Agnes Arber had worked with those who would go on to hold the most prestigious academic posts in British botany. Though well integrated into the professional botanical community through publication and educational background, she carried on her research work outside the expanding laboratories of a university. From 1910 to 1927 she worked in the Balfour Laboratory of Newnham College, one of the two women's colleges in Cambridge.<br>
<br>The Balfour Laboratory was set up in 1884 with funds from Newnham students and benefactors to provide for the practical scientific education of the students of Newnham. Women were then not permitted to attend practical classes in the Cambridge University laboratories, though they were admitted to lectures alongside male students. During and after the First World War women were gradually admitted to practicals and due to the resulting fall in fee income the Balfour Laboratory went into decline. Arber continued to work in the Balfour, for much of the time unfunded, until in 1927 its sale to Cambridge University was finally completed, though not without acrimony. Professor Albert Seward, head of the botany school, offered Arber space in the botanic gardens (then not a research site) but she turned this down, preferring to set up a laboratory at home.<br>
<br>Despite involvement early on in her career in the institutions and societies of the botanical establishment, Arber's later contact hints at a similar detachment to that shown by lack of institutional affiliation. Arber was active, before and after her marriage, in the botanical section (Section K) of the British Association for the Advancement of Science (BAAS) and was a fellow of the Linnean Society. Such was her standing that in 1921 she was appointed to the prestigious post of president of Section K. However, shortly after accepting this honour she was persuaded by Professor Seward to tender her resignation on the grounds that a certain portion of the male botanical community would not welcome a second female president the year after it had appointed its first, Edith Rebecca Saunders.<br>
<br>The failure of the Royal Society to accept women as fellows until 1945 may have delayed further recognition of Arber's contribution to botany. However, in 1946 she was elected as fellow, only the third woman to be admitted to this prestigious scientific institution, and the first female life scientist to be awarded this honour. Her nomination was signed by many of the leading figures of British botany who cited her philosophical critique as well as her exact morphological studies as being important contributions to science. Arber died on 22 March 1960 at the Hope Nursing Home, Cambridge, and was buried at Girton.<br>
