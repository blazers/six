<span class="headword">Ball,  Robert</span>  (1802&#150;1857), <span class="occ">naturalist</span>, was born at Cobh, co. Cork, on 1 April 1802, the elder son of Robert Stawell Ball (1768&#150;1841), a customs official, and Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Green, of Youghal. His younger sisters were Anne Elizabeth Ball and <a href="#cosubject_56447">Mary Ball [<i>see below</i>]</a>; he also had a younger brother, Bent. He was educated at the notable Quaker school at Ballitore, co. Kildare, where James White encouraged his zoological studies. Leaving school at sixteen, Robert soon moved with his family to Youghal and, with his sisters, actively observed and recorded local flora and fauna. Having taken much interest in public and charitable institutions, he became a local magistrate about 1823. His desire to study medicine was precluded by family finances and he moved to Dublin, where, from 1827 to 1852, he was employed as assistant librarian and keeper of records in the under-secretary's office. In 1837 he married Amelia Gresley Hellicar of Bristol; among their seven children was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30566/', "Robert Stawell Ball")</script>, astronomer. Although highly praised for his exemplary work in Dublin, Ball's interest in science was an obvious distraction, and in 1852 he was retired owing to the fact that he had &#145;devoted much attention to scientific pursuits, and that it was not expedient that public servants should be thus occupied&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>). Nevertheless, he received a pension of &pound;800 per annum which allowed the family to live in moderate comfort.<br>
<br>Ball's spare time indeed had been devoted to natural history pursuits. His holidays were zoological expeditions, frequently with William Thompson of Belfast, to whose publications, especially <span class="italic">The Natural History of Ireland</span>, he added numerous details. Highly respected in Dublin's scientific life, Ball became a council member of the Royal Irish Academy and other societies and president of both the Geological Society of Ireland and Dublin University Zoological Association. As secretary of the Zoological Society of Ireland he put forward ingenious ideas which developed its exhibits, gardens, and programmes in innovative directions. He introduced the penny admission for the working classes and &#145;zoo breakfasts&#146; for members in 1844. In the same year he was appointed director of Trinity College Museum to which his large natural history collection of mainly Irish specimens was donated; he was awarded an honorary LLD in 1850. Further appointments came as secretary of the Queen's University in Ireland (1851), secretary to the joint committee of lectures (1854), and assistant examiner to the civil service commission (1855). However, other accolades were to come in 1857 when he was proposed as a fellow of the Royal Society, as &#145;the Inventor or Improver of the Naturalists' Dredge. Distinguished for his acquaintance with the science of Practical Zoology, Eminent as a Promoter of Natural Science&#146;. That same year he was appointed president elect of the British Association's natural history section for the Dublin meeting, but on 30 March 1857 he died, probably of a heart attack, at his home, 3 Granby Row, Rutland Square, Dublin, and both honours were denied him. He was buried at Mount Jerome cemetery, Dublin. In private life Ball's social qualities and honourable nature were highly esteemed, and he enlivened many a children's party. His scientific papers on Irish zoology, ranging from seals and cephalopods to fossil Irish elk, bear, and oxen remains, were published mainly in the <span class="italic">Proceedings</span> and <span class="italic">Transactions</span> of the Royal Irish Academy, the <span class="italic">Proceedings of the Zoological Society</span>, the <span class="italic">Annals of Natural History</span>, and the <span class="italic">Natural History Review</span>.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_56445"></a><span class="headword">Anne Elizabeth Ball</span>  (1808&#150;1872), <span class="occ">algologist</span>, and the elder of Robert Ball's sisters, was born at Cobh. About 1818 she moved with the family to Youghal, and there, when she was in her early twenties, she started to collect and study marine algae. From 1837 she collected algae from around Dublin, where she had gone to live with her sister and father.<br>
<br>Anne Ball became a most successful algologist. As was then customary, her work was published by male naturalists such as William Henry Harvey, James Mackay, and others. As the elder sister she was conventionally cited in publications as Miss Ball, as distinct from her sister who was cited as Miss M. Ball. Although not a member of the Dublin scientific societies, Anne Ball benefited greatly from Robert's support and his friendship with many notable naturalists. William Harvey assisted and encouraged Anne and dedicated to her several new species that she had first collected, such as <i>Ballia callitricha</i> and <i>Cladophora balliana</i>. She contributed records of hydroids to William Thompson, published in volume four of <span class="italic">The Natural History of Ireland</span> (1856). Anne died at home in Belmont Avenue, Dublin, in 1872. She did not marry and her extant collections were later housed in the herbaria at University College, Cork, and at the Royal (later National) Botanic Gardens, Glasnevin, which acquired her drawings of seaweeds and fungi.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_56447"></a><span class="headword">Mary Ball</span>  (1812&#150;1898), <span class="occ">zoologist</span>, and younger sister of Robert Ball, was born at Cobh on 15 February 1812. She engaged in natural history pursuits from her youth. By the age of twenty-one she had an impressive cabinet of Irish butterflies and subsequently collected a wide range of insects, shells, and other marine invertebrates. Her perceptive observations were passed to her brother and his naturalist friends, including William Thompson, of Belfast, who named a mollusc, <i>Rissoa balliae</i>, after her in 1856. Through field and indoor studies she assembled information on insect habits and made the first record of stridulation in corixid water bugs, published by Robert Ball in 1845&#150;6. Baron de Selys-Longchamps, the European authority on dragonflies, visited her collection and subsequently published her notable observations and records in 1846. Like her sister Mary Ball maintained a lifelong interest in gardening, but her natural history studies waned in the 1850s following the deaths of her brother, Thompson, and other close friends. Although in 1834 Thompson had rated Mary's among thirty notable Irish collections of shells and invertebrates, only a small part remains in the National Museum collections. She did not marry and survived Anne Ball by more than twenty years. She died on 17 July 1898 at the home the sisters had shared in Dublin.<br>
