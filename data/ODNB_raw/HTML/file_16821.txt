<span class="headword">Lloyd,  Charles</span>  (1766&#150;1829), <span class="occ">dissenting minister and schoolmaster</span>, was born at Llwynrhydowen, Cardiganshire, on 18 December 1766. He was the third son and fourth child of five born to David Lloyd (1724&#150;1779), Presbyterian minister there, and his second wife, Letitia Lloyd of Llanfechan; a sister had been born in the first marriage. On his father's death his education for the ministry was undertaken by his uncle John Lloyd of Coedlannau. His uncle, however, provided only for his schooling in 1779&#150;84 under David Davis (1745&#150;1827), who had been his father's colleague; Lloyd thought Davis the superior of any teacher of classics who came after.<br>
<br>In the autumn of 1784 Lloyd entered (with an exhibition of &pound;10) the Presbyterian academy best known as Carmarthen but then at Swansea under Solomon Harries (1726&#150;1785). Lloyd developed an aversion to Hebrew, which was Harries's principal interest, but believed that he profited from his instruction in mathematics. Harries was succeeded in 1785 by Josiah Rees (1749&#150;1804), father of Thomas Rees (1777&#150;1864), and Thomas Lloyd, son of Charles Lloyd's uncle John. William Howell (1740&#150;1822) became theological tutor in 1786, and the other tutors established a grammar school preparatory to the academy, in which Charles Lloyd was appointed afternoon teacher. Among his fellow students was Lewis Loyd (1767&#150;1858), who left the ministry for a highly successful career in banking and who was the father of Samuel Jones Loyd, first Baron Overstone.<br>
<br>After leaving the academy in 1788 in ill health, Charles Lloyd went to Hotwells, near Bristol, where he received much kindness from John Wright MD (<i>d</i>. 1794), and his brother Thomas Wright (<i>d</i>. 1797), Presbyterian minister at Lewin's Mead, Bristol, who are among the few whom Lloyd, in his singular autobiography, exempts from censure.<br>
<br>Through the influence of Nathaniel Philipps (1757?&#150;1842), Presbyterian minister at Derby, Lloyd was elected minister, in August 1788, of the Oat Street congregation, Evesham, Worcestershire, with a stipend of &pound;40. He was at this time a &#145;moderately high Arian&#146;. He started a Sunday school and an evening service and increased his congregation from 40 to 200. He wished, however, to administer the sacraments without being ordained&#151;ordination was a matter of serious disagreement among Presbyterians and Unitarians at that time. When the congregation objected he consulted Joseph Priestley, then at Birmingham, who, to his surprise, urged him to be ordained. At length the congregation yielded, persuaded by the expense attending an ordination. Shortly afterwards Lloyd began to have doubts about infant baptism, and on 3 April 1790 proposed to omit this rite or resign; his resignation was at once accepted.<br>
<br>Through Joshua Toulmin he was put in charge of a General Baptist congregation at Ditchling, Sussex, at a stipend of 60 guineas. There he received adult baptism, but refused to submit to the additional rite of imposition of hands, then usual among General Baptists; he also again declined ordination. He cultivated extempore preaching. At the beginning of 1792 he started a boarding-school and married in the following summer. Early in 1793 he left the ministry and moved his school to Exeter, where it flourished. His first pupil was John Kenrick, who described Lloyd as &#145;a good classical scholar, [who] grounded his pupils well &hellip; interesting them by his remarks on the authors. &hellip; But his temper was warm, and he corrected passionately. He was sensitive, and suspicious of affront.&#146;<br>
<br>Lloyd then turned farmer in 1799 on the small estate of Coedlannau Fawr, Cardiganshire, inherited from his brother Richard, who died on 27 September 1797 aged thirty-seven. His agricultural experiment, caught in the price instability of the war years, exhausted all his savings. By then he had abandoned his Arian position for Unitarianism and would have been glad to act as colleague in the congregation at Llwynrhydowen, which had been his father's, but the pastor, his old schoolmaster David Davis, opposed the election of a Socinian Baptist. By this time, however, he had rejected the rite of baptism in any form, as an institution necessary only in the apostolic age. A secession from the chapel in 1801 resulted in the founding of two small chapels at Capel-y-groes (with a membership of eighty) and Pantydefaid (with a membership of sixty); they chose Lloyd as their minister. His stay in Cardiganshire did not last long. Leaving his congregations to the care of John James (1779&#150;1864), he settled in 1803 in Palgrave, Suffolk, undertaking a school and the charge of a Presbyterian congregation, which he held from 5 April 1803 to 4 October 1811. In 1809 he received the degree of LLD from the University of Glasgow. His first wife, Letty, with whom he had several children, died at Palgrave on 11 December 1808. From a second marriage, to Sara Maria Smith, he had a son, Francis Vaughan (<i>b</i>. 1811).<br>
<br>From Palgrave Lloyd moved to London, where for many years he kept a school in Keppel Street, Russell Square. He died on a visit to relatives near Lampeter, Cardiganshire, on 23 May 1829, and was buried at Llanwenog.<br>
<br>Lloyd published relatively little: <span class="italic">Two Sermons on Christian Zeal</span> (1808), <span class="italic">Observations on the Choice of a School</span> (1812), <span class="italic">Travels at Home</span> (1814), and a version of the epistles of St Paul and St James &#145;by Philalethes&#146;, identified by John Kentish as Lloyd. Even as a controversialist, he put little in print. One dispute is the overlong exchange in the <span class="italic">Monthly Repository</span> at the end of 1813 and the beginning of 1814, over the translation of <span class="roman">Acts</span> 20: 28, between Lloyd and John Jones (1766?&#150;1827); Lloyd is said to have played cards with Jones and quarrelled with him every evening. In <span class="italic">The &#145;Monthly Repository&#146; Extraordinaire</span> (1819) he took Robert Aspland to task for his attack on Thomas Paine's <span class="italic">Age of Reason</span>, which had just been republished by Richard Carlile, though Aspland had conceded Carlile's right to publish.<br>
<br>Lloyd's fame will rest on his anonymous autobiography, <span class="italic">Particulars of the Life of a Dissenting Minister &hellip; Written by Himself</span> (1813), an edition with only a few surviving copies because Lloyd subsequently tried to suppress it; but the book was reprinted in 1911, with marginal identifications by the Revd R. T. Jenkins of some of the nameless targets of Lloyd's abuse. Alexander Gordon  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>) refers to the impression given by the book of &#145;an acute and honest, though jaundiced mind&#146;, while Robert Brook Aspland, commenting on Lloyd's unsparing characterization of the Evesham congregation, refers to his &#145;sickness of heart and a temper soured by disappointment&#146;  (<span class="italic">Christian Reformer</span>, new ser., 8, 1852, 618). Some of the portraits with which the book ends are harsh beyond any deserving, notably of Timothy Kenrick (1759&#150;1804) and John Jones. Yet the book abounds in insights and offers a pathetic, even tragic, depiction of failure.<br>
