<span class="headword">Edwards,  John Hugh</span>  (1869&#150;1945), <span class="occ">Congregational minister and politician</span>, was born at 37 Powell Street, Aberystwyth, on 9 April 1869, the son of John Edwards, a flannel merchant and alderman, and his wife, Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Evans. He was educated at Aberystwyth grammar school and the University College of Wales, Aberystwyth (1891&#150;8). He commenced his lifelong involvement in Liberal politics at the college, becoming prime minister of the mock parliament, and joining Cymru Fydd, a nationalist movement associated with David Lloyd George, of whom Edwards became an ardent admirer. In 1895 Edwards founded <span class="italic">Young Wales</span>, a monthly periodical supportive of Cymru Fydd, which he edited until 1904. He was one of the representatives for Cardiganshire at the meeting of the South Wales Liberal Federation at Newport, on 16 January 1896, when the proposal to merge the Welsh Liberal federations under the leadership of Cymru Fydd was defeated, with fatal consequences for Cymru Fydd. He also served on Aberystwyth borough council and Cardiganshire county council.<br>
<br>From an early age Edwards was a member of Seion Congregational Church, Aberystwyth. He accepted the pastorate of the English Congregational Church, Newtown, Montgomeryshire, in August 1899 and was ordained on 24 March 1900. During his ministry at Newtown he combined preaching and public speaking with political work, representing Cardiganshire county council in Lloyd George's &#145;revolt campaign&#146; against the <span class="roman">Education Act</span> of 1902. Edwards was responsible for a series of religious and political meetings in west Wales held by the prominent Congregational leaders Silvester Horne and J. D. Jones of Bournemouth. He took part in revival meetings during 1904, and met Evan Roberts, but the Welsh revival of 1904&#150;5 had little apparent impact on the town or church of Newtown.<br>
<br>In September 1905 Edwards was inducted to the pastorate of Dulwich Grove Congregational Church, London, but by late 1906 some of the deacons concluded that his political work was causing him to neglect his pastoral duties. One of the distractions was his first book, <span class="italic">From Village Green to Downing Street</span> (1908), a short and profusely illustrated biography of David Lloyd George, jointly written with Spencer Leigh Hughes of the <span class="italic">Morning Leader</span>. Increasing pressure from the diaconate caused him to resign from Dulwich Grove in January 1908. He accepted a call from Hanover Chapel, Peckham, one of the oldest Congregational churches in Britain, and was followed by about forty members from Dulwich Grove. At Hanover Chapel pastoral work was carried out by an assistant, leaving Edwards free to concentrate on political and literary work. He also began to read for the bar.<br>
<br>Edwards defended Lloyd George against charges that he had betrayed the nonconformists of Wales while a member of the Liberal governments, and at the general election of January 1910 he accompanied David Lloyd George for much of his campaign. In November 1910 Edwards was chosen as Liberal candidate for Mid-Glamorgan and in the general election of December 1910 was returned with an 11 per cent majority over his Labour opponent, Vernon Hartshorn. With W. F. Phillips, the unsuccessful Liberal candidate for Gower, and Clement Edwards, MP for East Glamorgan, Edwards attacked socialism, and called on workers in the south Wales valleys to return to the Liberal fold. This anti-socialist crusade earned him the hatred of south Wales socialists, whose local press regularly pilloried him.<br>
<br>As an MP Edwards contributed regularly to the <span class="italic">British Weekly</span>, as well as launching in 1911 <span class="italic">Wales: a National Magazine</span>, which he edited until 1914. In 1913 he resigned from the pastorate of Hanover Chapel, leaving the Congregational ministry for good. He wrote <span class="italic">The Life of Lloyd George with a Short History of the Welsh People</span>, bound in four handsome volumes published between 1913 and 1916, with a profusion of illustrations and gilding. It began with the pre-Roman Celtic settlement of Britain, and ended with Lloyd George's ascent to the premiership, presenting its subject's life as a battle against power and privilege. A number of anecdotes about Lloyd George originate in this biography; some were the result of Edwards's closeness to Lloyd George, but others have been attributed to his vivid imagination.<br>
<br>The First World War had a profound effect on Edwards; at a public meeting in Aberystwyth in March 1916 he spoke of its &#145;nauseating horrors&#146;  (G. Morgan, 374). His abstention on the first reading of the <span class="roman">Conscription Bill</span> in January 1916 may have played some part in Lloyd George's failure to promote him, though he received his blessing at the general election of 1918, when he was adopted as coalition Liberal candidate for the newly created Neath division. At the poll Edwards easily defeated his Labour opponent, Herbert Morgan, formerly minister of Castle Street Welsh Baptist Chapel, London. In 1919&#150;20 he was a member of the speaker's conference on federal devolution in Great Britain, and supported Lloyd George during the parliament of 1918&#150;22, when he lost his Neath seat to the Labour candidate, William Jenkins.<br>
<br>Edwards returned to parliament in 1923, representing the Accrington division of Lancashire, where the Conservatives stood aside as part of a local anti-socialist agreement. He retained the seat as a Constitutionalist in 1924, but returned to the Liberal fold. His parliamentary career came to an end in May 1929, when he was defeated at Accrington by Thomas Snowden, the Labour candidate.<br>
<br>From 1905 Edwards lived in England, at first in south London until 1920, when he moved to the suburb of Purley. He served on Purley and Coulsdon urban district council and played a prominent role in the organization of ratepayers' associations, serving as president of the National Confederation of Ratepayers' Associations of England and Wales. He was also a member of the councils of the university colleges of Cardiff and Aberystwyth. Although considered to be a confirmed bachelor, he married on 20 April 1933 (Vera) Doris (1890&#150;1988), daughter of the industrialist Sir Samuel Faire, and settled at Fairdene, Hindhead, Surrey. There were no children of the marriage, and it is probable that he and his wife were estranged by the time of his death, of bronchopneumonia, at Holloway Sanatorium, a mental-health institution near Virginia Water, Surrey, on 14 June 1945. He was buried four days later at St Luke's, Grayshott, Hampshire, after a funeral at Tower Road Congregational Church, Hindhead.<br>
<br>One of a small group of nonconformist ministers who have sat in the House of Commons, Edwards was a man of striking appearance, usually elegantly dressed, with considerable skills as a speaker and preacher. Many of his contemporaries described him as loyal, with a winning personality, but others regarded him as self-serving and egotistical, most notably the author John Vyrnwy Morgan and the Caernarvonshire Liberal MP Ellis W. Davies, who accused Edwards of being &#145;an adept liar&#146;  (NL Wales, Ellis W. Davies papers, diary, 26 Feb 1907). His adversarial reaction to socialism did not endear him to the coming generation of Welsh political leaders, while some of his fellow Welsh Liberals mocked his ostentatious identification with Lloyd George. This closeness lends importance to his published work on Lloyd George, which provides a picture of Liberal Wales on the eve of the rise of Labour.<br>
