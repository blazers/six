<span class="headword">O'Sullivan,  Cornelius</span>  (1841&#150;1907), <span class="occ">brewing chemist</span>, was born in Bandon, co. Cork, on 20 December 1841, one of three boys and four girls born to James O'Sullivan, merchant, and his wife, Elizabeth Morgan. His brief primary schooling was at Denny Holland's private school, followed by some years at Tommy Lordan's Cavendish School; he left the latter as a protest over indiscriminate corporal punishment. He attended evening classes of the Department of Science and Art in Bandon in 1861&#150;2. On the strength of four prizes won at examinations in May 1862 he was awarded a scholarship at the Royal School of Mines, London. During his three-year course there he won further prizes, then briefly joined the teaching staff of the Royal College of Chemistry as a student assistant under Professor August Wilhelm von Hofmann. On Hofmann's appointment as professor of chemistry at Berlin University in 1865 O'Sullivan accompanied him as private assistant.<br>
<br>The following year Hofmann's influence secured O'Sullivan the post of assistant brewer and chemist to Bass, Ratcliff, and Gretton Ltd of Burton upon Trent. He remained with them as head of the scientific and analytical department until his death. In 1875 the company established a laboratory department; O'Sullivan's brother James became his assistant in 1876. O'Sullivan was among the first chemists to apply scientific principles specifically to brewing, and was quick to realize the value of Pasteur's work to the industry. It was particularly his work on the products of the hydrolysis of starch by acids and by diastase to which he owed his reputation. The results of his work on starch were published in numerous papers, chiefly in the <span class="italic">Journal of the Chemical Society</span>, between 1872 and 1879. His important work included his rediscovery of maltose (following Dubrunfaut in 1847) and the effect of temperature in determining the character of the products of the action of diastase on starch; on the sugars and other carbohydrates of certain cereals and germinated grain (such as his detection and isolation of raffinose in barley); on the chemistry of different gums; and on the enzymes of yeast.<br>
<br>On 2 February 1870 O'Sullivan married, at St Mary's Church, Derby, Edithe Nadin (<i>d</i>. 1904) of Barrow Hall, Barrow upon Trent, near Derby, the daughter of Joseph Nadin, co-proprietor of Stanton colliery. They had three sons, the youngest of whom died in childhood, and a daughter. The family lived at 140 High Street, Burton upon Trent, until 1897 when they moved to number 148 which was built by the company. There O'Sullivan installed a fully equipped chemical laboratory. The family took a holiday in Bandon almost every year for over thirty years. O'Sullivan's interests included music, fishing, and, latterly, motoring. He belonged to and gave several lectures to the Burton Natural History and Archaeological Society. Elected a fellow then vice-president of the Chemical Society in 1876, he served on its council from 1882 to 1885 and was awarded its Longstaff medal in 1884 chiefly for his researches on the chemistry of the carbohydrates. He was an original member of the Institute of Chemistry, the Society of Chemical Industry, on whose publication committee he served for ten years, and the Institute of Brewing, of which he was elected an honorary member in 1893; he served on the council of each. In 1885 he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society.<br>
<br>Edithe had long suffered from asthma, then from a weak heart, caused by rheumatic fever, from which she died in July 1904. O'Sullivan, after a bad attack of catarrhal jaundice, died at home on 8 January 1907. He was buried next to his wife and third son in Ballymodan graveyard near Bandon on 13 January.<br>
