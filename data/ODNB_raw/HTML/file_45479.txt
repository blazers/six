<span class="headword">Baldwin,  Richard</span>  (<em>c.</em>1653&#150;1698), <span class="occ">publisher</span>, was probably born in Wycombe, Buckinghamshire, the son of Thomas Baldwin, a hemp-dresser. No further information survives about his family and education. On 5 August 1668 Baldwin was apprenticed to George Eversden, a bookseller then working in St John's Lane, London; he was made free of the Stationers' Company on 25 August 1675.<br>
<br>Baldwin lived in London for the next six years, and apparently began his professional career as a bookbinder. On 7 December 1676 he married Abigail Mulford [<a name="cosubject_45479"></a><span class="headword">Abigail Baldwin</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1658, <em>d.</em> 1713)<span class="occ"></span>] in St Botolph, Aldersgate; the couple had at least one child, Mary. Erroneously named Anne in some sources, Abigail was baptized in St James's, Clerkenwell, in October 1658. Until Richard's death in 1698, her publishing career was inextricable from that of her husband.<br>
<br>Baldwin, it seems, was still working as a bookbinder when he opened his premises in Ball Court, near the Black Bull, Great Old Bailey, some time before 1681. He rapidly expanded his trade, however, by diversifying into the publication of whig broadsides and pamphlets. As early as 1676 Baldwin was bound over to the Hereford sessions in connection with a certain &#145;infamous paper&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1 March 1676&#150;28 Feb 1677</i>, 50); nevertheless, his first imprint did not appear until 1680. In 1681 he emerged suddenly as a major whig publisher, heading a second generation of opposition stationers precisely as the fortunes of their predecessors, including Francis Smith, declined.<br>
<br>The political crisis of 1681&#150;3 was a defining point for Baldwin. He was instrumental in the whig propaganda machine: in addition to incendiary tracts by Thomas Hunt and pamphlets supporting the earl of Shaftesbury, he also published a number of outspoken but short-lived opposition newspapers, including the <span class="italic">London Mercury</span> and the <span class="italic">Protestant Courant</span>. Baldwin quickly became identified as one of a small new breed of stationers&#151;&#145;publishers&#146; rather than &#145;booksellers&#146;&#151;who specialized in publishing and distributing works for others  (Treadwell, 114&#150;15). This professional development is reflected in the exceptional number of imprints to which the Baldwins lent their names over the next three decades.<br>
<br>While Baldwin was not directly responsible for many of the works bearing his imprint, he was nevertheless subject, as a dedicated whig publisher, to surveillance and prosecution. In October 1681 he was summoned before the privy council for publishing seditious pamphlets. The following spring he was in constant trouble on account of his newspaper the <span class="italic">Protestant Courant</span>. Repeatedly libellous comments in this publication provoked a search of his premises by the Stationers' Company. Having refused to co-operate, Baldwin was fined &pound;10; he remained estranged from the Stationers' Company for many years. In May 1682 he was prosecuted for the same newspaper's misrepresention of a case against the earl of Shaftesbury. In addition to allegedly &#145;base and scandalous Reflections&#146; upon the prosecution and its witnesses, the article cast doubt upon the very integrity of the court's proceedings  (<span class="italic">Loyal Protestant</span>, no. 155). At Baldwin's ensuing trial before the lord chief justice, he suffered an extended character assassination by Jeffreys, who was determined that Baldwin &#145;might be made an Example of&#146; at all costs  (<span class="italic">London Mercury</span>, no. 13). Having refused to divulge the identity of the author of the libel, Baldwin was remanded to the king's bench prison; upon producing a number of recognizances, he was released on a bond of good behaviour a week later.<br>
<br>Prosecuted again in the autumn of 1682, Baldwin nevertheless continued to publish undeterred, and Thomas Hunt's <span class="italic">Defence of the Charter and Municipal Rights of the City of London</span> appeared in January 1683. This publication provoked the outrage of Roger L'Estrange, surveyor of the press, at the failure of both his agents and the Stationers' Company to monitor Baldwin adequately; it was common knowledge that Baldwin's publishing operation ensured the anonymity of those whose works he published and distributed. Baldwin's activities continued to be monitored closely throughout 1683, by which time the successful tory reappropriation of power had splintered an unofficial alliance of opposition stationers into a disparate number of mutually suspicious individuals. That summer Baldwin&#151;isolated, unbeholden to his fellow stationers, and under the pressures of close surveillance&#151;appeared, despite his whig convictions, as a government witness against opposition authors and stationers, including the family of Francis Smith. In July 1683 the attorney-general nevertheless decreed that warrants for searching Baldwin's premises might be granted upon the merest suspicion; the following month he was again investigated, as the publisher of a seditious work by Hunt.<br>
<br>There is little evidence of activity on Baldwin's part throughout the reign of James II; he certainly lent his imprint to relatively few works in the aftermath of the tory reaction. This situation changed dramatically with the accession of William III, which he greeted with enthusiasm, publishing several works championing the cause of the revolution of 1688. He continued to publish whig tracts on a large scale until his death in 1698. Nevertheless, he was frequently questioned in connection with his work, and in 1690 a warrant committed him to Newgate prison for high treason upon publishing <span class="italic">A Modest Enquiry into the Causes of the Present Disasters in England</span>. Despite the gravity of this charge, he appears, unusually, to have secured release on bail. In the same year the Baldwins moved to the Oxford Arms, Warwick Lane. Baldwin was summoned before the House of Commons the following year, when some blunt criticisms of parliament's prosecution of the French war were published, together with incendiary remarks about the king of France, in <span class="italic">Mercurius Reformatus</span>. He finally entered into the livery of the Stationers' Company in 1692. In addition to his core business in political and satirical pamphlets and newspapers, his expanding stock included dramatic, scientific, and historical works; he also published a number of periodicals, including the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Journal</span> and <span class="italic">Miscellaneous Letters</span>. After a brief and acrimonious merger with the <span class="italic">Post Boy</span>, a rival publication, Baldwin's longest-lived newspaper appeared independently, as the <span class="italic">Post Man</span>, in 1695. In this organ, as with innumerable titles in his pamphlet stock, Baldwin's anti-papist and, more specifically, anti-French sentiments were undisguised. The <span class="italic">Post Man</span> incurred the censure of state authorities when it carried further libellous comments on the French king and the duke of Burgundy in October 1697. Nevertheless, despite the arrest of the author and printer of the offending article, Baldwin himself appears to have escaped prosecution.<br>
<br>Baldwin died in 1698, probably at his home, and, according to Dunton, was buried at his Buckinghamshire birthplace; he was said to have been forty-five years old. Dunton describes him as a man of &#145;Generous Temper&#146;, with a purse and heart &#145;open to all Men, that he thought were Honest&#146;, and whose &#145;Conversation was very diverting&#146;  (Dunton, 342). After her husband's death Abigail Baldwin continued to run their flourishing business in Warwick Lane, publishing and distributing a wide range of pamphlets and periodicals under the imprint &#145;A. Baldwin&#146;. In addition to treatises on issues such as social welfare and the standing army, she published pamphlets by whig authors, including Defoe, and periodicals which ranged from the economic journal the <span class="italic">British Merchant of Commerce Preserved</span> to the notorious <span class="italic">Female Tatler</span>. A formidable businesswoman in her own right, Abigail Baldwin was remembered by Dunton for her remarkable bookkeeping skills. She died on or after 14 November 1713, and was buried in St Martin Ludgate on the 29th of that month. In addition to a flourishing business, which she bequeathed to her son-in-law, the printer James Roberts, Abigail Baldwin left some tenanted property in Parkers Lane, Middlesex, and a significant amount of money, silver, and jewellery. The business continued under Roberts for a further forty-one years.<br>
<br>Richard and Abigail Baldwin are key figures in the history of publishing. Responding to the political pressures of their time, their business evolved pragmatically and influentially beyond the mandate of traditional &#145;bookselling&#146;. Perhaps most renowned as agents of whig propaganda, they also influenced the developing role of newspapers and periodicals within the popular literary culture of the early eighteenth century.<br>
