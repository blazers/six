<span class="headword">West,  Thomas</span>, third Baron De La Warr  (1577&#150;1618), <span class="occ">colonial governor</span>, was born on 9 July 1577 and baptized at Wherwell, Hampshire, the third child and second son of Thomas West, second Baron De La Warr (<i>c</i>.1550&#150;1602), and Anne, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15755/', "Sir Francis Knollys")</script> and cousin of Elizabeth I. He matriculated from Queen's College, Oxford, in March 1592, and toured Italy in 1596&#150;7 following the death of his elder brother, Robert, in 1594. On 25 November 1602 he married Cecily or Cecilia (<i>d</i>. 1662), daughter of his godfather Sir Thomas Shirley of Wiston, Sussex, at St Dunstan-in-the-West, London. He served in parliament as member for Lymington, Hampshire, in 1597&#150;8 before campaigning in Ireland and perhaps the Low Countries. West was knighted by the earl of Essex in Dublin on 12 July 1599, and his association with the condemned lord lieutenant resulted in his temporary imprisonment in 1601. Essex's declaration that West was unacquainted with any rebellion cleared him of treason. Soon after his release West enjoyed considerable political influence. He became third Baron De La Warr upon his father's death in March 1602, served as a privy councillor to both Elizabeth I and James I, and was created MA at Oxford in 1605.<br>
<br>De La Warr made his greatest impact as a colonial promoter and administrator. On 20 November 1606 he was named to the fourteen-member king's counsel of Virginia, overseeing American colonial projects between thirty-four and forty-five degrees north latitude. In 1609 the Virginia Company of London appointed him first lord governor and captain-general of Virginia for life (commission dated 28 February 1610). After two years of dissension, desertions, high death rates, and damaging relations with the Powhatan Indians the Jamestown colony needed stronger governance by a respected authority, broad reforms, and military leadership. Given his rank, court connections, and generous support of the company (&pound;500 invested in 1609), De La Warr was an obvious choice to become the first nobleman to govern in English America, replacing the previous leadership of untitled, self-made men such as Captain John Smith.<br>
<br>During De La Warr's governorship Virginia was transformed from an infant colony struggling for life in 1609 to a more mature and populous colony with a profitable tobacco economy by 1618. But De La Warr himself was not personally responsible for most of that progress. Alexander Brown's 1890 assessment that he was the &#145;one man&#146; who deserved to &#145;be called the founder of Virginia&#146; greatly exaggerated his contribution  (Brown, 2.1049). He only resided in America for ten months, much of which he spent aboard ship, debilitated and bedridden with fevers, diarrhoea, gout, and scurvy. His hasty and embarrassing return to England in March 1611 was so potentially damaging to investors' confidence that the Virginia Company quickly issued <span class="italic">The relation of the right honourable the Lord De-La-Warre, &hellip; to the &hellip; counsell of Virginea, touching his unexpected returne home, and afterwards delivered to the generall assembly of the said company</span> (1611). In his long absence from Virginia critical leadership duties fell to a succession of talented deputy governors&#151;Sir Thomas Gates, Sir Thomas Dale, and Captain Samuel Argall. De La Warr contributed more style than substance to the stabilization of the Jamestown colony, and his most significant accomplishment occurred by accident. When Deputy Governor Gates reached Virginia on 23 May 1610, he found only ninety emaciated and terrified colonists who had survived a six-month Powhatan siege of Jamestown (the &#145;Starving Time&#146;, November 1609&#150;May 1610). He evacuated the indefensible settlement on 7 June and set sail for England&#151;only to encounter De La Warr's arriving relief fleet the next day while still in the James River. This providential meeting was made possible by Argall's brilliant navigation of a faster Atlantic crossing&#151;thus preventing a second lost colony and altering American history.<br>
<br>De La Warr formally assumed office with great pomp on 10 June 1610 in an elaborate ceremony with fifty red-cloaked halberdiers in his livery before the pitiful ruins of James Fort. He carried out the orders of company and crown by instituting harsh martial law over the colonists and by launching military offensives against the Indians in the First Anglo-Powhatan War. Between July 1610 and December 1611 Gates and Dale used well-supplied and armour-clad veteran troops to conquer key portions of the James River, from present-day Richmond to Hampton Roads. Although he rarely saw combat himself, De La Warr treated the native &#145;Canaanites&#146; with <span class="roman">Old Testament</span> wrath, ordering an Indian warrior's hand to be sliced off and desiring that a Powhatan mother be burned alive after the English murdered her children. Thanks to Dale and Argall, diplomacy, not cruelty, finally ended Virginia's first Indian war in April 1614&#151;three years after De La Warr had left the scene.<br>
<br>Lord De La Warr, who contributed more of his purse than his person to Virginia, was <i>en route</i> to quell a new political crisis in the colony when he died at sea, perhaps along the Nova Scotia coast, on 7 June 1618. His mixed and controversial legacy includes receiving credit for the deeds of others and demonstrating all too often that an excellent pedigree does not guarantee excellent performance. He left behind three brothers, Francis, John, and Nathaniel, who settled permanently in Virginia, as well as his name on Delaware Bay, which Argall discovered in 1610.<br>
