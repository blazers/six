<span class="headword">Owen,  John</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1580, <em>d.</em> 1651), <span class="occ">bishop of St Asaph</span>, was baptized at Burton Latimer, Northamptonshire, on 8 November 1580, the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21042/', "Owen Owen (1543/4&#150;1593)")</script>, rector there and a descendant of the Owens of Bodsilin, Aber, Caernarvonshire, and his second wife, Jane, daughter of Robert Griffith of Caernarfon. He graduated BA from Christ's College, Cambridge, in 1597 and subsequently became a fellow of Jesus College, Cambridge. He proceeded MA in 1600 and DD in 1618; he was also incorporated MA at Oxford on 16 July 1600, but remained at Cambridge for some years and appeared as <i>taxor</i> there in 1608. He succeeded to the rectory of Burton Latimer, Northamptonshire, in 1608 and was appointed chaplain to Prince Charles. He became rector of Carlton in 1609 and Cottingham in 1620, both in Northamptonshire. His first wife, Sarah Hodilow (<i>d</i>. 1621) of Cambridgeshire, mother of his son Robert and of his daughter, who eventually married Dr William Griffith, chancellor of Bangor and St Asaph, was buried at Burton Latimer in February 1621. His second wife was Elizabeth Gray and his third Elizabeth Wyn (<i>d</i>. 1651), daughter of Robert Wyn of Conwy.<br>
<br>Owen was elected bishop of St Asaph on 18 August 1629, apparently as a compromise candidate, consecrated at Croydon on 20 September, instituted on 23 September, and had his temporalities restored on 26 September. He had earlier, on 15 September, received a grant to hold <i>in commendam</i> the archdeaconry of St Asaph and other benefices in the dioceses of St Asaph and Bangor to a value not exceeding &pound;150 per annum; he subsequently held six rectories along with his bishopric. Owen was held in much esteem in his own diocese, where he claimed to be connected by descent with every family of quality, and <i>cywyddau</i> (praise-poems) were addressed to him by Huw Machno (1635) and Si&ocirc;n Cain (two, in 1641). Owen's episcopate was given an encouraging start when in 1630 Robert Llwyd, vicar of Chirk, dedicated to him his book, <span class="italic">Llwybr hyffordd i'r nefoedd</span> (a translation of Dent's <span class="italic">Plain Pathway to Heaven</span>), where he commented enthusiastically on the zeal and ability of many of the diocesan clergy.<br>
<br>Owen was himself active in the pastoral work of his diocese. In a return on St Asaph dispatched to Archbishop Laud in 1633 he reported all was well, except for the number and boldness of Roman Catholic recusants, especially those focused on St Winifred's well. He made provision for Welsh sermons to be preached in parish churches on the first Sunday of every month, to be funded by those who received the tithes of the parish. He superintended improvements to his cathedral, including the building of a new organ in 1635, and in that year was much exercised about the repair of Wrexham church, one of the glories of his diocese. Two sets of visitation articles issued by Owen in 1637 and 1642 are extant; those for 1637 are the earliest surviving printed articles for any Welsh diocese. In his diocesan reports to Laud of 1633, 1634, 1635, 1637, and 1638, he claimed to have carried out the king's instructions and to have found his clergy orderly and conformable. His most serious worries were the growth in the number of recusants and the persistence of &#145;superstition and profaneness&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works of &hellip; Laud</span>, 5.329). In 1639 he reported the discovery of an &#145;unlawful conventicle&#146;  (ibid., 369) within his diocese at Llanyblodwel in Shropshire, but there was no mention of the activities of Walter Cradock and other puritans in the Wrexham area.<br>
<br>Owen wrote a Welsh treatise on the ten commandments and petitioned the king in 1641 to authorize its printing and command every church and chapel in Wales to obtain a copy, but nothing further was heard of it in the developing political crisis. On 30 December 1641 he was one of eleven bishops who petitioned against the growth of mob violence against their order at Westminster. He was impeached of high treason and imprisoned (possibly twice) in the Tower. His bishopric was sequestered on 6 April 1642, when he was allowed &pound;500 per annum in composition. He also lost his sinecure rectories and his episcopal palace was sacked. Owen's third wife, Elizabeth, was buried on 22 July 1651. He died three months later, on 15 October 1651, at Aberkinsey in Rhuddlan; he was buried under the bishop's throne at St Asaph Cathedral. A brass plate was installed in his memory by Lord Harlech in 1907.<br>
