<span class="headword">Trecothick,  Barlow</span>  (1718?&#150;1775), <span class="occ">merchant and politician</span>, was born either at Stepney or at sea, the son of Captain Mark Trecothick, mariner, and Hannah Greenleaf. From <i>c</i>.1724 he lived in Boston, Massachusetts, where he served as an apprentice to Charles Apthorp between 1734 and 1740. Thereafter he moved to Jamaica, and acted as the agent for Apthorp and Thomlinson for seven years. He returned to Boston, married Grizzell Apthorp, the daughter of his former master, on 2 March 1747, and remained there for three years. He settled in London about 1750 as a North American commission merchant. Among other things, he served as the London correspondent for Apthorp and Thomlinson, supplied other American merchants with European manufactures, provided food and provisions to the troops on a victualling contract he held with Thomlinson, and managed the finances of several military companies with Sir George Colebrooke and other Londoners. Like most influential merchants, he subscribed to government loans during the Seven Years' War.<br>
<br>In 1764 Trecothick was elected alderman of London for Vintry ward and he held this post for ten years; in 1766 he served as London's sheriff and in 1770 as its lord mayor. In addition, from 1766 to 1774, he was employed as New Hampshire's colonial agent, acting as its advocate in Whitehall and parliament. Trecothick's best-known service occurred before he took a seat in the Commons. Throughout the <span class="roman">Stamp Act</span> crisis in 1765 and 1766, he performed invaluable services for Rockingham and Newcastle: with other colony agents, he opposed the passage of the act; with other London merchants, he led the search for a legislative remedy in the wake of passage; he marshalled the support of American and Caribbean interests in London and the outports for repeal; and he served as an effective witness in house investigations.<br>
<br>Trecothick had been proposed as MP for the City in the early 1760s but, not possessing the freedom of the City, he was not nominated. He was next considered in 1765, when the duke of Newcastle offered him the seat at New Shoreham. But he baulked at the cost of buying the support of the constituency (Newcastle mentioned &pound;1050, in addition to the purchase of a ship from local builders), not to mention the venality of the system, and refused the seat. He was returned as one of the members for London in the election of 1768. The fight was fiercely competitive among seven candidates, some of whom openly questioned his American background and his willingness to serve as a tool of the colonies. During the next six years, until he retired with the dissolution of parliament in May 1774, he adopted a stricter attitude towards protest. For instance, he spoke warmly during the strike of the seamen and the 1768 City riots. Yet he continued to vent his outrage at what he believed to be the inept handling of American trade matters. The Boston massacre in 1770 or the subjugation of Native Americans on St Vincent in 1772 were, to Trecothick, only the latest instances of misguided despotism. Throughout his tenure he sided with the opposition.<br>
<br>In 1768 Trecothick purchased an estate of 5000 acres in Addington, Surrey, for &pound;38,500. At the same time, he acquired a share in a plantation in Grenada and several estates in Jamaica. After the death of his first wife on 31 July 1769, he married Anne Meredith, the sister of Sir William Meredith, third baronet, on 9 June 1770. From 1771 onwards, Trecothick's health failed him and, when parliament was dissolved in 1774, he stood down. He died in Addington on 28 May 1775, and was buried in the churchyard at Addington.<br>
