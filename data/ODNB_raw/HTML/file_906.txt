<span class="headword">Austin,  Charles</span>  (1799&#150;1874), <span class="occ">barrister</span>, was born in Suffolk on 26 March 1799, the second of the five sons and two daughters of Jonathan Austin and his wife, Anne, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Redhouse, of Ipswich. Jonathan Austin was a miller and corn merchant who made large amounts of money as a government contractor during the Napoleonic wars. He was a handsome, vigorous, self-educated, and astute man who liked to read. Anne Austin, the daughter of a yeoman farmer, was brought up by a rich uncle as his heir. A religious woman, she may have inspired her husband with her &#145;love of learning&#146;  (Ross, 88). Her health was delicate, however, and she was subject to depression, a tendency shared by a number of her children, including Charles.<h2>
<a name="Cambridgeandthe1820s"></a>Cambridge and the 1820s</h2>Austin was raised as a Unitarian and attended Bury St Edmunds grammar school. He worked as a clerk in Ipswich before matriculating at Jesus College, Cambridge, in 1819. Despite his opposition to religious orthodoxy as false and mischievous, he won the Hulsean prize for a long 148-page essay in support of the genuineness and authenticity of the <span class="roman">Bible</span>. Although the tone of the essay tends to be dogmatic, it is a remarkable achievement for an undergraduate. The analytical precision, logical rigour, and erudition of the work are particularly impressive. Nevertheless, Austin later expressed regret for the position that he had taken and indicated that he &#145;could have written a much better essay on the other side&#146;  (Tollemache, 332).<br>
<br>Recollections of Austin while he was at Cambridge indicate that he was indeed &#145;a king among his fellows&#146;  (Trevelyan, 1.49). The poet John Moultrie extolled his keen wit, subtle intellect, &#145;stores of various learning&#146;, and &#145;huge incumbent weight of understanding&#146;  (Moultrie, 426). John Stuart Mill heard him debate at the Cambridge Union Society, and judged him capable of &#145;dominating the world&#146;  (<span class="italic">Autobiography and Literary Essays</span>, 79, 81). Austin also influenced, if he did not dominate, Thomas Babington Macaulay, another formidable debater at Cambridge. On one occasion they argued &#145;till four in the morning over the comparative merits of the Inductive and the <i>a priori</i> method in politics&#146;  (Trevelyan, 2.278; Hamburger, 145&#150;6). A discussion between them at Lord Lansdowne's country estate may have lasted even longer. According to one account:<blockquote>When the meal [breakfast] was finished they drew their chairs to either end of the chimney piece &hellip; The whole company, ladies, artists, politicians, and diners-out, formed a silent circle round the two Cantabs, and, with a short break for lunch, never stirred till the bell warned them that it was time to dress for dinner. (Trevelyan, 1.51)</blockquote>Although Austin was an ardent utilitarian as an undergraduate, the precise nature of his beliefs is not altogether clear. Moultrie claimed that Austin:<blockquote>
<div>Was nobler than his creed, and though he mock'd<br>
</div>
<div>At things, which, to us poets, seem'd almost<br>
</div>
<div>The breath of human life&#151;romantic love&#151;<br>
</div>
<div>Chivalrous honour&#151;patriotic zeal&#151;<br>
</div>
<div>And loyal self-devotion&#151;there were times<br>
</div>
<div>When even these very themes would kindle up<br>
</div>
<div>The better soul within, and he became,<br>
</div>
<div>Unconsciously, the enthusiast he despised.<br>
</div>
<div>Courteous he was and gentle, even to those<br>
</div>
<div>Whose intellectual rank beneath his own<br>
</div>
<div>Lay lowest &hellip;<br>
</div> (Moultrie, 427)</blockquote>Mill painted a somewhat different picture of Austin as presenting the &#145;Benthamic doctrines&#146; in their most &#145;startling&#146; form. If this was so, he differed from his elder brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/911/', "John Austin")</script>, the legal philosopher, who was a more moderate utilitarian  (<span class="italic">Autobiography and Literary Essays</span>, 81). Charles Austin claimed, however, that he was never an orthodox Benthamite with regard to universal suffrage, which he opposed  (Tollemache, 222, 261). His war against existing institutions has also been described as &#145;mild&#146;, &#145;constitutional&#146;, and &#145;never &hellip; very bitter&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 30 Dec 1874, 8). In any case, he graduated from Cambridge in 1823 and proceeded to an MA in 1827. During this period of his life he wrote for a number of short-lived periodicals, but his specific contributions to them have not been conclusively identified.<h2>
<a name="Thepracticeoflaw"></a>The practice of law</h2>Austin decided to become a lawyer and read law in the chambers of Sir William Follett, a distinguished advocate of the day. He was called to the bar at the Middle Temple in 1827 and joined the Norfolk circuit. His practice flourished, and he was appointed a queen's counsel in 1841  (<span class="italic">Solicitors' Journal</span>, 158). His reputation was such that he was reputedly offered and refused the solicitor-generalship  (Tollemache, 218). He eventually focused his practice on the parliamentary bar, in which he became &#145;pre-eminent&#146;, in the mid-1840s, and his leadership of which was &#145;absolute&#146;  (<span class="italic">Law Times</span>, 147). His success in the committee rooms of parliament was &#145;spectacular&#146;  (Kostal, 124). His intellectual power, articulacy, style, and wit enabled him to stand &#145;without a rival&#146;  (<span class="italic">Suffolk Chronicle</span>, 5). Indeed, his reputation was so high that he allegedly received briefs for the sole purpose of preventing him from representing the other side  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 30 Dec 1874, 8). Clients virtually fought for his services. According to one account:<blockquote>a posse of clients was &hellip; ready to march him off to the particular committee room in which the client was engaged &hellip; they tugged at his gown whilst he was speaking, they besieged his seat, they almost dragged him where they wanted him. (<span class="italic">Suffolk Chronicle</span>, 5)</blockquote>It has been estimated that, at the parliamentary bar, Austin made &#145;one of the largest fortunes recorded in the traditions of the bar&#146;  (<span class="italic">Solicitors' Journal</span>, 158). To be sure, the railroad mania of 1845&#150;7 meant that he may have &#145;floated on the highest tide which ever did or ever can bring fortunes to the parliamentary bar&#146;  (<span class="italic">Law Times</span>, 148). Nevertheless, his unrivalled skill in navigating the currents is a tribute to his exceptional talent as an advocate.<h2>
<a name="Retirement18481874"></a>Retirement, 1848&#150;1874</h2>Austin retired from the practice of law in 1848 while he was at the very height of his powers. His decision was primarily due to the deterioration of his health, a by-product of long hours and overwork. His condition was so bad that he apparently thought that he was near death. According to Lionel Tollemache, who was close to Austin in the final fifteen years of his life, &#145;The seeds of the mischief had been long sown. In early youth, he outgrew his strength; and, like the celebrated John Austin [his brother], he was always nervous and delicate&#146;  (Tollemache, 212).<br>
<br>Austin retired to Brandeston Hall, near Wickham Market, Suffolk, a &#145;large and elegant&#146; Elizabethan mansion which he caused to be substantially rebuilt and restored  (White, 349). Thereafter, he assumed responsibility for the management of the estate, and for the education of his three children with Harriett Jane, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Ingilby, whom he had married on 10 June 1856. He also largely built and financed a local school and completely restored All Saints' Church, Brandeston  (White, 350; Barker, 67). In addition he served as a resident of the Ipswich Mechanics Institution and helped to found Framlingham College, to which his grandson conveyed Brandeston Hall in 1947. Finally he was a bencher of the Middle Temple, high steward of Ipswich, magistrate for Suffolk, and chairman of quarter sessions for east Suffolk. His judicial powers were of &#145;the highest order&#146; and &#145;equalled by only some two or three of the highest &hellip; judges of Westminster&#146; (<span class="italic">Ipswich Journal</span>, 5, and Gousing, 95). His expeditious disposal of the business before him, his &#145;remorseless hatred&#146; of irrelevant arguments, and his ability to grasp a &#145;mass of facts&#146; received special praise  (<span class="italic">Ipswich Journal</span>, 5). As a judge, he was said to be &#145;strictly impartial, and prisoners found in him a considerate exponent of the law. He was never betrayed into severity &hellip; The law was applied irrespective of class considerations&#146;  (<span class="italic">Suffolk Chronicle</span>, 5).<br>
<br>While Austin moderated his youthful radicalism as he grew older, he remained a utilitarian and never forgot his debt to Bentham, his &#145;great master&#146;  (Tollemache, 262). He was also much more liberal than his brother John, who ended his life as an arch-conservative. From Charles Austin's evolutionary perspective almost all English institutions were &#145;mere makeshifts&#146;, and the House of Lords was &#145;not made for perpetuity&#146;  (Tollemache, 223). He also favoured the secret ballot, and was &#145;eager&#146; for a <span class="roman">Reform Bill</span> in 1866  (Tollemache, 223, 260&#150;61). However, he drew the line at the rights of women, much of the language in support of which he regarded as &#145;nauseous&#146;  (Tollemache, 227).<h2>
<a name="Significance"></a>Significance</h2>Charles Austin died at Brandeston Hall on 21 December 1874. He was eulogized as the &#145;most brilliant&#146; man in Suffolk  (<span class="italic">Suffolk Chronicle</span>, 5), &#145;one of the very ablest men of our time&#146;  (Tollemache, 211), and a person of &#145;the greatest capacity and unlimited attainments&#146;  (<span class="italic">Law Times</span>, 147). The word &#145;brilliant&#146; frequently occurs in recollections of him, and with good reason. His extraordinary mastery of the art of conversation particularly impressed his friends and contemporaries (Grote, 254; Tollemache, 213&#150;14; <span class="italic">Autobiography of Henry Taylor</span>, 77). Charles Austin's performance as an advocate was at least as impressive, however, as his conversational powers. Only an exceptionally talented barrister could have achieved the renown that he enjoyed at the parliamentary bar. If his place in the sun was relatively brief, it had a lustre all its own.<br>
