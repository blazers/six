<span class="headword">Drummond,  Andrew</span>  (1688&#150;1769), <span class="occ">goldsmith and banker</span>, was born at Machany, Perthshire, the great-great-grandson of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8069/', "James Drummond, first Lord Maderty")</script>, and the son of Sir John Drummond (<i>d</i>. 1707) and his wife, Margaret, the daughter of Sir William Stewart of Innernytie. Little is known of his early life, though he had four elder brothers, of whom only <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8087/', "William Drummond")</script>, who succeeded as fourth viscount of Strathallan in 1711, survived to adulthood. A decree of forfeiture was passed against Drummond's father in 1690 for his attachment to the Stuarts, and he was imprisoned for a while in Stirling Castle; on proof that his mind was deranged, he was released on 28 July 1692.<br>
<br>Drummond was apprenticed to Colin McKenzie, a goldsmith of Parliament Close, Edinburgh, on 4 May 1705, but in 1712 he is recorded as practising his trade in London, at the sign of the Golden Eagle, Charing Cross. On 7 November 1716 he married Isabella (<i>d</i>. 1731), the daughter of Alexander Strahan or Strachan, a London-Scottish merchant; they had three sons and two daughters. Two of their children survived to adulthood: John (1723&#150;1774), who married Charlotte Beauclerk; and Isabella (<i>c</i>.1720&#150;1740).<br>
<br>In 1717 Drummond began to offer banking services in addition to his goldsmithing work, by which time he was the tenant of one of six newly constructed brick houses alongside Northumberland House. His business came to an abrupt halt on 3 October 1745, when the entries in his customer account ledger for that year were ruled off and balances calculated. A notice was placed in the press arranging to pay off his debts in two &#145;dividends&#146; by March 1746. Tradition has it that the ledger was seized or inspected because Drummond was suspected of Jacobite sympathies, as his brother, Lord Strathallan, was a leading participant in the Jacobite rising of 1745. However, on 15 October 1745 a new ledger was started for those customers who wished to continue with him, although fewer than half of those named in the earlier ledger elected to do so. Drummond took his son John into partnership at that time, and his nephews Robert and Henry also began to work in the bank in 1749.<br>
<br>The banking business gradually recovered, and in 1760 Drummond moved into specially commissioned premises on the west side of Charing Cross (now Whitehall). He lived on the bank premises until 1729, when he purchased Stanmore House, Middlesex. In 1763 work began on the virtual reconstruction of the house to designs of John Vardy, and following Vardy's death in 1765 Sir William Chambers completed and added to the existing works. In 1755 Drummond also bought the family's former estate at Machany, which had been attaindered after the Jacobite rising.<br>
<br>Drummond died on 2 February 1769 at Stanmore House; a memorial to him was placed in Great Stanmore church. At the time of his death the bank was owned jointly with his son John and nephew Robert; it had more than 1500 accounts on its books and annual profits of over &pound;10,000. The clientele included various titled and landed families, but the business was also noteworthy for the number of artists and craftsmen it served, including the painter Thomas Gainsborough, the sculptor Henry Cheere, the plasterer Joseph Rose, the architects Sir William Chambers and Henry Holland, and the landscape gardener Capability Brown. Another distinctive feature was the number of army agents who banked at Drummonds, including from the 1750s Drummond's nephew <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/48025/', "Henry Drummond")</script>, who acted as agent to a number of regiments and obtained lucrative contracts as joint paymaster to the Royal Artillery and the British forces in North America.<br>
<br>A contemporary, John Ramsay of Ochtertyre, remembered Drummond's boast: &#145;I have done great things, and have almost everything I could desire. My son is married into a noble family, and I have planted a colony of Drummonds round Charing Cross which appears to thrive&#146;  (Allardyce, 304).<br>
