<span class="headword">Phipps,  Charles John</span>  (1835&#150;1897), <span class="occ">architect</span>, was born at Lansdowne, near Bath, the son of John Rashleigh Phipps and Elizabeth Ruth Neate. Educated locally at St Catherine's Hermitage, Bath, he was articled to James Wilson (<i>d</i>. 1900) and Thomas Fuller (1822&#150;1898), an architectural partnership which had produced a wide range of designs. In 1857 a brief sketching tour on the continent was followed by the opening of his own practice in Bath, where he also received his first theatre design commission, a reconstruction (1863) of the Theatre Royal, originally designed by George Dance. Supported critically by Edward Godwin, and clearly fulfilling client needs, Phipps designed a further provincial theatre, the Theatre Royal, Nottingham (1865), before opening an office in London in 1866. Phipps had married Honor Hicks of Euborne, Berkshire, on 10 April 1860; they had four children, all born in Bath: Ethel (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1861), Charles (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1862), Alwyn Rashleigh (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1865), and Ida (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1867). The family moved to London in 1868 and lived at 26 Mecklenburgh Square, from where Phipps also practised until his death.<br>
<br>Phipps's move to the capital coincided with a revival in the critical fortunes of the theatre. Although only sporadically involved with designs of the music hall type, Phipps can be regarded as the &#145;establishment&#146; architect for the London theatre in the second half of the century. While contemporary enthusiasts are more aware of the work of Frank Matcham, it was actually Phipps who designed theatres for the leading stage figures of the West End, such as Squire and Marie Bancroft, for whom he reconstructed the Theatre Royal, Haymarket (1880); Richard D'Oyly Carte, for whom he built the Savoy (1881); Henry Irving, the Lyceum (1885); and Herbert Beerbohm Tree, Her Majesty's (1897). Phipps never employed an identifiable decorative style and the decoration of his various theatres responded to the vagaries of contemporary taste: Greek at the Queen's Theatre, Long Acre (1867), and Gothic at the Gaiety (1868). Early theatres employed a range of decorative figurative panels over the proscenium arch; those at the Gaiety Theatre (1868) were executed by Henry Stacy Marks. A particular characteristic of his theatre type was the use of a domestic-scaled lobby and front-of-house space. This reflected on the absence of development space and the commercial pressures of the British theatre, but it also managed to exude an atmosphere of &#145;home&#146; admired by the theatre going public. Phipps's early London theatres developed an auditorium design which only marginally altered over the decades and involved the employment of various tiers with private boxes abutting the proscenium arch. Historically this design type can be traced back to the continental theatre and to a certain extent the Italian Opera House, Haymarket (reconstructed 1790&#150;91 by M. Novosielski; 1816&#150;18 by J. Nash and E. Repton; des., 1867; rebuilt, 1868&#150;9; dem., except the Arcade, <i>c</i>.1895). But Phipps was never afforded the luxury of unlimited space, not to mention funds, in which to give exercise to his imagination. His expertise lay in two directions: his ability to have a theatre erected in a remarkably short time and his ability to accommodate the multifarious requirement of lobbies and backstage requirements in often cramped, ill-lit spaces. While none of his theatres reached the norms advocated by critics such as Sachs and Woodrow, the type was widely popular and his standard London plan was emulated throughout the United Kingdom; George Bernard Shaw, otherwise critical of his work, was full of praise for his last theatre, Her Majesty's, London. During the execution of this work, and while engaged with a further project, the Tivoli Theatre, Dover, Phipps developed a chill (he had for some time suffered from a combination of heart and kidney problems) and died of associated complications on 25 May 1897 at home at 26 Mecklenburgh Square. His funeral service took place at the church of St Alban the Martyr, Holborn, on Friday 28 May and his remains were interred in Highgate cemetery. He was survived by his wife.<br>
