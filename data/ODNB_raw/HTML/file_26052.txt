<span class="headword">Southern <span class="st"> [Soowthern]</span>,  John</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1584), <span class="occ">poet</span>, is known primarily for his translations and imitations of the poetry of the Pl&eacute;iade. It has been speculated that he was either born or educated in France; however, contemporary courtly references and his own identification as an exemplary English poet, &#145;a well learned voice&#146; in &#145;our England&#146;, suggest an English nationality, perhaps connected to the Shropshire family of Southern.<br>
<br>In 1584 Southern published his only volume of verse, <span class="italic">Pandora, the Musyque of the Beautie, of his Mistresse Diana</span>, dedicated to Edward de Vere, seventeenth earl of Oxford. This collection of lyrics largely consists of acknowledged and unacknowledged translations of the poetry of Pierre de Ronsard and Philippe Desportes, and is characterized by distinct technical anomalies for the period&#151;the use of arrhythmic metres, idiosyncratic principles of rhyming, and abbreviated forms of proper nouns. This unconventional style also characterizes four sonnets and two sestets attributed in the text to the countess of Oxford, Anne Cecil de Vere, epitaphs written &#145;after the death of her young sonne the Lord Bulbecke&#146;, as well as a single sonnet attributed in the text to Elizabeth I, an epitaph for the martial protestant princess of the Netherlands, Philippine-Christine de Lalaing. The sonnets attributed to both women contain substantial sections of translation from Desportes's <span class="italic">Cartels et masquarades, &eacute;pitaphes</span>, but the stylistic eccentricities of these sonnets, coupled with their presence in a volume of similar translations, suggest that the women's texts are both examples of prosopopoeia written by Southern.<br>
<br>Southern's methods of translation attracted Puttenham's criticism in <span class="italic">The Arte of English Poesie</span> (1589). Although the entry for Southern opens with his description as one &#145;of reasonable good facilitie in translation&#146;, Puttenham's criticism centres upon Southern's use of French terms in the place of English words, seen as a corruption of the vernacular with &#145;no maner of conformitie with our language either by custome or derivation which may make them tollerable&#146;. Puttenham takes exception to Southern's claim to be the first to imitate Pindar&#151;not because of the claim itself but because of its phrasing as an exact translation of Ronsard's identical claim, and uses him as an example of the vice of unattributed translation: &#145;for in deede as I would wish every inventour which is the very Poet to receave the prayses of his invention, so would I not have a translatour be ashamed to be acknowen of his translation&#146;  (Puttenham, 252&#150;3). Informed by a particularized opposition to the admonitory protestant politics of Southern's text and its unauthorized appropriation of Elizabeth's poetic voice, Puttenham's criticisms are countered by Drayton's qualified praise in &#145;Southerne an English Lyrick&#146; in <span class="italic">Poemes Lyrick and Pastorall</span> (1603):<blockquote>
<div>Southern, I long thee spare,<br>
</div>
<div>Yet wish thee well to fare,<br>
</div>
<div>Who me pleased'st greatly,<br>
</div>
<div>As first, therefore more rare,<br>
</div>
<div>Handling thy harpe neatly.<br>
</div>
</blockquote>Two copies of <span class="italic">Pandora</span> survive: one in the Huntington Library, which belonged to Richard Heber, and a second in the British Museum, which belonged to George Steevens and which contains copious annotations in his hand.<br>
