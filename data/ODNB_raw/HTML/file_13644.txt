<span class="headword">Home,  James</span>, third earl of Home  (1615&#150;1666), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born in the summer of 1615, the eldest son of Sir James Home of Cowdenknowes (<i>d</i>. 1618&times;20) and his wife, Lady Anne (<i>d</i>. 1621), eldest daughter and coheir of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13642/', "George Home, earl of Dunbar")</script>. With the death on 13 February 1633 of his distant cousin James Home, second earl, he became third earl of Home. During his lifetime the second earl had obtained a decreet in favour of his sisters Lady Doune and Lady Maitland against Sir James Home of Cowdenknowes. This decreet reduced the contract of tailzie made between the second earl's father, Alexander, first earl of Home, and Sir John Home of Cowdenknowes and his son Sir James (the third earl's grandfather and father respectively), dated 18 December 1604, in which Lord Home entailed his estates of Home to himself and his heirs-male, whom failing to Sir John Home and Sir James Home and their heirs-male, whom failing to Lord Home and his heirs-female. James Home of Cowdenknowes was able to secure a reversal of the decreet of reduction, after litigation, in March 1634. However, a new patent was not issued by Charles I until 22 March 1636 (dated at Hampton Court), ratifying to him and his heirs-male of the honours, privileges, and precedencies enjoyed by Alexander and James, earls of Home. On 31 July 1637 he had a charter of the barony of Duns, and on 14 July 1638 he had a charter of the lands and the baronies of Dunglas and others. On 1 July 1641 he was served heir male of Alexander, first earl of Home, of Alexander, fifth Lord Home, and of James, second earl of Home.<br>
<br>Home signed the petition against the king's and Archbishop Laud's introduction of the new liturgy in Scotland, and was present in Edinburgh on 20 September 1637 when the petition was presented to James Stewart, duke of Lennox, to be sent to Charles I. Together with John Lindsay, Lord Lindsay, he protested openly at the market cross of Edinburgh against the king's proclamation of 19 February 1638, in the name of the nobility, ministry, barons, and burgesses. John Gordon classes him among those of the commissioners in 1638 who were professed covenanters, or who quickly afterwards declared for the covenant. That year Home served as an elder at the Glasgow general assembly, and on 24 September was appointed by the privy council to oversee the subscription of the national covenant in the sheriffdom of Berwick. Sir James Balfour referred to Home as being among &#145;some of the chieffe covenanters&#146; in March 1639  (<span class="italic">Historical Works of Balfour</span>, 2.321). On 22 March, accompanied by other leading covenanters, Home went at the head of 1000 musketeers to Dalkeith House and forced the lord treasurer, John Stewart, earl of Traquair, to surrender it, when they discovered concealed in it an immense quantity of ammunition and arms, and also the regalia, crown, sceptre, and sword, which they then carried with them to Edinburgh. He was appointed colonel of horse in the covenanting army, and towards the end of the month raised a force of 600 horse. During the second bishops' war (1640&#150;41) he was a colonel of foot. He also attended both the 1639 parliament and the parliamentary sessions of 1640&#150;41.<br>
<br>By contract dated 13 July 1640 Home married Lady Jane, fourth daughter of William Douglas, earl of Douglas. Meanwhile he had become alienated by the radical leadership of Archibald Campbell, earl of Argyll, and he signed the 1640 Cumbernauld bond, drawn up by the earl of Montrose. On 17 November 1641 he was nominated a member of the privy council, but his name was deleted by parliament on the ground that he was opposed to the covenanters. Home presented the royalist &#145;cross petition&#146;, articulated in 1642 and designed to win over moderate covenanting opinion, to the privy council on 10 January 1643, as part of the ongoing struggle in Scotland over whether or not to support Charles I in his conflict with the English parliamentarians. He became sheriff of Berwickshire and he was also present in the 1643 convention of estates. Similarly, he was present in the 1644 convention of estates on 16 April, when he was appointed to the committee for the south for governing the country. That year he was fined &pound;20,000 Scots for violently dispossessing Sir Patrick Hepburn of Waughton of Fast Castle and the adjacent lands of Wester Lumsden. With five other noblemen he voted against rendering the &#145;raising of armes&#146; punishable by &#145;forfaultry&#146;, and also against a similar punishment for &#145;holding houses against the estates of the country&#146;  (<span class="italic">Historical Works of Balfour</span>, 3.200). Home sat in the parliamentary sessions of 1644&#150;6, and was a member of the shire committee of war for Berwickshire in 1644, 1647, and 1648. His increasingly royalist stance was reflected in his attendance at the Engagement Parliament on 2 March 1648, his appointment as colonel of the Berwickshire foot on 4 May, and his membership of the committee of estates on 8 June. He was instructed to levy 1200 men and they crossed the border in July 1648. Home's infantry were involved in the military action of the engagement invasion, but the earl escaped to Scotland following the surrender of the infantry at Warrington Bridge. The English captured 277 of his men, including his lieutenant-colonel.<br>
<br>In 1650, during Home's absence, Home Castle was captured and garrisoned by Cromwellian troops. He repented for his involvement in the engagement, allowing for his political rehabilitation. This was reflected in his appointments to the committee for regulating the affairs of the army on 28 March 1651 and to the committee of estates on 3 June. On 28 March he was also appointed colonel of Berwickshire. On 7 May 1651 he raised a regiment of horse which was part of the 7th cavalry brigade, though it appears that it suffered heavy losses in the Cromwellian victories of that summer. With the Cromwellian conquest of Scotland, Home's estates were forfeited.<br>
<br>At the Restoration, Home went to London as one of a special deputation to represent to the council and to parliament &#145;the grievances of this opprest kingdom&#146;  (Nicoll, 279). In the autumn and winter of 1660 he attended the meetings of the committee of estates, which acted as a provisional government in Scotland until parliament was convened on 1 January 1661. That year he was reinstated in his estates, and was named a member of the Scottish privy council. He was present in the parliamentary sessions of 1661, 1662, and 1663, and on 8 January 1661 was appointed as a member of the standing committee, the lords of the articles. Parliamentary proceedings of April and May 1661 indicate that he was called as a witness in the trial against Archibald Campbell, marquess of Argyll. In November 1661 and July 1663 Home was a member of privy council committees to consider the prevention of theft and robbery in the borders, while in November 1661 he had been appointed to a privy council committee to consider the activities of the minister Robert Blair. In September 1664 he was ordered by the privy council, along with the earls of Haddington and Roxburghe, to provide twenty-six men for service in the English navy. That year he was appointed a member of the high commission for the execution of the law in church affairs, and in February 1663 and November 1664 he was also involved, in his capacity as sheriff of Berwick, in the apprehension in the borders of two Quakers, Andrew Hague and Andrew Robertson. Home sat in the 1665 convention of estates and on 2 August 1665 he was appointed as a member of the committee for inbringing taxation. Shortly before his death, which occurred in December 1666, he had been instructed by the privy council in November to assist in the government preparations against the expected rebel insurrection which came to be known as the Pentland rising.<br>
<br>Home was survived by his wife, who was still alive in 1683. They had a daughter and four sons, of whom Alexander (<i>d</i>. 1674), James (<i>d</i>. 1687), and Charles (<i>d</i>. 1706) successively succeeded their father as fourth, fifth, and sixth earls of Home.<br>
