<span class="headword">Molyneux,  Emery</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1598), <span class="occ">maker of globes and ordnance</span>, came, according to Petruccio Ubaldini, who knew him, &#145;of obscure and humble family background&#146;  (Crin&ograve; and Wallis, 14) and was probably the Emery Molynox who was presented as William Cooke's apprentice to the Stationers' Company in October 1557. By the 1580s he had gained a reputation as an able mathematician and maker of mathematical instruments, working in Lambeth, to the south of London. These skills brought him into the company of Richard Hakluyt and the explorers John Davis, Walter Ralegh, and Thomas Cavendish, and the mathematicians Edward Wright and Robert Hues, and led him to accompany Francis Drake, perhaps on the circumnavigation of 1577&#150;80, for Ubaldini reported &#145;He himself has been in those seas and on those coasts in the service of the same Drake&#146;  (ibid., 13). In his <span class="italic">Pathway to Perfect Sayling</span> (1605) Richard Polter commented that Molyneux had been a skilful maker of compasses and hourglasses.<br>
<br>It seems likely that Davis introduced Molyneux to his own patron, William Sanderson, a rich London merchant. Molyneux and Wright were looking for a sponsor to enable them to build globes promoting England's maritime achievements, and Sanderson provided &pound;1000. Molyneux's globe recorded Drake's track and that of Cavendish, whose own circumnavigation brought him back to England on 9 September 1588. Molyneux gathered information from navigators, and by inspecting rutters and pilots, such as that for Brazil and the West Indies which he gave to Thomas Harriot in 1590. The celestial globe was less original, but was to be used with the terrestrial for oceanic navigation. Wright helped to plot the coastlines and translated some of the legends into Latin; the maps were engraved for printing by Jodocus Hondius. On 10 April 1591 the astrologer and physician Simon Forman visited Molyneux's workshop; he taught Molyneux how to find longitude and claimed to have found an astrological method, which Molyneux challenged him to demonstrate publicly, but to no avail.<br>
<br>The first edition of Hakluyt's <span class="italic">Principal Navigations</span> (1589) announced the imminent appearance of the globes, describing Molyneux as &#145;a rare Gentleman in his profession, being therein for divers yeeres, greatly supported by the purse and liberalitie of the worshipfull merchant M. William Sanderson&#146;  (Hakluyt, 1.xxx). As made, the globes were just over 2 feet in diameter. They were the first to be constructed so as to be unaffected by humidity at sea, and their flour-paste construction was unusual for the time; Simon Forman remarked that Molyneux's moulding or casting process for the globes was &#145;the only way to caste [anything] whatsoever in perfecte forme &hellip; and yt is the perfectest and trewest waie of all wayes &hellip; and this was the wai that Mullenax did use to cast flowere in the verie forme&#146;  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Ashmole 1494, fol. 1491). Ubaldini's letters to the duke of Milan detail Molyneux's progress on their construction: the first pair were presented to Queen Elizabeth at Greenwich in July 1592; another terrestrial globe was presented with entertainments at Sanderson's house in Lambeth. The largest and most prestigious globes, bought by royalty, noblemen, and academic institutions, cost &pound;20 each. One example of this first edition survives at Petworth House, Sussex, and a later one, dated 1603 and bearing the arms which had by then been conferred on Sanderson, is now preserved with its matching celestial globe in Middle Temple Library, London.<br>
<br>Elizabeth immediately realized the propaganda value of these globes, as did other observers: Shakespeare  (<span class="italic">The Comedy of Errors</span>, III.ii) and Thomas Dekker both alluded to them in their plays, Dekker (in <span class="italic">The Gull's Hornbook</span> of 1609) stating:<blockquote>What an excellent workman, therefore, were he that could cast the globe of it into a new mould. And not to make it look like Molyneux his globe, with a round face sleeked and washed over with white of eggs, but to have it in plano as it was at first, with all the ancient circles, lines, parallels and figures. (Dekker, 73)</blockquote>Sanderson presented a lesser globe to Sir Robert Cecil in 1595, together with Hues's &#145;Latin booke that teacheth the use of my great globes&#146;  (Skelton, 7). No examples either of the smaller globes, priced as low as &pound;2 and intended as practical navigation aids for seafarers and students, or of Molyneux's treatise <span class="italic">The Globes Celestial and Terrestrial Set Forth in plano</span>, published by Sanderson in 1592, are known.<br>
<br>Molyneux was still associated with Forman in 1595 when the merchant Robert Parkes was to purchase coal, saltpetre, pitch, oils, and waxes for him, perhaps connected to work on his cannon. Molyneux sought the queen's patronage for this &#145;new invention, of shot and artillery, to be used principally in naval warfare: protection of ports and harbours, a new shot to discharge a thousand musket shot; with wildfire not to be quenched&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1574&#150;80</i>, 339). This undated document is ascribed to 1570, but is surely later, as Molyneux was issued with a royal warrant in March 1593 and the matter was taken up by the privy council on 4 November 1596, when the lord admiral was urged &#145;to speak to Molyneux, Bussy and the two Engleberts about their offensive engines&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1595&#150;7</i>, 303), as part of measures to defend the south coast of England against recusants, a request seemingly ignored. In 1594 Elizabeth granted Molyneux a gift of &pound;200 and an annuity of &pound;50, but these rewards could not prevent him and his wife, Anne, emigrating to Holland in 1597; he surrendered the annuity on his departure. He wished to distribute his globes personally to other European princes, and a base in Amsterdam, fast becoming the centre of globe and map-making, was better for this purpose. Either he or Hondius, who had returned to Amsterdam in 1594, took the printing plates for the globes.<br>
<br>The states general of the United Provinces showed more interest in Molyneux's cannon, granting him a twelve year privilege on a similar invention on 26 January 1598. On 6 June Molyneux lodged a second application, but he died in Amsterdam almost immediately, his wife being granted administration of his estate in England later that month. On 9 April 1599 she was granted a Dutch compassionate pension of 50 florins, suggesting that Molyneux had died in poverty. There appears to have been no surviving family, and the nascent English globe-making industry died with him, though his globes were spoken of in England over forty years later as &#145;yet in being, great and small ones, celestiall and terrestriall, in both our universities and several libraries, here and beyond the seas&#146;  (Sanderson, sig. A3<i>v</i>).<br>
