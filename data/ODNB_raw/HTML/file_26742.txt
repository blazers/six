<span class="headword">Studley,  John</span>  (<em>c.</em>1545&#150;1590?), <span class="occ">translator</span>, was born of a Dorset family and was educated at Westminster School, where he was both one of the original queen's scholars elected on the 1560 foundation and, in 1561, the first to be elected to Trinity College, Cambridge. He graduated BA in 1566 and became a minor fellow on 8 September 1567 and a major fellow on 7 April 1570, the year in which he proceeded MA. In college politics Studley adhered firmly to the puritan party, and followed Thomas Cartwright, the Lady Margaret professor of divinity, in opposing the rule of the master, John Whitgift, who was chiefly responsible for new university statutes aimed against puritans. In 1572 Studley's signature appears as one of 164 declaring opposition to these statutes, and on 1 February 1573 he was convened before the heads of colleges on a charge of nonconformity; he vacated his fellowship at the end of that year. As a rebellious fellow Studley probably also shared in the disfavour with which Whitgift regarded the new Westminster foundation scholars.<br>
<br>Studley's years at Trinity were otherwise occupied by his translation of four of Seneca's tragedies: the <span class="italic">Agamemnon</span> and <span class="italic">Medea</span>, published in 1566 by Thomas Colwell (the former being the earlier work, with prefatory verses asking the reader's indulgence on account of Studley's youth and inexperience); the <span class="italic">Hippolytus</span>, which was entered in 1567 in the Stationers' register by Henry Denham, although no copy survives; and the <span class="italic">Hercules Oeteus</span>, first printed in Thomas Newton's 1581 collected edition entitled <span class="italic">Seneca, his Tenne Tragedies, Translated into Englysh</span>, along with the other three. Studley's translating style was popular and colloquial, the verse heavy if exuberant and tending to obscure the sharp detonations of the original, with no apparent effort to reproduce an epigrammatic style; the restrictively archaic &#145;fourteener&#146; metre was employed. Studley treated his original text freely, inserting into the <span class="italic">Medea</span> a new chorus of his own emphasizing Jason's inconstancy in love, and adding an entire scene to the <span class="italic">Agamemnon</span> re-narrating the death of Cassandra, the imprisonment of Electra, and the flight of Orestes. These additions, however imperfect, are an early example of breaking away from the prescribed letter of the text, while the move towards moral order and social reintegration in the translations is, if un-Senecan, an expression of contemporary taste.<br>
<br>Studley also wrote Latin verses addressed to Sir William Cecil (the dedicatee of his <span class="italic">Agamemnon</span>) and Latin elegies marking the death of Nicholas Carr, professor of Greek at Cambridge, which were printed with the latter's Latin translation of Demosthenes in 1571. These demonstrate Studley's close involvement with elements of a mid-century Cambridge literary humanism which, through personal contacts, linked many of the classical scholars of the day. In 1574 Studley published a translation &#145;with sondrye additions&#146; of Bale's <span class="italic">Acta pontificum Romanorum</span> as <span class="italic">The pageant of the popes, conteyning the lyves of all the bishops of Rome from the beginninge of them to the yeare 1555</span>, dedicated to Thomas Radcliffe, earl of Sussex (title-page). This work, not to the taste of later scholarly orthodoxy, was dismissed by Thomas Warton as a misapplication of the time and talents of one &#145;qualified for better studies&#146;  (Warton, 4.272).<br>
<br>Little is known of Studley's later career. He married Maria Baskervill of Nethwood, Thornbury, Herefordshire, and they had a son and a daughter. He seems to have been a member of Barnard's Inn, London, and is said to have crossed to Flanders where he held a command under Prince Maurice, and died at the siege of Breda (1590), although no contemporary authority places him there.<br>
<br>Opinion of the literary merit of Studley's translations has differed; C. S. Lewis thought them &#145;execrable &hellip; the metre is a torment to the ear, the language at once artless and unnatural&#146;  (Lewis, 256) yet T. S. Eliot found in them &#145;poetic charm &hellip; with occasional flashes of real beauty&#146;  (Newton, 1.vi). Perhaps his most lasting literary bequest was unintentional; it was in Studley's translation of &#145;Tacitae Stygis&#146; as &#145;Stygian Puddle glum&#146;  (ibid., 1.158) that Lewis, despite his revulsion, found the name for one of his most memorable Narnian characters.<br>
