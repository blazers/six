<span class="headword">Adler,  Jakub <span class="st"> [Jankel]</span></span>  (1895&#150;1949), <span class="occ">painter</span>, was born on 26 July 1895 in Tuszyn, near &#321;&oacute;d&#378;, Poland, the eighth of the twelve children of Eliasz Adler, a timber and coal dealer, and his wife, Hana Laja, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Fiter. Adler grew up in &#321;&oacute;d&#378; in the world of Hasidic Jewry, which had a lasting influence on his subject matter. After training as a goldsmith in Belgrade, he moved to Barmen, Germany, in 1913. He stayed there until the end of the First World War, studying at the Kunstgewerbeschule in Barmen (under Gustav Wieth&uuml;chter) and at the Akademie der K&uuml;nste in D&uuml;sseldorf. In 1918 he returned to &#321;&oacute;d&#378;, where he co-founded the Jewish artistic association Ing Idisz (&#145;Young Yiddish&#146;).<br>
<br>After lengthy visits to Warsaw, Paris, and Berlin, Adler lived in D&uuml;sseldorf from 1922 to 1933. Throughout this period he was active in the artistic life of both the Rhineland and Berlin, participating in various exhibitions, among them a show with Franz W. Seiwert at the Barmen Museum in 1928, the Internationale Ausstellung revolution&auml;rer K&uuml;nstler held in Berlin in 1922, and several exhibitions of the Novembergruppe, the latter demonstrating his left-wing attitudes. In 1923 he became a member of the Rheingruppe, and in 1932 joined the Selection e. V., a Berlin-based artists' association to which, among others, Wassily Kandinsky and Lyonel Feininger belonged. In the 1920s Adler won his first prizes, including a gold medal for <span class="italic">Katzen</span> (1927, Cologne, Museum Ludwig). His paintings of this period are dominated by static human figures and heavy facial features and limbs derived from expressionism and cubism.<br>
<br>In the 1930s Adler's works grew more objective. He also produced abstract paintings, for example, <span class="italic">Composition</span> (1933, priv. coll., Tel Aviv). This development may have been influenced by Paul Klee, with whom he worked from 1931 in the Akademie der K&uuml;nste in D&uuml;sseldorf, where they both had studios. Their time together is the basis of an article later published by Adler: &#145;Memories of Paul Klee&#146;  (<span class="italic">Horizon</span>, 6, 1942, 264&#150;7). In 1933 he participated in a show of the Collective Artists' Association, held at the Rockefeller Center in New York. In the same year he signed, with other left-wing artists and intellectuals, the <span class="roman">Urgent Appeal</span> against the newly elected Nazi government. Because he was Jewish, his works were included in the exhibition Kulturbolschewistische Bilder, held in Mannheim in 1933 and labelled &#145;degenerate&#146;. As a result of further discrimination, he left Germany.<br>
<br>From 1933 to 1940 Adler lived in France, in Paris, Argel&egrave;s-sur-Mer, and Cagnes-sur-Mer, except for a two-year stay in Poland (1935&#150;7) during which he was reunited with his wife, Betty Kohlhaas (1899&#150;1971), a drawing teacher, and his daughter, Nina (<i>b</i>. 1927). His works were shown in the Exhibition of German-Jewish Artists' Work held in the Parsons' Galleries, London, in 1934. This was organized by Carl Braunschweig in order to draw attention to the Nazis' infamous art policy, but it did not prevent the notorious Entartete Kunst (&#145;Degenerate art&#146;) exhibition in Munich in 1937, where Adler's paintings hung under the slogan &#145;Offenbarung der j&uuml;dischen Rassenseele&#146; (&#145;Revelation of the Jewish racial soul&#146;).<br>
<br>In 1940 Adler left France with the Polish foreign army, in which he was a volunteer, and went to Scotland, where he was soon demobilized on health grounds. Except for a brief visit to the artists' colony in Kirkcudbright, he stayed in Glasgow from 1941 to 1943. He soon showed his works in one-man exhibitions, at the studio of the sculptor Benno Schotz, who introduced him to his supporters, Moray Glasser and Fred Nettler, and at the Annan Gallery, Glasgow. Together with his fellow countryman, the painter Josef Herman, whom he had met in Poland in 1936, he became one of the early members of the Glasgow New Art Club, founded by John Duncan Fergusson in 1940.<br>
<br>In 1943 Adler moved to London, where he eventually settled in one of the studios at 77 Bedford Gardens. There he met the poet Michael Hamburger (who dedicated a poem to him entitled &#145;Flowering cactus: in memoriam Jankel Adler&#146;) and the three painters Robert Colquhoun, Robert MacBryde, and John Minton, who were his neighbours. Although all of them were affected by Adler, it was Colquhoun who most reflected his influence. As well as giving stylistic advice (regarding surface patterning and treatment of form), he encouraged Colquhoun to study his Celtic roots. At the same time, Adler's own paintings grew more expressive and the shapes of the objects more angular. Further, in addition to Jewish subject matter, the fate of mankind became significant, as in <span class="italic">The Mutilated</span> (1942, Tate collection). Besides his contacts with British artists he also met fellow refugee painters, including Martin Bloch and Ludwig Meidner, in the Ohel, a club run by the brothers Alexander and Benjamin Margulies in 1943&#150;4. In 1945 he moved to Aldbourne, Wiltshire, where he died at his home, Whitley Cottage, of a heart attack on 25 April 1949; he was buried in Aldbourne. His death occurred just after his application for British citizenship had been rejected because of his contacts with anarchist groups.<br>
<br>Since the end of the Second World War Adler's works have been shown in one-man exhibitions held at home and abroad, including a memorial show organized by the Arts Council in 1951 and a touring exhibition in Germany organized by the Wuppertal Art and Museum Association in 1955. The largest exhibition of his work, including over 150 paintings and drawings, was held in D&uuml;sseldorf, Tel Aviv, and &#321;&oacute;d&#378; in 1985&#150;6. Examples of Adler's work are in the Tate collection, the Tel Aviv Museum of Art, Israel, the Museum Ludwig, Cologne, and the Kunstmuseum im Ehrenhof, D&uuml;sseldorf.<br>
