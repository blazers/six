<span class="headword">Blow <span class="st"> [Blaw]</span>,  James</span>  (1676&#150;1759), <span class="occ">printer and bookseller</span>, was born on 29 July 1676, the youngest of nine children of John Blaw (<i>d</i>. 1709) of Culross, Perthshire, Scotland, and his first wife, Elizabeth Wilson. The Blaw family had owned Castlehill estate in Culross parish at least since 1543, and James was the first in the family to change the surname to Blow, this spelling subsequently being adopted by the Belfast branch of the family.<br>
<br>James Blow achieved a long career as printer and bookseller. In 1694 he arrived in Belfast as assistant to <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/19864/', "Patrick Neill")</script>, who set up the first printing press in the town at the request of the sovereign (mayor) of Belfast, William Craford; James married Patrick's sister Abigail, and in 1688 his own sister Agnes had married Patrick. The first Belfast printed book was an edition of <span class="italic">The Confession of Faith</span> (1694). James took over the printing establishment from Patrick Neill about 1705, the earliest surviving example from his own press being James Kirkpatrick's sermon <span class="italic">The Saint's Life and Death</span> (1706). Many of the earliest books that Blow produced omitted details of author, printer, and location, since they were printed without permission of the religious authorities. The first important work printed by James Blow was Kirkpatrick's <span class="italic">An Historical Essay upon the Loyalty of Presbyterians</span> in 1713, which is the first printed work to mention contemporary Belfast citizens, and provides a picture of the political and social position of Presbyterians in Belfast. In these pages the justification for the Blow press can be seen in the defence of printing Presbyterian books, which in Dr William Tisdall's castigating phrase &#145;corrupts the principles of the people&#146;  (Kirkpatrick, 523). In 1714 Blow printed <span class="italic">The Experienced Huntsman</span> by Arthur Stringer, the first secular work by a local author originally printed in Belfast. In 1722 he printed <span class="italic">The Church Catechism in Irish</span> by Francis Hutchinson, bishop of Down and Connor, in which Hutchinson strenuously supported the use of roman characters for the Irish language in print, and presented his Raghlin alphabet (named after Rathlin Island where he began his evangelizing mission). The personal autograph of James Blow can be seen in several copies of I. Watts's <span class="italic">A Guide to Prayer</span> (1738) and W. Guthrie's <span class="italic">A Christian's Great Interest</span> (1743) in the inscription at the end of the printed presentation: &#145;This Practical Piece of Piety, being a great help to Devotion, is with a religious Respect Recommended to my worthy friend By&#146;.<br>
<br>The least understood aspect of James Blow's printing history is his production of bibles. Blow's <span class="roman">Bible</span> is dated 1751 and has the imprint &#145;Belfast: Printed by and for James Blow&#146;. In several copies of the edition it can be clearly seen that this title-page is a replacement. A second version, the &#145;Genesis reprint&#146;, is just the first two gatherings reprinted from the 1751 <span class="roman">Bible</span> to replace the first two gatherings in various older bibles of a similar size. The two surviving copies of the so-called Blow 1702 <span class="roman">Bible</span> are in fact 1751 Blow bibles with the roman numeral date defaced to read 1702. A group of bibles and <span class="roman">New</span> Testaments variously imprinted &#145;James Blow&#146;, &#145;George Grierson&#146;, &#145;1745&#146;, &#145;1755&#146;, and &#145;1768&#146; all have a common source. A <span class="roman">Bible</span> printed by James Blow in 1725 claims on the title-page to have been printed in London in 1684. The so-called Sin-on-more <span class="roman">Bible</span> was printed with an unfortunate typesetting transposition for &#145;Sin no more&#146; and required replacement of the relevant sheet in &#145;upwards of 8000 copies&#146; but the exact edition has not been identified  (Hodgson, 76). It was claimed in his obituary that James Blow printed the first English edition of the <span class="roman">Bible</span> in Ireland, and this is repeated by his son Daniel in 1806, although no Blow <span class="roman">Bible</span> has yet been identified that is earlier than a 1714 Dublin <span class="roman">Bible</span>.<br>
<br>Blow died in Belfast; the charity board from the old parish church there recorded that &#145;Mr James Blow dyed the 16th August 1759&#146; and left &pound;40 10<i>s</i>. 0<i>d</i>. to the poor of the parish. He was succeeded by his son Daniel, after whose death in 1810 the original wooden press was reportedly still in use in Youghal, co. Cork, as late as 1824. James Blow's daughter Jane married the king's printer in Dublin, George Grierson, who was in turn succeeded by her son Hugh Boulter Grierson.<br>
