<span class="headword">D'Albert,  Eugen Francis Charles</span>  (1864&#150;1932), <span class="occ">pianist and composer</span>, was born on 10 April 1864 at 4 Crescent Place, Glasgow, the son of Charles Louis Napol&eacute;on D'Albert (1809&#150;1886) and his wife, Annie Rowell (1826/7&#150;1911). His father, though born in Germany, was a musician of mixed Italian and French descent who had established himself as a dancing-master and composer first in London, then in Newcastle, where he met a local girl, Annie Rowell, whom he married in Paris in 1863. They then settled in Glasgow, where their son was born and brought up.<br>
<br>At the age of ten D'Albert attended the New Music School in London, whose director was Arthur Sullivan, and he became the pupil of John Stainer and Ebenezer Prout. His talents as a pianist were soon noticed: at sixteen he played Schumann's piano concerto at the Crystal Palace, and a year later he played a concerto of his own composition in London under Hans Richter. Richter agreed to take him to Vienna, where he came to the notice of Brahms, Eduard Hanslick, and, through Richter's introduction, Liszt. His career henceforth was based entirely in Germany, where his fame as a pianist grew. Liszt referred to him as the &#145;young Tausig&#146;, and he toured widely, notably to the United States in 1904&#150;5. In 1895 he was appointed conductor at Weimar but resigned immediately when he found that the position was shared by two others. He changed his first name from Eug&egrave;ne to Eugen and identified wholly with German culture. He took Swiss citizenship in 1914 and resided mostly thereafter in Z&uuml;rich. His private life, like his concert career, was restless, for he was married six times and had eight children. Louise Salingr&eacute; was his first wife. The second was the Venezuelan pianist, singer, and conductor Teresa Carre&ntilde;o, who had played to Abraham Lincoln in the White House before D'Albert was born. Little is known about his later wives, who were Hermine Finck, Ida Fulda, Fritzi Jauner, and Hilde Fels, or his final partner Virginia Zanetti.<br>
<br>As a composer D'Albert was immensely prolific. He had considerable success with his piano and chamber music, and he gave a lot of attention to the stage, composing altogether twenty-one operas, all of which were staged in German theatres. His style derived from German Romantic music, especially that of Schumann and Brahms, with later modern touches in the manner of Richard Strauss and Hans Pfitzner, both of whom were his friends. He also formed close relationships with Engelbert Humperdinck and the dramatist Gerhart Hauptmann. His cello concerto (1899) is an appealing work in a compressed one-movement form modelled on Weber and Liszt. The seventh of his operas, <span class="italic">Tiefland</span>, first performed in Prague in 1903, was a worldwide success and has still not entirely disappeared from the repertory. <span class="italic">Flauto solo</span>, a comic opera first performed in 1905, was successful also. His last complete opera, <span class="italic">Die schwarze Orchidee</span> (Leipzig, 1928), betrayed signs of a more playful modernism, but his debt to German traditions was strong. <span class="italic">Tiefland</span> is based on a drama by the Catalan playwright Angel Guimer&aacute;, with a story of violent sexual passion set in the foothills of the Pyrenees. It provides a link between Italian <i>verismo</i> and German expressionist opera, although the orchestral textures recall a more Wagnerian language. D'Albert was also a prolific composer of lieder.<br>
<br>D'Albert's fame as a pianist was based on a formidable virtuoso technique, sometimes compared to that of Busoni. He was not a teacher, but he imparted the spirit of his playing in his editions of Bach's preludes and fugues and of Beethoven's sonatas. He also transcribed Bach's organ works for the piano and composed a cadenza for Beethoven's piano concerto no. 4. His work as a composer, especially for the theatre, drew him gradually away from the concert stage, so that he never came to be recognized as truly the equal of Busoni, Paderewski, and the many other keyboard giants who emerged at the beginning of the century. D'Albert died in Riga, Latvia, on 3 March 1932, and was buried in Morcote, near Lugano, Switzerland.<br>
