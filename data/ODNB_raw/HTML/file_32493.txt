<span class="headword">Coles,  Charles Edward</span> <span class="st"> [<em>called </em>Coles Pasha]</span>  (1853&#150;1926), <span class="occ">prison administrator in Egypt</span>, was born at Buge, India, on 17 November 1853, the only son of Major-General Thomas Gordon Coles of the Indian army, and his wife, Maria, daughter of Colonel Charles D'Oyle Straker, also of the Indian army. After being educated privately at Bath, Coles entered the Indian police department in 1873, serving in the Bombay residency. In 1881 he married Mary Emma Isabella (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Alston) of Odell, Bedfordshire. They had four sons (two of whom died in the First World War) and two daughters. In 1883 his services were lent to the Egyptian government, which in 1884 appointed him deputy inspector-general of police. From 1894 to 1897 he held the post of commandant of the Cairo city police. Upon his promotion in 1897 to the office of director-general of Egyptian prisons, Coles began the most important phase of his career.<br>
<br>During the sixteen years (1897&#150;1913) of his administration of the prison department Coles transformed the Egyptian prisons, once a source of reproach to the government, into a source of pride. In the period before he began work Egyptian finances had been limited and the prison budget insufficient. Prisoners were lodged in disused barracks, factories, and other inadequate and insanitary buildings, and no regular provision was made either for feeding or for clothing the inmates. Coles took up his duties with energy and enthusiasm, and with plans for large-scale reform. Egypt had recently become more prosperous, and Coles approached the financial authorities with determination, informing them that he should require &pound;E500,000 for the rebuilding of all the prisons, and probably an additional &pound;E150,000 a year for their maintenance. Sixteen years later he was able to boast that he had spent &pound;E473,738 on building, and that the budgetary provision for maintenance in the preceding year had been &pound;E160,000.<br>
<br>Among other reforms achieved during Coles's administration, arrangements were made for trades to be taught and practised in prisons, and for short-term inmates to work off their sentences in supervised work outside the prison walls. Boys' and girls' reformatories, conducted on contemporary English principles of character training, were established; and a reformatory was created for adults under &#145;indeterminate sentences&#146;, which appears to have been the first institution of its kind in the world. In the course of his service Coles had to deal with two or three serious convict riots and he made a point of relying largely on his personal influence with the prisoners to restore order. When shooting prisoners seemed unavoidable, he shot them himself.<br>
<br>The development of the Egyptian prison system under Coles's administration was his most important achievement, but he did not spend all his time in official duties. He was a keen sportsman who became a leading figure in Egyptian racing, and was the founder of the Alexandrian Sporting Club and of the Egyptian Jockey Club. In 1900 Coles was created CMG for his services abroad and retired in 1913 to Somerset where he wrote <span class="italic">Recollections and Reflections</span>, which was published in 1918. In 1921 he moved to Biarritz, France, publishing <span class="italic">Occupational Franchise</span> in 1922. He died at his home, the Villa Sans Atout, Biarritz, on 12 November 1926.<br>
