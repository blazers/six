<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Marsden,  Kate</span>  (1859&#150;1931), <span class="occ">traveller and nurse</span>, was born on 13 May 1859 at the Parade, Edmonton, Middlesex, youngest of the eight children of Joseph Daniel Marsden, solicitor, and Sophia Matilda Willsted. She was educated at home, except for a brief stay at a boarding-school in Margate. Her father's death on 4 August 1873 plunged the family dramatically from affluence to poverty. In 1876 or 1877 Kate was accepted to train as a nurse at the Tottenham Hospital, Snell's Park, Edmonton, a protestant evangelical institution which gave equal weight to evangelism and nursing in the training of its &#145;deaconesses&#146;. In 1877 she volunteered to join a party of nurses going to Bulgaria to tend Russian soldiers wounded in the Russo-Turkish War. Here she had her first encounter with leprosy, an event which had a lasting impact on her life. She returned to Britain to take up a nursing position at the Westminster Hospital and in 1878 became sister in charge of the Woolton Convalescent Home in Liverpool. Ill health forced her retirement in 1882.<br>
<br>In November 1884 Kate went with her mother to New Zealand to look after a sister dying of consumption. There is no full record of how she spent her time in New Zealand but the visit cannot have been a happy one. A &#145;serious accident&#146; terminated her short period as lady superintendent of Wellington Hospital. During her service there, however, she had greatly improved the hospital.<br>
<br>Kate decided to dedicate her life to the care of sufferers from leprosy. When she returned to Britain in 1889 she was presented at court to Queen Victoria and obtained an introduction from the princess of Wales to her sister, the empress of Russia. She set off for Russia, using the presentation of a Red Cross medal for her work in Bulgaria as the occasion to investigate the incidence of leprosy throughout Russia and the Near and Middle East. Finding that the lot of the Siberian leprosy sufferers was particularly bad, on 1 February 1891 she set out for Siberia with a Russian-speaking friend, Ada Field. Travelling by sledge in bitterly cold weather and great discomfort they reached Omsk, where Field gave up and Kate pressed on alone to Irkutsk, via Tomsk and Krasnoyarsk, visiting prisons as she went. She reached Yakutsk by barge and from there, in June, left on horseback for Vilyuysk, a zigzagging ride of 2000 miles. Pestered by mosquitoes and summer storms, she rode through forests and swamps and over land burning below the surface so that there was &#145;always danger of a horse breaking the crust and sinking into the fire&#146;  (Middleton, 142). On this most arduous section of her journey she found the plight of the leprosy sufferers truly piteous. She gave what immediate relief she could and interested civil and church authorities in her mission. After returning exhausted to Moscow, she continued to canvas for support, raising through a London committee some &pound;2400 to build and equip a leprosy hospital which was opened in Vilyuysk in 1897. <span class="italic">On Sledge and Horseback to Outcast Siberian Lepers</span> (1893) described her remarkable journey.<br>
<br>In 1892 Kate Marsden was elected one of the first female fellows of the Royal Geographical Society. On 16 August 1894, however, a letter to <span class="italic">The Times</span> from Alexander Francis, pastor of the St Petersburg British&#150;American church and the secretary of a committee of investigation into Kate Marsden's work, destroyed her reputation in Britain, though not in Siberia, and brought to an end her humanitarian work. The powerful British Charity Organization Society wrote an unfavourable report on her fund. Quite what it was that led to Kate's fall from grace has never been clear. Hints of financial impropriety and lesbianism cannot explain why Isabel Hapgood, an American translator, worked so remorselessly for her destruction. Kate tried to defend herself in the press but she abandoned her libel action against Francis in 1895, perhaps because of lack of money, perhaps because she wanted to be spared a damaging cross-examination. Some continued to believe in her: in 1906 she was presented for a second time at court and in 1916 she received the rare distinction of honorary life fellowship of the Royal Geographical Society. These, a sympathetic biography of 1895, and her own <span class="italic">My Mission in Siberia: a Vindication</span> (1921) failed to re-establish her good name, and she died poor, unmarried, and forgotten at Springfield House, Beechcroft Road, Wandsworth, London, on 26 March 1931, having been an invalid for thirty years.<br>
<br>In her prime, however, Kate Marsden must have had a magnetism and urgency which are not conveyed by the stilted phrases of Johnson's <span class="italic">Life of Kate Marsden</span>, which speaks of her tall stately appearance in her &#145;nurse's garb&#146;. The real Kate Marsden, who charmed the tsarina and her ladies-in-waiting and blasted her way through the embattled bureaucracy of imperial Russia, must have been a very different and infinitely more impressive figure.<br>
