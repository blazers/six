<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Benenson,  Peter James Henry</span>  (1921&#150;2005), <span class="occ">barrister and human rights campaigner</span>, was born on 31 July 1921 at 6 Albert Court, Knightsbridge, London, the only child of Lieutenant-Colonel Harold Josiah Solomon (1885&#150;1930), army officer, and his wife, Flora (1895&#150;1984), daughter of the Jewish Russian banker Grigori Benenson. He became known as Peter Solomon-Benenson in 1939, following the death of his grandfather, before formally adopting the surname Benenson in 1949. After education at home (where his tutors included W. H. Auden) he studied at Summer Fields preparatory school in Oxford, Eton College, and&#151;briefly, due to the onset of the Second World War&#151;at Balliol College, Oxford. While at Eton he actively supported the cause of the Spanish republic and assisted child refugees from Nazi Germany. During the war he served in military intelligence at Bletchley Park. On 25 August 1941 he married Margaret Susan Anderson (1917&#150;2004), daughter of Hector James Anderson, a civil servant in South Africa. They had two daughters.<br>
<br>After the war Benenson, who was called to the bar in 1948, became involved in Labour Party politics, standing unsuccessfully in all four general elections of the 1950s. More significantly for his later career, however, he had become active in monitoring political trials in Franco's Spain from 1948 onwards, and by the mid-1950s this had broadened into a more general interest in violations of human rights. His interest was sharpened by his experiences in Cyprus, which he first visited in October 1956, where he called for the proper investigation of Cypriot allegations of abuses by the British authorities. In 1957 he played a central role in the establishment of Justice, a cross-party organization of British lawyers dedicated to upholding the rule of law.<br>
<br>In the late 1950s Benenson went through a period of profound personal reassessment. He retired from the bar due to ill health in 1960 and went to recuperate in his beloved Italy. He had converted to Catholicism in 1958 and distanced himself from party politics. On his return to Britain in the autumn of 1960 he conceived the idea of a year-long campaign for the release of those imprisoned for their beliefs&#151;the &#145;prisoners of conscience&#146;. He galvanized the support of a group of like-minded lawyers, journalists, and other opinion formers, and the Appeal for Amnesty, 1961 (which formally became known as Amnesty International in 1962) was launched with Benenson's clarion-call article on &#145;The forgotten prisoners&#146; in <span class="italic">The Observer</span> on 28 May 1961. The article, which received much international attention, evoked a remarkable response and Benenson soon found himself at the head of a voluntary movement with branches across Britain and western Europe. He also contributed a <span class="roman">Penguin Special</span> entitled <span class="italic">Persecution 1961</span>, which presented case studies of nine political prisoners.<br>
<br>Between 1961 and 1966 Benenson was at the height of his powers. His tireless and charismatic leadership, as well as his willingness to draw on his great range of political and personal connections, all greatly facilitated Amnesty's rapid early growth. During its first three years alone Amnesty adopted 1367 prisoners (of whom 329 were released) and organized 360 groups in 14 countries. Although others played a valuable role, Benenson was Amnesty's unquestioned inspiration and leader: in the words of one colleague &#145;Amnesty was Peter&#146;. He oversaw the development of an archive of information on political prisoners, and addressed countless meetings of the local groups that campaigned for their release. His idea that these groups should campaign for three prisoners (from the West, the communist states, and the third world) was highly innovative and reinforced the movement's impartiality. He undertook some early investigative missions, notably to Haiti where he posed as an artist while researching the crimes of the Duvalier regime. He also had a keen eye for the power of symbols and provided the concept for the famous Amnesty motif&#151;a candle in barbed wire.<br>
<br>Even during these early years, however, there were signs of problems to come. Benenson had little time for administration, and organization was often chaotic. Tellingly, he would later confide that &#145;It has always seemed to me that a humanitarian movement should decide its actions from the heart not from the book of law&#146;  (Benenson to Marie-Jos&eacute; Protais, 11 July 1991, Amnesty International papers). He was also overly trusting of Harold Wilson's new Labour government. In 1966&#150;7 Amnesty was engulfed in a complex crisis that had two distinct components. First, there was the damaging revelation that Benenson had agreed for Amnesty to channel secret British government funds to the families of political prisoners in Rhodesia. Second, Amnesty crossed swords with Wilson's government over its allegations of torture in the crown colony of Aden. The crisis culminated in the allegation by Benenson, now under severe mental strain, that British intelligence had infiltrated Amnesty. In March 1967 he was forced to stand down as president. Benenson's break with Amnesty was a cause of great sadness on both sides, but was not permanent. He formally rejoined the organization in 1978, and Amnesty's leaders continued to seek out his advice. He remained very proud of his creation&#151;especially when it was awarded the Nobel peace prize in 1977&#151;although he also continued to argue that its headquarters should move to a neutral country.<br>
<br>In 1967 Benenson withdrew to farm near Aylesbury, but he remained an active campaigner for human rights, and created a number of new organizations. These included Pour l'Imaginaire (1978), a trust fund to aid persecuted artists and writers, and Nevermore (1980), a campaign to address the roots of conflict. He later became chairman of Action by Christians against Torture. However, his most significant contribution in these years was arguably his role as co-founder of the Coeliac Society in 1968 (Benenson himself had been recently diagnosed with the condition). His first marriage ended in divorce in 1973, and on 3 August the same year he married Susan Elizabeth Booth (<i>b</i>. 1944), daughter of James Booth, heating engineer. They had a son and a daughter. Benenson suffered a car accident in 1993 and his final years, which he spent at Nuneham Courtenay near Oxford, were marked by serious ill health.<br>
<br>Peter Benenson was offered&#151;and refused to accept&#151;an honour from the British state. However, he accepted the Gandhi peace award in 1978 (for pioneering a method of checking the &#145;vicious devices in various lands for the suppression of political dissent&#146;), and an honorary fellowship of Balliol College (2002). His reputation will always be associated with Amnesty International, his finest achievement. Those who worked with Benenson at that time saw him as an inspirational, dynamic force. In the words of one close associate, Peggy Crane, he was an &#145;evangelist with a divine spark&#146;  (Buchanan, &#145;Truth will Set You Free&#146;, 597). His thinking was coloured by a deep spirituality, and he presented his thoughts on the role of religion in world history in <span class="italic">The Other Face</span>, a short book privately published in 1977. However, he never lost sight of the need to employ practical&#151;and sometimes shocking&#151;means to arouse what he termed &#145;the world conscience&#146;. He was a man of powerful and impulsive enthusiasms, and these qualities were essential to the founding and early advance of Amnesty International. He died on 25 February 2005 at the John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford.<br>
