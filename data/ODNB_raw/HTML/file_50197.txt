<span class="headword">Creton,  Jean</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1386&#150;1420), <span class="occ">historian and poet</span>, was probably a native of the &Icirc;le-de-France. Nothing is known of his family, his early life, or the place and date of his birth and death. By 1386 he had entered the service of Philip, duke of Burgundy, supplying him with a book, possibly his own composition. In April 1399 he was sent by Charles VI of France (<i>r</i>. 1380&#150;1422) to accompany Richard II on his fateful expedition to Ireland. When news of Henry Bolingbroke's invasion reached Richard in Ireland, Creton sailed for north Wales with the earl of Salisbury, &#145;for the sake of song and merriment&#146;  (Creton, &#145;Metrical history&#146;, 314). After Richard II had rejoined the earl, Creton remained in his entourage until his capture at Conwy. Creton returned to France in September 1399, where he composed an account in verse and prose of <span class="italic">La prinse et mort du roy Richart</span>, presented to the duke of Burgundy before July 1402. The <span class="italic">Prinse</span> reported the official story of the death of Richard II by starvation, but expressed Creton's belief that the body buried with royal pomp and circumstance was that of Richard Maudeleyn, who strongly resembled the king. He believed that Richard himself was alive and in prison. Shortly after completing his work, however, news arrived at the French court that Richard was at liberty in Scotland. In the spring of 1402 Creton was dispatched there by the duke of Burgundy to ascertain the truth of this report. The letter he wrote upon his return reveals that he was now convinced that Richard II was dead. In 1403 Creton was rewarded for his efforts by the honourable position of <i>valet de chambre</i> of the duke of Burgundy. By 1410 he was also <i>valet</i> to the king of France, and in the following year was given the important post of <i>clerc payeur des &#339;uvres du roy</i> in the provostry of Paris, a post he held in 1413 and again in 1420, when he was given assistance in paying his ransom. His terms of office coincided with periods of Burgundian ascendancy in Paris, so he may, as a servant of the duke of Burgundy, have been seized during the Armagnac proscription of 1413. Nothing is known of his subsequent career.<br>
<br>Creton's historical importance rests on his history of &#145;the capture and death of King Richard&#146; and his letters recounting his Scottish journey. The former contains a vivid account of Irish customs and manners, but its principal interest is the light it throws upon the Lancastrian usurpation. For many of the key episodes Creton is the sole witness, and for others his testimony conflicts with the official story propagated by English sources. Creton alone, for instance, reports the circumstances in which news of Bolingbroke's invasion was received in Ireland, and he is the sole source for the division of Richard's army, and for the activities of the earl of Salisbury in north Wales. Creton, too, is the only authority for the situation of the king and his tiny entourage in north Wales. Above all, however, Creton is responsible for the circumstantial eyewitness account of the capture of the king and of &#145;how he was falsely enticed out of his fair and strong castles in Wales&#146;  (Creton, &#145;Metrical history&#146;, 423) by the promise, given by the earl of Northumberland under oath, that nothing was intended against him, and that Bolingbroke asked only for the return of his inheritance and the punishment of traitors in parliament. This is entirely at odds with the official report of Richard's promise to renounce the crown, given while at liberty at Conwy. Creton was aware of the significance of what he had witnessed or had been told by the earl of Salisbury. While still in England he trembled for his life. But he solemnly declared that he wrote only the truth, which he feared would otherwise be suppressed. He was probably right to think so.<br>
