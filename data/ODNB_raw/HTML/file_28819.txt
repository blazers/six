<span class="headword">Waterworth,  William</span>  (1811&#150;1882), <span class="occ">Jesuit and historian</span>, was born at St Helens, Lancashire, on 22 June 1811. He was educated at the Jesuit college at Stonyhurst in Lancashire, where he was admitted to the Society of Jesus on 26 March 1829. In 1833 he was appointed master of the grammar school opened by the society in London. After starting his theological training at Stonyhurst seminary, he was ordained priest there in 1836; he completed his studies at the Collegio Romano in Rome, where he passed his <i>examen ad gradum</i> in theology. From December 1838 to 5 January 1841 he was professor of dogmatic theology at Stonyhurst. He professed the four vows on 2 July 1850.<br>
<br>Waterworth served as a priest in Hereford until 1854, where he wrote a number of historical and apologetic works. In 1852 his <span class="italic">The Jesuits, or, An examination of the origin, progress, principles and practices of the Society of Jesus</span> was published in London, and in 1854 he brought out <span class="italic">England and Rome, or, The history of the religious connexion between England and the Holy See, from &hellip; 179 to the &hellip; Anglican Reformation in 1534</span>, <span class="italic">Origin and Developments of Anglicanism</span>, and <span class="italic">On the Gradual Absorption of Early Anglicanism by Popedom</span>. In 1854 he became rector of the church of the Immaculate Conception in Farm Street, London. Three years later he was sent to the mission at Worcester, and appointed superior of the College of St George, where he remained until 1878. During this period he published <span class="italic">The Church of St Patrick &hellip; a History of the &hellip; Ancient Church of Ireland</span> (1869) and <span class="italic">Queen Elizabeth versus the lord chancellor &hellip; a history of the prayer book of the Church of England</span> (1871). He was appointed spiritual father of the College of St Ignatius in London in September 1879, and in November 1880 he was appointed to the mission at Bournemouth, where he died on 17 March 1882. He was buried at Stapehill, near Wimborne, Dorset.<br>
