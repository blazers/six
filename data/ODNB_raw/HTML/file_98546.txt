<span class="headword">Kenrick,  Bruce Henderson</span>  (1920&#150;2007), <span class="occ">Presbyterian minister and housing campaigner</span>, was born on 18 January 1920 at 14 Poulter Road, Walton, Liverpool, the son of John Ernest Drury Kenrick (1890&#150;1968), incorporated accountant's clerk, later accountant, and his wife, Sarah Mabel, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Barber (1891&#150;1962). He was brought up in Liverpool, educated at Merchant Taylors' School there and, until called up for military service in the Second World War, was training to be an accountant. During the war he served as a stretcher bearer in the Royal Army Medical Corps in the Gold Coast and later with both the Eighth Army and the Parachute brigade in Italy. Although he planned to be a doctor and went to Edinburgh University to study medicine after demobilization, he became involved in mission work with the Christian Union and subsequently switched to divinity. He graduated in 1954, the same year that he married Isabel Howland Witte (1926/7&#150;2010), an American historian whom he met in Edinburgh where she was on a Fulbright scholarship.<br>
<br>After ordination as a Presbyterian minister Kenrick continued his studies at the Princeton Theological Seminary in New Jersey and it was when he was there that he became involved in the East Harlem protestant parish in New York. This was a ministry of social action, working cheek by jowl with the urban poor, drug addicts, and the homeless, and it made a deep impression on him. For three years thereafter (1956&#150;9) he lived in Bengal, where he worked as a missionary and supported movements for land reform. However, typhoid forced him back to Britain and he and his wife, now with three daughters (the fourth child, a son, was born later), moved to the Scottish island community of Iona to recuperate. While he was there he wrote <span class="italic">Come Out the Wilderness</span> (1962) advocating a fully socially engaged and active church. &#145;The point of the Gospel&#146;, he wrote &#145;is not just to patch up society's wounds; it is also to grapple with the wills of the men who have inflicted those wounds, and who might well inflict them again.&#146; This was his most influential book, although he also wrote <span class="italic">The New Humanity</span> (1956) and <span class="italic">A Man from the Interior: Cuba's Quest</span> (1980).<br>
<br>In 1962 Kenrick and his family moved to London's Notting Hill, into a house in Blenheim Crescent purchased with his father's legacy. The area then was far from the desirable location of later in the century, with large numbers dependent on an often exploitative private rented sector. Kenrick quickly involved himself in finding ways to improve what he described as &#145;damnable housing conditions&#146;. Working in a team ministry, he was part of a campaign to persuade the Conservative-controlled council to take action, but struck out on his own in December 1963 when he called a meeting that led to the establishment of the Notting Hill Housing Trust, designed to do what the council would not do, namely to buy and renovate property for rent at affordable prices for those in need. Displaying the flair for publicity for which he would become renowned, he took the risk of spending large sums of money on hard-hitting advertising, including a photograph of a family of six in one room under the headline &#145;Heartbreak Notting Hill and you&#146;. The result was that the trust in its first year was able to buy five houses and house fifty-seven people. Within five years it had become a significant presence in west London, housing nearly 1000 people. By then, though, Kenrick had moved on.<br>
<br>Although he had done much to raise the problem of poor housing into a political issue&#151;Harold Wilson's Labour government that came to power in 1964 was committed to action&#151;Kenrick struggled with the limitations of an essentially local organization, believing that the campaign for better housing had to be national if it were to be fully effective in forcing local councils to take their housing responsibilities seriously. This the committee of the Notting Hill Trust was not prepared to do, so Kenrick took on the task himself. The result was Shelter, which became a reality in 1966, thanks to Kenrick's tireless energy, lobbying, and promotion. Described as Shelter's founder, Kenrick wrote, <blockquote>The most exhilarating fact about the launching of Shelter's National Campaign for the Homeless is that it brings fresh hope of good, low-rent homes to many of Britain's three million families who now live in slums, in near slums, or in grossly overcrowded conditions. (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 2 Dec 1966)</blockquote>Shelter was given an enormous boost by the coincidence of its launch with the screening ten days earlier by the BBC of the film <span class="italic">Cathy Come Home</span>, which provoked a public outcry over homelessness. However, while Shelter established itself quickly as a major player on housing issues, Kenrick soon fell out with his colleagues and left the organization after it appointed Des Wilson, a talented organizer, as its director. This is perhaps not surprising for a man decribed by his daughter as a &#145;crusader&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Guardian</span>, 2 March 2010), by a former colleague at Notting Hill Housing Trust as a &#145;marvellous one man band&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 24 Jan 2007), by a former chief executive of Shelter as &#145;a founding member of the awkward squad&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 20 Jan 2007), and by a Glasgow <span class="italic">Herald</span> obituarist as a &#145;thrawn maverick&#146; who &#145;could have raised a fight in a quiet cathedral, and indeed often did&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Herald</span>, 27 Jan 2007). His successor in the chair at Shelter acknowledged, though, that &#145;it was Bruce Kenrick who started Shelter and without him it would never have existed&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Guardian</span>, 19 Jan 2007). Later he was described by the chief executive of the Association of Chief Executives of Voluntary Organizations as one of the &#145;sector heroes&#146; of social enterprise  (&#145;Bubb's blog&#146;, 10 February 2010, http://bloggerbubb.blogspot.com).<br>
<br>Kenrick remained in Notting Hill until 1980, and after further assignments in parishes in Bayswater and Hackney, moved again to Iona. Divorced from his wife in 1983 (though they remained close) and increasingly plagued by illness, he remained in Iona for the last twenty years of his life, sustained by his membership of the Iona Community. Although he lived quietly, he was writing another book at the time of his death, at the Lorn and Islands District General Hospital, Oban, of a gastro-intestinal haemorrhage, on 15 January 2007. He was survived by his four children.<br>
