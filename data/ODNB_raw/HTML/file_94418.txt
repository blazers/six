<span class="headword">Wormald,  (Charles) Patrick</span>  (1947&#150;2004), <span class="occ">historian</span>, was born on 9 July 1947 at Townfield, Mill Street, Neston, Cheshire, one of four sons of Brian Harvey Goodwin Wormald (1912&#150;2005), historian, and his wife, Rosemary (<i>d</i>. 2003), daughter of Edward John Boydell Lloyd and sister of Anthony John Leslie Lloyd, Baron Lloyd of Berwick (<i>b</i>. 1929), judge. His father, a fellow of Peterhouse, Cambridge, for 66 years, was an eccentrically conservative figure, whose &#145;wardrobe ran to silver-buckled shoes and a monocle, and whose loathing of pedantry, teetotalism and the creeping spread of lower-middle-class values could be expressed in the most forthright of Anglo-Saxon terms&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Independent</span>, 8 April 2005). Ordained an Anglican priest in 1943, in 1955 he converted to Catholicism (a faith to which both he and his son remained unswervingly attached thereafter). He published a well-regarded book on Clarendon in 1951 and a less well-regarded one on Francis Bacon in 1993, and little in between. Wormald's mother, Rosemary Lloyd, had obtained a double first in classics at Cambridge. She and Wormald's father separated after the children had grown up, but remained on amicable terms.<br>
<br>Wormald was educated as a king's scholar at Eton College, and at Balliol College, Oxford, where Maurice Keen was a tutor. He graduated with a first-class degree in modern history in 1969, and won a prize fellowship at All Souls College, Oxford, in the same year. He there began research for a DPhil (never completed) on Anglo-Saxon law, under the supervision of Michael Wallace-Hadrill. (Wormald later co-edited Wallace-Hadrill's Festschrift, <span class="italic">Ideal and Reality in Frankish and Anglo-Saxon Society</span>, 1983.) In 1974 he became a lecturer in medieval history at Glasgow University, where he taught wide-ranging courses on early medieval Scottish, British, and European history. While there he met and married Jennifer (Jenny) Brown, a fellow historian; they had two sons. In 1989 Wormald moved back to Oxford, as a lecturer, and from 1990 student (that is fellow) and tutor, at Christ Church.<br>
<br>Wormald did not originate but he powerfully contributed to the revival of interest in Anglo-Saxon England and appreciation of its cultural and political sophistication that gathered momentum from the 1970s. Wormald's particular contributions were largely scattered in journal articles and lectures (sometimes published), but also in conference and seminar contributions, influencing the work of others. He published in particular on Bede, <span class="roman">Beowulf</span>, the administrative machinery of the Anglo-Saxon state, and the development of Anglo-Saxon law. His chapters on Bede, Offa, and Alfred in James Campbell's <span class="italic">The Anglo-Saxons</span> (1982) were particularly well-regarded, and accessible to non-specialists. (He also wrote seven articles for the <span class="italic">Oxford DNB</span>, including the entries on Alfred and Archbishop Wulfstan.) In 1999 a selection of his essays was published as <span class="italic">Legal Culture in the Early Medieval West: Law as Text, Image and Experience</span>. The same year saw the publication of the first volume of his <i>magnum opus</i>, some twenty years in the making, <span class="italic">The Making of English Law: King Alfred to the Twelfth Century</span>. By means of meticulous reassessment of all surviving Anglo-Saxon law codes, together with detailed comparisons with contemporary continental law codes as well as Anglo-Norman law and legal writing, he argued powerfully for the precocity of Anglo-Saxon law, and for a continuous history from Anglo-Saxon law to medieval and Tudor common law. At the same time he insisted on the wide cultural significance of the Anglo-Saxon law codes: they were not only legal texts but also a literature. The book was acclaimed by Wormald's fellow historians, Henry Mayr-Harting describing it as a &#145;masterpiece&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Guardian</span>, 13 Oct 2004), and James Campbell suggesting that it was &#145;one of the most important books written by an English historian in recent years &hellip; a monument of detailed learning which almost recreates its subject&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Independent</span>, 7 Oct 2004). Wormald was working on the second volume when he died. A further selection of his articles was published posthumously as <span class="italic">The Times of Bede</span> (2006), edited by Stephen Baxter.<br>
<br>A man whose intellectual brilliance had led to many glittering prizes early in life, and who retained his boyish good looks until late in life, Wormald always had something of the Wunderkind about him. He could be generous and loyal to friends, colleagues, and students, and he was both a compelling lecturer and a remarkable and much loved tutor. But he could also be difficult, irresponsible, self-centred, and attention-seeking. He constantly craved appreciation, and found criticism difficult to take. It was said that he &#145;was unwilling to admit that he had ever been wrong; though pleased to explain how the critic had come to misunderstand him&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Independent</span>, 7 Oct 2004). He was increasingly prone to alcoholism and related mood-swings, which saddened his friends but frequently infuriated his colleagues. He was forced to give up his studentship at Christ Church in 2001, and was divorced from his wife Jenny the same year.<br>
<br>Wormald died on 29 September 2004 at his home, 44 Surman House, Mandelbrote Drive, Littlemore, Oxford, of alcoholic liver disease. He was survived by his two sons. His published work amounted to less than either he or others had hoped. Nevertheless his impact on the understanding of Anglo-Saxon England was considerable.<br>
