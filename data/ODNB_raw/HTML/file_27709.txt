<span class="headword">Tresham,  Henry</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1750/51, <em>d.</em> 1814), <span class="occ">history painter and art dealer</span>, was born in Ireland, but his parentage, and precisely where and when he was born, are so far unknown. On his election to the Royal Academy in 1799 Tresham appears to have given his date of baptism as &#145;21 February 1750 or 1751, in Dublin&#146;, while Farington, who recorded Tresham's age in 1794 as forty-six  (Farington, <span class="italic">Diary</span>, 1.135), stated after Tresham's death in 1814 that he was born on 24 February 1750  (ibid., 13.4548). Tresham studied in the Dublin Society's drawing school from 1765 and exhibited with the society between 1768 and 1775. Years later he told Farington that he was &#145;in great repute in Dublin &hellip; for drawing heads&#146;, but &#145;lamented not having practised the mechanical part of painting before He went to Italy&#146;  (ibid., 3.1016).<br>
<br>In 1775 Tresham left for Italy, resolved to concentrate on history painting, and by September 1775 had rooms in the middle of the artist colony in Rome. He remained in Rome for thirteen years, increasingly more active as a dealer than as a painter. Occasionally he joined Thomas Jones and Henry Pars in 1777 on sketching excursions in and around Rome, but even on these his instinct to deal was uppermost, as when he bought the antique frescoes in the newly excavated Villa Negroni (&#145;to be taken off the walls at his Own Expence&#146;), selling them within weeks at a large profit to that avid collector Frederick Augustus Hervey, bishop of Derry  (Opp&eacute;, <span class="italic">Memoirs of Thomas Jones</span>, 62). Ever the opportunist, Tresham gave &#145;a grand Entertainment to a large Company&#146; in Rome in January 1780, to celebrate the news of the bishop of Derry's succession to the title of fourth earl of Bristol  (ibid., 93).<br>
<br>Tresham's most rewarding patron from 1783 was Colonel John Campbell (later first Baron Cawdor), with whom he travelled in Sicily, 1783&#150;4, and for whom he made landscape drawings, bought pictures and antiquities, and, in particular, acted as Campbell's agent with Canova. Campbell marked the association by commissioning from Hugh Douglas Hamilton <i>c</i>.1788&#150;9 a remarkable pastel, <span class="italic">Antonio Canova in his Studio with Henry Tresham and a Plaster Model for &#145;Cupid and Psyche&#146;</span> (exh. RA, 1791; V&amp;A). Tresham also acted in Italy as agent for many other collectors, including Frederick Howard, fifth earl of Carlisle, who settled an annuity of &pound;300 on him for life. He was still profiting from sales from his own collection of Etruscan vases in 1809.<br>
<br>Tresham completed several historical paintings in Rome (some sold to the earl bishop, none now known) and some portraits, as well as various weakly Fuseliesque allegorical drawings, such as <span class="italic">A Knight, a Woman and other Figures Cowering from a Serpent in a Cave</span> (V&amp;A), of which Iolo Williams remarked that &#145;it is easier to say that it represents something very terrible than to identify the subject exactly&#146;  (Williams, 128). More documentarily interesting is a watercolour of an archaeological site (priv. coll.; reproduced in Crookshank and knight of Glin), perhaps depicting Tresham himself as the gentleman-predator who watches anxiously as antique works are hauled into the world of modern dealing. In 1784 he published a volume of eighteen weak but extravagantly mannered aquatints entitled <span class="italic">Le avventure di Saffo</span>, inspired by Conte Alessandro Verri's <span class="italic">Le avventure di Saffo poetessa di Mitilene</span>, 1780. On returning to England in 1789 he sent twelve works to that year's Royal Academy exhibition (mostly historical paintings, but also including <span class="italic">A View of Mount Etna from Catania</span>). From addresses at 9 George Street, Hanover Square, and later 20 Brook Street, London, he continued until 1806 to exhibit paintings mostly drawn from classical or British history, frigid in style and wan in colour. Few of these won praise, but in the 1790s he was commissioned by Robert Bowyer for twenty-four paintings (an example is <span class="italic">The Earl of Warwick Justifies the Title to his Estate</span>; Manchester City Galleries) to be engraved for David Hume's <span class="italic">History of England</span>, and by John Boydell for two or three subjects for the <span class="italic">Shakspeare Gallery</span>. Between 1796 and 1810 Tresham published five volumes of indifferent verse. In London he continued to operate as dealer and agent, notably for William Beckford, for whom he made important purchases, including, in 1799, the two Altieri Claudes.<br>
<br>Tresham was elected an associate of the Royal Academy in 1791 and a member in 1799, and was appointed professor of painting in the Royal Academy Schools in 1807, resigning in 1809 because of failing health. He appears to have been something of a cold fish, neither liked nor wholly trusted by his fellow academicians. Farington recorded that &#145;Shee [Martin Archer-Shee] said He was a weak man, vain, of no judgment, and acted at the instigation of anybody he happens to associate with&#146;  (Farington, <span class="italic">Diary</span>, 5 Jan 1800). Tresham is not known to have married. After some years of unspecified illness, he died on 17 June 1814 in Bond Street, London. He was buried on 29 June.<br>
