<span class="headword">Wilton,  Eve  of</span>  (<em>c.</em>1058&#150;<em>c.</em>1125), <span class="occ">Benedictine nun and anchoress</span>, was the daughter of a Danish father and a Lotharingian mother. They gave her to Wilton Abbey, Wiltshire, when she was a child of about seven, in 1065. She remained there until <i>c</i>.1080, when she left to become a hermit in France. A treatise in the form of a letter, <span class="italic">Liber confortatorius</span> (&#145;Book of comfort&#146;), written to her a few years after her departure by Goscelin of St Bertin, a friend and former mentor, provides relatively detailed information both about Eve and about Goscelin's feelings for her.<br>
<br>It was from Wilton's cloister that Eve was able to witness the end of England as an Anglo-Saxon kingdom. Wilton was a foundation closely associated with the royal house of Wessex, heavily patronized in Eve's time by Queen Edith (<i>d</i>. 1075) herself. Just after her reception Eve, together with Goscelin, was present at the dedication of a new church built at the instigation of the queen in honour of the earlier royal&#151;and sainted&#151;Edith (<i>d</i>. 984&times;7). The next year brought the Norman conquest. Thereafter Goscelin seems to have visited Wilton less often, but it seems as if he and Eve kept in touch through the occasional meeting and through letter-writing. Then, <i>c</i>.1080, without any warning&#151;or so Goscelin complained&#151;Eve left Wilton to become a recluse at St Laurent de Tertre in Angers.<br>
<br>In Angers, Eve lived in a tiny 8 foot cell. Goscelin's letter is at the same time a lament for the loss he feels he has suffered by her decision to leave England, and an occasion for devising an intensive reading programme for her so that the devil will not get the better of her in her new surroundings. In her cell Eve has only a small window through which to communicate with the outside world; through this are to be passed tomes such as Augustine's <span class="italic">Confessions</span> and the <span class="italic">City of God</span>, Boethius' <span class="italic">Consolation of Philosophy</span>, the histories of Eusebius and Orosius. The list stands as a corrective to the frequently held assumption that after the golden age of double monasteries in the eighth century educational attainments among female religious became negligible.<br>
<br>Eve died <i>c</i>.1125. A poem celebrating her life by the poet Hilary relies heavily for its description of Eve's virtues on hagiographical topoi but it also adds a new chapter to her life of which Goscelin, perhaps, never knew. At some point Eve left Angers, and moved to St Eutrope near the priory of Levi&egrave;re to live with a former monk of Vend&ocirc;me, Hervey. The new monastic movements of the twelfth century did much to encourage such spiritual partnerships, though they still caused the raising of many an eyebrow. However, in Hilary's words, Eve and Hervey were considered to share &#145;a worthy and pleasing companionship&#146;  (<span class="italic">Hilarii versus et ludi</span>, 51). A letter of 1102 from Geoffrey, abbot of Vend&ocirc;me, to Eve and Hervey also gives their relationship his blessing: &#145;who is perfect in love, let them not fear&#146;  (<span class="roman">1 John</span> 4: 18).<br>
