<span class="headword">Binham,  Simon</span>  (<em>fl. </em><em>c.</em>1350), <span class="occ">Benedictine monk and chronicler</span>, was probably born in East Anglia and became a member of the priory of Binham, Norfolk, one of the cells of the abbey of St Albans. He is first recorded as supporting his prior in resisting the unjust exactions of Hugh, abbot of St Albans (1309&#150;27). After Hugh appealed to Edward II for assistance, Binham and the other rebellious monks were brought to St Albans and imprisoned, but he was later released and lived to become an influential member of the house, for in the time of Abbot Michael (1335&#150;49) he was chosen by the chapter as one of the three receivers or treasurers of the collections made for the support of scholars and needy brethren.<br>
<br>Binham's real claim to fame, however, rests on his apparent role as one in a long line of St Albans chroniclers. As V. H. Galbraith has demonstrated, St Albans was an active centre of historical writing in the later middle ages. The <span class="italic">Flores historiarum</span> of Roger of Wendover (<i>d</i>. 1236) and Matthew Paris's <span class="italic">Chronica majora</span>, both compiled in the thirteenth century, began the tradition of historical writing at St Albans. This tradition was not a continuous one; after the death of Paris in 1259 the scriptorium fell silent for almost a generation. Under the abbacy of John Maryns (1302&#150;8), however, the writing of history was revised. According to Thomas Walsingham, writing about 1400, after Paris &#145;William Risangre, Henry Blankfrount, Simon Bynham and Richard Savage successively wrote chronicles&#146;  (<span class="italic">Annales &hellip; Amundesham</span>, 2.303). Beginning in the early fourteenth century, then, several smaller texts were compiled in an effort to pick up the <span class="italic">Chronica majora</span> where Paris had left off in 1259. William of Rishanger was apparently the author of the <span class="italic">Opus chronicorum</span>, covering the years 1259&#150;97 (with a preface explaining events down to 1307). A continuation of Rishanger's chronicle, the <span class="italic">Annals</span> of John Trokelowe, covers events in the period 1307&#150;23, and Henry Blaneford wrote a brief continuation for the years 1323&#150;4. Whether or not even these brief texts were really the work of Rishanger, he has also been credited with a history&#151;the so-called <span class="italic">Chronica Willelmi Rishanger</span>&#151;dealing with events in the period 1259&#150;1307. Galbraith, however, has called this attribution into question, pointing out among other things that its earliest manuscript (BL, Royal MS 14 C.vii) was written soon after 1350, by which date Rishanger was surely dead (he would have been eighty years of age in 1330). This chronicle is not without importance, as it may have been used by Walsingham in the compilation of his <span class="italic">Chronica majora</span>. For Galbraith, therefore, this text represents &#145;a unique survival of historical writing at St Albans in the period between Rishanger and Walsingham&#146;  (<span class="italic">St Albans Chronicle</span>, xxxv). Owing to the apparent date of its composition, this chronicle was probably written by either Simon Binham or Richard Savage, whose works have otherwise become lost.<br>
