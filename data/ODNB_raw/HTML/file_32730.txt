<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Davidson,  John Colin Campbell</span>, first Viscount Davidson  (1889&#150;1970), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born in Aberdeen on 23 February 1889. He was the second child and only son of Sir James Mackenzie Davidson (1856&#150;1919), ophthalmic surgeon and pioneer of radiology, and his wife, Georgina Barbara Watt (<i>d</i>. 1927), daughter of the Revd William Henderson of Aberdeen. The family originated as farmers near Scone in Perthshire, but Davidson's grandfather John Davidson (1808&#150;1893) emigrated to Argentina in 1825 and prospered there; the income from the family's estates enabled Davidson to follow his interests and refuse payment for the various positions which he held. The family were staunchly Church of Scotland, and Davidson's early years imbued him with a strong faith and the ethic of &#145;your work always comes first&#146;  (Davidson, 5). He was educated at Fretherne House preparatory school, Westminster School (1903&#150;7), and Pembroke College, Cambridge, graduating with a third in part one of the law tripos in 1911. He was called to the bar at the Middle Temple in 1913 but never practised, for by this time he had already begun a different career.<br>
<br>On 10 April 1919 Davidson married (Frances) Joan Dickinson (1894&#150;1985) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/31006/', "Davidson, (Frances) Joan")</script>]. Always known as Mimi, she was an attractive and popular personality who shared her husband's outlook and supported his work. She succeeded him as MP for Hemel Hempstead from 1937 to 1959, and became a life peer as Baroness Northchurch in 1963. It was a close and happy marriage and resulted in two sons and two daughters.<h2>
<a name="RelationswithBonarLawandBaldwin"></a>Relations with Bonar Law and Baldwin</h2>In May 1910 Davidson became an unpaid assistant private secretary to the colonial secretary, Lord Crewe. He continued to serve his successor, Lewis Harcourt, from November 1910 to May 1915, when the formation of the first coalition brought Davidson into the orbit of the new colonial secretary and Conservative Party leader, Andrew Bonar Law. The latter was swiftly impressed by Davidson's industry, and he became more than a trusted aide. A close friendship developed based upon a paternal relationship. Law dissuaded Davidson from leaving Whitehall for military service, and when he became chancellor of the exchequer in the Lloyd George coalition in December 1916 insisted that Davidson move with him to the Treasury. Davidson continued as Law's private secretary until the latter's patronage smoothed his entry into the House of Commons as MP for Hemel Hempstead in November 1920. This was not a change of course, for immediately Davidson became Law's parliamentary private secretary (PPS), discharging the same tasks but with better political access and contacts.<br>
<br>When Law retired on health grounds in March 1921 Davidson became parliamentary private secretary to Stanley Baldwin, which was almost a case of staying in the family. Baldwin was also close to Law and knew Davidson well from having served&#151;initially at Davidson's suggestion&#151;as junior minister at the Treasury in 1916&#150;19. During 1921&#150;2 Davidson shared with Baldwin and a range of junior ministers an increasingly negative view of the Lloyd George coalition. The revolt against this was a movement at many levels within the Conservative Party involving constituency pressure, back-bench MPs, junior ministers, and restive peers. The range of dissent gave it weight, but its greatest weakness was the lack of a credible leader. Davidson played an important role by helping to persuade Law to come out of retirement and attend the Carlton Club meeting on 19 October 1922 at which Lloyd George and the existing Conservative leaders were overthrown.<br>
<br>Law resumed the Conservative leadership and became prime minister, and with Baldwin's approval Davidson at once returned to his side as Law's PPS. It was in this position that a few months later Davidson played a significant&#151;and controversial&#151;historical role. When Law's terminal illness forced him to retire in May 1923 he declined to recommend whether Curzon or Baldwin should be his successor. At the request of the king's private secretary, Lord Stamfordham, Davidson wrote a memorandum which came down firmly in favour of Baldwin. This document accompanied Law's resignation letter and was handed over by its bearer, Law's private secretary Ronald Waterhouse. Although the latter suggested that it represented Law's own undisclosed view, Stamfordham and the king were aware of its authorship. It played a smaller part in the choice of Baldwin as prime minister than was once supposed, but nevertheless had some influence&#151;if only because it provided arguments for the choice which the crown was disposed to take.<br>
<br>Davidson's relationship with Law had brought him into the inner counsels of the Conservative Party by 1923, and his friendship with Baldwin was to keep him there for the next fourteen years in a variety of roles. This was also a filial relationship across generations&#151;indeed, Davidson met his wife through Baldwin, as she was a friend of one of his daughters. Baldwin spent much time in the Davidsons' company; Mimi was a frequent companion in his favourite relaxation of long country walks, and they regularly holidayed with the Baldwins as well. Davidson shared his leader's political aims and moral vision, while being willing to devil on the detail and take care of confidential matters. In Baldwin's first ministry he became chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster; this was outside the cabinet, but an ideal position from which to advise and assist. He combined this office with the position of chief civil commissioner, responsible for preparing plans to cope with a paralysing industrial stoppage; later, in the general strike of 1926, he served as deputy chief civil commissioner with responsibility for government publicity, overseeing the activities of Winston Churchill and the <span class="italic">British Gazette</span>.<h2>
<a name="ConservativePartychairman"></a>Conservative Party chairman</h2>In the general election of 1923 Davidson was defeated at Hemel Hempstead but he recovered the seat in 1924. In Baldwin's second government he was given junior office as parliamentary secretary at the Admiralty. Davidson played a part in the dispute over the naval budget in 1925 between Bridgeman, the first lord of the Admiralty, and Churchill, the chancellor of the exchequer. In this, as on other occasions, his constant vigilance for signs of disloyalty and intrigue led to a distorted picture which added to existing tensions. From 1922 onwards Davidson was almost paranoid in suspecting that the former coalitionists were seeking to reverse their defeat, and he saw hidden plots behind almost anything which they did or said, a reflection of his own tendency to intrigue. His loyalty and dedication were absolute, and in November 1926 Baldwin moved Davidson to the position where this was of paramount importance, as chairman of the Conservative Party organization. From then until his departure in June 1930 Davidson's aim was to serve his leader: he had no thought of promoting his own career, regarding the office as a thankless task and &#145;a blind alley&#146;  (Davidson to Hoare, 30 Dec 1929, CUL, Templewood MS VI/1).<br>
<br>Davidson's period as party chairman was the most important and visible phase of his career. Although there were difficulties, his tenure is considered to have been one of the most significant in the development of the Conservative electoral machine in the twentieth century&#151;a period in which it had been an important factor in the party's success. Davidson was not the founder, for the basis had been laid by his predecessors after the creation of the party chairmanship in 1911&#150;14 and in the early 1920s. His achievements were therefore not quite as sweeping as he later tended to suggest, but he reshaped and energized the central organization after a period of electoral turmoil and haphazard evolution. He made a significant contribution in three main areas: rationalizing the basic structure, developing new areas, and expanding the scale of operations.<br>
<br>The reorganization of the central office which Davidson introduced in 1928 laid down the basic structure which continued, with cosmetic changes, for the next six decades. The active departments of central office were drawn together into two main groups. The first embraced all the traditional organizational services, and was headed by the principal agent; the second dealt with publications and propaganda, and the new post of director of publicity was created to oversee it. This reform was intended to establish clear lines of authority and ensure better co-ordination between related sections, and also to emphasize the importance of publicity&#151;for new methods were the key to reach the vastly enlarged electorate. Davidson was adept at securing able individuals, and appointed the three men who held the key posts until 1945: Robert Topping, Joseph Ball, and Patrick Gower.<br>
<br>The priority which Davidson gave to new areas of organization resulted from the democratic electorate created in 1918 and the equalization of the franchise for both sexes at the age of twenty-one in 1928. He was strongly committed to further strengthening the women's side of the party organization, recognizing their importance both as voters and active fund-raisers in the constituency associations. This had been developing since the early 1920s, and Davidson continued to enhance it, giving more resources and seeking to raise its prestige and professionalism. To underline this, in 1928 he appointed the head of the women's department, Marjorie Maxse, to be deputy to the principal agent. He also continued the attempts to promote the trade unionists' wing, the labour advisory committees; this was much more difficult ground, but significant in view of the industrial strife of the 1920s and the rise of the Labour Party. His more original initiatives lay in three other areas: youth, publicity, and political education. The employment of organizers at central office and in the regions led to a considerable expansion of the junior imperial league. The publicity budget was more than doubled, links with the provincial press improved, new party journals founded, and a torrent of leaflets produced. He was open to new methods, using a professional advertising firm and introducing the effective travelling cinema vans. He encouraged political education at local and regional level, and raised &pound;200,000 to provide a national centre which party members could attend; this opened in 1930 at Ashridge in Hertfordshire as the Bonar Law Memorial College. His final contribution came in his last months as chairman, and is often identified with others. However, after much discussion over the previous years, it was Davidson who established the Conservative Research Department in October 1929&#151;he secured Baldwin's approval, raised the funds, found the premises, and appointed Ball as its director&#151;though Neville Chamberlain was more important in making the department a success.<br>
<br>Davidson presided over a huge expansion of staff and spending. By 1928 central office employed 296 persons in London and the regional offices, a level attained again only at the peak of the Woolton machine in 1949&#150;51. Although Davidson did not hold the formal post of party treasurer in fact he did much of the fund-raising. This was an area at which even his critics admitted he was effective, and he raised &pound;1 million before the general election of 1929. In his memoirs Davidson identified himself with having stamped out political corruption through the sale of honours, a scandal which had tarnished the Lloyd George coalition. In practice what this meant was not an end to rewards for faithful contributors, but a return to the former discreet and indirect methods.<br>
<br>Not everything in Davidson's tenure was positive, and the problems mounted after the defeat in 1929. He faced his share of criticism over its timing and over the uninspiring campaign themes of &#145;Safety first&#146; and &#145;Trust Baldwin&#146;. In its wake concern grew that Davidson was too close to the leader to act as an effective channel of communication. This was all the more important as the party chairman was also chairman of the executive committee of the national union&#151;a link which was severed on Davidson's departure. He could be prickly and tended to engage in clumsy manoeuvres against Baldwin's critics on the right. By 1930 he had alienated a range of figures, including his own deputy chairman, the otherwise inoffensive Lord Stanley. These problems came to a head as Baldwin came under pressure from Lord Beaverbrook's &#145;empire crusade&#146; campaign in 1930. A truce was negotiated in March, but collapsed during May partly owing to Davidson's misjudgements over tactics and publicity. He had by now become a liability who was weakening Baldwin's position, but the latter was reluctant to drop him. The nettle was grasped by Neville Chamberlain, who told Davidson bluntly in April that he had to go; after further delay, Chamberlain pressed again and Davidson resigned on 29 May.<h2>
<a name="IndiaArgentinaandmemoirs"></a>India, Argentina, and memoirs</h2>Although Davidson felt he had been sacrificed he soon resumed his position as a key figure in Baldwin's inner circle. He remained a trusted adviser and friend during the rest of Baldwin's leadership, but most of his work was behind the scenes and is difficult to assess. In March 1931 he helped at a vital moment to persuade Baldwin not to resign the party leadership. In the National Government Davidson served outside the cabinet as chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster from November 1931 until May 1937. He was knighted in 1935. Much of his attention in the early 1930s focused upon the India question, as this was the most divisive issue within the Conservative Party. He worked to secure support for the bipartisan policy which Baldwin had endorsed since 1929, and to defeat the diehard critics led by Winston Churchill. He took a public part as chairman of the Indian States inquiry committee, visiting India in early 1932. This examined the relationship between the princely states and the proposed federal structure, and he was able to secure a cautious agreement which assisted progress without alarming Conservative opinion at home. In general, his role was not to influence Baldwin's decisions, but to encourage and support him in the path which he had chosen. This was illustrated in the abdication crisis in 1936, when he was a key voice close to Baldwin urging the need for decisive action. When Baldwin retired in May 1937 Davidson also left active politics. The closeness of the relationship was underlined when Davidson was given a viscountcy, the peerage normally given to those of cabinet rank; he took the title of Viscount Davidson of Little Gaddesden, Hertfordshire.<br>
<br>Business concerns, and especially the family's Argentine estates, occupied much of Davidson's time from 1937 until the Peronist government broke the connection in the 1950s. In the Second World War he was an adviser and then controller of production at the Ministry of Information from October 1939 to July 1941. After this he was an honorary adviser on commercial relations with South America, making an official tour there in 1942. On his return in 1943 he founded the Hispanic and Luso-Brazilian councils, which led to the establishment of Canning House in London as a centre to promote closer links with South America. Davidson continued to work for this, and made frequent visits to the continent in the late 1940s and 1950s. His contribution was recognized by honours awarded by several countries and the presidency of the Anglo-Argentine Society. In 1960 he began compiling material for a volume of memoirs, including a number of tape-recorded conversations. However, a cerebral atheroma in 1962 and further serious illness at the end of 1963 meant that he could not complete this. His memory was not affected, and a volume which blended the incomplete memoirs with documents from his extensive archive was edited by Robert Rhodes James. It appeared in 1969, shortly before Davidson's death on 11 December 1970 at his London home, Said House, Chiswick Mall, Chiswick.<br>
<br>The publication of the memoirs drew attention to Davidson's role behind the scenes, in particular as aide and confidant to Bonar Law and Baldwin. Throughout his career Davidson did not seek any independent position, and he was most comfortable with a place in the background as the loyal lieutenant. His role as the perennial insider raised concerns that he was an <i>&eacute;minence grise</i>; doubt and resentment about the extent of his influence meant that he collected enemies, and his fortunes depended upon his patron. Discreet and industrious, he devoted his efforts to persons and causes that he regarded as greater than himself. His most prominent position, as chairman of the Conservative Party from 1926 to 1930, was simply an extension of this role as the leader's right hand, while his fall from this office illustrated his defects as a politician. In character and appearance Davidson seemed more of an administrator than a politician: he possessed a certain stuffiness and tendency to focus upon detail, and was not an imposing figure either in the House of Commons or in public. He was of medium height, and in his middle years gained weight while his hair thinned; he was normally seen in public as a bland and owlish figure whose most distinctive feature was his round black spectacles.<br>
