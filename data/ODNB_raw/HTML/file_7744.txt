<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Dodd,  William</span> <span class="st"> [<em>nicknamed </em> the Macaroni Parson]</span>  (1729&#150;1777), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and forger</span>, was born in Bourne, Lincolnshire, the eldest of the six children of the Revd William Dodd (1703?&#150;1757), vicar of Bourne. He was probably born on 29 May 1729  (Howson), though the parish register for Bourne shows that a William Dodd, son of William Dodd, was baptized at Bourne on 23 May 1728  (<span class="italic">IGI</span>). His mother was possibly Elizabeth Dickson or Dixon, who married a William Dodd on 3 April 1726, perhaps at Bourne (or at Norton Disney or Surfleet in the same county).<br>
<br>Dodd entered Clare College, Cambridge, in 1746 as a sizar, and in 1749 he was entered in the first tripos list as a wrangler. He was made MA in 1759. On leaving Cambridge in 1749 he went to London, where he lived for the rest of his life. There he sought to pursue a literary career which had begun at Cambridge with <span class="italic">Diggon Davy's Resolution on the Death of his Last Cow</span> (1747), a poem on foot-and-mouth disease. In London he rapidly produced a co-authored student crammer of philosophical texts and wrote both a farce on Sir Roger de Coverley, which was apparently never staged, and <span class="italic">A New Book of the Dunciad</span>. In 1751 he married Mary Perkins (<i>d</i>. 1784), the daughter of a verger of Durham Cathedral, and his initial literary success encouraged him to lease an expensive house in Wardour Street. The fatal pattern was thus established of over-extending his limited financial resources in pursuit of advancement. It quickly became clear that his writings would not support him so he returned to Cambridge, he was ordained at Gonville and Caius College on 19 October 1752, and he became curate at All Saints', West Ham. He continued to write and, while his talent for originality was limited, he did have a facility for extracting from the work of others, most successfully in <span class="italic">The Beauties of Shakespeare</span> (1752), a collection of quotations which stayed in print well into the twentieth century. This book proved a boon to those who wished to demonstrate erudition without the inconvenience of actually having to read the plays, although it did provide Goethe with his first exposure to Shakespeare. Dodd also tried his hand at fiction and published <span class="italic">The Sisters</span> (1754), a novel whose dullness at least conceals its limp eroticism. During the 1760s he concentrated on theological writing; he published a <span class="italic">Commentary of the Bible</span> in monthly parts from 1764 and became almost solely responsible for the <span class="italic">Christian Magazine</span> (1760&#150;67), some articles from which were collected in <span class="italic">Dodd on Death</span>.<br>
<br>Meanwhile Dodd's reputation as a preacher was growing. He was appointed to a lectureship at All Saints' in 1752; this was followed by lectureships in the City of London at St James Garlickhythe, in May 1753, and St Olave, Hart Street, in April 1754. He also delivered the Lady Moyer lectures at St Paul's Cathedral from 1754. In 1764 he attacked John Wesley for allegedly claiming that Methodists were perfect and for failing to control his followers. Wesley at first ignored the attack but then silenced his opponent with a fierce response in <span class="italic">Lloyd's Evening Post</span> (3 April 1767). In 1765 Dodd became tutor to the heir of Philip Dormer Stanhope, earl of Chesterfield, so he reluctantly turned schoolmaster and opened a small private school; he also graduated LLD in 1766 in the hope of attracting other wealthy pupils. His precarious finances received a boost when his wife received an inheritance and a lottery prize. With the money he opened Charlotte (or Pimlico) Chapel in Charlotte Street, behind Buckingham House, in July 1767. The aim was to attract royalty and thereby the cream of London society through his reputation as a preacher. Initially aristocracy joined his congregation and newspapers printed his sermons but the chapel struggled to attract members of the royal family. Dodd failed to obtain the vacant livings of either All Saints', in 1762, or St Olave, in 1769, although in 1772 he was preferred to the rectory of Hockliffe, Bedfordshire, to which was joined the vicarage of Chalgrove. His debts continued to mount as his lifestyle outstripped his income and he was forced to assign some of his literary works to the publisher of the <span class="italic">Christian Magazine</span>, to whom he owed money. Then, in 1767, he was sacked as its editor, and in 1771 his school, which had never been a financial success, collapsed when Philip Stanhope departed on the grand tour. Another attempt to rescue his finances, by leasing Bedford Chapel, Bloomsbury, in 1770, failed and he gave up the venture the following year.<br>
<br>In spite of all these difficulties Dodd supported a number of charities. While such endeavours were undoubtedly a means of mixing with influential people the fact that he was often the initiator of several successful schemes suggests a generous nature. He was instrumental in the establishment of the Society for the Relief and Discharge of Persons Imprisoned for Small Debts (later the Discharged Prisoners' Society) and of the Society for the Resuscitation of Persons Apparently Drowned (later the Royal Humane Society), and he was connected to the Magdalen Hospital for the reformation of penitent prostitutes. In 1767 he preached in favour of inoculation against smallpox and he wrote in support of the campaign against the death penalty in 1772. However, when in that year he and his wife were passengers in a coach that was robbed they were the only ones who appeared as witnesses against William Griffiths, who subsequently was convicted and hanged. It is worth remarking, however, that Dodd was equivocal in his evidence and interceded on Griffiths's behalf after his conviction.<br>
<br>There can be no doubting that Dodd worked hard, both as a writer and as a clergyman. Horace Walpole described his preaching style as &#145;haranguing entirely in the French style, and very eloquently and touchingly&#146;, by which he seems to have meant that he spoke rapidly, with emotion and in a high-pitched tone  (letter to George Montagu, 28 Jan 1760, Walpole, <span class="italic">Corr.</span>, 9.274). Walpole noted that some of the congregation were moved to tears, and this effect was presumably the result of Dodd's method of delivery since his printed sermons were similar in content to those preached by less popular colleagues. Dodd was certainly careful to cultivate the aristocrats among his congregation, even to the extent of sending them &#145;odes&#146;, the sycophantic tone of which says as much about their expectations as about his character. He enjoyed a degree of success both as a writer and a preacher but, while his income was not small, it was never adequate to maintain the impression of a successful clergyman, which he needed to promote in order to advance his career and to satisfy his own vanity. He kept a carriage, and his fashionable dress earned him the less than complimentary sobriquet the Macaroni Parson:&#145;In the streets he walked with his head erect and with a lofty gait, like a man conscious of his own importance, and, perhaps, the dignity of his sacred calling&#146;  (Taylor, 2.250&#150;52). Yet, according to the accounts of those who knew him, while he might have been vain he was not as pompous as this description suggests; Sir Philip Thicknesse said that he was &#145;one of the best-tempered men I ever knew&#146;, good company, generous, although, significantly, &#145;void of all prudence&#146;  (Thicknesse, 1.220&#150;30). This popularity among fashionable society, however, brought little financial reward and even that was subject to the vagaries of fashion.<br>
<br>By the early 1770s Dodd's popularity had begun to wane as the fashion in preaching styles changed. His creditors became more pressing and this may have led him to live for a time near Hounslow Heath. But he needed to maintain his connection with wealthy society and so he took a house in Queen Street, Mayfair, about 1774. This made him more accessible to creditors, who besieged the house. To make matters worse his wife tried to bribe Lady Apsley so that her husband might present Dodd to the living of St George's, Hanover Square. Although Dodd seems to have been ignorant of his wife's efforts Lord Apsley was furious and had him removed from the list of royal chaplains. All hope of preferment in the church had gone and such reputation as Dodd had enjoyed went with it. Ridiculed in newspapers and satirized by Samuel Foote in <span class="italic">The Cozeners</span>, he fled to Geneva to join his old pupil Philip Stanhope, now earl of Chesterfield. On his return to England Chesterfield gave him the living of Wing in Berkshire and some money to pay off his most pressing creditors. Dodd continued to write and became editor of the <span class="italic">New Morning Post</span>. Unfortunately his absence abroad gave the governors of Magdalen Hospital the excuse to sack him, and in 1776 he relinquished the Charlotte Chapel, which had failed to bring the expected preferment and wealth.<br>
<br>By 1777 Dodd was living in Argyle Buildings, Argyle Street. Then came the final incident of his life. On 1 February he discounted a bill of exchange allegedly drawn by the earl of Chesterfield through Lewis Robertson, a broker. Dodd obtained &pound;4200 but the bill was a forgery and he was arrested on 5 February. He immediately confessed, exonerated Robertson, and arranged for repayment. Promises that the matter would not be pressed further were not honoured and he was taken before Sir Thomas Halifax, the lord mayor, at Guildhall, London. Both Halifax and Chesterfield's solicitor pressed forward the prosecution with enthusiasm, arguing that such offences threatened financial stability and deserved the severest punishment. Dodd was remanded to the Wood Street compter, where, at his request, he was visited by John Wesley, who also saw him when he was moved to Newgate prison. He was convicted of a capital forgery at the Old Bailey on 22 February 1777 but the jury recommended mercy. The passing of the death sentence was delayed while the judges decided that it had been correct to admit Robertson as a witness for the prosecution. Meanwhile a popular campaign began with the aim of obtaining mercy for Dodd. Newspaper coverage suddenly became sympathetic to him: no longer the Macaroni Parson he was now the &#145;unfortunate divine&#146;. Dodd approached Dr Johnson to assist him in seeking mercy, and, while Johnson disliked Dodd's lifestyle, he thought the penalty harsh and agreed to help him. The two men did not meet at this time, although they may have done so briefly some years previously. Johnson devoted a considerable amount of time to writing the speeches and prayers that were published under Dodd's name, including the one that he delivered to the court when he was eventually sentenced to death in May 1777 and a speech he was to have given, but did not, at the gallows. A large number of petitions were presented, including one with 23,000 signatures and others from Oxford and Cambridge universities, the trial jurors, and the common council of the corporation of the City of London. This support seemed to lead Dodd to believe that he would not be executed but it may have had the opposite effect by moving the lord chief justice, Lord Mansfield, to speak against mercy in the privy council from a belief that it might be dangerous to give in to such pressure. On 27 June 1777 Dodd was taken to be hanged at Tyburn. The crowds lining the streets along which he passed were said to have stood in silence. Efforts by the physician John Hunter to revive him failed and he was interred at St Lawrence's Church, Cowley, Middlesex, where his brother was vicar. A plaque on the church wall commemorates him, and according to local legend he is buried in the grounds of the modern rectory. Dodd, in his work, life, and death, exemplified some of the main concerns of the period: the fickleness and extravagance of London society, the decline of literary patronage, the dependence of individuals on wealthy patrons for their advancement, and the excesses and controversy surrounding capital punishment.<br>
