<span class="headword">Lewis,  Jessie Elizabeth  Penn-</span> <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Jessie Elizabeth Jones]</span>  (1861&#150;1927), <span class="occ">missioner and revivalist</span>, was born on 28 February 1861 in Victoria Terrace, Neath, Glamorgan, the eldest of the eight surviving children of Elias Jones (<i>d</i>. 1877), a civil engineer, and his wife, Heziah Hopkins. A sickly child, she was kept from school until the age of twelve out of fear that education would excite her overactive brain. Her home life was highly religious. In 1873 she was elected a member of the local Good Templar lodge and quickly went on to establish and organize the junior division of this temperance organization.<br>
<br>On 15 September 1880, at Neath parish church, Jessie married William Penn-Lewis (1859&#150;1925), the auditor's clerk for Sussex county council; he was the son of William Lewis, a painter. She moved with him to Brighton where, blighted by ill health (the marriage was childless), she embarked upon a period of intense self-scrutiny and interior prayer. In August 1883 William Penn-Lewis was appointed accountant to Richmond borough council and the couple moved to Surrey. Jessie Penn-Lewis soon became involved in the religious life of her new community. She joined the Holy Trinity Church in Richmond and in 1886 helped establish a local branch of the YWCA. Despite her intense involvement in local mission and rescue work, Penn-Lewis remained convinced of her spiritual unworthiness and need for self-sanctification. On 18 March 1892 her long-prayed-for spiritual breakthrough arrived. At breakfast that day she was confronted by a vision of a fistful of dirty rags, which she interpreted as a sign of the emptiness of her previous life. Later that evening, in a railway carriage just outside Wimbledon, she finally experienced a sense of complete consecration.<br>
<br>Following her spiritual awakening, Penn-Lewis moved with her husband, who had become city treasurer for Leicester, to Great Glen, Leicester. There she developed her personal theology which stressed a life of continual self-denial in imitation of the self-sacrifice of the crucified Christ. Attendance at the annual Keswick conventions from 1892 similarly served to deepen her conviction that personal holiness could be achieved only through an ongoing process of self-renunciation. Her theology was clearly articulated in her essay <span class="italic">The Pathway to Life in God</span> (1895), the first of over fifty self-published pamphlets that issued from her home in Leicester.<br>
<br>In June 1896 Penn-Lewis travelled to G&ouml;teborg, Sweden, to attend the first Scandinavian conference of the YWCA. At this meeting she won the friendship of a group of Russian and Finnish aristocrats including Prince Oscar Bernardotte, who invited her to carry out mission work among the Russian nobility. She visited St Petersburg annually from 1897 to 1903, holding praise meetings and organizing experimental prayer groups. This experience confirmed her sense of spiritual guidance and established her international reputation as a missioner. In August 1900 she lectured in Canada and the USA as the guest of the Moody Bible Institute, and in January 1903 she embarked on a revivalist mission to India.<br>
<br>While in India, Penn-Lewis wrote and published her most popular work, <span class="italic">The Word of the Cross</span> (1903). This work, according to her biographer Mary Garrard, sold over a million copies and was translated into over 100 languages. Its charismatic message of spirit obedience and self-renunciation was echoed internationally in the theology of the emergent Pentecostal groups and most notably in the Welsh religious revival of 1904&#150;5. Although Penn-Lewis probably overestimated her own contribution to the Welsh awakening, the revival did cement her friendship with the young evangelist Evan Roberts (1878&#150;1951), who retired to her Leicester home after his spiritual breakdown in 1905.<br>
<br>Together with Roberts, Penn-Lewis devoted her later years to the development of a &#145;saving theology&#146; which would allow believers to combat demonic interference and satanic deception. In 1907 she set up a monthly paper, <span class="italic">The Overcomer</span>, which hosted a &#145;spiritual clinic&#146; dealing with cases of suspected possession. In 1912 she published <span class="italic">War on the Saints</span> (co-written with Roberts), a sort of spiritual combat manual containing tactics for vanquishing both Satan and the individual self. These tactics were further refined in a series of monthly meetings at Eccleston Hall in London and annual congresses in Derbyshire at Matlock (1912&#150;14) and Swanwick (1919). Despite her growing ill health Penn-Lewis persisted in her evangelical activities until her death from pneumonia on 15 August 1927 at 4 Eccleston Place, Westminster, London, where she had lived following her husband's death. She was buried on 18 August alongside her husband in the Quaker burial-ground, Reigate, Surrey.<br>
