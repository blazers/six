<span class="headword">Starley,  John Kemp</span>  (1855&#150;1901), <span class="occ">bicycle manufacturer</span>, was born on 24 December 1855 in Walthamstow, Essex, the son of John Starley, market gardener, and his wife, Mary Ann Cippen. Starley won a grammar school scholarship and proved good at mathematics. His drawings of a steam engine with an oscillating piston so much impressed his uncle, the inventor and cycle maker <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26320/', "James Starley")</script>, that in 1872 James offered to train him in Coventry, taking him to live in his own house. Four years later, John Starley married nineteen-year-old Abigail, daughter of George Statham, a ribbon manufacturer and city councillor. The first of their six sons and four daughters, also John Kemp Starley, followed his father into the business he founded, eventually becoming managing director of the Rover Company.<br>
<br>John Starley worked for cycle makers Haynes and Jeffries (later Rudge) from 1877, with responsibility for the machinery. The following year he founded his own cycle manufacturing company, with capital supplied by William Sutton, the young owner of a small Coventry haberdashery shop. Starley exhibited his innovative Rover safety bicycle in 1885. This soon replaced the &#145;ordinary&#146; or &#145;penny-farthing&#146; bicycle with its huge front wheel, which was only suitable for the very fit and anyway was less efficient than the new design. Starley claimed to be the inventor of the safety bicycle, with the key features of a diamond frame, a rear acting crank, and equal size wheels. He wrote that he wanted to use effort more economically, which entailed a configuration in which essentials such as the crank shaft, pedals, seat, and handles were easily adjustable. Other inventors brought out similar designs around the same time and so Starley's claim has been disputed, but there is no doubt that his design was the best on the market, as the road race he organized in 1885 demonstrated; the Rover beat the best time achieved earlier over the same route on a Hillman bicycle.<br>
<br>Less commercially successful was Starley's experimental electrically driven tricar, which he tested three years later in Deauville, France, to avoid the prohibitions of the 1878 <span class="roman">Locomotive (or &#145;Red Flag&#146;) Act</span>. It ran at 8 m.p.h. and was subsequently hailed as the first Coventry-made motor car. Business was erratic, with severe slumps in 1891&#150;2 and after 1896. Starley was keen on employing the latest machinery but was often constrained by the financial position of the firm. He developed sales abroad, in particular in France, but found that bad debts in the United States limited his expansion in that direction. He attempted to improve his tyre supply and quality by acquiring interests in various tyre companies, until Dunlop's pneumatic tyres answered his requirements. In 1889 Starley adopted limited liability, and he floated J. K. Starley &amp; Co. as the public Rover Cycle Company in 1896. He received &pound;100,000 for the business, kept one-fifth of the ordinary shares, and remained as managing director. The new capital financed the construction of the largest cycle works in Coventry for Rover.<br>
<br>As a minority, but substantial, shareholder in the company, Starley proved cautious. He was still required, as managing director, to surrender the deeds of his house and other assets as security for the bank overdraft facilities that Rover utilized. Starley's rather austere character prevented his being caught up in the speculative frenzy that brought down a good part of the Coventry cycle industry when the bicycle boom burst. His cousins' cycle firm, Starley Brothers, and many other Coventry cycle businesses went into receivership after 1898, thanks to extravagance and over-capitalization by the financier Terah Hooley. Rover's financial results were poor after 1896, and as late as 1901 Starley was resisting his board's wishes to spend more on motor car experiments. He had, however, imported Peugeot motor bicycles in 1899 with a view to introducing a Rover model, and the company began manufacturing them a year after his death. Two years later, Rover moved into car making, finding it so profitable that it abandoned the by then loss-making cycle business altogether in 1912.<br>
<br>Starley followed in the inventive tradition of his uncle James, taking out eighty-seven patents in his own name. Between 1890 and 1896 Starley was a Liberal member of Coventry council, and was invited to stand for Warwickshire constituencies. He held strong, if unorthodox, views on religious matters, regularly attending a Congregational church, conducting a Sunday school class, and believing denominations should be abolished. The spiritual priority of the <span class="roman">New Testament</span>, Starley maintained, warranted reversing the conventional order of the <span class="roman">Bible</span>. He sent a copy of this &#145;Starley Bible&#146;, in which the <span class="roman">New Testament</span> preceded the <span class="roman">Old</span>, to Lev Tolstoy, whose religious views at the time he greatly admired.<br>
<br>A genuine philanthropist, Starley was president of the Coventry YMCA in 1895, a school board member, and a supporter of the Salvation Army. When General Booth and his staff visited Coventry, they stayed with Starley. His popularity and contribution to Coventry life was underlined by the 20,000 people estimated to have attended his funeral. A memorial fund in his name was established to promote &#145;road locomotion&#146;, and administered by the Institution of Mechanical Engineers. In 1901 Starley suddenly developed gallstones, and, his heart being judged too weak to risk an operation, died at his home, Barrs Hill House, in Radford Road, Coventry, on 29 October.<br>
