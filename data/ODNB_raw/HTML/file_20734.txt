<span class="headword">Oliver,  Tom</span>  (1788&#150;1864), <span class="occ">pugilist</span>, was born at Bledlow in Buckinghamshire on 18 July 1788, the son of William Oliver and his wife, Ann. He left his native place as a boy, and entered the service of Mr Baker, a gardener, at Millbank, London. A visit to a prize-fight in 1811 fired his ambition to enter the ring. The same year he fought Kimber, a stonemason, at Tothill Fields and beat him in an hour and forty minutes. He at once became known as the Chelsea Gardener, a title that stuck to him throughout his career until replaced by that of the Commissary. After several minor fights, on 15 May 1813 he beat George Cooper at Moulsey Hurst, Surrey, in seventeen minutes. On 17 May 1814 he met Ned Painter at Shepperton Range, Middlesex, for a purse of &pound;50 given by the Pugilistic Club, to be contended for in a 24 foot ring. In the second round Oliver received a blow that all but disabled him; but, after coming up to time and adopting Tom Cribb's system of milling on the retreat, he won the battle after fifty-one minutes by a lucky blow. He now became the landlord of the Duke's Head, 31 Peter Street, Westminster, a house which &#145;the fancy&#146; of the Westminster district made their headquarters. On 4 October 1816 he met Jack Carter, the Lancashire Hero, at Gretna Green, for 100 guineas a side. The spectators numbered about thirty thousand, and the marquess of Queensberry and Captain Barclay acted as the umpires. In the thirty-second round, at the end of forty-six minutes, Oliver was taken out of the ring in a state of stupor, and completely unable to see.<br>
<br>On 10 July 1818 Oliver encountered Bill Neat of Bristol at Gerrards Cross, but the authorities interfered, and the ring was moved to Rickmansworth, Hertfordshire, where Lord Yarmouth, Sir Henry Smith, and other celebrities were present. After one hour had elapsed, and twenty-eight rounds had been fought, Oliver was knocked senseless, and could not come up to time. However, on 28 May 1819 he completely defeated the black fighter Kendrick. He next, on 21 July 1819, encountered Dan Donnelly, the champion of Ireland, at Crawley Hurst, Sussex, for 100 guineas a side. Intense interest was manifested in this affair in both countries, and bets amounting to more than &pound;100,000 were made on the result. Oliver fought with his accustomed bravery, but in the thirty-fourth round he met with his increasingly customary defeat. On 13 January 1820 Oliver defeated Tom Shelton at Sawbridgeworth, Hertfordshire; but in a fight with his former opponent Ned Painter at North Walsham, Norfolk, on 17 July 1820, he lost the battle. He was then matched to fight Tom Spring on 20 February 1821 at Hayes, Middlesex. Spring was too much for him; but he showed great forbearance in the fight, and allowed Oliver much latitude. He also lost to T. Hickman, the gas-lightman, on 12 June 1821, and to Bill Abbott on 6 November 1821.<br>
<br>Oliver was now appointed to take charge of the ropes and stakes of the prize-ring, and he was a constant attendant at the ringside as commissary. His last fight was with Ben Burn at Hampton, Middlesex, on 28 January 1834, when he won in twenty-five minutes. On 15 July 1846 he was sentenced at the Oxford assizes to three weeks' imprisonment for being present at a fight between Gill and Norley. During his latter years he was a fruiterer and greengrocer at Portman Market and 27 New Church Street, Chelsea. He died in London in June 1864, leaving a son, Frederick Oliver, also a pugilist and a commissary of the ring, who died on 30 January 1870.<br>
