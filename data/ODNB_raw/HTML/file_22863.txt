<span class="headword">Pugh,  Ellis</span>  (1656&#150;1718), <span class="occ">Quaker minister in America</span>, was born in August 1656 at Penrhos, near Tyddyn-y-garreg, Dolgellau, in Merioneth, to unknown parents. His father died before his birth, and his mother a few days after he was born. He received only a limited education and became a stonemason at Brithdir. In his early years Pugh was inclined to indulge in &#145;the heedless haste of youth, in the paths of folly&#146;  (&#145;Biographical sketches&#146;, 28.284), but in 1674, under the ministration of the Quaker itinerant preacher John ap John, he became a convinced Friend, and in 1680 he became a minister.<br>
<br>Pugh married Sina, a widow with nine small children, but there is no further information relating to this marriage. In 1686 Pugh and his family emigrated to America, but before he set sail Pugh caught a fever. During this period he received a visitation from God whereby he was warned that he would &#145;meet with trouble and exercises &hellip; and that he had work for him in that country (Great Britain), and that he must return, after a time, to his native land&#146;  (Evans and Evans, 4.338). The winter voyage to the West Indies was particularly turbulent, and Pugh was grateful to reach Barbados in March 1687. The following summer Pugh continued his journey to America, and at first settled at Schuylkill, near Haverford, where he was &#145;a faithful and zealous labourer of the gospel, preaching fervently in his native tongue&#146;  (&#145;Biographical sketches&#146;, 28.284). He later bought land near Plymouth township, Montgomery county, Pennsylvania. There he was &#145;a serviceable instrument in the Lord's hand, to cherish and instruct many, in meekness and tenderness&#146;  (Evans and Evans, 4.339), and his missionary endeavours drew many converts to Quakerism.<br>
<br>In 1706 Pugh returned to Wales and conducted a missionary tour around the country &#145;to the benefit and acceptance of many&#146;  (&#145;Biographical sketches&#146;, 28.292). On 29 December 1706 John Kelsall, a Montgomeryshire Friend, noted Pugh's visit to the Dolobran meeting: &#145;he was concerned wholly in Welsh, there was much innocency with him &amp; he had many pretty openings and advice to Friends&#146;  (RS Friends, Lond., MS 193/4). In 1708, shortly after his return to America, three of his children died within a month. This naturally caused him severe anguish, but with divine help he was able to overcome this tragedy and stated that &#145;If he could bear his affliction acceptably in the sight of God, it would be marrow to his bones&#146;  (Evans and Evans, 4.339). During the last fifteen months of his life Pugh suffered from a prolonged illness, but did not neglect his missionary work for Friends. During the last Quaker meeting for worship he attended, the following was said of him:<blockquote>he was weak of body, but fervent in spirit, as one taking his last leave in a great deal of love and tenderness. &hellip; He was fitted to counsel others, because his life and conversation were answerable to his testimony; and amongst his family he was tender, and careful to counsel them to live in the fear of God. (ibid., 4.340)</blockquote>On 3 December 1718 Ellis Pugh died in Pennsylvania aged sixty-two. According to Friends he was &#145;of a meek and quiet spirit, considerate and solid in his judgement, of few words, honest and careful in his calling, honourable among his Friends, and of a good report among people generally&#146;  (Bowden, 2.259).<br>
<br>In 1721 Pennsylvania Friends posthumously published Pugh's <span class="italic">Annerch ir Cymru</span>, which was subsequently translated by Rowland Ellis and David Lloyd as <span class="italic">A Salutation to the Britains</span>, published in Pennsylvania in 1727 and reprinted in London in 1739. The first version, it has been suggested, was the first Welsh printed book in America. The preface to this edition encouraged &#145;craftsmen, labourers and shepherds, men of low degree, of my own quality&#146;, and sought that they would become &#145;wiser than their teachers&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>). This text offered &#145;encouragement and instruction of them that were seeking the way to Sion, the New Jerusalem&#146;  (Pugh, <span class="italic">A Salutation</span>, xi). During his life Pugh also wrote <span class="italic">On Baptism and the Lord's Supper</span>, which offered an insight into his theological beliefs.<br>
