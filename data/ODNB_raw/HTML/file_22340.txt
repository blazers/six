<span class="headword">Pitt,  George</span>, first Baron Rivers  (1721&#150;1803), <span class="occ">politician and diplomatist</span>, eldest son of George Pitt (<i>d</i>. 1745), MP, of Stratfieldsaye, Hampshire, and his wife, Mary Louisa, daughter of John Bernier of Strasbourg, was born on 1 May 1721 in Geneva. He was educated at Winchester College and he matriculated on 26 September 1737 from Magdalen College, Oxford; he graduated MA on 13 March 1739 and DCL on 21 August 1745. From 1740 to 1742 he travelled with his tutor Edward Holdsworth in Italy, where he was a great favourite of Lady Mary Wortley Montagu. At a by-election in June 1742 he was returned to the House of Commons for Shaftesbury, Dorset, and he joined the tory opposition. On 4 January 1746 he married Penelope Atkins (1724/5&#150;1795), daughter of Sir Henry Atkins, fourth baronet, of Clapham, Surrey, and Penelope Stonehouse. They had three daughters and one son, but their marriage was very unhappy; Horace Walpole, who greatly admired Penelope Pitt, accused George Pitt of cruelty and ill-treatment.<br>
<br>At the general election in 1747 Pitt was returned both for Shaftesbury and for Dorset. He elected to sit for the county and he continued to represent Dorset until the parliamentary dissolution in September 1774. He was appointed colonel of the Dorset militia on its establishment in 1757, and following George III's accession he voted with the government as an independent. From 1761 to 1768 he served as envoy-extraordinary and minister-plenipotentiary to Turin. On 19 February 1770 he was appointed ambassador-extraordinary and minister-plenipotentiary to Madrid, but was succeeded in that post by Lord Grantham in January 1771. His desire for a peerage was finally granted when he was created Baron Rivers of Stratfieldsaye in the county of Southampton on 20 May 1776; he took his seat in the House of Lords on the following day. In May 1780 Pitt was appointed lord lieutenant of Hampshire, but he only held that post until 1782, when he became one of the lords of the bedchamber. In October 1793 he was appointed lord lieutenant of Dorset, and on 16 March 1802 he was created Baron Rivers of Sudeley Castle in the county of Gloucester. He published anonymously his thoughts on political and constitutional matters in 1784, and his two anonymous works on Dorset issues appeared in 1791 and 1793. Pitt died at Stratfieldsaye on 7 May 1803 and was buried in the family vault there; a mural tablet by Flaxman was erected to his memory in the church. Lady Rivers, who probably lived separately from her husband from 1771 onwards, had resided mostly in France and Italy, and she died in Milan on 1 January 1795. The title was inherited by their son, George (1751&#150;1828), together with the estate of Stratfieldsaye, which was purchased by the nation in 1814 for the duke of Wellington.<br>

<a name="cosubject_22340"></a><span class="headword">Sir William Augustus Pitt</span>  (<em>c.</em>1728&#150;1809), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, brother of George Pitt and fourth son of the family, was appointed cornet in the 10th dragoons on 1 February 1744, and served in the Seven Years' War. He distinguished himself in several actions, and was wounded and taken prisoner at Campen. He served as MP for Wareham, Dorset, from 1754 to 1761. Pitt became colonel in 1762 and major-general in 1770, and he was promoted to be colonel of the 12th dragoons in October 1770; five years later he was transferred to the 3rd Irish horse. He became lieutenant-general in 1777 and general in 1793, was from 1784 to 1791 commander of the forces in Ireland, and was governor of Portsmouth from 1794 until his death; he was also colonel of the 1st dragoon guards from July 1796. Pitt was created a knight of the Bath in 1792. He was married to Mary Howe, daughter of Emanuel Scroope Howe, second Viscount Howe, on 21 June 1763. He died at Highfield Park, Hampshire, on 29 December 1809, leaving no heir.<br>
