<span class="headword">Macartney,  James</span>  (1770&#150;1843), <span class="occ">anatomist</span>, was born on 8 March 1770 at Armagh, the youngest of the six surviving children of James Macartney (<i>d</i>. 1790), gentleman farmer of Ballyrea, co. Armagh, and Mary (<i>d</i>. 1788), the eldest of the five children of John Maxwell, a Presbyterian minister in Armagh, and former moderator of the Presbyterian synod, and Rose Carson of Strabane. Macartney was educated privately and at the classical school, Armagh, but had an inability to remember lessons, retain information derived from books, or to master Euclid and maths  (Thornton, 164). He was a radical Presbyterian and may have inherited his unitarian beliefs from his mother. Macartney's father, though nominally a Presbyterian, associated himself with no particular church and rarely attended service.<br>
<br>Macartney served as a clerk to his cousins' linen business in Newry but on the death of his father in 1790 he returned home to farm the family property with his brothers until he moved to Dublin to study surgery. In March 1794 he was apprenticed to William Hartigan, professor of anatomy in the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, and on 10 August 1795 he married Mary Ekenhead of Newry. He also studied chemistry at Trinity College. In 1796, with Hartigan's consent, Macartney moved to London to continue his professional education and during the next three years attended several of the London hospital schools, as well as the Great Windmill Street school. In 1798, the final year of his apprenticeship, Macartney was appointed demonstrator in anatomy to Abernethy at St Bartholomew's Hospital at a salary of &pound;50 per year. He dissected so much during the summer of 1799 that his health became weakened, so that he was unable to walk without the aid of a stick. On 6 February 1800 Macartney became a member of the Royal College of Surgeons of London and immediately afterwards was appointed lecturer in comparative anatomy at St Bartholomew's medical school, commencing his first course of lectures in March 1800. He continued to lecture there until his resignation in 1811. Macartney had illustrated his lectures with anatomical specimens made partly at his own expense. The hospital then claimed these as their own property, forcing Macartney to pay for a duplicate set. It was this, plus further disputes, which caused Macartney to resign his post. Macartney combined his lecturing duties rather improbably with the position of surgeon to the Radnor militia, to which he was appointed early in 1803. Macartney also supervised William Ross's <span class="italic">Lectures on Comparative Anatomy</span> (1802), a translation of Georges Cuvier's <span class="italic">Le&ccedil;ons d'anatomie compar&eacute;e</span>. In March 1811 Macartney was elected a fellow of the Royal Society and in August of that year he returned to Ireland with his regiment.<br>
<br>On the termination of his military duties in 1812 Macartney determined to remain in Ireland and to seek the chair of anatomy and surgery in Trinity College&#151;given that its holder, his old master, Hartigan, was seriously ill. Hartigan died in December 1812 and on 21 June of the following year Macartney was appointed in his place. He had obtained the degree of MD from the University of St Andrews a month earlier. On 3 July 1813 he was given an honorary MD degree by Trinity College.<br>
<br>As professor of anatomy Macartney was obliged to deliver a course of twelve public lectures, open to all students of the university, as well as a course of systematic lectures on five days of the week, and to superintend the work of the dissecting room. The professorship carried with it the office of clinical physician to Sir Patrick Dun's Hospital and Macartney had to deliver clinical lectures in the hospital to the students of the medical school. The theme of his introductory lecture, delivered to &#145;an overflowing house&#146;  (Crosse, 59), on 1 November 1813 was the importance of anatomy in medical study. It appears that Macartney also took part in body snatching and in February 1814 was arrested by soldiers but subsequently released  (Crosse, 64). In Macartney's first year fifty-three students entered for the systematic course and twenty-one for dissections. In the following year he and Arthur Jacob established the National Eye Dispensary in North Cumberland Street. He obtained leave from the board of the university for Jacob to lecture in the medical school on the anatomy and diseases of the eye, and for John Pentland, afterwards master of the Rotunda Hospital, to lecture on midwifery, a subject that was not at the time taught in Trinity College. The number of students increased rapidly, reaching 303 in 1820. It would be incorrect to attribute the entire expansion in medical student numbers to Macartney&#151;the numbers in arts were also rising at the time&#151;but his reputation, his acknowledged ability in general science, physiology, surgery, and comparative anatomy attracted many Irish students who would otherwise have gone to Edinburgh, and even a few from England and Scotland. William Stokes later referred to the Trinity medical school of 1820 as &#145;a grammar school of anatomy and book medicine and little more&#146; but, according to R. B. McDowell and D. A. Webb, it was this very programme as taught by Macartney that drew in the students who were later to benefit from the clinical teaching of Stokes and his equally renowned colleague, Robert James Graves  (McDowell and Webb, 89). On 16 August 1824 he was elected to an honorary fellowship of the King and Queen's College of Physicians in Ireland and on 25 October 1824 he was admitted a licentiate. On 21 August 1833 an honorary MD from the University of Cambridge was conferred on him.<br>
<br>Macartney resigned his chair on 11 July 1837 after a protracted and bitter dispute with his faculty colleagues and the board of the university over the time of his lectures. Alexander Macalister claimed in his memoir that &#145;by their own act, and by a continuous course of petty annoyances and persecutions, the University of Dublin lost the services of the greatest teacher, the best anatomist, the most philosophic surgeon that Ireland has ever produced&#146;. This was typical Macalister hagiography. Macartney's resignation owed more to his own disputatious and truculent nature than to intransigence on the university's part. He was an able and progressive teacher, conscientious and hard-working, and committed to the cause of educational and medical reform. He was, in the eyes of his contemporaries, the finest anatomist and physiologist that Ireland had produced. But he was also egotistical, quarrelsome, hot-tempered, outspoken, difficult, obdurate, and unpopular with his medical and academic colleagues. His obituarist in the <span class="italic">Dublin Medical Press</span> (8 March 1843, 160)&#151;possibly his old associate, Arthur Jacob, who was one of the joint owners and editors&#151;in a balanced appraisal, wrote:<blockquote>Dr Macartney had, like every other man, his faults and his failings, which, unlike the majority of men, he neither concealed nor varnished; but, on the other hand, he had his perfections and his merits. He nurtured in his breast a spirit of independence rarely to be met with, and a conscientious respect and regard for truth and honour not often found among persons making greater professions.</blockquote>However, in his diary Macartney claimed that he had been wrongly seen as:<blockquote>supposed unrelenting to solicitation&#151;devoid of compassion, more tenacious of my own opinion than desirous to find the truth&#151;penurious &amp; even miserly, harsh &amp; tyrannical to those in my power &hellip; I have also been considered by some people as unsteady in carrying my purposes into effect &amp; of being indolent &amp; changeable &amp; I have been told that I have no predilection for the fair sex, nor love for children by Le Deville the phrenologist. If I was to name any person whom I have ever known as possessing the opposite qualities in the greatest degree that person would be myself. (Thornton, 164&#150;5)</blockquote>In politics Macartney was an active member of The Society of United Irishmen and while in Newry &#145;formed a similar organization at Armagh&#146;  (Thornton, 167).<br>
<br>In 1836 Macartney sold the museum of anatomical and pathological preparations that he had collected in Dublin to Cambridge University for an annual payment of &pound;100 for ten years. He died at his residence, 31 Upper Merrion Street, Dublin, on 6 March 1843, probably from apoplexy. He was buried at Mount Jerome cemetery three days later.<br>
