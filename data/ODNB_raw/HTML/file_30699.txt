</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Belloc,  (Joseph) Hilaire Pierre Ren&eacute;</span>  (1870&#150;1953), <span class="occ">poet and author</span>, was born on 27 July 1870 at La Celle St Cloud, near Paris, the younger child of Louis Marie Belloc (1830&#150;1872), barrister, and his wife, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/41193/', "Elizabeth Rayner (Bessie) Parkes (1829&#150;1925)")</script>, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21356/', "Joseph Parkes")</script>, a prosperous solicitor from Birmingham, and his wife, Eliza. Louis Belloc was French (although with Irish blood from his maternal grandfather, Armand Swanton); his father Hilaire was a well-known portrait painter. Bessie's family was both wealthy and cultivated&#151;her father founded the Reform Club&#151;and she grew up among eminent Victorians. She became a Roman Catholic as a young woman and Cardinal Manning was among her friends.<br>
<br>Hilaire Belloc was born just before the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian war; a few weeks later the family retreated to England, having taken the last train out of Paris. When the Bellocs returned to the family home after the war they found that it had been wrecked and pillaged by Prussian soldiers. Belloc would have been too young to remember this episode, but accounts of it would have fuelled his lifelong prejudice against all things German. When he was only two years old his father died, and Bessie Belloc and her two children (the older, Marie, became the well-known novelist <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/39089/', "Mrs Belloc Lowndes")</script>) moved to London. She had inherited enough family money to be comfortably off, but lost most of it when she entrusted it to an incompetent stockbroker. Thereafter the family were never far from genteel poverty, though Belloc did not realize this for several years; the loss of what he liked to think of as a considerable fortune was a cause of enduring resentment. The Bellocs then settled at Slindon in Sussex, a county he came to love and celebrate in his writings. He spent holidays in France and throughout his life preserved a sense of Anglo-French identity. He grew up to be a prolific and respected English writer but his French origins gave him an unusual and sometimes disconcerting view of English life and society.<h2>
<a name="Educationandearlycareer"></a>Education and early career</h2>Belloc attended the Oratory School, Birmingham, between 1880 and 1887; it had been founded by John Henry Newman and the aged cardinal occasionally appeared before the boys, but Belloc had no high regard for him. After he left school his characteristic energy and restlessness made it hard for him to settle to a career; in succession he attempted to train for the French navy, to become a farmer, and then a draughtsman. In 1891 he travelled across the United States, walking much of the time, financing himself by making drawings and selling them. He was bound for California on a romantic mission to see Elodie Agnes Hogan (1868&#150;1914), an Irish-American girl he had met and with whom he had fallen in love when she was visiting London with her mother and sisters the previous year. The journey was inconclusive, though they eventually married. Belloc spent most of 1892 doing his military service in the French army as an artilleryman; this was necessary if he wished to retain French nationality, though a few years later he opted to become a British subject. It was a severe but highly formative experience, which gave him a lifelong interest in military matters. It also made him aware that he was by now more of an Englishman than a Frenchman; he was known to his comrades as &#145;l'Anglais&#146; and later wrote, &#145;I had come into the regiment faulty in my grammar and doubtful in accent, ignorant especially of those things which in every civilization are taken for granted but never explained in full&#146;  (<span class="italic">Hills and the Sea</span>, 1930, 89). The experience is said to have left his spoken French with soldierly turns of phrase which could be an embarrassment on formal occasions.<br>
<br>After he returned from France, Belloc was admitted to Balliol College, Oxford, with the financial support of his sister and her fianc&eacute;. Belloc loved Oxford, and particularly Balliol, as he later recalled in one of his best-known poems, &#145;To the Balliol Men Still in Africa&#146;. He became a star performer in debates at the Oxford Union and was awarded a first in modern history in 1895. After he graduated he applied for a prize fellowship at All Souls College, which would have given him a financially secure niche in Oxford&#151;without any teaching duties&#151;for the next few years, while becoming established in an academic or legal career. He was over-optimistic about his chances in the highly competitive examination, and he was not successful; his aggressive and argumentative demeanour had already made him enemies in the small world of the university. He took this disappointment very hard, and thereafter lost no opportunity to mock and ridicule &#145;dons&#146; and &#145;pedants&#146;, just as the loss of family money lay behind his attacks on the &#145;rich&#146;, though he enjoyed the company of rich people and was always ready to cultivate them.<h2>
<a name="Earlypublicationsandmarriage"></a>Early publications and marriage</h2>For a while Belloc hung on in Oxford, making money by tutoring and giving extension lectures, while unsuccessfully applying for academic posts. He was also launching himself as a writer, and it was in this early phase of his career that, beginning with <span class="italic">The Bad Child's Book of Beasts</span> in 1896, he started to produce the comic and satirical verse which for many readers is the best-known and most enjoyable part of his <i>&#339;uvre</i>. In the same year he published <span class="italic">Sonnets and Verse</span>, a collection of sonnets and lyrical poems which are classical in form but romantic in spirit, and are at their best when they are most compressed and epigrammatic. Henceforth he made his living by his pen, and as a man of immense energy, versatile talents, and wide reading, he worked in many genres. <span class="italic">Danton</span> (1899) was the first of a long series of studies in French and English history.<br>
<br>For five years Belloc had corresponded with Elodie Hogan, and he had never doubted his love for her, which took the form of what his biographer A. N. Wilson has called &#145;a chivalric ardour&#146;  (Wilson, 67). Elodie, a very devout (and painfully scrupulous) Catholic, was unsure whether to marry or to become a nun; eventually she entered a convent to try out the religious life, but the experiment showed that she was not suited to it. Belloc crossed the Atlantic again and married Elodie at Napa, California, in June 1896. It was to be a happy marriage, but Belloc, restless and constantly needing money to support his growing family, was often away from home on lecture tours which took him all over England, with occasional trips to the United States. There were, too, the walking holidays, alone or with male companions, which provided material for books and essays. In 1897 Elodie gave birth to a son, Louis, the first of their five children.<br>
<br>Belloc eventually realized that he would never get a college fellowship in Oxford, and in 1899 the family moved to London, to a rented house at 104 Cheyne Walk, Chelsea. In 1900 he met <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32392/', "G. K. Chesterton")</script> whom he strongly influenced. Belloc's literary career was taking off, though finances were always precarious, and he began producing a stream of books and articles. His energy was prodigious; he had a sharp, dogmatic intelligence, and there were few subjects on which he did not have strong opinions. In 1902 he published <span class="italic">The Path to Rome</span>, which remains one of his most attractive and popular books; it tells the story of the author's solitary walk&#151;in effect a personal pilgrimage&#151;from Toul in Lorraine, where he had done his military service, to Rome. It is full of entertaining reflections about the people he met and Sternean digressions on whatever came into his mind on the journey. It also shows his capacity to convey physical experience vividly, as, for instance, in the account of crossing the Alps, when he was lost in a snowstorm. Belloc wrote many other books in this vein of reflective pedestrianism, describing journeys through France and England and further afield. <span class="italic">The Four Men: a Farrago</span> (1912) is one of the best of them, a semi-fictional account of a walk through Sussex with three invented companions. Pedestrianism came into Belloc's many historical studies; he was particularly interested in military history, and before writing about a battle he liked to traverse the battlefield on foot. In 1904 he published <span class="italic">Emmanuel Burden</span>, the first of a series of satirical novels about Edwardian political and social life (some of them illustrated by Chesterton).<h2>
<a name="ApublicpersonalityandCatholicapologist"></a>A public personality and Catholic apologist</h2>In the Edwardian era Belloc acquired a public literary personality: a lover of wine and beer, of songs and male companionship, of walking and sailing, who was at home on both sides of the channel. J. B. Morton wrote, &#145;His wit was French but his humour English. &hellip; He was profoundly moved by the beauty of the English landscape, but preferred the French way of living&#146;  (Morton, 3&#150;4). In 1906 Belloc and his family left London for Sussex, where he had bought King's Land, a rambling brick house in Shipley, near Horsham (parts of it dating from the fourteenth century); it was his home for the rest of his life, though his constant journeying meant that he was seldom there for long at a time.<br>
<br>Most famously, Belloc became known as a polemical apologist for the Roman Catholic church, which he regarded as the only source of sanity and order in the world. He was an important influence on the small Roman Catholic community in England, giving them a new self-confidence, insisting that though they might seem to be a vulnerable minority in an offshore protestant island they were really part of the universal church with its centre in Rome. Although Roman Catholicism was central to Belloc's life and his writings, these reflect little of the serenity and hope of faith. His religion was a disciplined matter of the will and the intelligence, but his subjective stance to the world was a sad, stoic acceptance of the blows of fate, more pagan than Christian in spirit. It informs some of his best writing, such as the reflections on exile and death at the end of <span class="italic">The Four Men</span>, and much of his poetry. The epigram &#145;The False Heart&#146; is characteristic:<blockquote>
<div>I said to Heart, &#145;How goes it?&#146; Heart replied:<br>
</div>
<div>&#145;Right as a Ribstone Pippin!&#146; But it lied.<br>
</div>
</blockquote>
<h2>
<a name="LiberalMP"></a>Liberal MP</h2>In 1906 Belloc entered politics as Liberal MP for South Salford, placing himself on the radical wing of the party. It was to be an unsatisfactory and disillusioning experience, for he was never at ease with the practice and assumptions of the British parliamentary system and turned sharply against it after he left the House of Commons in 1910. He was outraged by the Marconi scandal of 1913, in which members of the Liberal government, including David Lloyd George, chancellor of the exchequer, were accused of improper trading in the shares of the Marconi Company. It was a complex business, never fully resolved, but Belloc had no doubt of the ministers' guilt. In 1911 he founded a weekly journal, the <span class="italic">Eye Witness</span> (later the <span class="italic">New Witness</span>) in collaboration with Cecil Chesterton, G. K.'s younger brother, a fierce crusading journalist whose temperament and beliefs were akin to his own. Following an imprudent article on the Marconi affair in the <span class="italic">New Witness</span> Cecil Chesterton appeared in court charged with criminal libel, was found guilty, and fined. This episode deepened Belloc's bitterness.<br>
<br>Belloc believed that true democracy was feasible only in small communities such as the Greek city state or the Swiss canton, and that in large modern societies it inevitably degenerated into oligarchy. He had originally described himself as a republican and, despite his Catholicism, supported the ideals of the French Revolution; later he shifted towards a belief in absolute monarchy, or, in effect, dictatorship, as he expounded in <span class="italic">The House of Commons and Monarchy</span> (1920). In 1912 he published a critique of modern society, <span class="italic">The Servile State</span>, which attacks both capitalism and socialism. His thesis is that modern civilization combines notional political freedom with economic slavery, since most people possess little or no property, and property is essential for both freedom and well-being. He opposed recent legislation imposing employers' liability and compulsory national insurance, since it reinforced a society divided by status, where the proletariat are essentially dispossessed. Belloc's ideal was a society of peasant proprietors or craftsmen, negotiating with each other by free contract, where property is widely distributed and not concentrated in a few hands. <span class="italic">The Servile State</span> is forceful and lucid though repetitive, and its ideas were later developed in the distributist movement in which Belloc and G. K. Chesterton were active in the 1920s.<h2>
<a name="Wifesdeaththewarandpostwarpublications"></a>Wife's death, the war, and post-war publications</h2>Belloc was shattered when Elodie died (probably of cancer) early in 1914. He treasured her memory for the rest of his life, turning her room at King's Land into a shrine which was never opened, and always wearing black. J. B. Morton recalled him thus:<blockquote>The black clothes, black tie and old-fashioned, stiff, stick-up collar made him look like the Frenchman of my boyhood. But the ruddy complexion and the broad, square shoulders and massive body gave him the look of an English farmer. (Morton, 26)</blockquote>The outbreak of the First World War strengthened Belloc's attachment to France, a Catholic nation at the heart of civilization in conflict with protestant Germany, or &#145;Prussia&#146;, as he liked to call it; he regarded the Catholic south Germans and Austrians as at best misguided, at worst renegades. During the war he was much in demand as a commentator on military affairs, and this work temporarily restored his finances. But his grief over Elodie was extended when his eldest son, Louis, an airman, was reported missing in action and was later confirmed as dead; a further blow was the death of Cecil Chesterton in December 1918 from an illness contracted on active service.<br>
<br>Belloc entered the post-war period &#145;an unhappy and a disappointed man&#146;, in Morton's words  (Morton, 118); to his existing resentments were added disgust with public affairs and sorrow at personal losses. Two books from the 1920s develop some of his basic ideas. <span class="italic">Europe and the Faith</span> (1920) sets out a mythologized reading of European history: true civilization has been preserved by the Latin Catholic nations as the legacy of Rome, with France the senior partner; Belloc is hostile to the protestant nations and ignores the Orthodox ones. The Roman Catholic church has continued and transformed the Roman empire; he argues &#145;that the Catholic Church which accepted it in its maturity caused it to survive, and was, in that origin of Europe, and has since remained, the soul of our Western civilization&#146;  (p. 163). England, which Belloc loved, was a special case; it had been a province of the empire but was lost to the barbarians; then it was redeemed by a thousand years of communion with Christian Rome. <span class="italic">Europe and the Faith</span> is a work of personal mythmaking, written with passion and energy, rather than of accurate historiography.<br>
<br>In <span class="italic">The Jews</span> (1922) Belloc argues that the Jews are an essentially alien people who cannot be successfully assimilated in Christian societies; he refers to the Jews with respect and even admiration and denies that he is antisemitic. There is no doubt, though, that that was the case, as is evident from his novels and references in his essays and verse. He rejects any suggestion of persecuting or expelling the Jews and proposes that they should be recognized as a special community, with the rights and responsibilities of resident foreigners; this is, in effect, an extension of the ancient institution of the ghetto. Despite its conciliatory tone, the book is offensive as well as unconvincing; it reflects not just personal prejudice but Belloc's adherence to the attitudes of the French right, evident in his lifelong belief in the guilt of Dreyfus. The deepest cause of his antisemitism seems to have been the ancient Christian hostility to the Jews as deicides.<br>
<br>Belloc's qualities as a writer are much more happily expressed in two other books of the 1920s. <span class="italic">The Cruise of the &#145;Nona&#146;</span> (1925) is in the relaxed, digressive vein of travel writing first evident in <span class="italic">The Path to Rome</span>. It recalls a voyage which he made round the coast of England in his small boat on the eve of war in 1914. <span class="italic">Belinda</span> (1928) is a romantic novella subtitled &#145;A Tale of Affection in Youth and Age&#146;; it has a fairy-tale setting in early Victorian England and is written in a sparkling pastiche of the minor fiction of the period. It possesses a delicate charm and tenderness, and is quite unlike most of his writing.<h2>
<a name="Lastyears"></a>Last years</h2>In his final years Belloc was a public figure with many friends and admirers, in the Catholic world and outside it; in his personal life, though, he was lonely, and increasingly wearied by having to turn out books for money. His desolation deepened during the Second World War when his son Peter died on active service in the Royal Marines. After a stroke in 1942 his health declined and he became senile within a few years. Many of Belloc's numerous books are now forgotten, though some remain immensely readable as biography and history, and others are significant contributions to early twentieth-century debates about politics and social organization; developments in the Roman Catholic church since the Second Vatican Council (1962&#150;5) have made his writings about religion very dated, and his antisemitism has been universally rejected. But as he remarked in an essay on Gibbon, whom he detested as a historian because of his anti-Christian content but loved as a writer, &#145;A writer's business is to write&#146;  (<span class="italic">A Conversation with an Angel</span>, 1928, 24). And at his best he wrote extraordinarily well; in some of his travel writing and personal narratives he is a master of prose; as a serious poet he is minor but memorable and sometimes haunting; and his comic verse is splendid&#151;it remains in print and is frequently quoted.<br>
<br>Hilaire Belloc died on 16 July 1953 at the Mount Alvernia Nursing Home, Guildford, Surrey, from shock and burns following a fall at King's Land when he was trying to put a log on a fire. He was buried at West Grinstead, Sussex, on 20 July 1953.<br>
