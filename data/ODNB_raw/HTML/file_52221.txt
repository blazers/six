<span class="headword">Sturmy,  Robert</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1458), <span class="occ">merchant</span>, was probably a native of Bristol, but nothing is known of his parentage, though a brother, John is recorded. His wife, Ellen, to whom he was married before 1438, and who traded as feme sole, survived him and was still alive in 1466. They had no children. Sturmy served as bailiff in Bristol in 1442&#150;3, as sheriff in 1451&#150;2, and as mayor in 1453&#150;4. His first entry into the records, however, concerns trade. Apparently acting as a factor for the Londoners John Nanskilly, draper, and Stephen Titmersh, mercer, he imported dyestuffs and oil into London in 1433. As an independent merchant, Sturmy initially concentrated his activities&#151;not atypically for a Bristol merchant&#151;on Ireland and Gascony. But later his horizons expanded: imports of dyestuffs, fruit, and paper to London and Southampton between 1447 and 1457 indicate contacts with Italy and Spain, and this is confirmed by his exporting wool to Pisa in 1456. As an extension of his commercial activities in the Mediterranean, Sturmy transported pilgrims to Jerusalem (1445) and Santiago de Compostela (1451). All these activities were dwarfed, however, by the expedition to the Mediterranean that Sturmy mounted in 1457&#150;8. On 8 February 1457 he obtained a licence to export thither tin, lead, wool, and cloth, worth some &pound;37,000, via Bristol and Weymouth, and his will, dated 27 June 1457, bore witness to his high hopes: it contained legacies of at least &pound;173 12<i>s</i>. but these were to more than double (to &pound;372 8<i>s</i>. 8<i>d</i>.) if his three ships returned safely to port.<br>
<br>Commercial enterprise on this scale was far beyond the powers of any one merchant, and Sturmy managed to persuade not only a number of London and Bristol merchants, but also John, Lord Stourton (<i>d</i>. 1462), and Richard, duke of York (<i>d</i>. 1460), to invest in his expedition. At first all went well: the ships called at Pisa in September 1457 and Naples in the autumn, but once they embarked on their return voyage, via Rhodes and Candia (Crete), they were attacked off Malta by the Genoese freebooter Giuliano Gattilusio on 10 June 1458. Sturmy was killed, but his partner, the Bristol merchant John Heyton, managed to escape, collect depositions from local authorities, and make his way back to England, where on 30 October 1458 he charged the Genoese merchants in England with collusion in the attack. The ensuing council trial confirmed the dimensions of the expedition, and also demonstrated Sturmy's real purpose. Of the total of &pound;18,166 13<i>s</i>. 4<i>d</i>. in damages claimed, sweet eastern Mediterranean wines, Turkish carpets, oriental fine cloth&#151;velvet, damask, satin&#151;and spices ranked prominently, but Sturmy's true objective is revealed by the claim for the loss of 152 tons of alum worth &pound;3040. Europe's supplies of alum, a mordant required to fix dyes in fine cloth, had been cut off for the time being by the Turkish conquest of Asia Minor in 1453 and prices had soared. The monopoly of the alum trade previously enjoyed by the Genoese <i>maona</i> of Chios (a Genoa-based company which had gained control of the administration of the island) was inevitably endangered, and Bristol and London merchants, heavily committed to exporting west-country cloth made of fine Cotswold wool, suffered. Sturmy seized the opportunity to deal directly with the Turks, buy up alum, and break the Genoese monopoly. Their commercial position gravely imperilled, the Genoese fitted out Gattilusio's corsairs in March and April 1458 and dispatched him to scuttle Sturmy's commercial ambitions. As an Aegean freebooter and a partner in the <i>maona</i>, Gattilusio was the ideal agent for such an enterprise, and indeed he did manage to capture Sturmy's ships and cargoes. The long-term consequences were, however, grave. Genoese merchants in England were arrested and their goods sequestered, and on 25 July 1459 the council condemned them to pay damages to the value of &pound;6000 to Sturmy's English investors. Sturmy himself had perished in Gattilusio's attack, and his will was proved on 12 December 1458.<br>
