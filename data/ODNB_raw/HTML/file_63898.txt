<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Catesby family</span>  (<em>per. </em><em>c.</em>1340&#150;1505), <span class="occ">gentry</span>, came originally from a tenant family of Flecknoe, east Warwickshire. It was <a name="cosubject_63892"></a><span class="headword">William [i] Catesby</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1383)<span class="occ"></span> and his son <a name="cosubject_63894"></a><span class="headword">John [i] Catesby</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1404/5)<span class="occ"></span> whose land acquisitions started its rise into the front rank of local families. There were numbers of properties in Coventry, a town with which both William and John had strong ties, but most of the new land lay in east Warwickshire or the neighbouring counties of Leicestershire and Northamptonshire, especially the latter. It came by both purchase and marriage: William to Joan, daughter and heir of William Radbourne of Radbourne, and John to Emma, daughter and heir of Robert Cranford of Ashby St Ledgers, Northamptonshire. William, possibly a <span class="occ">lawyer</span>, had a lengthy official career from 1339, notably as MP for Warwickshire and escheator for several midland counties. John, definitely a lawyer, was JP in Warwickshire almost continuously from 1377. He too was steward of Coventry, to Edward, the Black Prince, as earl of Chester, but by 1389 he was close to Thomas Beauchamp, the appellant earl of Warwick. Warwick's support was important to Catesby in the protracted but eventually successful dispute over Ladbroke Manor, Warwickshire, between 1383 and 1399 and he narrowly evaded punishment when Richard II took his revenge on the appellants in 1397&#150;9. From the time of John [i] the family divided its interests between Warwickshire and Northamptonshire. Initially there was a residence in each, at Ladbroke and Ashby respectively, but Ladbroke was eventually abandoned, probably under John [ii]. The changing balance of the estate is indicated by John [i]'s appointment as JP in Northamptonshire from 1392.<br>
<br>John's eldest son, William [ii], died in 1407 or 1408 leaving John's second son, <a name="cosubject_63895"></a><span class="headword">John [ii] Catesby</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1437)<span class="occ"></span>, as heir. This accident complicated the structure of the estate, as John [ii]'s future had already been secured by marriage to Margaret, granddaughter and heir of Richard Mountfort of Lapworth. Lapworth was in west Warwickshire, a long way from the area where the Catesbys had been so successfully building a compact estate. Some rationalization was achieved by giving peripheral manors to a third brother, Robert, founder of the line of Catesbys of Hopsford, Warwickshire, while the marriage of John [ii]'s heir, <a name="cosubject_63896"></a><span class="headword">Sir William [iii] Catesby</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1478/9)<span class="occ"></span>, to Philippa, the coheir of Bishopestone of Bishopton, Warwickshire, eventually brought lands that made the west Warwickshire estate geographically more coherent, including a second manor at Lapworth. John [ii], also a lawyer, followed his father into the service of the earls of Warwick, being retained by Richard Beauchamp, earl of Warwick, by 1417, although he seems to have been less central to the earl's affairs than some of the other Warwickshire gentry. This was perhaps because the Warwickshire&#150;Northamptonshire border was not an area where Warwick had much direct influence. In fact John [ii]'s record as local officer shows that by the accession of Henry VI he was more a Northamptonshire than a Warwickshire man and, although he did have dealings with the dense local network around Lapworth, he was a key figure in the network that ran down the Warwickshire&#150;Northamptonshire borders. If John's career was a relatively quiet one, this is a measure of his success: he contrived to avoid both political miscalculation and extended litigation.<br>
<br>William [iii] was still a minor at his father's death and was placed in the wardship of John Norreys of Berkshire, a rising member of the royal household. This was doubtless why Catesby himself was a king's esquire by 1442. By 1447&#150;8 he was linked to John Talbot, first earl of Shrewsbury; these ties with the crown and the Talbots were to be a constant in his political life until 1461, and in 1453 he married as his second wife Joan, daughter of Sir Thomas Barre and Shrewsbury's niece. In 1449 he was made KB, the first of the family to be knighted. From 1443 he also served the king in all the major local offices. That he served in Warwickshire as well as Northamptonshire shows how the balance of the family's interests was shifting back across the border, chiefly because the death of William's Bishopestone father-in-law in 1444 had increased its Warwickshire weighting. Catesby avoided involvement in local upheavals in the 1450s and never entirely cut himself off from local associates linked to the Yorkists. Thus, although he may have fought for Henry VI at Towton&#151;his uncle, Robert, did&#151;and he was attainted by the Yorkists in 1461 and briefly in exile, he was soon pardoned and able to return.<br>
<br>In the 1460s, no longer attached to the royal household, Sir William became a substantial and fairly divisive force in local politics. He found himself at odds with various local landowners, most notably with John Brome of Baddesley Clinton, another former member of the Lancastrian household, who held one of the other manors at Lapworth, to which William now laid claim. William had clearly decided to make more of his west Warwickshire lands and he even established a residence at Lapworth. As Warwick's affinity crumbled around him in the early 1460s [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/52788/', "Mountford family")</script>], the earl struck up a surprising relationship with this former Lancastrian, who may indeed have gone north with him to fight Lancastrian resistance in 1463&#150;4, and he supported him in his efforts to get Lapworth, while Brome gravitated towards the dissident group around Simon Mountford, Warwick's nominal retainer. In 1465&#150;6 Catesby's return to respectability was completed with his reappointment as JP. In 1466 the Lapworth issue was settled by an arbitration that gave him the manor. The combination of his new patron, Warwick, and his old one, Henry VI, proved irresistible at the readeption and he was sheriff of Northamptonshire during Henry VI's brief second reign. He was again pardoned after this further misadventure and, perhaps chastened by this second near disaster, seems to have lived out a quiet old age, although he died in harness as sheriff of Northamptonshire.<br>
<br>It was William's son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4884/', "William Catesby (d. 1485)")</script>, the notorious servant of Richard III, who took the family to its greatest political heights and almost to destruction. The mostly dubious land acquisitions he made in and around Northamptonshire under Richard caused him to refocus the estate back towards east Warwickshire and Northamptonshire, although he was local officer in several midland counties, including Warwickshire. His son <a name="cosubject_63898"></a><span class="headword">George Catesby</span>  (<em>c.</em>1473&#150;1505)<span class="occ"></span>, who was given livery of his mother's Zouche lands in 1495, had his attainder reversed and was partially restored in 1496. George's marriage to Richard Empson's daughter Elizabeth must have helped his cause. The family thrived during the sixteenth century, especially in the lifetime of George's second son and heir Sir Richard Catesby (<i>d</i>. 1553), who was knight of the shire for Warwickshire in 1539 and 1553, and in the 1540s served twice as sheriff of Warwickshire and Leicestershire and once as sheriff of Northamptonshire. He was knighted in 1542. The recusancy of Richard's grandson and heir Sir William Catesby (1547&#150;1598) brought financial pressure and exclusion from office, but it was only the involvement of William's son <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4883/', "Robert Catesby")</script> in the Gunpowder Plot, and his consequent forfeiture, that brought ruin upon the family.<br>
<br>Because of this confiscation, the Catesby records came into crown hands, which is why so many of them survive, although the archive was unfortunately broken up by the Public Record Office. In particular, the estate accounts are unusually good for a fifteenth-century gentry family. They reveal the Catesbys as painstaking managers and exploiters, who developed a centralized accounting and purchase system, especially as the properties became more widespread, and paid careful attention to the rentier side of the economy. But what differentiates them from most of the middling and upper gentry in the fifteenth century was their exploitation of the commercial possibilities of livestock farming well before the pastoral boom at the end of the century. They kept a flock for commercial wool production in the Warwickshire&#150;Northamptonshire region, which was later to be a major centre for sheep farming, while in the 1460s and 1470s William [iii] began to graze cattle for the market, using the lands at Lapworth, which was in good cattle-raising country. In the family's use of its estate's resources, for both consumption and sale, there was specialization and careful integration which became especially marked right across the estate under William [iii].<br>
<br>For a rising family the Catesbys were surprisingly uninterested in making new religious foundations, perhaps because they inherited chantries on at least two of their acquired estates. They contributed to a bell-tower and bells for Ladbroke church but, as their residence moved to Ashby, so did their religious interests and it seems that, from at least John [ii], it was here that family members were buried.<br>
<br>The history of the family is of steady, careful ascent, accompanied by land acquisition and by careful husbanding and exploitation of the resources of the estate. On the way, cadet branches were established at Althorp, Northamptonshire, and Marston Waver, Warwickshire, as well as the one at Hopsford. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4881/', "Sir John Catesby (d. 1487)")</script>, justice of the common pleas, may have been related to the main line of the family&#151;he was known as &#145;uncle&#146; to William (<i>d</i>. 1485)&#151;though in what degree is not known. He is almost certainly not identical with John Catesby of Althorp (<i>d</i>. 1486). Only occasionally was the family put in jeopardy by the political upheavals that could always endanger a high-profile family on the make. By the later years of William [iii] the Catesbys were a leading midland family that needed to do no more than maintain its position, and William's expert deployment of the resources of the entire estate meant that they were particularly favourably placed to do so. The inability of his son to resist the allure of still greater wealth and power in the service of Richard III, which would have been more appropriate at an earlier phase in the Catesbys' rise, was thus as foolish as it was almost disastrous. The arms of the Catesby family were argent two lions passant sable crowned or.<br>
