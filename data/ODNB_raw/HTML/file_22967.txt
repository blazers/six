<span class="headword">Quincy,  Saer  de</span>, earl of Winchester  (<em>d.</em> 1219), <span class="occ">magnate</span>, was the son of Robert de Quincy (<i>d</i>. 1197) and his wife, Orabile, daughter of Ness, son of William, lord of Leuchars in Fife. About 1190 he married Margaret (<i>d</i>. 1235), daughter of Robert de Breteuil, earl of Leicester (<i>d</i>. 1190), with whom he had five sons and three daughters. His eldest son, Robert, predeceased him in 1217, leaving only a daughter with his wife, Hawise, daughter of Hugh, earl of Chester, who was passed over in the succession to the earldom of Winchester in favour of her uncle, Saer's second son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22966/', "Roger de Quincy")</script>.<br>
<br>Quincy's career before <i>c</i>.1190 is obscure. In the 1180s and 1190s he witnessed several Scottish royal <i>acta</i> and confirmed his parents' grants to Newbattle Abbey, near Edinburgh, also making new gifts to the abbeys of Dunfermline and Cambuskenneth. Most English references to Saer de Quincy between <i>c</i>.1160 and 1192 relate to his uncle, who was one of Henry II's <i>familiares</i>, served him as castellan of Nonancourt in 1180&#150;84, and died in 1190, and his son, also named Saer, who accompanied Henry, the Young King, to the court of Louis VII of France and joined his rebellion against Henry II in 1173. This younger Saer was dead by 1192, whereupon his estates in six English counties passed to his uncle, Robert.<br>
<br>It was following his father's inheritance of these properties that Quincy entered English public life. In 1197 he was in France, and was present with Richard I at Roche d'Orval in August 1198. On Richard's death in April 1199 Quincy acknowledged John's succession. In October 1200 he was sent to escort William the Lion, king of Scots, to Lincoln, and was present at the ceremony on 22 November when William renewed his homage for his English estates. In 1202 Quincy accompanied the king's army to Normandy to confront Arthur, duke of Brittany, and his ally, Philip Augustus of France. Quittances in 1202 and 1203 of debts due to the king and to Jewish moneylenders may represent rewards for service. Quincy was appointed joint castellan with Robert Fitzwalter of the strategic Norman stronghold of Vaudreuil. In the spring of 1203 they offered no resistance to Philip and surrendered Vaudreuil, an action which earned universal contempt. John displayed his disgust by refusing to contribute to their ransom.<br>
<br>The death in 1204 of Quincy's brother-in-law, Robert de Breteuil, earl of Leicester, brought a dramatic change of fortune. Robert's heirs were his sisters Amice, wife of Simon de Montfort (<i>d</i>. by 1188), and Margaret, Quincy's wife, and until the partition of the inheritance was settled Quincy was given custody of the earldom and appears also to have exercised the office of steward of England which had been held by the earls. An equal division of the lands, ratified in 1207, was made between Quincy and Montfort. The settlement awarded the title of earl of Leicester and the office of steward to Montfort, but Quincy's enhanced status was given formal recognition by his creation as earl of Winchester. Quincy's new social position brought added political importance. In the summer of 1209 he accompanied the embassy sent to resolve the diplomatic crisis that had resulted from the Scots' demolition of the English fortification at Tweedmouth. It was probably at this time that his long-running dispute with St Andrews Cathedral priory over the patronage of the church of Leuchars was resolved. Certainly he appears to have been at his castle of Leuchars in April 1209, when he received John's protection for a vessel that he was taking from there to Lynn. In the summer of 1210 Quincy served in John's Ulster campaign. He was possibly the unnamed commander of a force sent in 1211 to assist the Scots to crush the rising of Guthred mac William in Ross. He was again in Scotland on John's business in March 1212. This period saw the peak of his career in royal service: between 1211 and 1214 he acted as a justiciar, sat as an auditor in the exchequer in 1212, and in the same year was an ambassador to John's nephew, the emperor Otto IV, whose assistance was sought against France and the papacy. On 15 May 1213 at Dover, Quincy attested John's surrender of his crown to Innocent III. Some of his men may have been involved in the naval victory at Damme on 30 May, as John later instructed delivery to Quincy of a galley captured by them in Flanders. In January 1215 he witnessed the reissue of the king's charter of ecclesiastical liberties, and on 4 March was one of the nobles who took the cross with John.<br>
<br>Despite this apparent closeness to John, Quincy had unresolved grievances concerning property of which he felt he had been unjustly deprived, most notably Mountsorrel Castle in Leicestershire, and was associated closely with the first stirrings of rebellion. He travelled to Scotland and in early April 1215 was at the court of Alexander II, where he joined an influential group urging Scottish intervention in England. Before the end of April he joined the dissident barons at his principal residence, Brackley in Northamptonshire, and marched with them to London. Quincy was named as one of the twenty-five barons chosen to enforce John's observance of the rights conceded in <span class="roman">Magna Carta</span> [<i>see also </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/93691', "Enforcers of Magna Carta")</script>]. When civil war erupted in October 1215 he and Henry de Bohun, earl of Hereford, headed a baronial embassy to France to seek French assistance and to offer the crown to Philip's son, the dauphin Louis. On 9 January 1216 he returned to England with a force of French knights, followed in May by the dauphin and his army.<br>
<br>John's unexpected death in October 1216 opened an opportunity for reconciliation between the rebels and the royalists, but Quincy maintained his allegiance to Louis. In spring 1217 Quincy learned that Ranulf, earl of Chester, was besieging Mountsorrel, and on 30 April prevailed upon Louis to send an army commanded jointly by him, Robert Fitzwalter, and Thomas, count of Perche, to its relief. They arrived at Mountsorrel to find the siege abandoned, so turned to attack the royalist-held castle at Lincoln, unaware that the royalist army was marching north in pursuit. On 20 May at Lincoln they were defeated and Quincy was taken prisoner. He played no further part in the civil war and was released only after the end of hostilities in September 1217, when letters were issued to the sheriffs of eleven counties instructing restoration of his lands. Moves were made to include former rebels in Henry III's government, and Quincy attended the Westminster council of November 1217 which conceded a new version of <span class="roman">Magna Carta</span> and granted the charter of the forest. Although he was held in high regard at the council, Quincy did not recover possession of Mountsorrel, but was compensated by the grant of the farm of Chesterton, another manor to which he had a claim. In March 1218 at Worcester he attested the settlement agreed with the rebels' former ally, Llywelyn ab Iorwerth.<br>
<br>Towards the end of December 1218 Quincy was fitting out a vessel in Galloway in preparation for his departure on crusade, and in spring 1219 he sailed for the Holy Land, in the company of his son Roger, Robert Fitzwalter, and William d'Aubigny, earl of Arundel. Soon after his arrival at the siege of Damietta he became ill, and died on 3 November 1219. In accordance with his wishes he was buried at Acre and the ashes of his internal organs returned to England for burial in Garendon Abbey, of which he was patron. His son, Roger, did homage to Henry III in 1221 and received his father's lands, but did not gain the title of earl of Winchester until his mother's death in 1235. At the time of his death Quincy was one of the most significant Anglo-Scottish landholders of his day, and possessed properties in eleven English sheriffdoms and substantial estates in Perthshire, Fife, and Lothian in Scotland. He was a noted benefactor of the church, especially the monks of Garendon Abbey and Brackley Hospital, and his generosity was further evidenced by <i>acta</i> in favour of several Scottish monasteries and a large corpus of charters to private individuals.<br>
