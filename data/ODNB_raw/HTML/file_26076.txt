<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Soyer,  Alexis Beno&icirc;t</span>  (1810&#150;1858), <span class="occ">chef</span>, was born on 4 February 1810 at Meaux-en-Brie, near Paris, the youngest of three sons of Emery Roch Alexis Soyer, a shopkeeper, and his wife, Marie Madeleine Fran&ccedil;oise, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Chamberlan; his parents were both thirty-one when he was born. He was sent to the local cathedral with the intention of becoming a priest, but he did not take to this vocation and, after ringing the cathedral bells at night, which brought out the town garrison and the fire brigade, he was expelled. In 1821 he joined his brother Philippe, a chef in Versailles, and was apprenticed as a cook. At the age of seventeen he joined a M. Douix, a restaurateur in the boulevard des Italiens, where he stayed for three years. He then went as second chef to the prince de Polignac, but left Paris in 1831 and moved to England where his brother was then chef to the duke of Cambridge. Soyer worked in several noble households, including those of the duke of Sutherland and the marquess of Waterford, and then for four years with William Lloyd of Aston Hall, near Oswestry. In 1837 he was appointed chef to the newly created Reform Club in Pall Mall. On 12 April in the same year he married, at St George's Hanover Square, Emma Jones [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26077/', "Soyer, (Elizabeth) Emma (1813&#150;1842)")</script>], an artist with a modest reputation for her portraits.<br>
<br>At the Reform Club Soyer installed modern kitchens: he was one of the first to use gas for cooking, and his culinary domain became a showplace, and the venue for a number of magnificent displays of his art. On the day of Queen Victoria's coronation, 28 June 1838, he prepared a breakfast for two thousand guests. He also prepared a massive dinner for Ibrahim Pasha at the Reform Club on 3 July 1846. In 1842 he was asked to Belgium to meet the king, and left his wife at home although she was expecting a child. Unfortunately during the few days he was away she had a miscarriage and died. Soyer was deeply distressed and never fully recovered from his grief and guilt at having left his wife alone. He became even busier in his work, producing new dishes, such as his <i>c&ocirc;telettes &agrave; la Reform</i>, and providing for private banquets. He also wrote a small book entitled <span class="italic">D&eacute;lassements culinaires</span> (1845), followed in 1846 by <span class="italic">The Gastronomic Regenerator</span>, written primarily for the grander households with a kitchen staff. Soyer was approached by the government in 1847 and asked to go to Ireland to install soup kitchens, in order to help alleviate the famine. This kind of work suited him well, and he set up a kitchen at the Royal Barracks in Dublin capable of feeding a thousand people an hour; the soup was cheap and tasty even if it did not constitute a balanced diet. On his return to London he published <span class="italic">Soyer's Charitable Cookery, or, The Poor Man's Regenerator</span> (1848), sold for 6<i>d</i>., 1<i>d</i>. being returned to the poor fund. He also continued his soup kitchens by providing for the Huguenot silk weavers of Spitalfields, who were then being affected by a treaty with France that allowed cheap imported silk into this country.<br>
<br>Soyer was never out of the public eye for long and, apart from his banquets, produced a series of kitchen gadgets that were the forerunners of many modern utensils, as well as selling a range of bottled sauces and relishes. His most ingenious production was the Magic Stove, on which food could be cooked at the table, essentially the same device used in restaurants today. This was not entirely his own invention, but he improved and marketed one that he had been shown.<br>
<br>Soyer continued to write, and his next book, <span class="italic">The Modern Housewife</span> (1849), was aimed at the middle classes. It took the form of letters between two housewives, and gave an interesting insight into domestic life of the time. In 1850 he left the Reform Club and was asked to tender for the catering at the Great Exhibition planned for the following year. He found this to be too restrictive and instead rented Gore House, now the site of the Albert Hall, where he created the Gastronomic Symposium of All Nations. This was not only a restaurant but a place of magical entertainment, the gardens being filled with fountains, statues, and replicas of the seven wonders of the world, and offering much else, including fireworks, music for dancing, and other noisy frolics. Visitors averaged a thousand a day and the food was good and affordable, but Soyer was never very skilful with accounts, and the Symposium closed with a loss of &pound;7000. Also in 1850 a young Frenchman, Alexis Lemain, wrote to Soyer claiming to be his son. Soyer had had an early liaison when a young man in Paris, and in due course he accepted Lemain as his son.<br>
<br>Shortly after the closure of the Symposium, the Admiralty, well aware of the scandals surrounding the navy rations, asked Soyer to investigate the preservation of food for long voyages. He did this with success and his recommendations were accepted. Soyer also produced at that time a scholarly work entitled <span class="italic">The Pantropheon</span> (1853), covering every aspect of food production, preparation, and history. This was in a completely different style from his previous work, and it is now known that it was not written by him, but by a Frenchman, Adolphe Duhart-Fauvet, who sold it to Soyer to translate and complete. This he did, but published it under his own name without acknowledgement to the original author. Soyer was a generous man, but craved publicity and, at that time, money, so it seems likely that, as with the Magic Stove, he considered the additions he made justified him in claiming the work as his own. <span class="italic">A Shilling Cookery for the People</span> (1855) followed, designed for the working classes. This contained basic recipes for plain dishes, boiled meats, puddings sweet and savoury, offal, and leftovers though not, oddly, many ideas for soups, the usual standby for cheap eating.<br>
<br>In 1855 reports of appalling conditions in the war in the Crimea were reaching London, and Soyer offered his service, without payment, to the government. This was accepted and he went out to Scutari to reorganize the catering in the hospitals there. His practical skills were put to good use, and he later went with Florence Nightingale to Balaklava and Sevastopol to continue the work. The field stoves he had devised before leaving London were sent out and installed in the camp kitchens. They proved so efficient and economical that the army used them, in modified form, for at least a century.<br>
<br>Soyer returned home in 1857 and published <span class="italic">A Culinary Campaign</span>, mainly about his own adventures in the Crimea and the way he simplified and improved the army catering. It contained a selection of recipes for hospital and invalid diets, as well as hearty dishes, such as salt meat, for large numbers, under the heading of &#145;Field and barrack cookery&#146;. He also wrote a pamphlet in that year, <span class="italic">Instructions to Military Cooks</span>. He was then asked to redesign the kitchens at Wellington Barracks, which were opened in July 1858.<br>
<br>Alexis Soyer was a flamboyant, warm-hearted man with a strong sense of humour and a love of practical jokes. Ingenious and inventive, with a talent for organization, he was sometimes carried away by his insatiable desire for publicity. He took his work seriously and was very much aware of those less fortunate, and tried to help when he could. He was unbusinesslike in money matters and never patented any of his inventions, so made little from them financially. He was well known and easily recognized, largely because of his unconventional appearance. Portraits show him to be of middle height, bearded, and always wearing a floppy cap, usually made of velvet, which he made his trade mark. His clothes were cut on the bias, or &#145;<i>&agrave; la zoug-zoug</i>&#146; as he called it  (Ray, 12), and designed by himself. Thackeray, an admirer and friend, used him as the model for Mirabolant in <span class="italic">Pendennis</span>. Soyer died on 5 August 1858, of a stroke, at his home, 15 Marlborough Road, St John's Wood, and was buried on 11 August at Kensal Green cemetery in the same grave as his beloved Emma.<br>
