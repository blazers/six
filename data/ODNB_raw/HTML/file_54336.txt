<span class="headword">Whitelaw,  Archibald</span>  (1415/16&#150;1498), <span class="occ">ecclesiastic and administrator</span>, was born in the second decade of the fifteenth century: in a supplication to the papacy of 5 July 1475 he described himself as in his sixtieth year of age. He entered the University of St Andrews in the 1430s and emerged as a licentiate in arts in 1439; having subsequently reappeared in Cologne as a teacher&#151;an influential one, for among his students was Duncan Bunch, later vice-chancellor of Glasgow University&#151;he returned to teach at his alma mater in the 1450s. Whitelaw's presence on the faculty of arts at St Andrews in the early 1450s may have provided him with the opportunity to come to the notice of James II, whose eldest son, the future James III, was born in St Andrews Castle (late May 1452). By 1459 Whitelaw was certainly in royal service, employed as a diplomat, to conclude a treaty with Richard, duke of York, and as tutor to the heir to the throne.<br>
<br>Whitelaw's blossoming career continued apace after James II's early death (3 August 1460). Under the regency government of the king's widow, Mary of Gueldres, he was clerk register during 1461&#150;2, and by August 1462 he was already acting as royal secretary, a post which he was to retain for an astonishing thirty-one years. During that time he was regular in attending council meetings and in witnessing royal charters. He also carried on his work as a diplomat, and in 1474 was one of the commissioners who negotiated a treaty with England. Not surprisingly, from the late 1460s onwards he held important ecclesiastical livings: the archdeaconry of Moray (1463&#150;7), the archdeaconry of Lothian (1470&#150;98), and the subdeanery of Glasgow (1482&#150;98).<br>
<br>Whitelaw was one of fifteenth-century Scotland's most notable humanists, and the surviving evidence reveals many facets of his classical scholarship&#151;as a teacher at Cologne and St Andrews; as the collector of a fine library, including volumes by Lucan, Horace, Appianus, Sallust, Asconius, and Albertus Magnus; perhaps above all as the senior diplomat on the Scottish embassy to meet Richard III at Nottingham in September 1484, when Whitelaw delivered an elegant Latin oration at the outset of negotiations for an Anglo-Scottish truce. This <span class="italic">Oratio</span>, which praises Richard III for his martial exploits in spite of his small stature, is liberally endowed with cleverly phrased references to Cicero, Statius, Virgil, Seneca, Sallust, and Livy, and has long been admired as the work of a Christian humanist. Behind the elegant rhetoric, however, lies the tough diplomatic message that the beleaguered English king needed peace more than the Scots; and, as Dunbar and Berwick were still in English hands, there may be an implied rebuke to King Richard in the statement that every prince should be content within the bounds of his own kingdom.<br>
<br>Whitelaw resigned from the secretaryship shortly before Christmas 1493, when he was already in his late seventies. In his time he had been the survivor of more political crises than any other royal servant, remaining in office both when James III was placed under constraint by his subjects in 1482&#150;3 and after that king was overthrown in 1488. He had served three kings, and he may eventually have found the rude transition from James III's static kingship in Edinburgh to the young James IV's hectic itineraries, embracing sea voyages to Dunstaffnage and pilgrimages to Whithorn and Tain, too much for him. He died, possibly at Glasgow, on 23 October 1498.<br>
<br>Whitelaw's reputation as a classical scholar and diplomat is secure, though it would probably be going much too far, on the strength of the 1484 <span class="italic">Oratio</span> alone, to suggest that he was the forerunner of those sixteenth-century writers, beginning with John Mair in 1521, who preached the virtues of Anglo-Scottish union. As a politician and a person, he remains something of an enigma. His tuition of the young James III does not seem to have made him a close familiar of the adult king; nor, so far as is known, did he exercise the influence over the king as royal secretary that Patrick Paniter was to achieve with James IV. Whitelaw was, perhaps, essentially the indispensable civil servant, at home with any administration. In any event he appears to have failed to pass on the secrets of effective royal government to his pupil James III.<br>
