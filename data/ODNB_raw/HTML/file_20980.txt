<span class="headword">Madog ap Maredudd</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1160), <span class="occ">king of Powys</span>, was the son of Maredudd ap Bleddyn ap Cynfyn (<i>d</i>. 1132) and (according to genealogical sources from the later fifteenth century onwards) Hunydd, daughter of Einudd ap Gwenllian.<h2>
<a name="Earlycareer"></a>Early career</h2>Madog succeeded his father as sole ruler of Powys on the latter's death in 1132 and sought to strengthen the kingdom not only by maintaining control over the sons of his elder brother, Gruffudd (<i>d</i>. 1128), as well as over his own younger brother, Iorwerth Goch, but also by defending its northern limits from the ambitions of the dynasty of Gwynedd and by expanding it eastwards, especially at the expense of the Normans in Shropshire. Madog married Susanna, daughter of Gruffudd ap Cynan. In 1132, shortly before Madog's accession, Cadwallon ap Gruffudd ap Cynan was killed in the commote of Nanheudwy when he led an attack on Powys. Thereafter no further hostilities from Gwynedd are recorded until 1149, when Madog's brother-in-law, Owain Gwynedd (<i>d</i>. 1170), occupied the commote of I&acirc;l and built a castle at Tomen y Rhodwydd. Towards the end of the same year Madog revealed his own capacity for territorial expansion with the capture and refortification of the Norman castle of Oswestry, while he sought to neutralize any threat to his authority from his nephews, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20981/', "Owain Cyfeiliog (d. 1197)")</script> and Meurig, sons of his brother Gruffudd ap Maredudd, by granting them the commote of Cyfeiliog (which had formed part of the kingdom of Powys since their father had occupied it in 1116). By 1151 Madog had also established his overlordship in Arwystli in central Wales, for the only surviving charter in his name, issued no later than that year (in which he is styled &#145;king of the Powysians&#146;), records that he granted land belonging to the region's ruler, Hywel ab Ieuaf, to St Michael's Church at Trefeglwys.<br>
<br>Although a force from Powys had ravaged Maelor Saesneg in 1146 until it was heavily defeated by Robert of Mold, steward of the earldom of Chester, on 3 September of that year, the renewed threat from Gwynedd in 1149 prompted Madog to ally himself with Ranulf (II), earl of Chester, whose lands were likewise the object of Owain Gwynedd's ambitions. However, a joint campaign against Owain by the king of Powys and the earl ended in victory for their adversary at Coleshill in Tegeingl in 1150, allowing the ruler of Gwynedd to maintain his possession of I&acirc;l. This set-back did not halt Madog's plans for territorial consolidation and expansion, for two years later his son, Llywelyn, killed Stephen fitz Baldwin, constable of Montgomery Castle, and the military campaigns in Shropshire and Maelienydd celebrated by the court poets Gwalchmai ap Meilyr and Cynddelw Brydydd Mawr (<i>fl</i>. 1155&#150;1195) may also have taken place in the 1150s. In 1156 Madog built a castle near Cymer in the commote of Caereinion: the precise location of this fortification is unknown although it may have been situated at Castle Caereinion, about 4 miles west of Welshpool. The Welsh chronicle <span class="italic">Brut y tywysogyon</span> also records under the same year that Madog's nephew, Meurig ap Gruffudd, escaped from prison. This event almost certainly inspired the composition of the poem <span class="italic">Hirlas Owain</span>&#151;ascribed, probably incorrectly, to Meurig's brother, Owain Cyfeiliog&#151;which describes an expedition by Owain's retinue to free his brother from captivity in the district of Maelor. Who was responsible for the imprisonment of Meurig and where precisely he was imprisoned are uncertain, although it has been suggested that he was held at the castle of Wrexham, which belonged to the earldom of Chester by 1160&#150;61. Significantly, Owain's court appears to have been situated at Welshpool by the time of this expedition, suggesting that his authority was not confined to Cyfeiliog, which had shown itself to be vulnerable to external attack when it was ravaged in 1153 by Rhys ap Gruffudd (<i>d</i>. 1197) of Deheubarth.<h2>
<a name="AscendancyinPowys"></a>Ascendancy in Powys</h2>Madog's territorial expansion owed much to the opportunities created by the weakness of the English crown and marcher lords in Shropshire during the reign of Stephen. However, after Henry II's accession to the English throne in 1154 these opportunities were severely curtailed. The following year William fitz Alan, a marcher magnate who had formerly supported the Empress Matilda, was restored to his Shropshire lands and appointed sheriff of the county, and probably soon recovered Oswestry. The ruler of Powys responded pragmatically to the changed situation by forming an alliance with Henry II in 1157. Madog may have already given support to the Angevins in 1141, for Orderic Vitalis reports that two brothers, &#145;Mariadoth&#146; and &#145;Kaladrius&#146;, fought on the Angevin side against Stephen at the battle of Lincoln in February of that year: it has been assumed that the names refer to Cadwaladr ap Gruffudd ap Cynan and his brother-in-law Madog ap Maredudd (the former is not known to have had a brother called Maredudd). What is clear is that Madog, together with his brother Iorwerth Goch and Hywel ab Ieuaf, ruler of Arwystli, joined in Henry II's successful campaign against Owain Gwynedd in the summer of 1157; the king's Welsh allies also received payments from the English exchequer in that year.<br>
<br>In the aftermath of Henry's campaign Iorwerth Goch captured and destroyed the castle of Tomen y Rhodwydd, thereby depriving Owain Gwynedd of his authority in I&acirc;l. How far Madog benefited directly from this action is unclear. The medieval Welsh prose tale, &#145;The dream of Rhonabwy&#146;, composed possibly as late as the early fourteenth century, claims that relations between Madog and his brother were strained, since Iorwerth held no lands in Powys during Madog's reign and refused an offer to serve as his brother's <i>penteulu</i> (&#145;chief of the military retinue&#146;). If true, this stands in contrast to Madog's treatment of the sons of his elder brother, Gruffudd, to whom he granted the territory of Cyfeiliog and one of whom, Owain, also possessed a court at Welshpool (although whether as a result of a grant by Madog is not known). His lack of lands in Powys could explain Iorwerth's readiness to accept the estate of Sutton near Wenlock and other Shropshire manors in serjeanty from Henry II in 1157 for performing services as Henry's latimer or interpreter. Nevertheless, in that year Iorwerth clearly co-operated with Madog, if only on the basis of common support for Henry II's campaign against Owain Gwynedd, and it is likely that his capture of Tomen y Rhodwydd met with the approval of his brother even if the expedition was undertaken independently of him and, perhaps, resulted in Iorwerth's subsequently holding I&acirc;l under Madog's overlordship.<h2>
<a name="Deathfamilyandassessment"></a>Death, family, and assessment</h2>No further events are recorded of Madog's reign until his death in 1160, which, according to the poet Gwalchmai, took place &#145;at the beginning of Lent&#146;  (Gruffydd, vol. 1, no.7, line 136), and therefore about 9 February. The version of <span class="italic">Brut y tywysogyon</span> in NL Wales, Peniarth MS 20, states that Madog died at Winchester, but the accuracy of this report has been questioned. All versions of the chronicle agree, however, that Madog was buried at the church of Meifod, Powys, a pre-Norman foundation, &#145;where his burial-place was&#146;  (<span class="italic">Brut: Peniarth MS 20</span>, 61), a statement which may be compared with Cynddelw's description of Meifod as &#145;the burial-place of kings&#146;  (Gruffydd, vol. 3, no. 3, line 48). Shortly afterwards Madog's son, Llywelyn, was killed. Described in <span class="italic">Brut y tywysogyon</span> as the one &#145;in whom lay the hope of all Powys&#146;  (<span class="italic">Brut: Peniarth MS 20</span>, 62), he was quite possibly his father's designated successor to the whole of the kingdom, and his death marked the end of unitary rule in Powys, which was divided between Madog's three remaining sons Elise, Gruffudd Maelor (<i>d</i>. 1191), and Owain Fychan (<i>d</i>. 1187), his brother Iorwerth Goch, and his nephew Owain Cyfeiliog (<i>d</i>. 1197).<br>
<br>Late medieval genealogists claimed that Madog's wife, Susanna, was the mother of two of the king's sons, Elise and Gruffudd Maelor, and she may well also have been the mother of Owain Fychan. Madog also had at least two other sons, Llywelyn (<i>d</i>. 1160) and <a href="#cosubject_20980">Owain Brogyntyn [<i>see below</i>]</a>, as well as two daughters, Gwenllian, who married Rhys ap Gruffudd of Deheubarth, and Marared, wife of Iorwerth Drwyndwn ab Owain and mother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16874/', "Llywelyn ab Iorwerth (d. 1240)")</script> of Gwynedd. The genealogists, however, name as many as nine sons and four daughters altogether, and identify two extra-marital partners as mothers of three of the former together with a fourth partner, Arianwen, daughter of Moriddig Warwyn.<br>
<br>According to the court poets Gwalchmai and Cynddelw, Madog excelled in his bravery, generosity, and appreciation of fine poetry. Gwalchmai emphasized the king's success in expanding Powys to encompass a territory extending &#145;from the summit of Plynlimon to the gates of Chester&#146;  (Gruffydd vol. 1, no. 7, line 73) and from Bangor Is-coed to the borders of Meirionnydd. Cynddelw was likewise fulsome in his praise of the victorious campaigns led by Madog and his band of warriors and also celebrated the feasts, drink, and warhorses he bestowed on poets at his court. Of the king's relations with the church very little is known: Madog authorized a grant of land to the native monastery of St Michael at Trefeglwys by 1151, and may well have made donations to his burial place of Meifod, at which a new church was consecrated to the Virgin Mary in 1156. There is no evidence, however, that he patronized any of the reformed religious orders of continental origin. The church of Meifod lay near Mathrafal, which was believed by the thirteenth century to be the chief court of the princes of Powys, and which is mentioned as the site of one of Madog's battles in a poem by Cynddelw; it is therefore possible, but by no means certain, that Mathrafal was the king's principal centre of authority. According to the &#145;Dream of Rhonabwy&#146;, Madog ruled all of Powys &#145;from Pulford [just south of Chester] to Gwafan in the uppermost part of Arwystli&#146;  (<span class="italic">Breudwyt Ronabwy</span>, 1), and modern scholars are agreed that he was one of the most powerful native rulers of twelfth-century Wales whose greatest achievement was the expansion and consolidation of his ancestral kingdom. However, this achievement barely outlasted his own lifetime and his failure to ensure a unitary succession meant that Madog was also the last Welsh ruler whose authority encompassed the whole of Powys.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_20980"></a><span class="headword">Owain Brogyntyn</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1160&#150;1215)<span class="occ"></span>, referred to in contemporary sources as &#145;Oenus de Porchinton&#146; (or various spellings thereof), was an illegitimate son of Madog ap Maredudd who took his name from Porkington, a village near Oswestry which by the sixteenth century was known in Welsh as Brogyntyn. Later genealogical sources state that Owain's mother was a daughter of the Black Reeve of Rug in Edeirnion. After the death of his father and half-brother, Llywelyn, in 1160 Owain inherited lands and authority in Dinmael, Edeirnion, and Penllyn. From 1160 to 1169 he received regular and substantial payments from the English exchequer, indicating that he maintained the <i>rapprochement</i> with Henry II begun by his father and other kinsmen in 1157. Owain was a benefactor of three Cistercian monasteries. From his lordship in Penllyn he granted lands, pasture rights, and Tegid (Bala) Lake to Basingwerk Abbey; in addition, he granted lands to Valle Crucis Abbey in 1207 and made two sales of land to Strata Marcella Abbey. Owain had five sons, Gruffudd, Bleddyn, Iorwerth, Cadwgan, and Hywel, and later genealogical sources also name a daughter, Efa. The identity of their mother is uncertain: the genealogists identify her as either Sioned, daughter of Hywel ap Madog ab Idnerth, or Marared, daughter of Einion ap Seisyll of Mathafarn. Owain probably died between 1215, when he witnessed a charter in favour of Strata Marcella, and 1218, when his son, Bleddyn, submitted to Henry III. The suggestion that the inscribed graveslab at Valle Crucis Abbey bearing the name of Owain ap Madog is that of Owain Brogyntyn cannot be accepted, since the style of the stone dates it to the late thirteenth century. In the later middle ages Owain's descendants continued to exercise rights of lordship in Dinmael and Edeirnion, which they held after the Edwardian conquest by the tenure known as <i>pennaeth</i> or Welsh barony.<br>
