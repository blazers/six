</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Bagot, Sir  William</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1407), <span class="occ">administrator</span>, came from a Staffordshire family, and was perhaps a younger brother of Sir John Bagot of Blithfield. He established himself as a landowner in Warwickshire by purchasing Baginton and two other manors in the 1380s, and by leasing Morehall from Stoneleigh Abbey. He also built up landed interests in Cheshire, in part by using a contrived pedigree. His wife, Margaret (<i>d</i>. 1417), was the sister and heir of Robert Whatton of Nottinghamshire, but she may not have come into her inheritance until after Bagot's death.<br>
<br>Bagot owed his early political rise and growing influence in Warwickshire largely to the patronage of Thomas Beauchamp, earl of Warwick (<i>d</i>. 1401), and in 1377 he was admitted with the earl to the confraternity of St Albans Abbey. However, he was also retained by John of Gaunt, duke of Lancaster (<i>d</i>. 1399), from before 1379, and when in 1384 he began a long dispute with one of Warwick's legal advisers, both Gaunt and Warwick arbitrated between them. While Gaunt was in Spain in 1386 Bagot became attached to his son, Henry Bolingbroke, earl of Derby (the future Henry IV), from whom he received livery. He had also formed a close relationship with the Mowbray earls of Nottingham. Before 1383 John (IV) Mowbray granted him for life the manor of Crick, Northamptonshire, worth &pound;20 per annum, and he also enjoyed the lifelong confidence of Earl Thomas (<i>d</i>. 1399). Bagot was probably instrumental in persuading these young lords, Bolingbroke and Mowbray, to join the older lords appellant (Gloucester, Arundel, and Warwick) in their attack on Richard II's favourites in December 1387, and the first of the eleven parliaments in which he represented Warwickshire was the Merciless Parliament of February 1388. Nevertheless, the king soon set about cultivating his support. He granted him the lordship of Middlewich, Cheshire, in 1389, and the keeping of Caernarfon Castle in 1390, and further signs of favour included valuable wardships and the stewardship of the manor of Cheylesmore, situated in the area of Warwickshire where Bagot was increasingly dominant.<br>
<br>A supreme opportunist, Bagot now allied himself more closely with the younger former appellants rather than with Warwick, who in 1391 brought a lawsuit against him for land at Walsall. He did not need to look to aristocratic influence to secure repeated election to parliament, and there were few who dared challenge his local interests. He emerged unscathed in 1395 when his disputes with the authorities at Coventry provoked an uprising, confounding an attempt to bring him to justice at the assizes at Warwick in 1396 by arrogantly riding into town at the head of his armed retainers. Indicted of several crimes, including homicide and maintenance, he was tried in king's bench but eventually acquitted. Bagot continued to serve Mowbray as his chief steward, general attorney, and lieutenant at the Marshalsea, and was named as his executor. Similarly, he preserved good relations with Bolingbroke, despite serious discrepancies in his accounts (for which he was temporarily imprisoned in Kenilworth Castle). He was still being paid as a member of Bolingbroke's entourage in June 1397.<br>
<br>In July 1397, when Gloucester, Arundel, and Warwick were arrested on Richard II's orders, Bagot was instructed to take possession of Warwick's goods, and in August the king granted him the substantial life annuity of &pound;60. In the parliament assembled a month later he joined the speaker, Sir John Bussy (<i>d</i>. 1399), and Sir Henry Green, in formally requesting the annulment of the charters of pardon previously granted to the appellants, thus driving Richard's policies through the house. On 22 September, the day after Arundel's execution, he was appointed steward of the earl's confiscated lordships in the Welsh marches and constable of his castle at Holt. Furthermore, he was assigned a prominent place on the king's council to induce recalcitrants to pay fines. The subsequent quarrel between Mowbray and Bolingbroke cast doubt about where Bagot's loyalties lay. To dispel allegations of his involvement in a plot against Bolingbroke and his father, in March 1398 he entered bonds for &pound;1000, payable in the event of his ever seeking to disinherit Gaunt or his progeny, and insisted that if he was ever proved party to the murder of one of them he should immediately be put to death without trial. In September Richard II lodged at Bagot's home, conveniently sited near Coventry where the duel between Mowbray and Bolingbroke was planned to take place, and in March 1399, following their exile, he retained Bagot as a councillor with a fee of &pound;100 per annum.<br>
<br>When Richard II sailed for Ireland that spring Bagot was left behind with Bussy and Green to assist the duke of York in administering the kingdom. On receiving news of Bolingbroke's landing in Yorkshire they advised the removal of the government to St Albans, and safeguarded the queen at Wallingford Castle. Bagot raised 140 men to resist Bolingbroke, but retreated to Bristol at his approach, and although Bussy and Green were seized and executed he managed to escape by sea. Captured in Ireland, he was imprisoned in Knaresborough Castle and then in Newgate, before being sent on 16 October before the first parliament summoned by Henry IV. Bagot successfully defended himself against charges of plotting to kill Gaunt, and established through witnesses that during Henry's exile he had sent him intelligence about Richard II's plans, warning him of the confiscation of his Lancastrian inheritance. He staunchly defended Mowbray's reputation by exonerating him from any responsibility for the death of the duke of Gloucester. Henry showed leniency towards him by authorizing payment of an annuity of &pound;100, although, wary of arousing popular feeling through any swift expression of clemency, he kept him incarcerated in the Tower of London for a year. Bagot was loosed from his chains in April 1400, and released seven months later. The Commons of February 1401 successfully petitioned for his restoration to law and property on the grounds that he had been falsely accused. Bagot again represented Warwickshire in parliament in 1402. He died on 6 September 1407 and was buried at Baginton church. The brass on his tomb showed him wearing the SS collar of Lancaster. About 1399 he had arranged the marriage of his only surviving child, Isabel, to Thomas Stafford, the nephew and heir of the chancellor, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26201/', "Edmund Stafford")</script>, bishop of Exeter (<i>d</i>. 1419). When she failed to bear children his estates were sold.<br>
