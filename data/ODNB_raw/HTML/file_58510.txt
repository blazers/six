<span class="headword">Lane,  George</span>, first Viscount Lanesborough  (1620&#150;1683), <span class="occ">political administrator and politician</span>, was born on 25 December 1620, the son of Sir Richard Lane, first baronet (<i>d</i>. 1668), of Tulske, co. Roscommon, and his second wife, Mabel, daughter and sole heir of Gerald Fitzgerald of Donore, co. Kildare. His grandfather George Lane had first gone to Ireland during the wars in Queen Elizabeth I's reign. In return for his services he was granted lands in counties Longford and Roscommon which provided the nucleus of the holdings subsequently enlarged by his successors. George Lane was admitted to Trinity College, Dublin, in 1638. Four years later he waited on Charles I at Oxford. By what means he came to the notice of the duke of Ormond, the king's lord lieutenant in Ireland, is unknown. However, probably by the spring of 1643 and certainly by 1644 he was acting as Ormond's secretary. In that capacity he was privy to the tortuous negotiations with the confederate Catholics in Kilkenny, the royal court in Oxford, and the Westminster parliament. With his fortunes so firmly linked to those of Ormond, Lane followed him into continental exile in 1650. Because of his intimacy with the duke, Lane was himself regarded as influential, not least because he could introduce suitors or their petitions to his master. <br>
<br>Richard Lane was connected through his mother, an O'Farrell, with a leading Catholic sept of the Irish midlands. His son, George, through his Fitzgerald mother, was part of an extensive kindred, much of which had remained Catholic. In addition, the Lanes, thanks to kinship and neighbourhood, traditionally looked to the Burkes, earls of Clanricarde, as their principal patrons in the region. In 1650 Ormond, when he quit Ireland, named the Catholic Clanricarde as his deputy. In turn, Richard Lane, mindful of his commission as sheriff of Roscommon in 1651, obeyed Clanricarde's orders and demolished his castle at Tulske. Earlier, in the 1640s, having handed Tulske to Lord Ranelagh, he had soldiered in Galway with Clanricarde. These continuing royalist affiliations meant that he was liable to forfeit much of his property. On 4 July 1656 the commissioners sitting at Loughreagh allowed him a third of what he had formerly enjoyed, but it was to be set out in a different barony of Roscommon. Somehow he eked out a penurious existence with others in similar straits. Some of the Lanes' relations, especially the O'Farrells, moved to the continent. There they entreated Secretary George Lane to intercede for them. Much of this period George spent in Paris and northern France, moving eventually with the court and Ormond to Brussels. Other than to act as a conduit through which those uprooted from the midlands could direct their requests, it is difficult to detect any distinctive stance adopted by Lane. As befitted the trusted secretary, he modestly performed the duties of amanuensis and mouthpiece. His abilities led to his employment as secretary to the king's council. In the intimate world of the exiles he built up understandings with Edward Hyde, future earl of Clarendon, and Edward Nicholas which would later prove useful. Richard Talbot, whom he first encountered in exile, would subsequently use Lane as an intermediary to overcome misunderstandings with Ormond. <br>
<br>Charles II's restoration brightened Lane's prospects. First in England and then, from July 1662, in Ireland, where Ormond had reoccupied the lord lieutenancy, Lane was inundated with business. Much of it related to the general settlement of Ireland and the Ormonds' tangled affairs. However, he did not neglect the opportunities to advance himself and his own. His father's sacrifices in the Stuart cause were recognized when, on 11 February 1661, he was created a baronet. Sir Richard Lane was chosen by the gentry of Roscommon to represent what they had suffered through transplantation. He sought for himself the collectorship of crown rents in counties Galway, Mayo, and Roscommon. In August 1662 a royal letter promised to restore the elder Lane to what he had lost. The younger Lane had already been knighted by the king in 1657 and granted the prestigious posts of clerk to the English privy council (in 1656), clerk of the Irish parliament, and protonotary and clerk of the crown in Ireland towards the end of the interregnum. After 1660 he enjoyed the salary, perquisites, and status which went with these posts. In 1662 he was returned, at a by-election, to the Irish House of Commons as knight of the shire for Roscommon. In the same year the Irish parliament granted him &pound;2000 in recognition of his recent services and past sufferings. Under his long-time master, Ormond, he thrived. <br>
<br>In September 1664 Lane was permitted to surrender his clerkship in England (he sold it to another Irish protestant, Robert Southwell) so that he could concentrate on Irish business. In 1663 he was made secretary to the council of war in Ireland and keeper of the public records stored in the Bermingham Tower of Dublin Castle. The latter was a sensitive post, so much so that in 1669 Lane was accused of removing documents without proper authority. In November 1664 he was sworn of the Irish privy council. More solid still was the special provision made for him in the land settlement&#151;generosity which later was criticized. In addition to his estates in the midlands he acquired at least another 8615 acres scattered across five counties. At Rathcline in co. Longford he erected and furnished a mansion of considerable grandeur. Of necessity, with his official duties, much of his time was passed in Dublin. He was much concerned with framing and executing the land settlement. It gave him ample opportunity for personal profit and earned him a reputation for venality. In Dublin, too, he had added considerably to his holdings, and dwelt in a substantial house. So closely was he identified with Ormond that the latter's dismissal in 1669 reduced Lane's power. Ormond's successor sought to suppress the secretaryship of war. By 1674 the post, which some had contended was an unprecedented one, was being treated simply as secretaryship of state for Ireland. As late as 1676 Lane was bargaining over the terms on which he would lay it down. A pension for his son and a viscountcy&#151;of Lanesborough&#151;for himself were the prices. Ormond later claimed that he had bestirred himself to obtain this honour for Lane in 1676. Unfortunately the viscountcy did not satisfy his former secretary, who wanted to be advanced to an earldom. Such grandiloquent hopes were not to be fulfilled. The Lanes' revenues, notwithstanding the recent supplements, yielded no more than &pound;2000&#150;3000 p.a., which by conventional reckoning could not support an earldom. Ormond, in advising thus, incurred Lane's enmity. Lane was left out of the civil establishment in 1683, an affront alleged to have hastened his death later that year. In vain Ormond had sought to reassure him &#145;that I have all the value and affection for him that a man can have for such a friend as he would trust his life and honour with&#146;  (Ormond to Arran, 9 June 1683, <span class="italic">Ormonde MSS</span>, 7.41). <br>
<br>Lane married three times. The brides indicated his progress from provincial Ireland into the noble society of Restoration England. His first wife was Dorcas, second daughter of Sir Anthony Brabazon, brother of the first earl of Meath. Possibly this match was contracted about April 1638 when Richard Lane entailed property on his heir. The Brabazons had origins in Ireland similar to those of the Lanes. Next, in March 1655, he married Susanna (<i>b</i>. 1627), a daughter of his colleague in exile the English secretary, Sir Edward Nicholas. After her death on 18 July 1671, he married Lady Frances Sackville, daughter of the earl of Dorset, with whose family the Orrerys had also recently allied. <br>
<br>On his estates around Rathcline and in the nearby borough of Lanesborough, Lane endeavoured to create English and protestant communities. In 1677 he was enlarging the protestant church there. The little that he had accomplished would be largely destroyed during the Williamite wars. Through lineage and connection he remained close to the formerly dominant Irish Catholic families of the area, notably the Nangles and O'Farrells. In addition, despite his devotion to the house of Ormond, he prided himself on his relationship to the Burkes and Fitzgeralds. But such links with Catholic Ireland did not prevent Lane from being reviled for obstructing the dispossessed when they sought reinstatement in the 1660s. To other critics his own personal rewards and his intimacies in Gaelic and Catholic Ireland exemplified what was thought to be wrong with Ormond's lax Irish administration. He died at Lanesborough on 11 December 1683.<br>
