<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Wetherell, Sir  Charles</span>  (1770&#150;1846), <span class="occ">politician and lawyer</span>, was born in Oxford, the third son of Nathan Wetherell (<i>d</i>. 1806), dean of Hereford and master of University College, Oxford, and his wife, Ricarda, daughter of Alexander Croke of Studley Priory, Oxfordshire. He went to St Paul's School in 1783, and University College, Oxford, in 1786. From 1788 to 1791 he held a demyship at Magdalen College, Oxford. He graduated BA on 2 June 1790 and MA on 9 July 1793. In accordance with his father's wish he entered the Inner Temple on 15 April 1790 and was called to the bar on 4 July 1794. Under the patronage of Lord Eldon, a friend of his father, he developed an important equity practice, appearing in chancery, and before the privy council, the House of Lords, and parliamentary committees. He was appointed KC in 1816. He became bencher of his inn in 1816 and treasurer in 1825. Piqued that he had not received high legal office and determined to draw attention to his abilities, in 1817 he defended James Watson, charged with high treason after the Spa Fields riots. Wetherell presented an able and vigorous defence and, despite being a tory, denounced the methods used by the tory government in the affair. After Watson was found not guilty, charges against other defendants were dropped, and the episode did nothing to advance Wetherell's career.<br>
<br>Wetherell was MP for Rye from 1812 to 1813, Shaftesbury from 1813 to 1818, Oxford from 1820 to 1826, Hastings in 1826, Plympton Erle in Devon from 1826 to 1830, and Boroughbridge in Yorkshire from 1830 to 1832. He was &#145;treated by both sides as a whimsical pedant rather than a formidable debater&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 428). He vehemently opposed almost every reform which came before the house, especially Roman Catholic emancipation and parliamentary, municipal, and university reform. He was knighted on 10 March 1824. He finally achieved high office, being appointed solicitor-general on 31 January 1824 and attorney-general in September 1826. He resigned while Canning was in office, but was reappointed in 1828 under the duke of Wellington until his intemperate opposition to Roman Catholic emancipation led to his dismissal. Thereafter he became a bitter opponent of the Wellington and whig administrations.<br>
<br>It was Wetherell's appearance in Bristol which provoked the reform riots there in 1831. As recorder of Bristol he went there on 29 October 1831 to open the assizes, in spite of warnings to stay away. He had been jeered when he came to the city in March 1831 and the recently formed Bristol Political Union publicized his impending arrival in October. He was castigated for his personal opposition to reform and for misrepresenting local opinion, which, despite his assertions in the house, strongly favoured reform. Attempts in late October to enlist the support of Bristol sailors for Wetherell under cover of a declaration of loyalty to the king failed; the sailors declared for the king but resolved not to be &#145;the cat's paw of the Corporation or its agents&#146;  (Harrison, 83). Therein lay the heart of the problem: not only was Wetherell a hated opponent of parliamentary reform, but, as recorder, he was <i>ex officio</i> alderman of the common council which was despised by virtually all Bristolians. Despite all this he refused to stay away, perhaps remembering that the corporation had tried unsuccessfully to prevent Bristolians who shared his anti-catholicism turning out to welcome him in April 1829. In 1831 Wetherell simply repeated the warnings to the home secretary and attempted to carry on as normal. On arrival he was jeered and stoned and, after seeking refuge in the mansion house, made an inglorious exit over the roof and in disguise fled the city. The ensuing riot in the city, the worst reform riot in the country, lasted three days and involved spectacular loss of life and destruction of property. In the sacking of the mansion house Wetherell's wig and robe were sought out for destruction and it was even suggested that the authorities burn an effigy of him to assuage the anger of the crowd.<br>
<br>Compared with the treatment which the mayor, Charles Pinney, and the commander of the troops, Thomas Brereton, subsequently received, Wetherell escaped remarkably lightly. He continued as recorder until his death and returned to practice. Wetherell was twice married: first on 28 December 1826 to his cousin, Jane Sarah Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1831), second daughter of Sir Alexander Croke of Studley Priory; and second on 27 November 1838 to Harriet Elizabeth, second daughter of Colonel Francis Warneford of Warneford Place, Wiltshire. Wetherell died on 17 August 1846 at Preston Hall, Kent, after being injured in a carriage accident on 10 August. He was buried in Temple Church on 25 August. He had no surviving children from either marriage. With the fortune he had inherited on his father's death in 1807 and that he acquired himself he left more than &pound;200,000 personalty and a considerable amount of land. With fine irony given his role in the Bristol riot, a statue of him was erected at Clifton, Bristol, in 1839.<br>
