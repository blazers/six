<span class="headword">Torrens, Sir  Arthur Wellesley</span>  (1809&#150;1855), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, second son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27563/', "Major-General Sir Henry Torrens (1779&#150;1828)")</script> and his wife, Sarah (<i>c</i>.1781&#150;1863), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21590/', "Robert Patton")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21589/', "Patton, Philip")</script>], governor of St Helena, was born on 18 August 1809, and was a godson of the duke of Wellington. In 1819 he was appointed a page of honour to the prince regent. After attending the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, he was commissioned ensign in the Grenadier Guards and lieutenant on 14 April 1825. He was appointed adjutant of the 2nd battalion with the temporary rank of captain on 11 June 1829. He was promoted lieutenant in the Grenadier Guards and captain on 12 June 1830. He continued to serve as adjutant of his battalion until 1838, when he was appointed brigade major at Quebec on the staff of Major-General Sir James Macdonell, commanding a brigade in Canada, and took part in the operations against the rebels in late 1838. He was promoted captain in the grenadiers and lieutenant-colonel on 11 September 1840, when he returned to England.<br>
<br>Torrens exchanged into the 23rd Royal Welch Fusiliers, and obtained the command on 15 October 1841. On the augmentation of the army in April 1842 a second battalion was given to the regiment. The depot was moved from Carlisle to Chichester, where, with two new companies, it was organized for foreign service under Torrens, who embarked with it at Portsmouth for Canada on 13 May, arriving at Montreal on 30 June. In September 1843 he went, in command of the 1st battalion, from Quebec to the West Indies, arriving at Barbados in October 1843. The battalion was moved from time to time from one island to another, but for two and a half years Torrens commanded the troops in St Lucia and administered the civil government of that island. The sanitary measures he adopted to preserve the troops' health met with unprecedented success, and were considered so admirable that correspondence on the subject was published in November 1847 by order of the duke of Wellington, commander-in-chief, for the guidance of officers commanding overseas. Torrens declined the offer of the lieutenant-governorship of St Lucia as a permanent appointment, preferring to continue his service in the Royal Welch Fusiliers.<br>
<br>Torrens sailed with his battalion from Barbados in March 1847, arriving at Halifax, Nova Scotia, in April. The battalion returned to England in September 1848; it was initially stationed at Winchester, and from 1850 at Plymouth. In 1851 Torrens relinquished the command, and in 1852 published <span class="italic">Notes on French infantry and memoranda on the review of the army in Paris at the Feast of Eagles in May 1852</span>. On 1 January 1853 he was appointed assistant quartermaster-general at the Horse Guards, and became a member of a commission which in the spring of that year investigated the organization of the French, Austrian, and Prussian armies.<br>
<br>On his return Torrens was nominated a brigadier-general to command an infantry brigade in the British army in Turkey in the war with Russia. He joined the 4th division under Sir George Cathcart at Varna just before its embarkation for the Crimea. He was at the head of his brigade at the battles of the Alma and of Balaklava, where he was engaged in support of the cavalry and lost some men in recapturing two redoubts. On the morning of 5 November 1854 he had just returned from the trenches when he was told of the enemy's attack from the valley of Inkerman, and, under the direction of Cathcart, he attacked with success the left flank of the Russians, his horse falling under him, pierced by five bullets. Just before Cathcart was struck down by his mortal wound he called out, &#145;Nobly done, Torrens!&#146; Torrens was still in front, cheering on his men, when he was struck by a bullet, which passed through his body, injured a lung, splintered a rib, and was found lodged in his greatcoat. He was invalided home. He received the thanks of parliament, was promoted a major-general for distinguished service in the field on 12 December 1854, and was made a KCB, military division.<br>
<br>On 2 April 1855 Torrens was appointed deputy quartermaster-general at headquarters, and on 25 June the same year was sent as a major-general on the staff to Paris as British military commissioner. His health, enfeebled by his wound, broke down, and he died in Paris on 24 August 1855; he was buried in the cemetery of P&egrave;re Lachaise. His widow, Maria Jane, youngest daughter of General John Murray, whom he had married in 1832, erected a monument to him in St Paul's Cathedral.<br>
