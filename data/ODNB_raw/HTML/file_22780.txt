<span class="headword">Pridden,  John</span>  (1758&#150;1825), <span class="occ">antiquary and architect</span>, was born on 3 January 1758 in London, the eldest son of John Pridden (1728&#150;1807), bookseller, and his wife, Anne (<i>d</i>. 1801), daughter of Humphrey Gregory of Twemloves, near Whitchurch, Shropshire. His father was born on 20 July 1728 at Old Martin Hall, near Ellesmere, Shropshire, of wealthy parents and ran away from home to escape a cruel stepfather. In London in 1748 he worked for booksellers John Nourse in the Strand and then Richard Manby, in Ludgate Hill, whom he eventually succeeded, and was friends with many well-known authors and antiquaries.<br>
<br>Pridden entered St Paul's School, London, on 3 August 1764 at the age of six, and matriculated at Queen's College, Oxford, on 15 April 1777 at the age of nineteen. In 1778 he gained the Pauline exhibition which, together with as many other exhibitions as he could obtain from the London livery companies, almost paid for his university education. During vacations he made numerous walking tours, visiting every cathedral and many other historic towns and filling sketchbooks with accurate drawings of what he considered worth preserving. He graduated BA in 1781 and was ordained soon afterwards.<br>
<br>In 1782 Pridden became an afternoon lecturer at Tavistock Chapel, London, and, in November of the same year, a minor canon of St Paul's Cathedral. In Essex, he was vicar of Heybridge, near Maldon, from July 1783, and of Little Wakering from 1788. On 4 September 1787 at St Bride's, Fleet Street, he married Anne (<i>d</i>. 1815), eldest daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20118/', "John Nichols (1745&#150;1826)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/63494/', "Nichols family (per. c.1760&#150;1939)")</script>], the compiler and editor, and his first wife, Anne Cradock. He was elected a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries in 1785 and contributed many illustrations, particularly of the Leicestershire collections of his father-in-law, and <span class="italic">An Appendix to the History of Reculver and Herne</span> (1787) to Nichols's <span class="italic">Bibliotheca Topographica Britannica</span>. From 1783 until 1803, he was also curate of St Bride's, Fleet Street, where the vicar was non-resident, and in 1789 was incorporated MA at St John's College, Cambridge, and became chaplain to Earl Paulet. In 1795 he was appointed both priest-in-ordinary of his majesty's Chapel Royal and a minor canon of Westminster Abbey.<br>
<br>With Dr John Coakley Lettsom, the successful Quaker physician and philanthropist, Pridden was co-founder in 1791 and for many years honorary secretary of the Sea-bathing Infirmary at Margate, Kent. He designed the buildings erected in 1796 which included &#145;provision for patients to sleep on verandahs in the open air, a thing previously unheard of in hospital architecture&#146;  (Abraham, 286). He resigned his Essex livings in 1797 on becoming vicar of Caddington, Bedfordshire, where, acting as his own surveyor and architect, he rebuilt the vicarage in 1812 (dem. 1970). He was finally rector of the united parishes of St George's, Botolph Lane, and St Botolph without Bishopsgate, London, from 1812 until his death.<br>
<br>Pridden's extensive knowledge of architecture and interest in civil engineering found expression in a complex scheme which he submitted to the corporation of London to connect the tops of Snow Hill and Holborn Hill by a bridge spanning a projected road linking Blackfriars and the Great North Road. Though considered prohibitively expensive at the time, the project was eventually realized as the Holborn Viaduct. In 1811 he proposed a more effective method for draining the fens at the Bedford Level.<br>
<br>Pridden's greatest antiquarian achievement, assisted by John Calder, was the continuation of the index and glossary, begun by Archdeacon John Strachey, to the <span class="italic">Rolls of Parliament</span>. &#145;This laborious task &hellip; occupied the last 30 years of his life, broke down his health, and embittered his existence&#146;  (Nichols, <span class="italic">Illustrations</span>, 8.677). It was completed after 1825 by Edward Upham and published in 1832.<br>
<br>Pridden's wife died in 1815; he later married Anne (<i>d</i>. 1847), eldest daughter of Robert Pickwoad of London. He died at the age of sixty-seven on 5 April 1825 at his house in Fleet Street and was buried on 12 April at St Mary's, Islington, beside his first wife. There were no children.<br>
