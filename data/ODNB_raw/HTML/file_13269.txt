<span class="headword">Hill,  Arthur</span>  (1601&#150;1663), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was the second son of Sir Moses (Moyses) Hill (<i>d</i>. 1630). His mother was probably Sir Moses' second wife, Anne Stafford (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Grogan), widow of Sir Francis Stafford, but may have been his father's first wife, Alice MacDonnell. Moses Hill, perhaps of London origins, had served as a soldier in Ireland from 1573 and secured property by grant, purchase, and lease in counties Antrim, Down, and Louth.<br>
<br>By 1630 Arthur Hill had married his first wife, probably Anne Bolton (1603&#150;1636/7), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2805/', "Sir Richard Bolton")</script>, future lord chancellor of Ireland; they had three sons. Hill appears to have practised law in the 1630s, secured a Dublin residence and, besides the portion of his father's lands which he inherited, set about building a landed base of his own, largely through offering mortgages to indebted Ulster landowners. Having become sheriff of co. Antrim in 1634, he was returned to the 1634 Irish parliament at a by-election, perhaps for Belfast, and was elected for Carysfort, co. Wicklow, in 1640. He was added to the commission of the peace for co. Antrim in 1640 and in that year received a command in the earl of Strafford's &#145;new army&#146;, raised to be used against the covenanters in Scotland. Hill's second marriage was to Mary (or Anne), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21476/', "Sir William Parsons")</script>, lord justice from 1641, and they had three sons and four daughters.<br>
<br>With the outbreak of the Irish rising of 1641, Hill became one of the leaders of the protestant, pro-government forces in east Ulster and was given command of a cavalry regiment. In late 1642 he was one of a delegation of officers who travelled to England to plead with the two armed camps of king and parliament for aid in the Irish war lest they be forced to a truce with the confederate Catholic forces. In fact such a cessation came to pass in 1643 with royal approval, though Hill was soon persuaded of the merits of seeking supplies from the English parliament, which was committed to a policy of reopening the war. He was not, however, a supporter of parliament's solemn league and covenant and in April 1644 was one of the officers of English extraction willing to issue a proclamation, drafted by the king's government in Dublin, directed against the bond, despite its appeal in Ulster, particularly to the Scottish population there. By the early summer his commitment to renewed campaigning won out and he returned to England to seek logistical support for an Irish war to be explicitly conducted under parliament's aegis.<br>
<br>Hill retained his command and managed to accommodate himself to the successive Commonwealth regimes of the 1650s. He secured a number of local offices including that of a revenue commissioner for the Belfast precinct and a surveyor of confiscated lands in Ulster. In 1654 he was elected to the united protectorate parliament for the combined counties Antrim, Down, and Armagh and in 1656 he served as an auditor-general for Irish accounts. His activities endeared him neither to the Scottish nor the presbyterian populations of Ulster. In 1653 he was involved in the scheme to transplant Scottish landowners from Ulster to Tipperary. He secured the odium of presbyterian clergy as a commissioner to enforce the engagement of loyalty to the republic in 1651 and for investigating those who had failed to offer thanks for the delivery of the lord protector in 1657. Yet his own religious position was out of keeping with that favoured by English regimes. He sheltered the deposed bishop of Down and Connor, Henry Leslie, who preached and possibly ordained under his protection, while the future bishop of that diocese, Jeremy Taylor, who lived nearby, noted that Hill's home was one where the outlawed <span class="roman">Book of Common Prayer</span> was &#145;greatly valued and diligently used&#146;  (Bolton, 28). The death of Hill's elder brother, Peter, and of Peter's son Francis saw him gain the bulk of his father's pre-war properties, while the state rewarded him with further grants. In 1651 he invited Robert Child to his Ulster estate; Child remained there until his death in 1654, investigating local natural history and recording enthusiasm for agricultural improvement in the area.<br>
<br>With the collapse of the Commonwealth, Hill was reckoned to have &#145;hastened to join once more the ascendant party&#146;  (Reid, 2.255). Perhaps as early as 1659 he was associating with those who supported the return of Charles II, and by early 1660 he was noted as one who could provide armed support for an unconditional restoration. He represented County Down in the 1660 Irish convention and in the parliament elected in 1661, and secured membership of the Irish privy council. He received a pardon at Charles's return and his property was again confirmed to him. Hillsborough, where he had erected a fort, rebuilt the church and established a settlement, was made a corporate town and parliamentary borough in 1662, and he was appointed constable of the strategically located castle. He died in April 1663, his son and heir, Moyses, further uniting the Hill family properties through a marriage to his cousin Anne Hill of Hillhall.<br>
<br>Hill had steered close to the prevailing party in power, while retaining a commitment to the &#145;English interest&#146; and to the Church of Ireland. His legacy was that of laying the &#145;real basis of the landed wealth of the family&#146;  (Gillespie, 140), his descendants, the marquesses of Downshire, going on to be among the most substantial and politically potent landowning families in Ireland.<br>
