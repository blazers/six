<span class="headword">Urwick,  Lyndall Fownes</span>  (1891&#150;1983), <span class="occ">management consultant</span>, was born on 3 March 1891 at Northwood, north Malvern, Leigh, Worcestershire, the only child of Henry Urwick (1859&#150;1931) and his wife, Annis (1862&#150;1948), daughter of Elias Lyndall Whitby (1833&#150;1911), glove manufacturer and leather dresser of Yeovil. His father was a partner in the Malvern and Worcester glove-making firm of Fownes Brothers, which had been founded by an ancestor in 1777; as a Liberal Party fund-raiser he was knighted in 1915. Through his mother Lyndall Urwick was first cousin of Sir Lionel Whitby.<br>
<br>Initially schooled locally in Malvern, Urwick went on to Boxgrove School, Guildford, and then to Repton School, from where he gained an open history exhibition to New College, Oxford, in 1910. After graduating he joined Fownes Brothers in 1913 and was a partner between 1916 and 1920. Having volunteered for military service in 1914, he became an administrative staff officer and reached the rank of major in 1918, when he received the MC and was appointed OBE. He afterwards felt that he had survived the trenches for a purpose, and was disappointed when other people did not recognize this. While serving in Belgium he read <span class="italic">Shop Management</span> (1903) by Frederick W. Taylor, the American who first systematically formulated and applied the principles of scientific management. Although Urwick had reservations about the ruthless application of Taylor's ideas in Britain, he became the leading European proponent of Taylorism, and was ultimately its historian. Later he was employers' secretary of the joint industrial council of the glove-making industry (1919&#150;20) and a volunteer with the Schools and Services Co-operative Supply Association; he also joined the National Institute of Industrial Psychology.<br>
<br>In 1922 Urwick was recruited by Seebohm Rowntree to improve the organization of Rowntree's confectionery business in York. His textbook <span class="italic">Organising a Sales Office</span> (1928) is an account of his managerial reforms at Rowntrees. He lectured at the management conferences sponsored by Rowntree at Oxford, and became the first honorary secretary (1926&#150;8) of the management research groups intended by Rowntree to be a national forum for business managers to discuss their work. Many businessmen doubted that management could be taught as a subject, and Urwick endured widespread suspicion of his pioneering ideas. He was a forceful, attractive public speaker (he shared his father's gift in amateur theatricals) and he wrote in a lucid prose.<br>
<br>In <span class="italic">The Meaning of Rationalisation</span> (1929) Urwick advocated the industrial rationalization movement as a means of applying scientific method to economic life and thus of raising human productive efficiency. Urwick believed in the inter-war period that the greatest failure of contemporary management was in distribution, and in 1931 he published a study of European and American practice in this area. Another work, <span class="italic">The Management of Tomorrow</span> (1933), was more philosophical in presentation than his specialized textbooks, but it had a long-term influence on British managerial thinking. His ideas about organization and leadership were deeply influenced by his early soldiering. In the 1920s he urged the need for a college of managerial education which was equivalent to the staff colleges of the fighting services. Significantly his idea resulted in the Administrative Staff College when it came to fruition in 1948.<br>
<br>In 1928 Urwick was appointed director of the International Management Institute at Geneva (partly financed by the International Labour Office and the Twentieth Century Fund, USA). Established to promote the principles of scientific management, this institute was the first international management body and it involved Urwick in innumerable meetings in Europe and the USA. He was rapporteur g&eacute;n&eacute;ral of the International Distribution Commission (1932) and general secretary of the International Committee of Scientific Management (1932&#150;5). After the institute's funding collapsed, he founded in 1934 the management consultancy Urwick, Orr, &amp; Partners&#151;only the fourth consultancy of its kind in Britain. Hitherto the rigid, peremptory attitudes of American management consultants operating in Britain had been provocative in some workplaces. Urwick tempered Taylorism to British susceptibilities and adjusted his advice to the needs of individual client companies. Indeed he desired major social adjustments so that workers and managers could accommodate the demands of mechanization, and he favoured joint consultation, profit-sharing, and a formal reapportioning of authority between managers and staff. Urwick Orr commanded a worldwide reputation and for many years was unequalled among British consultancies. Urwick was its chairman (1934&#150;61), managing partner (1945&#150;51), and president (1963&#150;83).<br>
<br>Taylorite principles of organization and methods were crucial to Urwick's faith that, with scrupulously defined procedures, management techniques could be refined almost to scientific exactitude. During 1940&#150;42 Urwick advised the Treasury on the application of organization and methods. Often abrasive when he felt he was being frustrated, he clashed with Sir Horace Wilson, head of the civil service, over civil service reforms. Some of his ideas on improving governmental efficiency by management specialization were implemented by Sir Derek Rayner after 1979. Urwick, who was commissioned in 1942 as a lieutenant-colonel and who retained his military title in civilian life, was deputy director of the petroleum warfare department (1942&#150;4) and chairman of the departmental committee on education for management (1945).<br>
<br>Together with Edward Brech, Urwick compiled three authoritative volumes entitled <span class="italic">The Making of Scientific Management</span> (1945&#150;8). Among other public work, Urwick was a council member of the British Institute of Management (1947&#150;52), chairman of the Anglo-American productivity team on education for management (1951), and master of the Glovers' Company. He was honoured with professional medals and honorary degrees, chiefly in countries other than his own; universities in Canada, the USA, and Australia invited him as a visiting professor in business administration. He published prolifically during this period.<br>
<br>On 31 March 1923 Urwick married a medical student, Joan Wilhelmina (1901&#150;1984), daughter of James Pirch Bedford, of the Indian Civil Service. From this marriage, which was dissolved in 1938, there was a son and a daughter. Urwick married second, on 27 September 1941, Beatrice Helen Fitzhardinge (<i>b</i>. 1908), daughter of Major Hugh Munro Warrand, army officer, and sister of Sir Hugh Munro-Lucas-Tooth of Teananich, first baronet. They adopted a son and a daughter. Beatrice Urwick had Australian connections, and after Urwick relinquished the chairmanship of his consultancy they emigrated to Sydney. Urwick died in Australia on 5 December 1983 at Longueville, Sydney, New South Wales, and was cremated there shortly afterwards.<br>
