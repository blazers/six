<span class="headword">Phipps, Sir  Constantine</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1656, <em>d.</em> 1723), <span class="occ">lord chancellor of Ireland</span>, was baptized on 12 November 1656 in St Mary's parish church, Reading, Berkshire. With his twin sister, Ann, he was the youngest of eleven children of Francis Phipps (1610&#150;1668), a Nottinghamshire yeoman who by dint of marrying Anne Sharpe (<i>d</i>. 1660), a propertied widow, had been able to purchase The Bear inn in Reading; later in life Constantine's enemies in Dublin drank &#145;confusion &hellip; to the fat bear of Reading&#146;  (D. Hayton, ed., &#145;An Irish parliamentary diary from the reign of Queen Anne&#146;, <span class="italic">Analecta Hibernica</span>, 30, 1982, 40). Francis Phipps's social aspirations were greater than his means, and the young Constantine suffered several disappointments in his youth. Put down for Eton College, to follow his eldest brother (who became a clergyman), he was unable to take his place. Then, having won a scholarship to St John's College, Oxford, he was obliged to ask the college to postpone his entry, and never went up. He even had to sue for the &pound;500 legacy that he should have received after his father's death in 1668 but which debts had swallowed. Eventually he secured admission to Gray's Inn in 1678, transferring in due course to the Middle Temple, where in 1684 he was called to the bar.<br>
<br>In the same year occurred the event that transformed Phipps's fortunes. On 12 October he married Catherine (<i>c</i>.1667&#150;1728), orphaned daughter of George Sawyer, a Herefordshire gentleman, and, more importantly, the niece of the attorney-general, Sir Robert Sawyer, who not only doubled Catherine's fortune to &pound;2000 but took her husband under his wing. With such a patron Phipps soon began to develop a flourishing practice, and he appeared as junior counsel for the crown in various political cases, including the trial of Titus Oates for perjury in 1685 (though he was also retained to defend the nonconformist clergyman Richard Baxter). In 1686 he was granted the office of steward of the crown manors of Cookham and Bray, Berkshire, which Sawyer had held before him.<br>
<br>Although his reputation and income grew steadily Phipps's prospects for professional advancement were seriously dampened by the revolution of 1688. Not only was Sawyer out of office (he died in 1692) but Phipps's own political prejudices were too resolutely tory for him to be considered for preferment. He specialized in acting for high-flyers and even downright Jacobites: Lady Preston, wife of the Jacobite conspirator, in 1691; Sir John Fenwick, in his abortive trial in 1696, prior to the bill of attainder; the nonjuring bishop of St David's, Thomas Watson, in his appeals against deprivation for simony in 1703 and 1705. Several colonial connections, in particular with his cousin Sir William Phipps, governor of Massachusetts, also gave him opportunities of another kind; he was probably the Mr Phipps who acted as London agent for Massachusetts and as agent and counsel for other New England and West Indian interests. But his greatest opportunity came in 1710, when he was one of the defending counsel at Dr Sacheverell's impeachment. Though on occasion drawn into difficulties by supererogatory ingenuity he was able to make some effective points through paying close attention to the text of the offending sermon, and in general was thought to have given one of the more impressive displays of forensic skill of all the counsel on view.<br>
<br>It was this performance that at last made Phipps seem an appropriate candidate for high office, but he was still too much of a high tory to be raised to the English bench and instead, in December 1710, he was named the new lord chancellor of Ireland, under the viceroyalty of the second duke of Ormond. Some observers were surprised that he was willing to relinquish a highly lucrative legal practice even for this honour. Knighted in advance of appointment, he travelled to Dublin in January 1711 to take up his office and was almost immediately sworn in as a lord justice, until Ormond came over to undertake the parliamentary session in July. After a honeymoon period, in which he was complimented with the freedom of several Irish cities, he launched himself into the furious party conflict that characterized Irish politics in this period, making himself a hero to the tories and a bitter enemy to the whigs. The first opportunity to show his party colours came when a dispute over the election of the lord mayor of Dublin was brought before the Irish privy council. The predominantly whiggish corporation had broken with convention to pass over the claims of the most senior alderman, who happened to be a tory. Under the new rules of 1672 elections of chief magistrates in certain boroughs had to be approved by the council, and Phipps led the tory majority in refusing Dublin's choice. Thus began a long-drawn out dispute between the council and the corporation that lasted through successive mayoral elections over the next three years. To make matters worse the council also refused to approve whig magisterial elections in other boroughs and were denounced for acting partially and arbitrarily, in a way that was said to recall the excesses of Wentworth and Tyrconnell.<br>
<br>The campaign against borough corporations, for so it was perceived, and the Dublin dispute in particular, served to focus the hostility of the Irish whigs upon Phipps himself. His suspected Jacobite sympathies made him something of a bogeyman in Irish politics. Among a whole battery of accusations he was accused, as lord chancellor, of favouring Catholics in legal cases and of appointing crypto-Catholics as sheriffs and justices of the peace; and, in his capacity as one of the lords justices, in Ormond's absence, of failing to implement the penal laws against Catholics and of allowing the militia to run down, so that the kingdom would be a more easy prey to invasion. Whatever the truth of these charges (and in the case of the implementation of the penal laws it would appear that government may actually have been more active in this respect under Phipps's direction) there is no doubt that in two contrasting and controversial legal cases his administration was at least guilty of party-political bias, if not worse. On the one hand a young whig, Dudley Moore, was subject to the full severity of the law for his part in a riot at a Dublin theatre, with Phipps accused of attempting to pack the jury and to prejudice the case by ill-advised public comments. On the other hand the Jacobite publisher Edward Lloyd, who had advertised for sale the Pretender's &#145;memoirs&#146;, was set free when government, encouraged by Phipps, entered a <i>nolle prosequi</i>.<br>
<br>By the time that a new viceroy arrived in Ireland in the autumn of 1713&#151;the moderate whig duke of Shrewsbury&#151;Irish politics were in turmoil. Shrewsbury's efforts to defuse tension were undone by Phipps and his fellow tory councillors' refusing all overtures to compromise on the Dublin mayoral dispute. Then, during the short parliamentary session of November&#150;December 1713 the whig and &#145;Hanoverian tory&#146; majority in the House of Commons mounted a sustained attack against &#145;that devil the chancellor&#146;  (<span class="italic">Various Collections</span>, 8.264), with inquiries into the cases of Lloyd and Moore, and into the Dublin affair, culminating in an address to the queen to remove Phipps from office. Friends in the Lords and in Convocation drew up counter-addresses but the government's loss of control in the Commons necessitated the prorogation of parliament, which did not meet again in Anne's lifetime.<br>
<br>Phipps was again named a lord justice after Shrewsbury returned to England in 1714, but with the death of the queen his days as lord chancellor were numbered. Having resigned from office in September 1714 he returned to England and immediately resumed his legal practice. Oxford University granted him an honorary DCL, essentially a political gesture but one that must have given him particular satisfaction when he remembered his forfeited scholarship. He recovered his position as a leading chancery and exchequer pleader, but without relinquishing his strong political prejudices, defending the Scottish Jacobite Lord Wintoun in 1716 (and publishing his address to the jury) and acting in a private capacity to advise the exiled duke of Ormond. His name figures frequently in Jacobite correspondence after 1715, and in 1718 the pretender himself requested his confidential advice on a difficult legal matter. At the time of the so-called Atterbury plot in 1722 he channelled funds to the Jacobites. One of his last appearances as an advocate was as counsel for Bishop Atterbury in May 1723, against the bill of pains and penalties. His defiant speech in Atterbury's defence was published in part soon afterwards, although its full printing did not occur until after Phipps's death, in the Middle Temple, on 9 October 1723. He was buried, on 15 October, with his wife's ancestors and some of his children, at White Waltham, Berkshire, but the property that he bequeathed was almost entirely in London. Of his eleven children only four survived: three daughters and a son, William, who married the heir of the third earl of Anglesey (a granddaughter of James II). Their son Constantine was raised to the Irish peerage as Baron Mulgrave and was the ancestor of the marquesses of Normanby of the second creation.<br>
