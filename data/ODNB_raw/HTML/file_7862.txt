<span class="headword">Douglas,  Archibald</span>, fourth earl of Douglas, and duke of Touraine in the French nobility  (<em>c.</em>1369&#150;1424), <span class="occ">magnate and soldier</span>, was the elder son and heir of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7861/', "Archibald Douglas, the Grim, third earl of Douglas and lord of Galloway (d. 1400)")</script>, and Joanna Murray (<i>d</i>. after 1408), heir of Bothwell and Drumsagart (now Cambuslang) in Lanarkshire. The second Archibald has occasionally been called the Tyneman, or loser, on account of the defeats he suffered on the battlefields of Homildon Hill, Shrewsbury, and Verneuil. However, it is likely that in the later middle ages this nickname belonged rather to Archibald's great-uncle and namesake who was killed at Halidon Hill in 1333. Its application to the fourth earl of Douglas is an unfair epitaph for the greatest magnate of the Douglas dynasty.<h2>
<a name="Borderpoliticsandwarfare"></a>Border politics and warfare</h2>Although his father had a son, William [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7925/', "Douglas, Sir William, lord of Nithsdale")</script>], from an earlier relationship, who was married to a daughter of Robert II, it was the younger Archibald Douglas who was identified as heir to both his father's lordship of Galloway and his mother's extensive inheritance in Clydesdale and in the north. The latter's status was underlined by his marriage to Princess Margaret (<i>d</i>. 1450/51) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/59233/', "Douglas, Margaret, countess of Douglas, and duchess of Touraine in the French nobility")</script>], the eldest daughter of John Stewart, earl of Carrick, heir to the throne and lieutenant of the kingdom, about 1387. The match was designed to bind Archibald the Grim to Carrick, but instead linked the politics of the royal family to the Black Douglas dynasty in a way disastrous for Carrick's own line. This was first demonstrated in the following year when, after the death of James, second earl of Douglas, in battle in 1388, Archibald the Grim secured the earldom of Douglas and aided in Carrick's fall from power by allying with the lieutenant's younger brother Robert Stewart, earl of Fife (later duke of Albany). The events of 1388&#150;9 made the younger Archibald heir to massive estates in southern Scotland, but his father faced problems holding the Douglas following together in the face of pressure from his Red Douglas rivals and Carrick, now King Robert III. It was as master of Douglas that Archibald the son made his first appearance in active politics in this struggle. It was perhaps in 1398 that the lands of the earldom of Douglas, including the lordships of Ettrick and Lauderdale, were assigned to the younger Archibald by his father, in an effort to ensure the former's succession to these disputed estates. The same year the master entered into war with England, breaking the truce by attacking English-held Roxburgh.<br>
<br>During the rest of his career Douglas combined warfare with wide political ambitions in Scotland and beyond. In 1399 he continued to lead his father's followers in attacks on England, attacks which were partly responsible for provoking the new English king, Henry IV, into launching an invasion of southern Scotland in the following year. Douglas's actions had political implications within Scotland. His father had forged an alliance with David, duke of Rothesay, elder son of Robert III and newly appointed lieutenant for his father. As part of this, Rothesay married the old earl's daughter Mary, an act which alienated the Douglases' chief southern rival, George Dunbar, earl of March. March turned to the English king to put pressure on Rothesay, but in his absence the master of Douglas seized his main stronghold at Dunbar and secured the support of many of March's chief tenants. The master clearly saw war with England and the Dunbars as the means to recover his family's influence in Lothian. By the time Henry IV led his army north in the summer of 1400, Douglas had been appointed keeper of Edinburgh Castle for life, a base for his local influence for over two decades. When his elderly father died at Christmas 1400, Douglas had already secured his place as the leader of the war in south-east Scotland. In early 1401 he routed a force led by March and Henry Percy (Hotspur), in eastern Lothian, and later in the year he established control of March's lordship of Annandale.<br>
<br>In these circumstances Douglas hardly wanted a cessation of Anglo-Scottish hostilities. By March 1401 the Stewart dukes, Rothesay and Albany, were anxious to secure a general truce but, when they sought to negotiate with the English, Douglas prevented them from entering his lands and continued the war. As in previous years, Stewart rivalries worked to the advantage of the Douglas earl. Amid growing political tension between them, in October 1401 Albany arrested his nephew, Rothesay. Albany's next act was to meet with Douglas at Culross in Perthshire. He needed to secure the support of Rothesay's main ally and was prepared to make considerable concessions to Douglas. The latter agreed to the death of Rothesay and in return Albany accepted an escalated war with England. Douglas, calling himself the lord of Dunbar, immediately rode to break up border negotiations and during early 1402 a series of Scottish attacks were launched across the border. In September Douglas himself took the field at the head of a massive force which included a force from Albany's retinue and a number of other magnates. However, after raiding to the Tyne the Scots were crushingly defeated on the 14th by an English army led by Hotspur and March at Homildon Hill near Wooler in Northumberland. Douglas was blinded in one eye by an arrow and taken prisoner.<h2>
<a name="Englishcaptivity"></a>English captivity</h2>Initially Douglas's defeat seemed to have exposed southern Scotland to renewed English occupation. The Percys were granted many of the earl's estates by Henry IV and in early 1403 began the campaign to make good their title. In these circumstances, Douglas was saved by conflict between his enemies. In summer 1403 the Percys rebelled against Henry IV. One of their grievances was the king's demand that they surrender those captured at Homildon Hill. Douglas in turn hoped to secure his release by providing support for Hotspur when the latter led his army south. When the Percys clashed with the royal army at Shrewsbury on 21 July 1403, Douglas, a huge and impressive fighting man, led a Scots contingent and the rebel vanguard. He wreaked considerable slaughter among Henry IV's own household, but when Hotspur was killed the rebel army fled. Douglas, who this time lost a testicle in the fight, was captured once more. Now a royal prisoner, Douglas spent much of the next six years in London. His imprisonment was not too confined: by the time of his final return to Scotland, Douglas had his own establishment in London; he shared his captivity with many other Scots, fellow prisoners like the son of Albany, Murdoch (or Murdac) Stewart, and the young king of Scots, James I, and his own household servants; and after 1405 received at least three lengthy periods of parole in Scotland.<br>
<br>These paroles reflected Henry IV's desire to use his prisoner to his own advantage but they also allowed Douglas to maintain his lands and lordship during his captivity. Douglas's first return in 1405 was to seek his own release in exchange for Henry Percy, first earl of Northumberland, an exile in Scotland. The failure of this scheme condemned Douglas to further captivity. His second parole in 1407 was connected to the negotiations between Albany, now governor of Scotland, and Douglas's enemies, the Dunbars, who were still in exile. In return for his release, Douglas sealed an indenture with Henry IV, becoming the king's man. Douglas's renewed presence in Scotland caused problems for Albany and the evidence suggests that friction between the two magnates and their followings ensued. When Albany allowed the Dunbars to return to Scotland in early 1408, Douglas left captivity for a third and final time, effectively absconding from his parole, even though he had left hostages for his return. A settlement between Albany and Douglas was only reached in an indenture between the two magnates in June 1409. They promised mutual friendship and agreed to settle disputes arising between them and their followers, but no mention was made of Albany's authority as governor. In return for relinquishing Dunbar to its previous lords, Douglas obtained the lordship of Annandale. The relationship between Douglas and Albany was sealed by the marriage of Douglas's daughter, Elizabeth, to Albany's second son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26483/', "John Stewart, earl of Buchan")</script>, in 1410.<h2>
<a name="Powerandpatronage"></a>Power and patronage</h2>The maintenance of Douglas's fortunes from captivity depended on the loyalty of his family and following in Scotland. The earl recognized the need to reward support. His brother James had defended family interests on the governor's council and in battle, and Douglas granted him a share of their mother's inheritance. Douglas similarly rewarded the service of other key supporters like William Crawford, his deputy in Edinburgh Castle, and James Douglas of Dalkeith, a long-standing ally of the Black Douglases. Crucially, between 1400 and 1409 Douglas was able to win the adherence of the most important local lords in the south. His influence in the old Dunbar lands was guaranteed by Douglas's good relations with Alexander and David Hume of Berwickshire, while his hold on Annandale was secured with the help of Robert Maxwell of Caerlaverock. A second Annandale man, Michael Ramsay, was also associated with Douglas. Ramsay's service rested on the dubious privilege of being husband of the earl's mistress, Christian, possibly the mother of the earl's bastard son John. Douglas gave these lords lands, money, and positions as his local deputies. Within the Douglas kindred, the support which the earl gave to William and Archibald, the bastard sons of the second earl of Douglas, weakened the power of the rival Red Douglas branch of the family.<br>
<br>The power of the fourth earl of Douglas rested on his leadership of a massive connection drawn from across the south. It also rested on his unparalleled accumulation of offices in the region. By 1410 Douglas was justiciar south of Forth and warden of all three marches towards England, this latter role elevated into &#145;Great Guardian&#146; in the earl's own documents. As elsewhere in Scotland, the powers of government rested with the greatest private magnate of the region. The earl seems to have regarded the royal revenues of the south as a perquisite of his post. The profits of his justiciary courts and at least &pound;500 a year from the customs of Edinburgh were siphoned into Douglas's coffers. Albany may have attempted to limit these depredations, but he had little success, and Douglas was regarded with some justice by one English writer as the real ruler of southern Scotland.<br>
<br>The influence of Douglas extended to the Scottish church. He was recognized by the abbeys of Dryburgh, Sweetheart, Holyrood, and Melrose, and by Coldingham Priory, as a valuable patron and protector. The earl's standing with the church, in Scotland and beyond, was raised to new levels by the ending of the great schism. By 1418 Scotland was virtually alone in continuing to support Pope Benedict XIII at Avignon when the other major kingdoms of the west were adhering to his Roman rival, Martin V. Albany remained firmly attached to Benedict, but Douglas was identified as a source of secular support for Martin, and as early as 1414 he had received letters from the king of France and elsewhere asking for his help in reuniting the church; by 1418 he had worked successfully with St Andrews University to secure Scottish recognition for Martin. The earl benefited in terms of prestige and influence from his involvement in the schism. The papacy addressed Douglas in respectful terms and churchmen and religious houses sought his sponsorship at the curia.<h2>
<a name="WaranddiplomacyinFrance"></a>War and diplomacy in France</h2>Douglas's role in ecclesiastical politics also added to his reputation outside Scotland. Respected by European rulers long before 1418, Douglas was keen to play a part in international politics. He placed most weight on his family's well-established French connection. The Douglas name was already famous in France and when the earl invaded England in 1402 he had a company of French knights in his army. After Homildon Hill the French sought to ransom not just their own knights but Douglas too as a friend of their kingdom, and in 1404 there was talk of a marriage alliance between the French royal house and Douglas. The earl was eager to exploit this fame. In 1412 he travelled to France and negotiated an agreement with John, duke of Burgundy, effective regent for Charles VI. Facing a civil war and English invasion, Burgundy sought military aid and Douglas promised to lead 4000 men to the continent to fight for pay. Burgundy promised reciprocal support to Douglas, and though the plan came to nothing, it clearly established Scotland, and Douglas in particular, as a source of soldiers for wars in France. In 1419 the Dauphin Charles, facing Henry V of England's attempts to conquer France, also looked to Scotland for military assistance. He made a direct appeal to the governor and estates, having prepared the way by writing directly to Albany, Douglas, and other Scottish magnates. The expedition which the Scots sent was dominated by the retinues of Albany and Douglas. Its leaders were Douglas's elder son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7863/', "Archibald Douglas, earl of Wigtown")</script>, and his son-in-law John Stewart, earl of Buchan. Among the 6000 men the earls took to France were many who had served the earl of Douglas in war and politics. Although Douglas himself avoided going to France at this point, he clearly committed extensive resources to the continental war and placed considerable hopes on its success.<br>
<br>The importance of the expeditions to France may be related to difficulties in Douglas's position in Scotland which began to show after 1410. Despite his political successes there were limits to the earl's ability to dominate the south. Most spectacularly, in 1416 Douglas was forced to besiege a hostile force in his own castle of Edinburgh, perhaps indicating a dispute with his deputy governor. This reflected wider problems, especially in Lothian. A number of feuds between baronial families in the early 1420s suggest difficulties perhaps connected to the re-emergence of the Red Douglases and Dunbars as rivals for predominance in south-east Scotland. During the same period the war leadership which was the basis of Douglas's influence across the south declined in importance. The restoration of the Dunbars in 1408 ended major Anglo-Scottish conflict. From 1415 English attention focused on France and, though Douglas led raids into northern England in that year, 1419, and 1420, and besieged Roxburgh Castle in 1417, these attacks achieved little except to provoke English retaliation.<br>
<br>Opportunities for greater importance and rewards lay on the continent. At Easter 1421 the Scottish army under Buchan and Wigtown defeated an English force at Baug&eacute;. The victory immediately heightened the importance of the Scots in Anglo-French conflict. While the Scots in France were showered with rewards by the dauphin, Douglas exploited the victory to seek a deal with Henry V. As he had done with other rulers, Douglas offered military service in return for significant rewards. In May 1421 he agreed to become Henry's man for life, serving him with 400 soldiers and receiving an annuity of &pound;200 sterling. The arrangement was supported by James I who was to be temporarily released in exchange for hostages. Although James never went to Scotland and Douglas never served Henry V against his own family, and an English pension was far less than the rewards being offered by the French, the indenture had diplomatic value for Douglas. It forged links with the English and put pressure on the dauphin to bid for further Scottish help. It also allowed Douglas to move closer to his brother-in-law, James I. The two men had worked together in efforts to bring Scotland into papal allegiance between 1415 and 1418. After 1421 Douglas remained in regular contact with James and by 1423, after Henry V's death, the earl was working for the return of the king to Scotland. By the end of the year James's release was agreed.<h2>
<a name="Verneuil"></a>Verneuil</h2>Douglas may have believed that James I would follow his return to Scotland with an attack on Duke Murdoch of Albany, who had succeeded his father as governor. In such Stewart rivalry the Black Douglases would hold the balance of power as they had done in 1402, and neither the king nor Albany would interfere with Douglas interests. The earl sought security in Scotland which would allow him to go to France in person. In October 1423 Douglas had promised to support the dauphin (now Charles VII) with a full-scale army and handed over his Scottish lands to the safe keeping of his wife and elder son. In February 1424 he and Buchan left for France with an army. On 7 March Douglas landed at La Rochelle and on 24 April the Scottish army of 6500 men was reviewed by Charles VII at Bourges. Douglas was well paid for his support. He was granted the duchy of Touraine and was named lieutenant-general of the king for the war against England. A non-royal foreigner, Douglas had been given rank and powers without precedent in medieval France. He moved quickly to take possession of his new lands. On 7 May the citizens of Tours reluctantly welcomed their new duke, who was made a canon of the cathedral and also took custody of the castles at Loches and Tours.<br>
<br>During the next three months Douglas and his army lived off the land in Touraine, running up debts and arousing local hostility. Then in August he led an army of Scots, French, and Italians northwards to enter the war against the English in Normandy. Although his attempt to relieve the town of Ivry (Eure) failed, on 16 August Douglas captured Verneuil-sur-Avre (Eure). This provoked the advance of the English under John, duke of Bedford. Against the advice of many French nobles, Douglas offered battle next day outside Verneuil. The fight was the fiercest of the war. The Scots threatened to break the English opposite them but, led by the Italians, the rest of the army fled. Douglas, who was in the thick of the fight, was killed along with his younger son James, Buchan, and almost the entire Scottish contingent. He was buried with his son and son-in-law in St Gatien's Cathedral at Tours. The fourth earl of Douglas had used the resources built up by magnates of his family to carve out a role for himself in Scotland and in European politics. His ambitions were enormous and rested on his military following. Douglas may have hoped to found a Franco-Scottish princely house but his death and the destruction of his army left the way clear for the revival of royal power in Scotland.<br>
