<span class="headword">Douglas,  Robert</span>, Count Douglas in the Swedish nobility  (1611&#150;1662), <span class="occ">army officer in the Swedish service</span>, was born at Standingstone Farm, near Haddington, on 17 March 1611, the youngest of at least three sons of Patrick Douglas of Whittingehame and his wife, Christina Leslie. The document proving Douglas's ancestry, obtained from the Scottish parliament in the name of Charles I in 1648, listed his father as <i>comarchus</i> of Standingstone, which later became translated as marquess in Sweden, although Patrick Douglas was only a laird.<br>
<br>Not much is known of Douglas's early years, but by 1628 he had taken a path common to many young Scotsmen and entered Swedish service in Colonel James Ramsay's regiment, along with his two brothers, William and Richard, who both died shortly thereafter. Douglas was taken into service as a page for the elector palatine Johann Casimir, the brother-in-law of the Swedish king, Gustavus Adolphus, and as a result Douglas came to know the future king Karl X rather well. Douglas soon became an ensign in the service of Gustavus Adolphus, and saw action during the joint Swedish&#150;Danish defence of Stralsund from 1629 to 1630, where he served under the command of the governor, Colonel Alexander Leslie (the future earl of Leven). Although his autobiographical notes maintain he was still a personal page to the Swedish king, the Swedish army muster rolls reveal that Douglas entered the Green regiment in 1631. Douglas also served as captain-lieutenant of some of the British troops recruited by the marquess of Hamilton for Swedish service. He then became a major with a dragoon corps from 1632, was promoted lieutenant-colonel two years later, and finally rose to a colonelcy in 1636.<br>
<br>Douglas decided to travel home that year to sort out domestic issues in Scotland, and the Riksr&aring;d (Swedish state council) arranged accreditation for him to Charles I. The intercessory letter they provided concerned his inheritance troubles, while Chancellor Oxenstierna also employed him for personal affairs in London. Douglas therefore had both official and private sponsorship from the highest echelons of the Swedish government for his journey, and by November 1636 he had arrived in London. He avoided involvement in the covenanting wars of Scotland and returned in the late summer of 1637 to Sweden to continue his military career. Although Douglas remained on the margins of British political developments throughout his life, Charles II personally requested his support in providing Scottish recruits for his use in 1655. He was not able to comply, but he had already sent him 5200 riksdaler two years previously. Douglas also sought Swedish intercession in 1658 on behalf of John Maitland, marquess and duke of Lauderdale, who was imprisoned by Cromwell. Although this did not lead to Lauderdale's immediate release, his prison conditions improved.<br>
<br>By 1643 Douglas had been promoted general of the Swedish cavalry. He further consolidated his social standing in 1645 by marrying Hedvig M&ouml;rner (<i>c</i>.1624&#150;<i>c</i>.1671), the sister-in-law of Baron Erik Stenbock. His wife and family followed him on his foreign appointments, as shown by the birth of his sixth child in Poland in 1655. His position as governor of Schwaben caused him problems owing to the drastic shortage of funds, frequently complained about in the Riksr&aring;d. His military promotions continued and he became major-general in 1647. He spent a month in Stockholm that year participating in the meetings of the Riksr&aring;d, often in the presence of Queen Kristina, where he provided information on the army's situation in Germany, and advised the queen against entering into land exchanges with the French.<br>
<br>In 1649 Douglas was promoted lieutenant-general and, having become firmly established in Sweden, planned to build a house at Qvarnholmen in Stockholm. Douglas was ennobled in 1651 with the title of Baron Douglas of Sk&auml;lby, which gave him land at Kalmar. He was also appointed a member of the military council, despite his open Calvinism. His integration into Swedish noble and court society was confirmed by service as the royal stablemaster in 1652. Two years later he gained another title, being made Count (Greve) Douglas of Skenninge, and was introduced to the Swedish house of nobility. He also continued to participate in meetings of the Riksr&aring;d.<br>
<br>Sweden's war with Poland, beginning in 1655, saw Douglas active as general and successfully taking a fortress barely 6 miles from Crakow. He became a lieutenant-field marshal of the infantry and cavalry in the same year. Douglas personally accompanied Karl X on his march towards Riga in 1656, and became a full field marshal in the following year. On account of war with Denmark&#150;Norway, Douglas was recalled from Riga, with his family, to help defend Sweden. He not only participated in the Riksr&aring;d again that year, but also served as a military adviser to the Swedish government on defence tactics. He commanded 3000 men at the battle of Laholm, defeating the Danish forces. His military expertise led the Riksr&aring;d to send him to the Dal and Norrland regions with 2000 soldiers and 300 cavalry in order to take Trondheim from the Norwegians. In 1658 he received a pass to travel in Sweden, and he again served on the military council which was organizing the garrisons in the territories newly won through conquest from Denmark&#150;Norway.<br>
<br>When the Polish campaigns resumed towards the end of 1658 Douglas replaced governor Magnus de la Gardie as military commander in the Baltic states of Estonia and Livonia. His military assignment in the Baltic was to regain territories occupied by the Russians, who had joined in the Polish war against Sweden. Indeed Douglas's most notorious duty involved kidnapping the duke of Courland and his family. Once peace had been established at Kardis in 1661 Douglas became responsible for demobilizing his Swedish troops. Karl X, with whom Douglas had a personal relationship (he had twice entertained the Swedish royal couple at his G&ouml;teborg home in 1658) died and Douglas and his family returned to Sweden in September 1661. Douglas continued to participate in meetings of the Riksr&aring;d and military council until his death in Blasieholmen, Stockholm, on 28 May 1662. He was buried in Riddarholms church, Stockholm.<br>
<br>Militarily, Robert Douglas was probably the most successful British immigrant to Sweden during the Thirty Years' War. Although Alexander Leslie also attained the rank of field marshal, his love for Scotland was so strong that he left Sweden in 1638, never to serve its crown again. Douglas, on the other hand, only briefly considered moving to Scotland with his family when he temporarily fell out of favour with the new Swedish king, Karl XI, in 1660. In his adopted country he has been regarded as &#145;a great Swedish man&#146; and his biographer has concluded that, through high military rank, baronial privileges, wealth, and marriage, &#145;despite all the retained Scottish idiosyncrasies&#146;, he had become a Swede  (Douglas, 16).<br>
