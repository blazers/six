<span class="headword">Upfield,  Arthur William</span>  (1890&#150;1964), <span class="occ">author and traveller</span>, was born on 1 September 1890, at 88 North Street, Gosport, Hampshire, the eldest of the five sons of a draper, James Upfield, and his wife, Annie, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Barmore. During childhood he lived sometimes with his parents, sometimes with his grandparents, and attended a series of different schools in Gosport. Although he began writing novels in his spare time, his academic success was minimal. Articled at sixteen to an estate agent, he failed his examinations two years later and was shipped off by his exasperated father to Australia.<br>
<br>In reaction against the boredom of clerical work, Upfield took a job as boundary rider in interior New South Wales. He quickly gained a liking for the bush, and worked at a variety of jobs, including drover, farmhand, bullock-wagon driver, and cook. His patriotism caused him to join the Australian Imperial Force in August 1914, and he endured campaigns in Flanders and Gallipoli. He married an English nurse, Anne Douglas; they had one son, Arthur James. However, the marriage failed and he returned to Australia and resumed his wandering life. Although his wife and son came out to join him in Western Australia in the early 1930s, the reconciliation attempt failed. However, they were never divorced.<br>
<br>While working in southern Queensland, Upfield met Leon Wood, whose white mother and Aboriginal father had abandoned him at birth, but whose abilities had brought him employment by the Queensland police. Upfield had begun writing a detective story, but had set it aside and instead written a thriller, <span class="italic">The House of Cain</span> (1928). Their second meeting inspired him to model his central character on Leon; the result was Napoleon Bonaparte, the half-Aboriginal detective who made his earliest appearance in <span class="italic">The Barrakee Mystery</span> (1929) and was subsequently to be featured in twenty-eight further crime novels; these have been repeatedly republished and featured on radio and television. Upfield published three other novels, but these did not find a significant readership. In 1933 he became a staff writer for the <span class="italic">Melbourne Herald</span> and wrote for that newspaper a serial, <span class="italic">The Great Melbourne Cup Mystery</span>; this was eventually republished in book form in 1996. He was also a contributor to <span class="italic">World Wide Magazine</span> and <span class="italic">Walkabout</span>.<br>
<br>For the second Bonaparte novel, <span class="italic">The Sands of Windee</span> (1931), Upfield conceived an effective technique for the disposal of a corpse. He described this to a group that included an itinerant swagman, Snowy Rowles: to Upfield's great dismay, the method was used by Rowles while committing three murders in Western Australia. Upfield's account of this episode, <span class="italic">The Murchison Murders</span>, was published obscurely in the 1930s and republished in 1987.<br>
<br>Upfield's burgeoning career as a writer did not prevent him from travelling. In 1948 he headed a 5000 mile long Australian Geographical Society tour in Western Australia. Indeed, there were few parts of Australia that he did not visit. In most of his novels, the setting is integral to the plot; one is even set, not onshore, but in the swordfishing grounds of the Tasman Sea (<span class="italic">The Mystery of Swordfish Reef</span>, 1939). The most urban is <span class="italic">An Author Bites the Dust</span> (1948), which contains a thinly disguised self-portrait and expresses his rancour at his shabby treatment by the Australian literary establishment.<br>
<br>Upfield's strength, however, lies in his depiction of the Australian outback&#151;its topography, its erratic weather patterns, its unique fauna, and its equally unique human inhabitants. Usually his male characters are of the pioneer breed that was already vanishing; whether good or evil, they are always strongly drawn. Some of his female characters, like the formidable Mary Answerth and her manipulating sister in <span class="italic">Venom House</span> (1952), or the streetwise policewoman Alice McGorr in <span class="italic">Murder must Wait</span> (1953) and <span class="italic">The Battling Prophet</span> (1956), are equally well drawn; but his heroines tend to be idealized and insipid. A particular virtue is Upfield's percipient and sympathetic characterization of Australia's Aboriginal peoples. His knowledge of their beliefs and traditions, and his regret at the erosion of these through the indifference or antipathy of most white settlers, give his writing an especial relevance and poignancy.<br>
<br>In his later years Upfield enjoyed the companionship of Jessica Uren, with whom he lived at Airey Inlet, Victoria, and at Bermagui and Bowral, New South Wales. She tended him during his last illness; he died in Bowral on 13 February 1964.<br>
