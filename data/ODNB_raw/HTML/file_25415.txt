</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Shipp,  John</span>  (1785&#150;1834), <span class="occ">army officer and author</span>, younger son of Thomas Shipp, a marine, and his wife, Laetitia, was born at Saxmundham, Suffolk, on 16 March 1785. His mother died in poor circumstances in 1789, his elder brother was lost at sea, and John became an inmate of the parish poorhouse; he was apprenticed by the overseers to a neighbouring farmer, a brutal taskmaster, from whom he escaped by enlisting as a boy in the 22nd (Cheshire) regiment, at Colchester, on 17 January 1797. Through the kindness of his captain he picked up some education, and, after service in the Channel Islands and the Cape, sailed for India, where, having risen to be a sergeant in the grenadier company, he served against the Marathas under Lord Lake. He was one of the stormers at the capture of Dig on 24 December 1804, and three times led the forlorn hope of the storming column in the unsuccessful assaults on Bharatpur (January&#150;February 1805). He was severely wounded, but his bravery was rewarded by Lord Lake with an ensigncy in the 65th foot. On 10 March in the same year he was gazetted lieutenant in the 76th foot.<br>
<br>Returning home after two and a half years' further service, Shipp found himself forced to sell out on 19 March 1808 in order to obtain a sum (about &pound;250) to pay his debts. After a short interval he found himself in London without a shilling, and resolved to re-enlist in the ranks. He returned to India as a private in the 24th light dragoons, and rose by 1812 to the position of regimental sergeant-major. In May 1815 the earl of Moira reappointed him to an ensigncy in the 87th (the Prince of Wales's Own) Irish regiment of foot (later Royal Irish Fusiliers), lately arrived in India from Mauritius. Shipp had thus performed the unique feat of twice winning a commission from the ranks before he was thirty-two.<br>
<br>Shipp distinguished himself greatly by his bravery in the second campaign of the Anglo-Nepal War, notably in a single combat with one of the enemy's <i>sirdars</i> near Makwanpur. He was on the staff of the left division of the &#145;grand army&#146; under the marquess of Hastings in the Third Anglo-Maratha War (1817&#150;18), and was promoted lieutenant on 5 July 1821. He seems to have been popular in his regiment for his bravery; but during 1822, while quartered at Calcutta, he was inveigled into a series of turf speculations which proved disastrous. Shipp imprudently commented in writing on the behaviour of a superior officer in regard to these transactions, and was discharged from the service by a court martial held at Fort William, Calcutta, between 14 and 27 July 1823. He was, however, recommended to mercy, &#145;in consideration of his past services and wounds, and the high character that he had borne as an officer and a gentleman&#146;. When he sold out, on 3 November 1825, the East India Company granted him a pension of &pound;50, upon which he settled near Ealing, Middlesex.<br>
<br>Shipp then wrote his successful <span class="italic">Memoirs of the Extraordinary Military Career of John Shipp</span> (1829 and later editions), in which he refrained from recriminations. In 1831 he published <span class="italic">Flogging and its Substitute: a Voice from the Ranks</span>, in the form of a letter to Sir Francis Burdett, an indictment of the &#145;cat&#146;, which, as he claimed, &#145;flogged one devil out and fifty devils in&#146;. Burdett sent him &pound;50, and most of his suggestions were later adopted by the military authorities. In 1830 Shipp was offered an inspectorship in the Stepney division of the new Metropolitan Police by Sir Charles Rowan; he was shortly afterwards appointed superintendent of the night watch at Liverpool, and in 1833 was elected master of the workhouse at Liverpool, where he was reportedly highly esteemed. He died at Liverpool, in comfortable circumstances, on 27 April 1834, and was buried in Liverpool.<br>
<br>Shipp was married twice, first, in 1816 in Cawnpore, to Anne. She died in 1823 or 1824, in childbirth, aged twenty-two, and the two sons from the marriage were adopted. Shipp remarried, probably in 1826. There were children from the second marriage. His second wife survived him.<br>
