<span class="headword">Okes,  Richard</span>  (1797&#150;1888), <span class="occ">college head</span>, was the son of Thomas Verney Okes, a surgeon in extensive practice at Cambridge. Of his twenty children, Richard was the nineteenth, and was born at Cambridge on 25 December 1797. Richard Porson, the Greek scholar, was a visitor at the house, and took a kindly interest in young Richard. Educated on the foundation at Eton College, where he was contemporary with William Mackworth Praed, Edward Stanley (later Lord Derby, the premier), E. B. Pusey, and Shelley (who was some years his senior), he proceeded in 1817 to a scholarship at King's College, Cambridge. He was Browne's medallist in 1819 and 1820, graduating BA in 1822, MA in 1825, and DD in 1848. He was a fellow of King's from 1820 to 1826, when he married Mary Elizabeth, daughter of the late Thomas Sibthorpe of Guildford. They had a daughter, Julia Mary Anna.<br>
<br>Okes had been ordained in 1822 and was appointed assistant master at Eton in 1823, and lower master in 1838. During the years of his mastership, and afterwards at Cambridge, he was a conspicuous figure in the school and college world, and innumerable anecdotes grew up round his marked and vivid personality. Many generations of Etonians carried away a lively recollection of his dry and caustic wit, his shrewd remarks, his slow and deliberate speech, his inimitable Latin quotations, drawn chiefly from familiar sources, such as Horace or the Eton Latin grammar, and his curious punctiliousness about minutiae of school discipline, usages, and phraseology. He was a successful tutor, having at times as many as ninety pupils, and impressed his colleagues, as well as the boys, with a strong sense of his painstaking accuracy. During the latter part of Dr Keate's headmastership he took much interest in the improvement of geographical studies by the introduction of the <span class="italic">Compendium of Ancient and Modern Geography</span> (1831) by Aron Arrowsmith the younger, to which he contributed most of the illustrative notes.<br>
<br>On his election to the provostship of King's College in 1850, one of Okes's first acts (1 May 1851) was to abandon the privilege which entitled members of King's College to take the BA degree without examination. The wisdom of this reform was proved by the success of King's men in the tripos lists. This important innovation, however, marked the limit of his reforming zeal. Although his provostship coincided with the introduction of great changes in the university and his college, Okes was a conservative in principle and feeling and could not always agree with reforms such as the opening of King's to men from schools other than Eton; he nevertheless took part loyally in the introduction and conduct of such changes and presided over the college with much dignity and kindliness for thirty-eight years. The year following his appointment as provost he filled the office of vice-chancellor, but after the expiration of his year of office he could never again be induced to serve. He was the editor of a new series of <span class="italic">Musae Etonenses</span> for 1796&#150;1833 (2 vols., 1859&#150;69), which he enriched with sketches of the authors written in Latin, full of felicitous and witty phrases. The heraldic window in the school museum at Eton was his gift in conjunction with Dr E. C. Hawtrey. He was chairman of the Cambridge Waterworks Company from 1858 to 1887, and was a JP for the borough of Cambridge. He died at The Lodge, King's College, Cambridge, on 25 November 1888, and was buried in King's College chapel. His wife predeceased him.<br>
