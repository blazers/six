</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Marson,  Una Maud Victoria</span>  (1905&#150;1965), <span class="occ">writer and feminist</span>, was born on 6 February 1905 at Sharon Mission House, Sharon village, near Santa Cruz, St Elizabeth, Jamaica, the youngest of the six children of Solomon Isaac Marson (1858&#150;1915), Baptist minister, and his wife, Ada Marson (<i>d</i>. 1930). Solomon Marson was a respected and charismatic preacher. He remained the minister at the Sharon Mission House until his death in 1915, when the family was forced to move to Kingston. Una Marson planned, but never wrote, her autobiography, using the title &#145;Autobiography of a brown girl&#146;, but there is evidence that she was very attached to her father and profoundly affected by his death. There is little information available about her relations with her mother.<br>
<br>From 1915 to 1922, with the help of a Free Foundationers scholarship, Una Marson attended Hampton high school, a fee-paying boarding-school in Malvern, Jamaica, modelled closely on the English public-school system. Of her time at this school, Marson writes nostalgically in a poem, &#145;To Hampton&#146;:<blockquote>
<div>How oft in dreams I live those days again,<br>
</div>
<div>Chasing a hockey ball with might and main,<br>
</div>
<div>Or sit and list without a thought of fear<br>
</div>
<div>To dearest Mona reading great Shakespeare.<br>
</div> (Marson, <span class="italic">Tropic Reveries</span>, 70)</blockquote>Her biographer, however, has suggested that this idealized view of Hampton is qualified by comments made in Marson's unpublished papers which attest to the snobbery and racism endemic in a colonial school, whose intake was predominantly white and privileged and where the &#145;dark-skinned scholarship girl&#146;, Una, was snubbed  (Jarrett-Macaulay, 19). Marson gained the Oxford and Cambridge Board's lower certificate (letters) in 1921, pursued commercial skills, and left Hampton in 1922 with satisfactory but unexceptional academic qualifications.<br>
<br>Una Marson's first job, with the Salvation Army in Kingston, allowed her to make use of her secretarial skills and to develop her commitment to, and interest in, helping the large numbers of Jamaica's unemployed and socially disadvantaged. After a year with the Salvation Army, Marson took a job with the newly established YMCA, and it was not until 1926, when she was made assistant editor of the socio-political monthly journal <span class="italic">Jamaica Critic</span>, that Marson was able to develop her writing talent. In 1928 she started the magazine <span class="italic">The Cosmopolitan</span>, becoming the first Jamaican woman to edit her own publication. Thereafter Marson consolidated her interest in Jamaican culture and her commitment to promoting women's rights in an impressive variety of ways and in diverse contexts.<br>
<br>In June 1932 Marson's play <span class="italic">At What a Price</span> was staged in Jamaica and with the profits generated from it she travelled to England in July 1932. In London she became involved with the League of Coloured Peoples and in November 1933 <span class="italic">At What a Price</span> was performed by an all-league cast and was hailed as the first play by &#145;coloured colonials&#146; to be staged in London. In 1935 she was the first, and only, black representative to take part in the First International Women's Conference, held in Turkey. In 1935 Marson took up a post at the League of Nations headquarters in Geneva where, in 1936, she acted as Haile Selassie's secretary in his negotiations with the League of Nations. On her return to Jamaica in 1936 she founded the Readers and Writers Club and the Kingston Dramatic Club, and two of her plays, <span class="italic">London Calling</span> and <span class="italic">Pocomania</span>, were performed; the latter was extremely successful and was hailed as indicating the future trajectory of a truly Jamaican theatre. In March 1941, appointed as full-time programme assistant on the BBC Empire Service, Marson comp&egrave;red and co-ordinated a series of programmes, <span class="italic">Calling the West Indies</span>, which continued until her return to Jamaica in 1945. In 1960 she was briefly (and secretively) married to Peter Staples, a dentist. There were no children, and they separated in 1961.<br>
<br>Marson's commitment as a feminist and nationalist activist in Britain, the West Indies, and further afield has earned her a considerable reputation as a pioneering figure in Jamaican cultural history and, increasingly, in accounts of black British history. Una Marson refused to accept the limits and constraints of her time which relegated her, as a black woman, to the margins of cultural activity. She published four collections of poetry: <span class="italic">Tropic Reveries</span> (1930), <span class="italic">Heights and Depths</span> (1931), <span class="italic">The Moth and the Star</span> (1937), and <span class="italic">Towards the Stars</span> (1945). Though uneven in quality, these works attest to Marson's defiance, vitality, and restless energy.<br>
<br>While many of Marson's poems reveal her indebtedness to canonical English poets, her work experiments with poetic voices and themes which both challenge and subvert canonical notions of the poetic. In &#145;Black is Fancy&#146; she asserts her poetic agenda with disarming clarity and panache:<blockquote>
<div>I used to feel ugly<br>
</div>
<div>I was so ugly<br>
</div>
<div>Because I am black,<br>
</div>
<div>But now I am glad I am black,<br>
</div>
<div>There is something about me<br>
</div>
<div>That has a dash in it<br>
</div>
<div>Especially when I put on<br>
</div>
<div>My bandana.<br>
</div> (Marson, <span class="italic">Moth and Star</span>, 75)</blockquote>Marson wrote many deeply ambivalent poems of love in which she explored the pleasures&#151;and pain&#151;of living as a single woman. She died on 6 May 1965 in Kingston, Jamaica, after suffering a heart attack, and was buried at St Andrew's Church in Kingston on 10 May.<br>
