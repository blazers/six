<span class="headword">Roberts,  Ellis</span> <span class="st"> [<em>known as </em>Elis y Cowper]</span>  (<em>c.</em>1712&#150;1789), <span class="occ">Welsh-language writer</span>, was born in the vicinity of Bala. By 1753, and possibly as early as 1742, he had settled in Llanddoged, near Llanrwst, in the Vale of Conwy, where he worked as a cooper (whence his sobriquet). He was a prolific writer of interludes, ballads, and letters.<br>
<br>In his introduction to <span class="italic">Gras a Natur</span> (&#145;Grace and nature&#146;), published in 1769, Elis claimed to have served his fellow countrymen for a period of thirty-eight years and to have composed sixty-nine interludes, not such a great feat in view of his statement that <span class="italic">Gras a Natur</span> took no more than three days to complete (&#145;Nid oedd y cwbwl &hellip; ond gwaith tridie&#146;). However, only nine of his interludes, composed in the period 1753&#150;89, remain either in manuscript or in print.<br>
<br>Elis's earliest interludes present two stock characters, the miser and the jester, and dramatize the traditional antagonism between the two. The miser is shown being deceived not only by the jester and deprived of his wealth but also by his newly wedded wife, who is about to give birth to the jester's offspring. <span class="italic">Pleser a gofid</span> marks a turning point. This and later works are characterized by their moral content and by the gradual demotion of the miser to the role of a mere spectator. Elis comments freely on moral matters, and on religious and social issues, notably the state of the church and the greed of landowners, but his hurried compositions lack the consistency of thought found in the works of Twm o'r Nant, the most prominent Welsh interlude writer.<br>
<br>The frequency with which his actors sing is another feature of Elis's works. The songs included in the interludes correspond closely to the ballads which were in vogue in eighteenth-century Wales, and on the basis of the material which remains in print&#151;his ballads appear in no fewer than 165 ballad books&#151;no author can claim to have been as productive. His subjects encompass accidents and murders in their most gruesome details, current affairs and fashions, and love both romantic and lewd. The moralizing voice heard in the interludes is rarely silent in the ballads.<br>
<br>It is this voice which is heard in a series of nine letters published between 1771 and 1783. These are long, scarcely punctuated statements which abound with biblical quotations and verbal rhetoric, but which, in spite of their solemn titles&#151;the fifth was promoted as <span class="italic">Difrifol fyfyrdod am farwolaeth</span> (&#145;Serious meditation upon death&#146;)&#151;struck a chord and appealed to the population at large. Individual letters were reprinted&#151;the sixth appeared on eight occasions&#151;and the letters were published as a collection in 1794.<br>
<br>Elis was married four times, and had at least ten children, although little is known about his marriages. His first wife, who came from Bala, died within thirty months of their marriage. He and his second wife, Elin, had a child who was baptized in 1742. Another child, of Elis and his third wife, Elizabeth, was baptized in 1753. In 1765 a child from his fourth marriage, to Grace, was baptized.<br>
<br>The popularity of the letters, ballads, and interludes made Elis y Cowper a household name throughout north Wales during the course of the eighteenth century. He has been seen, however, by subsequent generations through the eyes of the circle of poets and antiquarians surrounding the Morris brothers, especially the poet Goronwy Owen, who narrowly escaped being thrashed by Elis when the two met on one occasion in Llanrwst. Owen's colourful comments must be considered in the light of this unfortunate encounter, but Elis y Cowper is also made to symbolize the deterioration in poetic standards which had taken place since the sixteenth century, and which the Morrisians vigorously sought to remedy. Elis died on 27 November 1789, aged about seventy-six, and was buried at Llanddoged on 1 December. He was survived by his fourth wife, Grace.<br>
