<span class="headword">McIlquham <span class="st"> [M'Ilquham; <em>n&eacute;e </em>Medley]</span>,  Harriett</span>  (1837&#150;1910), <span class="occ">local politician and suffragist</span>, was born on 8 August 1837 at 41 Brick Lane, Old Street, London, the daughter of Edward Medley, master baker, and Harriet Medley, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Sanders. She spent her early life in London, and was reared in a Unitarian family in an atmosphere conducive to freedom of thought. Encouraged to take an interest in public questions, she read advanced literature, attended lectures by eminent Victorian radicals, and, like other young women with a social conscience, turned to parish visiting. Her liberal upbringing and exposure to radical thought thus sowed the seeds of a life devoted to progressive social reform and the political emancipation of women. Upon marriage to James Henry McIlquham (<i>b</i>. 1832/3), surveyor to the Cheltenham improvement commissioners, on 23 September 1858, in the Finsbury Chapel, London, she moved to Gloucestershire, where she resided for the rest of her life. Their union produced two sons, Gilbert and Harold, and two daughters, Mary and Harriett. After an initial stay in Cheltenham, in 1869 Harriett purchased an estate at nearby Staverton, which she personally managed as a working farm. For the next forty years she gave her considerable energies to raising the children, managing the estate, and a life of public work that encompassed pioneering service in local government and a vigorous commitment to women's emancipation.<br>
<br>McIlquham's initial encounter with women's suffrage occurred upon hearing George Jacob Holyoake lecture in 1856, and she was also present in the House of Commons when the first women's suffrage bill was talked out by opponents. Her main organizational activities centred on Gloucestershire: with Henry's assistance and support she assiduously promoted the issue at innumerable public meetings, and was a key member of the Cheltenham Women's Suffrage Society in later years. However, she also contributed to the great demonstrations of 1880&#150;81 in both Birmingham and Bristol, working with activists such as Lilias Ashurst and Helen Blackburn. Her speaking gifts, and later her writings, helped to make her a national figure. The division in the suffrage movement in the 1880s over strategy saw her take a leading role in the formation of the London-based Women's Franchise League (WFL) in 1889, which was uncompromising in its insistence that every suffrage bill should specifically include married women; Harriett firmly believed that their exclusion would render coverture a statutory disability. Other members included Elizabeth Wolstenholme Elmy, a close friend, with whom she helped to establish the Women's Emancipation Union in 1892 after a split with the WFL, and shared an interest in reform of marriage and the divorce laws; her article &#145;Marriage: a just and honourable partnership&#146; appeared in the <span class="italic">Westminster Review</span> (157, April 1902).<br>
<br>In the field of local government Harriett McIlquham was a true pioneer. In 1881 she was elected by a large majority as poor-law guardian for Boddington in the Tewkesbury Union, thus becoming the first married woman guardian in the country. Local government law <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> the position of women was full of anomalies: although the clerk of the union refused to allow her to vote in respect of her own property because she was married, he none the less let her nomination go forward. When the result was contested, the Local Government Board ruled that on the question of the election of married women it saw no reason why Mrs McIlquham should not &#145;lead the way&#146;. Many other women, married and unmarried, followed in her footsteps, although not until the <span class="roman">Local Government Act</span> of 1894 were the rights of married women both to vote and serve enshrined in statute. Harriett continued to blaze a trail: she was subsequently appointed an overseer for the parish of Staverton, a unique position for a woman to hold, became the first chair of Staverton parish council in 1894, and served as returning officer at the second parish council election. She also acted as rural district councillor for Boddington, served on the Boddington and Staverton school board, and after the 1902 <span class="roman">Education Act</span> sat on the board of management of the education committee. In 1888 she was one of four women selected by campaigners to test the eligibility of women to sit on the new county councils: she stood unsuccessfully as an independent in the central ward of Cheltenham, which proved to be the only failure in a distinguished career in which she &#145;abundantly vindicated women's claim to a share in every branch of local government work&#146;  (<span class="italic">Cheltenham Chronicle</span>).<br>
<br>In the 1890s Harriett McIlquham worked with other campaigners in the National Union of Women Workers, the Women's Local Government Society, and the Women's Emancipation Union, publishing under its aegis several pamphlets on the themes of women's work in local government and the franchise, such as <span class="italic">Women's Enfranchisement: an Ancient Right, a Modern Need</span> (<i>c</i>.1892). A well-known figure at conferences, she read papers on suffrage, local government, and the poor law. She also contributed articles to the <span class="italic">Westminster Review</span> and the <span class="italic">Nineteenth Century</span>, including a series of original and scholarly essays on the history of feminist writing, an example being &#145;Mary Astell: a seventeenth century advocate for women&#146;  (<span class="italic">Westminster Review</span>, 149, April 1898).<br>
<br>Harriett McIlquham remained an active radical in later life, embracing new ideas and new movements. She joined the Cheltenham branch of the Women's Freedom League, became a loyal supporter of the local Independent Labour Party, and was a leading light of the Cheltenham Ethical Society, for which she had prepared a paper only days before her death. She died of heart failure on 24 January 1910 at Staverton House and was buried three days later in Staverton parish church. Her life was marked by great generosity to friends and colleagues, and by a vigorous belief in the political emancipation of women.<br>
