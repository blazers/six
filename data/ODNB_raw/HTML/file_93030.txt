<span class="headword">Ruck,  Peter Frederick  Carter-</span>  (1914&#150;2003), <span class="occ">solicitor</span>, was born on 26 February 1914 at 14 Goldstone Villas, Hove, the only son of Frederick Henry Carter Ruck, surveyor and property dealer, and his wife, Nellie Mabel, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Allen. He was educated at St Edward's School, Oxford. Articled straight from school, he qualified as a solicitor in 1937, and joined the small legal firm of Oswald Hickson, Collier &amp; Co. During the Second World War he served in the Royal Artillery as an anti-aircraft gunner, based mainly in Scotland, then as an instructor in gunnery. He was demobilized in 1944 with the rank of captain. Meanwhile, on 6 July 1940 he had married (Pamela) Ann Maxwell, the nineteen-year-old daughter of Group Captain Reginald Stuart Maxwell, RAF officer. (By the time of his marriage he and his parents had adopted a hyphenated surname; and his mother was now known as Nell.) They had a son, Brian, and a daughter, Julie.<br>
<br>Following his demobilization Carter-Ruck returned to the firm of Oswald Hickson, of which he was (following Hickson's death) senior partner from 1945 to 1981. After disagreements and litigation with his partners he established, with characteristic resolution in the same building and in competition with his former partners, his own firm of Peter Carter-Ruck and Partners, of which he was senior partner from 1981 to 1998. He was the defamation specialist member of the Law Society from 1971 to 1984, and wrote a number of books in this field, including <span class="italic">Libel and Slander</span> (1953), which ran to five editions, and <span class="italic">Copyright, Modern Law and Practice</span> (1965). In 1990 he published his autobiography, <span class="italic">Memoirs of a Libel Lawyer</span>.<br>
<br>For over five decades Carter-Ruck was Britain's best-known libel lawyer. It was no coincidence that his telex answerback was Libel-G and that he chose to use the personalized number plate L1BEL for his Rolls-Royce Silver Shadow. Increasingly, he became the man to whom aggrieved politicians and celebrities turned when they felt they had been libelled. His soft-spoken, polite manner masked a steely determination and tenacity. Fleet Street editors came to recognize the yellow solicitors' notepaper which complained, often with tortured syntax, of libels of the utmost gravity and demanded aggravated damages to compensate Carter-Ruck's clients for the harm he said the libel was calculated to cause them. Carter-Ruck's practice was to issue a writ even before sending the letter of complaint, the better, he claimed, to focus the libeller's mind on the need to resolve the matter. Cynics claimed this was a tactic to increase legal costs. At the end of the list of demands in such letters was his requirement that all his legal costs were to be paid by the offending publication. So long as he won cases for his renowned clientele ranging from Randolph Churchill to Harold Wilson, and from Lucian Freud to Sir James Goldsmith to Princess Elizabeth of Toro, the level of these costs was of no concern to his clients, as Carter-Ruck would successfully ensure their swift vindication and receipt of libel damages, and would recover his sizeable legal costs from the erring publication.<br>
<br>Carter-Ruck enjoyed a high level of success in his cases. In the libel field this was exemplified by the &pound;50,000 damages obtained in 1972 by the pilot Edward Prchal who was falsely accused in Rolf Hochhuth's play <span class="italic">The Soldiers</span> of being involved in a plot to kill the Polish leader General Sikorski in 1943 in a plane crash off Gibraltar. The playwright appeared to believe all participants in this wartime tragedy were dead. Prchal, however, had survived, and was living in California. Carter-Ruck was able to discredit Hochhuth's thesis and by this route to vindicate even the reputation of those who died in the plane crash and who would not have been able to bring a libel action to vindicate their reputation. In the copyright field one of his notable triumphs was to secure in a series of cases in the 1960s and 1970s the rights of the screenwriter Kevin McClory not only in what was to have been the original James Bond film, <span class="italic">Thunderball</span>, but also in a sequel, <span class="italic">Never Say Never Again</span>. He also advised on the successful publication of Vladimir Nabokov's <span class="italic">Lolita</span> in the teeth of threats of an obscenity prosecution. In such a high-profile field the relatively rare failures were gleefully publicized, notably by the satirical magazine <span class="italic">Private Eye</span> which had nearly been put out of business at its birth by Carter-Ruck's aggressive tactics on behalf of Randolph Churchill&#151;he used to retain every QC to prevent them advising <span class="italic">Private Eye</span>. <span class="italic">Private Eye</span> responded by an all too deliberate misspelling of his surname.<br>
<br>In the latter part of Carter-Ruck's career he departed from his own rule of persuading clients not to sue unless they had an 80 per cent chance of success, and the last few years of his practice saw some uncharacteristic failures in cases which perhaps need not have been brought. Jani Allen, a South African journalist, failed to prove that she had been libelled when accused of an affair with an extreme right-wing politician. The journalist Derek Jameson failed in his complaint against a satirical radio programme on the BBC that had poked gentle fun at him. Jameson's case ended in considerable acrimony, with Jameson complaining of Carter-Ruck's over-optimistic advice and of his concealment of the barrister's more gloomy but realistic assessment of the case. There was also an acrimonious dispute about the fees Carter-Ruck was charging. Carter-Ruck found himself once more in dispute with the partners of his eponymous firm, but with the tenacity that characterized his sixty years in the law he joined another law firm, Pellys, in Bishop's Stortford, Hertfordshire, at the age of eighty-six, while the firm he had founded proceeded without him.<br>
<br>While exploiting the plaintiff-friendly English libel laws for his clients, Carter-Ruck advocated reform of those laws in order to strike a fairer balance in favour of freedom of speech. He also argued that legal aid should be available for libel and slander cases; and that the Court of Appeal should have the right to vary libel damages. He served on the council of Justice from 1968, and on the Law Society's law reform committee from 1980 to 1983. Outside the law he was a distinguished ocean yachtsman with a series of boats called <i>Fair Judgment</i>. He personally restored a ruined croft in Ardnamurchan and owned properties in London, Hertfordshire, and Marbella. His interests included cinematography, woodturning, and water-divining. He remained active until shortly before his death, on 19 December 2003, at his home, Latchmore Cottage, Latchmore Bank, Little Hallingbury, Essex, of bronchial cancer. He was survived by his daughter, Julie (also a libel lawyer); his wife, Ann, had died earlier that year, and his son, Brian, had died in 1973.<br>
