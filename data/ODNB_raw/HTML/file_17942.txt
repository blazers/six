<span class="headword">Manlove,  Edward</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1615, <em>d.</em> 1671), <span class="occ">lawyer and poet</span>, was baptized on 6 April 1615 at Tettenhall, Staffordshire, the second son of Rowland Manlove, gentleman, of Wanfield in the parish of Kynaston, Staffordshire, and his wife, Magdalen, the daughter of William Wyke of Shifnal, Shropshire. He entered the Middle Temple in May 1635 and was called to the bar in June 1642. He settled at Ashbourne in Derbyshire. A parliamentary supporter during the civil war, Manlove served on a number of local committees during the Commonwealth and was made a JP for Derbyshire in 1648. He proved an energetic magistrate suppressing profaneness and irreligion. He was included in a list of Derbyshire gentlemen and &#145;how they stand affected&#146;, drawn up in the autumn of 1662, when he was described as a Presbyterian  (Newton, 8).<br>
<br>Manlove was actively engaged in lead mining, owning a number of rakes (veins), and serving as steward of the barmote court of the wapentake of Wirksworth. In 1653 he published the <span class="italic">Liberties and Customes of the Lead-Mines within the Wapentake of Wirksworth</span>, which, drawing on exchequer rolls and inquisitions, provided a description of the laws and customs of the court with comprehensive references to the legal evidence in the margin. The work was a remarkable achievement for it provided an accurate digest of the voluminous detail of mining customs cast into 300 lines of verse to assist the illiterate miner in memorizing them. By the eighteenth century the rhyming verses were being cited as evidence of custom. A further edition, though inaccurate, was published at Wirksworth in 1809, and a modern edition with an introduction and glossary by Thomas Tapping in 1851.<br>
<br>Manlove also published a volume of poems, <span class="italic">Divine contentment, or, A medicine for a discontented man: A confession of faith, and other poems</span> (1667). The poems were on such subjects as effectual calling, justification, saving grace, keeping the sabbath, and &#145;the Misery of Man, not Reconciled to God in Christ&#146;  (p. 45), which although revealing of Manlove's godliness have little poetic value. A final section consists of &#145;Poems Against Popery&#146;, involving a conventional protestant attack on the supposed tenets of Catholicism, and also poetic epitaphs for two local worthies, Anne Cockaine (<i>d</i>. 1664) and William Waine, vicar of Ashbourne. It has been suggested that Manlove is the &#145;Philanthropus&#146; (that is, Man Love), friend of Mark Hildesley, the compiler of a manuscript volume of &#145;Essayes and contemplations, divine, morall, and miscellaneous, in prose and meter&#146; (Harley MS 4726), but the ascription is dated 1694, twenty years after Manlove's death.<br>
<br>Manlove married first Catherine, daughter of Paul Hull of Ashbourne, and second Timothee, daughter of John Pearce of Lewes, Sussex. Both predeceased him. There were four sons and three daughters from each marriage. Manlove's published writings and activity on the bench indicate that he was a godly gentleman convinced of the existence of an elect and who believed in a national church and a preaching ministry. In his will he committed his soul to God &#145;trustinge to bee saved by the meritte of Jesus Christ&#146; and gave instructions for his children to be brought up &#145;in the feare of god&#146;  (will). He had divinity as well as law books in his study. There is however no evidence that he supported nonconformity. He is not recorded in the 1669 Conventicle returns as hosting a meeting, but his son <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17943/', "Timothy Manlove")</script> was one of the second generation of Presbyterian ministers. Edward Manlove died in late 1671.<br>
