<span class="headword">Hill,  Philip Ernest</span>  (1873&#150;1944), <span class="occ">property developer and financier</span>, was born at 8 Scarborough Terrace, Torquay, on 11 April 1873, the younger son and youngest of three children of Philip Hill (1839&#150;1922), cab proprietor, and his wife, Mary Smith (1830&#150;1883), a lodging-house keeper. His mother died when he was ten, his only sister subsequently bringing him up. In 1886 he entered Taunton Independent college, where he received a good commercial education. At the age of sixteen he became a junior in a Newton Abbot estate agency. In 1892 he sought adventure by joining the army, but purchased his discharge two years later, just before the regiment was posted overseas. He resumed his estate agent's career, this time in Cardiff, where he married, in 1897, Katherine Keziah, daughter of Thomas Evans, a Cardiff gentleman.<br>
<br>After his only child&#151;a daughter&#151;had died, aged six, of meningitis (his wife died a little later), Hill moved to London in 1912. Aware that London agents were far better remunerated than those in the provinces, and that an exclusive locality greatly improved the chances of making good, he set up as an estate agent and valuer at 42 Albemarle Street, just off Piccadilly. He did well, but was less successful as a public works contractor during the First World War, erecting camps and portable buildings for the government. He thus emerged at the end of the war with a substantial bank overdraft, which was not fully repaid until 1922.<br>
<br>In 1917 he married for the second time; his second wife was Jessica Gertrude (daughter of Richard Gerrard, civil engineer), an actress and formerly the wife of Eric Spencer Wentworth Fitzwilliam (later the ninth Earl Fitzwilliam). She introduced Hill to London caf&eacute; society, but they were divorced in 1922. That same year he married the actress Vera Blanche Neville (daughter of Alfred Neville Snepp, cigarette manufacturer), the former wife of Henry Algernon Claude Graves (later the seventh Baron Graves), a bookmaker.<br>
<br>Hill entered the world of corporate finance and takeovers in 1923, as adviser to the Beecham family, whose pill-making firm had become entangled in property affairs after the purchase in 1914 by Sir Joseph Beecham (1848&#150;1916) of the Covent Garden estate in London. By 1924 Hill had completed the buying out of the family interests and he helped to establish Beecham Estates and Pills Ltd. He carried out the first major flotation of a company on his own behalf in 1927, when he obtained control of Taylors Drug Company Ltd and other retail chemists' chains, following this up in 1928 with the acquisition of Timothy Whites Ltd. In the same year, by an adroit property deal, he divided the two not very compatible sides of the Beecham company into separate enterprises, becoming chairman of both.<br>
<br>Of these enterprises, the Covent Garden Properties Company Ltd concentrated entirely on general estates business. Hill's plan for the newly registered Beechams Pills Ltd was to build it up into the largest patent medicine and household goods company in Britain. Having already acquired the ailing Veno Drug Company Ltd, in 1938&#150;9 he strengthened Beechams by purchasing on its behalf the firms which manufactured Macleans toothpaste and powders, Eno's fruit salts (which had substantial overseas assets), and the hair preparation Brylcreem. His interest in research and development for this company sprang from his friendship with the medical scientist Sir Edward Charles Dodds; and in 1936 Beechams endowed a laboratory for primary research at the Royal Northern Hospital, London. Accepting that the long-term prosperity of Beechams Pills lay in the development of ethical medicines, in 1942 Hill authorized the establishment of Beecham Research Laboratories. On these foundations his successor, Henry George Leslie Lazell (1903&#150;1982), converted the renamed Beecham group into a major pharmaceutical company (from 1989 onwards SmithKline Beecham plc).<br>
<br>In 1929 Hill became a director of the Eagle Star Insurance Company which, during Britain's economic recovery in the 1930s, grew rapidly into a leading financial institution with considerable funds to invest. His reputation was such that in 1930 the chancellor of the exchequer, Philip Snowden, appointed him to a committee to assess the extent and use, and possible sale, of government property holdings. With the support of Eagle Star's chairman, Sir Edward Mountain, in 1932&#150;3 he set up Philip Hill &amp; Partners (which later became, through amalgamation in the 1950s and 1960s, the merchant bank Hill Samuel), and the Second Covent Garden Property Company (which eventually became part of MEPC plc), to finance industrial ventures and commercial properties respectively.<br>
<br>In 1933 Hill suffered the one major commercial reverse in an otherwise highly successful career: his failure to purchase Boots Pure Drug Company Ltd, which he had intended to be the core of a rationalized multiple chemists' combine in Britain. Boots, earlier controlled by the United Drug Company of America, was being sold back into British hands. Hill made an acceptable bid, only to be overruled by the Treasury, which refused to sanction the required dollars under emergency regulations introduced during the national economic crisis of 1931.<br>
<br>Among Hill's other property interests were those connected with the steadily growing leisure market in Britain. He secured a large stake in cinemas, most notably in Odeon Theatres Ltd, and acquired the Olympia exhibition centre in West Kensington. In 1935 he helped to form the Hawker Siddeley Aircraft Company Ltd, and thus facilitated the development of the Hurricane aircraft which fought in the battle of Britain (1940).<br>
<br>Hill's practice was to buy companies for cash, which he raised by issuing shares taken up mainly by financial institutions. However, he seldom subjected his acquisitions to a thoroughgoing internal restructuring, which many of them needed. He was extremely successful in selecting businesses and properties, able to make an instinctive judgement of their value, but he was less successful in his choice of managers; he behaved fairly but strictly towards employees, perhaps showing excessive loyalty to under-performing subordinates.<br>
<br>In the world of finance, Hill's business skills and integrity earned him wide respect. He could make bold decisions with great speed, and his word was always his bond. A strong personality reinforced his large physical presence (in later life he weighed 18 stone). His rule in life was &#145;start early and work late&#146;, and with so many business commitments, opportunities for recreation were necessarily limited. Latterly, however, in the pre-war years, he often spent several winter months in the West Indies or Florida, while keeping in regular touch with his businesses. He had boxed during his brief spell in the army, and in later life he was a golfer and an expert at the game of poker, thanks to his long experience of cliffhanging property deals. He also enjoyed gossiping about money matters with chosen associates, was a reader of thrillers, and a film addict. On a higher cultural level, in 1944 his initiative ensured that the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, would return to its proper function after wartime use as a dance hall.<br>
<br>About 1930, after separating from his wife Vera, Hill began living with Phyllis Lytton, daughter of Reuben Partington, manufacturer's agent. A one-time dancer and in 1930 a racehorse owner twenty-five years his junior, she changed her name to Hill, married him in 1934, and gave him ten years of happiness. There were no children of the last three marriages. Hill died of prostate cancer on 15 August 1944 at his home, Windlesham Moor, Sunninghill Road, Windlesham, Surrey, survived by his fourth wife.<br>
