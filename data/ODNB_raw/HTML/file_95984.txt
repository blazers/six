<span class="headword">Frend,  William Hugh Clifford</span>  (1916&#150;2005), <span class="occ">church historian</span>, was born on 11 January 1916 at the Vicarage, Shottermill, Haslemere, Surrey, the youngest of four children, a late child and second son, of Edwin George Clifford Frend (1871&#150;1937), a high-church Anglican vicar, and his wife, Edith, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Bacon (1877&#150;1966). He was baptized by his father in St Stephen's parish church, Shottermill, on 2 March 1916. An uncle, John Palliser Frend, was also a clergyman. The cleric William Frend (1757&#150;1841), controversialist in politics and theology, was a great-great-uncle.<br>
<br>After Fernden School and Haileybury College, Frend went to Keble College, Oxford, to read modern history, a curriculum that enabled his participation in the Augustine seminar of the professor of divinity, F. L. Cross. He graduated with a first-class degree in 1937, and won a Craven fellowship for graduate research in classical antiquity. This enabled him to study at the Humboldt University, Berlin, which exposed him to challenging standards. After the iconic figures of Adolf von Harnack and Karl Holl, Hans Lietzmann carried the torch of thesis history rather than conviction history. Frend attended his <i>Oberseminar</i>. Lietzmann's influence was formative. He endorsed the interweaving of literary and material sources and pointed to models. He helped Frend shape as his project the socio-economic context of Donatist religious dissent in north Africa, and supported his trip to Tunisia to study early Christian archaeological sites. Frend's thesis (for which he was awarded an Oxford DPhil in 1940) was co-supervised externally by the London Byzantinist and official translator of Hitler's speeches, Norman H. Baynes. The thesis evolved into a groundbreaking book, <span class="italic">The Donatist Church</span> (1952), which concentrated on non-theological dimensions.<br>
<br>During the Second World War Frend worked successively in the War Office, the Cabinet Office, and the Foreign Office, in political intelligence, and in the latter part of the war was posted to north Africa, Italy, and Austria. He was decorated by the Polish government-in-exile. He remained with the Foreign Office until 1947, when he became an army officer, and for the next four years he helped analyse seized German foreign ministry documents. He was proud of his war effort, not sharing early Christian dissent on matters of military service. On 2 June 1951 he married Mary Grace Crook (1928&#150;2002), daughter of Eric Ashley Crook, surgeon. They had a son, Simon, and a daughter, Sally. Frend's wife's family had historical Quaker associations (as indeed the Frend family had too) so that even his marriage was perhaps a symptom of his fondness for dissent.<br>
<br>After a brief spell as research fellow at Nottingham University (1951&#150;2), from 1952 to 1969 Frend's seminal work on the frontiers between archaeology, church history, and theology was done at Cambridge, based at Gonville and Caius College, of which he was a bye-fellow from 1952 and fellow from 1956. He also lectured in the divinity faculty. He published <span class="italic">Martyrdom and Persecution in the Early Church</span> (1965), valuable for source orientation, and <span class="italic">The Early Church</span> (1965), a textbook for students that was popular. In 1966 he was made an Oxford DD. In 1967&#150;8 he gave the Birbeck lectures at Trinity College, Cambridge, later published as <span class="italic">The Rise of the Monophysite Movement</span> (1972). This further exemplified his interest in alternative or submerged Christian traditions.<br>
<br>From 1969 until 1984 Frend was professor of ecclesiastical history at Glasgow in the faculty of divinity, which also incorporated Trinity College (which trained candidates for Church of Scotland ministry, and where his office was located until 1976). The cultural challenge was mutual. His background of English &#145;home counties&#146;, Oxbridge, the Church of England, and civil religion did not fit comfortably into a Scottish university divinity faculty, orientated partly to the Presbyterian ministry, and located in declining industrial Glasgow. Frend remained unreconstructed. Some staff perceived quasi-proconsular attitudes. However, his scholarship excelled&#151;acknowledged by an Edinburgh DD in 1974&#151;and he delighted undergraduates. His service as dean of the divinity faculty from 1972 to 1975 and as (an apparently unlikely) chairman of the Association of University Teachers (Scotland) from 1976 to 1978 was idiosyncratic. Involvement in university politics did not help his discipline, as his chair was suppressed on his retirement. He was and remained incandescent, although he magnanimously made a bequest to Glasgow University in his will. His earlier foray into Liberal Party politics at Cambridge took a different turn in Glasgow, where he canvassed for a Conservative and Unionist candidate against Roy Jenkins in 1982. He found Glasgow tenement politics chastening. Moreover, he had security anxieties due to the IRA shadow, since he had a Territorial Decoration and a son on military service in Northern Ireland. He was reassured when told he might only qualify for a &#145;knee job&#146;. Glasgow, however, was the workshop of Frend's magnum opus, <span class="italic">The Rise of Christianity</span> (1984), a huge tome unmatched by any modern English-speaking scholar in the field. It followed his tardy election as a fellow of the British Academy (1983).<br>
<br>On his retirement and return to England in 1984 Frend remained active in research and in church ministry. Ambivalent towards the church and having a reductionist concept of Christianity, his colours were &#145;low church&#146; and &#145;liberal&#146;. He served variously. He had edited the <span class="italic">Modern Churchman</span> (1963&#150;82). A Church of England lay reader since 1956, he later became a deacon (1983) and minister (1984) of the Scottish Episcopal Church, serving in Aberfoyle parish. He then became priest-in-charge of the linked parishes of Barnwell with Thurning and Luddington in Peterborough diocese until 1990. Thereafter he officiated intermittently as assistant priest in the Fulbourn group of parishes in the diocese of Ely. Mildly Trollopian, he focused more on pastoral work than on order, liturgy, or preaching, but a humane spirit made him effective in that role.<br>
<br>Other marks of esteem were Frend's fellowships of the Society of Antiquaries (a society for which he later endowed the Frend medal for archaeology), the Royal Historical Society, and the Royal Society of Edinburgh. He served on committees of national and international learned societies. As president of the International Commission for Comparative Ecclesiastical History (1980) he refused the affiliation of a South African society on the grounds of its failure to reflect ethnic and denominational diversity. He was nevertheless a guest lecturer in South Africa as well as in the USA. One such lecture-set became his attractive <span class="italic">Saints and Sinners in the Early Church</span> (1985). He was on the editorial board of <span class="italic">The Coptic Encylopedia</span>.<br>
<br>Frend's self-appraisal appeared in <span class="italic">From Dogma to History</span> (2003) and in an essay published in <span class="italic">The American Scholar</span> in 1985 on his <span class="italic">The Rise of Christianity</span>. He was a new broom in early church studies. That he was an amusing lecturer and a fluent writer helped. His descent into uncensored history contrasted with the flight from history of many British theological historians. His attention to history's losers or rejects was significant. However, the bifurcation of the subject remained. The interdisciplinary and empirical approaches that he inherited, albeit imperfectly, from Berlin (and ultimately Ranke) were viewed with scepticism. Respected at home, lauded abroad, he did not establish a research school. Paradoxically his last years saw much that he stood for become a new orthodoxy&#151;interdisciplinarity, national and international collaborative projects, research council commitment, and diversified public dissemination.<br>
<br>Burly, mentally agile, charming, prone to seeing red mist, gregarious, and complex, William Frend died at Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge, on 1 August 2005, of heart failure, having lived latterly at Clerk's Cottage, 31 Rectory Farm Road, in Little Wilbraham, Cambridgeshire. His funeral service took place at St John's Church, Little Wilbraham, on 12 August. After the committal at Cambridge crematorium his ashes were interred alongside those of his wife in the churchyard at Barnwell, Northamptonshire. He was survived by his two children.<br>
