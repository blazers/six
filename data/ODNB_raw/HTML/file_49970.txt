<span class="headword">Thorne,  Robert, the elder</span>  (<em>c.</em>1460&#150;1519), <span class="occ">merchant</span>, was the fourth of five sons of Thomas Thorne (<i>d</i>. 1471) of St Albans and his wife, Rose. The family's long-established position in the wine trade of Bristol, Cyprus, Rhodes, and Seville, gave Robert scope for speculative engagement in the sugar trade of the Canaries and the Azores and in stockfish with Iceland from 1479.<br>
<br>Trading intelligence he gained in 1493 in Seville may well have encouraged Thorne to anticipate John Cabot's discovery of Newfoundland in 1497. On the back of a map drawn up in 1577&#150;80 John Dee posited this formal claim to North America by writing &#145;Circa 1494 Mr Robert Thorn his father, and Mr Eliot of Bristow, discovered Newfound Land&#146;  (BL, Cotton Augustus 1.I.i). In 1527 his eldest son, <a href="#cosubject_49970">Robert [<i>see below</i>]</a>, described them as &#145;the discoverers of the Newfound Lands&#146; but in another passage implies they were frustrated by their pilot's behaviour  (BL, Cotton MS Vitellius C. vii, fols. 329&#150;45). In 1501 both men received a bounty for ship construction from Henry VII. On 7 January 1503, with his brother William Thorne and Hugh Elliott, the elder Robert bought shares in a ship built at Dieppe for the wine trade, securing another &pound;20 bounty from Bristol's customs on renaming her the <i>Gabriel</i>. As mayor of Bristol, Robert Thorne received a commission from the lord admiral of England to form Bristol's court of admiralty to act with thirteen others as from 13 May 1510. In 1515&#150;16 he devised city ordinances on metering and aulnage of woollen cloth and linen.<br>
<br>The &#145;great orphan book&#146; of Bristol  (Bristol RO, 04421/1, fols. 141&#150;2) says Robert Thorne &#145;finished his days in London&#146; and transcribes his will, made on 20 January 1518. His wish to be buried in St Nicholas, Bristol, was not met; he was interred in Temple Church, London, where the memorial stone was noted by Richard Hakluyt in <span class="italic">Divers Voyages</span>  (1582, p. 258). His will, proved on 6 July 1519, made many ecclesiastical and charitable bequests for Bristol including a cellar of salt (83 tons worth) for the almshouses of the Three Kings, Greyfriars, and others in Long Row and Newgate, again suggesting a trading interest in salted fish from the Azores, Newfoundland, and Iceland. His widow, Jone or Johane Wytheypolle, in her will of 10 April 1523 left large legacies to their children, Robert, <a href="#cosubject_76000">Nicholas [<i>see below</i>]</a>, and Alice (<i>d</i>. 1548), but little to Ellen, left in the abbess's care at Lacock.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_49970"></a><span class="headword">Robert Thorne the younger</span>  (1492&#150;1532), <span class="occ">merchant</span>, followed his father into the international trade of Seville and Bristol, investing heavily in the woad trade from the Azores and the Canary Islands as well as in pearls, which he bought at Venice and stored in two trunks until his death. In 1523 Thorne the younger became MP for Bristol. On his father's death he inherited &pound;60, much plate, and a home in Seville. His Sevillian business invested 1400 ducats in Sebastian Cabot's ill-fated voyage to the River Plate in 1526&#150;30, also sending two Englishmen, Roger Barlow (<i>d</i>. 1554) and Henry Latimer, as skilled pilots. Although Barlow returned from La Plata with an unfavourable account and the syndicate refused further funds, Robert Thorne kept faith with Roger Barlow.<br>
<br>Thorne's notions of a near polar passage to Cathay were first advanced in royal and diplomatic circles in 1526 to Dr Ley, then Henry VIII's ambassador to the court of the emperor Charles V. Transcribing Thorne's texts as &#145;An information of the lands discovered and of the way to the Moluccas by the north&#146; and &#145;A declaration of the Indies and lands which Robert Thorne discovered&#146; in his <span class="italic">Divers Voyages</span>  (London, 1582, sigs. B1<i>r</i>&#150;D4<i>v</i>), Hakluyt added an engraved version of Thorne's map of 1527  (opposite sig. B4<i>v</i>), while elsewhere  (sig. B3) he cites Thorne's claim that the north-western route would be &#145;nearer by almost two thousand leagues than the southern ones&#146;. This text also speaks of an astrolabe and a chart in use well before 1519 by his father, who &#145;with an[o]ther merchant of Bristol, named Hugh Elliot [were] the discoverers of the Newfounde Lande; for all is one coast as by the carde appeareth&#146;. Robert Thorne's apprentice Emmanuel Lucar (1494&#150;1574) is reported in his old age, while living with his son, Cyprian (1544&#150;1611?) in Botolph's Lane near Aldgate, London, as having a copy of Robert Thorne's text and perhaps the map lent to John Dee at Mortlake in 1577. Dee certainly had the letter from Robert Thorne to Ley copied as the &#145;Declaration of the Indies&#146; (now BL, Cotton MS Vitellius CVII, fols. 329&#150;43, but without the map).<br>
<br>Strype's revision of <span class="italic">The Survey of London</span>  (1720, bk 2, p. 1213), transcribes Thorne's memorial stone in the south choir of St Christopher-le-Stocks, providing his vital dates. That memorial was surpassed by one in the south aisle of Walthamstow church completed in 1535 with &pound;1000 used at the discretion of his executor, Paul Withypoll. Thorne's other executor, his brother Nicholas, dealt with his Bristol estate and his trading partner's commitments, making a detailed inventory and disbursing &pound;16,935 under the terms of the will. This left a residue of &pound;4286 for Nicholas. However, charged to that inheritance there were trading debts in Spain, England, Flanders, and Italy, including debts of adventure in Ancona and for pearls bought in Venice; and the major debts owed in trade with his brother (&pound;4091) plus &pound;94 for a house and slaves in Seville. Robert allocated &pound;3000 to Vincent Thorne&#151;&#145;my sonne being in Spayne&#146;&#151;to be banked in St George of Genoa in the whaling port of St Jean-de-Luz, where Anna Garrera, mother of this illegitimate son, Vincent, was awarded &pound;50 on condition that she renounce any claim to his inheritance should Vincent die before coming of age.<br>
<br>Thorne gave some very large awards to his home city of Bristol, including &pound;100 to five Bristol almshouses, &pound;100 to repair the highways of Bristol, and &pound;100 for the road from Commermarsh to Bristol, plus similar sums to those imprisoned in London and Bristol and other sums to be spent in various parishes in London and Bristol. He gave at least &pound;700 to Thomas and Emmanuel Lucar to spend on worthwhile civic causes, as well as &pound;100 for &#145;the making a place for the merchants of Bristol&#146;. He also gave &pound;300 to relief of the poor of Bristol and &#145;toward the making up of the free scole of Saincte Bartilmews in Brystowe, &pound;300&#146; as well as &pound;25 to Thomas Moffett, first master of that grammar school, and &pound;25 to Moffat's son, Robert. The creation of Bristol's grammar school was an interest he shared with his brother Nicholas from adolescence, as they both tried to establish navigational instruction and foreign language tuition in the city of Bristol. The derelict hospital of St Bartholomew in Christmas Street was converted to a &#145;conveyent Schole house to be for a fre[e] grammar schole to taught and kept within the towne of Bristowe&#146;  (Bristol RO, 04026 (1), fols. 141&#150;2). The idea developed further through a trading partnership with Sebastian Cabot's erstwhile associate, Roger Barlow, and saw more significant steps taken in 1526 and 1530. On 6 October 1532 Robert Thorne added a bequest of &pound;400 towards its rebuilding. Robert's will was entered in the great orphan book and book of wills of Bristol  (Bristol RO, 04026 (1), fols. 139&#150;42) because his civic bequests and initiative in maritime education were thought significant.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_76000"></a><span class="headword">Nicholas Thorne</span>  (1496&#150;1546), <span class="occ">merchant and a founder of Bristol's grammar school</span>, was the younger son of Robert Thorne the elder and Jone (Johane) Wytheypolle. He lived in Aller Court off Small Street, Bristol. Richard Hakluyt records that Nicholas Thorne traded with Thomas Spatcheford to the Canary Islands in 1526 using a ship laden with coarse and fine cloth, both broad and narrow, and also with pack thread and soap  (Hakluyt, <span class="italic">Principal Navigations</span>, 2.2). These cargoes were exchanged for &#145;a good store of Orchell&#146; (woad) as well as sugar, and hundreds of kid skins.<br>
<br>By 1526 Robert Thorne the younger and Nicholas Thorne became co-partners in a Sevillian soap factory. Shortly before 1533 Nicholas joined his factor William Ballard to import wine from the eastern Mediterranean. Actions in the court of exchequer in 1535  (TNA: PRO, E 159/312) allege he exported coloured English cloth without paying export duties.<br>
<br>When Henry VIII visited the manor of Thornbury, near Bristol, for ten days from 18 August 1534, he was escorted by Nicholas Thorne, Thomas White, and the chamberlain of Bristol, and gifts were presented to the king and his queen, Anne Boleyn. Although he was once characterized as a &#145;nigard&#146;  (BL, Cotton MS Cleopatra E. v.361), Nicholas had many children to support&#151;a problem vividly represented on his memorial brass, which records that he died on 19 August 1546 aged fifty, having been lord mayor and having been married twice, with four sons and four daughters (two of whom survived him) through his first marriage, to Mary Wigston, and one son and one daughter, John and Bridget, from his second marriage, to Bridget Miles.<br>
<br>Of Nicholas's sons with his first wife, Robert had children but no obvious wife; Nicholas (<i>d</i>. 1591) had three legitimate children: Edward married Sir William Harper's widow, Margaret; and the youngest, John, was left &pound;100 to invest in Thomas Shipman's shipbuilding business through John Millis of Southampton. To Robert, Nicholas, and Edward, children of his second marriage, Nicholas left his share in another shipbuilding business conducted with Thomas Shipman, then building a ship called the <i>Saviour</i>.<br>
<br>In his will of 4 August 1546, proved on 15 October 1546, Nicholas made provision for his second wife's earlier daughters by her first husband, Alice, Barbara, and Katheryn. He apprenticed his illegitimate Spanish children, Robert and Nicholas Thorne, to William Ostrich of London, haberdasher, paying him &#145;&pound;66 13s 4d, which is to be the keeping of the master to whom Nicholas is prentis for seven years&#146;. That family bond was significant, for it was Henry Ostrich who brought Sebastian Cabot back to Bristol in 1548 at the privy council's charge to inform a strategy of exploiting near polar passages.<br>
<br>Nicholas Thorne's complex will allocated his school &#145;all such books as I have meat for the said library, more my astrolabia, which is the keeping of John Sprynt, [a]poticary, numbers of cardes etc., maps and all such instruments belonging to the science of astronomye or cosmography&#146;  (Bristol RO, 04421, fol. 276). It also provided for coloured glazing of the school's windows. His executor, Robert Barlow (<i>d</i>. 1554), wrote for this college <span class="italic">A Brief Summe of Geographie</span>&#151;a further copy of which he presented to Henry VIII in 1541 (BL, Royal MS 18 B. xxviii). Nicholas provided &pound;20 for a lawyer to vest his school (and 250 tons of salt) in the mayor and commonality, expecting litigation from his illegitimate son, Nicholas Thorne, and John Goodrich over the family wills. Unexpectedly Francis Galliardet of Messina also took action against the heirs of Nicholas Thorne for recovery of his freight on shipping wine from Sicily and Candia (Crete) in the high court of admiralty in 1546  (TNA: PRO, HCA, 24/7 24/17 and 18; HCA 14/3 and 4). None the less the school survived, finally moving to Tyndall's Park, Bristol.<br>
