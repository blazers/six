</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Semprini,  (Fernando Riccardo) Alberto</span>  (1908&#150;1990), <span class="occ">pianist and conductor</span>, was born on 27 March 1908 in Bath, the second of three sons (there were no daughters) of Arturo Riccardo Fernando Semprini, musician, from Rimini, Italy, and his wife, Elizabeth Tilley, opera singer, from Dudley, Worcestershire. The family settled in Bath until Alberto was nine, when his father, a horn player, was appointed librarian to La Scala opera house, Milan. The boy was intensely musical and won a state scholarship to the Conservatorio Verdi to study piano, composition, and conducting. When he was only sixteen Arturo Toscanini, chief conductor of La Scala, auditioned him for the fiendishly difficult orchestral piano part in Igor Stravinsky's ballet <span class="italic">Petrushka</span> and gave him the job.<br>
<br>On his vacations Semprini played the piano on transatlantic liners, and while in New York was enthralled by jazz groups and the popular concert orchestra of Andr&eacute; Kostelanetz. He discovered he could play this sort of repertoire far better than most classically trained pianists, and this seems to have proved a decisive influence in shaping his career. Another consideration was his marriage in Italy in 1931 to Brunilde Regarbagnati and the birth of three sons.<br>
<br>Semprini left the Conservatorio in 1929 with a doctorate of music and, though he occasionally conducted at La Scala and elsewhere, the piano was his first love. In the 1930s he and another Italian pianist, Bormioli, toured Europe as a popular piano duo, and later he formed his own rhythm orchestra in Italy, with which he made records, broadcasted, and played in a number of musical films. The outbreak of war in 1939 halted his career. He had angered the fascist authorities by playing western music against their orders; and though he had dual Italian and British citizenship, both passports were confiscated, obliging the family to keep a low profile. When eventually the allies advanced into southern Italy he managed to get to Rome, where he volunteered for the Entertainments National Service Association (ENSA), and gave many front-line concerts, his piano on the back of an army truck.<br>
<br>Among Semprini's troop audiences was the actor Michael Brennan, who offered to be his manager if he ever came to England. But immediately after the war he went to work and study in Spain, where he fell in love with a young Spanish dancer, Mar&iacute;a de la Concepci&oacute;n Consuelo Garc&iacute;a Cardoso, daughter of Generoso Jos&eacute; Garc&iacute;a Inglesias, house painter. Sadly his first marriage had not survived the stresses of a musician's peripatetic life. He took Consuelo to England in 1949 and after his divorce in 1952 married her in the same year. There were two sons of this happy and enduring union.<br>
<br>When they arrived in England Brennan secured Semprini a BBC audition. He was immediately engaged to play in a series of fifteen-minute programmes in the style of the recently deceased Charlie Kunz, a popular pianist whose German name had caused public resentment. The style of Semprini quickly took over, pleased the listeners, and led to a short programme with orchestra, for which he chose, arranged, and orchestrated all the music. It was entitled <span class="italic">Semprini Serenade</span>, and was a subtle blend of classical pieces interspersed with selections from theatre and film music and the work of popular composers such as George Gershwin, impeccably performed and introduced quietly and economically from the piano. Soon the programme stretched to an hour; it remained on the air for twenty-five years.<br>
<br>Semprini appeared rarely on television, but was a great favourite from 1952 in the surviving variety theatres, sharing the bill with rising stars such as Peter Sellers and Harry Secombe, and touring the country in a caravan, pulled by an ancient ambulance, that contained a piano and a long table on which he worked out his orchestrations. Later he gave many concerts with a more classical content both in Britain and abroad. Whenever possible he drove his beloved Jaguar home through the night to <i>L'Esp&eacute;rance</i>, a sailing ship converted into a houseboat at West Mersea, Essex, where the family lived happily for many years.<br>
<br>Some critics regretted that Semprini did not pursue a more serious musical career. Certainly he could have performed at the very top of his profession, but he was master of his genre and millions of radio listeners and concert-goers loved his music. In 1972 he was made an officer of the order of St John and he was appointed OBE in 1983&#151;both recognitions of his considerable efforts for charity. He was a tall, dark, dignified man with fine features, always immaculately dressed, but his gravity was often dispelled by a strong sense of humour and a charming smile. He looked Italian, but he was an Englishman at heart. He died in Brixham, Devon (where his home was 18 Windmill Close), from Alzheimer's disease, on 19 January 1990, and was survived by his second wife. His remains were cremated at Colchester, Essex, and his ashes were scattered in the sea off West Mersea.<br>
