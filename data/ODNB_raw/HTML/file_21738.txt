<span class="headword">Peck,  Francis</span>  (1692&#150;1743), <span class="occ">antiquary</span>, was born in the parish of St John the Baptist in Stamford, Lincolnshire, on 4 May 1692, the younger son of Robert Peck, merchant, and his wife, Elizabeth Jephson. Nothing else is known regarding his parents or his siblings. He was educated at Charterhouse School and then at St John's College, Cambridge, from where he graduated BA in 1716 and MA in 1727. His first publication, a &#145;hymn to the creator of the world&#146;&#151;a defence of the holy scripture&#151;was published in 1716. He took holy orders and was ordained deacon (1715) and priest (1716) in the Church of England, becoming curate of King's Cliffe, Northamptonshire, in August 1719. In the same year he married Anne Curtis (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1758), possibly the daughter of Edward Curtis, with whom he had three children, Francis (1720&#150;1749), Thomas (who died in childhood), and Anne (1731&#150;1793). In 1723 he purchased for &pound;400 the living of Goadby Marwood in Leicestershire from Samuel Lowe MP, who was then lord of the manor and patron of the advowson. In 1736 he also obtained the prebendal stall of Marston St Lawrence in Lincoln Cathedral.<br>
<br>Peck lived at the rectory in Goadby Marwood for the rest of his life, and from there dedicated himself to his pastoral duties and his antiquarian and literary studies. His principal interests were in the history and antiquities of the local area&#151;Lincolnshire, Leicestershire, and Rutland&#151;and the political and literary history of seventeenth-century England. In 1721 he published his first proposals for printing the history and antiquities of the town of Stamford, which resulted in his first major publication, <span class="italic">Academia tertia Anglicana, or, The Antiquarian Annals of Stanford</span> (1727). As was not uncommon for such antiquarian works, Peck published all his books at his own expense. Dedicated to John Manners, duke of Rutland, it included a history of that family together with histories of the short-lived university, and the monasteries, guilds, churches, chapels, hospitals, and schools of the town. In the six years spent producing this work he ran into a vitriolic argument with <a name="cosubject_64897"></a><span class="headword">Francis Howgrave</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1724&#150;1726), a young Stamford <span class="occ">apothecary</span> who in the year before Peck's volume appeared published <span class="italic">An Essay on the Ancient and Present State of Stamford</span>. The preface to this short history was highly critical of Peck's delays in publishing his book and of its projected expense. Peck in turn appears to have feared that Howgrave's book would steal his thunder. Either way, their argument illustrates the petty quarrels often arising between local antiquaries in this period. Peck described Howgrave (about whom little else is known other than that he wrote a short essay against smallpox inoculation published in 1724 as a letter to Dr James Jurin FRS) as &#145;such a Child in Antiquities&#146; and threatened: &#145;I am yet only on the defensive: But if you begin the War, I thank God, I have both Money to sue, and Pen to answer him who bespatters&#146;  (Francis Peck to Francis Howgrave, 12 Aug 1726; Howgrave, preface, <span class="italic">An Essay on &hellip; Stamford</span>, iv). Nothing further is known of their argument, though Roger Gale remarked from London in 1728 that &#145;Mr. Peck's <i>voluminous work</i> is not much admired here; it is no hard matter, beside the labour, to compose such a great work, by writing everybodys life that has any relation to it&#146;  (Gale to Stukeley, 6 Feb 1728; <span class="italic">Family Memoirs</span>, 1.200). In 1729 Peck published a single sheet set of queries seeking information on the natural history and antiquities of Leicestershire and Rutland, and in 1731 Thomas Hearne observed that Peck was in Cambridge collecting material for &#145;a fourth and fifth volume&#146; of Sir William Dugdale's <span class="italic">Monasticon Anglicanum</span>, as well as for his history of Leicestershire. Hearne wrote that Peck's &#145;Collections are almost incredible for a man tyed down to a Country Cure&#146;  (<span class="italic">Remarks</span>, 10.475). Browne Willis, according to Hearne, described Peck as &#145;a Man of Parts, &amp; no mean Scholar, tho' very conceited&#146;  (<span class="italic">Remarks</span>, 9.218). Peck met the antiquary William Stukeley in 1723, and when Stukeley moved to Stamford they became friends, establishing a couple of &#145;literary clubs&#146; together. In 1744 Stukeley recalled that Peck &#145;had a good deal of pride, and after many attempts at London, finding he was not rewarded as he thought he ought to have been, he became recluse and angry with the world&#146;  (<span class="italic">Family Memoirs</span>, 2.248).<br>
<br>Peck was elected a member of the Society of Antiquaries on 9 March 1732, and he corresponded with some of the leading antiquaries of his day, including Hearne, Willis, Thomas Wotton, and Zachary Grey. In 1732 he published the first section of his illustrated <span class="italic">Desiderata curiosa, or, A collection of divers scarce and curious pieces, relating chiefly to matters of English history</span>, the work for which he became best known. A second volume appeared in 1735, and his complete catalogue of discourses &#145;written both for and against Popery&#146; during the reign of James II also appeared in that year. William Cole wrote of Peck:<blockquote>Had he lived longer we might have had many more curious pieces of antiquity, which he seems to have been in possession of; but the chief and great failing of this gentleman seemed to be an eager desire to publish as little in one volume as he could, in order to eke out his collection. His &#145;Desiderata Curiosa&#146; is full of curious things, but he has so disjointed, mangled, and new-sentenced all of them, and what with detached books, chapters, and heads of the chapters, that, in endeavouring to be more than ordinarily clear, he has become at many times quite the reverse. (BL, Add. MS 5833, fol. 176)</blockquote>Peck's chaotic and verbose style was likewise criticized by a later historian of Stamford, William Harrod, who nevertheless relied upon Peck's diligent work in <span class="italic">The Antiquarian Annals of Stanford</span> for his own study. While Harrod considered Peck to be<blockquote>the only writer on this town who deserves the name of antiquary &hellip; I own it is the most unpleasant book of that kind I ever sat down to, merely through his ill chosen method, his abrupt departure from his subject, and his joining of long trifles, without any breaks to things of importance. (Harrod, 1.iii&#150;iv)</blockquote>In 1740 Peck published miscellaneous pieces on the lives of Oliver Cromwell and John Milton, as well as a catalogue of the several editions of Shakespeare's writings, and critical and explanatory notes. According to John Nichols, who had a more positive view of Peck's work than either Cole or Harrod, as these last were published<blockquote>at a period when that species of Criticism had not arrived to the perfection it has since attained by the united labours and genius of several successive and learned Commentators, [they] deserve particular commendation. He seems indeed to have first pointed out the mode [of criticism], which has since been successfully pursued. (Nichols, <span class="italic">Lit. anecdotes</span>, 1.513)</blockquote>Thomas Seccombe in the <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span> also described these critical notes as &#145;remarkable, as being perhaps the first attempts made to illustrate their writings by extracts from contemporary writers, in accordance with the method subsequently followed by Steevens and Malone&#146;. However, Peck's off-hand attitude to historical veracity appears in an anecdote related by George Vertue, who informed Peck that the print of Milton he wished to use as the frontispiece to his book on the poet was very probably spurious. Vertue later recollected Peck's reply: &#145;&#147;I'll have a scraping from it however, and let posterity settle the matter&#148;&#146;  (<span class="italic">Appendix to the Memoirs of Thomas Hollis</span>, 513). When Peck's last published work appeared he still had in completed manuscript form<blockquote>no less than nine different works, but whether he had not met with encouragement for those which he had already produced, or whether he was rendered incapable of executing them by reason of his declining health, is uncertain, none of them, however, ever were made public. (F. Peck, <span class="italic">Desiderata curiosa</span>, 1759, preface, x)</blockquote>Peck died on 9 July 1743, of unknown cause; the only comment comes from Stukeley, who informed Roger Gale: &#145;Poor Peck is dead, and made a sad exit, being not quite <i>compos mentis</i>&#146;  (Stukeley to Gale, 6 Aug 1743; <span class="italic">Family Memoirs</span>, 80.431). He was buried in the choir of Goadby Marwood church. At his death Peck left unfinished his &#145;Natural history and antiquities of Leicestershire&#146;, the manuscript of which was bought by Sir Thomas Cave. It passed on to John Nichols, who made use of it in his <span class="italic">History and Antiquities of the County of Leicestershire</span> (4 vols., 1795&#150;1815). The five quarto manuscript volumes of his &#145;Monasticon Anglicanum volumen quartum&#146; to which Hearne had referred were also purchased by Cave. They were presented to the British Museum in 1779, where they were utilized by numerous antiquaries and county historians, and subsequent editors of Dugdale. Other numerous unfinished manuscripts included the history and antiquities of Rutland; the history and antiquities of Grantham; &#145;The annals of Stamford&#146; continued; a third volume of &#145;Desiderata curiosa&#146;; biographical notes on the life of the seventeenth-century politician and theologian Nicholas Ferrar of Little Gidding (which formed the bulk of Peter Peckard's <span class="italic">Memoirs of the Life of Mr Nicholas Ferrar</span>, 1790) and of William and Robert Burton (author of <span class="italic">The Anatomy of Melancholy</span>), and the lives of various other eminent local families and figures. Nichols reflected that Peck had lived &#145;a laborious, and, it may be affirmed, an useful life, wholly devoted to antiquarian pursuits&#146;  (Nichols, <span class="italic">Lit. anecdotes</span>, 1.520).<br>
