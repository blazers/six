<span class="headword">Clare,  Thomas  de</span>  (1244<span class="mult">x</span>7&#150;1287), <span class="occ">magnate and administrator</span>, was a son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5448/', "Richard de Clare, earl of Gloucester and of Hertford (1222&#150;1262)")</script>, and Maud, daughter of John de Lacy, earl of Lincoln. He studied at Oxford in the late 1250s with his younger brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/50346/', "Bogo de Clare (1248&#150;1294)")</script>. Like his elder brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5438/', "Earl Gilbert de Clare (1243&#150;1295)")</script>, he was associated with the Montfortians during the barons' war, and was knighted by Simon de Montfort before the battle of Lewes in 1264. With Earl Gilbert he changed sides in the following year, and helped the Lord Edward to escape from captivity; their close association continued until his death. He took the cross at St Paul's in 1267, went with Edward to Paris in August 1269 to make arrangements for the crusade, and was on crusade from the summer of 1270, returning to England early in 1272 [<i>see also </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/94804', "Lord Edward's crusade")</script>]. He was then sent to Gascony, where he did homage to Philippe III for the Agenais on behalf of Henry III and his heir. From 1265 he held constableships of various English castles, had the stewardship of several royal forests, and served as a judicial commissioner. He gained, through seizures and royal grants, considerable wealth in the form of contrariants' lands in the wake of the barons' war. He was also granted the custody of the heir of Maurice Fitzgerald (<i>d</i>. 1268), lord of Offaly, which he sold for 3500 marks to William de Valence in 1269. This windfall, as well as supporting his crusade, probably drew the possibilities of Ireland, where Earl Gilbert was lord of Kilkenny, to his attention.<br>
<br>Even before Edward I returned to England in August 1274, he may have decided to use Thomas de Clare in Ireland. He was connected with the Dublin government between 1274 and 1276, assisting the justiciars in their wars against the Irish of Wicklow, serving as sheriff of Limerick, and possibly as chancellor for a time in 1275. At about this time he also formed a connection with the local aristocracy through his marriage to Juliana, daughter and eventual coheir of Maurice fitz Maurice Fitzgerald (<i>d</i>. 1286), which immediately brought him property in Cork and Limerick, including the port of Youghal. In January 1276 Edward granted him the lordship of Thomond. He augmented his holdings in the region by exchanging some of his English acquisitions with former grantees in south-west Ireland. The final ten years of his life were dominated by a partially successful attempt to establish control of Thomond. He refortified the castle of Bunratty, and in 1281, with the help of the justiciar and the feudal service of Ireland, built a castle at Quin. His path, like that of earlier conquistadores, was smoothed by segmentary competition among the Irish. The Gaelic historical tract on the wars of Thomond, <span class="italic">Caithr&eacute;im Thoirdhealbhaigh</span>, highlights the disputes within the &Oacute; Briain dynasty that formed the backdrop to his activities. It also provides a vivid account of his execution of Briain Ruadh &Oacute; Briain, with whom he had first allied, in 1277&#151;an act that was to figure in the remonstrance of the Irish against English rule sent to Pope John XXII in 1317. <span class="italic">Caithr&eacute;im Thoirdhealbhaigh</span> is more hostile to Clare and his descendants, and the &#145;common English&#146;  (<span class="italic">Caithr&eacute;im Thoirdhealbhaigh</span>, 2.8) they introduced, than to the older colonists who had long-standing links with the Gaelic nobility.<br>
<br>Thomas de Clare died on 29 August 1287. His widow, who married Adam of Creting, lived until 1300. His elder son, Gilbert (<i>d</i>. 1308), concentrated on his English interests. But his younger son, Richard de Clare (<i>d</i>. 1318), who was sheriff of Cork in 1309 and one of the magnates who resisted the Bruce invasion of Ireland between 1315 and 1318, devoted his energies to rebuilding the lordship of Thomond through war and diplomacy. His death at the hands of the &Oacute; Briain dynasty at the battle of Dysert O'Dea led to the collapse of the English position west of Limerick. After the death of his young son, Thomas, in 1321, his lands were partitioned between coheiresses. They and their descendants were mostly absentees; and in the later fourteenth century much of what remained of Thomas de Clare's Irish interests was sold to the earl of Ormond and other resident lords.<br>
