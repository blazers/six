<span class="headword">Savage <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Darcy]</span>,  Elizabeth</span>, <i>suo jure</i> Countess Rivers  (1581&#150;1651), <span class="occ">courtier and victim of popular violence</span>, was the daughter of Thomas Darcy, third Baron Darcy of Chiche (<i>d</i>. 1640), later created Viscount Colchester (1621) and Earl Rivers (1626), and his wife, Mary Kitson (<i>d</i>. 1644), daughter of Sir Thomas Kitson of Hengrave, Suffolk. On 14 May 1602 she married Thomas Savage (<i>c</i>.1586&#150;1635), with whom she had a large family of eleven sons and eight daughters. Savage was the eldest surviving son of Sir John Savage of Cheshire and his wife, Mary Allington, daughter and coheir to Sir Richard Allington, from which family he inherited the manor of Melford Hall, Suffolk. Savage inherited his father's baronetcy in 1615; in November 1626 he was created Viscount Savage. At his death, on 20 November 1635, Elizabeth inherited Melford Hall, which together with St Osyth Priory in Essex formed her principal residences. Her father died in February 1640 and was succeeded by her eldest son, John Savage, as Earl Rivers; fourteen months later, on 21 April 1641, she herself was created Countess Rivers <i>suo jure</i>, for life.<br>
<br>Elizabeth Savage inherited from her father and husband the political and religious allegiances that were to bring her ruin in the civil war. Both men were closely associated with the court of Charles I, both had links with the duke of Buckingham, and both played a role in their respective counties (Essex in the case of the former and Lancashire and Cheshire in the case of the latter) in the enforcement of Caroline policy. Elizabeth and her husband both served at the court of Charles I, Thomas as chancellor to Queen Henrietta Maria; Elizabeth, as a lady of the bedchamber, was a close companion of the queen, after whom she named one of her daughters. These appointments reflected the family's strong Catholic links. Elizabeth's father was suspected of being a church papist, but he enjoyed royal protection against recusancy legislation. The houses at both St Osyth and Long Melford formed little islands of Catholicism surrounded by neighbouring communities with a strong commitment to puritanism. Knowledge of the family's Catholicism and of the presence of Jesuit priests had made them an object of popular rumour as well as of official action, her father being excluded from the county magistracy.<br>
<br>The political instability brought about by the collapse of Charles I's personal rule and parliament's emphasis on a Catholic conspiracy as the explanation for their inability to secure a settlement with the king heightened rumour and suspicion. In January 1642 Countess Rivers's sister spoke of being daily threatened by the common sort of people. Parliament's call for action against Catholics worsened the family's position. Elizabeth was presented to the Essex courts as a recusant and her house was searched for arms on the order of parliament. In August 1642 the crowds at Colchester who had attacked Sir John Lucas there went on to attack Catholics in the belief that this was what parliament really wanted. Although many Catholic families were affected, Countess Rivers became the most famous victim. Edward Hyde, earl of Clarendon, included an account of her fate in his <span class="italic">History of the Rebellion</span> and the royalist newsbook writer Bruno Ryves gave a detailed (and colourful) account in his newsbook, <span class="italic">Mercurius Rusticus</span>. At St Osyth the crowds ransacked and plundered the house. Forewarned, the countess had fled to her other house at Long Melford but the crowds followed her there and all but destroyed that house as well, the countess claiming only just to have escaped as the crowds broke in. The family of the present incumbent at Melford Hall, Sir Richard Hyde Parker, have preserved a colourful story of the countess's fleeing the house and throwing into a nearby pond a box with the strings of pearls that are to be seen in her portrait at the hall. Seven years later the Essex minister Ralph Josselin, on a trip to Melford, noted, &#145;I saw the ruines of that great [house], plundered out and desoloate without inhabitants&#146;, while St Osyth was later said to have remained uninhabited for the next seventy years  (<span class="italic">Diary of Ralph Josselin</span>, 174). The countess put her losses at some &pound;100,000 and claimed not to have been left even a change of apparel.<br>
<br>Although the popular attacks on her may have attracted wider support from those opposed to the family's association with Charles I's regime and offended by their estate policies as major landowners and their use of their extensive religious patronage to appoint ministers of crypto-papist or Arminian leanings (several of whom were also attacked), Countess Rivers was able to secure support from those who shared neither her religion nor her politics. The earl of Holland in asking Sir Thomas Barrington to support her acknowledged the difference in religion, but noted that in the countess her Catholicism &#145;is governed with more modesty and Temper than I ever sawe it in any person&#146;  (BL, Egerton MS 2646, fol. 197<i>r</i>). Parliament ordered the restitution of her goods, but this seems to have had only limited effect, her problems being compounded by a rent strike by her tenants. After a second episode in which parliamentarian soldiers invaded her house and took away her goods, she sought permission to go to France in May 1643. In 1648 she petitioned successfully to be allowed to compound for her estates sequestrated by parliament. However, the attacks, combined with the fines imposed on her and her son Earl Rivers, declared a notorious papist by parliament in July 1642, took a heavy toll. At her death, on 9 March 1651, she was said to be bankrupt. She was buried at St Osyth with her Darcy ancestors.<br>
