<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Bennett,  Jack Arthur Walter</span>  (1911&#150;1981), <span class="occ">literary scholar</span>, was born on 28 February 1911 at Auckland, New Zealand, the eldest son of Ernest Bennett, foreman shoemaker, and his wife, Alexandra Corrall. Both parents were born in Leicester in the 1880s: Ernest worked in shoe manufacturing, and emigrated to New Zealand in 1907; Alexandra followed in 1908. Bennett's younger brother Norman was born in 1916. Bennett was educated at Mount Albert grammar school in Auckland, where he won a Lizzie Rathbone scholarship to Auckland University College. The most important influence on his work while he was at Auckland was that of Philip Sidney Ardern. While undergraduates, Bennett and his friend James Bertram founded and edited a controversial literary magazine, <span class="italic">Open Windows</span>, intended to introduce New Zealand readers to the larger world of literary modernism.<br>
<br>In 1933 Bennett left for Merton College, Oxford, with a postgraduate scholarship, having taken a first class in the Auckland MA examination. He completed the Oxford BA English course (medieval and philological option) in 1935, with a first class, and at once, with Kenneth Sisam as his supervisor, embarked on a doctoral thesis &#145;Old English and Old Norse studies in England from the time of Francis Junius till the end of the eighteenth century&#146;. He took his DPhil in 1938; in the same year he was elected to a junior research fellowship at Queen's College, Oxford.<br>
<br>In 1937 Bennett married a pupil at Oxford, Edith Bannister; the marriage was annulled in 1949. At the outbreak of war in 1939 Bennett was in the United States. He stayed there until September 1945, working for the Ministry of Information, and becoming head of the research division of British information services. He returned to Queen's College late in 1945 and took up teaching for the English faculty. In 1947 he was elected to a tutorial fellowship at Magdalen College, where his colleague in teaching English was C. S. Lewis, whom Bennett knew as a member of the literary group the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/92544', "Inklings")</script>. In 1951 he married as his second wife Gwyneth Mary Nicholas (<i>d</i>. 1980), the daughter of Archibald John Nicholas, a civil servant; they had two sons. Bennett soon began to help C. T. Onions, who was also at Magdalen, to edit his journal <span class="italic">Medium Aevum</span>; he succeeded Onions as sole editor in 1956 and continued until 1980. In 1964 he succeeded C. S. Lewis as professor of medieval and Renaissance English at Cambridge; in the same year he became a fellow of Magdalene College, and in 1968 was made the keeper of the old library at Magdalene.<br>
<br>Bennett's first substantial publications were editions of medieval texts: <span class="italic">The Knight's Tale</span> (1954), and <span class="italic">Devotional Pieces in Verse and Prose from MS Arundel 285 and MS Harleian 6919</span> (1955). Also published in 1955 was his edition (with H. R. Trevor-Roper) of <span class="italic">The Poems of Richard Corbett</span>. His three books on Chaucer occupied him intermittently for the following twenty years. <span class="italic">The Parlement of Foules: an Interpretation</span> appeared in 1957, <span class="italic">Chaucer's Book of Fame</span> in 1968, and (based on the Alexander lectures given at Toronto in 1970&#150;71) <span class="italic">Chaucer at Oxford and at Cambridge</span> in 1974. <span class="italic">Early Middle English Verse and Prose</span>, a volume of annotated selections which Bennett edited with G. V. Smithers, appeared in 1966.<br>
<br>From the 1950s until the early 1970s Bennett was also much involved, as general editor, with the <span class="roman">Clarendon Medieval and Tudor</span> series of annotated texts, to which he himself contributed two of the later volumes: <span class="italic">Gower</span> (1968) and <span class="italic">Piers Plowman</span> (1972). From 1972 to 1976 he published four sets of <span class="italic">Supplementary Notes on &#145;Sir Gawain and the Green Knight&#146;</span> and in 1980 a short book, <span class="italic">Essays on Gibbon</span> (this was not such a radical departure as it might seem, since his interest in Gibbon went back to his doctoral thesis of over forty years before). Bennett's last completed book, <span class="italic">Poetry of the Passion</span> (1982), examined poetic treatments of Christ's passion from the Old English <span class="italic">Dream of the Rood</span> to <span class="italic">The Anathemata</span> of David Jones. Also in 1982 appeared a volume of Bennett's uncollected essays; edited by Piero Boitani and published in Rome, it was called <span class="italic">The Humane Medievalist and other Essays</span>.<br>
<br>Bennett left unfinished at his death a large work which had engaged him for many years&#151;the medieval volume intended for the <span class="roman">Oxford History of English Literature</span>. Entitled <span class="italic">Middle English Literature</span>, this was completed and edited by Douglas Gray and published in 1986. <span class="italic">Medieval Studies for J. A. W. Bennett</span>, a volume of essays by pupils and friends, edited by Peter Heyworth and intended for Bennett's seventieth birthday, appeared too late for him to see it in 1981.<br>
<br>Although Bennett was unquestionably one of Britain's leading literary medievalists, his interests were by no means confined to the middle ages. The seventeenth century was a favourite period, and he was surprisingly well read in American literature. Erudite, imaginative, sensitive, his work as a whole was nourished by his curious and highly independent reading in all periods and by a wide and discriminating experience of the arts, especially painting.<br>
<br>Bennett was made a fellow of the British Academy in 1971. In 1976 he held a visiting fellowship at the Australian National University, and was elected a corresponding fellow of the Medieval Academy of America, and an honorary foreign member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. In 1978 he was elected to an emeritus fellowship of the Leverhulme Trust, and in 1980 was awarded the Sir Israel Gollancz prize of the British Academy.<br>
<br>Bennett had long suffered from cardiac asthma; some months after his wife's death in March 1980 he was on his way to New Zealand, and had stopped at Los Angeles, when he died suddenly on 29 January 1981. He was buried in Cambridge beside his wife. He had been a devout Roman Catholic.<br>
