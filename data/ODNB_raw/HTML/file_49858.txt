<span class="headword">Jeffreys, Sir  Jeffrey</span>  (<em>c.</em>1652&#150;1709), <span class="occ">politician and merchant</span>, was the third son of Walter (or Watkin) Jeffreys of Llywel, Brecknockshire. He is reported to have been &#145;educated and adopted&#146; by his rich bachelor uncle, Alderman <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/49859/', "John Jeffreys")</script> of London. When, in the late 1670s, Jeffrey married Sarah (<i>d</i>. 1725), daughter of Nicholas Dawes, goldsmith and citizen of London, his alderman uncle provided a significant share of the property or commitments covered by the marriage contract. Jeffreys studied law at the Inner Temple and was called to the bar in 1676. However, upon the death in 1680 of his uncle's partner, Thomas Colclough, he left the law and became a half-share partner in his uncle's merchant house, the largest importer of tobacco and the most important North American merchant company in the kingdom.<br>
<br>When John Jeffreys died in 1688, he left his remaining half of the business to Jeffrey's younger brother John, later an MP, but much of his metropolitan real estate to Jeffrey. With the start of the War of the League of Augsburg in 1689, the two partner brothers decided that in such hazardous times the likely rewards of the Chesapeake trade were not sufficiently attractive, and fairly rapidly withdrew their name from that commerce. Jeffrey Jeffreys, however, retained correspondents in the Chesapeake and was for a number of years in the early 1690s the London agent for Virginia; it is therefore possible that his firm retained some interest in the Chesapeake trade carried on by other firms. He was admitted to the Eastland Company in 1690 and thus was able in the 1690s to export tobacco to Riga and elsewhere in the Baltic, as well as to Spain. He tentatively returned to the tobacco-import trade with the peace of 1697, but detailed import data after that date have not survived. Although they withdrew from the Chesapeake, the brothers continued and expanded their late uncle's trade in the West Indies, including Barbados, Jamaica, and the Leeward Islands (for which Jeffrey Jeffreys was London agent, 1690&#150;97). Their firm also had contracts for victualling the navy in Jamaica and remitting funds to the garrison in New York. The brothers further supported their Caribbean trade by continuing their uncle's active interest in the slave-trading Royal African Company, and both served as &#145;assistants&#146; (directors) in the company&#151;Jeffrey in 1684&#150;6 and 1692&#150;8, John in 1690&#150;91 and 1693. During the war, letters of marque were issued for ten vessels in which Jeffreys was interested, the largest being the <i>Hannibal</i>, 450 tons, 100 men, 36 guns, which was leased to the Royal African Company in 1693. The other nine had crews too small for privateers and were probably also used in the slave trade or in Jeffreys's West Indian contract work. During the period 1702&#150;9 Jeffreys, as a licensed &#145;separate trader&#146;, sent three private ventures to the west African coast. He was also a shareholder in the East India Company (<i>c</i>.1690&#150;91) but was not conspicuously involved in the struggle between the old and new companies in the ensuing decade.<br>
<br>Unlike his uncle, Jeffreys was interested in a more prominent public activity than the merely philanthropic service he gave as a commissioner for the Greenwich Hospital in 1695 or even the lieutenancy commission to which he and his brother John were named in 1689. From the heiress of the (unrelated) Colonel John Jeffreys of Brecon, he purchased The Priory there. This significant acquisition facilitated his return to parliament as a tory for the borough of Brecon in every parliament between 1690 and his death in 1709, except for that of 1698&#150;1701, when his petition against a hostile return was rejected by the House of Commons. In parliament Jeffreys was particularly active on colonial and commercial questions. He continued his family's tory loyalties, an affiliation consistent with his association with the Royal African Company and the old East India Company. Nevertheless, as a merchant he found it prudent to mute his partisanship. After his death, both his son Nicholas and his daughter Sarah married into the whig Eyles family.<br>
<br>Jeffreys's political activity did not at first extend to the City of London, but in 1699, by which time he was thought to be worth &pound;300,000, he was elected sheriff. He surprised the City then by agreeing to serve, instead of fining to be excused as his uncle had done when elected alderman in 1660. In 1699 he was also knighted as sheriff and elected master of the Grocers' Company (1699&#150;1701). This sudden spurt of activity was followed by his election as a common councillor for Aldgate ward (1700&#150;01) and alderman for Portsoken ward in 1701. The lieutenancy commissioners named him colonel of the Yellow regiment of the trained bands in 1707, but forced him out the next year when they refused to accept the lesser officers he had nominated. He stood unsuccessfully for the mayoralty in 1703 but, it was thought at the time, would have been elected in 1709 had he not then been on his deathbed.<br>
<br>Jeffreys inherited from his uncle a large town house on unusually extensive grounds in St Mary Axe. (After his death, his heirs cleared the property for the construction of Jeffreys Square.) For his greater comfort, he purchased Roehampton House, Surrey, from the estate of the countess of Devonshire. Here he resided until his death, which occurred at Marlborough on 25 October 1709, while he was returning home from a visit to Bath. He left extensive real estate, including several thousand acres acquired in Brecknockshire and the inherited prebendary lease (from St Paul's Cathedral) of the manor of Kentish Town outside London, including a demesne of 210 acres. Sir Jeffrey and his wife, who died in 1725, raised two sons and six daughters. On the death without male issue of both sons, Edward (1680&#150;1740) and Nicholas (1683&#150;1747), Jeffreys's real estate passed to Nicholas's daughter and heir, Elizabeth, who in 1749 was to marry the rising lawyer, Charles Pratt, later lord chancellor and first Earl Camden. On the Kentish Town demesne lands their son, the first Marquess Camden, developed the neighbourhood known as Camden Town, where Jeffreys Street and Brecknock Road recall the former owner.<br>
