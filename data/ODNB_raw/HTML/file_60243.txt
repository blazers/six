<span class="headword">Kinross,  John</span>  (1855&#150;1931), <span class="occ">architect</span>, was born on 3 July 1855 at Shore Road, Stirling, the second of four sons of William Kinross (1810&#150;1874), carriage builder, and his second wife, Ann (1821&#150;1899), <i>n&eacute;e</i> Marshall. Kinross attended Stirling high school from 1865 to 1870. He took an architectural apprenticeship with John Hutchison IA (1841&#150;1908) in Glasgow from 1870 to about 1875, and then moved to the Edinburgh office of Wardrop and Reid, architects. In 1880&#150;81 he toured Italy studying, publishing <span class="italic">Details from Italian Buildings Chiefly Renaissance</span> (1882) on his return. In this year he joined Henry Seymour (1857&#150;1912) in partnership in Edinburgh, undertaking predominantly ecclesiastical work. On 13 August 1889 Kinross married (Mary Louisa) Margaret (1863&#150;1935), teacher, daughter of George Blythe Hall, a banker in York: they had four children, Eveleen Mary (1894&#150;1969) and John Blythe (1904&#150;1989), and two daughters who died in infancy. After leaving Seymour, Kinross began independent practice in 1890, enjoying major restoration projects such as the Carmelite friary church, South Queensferry, Midlothian (1889&#150;90), and the Augustinian priory, St Andrews, Fife (1893&#150;8), and the patronage of the third marquess of Bute. He was active in the Edinburgh Architectural Association, serving as president in 1898&#150;9, and was committed to the Royal Scottish Academy, becoming associate in 1893 and full academician in 1905.<br>
<br>Work for Kinross's other leading patron, Sir James Percy Miller, bt, of Manderston, Berwickshire, began in 1890, including extensive work across the estate and to the mansion. By 1897 the large volume of work in which he was engaged led to partnership with Harold Ogle Tarbolton (1869&#150;1947), though Kinross reverted to independent practice in 1905. During the following years he took an active role in the development of the architectural education in Scotland through continued involvement with academic bodies. He pursued his earlier search for a school of design, creating a new college of art in Edinburgh on whose board of management he sat (1908&#150;11 and 1919&#150;21), constantly insisting upon the study of historic fabric and the link with craftsmanship in design education. Kinross joined J. Inch Morrison (<i>d</i>. 1944) in practice in 1920. His other major works include the restorations of Falkland Palace, Fife (1890&#150;98), Greyfriars convent (1896&#150;1900), and the Michaelkirk, Moray (1900&#150;01), new work at St Mary's, Chapeltown, Moray (1896&#150;7), stables at Altyre, Moray (1902), and Ingliston, near Edinburgh (<i>c</i>.1900&#150;02), houses at Carlekemp, Haddington (1898&#150;1900), and The Peel, Selkirk (1904&#150;6). He worked particularly with Gothic, Renaissance, and Scottish seventeenth-century styles. Kinross was regarded highly by his colleagues in the profession. He died on 7 January 1931 at his home, 2 Abercromby Place, Edinburgh; after a funeral at St Paul's episcopal church he was buried at Grange cemetery, Grange Road, Edinburgh.<br>
