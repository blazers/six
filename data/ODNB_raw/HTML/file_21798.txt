<span class="headword">Pelham,  Thomas</span>, first earl of Chichester  (1728&#150;1805), <span class="occ">politician</span>, born in Westminster, London, on 28 February 1728, was the only son of the two children of Thomas Pelham (<i>c</i>.1705&#150;1737), of Stanmer, Sussex, and his wife, Annetta (<i>d</i>. 1733), the daughter of Thomas Bridges of Constantinople. His father was a first cousin of Thomas Pelham-Holles, duke of Newcastle, and after having been a merchant in Constantinople served as MP for Lewes from 1727 to 1737. He was educated at Westminster School and entered Clare College, Cambridge, in 1745 but left after a few months to embark on the grand tour. Between 1746 and 1750 he travelled with John Milbanke through France, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Italy, and Germany. In Florence he was entertained by Sir Horace Mann and also began a relationship with the Countess Acciajuoli, which delayed his return from Italy until August 1750. On 15 June 1754 he married, at Mortlake, Anne (1734/5&#150;1813), the daughter and heir of Frederick Meinhart Frankland and his first wife, Elizabeth Cardonnel. They had four sons and four daughters.<br>
<br>While abroad, Pelham had been returned, on 13 December 1749 by the duke of Newcastle, as MP for Rye. Following Henry Pelham's death in 1754, he succeeded as knight of the shire, and he represented the county of Sussex from May 1754 until November 1768. In April 1754 Newcastle secured his appointment to the Board of Trade. Pelham was one of the leaders of Newcastle's &#145;young friends&#146;, and he co-ordinated the activities of Newcastle's Sussex supporters. In 1761 he was named a lord of the Admiralty. A year later, when Newcastle obtained for himself the barony of Pelham of Stanmer, its reversion was secured by the patent to Pelham. This attached Pelham firmly to Newcastle. After voting against the peace preliminaries on 10 December 1762 he was dismissed in the &#145;massacre of Pelhamite innocents&#146;.<br>
<br>On the formation of the first Rockingham ministry in July 1765, Pelham became comptroller of the household and was sworn of the privy council. When Newcastle followed Rockingham out of office a year later, Pelham remained in government. Newcastle had called on his supporters to desert Chatham, but Pelham claimed that the welfare of his children had to take precedence over political loyalty. In government, however, he continued to be influenced by Newcastle. He voted for the reduction of the land tax on 22 February 1767, but the constraints of office persuaded him to vote with the government on the <span class="roman">Nullum Tempus Bill</span>. On the death, in November 1768, of Newcastle, with whom he was in confidential correspondence until the last, Pelham became Baron Pelham of Stanmer and head of the family. He did not inherit Newcastle's political following, however. The boroughs of Rye and Seaford reverted to the Treasury, leaving Pelham with control over the solitary seat of Lewes. In 1773 he obtained the lucrative sinecure of the surveyor-generalship of the customs of London. From 1774 to 1775 he also held the nominal office of chief justice in eyre north of the Trent, which he gave up on his appointment as master of the great wardrobe. This office was abolished in 1782, and Pelham was its last holder.<br>
<br>In the Lords Pelham supported North until the fall of his ministry. He voted for Fox's <span class="roman">East India Bill</span>, and in 1788 his name was attached to the two protests drawn up against Pitt's provision for the expected regency. In spite of his consistent opposition to Pitt, which lasted until the French Revolution, Walpole ranked him among the &#145;court ciphers&#146;. He was certainly intimate with Princess Amelia, and when she died in 1786 he acted as one of her executors. On 23 June 1801 he was created earl of Chichester. He died on 8 January 1805 at his country house of Stanmer, Sussex, and was buried at Laughton in the same county. His widow survived him, and died suddenly at Malling, Sussex, on 5 March 1813, aged seventy-eight. Only three of their children outlived their parents: the eldest son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21799/', "Thomas Pelham, second earl of Chichester (1756&#150;1826)")</script>, politician; <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21788/', "George Pelham (1766&#150;1827)")</script>, bishop of Lincoln; and Amelia, who died in 1847.<br>
