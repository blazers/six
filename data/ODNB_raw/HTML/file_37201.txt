<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Blumlein,  Alan Dower</span>  (1903&#150;1942), <span class="occ">electronics engineer</span>, was born on 29 June 1903 at 31 Netherhall Gardens, Hampstead, London, the only son and the second of two children of Semmy Joseph Blumlein (1863&#150;1914), a German mining businessman and naturalized British subject, and his wife, Jessie Edward Dower, daughter of the Revd William Dower, a Scottish missionary, and his wife.<br>
<br>Blumlein, possibly the greatest British electronics engineer of the twentieth century, was a remarkably versatile, prolific, and creative engineer. His 128 patents, which were produced in a working lifetime of just eighteen years, embrace the fields of telephony, electrical measurements, sound recording and sound reproduction (both monaural and stereophonic), high-definition television, radar, and electronics generally.<br>
<br>Blumlein was educated at various schools, including Highgate School, Middlesex (1918&#150;21), and at the City and Guilds College, London (1921&#150;3). He graduated with a first-class honours degree in electrical engineering in 1923, and was then appointed an assistant demonstrator (1923&#150;4). With Professor Mallett, Blumlein devised a new method of high-frequency resistance measurement. Their joint paper was awarded a premium by the Institution of Electrical Engineers in 1925.<br>
<br>Blumlein joined the International Western Electric Company in September 1924. His endeavours, in the field of telephony, on loading coils, and the reduction of cross-talk and electrical interference, were appreciated by the company and led to Blumlein's being given a bonus of a year's salary. Later, during an investigation of capacity unbalance, he invented the widely used transformer ratio arm bridge. In 1929 he was appointed by the Columbia Graphophone Company to engage in work on monaural sound recording and reproduction, primarily to circumvent the Western Electric patents on electrical recording. He was eminently successful in his task and engineered a superior system.<br>
<br>About 1930&#150;31 Blumlein became interested in stereophonic recording and reproduction. His extensive investigations resulted in one of the classic patents of the electrical recording literature. Such was the profusion of his ideas that the patent contains no fewer than seventy claims. However, his work was twenty-five years in advance of the recording art, and its significance was recognized only in 1958, when a citation was awarded posthumously to him by the Audio Engineering Society of the USA.<br>
<br>Following the formation in 1931 of EMI, Blumlein made sterling contributions to the realization of the world's first, public, all-electronic, high-definition television service. His patents on camera tubes, camera mosaics, wide-band amplifiers of all types, modulators, pulse circuits, power supplies, transmission lines, antennas, test equipment, and electronic circuits generally, constitute a set which illustrates the manifold ideas and the intellectual power of Blumlein's genius. With E. C. Cork he designed the wide-band cable which was utilized during the televising of the 1937 coronation. In 1938 he invented slot antennas, and, with H. Kallman and W. S. Percival, the transversal filter.<br>
<br>The threat of war caused Blumlein and E. L. C. White to design and demonstrate in 1939 a 60 MHz radar. This was a private venture of EMI and was conceived when government radar work was a closely guarded secret. When the Second World War began Blumlein applied his binaural concepts to the problem of the sound location of enemy aircraft, and his transformer ratio arm principles to the design of a low-level altimeter for the RAF.<br>
<br>Of great importance was Blumlein's work, with White, on air interception (AI) radar. Their solution to the minimum range problem and their development of a new modulator&#150;transmitter (which became part of the AI Mark IV radar) contributed substantially to the defeat, from the beginning of 1941, of the German night bomber offensive over England. An improved version, AI Mark VI, was engineered by Blumlein and White for single-seater fighters.<br>
<br>Blumlein's work on the navigation radar H<sub>2</sub>S and its adaptation, known as air surface vessel (ASV) radar, for locating enemy U-boats, was invaluable. These radars had a dramatic effect on the battle of the Atlantic and on the allies' long-range strategic bombing of Germany. His delay-line circuits, automatic strobe-following concepts, and diverse electronic circuits found application in other types of radar, including GL Mark III&#151;a gun-laying radar which played a significant role in the anti-aircraft gunnery defence of the United Kingdom.<br>
<br>On 22 April 1933 Blumlein married Doreen Lane (1908&#150;1989), daughter of W. H. Lane, auctioneer and estate agent of Penzance, and his wife, and settled in Ealing, London. Their sons, Simon and David, were born in 1936 and 1939 respectively.<br>
<br>Blumlein was killed, aged thirty-eight, on 7 June 1942, while flight testing, over the Wye valley, a version of the H<sub>2</sub>S radar. He was cremated on 13 June at Golders Green crematorium. Of Blumlein's life's work, Isaac Shoenberg, director of research at EMI, said: &#145;There was not a single subject to which he turned his mind that he did not enrich extensively&#146;  (J. D. McGee, &#145;Contributions to television&#146;, <span class="italic">British Kinematography, Sound and Television Journal</span>, July 1968).<br>
