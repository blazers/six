<span class="headword">Pritchard,  John Langford</span>  (1799&#150;1850), <span class="occ">actor</span>, the son of a captain in the navy, was born, it is said, at sea, in February 1799, and, adopting his father's profession, became a midshipman. Inspired by the performances of Edmund Kean and other actors, he took to the stage, and after some practice as an amateur joined a small company in Wales. In May 1820, as &#145;Pritchard from Cheltenham&#146;, he made his first appearance in Bath, when he took the part of Captain Absolute in <span class="italic">The Rivals</span>. In August he played Lord Trinket, Sir Benjamin Backbite, and other parts under Alfred Bunn at the New Theatre, Birmingham. He reappeared in Bath in October as Irwin in Elizabeth Inchbald's <span class="italic">Everyone has his Fault</span>. In the summer of 1821 he joined the York circuit under Mansell and made his first appearance as Romeo. Parts such as Jaffier, Pythias, Iago, Edmund in <span class="italic">King Lear</span>, and Richmond were assigned him.<br>
<br>Pritchard then joined W. H. Murray's company in Edinburgh, where he remained for eleven years. He played a variety of Scottish characters, including Edward Waverley in a new version of <span class="italic">Waverley</span> and Rob Roy, a difficult part in Edinburgh for an Englishman. He also took on historical characters such as Richard I in <span class="italic">The Talisman</span>, George Douglas in <span class="italic">Mary Stuart (The Abbot)</span>, and Oliver Cromwell in <span class="italic">Woodstock, or, The Cavalier</span>. In 1830&#150;31 Pritchard went with Murray to the Adelphi Theatre. He appeared there through the summer season of 1832 and then left Edinburgh. While he was there he won very favourable recognition, both artistic and social, and took a prominent part in establishing the Edinburgh Shakespeare Club, at the first anniversary dinner of which Scott owned himself the author of <span class="italic">Waverley</span>. During his vacations he had played in Glasgow, Perth, Aberdeen, and other leading Scottish towns.<br>
<br>In October 1833 Pritchard made his first appearance in Dublin, playing Bassanio and Petruchio, followed by Wellborn to the Sir Giles Overreach of Charles Kean. He was hospitably entertained in Ireland, where he also appeared as Jeremy Diddler, Mark Antony, and Meg Merrilees, and established a club similar to that in Edinburgh. He made his d&eacute;but in London on 16 November 1835 at Covent Garden, as Alonzo in <span class="italic">Pizarro</span>. He played Macduff, and was popular as Lindsay, an original part in Edward Fitzball's <span class="italic">The Inheritance</span>. During W. C. Macready's tenure of Covent Garden in 1838 he reappeared as Don Pedro in Susannah Centlivre's <span class="italic">The Wonder</span>; Macready himself played Don Felix, which was held to be Pritchard's great part. He took a secondary role in the performance of Bulwer-Lytton's <span class="italic">The Lady of Lyons</span>, and was the original Felton in Sheridan Knowles's <span class="italic">Woman's Wit, or, Love's Disguises</span>. Macready, justifiably it seems, was charged with keeping him back. Pritchard retired ultimately to the provinces and became the manager of the York circuit, where he continued to act. He died on 5 August 1850. He was a sound, careful, and judicious actor, but only just reached the second rank; his best parts appear to have been Don Felix and Mercutio.<br>
