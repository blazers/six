<span class="headword">Bateman,  Hezekiah Linthicum</span>  (1812&#150;1875), <span class="occ">actor and theatre manager</span>, was born in Baltimore, Maryland, USA, on 6 December 1812, the fourth child and second son of Amzi Bateman (<i>c</i>.1777&#150;1816) and his wife, Catherine Schaeffer Evans Bateman (<i>c</i>.1784&#150;1870). Amzi Bateman, a fisherman by trade, was a member of the 6th regiment of the Maryland militia and actively participated in the defence of Baltimore against the invasion of British troops during the Anglo-American War. Following Amzi's death his widow, Catherine, tutored students to support her young family.<br>
<br>Hezekiah, unwillingly apprenticed as a young man to a firm of Baltimore engineers, left that position in the winter of 1832&#150;3 with the intention of becoming an actor. He played juvenile roles with a neighbour, Junius Brutus Booth the elder, and with Ellen Tree (later Mrs Charles Kean). In 1839 he was employed by the theatrical management team of Noah M. Ludlow and Sol S. Smith for their stock company, and made his d&eacute;but at their St Louis Theatre on 8 April 1839. Smith thought Bateman &#145;a good actor for the experience he then had&#146;  (Smith, 140).<br>
<br>At the time Bateman was employed, Ludlow and Smith also took on the comedian <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6491/', "Joseph Leathley (Joe) Cowell")</script> and his daughter Sidney Frances Cowell (1823&#150;1881) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1669/', "Bateman, Sidney Frances")</script>]. Bateman and the sixteen-year-old Sidney were married in St Louis on 10 November 1839. Of their eight children, four would be remembered for careers on the stage: <a name="cosubject_49683"></a><span class="headword">Kate Josephine Bateman</span>  (1842&#150;1917)<span class="occ"></span>, <a name="cosubject_49685"></a><span class="headword">Ellen Douglass Bateman</span>  (1844&#150;1936)<span class="occ"></span>, <a name="cosubject_60241"></a><span class="headword">Virginia Frances Bateman</span>  (1853&#150;1940)<span class="occ"></span>, the mother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30957/', "Fay Compton (1894&#150;1978)")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/31392/', "Edward Montague Compton Mackenzie (1883&#150;1972)")</script>, and <a name="cosubject_49684"></a><span class="headword">Isabel Emilie Bateman</span>  (1854&#150;1934)<span class="occ"></span>.<br>
<br>When the Ludlow and Smith company experienced financial difficulties at the end of the 1840 summer season in St Louis, the Batemans returned to Baltimore, where Hezekiah entered into a grocery business. This commercial enterprise was short-lived, however, and after several appearances at local Baltimore theatres the family sailed for England. Hezekiah made his d&eacute;but on a British stage at Osbaldiston's Victoria Theatre, Surrey, on 16 September 1846. Badly received, he was hissed off the stage and returned to America, penniless and in steerage.<br>
<br>Hezekiah and Sidney next joined James Bates's theatrical company at the Louisville Theatre in Louisville, Kentucky, in October 1847. On 17 December 1847 <span class="italic">Children of the Wood</span> was announced, but, it was said, the two children scheduled to play were suddenly taken ill, and in their place the two Bateman daughters&#151;Kate, aged five, and Ellen, aged three&#151;were quickly taught the roles and went on. The local newspaper reported that they &#145;performed their parts most sweetly&#146;  (<span class="italic">Louisville Daily Journal</span>, 18 Dec 1847). The two little girls earned laurels in subsequent performances in Cincinnati, followed by another season in Louisville. In May 1848 the elder Batemans left the Bates company and became managers of their small daughters.<br>
<br>Between August and October of 1851 the &#145;Bateman Children&#146; played London's St James's Theatre during the Great Exhibition, and then toured the British Isles; they returned to America in August 1852. For the next three years Hezekiah Bateman toured with the children throughout the United States, until November 1855, when he briefly assumed management of the St Louis Theatre. Between 1856 and 1859 he managed, toured with, and occasionally acted in Sidney's two plays <span class="italic">Self</span> and <span class="italic">Geraldine</span>.<br>
<br>In 1859 the Bateman family settled in Brooklyn, New York. In 1860 Ellen, with no further interest in the theatre, married a French-born silk manufacturer, Claude Greppo, and settled in Paterson, New Jersey. Kate, in the meantime, embarked on a stage career as an adult star. She made her New York d&eacute;but in her mother's adaptation of <span class="italic">Evangeline</span> at New York's Winter Garden.<br>
<br>Hezekiah Bateman managed Kate's successful tour following her New York appearance, culminating in May 1863 at New York's Niblo's Garden with the wildly popular <span class="italic">Leah, the Forsaken</span>, an adaptation by Augustin Daly of Mosenthal's <span class="italic">Deborah</span>. During the summer of 1863, now with some financial means owing to the success of <span class="italic">Leah</span>, the family could afford to enjoy a European vacation. Before returning to America, however, Bateman secured an engagement for Kate at London's Adelphi Theatre. <span class="italic">Leah, the Forsaken</span>, now in an adaptation by John Oxenford, ran for a West End record-breaking 211 nights.<br>
<br>With America in the throes of civil war, theatrical prospects in the British Isles were more promising than those in the United States. In January 1864 Bateman took Sidney and the two younger girls, Virginia and Isabel, to England, where they settled permanently. Following Kate's Adelphi engagement, Bateman managed her tour of the British Isles and, in 1866, returned with her to America for a tour of the USA. Simultaneously he managed a tour of concert artists, including Mme Parepa and Carl Rosa. Kate's marriage to George Crowe on 13 October 1866 permitted Bateman to turn management duties over to Crowe, and he was free, between 1867 and 1869, to manage the tour of a troupe of French artistes who were introducing the operettas of Jacques Offenbach to America. In January 1869 he sold his interest in the troupe to the American railroad financier Jim Fisk.<br>
<br>Bateman then returned to England and, on 22 February 1871, assumed management of London's Lyceum Theatre. His plan, initially, was to use the theatre as a showcase for Kate and the younger daughters, Virginia and Isabel, who were then embarking on their own theatrical careers. In April 1871 he saw a young actor named Henry Irving in <span class="italic">The Dream of Eugene Aram</span>. Upon his return he announced to his family: &#145;I have found the greatest actor of the century&#146;  (<span class="italic">Black and White</span>, 25 April 1896, 523).<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">Fanchette</span> and <span class="italic">Pickwick</span>, the first two Lyceum productions under Bateman's management, fell far short of financial success. On 25 November 1871, however, the future prospects for Bateman's finances improved radically with the presentation of <span class="italic">The Bells</span>, an English translation and adaptation by Leopold Lewis of the Erckmann&#150;Chatrain tale <span class="italic">Le Juif polonais</span>. Irving's weird and wonderful power in the leading role made an indelible mark on the history of British theatre and solidified both Irving's reputation and the financial position of Bateman's Lyceum.<br>
<br>Bateman and Irving followed the 151 night run of <span class="italic">The Bells</span> with <span class="italic">Charles I</span>, <span class="italic">The Dream of Eugene Aram</span>, <span class="italic">Richelieu</span>, <span class="italic">Philip</span>, and then <span class="italic">Hamlet</span>. <span class="italic">Hamlet</span>, which opened on 31 October 1874, was, from the first night, an unqualified success and a triumph for both the manager and the actor. Five months later, with <span class="italic">Hamlet</span> still on the boards, Irving organized a dinner party at a Pall Mall restaurant for Bateman, after which the group repaired to the Westminster Club for further socializing. There may have been sharp words exchanged between Bateman and the management when he was asked to leave the club at the required closing time. Upon rising the following morning, 22 March 1875, Bateman was suddenly seized by sharp chest pains, and he died within hours at his home, Rutland Lodge, Rutland Gardens, Knightsbridge, London. <span class="italic">The Times</span>, in eulogizing him, stated that &#145;he stood gallantly forward as the promoter of an intellectual and morally irreproachable drama at a day when the theatrical world was threatened with a deluge of vice and frivolity&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 24 March 1875, 8). He was buried in Kensal Green cemetery, London, on 27 March.<br>
<br>Following his demise his widow and three of his daughters, Kate, Virginia, and Isabel, attempted to keep the Lyceum going, but conflicts between Irving and Sidney Bateman finally made a parting of the ways inevitable. Irving took over the Lyceum in 1878, while the Batemans took possession of Sadler's Wells. Debts mounted at the Wells, and when Sidney died in 1881 the daughters were left to deal with the debt.<br>
<br>Kate continued to tour the British provinces before retiring in 1892, and thereafter ran a stage school in London. Virginia married the actor <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/45887/', "Edward Compton (1854&#150;1918)")</script> on 12 June 1882, and afterwards acted in and co-managed the Compton Comedy Company. Isabel, after paying off the last penny of the debt, left the theatre in 1898 and entered the Anglican sisterhood of St Mary the Virgin in Wantage, Berkshire, in time becoming mother superior of the order.<br>
