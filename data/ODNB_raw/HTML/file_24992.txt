<span class="headword">Seaton, Sir  Thomas</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1806, <em>d.</em> 1876), <span class="occ">army officer in the East India Company</span>, was baptized on 28 May 1806, the eldest son of John Fox Seaton of Pontefract and his wife, Anne. In 1822 he obtained a cadetship in the East India Company's service, and on 4 February 1823 he was commissioned as ensign in the 10th Bengal native infantry. In July he was transferred to the 2nd battalion of the 17th native infantry, stationed at Ludhiana in the Punjab. This battalion was soon afterwards converted into the 35th Bengal native infantry. He served with the 1st battalion (which had become the 34th) from October 1824 until July 1825, then returned to the 35th, and remained in it until 1857. His commission as lieutenant was dated 1 May 1824. He took part in the siege of Bharatpur, and was afterwards stationed at Meerut and in the Lower Provinces, where, at Barrackpore on 21 August 1831, he married Caroline, fourth daughter of J. Corfield of Knowle Lodge, Taunton, Somerset. On 2 April 1834 he was promoted captain. In 1836, his wife having died on 14 November 1835, he went to England on furlough for three years. He married, on 27 July 1838 at Edinburgh, Elizabeth, daughter of John Harriman of Whitehaven, Cumberland. She died on 12 November 1872.<br>
<br>Seaton returned to India in 1839. His regiment was serving in the First Anglo-Afghan War, and he hastened to join it. After crossing with a convoy the Shikarpur Desert to Bagh in the intense heat of June, he rejoined his regiment at Kabul on 8 September 1839. He remained there two years, except for a short expedition to Bamian. In October 1841, when the regiment was about to return to India as part of Sale's brigade, the Afghan rising erupted. The brigade fought through the Khurd Kabul Pass, and to Jalalabad, reaching it on 12 November, then held it.<br>
<br>During the defence of Jalalabad Seaton showed his resourcefulness. Sent to destroy an outlying fort which might give cover to the enemy, he diverted a stream to it, and so demolished it. In the first two months of the defence the wine and spirits were all consumed, but Seaton made a still with some washermen's pots and a matchlock barrel, and supplied his mess with spirits as long as there was sugar left. After the siege he was made CB. He was given the local rank of major on 4 October 1842.<br>
<br>From 1842 to 1851 Seaton was brigade major at Agra. In November 1852 he was promoted major, and in June 1854 brevet lieutenant-colonel. After three years' furlough in England he took command of his regiment at Sialkot on 31 January 1855. In May 1857 he went to Simla on account of his health, but within a week he was sent to Ambala to take command of the 60th native infantry. On 10 June the regiment mutinied, drove away its officers, and marched to join the mutineers in Delhi. The officers went to the British camp, where there was much surprise at their safe arrival.<br>
<br>Seaton served as a field officer during the earlier part of the siege. On 23 July he was dangerously wounded, and after the fall of Delhi he was sent up to Simla. In November he was again fit for duty, and was made lieutenant-colonel of the 1st Bengal (European) fusiliers, his commission dated 27 June. He was promoted brevet colonel on 13 October. With a force of 2300 men, including his own regiment, he escorted a large convoy from Delhi through the Doab, to join the commander-in-chief. He fought the mutineers near Bibrahan, at Patiali, and at Mainpuri, defeating them by skilful tactics with little loss.<br>
<br>Seaton joined Sir Colin Campbell at Fatehgarh on 7 January 1858, and was left in command there as brigadier during the siege of Lucknow. He had only a small force, but finding that the mutineers were gathering in large numbers in the neighbourhood, he marched out on the night of 6 April, attacked a force of them at Kanker, and routed them, capturing their guns and baggage, so that the main road to the north-west was no longer in danger.<br>
<br>In June Seaton was sent to Shahjahanpur, and on 8 October he surprised and defeated the Oudh mutineers at Buragaon. In the following spring, as the fighting was at an end, his brigade was broken up.<br>
<br>In March 1858 he was made KCB, and in June 1859 he retired with the rank of major-general. He published his two-volume autobiography, <span class="italic">From Cadet to Colonel</span>, in 1866, and <span class="italic">A Manual of Fret Cutting and Wood Carving</span> in 1875. After several years in England he settled in France on account of the milder climate, and he died at Chatou, Paris, on 11 September 1876.<br>
