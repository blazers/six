<span class="headword">Young,  John</span>, Baron Lisgar  (1807&#150;1876), <span class="occ">politician and colonial administrator</span>, born at Bombay on 31 August 1807, was the eldest son of Sir William Young, first baronet (<i>d</i>. 10 March 1848) and his wife, Lucy (<i>d</i>. 8 Aug 1856), youngest daughter of Lieutenant-Colonel Charles Frederick. His father was a director and large shareholder of the East India Company. Young was educated at Eton College, and matriculated from Corpus Christi College, Oxford, on 13 June 1825, graduating BA in 1829. On 26 January 1829 he was admitted to Lincoln's Inn, and in 1834 he was called to the bar, but he never practised. On 5 April 1835 he married Adelaide Annabella, daughter of Edward Tuite Dalton and his wife, Olivia (later Lady Headfort).<br>
<br>On 19 May 1831 Young was elected as a tory for the county of Cavan, and held the seat until 1855. He was throughout associated with Peel. When Peel took office in 1841 Young was appointed a lord of the Treasury on 16 September, and on 21 May 1844 he became one of the secretaries of the Treasury. On the overthrow of Peel's ministry he resigned office on 7 July 1846. Between 1846 and 1852 he was one of those who favoured integration of the Peelites into a coherent group, and he sometimes represented Peel's views to his followers. He was more inclined to Liberalism than some Peelites.<br>
<br>Under Lord Aberdeen he became chief secretary for Ireland on 28 December 1852, and was nominated a privy councillor. On 20 March 1855 he resigned the Irish secretaryship on being appointed lord high commissioner of the Ionian Islands, and on 25 March was made a GCMG. He commenced his duties on 13 April 1855, and found himself immediately at variance with the representative assembly, which his predecessor, Sir Henry George Ward, had also found difficult to conciliate. Young was not in sympathy with the desire of the majority of the inhabitants for union with Greece; and in a dispatch to the colonial secretary, Henry Labouchere (afterwards Baron Taunton), dated 10 June 1857, he recommended that Corfu and Paxo should be converted into British colonies, with the consent of their inhabitants. The dispatch was stolen from the Colonial Office and published in the <span class="italic">Daily News</span> on 12 November 1858. This misfortune rendered Young's position impossible, and in the same year Gladstone, who had been sent out as high commissioner extraordinary, recommended Young's recall. He gave strong testimony, however, to the mild and conciliatory nature of Young's administration, and recommended that he should be employed elsewhere. Young left Corfu on 25 January 1859, and on 4 February was nominated KCB.<br>
<br>On 22 March 1861 Young was appointed governor-general and commander-in-chief of New South Wales, in succession to Sir William Thomas Denison. Immediately after his arrival he was persuaded by the premier, Charles Cowper, to endeavour, by nominating fifteen new members, to compel the upper house of New South Wales to pass a measure regulating the allotment of crown lands. Denison, before his departure, had refused to accede to this expedient. Young was reprimanded by the duke of Newcastle, the colonial secretary, but allowed to complete his term. Soon after the end of his term of office, on 24 December 1867, he returned to England, and was created GCB on 13 November 1868.<br>
<br>Young determined on his return to enter active political life. Inclining to Liberalism, he consulted Gladstone as to a constituency, but found himself in disagreement with the Liberal leader on the question of the ballot. In 1868 the Conservative ministry offered him the governorship of Canada, which several men of their party, including Lord Mayo, had declined, because the Canadian parliament had impaired the dignity of the office by reducing the governor's salary. Young accepted the post, and on 2 January 1869 he was appointed governor-general of Canada and governor of Prince Edward's Island, which was not annexed to the dominion until 1873. He reached Canada towards the end of November, and found the rebellion of Louis Riel in progress. It was not suppressed until September 1870, when Riel fled into the United States. Young played an important role in the transfer to Canada of the Hudson's Bay territory of Rupert's Land and in Manitoba's joining the confederation. He acted, to the mutual irritation of both sides, as broker between the British and Canadian governments about terms for Canada's agreement to the treaty of Washington. His agreement to a Canadian bill for differential duties against American tea and coffee was given without consultation with London and raised the general question of colonial tariffs in British free-trade policy.<br>
<br>On 26 October 1870 Young was created Baron Lisgar of Lisgar and Baillieborough, co. Cavan. In poor health, he resigned in June 1872, before the end of his term, and he returned to Ireland, leaving behind him in Canada a reputation for ability and sound judgement but in the Gladstone cabinet considerable irritation. He died, childless, at Lisgar House, Baillieborough, on 6 October 1876. His widow later married Sir Francis Charles Fortescue Turville of Bosworth Hall, Leicestershire; she died in 1895. Lisgar had many opportunities and was generously handled by his colleagues. But his career was the least successful of the leading Peelites.<br>
