<span class="headword">Holm <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Gray]</span>,  Helen Warren</span>  (1907&#150;1971), <span class="occ">golfer</span>, was born on 14 March 1907 at 3 Manor Road, Jordanhill, Partick, one of two daughters of Thomas Gray (1869&#150;1932), professor of technical chemistry at the Royal Technical College, Glasgow, and his wife, Violet Irene Emma Warren. In 1928 she married Andrew Mackie Holm, a farmer, with whom she had a son.<br>
<br>Holm twice won the (British) ladies' championship in a playing career that spanned three decades and is cited as an example of the golfing longevity often attributed to the Scots. Her first championship title came at Porth-cawl in 1934, with an emphatic victory over the young Pam Barton in the final. This was the first time the championship had been won by a Scot since 1911. She repeated her success at Burnham in 1938, defeating Miss Corlett 4 and 3 in the final. Holm was also a member of three Britain and Ireland Curtis cup teams. In May 1936 she played in the drawn match at the King's course, Gleneagles, and was on the losing side at Essex Country Club, Massachusetts, in September 1938. When the match resumed after the war she was included in the British side to face the Americans at Birkdale in May 1948, and once again the visitors triumphed, extending their impressive record in the series.<br>
<br>Holm was the dominant figure of her generation in Scottish women's golf, reaching at least the semi-final round of the national championship no fewer than fifteen times between 1929 and 1964, winning the title five times and losing in five other finals. Her first victory was at Turnberry in 1930, and she won again in 1932, 1937, and 1948, securing her final title at St Andrews in 1950 at the age of forty-three. Appropriately her last appearance in the final was very close to home, at Troon in 1957. She won numerous regional championships and represented Scotland in international matches for a quarter of a century from 1932. She also played annually for the British Isles against France from 1933 to 1938 and from 1947 to 1949, and was non-playing captain of the British teams that faced France and Belgium in 1951.<br>
<br>Writing in <span class="italic">Golf between Two Wars</span> (1944), Bernard Darwin thought Mrs Holm &#145;the most striking lady player since Miss Wethered had left the lists&#146;, than which there could be no higher praise: &#145;She was not the most consistent and was capable of unexpected and perhaps light-hearted mistakes, but when in full tide of play she had a majestic power and a capacity for playing the counting shot rarely seen&#146;  (p. 132). Holm was &#145;exceptionally tall and possessed a slow, graceful swing that was given extra propulsion by moving on to her toes at impact&#146;  (Crane, 101). Her longevity in championships can be attributed to a deftness of touch which she retained into her fifties, when her strength and stamina naturally declined. It gave her a continued edge over younger opponents, and Belle Robertson, who lost to her at Turnberry in the Scottish championship of 1960, acknowledged her mastery: &#145;the sheer brilliance of her touch on a course which was that week dry and bouncy had to be seen to be believed&#146;  (Mair, 56). And like all enduring champions, Holm was both mentally and physically tough: she won the second of her five Scottish titles in 1932 with a victory at the fifth extra hole.<br>
<br>Holm died of lung cancer on 14 December 1971 at Broomfield Nursing Home, Ayr, her husband having predeceased her; her funeral took place at Masonhill crematorium, Ayr. Two years later the Helen Holm trophy event was begun at Holm's beloved Troon Portland, where she once held the ladies' record with 69 and had holed the fourteenth in one. Now one of the premier stroke-play events in the ladies' calendar, with a very high calibre entry, the final round of the trophy is played over the open championship links of Royal Troon, and the victor is awarded Holm's putter as the trophy.<br>
