<span class="headword">Maplet,  John</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1592), <span class="occ">writer on natural philosophy</span>, matriculated as a sizar from Queens' College, Cambridge, in December 1560 and graduated BA in 1564. He was a fellow of St Catharine's College in August 1564, and was ordained deacon at Ely on 5 November of that year. He was a fellow of Gonville and Caius College in 1566/7 and proceeded MA in 1567. On 26 November 1568 he was instituted, on the presentation of Sir Thomas Mildmay, to the rectory of Great Leighs, Essex, which he exchanged for the vicarage of Northolt, Middlesex, on 30 April 1576. His marriage to a widow named Ellen Leap (<i>d</i>. 1595) brought five children: Margaret, Ellen, John, Thomas, and Mary, born between 1577 and 1581.<br>
<br>When Maplet was in Cambridge he wrote the first of the two works for which he is known, <span class="italic">A Greene Forest, or, A Naturall Historie</span>. This was printed in London in 1567 and dedicated to Thomas, earl of Sussex. It is divided into sections on minerals, plants, and animals, each of which consists of alphabetically organized descriptions drawn from classical, Islamic, and humanist sources. A decade and a half later, when installed as vicar in Northolt, Maplet wrote another small book, <span class="italic">The Diall of Destiny</span>. He finished writing this in December 1581, and it was printed in London, with a dedication to Sir Christopher Hatton, the following year. In this treatise Maplet, again drawing on scholarly sources, argues that the heavens influence earthly events. He discusses the properties, effects, and qualities of each of the known planets in turn (the moon, Mercury, Venus, the sun, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn), and touches on a range of subjects from elephants to earthquakes. A third work by Maplet, &#145;Argemonie, or, The prynciple vertues of stone&#146; is reputed to have been printed in London in 1566; although this might have been the first part of <span class="italic">A Greene Forest</span>, issued separately, no copy of it seems to have survived  (C. H. Cooper, 2.135&#150;6). Maplet was buried in the chancel of Northolt church on 7 September 1592. A few weeks later his widow married Matthew Randall, a servant of her husband's glebe; she died at Ealing in 1595.<br>
<br>While Maplet's books number among the few dozen vernacular treatises on natural philosophy printed in sixteenth-century England, they have not figured in histories of these subjects. During Maplet's lifetime John Bossewell included his name alongside Geoffrey Chaucer, Sir Thomas Eliot, and others as sources for information relevant to heraldry, probably referring to <span class="italic">A Greene Forest</span>. Maplet's works continued to be read after his death. For instance, about the turn of the century Simon Forman the astrologer physician cited <span class="italic">A Greene Forest</span> for information about metals and <span class="italic">The Diall of Destiny</span> on comets; in 1675 William Cooper included <span class="italic">A Greene Forest</span> in a catalogue of English alchemical books.<br>
