<span class="headword">Kimber,  Isaac</span>  (1692&#150;1755), <span class="occ">General Baptist minister and historian</span>, was born at Wantage, Berkshire, on 1 December 1692, the son of Isaac and Mary Kimber. He attended the private grammar school in Wantage run by the Revd Mr Slopes and then continued his classical studies under John Ward at Gresham College. Believing his vocation to be in the ministry he undertook a course of training for the nonconformist ministry under John Eames at Moorfields Academy. Shortly after he had completed his course Kimber married Anna Roberts, on 28 March 1717 in Westminster, and a son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15547/', "Edward Kimber")</script>, was born in 1719. He was a non-subscriber at the Salters' Hall debate in 1719.<br>
<br>Isaac Kimber received his first ministerial appointment in 1722, as assistant to Joseph Burroughs at the chapel in Paul's Alley, Barbican, London. As a preacher, however, he proved uninspiring and unpopular and was replaced by James Foster in June 1724, whereupon he accepted the invitation of Samuel Acton to become his assistant at Baker Street Chapel in Nantwich, Cheshire. There he is reputed to have preached in 1727 the funeral sermon for John Milton's third wife, Elizabeth, but there is some doubt over the validity of this claim. Kimber proved a disappointment to many of the members of his congregation, who had looked upon him as Acton's successor, but when this seemed unlikely they resented the additional subscription for his salary and Kimber was obliged to resign at the end of 1727. He returned to London, where for a short time he was assistant to John Kinch at the chapel in Old Artillery Lane, but when the congregation amalgamated with a neighbouring one his services were no longer required and he left the active ministry. Henceforth, apart from a two-year period (1734&#150;6) when he helped to run John Ward's grammar school in Moorfields, he devoted most of his time to writing and working in various capacities for printers and publishers in London.<br>
<br>Kimber is probably more renowned for his literary efforts, and especially his historical works, than he is for his ministerial labours. For some years after being admitted into the ministry, and having a wife and child to support, he found it necessary to supplement his meagre stipend by writing. One of his first publications was <span class="italic">The Life of Oliver Cromwell</span> (1724), which ran to six editions and a French translation. He also collaborated on writing a four-volume <span class="italic">History of England</span>, which he later abridged. His account of the reign of George II was added to the 1740 edition of William Howell's <span class="italic">Medulla historiae Anglicanae</span>. In addition to his historical publications he compiled a periodical pamphlet, the <span class="italic">Morning Chronicle</span>, which appeared regularly between January 1728 and May 1732.<br>
<br>Kimber suffered a number of personal misfortunes in his life; he lost the sight of one eye and for over twenty years his wife was afflicted with mental illness. He died, in London, as a result of a stroke in January 1755 and his funeral sermon was preached by his former colleague Joseph Burroughs at Paul's Alley on 9 February.<br>
