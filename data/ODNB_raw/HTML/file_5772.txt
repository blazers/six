<span class="headword">Cockburn, Sir  James</span>, fifth baronet  (1723&#150;1809), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was the second son of John Cockburn (1675&#150;1758), a surgeon of Kilkenny, and his wife, Martha Rich (<i>d</i>. 1756). In 1754 he married Laetitia Little (1732/3&#150;1804), the daughter of Luke Little of co. Carlow. He entered the army about 1747, but, lacking funds, appears to have served as a volunteer before finally gaining an ensigncy in the 44th foot on 22 June 1755. The following year he transferred to a lieutenancy in the 35th foot and was appointed regimental adjutant; he subsequently saw action at Fort William Henry, was wounded at Louisbourg and Quebec, and in 1762 served at the capture of Martinique. With the onset of peace, Cockburn expressed resentment at the purchase of rank above him by richer but less well-qualified officers. Only on 13 April 1767 did he make captain, and only by exploiting in a presumptuous fashion the goodwill of his colonel, General Henry Fletcher, was he able, on 13 January 1776, to purchase his majority. The following October the lieutenant-colonel of the 35th was killed during the New York campaign at White Plains, and General Sir William Howe, in recognition of Cockburn's excellent conduct during the battle, promoted him to command the regiment. Cockburn, however, proved such a persecutor of his fellow officers that within a year three-quarters of them prepared a petition to General Howe complaining of their commanding officer's oppressive behaviour. Discord continued after the 35th moved to St Lucia and culminated in the court martial and cashiering of Major Edward Drewe, a rich dilettante whose rapid ascent to field rank particularly offended Cockburn.<br>
<br>In December 1780 Cockburn was appointed quartermaster-general of the army in the West Indies. Two months later he accompanied the expedition to capture the valuable Dutch island of St Eustatius. As agent for the captors and later military governor of the island he was a willing accomplice in the wholesale (and illegal) confiscation of goods by Admiral George Rodney and General Sir John Vaughan. Indeed, the contemplation of riches so blunted Cockburn's efficiency that in November 1781 he allowed St Eustatius to fall to a surprise attack. By subsequently asserting that &pound;13,000 of confiscated money was his, and because the indulgent French commander actually let him keep it, Cockburn added a charge of scandalous and infamous behaviour (although many suspected treachery) to one of culpable neglect when, in May 1783, he came to be court-martialled for the loss of St Eustatius. The outcome was his dismissal from the army.<br>
<br>In January 1800 Cockburn inherited a baronetcy from his cousin. His wife, with whom he had four children, died in 1804 aged seventy-one. Cockburn, who was probably also the father of the traveller <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/23483/', "Claudius James Rich (1786/7&#150;1821)")</script>, died on 9 June 1809, and his son <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5778/', "William Cockburn (1769&#150;1835)")</script>, also an army officer, succeeded to the baronetcy.<br>
