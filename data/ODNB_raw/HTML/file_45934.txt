<span class="headword">Carter, Sir  Charles  Bonham-</span>  (1876&#150;1955), <span class="occ">colonial governor and army officer</span>, was born on 25 February 1876 at 91 Gloucester Terrace, Kensington, London, the ninth son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/77199/', "Henry Bonham Carter (1827&#150;1921)")</script>, barrister and company director, and his wife, Sibella Charlotte (1836/7&#150;1916), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20257/', "George Warde Norman (1793&#150;1882)")</script>, merchant and director of the Bank of England. He was educated at Clifton College in 1889&#150;94 and at the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, where he was awarded the sword of honour. It was while at Sandhurst that he realized the lack of general education in the army, and a determination to rectify this took root. In February 1896 he was commissioned 2nd lieutenant, 2nd battalion Queen's Own Royal West Kent regiment, spending a leave in London where he studied singing. He could have sung professionally, but instead remained a gifted amateur.<br>
<br>A late developer, who never shone scholastically, Bonham-Carter found his niche in the army. When the South African War broke out he was in Egypt, but in 1899 he returned home to raise a mounted infantry unit to serve in South Africa. He served for nineteen months, including a short spell as adjutant, but he was invalided home in November 1901 with enteric fever, an illness which was to have later repercussions. He was awarded the queen's medal with four clasps.<br>
<br>On 22 February 1902 Bonham-Carter married Gladys Beryl, daughter of Lieutenant-Colonel Arthur Blayney Coddington RE; they had two sons. That marriage having ended in 1909, he married on 3 January 1911 Gabrielle Madge Jeanette (<i>b</i>. 1886/7), daughter of Captain Ernest Fisher. This was a marriage of great happiness and companionship, and they had a son. In 1902&#150;4 Bonham-Carter attended the Staff College, Camberley (p.s.c.). In 1904&#150;6 he was an instructor at Sandhurst, where he was able to develop his views on broadening the role of education in the army. For eight years from 1906 he held staff appointments; first as brigade major at Gibraltar, followed by a spell with the coast defences of southern command at Portsmouth. In 1910 he was appointed company commander in the 2nd battalion Royal West Kent regiment, stationed on the north-west frontier, India. Two years later he was posted back to Britain.<br>
<br>In July 1914 Bonham-Carter was ordered to Scotland as GSO2 to help organize the Cromarty Firth as a defended port. This probably saved his life, for his unit, the 1st battalion of the Royal West Kent regiment, was almost wiped out at the onset of war. Bonham-Carter rejoined his regiment in France on 14 November, when he immediately took a draft up to the front line. On 1 January 1915 he was transferred to First Army headquarters as liaison officer to Sir Douglas Haig. A year later he was promoted brevet lieutenant-colonel and appointed GSO1 to the 7th division. He fought in the battle of the Somme, and his outstanding qualities were recognized as those of a skilled and visionary planner, who was respected and liked by both superiors and subordinates. As a result he was posted as GSO1 to the senior of two staff schools at Hesdin, where his passion for training and education in the widest sense was given full rein.<br>
<br>Between April and October 1917 Bonham-Carter acted as chief of staff to General Pulteney, commander of 111 corps. In October 1917 he was posted to general headquarters to take charge of the training of the whole of the British army in France. In that year Bonham-Carter was made a DSO, being appointed CMG in 1919. After the war he received command of the 2nd battalion of the Royal Dublin Fusiliers, with whom he served in Constantinople and in India in 1919&#150;20. On his return to England he took command of the 129th South Wessex infantry brigade, Territorial Army. Though this was only a part-time post he was typically enthusiastic, and bought a house near Bath. In 1924 the result of his enteric fever in the South African War manifested itself, and he had four major operations in two and a half years. He was appointed to the rank of major-general in 1926, and from 1927 to 1931 was director of staff duties at the War Office. He was commander of the 4th division in 1931&#150;3, gaining the rank of lieutenant-general in 1933. From 1933 to 1936 he was director-general of the Territorial Army. During these appointments he played an important role in educational affairs within the army. He was knighted in 1935.<br>
<br>In February 1936, at the age of sixty, Bonham-Carter was appointed governor and commander-in-chief of Malta. He arrived at a vital time when all was not well in the island: the constitution had been suspended for three years and the political situation was confused, with fascist Italy posing a real threat. Aware of the anti-British feeling, and appalled by the exclusiveness of the British population on the island, it was Bonham-Carter's training as a commander and staff officer that now stood him in good stead. He began by making it his business to meet the most influential people on the island, the parish priests; he also attended every village club in Malta and Gozo, where the islanders foregathered. He formed a close working relationship with Malcolm Macdonald, who in 1938 had become secretary of state for the colonies, and between them they devised the 1939 Macdonald constitution, a step towards self-government for Malta. When war broke out in 1939 Bonham-Carter remained in overall command of the island, his main task being to oversee the defence of Malta.<br>
<br>In April 1940, with one year of his term as governor to run, Bonham-Carter had a major heart attack. He was forced to retire, but his contribution towards gaining the loyalty of the Maltese people during the war was acknowledged to be very great. He was appointed GCB in 1941. Charming, cultivated, a born teacher, a thinker, and a man of vision, with the common touch, he contributed much to each post throughout his life, not least to the benefit of the army. In retirement he chaired the board of governors of two schools connected with the army. He was aide-de-camp general to the king in 1938&#150;41. Bonham-Carter died on 21 October 1955, aged seventy-nine, at his home, Durford Height, Petersfield, Hampshire. His body was cremated at Petersfield and the ashes scattered in the crematorium garden.<br>
