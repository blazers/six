<span class="headword">Christophers, Sir  (Samuel) Rickard</span>  (1873&#150;1978), <span class="occ">protozoologist and tropical medicine specialist</span>, was born on 27 November 1873 in Liverpool, the elder son and eldest of three children of Samuel Hunt Christophers and his wife, Mary Selina, daughter of William Rickard, a mining expert in Redruth, Cornwall. His father, also of Cornish extraction, was head statistician of the Mersey Docks and Harbour Board. Christophers was educated at the Liverpool Institute and entered University College, Liverpool, as a medical student, at the age of sixteen. He was strongly influenced there by C. S. Sherrington. He qualified MB, ChB in 1896.<br>
<br>Christophers was then appointed a medical officer on a steamer of the Booth Line bound for the upper reaches of the Amazon; he was probably inspired by the recently published <span class="italic">Huit cents lieues sur l'Amazone</span> of Jules Verne (1881). His South American experience gave him a taste for the tropics which he never lost. On his return to England he was appointed a member of the joint malaria commission of the Royal Society and Colonial Office, a post he filled from 1898 to 1902. His senior colleague was J. W. W. Stephens and together they investigated malaria in the inhabitants of central and west Africa and later in India; they recommended measures for the control of the disease and, over fifty years later, Christophers formulated a definitive policy based on a lifetime's experience.<br>
<br>In 1902 Christophers married Elise Emma (<i>d</i>. 1963), daughter of Fitzroy Frederick Colin Sherman, a coffee planter in the Nilgiri hills, India, and his wife, Elise Blacas, daughter of the duc de Blacas, a French admiral. They had a son and a daughter. Also in 1902 Christophers joined the Indian Medical Service (IMS). He remained in the research branch for the next thirty years; this included service in Mesopotamia during the First World War. In the IMS he was appointed in turn director of the following research establishments: King Institute in Madras (1904), Central Malaria Bureau (1910), Central Research Institute of Kasauli (1920&#150;32), and kala-azar commission (1924&#150;5). India in those years was a magnet for malariologists and Christophers was the star figure in the constellation, which included John A. Sinton, S. P. James, Gordon Covell, H. E. Shortt, and their Indian fellow officers, M. K. Afridi and Jaswant Singh. The joint production by Christophers, Sinton, and Covell of successive editions of <span class="italic">How to do a Malarial Survey</span> (1928), despite the simplicity of its title, was based on profound knowledge and became the Bible of malariologists of the era.<br>
<br>Christophers left India with the rank of brevet colonel in 1932, and on his return to England he was made professor of malaria studies at the University of London in the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. In collaboration with J. D. Fulton, he worked on the biochemistry of the respiratory metabolism of <i>Plasmodium knowlesi</i>, a lethal parasite of rhesus monkeys, and on <i>Trypanosoma rhodesiense</i>, the cause of human sleeping sickness. In 1938 he left London and was given accommodation in the department of zoology in Cambridge. Here he reverted to his studies in entomology, probably his favourite subject, and in 1960 his magnum opus appeared, <span class="italic">Aedes aegypti (L): the Yellow Fever Mosquito</span>. An earlier landmark was the issue in 1933 of Christopher's volume in <span class="italic">The Fauna of British India</span> (vol. 4). At the age of ninety Christophers finally retired and spent his remaining years at Broadstone in Dorset.<br>
<br>Christophers's life was devoted to research. His first studies on the effects of malaria on the inhabitants of the tropics had revealed the paradox that the greater the density of the infection, the less was its severity as a disease, and he showed that this was due to the operation of acquired and racial immunity. He unveiled the cause of the dreaded blackwater fever by demonstrating its relationship to the irregular consumption of quinine by patients chronically afflicted with malignant tertian malaria. In addition, he made notable contributions to the taxonomy of malaria and other parasites, and was greatly interested in the transmission of leishmaniasis (kala-azar), which he suspected was due to the bite of infected sandflies, Christophers was delighted when his friend H. E. Shortt confirmed the truth of this assumption. He worked for some years on the developmental stages in ticks of <i>Babesia canis</i> (which causes a fatal disease in dogs), and tentatively described its sexual stages and zygotes; his theory had to wait almost eighty years for confirmation by electron microscopy.<br>
<br>Christophers was shy and modest, imperturbable, patient, and kind. He was quiet but cheerful, and loved the open-air life&#151;the result of his years in the tropics. In this way, he survived until he was 104. Early in his career he had escaped unscathed from the yellow fever of the South American forests; then he had to face the very real threat of a &#145;white man's grave&#146; in Sierra Leone, and eventually, by means of simple prophylaxis, he withstood the perils of malaria and blackwater fever in the Punjab, Assam, and elsewhere in the East. The latter half of his life was spent in England, where his iron constitution continued to preserve him from the rigours of civilization.<br>
<br>Christophers's centenary was celebrated by the Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene, of which he had been president (1939&#150;43), and the Royal Entomological Society of London. A year before his death, a symposium on the birth of medical entomology was dedicated to him. In the course of his life he accumulated many honours: he was honorary physician to George V from 1927 to 1930, and in 1931 he received a knighthood; he was appointed CIE in 1915 and OBE in 1918; he was elected FRS in 1926 and an honorary fellow of Downing College, Cambridge, in 1942. In addition to medals and prizes from British societies he was given honorary foreign membership of societies in the USA, Brazil, India, France, and Holland. Christophers died on 19 February 1978 at Broadstone, Dorset.<br>
