<span class="headword">Ker,  John, of Kersland</span> <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>John Crawfurd]</span>  (1673&#150;1726), <span class="occ">spy</span>, was born John Crawfurd at Crawfurdland, Ayrshire, on 8 August 1673, the eldest son of Alexander Crawfurd of Fergushill, and grandson of John Crawfurd, laird of Crawfurdland. He assumed the title and arms of Ker of Kersland in 1697 when he acquired Kersland through his wife, Anna, younger daughter of Robert Ker of Kersland. Following Robert Ker's death the estate passed to his son, Daniel Ker of the Cameronians, who was killed at the battle of Steenkerke in 1692, then to his elder daughter, Jean, who sold it to Anna's husband four years later. At the time Crawfurd acquired Kersland he was already in financial trouble, and within a few years his situation worsened so drastically that half of his property was feued and mortgaged to others. In the dedication of his <span class="italic">Memoirs</span> (published in 1726), Ker denied that money motivated him to carry out intelligence work for the government. Nevertheless his increasing impecuniosity very probably did lead him into espionage and the betrayal of members of the Cameronian sect of Presbyterians, among whom he was accepted as a leader.<br>
<br>During 1706 Scots from a series of social backgrounds and of opposing religious and political persuasions were involved in protests against the treaty of union then under negotiation with English ministers. Even Jacobites in the highlands had hopes of making common cause with the staunch Presbyterian Cameronians of the south-west, and Ker claimed that in order to achieve this the highlanders &#145;industriously concealed their true Design&#146;, namely, the restoration of the Stuart Pretender  (Ker, 1.28). On learning that the Cameronians were to meet at Sanquhar in Nithsdale to decide whether to accept the offer to join forces with the highlanders, the duke of Queensberry sent Ker to persuade them to reject the proposal. Ker accepted the commission, explaining afterwards:<blockquote>It was then I embarked so heartily in those Measures, which afterwards gave me so much Sorrow; altho' I declare solemnly, that instead of any Mischief in View at that Time, I had rather the Misfortune to believe that I was doing good Service to my own Country, and the Protestant Interest. (ibid., 1.31)</blockquote>He rode into Nithsdale &#145;full of unbridled Zeal&#146;  (ibid., 1.32), and there persuaded the sect to withhold its support. This, he claimed, was instrumental in blocking the plans of opponents of the union.<br>
<br>Others disputed Ker's role at that time and afterwards. The writer of the preface to the account of Nathaniel Hooke, Louis XIV's agent in Scotland at the time (published in 1760), commented savagely: &#145;As to the ostentatious offers of the Laird of Kersland, that gentleman's vanity and restless character is too well known in this country, to lay the smallest stress on what he advances&#146;  (Hooke, <span class="italic">Secret History</span>, iii). George Lockhart of Carnwath also despised Ker, asserting that as he<blockquote>was known to be a person highly immoral and guilty of several base actions, such as forgery and the like, no person of the least note would have the least intercourse with him, yet he found means to ingratiate himself with several people of no great rank, from whom he picked up stories. (Lockhart, 1.302)</blockquote>On his return to Edinburgh after persuading the Cameronians to reject the Jacobite overture, Ker was assured that Queen Anne would recognize the service he had rendered her government, and he was granted royal licence to associate with disaffected individuals in order to gather intelligence. By so doing he was &#145;thereby led into farther Labyrinths, and added to my misfortunes&#146;  (Ker, 1.37), being soon, according to his own account, the employer of spies and agents across the country. The first of these &#145;labyrinths&#146; involved infiltration of Jacobite plotters in the period preceding James Stuart's attempted rising of 1708. With Anne's royal licence in his pocket Ker boldly negotiated with the Jacobites, who referred to him by several codenames&#151;Thomas Trustie, Wilks, Wicks, and the Cameronian Mealmonger. Claiming to represent Cameronians of five shires, he held talks with a Roman Catholic named Strachan, offering 13,000 men for the Pretender's service and volunteering to travel to France as a hostage to their loyalty  (Hooke, <span class="italic">Correspondence</span>, 2.308&#150;9). In August 1707 he even urged the French to act soon. &#145;We are all convinced that the only way to save Scotland is to restore our king,&#146; he wrote. &#145;The opportunity is excellent; it never was so good; and if you lose it, it will never be found again&#146;  (Hooke, <span class="italic">Secret History</span>, 106&#150;7). Stuart agents revealed much of their plans to Ker, including a plot to seize Edinburgh Castle, and even supplied him with the cipher used in correspondence between Scotland and France. All this was passed to Queensberry, who once again assured him he would be rewarded. &#145;Truly, I dare say, I was rewarded just as I deserved&#146;, he boasted  (Ker, 1.47). But before the year was out Ker's duplicity had been discovered, and the duchess of Gordon told Hooke, &#145;Mr Wicks is turned a knave&#146;  (Hooke, <span class="italic">Correspondence</span>, 2.517). In March 1709 Ker travelled to London, where the lord treasurer, Lord Godolphin, paid him the money he was due. However, according to Lockhart, Ker was paid &pound;500 to &pound;600, which was increased to at least 2000 guineas after he threatened to reveal Godolphin's connections with the Jacobites  (Lockhart, 308).<br>
<br>Four years later Ker claimed he was sent to Vienna to promote a scheme for harassing French and Spanish trade. When the emperor rejected his plan, he apparently remained and passed on all the information he could to the Electress Sophia of Hanover. For his trouble he was presented with &#145;the Emperor's picture in gold, set round with diamonds&#146;  (Ker, 1.87). From Vienna Ker moved to Hanover, where he claimed to help secure the Hanoverian succession, and had the pleasure of informing the new British royal family that &#145;my Joy is so exceeding great, that I think all my Labour and Industry is more than rewarded&#146;  (ibid., 1.93). He received a couple of gold medals as a token of his majesty's favour, but wanted more. He asked for the governorship of Bermuda and was refused because, he said, he would not bribe the appropriate officials. He moved on to Holland and then to London, where he offered his services to the government at the start of the 1715 Jacobite rising, but these were rejected, and he was left at the end of the rebellion lamenting the misfortune of so many of his countrymen whose suffering he claimed he might have prevented had he been allowed to intervene. John Ker's life continued on a downhill path, with failure of an attempt to interest the emperor of Austria in the East India Company, and an unsuccessful plan to set up a trading company in the Austrian Netherlands.<br>
<br>During his time abroad Ker's wife, in desperate financial straits, had to make over her furniture and plate to friends in return for money to support herself. In 1718 he sold Fergushill to John Asgill and Robert Hackett for &pound;3600, and half of it was mortgaged back to Ker for &pound;2600. In spite of every effort he ended up in the king's bench debtors' prison in London, where he died on 8 July 1726. He was buried in St George's churchyard, Southwark. His widow soldiered on, producing a forged deed in the name of her elder sister, Jean, through whom Kersland had come to her. However, the estate and barony of Kersland was eventually sold in 1788. The couple were survived by their three daughters: Elizabeth, who married John Campbell of Ellangieg in Argyll, and Anna and Jean, of whom no further details are known. Ker's <span class="italic">Memoirs</span> was published in three volumes in 1726, the last posthumously. Even so the publisher, Edmund Curll, incurred the wrath of the government for publishing &#145;a False, Scandalous and Malicious Libel&#146; and was fined 20 marks and forced to stand in the pillory at Charing Cross for a day. Curll, however, had the last word, publishing the government's accusations against him as an appendix to the third volume, reprinted in 1727.<br>
