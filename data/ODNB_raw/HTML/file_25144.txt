<span class="headword">Sewell <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Wright]</span>,  Mary</span>  (1797&#150;1884), <span class="occ">writer and poet</span>, was born on 6 April 1797 at Sutton in Suffolk, the third of the seven children of John Wright (<i>c</i>.1770&#150;1854), farmer, and his wife, Ann (<i>c</i>.1772&#150;1856), daughter of John Holmes, farmer, of Tivetshall in Norfolk. Her parents were both from Norfolk Quaker families and her upbringing was based on Quaker principles. Before she was two, the family moved to a farm at Felthorpe in Norfolk where she spent most of her childhood. When she was twelve the farm was sold and the family moved to Yarmouth where her father entered business with a shipowner. Early education at a dame-school was followed by tuition at home under a series of governesses. At fourteen her formal education was completed by a year at a Quaker boarding-school in Tottenham. She read poetry avidly, particularly Scott, Southey, Moore, and Byron. As a result of her father's financial ruin in 1817, she became a governess at a school in Essex; it was, she wrote, &#145;a great descent in the social scale&#146;  (Mrs Bayly, 48).<br>
<br>On 15 June 1819 Mary Wright married Isaac Sewell (1793&#150;1878), whose parents were elders in the Friends' meeting at Yarmouth. The couple settled in a small house at 26 Church Plain, Yarmouth, where their first child, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25140/', "Anna Sewell (1820&#150;1878)")</script>, was born. Shortly after Anna's birth they moved to London where business difficulties resulted in Isaac's financial failure. In 1822, after the birth of their son Philip, they moved to Dalston, and Isaac became a commercial traveller selling Nottingham lace. Sewell taught her children at home: subjects including natural history and science, as well as values such as independence, obedience, faith in God, and charity. To purchase books for their education, she wrote and sold her first work, <span class="italic">Walks with Mamma</span>, a book written in words of one syllable. In 1832 the family moved to Stoke Newington where both children attended school and Anna was lamed by a fall. Over the following years Mary sought unsuccessfully for a cure for her daughter and nursed her during the periods of invalidism which recurred throughout Anna's life. Mother and daughter were always extremely close, savouring &#145;the never-ceasing joy of each other's lives&#146;  (E. B. Bayly, xxii).<br>
<br>Deeply religious, Sewell experienced a spiritual crisis in her late thirties that resulted in her leaving the Quakers and being baptized. Over the following years she experimented with various protestant denominations. In later life she wrote: &#145;If I ever joined any religious body again &hellip; it would be the Friends&#151;though I've left them&#146;  (Mrs Bayly, 84).<br>
<br>In 1836 the Sewell family moved to Brighton, where Isaac took a post as a bank manager. His future positions led to a series of homes in Sussex: in Lancing (1845&#150;9), Haywards Heath (1849&#150;53), and Graylingwell, near Chichester (1853&#150;8). 1858 saw a move to Abson, near Wick in Gloucestershire, where Sewell's writing career began. Her writing was inextricably connected to the practical and active charity work she did throughout her life. Known for being plain-spoken and having &#145;a profound appreciation &hellip; of the miseries of others&#146;  (Mrs Bayly, 169), she visited the poor and was concerned with the plight of working women and with the moral education of children. She was involved in the anti-slavery movement, mothers' meetings, prison visiting, and the temperance movement. Together with Anna she founded a Working Men's Evening Institute in Wick at which they both taught.<br>
<br>It was not until Sewell's sixtieth year that she began writing for the public: &#145;I have a knack of a rough sort of rhyming that serves my purpose&#146;, she wrote  (Mrs Bayly, 136). Her literary works, aimed at children and the working classes, were didactic, and often used pathos to teach faith in God, good behaviour, appreciation of nature, kindness, and temperance. In 1858 <span class="italic">Homely Ballads for the Working Man's Fireside</span>, a collection of verse written in simple language, appeared. <span class="italic">The Children of Summerbrook</span> (1859), a story in verse for children, followed and in 1861 <span class="italic">Stories in Verse for the Street and Lane</span> was published. Her best-seller <span class="italic">Mother's Last Words</span> (1860), recounting two young boys' obedience to their mother's dying words, &#145;had a sale unprecedented in the history of ballads&#146;  (Mrs Bayly, 146). <span class="italic">Our Father's Care</span> (1861), a poem about a young watercress girl, was, like other examples of her verse, read aloud at Sunday schools, in prisons, hospitals, and on ships. Her prose works included <span class="italic">Patience Hart's First Experience in Service</span> (1862), the story of a virtuous servant girl written in the form of letters to her mother, and <span class="italic">Thy Poor Brother</span> (1863) a work advising on poor visiting. Well-known during her writing career, her work has since been neglected, its didacticism and rhyming having fallen out of fashion.<br>
<br>In 1864 Sewell moved to Bath and in 1867, after her daughter-in-law's death, to Old Catton near Norwich to be near her son and his seven children. When approaching eighty she nursed her daughter through her final, painful seven-year illness which confined her to her sofa, during which time Mary transcribed and took dictation of Anna's only novel, the enduring classic <span class="italic">Black Beauty</span>. Her husband, increasingly feeble, also at this time became mentally ill. In 1878 her daughter, then her husband, died. Sewell remained active and involved in charity work until her own death from senile decay and congestion of the lungs on 10 June 1884 at her home, the White House, Old Catton. She was buried in the Quaker burial-ground at Lammas near Norwich.<br>
