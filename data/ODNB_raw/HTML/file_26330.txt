<span class="headword">Staveley,  William</span>  (1784&#150;1854), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, born at York on 29 July 1784, was the son of William Staveley of York and Henrietta, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Henderson, a native of Caithness. He was commissioned as ensign in the Caithness legion in 1798, served with it in Ireland during the 1798 rebellion, and when it was disbanded obtained a commission in the Royal Staff Corps on 14 July 1804. He became lieutenant on 21 April 1808, and joined Wellesley's army at Porto in May 1809. He served on the staff of the quartermaster-general throughout the Peninsular War, and was present at Talavera, Fuentes de O&ntilde;oro, Vitoria, the battle of the Pyrenees, and Toulouse, as well as at the sieges of Ciudad Rodrigo and Badajoz, and many minor actions. At Ciudad Rodrigo he volunteered to act as guide to the stormers of the light division, and was one of the first to reach the top of the smaller breach. He was stunned by an explosion as the troops made their way along the ramparts, and was picked up for dead. On 6 May 1813 he was given a company in the Royal African Corps, and on 15 December 1814 a brevet majority.<br>
<br>Staveley returned to the Royal Staff Corps on 12 January 1815, and went with a detachment of it to the Netherlands in April. He was on the headquarters staff at Waterloo, and rode with messages between Wellington and Blucher. He was made brevet lieutenant-colonel and CB (June 1815), and subsequently received a reward for distinguished service.<br>
<br>Staveley was one of two officers sent into Paris to carry out the terms of the convention of 3 July 1815, and was wounded in a skirmish with French soldiers in the Paris suburbs. He remained in France during the occupation, and returned to England in 1818. He married, on 23 January 1817, Sarah, daughter of Thomas Mather; among their children was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26328/', "Sir Charles William Dunbar Staveley")</script>.<br>
<br>In 1821 Staveley was sent with his company to Mauritius. He remained there twenty-six years, being appointed deputy quartermaster-general and commandant of Port Louis on 29 September 1825, and acting as governor for several months in 1842. When he left the colony he received an address from the inhabitants, to whom he had always shown himself &#145;juste, impartial, affable, bienveillant envers chacun&#146;.<br>
<br>Staveley was promoted colonel on 10 January 1837 and major-general on 9 November 1846. A year afterwards he left Mauritius for Hong Kong, where he commanded the garrison for three years. In March 1851 he took command of a division of the Bombay army, and in 1852 held the post of commander-in-chief for several months. In August 1853 he was given the colonelcy of the 94th regiment, and was appointed commander-in-chief at Madras, with the local rank of lieutenant-general. He took up this command on 27 October. He died suddenly on 4 April 1854 at Tippicadoo, on his way to the Nilgiri hills, and was buried at Ootacamund. The inhabitants of Mauritius put up a tablet to his memory in the protestant church at Port Louis, and another was erected in the cathedral at Madras.<br>
