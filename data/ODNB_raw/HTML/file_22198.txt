<span class="headword">Picken,  Andrew</span>  (1788&#150;1833), <span class="occ">novelist</span>, was born in Broomlands Street, Paisley, Renfrewshire. He was probably not related to the poet Ebenezer Picken, or only very distantly so  (Brown, [7]). Andrew's grandfather James Picken had come from Irvine in Ayrshire to Paisley about 1750 and was a clothier in the High Street. His son, Andrew's father, became a successful manufacturer and intended Andrew for a mercantile career. After leaving school Picken represented a Glasgow merchant firm in the West Indies but did not find the situation congenial. He returned to Scotland and became a clerk, successively, in a factory in Causeyside Street, Paisley, in the Bank of Ireland, Dublin, and in Baird's dyeworks at Pollokshaws, Glasgow. He is listed in the Glasgow directory for 1822 as &#145;agent and accountant&#146;. He married Janet Coxon (1792&#150;1871), daughter of an Edinburgh bookseller. They had two daughters and four sons including the lithographer <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22199/', "Andrew Picken (1815&#150;1845)")</script>.<br>
<br>In 1824 Picken, as Christopher Keelivine (&#145;pencil&#146; or &#145;crayon&#146;), published in one volume <span class="italic">Tales and Sketches of the West of Scotland</span> in which his &#145;Sketch of changes in society and manners, in the west of Scotland during the last half-century&#146; satirized contemporary trading methods (the current &#145;push&#146; as against eighteenth-century straight dealing) and made him unpopular in certain quarters. One of the stories in the volume, &#145;Mary Ogilvie&#146;, was reprinted subsequently in several editions. He moved to Liverpool and set up as a bookseller, but disappointed in this venture, he went to London, where he soon became popular as a man of letters, associating with William Godwin, Wentworth Dilke, Bryan Waller Procter, John Galt, and others, and regularly attending the literary conversaziones of the painters Henry Pickersgill and John Martin.<br>
<br>In 1829 Picken's novel <span class="italic">The Sectarian</span> powerfully depicted a mind ruined by religious fanaticism, and was well reviewed but did not sell. However, <span class="italic">The Dominie's Legacy</span> (1830), which drew largely on the author's knowledge of Paisley characters and his own experience, fairly established his popularity. His <span class="italic">Travels and Researches of Eminent English Missionaries</span> (1831) quickly ran through two large editions. In the same year he edited, in three volumes, <span class="italic">The Club-Book</span>, which included tales and sketches by Galt, Tyrone Power, William Jerdan, Hogg, Allan Cunningham, D. M. Moir, and himself. Two of his own contributions&#151;&#145;The Three Kearneys&#146;, a vigorous Irish story, and &#145;The Deer-Stalkers of Glenskiach: a Highland Legend&#146; (based on information from Hogg)&#151;were instantly popular, the latter being dramatized and successfully played at the Queen's Theatre, London. In 1832, taking advantage of the then current emigration craze, Picken published <span class="italic">The Canadas</span>, for which John Galt supplied materials. <span class="italic">Waltham</span> (1832), another novel, was followed in 1833 by <span class="italic">Traditionary Stories of Old Families and Legendary Illustrations of Family History</span>, an ambitious work of &#145;domestic biography&#146;, for which he was offered access to the archives of many titled families. <span class="italic">The Black Watch</span> (1834) a posthumous novel, set around the battle of Fontenoy in 1745, Picken himself considered his best work. He left a manuscript <span class="italic">Life of John Wesley</span> and miscellaneous notes entitled &#145;Experience of life&#146;, which have not been published. Picken is of the school of Galt in his social observation and satire. Where he is strongest is in his delineation of Scottish life and character, and the books thus charged with his own knowledge and opinions are still readable.<br>
<br>Contemporaries considered Picken to be like the Dominie of his book, amiable, upright, simple-minded and tender-hearted. Chambers described him as having a &#145;restless and aspiring spirit&#146;. He died of apoplexy on 23 November 1833 at his London home, Gothic Cottages, Regent Park, East.<br>
