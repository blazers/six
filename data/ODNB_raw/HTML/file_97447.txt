<span class="headword">Barr,  James</span>  (1924&#150;2006), <span class="occ">Old Testament scholar</span>, was born on 20 March 1924 at 5 Melville Street, Glasgow, the son of Allan Barr, schoolteacher, later minister of religion and professor of <span class="roman">New Testament</span> language and literature at the United Free Church college in Edinburgh, and his wife, Agnes Christina, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Dryburgh. His paternal grandfather was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/40286/', "James Barr (1862&#150;1949)")</script>, United Free Church minister and Labour MP; <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/48834/', "Elizabeth Brown Barr (1905&#150;1995)")</script>, the first woman to be ordained as a Presbyterian minister in Scotland, was an aunt. He was educated at Daniel Stewart's College, Edinburgh, and from 1941 the University of Edinburgh, where he read classics, his studies being interrupted by war service from 1942 to 1945 in the Fleet Air Arm of the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve. He returned to Edinburgh in 1945 and took his degree in 1948. Following study at New College, Edinburgh, he was ordained in 1951 to the ministry of the Church of Scotland and served for two years as minister in Tiberias, Israel. On 10 February 1950, at Trinity Church, Perth, he married Jane Jackson Stewart Hepburn, a schoolteacher (and daughter of James Hepburn, postal inspector), whom he had met as a student of classics in Edinburgh. They had two sons and a daughter.<br>
<br>From 1953 to 1955 Barr was professor of <span class="roman">New Testament</span> literature and exegesis at the Presbyterian College, Montreal, and having embarked on an academic career was successively professor of <span class="roman">Old Testament</span> literature and theology at Edinburgh University (1955&#150;61), professor of <span class="roman">Old Testament</span> literature and theology at Princeton Theological Seminary (1961&#150;5), professor of Semitic languages and literatures at Manchester University (1965&#150;76), Oriel professor of the interpretation of holy scripture at Oxford University (1976&#150;8), and regius professor of Hebrew at Oxford University (1978&#150;89). Following his retirement from Oxford he accepted the position of professor of Hebrew <span class="roman">Bible</span> at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee, a post he held until 1998. His university career was such that he was able to escape the worst of the financial constraints and need to meet government targets that increasingly diverted attention away from academic matters in universities in Britain, although he played an important part in helping the Oxford theological faculty to gain adequate administrative accommodation.<br>
<br>Barr made a contribution to <span class="roman">Old Testament</span> and biblical scholarship that was unrivalled in the latter part of the twentieth century. He was driven by a desire for clarity and accuracy and he brought to this task a competence in disciplines previously outside the normal range of <span class="roman">Old Testament</span> scholars, including linguistics. He had a penetrating and searching intellect and expressed his criticisms formidably, if always fairly. The severity of some of his writing contrasted strikingly with his personal manner. He was a soft-spoken, diffident, almost shy man, who looked much younger than he was, and who seemed to be blessed with eternal youth and vitality. He spoke with a uvular &#145;r&#146;, which became especially noticeable in pronouncing words like &#145;retroversion&#146;. His lecturing style was characterized by clarity and originality.<br>
<br>Barr's first major work, <span class="italic">The Semantics of Biblical Language</span> (1961), was an attack on a way of using the <span class="roman">Bible</span> that assumed that it was a privileged medium of divine revelation accessible through studies of the Hebrew language, especially etymologies that underlay key theological concepts. This approach was known generally as &#145;biblical theology&#146; and it had deep roots in some continental European scholarship as well as in Britain and North America. Barr showed that it was based on an inadequate knowledge of semantics, as understood in linguistics, and argued that theology had to take account of larger linguistic units than verbal &#145;roots&#146;. He showed that biblical studies could not operate in ignorance of other disciplines pertinent to its study, and he opened the door to the later interdisciplinary study of the <span class="roman">Bible</span>, in the process rescuing the field from becoming moribund and introspective. His second major work, <span class="italic">Comparative Philology and the Text of the Old Testament</span> (1968), was a critique of a method of understanding biblical Hebrew that used other Semitic languages to recover &#145;lost&#146; Hebrew words. While Barr did not reject the validity of the approach he showed that in practice it assumed that there had been far too many homonyms in ancient Hebrew, which raised the question how the language could have been an effective means of communication. When the <span class="roman">Old Testament</span> section of <span class="italic">The New English Bible</span> was published in 1970 it was found to be so vulnerable to the criticisms that had been made in Barr's book that a revision was seen to be necessary. It appeared in 1989 in <span class="italic">The Revised English Bible</span>. In between these two works appeared <span class="italic">Old and New in Interpretation</span> (1966) based upon the Currie lectures. This book was addressed not only to academics, but indicated Barr's concern that students preparing for ministry should be enabled to use the <span class="roman">Bible</span> effectively in their work and preaching. It reviewed ways in which Christian theology had sought to relate the <span class="roman">Old</span> and <span class="roman">New</span> testaments and was critical of what Barr called &#145;purist&#146; approaches that argued that only principles derived from the <span class="roman">Bible</span> itself could yield satisfactory criteria for interpretation. (He was later unsympathetic to B. S. Childs's influential &#145;canonical criticism&#146; for this reason.) Barr argued for a readiness to interpret the biblical text in a way that involved exposure to other disciplines, including philosophy. Such ideas were unusual at the time and helped to shape future thinking on the subject. These books laid down the principles that were expanded in Barr's later works, notably the major studies <span class="italic">Fundamentalism</span> (1977) and <span class="italic">The Concept of Biblical Theology: an Old Testament Perspective</span> (1999, based on the 1968 Cadbury lectures), as well as <span class="italic">Holy Scripture: Canon, Authority, Criticism</span> (1983), <span class="italic">Escaping from Fundamentalism</span> (1984), and <span class="italic">The Garden of Eden and the Hope of Immortality</span> (1992). In 2000 he published <span class="italic">History and Ideology in the Old Testament: Biblical Studies at the End of a Millennium</span>, based on the Hensley Henson lectures. This masterly survey evaluated the state of a discipline that Barr had helped to shape, while expressing trenchant criticisms of some of its developments.<br>
<br>Barr was able to accept many invitations to lecture in Britain and abroad, and to deliver special series of lectures. He held visiting professorships at the Hebrew University, Jerusalem (1973), Chicago University (1975, 1981), Strasbourg University (1975&#150;6), Brown University, Providence, Rhode Island (1985, 1994), Otago University, New Zealand (1986), the University of South Africa, Pretoria (1986), Vanderbilt University (1987&#150;8), and, following his retirement from Oxford, at Heidelberg University (1993) and the Chinese University of Hong Kong (2003). Special lecture series included the Currie lectures (Austin Seminary, Texas, 1964), the Cadbury lectures (Birmingham University, 1968), the Croall lectures (Edinburgh University, 1970), the Grinfield lectures on the <span class="roman">Septuagint</span> (Oxford University, 1974&#150;8), the Sprunt lectures (Richmond Theological Seminary, Virginia, 1982), the Schweich lectures of the British Academy (1986), the Hensley Henson lectures, Oxford University (1997), and the Gifford lectures (Edinburgh, 1999). Many of these series became the basis for his books. Honours flowed to him from many parts of the world. He was elected a fellow of the British Academy in 1969, and corresponding member of the G&ouml;ttingen Academy of Sciences (1976), the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters (1977), and the Royal Society of Sciences, Uppsala (1991). Honorary degrees were conferred upon him by nine universities or colleges around the world.<br>
<br>During the second part of the twentieth century there was no scholar who could match Barr's combination of mastery of the minutiae of biblical scholarship with his insights into the wider and theological implications of the use of the <span class="roman">Bible</span>. Inevitably there were disappointments. In 1974 Barr took over the <span class="italic">Oxford Hebrew Dictionary</span> project, which up to then had proceeded on principles not exactly those of Barr. There was no one better qualified to reorganize and direct the work, but in 1980 Oxford University Press decided that it could no longer fund the project and it was abandoned. Again, Barr's acceptance of so many visiting professorships and requests for special lectures necessitated absences from his institutions that perturbed some of his colleagues, and resulted in his having few research students. This was a price that had to be paid for the books and lectures that were such an important contribution to biblical scholarship.<br>
<br>After his retirement from Vanderbilt Barr moved to Claremont in California, although he continued to travel and to accept invitations to lecture. In 2005 he sustained serious head injuries from a fall at a meeting of the American Philosophical Society in Philadelphia. Another fall the following year was the prelude to his death in Claremont on 14 October 2006, although the cause of death was given as bone cancer. After the funeral in California his ashes were interred near Christ Church Cathedral, Oxford. He was survived by his wife and children.<br>
