<span class="headword">Hezlet <span class="st"> [<em>married name </em>Ross]</span>,  Mary Elizabeth Linzee <span class="st"> [May]</span></span>  (1882&#150;1978), <span class="occ">golfer</span>, was born in Gibraltar on 29 April 1882, one of eight children of Richard Jackson Hezlet (<i>b</i>. 1840), a major in the Royal Artillery, and his English-born wife, Emily Mary Linzee Owen. Richard Hezlet inherited Bovagh House in co. Londonderry on the death of his brother in 1887 and retired later as a lieutenant-colonel. Most of May Hezlet's formative years were spent in Ulster, her time divided between Bovagh and the resort town of Portrush about 15 miles away, where both her parents played golf. It was here also that May and her five surviving siblings learned the sport. She is said to have started at the age of nine and she had no professional tuition. In 1895 both the Irish ladies' close and British ladies' open championships were held at Portrush. Competing along with her mother and her older sister Emmy, thirteen-year-old May made her d&eacute;but in both events but lost her first match in each. It was three years before she made another attempt at championship golf. On this occasion she reached the final of the 1898 Irish close and lost to Jessie Magill by just one hole.<br>
<br>In the following year the Irish close and the British championships were held in Newcastle, co. Down, in successive weeks. On 6 May 1899 May Hezlet won her first Irish title by defeating Rhona Adair in the final. Two days later the British championship began with the preliminary stroke competition, which she won, and on 12 May she emerged as champion. At the age of seventeen years and thirteen days she set a record that lasted throughout the twentieth century as the youngest winner of the event. She defended the two titles unsuccessfully in 1900, when her friend and arch-rival Rhona Adair claimed both. In 1901, in a team which included her mother, May represented Ireland for the first time, in a friendly match against England. In later years her younger sisters Violet and Florence were to become regular members of the national team; in 1904 May, Violet, Florence, and their mother all played in the Irish team. Much later her brother Charles became a leading amateur golfer who reached the final of the British championship in 1914 and played on the Walker cup side three times in the 1920s.<br>
<br>May Hezlet took a second British title in 1902, when she beat Elinor Nevile on the twentieth hole in the final at Deal in Kent. In 1904 she won the Irish championship a second time and reached the final of the British again, but on this occasion lost to Lottie Dod by one hole. Parallel to her success as a golfer, May Hezlet developed a reputation as a commentator on the game by writing articles in periodicals such as the <span class="italic">Irish Golfer</span>. Her one book, <span class="italic">Ladies' Golf</span>, first published in 1904 and updated in 1907, included instruction for lady golfers and touched on etiquette as well as commenting on the skills of leading players and recording the results of important events throughout the world. Her style was lucid and her book provided one of the few first-hand insights into the early years of ladies' golf.<br>
<br>In 1905 May Hezlet defeated her sister Florence in the final of the Irish close, and on 25 May both played in the historic first international between the British Isles and America at Cromer in Norfolk, the match which led eventually to the biennial Curtis cup series. The home side won, with May Hezlet defeating Margaret Curtis. In 1907 the British championship returned to Newcastle, co. Down. Preceding the event, Ireland won the ladies internationals, but May Hezlet lost her matches against England and Wales. However, in the championship she advanced to the final, where again she overcame her sister Florence to claim her third and final British title. She won the last of her five Irish close championships in 1908 with another final victory over Florence. She did not compete in either championship in 1909 because of her marriage on 27 April that year to Arthur Edwin Ross (1869&#150;1923), then Church of Ireland rector of Portrush parish, the son of David Ross of Glenageary, co. Dublin. Though they had no children, her subsequent participation in important golf events was noticeably reduced. There is a suggestion that this was because her husband thought competitive golf unbecoming for a clergyman's wife.<br>
<br>May Hezlet's last appearance for the Irish team was in 1912; she also contributed to Horace Hutchinson's <span class="italic">The New Book of Golf</span>, published in that year. Also in 1912 her husband was appointed rector of Ballymena. After serving as an army chaplain in the First World War he became rector of Holywood, co. Down, in 1919 and in January 1920 he was elected bishop of Tuam, Killala, and Achonry. He died on 24 May 1923. As a 41-year-old widow, Mrs Ross returned to Portrush for a time before moving to London, where she worked for the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel. In later years she shared the house of her sister Violet in Wiltshire, but in the late 1970s she moved to a nursing home, St Bart's, Dover Road, Sandwich, Kent, where she died on 27 December 1978.<br>
<br>May Hezlet was one of the most accomplished and successful players of the early days of ladies' golf. As a writer she contributed to the popularity of the sport and to the development of the ladies' game. Her commentary on her contemporaries provides a valuable record for golf historians.<br>
