<span class="headword">Stewart,  William</span>, first Viscount Mountjoy  (<em>c.</em>1650&#150;1692), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was the only son of Sir Alexander Stewart, second baronet (<i>d</i>. 1650), and Catherine (<i>d</i>. 1714), daughter of Sir Robert Newcomen, bt. He was born shortly before or, in some accounts, six weeks after his father died fighting Cromwell at Dunbar on 3 September 1650. His mother then married Sir Arthur Forbes, who was created earl of Granard in 1684. His grandfather Sir William Stewart (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1647) was an undertaker for the plantation of Ulster, sat in the Irish parliament for co. Donegal in 1613&#150;15, was created a baronet in 1623, and fought with great distinction in the 1641 rising. Stewart succeeded his father as the third baronet and on his majority inherited much property in Donegal and Tyrone. He married Mary Coote, daughter of Richard, first Baron Coote of Coloony, and Mary, daughter of George St George, with whom he had six sons and two daughters.<br>
<br>Stewart became a privy councillor in 1672 and in 1678 was appointed the chief magistrate of co. Donegal. He was also the commissioner of revenue for that county from 1682 until 1687. He was active in enforcing the laws against protestant dissenters and in suppressing banditry. &#145;There never was such a winter for country sports as the past and I have enjoyed them in much perfection&#146;, he wrote in early 1683. &#145;We have not had more success in any sport than Tory hunting. Of thirteen in the country where I live in November, the last was killed two days before I left home&#146;  (<span class="italic">Ormonde MSS</span>, 6.544). By a patent dated 19 March 1683 he was created baron of Ramelton and Viscount Mountjoy, after which he took the lease of Mountjoy Castle, co. Tyrone. On 9 May 1684 he sold his commission as the captain of the King's company of guards in Ireland, a post he had held since 1677, and purchased from Lord Longford the life appointment of master-general of the ordnance in Ireland. In March 1685 he was appointed the colonel of a new regiment of foot on the Irish establishment. He was a patron of the Dublin Philosophical Society, to whom his paper on specific gravity &#145;Archimedes's problem of King Hiero's crown&#146; was read in 1685. In that year he arranged for his son to tour Europe with William Molyneux. In 1686 he travelled to London intending to meet his son from France and then send him on his way to Hungary, where the imperialists were at war with the Turks. He was preceded by letters from Clarendon, the lord lieutenant of Ireland, to Lord Dartmouth describing him as &#145;a man of great worth and honour, and one who makes it his business to serve the king&#146;, and to John Evelyn as a man &#145;of vertu, and an encourager of ingenuity&#146;. His stay in London was brief. &#145;He had nothing in his head, when he was in England, but the wars of Hungary, whither he was resolved to go against the opinion of all his friends&#146;  (<span class="italic">Correspondence of Henry Hyde</span>, 1.241, 251, 407). With his son and half-brother he set out for Buda, which was under siege. He joined the imperial army as a volunteer and in a night attack on the breach was &#145;insignificantly hurt at the eye&#146; by a stone fired from a cannon  (<span class="italic">Downshire MSS</span>, 191). Buda fell to the imperialists in September 1686, after which he returned to Ireland and was promoted to brigadier-general in 1687. He was by then one of the few protestants in senior positions in the army as the new lord deputy, Tyrconnell, was purging the army.<br>
<br>Mountjoy's regiment was garrisoned in Londonderry at the time of the English revolution, but was ordered to Dublin in November 1688 so that it could be replaced by Lord Antrim's newly raised regiment of Catholics, who were mostly trouserless highlanders, colloquially known as the Redshanks. Mountjoy left the city on 23 November 1688, but Lord Antrim's men did not arrive until 7 December, which gave the citizens the opportunity to shut the city gates on them and deny them entry. When news of this reached Dublin, Tyrconnell ordered Mountjoy and his regiment to return and secure Londonderry. On 21 December 1688 at Raphoe, Mountjoy met a deputation from the city led by George Phillips, the acting governor. Mountjoy entreated them to &#145;be cautious of falling into blood&#146;  (McCarmick, 11) and got them to agree to allow two companies of protestant troops into the city while he went back to Dublin to procure a general pardon. He left behind him two of his sons as pledges and his lieutenant-colonel, Robert Lundy, in charge of the garrison. In Dublin he urged the lord deputy not to provoke a civil war. Tyrconnell appeared to be sympathetic, fearing that Mountjoy would &#145;take the occasion of heading the considerable numbers of northern Protestants, who in all likelihood would choose him for their general, as being the best soldier amongst them all, and the most leading Protestant of Ulster&#146;  (Gilbert, 43). To get him out of the way, Tyrconnell agreed to send Mountjoy to France to advise King James to make terms with William so as to avoid turning Ireland into &#145;a heap of rubbish&#146;  (<span class="italic">Ormonde MSS</span>, 8.14). Before leaving Dublin, Mountjoy left a circular letter announcing, &#145;I am morally assured that this must do our work without blood, or the misery of the kingdom&#146;  (King, 339). Tyrconnell arranged for Mountjoy to be accompanied by Sir Stephen Rice, who had secret instructions to advise the king otherwise. They arrived at St Germain on 11 February 1689 and Mountjoy was arrested on James's orders ten days later, shortly before James left for Ireland. Mountjoy spent the duration of the Irish war in the Bastille, during which time he was attainted by the Dublin parliament and deprived of his lands. It was thought imprudent to exchange him because of the danger he would pose in Ireland. He was eventually exchanged for Richard Hamilton only when the Irish war was over, and arrived in London on 28 April 1692.<br>
<br>That summer King William was with the Anglo-Dutch army in Flanders. Mountjoy travelled back to the continent in the hope of getting some form of compensation for his three years of incarceration, but had the misfortune to arrive at the royal camp on the eve of the battle of Steenkerke. During the next day, 3 August 1692, he was &#145;killed by a cannon bullet as he was watching the action&#146;  (<span class="italic">Finch MSS</span>, 340). He was survived by his wife, and succeeded in the title by his eldest son, William (<i>d</i>. 1728).<br>
