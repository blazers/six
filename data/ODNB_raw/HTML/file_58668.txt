<span class="headword">Cecil,  Evelyn</span>, first Baron Rockley  (1865&#150;1941), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born on 30 May 1865 at 32 Eccleston Square, London, the elder son and first of three children of Conservative MP Lord Eustace Brownlow Henry Gascoyne-Cecil (1834&#150;1921), fourth son of the second marquess of Salisbury, and his wife, Lady Gertrude Louisa Scott (<i>d</i>. 1919). Evelyn went to Eton College and New College, Oxford (1884&#150;7). He took a second in jurisprudence and made a world tour before reading for the bar at the Inner Temple and joining the western circuit in 1889. Two years later, however, he gave up the law to become assistant private secretary (1891&#150;2, 1895&#150;1902) to the prime minister, who was his uncle, Lord Salisbury (even though his father viewed Salisbury as a betrayer of true Conservatism).<br>
<br>While the Conservatives were in opposition, Cecil wrote a scholarly study of primogeniture (seen by him as a path to the ideal of refinement) and won a seat on the London school board (1894&#150;9), where he made his name as a champion of religious education. A high-church Anglican like all the Cecils, he would have liked denominational divinity lessons to be available to all. The <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/73167/', "Hon. Alicia Margaret Tyssen-Amherst (1865&#150;1941)")</script>, garden historian, became his wife on 16 February 1898. They had three children.<br>
<br>Evelyn Cecil, the first parliamentary candidate to use a motor car, secured a narrow victory at the Hertford by-election of 22 June 1898. A cogent speaker, with pleasant features and a thick moustache, he continued to specialize in educational and church issues, and could always be relied on to oppose legalization of marriage with deceased wife's sister. Less predictably he soon emerged as a fervent imperialist after visiting South Africa in 1899&#150;1900. His book <span class="italic">On the Eve of War</span> (1900) argued that peace had been impossible with a corrupt Boer oligarchy intent on turning the Transvaal into a hotbed of pan-Afrikaner conspiracy. After Britain overran the Boer states Cecil endorsed Alfred Milner's plan to flood the new colonies with English-speaking immigrants. Concern about German penetration of east Africa inspired him to propose the select committee on foreign steamship subsidies and their effect on British trade, which he chaired in 1901&#150;2.<br>
<br>Cecil, who had transferred to the safe seat of Aston Manor, near Birmingham, in 1900, agreed to serve on the executive council of the Tariff Reform League at its launch on 21 July 1903. Imperial preference joined church schools, empire migration, and merchant shipping as one of his primary interests; Joseph Chamberlain had few stauncher Conservative disciples.<br>
<br>New Liberal reforms provoked fierce condemnation from Cecil, who contended that free school meals would check the flow of charity, encourage irresponsible parental behaviour, and sap the foundations of national independence. Passive resistance by taxpayers and a flight of capital abroad might be the result of the 1909 budget. He attacked women's suffrage and the payment of MPs. His own income came from directorships: of the Foreign and Colonial Investment Trust Company (1896&#150;1940), the London and South Western Railway (1902&#150;23), and the Southern Railway (1923&#150;41). A member of many international railway congresses between 1905 and 1937, he could speak with knowledge on railway legislation.<br>
<br>Though never as prominent in the House of Commons as his cousins Lord Hugh Cecil and Lord Robert Cecil, Evelyn Cecil took part in all the debates on disestablishing the Welsh church between 1912 and 1914. The theme of his political life throughout the ensuing decade, however, was the need to economize: the Liberals had let loose a spirit of reckless expenditure, and war added urgency to his calls to minimize waste. A member of the committee on public retrenchment, set up in July 1915, he campaigned doggedly for an increase in the postal rate from 1<i>d</i>. to 1&frac12;<i>d</i>. until its enactment in May 1918. He was sworn of the privy council on 13 June 1917 and attended the inter-allied parliamentary committee (1916&#150;18), at which British MPs and peers met French and Italian deputies and senators. Consciousness of the war debt burden made him persist in urging thrift after 1918, when his recommendations included scrapping labour exchanges, replacing super-tax with graduated income tax, and strengthening the powers of the Treasury.<br>
<br>A senior back-bencher, Cecil was chairman of the select committee on the telephone service (1921&#150;2) and the Home Office committee on young offenders (1925), and he served on the royal commission on honours (1921&#150;2). Wartime charity work as secretary-general of the order of St John of Jerusalem (1915&#150;21) largely accounted for his own knighthood in January 1922. The greatest legislative achievement of his career came at the third attempt in December 1926, when the <span class="roman">Judicial Proceedings (Regulation of Reports) Act</span> outlawed salacious press coverage of divorce cases. Still eager to encourage dominion settlement, Sir Evelyn visited Australia with an empire parliamentary delegation in 1926. (He had been shortlisted for the governor-generalship the previous year.)<br>
<br>In 1929 Cecil did not seek re-election for Aston (the name of his constituency since the boundary changes of 1918), yet his public life continued in an undramatic way. He was chairman of a Board of Trade committee on deaths by coal gas poisoning in 1930, and the new year honours of 1934 brought him a peerage, as Baron Rockley of Lytchett Heath. He had inherited Lytchett Heath House near Poole in Dorset from his father in 1921 and purchased picturesque Rockley Sands on the shores of Poole harbour to preserve them from factory development.<br>
<br>Rockley introduced a <span class="roman">Life Peers Bill</span> in 1935 in accordance with his long-standing interest in cautious reform of the House of Lords (which predated his participation in the second chamber conference chaired by James Bryce in 1916&#150;17). The Lords passed it, but the Commons found no time. On 14 December 1935 he took on his final major assignment: the chairmanship of the royal commission on safety and health in coalmines, set up to consider revision of the <span class="roman">Coal Mines Act</span> of 1911 in the light of the Gresford disaster of 22 September 1934, when 266 men were killed in a pit explosion. The Rockley report of 1938 (&#145;Safety in coal mines&#146;, <span class="italic">Parl. papers</span>, 1938&#150;9, 13, Cmd 5890) suggested greater powers for mines inspectors (but legislation had to wait until 1954). Evelyn Cecil made his last speech in the Lords in March 1939 on the subject of pithead baths. After retiring to Dorset, he died on 1 April 1941 at Lytchett Heath, where his funeral took place at the family's private chapel (later St Aldhelm's Church) on 5 April. His wife, Alicia, survived him by only a few months, dying on 14 September 1941. He was succeeded as second Baron Rockley by his son, Robert William Evelyn.<br>
