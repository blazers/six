<span class="headword">Bulkeley,  William</span>  (1691&#150;1760), <span class="occ">diarist</span>, was born on 4 November 1691 at Brynddu in the parish of Llanfechell, Anglesey, the second son of William Bulkeley (<i>d</i>. 1699) and Lettice (<i>d</i>. 1750), daughter of Captain Henry Jones of Llangoed in Anglesey. His father died when he was a mere boy and his mother married a second and third husband.<br>
<br>William Bulkeley received a sound education and may have attended the grammar school at Beaumaris. On 22 March 1710 he married Jane (1693&#150;1714), the daughter of Ambrose Lewis, rector of Llanrhuddlad, a neighbouring parish. After bearing three children, Catherine, Mary, and William, Jane died in January 1714 on the day her son was baptized; William Bulkeley did not remarry. On coming of age he had inherited his father's estate which consisted of Brynddu and some scattered farms in nearby parishes.<br>
<br>Bulkeley lived a fairly uneventful life, but he recorded the latter part of that life in two volumes of a personal diary, the first covering the period from 30 March 1734 until 8 June 1743, the second 1 August 1747 to 28 September 1760. These diaries, along with other complementary sources, provide a valuable insight into the daily life of a fairly typical Anglesey landowner: Bulkeley's running of his estate, cattle-dealing in the local fairs, his duties as justice of the peace, his extended visit to Dublin and its playhouses, his references to Anglesey politics, and his religious convictions. The diaries also disclose that he was burdened with a heavy debt, that he opposed the unfortunate marriage in 1738 of his daughter Mary to <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30031/', "Fortunatus Wright")</script>, the famous privateer from Liverpool, and that he accepted resolutely the waywardness and death of his only son and heir in 1751.<br>
<br>Although references to William Bulkeley's adherence to Welsh culture in the diaries are brief, for example his patronizing of Welsh harpists, other sources confirm his interest in Welsh poetry, music, and antiquities. He was distantly related to Lewis Morris, and it was probably due to the latter's influence, which had begun in 1725, that he undertook the task of copying into one volume (NL Wales, MS 832) a variety of Welsh poems, a substantial number of which are seventeenth-century works in free metre. He was an active member of Lewis Morris's group of friends in Anglesey until 1742, but his fairly strict religious attitude would have prevented him sharing in Morris's experiments with ribald poetry and prose.<br>
<br>When Bulkeley was fifty-one years old nonconformity took a hold in central Anglesey. The Anglican clergy actively resisted the nonconformists, who were persecuted in their homes, in their public worship, in the civil and especially the ecclesiastical courts, and through the printed word. True to his character Bulkeley was incensed by the opposition of the clergy to the nonconformists and made his views on the subject public. His stand reached a climax in 1747, when the Revd Thomas Ellis of Holyhead published the first edition of a Welsh tract, <span class="italic">Byrr Grynh&ocirc;ad</span>, attacking the nonconformists, to which Bulkeley responded with a handwritten tract which was circulated, but of which no copy has survived. In a second edition of Ellis's tract there are hurried additions which are a direct response to Bulkeley's tract, and include an invitation to him to set a farm to the chief nonconformist. Needless to say Bulkeley set one of his farms to William Prichard, the leader of the Anglesey nonconformists. There are several other references which confirm Bulkeley's sympathetic attitude to the beleaguered nonconformists in Anglesey.<br>
<br>William Morris, brother of Lewis Morris and himself a staunch churchman, wrote in 1754 that Bulkeley was an unhypocritical and honest person, a view which he restated when he heard of Bulkeley's death in October 1760 at Brynddu. Bulkeley was buried on 28 October 1760 at the parish church of Llanfechell.<br>
