<span class="headword">Stouford <span class="st"> [Stowford]</span>, Sir  John</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1359), <span class="occ">justice</span>, took his name from Stowford, in the parish of West Down, Devon. Nothing is known of his parentage or early legal career, until in April 1329 he was nominated as attorney for Hugh Audley. In the following Michaelmas term he was created a serjeant and began to plead in the bench. In October 1330 he was first appointed to a commission of oyer and terminer, and thereafter is increasingly frequently recorded as both pleader and commissioner, in the latter capacity being most often employed in the south and south-west, particularly Devon, where he was a keeper of the peace in 1332. In Easter term 1339 he was appointed a king's serjeant, and in the same year received the first of many summonses to parliament among the king's justices. In 1340 he was appointed to oversee the defences of the coasts of Devon against a threatened French invasion, two months later to investigate the value of that year's ninth in Surrey. But more often he is recorded as acting in a judicial capacity. In 1341 he became a justice of assize for the western circuit of counties; in 1344 a man was pardoned for his part in a violent commotion &#145;at Somerton in the hall of pleas before John de Stouford and his fellows, justices of assize in that county&#146;  (<span class="italic">CPR</span>, <i>1343&#150;5</i>, 270).<br>
<br>The incident did Stouford's career no harm. Although his appointment as a justice of common pleas on 23 April 1342 did not take effect, on 20 May 1345 he received a similar appointment and was knighted, the usual fee being supplemented by a grant of &pound;40 per annum. Later that year, on 10 November, he was made chief baron of the exchequer, but this appointment, too, did not take effect, and he remained a puisne justice for the rest of his life. In October 1348 he was one of the justices appointed for an abortive eyre in Kent. He acted regularly as a justice of assize and gaol delivery, and as a commissioner of the peace, in counties that included Oxfordshire; it was presumably in consequence of some professional contact that by 1354 Stouford had become a benefactor of Queen's College, Oxford. He continued to receive numerous commissions, including several to investigate alleged infringements of the rights of the king and Edward, the Black Prince, in Cornwall, along with regular summonses to parliaments and council meetings until December 1357. On 28 February 1359 he was appointed to a commission in Dorset, but he was dead by 8 August following.<br>
<br>There is no evidence that Stouford married, and no blood relations are known, though it may be surmised that he was kin to the Fitzwarins of Brightley, to whom in 1344 he granted the reversion of his lands and manors in Devon, and two of whom in succession he presented to Wootton church in Somerset (he had acquired the advowson in 1343, allegedly through a false deed forged by the prior of Stogursey). As a justice he showed some independence of mind; in 1353, for instance, it was reported that he had earlier stood out against his colleagues who declared that the thief who attacked a man with felonious intent was guilty of robbery, even if he took nothing. He also appears to have been a devout man. In 1336 he endowed a chantry in West Down church, and between 1337 and 1354 he made a number of benefactions to St John's Hospital in Wells, while on 30 November 1354 he was licensed to found either a small college or a large chantry at Stokeinteignhead, Devon, where a warden and chaplains would celebrate masses for the king, queen, and Black Prince, and also for John Stouford, in addition to distributing alms. All Stouford's estates appear to have been in Devon and Somerset. He was not a tenant-in-chief, and does not seem to have become particularly wealthy. He was buried in Stowford church, where a wooden effigy (repainted in 1873) represents him in the robes of a serjeant-at-law.<br>
