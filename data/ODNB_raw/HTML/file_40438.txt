<span class="headword">Wyke,  Andrew</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1645&#150;1663), <span class="occ">Baptist minister and Ranter</span>, is a man of whom nothing as yet is known of his early life. His name, derived from the Old English word for dwelling or village, was spelled variously as Wyke, Wykes, Wix, and Weeks. It is found as a surname in Kent, Sussex, and Essex. It is possible that Andrew Wyke came from the Ipswich area&#151;in 1646 he claimed to have friends living nearby. By his own account Wyke served parliament in the civil war, though in what capacity is not known. Perhaps he was a soldier; he was later to claim that he was owed over &pound;40 in arrears of pay. At some point Wyke became associated with the soap-boiler and Baptist Thomas Lambe (<i>d</i>. 1673). Together with Lambe, Wyke was apprehended at an unlawful assembly, and on 1 May 1645 committed by order of the committee for plundered ministers into the custody of the city marshal of London. Lambe and Wyke were imprisoned briefly for &#145;anabaptisme&#146; and then released, the prosecution failing to convict them on the newly enacted charge of lay preaching  (BL, Add. MS 15669, fols. 63<i>r</i>, 68<i>v</i>, 73<i>r</i>, 74<i>v</i>). Later, Wyke was to claim that he had been ordained &#145;by a Reformed Church&#146; in London, most probably Lambe's Baptist congregation meeting in Bell Alley, Coleman Street  (A. Wyke?, <span class="italic">The Innocent in Prison Complayning</span>, 1646, 4). It is also likely that Wyke was rebaptized by Lambe, perhaps in 1644, before being ordained by his church in the early months of 1645.<br>
<br>By the autumn of 1645 Wyke had gone forth from the church to spread the gospel message. He went to live in Debach, Suffolk, and was to spend nearly nine months preaching and rebaptizing in the surrounding area. His activities came to the attention of the heresiographer Thomas Edwards, who described Wyke as &#145;a Mechanick&#146; turned &#145;great Preacher and Dipper&#146;  (Edwards, 3.169&#150;70). On 3 June 1646, like Lawrence Clarkson before him, Andrew Wyke was imprisoned for preaching and rebaptizing by order of the committee of Suffolk at Bury St Edmunds. Upon his release Wyke continued his Baptist evangelizing, this time in Rutland and the adjacent counties. He was joined in this endeavour by Thomas Lambe and another of Lambe's converts, the Norwich weaver Samuel Oates (1614&#150;1683). In December 1647 several ministers from Rutland and close by, despairing of the &#145;erronious &amp; seducing spirits lately crept in amongst us&#146;, petitioned the House of Lords to apprehend Oates  (Betteridge, 206). Wyke may have left the Rutland area shortly after. By 25 December 1649 he was in Essex, living in the parish of St Nicholas, Colchester.<br>
<br>In March 1650 Andrew Wyke, in the company of a kinswoman of his, one Mistress Wallis, made a 120 mile journey from Colchester to Coventry. He arrived in Coventry on Wednesday 6 March 1650, and was said to have lain three nights in Wallis's &#145;Chamber&#146;  (<span class="italic">A Perfect Diurnall</span>, 11&#150;18 March 1650, 128). The purpose of Wyke's visit to Coventry was to visit Abiezer Coppe (1619&#150;1672), a Baptist preacher imprisoned for blasphemy, who in January had been moved to the town gaol from Warwick. Perhaps Wyke brought with him money, collected by various Baptist churches, to pay for Coppe's prison debts. Wyke was soon joined in Coventry by a comrade of Coppe's, Joseph Salmon (<i>fl</i>. 1647&#150;1656), who on Sunday 10 March 1650 preached in the town for an hour to the &#145;admiration of all honest men&#146;. Soon after, Salmon and Wyke were believed to have said that &#145;the Scripture &hellip; was no more than a ballad&#146; to them. They were also accused of denying the Devil and of swearing oaths, though they claimed that &#145;it was God&#146; in them that swore. Wyke was also alleged to have called a soldier a friend of Hell and a child of the Devil, before proceeding to kiss him three times and say &#145;I breathe the spirit of God into thee&#146;. Described as confident men &#145;of acute wits&#146; and &#145;voluable tongues&#146; they were seized by Captain Robert Beake and committed to Coventry gaol for the misdemeanour of swearing and for defying an order prohibiting the visiting of Coppe (<span class="italic">Leyborne-Popham MSS</span>, 57; <span class="italic">A Perfect Diurnall</span>, 11&#150;18 March 1650, 128). They were bound over until the next session of the assizes while the mayor and justices of Coventry informed the council of state in London of proceedings. On 19 March 1650 Coppe was moved to Newgate prison on the instructions of the council of state. From Newgate he wrote to Salmon and Wyke, playing on the word Wick to call Wyke his &#145;fort and strongehold&#146;  (Smith, 117).<br>
<br>While imprisoned Salmon and Wyke began preaching every Sunday from the prison grate. Wyke's message was &#145;the Love of God in pardoning sin, finishing transgression &amp; bringing in everlasting Righteousnesse&#146;  (A. Wyke to the mayor and aldermen of Coventry, MS Clarke 18, fol. 25<i>v</i>). It was reported that many stood in the streets to hear them. By the beginning of April they were prevented from preaching. News of their imprisonment began to spread, and it was during their confinement that Salmon and Wyke were visited by George Fox. In his journal, Fox was to describe them as &#145;Ranters&#146; for they &#145;began to rant and vapour and blaspheme&#146;, saying that &#145;they were God&#146;, justifying their words upon the authority of the first epistle of <span class="roman">Peter</span> and other scriptural texts  (<span class="italic">Journal of George Fox</span>, 46&#150;7). Prison probably had a debilitating effect on Wyke. His health may have suffered in poor sanitary conditions and he may have lacked the funds necessary to secure food from his keeper, Mr Butler. To this end he wrote to the mayor and aldermen of Coventry, rebuking them for condemning &#145;the just&#146;  (<span class="italic">A Perfect Diurnall</span>, 18&#150;25 March 1650, 141). His entreaties rebuffed, Wyke wrote again, this time calling himself a prophet. Adopting the mantle of Isaiah, Wyke reproduced the words of the prophet, attempting to speak with his voice to admonish his captors.<br>
<br>On 5 July 1650 Andrew Wyke was released from Coventry gaol on bail. He was taken to London to be questioned by the council of state. Wyke's fate is unknown. Perhaps he was imprisoned for blasphemy, though it is equally possible that he offered to recant his opinions and give an undertaking of good behaviour for one year. In August 1651, little over a year later, Wyke was dispatched to Ireland as an army preacher. After a brief stay at St Michan's, Dublin, he was moved north in October to preach the gospel at Lisburn and Belfast. Wyke was described as a man of &#145;meek spirit&#146;, but evidently the old fire soon returned, for in November he was being spoken of as &#145;a rare minister&#146; and &#145;a most powerful preacher&#146; (R. Dunlop, <span class="italic">Ireland under the Commonwealth</span>, 2 vols., 1913, 1.60&#150;61; <span class="italic">CSP Ire.</span>, <i>1647&#150;60</i>, 383). The congregation at Lisburn swelled and Wyke came into favour. In addition to his annual salary of &pound;120, it was ordered that he should have a house at public expense together with sufficient pasture land to provide for his wife and family. Not all, though, were as well disposed to Wyke. Dorothy Rawdon, sister of Lord Conway, disliked him; the Presbyterian minister Patrick Adair referred to him as &#145;an Anabaptist&#146; and guessed at his lack of university training, describing him as &#145;void of human learning, never educated that way, but a tradesman, and imprudent&#146;  (Adair, 186). Wyke's preaching duties were extended in 1654 to cover Dromore, Lurgan, and Kilwarlin, but by March the following year he had become involved in a controversy with the Quaker Richard Cleaton.<br>
<br>George Rawdon came to despair of him, complaining of Wyke's inability to perform &#145;punctual duties besides preaching&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP Ire.</span>, <i>1647&#150;60</i>, 564). In May 1658 he withheld the Lisburn tithes from Wyke, took his land from him, and petitioned for the reallocation of the tithes towards the building of a free school at Lisburn. Wyke took his case before the lord chief baron. His cause, however, did not prevail. Forced to leave Lisburn, in October 1658 Wyke was appointed on an annual salary of &pound;100 to preach to the united parishes of Donaghcloney and Tullylish in co. Down. The following summer, Wyke's replacement at Lisburn, Philip Tandy, brought charges against Jeremy Taylor, seemingly a private chaplain to the Conway family. It has been suggested that Wyke, aggrieved by his treatment at the hands of the Rawdon and Conway families, may have encouraged Tandy to bring his action against Taylor. In September 1659 Andrew Wyke's duties were increased to include preaching the gospel to the congregation of largely English settlers at Magheralin. In 1663 the marquess of Ormond ordered the arrest of a number of nonconformist ministers. By the summer eleven, including Wyke, were incarcerated at Carrickfergus. In early August Ormond dispersed the most dangerous, Wyke among them, to prisons in Limerick, Cork, Youghal, and Waterford. Wyke was subsequently removed to England. As yet, nothing more is known of him.<br>
