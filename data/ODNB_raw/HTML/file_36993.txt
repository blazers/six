<span class="headword">Wollaston,  Alexander Frederick Richmond <span class="st"> [Sandy]</span></span>  (1875&#150;1930), <span class="occ">naturalist and explorer</span>, born on 22 May 1875 at Clifton, Bristol, was the second son of George Hyde Wollaston (1844&#150;1926), a schoolmaster at Clifton College. His mother, Sarah Constance, the daughter of Thomas Richmond and the granddaughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/23596/', "Thomas Richmond")</script>, both miniature painters, and the niece of the portrait painter George Richmond, was a very talented woman. His relations included the moral philosopher William Wollaston, the astronomer Francis Wollaston, the natural philosopher Francis John Hyde Wollaston, the physicist William Hyde Wollaston, and the entomologist Thomas Vernon Wollaston.<br>
<br>From a private school Wollaston entered Clifton College as a day boy. He cared little for school life and games, but enjoyed natural history. In 1893 he went to King's College, Cambridge, to which he remained devoted. He was one of the select few who attended the zoology lectures of Alfred Newton, whose <span class="italic">Life</span> he published in 1921. During a long vacation he began a career of travel by walking from Hammerfest, Norway, through Lappland to the Baltic. He took only a poll degree in 1896, but stayed at King's for another two years (he proceeded MA in 1906). He then decided to obtain a medical qualification to increase his chances of joining an expedition, and accordingly went to the London Hospital and Addenbrooke's, became MRCS and LRCP in 1903, and graduated BCh at Cambridge in 1913.<br>
<br>Finding life as a medical student in London very irksome, Wollaston took every opportunity to escape into the country and particularly to the mountains. He was elected to the Alpine Club in 1903 and served on its committee in 1922&#150;4. In 1901 and 1904 he visited the Sudan with N. C. Rothschild to collect birds and animals, and later travelled round the world, visiting New Zealand, the Malay states, and Japan.<br>
<br>In 1906 Wollaston took part, as doctor and collector of plants and insects, in the British Museum expedition, led by R. B. Woosnam, to the Ruwenzori Mountains in central Africa. He climbed what was then supposed to be the highest peak (15,286 feet), afterwards named Wollaston peak by the duke of Abruzzi, and returned home down the Congo; later he published an account of his travels and observations in <span class="italic">From Ruwenzori to the Congo</span> (1908), in which he showed his sympathy with the Africans but defended Belgium against allegations then being levelled against it of brutality and exploitation in the Congo.<br>
<br>In 1909 Wollaston joined the expedition to Dutch New Guinea organized by the British Ornithologists' Union under Walter Goodfellow. The expedition failed to reach the Nassau range, and there was much sickness; but Wollaston made a valuable collection of natural history specimens and an interesting study of the Tapiro tribe, discovered by the expedition and described in his <span class="italic">Pygmies and Papuans</span> (1912).<br>
<br>In 1912&#150;13 Wollaston returned to New Guinea, taking C. B. Kloss as his only European companion. Having worked up the Utakwa and Setakwa rivers he reached the glaciers of Mount Carstensz (15,706 feet) and attained a height of 14,866 feet. The expedition was very arduous, but Wollaston showed himself a successful organizer. The party avoided beri-beri and Wollaston's sympathetic demeanor ensured good relations with the inhabitants. He secured a valuable collection of ethnological and natural history specimens and described the journey in the journal of the Royal Geographical Society (March 1914). He was awarded the society's Gill memorial in 1914. He was planning a third expedition to New Guinea when the First World War broke out.<br>
<br>Wollaston volunteered as a surgeon in the Royal Navy. In 1915 he joined the east African expeditionary force, and served in it for two years; later he served in the Arctic. He was awarded the DSC for conspicuous devotion to duty in east Africa and was demobilized in October 1919.<br>
<br>In 1921 Wollaston was medical officer and naturalist to the first Mount Everest expedition, led by Lieutenant-Colonel C. K. Howard-Bury. He treated members of the expedition and Tibetans, collected specimens of animals and plants new to science, and took some fine photographs. Afterwards he wrote a paper in the <span class="italic">Geographical Journal</span> (July 1922) and two excellent chapters and an appendix in <span class="italic">Mount Everest, the Reconnaissance</span> (1921).<br>
<br>Wollaston married in 1923 Mary (1889&#150;1943), the daughter of Daniel Meinertzhagen, head of the banking house of Frederick Huth. Later that year he and his wife visited the unexplored Sierra Nevada of Santa Marta, in Colombia, a region very difficult of access. He described the venture in the Royal Geographical Society's journal (August 1925) and in 1925 received the society's patron's medal. In 1928 he was appointed honorary secretary.<br>
<br>Wollaston was elected to a six-year fellowship at King's College in 1920, despite his lack of scholarly qualifications. He remained a fellow until 1926, but in 1925 he settled at Uley, Gloucestershire. In 1928 he was re-elected fellow and appointed tutor to his college and went to live at Cambridge. Although reticent, he had a sense of humour, great insight, and a broad outlook, and was remarkably successful with undergraduates. After his death J. M. Keynes wrote of him that &#145;he could unlock hearts with a word and a look, and break down everyone's reserves, except his own&#146;, while Stanley Baldwin as chancellor of the university spoke of Cambridge &#145;mourning a prince among men&#146;. The affection with which he was regarded intensified the horror aroused when on 3 June 1930 he and an accompanying police officer were shot dead in his college rooms by a demented undergraduate, Douglas Newton Potts, who then committed suicide. Wollaston's ashes lie in the chapel of King's College. He left a widow, a son, <a href="#cosubject_100541">Nicholas [<i>see below</i>]</a>, and two daughters, Georgina and Jo.<br>
<br>Wollaston was undoubtedly a brave and skilful explorer, although it was the manner of his death rather than his achievements in life which coloured his immediate reception and which led, for example, to his featuring with such men as John Franklin, David Livingstone, and Robert Falcon Scott in a 1941 textbook on explorers. Seventy years after his death it is not his travels but his photographs which are the focus of renewed interest. Those of Everest, the Congo, and New Guinea from the early years of the twentieth century (in the Royal Geographical Society) are much admired.<br>
<br>Wollaston's son, <a name="cosubject_100541"></a><span class="headword">Nicholas William <span class="st"> [Nick]</span> Wollaston</span>  (1926&#150;2007), <span class="occ">novelist and travel writer</span>, was born on 23 June 1926 at Bencombe House, Uley, Gloucestershire. He was educated at Winchester College and (after service in the Royal Navy in the Mediterranean and the Pacific) at King's College, Cambridge. &#145;When I arrived&#146;, he later recalled,<blockquote>the head porter doffed his bowler and said he was proud to meet my father's son. How could I compete? I've always felt this inadequacy, not living up to my father's name and fame. I did no work. I played the flute, drank a lot of beer in the Eagle, and got a third. (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 7 April 2003)</blockquote>After a short period working at a leather tannery in Kenya owned by an uncle, then as a jackaroo on an Australian sheep station, he embarked on a career as a travel writer, starting with <span class="italic">Handles of Chance: a Journey from the Solomon Islands to Istanbul</span> (1956). On 11 August 1961 he married Deirdre Johnston (<i>b</i>. 1939/40), daughter of Patrick Murdoch Johnston, British ambassador to Cameroon then Nicaragua; they had three children, Sophy, Sam, and Josh. Wollaston's first book after his marriage, <span class="italic">Red Rumba: a Journey through the Caribbean and Central America</span> (1962), was particularly acclaimed, Graham Greene ranking it with Patrick Leigh Fermor's <span class="italic">The Traveller's Tree</span>. Besides other travel books he published a biography of August Courtauld, <span class="italic">The Man on the Ice Cap</span> (1980), seven novels, from <span class="italic">Jupiter Laughs</span> (1967) to <span class="italic">Caf&eacute; de Paris</span> (1988), each critically well received but none a bestseller, a semi-autobiographical account of a journey to La Mancha, <span class="italic">Tilting at Don Quixote</span> (1990), and <span class="italic">My Father, Sandy</span> (2003), in which he finally explored his relationship with the father he hardly knew. Much of his later writing remained unpublished, and in 2000 he was incensed by a publisher's report that suggested it was too &#145;late in the author's career&#146;: &#145;At a pinch, I'd change my name and borrow a photo of the barmaid in my local pub &hellip; if it would do the trick&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Observer</span>, 6 Aug 2000). For the last thirty years of his life he and Deirdre were tenants of a National Trust house, Thorington Hall, Stoke by Nayland, Suffolk, where she ran a bed and breakfast business. He died on 23 April 2007 at Colchester General Hospital, of bronchopneumonia and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and was survived by Deirdre and their three children.<br>
