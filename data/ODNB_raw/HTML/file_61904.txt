<span class="headword">Priest,  Josias</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1734/5), <span class="occ">dancer and boarding-school proprietor</span>, was almost certainly a performer on the London stage from at least 1667, when Mr Priest danced a &#145;Tony&#146;, or fool, in act <span class="smallcap">V</span> of Dryden's comedy <span class="italic">Sir Martin Mar-All</span> and the end of the play was &#145;Crown'd with an Excellent Entry &hellip; by Mr. <i>Priest</i> and Madam <i>Davies</i>&#146;  (Downes, 62&#150;3). John Downes, the theatre prompter, named &#145;Mr. Joseph Preist&#146; as choreographer, with Luke Channell, for the spectacular 1673 production of <span class="italic">Macbeth</span>. When writing of the great dramatic operas of the early 1690s he credited &#145;Mr. Jo. Priest&#146; with the dances for <span class="italic">King Arthur</span>, and then &#145;Mr. Priest&#146; with those for <span class="italic">Dioclesian</span> and <span class="italic">The Fairy Queen</span>, seeing the dances as second in importance only to Henry Purcell's music. Thomas Bray's <span class="italic">Country Dances</span> (1699) includes a tune from act <span class="smallcap">II</span> of <span class="italic">The Fairy Queen</span>, headed &#145;An Entry by the late Mr. <i>Henry Purcell</i>, the Dance compos'd by Mr. <i>Josias Preist</i>&#146;, as well as dances from Purcell's last dramatic opera, <span class="italic">The Indian Queen</span> (1695), and the operatic version of Fletcher's <span class="italic">The Island Princess</span> (1699), created by &#145;Mr. <i>Preist</i>&#146;. <span class="italic">The Second Book of Theatre Musick</span> (1699) tells us that &#145;Mr Prist&#146; was the performer of the first of Bray's <span class="italic">Island Princess</span> dances, and it seems likely that he also performed the second, the dance for the Old Miser in the final masque. It was Priest's skill in &#145;Grotesque Dancing&#146; that John Weaver remembered in 1712: &#145;Mr. <i>Joseph Priest</i> of <i>Chelsey</i>, I take to have been the greatest Master of this kind of <i>Dancing</i>, that has appear'd on our Stage&#146;  (Weaver, 166&#150;7). In 1711 &#145;Mr. Preist Sen., of Chelsea&#146; subscribed to Edmund Pemberton's collection of notated dances and contributed his minuet for twelve ladies. Josias's son Thomas (<i>b</i>. 1671), who also lived in Chelsea, wrote four dance tunes for Bray's <span class="italic">Country Dances</span>.<br>
<br>In June 1669 a warrant had been issued to arrest Josiah Priest and others for teaching and performing music without a licence, and in 1675 Joseph Priest was paid &pound;100 for work on dances for the court masque <span class="italic">Calisto</span>. It is likely, though not certain, that Josias, Josiah, and Joseph Priest were all the same person. The registers of St Mary-le-Bow record the baptism of Frances, daughter of Josiah Preist, in 1665 and the burial of Frances, daughter of Joseph Priest, a year later. The dancing-master husband of Frances (or Frank) Preist (<i>d</i>. 1733) was variously called Josias and Josiah in the baptismal registers of St Andrew's, Holborn, between 1668 and 1675. The organist of Bath Abbey was referred to as Joseph Priest and Josias Priest in two subscription lists in 1724 but his relationship to the dancer is unknown.<br>
<br>On 25 November 1680 the <span class="italic">London Gazette</span> announced: &#145;<i>Josias Priest</i>, Dancing Master, who kept a Boarding-School of Gentlewomen in <i>Leicester-fields</i>, is removed to the great School-House at <i>Chelsey</i>, that was Mr. <i>Portman</i>'s&#146;. This was Gorges House, where the violinist Jeffrey Bannister and the singer James Hart had been running a girls' school. <span class="italic">The Antiquities of Middlesex</span> (1705) described the &#145;large spacious House &hellip; in which for many Years past has been kept a famous Boarding School for young Ladies, by Mr. <i>Jonas Priest</i>&#146;  (Bowack, 13). Priest appears to have had twelve children before he moved to Chelsea, and seven more were baptized there between 1682 and 1693, where he is named as Joseph Priest in the registers. Early in May 1684 &#145;Mrs Priest the Schoolmistress &hellip; had a little girl (one of her daughters) drowned in a Tub of Water&#146;  (Thorp, 202&#150;4), presumably Susanna, who was buried on 12 May, aged two.<br>
<br>Priest is best known for having staged John Blow's <span class="italic">Venus and Adonis</span> in 1684 and Purcell's <span class="italic">Dido and Aeneas</span> in 1689, at his boarding-school in Chelsea. Both operas were performed by Priest's pupils, but the role of Adonis in Blow's opera was taken by &#145;Mr. Priest's daughter&#146;  (Luckett, 76), probably Katherine, baptized at St Mary-le-Bow in 1666. In May 1691 Mrs A. Buck, who was investigating girls' schools for a friend, expressed her disapproval: &#145;Preists att Little Chelsey was one which was much commended; but he hath lately had an Opera, which I'me sure hath done him a great injurey; &amp; the Parents of the Childern not satisfied with so Publick a show&#146;  (Goldie, 392). By contrast when John Verney's niece Mary became a pupil at &#145;Mrs. Priest's&#146;  (Verney, 220) in 1683, aged eight, the family was pleased with the progress that she made there. She appeared in balls at the school and in <span class="italic">Venus and Adonis</span> (of which her affectionate uncle preserved the libretto), and, as an extra, learned to japan boxes. When Priest staged <span class="italic">Dido and Aeneas</span> his friend the playwright Thomas Durfey supplied the epilogue, which was &#145;Spoken by the Lady Dorothy Burk&#146;  (Durfey, <span class="italic">New Poems</span>, 81). Durfey's successful comedy <span class="italic">Love for Money, or, The Boarding School</span>, performed in January 1691, was set in a Chelsea girls' school, with a sub-plot involving two hoydenish pupils who elope with the dancing-master and the singing-master. Some members of the audience hissed, &#145;especially the Dancing-Masters, and other Friends to the Boarding-Schools, who supposed themselves, and their Livelihood expos'd&#146;  (Gildon, 51). In his preface to the play Durfey denied that he had portrayed any particular school and was particularly indignant at rumours that he had accepted the Priests' hospitality the previous summer and then &#145;writ this Play ungratefully to expose 'em&#146;  (Durfey, <span class="italic">Love for Money</span>, preface).<br>
<br>Rate books show that the Priests' school had closed by January 1712, and Chelsea parish registers record the burials, at St Luke's, of Mrs Frank Priest on 20 April 1733 and of Mr Josias Priest on 3 January 1735.<br>
