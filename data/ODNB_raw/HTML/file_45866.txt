<span class="headword">Weeton <span class="st"> [<em>married name </em>Stock]</span>,  Nelly <span class="st"> [Ellen]</span></span>  (1776&#150;1849), <span class="occ">letter writer and governess</span>, was born on 25 December 1776 in Lancaster, possibly in Church Street, the second of the four children of Thomas Weeton (1744&#150;1782), privateersman and slave-ship captain, and Mary (1746?&#150;1797), daughter of Richard Rawlinson, a Preston butcher. She was baptized on 29 January 1777 at St John's, Lancaster, and was named Nelly after her father's ship. Her editors have called her Ellen, but Nelly was her name at baptism and death.<br>
<br>Weeton's writings consisted mainly of nine letter-books into which from 1804 she meticulously copied the long letters which she sent to friends and relatives. One of these letter-books contains a short memoir, &#145;The retrospect&#146;, which gives information about her early life. A separate manuscript volume includes &#145;Occasional reflexions&#146;, written in 1818, and &#145;The history of the life of N. Stock&#146;, composed in 1824. Only the second, third, and seventh letter-books (the seventh ending in 1825) are extant. The letter-books remained unpublished during Weeton's lifetime and came to light only accidentally in 1925, when their first editor, Edward Hall, discovered one of them in a Wigan bookshop. <span class="italic">Miss Weeton: a Journal of a Governess</span> was published in two volumes in 1936, the first covering the years 1807 to 1811, and the second 1822 to 1825. A reprint, <span class="italic">Miss Weeton's Journal of a Governess</span>, in two volumes with an introduction by J. J. Bagley, was published in 1969.<br>
<br>In 1784, after losing her father aboard ship during the American War of Independence, Weeton, her mother, and her only surviving sibling, a younger brother, Thomas (Tom), moved from Lancaster to the small village of Upholland, near Wigan. Weeton's childhood was spent in adoration of Tom, whose educational needs were always taken more seriously than her own: &#145;I revered and loved my mother, but I loved my brother a great deal better&#146;  (<span class="italic">Miss Weeton's Journal</span>, ed. Bagley, 1.19). Weeton gained a modicum of education mainly from her mother, who opened a local school in 1788. From an early age she felt the disadvantages of her inadequate schooling very keenly: &#145;From the peculiarly recluse manner in which I had been educated, I was averse to society&#146;  (ibid., 1.20). Weeton assisted in her mother's school and, after her mother's death in 1797, ran the establishment alone in an effort to pay off her mother's debts and to support her brother through his legal education in Preston.<br>
<br>Tom Weeton's marriage in 1803 and his unfeeling financial manipulation of his sister obliged Weeton to find other ways of supporting herself. In later years her idealization of Tom was poignantly tempered by a hatred of the many injustices he had perpetrated against her: &#145;What have I done to you, hard-hearted selfish brother, to merit such strange cruelty of conduct?&#146;  (<span class="italic">Miss Weeton's Journal</span>, ed. Bagley, 2.87). As a result of her precarious pecuniary situation, Weeton spent the years 1808&#150;9 lodging in Liverpool. In 1809 she was obliged to take up work as a governess to the Pedder family at Ambleside in the Lake District. Here she witnessed with horror the death of ten-year-old Mary Pedder, who fell into the fire. Between 1811 and 1814 Weeton was governess to the Armitage family at High Royd, Honley, near Huddersfield, where she had the task of bringing to order children whom she found &#145;as unruly, noisy, insolent, quarrelsome a set, as I ever met&#146;  (ibid., 2.59).<br>
<br>In September 1814, at her brother's instigation, Weeton returned to Wigan to marry a local widower and cotton manufacturer, Aaron Stock (<i>b</i>. 1776). The marriage was an unmitigated failure: Weeton suffered the excesses of domestic abuse, &#145;extreme want and houseless at one time; imprisonments and bruises at another; my life daily in danger&#146;  (<span class="italic">Miss Weeton's Journal</span>, ed. Bagley, 2.140). She was herself charged with assault and threatened with detention in a lunatic asylum. Her only daughter, Mary (<i>b</i>. 1815), was removed from her care and sent to a local boarding-school. Weeton and Stock were separated by deed of separation in 1822, Weeton being thereby banned from the vicinity of Wigan.<br>
<br>Weeton returned to Upholland and was later reunited with her daughter. Described by Hall as a &#145;freethinker&#146;  (<span class="italic">Miss Weeton's Journal</span>, ed. Bagley, l.xxix), she attended both established and nonconformist churches regularly. She became a member of Hope Independent Chapel, Wigan, in 1827. Her Wigan home in Standisgate, inherited from her father, was sold in 1844. She later moved to Bedford Street, Liverpool, where she died of typhoid fever on 12 June 1849. She was buried in the Liverpool necropolis on 14 June 1849. She bequeathed her letter-books to William Marshall, minister of Hope Independent Chapel, but her principal legatees were her daughter Mary Newell and her grandchildren.<br>
<br>Lanky, sickly, and beset by acne, Weeton was, by her own admission, physically unprepossessing: &#145;I never was a beauty and sure enough I grow uglier every day&#146;  (<span class="italic">Miss Weeton's Journal</span>, ed. Bagley, 1.226). But the letters reveal a woman of impressive mental accomplishments whose many sufferings seem only to lend a clarity to her quick humour, quiet dignity, and powers of observation. She could, however, be caustic, arrogant, and ferociously self-centred: &#145;Any ridicule I may thoughtlessly scatter, is not meant to wound, but only to amuse&#151;perhaps tinged with a latent desire to excite a little admiration at my talents&#146;  (ibid., 1.306).<br>
<br>The letters and journal entries have enormous interest as social history, providing vivid first-hand accounts of the life of the governess and of the developing industrial landscape of north-west England, with its packet steamers and emergent railways. Weeton travelled alone to places as far afield as Yorkshire, London, the Lake District, and the Isle of Man, an itinerary that makes her a fascinating resource for information on the practice of contemporary travel. Since the mid-1980s Weeton's musings on the legal, educational, literary, and professional difficulties faced by women in the early nineteenth century have also attracted the attention of feminist historians.<br>
