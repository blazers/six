<span class="headword">Price,  Thomas</span>  (1599&#150;1685), <span class="occ">Church of Ireland archbishop of Cashel</span>, was probably born in Wales, although his parents are not known. He was educated in Trinity College, Dublin, graduating BA in 1623 and MA in 1628. He was elected fellow in 1626. Price was ordained deacon in December 1629. After examining him very thoroughly William Bedell, bishop of Kilmore, ordained him priest in 1632, and Price became Bedell's archdeacon. He married, before November 1633, Jane, daughter of Thomas Browne (<i>d</i>. 1613), mercer, of London, and Anne, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Garraway (<i>d</i>. in or after 1642), and stepdaughter of Sir Thomas Dutton, a prominent figure in the English plantation of co. Longford. Sir Thomas Browne (1605&#150;1682), physician and author, was his wife's brother. In 1634 Price was described as resident at Drumlaham, co. Cavan, in a document relating to his wife's inheritance. Price supported William Bedell in 1638 against the disapproval of his archbishop, James Ussher, for convening a diocesan synod. In the rebellion of 1641 the insurgents in co. Cavan imprisoned many civilians, and it was Price who drew up the terms for their release in 1642.<br>
<br>During the interregnum Price became chaplain to the duke of Ormond. After the Restoration he was advanced to the vacant see of Kildare, holding the prebend of Kildare <i>in commendam</i>. James Margetson, archbishop of Dublin, consecrated Price in Christ Church in March 1661. His income was to be &pound;400 per annum. At Ormond's recommendation Price was translated to the archbishopric of Cashel and the bishopric of Emly on 20 May 1667, the sees being vacant after the death of Archbishop Thomas Fulwar. When Price vacated Kildare, the diocese owed the king &pound;217, while the preceptory of Tully owed &pound;40. These debts, the result either of Price's parsimony or of his indolence, meant that the manors and estates of the see were forfeit to the crown.<br>
<br>Having been well trained by Bedell, Price as archbishop of Cashel understood the importance of using Irish in preaching the gospel. He ordained one Terence Tierney (or Tiernan) in King Cormac's Chapel on June 1677 to minister to the people in Irish. At a synod held the previous year Price and his clergy agreed that Tierney should preach in Irish in Cashel Cathedral every Sunday afternoon.<br>
<br>The Jesuit Andrew Sall (born in Cashel in 1612) was already friendly with Price by the early 1670s. In 1674, when regular Catholic clergy were proscribed in Ireland, Sall converted to the established church. Price received him into the Church of Ireland, put him up in his house, and acquired benefices for him. Encouraged by Price, Sall was involved in publishing the second edition of William Daniel's translation of the <span class="roman">New Testament</span> into Irish (1681). Sall went to England in 1675 to meet Sir Robert Boyle, who was financing the enterprise. Sall returned to Ireland in 1681 and began with others to prepare Bedell's Irish <span class="roman">Old Testament</span> for the press.<br>
<br>Another Catholic convert employed by Price to minister in Irish was Paul Higgins (P&oacute;l &Oacute; hUiginn), who was born about 1628. He had been Catholic vicar-general of Connaught and was brought over to the Church of Ireland by Dr Otway, bishop of Killala. Higgins, at the instigation of Narcissus Marsh, was employed in Trinity College to teach Irish, and while in the college transcribed some of Bedell's <span class="roman">Old Testament</span> for the printer. When Sall died in April 1682, Price conferred his benefices on Higgins, who left Trinity College shortly thereafter. Higgins's income from his various livings in the diocese of Cashel amounted to about &pound;200 per annum.<br>
<br>Public services in Irish as well as English were apparently customary while Price was archbishop. At synods held in Cashel in 1678 and again in 1682 it was ordered that the practice of saying &#145;Irish prayers&#146; in the cathedral should be continued. William Daniel's translation of the <span class="roman">Book of Common Prayer</span> was the service book used, a copy having been given to Price by Andrew Sall. Price himself had some knowledge of Irish.<br>
<br>Price almost certainly outlived his wife; they appear to have had no children. He died in his archiepiscopal house on 4 August 1685 at the age of eighty-five, and was buried in St John's churchyard in Cashel, where his tombstone still remains.<br>
