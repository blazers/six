<span class="headword">Schneider,  Henry William</span>  (1817&#150;1887), <span class="occ">industrialist and politician</span>, was born on 12 May 1817 at Beaver Hall, Southgate, Middlesex, son of John Henry Powell Schneider (<i>bap</i>. 1768, <i>d</i>. 1861) and his second wife, Elizabeth Moule. The family had moved from Switzerland in the eighteenth century. Schneider's father was second-generation head of John Schneider &amp; Co., merchants, London.<br>
<br>After 1824 the Schneider firm was primarily associated with mineral exploration in several countries. Aged eighteen, Schneider was made secretary of an associated organization, the Mexican and South American Company. In 1839 he travelled to the English Lake District and the Furness area, suspecting unexploited deposits of hematite iron ore. While remaining prominent in his family firm, this expedition anticipated his ensuing career.<br>
<br>In 1840 Schneider leased from the earl of Burlington the royalty of Park Farm, Dalton in Furness, Lancashire. He purchased nearby Whitriggs mine in 1842, subsequently leasing Mouzell mine in 1845 to form Schneider, Davis &amp; Co. These operations achieved modest success. A major breakthrough followed in 1850, when renewed speculation at the previously unprofitable Park estate uncovered huge reserves of ore. The subsequent Burlington pit supplied substantial markets in south Wales and the Staffordshire ironworks.<br>
<br>Schneider's original partner, James Davis, withdrew before the discovery was fully recognized. Schneider had also succeeded his father as chairman of the Anglo-Mexican Mining Company, with further mineralogical interests in Exmoor, south Wales, Australian copper, and Cornish tin. In 1853, needing extra capital for Burlington pit, he joined Kirkcudbrightshire landowner Robert Hannay, establishing Schneider, Hannay &amp; Co.<br>
<br>Schneider was still resident in London, travelling on business whenever required. Eloquent in advocating free trade and commerce, he also developed political aspirations, being elected in March 1857 as a Liberal MP for Norwich. Although he played no prominent part in the Commons, he was re-elected in 1859. But charges of electoral malpractice led to his being unseated the following year.<br>
<br>Following improvements to local railways, success at the Park mine, and increasing dominance within the Furness iron industry, Schneider eventually moved north. During 1859 Schneider, Hannay &amp; Co. began building blast furnaces at Hindpool, within the expanding town of Barrow in Furness. Competition from a new steel works (established in 1863 by a partnership involving the duke of Devonshire, the duke of Buccleuch, and Furness Railway manager, James Ramsden) led to the amalgamation of the two companies in 1866. The Barrow Iron and Steel Company mainly manufactured railway lines. Schneider continued as a director until his death.<br>
<br>Schneider married first on 14 September 1842, Augusta Smith (<i>bap</i>. 1821), daughter of Richard Smith of Urswick. They had three sons, and she died in 1862. His second marriage, on 1 October 1864, to Elizabeth Turner (1830/31&#150;1881), daughter of Canon Joseph Turner of Lancaster, doubtless aided his renewed attempts to enter parliament. At a by-election in February 1865 he was returned unopposed for Lancaster, and was re-elected the following July at the general election. Once again, the opposition raised allegations of bribery. A royal commission of inquiry, appointed in 1866, delivered a critical report&#151;and for the second time Schneider was ejected from the house, with Matthew Fenwick, his fellow candidate, being likewise removed. The borough of Lancaster was disenfranchised the following year.<br>
<br>Schneider returned to Barrow, immersing himself in local affairs. The town achieved borough status in 1867, with James Ramsden the first mayor. Schneider became an alderman, serving the remainder of his life. He supported the development of the dock system, the Barrow Shipbuilding Company, the Flax and Jute Company, and other smaller industries. He participated on local school boards, contributing lavishly towards the development of local schools, churches, hospitals, and clubs. He was mayor of Barrow from 1875 to 1878, besides being chairman of the borough finance committee, a leading freemason, and a supporter of the local volunteer force. He owned several residences, purchasing Belsfield, an Italianate mansion at Bowness-on-Windermere, in 1869. He was a justice of the peace in both Lancashire and Westmorland.<br>
<br>Barrow became a parliamentary constituency in 1885, James Ramsden declining nomination. Schneider stood for the Conservatives but lost the election to David Duncan. In a curious reversal of previous events, Schneider himself alleged corruption and unseated Duncan on petition&#151;but then waived his claim on the seat. Shortly afterwards, his health broke down. He died at Belsfield on 11 November 1887, being buried in Bowness cemetery four days later. His wife Elizabeth, with whom he had four daughters, had died in 1881 while holidaying at Dresden.<br>
<br>Schneider's greatest success was as the driving force behind the Furness iron industry. But his political career, bedevilled by accusations of electoral corruption, never got off the ground, in spite of his ability as a speaker. His other talents were recognized in 1866 with election as an associate of the Institution of Civil Engineers. At the institution's subsequent meeting he skilfully defended the advantages of steel for railway lines, while in 1880 the <span class="italic">Proceedings</span> of the Institute of Mechanical Engineers recorded in detail his comments on Furness iron.<br>
<br>Schneider was a constant churchman. Following his death, newspapers mentioned his munificent support for local causes&#151;which he had seldom attempted to conceal. Contemporaries often thought him autocratic&#151;but the author Robert Casson also mentions praise for &#145;the most generous and liberal despot in Lancashire&#146;. He never openly expressed remorse about his political troubles&#151;although these significantly increased pressure for electoral reform. Furthermore, despite intermittent difficulties, Schneider also considered himself a good employer. He recounted how the Park mine discovery occurred while certain workmen&#151;opposed to the imminent abandonment of exploration&#151;were offering one final week's labour without payment.<br>
<br>Schneider lived ostentatiously, regularly traversing Windermere on his yacht <i>Esperence</i> to catch his private train to Barrow. But his eventual fortune proved less than expected, and his memorial in Bowness cemetery is relatively simple. Nevertheless his services to Furness and his business acumen were well recognized&#151;particularly in 1891, when a life-sized statue, provided by public subscription, was unveiled in Barrow.<br>
