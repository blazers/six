<span class="headword">Mann, Sir  Horatio</span>, first baronet  (<em>bap. </em>1706, <em>d.</em> 1786), <span class="occ">diplomatist</span>, was baptized on 25 August 1706, the second son of Robert Mann (1678&#150;1751), a successful London merchant, and his wife, Eleanor (1680&#150;1752), the daughter and heir of Christopher Guise of Abbot's Court, Gloucestershire. He had an elder brother, Edward Louisa Mann (1702&#150;1775), a younger twin brother, Galfridus (1706&#150;1756), and two younger brothers, James (<i>d</i>. 1764) and Robert (1708&#150;1755). He also had four sisters, of whom the eldest, Eleanor (<i>d</i>. 1789), married Sir John Torriano; Mary married Benjamin Hatley Foote and Catherine (<i>d</i>. 1776) married Foote's brother the Revd Francis Hender Foote.<br>
<br>Mann studied at Eton College in 1718 and about 1720 moved briefly to Clare College, Cambridge. Ill health may have forced him to leave before he took a degree. Although he was never strong, later in life he took solace in hypochondria. His early years were spent in Chelsea, though little is known of his interests. His father purchased an estate in Linton, Kent, where he built a house about 1730 and established himself as &#145;a fully qualified country squire&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>). Seeking a climate which would better suit his health, Mann travelled to Italy, and took the extreme precaution of transporting a coffin with him. He is first recorded in March 1732 in Naples, where he stayed for at least a year. There he purchased marble tables, presumably for Linton, and other &#145;sundry things&#146;  (Ingamells, 42). He travelled north with Lady Grisell Baillie and was in Rome by April 1733, in Padua in June, and in Venice a month later. His companion may have taken him to Florence for the first time in April 1733.<br>
<br>In 1737 Mann visited The Hague, but by 3 February the following year he had become &#145;well known and esteemed by the ministers&#146; in his capacity as assistant to Charles Fane, the British resident in Florence  (TNA: PRO, SP 98/40, fol. 239). On Fane's return to England in April 1740 Mann took over his duties. He owed his rapid promotion to Sir Robert Walpole, to whom he was distantly related (their great-great-grandmothers had been sisters), and through his influence, and later the support of his son Horace, he steadily gained professional and social advancement. He remained the British representative in Florence until his death, and was appointed envoy on 13 December 1765 and envoy-extraordinary and minister-plenipotentiary on 29 January 1782. He was rewarded with a baronetcy on 3 March 1755 and was invested a knight in the Order of the Bath with much ceremony in 1768.<br>
<br>As Britain had no diplomatic representation in the Papal States, it was Mann's responsibility to report on the whereabouts of the Stuarts. Consequently his official duties were more onerous during the early part of his career. There was a certain amount of rivalry with other British informants, who included Baron Stosch, alias John Walton, Cardinal Alessandro Albani, and Burrington Goldsworthy, the consul at Leghorn. During the War of the Austrian Succession in the early 1740s Mann was asked to advise on the movement of the British fleet in the Mediterranean. Charles Edward Stuart escaped Italy to lead the Jacobite rising in Scotland in 1745, at which time Mann's dispatches became excitable and his concern for detail tiresome. A lack of proportion ultimately prevented him from becoming a diplomat of distinction. Geniality was his real gift and, as Edward Gibbon wrote, his &#145;most serious business was that of entertaining the English at his hospitable table&#146;  (E. Gibbon, <span class="italic">Memoirs of my Life</span>, ed. G. A. Bonnard, 1966, 134).<br>
<br>Mann kept open house for all British visitors, and they continually report his kindness. As one writer put it, &#145;his physiognomy speaks his goodness &amp; politeness which is sometimes carried to excess&#146;  (Ingamells, 635). He accommodated guests in Casa Ambrogi and, when there was no performance at the theatre on a Saturday night, he held <i>conversazione</i> at his residence, the Palazzo Manetti. According to Alexander Drummond:<blockquote>all the apartments on the ground-floor &hellip; were lighted up, and the garden was a little epitome of Vauxhall. These little conversazione resemble our card-assemblies; and this one was remarkably brilliant, for all the married ladies of fashion in Florence were there. (Drummond, 40&#150;41)</blockquote>Mann's kindness was universally acknowledged, perhaps most admiringly by John Boyle, fifth earl of Cork and Orrery, who wrote:<blockquote>he does honour to our nation. He lives elegantly and generously. He never fails in any point of civility and kindness to his countrymen. The politeness of his manners, and the prudence of his conduct, are shining examples both to the Britons and Italians. He is the only person I have ever known, whom all Englishmen agree in praising. He has the art of conquering our prejudices, and taming our fierceness. (J. Boyle, <span class="italic">Letters from Italy in the Years 1754 and 1755</span>, 1773, 107&#150;8)</blockquote>The importance of Mann for the historian is the letters&#151;almost 1800 of them&#151;to and from Sir Horace Walpole. Walpole met Mann when he first visited Florence in December 1739, and their friendship blossomed, even though, as Mann never left Florence, they never met again after April 1741. Perhaps Walpole's hold over Mann was sexual, and the correspondence was fed by Mann's toadying and Walpole's desire to have a sympathetic, and resilient, ear. The character of the British resident is best presented by William, second Earl Fitzwilliam, who wrote that:<blockquote>Sir Horace is the most finical man in the world: if you speak a little loud, he can't bear it, it hurts his nerves, he dies&#151;and he v&#150;m&#150;ts if you eat your petite patee before your soup; take him as he is, without the least notice, he is perfect character for the stage. He has been so long out of England, that he had lost the manliness of an Englishman, and has borrowed the effeminacy of Italy. But with all his little airs, he is a good kind of man, and is very civil. (Fitzwilliam MSS)</blockquote>His close friendships with the homosexual painter Thomas Patch and the effete John, second Earl Tylney, adds weight to this description. None the less, after his death in Florence, on 16 November 1786, the <i>conversazione</i> were missed. One visitor, George Baillie, wrote, &#145;Florence is a dull Town no Society for Eng: since the death of Sir H. Mann&#146;  (Ingamells, 636).<br>
<br>To supplement his considerable entertaining expenses Mann dealt to a limited extent in paintings and antiquities, but, unlike some of his contemporaries, he lacked a concerted interest in science or music. In his later years his post was coveted by George, third Earl Cowper, who, with privileged access to the grand duke, had a clear diplomatic advantage over Mann. However, higher authorities ignored Cowper's offer to replace Mann, and after his death the residency was filled by John Augustus Hervey.<br>
<br>Mann was buried on his estate at Linton, Kent, which he had inherited from his elder brother, Edward, in 1755. The baronetcy devolved on his nephew <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/64807/', "Horatio Mann (1744&#150;1814)")</script>, politician, the son of his twin brother, Galfridus, and the title became extinct at his death on 2 April 1814. The property passed to the Right Revd James Cornwallis, bishop of Lichfield and fourth Earl Cornwallis, who had married Mann's youngest niece, Catherine (1742&#150;1811), the daughter of Galfridus Mann and the sister of the younger Horatio Mann.<br>
