<span class="headword">Watson,  David</span>  (1859&#150;1943), <span class="occ">Church of Scotland minister and social reformer</span>, was born on 7 February 1859 in the village of Alva, near Stirling, one of seven children of David Watson (1820&#150;1870), boot- and shoemaker, and his wife, Jean, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Crawford (1824&#150;1886). Educated at Alva Academy, he left school at the age of twelve, following the death of his father after a short illness. He became an indentured apprentice in the provision trade, developing regular business habits which benefited him in later life. At the age of sixteen he felt called to the ministry. With the help of the parish minister, Andrew Kelly, who tutored him in Latin and Greek, Watson won a bursary to the University of Glasgow, matriculating at the age of eighteen in 1876. He completed the four-year arts course, studying moral philosophy under the celebrated Hegelian Edward Caird, later master of Balliol College, Oxford, and natural philosophy under the renowned physicist Sir William Thomson, later Lord Kelvin. Watson then entered the divinity hall at the University of Glasgow, finishing his course in March 1884. A few months later he was licensed to preach in the Church of Scotland by the presbytery of Stirling, and became assistant to the Revd A. Fyfe Burns of St George's parish in the manufacturing town of Paisley.<br>
<br>At Paisley, Watson grew deeply concerned with the problems of urban poverty. Andrew Mearns's <span class="italic">Bitter Cry of Outcast London</span> was published in 1883; like many others Watson was distressed by its revelations of acute social deprivation, especially the horrors of slum housing. He had also become personally acquainted with the English Congregationalist journalist W. T. Stead, whose sensational series of articles in 1885, &#145;The maiden tribute of modern Babylon&#146;, exposed widespread child prostitution in London. Watson's own pastoral visiting in Paisley brought him into close contact with the often appalling living conditions of the urban poor, and he wrote a series of vividly descriptive articles for the <span class="italic">Paisley Gazette</span> entitled &#145;How the Paisley poor live!&#146; which received considerable attention.<br>
<br>Watson's concern for the urban poor led him to accept, in November 1886, the call to a small Church of Scotland &#145;chapel-of-ease&#146; or mission chapel&#151;St Clement's&#151;in the east end of Glasgow. Within fifteen months he had managed to secure endowments and to increase the membership, ensuring that St Clement's was elevated from a chapel-of-ease to a parish church. Over the next several years St Clement's became a model urban working-class church, with an attractive, welcoming interior, a membership of over 1000, and a church hall that provided a meeting place for the surrounding community. As well as pastoral visiting, Watson commenced a series of regular week-night lectures for young people, which he continued for over twenty years. He organized a rambling club to enable working-class parishioners to enjoy Saturday afternoon walks in the surrounding countryside. He co-operated with the Glasgow Workmen's Dwellings Company in developing affordable and attractive housing. He established a club room in his church hall, with games and magazines, to provide young people with an alternative to the street.<br>
<br>By the 1890s Watson was also taking a leading role in charitable and social reform activities outside his parish. From the early 1890s he was active in the Charity Organization Society, serving as chairman of the Mile-End district, attending conferences across Britain, and embracing its ethos of promoting self-help and independence among the poor. He was also active on the Scottish Council for Women's Trades, and served for a time as chairman. In 1901, influenced by the Christian Social Union in England, Watson took the lead in forming the Scottish Christian Social Union, to promote the social mission of the Scottish Presbyterian churches. On Watson's urging, the new union made the improvement of child life its first major cause. He served as president of the union from 1901 to 1938. In 1910 he was appointed chaplain of Barlinnie prison in Glasgow, the largest prison in Scotland, a post he held until 1915 in conjunction with his parish charge. This experience convinced him of the lasting social damage caused by incarcerating youths for petty infractions.<br>
<br>From 1899 Watson became a major force in convincing the Church of Scotland to embrace social work and social reform in a more informed and systematic manner. He was not by nature an ecclesiastical politician and disliked the practical work of church governance through the church courts. He did, however, throw himself into the work of educating the church on social evils and problems. He served for many years on the committee on social problems of the presbytery of Glasgow. In 1907 he undertook for this committee a personal investigation, while dressed as a poor labourer, into conditions in the lodging houses of Glasgow. It was journalistic investigation in the manner of W. T. Stead, and Watson's report revealed a dark underworld of alcoholism, violent crime, and child prostitution. The report led the presbytery of Glasgow and later the Church of Scotland as a whole to set up missions to the lodging houses. He helped to organize a series of church congresses in Scotland between 1899 and 1904 to explore pressing social, moral, and intellectual questions. In 1904 he was active in the formation of the Church of Scotland's standing committee on social work. He served as vice-convenor of the committee from 1904 to 1927, and convener from 1927 to 1935&#151;promoting the establishment of improved lodging houses for men and women, farm colonies for training the urban unemployed, orphanages and hostels, retirement homes, soup kitchens, and homes for unmarried mothers. When the committee was criticized by some for simply providing ambulance work for the victims of social injustice, Watson responded that the church must address the immediacy of human suffering in an imperfect world. At the same time he also worked for social reforms aimed at reducing poverty. During the First World War he served on the church's commission on the war, and took a leading role in planning for post-war social reconstruction, insisting that out of the suffering of the war there should come a new, more just social order. He was commissioned by the church to edit, with Professor W. P. Paterson, a wide-ranging volume of essays under the title <span class="italic">Social Evils and Problems</span> (1918), intended to educate the church to take an active role in post-war social reconstruction. He assisted in the formation in 1919 of the church's standing church and nation committee, and served as convener of the sub-committee on social and industrial life from 1919 to 1930.<br>
<br>Watson was a prolific and fluent author, who produced a large number of books and pamphlets on the social aspects of Christianity. Among his major works were <span class="italic">Social Problems and the Church's Duty</span> (1908), <span class="italic">Social Advance: its Meaning, Method, and Goal</span> (1911), and <span class="italic">The Social Expression of Christianity</span> (1919). Watson's social writings reflected careful research into social questions, a command of statistics and practical detail, a willingness to draw upon his own experiences as an urban pastor, and a broad familiarity with history and literature. Although sympathetic to many of the ideals of socialism, he was not a socialist, believing that socialism was overly materialistic, that it placed too much emphasis on economic interpretations, and that it would stifle individual human potential. His own social and political philosophy was rooted in the Christian communal traditions he had experienced in his youth in rural Alva and in the ethical Liberalism of Gladstone and John Bright. After 1906 he embraced the social commitments of the new Liberalism, including support for increased state involvement in social welfare. He emphasized policies aimed at promoting individual responsibility and independence among the poor. Although disappointed by the limited achievements in social reconstruction following the First World War, he retained his strong belief in human progress. In theology he was an evangelical, who preached a gospel of personal salvation through divine grace. He believed strongly that the church must advance on two fronts, combining its work for the conversion of individuals with striving for a more just social order. &#145;Social reform and personal regeneration&#146;, he observed in 1935, &#145;were both needed&#151;a better social order and better men&#151;but we would attain neither unless we strove for both simultaneously&#146;  (Watson, 82&#150;3).<br>
<br>Watson married Janet Martin (1862&#150;1932), the daughter of John Martin, a merchant in Dunning, on 1 March 1887. It was a long and happy marriage. They had two sons and three daughters. The eldest son, David Crawford Watson, followed his father into the ministry of the Church of Scotland; the other son, John Martin Watson, died in 1919 of pneumonia, aged twenty, while preparing for the ministry. One of Watson's daughters, Florence Jean, became a missionary with her husband, Professor William Lillie, at Murray College in India. Watson was awarded the degree of doctor of divinity by the University of Glasgow in 1913. He demitted his ministerial charge of St Clement's on 31 December 1928. His wife died on 12 November 1932, and a few years later, in 1935, he resigned as convener of the social work committee. He died at his home, 8 Clayton Terrace, Glasgow, on 5 November 1943.<br>
