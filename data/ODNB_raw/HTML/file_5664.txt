</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Clifford,  Thomas</span>, first Baron Clifford of Chudleigh  (1630&#150;1673), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born at Ugbrooke Park, Devon, on 1 August 1630, and baptized at the nearby parish church of Chudleigh on 12 August. He was the second child and eldest son of Hugh Clifford, a relatively obscure minor gentleman who led a cadet branch of the great medieval house of Clifford and died on 12 February 1640 leaving an estate worth &pound;374. His mother was Mary, eldest daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5381/', "Sir George Chudleigh")</script> of Ashton, Devon.<h2>
<a name="Earlylife"></a>Early life</h2>Nothing more is known of Clifford until his matriculation at Exeter College, Oxford, on 21 May 1647, a place which he quitted after only a year; almost certainly because he was expelled for royalist and Anglican views in the purge of the university conducted in 1648. His devout Anglicanism&#151;together with his taste for classical poets and Ben Jonson&#151;is proved by the commonplace book which he began to keep at university, and his mother's family had become prominent royalists. He seems to have moved directly from Oxford to the Middle Temple, and may have travelled in Europe thereafter; if so, however, his experiences must have been negative, because he never learned another modern language and his attitude towards foreigners was almost consistently hostile.<br>
<br>Clifford married Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1709), eldest daughter of William Martyn of Lindridge, his immediate neighbour, on 27 June 1650. It was clearly a love match and the union was an outstanding success, productive of lasting close affection and seven sons and eight daughters. It also seems to have significantly augmented Thomas's wealth, for by 1659 his estate was worth &pound;1490.<h2>
<a name="RestorationMP"></a>Restoration MP</h2>During the whole of the 1650s Clifford seems to have lived at Ugbrooke in domestic bliss and political quarantine, being kept out of any employment by the regimes of the interregnum. It is wholly appropriate, therefore, that his first engagement with public life was in an action which helped to pull down the republic: his prominent role in a meeting of Devon gentry at Exeter in January 1660 which demanded the readmission of the secluded members to the Long Parliament. When that readmission brought about the dissolution of the parliament, he was elected to the convention which succeeded it for the nearby borough of Totnes, and reoccupied the same seat in the Cavalier Parliament of the next year. With the Restoration his pent-up energy and ambition was released. He became one of a clique of young gentlemen from Devon and Cornwall who formed around the comptroller of the household, Sir Hugh Pollard, and could be relied upon to defend the court interest, especially in the Commons. Rewards came swiftly, in an appointment as an extraordinary gentleman of the privy chamber on 21 December 1660 and in a lease of crown land in 1662. It was apparently through Pollard that he formed a friendship&#151;fast by late 1662&#151;with Sir Henry Bennett, subsequently Lord Arlington, who became a powerful and consistent patron to him.<br>
<br>Most of Clifford's early speeches in parliament have been lost, but it is possible to discern a pattern whereby he supported not merely royal policy but toleration for Catholics and protestant dissenters; the latter stance mirrored that of Arlington, but also seems to have reflected his own interest in the reconciliation of rival forms of Christianity. He also demonstrated a quick temper, most dramatically by coming to blows with Andrew Marvell in the House of Commons itself during a break between business.<h2>
<a name="TheSecondAngloDutchWar"></a>The Second Anglo-Dutch War</h2>Clifford's real rise to prominence in the house, and in national life, came about in the debates preceding the outbreak of the Second Anglo-Dutch War of 1665&#150;7. He emerged as one of the most passionate and persuasive of the speakers who, in the course of the year 1664, led the Commons into supporting an aggressive royal policy towards the Dutch and voting enormous supplies for operations against them. Appreciation for his services came in the form of a knighthood during the summer, and a further lease of crown land and a share in the farm of wine and liquor licences in Ireland during the early part of 1665. He also obtained further honour, employment, and profit from the administrative machinery set up to fight the war, being made one of the commission set up to care for sick and wounded sailors and prisoners of war on 27 October 1664, and a sub-commissioner for prizes on 4 January 1665. On 18 January he was appointed, in addition, to the commission which managed the estates of the king's son, the young duke of Monmouth. All this testifies to a belief in his financial acumen and capacity for industry, and he acquitted himself so well as a sub-commissioner that on 28 June the value of a whole prizeship was awarded to him in recognition of the money which he had made and saved the government.<br>
<br>This achievement is the more remarkable in that for most of the summer Clifford was on active service with the fleet, as a volunteer. He was present at the great battle off Lowestoft on 3 June 1665 and the less successful attack on the Dutch ships in the harbour at Bergen on 2 August, in which he played a prominent part as an agent in the complex negotiations with the Danish governor. The courage and energy which he displayed in these actions, and the clarity and impartiality of the reports which he sent back to Arlington, caused him to be appointed on 29 August as an ambassador-extraordinary to the crowns of Denmark and Sweden. The period from September until January was consumed in this mission to negotiate an alliance against the Dutch, which was rendered fruitless by wider European developments.<br>
<br>Upon his return to England, Clifford recommenced his duties as a commissioner and rejoined the fleet for the opening of the 1666 fighting season. He witnessed its two main clashes, the four-day battle of 1&#150;4 June and the St James's day fight of 25 July, and won the especial regard of Prince Rupert. The latter recommended him for a command on 1 July and chose him to carry the official report of the victory on the 25th to the king. During August and September he divided his time between patrolling with the navy and acting as a commissioner for sick and wounded ashore. Pepys noted him as &#145;much set by at court for his activity in going to sea, and stoutness everywhere, and stirring up and down&#146;  (Pepys, 17 Sept 1666).<br>
<br>This fine reputation, and the continued support of Arlington, earned Clifford a major office on 28 November 1666, when he succeeded to Pollard's post as comptroller of the household. On 5 December he was sworn of the privy council, and on 22 May 1667 he was placed on the newly established commission to manage the Treasury, a body of men chosen specifically for their skill in fiscal affairs. His particular ability in that regard was recognized again upon 14 June 1668, when he was promoted treasurer of the household. Clifford had thus become one of the leading figures of the court, and in the process became famed both for the munificence of his hospitality and for his patronage of writers. The greatest of these was Dryden, who repeatedly expressed gratitude to him and later gave him the dedication of his tragedy <span class="italic">Amboyna</span>; it seems very likely that it was Clifford who obtained Dryden the office of poet laureate in 1670. Clifford's own patron during this period remained Arlington, who was now the king's chief minister, and he continued to follow the latter's inclinations in parliament&#151;abstaining during the attack on Clarendon in 1667 and arguing for religious toleration in 1668. The only point at which his views departed from those of his benefactor was over the triple alliance of 1668 in which England joined with its recent enemies, the Dutch. Clifford's detestation of the latter, expressed to such effect in 1664, had become instinctual, and he could never bring himself to speak well of the partnership with them.<h2>
<a name="ThesecrettreatyofDover"></a>The secret treaty of Dover</h2>This being so, Clifford must have been mollified by a new employment to which he was put in 1669, as secretary in the clandestine negotiations with the French which were to culminate in the secret treaty of Dover in May 1670. Clifford's appointment to this post must have owed much to the fact that Arlington was the only minister involved in the negotiations. He was in some respects very badly equipped for it, having no knowledge of the French language and regarding France itself with a suspicion which he accorded to all foreign nations, and which was only too patent to the French ambassador, Colbert de Croissy. In others, however, he was ideal. He was totally devoted to the service of his royal master&#151;something indicated by the manner in which he had repeatedly defended the king's prerogative whenever it had become a matter for debate in the Commons. His dedication and discretion in a highly dangerous and secret negotiation could be deemed absolute; and the truth of this is proved by the manner in which the English copy of the secret treaty, and the working papers of the talks, remained hidden at his seat of Ugbrooke until the nineteenth century. Clifford also possessed technical abilities suited to the work, most of all his ability to draft documents swiftly and accurately. It must have counted for a great deal, moreover, that the two central aspects of the agreement with the French were both very congenial to his own views. One was an alliance against the Dutch, whose power was finally to be broken in a sudden joint attack. The other was an undertaking by Charles II that, if given French financial assistance, he would declare himself to be a Roman Catholic and so attempt to lead his subjects back to the Church of Rome.<br>
<br>This was a course upon which Clifford's own feet were now set&#151;probably by the time that the overture to France was made, and certainly by that of the completion of the treaty on 22 May 1670, when he acted as one of the signatories. His commonplace book, kept faithfully since his time as an undergraduate, shows a gradual, if undated, shift from an interest in Anglican devotional works to those more suited to a Catholic. To describe him as a convert at this stage, however, would be seriously misleading; he was, rather, an Anglican who wished to reconcile his church with that of Rome by a process of negotiation and compromise. The secret treaty had stipulated that Charles's declaration of Catholicism would precede the attack on the Dutch, and Clifford accordingly gave thought to the practical details of how it might be effected. He advised the king to repair key fortresses and place them and his guard regiments in safe hands, while preparing a promise of liberty of conscience to all of his subjects who did not feel able to follow his change of faith. At the same time he drafted instructions for an envoy to be sent to the pope to acquaint him with the venture and secure his co-operation; and he worked with a prominent English Benedictine, Hugh Cressy, to draw up possible terms for the reunion of the faiths, by which the pope would write off all land formerly confiscated from the church in England, agree to toleration of protestants, and accept compromise over the questions of the liturgy, communion, reordination, and clerical marriage. All these efforts were in vain, for Charles himself never showed any interest in them. It seems likely, indeed, that his profession of interest in conversion had been a diplomatic ploy to win the friendship of France and to get money from there, and it gradually became eclipsed by preparations for the war with the Dutch.<h2>
<a name="Thestopoftheexchequerandthedeclarationofindulgence"></a>The stop of the exchequer and the declaration of indulgence</h2>Clifford was certainly given ample recompense for these valuable and delicate services, and for those which he continued to give in his official duties in the household and Treasury. In 1669 he obtained a valuable lease of crown land in Buckinghamshire, which was given to his heirs in perpetuity in 1671. In the latter year, also, he was given an annual pension out of the estates of the dean and chapter of Exeter. By this time he had become one of the most important of royal councillors, sitting on the select committee for foreign affairs, which (despite its name) functioned as the principal body for the making of policy in all areas. Although his most obvious expertise was in financial matters, he contributed fully to all debates and played a key part in two celebrated initiatives upon the eve of the war. One was the stop of the exchequer on 2 January 1672, by which all payments to government creditors were suspended in order to release the full income of the state for military measures. There seems to be little doubt that the idea for it was Clifford's own, and its bold and ruthless nature has the full stamp of his character; it is equally obvious why, despite much argument, it was accepted by the rest of the privy council, for it provided such a simple and effective solution to the acute short-term problem of how to equip a fleet for a surprise attack. Clifford also supported the second dramatic measure, the declaration of indulgence on 15 March which licensed public worship for protestant dissenters and private worship for Catholics. It was so completely in harmony with the views that he had expressed consistently for ten years that his enthusiasm for it is hardly surprising; what is worth emphasizing is that this was shared by all the rest of the committee for foreign affairs, with the sole exception of Charles himself, who was persuaded into it only with difficulty.<br>
<br>On 22 April 1672 Clifford was elevated to the peerage with the title of Baron Clifford of Chudleigh as part of the general round of creations and promotions accorded to the king's chief minister and councillors to encourage them at the outset of the war. In May he made a last attempt to persuade Charles to form plans for his declaration of allegiance to Rome, and then turned his energies to the prosecution of the war, this time at the level of high financial administration and policy making. In June, when the Dutch seemed to be ready to sue for peace, he outstripped all other members of the foreign affairs committee in pressing for harsh terms, involving either the dismemberment of the Dutch state or the annexation of part of it by England. His colleagues agreed upon a much more moderate package, and it was Arlington, sent as one of the plenipotentiaries, who ensured that it was more moderate still. Despite this it was rejected, but the difference in attitudes to the Dutch between Clifford and his old benefactor, which had briefly opened over the matter of the triple alliance, had reappeared in much more glaring form. This may have been assisted by the growing friendship between Clifford and a still more powerful figure, the heir presumptive to the throne, James, duke of York. The latter had travelled in parallel with him in an increasing sympathy for the Church of Rome and support for a royal declaration of reconciliation to it. During the summer of 1672 the connection between the two men became obvious, as Clifford effectively looked after James's affairs while the royal duke commanded at sea.<h2>
<a name="Lordtreasurer"></a>Lord treasurer</h2>By autumn the switch of allegiance had become obvious, and was dramatically illustrated on 28 November when Charles formally dissolved the Treasury commission and vested ultimate control of state finances in Clifford, with the revived office of lord treasurer. James later claimed the credit for having persuaded his brother into the choice, and indeed it can be argued that of all Charles's leading servants he was the best qualified for the job. Arlington, however, saw things differently. He had been expecting to receive the post himself, only to see it awarded to somebody whom he had himself helped to power. His sense of betrayal, and of ingratitude upon the part of a former client, made a complete and lasting rupture in relations between the two men. At this cost, Clifford accepted the office and set about it with the systematic hard work which he had brought to all his previous duties. Each Saturday he personally drew up lists of all the moneys to be paid out by the Treasury, and his care is visible in every other department of its activities. A story often repeated by historians, that at his suggestion the fleet was kept at sea all winter because the government could not afford to pay it off after the summer campaign, is a political libel. In fact the sailors were paid in full during the autumn, and&#151;due in large part to French subsidies and a trade boom but also to sound management&#151;the government actually concluded the first year of war in financial surplus.<br>
<br>In the winter of 1672&#150;3 Clifford reached the apogee of his career. He was now both in office and influence one of the great ministers of state, and has traditionally been grouped with Arlington, Buckingham, Ashley, and Lauderdale in a government known (from the first initials of their titles) as the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/93697', "Cabal")</script>. The perception of their pre-eminent importance is correct, but at no time did they function as a group; the last three were all allied against Clifford and Arlington, while these were divided by their quarrel in November, and Clifford was closest to the duke of York, who was by definition not a minister or court official but clearly an important figure in policy discussions at this time. On the other hand, apart from the pleasing coincidence of the initials, there is one good reason for applying the nickname to the ministry: that Clifford himself used it, although in a different spelling and in the common contemporary sense of a small group of people engaged in secretive business. In a letter to Lauderdale in 1672 he referred to the leading royal advisers as &#145;the caball&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 23135, fol. 203).<br>
<br>Clifford was now adopting the lifestyle of a magnate as well as the responsibilities of a minister. He commenced the emparking and rebuilding of his ancestral home of Ugbrooke, purchased fine Dutch and Flemish paintings, commissioned portraits and landscape scenes from artists such as Lely and Dankers, and had tapestries of <span class="roman">New Testament</span> scenes made at the Pointz factory in Hatton Garden; several of these works survive at Ugbrooke. His whole position, however, was to be destroyed by a single financial circumstance: that the government had only half the money needed to send the navy out against the Dutch in the approaching summer of 1673. The remainder could be obtained only by a parliamentary grant, and the members of the Cabal, including Clifford, made strenuous efforts to canvass MPs with whom they had ties in preparation for the spring session. All were in vain; when that session opened in February, the Commons, deeply suspicious and resentful of the crown's policy towards religion, made the vital grant conditional upon the recall of the declaration of indulgence and the passage of a statute, which became known as the <span class="roman">Test Act</span>, to make the holding of public office conditional upon the taking of Anglican communion.<br>
<br>Clifford, accompanied by York, Ashley (now earl of Shaftesbury), and Lauderdale, urged the king vehemently to sacrifice the taxes, and the Dutch war, rather than agree to these demands. Arlington and lesser advisers, supported by the French, counselled the opposite course, and it seems likely that Charles's own natural inclinations, which had been against the declaration of indulgence, were upon their side. At any rate he withdrew the declaration on 8 March, an act which expedited the grant of supply but did nothing to slow the progress of the bill for a religious test. Charles himself seems to have regarded this without alarm, and even encouraged its progress to please the Commons&#151;apparently because he believed that it would actually have the effect of pushing his brother, and Clifford, back into the Anglican fold. Clifford himself, who must already have been facing the opposite likelihood, became the only minister to oppose the bill, delivering a speech of frantic denunciation when the measure reached the House of Lords in mid-March. With the king seeming to countenance the measure, and Shaftesbury overtly doing so with the prestige of the office of lord chancellor, these efforts were unavailing, and the bill passed into law at the end of the month.<h2>
<a name="Resignationanddeath"></a>Resignation and death</h2>The <span class="roman">Test Act</span> supplied Clifford with a succeeding interval of two months in which to reach a decision upon his response. To state that the act exposed him as a Roman Catholic would be false; rather, it forced him to make a formal conversion. Until this point his position had remained that of an Anglican who, in the words of his friend John Evelyn, jotted down in 1671, was &#145;a little warping to Rome&#146;  (Evelyn, 3.577, 17 May 1671). On 17 July of that year a chapel had been consecrated at Ugbrooke according to the rites of the Church of England, although dedicated to Cyprian, proponent of the unity of Christendom. The chapel at Clifford's London residence as lord treasurer was also Anglican, and on 8 April and 18 June 1673 he attended the successive weddings of his two eldest daughters there, conducted by a minister of the Church of England. He postponed the resignation of his offices for the longest possible duration permitted by the <span class="roman">Test Act</span>, until 19 June; and only after that did he commence, and adhere to, the open practice of Catholic worship. It seems very likely that his loyal and straightforward nature would have dictated his resolution once the reunion of the churches seemed to be indefinitely postponed and he had come to regard that of Rome as the essential one. It may also be argued, however, that his decision was influenced to some extent by that of his great friend and patron the duke of York, who took the same course and resigned his own posts on the preceding day.<br>
<br>It was now perfectly possible for Clifford to remain a prominent figure at the royal court, relieved of the burdens of office while enjoying the new financial and social position which they had bequeathed. He chose instead to retire completely from public life, and prepared for a resumption of that relaxed existence of provincial seclusion which he had known in the 1650s. Even this, however, was to be denied to him by destiny, for he died at Ugbrooke on 17 October, and was interred in the chapel there two days later. Some mystery and controversy hangs over the circumstances of his end. It is clear that his health had been declining for years under the strains of his public position and duties. By September 1671 he was already expressing fatigue, and envy for ministers who had retired honourably from office. In the summer of 1672 he was seriously ill and obliged to take the waters at Bath to assist a recovery. Writing to Sir Joseph Williamson at that time, he commented that &#145;I am ever in pain&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1672</i>, 414). Immediately after his resignation in the following year he was found taking another rest-cure at a spa, this time Tunbridge Wells. No doubt the terrible emotional pressures which preceded that event had taken their toll, but it is also beyond doubt that he was suffering from a real complaint, subsequently diagnosed as urinary stones. He made his will ten days before he died, suggesting the recognition of a mortal illness. On 13 October a correspondent in London confirmed that his doctors &#145;expect nothing but his death&#146; and that the cause was indeed an exceptionally severe attack of stones  (Christie, 2.40).<br>
<br>There would therefore be no question over the manner of Clifford's end, and a persistent if subdued rumour that he had committed suicide could be dismissed as religious rancour, were it not for the remarkably circumstantial account of his death by self-induced strangulation recorded by Evelyn. It must be noted, however, that Evelyn's source seems to have been at least secondhand, and that he himself thought the matter &#145;not confidently affirm'd&#146;  (Evelyn, 4.21, 18 Aug 1673). It seems likely, therefore, that the story was a libel.<h2>
<a name="Assessment"></a>Assessment</h2>Clifford's talents as an administrator and minister are undoubted. The lucidity of the reports which he made to Arlington and others during his service at sea and as a diplomat is as patent to the historian as it was to his recipients. The letters which he wrote as a financial officer are equally fluent and shrewd, and his acumen in monetary matters is as obvious as his industry and dedication in them. He enjoyed a reputation for probity in office even among his enemies; after his resignation an observer of metropolitan affairs could say that all thought him &#145;an exact honest man and uncorrupted&#146;  (Christie, 1.46). Pepys considered that he spoke &#145;very well and neatly&#146; in the House of Commons  (Pepys, 5.294, 11 Oct 1664).<br>
<br>Clifford's self-discipline in business was balanced, however, by an exceptionally quick temper and passionate nature, well expressed in the leonine features and stubborn mouth which are displayed in his portraits. Colbert de Croissy, who generally thought well of him, rued his &#145;excessive ardour&#146;  (Croissy to Louis, 17 April 1673, Correspondance politique, Angleterre, 106). It was a combination of the total dedication with which he pursued practical tasks, the emotional fervour with which he invested ideological causes, the utter lack of flexibility or moral relativism with which he viewed the world, and an ingrained natural piety which made him such an impressive figure and ultimately led to his political ruin. He was succeeded in his title and estates by his fourth son, Hugh, and perhaps his most enduring achievement may be accounted his foundation of one of England's most remarkable noble Catholic families.<br>
