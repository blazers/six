<span class="headword">Abramsky,  Yehezkel</span>  (1886&#150;1976), <span class="occ">rabbinic scholar and Orthodox Jewish leader</span>, was born on or about 7 February 1886 in Dashkovtsy, near Most and Grodno, Lithuania, the third child and eldest son of Mordecai Zalman Abramsky, a local timber merchant, and his wife, Freydel Goldin of Grodno. As a markedly promising Talmudic student he began while a boy the then usual peripatetic training at the <i>yeshivoth</i> (seminaries) of Telz, Mir, Slobodka, and particularly at Brisk under Hayyim Soloveitchik, the teacher and mentor he always venerated: and he earned his certification as a rabbi before he was eighteen. He married in 1909 Reizel (<i>d</i>. 1965), daughter of Israel Jonathan Jerusalimsky, head of the Jewish court at Iehumen, Russia. They had four sons.<br>
<br>Abramsky's ability as a jurisconsult was quickly recognized in Russia, and he was successively rabbi of Smolyan, Smolevich, and Slutzk. With the Bolshevik revolution and increasing attempts to repress traditional Jewish observance and culture, Abramsky exerted himself to encourage its continuation&#151;for example, by surreptitious (albeit legal) arrangement for circumcisions. For the same purpose he was co-founder in 1928 of a Hebrew periodical&#151;the last in Russia&#151;<span class="italic">Yagdil Torah</span>, which after two issues was proscribed. The Soviet government understood well Abramsky's standing in Russian Jewry; and, partly concerned for its own reputation abroad, in 1926 and again in 1928 it refused him permission to leave and take up the rabbinate of Petah Tikvah in Palestine. Worse followed. Herbert Hoover, as president of the United States, sent an inter-faith commission to investigate religious freedom in Russia as a prerequisite to establishing closer relations with the USSR. Abramsky, when interviewed, had said nothing; his silence was construed by the authorities as defamation of the Soviet Union, and he spent months eluding arrest. He was apprehended in 1929 and the death sentence demanded, but he was condemned (without trial) to five years' hard labour in Siberia.<br>
<br>Worldwide Jewish concern elicited diplomatic intervention, and in 1931, in exchange for six communists held by Chancellor Br&uuml;ning's government in Germany, Abramsky was given a month to leave Russia. Two of his sons were retained as hostages, and to avoid endangering them Abramsky in 1935 declined to succeed A. I. Kook as Ashkenazi chief rabbi of Palestine. Anthony Eden, the British foreign secretary, personally intervened to secure their release in 1937, Abramsky having come to London in 1932 as rabbi of the right-wing Orthodox community (Mahzikey Ha-dath). He was naturalized a British subject in 1937.<br>
<br>The United Synagogue, whose dominance within the Orthodox community was secured by act of parliament, invited Abramsky to head its ecclesiastical court. After undertakings that there would be no lay pressure for unacceptable relaxations of the law, he accepted and discharged his duties with exemplary conscientiousness until his retirement to Jerusalem in 1951. Notably, he tightened up the standards of kosher slaughtering; and he stood firm against conversions to Judaism of dubious sincerity for matrimonial purposes.<br>
<br>Abramsky's clarity of exposition drew large audiences for his London discourses (delivered in Yiddish) on aspects of Jewish law: even more well attended were his twice-weekly lectures in Jerusalem <i>yeshivoth</i>, maintained until a few years before his death. As president of the Council of <i>Yeshivoth</i>, the Private Education League, and other national bodies he was no mere figurehead, and whenever he made representations to the Israeli government regarding the protection of religious interests, he was heard with unfailing respect.<br>
<br>Abramsky's scholarly work followed traditional rabbinic methodology, ignoring external influences and parallels in, for example, Roman law. It was prodigious and fruitful. A memorial volume, published in Hebrew in Jerusalem in 1978, collected his Talmudic <i>novellae</i> and <i>responsa</i>, but his major monument was the 24-volume <span class="italic">Hazon Yehezkel</span>, a commentary on the <span class="roman">Tosefta</span> or &#145;supplementary&#146; digest of Jewish law compiled <i>c</i>.200 <span class="smallcap">AD</span>. Planned during the First World War, its approach was quite different from Lieberman's work which paralleled it in publication. The first volume appeared in 1925, the last in 1975; Abramsky had continued work on it in Siberia, smuggling it out on cigarette paper. In 1955 he was the first recipient of the Israel prize for literature; and he was the first commentator whose notes to the <span class="roman">Talmud</span> were printed alongside the classical commentaries in his own lifetime.<br>
<br>More significant than Abramsky's appointments and honours were his influence, his transparent saintliness, and his personal magnetism. Sir Robert Waley Cohen, lay leader of the United Synagogue and of an upper-class English background, recognized his sincerity and responded to it. And once, when an assimilated Jew, applying for a religious divorce, sneered at the &#145;medievalism&#146; of Abramsky's court, he met with a dignified rebuke that elicited apology. His leadership in England partly stimulated more intense observance and wider familiarity with rabbinic sources in segments of the United Synagogue, but conversely it accentuated Orthodox disregard for the analogously reinvigorated Reform community. Besides his world stature in rabbinical scholarship, Abramsky was respected in Israel as the last outstanding representative of a Jewish cultural life that had for 400 years shaped the Jewries of Russia and Poland: and the crowd (estimated at perhaps 40,000) attending his funeral made it the largest ever seen in Jerusalem, where he had died on 19 September 1976.<br>
