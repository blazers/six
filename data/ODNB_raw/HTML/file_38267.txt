<span class="headword">Stroudley,  William</span>  (1833&#150;1889), <span class="occ">mechanical engineer</span>, was born in Sandford, Oxfordshire, on 6 March 1833, one of three sons of William Stroudley, machinist in a local paper mill, and his wife, Anne. After education at a primary school he commenced work with his father at a paper mill and then, again with his father, at a Birmingham printing works. In 1847 he was apprenticed to John Inshaw, who had a small engineering business in Birmingham. His engineering training continued from 1853 to 1854 under Daniel Gooch, locomotive superintendent of the Great Western railway. He completed his training in 1855 on the Great Northern railway at Peterborough and became locomotive shed foreman. In 1861 he was appointed manager of the Cowlairs works of the Edinburgh and Glasgow (later North British) railway and in 1865 locomotive superintendent of the newly formed Highland railway at Inverness, where he rebuilt existing locomotives to make them more suitable for use over its heavily graded lines.<br>
<br>In 1870 Stroudley was appointed locomotive and carriage superintendent of the London, Brighton, and South Coast railway at a time when its locomotives, rolling-stock, and workshops were in poor condition. He rapidly set about building new and well-equipped workshops at Brighton and introduced new and more powerful locomotives for main-line and suburban passenger and freight services. All were of excellent design and construction and of elegant outline, enhanced by their bright yellow livery. His new passenger carriages were also impressive, with polished mahogany bodies. He was a pioneer in the introduction of train electric lighting, applied to a Pullman car only two years after the invention of the incandescent lamp by Thomas Edison in 1879. He was also responsible for the design of marine engines for the company's cross-channel steamers and patented a successful design for paddle wheels.<br>
<br>Stroudley was an active member of the institutions of Civil and Mechanical Engineers and in 1884 was awarded the George Stephenson medal and Telford premium for his outstanding paper &#145;The construction of locomotive engines&#146;. Previously, in 1878, one of his Terrier class 0&#150;6&#150;0 tank locomotives was awarded a gold medal at the Paris Exhibition, and in 1889 his Gladstone class locomotive of 0&#150;4&#150;2 type received a similar award. After the exhibition this locomotive took part in high-speed trials with a number of French locomotives. The locomotive <i>Gladstone</i> is preserved in the National Railway Museum, York.<br>
<br>While he was a firm disciplinarian Stroudley had the reputation of being scrupulously fair in dealing with his men, by whom he was much respected. He encouraged their interest and enthusiasm by allocating locomotives to individual drivers, whose names were painted in gold letters in the driving cab. He was short-sighted, broad, and stocky, with a dapper appearance.<br>
<br>Stroudley was married twice, first about 1860 to an unknown person who died in 1865, and second in 1877 to Elise Lumley Brewer, from a family engaged in finance. There were no children. Stroudley died from pneumonia at the Hotel Terminus, rue St Lazare, Paris, on 20 December 1889, following a severe chill after the testing of his locomotive. He was buried in the extramural cemetery in Brighton, where his wife was also later interred.<br>
