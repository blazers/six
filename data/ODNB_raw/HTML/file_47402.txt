<span class="headword">Hilles,  Richard</span>  (<em>c.</em>1514&#150;1587), <span class="occ">religious activist</span>, was the son of another Richard Hilles, who was master of the Merchant Taylors in 1504, and his wife, Elizabeth. In 1535 he was himself admitted to the freedom of the company, which was customarily awarded at the age of twenty-one. By his own testimony he was apprenticed to one Nicholas Cosyn on London Bridge. As an apprentice he seems to have embraced protestant views, and in 1532 fell out with his master for expressing forthright opinions on justification. In January 1533 he appealed for assistance to Thomas Cromwell from the refuge which he had sought at Rouen in Normandy; his mother, too, begged Cromwell to help her son. Hilles must have been reconciled with Cosyn in order to secure his freedom, but it is not known how that came about. His religious views seem to have become increasingly radical, and in 1536 he had a brush with John Stokesley, bishop of London, from which he was rescued by his mother.<br>
<br>Following the <span class="roman">Act of Six Articles</span> in 1539 Hilles felt his position to be increasingly dangerous, and in 1540 he used his business as an excuse to migrate to Strasbourg. In August of that year he initiated a correspondence with the Z&uuml;rich reformer Heinrich Bullinger, to whom he wrote &#145;I have determined not to return thither [England], unless it please God to effect such a change as that we may serve him there without hindrance&#146;  (Robinson, <span class="italic">Original Letters</span>, 1.198), and in June 1541 secured a residence permit in Strasbourg, describing himself as a cloth merchant. He did not apply for citizenship, for fear of losing his status as a merchant tailor, but travelled extensively up and down the Rhine on business, visiting Bullinger at Z&uuml;rich in 1542. He also became well known to other protestant Englishmen in the area and to the local leaders of reform, usually through his friendship with Bullinger. The letters which he wrote at this time represent his chief claim to fame and to evangelical credentials. In August 1548, having had time to assess the religious climate in England, he moved his family back to London.<br>
<br>Hilles's former master, Nicholas Cosyn, was master of the Merchant Taylors in 1549&#150;50, and this may help to explain why Hilles was called to the livery in 1549. By 1553 he seems to have been a member of the common council of London, and his children, born abroad, were naturalized by statute in March of that year. In June he was one of four merchant tailors who signed the letters patent in favour of Queen Jane. From this point on, Hilles gave his career precedence over his religious opinions, although he does not appear to have changed the latter. By November 1554 he was attending mass, a fact which he later made no pretence of denying. In 1555 he was a warden of the company, and probably senior warden the following year. Throughout Mary's reign the London livery companies conspired to defeat the vigilance of the ecclesiastical authorities, and Hilles's degree of conformity was quite sufficient to enable him to continue providing money and surreptitious support for protestants both at home and abroad. In 1561 he became master of the company and co-founder of the Merchant Taylors' School, London, donating &pound;500 towards the purchase of the site. His active involvement with the company continued after his mastership, and he became auditor in 1569, a position which he retained until shortly before his death. After 1559 his protestant convictions could safely reappear, and he resumed his correspondence with Bullinger as though nothing had happened. He also became active in supporting godly ministers when the opportunity arose. He had resumed (or continued) his overseas business connections after 1548, but moved the focus from Strasbourg to Antwerp. He received a grant of arms in 1568, and about 1582 was listed as one of the hundred or so wealthiest and most &#145;substantial&#146; citizens of London.<br>
<br>At some point before 1538 Hilles had married Agnes, daughter of Christopher Lacey of Yorkshire, gentleman. His eldest son, John, was born in that year, and three others, Gerson, Barnabas, and Daniel, followed between 1540 and 1548. It is probable that Agnes, John, and Barnabas predeceased him, because when he came to make his will in June 1586 he referred only to Daniel, Gerson, and Barnabas's daughter Elizabeth. His major bequests were charitable, particularly land and tenements on Tower Hill, to be developed and used as almshouses for widowed and impoverished company members. Perhaps it was for that reason that after his father's death in the following January Daniel questioned the will, and was given a copy by the court of the Merchant Taylors on 3 February 1587.<br>
