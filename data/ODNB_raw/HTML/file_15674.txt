<span class="headword">Kirkpatrick,  James</span>  (<em>c.</em>1676&#150;1743), <span class="occ">non-subscribing Presbyterian minister</span>, was probably born in Scotland, and was the son of Hugh Kirkpatrick (<i>d</i>. 1712), who was minister successively at Lurgan, co. Armagh, at Dalry and at Old Cumnock in Scotland, and finally at Ballymoney, co. Antrim. He matriculated at Glasgow University on 10 February 1691, being described as <i>Scoto-Hibernus</i>. Fellow students at Glasgow included John Simson and John Abernethy. On returning to Ireland he was licensed by the presbytery of Route in 1697. In 1699 he received a call from the congregation at Antrim but did not take this up, instead accepting a call to Templepatrick, co. Antrim, where he was ordained on 7 August 1699. Although he did marry, the name of his wife has not been recorded. While at Templepatrick he published <span class="italic">A Sermon Occasioned by the King's Death</span> (1702) and in 1703 he was appointed one of the trustees for the distribution of <i>regium donum</i>.<br>
<br>On 24 September 1706 Kirkpatrick resigned his charge at Templepatrick and accepted a call to Belfast as colleague to John McBride. Here he became a powerful defender of Presbyterian rights and a leading exponent of non-subscription. McBride had fled to Scotland to avoid arrest because of his refusal to take the oath abjuring the claims to the throne of James II's son. The Belfast congregation was growing rapidly, and in June 1706 McBride had written from Stranraer that if there were 3000 members there should be two meeting-houses and two distinct congregations. This was agreed and after some complicated negotiations the synod approved on 1 June 1708 the division of the Belfast congregation, McBride becoming minister of the congregation meeting in the old meeting-house and Kirkpatrick becoming minister of the Second Congregation in their new meeting-house, which had been built immediately behind the first. In 1712 Kirkpatrick was appointed moderator of the synod of Ulster and in the following year he published one of his major works, <span class="italic">An Historical Essay upon the Loyalty of Presbyterians</span> (1713). This is a substantial work, thought to have been published by James Blow of Belfast, which was produced as a response to the attacks on the Presbyterians by William Tisdall, vicar of Belfast. It was designed to account for the conduct of dissenters in recent history and to demonstrate the loyalty of Presbyterians.<br>
<br>From 1705 Kirkpatrick had been an early and influential member of the Belfast Society, an association of ministers which met to discuss theology. In the same year the synod introduced compulsory subscription to the Westminster confession and the Belfast Society provided the leadership of the campaign against subscription. In 1721 Kirkpatrick published an able plea for non-subscription in <span class="italic">A Vindication of the Presbyterian Ministers in the North of Ireland</span>. As the subscription controversy grew more heated the subscribing minority in both the First and Second congregations left to form the Third Congregation. When they held their first communion in February 1724 they refused to admit Kirkpatrick and Samuel Haliday (McBride's successor at the first congregation), which led Kirkpatrick to go into print with <span class="italic">A Scripture Plea Against a Fatal Rupture and Breach of Christian Communion</span> (1724). Matters came to a head in 1725, when all the non-subscribers were placed in the presbytery of Antrim; in 1726 they were finally excluded from the synod.<br>
<br>In 1732 Kirkpatrick received the degrees of MD and DD from Glasgow University. His later publications included not only theological works but a medical treatise, combining, as he did, the work of a physician with a pastoral office. His final work, <span class="italic">A Defence of Christian Liberty</span>, was published posthumously by James Blow in 1743. Kirkpatrick died in 1743, in Dublin, and was survived by his wife. The date and place of his burial are unknown.<br>
