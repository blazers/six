<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Macardell,  James</span>  (1727/8&#150;1765), <span class="occ">mezzotint engraver</span>, was born in Cow Lane, Dublin, in 1727 or 1728, possibly the son of Patrick Macardell. He learnt engraving in John Brooks's workshop, probably from Brooks's assistant Andrew Miller. His earliest work appears to be a head of Archbishop Boulter in an engraving altered from one by Brooks of Bishop Robert Howard. Brooks moved to London early in 1746, accompanied by his ablest assistants, where Macardell almost immediately sought to establish himself as an independent artist. He very soon supplanted the ageing John Faber as the engraver employed by the two leading portrait painters Thomas Hudson and Allan Ramsay, eventually scraping twenty-one mezzotints after Hudson and fourteen after Ramsay. He was also employed by the circle of George Knapton, Arthur Pond, and Rhoda Astley, and by various printsellers, for whom he produced designs as well as engravings. It was probably through Pond that Macardell was introduced to David Garrick. He engraved portraits of the actor and his leading lady Peg Woffington in 1748 for Pond, but before 1754 he had scraped three more portraits of Garrick, keeping the plates. In his early years in London Macardell was much drawn to the theatre, producing portraits of <span class="italic">Mr Woodward in the Character of the Fine Gentleman in Lethe</span> (<i>c</i>.1750), <span class="italic">Mr Quin in the Character of Sir John Falstaff</span> (<i>c</i>.1750), <span class="italic">Mr Blakes in the Character of M. le M&eacute;decin</span> (<i>c</i>.1750), <span class="italic">Mr Lowe and Mrs Chambers in the Characters of Captain Macheath and Polly</span> (1752), Beard (<i>c</i>.1752), and Hannah Pritchard (<i>c</i>.1750). Three of these reproduced his own drawings. All this substantiates the claim made in 1825 that Macardell &#145;was a jolly companion at the artists' clubs, and well known in the Green Room. Quin and he were sworn brothers&#146;  (Elmes, 1.14). The finest of these early portraits was <span class="italic">Mr Garrick in Hamlet</span> (1754), after a painting by Benjamin Wilson, showing the expression of terror on seeing the ghost of Old Hamlet, for which Garrick was famous.<br>
<br>By 1754 Macardell had established himself at the Golden Head on the corner of Henrietta Street and Southampton Street, Covent Garden, a few doors away from Garrick's home in Southampton Street. Now he was able to publish and sell his own work, secure in his reputation as the best mezzotint engraver in London. 1754 was also the year in which Joshua Reynolds published <span class="italic">Lady Charlotte Fitzwilliam</span>, the first print after one of his paintings, selecting Macardell to engrave it. It was the beginning of a fruitful association, driven by Reynolds's appreciation of Macardell's ability to promote him: &#145;by this man I shall be immortalized&#146;, he once said  (Strickland, 45). Macardell scraped thirty-eight of Reynolds's portraits with accuracy and sensitivity, often in the large full-length format employed for one of his finest portraits, that of Frances Ann Greville and her brother as Psyche and Cupid, exhibited in 1762. Reynolds painted Macardell's portrait in the late 1750s.<br>
<br>During the 1750s Macardell engraved several paintings by Rembrandt, and more particularly by Rubens and Van Dyck, demonstrating his virtuosity through his tonal interpretation of the luxuriant flesh and fabric of the Flemish school. He began to engrave the series of portraits by Peter Lely known as the &#145;Windsor Beauties&#146;, but completed only three. Macardell's success was a magnet for other talented Irishmen. Both Edward Fisher and James Watson seem to have spent time working with Macardell on their arrival in London from Dublin, Watson probably as a pupil. Macardell joined the Society for the Encouragement of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce in 1760, and exhibited from the first exhibition. In recognition of his eminence he was made an original director of the Society of Artists upon its incorporation in 1765. Although he avoided the perils of drink to which several of the Irish engravers succumbed, he died at the age of thirty-seven on 1 June 1765. Macardell loved to take the country air of Hampstead and his friends arranged for his burial at St John's, Hampstead, where a memorial stone in the churchyard rightly declared him to be &#145;the most eminent in his art in his time&#146;. He was unmarried, his estate being administered by his brother Philip Macardell of Dublin.<br>
