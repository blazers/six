<span class="headword">Johnston <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>de Beaulieu; <em>other married name </em>Dering]</span>,  Henrietta</span>  (<em>c.</em>1674&#150;1729), <span class="occ">pastellist</span>, was born in France, the daughter of Francis de Beaulieu (<i>d</i>. in or before 1694) and his wife, Susannah. She arrived with her family in England on 16 December 1687 and in March 1694 married Robert Dering, son of Sir Edward Dering, after receiving her mother's permission as she was only &#145;about 20&#146;. Afterwards they lived in Dublin, where Dering died before 1700. He had cousins and brothers there, one of whom, Daniel, was married to Helena Perceval, a daughter of Sir John Perceval, later first earl of Egmont. Robert Dering's sister, Elizabeth, was married to Sir Edward Southwell, a relation of the Percevals. The earliest pastels drawn by Henrietta Dering are of these Irish connections and their friends. Details of her training are unknown. In 1704 she drew Sir Emmanuel Moore and Sir John Perceval, resplendent in red coats, and the fourth earl of Barrymore, whose portrait shows her fresh colouring, notably in the face and wig. Henrietta Dering signed and dated her work on the wooden backings of her pastels, which survive as most are in their original frames. Her pastels of General Earle and Sir John Perceval of 1705 are stiff in pose; a third dated 1705, of a member of the Southwell family, is signed &#145;Henrietta Johnson Fecit&#146;, indicating that it was painted after she married the Revd Gideon Johnston (1668&#150;1716) on 11 April 1705, as his second wife. He had two young sons and she two daughters by their respective first marriages.<br>
<br>At some time in 1705 Gideon Johnston was recommended to the bishop of London as bishop's commissary in South Carolina. After a long delay the couple arrived there in spring 1708. They encountered many difficulties, including financial ones, and in 1709 Gideon Johnston wrote home saying, &#145;were it not for the Assistance my wife gives me by drawing of Pictures (which can last but a little time in a place so ill peopled) I shou'd not have been able to live&#146;  (papers of the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel). Other problems arose: on 5 July 1710 Johnston wrote again, &#145;My wife who greatly helped me, drawing pictures, has long ago made an end of her materials&#146;  (ibid.). In his reply to this letter, John Chamberlayne of the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel said, &#145;I have clubb'd wth Mr Shute in sending a small present of Crayons to Mrs Johnston in acknowledgement of the Rice etc which was lost wth poor Capt Cole&#146;  (American papers of the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel)&#151;a fascinating sidelight on an artist's problems in a new colony.<br>
<br>There is a distinct difference between Henrietta Johnston's Irish pastels and most of those done in Charles Town which may partly be attributed to her shortage of materials. The Irish work is strong and colourful, while, with exceptions, her colonial work is much paler and sometimes lacks detail. Her Charles Town sitters are shown bust length, not waist length, the usual format for her portraits drawn in Ireland. Some forty of her works are known, of which many drawn in America were of Huguenots. In its brilliant lively colour, her pastel of Henriette Charlotte de Chastaigner (Gibbes Museum of Art, Charleston), dated 1711, may be the result of the gift of crayons sent the previous year. It remains in perfect condition.<br>
<br>Henrietta Johnston was in London in 1711 with documents, letters, and other items for the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel before returning to America in mid-1712. The lack of portraits from 1712 to 1714 is probably due to two hurricanes and a war between British colonists and local mainly Yamasee Indians. The subsequent portraits of Colonel and Mrs Samuel Prioleau of 1715 (Museum of Early Southern Decorative Arts, North Carolina) are among her best American works.<br>
<br>In April 1716 Gideon Johnston was accidentally drowned. With her four children and other family members, Henrietta lived on in Charles Town. On 19 September 1719 she charged 2 pistoles for a portrait of Mr Clapp, but he paid &pound;10  (Mrs Elizabeth Sindrey's estate account book, 1705&#150;21, South Carolina Historical Society). This was more than she would have got in Ireland. In 1725 she was in New York drawing the Moore family, but she returned in 1726 to Charles Town, where she lived until her death on 9 March 1729. She was buried in St Philip's churchyard, Charles Town. Most of her pictures are in private collections.<br>
