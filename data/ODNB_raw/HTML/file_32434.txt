<span class="headword">Clasper,  John Hawks <span class="st"> [Jack]</span></span>  (1836&#150;1908), <span class="occ">boat builder and oarsman</span>, born in Newcastle upon Tyne on 13 October 1836, was the eldest of thirteen children (eight daughters and five sons) of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/52583/', "Henry Clasper (1812&#150;1870)")</script>, oarsman and boat builder, and his wife, Suzannah, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Hawks. In 1861 he married Ann Bilton, who died in 1866; in 1871 he was married again, this time to Elizabeth, daughter of George Rough of Wandsworth.<br>
<br>Clasper's father was one of the best-known professional oarsmen of his day and was also a boat builder of vision. Jack Clasper began his rowing career as a coxswain at the age of ten, and in 1849 he coxed his father's four, which won the championship of England at the Royal Thames regatta. In 1851 he steered his father's boat again at Henley royal regatta, the only time that the stewards have ever offered a prize for professionals. In 1854 he was apprenticed to a London waterman and about the same time he embarked on a sculling and rowing career that was to last for twenty-two years. He was slight in build, his rowing weight being just over 8 stone and his height slightly below 5 feet 6 inches. This may have handicapped him as a sculler since he was never quite in the same class as the best professionals. Nevertheless, he had a number of important victories, most notably over George Francis in 1858 on the Thames, twice over Tom Pocock in 1861, also on the Thames, and over George Drewitt in 1861, on the Tyne; the last of these was for &pound;200, a reasonably large sum for a professional sculler. Clasper frequently rowed in a pair-oar with his father, and W. B. Woodgate, a noted amateur, described their skill in such a boat as &#145;the acme of homogeneous rowing&#146;. But it was in four-oared boats that Clasper had his greatest success. He won many professional races on the Tyne, on the Wear at Durham, and elsewhere; and in 1857, 1859, and 1862 he won the four-oared championship of England at the Thames National, the most important of the watermen's regattas. His last known race was in 1876, when he stroked and won a prize in a scratch eight at Oxford regatta.<br>
<br>Clasper was also well-known as a pilot of scullers, sitting in the bow of a following eight guiding a sculler during a race, a practice allowed in professional matches. He was also an expert trainer, his most successful pupil being Robert Chambers of the Tyne, whom he coached to his fifth sculling championship of England on 22 November 1866, over the Putney to Mortlake course on the Thames in London.<br>
<br>Clasper began to learn boat-building skills from his father at an early age. By 1863 he had established himself in the boat-building business at Durham, and his workshop there was still being used for making boats over a hundred years later. He then moved south to the Thames in London, first to Lambeth and then to Wandsworth before finally settling at Putney in 1868. His premises there still bore his name in the 1990s, when they were being used as the Westminster School boathouse. Clasper subsequently extended the business to Oxford, although in 1883 he handed over the Oxford branch to his brother-in-law Frederick Rough; he also left the Putney branch to Rough on his death.<br>
<br>Clasper's emergence as a first-class boat builder coincided with two developments. One was the extension to eights of his father's innovative methods; these included fitting the keel on the inside, making the shell smooth, and fitting outriggers. Henry Clasper's one attempt to build an eight in this manner had apparently been a failure but Matthew Taylor, another Tyne professional, had been more successful with an eight of this type built for the Royal Chester Club in 1856. Jack Clasper also experimented with the shape and length of such boats, setting the widest part of an eight well forward towards the bows. This design idea, with which Taylor also experimented, produced a porpoise-like shape. Clasper also experimented with a shallow draft in an attempt to reduce water friction, and by the 1890s he had lengthened his eights to 63 feet or more, seeking to avoid the problem of longitudinal oscillation. He also addressed the issue of the effect of side winds on the steering of boats, first by installing a countervail to the bows and then, more successfully, by adding a metal fin below the stern.<br>
<br>The other development was the sliding seat, an American invention, first used in England on the Tyne in 1871. Several oarsmen and scullers, amateurs as well as professionals (and including Clasper himself), had tried sliding on the greased deck of their boats, but it was a long time before the sliding seat mechanism became reliable. Clasper played an important part in bringing it to perfection through his experiments with various combinations of brass and steel slides together with glass and bone rollers.<br>
<br>By the 1880s, Clasper had established a high reputation as a builder of good racing boats. (His main rivals were Swaddle and Winship, a Tyne-based business, and Sims of Putney.) By the end of the century he was building boats for export to the continent and to many other parts of the world, including South America and New Zealand. Oxford and Cambridge both used his eights for the boat race, and the victorious boats of 1870, 1871, 1872, 1873, and 1883 were all from his workshop. The last of these was a particularly fine example of his craft. Oxford took delivery of it after training in a Swaddle and Winship boat, and they proceeded to win against the odds.<br>
<br>A well-known and much respected figure in the rowing world, Jack Clasper's integrity and expertise were &#145;recognised among all classes of oarsmen&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>). He died of bronchitis on 15 September 1908 at his home at 154 Lower Richmond Road, Putney. His funeral at Putney cemetery was attended by many watermen as well as by representatives of amateur clubs from Britain and abroad, including Oxford University Boat Club and the Soci&eacute;t&eacute; Nautique de la Basse Seine, a French club of which he was a life member.<br>
