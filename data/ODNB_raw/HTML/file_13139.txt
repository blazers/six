<span class="headword">Heton,  Thomas</span>  (<em>b. </em><em>c.</em>1520, <em>d.</em> in or after 1587), <span class="occ">merchant and religious activist</span>, was probably the Thomas Etton made free of the Mercers' Company in 1539 as late apprentice of William Locke. Such a date suggests he was born about 1520. The memorial inscription of his nephew <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13138/', "Martin Heton")</script> suggests that Thomas was descended from the family of Heton of Lancashire. However, an alternative parentage may be provided in the will of William Heton, merchant tailor of London. Heton's will, dated 28 October 1523 and proved on 22 December, refers to &#145;George, Anne, and Thomas, mine own natural children&#146;, all of whom were then underage. Like his brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/68277/', "George Heton")</script>, he became a &#145;sustainer&#146; of protestants after the accession of Mary. Unlike George, he quickly chose exile and on 4 April 1554 petitioned the council of Strasbourg for burgher rights. Thereafter he kept open house for fugitive fellow countrymen, such as James Pilkington and Thomas Sampson. In September 1557 he signed Strasbourg's letter of reconciliation with the Frankfurt exile community and on 5 December 1558 thanked the Strasbourg magistrates for their hospitality since 1554.<br>
<br>On his return to the England of Elizabeth, Heton settled in the London parish of St Lawrence Jewry. In April 1560 he stood surety for Edwin Sandys's firstfruits as bishop of Worcester and in June was present at the election of elders for the re-established French protestant church in London. It was probably he rather than George whom John Jewel described later that year as his &#145;friend Mr Heton&#146;  (BL, Egerton MS 2533, fol. 5<i>r</i>). Heton had advanced him &pound;307, the entire sum needed to discharge Jewel's initial instalment of his first fruits as bishop of Salisbury.<br>
<br>As &#145;governor of the merchants&#146; Heton was involved after 1562 in negotiations for adopting the port of Emden as an alternative to Catholic Antwerp for the export of English cloth. In these Edmund Grindal, bishop of London, acted as intermediary between William Cecil and Jan Utenhove, lay leader of the foreign protestant community in London and agent for Anna, countess of East Friesland.<br>
<br>Heton remained on close terms with Thomas Sampson. Both men were appointed overseers of the will of Nicholas Culverwell in 1569, and in 1573 Sampson interceded with Cecil on Heton's behalf, asking that he be allowed to transport English cloth without paying customs duties. Strype's assumption that this indicated a terminal decline in his fortunes is wide of the mark, although it may point to a temporary set-back after the final failure of the Emden scheme.<br>
<br>At the time of the sack of Antwerp by Spanish troops in November 1576, Heton was governor of the English merchant adventurers there. The poet George Gascoigne, who wrote an eye-witness account of the sack and subsequent massacre, described him as &#145;a comely aged man &hellip; whose hoary hairs might move pity &hellip; especially the uprightness of his dealing considered&#146;  (Pollard, 447). The English were nevertheless held to ransom and left at the mercy of Spanish troops. Two letters from Heton to the English government, describing the plight and tribulations of the Antwerp merchants and begging for assistance, are printed along with Gascoigne's <span class="italic">The Spoil of Antwerp</span> in <span class="italic">Tudor Tracts</span> (1903).<br>
<br>In 1582, still of St Lawrence Jewry, Heton was rated at the high figure of &pound;70 in the London subsidy assessment and in 1586 became master of the Mercers. In such circumstances Grindal's bequest to him in 1583&#151;the &#145;fifty pounds which he oweth me&#146;&#151;is not good evidence that his &#145;loving friend&#146; was once more in financial difficulties  (Strype, <span class="italic">Grindal</span>, 604).<br>
<br>Having completed his year as master of the Mercers in July 1587, Heton makes only one further appearance in their court records, on 15 November following. Although he probably died shortly afterwards, the exact date is unknown and like his brother he seems to have left no will. The identity of his wife, who was with him in Antwerp, has not been established. The will of a contemporary namesake (Eton), citizen and grocer of London, was proved on 16 February 1571. To judge from its bequests, which included money for sermons at Kinver, Staffordshire, his birthplace, the two men were unrelated.<br>
