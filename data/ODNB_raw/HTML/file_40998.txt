<span class="headword">Lind-af-Hageby,  (Emilie Augusta) Louise</span>  (1878&#150;1963), <span class="occ">animal welfare campaigner</span>, was born in Sweden on 20 September 1878, the daughter of Emil Lind-af-Hageby, a lawyer, and granddaughter of a chamberlain to the king of Sweden. She attended Cheltenham Ladies' College for a short period from 1896 and made her main home in England from 1902 until her death, becoming a British citizen in 1912.<br>
<br>In 1900 Lind-af-Hageby went to Paris with her friend Liesa Schartau; a visit to the Pasteur Institute there allegedly led directly to her crusade against animal experimentation. She succeeded Frances Power Cobbe (1822&#150;1904) as doyenne of the British anti-vivisectionist movement. Like Cobbe, she used vigorous journalism and public speaking to pursue her campaigns, especially under the auspices of the Animals Defence and Anti-Vivisection Society (later the Animal Defence Society) which she founded in 1906, and as founder-owner, editor, and main columnist of the <span class="italic">Anti-Vivisection Review</span> for forty years from its establishment in 1909. In her voluminous writings and many speeches she, like Cobbe, linked the case for opposition to animal experiments to the cause of animals generally, to opposition to authoritarian public health, and, especially, before 1914, to the cause of women's emancipation.<br>
<br>Lind-af-Hageby's public career as an anti-vivisectionist in England began in 1903 with the publication, with Liesa Schartau, of <span class="italic">The Shambles of Science</span>. This purported to be an eye-witness account by the two young women of their experience in physiology classes which they had attended in 1902&#150;3 while enrolled as visiting students at the London School of Medicine for Women. Their claims to have witnessed a conscious dog at a demonstration in University College, London, were widely publicized by Stephen Coleridge (1854&#150;1936), secretary of the National Anti-Vivisection Society. When Coleridge was successfully sued for libel by Professor W. M. Bayliss (1860&#150;1924), the physiologist leading the demonstration, Lind-af-Hageby was a key witness for the defence at the much publicized trial. Afterwards, a chapter entitled &#145;Fun&#146;, depicting the jocularity with which students and teachers allegedly regarded a conscious dog's suffering, was withdrawn from subsequent editions of <span class="italic">The Shambles of Science</span>.<br>
<br>The allegations made in Louise Lind-af-Hageby's book and at the trial were central concerns of the second royal commission on vivisection (1906&#150;12), to which she gave extensive evidence. In 1906 anti-vivisectionists erected a statue of the Brown Dog in Battersea, which became a focus of contention between anti-vivisectionists and medical students and among local residents and politicians until it was removed in 1910. Lind-af-Hageby's regular public speaking and writing in favour of both the Brown Dog and women's suffrage during this period reinforced the association between anti-vivisection and the cause of women. She attacked animal experimentation as morally and scientifically wrong, urging the development of an alternative &#145;science of anti-vivisection&#146; with which to criticize an erroneous biological method  (<span class="italic">Anti-Vivisection Review</span>, 1, 1909, 23) She attributed growing support for the cause of animals and the enfranchisement of women to &#145;a general undercurrent of rising humanity&#146;, and saw these as stepping stones towards a new humanitarian morality &#145;which consciously or unconsciously is coveted in all efforts to help the down-trodden and suffering&#146;  (ibid., 91).<br>
<br>Lind-af-Hageby was the main instigator of the first of two international anti-vivisectionist congresses held in London in July 1909. Her congress promoted gradualist tactics as the best means of ending animal experimentation whereas the other brought together those unwilling to contemplate compromise. In 1913 she was a central figure in another much publicized libel case, this time as unsuccessful plaintiff against Dr C. W. Saleeby (1878&#150;1940), a prominent eugenicist and temperance campaigner who, she alleged, had accused her of being &#145;a systematic liar&#146; in her campaign against vivisection.<br>
<br>In the First World War, Louise Lind-af-Hageby founded the Purple Cross Service, authorized by the French war office, for sick and wounded warhorses. She continued to promote the welfare of animals affected by war during the 1920s, 1930s, and the Second World War, leading an animal protection deputation to the disarmament conference of the League of Nations in Geneva in 1932. Although public support for the anti-vivisectionist cause declined after the end of the war, her own implacable opposition to scientific use of animals continued, often in close association with her great friend Nina, duchess of Hamilton (1878&#150;1951), in whose memory she established the Ferne Animal Sanctuary in Dorset in 1954. She died at her home, 7 St Edmunds Terrace, Regent's Park, London, on 26 December 1963.<br>
