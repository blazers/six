<span class="headword">Elsynge,  Henry</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1577, <em>d.</em> 1635), <span class="occ">parliamentary official</span>, belonged to a family that came originally from Duxworth in Cambridgeshire and was baptized on 21 August 1577 at St Dunstan-in-the-West, London. He was the eldest of the three sons and second of the four children of another Henry Elsynge (<i>d</i>. 1582), merchant tailor of the same parish, and his wife, Frances, the daughter of Edmund Browne, also a merchant tailor of St Dunstan's. In 1584 Frances married Henry Knyvett (<i>d</i>. 1601), an elder half-brother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37211/', "Robert Bowyer")</script>, later clerk of the parliaments.<br>
<br>Elsynge was educated at St Alban's School. He entered Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, as a pensioner on 14 October 1597 but did not graduate. He was admitted a student at the Middle Temple on 19 February 1597 and was called to the bar on 19 April 1605. In 1604 he was appointed, jointly with Robert Bowyer, keeper of the records in the Tower of London, an office that they held until 1612. On 27 November 1609 Bowyer succeeded to the office of clerk of the parliaments and shortly afterwards brought Elsynge to assist him in the House of Lords. On 1 September 1613 Elsynge was granted the reversion of the office of clerk of the parliaments, to which he succeeded on Bowyer's death on 15 March 1621. He held the office until his death, although he ceased to officiate in the House of Lords at the dissolution of parliament in March 1629. Thereafter he lived principally at his manor of Cornwell in Oxfordshire.<br>
<br>Elsynge played an important part in the codification of the procedure of the House of Lords and in the development and preservation of its records. His principal claim to recognition is as a scholar and historian of parliament, using the original documents to which his official positions at the Tower and at Westminster gave him access. His studies formed the basis of his treatise on parliament entitled <span class="italic">The Manner of Holding Parliaments in England, or, Modus tenendi parliamentum apud Anglos</span>, which remained unfinished at his death. Subsequently various parts have been published. Book 1 first appeared in 1660. A chapter on judicature, formerly attributed in error to John Selden, appeared in an imperfect form in 1681 and in a corrected version in 1990. A further chapter, <span class="italic">Expedicio billarum antiquitus</span>, was published in 1954, edited by Catherine S. Sims. A tract entitled <span class="italic">The Manner of Passing Bills in Parliament</span>, published in 1685, may have formed part of the same work. Elsynge's notes of debates in the House of Lords between 1621 and 1628 were published in 1870, 1879, and 1929.<br>
<br>Elsynge married on 12 July 1600 Blanche, or Alse (<i>d</i>. 1612), daughter of Richard Hyett and niece of Robert Bowyer. They had two sons of whom the elder, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8765/', "Henry Elsynge (bap. 1606, d. 1656)")</script>, was clerk of the House of Commons from 1639 to 1649. With his second wife, Jane, daughter of Richard Hardy of Dorset, Elsynge had a further four sons and one daughter. He died in 1635, probably in the month of November, as his will was dated 13 October 1635 and his successor was appointed on 1 December that year.<br>
