<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Phillips,  Richard</span>  (1778&#150;1851), <span class="occ">chemist</span>, was born on 21 November 1778, in George Yard, Lombard Street, London, the fifth of at least eleven children of James Phillips (1745&#150;1799), printer and bookseller, and his wife, Mary (<i>c</i>.1746&#150;1808), daughter of the London linen draper John Whiting and his wife, Judith. Catherine Phillips, the Quaker preacher, was his stepgrandmother and he was brought up in a strongly Quaker environment. He married, at Devonshire House on 14 April 1807, Ann Rickmann, with whom he had at least nine children between 1808 and 1832. For reasons that are not known he was disowned by the Gracechurch Street monthly meeting in November 1811. However, he retained some form of association with the Quakers since all his children (apart from Caroline, born 1812) enjoyed birthright membership of the society.<br>
<br>Phillips was educated as a chemist and druggist under William Allen and received his first instructions in chemistry from George Fordyce. With his elder brother, William Phillips, Allen, Luke Howard, and others, Phillips founded, in 1796, the Askesian Society which promoted scientific knowledge and research. From this society stemmed the Geological Society, founded in 1807; Phillips was one of the original members, serving on its committee and first council, 1808&#150;11. He also joined the City Philosophical Society, founded by John Tatum in 1808, which was aimed at the mutual self-improvement of its members. There he met Michael Faraday, with whom he formed a lifelong friendship. They and others migrated to the Society of Arts after the City Philosophical Society ceased to be active following its temporary proscription in 1817.<br>
<br>In 1811 Phillips published his first major work, an experimental examination of the <span class="italic">Pharmacopoeia Londinensis</span> which was severely critical of its contents. He followed this up with a further attack in 1816. This led to his preparing his own translation, the first edition of which was published in 1824 (2nd edn, 1831; 3rd edn, 1837; 4th edn, 1851). This pharmaceutical chemical work established Phillips's reputation as a chemical analyst of the highest competence.<br>
<br>Phillips supported himself by a combination of analytical work, including giving expert testimony at trials, and by lecturing on chemistry. From 1817 he lectured at the London Hospital. During the 1820s he gave several courses at the London Institution and in Birmingham. He was professor of chemistry at the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, at the school of medicine in Webb Street, Southwark, founded by Edward Grainger, and, from 1832, at St Thomas's Hospital. In 1837 he applied unsuccessfully for the professorship of chemistry at University College. In 1839 he was appointed chemist and curator at the Museum of Practical Geology at Charing Cross and assisted in its transfer to Jermyn Street (but died the day before the new premises opened).<br>
<br>Out of more than seventy papers, Phillips published only two (one with Faraday) in the <span class="italic">Philosophical Transactions</span>. From 1821 to 1826 he was editor of the <span class="italic">Annals of Philosophy</span>, one of the major journals for the communication of general scientific knowledge. From 1827 this journal was merged with the <span class="italic">Philosophical Magazine</span>, edited by Richard Taylor. Although Phillips's name appeared as an editor until his death, it is clear that, at best, he was junior to Taylor. All the chemical articles in the <span class="italic">Penny Cyclopaedia</span> were written by him.<br>
<br>Elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1822, Phillips served on council in 1839&#150;41 and from 1850 until his death. In 1841 he was one of the founders of the Chemical Society, of which he was vice-president in 1841&#150;3 and 1846&#150;7 before becoming president in 1849&#150;51. He was also president of the Chemical Section of the British Association at its 1848 meeting in Swansea. These positions emphasize the important role that he played in the institutionalization of science throughout the first half of the nineteenth century, without which the growth of professional science would have been retarded.<br>
<br>Phillips died on 11 May 1851 at Camberwell and was buried in Norwood cemetery.<br>
