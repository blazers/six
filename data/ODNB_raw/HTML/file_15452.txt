<span class="headword">Ker,  John</span>, third duke of Roxburghe  (1740&#150;1804), <span class="occ">book collector</span>, was born on 23 April 1740, at Hanover Square, London, the oldest of four surviving children of Robert Ker, second duke (<i>c</i>.1709&#150;1755), and his wife, Essex (<i>d</i>. 1764), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/19416/', "Sir Roger Mostyn, third baronet")</script>. He succeeded to the dukedom on 20 August 1755, while a schoolboy at Eton College, which he left in 1758. Later he travelled in continental Europe, where he became friends with Christiana Sophia Albertina, eldest daughter of the duke of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, and intended to marry her. But in September 1761 Christiana's younger sister, Charlotte, married George III. If Roxburghe had married Christiana, she would have become Charlotte's subject. The obituary of Roxburghe in the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> (1st ser., 74, 1804, 383) says that this problem of etiquette, &#145;operating with some other reasons, broke off the negociation&#146;.<br>
<br>Whatever the other reasons, Roxburghe never married, and it is a plausible interpretation that his unlucky romance changed the character of his life. Certainly, Sir Walter Scott, who was personally acquainted with Roxburghe, was of this view:<blockquote>Youthful misfortunes, of a kind against which neither rank nor wealth possess a talisman, had cast an early shade of gloom over his prospects, and given to one so splendidly endowed with the means of enjoying society that degree of reserved melancholy which prefers retirement to the splendid scenes of gaiety. (Scott, 44.446)</blockquote>Roxburghe did become a lord of the bedchamber (1767), knight of the Thistle (1768), groom of the stole and first lord of the bedchamber (1796), privy councillor (1796), and&#151;being permitted to retain the Thistle, which was unusual&#151;knight of the Garter (1801). He enjoyed a role at the court as friend of George III, which would explain why he lived much of the time in London; he purchased a house at 13 St James's Square in 1795 and kept his main library there until his death. This friendship with the king was itself supported by their shared interests in book collecting; George Nicol, bookseller to both George III (since 1781) and the duke, comments on the king's appreciation of Roxburghe  (Nicol and Nicol, 20 [18]). When at Floors Castle, his Scottish family home, Roxburghe was, as we know from Scott's description, keen on outdoor pursuits, but book collecting was his primary interest. In 1807 Nicol wrote that it was the duke's<blockquote>favourite plan to pass through life among his books, studiously endeavouring to conceal, from the world, his eminent talents, and his extensive knowledge. And so successful was he in this endeavour, that neither his neighbours in the country, nor his friends in the Capital, seem to have been much acquainted with them. (ibid., 19&#150;20 [17&#150;18])</blockquote>This passion for book collecting may well have had a family origin. The Valdarfer Boccaccio (Boccaccio, <span class="italic">Decamerone</span>, 1471), which most sensationally sold in 1812 for &pound;2260, a record price for a single book until 1884, features in a story told by Sir Walter Scott. Two famous collectors, Lord Oxford (either Robert Harley, first earl of Oxford, or Edward Harley, second earl of Oxford) and Lord Sunderland (Charles Spencer, third earl of Sunderland), were dining with Roxburghe's father when they talked about the 1471 Boccaccio, which the second duke duly acquired and, on a later occasion, produced for them. &#145;His son &hellip; who never forgot the little scene upon this occasion, used to ascribe to it the strong passion which he ever afterwards felt for rare books and editions&#146;  (Scott, 44.446&#150;7). There are serious chronological problems with this anecdote, but Roxburghe was himself clear about the origins of his interest, and it is likely to contain a kernel of truth.<br>
<br>It is difficult to judge when Roxburghe's collecting began in earnest, as it is very poorly documented. The earliest noteworthy acquisition that can be dated is the purchase, in 1788, of two volumes of black-letter ballads previously owned by Thomas Pearson  (Nicol and Nicol, 5). Roxburghe was himself passionately interested in ballad literature and added a third volume. The three volumes, now in the British Library, were published by the Ballad Society as <span class="italic">The Roxburghe Ballads</span> (ed. W. Chappell and J. W. Ebsworth, 9 vols., 1869&#150;99). His library grew apace, and at his death it totalled an estimated 30,000 volumes. The most significant part was the collection of early English literature, with twenty-three English incunabula, including fifteen Caxtons, and a large number of rare sixteenth-century editions; he also owned rare and important early Scottish books. Analysis suggests that he was driven not so much by a desire to own early or fine books regardless of their content (otherwise it would be strange that he owned no more than about 120 incunabula, and never acquired a copy of the <span class="roman">Gutenberg Bible</span>) as by his subject interests. Thus, he followed up the romances among his English literature collection with manuscripts of French Arthurian texts and a wide selection of romances from across mainland Europe. That he collected by theme is also shown by George Nicol, who noted that at the time of his death Roxburghe was &#145;in full pursuit of collecting our dramatic authors&#146;  (Nicol and Nicol, 14).<br>
<br>Roxburghe died at his London house of an inflammation of the liver on 19 March 1804, and was buried at Bowden, near Melrose. He was survived by two sisters, but his younger brother, Robert (<i>b</i>. 1747), had died in 1781, and his successor in the dukedom was the seventh Lord Bellenden. However, the fourth duke died in 1805, leaving a disputed succession. Only when this was resolved in 1812 was the duke's library&#151;in both London and Floors Castle&#151;sent to the sale rooms: in London in two parts, beginning 18 May (forty-two days) and 13 July (four days), totalling &pound;23,341, and in Kelso on 16 September 1813. Roxburghe's fame really stems from the sale of his library, which has gone down in the history of book collecting as the high point of obsessive collecting for which Thomas Frognall Dibdin coined the term &#145;bibliomania&#146; in his <span class="italic">Bibliomania, or, Book-Madness</span> (1809). Roxburghe books are today the prized possessions of many of the world's great libraries, and their collector is immortalized by the distinction of having named after him one of the most exclusive and famous of bibliographical societies, the Roxburghe Club, which was formed at a dinner held on 17 June 1812, on the day when the Valdarfer Boccaccio was scheduled for auction.<br>
