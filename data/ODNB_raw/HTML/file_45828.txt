<span class="headword">Stone <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Holmes]</span>,  Sarah</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1701&#150;1737), <span class="occ">midwife</span>, was daughter of &#145;the famous Mrs. <i>Holmes</i>&#146;, midwife, of Bridgwater  (Stone, xxiii). Of Mrs Holmes nothing is known except that she trained her daughter. Sarah then worked for six years as her mother's deputy, and valued her practical training more highly even than having, exceptionally for a female, &#145;read Anatomy&#146; and attended autopsies on &#145;several Women&#146;  (ibid., xv). By 1701 she was in practice, though some of her clients thought her rather young. About 1703, after her mother's death and perhaps because of her marriage, she moved from Bridgwater to Taunton. A number of people named Stone lived in that town, but Sarah's husband is not identifiable. He too was a medical practitioner, perhaps a surgeon, probably an apothecary. The couple had at least one daughter, who in turn became a qualified midwife in Bristol about 1726.<br>
<br>In Taunton, Stone's practice comprised &#145;a town wholly depending on the Woollen Manufactory, the Combing and Weaving Part&#146; and a wide agricultural area  (Stone, xiii). Weaving, she reckoned, was a very bad trade for pregnant women. At a time when female control of birth practices was being gradually taken over by the man-midwife or obstetric surgeon, this district lacked any such person. Rural midwives were often ignorant and unskilful: unable, for instance, to recognize labour pains and apt to induce labour prematurely. Stone found herself in a position more usual for male practitioners, and was often called in as a last resort when labour had lasted too long and the prognosis looked grim. Her technique of manually turning or shifting a wrongly presenting baby in the womb was particularly useful in saving difficult situations. Stone travelled long distances on bad roads, and towards the end of her time in Taunton she was delivering about 300 babies annually. She kept notes on her difficult cases.<br>
<br>After about seventeen years the family moved from Taunton to Bristol. Stone says she decided to move because overwork was damaging her health; but professional ambition may have influenced the choice of expensive, fashionable Bristol. Here, among many competitors of both sexes, Stone judged that men (often barely out of their barber&#150;surgeon apprenticeship) were being called in and forceps used far too often. Forceps injuries of a kind virtually unknown to her or her mother were common in Bristol. Stone aimed to combat this trend through improving the education of women midwives so as to render them superior to men in manual dexterity, through knowledge of the healthy female body, and through experience of normal, unpathological pregnancy and delivery. In 1736 she reworked into book form the manuscript notes which she had already shown to colleagues such as John Allen of Bridgwater. This project was connected with another move: this time to London. By December 1736, with the book in draft, the family was settled in Piccadilly, and Stone's husband wrote to Allen for references to help their professional establishment.<br>
<br>Sarah Stone's <span class="italic">Complete practice of midwifery consisting of upwards of forty cases or observations in that valuable art, selected from many others, in the course of a very extensive practice, and interspersed with many necessary cautions and useful instructions, proper to be observed in the most dangerous and critical exigencies, as well when the delivery is difficult in its own nature, as when it becomes so by the rashness or ignorance of unexperienc'd pretenders, recommended to all female practitioners in an art so important to the lives and well-being of the sex</span> was published in 1737. It consists of a preface and forty-two &#145;observations&#146; of challenging cases, covering nearly fifty births in all. Four of these cases happened during Stone's early years in Bridgwater, and three more lately in Bristol; the bulk of the book deals with Taunton and its rural hinterland. Just over half the infants (twenty-five) failed to survive; but only three of forty-seven mothers died, either in or just after childbirth. Stone did not hold herself responsible for these deaths, since she was often called in too late. One woman had been in labour for nine days, with her child long since dead and putrefied; even omitting that exceptional case, the average length of labours to which Stone was summoned out of desperation was more than three days and two nights. Most of the women in these cases came close to death; though Stone stressed that trouble-free childbirth was the norm, she did not write about it. Once she hesitated to take on a patient who seemed a hopelessly bad risk, but then agreed to do so out of compassion.<br>
<br>Stone's book is notable as literature as well as medical history. Her meticulous, detailed empirical observation combines with gripping narrative control and vivid phrasing. She draws on the imagery of heroic romance to present herself as a champion of enlightenment, combating the dragons of ignorance and inertia. At a time when most women writers sound almost contorted in their expressions of humility, Stone thought &#145;any Person may take an <i>honest Pride</i> in the Approbation of the <i>Worthy</i>&#146;  (Stone). Nothing is known about Stone's career in London.<br>
<br>Stone was a remarkable midwife: she was capable of both empathy and detachment, and was sensitive not only to the mother's pain and fear, but also to her need for some autonomy in the birth process. She liked to let the mother choose her position for giving birth, even when the position chosen was not one she favoured herself. She valued both learning and (literally) hands-on experience, believing that even the most skilled practitioner could always learn something new from a difficult case. She rejected superstition for science, though at excruciating moments (as when she felt her finger being sucked in the womb by a baby who, she knew, was most unlikely to be born alive) she drew strength from referring the outcome to God. She sometimes sought to learn the reason for a stillbirth by carrying out her own dissection, yet she felt passionately against any unnecessary mutilation of even a dead body. The exact date of Stone's death is unknown, though it is clear from her book that she was still alive in December 1736.<br>
