<span class="headword">Raper,  George Frederick</span>  (1909&#150;1973), <span class="occ">mechanical engineer and inventor of wool textile machinery</span>, was born at 7 Cranbourne Road, Bradford, on 4 April 1909, the son of Arthur Ernest Raper (1870&#150;1948) and his wife, Maggie Maud, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Smith (1878/9&#150;1960). Arthur Raper was chairman and managing director of the long-established woolcombers Isaac Holden &amp; Sons Ltd, Bradford, where his father had also been managing director. George attended the Leys School, Cambridge. He initially proposed to read medicine, and went to Jesus College, Cambridge, but he graduated in 1930 with a third-class honours degree in mechanical engineering. His early practical experience included a period as an engineer with the Cunard Line. He then joined Isaac Holden &amp; Sons as a machine operator, the usual way for members of mill-owning families to learn the business. At this time he was also attending Bradford Technical College to learn about textiles. In 1937 he went on a world tour to study the wool textile industry and on his return to Holdens in 1938 he was appointed manager; in 1939 he was made a director. On 21 October 1939 he married Constance Joan (Nan) Williams (<i>b</i>. 1914/15), a schoolteacher, the daughter of William John Williams, ironmonger.<br>
<br>During his early years at Holdens Raper made several improvements on the chemical and engineering side of wool-combing. He then turned his attention to the design and building of a new wool-combing machine. An experimental room was provided for him to work in, but the outbreak of war halted these activities. Raper was commissioned into the Territorial Army before the war, and during it his activities included work on the searchlight-aided interception of enemy aircraft; later he lectured on the subject. On demobilization in 1945 he held the rank of lieutenant-colonel.<br>
<br>Raper returned to the Holden factory as mill manager, but the idea of a new approach to the preparation of wool slivers for the combing operation, later called the &#145;autoleveller&#146;, had remained in his mind since 1938, and took much of his effort and interest. In early 1948 his father died, and his cousin was appointed managing director. Support for his experiments was no longer so readily available and that same year he resigned from his &pound;4000 a year position, although he retained his seat on the board. His annual income was now &pound;400, and he took a cottage where he fitted out a bedroom as an engineering workshop. He worked single-handedly, taking responsibility for all calculations, designs, and patents. Friends in the industry provided facilities for proving his ideas, and in 1951 he perfected his machine.<br>
<br>The autoleveller unit, originally intended for use in the wool-combing sector of the industry, was also employed in worsted yarn manufacture. The autoleveller measured the volume of wool entering the machine and recorded any variations on a memory wheel, which, at the appropriate time, controlled the subsequent attenuation given to the material. This significantly improved the uniformity of the product. Consequently the number of operations required to produce a yarn was reduced from eight to three, with savings in labour, energy, and floorspace, and when used in conjunction with Ambler's &#145;superdraft unit&#146; it achieved one of the greatest advances in wool textile machinery of the century.<br>
<br>Inventive success did not bring Raper riches, and he complained that the bulk of his income went in taxes. It did, however, bring him considerable respect. In 1955 he was awarded the Hoffman Wood Yorkshire gold medal for invention and was made an honorary member of the Wool Industries Research Association. In 1960 he was made an honorary fellow of the Textile Institute. He was also an honorary lecturer in textile engineering at Leeds University. After leaving Bradford he lived at Masham, North Riding of Yorkshire, Windermere, and Ross-on-Wye. Raper was a rare example of a businessman who, from a managerial perspective, identified a technical opportunity and shifted from management to engineering in order to seize that opportunity. At the time of his death he was working on an automated weaving device. He died on 7 September 1973 at Verlands, Llangarron, Ross-on-Wye, Herefordshire. He was survived by his wife and three children.<br>
