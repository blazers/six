<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Marriage <span class="st"> [<em>married name </em>Garrett]</span>,  Ellen</span>  (1865&#150;1946), <span class="occ">translator</span>, was born on 23 August 1865 at Laboratory Yard, Stratford, Essex, the eldest of the four children of James Haworth Marriage (1839&#150;1913), confectionery manufacturer, and his wife, Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Brookfield (1835&#150;1899). She spent her early life in George Lane, South Woodford. The family had Quaker roots, and accordingly all four children were sent to Quaker schools, the son, Ernest, to Sidcot in Somerset, Ellen and her sisters, Caroline and Elizabeth, to The Mount in York. Ellen's stay there lasted from January 1880 to June 1883; she retained fond memories of the place, but it was Elizabeth who achieved the greatest academic success, proceeding in 1893 to Newnham College and thence to scholarly research into German folksong. Ellen became a (reluctant) office-worker: &#145;The invoice clerk&#151;that is me&#151;had such piles of invoices to make that he could do nothing else&#151;none of his other work.&#146; The &#145;other work&#146; included wide reading in English and French and experiments with writing: &#145;Don't you like to draw sketches and to find the best words &hellip; to give the effect you mean and search after? I have hundreds, almost, now&#146;  (Ellen Marriage to Elizabeth Marriage, 20 April 1889, priv. coll.).<br>
<br>It was the literary scholar A. R. Waller, a friend and neighbour of the Marriages, who suggested Ellen Marriage as translator when he put forward the idea of a complete edition of Balzac's <span class="italic">Com&eacute;die humaine</span> to the publisher J. M. Dent. Up to this time no complete edition had been published in England, although a few novels had appeared singly since the 1850s and a complete edition was coming out in America between 1885 and 1896. (Strictly speaking, neither edition was truly &#145;complete&#146;, as both omitted the most &#145;shocking&#146; works, <span class="italic">La physiologie du mariage</span>, <span class="italic">Sarrasine</span>, <span class="italic">La fille aux yeux d'or</span>, <span class="italic">Une passion dans le d&eacute;sert</span>, and <span class="italic">Petites mis&egrave;res de la vie conjugale</span>.) Under George Saintsbury's editorship, all forty volumes were completed between 1895 and 1898, an immense task for which Marriage eventually had to be assisted by Clara Bell. In addition one volume was translated by Rachel Scott and several by a &#145;James Waring&#146;. However, this was apparently a pseudonym: according to Frank Swinnerton, who worked in Dent's office in the 1900s, Waring was &#145;none other than Ellen Marriage working under a masculine name [for the bolder works]. Whether this prudishness was Dent's or the translator's I do not know&#146;  (<span class="italic">Background</span>, 68). Swinnerton's evidence was only hearsay, but the styles of Ellen Marriage and James Waring are certainly similar.<br>
<br>Of the forty volumes of the Dent edition of the <span class="italic">Com&eacute;die humaine</span>, several containing more than one work, Marriage translated nineteen and James Waring seven. Marriage took far greater trouble over them than was then common with translations of French novels, not only searching for &#145;the best words&#146; but visiting France to check local details and grappling manfully with Balzac's specialized vocabularies: &#145;I have some heraldry that has fairly beaten me. There seems nothing left but the desperate step&#151;a lunatic's step&#151;of going to the College of Arms and trying what impudence will do&#146;  (Ellen Marriage to Elizabeth Marriage, 3 Jan 1896, priv. coll.). The results were justifiably admired; her versions, particularly the descriptions and narration, often have the &#145;colour and swing&#146; she admired in other writers and usually avoid the unnatural literalness that had characterized many earlier versions. Dent incorporated several of the novels into his <span class="roman">Everyman's Library</span>, begun in 1906, and many long remained in print. Financially they were less rewarding; at the height of her career Marriage was receiving &#145;&pound;3 to &pound;4&#146; for what she could translate in a week.<br>
<br>The prolonged effort and isolation of the Balzac translations exhausted Marriage; she confided to her sister Elizabeth that she did not want to become involved in such a project again. She published only three further translations: Henri Murger's <span class="italic">Sc&egrave;nes de la vie de boh&egrave;me</span> in 1901 and Marcel Pr&eacute;vost's <span class="italic">Fr&eacute;d&eacute;rique</span> (1900) and <span class="italic">L&eacute;a</span> (1902). In 1901 she was admitted to Nayland Sanatorium in Suffolk, suffering from neurasthenia. During her seven-month stay she met the journalist <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/33336/', "(Fydell) Edmund Garrett (1865&#150;1907)")</script>, whose terminal tuberculosis had brought him to Nayland. As they lay on adjacent &#145;long chairs&#146; they discovered common interests in life and literature; they were married on 26 March 1903 and took up residence first in Windy Park, St Ives, and later in a cottage at Wiverton Acre near Plympton, Devon. After Garrett's death Ellen moved back to the south-east, where she &#145;collected and arranged&#146; his translation of <span class="italic">Lyrics and Poems from Ibsen</span> and revised the translation of <span class="italic">Brand</span> he had published in 1894; the whole was published by Dent in 1912.<br>
<br>For a period from 1910 Ellen Garrett took an interest in the suffragist activities of her husband's cousins Millicent Garrett Fawcett and Elizabeth Garrett Anderson, and worked with <span class="italic">Common Cause</span>, the suffragist newspaper. Her journalistic contacts proved useful from the First World War onwards, when she contributed articles, usually anonymously, to various journals, including the <span class="italic">Manchester Guardian</span>, the <span class="italic">Westminster Gazette</span>, and <span class="italic">The Observer</span>. Several of these were on political or social aspects of Bulgaria; in 1904 her sister Elizabeth had married Constantin Mincoff, a Bulgarian diplomat. For most of the 1920s Ellen lived in Elgin Crescent, Notting Hill, moving in the early 1930s to The Folley in Wells Road, Malvern. She died on 23 December 1946 at South Grove, Abbey Road, Malvern, Worcestershire, of heart failure.<br>
