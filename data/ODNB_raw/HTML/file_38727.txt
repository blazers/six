<span class="headword">Lushington, Sir  Godfrey</span>  (1832&#150;1907), <span class="occ">civil servant</span>, was born at Westminster on 8 March 1832, the fifth son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17213/', "Stephen Lushington (1782&#150;1873)")</script>, Admiralty judge and MP, and his wife, Sarah Grace Carr (<i>d</i>. 1837). He had four brothers, including a twin, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/53968/', "Vernon Lushington")</script>, and five sisters, two of whom, Alice and Fanny, later ran a school. His was a whig&#150;Liberal family, strongly represented at the bar and in the public service.<br>
<br>Educated at Rugby School, Lushington entered Balliol College, Oxford, in 1850, where he obtained a first in <i>literae humaniores</i> and a fourth in mathematics (1854). He was president of the Oxford Union Society in 1854. Elected, as his father had been, to a fellowship of All Souls College (1854) Lushington, as a young turk in sympathy with the Oxford University reform movement, embarrassed many of the older fellows of the college by challenging the restrictive basis on which college fellowships were awarded. With two other former Balliol men, W. H. Fremantle and A. G. Watson, he took the case to the college visitor in 1859 and then to the court of queen's bench, before finally carrying the point in 1864. In 1858 he had been called to the bar at the Inner Temple.<br>
<br>Lushington's reforming instincts were encouraged by his participation in Richard Congreve's Oxford coterie of followers of Auguste Comte, which included E. S. Beesly, J. H. Bridges, and Frederic Harrison. One of the earliest English converts to the religion of humanity, he wrote for the Positivist Society, to which he gave extensive financial support, in the 1860s and 1870s. He was latterly regarded by other positivists as a conservative figure, and he withdrew his subscription from the London Positivist Society in 1899 following a breach over the Dreyfus affair, on which Lushington had written at length in <span class="italic">The Times</span>.<br>
<br>One of the earliest teachers at the Working Men's College in London, founded in 1854, Lushington provided help for the embryonic labour movement as it struggled to make its case. He was a member of the Social Science Association's committee on trade societies and strikes, whose influential report was published in 1860. He contributed an essay, &#145;Workmen and trade unions&#146;, to the 1867 manifesto of academic liberalism, <span class="italic">Questions for a Reformed Parliament</span>. Sharing his father's abhorrence of slavery, he was a member of the Emancipation Society, which in 1862 backed the North in the American Civil War. Always ready to challenge misguided authority, he was an active member of the Jamaica committee, established in 1866 to prosecute Governor Eyre for his handling of the Morant Bay rebellion; in 1867, using his expertise in prize law, he attacked what he perceived as the bullying of Spain in the case of the cargo ship <i>Tornado</i>.<br>
<br>On 3 June 1865 Lushington married Beatrice Anne Shore, daughter of Samuel Smith of Combe House, Surrey, and sister-in-law of A. H. Clough. They had no children. Between 1866 and 1869 he was secretary to the pollution of rivers commission and the digest of the law commission, and in 1868 unsuccessfully stood as Liberal candidate for Abingdon. In 1869 he was appointed by H. A. Bruce legal adviser at the Home Office. In 1876 he became legal assistant under-secretary and in 1885 permanent under-secretary.<br>
<br>Lushington's legal expertise, zealous application, and high-mindedness made him an ideal support for successive home secretaries. His balanced advice during the preparation of legislation was set out in detailed, closely argued memoranda, written in a tiny, regular hand. His masters found the resource of what H. H. Asquith called &#145;a subtle and many-sided mind, and of a wide and generous culture&#146;  (letter to Henry Cunynghame, 3 Jan 1895, TNA: PRO, HO 45/9892/B17626/26) invaluable during a turbulent period when poverty, unemployment, and a lack of effective management within the Metropolitan Police exposed successive governments to major public-order crises in the capital and raised key issues about freedom of speech and of association. Despite this invaluable support Lord Salisbury's suspicion of his former &#145;socialist&#146; leanings blocked several strong recommendations from Henry Matthews (home secretary 1886&#150;92) for Lushington to be awarded the customary honours. He was finally made KCB in 1892 and GCMG in 1899.<br>
<br>Yet, reformer that he was in his youth, Lushington did not always take advantage of the process of change inspired by Northcote and Trevelyan that swept through the civil service after 1870. While able young officials, recruited through open competition, were on their way up the hierarchy, Lushington found it difficult to delegate work and was against promoting them over the heads of their pedestrian seniors. A much-needed shake-up in the administration of factory and mining legislation was prevented by Lushington's conservative emphasis on the law and order aspect of the work, and led to a crisis in Home Office administration in the early 1890s.<br>
<br>Lushington's retirement from the Home Office in 1895 provoked exceptionally warm tributes, especially from his Home Office colleagues who had appreciated Lushington's personal kindness and well understood that a certain austerity and lack of bonhomie were part of his impeccable standards and high moral principle. He thereafter took an active part in public life, serving as an alderman of the London county council until 1898. In 1903 he was appointed a member of the royal commission on trade disputes. Lushington died unexpectedly on 5 February 1907 at his London home, 34 Old Queen Street, Westminster, and was buried at St Katharine's Church, Savernake Forest. His wife survived him.<br>
