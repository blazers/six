<span class="headword">Ballard,  Stephen</span>  (1804&#150;1890), <span class="occ">civil engineer</span>, was born at Ivy House, Malvern, Worcestershire, on 5 April 1804, the son of Philip Ballard (<i>d</i>. 1845), attorney, and his wife, Charlotte, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Bayliss (<i>d</i>. 1846). His father had been bankrupted by a libel suit, and to help support the family his mother took in lodgers, one of whom, the marchioness of Donegal, provided Stephen with useful connections. He spent some years learning the horticultural trade with the firm of Lee and Kennedy in Hammersmith before taking an apprenticeship with the Cheltenham builder Henry Lucy.<br>
<br>Through a contact with the Biddulph family of Ledbury, whose members included the MP for Hereford, Ballard was employed by the Gloucester and Hereford Canal Company first as its clerk and then its engineer. The canal project was stalled at docks on the outskirts of Ledbury, but he brought fresh enthusiasm to the undertaking, resurveying the remaining course of the canal, and securing a new act of parliament. The canal's final eighteen miles into Hereford were completed in 1845. This was followed by another waterway project, as resident engineer on the middle level main drain (1844) for land drainage in the East Anglian fens. Elected an associate of the Institution of Civil Engineers in 1837, he was transferred to membership of the institution in 1846, having contributed papers to the minutes of its proceedings and been awarded its Telford medal in 1842.<br>
<br>Ballard's experience of the fens led to his employment by the railway builder Thomas Brassey on the construction of the Great Northern line between Biggleswade and Peterborough where, to stabilize the fugitive subsoil, he made innovative use of brushwood stacks to displace underlying water. After a few months of railway survey work in India in 1851 he was again taken on by Brassey in 1852 to help with the construction of the Danish Rhenish Railway which, between Utrecht and Rotterdam, also involved construction over peat. His next job was as a contractor for Brassey on the Worcester and Hereford Railway. Tunnelling through the very hard rock of the Malvern Hills was a major feat for which he used a steam drill. One of the lasting achievements of this line is the Ledbury viaduct, thirty-one arches long with elegant tapering brick piers 19 metres high. Finished on 12 June 1861, it required some five million bricks, which were made on site by his brother.<br>
<br>Ballard's final undertakings were on the Ashchurch and Evesham Railway (1862), the Evesham and Redditch (1864) and the Bedford to London extension of the Midland Railway (1865). In 1854, aged fifty, he married Maria Bird (<i>c</i>.1829&#150;1911), and with characteristic energy fathered eight children, of whom the youngest was the horticulturist <a href="#cosubject_98276">Ernest Ballard [<i>see below</i>]</a>. Settled at The Winnings, Colwall, over the route of the Malvern tunnel, he established a fruit farm and later a successful cider vinegar making works. He was involved in the construction of Jubilee Drive, a route round the side of the Malvern Hills. To curb squatter encroachment on the hills he helped to secure the creation in 1884 of the Malvern Hills board of conservators. Though not formally religious, he was a man of natural piety; he had strong humanitarian interests, objecting to capital punishment, and was a benevolent employer, concerned for the welfare of his navvies. Perhaps in reaction to his father's weakness for the bottle he was a lifelong teetotaller. He died on 14 November 1890 at The Winnings, Colwall, and was buried on his estate in a spoil mound excavated from the air-shafts of his tunnels. He left extensive diaries, written in a shorthand, and notebooks in which he recorded extensive observations of nature. His nephew Robert Ballard (1839&#150;1912) trained as a civil engineer under him and went on to undertake several important railway construction projects in Australia. Another nephew, Thomas Ballard (1836&#150;1908), was a successful genre painter.<br>
<br>The youngest of Stephen Ballard's eight children, <a name="cosubject_98276"></a><span class="headword">Ernest Ballard</span>  (1870&#150;1952), <span class="occ">horticulturist</span>, was born at The Winnings, Colwall, Herefordshire, on 2 May 1870, and briefly attended Malvern College (1885&#150;6) before being sent to Mason College, Birmingham, during 1887&#150;9 to study chemistry in preparation for a position in the family business, where he returned to work as a chemist and was engaged in commercial vinegar production for twenty-five years. On 3 October 1899 he married his first cousin once removed, Ella (<i>b</i>. 1870), daughter of Roger de Quincey, East India merchant. They had three daughters and a son. After her death he married later in life Marie Bland (<i>d</i>. 1973).<br>
<br>Ernest Ballard brought his scientific training to bear on his hobby, gardening, and became noted as a breeder of Michaelmas daisies, autumn-flowering hardy perennials that he considered had been unduly neglected by hybridizers. He was the first breeder to identify and then achieve the potential of the existing varieties of <i>Aster novi-belgii</i> (Michaelmas daisy) to produce a wide range of colours. In 1906 he started his own nursery, enjoying early success with a double flowered plant, Beauty of Colwall, which was awarded a first-class certificate in the Royal Horticultural Society's aster trials of 1907, the only plant out of 300 aster cultivars to receive the award. In further aster hybrid trials he strove to develop a compact form, bigger double-rayed flowers of strong, bright colours and a stem some 2&frac12; or 3 feet long.<br>
<br>As early as 1912 Ballard advertised the potential of Michaelmas daisies as an adornment to autumn gardens, valuable for their &#145;hardiness, ease of culture, variety of colour, habit and wild profusion of bloom&#146;  (<span class="italic">Gardeners' Magazine</span>, 14 Dec 1912, 952), and during the First World War began to make his hybrids commercially available from his Old Court Nursery in Colwall. Over subsequent decades his varieties were always ahead of his rivals in their new shades of colour, flower size, and other characteristics. His habit was to name cultivars after family members: Marie Ballard, named after his second wife, had a double flower of dark lavender, the closest he achieved to the strong blue he particularly sought.<br>
<br>Ballard's interests also included the alpine family and in pursuit of new varieties he travelled widely through the Alps, the Caucasus, and frequently to Corsica. In 1916 he bred a noted hybrid between two European species of hepatica he had collected which he called <i>Hepatica x media Ballardii</i>. This, with its large, velvety, ice-blue flower, was a great success and a Royal Horticultural Society prizewinner. He hybridized new strains of ramonda (<i>R. myconis</i> for instance) and haberleas. He also experimented with varieties of aubrietias, iberis, hellebores, fritillaria, nerines, and cyclamen. He had success improving <i>Echinacea (rudbeckia) purpurea</i> (the coneflower), producing a variety whose petals stood out more firmly called &#145;The King&#146;.<br>
<br>A familiar figure at the Royal Horticultural Society's autumn shows, where more than half of his ninety new varieties of Michaelmas daisies received awards of merit, Ballard was given in 1949 the Society's highest award, the Victoria medal of honour. Like his father he was an inveterate note taker, occasionally gathering his thoughts into books, such as <span class="italic">Days in My Garden</span> (1919). His nursery became neglected as a result of manpower shortages in the Second World War, but it revived after the recruitment of Percy Picton as head gardener. Ballard moved to the nearby village of Staplow, Herefordshire, where he died at The Cottage on 30 March 1952. His speciality of flowering asters is maintained at the Old Court Nursery, which now holds a national collection of Michaelmas daisies.<br>
<br>Ernest Ballard's daughter-in-law <a name="cosubject_98277"></a><span class="headword">(Grace) Helen Ballard</span>  (1908&#150;1995) was herself a <span class="occ">horticulturist</span> of note. Born at Culverwood, Waldron, Sussex, on 11 January 1908, the daughter of Arthur William Ranken, electrical engineer, and his wife, Sarah Kate, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Phillips, she married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/31845/', "Peter Cecil Wilson")</script>, art dealer, on 10 January 1935; they had two sons. Following their divorce in 1951 she married in that year Ernest Ballard's son, Philip Ernest Ballard (1909&#150;1987). Her special interest in hybridizing hellebores was said to have originated from her father-in-law's gift of four <i>Helleborus orientalis</i> plants, two reds and two whites, which she planted in the famous shady north border on her farm at Mathon under the Malverns in Worcestershire. The results started her off on the work of the last thirty years of her life. Her vision was of large, bowl shaped, outward and upward looking flowers on a stem that would hold the flower clear of the foliage, with pure, strong colours. She was indefatigable, travelling in the Caucasus and around Europe for native specimens of the <i>orientalis</i> type. She found new pure colours: a yellow from <i>H. odorous</i>, dark purples from <i>H. torquatus</i>, and greys and purples from <i>H. purpurascens</i>. She hybridized with as large a gene pool as possible to retain vigour, and tackled the problem that hybridized change in hellebores is notoriously hard to stabilize. Her interest in <i>H. niger</i> (the Christmas rose) led to a large flowered strain, and many crosses with <i>H. lividus</i> and <i>H. argutifolius</i>. After her husband's death she lived at Mathon with a companion, Joan Bridges, until her death, at the St Cloud Nursing Home, Callow End, Worcester, on 28 May 1995.<br>
