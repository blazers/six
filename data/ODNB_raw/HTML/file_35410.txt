</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Paton,  John Brown</span>  (1830&#150;1911), <span class="occ">Congregational minister and philanthropist</span>, the eldest of the eight children of Alexander Paton, a shopkeeper, and his wife, Mary, daughter of Andrew Brown of Newmilns, Ayrshire, was born on 17 December 1830 at Galston, Ayrshire. On his father's side he was descended from the covenanter John Paton (<i>d</i>. 1684). Both his parents, who were brought up in distinct seceding bodies (Burgher and Anti-Burgher), now belonged to the United Secession church at Newmilns. His father, on account of his sympathy with the more liberal theology of James Morison, joined the Congregationalists when the family moved to Glasgow in 1846. From Loudoun parish school Paton passed in 1838 to the tuition of his maternal uncle, Andrew Morton Brown, Congregational minister at Poole. In 1844 he worked for ten months in the printing office of the <span class="italic">Kilmarnock Herald</span>, of which Alexander Russel was editor. He then moved to Cheltenham where Andrew Brown was now minister, and there met the Congregational minister and writer Henry Rogers (1806&#150;1877), who persuaded him to seek a career in the Christian ministry.<br>
<br>In October 1846 Paton was admitted to Spring Hill College, Birmingham, in which Rogers held the chair of literature and philosophy. With his fellow student, Robert William Dale (1829&#150;1895), later of Carr's Lane, Birmingham, he formed a close and lifelong friendship. The pulsating civil, political, and cultural life of Birmingham left a lasting impression on the mind of young Paton. He became convinced that Christianity could not be divorced from the social and economic problems of the day. He also attended (from 1850) the ministry of Robert Alfred Vaughan, to whose &#145;intense spirituality&#146; he owed much. During his college course he graduated BA from London University in 1849, gaining the Hebrew and New Testament prize in 1850 and a divinity scholarship in 1852 on the foundation of Daniel Williams (1643?&#150;1716). In 1854 he won a double MA at London University in philosophy (with gold medal) and classics, the first to achieve such a distinction.<br>
<br>Paton left college in June 1854 and in October took charge of a mission in Wicker, a parish in the northern part of Sheffield. He was ordained there in July 1855. His ministry was eminently successful: the Wicker Congregational Church was built in 1855; in addition, the congregation in Garden Street Chapel, Sheffield, was revived. On 14 September 1859 Paton married Jessie, the daughter of William P. Paton of Glasgow. In 1861 Joseph Parker established Cavendish College, Manchester, for the training of candidates for the Congregational ministry; Paton travelled there weekly from Sheffield to teach theology and philosophy. In 1863 the institution was transferred to Nottingham as the Congregational Institute, and Paton was appointed its first principal on 10 September 1863. Temporary premises were exchanged for a permanent building in 1868, and the institute's reputation increased over the thirty-five years of Paton's headship. In his management of young men he was an ideal head; no feature of his teaching was more marked than the skill and judgement with which he conducted the work of sermon making and delivery.<br>
<br>Although a gifted teacher and a man of deep personal piety, Paton was above all a social crusader. He was a pioneer in seeking to embody Christian principles in practical schemes for social improvement. The Congregational Institute itself was created to enable men with no academic qualifications to be trained to serve rural churches, to be missionaries in the slums of the great cities, and to work aggressively among the poor. The lack of educational opportunities for workers led Paton in October 1873 to initiate lectures for working men, a scheme that contributed to the establishment of the University College of Nottingham in 1877 and provided the University of Cambridge with the inspiration to prepare courses of extension lectures. It was the need for effective technical education that influenced Paton to establish the Trades Council of Learning in 1880. In order to enrich people's literary culture he founded the National Home Reading Union on 13 April 1889. He evinced his concern for young people by creating the Boys' Life Brigade in 1900 and the Girls' Life Brigade in 1903, followed by the (unsuccessful) League of Honour in 1906.<br>
<br>In September 1873 Paton first expressed his conviction that the German Inner Mission, initiated in 1848 by J. H. Wichern of Hamburg, could provide a model for Christians of all persuasions in Britain to join together in applying the spirit of Christianity to the amelioration of social ills. This vision of Christian ecumenical co-operation provided the agenda for his subsequent career. He created social institutes to occupy the leisure time of workers and arranged holidays for them under the auspices of the Co-operative Holiday Association, established in 1892. In August 1893 he founded the English Land Colonisation Society, followed in 1894 by the Christian Social Union, which in 1895 established the first &#145;Colony of Mercy&#146; at Lingfield, Surrey. The activities promoted by these organizations were intended to retrain the unemployed and to prove that those with acute physical disabilities had a creative role to play in industry.<br>
<br>Paton, in conjunction with Dale, edited the <span class="italic">Eclectic Review</span> during 1858&#150;62. With his colleague F. S. Williams he edited the <span class="roman">Home Mission and Tract Series</span> in 1865, and he was a consulting editor during 1882&#150;7 of the <span class="italic">Contemporary Review</span>. Paton was also a prolific author. His interest in promoting Christian brotherhood is evident in his <span class="italic">The Two-Fold Alternative</span> (1889), and his distaste for interpreting the ministry as a priesthood is expressed not only in this book but also in <span class="italic">The Origin of the Priesthood</span> (1877). His profound concern for social improvement may be seen in his six-volume collection, <span class="italic">Social Questions of the Day</span> (1906).<br>
<br>In 1882 Paton was made DD of Glasgow University. On his retirement his portrait, commissioned by a committee headed by Frederick Temple, archbishop of Canterbury, was presented on 26 October 1898 by John Percival, bishop of Hereford, to the city of Nottingham. Paton died at his home, 22 Forest Road, Nottingham, on 26 January 1911. The funeral service was held at Castle Gate church, and the burial service at the general cemetery was conducted by his friends John Percival and Henry R. Wakefield, dean of Norwich and later bishop of Birmingham. Paton was survived by three sons and two daughters. A son, William, was drowned at Barmouth on 1 August 1894, and an invalid daughter, Jessie Muriel, had died in May 1910. His son <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35412/', "John Lewis Paton (1863&#150;1946)")</script> ended a distinguished career in education as president of Memorial College, St John's, Newfoundland, from 1925 to 1933.<br>
<br>Paton's activities had an intense and widespread influence on late Victorian life. His innumerable personal contacts crossed denominational divides and international boundaries (he was the first protestant in England to promote understanding with the Old Catholics after their exclusion from the Roman Catholic church). During his last years he was busily engaged in promoting evangelism in Scotland and in bringing practical help to Christians in China after the Boxer uprising. All in all Paton was one of the outstanding Christian leaders in Britain at the turn of the century.<br>
