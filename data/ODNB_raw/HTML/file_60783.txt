<span class="headword">Holt <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Wiseman]</span>,  Jane</span>  (<em>fl. </em><em>c.</em>1682&#150;1717), <span class="occ">playwright and poet</span>, is of obscure origins, though her maiden name appears to have been Wiseman. The prompter John Downes notes that a &#145;Mrs. Wiseman&#146; inherited the part of Roxolana in the earl of Orrery's tragedy <span class="italic">Mustapha</span> from Mary Betterton some time after 1665  (Downes, 26), and this may have been the writer. A &#145;Mrs. Wiseman&#146; was listed as a member of the Duke's Company about the time of the union of theatrical companies in 1682, and the United Company revived <span class="italic">Mustapha</span> in October 1686, though no cast list from this production has survived. Wiseman may indeed have acted the part in 1686 as Betterton had reduced her schedule in the mid-1680s.<br>
<br>The actress named Wiseman is probably the Jane Wiseman who appears late in 1701 when her play, <span class="italic">Antiochus the Great, or, The Fatal Relapse</span>, was acted at the New Theatre, Lincoln's Inn Fields. The exact date of the premi&egrave;re remains unknown, but the play was performed in the week of 11 November, and it was published on 25 November 1701 (but dated 1702). According to Giles Jacob, Wiseman worked as a servant in the family of William Wright, recorder of Oxford, before her success with <span class="italic">Antiochus</span>. In Wright's household she read novels and plays from his library which apparently sparked her first attempt at composition  (Jacob, 301). In the dedication to John, Lord Jeffries, Wiseman provides only a general hint that <span class="italic">Antiochus</span> is the product of a self-taught, labouring-class type as she describes her work as &#145;the first Fruits of a Muse, not yet debas'd to the Low Imployment of Scandal or Private Reflection&#146;. Some time after the success of <span class="italic">Antiochus</span>, according to Jacob, Wiseman married &#145;a young Vintner&#146; named Holt and retired from the stage, using the profits from her play to open a tavern in Westminster with her husband  (ibid.).<br>
<br>In 1717 a &#145;Mrs Holt&#146; published a short book of verse titled <span class="italic">A Fairy Tale Inscrib'd, to the Honourable Mrs. W&#151;, with other Poems</span>. The many detailed references to the Restoration stage and to fellow playwrights among the verses serve to connect the poet Holt to the actress-playwright Wiseman. The author is more explicit about her humble origins, referring to herself as &#145;the meanest of the Muses Train&#146; and describing her poetic efforts as &#145;artless Song&#146;  (<span class="italic">Fairy Tale</span>, 26). But there are several accomplished poems in this volume, and Holt also presents herself, perhaps imaginatively, as a retiring country type, content with a &#145;few choice books&#146; and her female &#145;Friends&#146;, far removed from the strife of London. No details of Holt's death and burial appear to have survived.<br>
