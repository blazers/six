<span class="headword">Beconsall,  Thomas</span>  (1663/4&#150;1709), <span class="occ">philosopher and Church of England clergyman</span>, was the son of John Beconsall of Lemster, Cheshire. He matriculated, aged sixteen, on 30 March 1680, at Brasenose College, Oxford. He graduated BA in 1683, MA in 1686 (in which year he became a fellow), and BD in 1697. He was vicar of Steeple Aston in Oxfordshire from 1706 until his death.<br>
<br>Beconsall is significant as a critic of the philosopher John Locke, against whom he published a sermon and a treatise. <span class="italic">The Doctrine of a General Resurrection</span>, preached in the university church, Oxford, on Easter Monday 1697, assailed the theory of personal identity in Locke's <span class="italic">Essay Concerning Human Understanding</span>. In Locke's location of personal identity &#145;purely in consciousness&#146; he found a kind of Platonism that denied that the body is integral to the self. Beconsall quickly equated this with a Socinian rejection of the Christian doctrine of bodily resurrection. He concluded that heresy lurked in Locke.<br>
<br>Much more important is Beconsall's <span class="italic">The Grounds and Foundations of Natural Religion</span> (1698) which contains, in its eleventh chapter, the first published critique, indeed one of the earliest mentions, of Locke's <span class="italic">Two Treatises of Government</span> (1689). Interestingly Beconsall analysed the <span class="italic">Treatises</span> and the <span class="italic">Essay</span> together, subsuming Locke's politics under his moral philosophy. Beconsall was conventional in his ethical sentiments and tory in his politics, but he provided a perceptive account of Locke. Thomas Hearne rightly described the book as &#145;a discourse about the law of nature&#146;  (<span class="italic">Remarks</span>, 1.231). It defended natural law and innate moral knowledge against &#145;the modern scepticks and latitudinarians&#146;  (Beconsall, title-page). Beconsall charged Locke with destroying natural law by his attack on innatism; with reducing moral knowledge to opinion, fashion, and custom; with making &#145;consciousness and conscience the same&#146;  (ibid., 249), thereby destroying conscience properly understood; and with undermining revealed religion as being mere priestcraft.<br>
<br>Beconsall next urged that parental and filial duties were cardinal branches of natural law. No moral obligations more certainly &#145;carry the appearance of being innate&#146;  (Beconsall, 126). Yet Locke destroyed these duties. Beconsall takes the <span class="italic">Two Treatises</span> to be pre-eminently a critique of patriarchalism, and he correspondingly defends the &#145;empire&#146; and &#145;dominion&#146; which men have as fathers, husbands, and originally as kings and priests. He thinks Locke an incipient feminist for elevating &#145;the mother as an equal sharer in that power which accrues to the father as a parent&#146;  (ibid., 143). All this sounds like Sir Robert Filmer's divine right theory of monarchy, which had shored up the house of Stuart. But Beconsall flatly denied any &#145;disloyalty towards our present sovereign&#146;  (ibid., 181), and this seems ingenuous, for the Jacobite Hearne irritably called him &#145;an admirer of King William&#146;  (<span class="italic">Remains</span>, 1.231). Beconsall shows the beginnings of the repositioning of post-revolution toryism, which made possible the persistence of patriarchal moral and political theory for another century, but by then no longer encumbered with the special claims of the Stuart cause.<br>
<br>What is strikingly original in Beconsall's critique of Locke is that he identifies the Lockean state of nature and original contract not as a mythic history about primeval origins but as a juridical fact about present-day societies. On Beconsall's reading, for Locke political legitimacy is constantly re-created by every generation of citizens as it comes of age. Hence the crux of Locke's theory is taken to be the repudiation of filial obligation at the age of majority. He explores Locke's well-known paragraphs about what constitutes express and tacit consent, and shows how precarious Lockean political obligation is, since oaths of allegiance and inheritance of property apply to only a fraction of the population. It is a theory that quickly leads to the &#145;total dissolution&#146; of government. Beconsall also dwells on Locke's passage about a person's right of withdrawal to other commonwealths or to empty places, &#145;<i>vacuis locis</i>&#146;  (Beconsall, 171). Here he takes Locke seriously as a proponent of untrammelled emigration. Hence the Lockean dissolution of government is seen less as a theory of rebellion than as a theory about the right of withdrawal. This construal would be fundamental to American readings of the <i>vacuis locis</i> passage in the 1760s, but Beconsall deprecates it in the light of mercantilist concerns about the nation's demographic, and hence economic and military, strength. By Locke's dangerous principle, &#145;a nation may be dispeopled at pleasure, and consequently drained of her riches and treasure&#146;  (ibid., 178), and exposed to her enemies. Beconsall rounds off with a personal attack on Locke, by then a member of the Board of Trade, as a hypocritical salaried functionary of a mercantilist state bureaucracy.<br>
<br>On 23 June 1709 Hearne reported that Beconsall died &#145;last week at his parsonage suddenly, having been for a great while in a melancholy, hippish condition&#146;; he had earlier described him as &#145;a strange hypochondriacal person&#146;  (<span class="italic">Remarks</span>, 1.231, 2.213&#150;14). By his will dated 2 May 1709 Beconsall left money to his wife, Anne, and his two sisters; there is no mention of children. An inventory valued his chattels and moneys at &pound;297 11<i>s</i>., the largest items of value being glebe corn, books in the study, and moneys owed by Brasenose.<br>
