<span class="headword">Hamilton <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Nanco]</span>,  Marguerite Alberta Cora <span class="st"> [Rita]</span></span>  (1907&#150;1982), <span class="occ">Hispanic scholar</span>, was born of Anglo-French parentage in Port of Spain, Trinidad, on 11 June 1907. Her father, Robert John Nanco, was a barrister. She was educated in Trinidad to school certificate level; she then became a boarder at Notre Dame Girls' School in Clapham, London, where she gained the University of London general schools certificate, with distinction in French. In 1925 she was admitted to King's College, London, to read Spanish (with French subsidiary). She graduated with an upper second in Spanish in 1928 and a teachers' diploma in 1929. Her mentor, Janet Perry, encouraged her to begin an MA thesis on Juan de Vald&eacute;s, which however remained unfinished. Rita Nanco went on to read French medieval literature at the Institut Fran&ccedil;ais in London, where she obtained the <i>licence &egrave;s lettres</i> (Lille), soon afterwards joining Miss Perry in the work of Westminster Tutors from 1934. On 13 July 1935 she married a barrister and professional transfer agent, Albert Cosmo Hamilton (1910&#150;1999), at St Mary's Roman Catholic Church, Clapham. There were no children of the marriage.<br>
<br>Rita Hamilton had the exceptional ability of becoming entirely trilingual in spoken and written English, French, and Spanish, skills that were put to good use in 1941 when, alongside her close friend Marjorie Grice-Hutchinson, later a distinguished economist, she began to undertake the vetting of recruits and other work for the Foreign Office, which continued after the war, when she always travelled abroad on a British diplomatic passport. At the same time she was giving evening classes at Birkbeck College for the remnant of the King's College Spanish department after the main part of the college had been evacuated to the University of Bristol in 1940. When it was reinstalled in the Strand in 1944, by which time she was estranged from her husband, she was appointed assistant in Spanish; she was promoted to assistant lecturer in 1949, lecturer in 1952, and senior lecturer in 1959. She was allotted more and more teaching in the growing honours school, while continuing to teach the subsidiary Spanish classes, and she became solely responsible for developing the medieval literature course.<br>
<br>Mrs Hamilton (as she was known) was a firm believer in introducing undergraduates to detailed textual study of the <span class="italic">Poema de mio Cid</span> (which she helped Janet Perry to translate into English) and Juan Ruiz's <span class="italic">Libro de buen amor</span> in the first week of their university course. She taught with such intensity and enthusiasm that she inspired many of her students with a desire to undertake research at an early stage in their career. Rarely did she use written-out texts for her lectures, relying almost always on a few notes and the texts in front of the class, and frequently she did not complete her sentences, allowing her voice to rise dramatically to the point where her students felt they could complete them from their own newly acquired insights. It was indeed the art of a great teacher: to give the pupils the impression of making important discoveries and to leave the subject open-ended, with much still to be pursued. Ten of the twenty-four contributors to the Festschrift presented to her in 1976 had been her undergraduate or graduate students, and five of them had become university teachers of medieval literature, taking with them her methods and ideas.<br>
<br>Hamilton's commitment to her teaching, her department, her college, and her university meant that she had little time to complete her own research, though she published articles of quality on Juan de Vald&eacute;s, the <span class="italic">Poema de mio Cid</span>, and the <span class="italic">Libro de buen amor</span>, and brought out a revised version of the <span class="italic">Cid</span> translation in the Manchester bilingual series in 1975 (as <span class="italic">The Poem of the Cid</span>), which reappeared in <span class="roman">Penguin Classics</span> in 1984 and was frequently reprinted.<br>
<br>Tall and charming, with striking good looks, Hamilton was well known at academic conferences in Britain and abroad. She showed the utmost loyalty to five successive heads of department at King's and served on many committees. She had little taste for the cut and thrust of academic politics, though together with her colleague Rosalind Franklin she succeeded in the mid-1950s in a campaign to have the membership of the previously all-male senior common room overlooking the Thames extended to women. She was happiest in her role as &#145;mother of the Spanish department&#146;. When she was suddenly afflicted by a stroke while lecturing in 1972, and was rushed to Westminster Hospital, she overcame its worst effects and insisted on returning to teach part-time in the session of 1973&#150;4, declaring to her colleagues that after almost fifty years' association with the college she &#145;wished to leave King's on her feet&#146;  (private information). She was made a fellow of King's College in 1973, and retired in 1974.<br>
<br>Hamilton's principal hobby was travelling in Spain and the Americas. When she joined a small group of medievalists to explore the Cidian routes in 1971 she proved to be an imperturbable voyager, and would stand entranced at important sites reading aloud from a battered copy of the <span class="italic">Poema</span> while her harassed colleagues pored over inadequate maps. She often lent her splendid contralto voice to amateur performances in King's College, and attended operas at Covent Garden whenever she could. She had a quick mind, adept at solving puzzles, which she exercised daily by completing <span class="italic">The Times</span> cryptic crossword during her short journey from Westminster Palace Gardens to the Aldwych. She once entered the Cutty Sark crossword competition and reached the semi-finals with ease, but her dislike of publicity led to her withdrawal from the final stages. Through her long connection with Westminster Tutors, for a time she regularly took tea at 10 Downing Street in order to brush up Mrs Attlee's spoken French for diplomatic visits. She became a close friend of Cardinal Heenan, and performed many charitable acts in secret; the spiritual and corporal works of mercy were for her to be carried out whenever the opportunity arose. She was devout in the best sense, and her devoutness was leavened by a keen, quite worldly, sense of humour. During the last years of her life she moved to the convent of the nuns of the Temple at 67 Holland Park, where she died of a ruptured aorta on 14 December 1982. After eight small bequests, including one to the Spanish department at King's College, London, she left the residue of her estate to the Catholic Crusade of Rescue, a Catholic adoption agency.<br>
