<span class="headword">Paynell,  Thomas</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1564?), <span class="occ">translator</span>, was a canon of Merton Priory, Surrey. In April 1538 Merton Priory was surrendered to the crown and Paynell received a pension of &pound;10. Wood says that Paynell, who was descended from an ancient Lincolnshire family, the Paynells or Paganells, was educated at St Mary's College, the Austin canons' college at Oxford, where Erasmus had been welcomed by Prior Richard Charnock in 1499. Paynell should probably be identified with Thomas Paynell, priest, born near Bothby Paynell in Lincolnshire, who in his will, dated 10 March 1559 and proved on 22 March 1564  (Emden, <span class="italic">Oxf.</span>, 438), in which he left his books to St John's College, Oxford, is described as rector of Cottingham, Yorkshire, a post to which he was presented on 24 October 1540. This Paynell in addition became rector of All Hallows, Honey Lane, London, on 31 August 1545. His predecessor there was Richard Benese, who like Thomas Paynell the translator was a canon of Merton. There is evidence that the rector of Cottingham had been educated in Paris  (Stevenson and Salter, 135). One of the books in St John's is inscribed &#145;Sum Paynelli, Anthonii Belashezi et amicorum&#146;  (ibid.). This points to an identity with a Thomas Paynell who accompanied Christopher Mount on a mission directed by Thomas Cromwell to the protestant princes of Germany since there is a familiar letter from Henry Malet priest to Dr Bellises, Cromwell's servant, passing on a commendation from Paynell to Bellises. Paynell, the translator, was chaplain to Henry VIII and orator to queens Mary and Elizabeth. He was an Erasmian who was able to accommodate himself to the successive Tudor regimes. He remained however loyal to Thomas More, associated his arms with those of the Throckmortons, and requested a traditional Catholic burial.<br>
<br>John Bale said of Paynell that if monkish superstitions had not got in his way he was a man born to help those around him as can be deduced from his writings  (Bale, <span class="italic">Cat.</span>, 754). In fact the most obviously useful of Paynell's works were written in the period when he was still an Austin canon. <span class="italic">The Regimen Sanitatis: this Boke Techynge al People to Governe them in Helthe</span> (1528) was a translation of the commentary of Arnald de Villanova on the poem of John de Mediolano which had been written for William of Normandy. A &#145;temperate and moderate diete prolongeth man's life&#146; is the keynote for a survey of the properties of all foods and drink, of remedies as &#145;for parbraykynge on the sea&#146; and of the psychology of illness. It has a clear analytical table of contents with careful instructions on how to locate a page. It was reprinted throughout the century and as late as 1634. The success of this book caused his publisher Thomas Berthelet to prompt Paynell to translate Ulrich von Hutten's <span class="italic">De morbo Gallico</span> (1533). The German religious reformer's book established <i>guaiacum</i> as the new cure for syphilis, attacked traditional religious remedies, such as pilgrimages, and professional doctors intent only on making money. It promoted simple cures and self-administered medicine. The core of the book is an onslaught on luxury. <span class="italic">A Muche Profitable Treatise Against the Pestilence</span> (1534) is a good general survey of the causes, preventions, and cures for plague. It includes affordable cures for the poor and readvertises Hutten's cure for syphilis. In his final year as a canon at Merton, Paynell wrote the preface for a work of his fellow canon Richard Benese. <span class="italic">This Boke Sheweth the Manner of Measurynge of All Manners of Lande</span> (1537?) was a timely book when so much land was changing hands, and an interesting one for a canon regular to write. Paynell in his preface argues that the mechanical arts such as carpentry and masonry are the basis of modern civilization; that God created the world &#145;by nombre, weyght and measure&#146;, and that geometry and astronomy are one.<br>
<br>Paynell's translation of Agapetus's advice to the emperor Justinian (<span class="italic">The Preceptes Teachyng a Prynce or a Noble Estate his Duetie</span>, 1532?) is addressed to William Blount, Lord Mountjoy, friend and tutor of King Henry and a man who helped bring Erasmus to England. The reader is told that &#145;he who knoweth himself shall knowe god, he that knoweth god shall be likened to god&#146;  (section 3); that the rich man suffers from his abundance as does the poor from his scarcity and so the rich must give to the poor  (section 15). In 1533, while still an Austin canon, Paynell translated Erasmus's <span class="italic">De contemptu mundi</span> with its conclusion that the monastic life can be lived outside the monastery, and in 1559 at the beginning of Elizabeth's reign Erasmus's <span class="italic">Complaint of Peace</span> with its emphasis on the rights of the common man.<br>
<br>Paynell's translation of Constantinus Felicius Duratinus's <span class="italic">Conspiracy of Catiline</span> (1541) carried a more authoritarian message. The translation converted what had been an exercise in Ciceronian Latin into popular history with contemporary colouring. The destruction of Catiline is Henry's God-given justification for punishment of his own rebels. This translation was republished in 1557 during Mary's reign with Alexander Barclay's translation of Sallust's history of Jugurtha which Paynell claimed to have corrected (but see Bennett, 132). This part of the work was dedicated to Lord Montague &#145;who hathe at all tymes, and against all the rabblement of heretyke sustained &hellip; the catholyke faith&#146;.<br>
<br>Traditional forms of religious text had been dedicated to Mary as princess by Paynell: <span class="italic">A Compendious and a Moche Fruytefull Treatyse of Well Livynge &hellip; written by S. Bernard</span>, published in 1545, and an anthology of carefully selected biblical passages, <span class="italic">The Piththy and most Notable Sayings of al Scripture</span>, published in 1550. In 1558 he offered her a translation of Cuthbert Tunstall's Latin prayers. Perhaps his most significant activity during Mary's reign was his indexing of the English works of Thomas More. The index reads like an attack on reformed religion: &#145;Apostles dyd institute to pray for the dead&#146;, &#145;Apostles sayd masse before any gospell was written&#146;, and approvingly &#145;Why the clergy doth not suffer the Byble to be had in Englyshe&#146;. Yet by 1561 Paynell had translated a work by Nicolas Harape as <span class="italic">The Ensamples of Vertue and Vice, Gathered Oute of Holye Scripture</span> and addressed it to Elizabeth. There the reader learns that &#145;we oughte to have great reverence unto holye scripture which God himself did wryte, deliver and teache&#146;  (chap. 26). However the recommendation of poverty and the ideals of the early church  (chap. 74) underline a consistency in Paynell's social concerns, which are illustrated also by his translation of Vives's <span class="italic">The Office and Duetie of an Husband</span> (1553).<br>
<br>Besides other extant works of Paynell described by Pollard in the <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span> there are two works mentioned by Wood and twelve by Bale which are no longer extant. A list of the books, including manuscript notebooks, bequeathed by Paynell to St John's College, Oxford, can be found in Emden  (728&#150;30). Disappointingly they shed little light on the work of Paynell the translator.<br>
<br>Paynell's ability to straddle the religious divide is demonstrated by his manuscript commonplace book  (Salisbury MSS, Cecil papers, 5.332) which contains among much else &#145;The exposytone uppon the psalme 127 by the famus and lerned doctor Martyne Luther of Wyteberge translated owt of Latyne in to Englyshe by Thomas Paynell Esquyre&#146; and twelve lines of poetry on Thomas More  (McConica, 139&#150;40).<br>
<br>The starting point for any reassessment of Thomas Paynell is a letter of A. F. Pollard in the <span class="italic">Times Literary Supplement</span>  (26 Feb 1931, 156), replying to a provocative, but informative, letter of H. E. Salter which appeared in the same journal  (12 Feb 1931, 116). In this letter Pollard virtually repudiated his article in the <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span> and called for a new edition of the dictionary. He now identified five or possibly six Thomas Paynells. Noteworthy are a father and son of this name who were respectively protector and pupil of Robert Barnes. Coincidentally Barnes's fellow martyr Thomas Gerrard was Benese's predecessor at All Hallows. Benese was the appointee of Henry VIII, but Gerrard was, like the translator Paynell, the appointee of the Grocers' Company. Another Thomas Paynell was a cousin of the translator and bailiff of Boston. Their family had founded the house of Austin canons at Drax. Pollard drew attention in this letter to his commonplace book at Hatfield as an important source for future investigations of Paynell.<br>
