<span class="headword">Biddle,  Hester</span>  (1629/30&#150;1697), <span class="occ">Quaker minister and writer</span>, spent her childhood in Oxford. She twice refers to having been born an Anglican, but nothing else is known of her family origin. She wrote only under her married name, so her marriage to Thomas Biddle (<i>d</i>. 1682), a cordwainer, occurred before 1655. Until 1666 they lived in the Old Exchange (Royal Exchange), City of London, but after the great fire they moved south of the river to Bermondsey Street. They had four children, all sons: Quaker records identify Daniel (1660&#150;1685), Benjamin (<i>b</i>. 1663), and two sons named Thomas (one dying in 1666, his brother living 1668&#150;70). Hester was widowed in 1682, when Thomas died of unknown causes, and she subsequently lived in relative poverty, receiving 5<i>s</i>. weekly as a &#145;poor Friend&#146; from the Peel monthly meeting  (Rickman, 39&#150;41).<br>
<br>Most of what is known about Hester Biddle relates to her religious experiences as a Quaker. She received a traditional religious upbringing from her parents, and disapproved of the abolition of the <span class="roman">Book of Common Prayer</span>. She became a Friend in response to the preaching of Edward Burrough and Francis Howgill in 1654, and thereafter she became an active Quaker minister and writer. She is sometimes believed to be the woman known to Quaker leader George Fox for predicting the return of Charles II, but the evidence for this well-known story is an unsubstantiated reference in an eighteenth-century text and so must be treated with caution.<br>
<br>Hester Biddle travelled extensively, both at home and abroad. Within the &#145;four kingdoms&#146; of the British Isles her ministry included Oxford (1655), Cornwall (1656), Ireland (1659), and Scotland (1672). Her journeys abroad were also numerous, and accounts exist of ministry and travels in Newfoundland (1656, with Mary Fisher), the Netherlands (1656, 1661), Barbados (1657), Alexandria (now Egypt, 1658; on her way she met Katherine Evans, Sarah Cheevers, and Mary Fisher), and France (1694&#150;5). The last-named journey is the most oft-cited; having visited Mary II, Biddle gained a pass to address Louis XIV, whom she urged to pursue politics of peace.<br>
<br>Biddle's ministering brought her into conflict with local authorities and the state church, resulting in fourteen cases of detention. During the 1650s, when Quakers were encouraged to preach in public to spread their faith, Biddle criticized the clergy, mayors, and magistrates. She was in Oxford and Cambridge in 1655, producing a broadside that reminded &#145;corrupt&#146; university-educated churchmen that &#145;God exalteth the poor in spirit, but the rich he sendeth empty away&#146;  (<span class="italic">Wo to the City of Oxford</span>, 1655). This radical rejection of social hierarchy and authority is reflected, too, in her imprisonment at Banbury for &#145;some zealous reprehension uttered against the Mayor and the Magistrates&#146;  (Besse, 1.564). Other arrests included Launceston (1656) and Godalming (1659), where she was &#145;much beaten and abused&#146;  (ibid., 1.689). The report of her trial for preaching in 1662 included a defence of women's speaking in response to the jury's astonished remark that &#145;they never heard of a woman to speak before&#146;, and a refusal to allow alderman Richard Browne to reprimand her for travelling without her husband  (<span class="italic">A Brief Relation</span>, 35). Letters referring to her consequent confinement in Bridewell and to later imprisonments, one of them for &#145;writing a book&#146;, are in the Public Record Office and in Friends' Library, London.<br>
<br>Between 1655 and 1662 Biddle was the author of fiery pamphlets that show an acute awareness of social and economic inequality. Typical of her stance is a challenge issued in <span class="italic">The Trumpet of the Lord</span> (1662):<blockquote>did not the Lord make all men and women upon the earth of one mould, why then should there be so much honour and respect unto some men and women, and not unto others, but they are almost naked for want of Cloathing, and almost starved for want of Bread? (p. 12)</blockquote>Biddle died in St Sepulchre's parish, Clerkenwell, London, on 5 February 1697, aged sixty-seven, suffering from a &#145;stoppage&#146;  (Quaker register of burials). The administration of her estate was granted to her son Benjamin on 19 February. She was a radical writer and activist who advocated social equality, arguing from a direct sense of empathy: &#145;the poor &hellip; are ready to famish, for whose estate and condition my heart is pained within me&#146;  (<span class="italic">A Warning from the Lord God &hellip; unto &hellip; London</span>, 1660, 11).<br>
