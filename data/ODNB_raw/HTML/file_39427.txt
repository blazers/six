</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Rossiter,  Leonard</span>  (1926&#150;1984), <span class="occ">actor</span>, was born on 21 October 1926 at 19 Cretan Road, Wavertree, Liverpool, the elder son of John Rossiter (<i>d</i>. 1942), barber, illegal bookmaker, and wartime voluntary ambulance man, and his wife, Elizabeth Howell. Rossiter was educated at the collegiate grammar school in Liverpool, and was conscripted into the army education corps towards the end of the war. Although he displayed considerable abilities in various directions, Rossiter's horizons were severely limited as a result of his father's death in an air raid in Liverpool when he was sixteen. He had plans to study modern languages at university and ambitions to be a teacher, which were developed during his army service. He had a gift for sports, was a talented cricketer, not far away from professional standards, and later became an enthusiastic squash player.<br>
<br>The need to support his mother shelved all ambitions and led Rossiter to work as a clerk in an insurance company for six years, sustained by amateur dramatics in the evenings. He finally turned professional at the age of twenty-seven in <span class="italic">The Gay Dog</span> at Preston in 1954, and soon found steady employment in cameo appearances in television and films. His first big break came in 1963 as Fred Midway in David Turner's <span class="italic">Semi-Detached</span> at the Belgrade Theatre, Coventry, and in New York&#151;the first of a profitable line of characters who were, indeed, semi-detached in a variety of ways from the world we live in, ranging from the desperate to the over-confident and crooked. This range of characters became Rossiter's stock-in-trade, almost as if a <i>commedia dell'arte</i> stereotype had been turned loose in contemporary drama. His portrayal of Bertolt Brecht's Arturo Ui won him both Critics' and Variety Club awards. On 27 September 1958 he married the actress Josephine Ann Tewson (<i>b</i>. 1930/31), daughter of William Tewson, an engineer; but the marriage was soon dissolved. In 1962 Rossiter met his second wife, another actress, Gillian Mary Lorraine (<i>b</i>. 1926/7), daughter of Hilary Pilkington Kaufmann, a civil servant; she performed under the stage name Gillian Raine. They married on 27 March 1972 and had a daughter.<br>
<br>There are some actors who appear to have invented acting from scratch. Rossiter was one such, making up for a lack of formal training by a dedication to working out the problems posed by performance in his own way, out of his physical make-up and athleticism. He always appeared to be a bundle of nerves, continually moving on spring heels, shadowing the moves and speech of the other actors. Even when still, he presented a bundle of kinetic energy ready to be released as movement when his next cue came up. In almost any other actor these trade marks would have made him unemployable, but Rossiter brought with them a ferocious concentration, an oversized reaction and gesture, and a transparent revelation of the negative side of the positive motivation his character was presenting to the world. He was above all a dialectical actor whose clowning took the audience back to the world of the silent films, a style of acting in which the wildest absurdities were played with the utmost seriousness. He was noted as a perfectionist who left nothing to chance. Contemporaries saw him as a unique, one-off actor, who put everything he had into a role. &#145;The suit acted, the shoes acted, the whole body was a force-field &hellip; He ionised the world he moved through&#146;  (Alan Coren, <span class="italic">Kaleidoscope</span>, Radio 4, 8 Oct 1984).<br>
<br>What Leonard Rossiter will always be remembered for, in spite of all his other achievements, are his roles in the television situation comedies <span class="italic">Rising Damp</span> (1974&#150;8) and <span class="italic">The Fall and Rise of Reginald Perrin</span> (BBC, 1976&#150;80). In these he played two figures of our time, the two sides of one coin: one the squalid, would-be suave, landlord; the other a business executive, crushed by the incompetence and inanity of business culture and the monotony of extended family relationships. In <span class="italic">Rising Damp</span> his attempts, as Rigsby, to impress his superiority in many ways on his university student lodgers were constantly doomed to failure by his inability to balance an argument between attack and defence. Constantly on the attack, his face (and mind) well ahead of his body, he was easy meat for the laid-back put-downs of Richard Beckinsale and Don Warrington; his efforts romantically to pursue Miss Jones were hampered by his inability to control the leer which preceded his every advance and undermined his expressed intentions. Reginald Perrin was a much more complex characterization, Mr Punch in a three-piece suit: a talented, spirited character, restrained and repressed by lesser talented, clich&eacute;-spouting superiors, sponged on by insensitive and boring relatives. He responds with unperceived ironic mutterings under his breath, silent caustic comments. At the very mention of his mother-in-law his subconscious throws up an image of a hippopotamus in his mind. Even the clothes he wears seem to imprison him and his one doomed attempt at freedom involves his throwing off his clothes on Brighton beach only to find the sea is cold. It is a mark of the endurance and quality of <span class="italic">Rising Damp</span> and <span class="italic">The Fall and Rise of Reginald Perrin</span> that both were revived, by the BBC and ITV, in 2000 and were given an extended run. A series of adverts for Cinzano, with Joan Collins, called for a further variation of Rossiter's misfits, a would-be bon viveur, whose attempts to impress Collins invariably ended in her being drenched with Cinzano. Through these, Rossiter became a national figure.<br>
<br>An enthusiastic sportsman and physical exerciser, Leonard Rossiter succumbed most ironically to a heart attack, due to a congenital disease of the heart muscles, while playing Truscott, the corrupt policeman, in Joe Orton's <span class="italic">Loot</span>, on 5 October 1984, a part he was made to play and to which he added a rare distinction. He was declared dead at the Middlesex Hospital, Westminster.<br>
