<span class="headword">Higgins,  Terrence Lionel Seymour</span>  (1945&#150;1982), <span class="occ">first publicly identified AIDS victim in the United Kingdom</span>, was born on 10 June 1945 in Priory Mount Hospital, Haverfordwest, Pembrokeshire, the son of Marjorie Irene Higgins (formerly Phillips), a railway porter in Haverfordwest. Remembered through the manner of his death, and the work of the trust that bears his name, the life of Terrence Higgins reflects at every turn the shifting history of the gay male community in late twentieth-century Britain.<br>
<br>Higgins joined the Royal Navy at the age of eighteen in 1963, and as a gay man came into conflict with the prevailing hostility towards homosexuality in the services. Consequently he decided to leave. A contemporary reports that the authorities refused to discharge him on the grounds of his homosexuality. Instead, he painted hammer and sickle motifs around his ship, was formally charged, and was asked to leave the navy.<br>
<br>Higgins moved to London, where the changing climate of the 1960s, the partial decriminalization of homosexuality in 1967, and the work of the Gay Liberation Front from the early 1970s had created a rapidly expanding, commercial scene of gay clubs and bars. Entering into this world he lived first in Notting Hill and Streatham, eventually settling in a flat with friends in Barons Court Road, Kensington. He worked as a telex and computer operator and as a barman in the best-known gay club, Heaven.<br>
<br>In the summer of 1981 Higgins began to lose weight, developing a persistent rash and gradually becoming weaker and weaker. In April 1982 he collapsed on the dance floor at Heaven and was taken to St Thomas's Hospital, discharging himself after a number of days when doctors were unable to diagnose or treat his condition. In the middle of June he collapsed again and was readmitted to the isolation unit. Diagnosed as having parasitic pneumonia, he died in St Thomas's on 4 July 1982 at the age of thirty-seven. His body was cremated. Pneumonia was given by the coroner as the cause of death on his death certificate, which was certified &#145;after post mortem without inquest&#146;  (d. cert.).<br>
<br>Higgins's death came at a time of increasing concern in the gay community over an apparently new disease affecting the immune system of a number of gay men in New York, San Francisco, and Los Angeles. In the autumn of 1982 a growing number of articles in the United Kingdom focused on what had been termed the Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) epidemic, noting the presence of cases in Britain alongside the numbers of American deaths. Although Britain's first AIDS case had been reported in <span class="italic">The Lancet</span> in 1981, it was the death of Terrence Higgins that brought the disease fully into public view.<br>
<br>Frustrated by the absence of a medical explanation for why Higgins had contracted pneumonia, and concerned at the risk of the disease spreading further, his friends sought to use his death as a platform for further action. Meeting in mid-November 1982, Terrence's former partner Rupert Whitaker, together with Martyn Butler, Tony Calvert, Len Robinson, and Chris Peel, set up the Terrence Higgins Trust. Its formation was announced in the free newspaper <span class="italic">Capital Gay</span> on 26 November 1982. Under the headline &#145;US disease hits London&#146;, the paper identified four AIDS-related deaths in London. Terrence Higgins was named as one of these men, the first person to be publicly identified as dying from an AIDS-related illness in the UK. By announcing the charity in this way his friends sought to draw some good from their loss, saying &#145;we have named it after Terry but we are doing it for the people who are left. He was a great inspiration to us all&#146;. In creating this publicity they also exploited it, personalizing and humanizing AIDS in order to raise money to fund medical research into the causes of the disease and educate gay men about its potential dangers.<br>
<br>The Terrence Higgins Trust remains the largest and best-known British AIDS organization, continuing the work of education, research, and support which started with the death and naming of Terrence Higgins in 1982.<br>
