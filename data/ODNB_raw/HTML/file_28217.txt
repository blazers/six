<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Vere,  Robert  de</span>, third earl of Oxford  (<em>d.</em> 1221), <span class="occ">magnate</span>, was the third surviving son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28204/', "Aubrey (III) de Vere, the first earl (d. 1194)")</script>, and of his third wife, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/62379/', "Agnes of Essex (b. 1151, d. in or after 1206)")</script>. Little is known of him before 1207. Before his father's death in 1194 he attested several charters to monastic houses founded by the de Vere family, but his name does not appear on any charters issued by his elder brother Aubrey (IV), the second earl, and rarely on those of others. Before Michaelmas 1207 Robert married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/56563/', "Isabel de Bolebec")</script>, the aunt and namesake of Aubrey (IV)'s wife, who had died childless in either 1206 or 1207. The pipe roll of 1207 states that the first instalment of Isabel's fine for not being compelled to marry was in fact paid by her new husband, Robert de Vere. Isabel the niece had been the heir to the Bolebec estate, based upon Whitchurch in Buckinghamshire. Her own heirs were her two aunts, and Robert's marriage was clearly a de Vere strategy to retain control over at least half the Bolebec lands. It may also have recognized Robert as heir apparent to the earldom of Oxford. Despite two marriages Earl Aubrey failed to father a legitimate heir, and he was also predeceased by his next brother, Ralph. Robert and Isabel had one child, Hugh, later fourth earl of Oxford.<br>
<br>Robert de Vere succeeded his brother in October 1214. King John charged him 1000 marks for his relief and a wardship, but may not have confirmed him in the earldom and hereditary master chamberlainship; de Vere attested a royal charter issued in London on 15 January 1215 without a title. Earl Aubrey had been numbered among King John's cronies, but Robert de Vere joined the rebellion against John, one of six known rebel leaders who were descendants of his grandparents Aubrey de Vere and Alice de Clare and part of a large group whose holdings were predominantly in the eastern counties. The relief was high for a baronage of moderate extent such as de Vere's, but his primary grievance may have been John's withholding of the earldom. He attended the assembly of barons at Stamford in April 1215, and was named by Roger of Wendover as one of the principal promoters of discontent. The king must have agreed; he ordered that de Vere's lands be seized in mid-May, along with the estates of several others on Wendover's list. While de Vere was among the rebels at Runnymede, his role in the negotiations for <span class="roman">Magna Carta</span> is impossible to reconstruct. By 23 June the king had recognized him as earl of Oxford, for on that date the sheriff of Oxfordshire was ordered to pay Earl Robert the comital percentage of judicial fines from that county. The earl was one of the twenty-five barons elected to oversee the implementation of <span class="roman">Magna Carta</span> [<i>see also </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/93691', "Enforcers of Magna Carta")</script>]. The fact that he attested writs issued to implement their judgments could indicate that he was deeply involved in rebel counsels, but the wavering course of his allegiance in 1215 and the years immediately following could equally well show that he was principally moved by external pressures. He was excommunicated by Pope Innocent III, and in late March 1216 John captured Oxford's primary castle at Hedingham, Essex, after a three-day siege. The earl was granted safe conduct to seek the king's forgiveness, yet within months he had offered his homage to Prince Louis of France at Rochester. After John's death Earl Robert recovered his lands, and he formally made his peace with the new regime in October 1217.<br>
<br>By 1220 the earl of Oxford was serving as an itinerant justice, and he presided in the <i>curia regis</i> in 1221; political considerations may have lain behind his judicial employment, but he may also have become conversant with the common law in his capacity as a landowner and local magnate. He patronized the Essex houses of Hatfield Broadoak Priory and Tilty Abbey, Osney Abbey in Oxfordshire, and the hospitallers. When the earl died, shortly before 25 October 1221, he was buried in the Benedictine priory of Hatfield Broadoak, although Earls Colne Priory was the traditional burial place of the de Vere family. His effigy rests in the parish church at Hatfield, where it was moved after the dissolution. Its shield differs from those of all other de Veres in that the silver mullet in the first quarter was borne not on a field gules, but on one of France ancient. No account explains these anomalies. Countess Isabel obtained the guardianship of their son, who was a minor, and his estates, which she exercised for approximately ten years. She died on 3 February 1245 and was buried at the Dominican friary in Oxford. Earl Hugh died in December 1263.<br>
