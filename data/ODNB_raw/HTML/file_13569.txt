<span class="headword">Hollis,  George</span>  (1793&#150;1842), <span class="occ">engraver</span>, of whose parents nothing is known, was born at Oxford and from about 1807 until about 1815 was apprenticed to George Cooke in London. He worked mainly on topographical subjects, the earliest of which to attract notice, in 1818, were six views of Chudleigh, Devon, drawn before the destructive fire of 1807 by Henry Francis de Cort. Further views appeared in works on Greece (1819), Hallamshire in the West Riding of Yorkshire (1819), Cheshire (1819), Wiltshire (1824), Shrewsbury (1825&#150;6), and Glastonbury (1826). J. Hakewill's <span class="italic">Picturesque Tour of Italy</span> (1818&#150;20) contained some engravings worked up by J. M. W. Turner from the author's drawings. In 1821 W. B. Cooke held his first exhibition of engravings at 9 Soho Square, London, which included six plates by Hollis (whose address was given as Oxford)&#151;two of Rome after Turner, two architectural studies in Oxford and Edinburgh, and two landscapes. Engravings done by him for the publications of the Society of Dilettanti and the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> were admired, and he also engraved views of Oxford colleges and halls, some after his own designs. From about 1830 to 1834 he lived in Montmartre, Paris, where he probably obtained the commission to engrave on steel two plates for L. Bechstein's <span class="italic">Th&uuml;ringen</span> (vol. 4 of <span class="italic">Das malerische und romantische Deutschland</span>, 1836). These were two of his few engravings on steel, probably a reflection of his master's extreme dislike of the metal; other engravings using steel appeared in J. H. Caunter's <span class="italic">Scenes in India</span> (vol. 1 of the <span class="italic">Oriental Annual</span>, 1834), and a single plate after G. Pickering, dated 1835, was published in E. Baines's <span class="italic">History of the County Palatine and Duchy of Lancaster</span> (1836). Some engravings by G. and T. Hollis were done for <span class="italic">Cumberland's British Theatre</span>, 6 (1834). In 1837 Hollis engraved Turner's <span class="italic">St Mark's Place, Venice&#151;Juliet and her Nurse</span> on copper, signed, as usual, &#145;G. Hollis&#146;; exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1838, it remained unpublished at his death, but was issued by Agnew in 1842. Hollis etched some drawings by his son Thomas for <span class="italic">Monumental Effigies of Great Britain</span> in 1839 (continuing an earlier work by Charles Stothard), the first part of which was published in 1840. Only five parts were completed at his death, which occurred on 2 January 1842 at Gloucester Buildings, Walworth, London, at the age of forty-nine.<br>

<a name="cosubject_13569"></a><span class="headword">Thomas Hollis</span>  (1818&#150;1843)<span class="occ"></span>, George Hollis's only son, was born in London and about 1830 moved with his family to France. As a schoolboy he sketched scenes around Montmartre, Paris, and in 1832 copied paintings in the Louvre. At the age of sixteen he helped his father to produce some engravings for <span class="italic">Cumberland's British Theatre</span>, 6 (1834). A self-taught artist, he continued his studies in the British Museum and National Gallery on his return to England, and in April 1836 was admitted as a student at the Royal Academy, where he trained to become a historical painter. He was later a pupil of the portrait painter H. W. Pickersgill. Hollis is known as the painter of many landscape views around Dulwich. On his father's death he tried to provide for his widowed mother, and etched as well as drew a few more plates for <span class="italic">Monumental Effigies of Great Britain</span>, but as a result of overwork he died of consumption on 14 October 1843 at Apollo Buildings, Walworth, aged only twenty-five.<br>
