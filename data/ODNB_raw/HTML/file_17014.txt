<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Lord,  Percival Barton</span>  (1808&#150;1840), <span class="occ">diplomatic agent and surgeon</span>, was born at Cork. He was the son of John Lord, chaplain to an institution founded by the Kingston family at Mitchelstown, co. Cork, for the relief of decayed gentlewomen. After being taught by his father he went to Trinity College, Dublin, where he graduated BA in 1829 and MB in 1832. From Dublin he went to Edinburgh, where he zealously studied anatomy and physiology and acted as resident superintendent of a hospital during an epidemic of cholera. Following completion of his course in Edinburgh he went to London, and there contributed some valuable medical reviews to the <span class="italic">Athenaeum</span>, notably two on consumption in the numbers for 15 and 22 March 1834, which were reprinted by medical journals on the continent and in America.<br>
<br>On 23 November 1834 Lord was appointed assistant surgeon in the service of the East India Company, and proceeded to Bombay. On the voyage he studied Persian. He was appointed to the native cavalry in Gujarat, and afterwards accompanied, as surgeon, the embassy (the &#145;commercial mission&#146;) which was sent under Sir Alexander Burnes to Kabul. At Kabul he won the friendship of Dost Muhammad Khan and other Afghan chiefs, and his fame reached the ears of Murad Beg, the dreaded emir of Kunduz, who sent a mission to request his attendance on his brother, then threatened with blindness. Accordingly, late in November 1837, Lord penetrated into Tartary through the mountains of the Hindu Kush. He found the case of Murad Beg's brother hopeless, but he embodied valuable observations in a report to the government, which met with the highest approval.<br>
<br>Lord was consequently, on 1 October 1838, named political assistant to William Hay Macnaghten, the envoy dispatched to Kabul, and was sent to Peshawar to collect and arm all the natives who were ready to fight on behalf of Shah Shuja, whom the English government had determined to place on the throne of Afghanistan instead of Dost Muhammad. At Peshawar he wrote to his mother that he was &#145;busied in casting cannon, forging muskets, raising troops, horse and foot, talking, persuading, threatening, bullying, and bribing&#146;. Lord determined on a vigorous forward policy to extend the authority of Shah Shuja even beyond the Hindu Kush. Initially he had a series of successes, and a mixture of bluff and modest force gained step-by-step advances towards Turkestan. But Macnaghten and the Indian government were always ambivalent and, in a confused situation, drew back. The first phase of the forward movement ended, Lord being killed in a minor engagement at Purwan on 2 November 1840. One of the early players of &#145;the great game&#146;, Lord was &#145;an unfortunate choice, for while he did not lack intelligence, there was an errant impulsiveness about his judgement which &hellip; cost Britain dear&#146;  (Yapp, 353).<br>
