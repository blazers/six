<span class="headword">Borgarucci,  Giulio</span> <span class="st"> [<em>known as </em>Dr Julio]</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1581), <span class="occ">physician</span>, came from Urbino, being one of four sons of Carlo Borgarucci, and his wife, Caliope: the heraldic <span class="italic">Visitation of London</span>  (Rawlins, 101&#150;2), which describes Giulio's armorial bearings, identifies earlier generations. The other sons were Borgaruccio, the eldest; Prospero, the youngest, born in Canziano, who became professor of anatomy at Padua in 1564; and Bernardino, a jurisconsult. Giulio came to England as a protestant refugee, and was a member of the Italian church in London. In 1569, on a visit to Gravesend, his life was endangered by a Spaniard and two Italians, for religion. He obtained denization in 1562. The following year he was sent to &#145;Newhaven&#146; (Le Havre), to aid Ambrose Dudley's besieged garrison, which was suffering from plague; but, becoming ill, he soon returned.<br>
<br>Back in London, Borgarucci successfully treated the plague epidemic by blood-letting, and advocated the use of a balsamic ball (<i>pomo</i>) for countering the effects of foul air. He lived in Wood Street, London, being assessed there for subsidy in St Alban's parish in 1564 on &pound;70 and in 1572 on &pound;50; by 1576 he had removed to St Botolph without Bishopsgate, where he was assessed on &pound;60. In 1567 he was incorporated MD (as of Padua) in the University of Cambridge. He was paid for attendance on, and medication (some specified) used for, Sir Henry Sidney's family during 1568&#150;75. From Spa, Christopher Hatton wrote to the queen (1573), saying, &#145;My dear Lady, I amend: some proof thereof hath Julio sent unto you&#146;  (Nicholas, 30). However, his chief patron was then the earl of Leicester (presumably, on his brother Ambrose's recommendation), who was alleged  (Peck, 116) to have made malevolent use of Borgarucci's knowledge of poisons: hence, John Webster's <span class="italic">White Devil</span> (1612) has a poisoner named &#145;Julio, a doctor&#146;. By patent of 21 September 1573 he was made physician to the royal household for life, replacing the deceased Dr Bentley, with a fee of &pound;50 per annum.<br>
<br>Borgarucci married Alice, daughter of Thomas Nosworthy, of Chichester, but in October 1573 he wrote to Lord Burghley complaining that Sir William Cordell, master of the rolls, had for five months detained his wife in his house, nourishing her in his &#145;popish superstitions&#146;. As late as 1576 Borgarucci wrote to Leicester, saying that &#145;the Archbishop of Canterbury [Grindal] had sworn I should never obtain this gentlewoman I have married&#146;  (Peck, 275). The latter was, presumably, his second wife, Eleanor (<i>d</i>. 1581): in 1578 and 1579 both Dr Julio and Mrs Julio exchanged new year's gifts with the queen.<br>
<br>In June 1578 the Spanish ambassador reported on &#145;a certain Julio&#146; thought to be &#145;plotting some villainy&#146; against Spain: bent, and &#145;of the colour of a Morisco &hellip; he usually looks on the ground &hellip; as he walks&#146;. The fact that &#145;He speaks eight or nine languages beautifully and is closeted for hours every day with Leicester and Walsingham and sometimes with the queen&#146;  (Hume, nos. 502, 505) argues strongly that this was Borgarucci, who, his brother Prospero said, was <i>huomo ueramente de nostri tempi</i>  (Borgarucci, 59).<br>
<br>In 1578 Giulio and Eleanor obtained a mansion with garden and orchard, part of the site of the dissolved St Mary Spital: they doubtless then occupied the property, as did Eleanor after Giulio's death. John Banister's <span class="italic">The Historie of Man</span> contains Borgarucci's commendatory Latin epistle; and letters he wrote survive in the Public Record Office  (SP 46.44, fol. 53) and the British Library.<br>
<br>Borgarucci died on 7 January 1581, and was buried that day at St Botolph without Bishopsgate. By his will, begun on 26 December and completed on 30 December 1580, he bequeathed sums of money to his brother Bernardino's daughters Alicia and Isabella (in Venice, with their father), and to the poor prisoners in London; the residue was left to his wife Eleanor, who was executrix; the overseer was Giovanni Battista Castiglione. Probate was granted on 31 January 1581. Eleanor died on 10 August, and, as &#145;Mrs Elinor Julie&#146;, was buried with her late husband on 11 August 1581.<br>
