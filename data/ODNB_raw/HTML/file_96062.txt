<span class="headword">Swan,  (Richard) Kenneth <span class="st"> [Ken]</span></span>  (1919&#150;2005), <span class="occ">tour operator</span>, was born on 3 April 1919 at 175 High Street, Guildford, Surrey, the only child of William Frederic Swan, founder of Swan's Travel Bureau, and his wife, Gladys, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Lumley. He was educated at the City of London School, before leaving in 1935 to join his father's travel agency, where he worked until the outbreak of the Second World War. During the war he organized troop movements, mainly in the Middle East, ending the war with the rank of major. He was married twice: his first marriage, on 6 June 1942, to Lesley Muriel Parker, a twenty-year-old shorthand typist, and daughter of Basil Mason Parker, bank clerk, ended in divorce. After the war he rejoined his father's business, which was renamed W. F. and R. K. Swan Travel Ltd. On 21 November 1951 he married Marion Ethel Knight, a 28-year-old secretary, daughter of Reginald Herbert Balls, grocer's assistant, and former wife of Jack Coldham Knight; they had one son and one daughter.<br>
<br>Before the First World War Swan's father had been private secretary to Sir Henry Lunn, the travel agent and organizer of the first Hellenic Cruise to Troy and the Greek islands in 1908, and founder of the Hellenic Travellers' Club. When in 1951 Swan was asked by the Society for the Promotion of Hellenic Studies to arrange a tour to Greece for its members, he decided to organize it as a cruise. This led the Swans to revive the old Hellenic cruises, and the first cruise was advertised in 1955. From the start the Swans set high academic standards for the guest lecturers on the cruises, who included the archaeologist Sir Mortimer Wheeler, who was also television personality of the year in 1954 as a result of his appearances on <span class="italic">Animal, Vegetable or Mineral</span>. Wheeler was on the first cruise, and became a director of the company and subsequently chairman of the Hellenic Cruise division. He was in charge of choosing the lecturers, and wrote the detailed handbook to the sites. The lecturers gave talks on board ship, and helped to guide the passengers around the historical sites. Most of the passengers were retired members of the upper and professional classes, and many were as learned as the lecturers, including university dons, headmasters, bishops, judges, and diplomats, all intent on improving their knowledge of the ancient Mediterranean world: dinner-table conversation was at a high intellectual level. The cruises lasted two weeks, and there were usually eight a year, following a varied itinerary, concentrating on classical sites in the Aegean, but also visiting sites in the eastern Mediterranean and on the coast of north Africa. The ships chartered by the company were small&#151;the first, the <i>Ankara</i>, took 300 passengers&#151;and this helped to create an intimate atmosphere. Various traditions soon developed: one guest lecturer would be designated chaplain, and read the <span class="roman">Acts of the Apostles</span> in the theatre at Ephesus, and cast a wreath as the ship passed Gallipoli. Swan's wartime experience in the logistics of troop movements was the key to his success: everything was meticulously planned, and not only was he there to see the passengers off and welcome them back, but he would, if necessary, fly in during a cruise to deal with any crisis. Thus, for example, in August 1968, when the <i>Ankara</i> was in the Black Sea at the time of the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia, Swan flew in and directed the cruise to continue as planned to Odessa.<br>
<br>In 1961 Swan succeeded his father as managing director of W. K. and R. K. Swan Travel Ltd. He widened the scope of the cruises, including a 600 mile trip up the Nile, and introduced art treasures tours, including one to India and Ceylon. But in the 1960s other travel companies were developing the idea of cultural cruises, and competition became more intense. In 1968 Swan sold Swan Hellenic to Trust House Forte, remaining as managing director of Swan Hellenic, and also becoming managing director of THF Travel. When Forte decided to sell his travel companies Swan did not buy back Swan Hellenic, and in 1983 it was sold to P&amp;O. His retirement party, Swan's last cruise, was organized by the archbishop of Canterbury, Robert Runcie, and the president of the British Academy, Owen Chadwick, both former Swan Hellenic lecturers: the party was held on the Thames, and the guests included over 100 past and present lecturers. Swan became president of Swan Hellenic, and concerned himself with chartering new ships, <i>Minerva</i> in 1996, and the much larger <i>Minerva II</i> in 2003. Although many regulars disliked the new large ship, Swan and his wife loved it, and went on several cruises in it.<br>
<br>Swan also helped to create the Association of British Travel Agents (ABTA) in 1950, and played an active part on its councils and committees. He was appointed OBE in 1996 for services to the travel industry. Having lived for many years at Rathmore, Horsell Vale, Woking, Surrey, he died on 21 August 2005 in St Peter's Hospital, Chertsey, Surrey, of heart failure. He was survived by his wife, Marion, and their two children.<br>
