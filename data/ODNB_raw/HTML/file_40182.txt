<span class="headword">Baker,  John Norman Leonard</span>  (1893&#150;1971), <span class="occ">geographer</span>, was born on 12 December 1893 at 33 Beaumont Street, St Clements, Liverpool, the first son of the Revd John William Baker, Church of England clergyman, and his wife, Louisa (1858&#150;1945). From Liverpool College (1911&#150;13) he went up to Jesus College, Oxford, as an exhibitioner in 1913. Apart from military service, and a brief period as lecturer at Bedford College, London (1922&#150;3), he retained an association with Jesus College for the rest of his life.<br>
<br>Baker's undergraduate career, when he read modern history, was interrupted by the First World War. Wounded on the Somme, he was required to convalesce, and during this period he married Phyllis Marguerite Hancock (1892&#150;1981) on 8 November 1917. There followed two years in the Indian army, which were important in awakening his interest in geography; he later published several papers on India. After completing his history degree in 1920, Baker turned to geography, obtaining the diploma in geography with distinction in 1921, and gaining the Herbertson memorial prize. In 1923 he joined the small staff of the Oxford school of geography when he was appointed assistant to the reader and librarian. He was subsequently university lecturer from 1927, reader from 1933, and reader in historical geography from 1935. In these capacities he was heavily involved in teaching, first for the diploma and then, from 1932, for the new honour school of geography, the planning and arrangements for which owed much to his influence. He was active in geographical organizations outside Oxford: he was a fellow and council member of the Royal Geographical Society, but had more influence on other societies where he was not in the shadow of Kenneth Mason; as founder member of the Institute of British Geographers (a group of academic geographers who felt that the RGS with its continuing emphasis on exploration could not fully meet their professional aspirations), of which he was president in 1946; and in section E (Geography) of the British Association for the Advancement of Science of which he was section president in 1955.<br>
<br>Baker's scholarly research was concerned principally with the history of geography, exploration, and discovery. He was painstaking in his collection of factual material and had little time for modish theory. He published numerous papers on the great explorers and his book, <span class="italic">A History of Geographical Discovery and Exploration</span> (1931) became the standard work on the subject. In 1963, six of his former pupils&#151;all on the staff of the school of geography&#151;edited and presented to him a selection of his writings under the title of <span class="italic">The History of Geography</span>. In 1964 he was awarded the prestigious Victoria medal of the Royal Geographical Society &#145;for contributions to the history of geography&#146;. He was also an active member of the Hakluyt Society from 1924 onwards, and he served as its president between 1955 and 1960.<br>
<br>In 1939 Baker was elected to an official fellowship of Jesus College on his appointment as senior bursar, a position he held until 1962. During the Second World War he was engaged in intelligence work, but thereafter his college duties occupied an increasing proportion of his time and he resigned his readership in 1947, though he continued to give tutorials to his college students and to those in the department who studied his option on exploration. His withdrawal to his college probably reflected his disappointment that he was not appointed professor of geography at Oxford in 1932 and perhaps his lack of sympathy with the appointee, Kenneth Mason: it certainly reflects his intense college loyalty and love of tradition. As bursar he guided his college through its period of wartime growth and also published articles on its history in the college magazine, and a 150-page history, <span class="italic">Jesus College, Oxford, 1571&#150;1971</span> (1971).<br>
<br>Baker was elected a university member of Oxford city council in 1945 by the constituency of college heads and bursars. From then on, he gave generously of his time to civic affairs, drawing on his bursarial skills on behalf of the finance and estates committees, and on his geographical knowledge to the benefit of city planning, including the vexed issue of Oxford roads. He was alderman in 1963 and lord mayor, 1964&#150;5, the first university member to hold the latter office. He continued to serve the council until 1967. Baker died in Oxford on 16 December 1971 and was cremated on 21 December 1971 at the Oxford crematorium.<br>
<br>Baker, or J. N. L. B. as he was always known, made a significant contribution to the early study of exploration and the history of geographical ideas from the earliest times to the early twentieth century, and although post-war developments in the subject left him somewhat intellectually isolated, his writings remain a valuable basis of reference. He combined broad scholarship with administrative skills backed up by down-to-earth common sense. These qualities were evident in his contribution both to learned societies and to the day-to-day running of his Oxford college. He was held in great affection by his pupils and his wider interest in people and their welfare is evident in his contribution to civic life in Oxford. This sense of public responsibility was a legacy he passed on to his two daughters, the elder of whom, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/77303/', "Janet Mary Young, Baroness Young (1926&#150;2002)")</script>, played an active role in Oxford and national politics.<br>
