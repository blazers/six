<span class="headword">Chancellor, Sir  John Robert</span>  (1870&#150;1952), <span class="occ">army officer and colonial governor</span>, was born in Edinburgh on 20 October 1870, the second son of Edward Chancellor (1828&#150;1907), writer to the signet, and his wife, Anne Helen (<i>d</i>. 1932), daughter of John Robert Todd, also a writer to the signet. He was educated at Blair Lodge, Polmont, and the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, and was commissioned in the Royal Engineers in 1890. After a period of duty at home he served in India with the Dongola (1896) and the Tirah (1897&#150;8) expeditions, and in the latter his courage and initiative earned him a mention in dispatches and appointment to the DSO in 1898. In 1903 he married Elsie, daughter of George Rodie Thompson, a barrister, of Lynwood, Ascot. They had one daughter and two sons, the elder of whom was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/40107/', "Sir Christopher John Howard Chancellor (1904&#150;1989)")</script>, general manager of Reuters.<br>
<br>Back in Britain, Chancellor attended the Staff College and in 1904 was appointed assistant military secretary to the committee of imperial defence. He showed such administrative ability and sound judgement that in 1906 he was made secretary of the colonial defence committee. He was promoted major in 1910. It was a tribute to Chancellor's qualities that, at the age of forty, a soldier with no experience of colonial administration, he was appointed to the important governorship of Mauritius where his term of office, 1911&#150;16, was still recalled with admiration, more than thirty years later, by some who by then were leading personalities in the island. His success was rewarded by appointment to the governorship of Trinidad and Tobago, which he held from 1916 to 1921, and thereafter to the first governorship of Southern Rhodesia. This had to wait until 1923, when the territory was taken over from the British South Africa Company, and during the interval he served as a principal assistant secretary to the committee of imperial defence. He had been promoted lieutenant-colonel in 1918.<br>
<br>Chancellor's term in Southern Rhodesia, 1923&#150;8, more than justified his reputation as a capable and progressive administrator. The constitution which he helped to establish proved more durable than many such instruments and he opposed firmly any suggestion for the introduction of extreme forms of segregation. The ability which he showed in handling local politicians and in guiding the management of affairs led to his selection for the difficult appointment of high commissioner for Palestine and Transjordan, from 1928 to 1931; he succeeded Lord Plumer, whose term of office had been noteworthy for its freedom from those serious disturbances so unhappily frequent during the British administration of Palestine. This tranquillity and reasons of economy led to the withdrawal of the British military garrison from Palestine and to the reduction and reorganization of the police force. In consequence the civil power was without military aid when in August 1929, following incidents at, and in connection with, the Wailing Wall at Jerusalem, Arab attacks were made on Jews in several large towns in Palestine.<br>
<br>Chancellor was then on leave and, although the parliamentary commission of inquiry under Sir Walter Shaw, reporting in March 1930, found no serious fault with the governmental handling of the riots, there were some in Palestine who felt that events might have taken a very different course had Chancellor been in the country. The principal recommendation of the Shaw commission was that the British government should issue a statement of policy defining clearly and positively the meaning which they attached to certain passages in the mandate and should make it plain that they intended to give full effect to the policy thus defined. That recommendation was, almost certainly, influenced by Chancellor's views and he must have been well satisfied when, after further investigations, including one of land and immigration problems by Sir John Hope Simpson, the government issued a statement on policy in October 1930 which went to what Chancellor undoubtedly regarded as the root of the Palestine problem. When in February 1931 the white paper was in effect reinterpreted by Ramsay MacDonald in a statement to Chaim Weizmann, Chancellor's faith in government policy in Palestine was badly shaken and his disappointment was made evident in his speech at a farewell banquet in Jerusalem when he said: &#145;I came hoping to increase the country's prosperity and happiness. I am leaving with my ambition unfulfilled. Conditions were against me&#146;  (private information).<br>
<br>Regarded as &#145;aloof and suspicious&#146;  (Sherman, 77), Chancellor was &#145;convinced that the entire Balfour Declaration policy had been &#147;a colossal blunder&#148;, unjust to the Arabs and impossible of fulfillment in its own terms&#146;  (ibid., 85).<br>
<br>Though over sixty, Chancellor now embarked on a third career, serving as chairman or member of a number of governmental committees; on bodies such as the Royal Geographical, Royal Empire, and Royal African societies; and as a director of various companies.<br>
<br>Although not tall, Chancellor was impressive alike in appearance, in his carriage, and in the good taste with which he always dressed. He did not make friends quickly or easily but to his subordinates he showed a courtesy which commanded their devotion and, once his confidence had been won, his charm and sympathy made him excellent company. He held strong views on many issues of policy but after his retirement from Palestine he scrupulously avoided public controversy.<br>
<br>Chancellor was appointed CMG in 1909, KCMG in 1913, GCMG in 1922, GCVO in 1925, and GBE in 1947. He died on 31 July 1952 at Shieldhill, Lanarkshire, an estate which his family had owned for nearly eight hundred years.<br>
