<span class="headword">Lefroy,  George Alfred</span>  (1854&#150;1919), <span class="occ">bishop of Calcutta</span>, was born on 11 August 1854 at Aghaderg, co. Down, Ireland, the fourth son of the Very Revd Jeffrey Lefroy (<i>d</i>. 1885), dean of Dromore, and his wife, Helena, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Trench (1820&#150;1908). There were nine children in the family, three girls and six boys. Lefroy was educated at Marlborough School (1865&#150;74), and in 1874 entered Trinity College, Cambridge, where he also taught at the Jesus Lane Sunday school. At Cambridge he fell under the influence of the regius professor of divinity, B. F. Westcott, and Professor J. B. Lightfoot. These two members of the so-called &#145;Cambridge triumvirate&#146; urged undergraduates to undertake a special mission to educated Hindus and Muslims in India on the model of the classical Alexandrian school, where Clement and Origen had used Greek thought to reinterpret Christianity to educated Romans. In 1877 Lefroy joined five other men to inaugurate a celibate high-church brotherhood, the Cambridge Mission to Delhi, affiliated with the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel (SPG). Lefroy took a first-class degree in the theological tripos in 1878, was ordained priest in 1879, and arrived in Delhi before the end of the year. He became head of the Cambridge brotherhood in 1881, and head of the SPG mission in Delhi (which included St Stephen's Community, an Anglican sisterhood), in 1891.<br>
<br>Committed to an &eacute;litist model of clerical influence, Lefroy assumed pastoral responsibility in Delhi for a small Indian Christian community of poor leatherworkers whose piety he found suspect, and he reduced their numbers through the exercise of ecclesiastical discipline. Accomplished in Urdu, he conducted public disputations with learned Muslims which drew large crowds to Delhi's mosques but brought few converts to Christianity. His greatest long-term influence came through establishing prestigious Christian institutions, especially St Stephen's College and St Stephen's Hospital for Women.<br>
<br>Lefroy's conflict between missionary ideals and imperial power deepened after his consecration in 1899 as bishop of Lahore, with episcopal responsibility for the Punjab's extensive military chaplaincies. Despite his association with the government, Lefroy became a favourite with the nationalist press for his statements expressing a generous attitude toward the new national movement. In the face of stubborn opposition he promoted Indian clergymen to positions of diocesan authority and encouraged an interracial, semi-monastic order&#151;the Brotherhood of the Imitation of Christ&#151;centred on the Christian <i>sadhu</i> Sundar Singh. But these initiatives were overshadowed by Lefroy's public statements deploring the effects of Hinduism and Islam on the Indian moral character and by his opposition to the appointment of the first Indian head of St Stephen's College, S. K. Rudra. By the time of his consecration as bishop of Calcutta and metropolitan of India in 1913, it was clear to him that the Cambridge Mission's hopes of an Indian&#150;Christian synthesis of East and West had not been fulfilled.<br>
<br>Lefroy enjoyed sports and vigorous walks but after 1911 suffered from painful arthritis and recurrent malaria. His illnesses caused him to resign his bishopric, on Christmas day 1918. He died in Calcutta on 1 January 1919 and was buried in Calcutta Cathedral.<br>
