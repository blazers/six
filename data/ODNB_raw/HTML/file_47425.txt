<span class="headword">Henley,  Michael</span>  (<em>c.</em>1742&#150;1813), <span class="occ">merchant and shipowner</span>, was probably born at Rotherhithe. His origins are obscure though he may well have been the son of a Francis Henley from Ireland, who lived in Rotherhithe before being buried at Bermondsey in February 1785. Michael Henley married Mary Tonks on 4 August 1765 at St Clement Danes in the parish of Westminster. The marriage produced three daughters and two sons, the eldest, <a href="#cosubject_47427">Joseph [<i>see below</i>]</a>, playing an active part in his father's business. In December 1790 or January 1791 Mary died, and was buried in the family's vault at St John-at-Wapping. Michael married his second wife, Ann Lacey, in 1792. The marriage probably took place in Derby, and she appears to have been an educated woman of independent means.<br>
<br>Henley began his working life by serving an apprenticeship as a Thames waterman and lighterman. He was apprenticed to William Barrett of Bermondsey from 13 May 1757 to 12 July 1764. In the course of the following decade he appears to have made a success of his occupation as a London waterman, and then a coal merchant at Shadwell and Wapping. By 1775 he had expanded his operations through the purchase of a couple of old collier vessels, which were used to transport coal from Newcastle to London. In the following years he dabbled in related activities, including ship breaking and ship stores. However, Henley's shrewd entrepreneurial talents, and his experience of the mercantile and maritime sectors, alerted him to the cyclical influence of warfare upon the shipping industry. Thus the 1790s were a watershed in the evolution of the firm, when coal merchanting and most ancillary activities were abandoned, in order to specialize in shipowning, and thereby take advantage of the wartime booms in the shipping industry. By 1790 he owned nine vessels, a figure which had increased to fifteen by 1805. In 1810 the fleet reached its maximum size of twenty-two vessels with an aggregate tonnage of 5934. Henley's innovative nature also led him to deploy his vessels flexibly and widely across many trade routes including in the Baltic, the Mediterranean, and the Atlantic. Employment as government transport vessels provided further opportunities for Henley's fleet.<br>
<br>By decoupling mercantile and shipping operations, Henley appears to have been one of the pioneers of specialist professional shipowning, which became more common in the first half of the nineteenth century. Another important feature of his approach was the emphasis upon sole ownership of almost all of the vessels, in contrast to the more common contemporary practice of fractional ownership. On the few occasions where Henley shared ownership this was with a master of long standing, who took on greater managerial discretion in operating the vessel. In spite of these considerable entrepreneurial achievements, Henley's level of educational attainment appears to have been quite modest, and his business papers suggest only a low level of literacy. Although he developed some accounting skills, probably through his apprenticeship, his second wife wrote most of his letters for him.<br>
<br>The Henleys' eldest son, <a name="cosubject_47427"></a><span class="headword">Joseph Henley</span>  (1766&#150;1832)<span class="occ"></span>, appears to have become interested in his father's business from a relatively young age, and by the early 1780s he was playing an active role in it. He was bound as an apprentice waterman to his father in 1780, and as an apprentice farrier in 1784. In 1791 he married Anne Rooke (Nancy) at Wandsworth. They had two children, Anna Maria Rooke, who later died in childbirth, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/12929/', "Joseph Warner Henley")</script>, a Conservative politician. Like his father, Joseph Henley was a perceptive entrepreneur, and he played a prominent part in the further expansion of the firm in the first decade of the nineteenth century. Lacking his father's specialized interest in the coal trade, he was probably an important influence in the family's movement away from this activity. As the business expanded his father appears to have taken primary responsibility for the vessels, and Joseph for chartering and insurance. Additionally, Joseph appears to have improved the firm's system of accounting.<br>
<br>By 1805 Michael Henley had retired to Derby, and left Joseph with primary responsibility for the business, although the two communicated regularly on policy matters with the father offering frequent advice. In 1811 Joseph was elected a member of Lloyds, following its reorganization into a formal institution. With Michael Henley's death on 11 September 1813 at Friargate, Derby, Joseph was left to run the business on his own. Michael Henley was buried in a vault at St Werburgh's, Derby, where he had been a churchwarden, and left &pound;125,000 excluding freeholds. After his father's death Joseph leased Waterperry House, near Wheatley, a few miles from Oxford; and he purchased it in 1830. Anne Henley died in Derby in 1833.<br>
<br>Joseph received temporary support from his own son, Joseph Warner, before the latter went into politics. Although Joseph had served the office of high sheriff in 1817, his main commitment was to his business enterprise, but this was not the case for his son. Joseph Henley also received assistance from Edward Rule, a shipbroker, and several managing clerks including Thomas Dennis and W. Williams. However, lack of entrepreneurial continuity within the family, and the prolonged shipping depression of the 1820s, convinced the ageing Joseph of the need to contract his active shipping operations. A number of vessels were sold during the temporary economic upturn in the mid-1820s and by 1831 the firm appears to have ceased trading. Joseph died in 1832 in the middle of a commercial depression, and left &pound;60,000 excluding freeholds.<br>
