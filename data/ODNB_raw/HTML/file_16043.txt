<span class="headword">Langton,  Simon</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1248), <span class="occ">ecclesiastic and diplomat</span>, was the youngest son of Henry Langton of Langton by Wragby, Lincolnshire, and brother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16044/', "Archbishop Stephen Langton")</script>, who made him archdeacon of Canterbury. A third brother, Walter, inherited the family estate, but he was childless and on his death in 1234 his lands and debts fell to Simon. Simon was probably educated at Paris, where Stephen was the leading professor of the day, and he was almost invariably titled &#145;master&#146;. A number of written works have been attributed to him in the past but they have either disappeared or had their attribution questioned.<br>
<br>Langton first appears in public records in 1208, when his brother Stephen was seeking acceptance as archbishop of Canterbury by King John. As Stephen's agent Simon made two trips to England in 1208, and probably another in 1209, during which he proved himself a hard bargainer. When John's resistance finally ended in 1213, he welcomed Simon to England very warmly. But during the next two years Simon Langton appears as the leading member of the archiepiscopal <i>familia</i>, perhaps acting as its chancellor, in its continued opposition to the king, and he went to Rome in 1214 to rebut charges made against his brother. After he had been given rich prebends in both London and York, his fellow canons of York elected Simon Langton their archbishop in 1215, despite a papal prohibition against his seeking the office. But when he went to Rome to seek confirmation his election was quashed and he was forbidden any episcopal office without specific papal approval. Unchastened, Langton proceeded to join Louis of France in his invasion of England and to become Louis's chancellor. He flouted the orders of the papal legate who had been sent to oppose Louis, and for this disobedience he was excommunicated by name. Consequently, when Louis withdrew in 1218, Langton was forced to surrender all his benefices and go to Rome for absolution. In time he was reconciled, made a papal subdeacon, and allowed to hold a benefice in France, but he was exiled from England by both king and pope. He seems to have resided in Paris where he was a canon of Notre Dame and where he received a pension from the French crown.<br>
<br>A rumour late in 1220 that the pope might allow Simon Langton to return to England occasioned a passionate protest from a large group of magnates. The king remitted his ire and indignation towards the end of 1223, but it was not until 1227 that both king and pope, at the urging of the archbishop, now old and ill, permitted Langton's re-entry. Langton arrived at Dover on 25 July, having already been named archdeacon on 14 May. In December, only seven months before his own death, Archbishop Stephen issued acts granting his brother and his successors authority over all churches of the archdiocese including those of the archbishop and his chapter, giving them the power to choose and remove rural deans, and increasing the wealth of the archdeacons by appropriating to the office the rich churches of Teynham and Hackington. These acts were ratified by the monks of Christ Church, Canterbury, who were assured that no church of secular canons would be built at Hackington to compete with their church (as proposed by the last two archbishops), and furthermore, the archdeacon gave them the archidiaconal house in Canterbury. In its stead Langton built a new official mansion at Hackington which he called New Place.<br>
<br>For the most part the duties of Langton's office were performed by his officials, two of whom are known: Master Robert of Gloucester and Master Roger of Elham. But Langton's term of office would be marked by three great controversies with the Benedictines of the archdiocese. First in 1235 Archbishop Edmund appealed to Rome against the election by the monks of Rochester of Richard Wendene (<i>d</i>. 1250) as their bishop. Langton was the archbishop's advocate, but the action was lost and Langton was ordered by the pope to assist in the consecration and to install the monks' choice. Then in 1237 the abbey of St Augustine renewed its ancient claims against the archdeacon's jurisdiction over their appropriated churches, particularly in vacancies, but the matter was compromised yet again. Finally, in 1238, the monks of Christ Church, Canterbury, challenged the archbishop over their liberties, rights, and customs. The case was appealed to Rome, where the archbishop was again represented by the archdeacon, who accused the monks of forging their charters. This charge was proved, the prior was deposed, and two monks were exiled to other monasteries. But then the monks elected a new prior without proper involvement of the archbishop, who proceeded to excommunicate them. Langton supported Edmund wholeheartedly, and, after the archbishop died in 1240, brought a new claim that he, not the prior, should have spiritual jurisdiction in the archdiocese. The case was closed only when the king entered the lists in favour of his own candidate for the see and threatened royal wrath.<br>
<br>Langton was often more involved in the service of the pope and the king than of Canterbury. From the autumn of 1229 until that of 1237 there is no evidence that he spent any time in England. A rumour of his death reached the royal court in January 1232 and led to the appointment of a replacement until the story was found to be erroneous. His destination in 1229 was given as Rome, and the monastic chroniclers blame him for having sabotaged in 1231 and 1232 the elections to the archbishopric of Ralph Neville (<i>d</i>. 1244) and John Blund (<i>d</i>. 1248) respectively. Clearly he was held in high regard by Pope Gregory IX (<i>r</i>. 1227&#150;41), who gave him a task to perform in Paris. It was in France, too, that King Henry made use of Langton's diplomatic talents by charging him to negotiate truces with the king of France and the count of La Marche. This proved a long and complicated process that went on from November 1234 until August 1235, for which services the king was effusively grateful. Langton was back in England for the legatine council of London on 20 November 1237, where he proceeded to make an enemy of the legate by demanding that the latter's commission be read. He accompanied Archbishop Edmund to and from Rome in 1238, but he is not known to have gone abroad thereafter and in 1241 he decided that he was too old and infirm to cross the Alps again, even to pursue his feud with the monks of Christ Church. In 1242 Henry wrote specially to Langton to ask his prayers for the success of the expedition the king was leading to Gascony, but two years later had to seek to restore the reputations of royal clerks who had been given an unfavourable report to the pope by a commission that included the archdeacon of Canterbury. Langton can be shown to have remained active into 1247, and he did not die until 1248.<br>
<br>The Benedictines cursed his memory as persecutor and troublemaker; Matthew Paris denounced him as one who had stirred up trouble throughout England and France. But Simon Langton was remembered affectionately by the Franciscans, whom he had welcomed into England, and by the college of poor priests in Canterbury, of which he was second founder. At the University of Paris he left a library for the use of poor scholars, and at the cathedral of Notre Dame he endowed the celebration of his own and his brother's obituaries on the feast of the translation of St Thomas Becket, a feast that Stephen Langton had added to the church calendar.<br>
