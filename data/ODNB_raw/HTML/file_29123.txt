<span class="headword">Weston,  Jerome</span>, second earl of Portland  (1605&#150;1663), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born on 16 December 1605, the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29126/', "Richard Weston, first earl of Portland (bap. 1577, d. 1635)")</script>, and his second wife, Frances (<i>d</i>. 1645), daughter of Nicholas Waldegrave of Borley, Essex. He matriculated at Trinity College, Cambridge, at Easter, 1623, graduating MA in 1626. Although he entered the Middle Temple on 11 May 1626, he was never called to the bar. He married, at Roehampton Chapel on 25 June 1632, Frances (1617&#150;1694), third daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/67529/', "Esm&#233; Stuart, third duke of Lennox")</script>.<br>
<br>In 1628 Weston entered parliament as member for Gatton, Surrey, being returned with Sir Thomas Lake at the behest of one Copley, a Lincolnshire Catholic who claimed an electoral monopoly in the borough. The election was disputed, however, and on 26 March the indenture of the return was torn off the file by order of the House of Commons; Samuel Owfield and Sir Charles Howard sat instead by the election of all the inhabitants. Weston, however, continued to sit in that parliament, though for what constituency does not appear in the returns, and on 2 March 1629 he defended his father, the lord treasurer, against Sir John Eliot, who had demanded Sir Richard's impeachment. This well-attested intervention makes unlikely the claim that Weston had a hand in the diplomacy which led to the Anglo-French treaty of Susa, signed on 14 April 1629. But in pursuance of his father's foreign policy objectives he certainly was sent as ambassador-extraordinary to Paris and Turin in July 1632 to urge Louis XIII to declare in favour of the restitution of the palatinate. In November Charles I instructed him to protest against the proposed division of the Spanish Netherlands between France and the Dutch. He returned in March 1633 with Richelieu's proposals for a defensive alliance against the house of Austria; he also brought with him unlicensed letters he had intercepted written by Henry Rich, earl of Holland, and the queen of England, both enemies of his father. The opening of these letters provoked Holland to challenge Weston to a duel, but Charles I approved of Jerome's conduct, placed Holland under house arrest, and suspended him from the privy council.<br>
<br>Styled Lord Weston after his father's creation on 17 February 1633 as earl of Portland, Jerome succeeded as second earl on 13 March 1635 whereupon his career in government and politics stepped up a gear. He appears to have succeeded his father as captain-general of the Isle of Wight, and on 28 May 1635 he was made vice-admiral of Hampshire. On 3 June 1641 he was appointed joint lord lieutenant of Hampshire, but his royalist and religious sentiments rendered him suspect to parliament, and on 2 November the House of Commons resolved to deprive him of the government of the Isle of Wight. Upon conference with the House of Lords on the 18th this &#145;resolution was put off&#146;, the lords professing themselves much satisfied with Portland's &#145;solemn protestation of his resolution to live and die a protestant, as his father did&#146;&#151;a somewhat dubious promise, considering that it had been widely rumoured that his father had died a Roman Catholic  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1641&#150;3</i>, 154, 167). On 8 August 1642, the Lords, acting on the recommendation of the committee of safety, committed Portland to the custody of one of the sheriffs of London on suspicion of complicity in the plot to deliver Portsmouth into the king's hands, and he was sent to the Tower on 12 August. After a protracted campaign for his release he was granted a conditional discharge on 11 January 1643. According to Clarendon, after his release Portland remained in London &#145;as a place where he might do the king more service than anywhere else&#146;  (Clarendon, <span class="italic">Hist. rebellion</span>, 3.142). Prominent among the royalist &#145;peace lords&#146;, he was soon accused of having had some share in the plot of his friend Edmund Waller. Waller himself alleged Portland's complicity, and, although the earl denied the charge, he underwent another seven weeks' imprisonment. On 31 July 1643 he was released on bail, for which the earl of Denbigh and Lord Hunsdon stood security. A fortnight later he made use of his liberty to take refuge with the king at Oxford, where he sat in the royalist parliament. Entangled in the factional rivalries which divided the king's court at Oxford, Portland tried unconvincingly to dissemble best wishes towards George Lord Digby and his circle.<br>
<br>On 1 March 1644 the king appointed Portland lord president of Munster, an office coveted by Murrough O'Brien, earl of Inchiquin. Probably as a result of this disappointment the powerful Inchiquin turned parliamentarian, and, as a nominee of the parliament, made himself master of the province. Replaced by Philip Sidney, Viscount Lisle, in 1646, Inchiquin again changed sides, whereupon he received Charles's commission as lord president, so that Portland had no opportunity of taking up his appointment even had he been so inclined. He had surrendered his patent by 8 February 1662 in return for an annual pension of &pound;1000, and the leases in reversion on several properties in Surrey.<br>
<br>Portland was apparently at Oxford until its surrender on 24 June 1646, and then at Wallingford, which held out until 27 July. On 6 October following he compounded for his delinquency on the &#145;Wallingford articles&#146;, and on 10 November he was fined two-thirds of his estate, &pound;9953 10<i>s</i>.; on 14 September 1647 his discharge was ordered after a division of the house, and on 11 June 1650 his fine was reduced to &pound;5297 11<i>s</i>. 8<i>d</i>., possibly at the intercession of his brother, Benjamin, MP for Dover, who had declined to act in the trial of Charles I, yet conformed with the kingless regime after 1649.<br>
<br>Portland lived quietly at Ashley House, Walton-on-Thames, during the Commonwealth and protectorate, and in 1660 took his seat in the Convention Parliament, greatly assisting the accomplishment of unconditional restoration. The resumption of Stuart rule saw Portland attain not inconsiderable influence as a key supporter of the Clarendonian regime in the House of Lords. Although his father had been the object of Clarendon's intense hatred, the second earl was a close personal friend and ally of the lord chancellor, and he shared intimately in the responsibility for delivering the government's legislative programme in the Cavalier Parliament. In spite of his background he had an important hand in strengthening the <span class="roman">Act of Uniformity</span> as a bulwark against informal toleration of Catholicism. He also helped turn a reasonably interventionist corporation bill into a measure for the emasculation of municipal self-government. Conversely, he worked to scupper the kind of cavalier measures, such as the earl of Derby's bills for restitution of estate sold in the 1650s, which threatened to undermine the whole basis of the Restoration land settlement.<br>
<br>Never anywhere near as close to the throne as his father had been, none the less Portland was rewarded for his services. He was restored to the posts he held before the war, and received grants of other lands. On 7 November 1660 he was made a councillor for trade and navigation, and on 1 December for the colonies; on 3 April 1662 he was sworn of the privy council. Had he lived longer, he might have attained higher office, at least while Clarendon's star was in the ascendant. He died at Ashley House on 17 March 1663, and was buried on the 22nd in the church at Walton-on-Thames, where there is an inscription to his memory. His wife survived him by thirty-one years; she died in 1694 and was buried in Westminster Abbey on 17 March of that year. The couple had at least two daughters, one of whom was baptized Henrietta Maria, and a son, Charles (1639&#150;1665). He succeeded as third earl of Portland, but was killed during the naval battle with the Dutch off the Texel on 3 June 1665. He died unmarried, and the earldom and barony devolved upon his uncle Thomas Weston. He died in 1688 with no surviving heirs, with which the barony of Weston and earldom of Portland became extinct.<br>
