<span class="headword">&Iacute;varr</span> <span class="st"> [&Iacute;varr inn Beinlausi, Ingwaer, Imhar]</span>  (<em>d.</em> 873), <span class="occ">viking leader</span>, is a figure the facts of whose life are difficult to disentangle from legendary accretions. In the saga tradition of the thirteenth century and later he was one of the many sons of Ragnarr Lodbr&oacute;k (Ragnarr Hairy Breeches), a Danish king (or, alternatively, a Norwegian chieftain) whose historicity is very uncertain indeed.<br>
<br>&Iacute;varr's earliest appearance in contemporary or near-contemporary sources comes in the Irish annals, which name an &Iacute;varr (appearing there as Imhar) as the companion of &Oacute;l&aacute;f the White. In 857 the two won a victory in Munster against a group of other Scandinavians and renegade Irish  (<span class="italic">Ann. Ulster</span>, s.a. 856). The late medieval &#145;fragmentary annals&#146; claim a victory for &Iacute;varr over a similar force in the following year. By 859 &Iacute;varr and &Oacute;l&aacute;f had allied with Cerball mac D&uacute;ngaile (<i>d</i>. 888), king of Osraige, and together they attacked the lands in Meath of the high-king M&aacute;el Sechnaill mac M&aacute;ele Ruanaid (<i>d</i>. 863). Cerball soon submitted to M&aacute;el Sechnaill, but it is likely that &Iacute;varr and &Oacute;l&aacute;f were the leaders of those &#145;foreigners&#146; (that is, vikings) whom the annals record as the allies of the northern U&iacute; N&eacute;ill king &Aacute;ed Findliath mac N&eacute;ill (<i>d</i>. 879) in his campaigns in Meath in the following two years. The alliance did not last. In 863, in conjunction with Lorc&aacute;n, king of Meath, and together with another viking leader named Auisl, &Iacute;varr and &Oacute;l&aacute;f plundered the territory of &Aacute;ed's nephew Flann mac Conaing, including the spiritually significant Boyne tumuli of Knowth, Dowth, and Newgrange. The enmity with &Aacute;ed thus created may account for &Iacute;varr's absence from Irish sources, and from Ireland, for the next eight years.<br>
<br>Direct authority for the presence of an &Iacute;varr among the leadership of the &#145;great heathen army&#146; that arrived in England in the autumn of 865 is not contemporary, appearing first in the Latin version of the chronicle written by &AElig;thelweard (<i>d</i>. 998?), where the name is given as Iguuar. The ninth-century <span class="roman">Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</span>, the most contemporary source, does not name him in its annals recording the army's progress, but indicates his status by naming him in connection with an event in which he took no part, the defeat of &#145;the brother of Ingwaer and Healfdene [H&aacute;lfdan]&#146; in Devon in 878  (<span class="italic">ASC</span>, s.a. 878). Later sources tell of three brothers who were leaders of the army. As well as <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/49260/', "H&#225;lfdan")</script>, text F of the <span class="roman">Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</span> names Ubba along with &Iacute;varr as heading the army in East Anglia, and the life of St Oswald by Byrhtferth (<i>fl</i>. <i>c</i>.986&#150;<i>c</i>.1016) records that Oswald's grandfather had come to England from Scandinavia in the army led by Huba and Hinwaer. In addition, the life of St Edmund by Abbo of Fleury (<i>d</i>. 1004) makes Igwaer the conqueror of East Anglia. On the assumption that these sources are correct in identifying this &Iacute;varr as a leader of the great army, his movements can be traced through the <span class="roman">Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</span>'s record of the progress of the army through England. After wintering in East Anglia from autumn 865, the army moved to York, which it took on 1 November 866. A Northumbrian attempt to retake the city was repelled and the Northumbrian kings Osberht and &AElig;lle killed on 21 March 867. The vikings established Ecgberht as their puppet king in the north before moving, in the autumn of 867, to Nottingham in Mercia. The army returned to York in 868, staying for a year before crossing Mercia to Thetford in East Anglia. At this point they engaged the East Angles, killing their king Edmund (<i>d</i>. 869).<br>
<br>According to &AElig;thelweard, &Iacute;varr died shortly afterwards. The failure of the main West Saxon source, the <span class="roman">Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</span>, to mention &Iacute;varr in its record for the ensuing years, and his appearance in its annal for 878 only with the implication that he was no longer present, indicates that he did not participate in the army's campaign in Wessex, which began in the autumn or early winter of 870 with its move to Reading. Irish sources, however, suggest that &AElig;thelweard's date for &Iacute;varr's death is wrong. The annals of Ulster record a siege of &#145;Ail Cluaithe&#146; by &#145;Amla&iacute;b and &Iacute;mar&#146; in 870  (<span class="italic">Ann. Ulster</span>, s.a. 869; <i>recte</i> 870). It is hard to avoid the conclusion that these were the same &Oacute;l&aacute;f and &Iacute;varr who had been partners in Irish campaigns in the 850s and early 860s and that the chronological coincidence of the disappearance of the name &Iacute;varr from the English scene with its reappearance in Ireland indicates the identity of the two. &#145;Ail Cluaithe&#146; is a reference to Dumbarton, the chief fortress of the British kingdom of Strathclyde. &Iacute;varr, it seems, having plundered Northumbria, Mercia, and East Anglia, had resuscitated his old alliance with &Oacute;l&aacute;f, and the two are recorded as returning to Dublin from Scotland in the next year &#145;with two hundred ships, bringing away with them in captivity to Ireland a great prey of Angles and Britons and Picts&#146;  (ibid., s.a. 870; <i>recte</i> 871).<br>
<br>According to the annals of Ulster, &Iacute;varr died in 873, &#145;king of the Norsemen of all Ireland and Britain&#146;  (<span class="italic">Ann. Ulster</span>, s.a. 872; <i>recte</i> 873). He is the only viking so described in a contemporary source. If the identity between the Irish and English &Iacute;varrs is accepted, then the sheer range of his activities helps to justify this title. Later traditions suggest a high, perhaps unique, prominence among ninth-century viking leaders. Many of the generation that ruled the vikings at Dublin and York in the first half of the tenth century are named in Irish sources as &#145;the grandsons of &Iacute;varr&#146;, including <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/49264/', "Ragnall (d. 920/21)")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25543/', "Sihtric C&#225;ech (d. 927)")</script>. One of his sons, Sigfrid, ruled in Dublin from <i>c</i>.881 until 888, when he was killed by his brother, probably named Sihtric (Sigtryggr in Norse), who was himself slain in 896. First named as the son of the more or less legendary Ragnarr Lodbr&oacute;k by the eleventh-century writer Adam of Bremen, &Iacute;varr was given a prominent place in the Icelandic saga tradition of the twelfth century and later, in which he acquired the obscure epithet inn Beinlausi (the Boneless), which may refer to a snake-like attribute, continuing an association in the saga literature in which Ragnarr died in a snake-pit and another son, Sigurd, bore the epithet Orm-&iacute;-Auga (Snake-in-the-Eye). English sources such as Abbo of Fleury's life of St Edmund and text F of the <span class="roman">Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</span> make &Iacute;varr responsible for the martyrdom of the East Anglian king Edmund. Later Scandinavian sources claim that he disposed of both King &AElig;lle of Northumbria and King Edmund by means of the bloodthirsty, and probably fictitious, &#145;blood-eagle&#146; ritual, in which the victim's ribs were hacked from his spine and his lungs drawn out through his back.<br>
