<span class="headword">Coade,  Thorold Francis</span>  (1896&#150;1963), <span class="occ">headmaster</span>, was born in Dublin on 3 July 1896, the only son of the Revd Charles Edward Coade and his wife, Jessie Wilhelmine Spencer. He was educated at Glebe House School, Hunstanton, and at Harrow School (1910&#150;15), where he became head of the headmaster's house. He then went to the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, and in 1916 to France with the Loyal North Lancashire regiment. There he was wounded on the Somme, losing an ear-drum when a bomb exploded in the trench; when he left hospital he was transferred to East Anglia.<br>
<br>On demobilization Coade went up to Christ Church, Oxford, on the shortened degree course in English. In 1921 he passed with distinction. Meanwhile, following in her father's line, his only sister, Eileen, went up to Oxford to read theology, in which she gained a first class in 1924. While at Oxford, Coade rekindled his youthful interest in drama, especially production, and also played golf for the university. In 1922, having been introduced to her by his sister, he married Kathleen Eleanor, daughter of Harold Hugh Hardy, a businessman. They had two daughters. In 1922 he returned as an assistant master to Harrow, for which he always retained a romantic attachment. But his experience there gave insufficient scope for his widening vision.<br>
<br>In those ten years at Harrow, however, Coade's imagination was released through his wife's affection and rapport. They both loved poetry and the arts, and she was always to share deeply in his thoughts. In 1931 he began residential conferences for schoolmasters at Harrow.<br>
<br>By 1932 Coade was restive for change and looking for opportunity, and in that year he was appointed to the headship of Bryanston School. The school had been founded only four years before and its founding headmaster had resigned. It was a time of crisis when institutions of all kinds were at grave financial risk. Perhaps only the school's governors detected beneath Coade's shy unpretentious exterior his unswerving determination and purpose, supported by his Christian faith. With him at its centre, often almost hidden, the school passed from its troubled though exciting, seemingly eccentric, beginnings to its acceptance at large as an interesting experiment until, after about twenty years, it became recognized nationally as a remarkable creation.<br>
<br>Bryanston offered Coade an almost clear field. An appreciable number of ideas he inherited from his predecessor, and some he borrowed from others, but their management and interaction were his creative own. Private study was encouraged as a method of work, after a modified Dalton plan; the competitive spirit was reduced, there was no corporal punishment or private fagging, prefects were given responsibility not privilege. Relationships between masters and boys were less inhibited, more relaxed, than elsewhere. There was much opportunity for self-expression in the visual arts, in music, and for other creative uses of leisure. Estate work replaced the conventional training corps (except during the Second World War), and boys were deliberately given more free time than at other schools. When Coade was taunted as headmaster of a school where &#145;the boys do what they like&#146;, he replied that &#145;they like what they do&#146;. A merry debunker, capable of witty asides that were often devastating, he could nevertheless be stern, even adamant. Compassion and tenderness were, however, his signal qualities.<br>
<br>Coade produced many school plays. One of his finest achievements was in the summer of 1954 when he produced the Chester mystery plays in the Greek theatre at Bryanston with over a hundred boys and girls from the sister school of Cranborne Chase taking part.<br>
<br>Coade shunned the limelight and was rarely prominent, for instance in the Headmasters' Conference. However, he was much in demand at conferences because of his wise and witty interventions. He could seldom meet strangers (or parents) half-way. His personality was complex, yet his presence gave reassurance, inspiring trust and confidence. He drew staff and others to him, leading them into strong partnership. For him wholeness, the balance and harmony of a boy's entire person, was the purpose of education, as is recognized so widely today. Over-specialization and narrowness of any kind was an intrusion into adolescence. Through creative encounters and relationships, a boy's imagination and talent can be captured for life itself. For Coade, therefore, the use of leisure, and through it self-discovery and realization, rang truer than the pursuit of outer objectives.<br>
<br>A man of ideas but still more of ideals, it was as if they came elusively to use Coade as their interpreter. His sight was more intuitive than observing, and his love of others was grounded in the faith that shaped his personality. The unifying thread was for him the awakening of mind, body, and spirit in each unique adolescent boy and their harnessing to the purposes of God, the Spirit moving where it will. &#145;You cannot teach boys to be religious&#146;, he said, &#145;for they are religious already.&#146; <span class="italic">God with Us</span> by S. L. Frank, translated by N. Duddington (1946), was of central importance to him.<br>
<br>After twenty-six years the governors of Bryanston invited Coade to remain for a further five, but ill health compelled him to retire a year later, in 1959. Although one of the less well known, he was among the greatest headmasters of his time. He died at his home, Old Bell Cottage, at East Knoyle, Salisbury, not far from the school, on 1 February 1963.<br>
<br>Coade's published work included &#145;Education for leisure&#146; in <span class="italic">Education of Today</span> (1935, ed. E. D. Laborde), and &#145;The new term&#146; (<span class="italic">The Spectator</span>, 1937). He edited <span class="italic">Harrow Lectures in Education</span> (1931), and <span class="italic">Manhood in the Making</span> (1939), to which he contributed an essay entitled &#145;Maturity&#146;. A posthumous selection of his papers forms <span class="italic">The Burning Bow</span> (1966), which includes an epilogue, &#145;Beneath his skin&#146;, contributed by Kathleen Coade.<br>
