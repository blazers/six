<span class="headword">Chamberlain,  Arthur</span>  (1842&#150;1913), <span class="occ">industrialist</span>, was born on 11 April 1842 at 3 Grove Hill Terrace, Camberwell, Surrey, the third of six sons of Joseph Chamberlain (1796&#150;1874), a wholesale shoe manufacturer, and Caroline, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Harben (1808&#150;1875), daughter of a wealthy provision merchant. His eldest brother was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32350/', "Joseph Chamberlain (1836&#150;1914)")</script>, the politician and tariff reformer; the other brothers were Richard, Herbert, Walter, and Frank, who died early. There were also three sisters.<br>
<br>Arthur and Joseph Chamberlain both spent two years at University College School in London. On leaving school at the age of sixteen, Arthur followed Joseph into the wood-screw business of Nettlefold and Chamberlain in Birmingham, in which, in 1854, his father, Nettlefold's brother-in-law, had invested an initial &pound;10,000 and then more, adding his name to that of the firm. The family sold out in 1874, soon after Joseph entered politics in the late 1860s. Like others in his family Arthur Chamberlain married a Kenrick, namely Louisa, daughter of Timothy Kenrick, on 3 June 1870. They had two sons, Arthur (1880&#150;1941) and John (1881&#150;1917), who was killed in Flanders, and seven daughters, before Louisa died in 1892.<br>
<br>Arthur Chamberlain, while helping his brother in his political campaigns, remained a businessman all his life, building up a series of major Birmingham metal concerns. His arrival was not welcomed by Nettlefold and, in 1863, his father put him in charge of another of his interests in Birmingham, Smith and Chamberlain, brassfounders, which Arthur took into electric fittings. In 1883 Arthur himself (with partner George Hookham) developed Chamberlain and Hookham, next door in New Bartholomew Street. In 1886 the latter firm won the contract to install electric light in Birmingham Art Gallery but subsequently concentrated on the manufacture of meters, later becoming part of GEC. By 1891, when it was registered as a company, Chamberlain had entered the tube trade through the firm next door, Endurance Seamless Tube and Vial Company. As Endurance Tube and Engineering, this opened a factory in King's Norton in 1896. His co-directors were his son-in-law John Sutton Nettlefold and George Hookham, while his son John worked for Chamberlain and Hookham.<br>
<br>The big step in Chamberlain's expanding career was his rescue of Kynoch, a cartridge manufacturer, in Witton and Stirchley in Birmingham. Called in by the shareholders in 1888, he became chairman in 1889, remaining so for the rest of his life, and was succeeded by his son John. Chamberlain now showed his restructuring genius, making many redundant but sorting out the works, costs, stock, and purchasing, selling off operations not considered &#145;core&#146; but also buying new rolling mills to ensure supplies. In eight years he doubled capacity in existing products and added many new lines, pushing into the munitions business in explosives and taking over several other firms. Employment rose from 2000 in 1892 to 6000 in 1904 in nine works scattered round the UK.<br>
<br>But expansion was too rapid and 1906&#150;12 saw reduced profits, lost contracts, and redundancies and the tide turned in 1913, at the time of Chamberlain's death. However, he had laid the foundations of the metals and explosives division of what became ICI and survives, hived off, as Imperial Metal Industries (IMI).<br>
<br>Chamberlain was also director or chairman of other concerns, some bought through the Birmingham Investment Trust, in which the family were influential. In the mid-1890s he took over another ailing Birmingham firm, Weldless Tube, and merged it with others, only to be hit by the collapse of the cycle boom. These firms were reconstructed into Tubes in 1898, to form the nucleus of Tube Investments in 1919. His son and grandson, both called Arthur, were involved in the management into the 1950s. Other investments were made in Hoskins &amp; Son, makers of ships' berths, though this was managed by his nephew Neville Chamberlain, and Elliotts Metal, makers of ships' sheathing.<br>
<br>In December 1900, when Joseph Chamberlain was advocating war, Lloyd George attacked the Chamberlains for holding shares in companies with government munitions contracts. Joseph defended the right of his family, not involved in political careers, to normal business ventures  (Marsh, 569).<br>
<br>Arthur Chamberlain was also a business leader in the Birmingham chamber of commerce and the Association of UK Chambers of Commerce and the Empire in the 1900s. He became a JP in 1884 and was chairman of the licensing committee in Birmingham from 1893 to 1903, working to reduce drunkenness. His approach clashed with Joseph's views. Arthur Chamberlain was a free trader. After 1900 he also publicly opposed his brother's views on protection, a rift between them emerging from 1903 to 1906. Chamberlain preached to his employees and wrote in articles in the <span class="italic">Manchester Guardian</span> and <span class="italic">Birmingham Post</span> that competition promoted invention. He disliked state controls or indeed any red tape, and opposed both trade unions and employers' associations.<br>
<br>Two other activities make him an interesting man in a wider frame. First, he wrote <span class="italic">The Book of Business</span> (printed privately in 1899) for the confidential use of his children. This reveals his personal views on business management. Only a flavour of its wisdom can be included here. He wrote that &#145;the real interest of business &hellip; consists, not in money making, but its variety, and the constant call it makes on your courage, your judgement, your energy, or your patience, at uncertain, and unexpected, but very frequent intervals&#146;  (Chamberlain, 1). A well-managed business was one that &#145;can support the unexpected absence of the principal&#146;. His children were advised not to sit on &#145;addled eggs&#146; (or lame ducks) but to expect 10 or 20 per cent return on capital.<br>
<br>The second activity was Chamberlain's interest in education and his involvement, with his brother Joseph (though more briefly), in the establishment of the faculty of commerce in the new University of Birmingham. In his <span class="italic">Book of Business</span> he recommended that commercial managers should pass the professional examinations in accountancy and master two languages (French and Spanish rather than German, as the Germans controlled no colonies), residing in each country for three months. They should spend six months in a machine shop to learn &#145;about the British workman, his habits and customs, his strengths and weaknesses, his vices and virtues&#146; as he is &#145;the most important of all the machines&#146; in the works  (Chamberlain, 9, 16).<br>
<br>For the university, Arthur Chamberlain provided a practical business syllabus for a three-year course which may have influenced the faculty's first dean, William Ashley. He advised Ashley that &#145;if Tommy goes home and talks about balance sheets, father will think there is something&#146; in the new courses  (Chamberlain, 20n.).<br>
<br>He was himself a fair, strict, paternalist employer, putting wages up to 22<i>s</i>. a week for male workers in 1903, after the Rowntree inquiry showed that 21<i>s</i>. 8<i>d</i>. was a minimum living wage for a man, wife, and three children. He was one of the first to reduce the working week from sixty to forty-eight hours in 1890, and he gave clerks and foremen fourteen days paid holiday and a pension after ten years' service.<br>
<br>Chamberlain was a Unitarian like his brother and attended the church of the Messiah in Broad Street, Birmingham. He lived at Moor Green Hall in Moseley in Birmingham, his garden in those days adjoining that of his brother Joseph in Highbury Hall. After three or four years confined to a wheelchair, he died of cancer on 19 October 1913 at Cadhay House, Ottery St Mary, Devon, where he lived during the winter.<br>
