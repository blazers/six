<span class="headword">Beckett <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Bousfield; <em>other married name </em>Thomas]</span>,  Frances Sarah <span class="st"> [Fanny]</span></span>  (<em>bap. </em>1821, <em>d.</em> 1902), <span class="occ">philanthropist and a founder of Scottish Home Industries</span>, was baptized on 27 June 1821, at Frimley, Surrey, the only child of George Thomas Frederick Bousfield, solicitor, and his wife, Elizabeth Dingley. Frances Bousfield married Lieutenant Frederick William Leopold Thomas RN on 2 December 1841 at the parish church of St Paul, Deptford, London.<br>
<br>In 1857 Mrs Thomas accompanied her husband, by that time a captain, to Harris in the Outer Hebrides, where he was working on the Scottish hydrographical survey. While living on Harris, her attention was drawn to the extreme poverty of the islanders. Following a tour of investigation she formulated a means of developing a local economy through the home industries of the women islanders. Having been presented with a pair of hand-knitted stockings, she resolved to teach the women to knit and shape well. On returning to Edinburgh she promoted the knitted work and developed markets for Harris stockings and socks through an agency which she opened in Edinburgh in 1859. Together with Catherine Murray, Lady Dunmore, she was a principal force behind the cultivation of the Harris tweed industry through the marketing and sale of Harris tweed. The success of these home industries was such that at the Edinburgh Exhibition of 1886 Harris stockings were awarded first prize, and the tweeds gained the medal for excellence of make. It was the belief of a Harris minister that more families would have been destitute, had it not been for the efforts of Mrs Thomas. Several hundred women were employed in the home industries, and the textiles proved to be more remunerative than the land and fishing during the early 1880s.<br>
<br>Mrs Thomas moved to London in 1888 and opened a depot in Berners Street. This was a seminal step in the development of the Scottish Home Industries, which became a limited company in 1896. She became one of seven directors of the Scottish Home Industries Association Ltd, with the duchess of Sutherland as president.<br>
<br>Not long after moving to London, and by now a widow, Fanny Thomas married a widower, James Flowers Beckett, retired naval officer, at All Saints' Church, Paddington, on 2 July 1890; they lived at his house, Avondel, Hollington Park, St Leonards, Sussex. Besides her involvement in the tweed industry she undertook a number of other philanthropic projects on Harris, including the education of children of the poorer ministers, and the building of the Free Church and manse at Tarbert in 1860. She is thought to have helped over 800 people to emigrate from Harris to Queensland and Canada. In 1897 she built and endowed a cottage at Manish to provide a village nurse.<br>
<br>In his evidence given to the Napier commission of 1883, the Reverend Roderick Mackenzie of Tarbert stated, &#145;Harris, perhaps, owes more to her than to anybody else&#146;  (&#145;Royal commission of inquiry&#146;). Appreciation of Frances Beckett's services in promoting the interests of the Harris and Lewis crofters was formally recorded at a meeting of directors of the Scottish Home Industries Association following her death. Frances Sarah Beckett died on 7 September 1902, at Morningside Drive, Craighouse, Edinburgh, from cerebral thrombosis. She was survived by her second husband.<br>
