<span class="headword">Chamberlain,  Basil Hall</span> <span class="st"> [<em>called </em>&#332;d&#333;]</span>  (1850&#150;1935), <span class="occ">Japanologist</span>, was born on 18 October 1850 in Southsea, Hampshire, the eldest son of William Charles Chamberlain (1818&#150;1878), an admiral in the British navy, and his wife, Eliza Jane (1825?&#150;1856?), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/11944/', "Captain Basil Hall RN")</script>, travel writer. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32349/', "Houston Stewart Chamberlain")</script> was his brother. His upbringing was cosmopolitan. He started travelling and learning a foreign language from the age of two. In 1856, after his mother's death, Chamberlain and his two brothers moved from England to Versailles, where his paternal grandmother lived. He was educated at the Lyc&eacute;e Imp&eacute;rial there and passed the <i>baccalaur&eacute;at</i> examination. In Versailles he also received instruction from a German governess.<br>
<br>Due to a change in the family plans Chamberlain started working for Barings Bank in London in 1869, instead of going to Oxford University. Within a few months he had a nervous breakdown and left the bank. It was in the hope of regaining health that in November 1872 he boarded a sailer from the Thames, and started on a voyage which finally brought him to Yokohama, Japan, in May 1873. Japan in 1873 retained enough of her traditional civilization to fascinate Chamberlain. At the same time there were modernizing trends which ensured a strong demand for Western teachers, and Chamberlain remained in Japan as a teacher at the naval academy. Already a polyglot, he started learning Japanese with great enthusiasm. Within three years he knew enough Japanese to undertake serious work as a Japanologist.<br>
<br>With his numerous publications, such as &#145;The language, mythology, and geographical nomenclature of Japan viewed in the light of Aino studies&#146;  (<span class="italic">Memoirs of the Literature College, Imperial University of Japan</span>, 1887), <span class="italic">A Handbook of Colloquial Japanese</span> (1887), and &#145;Essay in aid of a grammar and dictionary of the Luchuan language&#146;  (<span class="italic">Transactions of the Asiatic Society of Japan</span>, 23, 1895, suppl.), Chamberlain made a pioneering and pivotal contribution to the study of the Japanese language. His translation of <span class="italic">Kojiki</span> (&#145;Records of ancient matters&#146;&#151;Japan's oldest extant book dating back to <span class="smallcap">AD</span> 712), published in 1883, was also a very important contribution to the study of ancient Japanese history because of the rigorous critical scrutiny of the earliest Japanese records that appeared in his translator's introduction.<br>
<br>Chamberlain became professor of Japanese and philology of the Imperial University (later the University of Tokyo) in 1886. It was a reflection of the exceptionally high regard he had won from the Japanese that, still in his early forties and having taught at the university for only four years until 1890, he was made an emeritus professor in 1891.<br>
<br>From around 1890 the focus of his writing shifted to books for the general reader. <span class="italic">Things Japanese</span> (1890), for a long time the most handy and reliable guidebook on Japanese culture, and <span class="italic">A Handbook for Travellers in Japan</span> (a Murray's handbook originally written by E. M. Satow and A. G. S. Hawes, and revised by Chamberlain and G. B. Mason from the third edition published in 1891), were updated repeatedly. He also published several volumes of translations of Japanese fairy tales. He returned to Europe for good in 1911 and retired in Geneva, Switzerland. A few months after completing the manuscript of the sixth edition of <span class="italic">Things Japanese</span> (published posthumously in 1939), he died, unmarried, at the H&ocirc;tel Richemond, Geneva, on 15 February 1935. He was buried in the St Georges cemetery on the 18th.<br>
<br>Chamberlain was one of the rare European intellectuals of real stature who devoted the best part of their lives to the study of Japan. He was not a rebel against his own civilization. His two French books published during his retirement, <span class="italic">Huit si&egrave;cles de po&eacute;sie fran&ccedil;aise</span> (1927) and <span class="italic">&hellip; encore est vive la souris: pens&eacute;es et r&eacute;flexions</span> (1933), amply demonstrate how well he was grounded in European culture. His appearance&#151;he was tall and wore a beard&#151;was also that of a typical British gentleman. However, his remarkable command of Japanese, coupled with his kindly, tolerant, democratic personality, enabled him to establish a wonderful rapport, not only with intellectuals but also with common people of Japan, such as his servants. He also visited almost every prefecture in Japan. His solid knowledge and appreciation of Japan has tended to be underestimated because of the impression, more apparent than real, that he was Eurocentric. It is true that he candidly criticized some aspects of Japan, but awareness of the existence of more than one legitimate point of view made him free from any rigid Eurocentrism. His unpublished letters reveal that his attachment to Japan had an intensity hitherto unsuspected. His world was an ellipse with two foci&#151;Japan and Europe. He became uprooted because he could not choose between Europe and Japan, both of which he loved, and he continued to swing between the two (he made six journeys to Europe during his years in Japan). Intense expressions of homesickness for Japan, found in his letters written after his retirement in Geneva, show that his return to Europe did not mean a renunciation of Japan and a spiritual return to Europe, as it was often interpreted. His unpublished letters, together with two volumes of his published letters to Lafcadio Hearn, a talented popular writer on Japan whom he befriended, document a fascinating drama of cultural contact played out in the soul of an individual.<br>
