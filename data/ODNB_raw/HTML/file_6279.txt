<span class="headword">Coppock,  James</span>  (1798&#150;1857), <span class="occ">election agent</span>, was born at Stockport on 2 September 1798, the eldest son of William Coppock, a mercer of that town. He was educated at the school of the Revd Mr Higginson, Unitarian minister of Stockport. After serving an apprenticeship in his father's business, he was placed as a clerk with a wholesale haberdasher in London. He afterwards ventured a small amount of capital as a partner in a silk firm, but, owing to commercial disasters following on the French Revolution of 1830, he lost it all. He married in 1829.<br>
<br>After careful consideration, Coppock resolved to enter the legal profession, and in 1832 articled himself to a solicitor in Furnival's Inn. He was admitted on the roll of attorneys in 1836. He had always been an active politician, and took a prominent part in the contest during the first election for Finsbury after the <span class="roman">Reform Act</span> of 1832. After the second general election under the act, on the formation of the County Registration Society by the Liberal Party, with branches throughout England, Coppock was appointed secretary, with a residence in the society's rooms at 3 Cleveland Row, St James's. These rooms were the rendezvous of agents and solicitors from all parts of the country, and, by his rapid decisions and sound judgement, Coppock quickly became a power in politics. With F. R. Bonham on the Conservative side and Joseph Parkes with him on the radical, Coppock was a founder of centralized political organization.<br>
<br>When, a few years later, the society's operations ceased, Coppock took the lease of the premises in Cleveland Row, and established himself as a solicitor and parliamentary agent. From this time forward there was scarcely a contested return before the House of Commons in which he had not an active interest. The coolness and daring with which he fought his opponents with their own weapons became proverbial. He helped to establish the London Reform Club and, after briefly serving as its secretary in 1836, he was elected an honorary life member, and appointed its solicitor.<br>
<br>Although in his day no man was a fiercer partisan, Coppock was respected by friend and foe. In the August before his death he received the appointment of county court treasurer, but business, both private and public, of a harassing nature accumulated, and the strain of overwork was too great. He died at his house in Cleveland Row, London, on 19 December 1857.<br>
