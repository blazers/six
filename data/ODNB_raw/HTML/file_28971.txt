<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Weever,  John</span>  (1575/6&#150;1632), <span class="occ">poet and antiquary</span>, was born in Preston, Lancashire, to &#145;poor but religious parents&#146;, and received an excellent education &#145;by the care of his uncle Thomas&#146;  (Whittle, 198). This may have been Thomas Langton, from whom Weever later wrote that he had &#145;received many favours&#146;  (Honigmann, <span class="italic">Weever</span>, 7), and Weever's father may have been &#145;Johne Weyver&#146;, one of thirteen followers of Langton who were tried for murder in 1590 after a riot at Lea Hall, Lancashire. Weever also addressed Henry Butler of Rawcliffe, Lancashire, as his uncle, but the precise blood relationship of the two men is uncertain.<br>
<br>On 30 April 1594 Weever was admitted as a sizar to Queens' College, Cambridge. His first tutor there was the Lancashireman William Covell, whose <span class="italic">Polimanteia</span> (1595) contains one of the first printed notices of Shakespeare, along with praise for several other poets. Later Weever studied under Robert Pearson, whom he referred to more than thirty years later as a &#145;reverend, learned divine&#146;, to whom he was &#145;bound to acknowledge all thankfulness&#146;  (Weever, 864). Weever's BA supplicat was submitted on 16 April 1598, and the grace was conceded on the same day. While he had apparently considered taking holy orders, instead he went to London after graduation and immersed himself in the city's literary scene.<br>
<br>In late 1599 Weever's <span class="italic">Epigrammes in the Oldest Cut, and Newest Fashion</span> was published in London. The front matter contains commendatory verses by Cambridge friends and an address &#145;To the Generous Readers&#146; in which the author apologizes for the epigrams being out of date by a year. He dedicated the volume to Richard Hoghton, high sheriff of Lancashire, and also included six other dedications to prominent Lancashire residents, one before each of the seven &#145;weeks&#146; into which the book is divided.<br>
<br>Many of the epigrams appear to have been written while Weever was at Cambridge, since they are addressed to fellow students or professors, in many cases invoking puns on the subject's name. However, he also addressed several epigrams to contemporary literary figures. &#145;Ad Gulielmum Shakespear&#146; is the earliest known complete poem addressed to Shakespeare, and is also the only poem in the volume to take the form of a Shakespearian sonnet. He also addressed poems to Michael Drayton, Edward Alleyn, Samuel Daniel, John Marston and Ben Jonson, William Warner, and Edmund Spenser (then recently dead). In the same year, Weever also wrote commendatory verses for his Cambridge friend Henry Buttes's <span class="italic">Dyet's Dry Dinner</span>.<br>
<br>In 1600 Weever published a curious volume called <span class="italic">Faunus and Melliflora</span>, dedicated to Sir Edward Stanley of Lancashire. The first part consists of an Ovidian erotic poem influenced by Shakespeare's <span class="italic">Venus and Adonis</span>, but after a thousand lines this changes abruptly to a mythological account of the origin of satires, followed by translations of satires by Horace, Persius, and Juvenall. The volume concludes with a reference to the burning of satirical books ordered by the archbishop of Canterbury and bishop of London in London on 4 June 1599 and an ironic &#145;Prophecie&#146; in which Weever alludes to the satires of Joseph Hall and John Marston, pretending to rebuke those men for making fun of the current age.<br>
<br>In 1601 an anonymous satirical pamphlet called <span class="italic">The Whipping of the Satyre</span> was published, which Davenport persuasively argued was written by Weever. The book attacks three people called the Satirist, the Epigrammatist, and the Humorist, probably representing John Marston, Everard Guilpin, and Ben Jonson. Weever's authorship seems to have been widely guessed, and he came in for some counter-attacks. Honigmann argued that Weever is lampooned as Simplicius Faber in Marston's <span class="italic">What You Will</span>, Shift in Jonson's <span class="italic">Every Man out of his Humour</span>, and Asinius Bubo in Thomas Dekker's <span class="italic">Satiromastix</span>. These works portray Weever as a small man and a lover of tobacco (both characteristics admitted by Weever in his own writings), a hanger-on of Jonson, and possibly a homosexual. Weever may also have been lampooned as Ingenioso, a former Cambridge student searching for a patron, in the three Cambridge-produced plays of 1598&#150;1601 known as the Parnassus plays.<br>
<br>Weever appears to have been tiring of these wars of words by 1601, for in that year he also published two works which suggest that he was hoping for a career in the church after all. <span class="italic">The Mirror of Martyrs</span> is a 1464-line narrative poem about the life and death of proto-protestant martyr Sir John Oldcastle, written as part of the backlash against Shakespeare's Falstaff (originally named Oldcastle). It is heavily influenced by Christopher Middleton's <span class="italic">The Legend of Humphrey Duke of Glocester</span> (1600), for which Weever had written commendatory verses, and John Bale's 1544 life of Oldcastle. Weever's other religious work of 1601 was <span class="italic">An Agnus Dei</span>, a pedestrian verse history of Jesus Christ published as a tiny book less than 2 inches square. Later editions came out in 1603, 1606, and 1610, probably published for the book's novelty value rather than for any literary merit.<br>
<br>After this burst of publication, Weever appears to have left London for a few years. In April 1603 he was in York for King James's procession from Scotland to London, and early in the reign of James he was at Kendal in Lancashire to witness a Corpus Christi play. He may have settled in Lancashire for a time, since in 1609 he signed depositions in a chancery suit there. However, at some undetermined point he returned to London, married a woman named Anne, and bought a house in the parish of St James's, Clerkenwell. He may be the John &#145;Weaver&#146; who married Anne Edwards at St James's, Clerkenwell, on 25 July 1614, or the man of the same name who married Anne Panting in the same parish on 21 October 1617, or he may be neither of these.<br>
<br>During the first three decades of the seventeenth century, Weever travelled &#145;at painful expense&#146; throughout England and the continent collecting inscriptions from funeral monuments, an interest he had exhibited as early as the <span class="italic">Epigrammes</span>. He claimed to have travelled through most of England and parts of Scotland, as well as to Italy, France, and Germany. About 1620 he befriended the herald Augustine Vincent, who gave him access to the records of the heralds' office and introduced him to Sir Robert Cotton and many other antiquaries.<br>
<br>In 1631 Weever published a portion of his findings in a 900-page folio volume entitled <span class="italic">Ancient Funerall Monuments</span>. This contains inscriptions from Canterbury, Rochester, London, and Norwich, interlarded with Weever's commentary and poetical extracts ranging from the ancients to works of the late 1620s. The frontispiece has a portrait of Weever, giving his age as fifty-five. Two notebooks in Weever's hand, containing an early draft of this work along with much unpublished material, survive as Society of Antiquaries manuscripts 127 and 128. The folio and notebooks preserve many inscriptions which have since been lost, and are thus invaluable to present-day historians and biographers.<br>
<br>Weever did not live long after the publication of his <i>magnum opus</i>. He made his will on 16 February 1632, and probate was granted on 29 March to his widow, Anne, who received the bulk of his estate. The will mentions houses in Gray's Inn Lane and Clerkenwell, and makes bequests to a brother, William, and to sisters Alice Cawthorne, Anne Caton, and Isabel Holt. A monument was erected to Weever in his parish church, where he was buried, but this does not survive; however, the verses from it were preserved by Anthony Munday in his 1633 edition of John Stow's <span class="italic">Survey of London</span>.<br>
