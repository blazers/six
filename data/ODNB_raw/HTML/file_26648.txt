<span class="headword">Stratford,  Robert</span>  (<em>c.</em>1292&#150;1362), <span class="occ">administrator and bishop of Chichester</span>, was the son of Robert and Isabel Stratford, the younger brother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26645/', "Archbishop John Stratford (d. 1348)")</script>, and the uncle of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26647/', "Bishop Ralph Stratford (d. 1354)")</script>. Their family took its name from Stratford upon Avon, Warwickshire. Robert was probably born in the 1290s, since he was ordained deacon in 1318, granted letters dimissory for the priesthood in the same year, and assumed his first benefice, Overbury rectory, Worcester diocese, in October 1317. He studied at Oxford where he was MA by 1330&#151;when he was licensed to have an oratory in his lodgings&#151;and scholar in theology by May 1335, when his election as chancellor of the university was confirmed by the diocesan, Bishop Henry Burghersh (<i>d</i>. 1340). Despite non-residence and promotion as royal chancellor he retained his university office, the first example of a practice common in the following century, but he had vacated it by November 1338. He successfully suppressed the rival university established at Stamford in 1333&#150;4, and in 1336 secured royal confirmation of university privileges. In March 1345 he was commissioned to inquire into student obstruction of royal justices investigating disorders in Oxford.<br>
<br>Inevitably Stratford's career was intertwined with that of his brother. Thus he was granted leave of absence from his rectory of Stratford upon Avon&#151;for which he had exchanged Overbury&#151;to attend John Stratford when the latter was archdeacon of Lincoln. He was abroad with him in 1320 and acted as his steward and vicar-general (appointed on 2 December 1324) on his promotion to the see of Winchester. He was made a papal chaplain on 7 February 1332. Fraternal influence, papal provision, and royal presentation helped Robert Stratford to secure a succession of canonries, though not without opposition. A canon of Wells and prebendary of Yatton in 1328, his position was still in dispute six years later when he was provided to the deanery there. This too was subject to litigation in the curia and he probably withdrew his claim following papal reservation to him, at the king's instance, of the archdeaconry of Canterbury (1334). Meanwhile by royal grant he had succeeded his brother as canon of Salisbury and prebendary of Charminster and Bere. As bishop of Winchester his brother was instrumental in securing for him prebends in Wherwell and Romsey abbeys. In 1330 he became prebendary of Aylesbury in Lincoln Cathedral, and also received canonries at St Paul's, London, and at Chichester, where he was elected bishop in mid-August 1337. The temporalities were restored on 21 September and he was consecrated on 30 November at Canterbury, bishops Orleton of Winchester (perhaps his consecrator), Wyville of Salisbury, and Hethe of Rochester being present. Shortly afterwards he was among those who escorted cardinals Gomez and Montfav&egrave;z to London. During the archbishop's absence abroad in 1338&#150;9 he acted as his vicar-general and convened convocation.<br>
<br>Stratford's episcopal register is not extant, but scattered <i>acta</i> have survived. He visited his chapter in 1337 and 1345 and in an attempt to solve a jurisdictional conflict between himself as bishop and the dean and chapter of Chichester he asked for his brother's arbitration. Both parties agreed to abide by the award, which was eventually delivered in 1340. However, its terms were resented by the dean and chapter, and a bull of 1355, known only from a later copy of an exemplification of 1478, purports to render it void.<br>
<br>Keeper of the great seal on his brother's behalf in 1331, 1332, and 1335, Robert Stratford was appointed chancellor of the exchequer on 16 October 1331, and held the office until 1334. He was chancellor of England between 24 March and 6 July 1338 and between 20 June and 1 December 1340, when the king abruptly dismissed both him and treasurer Roger Northburgh (<i>d</i>. 1358). According to a version of <span class="italic">The Brut</span> chronicle Edward threatened to detain them in the Tower of London, but they were released after Robert had expounded the canonical dangers of such procedure. He supported his brother against the king's charge that the archbishop had failed to provide the sinews of war, and with him and their nephew, the bishop of London, was temporarily excluded from the parliament of April 1341. Robert and Ralph Stratford were both members of the committees whose proposals for reform, subsequently enacted in a statute, ended the political crisis of that year. In May 1343 Robert Stratford was engaged in negotiations at Avignon and in 1345 was a member of the council of Lionel of Antwerp, guardian of the realm during the king's absence.<br>
<br>Stratford co-operated in the foundation of his brother's chantry college of St Thomas at Stratford upon Avon, secured grants of toll for paving the town during the 1330s, and assisted the Guild of the Holy Cross there. On the archbishop's death in 1348 he became his sole executor and was involved with his burial arrangements. He made his will and died at his manor of Aldingbourne in Sussex on 9 April 1362. Probate was granted on the 26th. His recumbent effigy lies in the south choir aisle of Chichester Cathedral.<br>
