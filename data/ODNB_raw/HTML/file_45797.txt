<span class="headword">Stack,  Mary Meta <span class="st"> [Mollie]</span>  Bagot</span>  (1883&#150;1935), <span class="occ">health and fitness expert</span>, was born on 12 June 1883 in Dublin, daughter of Richard Theodore Stack (<i>d</i>. 1909), dentist. Both her parents were of the Irish protestant professional class. She was educated at Alexandra School and Alexandra College, Dublin. In 1907 she began a course at Mrs Josef Conn's Institute of Physical Training in London. In 1909 she married Albert Thomas James McCreery, a doctor. It was a short-lived marriage, which ended in divorce and minor scandal. Meanwhile she had begun to train as a teacher at Mrs Conn's institute, where she spent a year as a tutor before moving to Manchester in 1910. There she set up her own centre, treating individual patients and teaching private classes. She also established large classes for factory girls.<br>
<br>On 10 March 1912 Mollie, as Stack was known, married her third cousin, Edward Hugh Bagot Stack (1884&#150;1914), a lieutenant in the Gurkha Rifles, and returned with him to India. Her first child died at birth in 1913, and in July 1914 a second child, <a href="#cosubject_103265">Prunella [<i>see below</i>]</a>, was born. Her husband was killed in France in the early months of the war, and Mollie returned to England. By 1920, to support herself and her family, she was holding small classes in her home, and in 1926 she set up her own school to train teachers, the Bagot Stack Health School. In 1930 she took a big step, away from the select private classes and away, too, from the special charity classes (though both would remain as peripheral activities throughout her career). She founded the Women's League of Health and Beauty, the first and most significant of the mass keep-fit movements of the inter-war period. League classes taught a combination of dance, callisthenics, and remedial, slimming, and rhythmical exercise to music; its magazine published pacifist and feminist political discussion as well as articles on general self-improvement. In 1931 she published <span class="italic">Building the Body Beautiful</span>.<br>
<br>The league was a self-supporting commercial enterprise, with the motto &#145;Movement is life&#146;; its stated aim was &#145;racial health&#146;, later changed, in 1936, to the more explicit &#145;racial health leading to peace&#146;. By the time of Stack's death, it claimed some 60,000 female members with franchise centres all over England. The league's success was based on its judicious appeal to an older, class-bound, service-motivated, maternal femininity, while having a modern, mass-market, commercial style, mixed with Stack's shrewd business sense and flamboyant publicity. Her advertising strategies included mass exercise demonstrations in Hyde Park and at the Albert Hall; a series of weekly exercise columns in the press; the production of gramophone recordings with music and exercise instructions; and the cultivation of a star image and fan following for her daughter, Prunella, &#145;the most physically perfect girl in the world&#146;.<br>
<br>Mollie Stack was a woman of great vision, enthusiasm, and vitality, whose physical presence was the best advertisement for her system. She was a fine public speaker, capable of inspiring devotion both to herself and to her cause. Numerous well-posed, attractive photographs of Mollie, Prunella, and other league teachers were published in the league magazine, <span class="italic">Mother and Daughter</span>. She died at her home, 11 Holland Park, London, of thyroid cancer, on 26 January 1935. Her body was cremated at Golders Green crematorium on 31 January.<br>
<br>Mollie Stack's only surviving child, <a name="cosubject_103265"></a><span class="headword">(Ann) Prunella Stack</span>  (1914&#150;2010), <span class="occ">health and fitness expert</span>, was born in India on 28 July 1914, and brought up by her mother following her father's early death. She was educated at the Abbey School in Malvern Wells, and was already famous by the age of twelve, posing at that age as the discobulus (discus thrower) in the British Museum in a photograph that was reproduced around the world. Taking over the reins of the Women's League for Health and Beauty from her ailing mother in the early 1930s, she was dubbed &#145;the perfect girl&#146; by the British press. In the period before the war, she led the league through a period of expansion, reaching a peak of 177,000 members in 1937. Though herself strikingly slim and beautiful, she emphasised that the league was for &#145;all shapes and sizes&#146;. In 1936 she led a display by 5000 members at London's Olympia, and in 1938 she led a league delegation to festivals in Hamburg; the following year she hosted a German contingent led by Frau Gertrud Scholtz-Klink, whom Hitler had described as &#145;the perfect Nazi woman&#146;. Prunella Stack had by then married, in Glasgow Cathedral on 15 October 1938, in what was described as the society wedding of the year, Lord David Douglas-Hamilton (1912&#150;1944), fourth and youngest son of the thirteenth duke of Hamilton. During the Second World War her husband (like his three brothers) joined the RAF, and distinguished himself commanding 603 City of Edinburgh squadron in the defence of Malta in 1942, but in August 1944 he crashed short of the runway on return to RAF Benson after a reconnaissance flight over northern France and was killed instantly, leaving his widow, Prunella, to bring up their two sons, Diarmid (<i>b</i>. 1940) and Iain (<i>b</i>. 1942). After the war she painstakingly rebuilt the league, and spread its international work, though it never achieved the levels of popular recognition that it had in the 1930s. In London she met an old friend, Alfred Gustave (Allie) Albers (1914&#150;1951), a South African surgeon who was then at Guy's Hospital. They married in Cape Town on 22 July 1950, but tragically he died less than a year later, in a climbing accident. She remained in South Africa for a few years, and in 1953, against the strongly-expressed wishes of the South African government, led a racially mixed delegation of South African Women's League for Health and Beauty members to London for the queen's coronation. She returned with her sons to London in 1956, and on 15 May 1964 she married the barrister and writer Brian St Quentin Power (1918&#150;2008). She continued to be active in the Women's League (re-named the Fitness League in 1999) into her nineties, and in 2010 she attended the eightieth anniversary celebration of its founding. She was appointed OBE in 1980. She died on 30 December 2010 at her London home, 14 Gertrude Street, Chelsea (she and her third husband, Brian, also owned a holiday home on Raasay, near Skye). She was survived by her two sons (one an astrophysicist, the other an elephant conservationist).<br>
