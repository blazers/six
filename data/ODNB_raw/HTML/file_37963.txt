<span class="headword">Simpson,  John</span>  (1614/15&#150;1662), <span class="occ">Fifth Monarchist preacher</span>, was baptized on 25 April 1615 at St Dunstan-in-the-East, London, the son of Fabian Sympson, gentleman, of St Dunstan-in-the-East, London. He matriculated at Exeter College, Oxford, on 2 December 1631, graduating BA on 30 April 1635 and proceeding MA on 18 January 1638. From 22 March 1642 he held lectureships at St Dunstan's, and from 29 April at St Botolph, Aldgate, London, and soon became notorious as one of the leading antinomian preachers in the city.<br>
<br>On 9 October 1643 the Commons took away Simpson's lectureship at Aldgate and banned him from preaching. The ban was not lifted until October 1646, but Simpson ignored it. Parliament ordered his arrest in February 1644 after he clashed at Paul's Cross with the presbyterian Cornelius Burges, and he was soon in trouble again for preaching, allegedly, that Christ was to be found even &#145;in Hogs and Dogs, or Sheep&#146;  (Greaves, 101). In 1647 Simpson became pastor of the gathered congregation at All Hallows-the-Great, London, founded by the antinomian Walter Cradock. Invited to preach to the Commons on 13 March 1651, at the suggestion of Major-General Thomas Harrison, he used the occasion to champion lay preaching by soldiers, when inspired by the spirit, and to damn the professional clergy and human learning. His sermon produced uproar in the house, and he was denied the customary vote of thanks. In 1653 he visited some thirty gathered churches on a preaching tour of Essex and East Anglia, in the company of his friend Henry Jessey. He did not, however, withdraw from the public ministry. He remained a frequent lecturer in the parish church of All Hallows, and in March 1652 he was appointed to the sequestered rectory of St Botolph without Bishopsgate.<br>
<br>When Charles II and the Scots invaded England in 1651 the gathered churches raised forces to fight under Harrison against them. Simpson served as a major in this campaign, which culminated in the victory at Worcester. But by then he had already come to doubt whether parliament shared the commitment he felt, with Harrison, to the kingdom of Christ on earth. In December 1651 he joined Christopher Feake in calling a meeting at All Hallows to rally support for the millenarian cause. It was here that the Fifth Monarchist movement was born, with All Hallows its centre and Feake and Simpson its first leaders. Unlike many radicals, Simpson placed no trust in Oliver Cromwell as the instrument of God. He reported visions in which God had revealed to him Cromwell's lust for power and his impending ruin. When Cromwell became protector in December 1653 Simpson and Feake attacked him ferociously at All Hallows. They were arrested in January 1654 and held in Windsor Castle. At first they continued to rail against the regime, but Simpson's ardour had cooled enough by July for the council to order his release, on condition that he did not come within 10 miles of London. In December, flouting the order, he reappeared at All Hallows and denounced Cromwell's church settlement. Summoned before the protector, Simpson boldly accused him to his face of treason, for taking the government upon himself. Cromwell, remarkably, dismissed him with merely a caution, though the appointment at St Botolph without Bishopsgate was formally revoked a few months later.<br>
<br>Simpson's militancy reached a new peak in December 1655, when he denounced the protector at All Hallows as a tyrannical usurper, and allowed the subversive tract <span class="italic">A Word for God</span> by Vavasor Powell to be read out to the congregation. He promptly went into hiding but was eventually captured. He was soon released, however, and the news spread that he had abruptly reversed his political stance and was now willing to accept the regime; whether prison or Jessey's advice lay behind the change is unclear. This conversion, welcomed by the government, provoked anger among some of his former supporters. When he preached restraint at All Hallows in February 1656 the meeting broke up in confusion. A considerable part of his gathered congregation, already suspicious after his release in 1654, accused him of apostasy, and in 1656, following an acrimonious dispute, seceded to form a new church. In January 1657 he clashed with Feake at All Hallows over his old ally's continued intransigence. He was also involved in a long-running dispute at St Botolph, Aldgate, with Zachary Crofton, its presbyterian minister. In 1657 Crofton tried to bar him from the pulpit as a heretic and troublemaker. Simpson had the backing of an unlikely alliance of radicals and moderates, driven together by Crofton's rigid principles and choleric nature, and Cromwell and the council upheld his claims. The council even suggested resolving the dispute by building a meeting-house next to St Paul's for him and his followers to use.<br>
<br>Simpson's rehabilitation soon went further. In 1658 he was allowed to preach at Bishopsgate once more, as a Sunday lecturer, and in August 1659 the restored Rump, after much dispute and delay, voted to re-install him as rector. But his triumph proved short-lived. He was forced out of the Aldgate lectureship soon after General George Monck arrived in London, and a new rector was appointed at Bishopsgate on 10 August 1660, shortly after the Restoration. The return of monarchy rekindled Simpson's old militancy. In October 1660, at Bishopgate, he boldly defended the regicides, and at All Hallows he repeatedly urged the godly to stand firm. He was arrested in November 1661 but released after taking the oaths of allegiance and supremacy, which aroused further suspicions of apostasy. He died a few months later, and was buried on 27 June 1662. He seems to have had a wife and at least one child, but nothing is known about them.<br>
<br>Simpson's collected sermons set out the antinomian creed he never retracted. In 1660 he defended free grace in two public disputations at All Hallows against John Goodwin, the champion of free will. He later attacked the Quakers. He was generally known as an Anabaptist, but though he ridiculed infant baptism he insisted that adult or believer's baptism was also unnecessary. His gathered church, like Jessey's, allowed members to decide the issue for themselves. He attached no importance to outward forms, condemning the linking of salvation to ordinances or church membership. Many contemporaries were bewildered by Simpson's volatile and passionate nature and thought him mad. Even a funeral sermon, <span class="italic">The Failing and Perishing of Good Men</span> (1663), which described Simpson as &#145;a Moses&#146;, was apologetic about the controversies which had dogged his erratic career  (sig. B2<i>v</i>). But his power as a preacher was widely recognized, and he remained true to his faith in the Holy Spirit as the sole guide for believers.<br>
