<span class="headword">Somerville,  William Meredyth</span>, first Baron Athlumney and first Baron Meredyth  (1802&#150;1873), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was the son of Sir Marcus Somerville, third baronet (<i>d</i>. 1831), and his first wife, Mary Anne, daughter and heir of Sir Richard Meredyth, bt. He was educated at Harrow School and matriculated at Christ Church, Oxford, in February 1822, but did not take a degree. He succeeded to the baronetcy on the death of his father in 1831. After a short period in the diplomatic service, on 22 December 1832 Somerville married the Hon. Maria Harriet Conyngham, with whom he had one son and one daughter surviving. His wife died on 3 December 1843.<br>
<br>In January 1835 Somerville stood unsuccessfully as a Liberal candidate for Wenlock. In August 1837 he was returned for Drogheda, which he represented for fifteen years. From his second session onwards he spoke frequently on Irish questions from the viewpoint of a Liberal landlord. In 1841 (3 June) he made a strong speech in support of Lord Melbourne, whose ministry was overthrown by a vote of one in Peel's motion for a vote of censure. Somerville was of the view that the repeal of the corn laws was the best way to modernize the Irish farming system. Later, in 1846 (30 March), he opposed the postponement of Peel's <span class="roman">Corn Bill</span> in favour of the <span class="roman">Protection of Life in Ireland Bill</span>. The motion was rejected by 147 to 108 votes. However, when, on 17 April, the repressive measure was introduced, he denounced it as unnecessary and likely to be ineffective. On 8 June he moved its rejection on the second reading, and after six nights' debate succeeded, with the aid of the protectionists, in defeating the bill and overthrowing the tory government.<br>
<br>In Lord John Russell's new whig government Somerville became under-secretary for the Home department. In July 1847 he was appointed chief secretary for Ireland and sworn of the privy council. During his term of office he had to deal with the Irish famine and the Young Ireland movement. He was appointed to the new, separate, Irish poor-law commission in 1847. In September of that year he was alarmed at the prospect that poor-law guardians would have to finance the fever hospitals set up in the wake of the famine &#145;knowing as I do that the cessation of the accustomed [government] funds even for one day may cause effects the most deplorable and disastrous&#146;  (Woodham-Smith, 314). The Treasury eventually agreed to a subsidy. In 1848 he introduced a land bill that would have given a measure of security to tenants in Ireland, but it foundered amid opposition from landlords. Two years later he was more successful in piloting the <span class="roman">Irish Franchise Act</span> (13 &amp; 14 Vict. c. 69), &#145;the single most important legislative influence upon the make up of the electorate and the course of electoral politics in nineteenth century Ireland&#146;, according to one authority  (Hoppen, 17). The act made voter registration a process of automatic renewal, and established a new franchise on the basis of the occupation, rather than the ownership, of property.<br>
<br>When Lord John Russell's ministry fell in February 1852, Somerville ceased to be chief secretary, and at the general election in the following July lost his seat for Drogheda. After a two years' absence from parliament, he was returned at a by-election for Canterbury on 18 August 1854. During the next few years he spoke on many topics in the house: favouring the abolition of church rates (1855); considering the bill dealing with dwellings of Irish labourers; supporting Roebuck's motion for the abolition of the Irish viceroyalty &#145;for imperial as well as Irish reasons&#146;; and bringing in a bill whose aim was to remove legal impediments to Roman Catholics who might wish to become Irish chancellor (1859). The bill received the support of leaders of both parties, but, after reference to a select committee, was withdrawn. On 16 October 1860 in Paris Somerville married Maria Georgiana Elizabeth Jones (1831&#150;1899), with whom he had several daughters and two sons. On 14 December 1863 he was created a peer of Ireland, with the title of Baron Athlumney of Somerville and Dollardstown; on 3 May 1866 he was raised to the peerage of the United Kingdom as Baron Meredyth of Dollardstown, co. Meath, in which county lay his family estates of some 10,000 acres. In his last speech in the House of Commons (21 June 1864) he expressed his opinion against any further interference between landlord and tenant in Ireland. In the House of Lords he supported Lord Clanricarde's bill of 1867 to simplify tenure of Irish land, declaring his preference for emigration over legislative interference. Nevertheless, he supported Gladstone's <span class="roman">Land Bill</span> of 1870, taking considerable part in the discussions in committee. He also gave a warm support to the <span class="roman">Irish Church Bill</span>, having been an early supporter of concurrent endowment. He died at Waterloo Crescent, Dover, on 7 December 1873, and was buried at Kentstones, co. Meath, on 13 December. He was survived by his second wife and was succeeded in the peerage by his son James Herbert Gustavus Meredyth Somerville.<br>
