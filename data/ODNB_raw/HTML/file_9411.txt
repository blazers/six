<span class="headword">Fiennes,  James</span>, first Baron Saye and Sele  (<em>c.</em>1390&#150;1450), <span class="occ">administrator</span>, was the second son of Sir William Fiennes (1357&#150;1402) of Herstmonceux, Sussex, and Elizabeth, daughter and heir of William Batisford of Wartling, Sussex. James's paternal grandmother was Joan, youngest daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/24763/', "Geoffrey de Say, second Lord de Say")</script>, and Maud, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1835/', "Guy de Beauchamp, earl of Warwick (d. 1315)")</script>. His father served twice as sheriff of Surrey and Sussex, and died in 1402 possessed of estates in five southern counties. His elder brother, Sir Roger, the builder of Herstmonceux Castle, who furthered Fiennes's early career, probably ceded to James two Oxfordshire manors held by their father.<br>
<br>James Fiennes took part in the Agincourt campaign and in Henry V's conquest of Normandy. He served as lieutenant of the garrison of Caudebec under the captaincy of Sir Lewis Robessart. In 1419 he was granted the <i>seigneurie</i> of Court-le-Compte and other confiscated properties in the <i>bailliages</i> of Rouen and Caux. In the next decade, thanks to his brother, Fiennes became established in Kent. By February 1430 he was in possession of his principal seat, the manor of Hever, near Tonbridge, purchased by Roger in 1423. In the same month Fiennes, as an esquire of the royal household, indented to serve for a year as part of the large military and domestic establishment that accompanied the nine-year-old Henry VI for his coronation in France. He probably owed his entrance into the household to his brother, a long-standing member of the royal affinity, and to Robessart, who was chamberlain. In 1433 Fiennes was named a justice of the peace for Kent and remained on the commission until his death. He served as sheriff of Kent in 1436&#150;7 and of Surrey and Sussex in 1438&#150;9, in which capacity he returned his brother to the parliament of 1439&#150;40 as a member for Sussex. Fiennes represented Kent in that parliament, and in all parliaments that followed until his elevation to the peerage in 1447.<br>
<br>By 1440 Fiennes had begun his rapid rise in influence and wealth. An esquire of the body since 1438, he and Roger, treasurer of the household from 1439 to 1446, were members of the inner circle surrounding the king led by William de la Pole, earl of Suffolk (<i>d</i>. 1450). He was one of the courtiers involved in the implementation of the two projects that above all else provoked Henry VI to enthusiastic activity, namely the foundation of the colleges of Eton and King's, Cambridge. Perhaps it was this that gave rise to the tradition, much later given memorable expression by Shakespeare through the mouth of Jack Cade, that &#145;Thou hast most traitorously corrupted the youth of the realm in erecting a grammar school&#146;  (<span class="italic">2 Henry VI</span>, <span class="smallcap">IV</span>. vii). Knighted in 1444, he became chamberlain to the royal bride, Margaret of Anjou, in the following year, and fed mightily at the trough of royal munificence. Estates, offices, wardships, and annuities were his by royal gift. By 1446 he had obtained from the crown lands four manors in Kent, one each in Surrey and Sussex, and two in Warwickshire. Offices, whose work was performed by deputies, ranged from the constableship of Rochester Castle (held for ten months) to the relatively humble but profitable post of ulnager of Northamptonshire and Rutland. The resources of the duchy of Lancaster enhanced Fiennes's position in the home counties. The stewardship of Pevensey, and the constableship of the castle there, together with that of Hertford Castle, fell to his lot.<br>
<br>Fiennes's custody of the bailiwicks of Otford, Kent, and South Malling, Sussex, during the vacancy of the see of Canterbury in 1443 was a prelude to the life grant of the stewardship of the archiepiscopal lands given him in September by Archbishop John Stafford at the king's request. Stafford, also chancellor of England, told the prior of Canterbury that he made the appointment &#145;havyng consyderacion how the seid James stondyng aboute the Kyng as he dooth, may dayly proufyte our church and us&#146;  (Sheppard, 3.182). His influence at court earned Fiennes retaining fees from Richard, duke of York (<i>d</i>. 1460), and Henry Beauchamp, duke of Warwick. The latter also gave him in May 1446 a life grant of the stewardship of the Warwick lands in Kent and Sussex. In July 1446, after Duke Henry's sudden death, Fiennes was appointed sheriff of Worcestershire and held this hereditary perquisite of the Beauchamps until Warwick's young daughter died in 1449.<br>
<br>Fiennes did not figure prominently in the Suffolk regime's peace negotiations with Charles VII that led to the surrender of Maine. His name, however, came to be linked with Suffolk's in one result: the arrest at the Bury parliament of 1447 of the opponent of that policy, the king's uncle, Humphrey, duke of Gloucester. Humphrey's sudden death while in custody sparked rumours of murder, and Fiennes was later deemed to be one of the perpetrators. He certainly profited from the duke's demise. On 24 February, the day after Humphrey died, the chancery received warrants signed by the king approving Fiennes's petition for offices held by the duke or in his gift. Fiennes thereby obtained the grant in tail male of the critically important posts of constable of Dover Castle and warden of the Cinque Ports. Although he was simply styled knight in the draft he had prepared, the actual patent letter noted his recent creation as Lord Saye and Sele and substantially increased his wages for the offices. He was subsequently one of those authorized to dispose of Humphrey's goods. By April he had been appointed chamberlain of the household, which gave him control over access to the king. He was also made a member of the continual council. In August he became constable of the Tower of London for the duration of the minority of Henry Holland, duke of Exeter (<i>d</i>. 1475).<br>
<br>Fiennes's unusual dual title, necessitated because others, including his brother, had a better hereditary claim to the barony of Saye, also underscores his aggressive acquisition of Kentish properties in this period. Purchase and, it was said after his death, intimidation made him the dominant secular landowner in the county. Two territorial blocks in particular were created by 1450. In the neighbourhood of Sevenoaks he acquired the manor of Knole, and also that of Seal&#151;hence his title of Sele&#151;and Kemsing. Jurors before a royal commission in August 1450 charged that, in extending the latter, he had forced a prominent landowner to make an unprofitable exchange of property and then had kept both estates. Plaintiffs in a later unsuccessful chancery suit told a similar tale. After purchasing a substantial group of estates in the Romney Marsh area, he had the supposed heir arrested and coerced into sealing a release before a chancery master. It was also claimed that Fiennes admitted, to the priest who heard his last confession, &#145;that of all the thinges that ever he dyde in his life&#146; this &#145;was moost in his consciens&#146;  (TNA: PRO, C1/27/419) and sought to make amends. Fiennes's accumulation of property and offices in the south-east, when added to those of his brother and their gentry associates, made the Fiennes affinity one of the most formidable in the country. His control of local affairs in Kent would attach his name to the manifold charges of extortion and corruption soon to be made against county and archiepiscopal officers.<br>
<br>The renewal in 1449 of the war in France, and the rapid collapse of the English defence of Normandy that followed, led to the downfall and murder of Suffolk and some of his associates. On 22 September 1449 Lord Saye assumed the office of lord treasurer upon the resignation of Bishop Marmaduke Lumley. The costs of war quickly nullified Lumley's policy of restoring solvency to royal finances. When faced with parliamentary refusal to consent to direct taxation, Saye initiated a campaign to secure loans, and personally lent over &pound;2000. Nevertheless, both before and after the fall of Suffolk, public opinion targeted Saye, &#145;that dastard of renown&#146;  (Robbins, 204), as one of the &#145;traitors&#146; responsible for England's misgovernment, bankruptcy and military humiliation. Some among the parliamentary Commons began to demand his arrest. His last will of 12 April 1450, composed in evident haste, suggests the uncertainty of his position and the probable loss of the crown properties he held if the policy of resumption, advocated by the Commons, took place.<br>
<br>When the Kentishmen rose under Jack Cade, denouncing the courtiers and the oppression of their agents in Kent, Saye's fate was sealed. At the demand of some in the royal forces opposing the rebels, he was arrested and sent to the Tower on 19 June 1450, and an order for the confiscation of his goods was issued. An attempt by Henry VI to secure his release was thwarted by the duke of Exeter. When Cade's insurgents temporarily occupied London, Saye was brought before a commission of oyer and terminer meeting in the Guildhall on 4 July, to answer charges of treason and extortion. His demand to be tried by his peers provoked the mob present to seek his death. Permitted to make his last confession, he was taken to The Standard in Cheapside and beheaded. His head, placed on a staff, was made to kiss that of his son-in-law, William Crowmer, sheriff of Kent, who had been beheaded at Mile End. Cade then rode about the city with Saye's corpse trailing on the ground alongside his horse. Saye's head was set up on London Bridge. A week later it was taken down and he was buried on 11 July in the church of the London Greyfriars, in accordance with his will. Soldiers returning from Normandy soon afterwards contemptuously hauled down his coat of arms from above his tomb and reversed it.<br>
<br>Modern scholarship has generally upheld the negative assessment of Fiennes found in contemporary sources, especially regarding his ill-doing in Kent. His wife, Emeline (<i>d</i>. 1452/3), the only executor to accept the administration of his will, received by it possession of many of his estates, including Hever and Knole. But most of the lands accumulated by Fiennes were either lost by resumption or were later sold by his son William, the second Lord Saye. William fought for the Yorkists at Northampton in 1460, and died in Edward IV's army at Barnet in 1471.<br>
