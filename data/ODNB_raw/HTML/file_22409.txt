<span class="headword">Plunket,  Christopher</span>, second earl of Fingall  (<em>d.</em> 1649), <span class="occ">politician and soldier</span>, was the eldest son of Lucas Plunket (Lucas M&ocirc;r), first earl of Fingall (1589&#150;1637), and his second wife, Susanna (<i>d</i>. 1623), fifth daughter of Edward, first Baron Brabazon, whom he married in 1611. Christopher's mother, a protestant, died in 1623 and his father raised his four sons and four daughters as Catholics. Shortly prior to his father's death in 1637 Christopher married Mabel (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1700), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1482/', "Nicholas Barnewall, first Viscount Barnewall of Kingsland")</script>. As the head of one of the most important Old English families of the pale, the second earl enjoyed particularly close links with the earls of Westmeath, Roscommon, Kildare, Tyrconnell, and Meath, and lords Dunsany, Slane, and Kingsland. Despite Fingall's mortgaging of portions of his estate in co. Meath (in part to acquire acres in co. Cavan), a later commentator noted his industry and found his lands &#145;very well husbanded&#146;.<br>
<br>Fingall took his seat in the Irish parliament of 1640, served as a member of the committee for privileges, and actively supported the removal of Lord Deputy Wentworth. Like his fellow peers he reacted to the October 1641 rising by securing his own estates and trying to find a political solution. Ultimately the bungling and hyperbole of the lords justices, Sir Charles Coote's military excesses, and the deteriorating political climate in England effectively undermined any negotiated settlement to the crisis and forced Fingall to ally with the insurgents. On 17 November he was proclaimed an outlaw and early in December he attended a meeting at Knockcrofty, near Drogheda, which resulted in a formal alliance between the Old English and Ulster insurgents. At a later gathering at the Hill of Tara, Fingall was appointed general of the horse for Meath with the power to nominate &#145;so many captains as [he] though fitt out of the baronies&#146;  (1641 depositions, TCD, MS 840, fol. 13). The earl also raised provisions for the Irish forces and commanded a troop of horse at the siege of Drogheda (November 1641 &#150; March 1642). He regularly attended the confederate general assemblies but, unlike his illustrious uncle Sir Nicholas Plunkett, speaker of the general assembly, he appears to have maintained a low profile throughout the 1640s. However, he fought at Dungan's Hill (8 August 1647), where the confederate forces were routed, and was wounded and taken prisoner at the battle of Rathmines on 2 August 1649. He died of his wounds in confinement in Dublin Castle later that month and was buried in St Catherine's Church on 18 August. He left at least two young sons: Luke (1639&#150;<i>c</i>.1685), his heir, and Nicholas, who later married Anne Taaffe, daughter of the first earl of Carlingford.<br>
<br>The third earl was indicted for high treason and the state confiscated Fingall's estates by the <span class="roman">Act for the Settling of Ireland</span> (August 1652). Despite being named in Charles II's &#145;gracious declaration&#146; (30 November 1660) and being judged innocent by the court of claims (25 February 1662), the third earl of Fingall had to struggle throughout the 1660s to recover his estates. By 1670 he had been reduced to penury and could not provide a jointure for his wife or portions for his younger children, or pay his debts. Finally in March 1672 letters patent confirmed Fingall's possession in free and common socage of most of his ancestral lands in counties Cavan and Meath together with Fingal House in Dublin. His restoration can in part be attributed to the influence his great-uncle Sir Nicholas Plunkett enjoyed with the duke of Ormond, and to his timely marriage in 1665 to Margaret, the first earl of Clancarty's daughter and Ormond's niece. While the union initially proved to be an unhappy one, with Lady Margaret complaining how unreasonable and unpleasant her husband was, the couple had at least three children. By Fingall's death about 1685 the family fortunes had recovered, only to be squandered by his son and heir, Peter. The earl provided his two daughters with generous portions and his wife, who became a lady-in-waiting to Catherine of Braganza, with a jointure of &pound;600, and left an extensive library, richly stocked with historical and political works, including the important Jacobite manuscript known as &#145;A light to the blind&#146;.<br>
