<span class="headword">Wiffen,  Jeremiah Holmes</span>  (1792&#150;1836), <span class="occ">poet and translator</span>, was born on 30 December 1792 at Woburn, Bedfordshire, the eldest of the six children of John Wiffen (1761&#150;1802) and Elizabeth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Pattison (1761&#150;1841). Both parents came from Quaker families; his father was a poetry-loving ironmonger and his mother had been a dressmaker on the duke of Bedford's estate, and was reputed to be a visionary. His father died in 1802, leaving his mother to run the large ironmonger's shop next to the George Hotel (later the Bedford Arms), Woburn, and care for five surviving children. His younger brother was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29361/', "Benjamin Barron Wiffen")</script>, and his youngest sister, Priscilla, married Alaric Alexander Watts. After attending three local schools, at the age of nine Jeremiah went to Ackworth School, the Friends' public school near Pontefract, Yorkshire, where he received a sound, if eclectic, education, developing his taste for poetry, learning wood-engraving, and probably acquiring some Latin and Greek.<br>
<br>In 1807 Wiffen was apprenticed to Isaac Payne, a schoolmaster, in Epping, Essex, and in the same year his first published poem, &#145;Address to the Evening Star&#146;, appeared in the <span class="italic">European Magazine</span> (October 1807). The following year he contributed an account of Broxbourne, Hertfordshire, with an etching of the church by himself to the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> (1st ser., 78, 1808, 497). In 1811 he returned to Woburn and opened a school in Leighton Road. Studying mostly at night (which became a lifelong habit), he taught himself Hebrew, French, and Italian, and later Spanish and Welsh. Together with James Baldwin Brown the elder and Thomas Raffles he published <span class="italic">Poems by Three Friends</span> in 1813. These poems and his two independent volumes of poetry, <span class="italic">Aonian Hours</span> (1819) and <span class="italic">Julia Alpinula &hellip; and other Poems</span> (1820), show the influence of Campbell, and more especially of Byron. On a visit to the Lakes with his brother in the summer of 1819 he called on both Southey and Wordsworth, whose &#145;white pantaloons&#146; and &#145;hawk's nose&#146; he described in his diary. He argued amicably with Wordsworth about the merits of Campbell's poetry, and wrote a sonnet to commemorate their meeting.<br>
<br>In the summer of 1821 Wiffen was appointed secretary and librarian to the duke of Bedford at Woburn Abbey. Also in 1821 he issued his &#145;Proposals&#146; for a new translation of Tasso's <span class="italic">Gerusalemme liberata</span> in Spenserian stanzas, together with a specimen book. His next essay in verse was <span class="italic">The Works of Garcilasso de la Vega</span> (1823), a translation from the Spanish dedicated to the duke of Bedford, with a life of Garcilasso de la Vega and an essay on Spanish poetry. Publication of <span class="italic">Jerusalem Delivered</span> (2 vols., 1824) was delayed by a fire in the printing office. Dedicated to the duchess of Bedford, it became his best-known work, running to a number of editions in both Britain and America over the next thirty years. Hogg, in the <span class="italic">Noctes Ambrosianae</span>, says: &#145;the best scholar amang a' the Quakers is friend Wiffen, a capital translator, Sir Walter tells me, o' poets wi' foreign tongues, sic as Tawso, and wi' an original vein, too&#146;  (Wilson, 243). In a long review in June 1826 the <span class="italic">Quarterly Review</span> concluded that, as a translator of Tasso, Wiffen could not hope to contend successfully with Fairfax. Wiffen declined an LLD from Aberdeen University in 1827. He contributed poems to magazines and &#145;albums&#146;, and published occasional poetry, often associated with Woburn, throughout his life.<br>
<br>According to his daughter, Jeremiah's &#145;ideal Love married another&#146;, and it was only after her death that he married Mary Whitehead (1789&#150;1872), a Quaker from a Nottingham family, on 20 November 1828 at the Friends' meeting-house in Leeds. They had three daughters: Ida Margaret Wiffen (1829&#150;1865), Mary Isaline Whitehead (<i>b</i>. 1831), and Hannah Holinshed (<i>b</i>. 1835). On his marriage, he moved from the abbey to a cottage provided by the duke at Froxfield, where he spent the rest of his life. Wiffen took eight years to compile his <span class="italic">Historical Memoirs of the House of Russell</span> (1833), for which he made extensive researches including a four-month tour in Normandy.<br>
<br>Wiffen remained a lifelong Quaker and was known as a Liberal reformer. His family seems never to have known poverty, and his post at Woburn brought him not only financial security, but contacts with many of the leading political and artistic figures of the time. Portraits by George Hayter (1824) and William Brockedon (1830) show him with Byronic good looks, but what his friends recalled were his gentleness, courtesy, and good conversation. Following attacks of breathlessness, which he disregarded for some months, he died suddenly at Froxfield on 2 May 1836 and was buried on 8 May in the Quaker burial-ground, Hogsty End, Woburn Sands, Buckinghamshire.<br>
