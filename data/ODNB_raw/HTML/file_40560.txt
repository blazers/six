<span class="headword">Holbrooke,  Joseph Charles <span class="st"> [Josef]</span></span>  (1878&#150;1958), <span class="occ">composer and pianist</span>, was born on 5 July 1878 at Waddon, Croydon, one of the five children (two sons and three daughters) of Joseph Charles Holbrooke (<i>fl</i>. 1860&#150;1900), a music-hall musician and piano teacher from Bristol, and his wife, Alice Scotland (<i>d</i>. 1880), of Newport, Paisley, Fife. Holbrooke studied at the Royal Academy of Music (1893&#150;5), winning various prizes. During 1896&#150;9 he eked out a living as pantomime band conductor, music teacher, and composer of many salon pieces. He subsequently adopted the forename Josef professionally, to avoid confusion with his father. In June 1896 Holbrooke made his d&eacute;but as a solo pianist at St James's Hall, London; his repertory included piano concertos by Rakhmaninov and Tchaikovsky. He married Dorothy Elizabeth, daughter of T. Hadfield of Morthen. They had two sons and three daughters.<br>
<br>In 1900 Holbrooke began to achieve success and recognition as a composer. In that year his tone-poem <span class="italic">The Raven</span> was accepted by Sir August Manns for premi&egrave;re at a Crystal Palace concert on 3 March. His Proms premi&egrave;re came later that year when his variations for orchestra, <span class="italic">Three Blind Mice</span>, was played at a Prom on 3 November; it was later a great favourite with audiences at the Proms. Holbrooke briefly taught at the Birmingham and Midland Institute, but the popularity of his works at chamber and orchestral concerts in London encouraged him to concentrate on composing; and commissions from the major music festivals began to arrive. His orchestral piece <span class="italic">Queen Mab</span> was given at the Leeds festival in 1904, and <span class="italic">Ulalume</span> at the Queen's Hall, London, under Sir Henry Wood later the same year. Other festival premi&egrave;res of his works took place at Norwich, Bristol, and Birmingham.<br>
<br>A significant event of these years was Holbrooke's introduction to the poet Herbert Trench. The latter commissioned a setting of his poem &#145;Apollo and the Seaman&#146; from Holbrooke, who produced a seventy-minute symphony, premi&egrave;red at the Queen's Hall in 1908. This featured a large orchestra and chorus behind a screen on which a magic lantern projected text and images. The slides were unfortunately out of sequence with the music, and the event became the quarry from which a number of writers on music subsequently extracted humorous anecdotes.<br>
<br>An important boost to Holbrooke's career followed from a meeting with the wealthy Lord Howard de Walden, who became his benefactor. He transformed Holbrooke's existence with major commissions, as well as other kinds of subsidy: gifts, a cottage in Harlech, holidays (he went on de Walden's honeymoon cruise of the Mediterranean in 1912). Unfortunately, all this largess came to an end with de Walden's death in 1946. However, de Walden wrote a triptych of three poetic plays, collectively known as <span class="italic">The Cauldron of Annwn</span> and based on the <span class="roman">Mabinogion</span>; and Holbrooke was commissioned to set all three. He conceived them as Wagnerian music dramas, rather than operas; they appeared as <span class="italic">Dylan</span> (1910), <span class="italic">The Children of Don</span> (1912), and <span class="italic">Bronwen</span> (1920). The first two were performed under Artur Nikisch and Thomas Beecham respectively. Because of the First World War <span class="italic">Bronwen</span> did not receive its premi&egrave;re until 1929. By that time, the first two works had been put on in Vienna and Salzburg, &#145;which indicates the wide performance that Holbrooke's music received in the first quarter of the century&#146;  (Pirie, 642).<br>
<br>Already by the end of the First World War, however, there were signs that Holbrooke's reputation was beginning to wane. There were still occasional BBC broadcasts of his works, as well as chamber concerts and performances by provincial orchestras; but it was clear that musical tastes had moved on. His chances of performance were not helped by the fact that &#145;Many of his works are scored for a very large orchestra and are of long duration&#151;for a composer of less than first rank this makes a formidable barrier&#146;  (Pirie, 642). Although he attempted to write foxtrots, and was associated with the dance band music of the 1920s, he made little impression. Holbrooke was handicapped, from the late 1920s, by profound deafness.<br>
<br>A vigorous and articulate advocate of British music, Holbrooke included not only his own works but the music of many others in the chamber music concerts he organized (1903&#150;35). His book <span class="italic">Contemporary British Composers</span> was published in 1925. As late as 1946, the year of his benefactor's death, the London Symphony Orchestra played his works at two concerts in the Kingsway Hall, London.<br>
<br>Holbrooke's reputation is that of a composer of large, outdated works in a sub-Wagnerian idiom; not just overblown, but musically uninspired. &#145;His enormous oeuvre is very uneven, and his music is sometimes clumsy and tasteless&#146;  (Pirie, 642). Yet the <span class="italic">New Grove</span> article goes on to add that &#145;there is much that is lively and original, and his scoring was always vivid&#146;  (ibid.). Indeed, although the music dramas are large-scale, the effects and imagination at work are often fresh and challenging. In addition, many of the orchestral pieces are quite short and are scored for orchestras of standard proportions. The music is always tonal, and in the chamber music (of which there are two sextets, six string quartets, three violin sonatas, and much else) a distinctly French exoticism, intriguingly tangled with music-hall vulgarity and vigour, is to the fore. Works which are still praised include his second clarinet quintet, the sextet for piano and wind op. 33a, and the piano quintet op. 44. Holbrooke also wrote eight symphonies, although a number of the later scores seem to be lost. The material for the early orchestral tone-poems is accessible, and during the 1990s several commercial recordings were made. A number of tone-poems were inspired by the prose and poetry of Edgar Allan Poe, including <span class="italic">The Raven</span>.<br>
<br>Holbrooke died at his home, 55 Alexandra Road, St John's Wood, London, on 5 August 1958, survived by his wife. The bassoonist Gwydion Brooke (<i>b</i>. 1912) was his son. Although his reputation is clearly ripe for reassessment, the judgement of Holbrooke's <span class="italic">Times</span> obituarist is unlikely to be wide of the mark: &#145;Holbrooke's was an exuberant, versatile talent, and his output, particularly of chamber music, was large. Though widely performed, his music has never become widely familiar.&#146;<br>
