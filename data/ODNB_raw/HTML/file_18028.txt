<span class="headword">Marcet,  Alexander John Gaspard</span>  (1770&#150;1822), <span class="occ">physician and chemist</span>, was born in Geneva, Switzerland, the only son of Marc Marcet (<i>b</i>. 1734), a merchant of Huguenot descent, and his wife, Louise-Marguerite, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Nadal. Educated in Geneva, Marcet was apprenticed in commerce but after two years he obtained his father's permission to study science. During the political disturbances in Geneva following the French Revolution he was indicted for serving in the national guard and, after the fall of Robespierre in 1794, he was banished from Switzerland for five years, with his boyhood friend Charles Gaspard De La Rive. Together they studied medicine at Edinburgh, and graduated MD on 24 June 1797. Marcet's thesis, printed at Edinburgh in the same year, was on diabetes. It is a compilation showing no evidence of clinical experience, but it reveals his inclination for chemical experiments.<br>
<br>After moving to London, Marcet became assistant physician to the Public Dispensary, Carey Street. He was admitted a licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians on 25 June 1799 and was appointed physician to the City Dispensary at Finsbury. On 4 December 1799 he married Jane Haldimand (1769&#150;1858) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18029/', "Marcet, Jane Haldimand")</script>], only daughter of Anthony Francis Haldimand (1740/41&#150;1817), a Swiss merchant living in London, and his wife, Jane, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Pickersgill (<i>d</i>. 1785). They took a house in Russell Square, and later had two daughters, Louisa and Sophie, and one son, Fran&ccedil;ois (1803&#150;1883), who became a distinguished physicist. In 1800 Marcet took British citizenship and on 18 April 1804 he was appointed physician to Guy's Hospital, London, on the recommendation of William Saunders. In 1805 Marcet contributed an essay on the Brighton chalybeate spring to a new edition of Saunders's <span class="italic">Treatise on Mineral Waters</span>. This essay, also published as a separate octavo pamphlet, describes various chemical experiments which show that, unlike the Tonbridge spa, the Brighton mineral water could be taken warm without precipitation of iron. Encouraged by Saunders, Marcet also analysed samples of sea water from various parts of the world.<br>
<br>Marcet attended meetings of the London Medical Society and, discovering dissatisfaction among the members, became a founder member in 1805 of the Medico-Chirurgical Society of London. He was its foreign secretary until his death in 1822. On 2 June 1808 he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society, and in the following year he took charge of a temporary military hospital at Portsmouth for troops suffering from a virulent fever contracted during the expedition to capture Flushing and Walcheren. Marcet himself suffered an attack of this fever.<br>
<br>Between 1807 and 1820, with William Babington and William Allen, Marcet lectured on chemistry at Guy's Hospital medical school. Unusually for that time, the lectures were illustrated by demonstration experiments and the students were also given access to a chemical laboratory. About 1812 Marcet began a friendship with the Swedish chemist J. J. Berzelius, with whom he investigated the properties of carbon disulphide during the latter's visit to London. Marcet also persuaded Berzelius to publish some analyses of animal fluids in the <span class="italic">Medico-Chirurgical Transactions</span>, thus helping to introduce Berzelius's animal chemistry studies to English chemists. In 1817 Marcet published his most important and original work, <span class="italic">An Essay on the Chemical History and Medical Treatment of Calculous Disorders</span>, which contained much chemical information and some good drawings of renal and urinary calculi. In chemical tests Marcet used very small quantities, a valuable technique which he derived from the work of William Hyde Wollaston; he also used the blowpipe. He was probably the first to remark that the pain caused by a renal calculus is often due to its passage down a ureter, whereas it may grow in the kidney without causing acute suffering. The book was useful to chemical pathologists, but Marcet regretted that no London hospital then kept any regular record of calculus cases. He identified a new type of urinary calculus, consisting of xanthic oxide, and he later investigated alcaptonuria, the condition in which the urine turns black.<br>
<br>Marcet was punctilious in dress and behaviour. He always sought to improve conditions for his patients, but his enthusiasm for medical practice declined as his interest in chemistry increased. He retired from the staff of Guy's Hospital on 10 March 1819, after inheriting a large fortune from his father-in-law. He had paid a short visit to Geneva in 1815 and he returned in 1821, intending to live there. He was warmly received and was made both a member of the representative council and an honorary professor of chemistry, sharing lectures with his friend De La Rive. In 1822 he returned to England to settle his affairs prior to moving permanently to Geneva, but while visiting Edinburgh he suffered an attack of &#145;gout of the stomach&#146;  (Munk, <span class="italic">Roll</span>). He returned to London, and was attended by William Babington and Astley Cooper, but he died at Babington's home in Great Coram Street, London, on 19 October 1822. He was buried at Battersea, and was survived by his wife, who died on 28 June 1858.<br>
