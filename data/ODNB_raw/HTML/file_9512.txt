<span class="headword">Fisher,  William Webster</span>  (1797&#150;1874), <span class="occ">physician</span>, son of John Fisher, was born at Thrimby, Westmorland, and attended school at Thorp Arch, Yorkshire. He studied medicine at Montpellier, in France, where he befriended Auguste Comte. He took the Montpellier MD degree in 1825, submitting a thesis on inflammation. On 12 December 1825 he entered Trinity College, Cambridge, of which his brother, John Hutton Fisher, was a fellow and assistant tutor. In 1830 he moved to Downing College, where he graduated MB in 1834. In 1837 he was elected to a fellowship, which he held until his appointment as Downing professor of medicine, in 1841, the year in which he proceeded to the MD.<br>
<br>During the 1830s Fisher carried out research on tuberculosis, and on the development of the nervous system and its derangement in conditions such as spina bifida. Several of his papers on the latter subject were published in the <span class="italic">Philosophical Magazine</span>. His interests put him in the vanguard of a vibrant movement in British neuroscience which was challenging long-held views about the functions of the brain and of nerves. He also taught medical students at the college, and told the electors to the Downing chair that he intended to study the medical topography of Cambridge and its surroundings, a project apparently never undertaken.<br>
<br>Historians have regarded Fisher as an indolent character, largely on the basis of an anecdote told of his lecturing to students in his bedroom, but he was clearly diligent in his preparation of lectures on clinical medicine, medical jurisprudence, and materia medica, which he delivered regularly from 1842 until failing health forced him to relinquish them to his deputy, Peter Wallwork Latham, in 1868. He served as physician to Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge, from 1845 until 1861, and on his resignation was appointed consulting physician to that institution. His research ceased in the late 1840s, possibly because he was devoting most of his time to his college duties, but he remained a fellow of the Cambridge Philosophical Society and a contributor to its <span class="italic">Transactions</span>.<br>
<br>Fisher was one of several young physicians whose presence in Cambridge in the 1830s and 1840s saved the university's medical faculty from extinction, but his appointment as Downing professor of medicine may be regarded as a lost opportunity for the medical school, which could instead have secured the services of one of the leading physicians of the day, Thomas Watson, who had also applied for the position. Fisher remained highly esteemed in the university for his professional attainments and his conversational powers. According to <span class="italic">The Times</span>, &#145;His politics were anything but conservative&#146;  (quoted in Venn, <span class="italic">Alum. Cant.</span>). Fisher, who was married to Catharine M. Woodham, died at his lodge in Downing College on 4 October 1874.<br>
