<span class="headword">Latham,  Peter Mere</span>  (1789&#150;1875), <span class="occ">physician</span>, was born on 1 July 1789 in Fenchurch Buildings, London, the second son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16091/', "John Latham (1761&#150;1843)")</script>, physician, and Mary, daughter of Peter Mere, vicar of Prestbury, Cheshire. His early education was at the free school at Sandbach in Cheshire and, from 1797, at Macclesfield grammar school. In 1806 he went to Brasenose College, Oxford, where he won a prize for Latin verse, as did both his brothers, and graduated BA in 1810. He began his medical studies at St Bartholomew's Hospital and at the Public Dispensary in Carey Street, London, under Thomas Bateman; here a fellow student was Richard Bright, who became a lifelong friend. Latham obtained his BM degree in 1814 and his DM in 1816.<br>
<br>Latham began practice in a house in Gower Street and in 1815 was appointed physician to the Middlesex Hospital. Three years later he was elected fellow of the Royal College of Physicians and began a distinguished career in the college. During the next twenty years he was censor at various times, gave the Goulstonian and Lumleian lectures and, in 1839, demonstrated that he had not lost his youthful touch by delivering the Harveian oration in better Latin than most orators of his generation. In 1837 he was appointed physician-extraordinary to the queen and he retained that appointment until his death.<br>
<br>In 1823 Latham and Peter Mark Roget were asked by the government to investigate an epidemic of scurvy and dysentery among the prisoners at Millbank penitentiary. They concluded that it was due to an inadequate diet; however, it is more likely to have been cholera. In 1824, like his father before him, Latham resigned from the Middlesex Hospital and was appointed physician to St Bartholomew's Hospital. In the same year he married Diana Clarissa Chetwynd Stapleton, but she died in the following year. On 14 February 1833 he married Grace Mary Chambers (<i>d</i>. 1868); there were four children of this marriage. At St Bartholomew's Latham devoted himself to improving the quality of the clinical teaching, which had been deteriorating for several years. He quickly acquired the reputation of being the best clinical teacher in London&#151;although it was said that his old friend Richard Bright ran him close. In 1836 Latham was appointed lecturer in the theory and practice of medicine in the medical school and in the same year published his <span class="italic">Lectures on Subjects Connected with Clinical Medicine</span>. He had developed a special interest in diseases of the heart; his <span class="italic">Essays on some Diseases of the Heart</span> (1826) was expanded into the much more substantial <span class="italic">Lectures on Clinical Medicine, Comprising Diseases of the Heart</span> (1845). As a result of these publications he acquired the nickname Heart Latham.<br>
<br>In these publications Latham demonstrated his extensive knowledge and sound judgement, and he was unusually aware of the limitations of the knowledge and practice of his day. His lucid descriptions of heart disease were balanced by the frankness with which he admitted his ignorance and the clarity with which he identified and expounded the problems still awaiting solution. He was an early convert to the use of the stethoscope, first described in 1819, and was teaching on auscultation as early as 1826&#151;much earlier than most of his peers and senior colleagues.<br>
<br>As a teacher Latham was clearly conscientious to a fault; his lectures were much praised by contemporaries but the use of terms such as &#145;highly finished and exhaustive&#146; to describe lectures delivered in a &#145;slow and formal style&#146; raises the suspicion that some students may have found them a little tedious. Latham himself was well aware of this risk and, in his writings on medical education, especially a series of papers published in the <span class="italic">British Medical Journal</span> in his retirement, he emphasized the inferiority of lectures to the direct study of sick men and women for the aspiring physician.<br>
<br>Of Latham's physical appearance and character Charles West, one of his most distinguished pupils, wrote a detailed account. He was very short and spare with a slight deformity of the spine; his hair was light brown, thinning as he aged, his eyes were grey and his nose aquiline, &#145;almost like the great Duke's&#146;. Despite these largely unremarkable features his appearance and demeanour seem to have been striking and, together with his voice, were calculated to command attention. A genial and cultured gentleman and a devout Christian, his sympathy with and compassion for his suffering patients was such that he is recorded as failing to keep appointments with those whose distress he could not relieve. West concluded his word picture of Latham: &#145;In troublous times he would have been a confessor; he might have lacked the courage to become a martyr&#146;  (Watson).<br>
<br>Latham's health was always delicate and his chronic asthma and emphysema compelled him to resign his appointment at St Bartholomew's at the age of fifty-two in 1841. His father also had retired early due to ill health and, like his father, Peter Latham found that relief from the stresses of hospital practice produced sufficient improvement to allow him to continue in private practice for two more decades. He finally retired in 1865 to Torquay with his wife; after her death in 1868 he was cared for by his two daughters, who never married. He died at Highwood, Torquay, on 20 July 1875.<br>
