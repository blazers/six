<span class="headword">Rubens,  Paul Alfred</span>  (1875&#150;1917), <span class="occ">musical comedy writer and songwriter</span>, was born at 11 Dawson Place, Kensington, London, on 29 April 1875, the eldest son of Victor Rubens, a wealthy Berlin-born Jewish stockbroker, and his wife, Jenny, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Wallach. He was educated at Winchester College and studied law at University College, Oxford (1895&#150;7), where he took part enthusiastically in university dramatics. Although he had no formal musical training, he also began writing songs in Oxford, among them a set for a stage production of <span class="italic">Alice in Wonderland</span> in which Charles Dodgson (Lewis Carroll) took a hand. He was still only nineteen when his song &#145;The Little Chinchilla&#146; was accepted by the era's most important musical-theatre producer, George Edwardes, and introduced into the hit musical play <span class="italic">The Shop Girl</span> at the Gaiety Theatre.<br>
<br>In the years that followed Rubens contributed individual songs to a number of West End musical comedies and burlesques, but his breakthrough came when he was hired by the producer Tom Davis to provide additional numbers to Leslie Stuart's score for <span class="italic">Florodora</span> (1899). The bright, tunefully simple songs that Rubens wrote for, in particular, the show's <i>soubrette</i>, Ada Reeve (&#145;Inkling&#146;, &#145;Tact&#146;, &#145;When I leave town&#146;), won him his spurs, and he was swiftly put under contract by Edwardes as a supplier of supplementary songs for his productions.<br>
<br>Edwardes gave the young songwriter a bigger opportunity to demonstrate his talents when he mounted <span class="italic">Three Little Maids</span> (1902), a lightweight piece of musical theatre for which Rubens had written the book, the music (with Howard Talbot), and the lyrics. <span class="italic">Three Little Maids</span>, &#145;alternately music-hally, pretty, pale, mildly suggestive, and also successful&#146;  (G&auml;nzl, <span class="italic">Encyclopedia of the Musical Theatre</span>, 2.1252), went on to be played around the English-singing world. It was followed by the similarly built <span class="italic">Lady Madcap</span> (1904) before Rubens surprised everyone by coming up with a work far in advance of his two recent hits in substance and quality. <span class="italic">Mr Popple of Ippleton</span> was a genuine musical comedy in the style of the French vaudeville, with a farcical and funny story and some charming and gently amusing songs which mostly avoided the rather schoolboy-naughty tone too often found in Rubens's lyrics. George P. Huntley and Ethel Irving created the lead roles of the winning tale of a country mouse (male) in the wicked city, and the piece did well enough that, after its British run, Rubens's libretto was borrowed by the American producers Comstock and Marbury to be remade as a &#145;new&#146; musical play, <span class="italic">Nobody Home</span>, with songs by Jerome Kern.<br>
<br>Rubens returned to his habitual lightweight, light-blue style for Robert Courtneidge's successful production <span class="italic">The Dairymaids</span> (1906) and then turned out the show which was to be his most enduring success. Although he was originally scheduled to write alone what he disarmingly called the &#145;chatter, jingles and tunes&#146; for <span class="italic">Miss Hook of Holland</span> (1907), the consumptive illness from which he suffered all his adult life prevented him from doing so, and the director Austen Hurgon ended by helping out with the show's libretto. <span class="italic">Miss Hook</span> was a major hit, and Rubens and Hurgon went on to provide two further pieces for its producer, Frank Curzon. <span class="italic">My Mimosa Maid</span> and <span class="italic">Dear Little Denmark</span> were, however, much less successful.<br>
<br>Curzon then switched Rubens away from libretto writing and teamed him instead with his newest playwriting discovery, the young Freddie Lonsdale, who had just provided the producer with a major hit in the romantic, Ruritanian costume musical <span class="italic">King of Cadonia</span> (music by Sidney Jones). Rubens's &#145;tunes&#146; (this was all he ever supplied; the accompaniments had to be written for him) for <span class="italic">The Balkan Princess</span> were far from being of the quality or the musicianship of Jones's work, but&#151;as ever&#151;they proved to have that catchiness that makes for success. <span class="italic">The Balkan Princess</span> became a West End success, an overseas hit&#151;produced from Broadway to Budapest to Havana&#151;and a longtime feature of the British touring circuits.<br>
<br>Rubens was then signed by Edwardes as principal composer to the Gaiety Theatre, and in the years that followed he provided the famous producer with songs for <span class="italic">The Sunshine Girl</span> (1912), <span class="italic">The Girl from Utah</span> (1913), <span class="italic">After the Girl</span> (1914), <span class="italic">Tina</span> (1915), <span class="italic">Betty</span> (1915), and, above all, Fred Thompson's adaptation of the famous farce <span class="italic">Les dominos roses</span> as <span class="italic">Tonight's the Night</span> (1914). Supplied with a libretto of quality, and limited again to writing just melodies and lyrics, Rubens proved, with a singular success, that this kind of light and bright illustration of a classy comic text was what he did best. However, just as an era of such pieces was beginning in the British theatre, Rubens's illness got the better of him. He died from tuberculosis at Roscarrack, Budock, Falmouth, Cornwall, on 4 February 1917, at the age of only forty-one.<br>
<br>W. Graham Robertson provided a eulogy:<blockquote>That strange genius who masqueraded as a good-looking boy, wandering listlessly through life in the hope of amusing himself, and who got through more good work in his short life than many a composer of fifty has to his credit. (Robertson, 321)</blockquote>Although during his lifetime the dark-featured Rubens carried an excessively public and blazing torch for several lovely actresses&#151;notably Phyllis Dare&#151;he never married.<br>
