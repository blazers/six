<span class="headword">Stevenson,  William</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1770, <em>d.</em> 1829), <span class="occ">writer</span>, was baptized in Berwick parish church on 26 November 1770, the eldest of five children of Lieutenant Joseph Stevenson RN (<i>bap</i>. 1719, <i>d</i>. 1799), and his wife, Isabel Thomson (<i>bap</i>. 1741, <i>d</i>. 1806). Educated at Berwick grammar school, he left in 1787 to study for the dissenting ministry under Thomas Belsham at Daventry Academy. In 1789 Stevenson moved with it to Northampton, but failed to complete his five-year course. After tutoring privately at Bruges, he joined Manchester Academy as classical tutor in 1793. The principal, Thomas Barnes, also minister of Cross Street Chapel, is said  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>) to have converted him to the Arian variant of Unitarianism. Stevenson served locally as minister of Dob Lane Chapel, but in 1796 abandoned chapel and college, publishing <span class="italic">Remarks on the Very Inferior Utility of Classical Learning</span>.<br>
<br>Stevenson then farmed unsuccessfully at Saughton Mills near Edinburgh, having married Elizabeth Holland (1771&#150;1811) of Sandlebridge near Knutsford on 1 December 1797. Subsequently his face became disfigured by &#145;a severe leprous complaint&#146;  (<span class="italic">Annual Biography and Obituary</span>, 211). From about 1801 he survived as a private tutor in Edinburgh until the Scottish whig James Maitland, eighth earl of Lauderdale, made him his secretary and found him an active post as keeper of the papers at the Treasury, starting at &pound;200 a year on 5 July 1806. Stevenson went to live at 3 Beaufort Row, Chelsea, in 1811, where his first wife died in October. Of their two surviving children, John (<i>b</i>. 1798) became a merchant navy officer and Elizabeth [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/10434/', "Gaskell, Elizabeth Cleghorn")</script>], whose birth on 29 September 1810 in Lindsey Row, Chelsea, was recorded in the register of nonconformists at Dr Williams's Library, was taken to Knutsford and brought up as a Unitarian. She married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/10435/', "William Gaskell")</script>, junior minister at Cross Street Chapel, Manchester, in 1832, and became famous as a writer of fiction and the biographer of Charlotte Bront&euml;. Stevenson next married, on 11 April 1814, Catherine Thomson of Edinburgh, who was born at Savannah, Georgia, in 1775. Of their two children, William was baptized in 1815 by a relation, the dissenting minister William Turner, but Catherine, born in 1816, was baptized in the established church.<br>
<br>Stevenson wrote extensively, contributing about a dozen articles (1803&#150;9, 1828) to the <span class="italic">Edinburgh Magazine</span>, over fifty entries (<i>c</i>.1816&#150;20) to David Brewster's <span class="italic">Edinburgh Encyclopaedia</span> (1830), and a few to the early numbers (1815&#150;16) of a supplement to the <span class="italic">Encyclopaedia Britannica</span>. He also revised three <span class="italic">General Views of Agriculture</span> (1809&#150;15) and wrote a <span class="italic">Life of William Caxton</span> (1833) for the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge. According to an obituary, he was editor and a major contributor to the <span class="italic">Scots Magazine</span>. His lengthy <span class="italic">Historical Sketch of the Progress of Discovery, Navigation and Commerce</span>, with a selective catalogue of texts, appeared in 1824. It has been long forgotten, though five articles attacking hard-edged political economy in <span class="italic">Blackwood's Magazine</span> (1824&#150;5) are more memorable.<br>
<br>Stevenson died of a stroke at 3 Beaufort Row on 22 March 1829 and was buried with his first wife in the King's Road cemetery of Chelsea parish church on 27 March. Despite his literary earnings and salary, by then &pound;350 a year, he was ever desperate for money. Elizabeth Gaskell later alluded to her acute unhappiness on occasional visits to Chelsea in her youth. An unsigned will of July 1827 shows that he had been forced to borrow part of his second wife's dowry, which amounted to &pound;800 with interest  (TNA: PRO, PROB 10/5099). In April 1829 Mrs Stevenson, apparently destitute, was allotted &pound;40 by the Royal Literary Fund  (BL, Case File 652), and afterwards went to live in Scotland with her children.<br>
<br>Quiet, meticulous, and dry in manner, Stevenson became obsessed with intellectual method: his friend and patron William Blackwood once advised him &#145;to come directly to the Scratch as the Bruisers say, and not to talk about it&#146;  (W. Blackwood to W. Stevenson, 24 Nov 1824, NL Scot., Blackwood MSS). Stevenson's <span class="italic">Westminster Review</span> articles (1825&#150;6) show a more lively play of mind, but his early death unfortunately cut short the kind of canny critical remarks on the literary scene displayed in a single surviving letter (2 July 1827) to his teenage daughter Elizabeth: &#145;The <span class="roman">Literary Gazette</span> also contains a review of Moore's Epicurean&#151;but I can hardly judge from what they say, what sort of work it is. I dare say, very gaudy&#146;  (Chapple, <span class="italic">Elizabeth Gaskell</span>, 287).<br>
