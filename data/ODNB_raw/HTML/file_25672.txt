<span class="headword">Scarning,  Roger  of</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1278), <span class="occ">bishop of Norwich</span>, probably came from Scarning in north Norfolk. He became a monk at Norwich Cathedral priory, where he was elected prior in 1257, probably between 23 June and 9 December. Nothing is known of his life as prior, but he must have found favour with the monks, for on 23 January 1266 they elected him as bishop of the diocese. His election was confirmed by the papal legate, Ottobuono, temporalities were restored on 17 March, and he was consecrated on 4 April, again by the legate. Throughout his life he retained a close interest in the affairs of the priory. His <i>acta</i> show him granting the church of Great Cressingham to the cellarer because that office was overburdened, the church of St Etheldreda was transferred to the refectioner when that official took over the supply of linen for the refectory, and the church of St Gregory was given to the hosteler so that he might better supply those visiting the priory.<br>
<br>Scarning's episcopate was anything but peaceful. First he was forced to flee Norwich and take refuge in Bury St Edmunds when the city was attacked by the &#145;disinherited&#146;, those remnants from the barons' war holding out in the Isle of Ely. More disturbing was the riot of 11 August 1272, when the cathedral priory was attacked and despoiled by townspeople. The outraged monks appealed to both the secular and the ecclesiastical authorities. It was inevitable that the bishop would side with the priory. Scarning called a meeting of the clergy at Eye, and on 29 August excommunicated the leaders of the riot and put the city under an interdict. A more balanced approach was taken by Henry III who went to Norwich on 14 September. The priory was taken into the king's hands, and the prior was persuaded to resign on 27 September. The interdict, which had been relaxed on the king's coming to Norwich, was reimposed on 18 October, and although it was relaxed again for Christmas, was later renewed. The case was sent to Rome and long negotiations ensued. Matters were not finally settled until 1275, when the interdict, which with sundry relaxations had lasted throughout the proceedings, was finally removed. Scarning may well have played a part in these negotiations. The priory had also to organize an expensive repair and cleaning operation, to which the bishop contributed at least &pound;15. Scarning died on 22 January 1278 at the episcopal manor of South Elmham and was buried in the lady chapel of the cathedral on 28 January.<br>
