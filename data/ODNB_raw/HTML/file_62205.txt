<span class="headword">Unaipon,  David</span>  (1872&#150;1967), <span class="occ">writer and promoter of Aboriginal rights</span>, was born on 28 September 1872 at Point McLeay Mission, South Australia, the fourth of the nine children of James Ngunaitponi. His father was a Yaralde man of the Lower Murray River and had been the first Aboriginal Christian convert in the region. He befriended the Free Church of Scotland missionary James Reid on his arrival in 1861 and quickly became a key intermediary between Europeans and his own people. James Ngunaitponi assisted the missionary George Taplin with his ethnographic and linguistic research but remained a steadfast Christian. He was also one of the first literate Aboriginal people in South Australia and corresponded with Reid's mentor, the Scottish philanthropist Henrietta Smith, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Erskine. David Unaipon grew up in a mission environment, with only slight exposure to the traditional culture of his people. He was heavily influenced by the mission schoolteacher, Walter Hutley, who provoked his interest in popular science, introducing him to unsolved mysteries of the philosopher's stone and perpetual motion. In 1885, with his parents' permission, Unaipon was taken into the Kanmantoo home of the pastoralist C. B. Young, a patron of the mission. There he was introduced to classical literature, folk tales, Greek, and Latin.<br>
<br>On his return to Point McLeay, Unaipon joined other literate, talented young Ngarrindjeri men seeking alternatives to the mission's limited employment opportunities. He avoided physical work such as shearing, fishing, or farming by working as a bookkeeper in the mission store. Adept on the mission organ, he accompanied performances of the young men's Band of Hope, reciting verse as well. During the 1890s Unaipon's relations with mission authorities deteriorated, but now he had befriended several influential members of Adelaide society. These associations later enabled him to avoid the full effect of legislation restricting Aboriginal freedom of movement.<br>
<br>On 4 January 1901 Unaipon married Catherine Carter, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Sumner, a Tangani woman. Their son, De Witt Talmage, was born later in the year and named after an American evangelist. Unaipon's was an unhappy marriage and from this point his mission home served mainly as a base for his frequent travels. His speaking skills were in demand from church groups eager to regard him as living vindication of the mission endeavour, and he addressed large congregations in Melbourne, Sydney, and Adelaide. His social and political message was conservative, often reflecting the views of the Aborigines' Friends' Association (AFA) which ran the Point McLeay mission; he considered that Aboriginal people should be brought into the mainstream of Australian society through enlightened paternalism and that, like him, they would respond to the effect of a favourable environment and Christian influence. He proclaimed: &#145;Look at me and you will see what the <span class="roman">Bible</span> can do.&#146;<br>
<br>In 1910 Unaipon accompanied the Point McLeay glee club to Hobart to participate in Tasmanian centenary commemorations. His troupe impersonated Tasmanian Aborigines; Unaipon played the organ. He did not share the views of the emerging voice of Aboriginal activism arising from eastern Australia, and in 1938 he rejected calls for involvement in a national day of mourning. In 1928 he led a delegation from Point McLeay calling for the reinstatement of the AFA control of the mission, which had become administered by the government after 1910. During the 1920s he supported the utopian scheme of a model Aboriginal state proposed for central Australia, but criticized attempts to insulate Aboriginal people from European contact by creating reserves. He and another moderate, the lay preacher James Noble, were suggested as Aboriginal representatives for federal parliament.<br>
<br>Precocious and self-possessed in his urbanity, Unaipon subverted popular notions of an inarticulate and primitive Aboriginality. When steamerloads of tourists visited Point McLeay to see the natives, Unaipon demonstrated his perpetual motion prototype machine, lecturing the visitors on Aboriginal astronomy, botany, and bushcraft, and calling for donations. The press hailed him, perhaps ironically, as the Black Leonardo. Unaipon took out nine patent applications between 1909 and 1944. His particular interest lay in converting rotary to linear motion, and he drew inspiration from the flight of the boomerang. He produced a prototype of a shearing handpiece after 1910, but the device did not go into production.<br>
<br>Unaipon was called upon to advise anthropologists, particularly during the 1914 meeting of the Australasian Association for the Advancement of Science; these interviews encouraged his interest in Aboriginal and European mythology. He began gathering Aboriginal legends while working in the country in South Australia, Victoria, and New South Wales as an itinerant pedlar for the AFA. During the 1920s he signed a contract with the publishers Angus and Robertson for a book of children's Aboriginal stories. He submitted several, but they baulked at his blend of fairy tale, popular science, Aboriginal legend, and Christian morality. He published two stories with AFA support, becoming the first Aboriginal author in print, but Angus and Robertson transferred the rights in his collection to William Ramsay Smith, who edited and published them without acknowledgement as <span class="italic">Myths and Legends of the Australian Aborigines</span> (1930).<br>
<br>Unaipon lived until the age of ninety-four, dying at Point McLeay on 8 February 1967. In 1992 his portrait appeared on the Australian $50 note. Now remembered for his writings, Unaipon achieved his main impact through public speaking, delivering a potent message that his people were actors in the historical present, not in a primitive past.<br>
