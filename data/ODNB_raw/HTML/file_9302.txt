<span class="headword">Fenwick, Sir  John</span>, first baronet  (1579&#150;<em>c.</em>1658), <span class="occ">politician and landowner</span>, was the son of Sir William Fenwick (<i>c</i>.1550&#150;1613) of Wallington, Northumberland, and his wife, Grace, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9910/', "Sir John Forster")</script> of Edderstone. His parents married in 1579, and he is recorded as thirty-five in his father's inquisition post mortem in 1614. The Fenwicks were a powerful county family. From his father John inherited Fenwick, East Matfen, Wallington, Camboe, Walker, Eshington, Gunnerton, Ryal, Sweethope, Harewood, and several other rents and smaller properties. John's maternal grandfather had already settled on him in April 1602 the manor of Hexham, along with extensive further properties and incomes. In 1618 he purchased Rothley from William, Lord Eure, for &pound;1000 and in 1632 the regality of Hexham. Together these properties gave him significant interests in coal- and lead-mining. He was noted for the horses he bred&#151;&#145;the best horses ever was in England for coursing&#146;, according to his nephew&#151;and suffered huge losses during the civil war from the requisitions of the Scottish army for cavalry mounts  (Underdown, 50). As lieutenant of Tynemouth Castle he was granted 100 marks a year out of the rents of the ninth earl of Northumberland, when the disgraced earl was restored as governor, and he was allowed to remain in post after Northumberland was released from the Tower in 1621.<br>
<br>Fenwick married three times. In 1602 he wedded Catherine, daughter of Sir Ralph Slingsby of Scriven, a client of the Percys. Their only son, John, was killed fighting for his king at Marston Moor. The couple also had two daughters, Catherine and Elizabeth. About 1620 he married Grace Loraine, with whom he had a daughter, Grace, and two sons, the future Sir William Fenwick (<i>d</i>. 1676), father of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9304/', "Sir John Fenwick")</script>, the Jacobite conspirator executed in 1697, and Allan (<i>d</i>. 1673). His third wife, about whom very little is known, was the daughter of a Mr Bone.<br>
<br>Fenwick purchased a baronetcy in 1628, and served as a knight of the shire for Northumberland in every parliamentary session from 1624 until the civil war; only in the Long Parliament did he initially represent another seat, Cockermouth (probably through Percy influence) between February 1641 and January 1642, before choosing to sit again for Northumberland when a seat was vacated there. As deputy lieutenant in the county he was active in mustering forces against the Scots, and he remained loyal to the crown through most of the first civil war; these royalist sympathies being manifest, he was excluded from the Commons on 22 January 1644. In December that year Fenwick was captured by parliamentarian forces while riding towards Banbury and, deciding that co-operation was the safest course, he subsequently accepted the new regime, being appointed high sheriff of Northumberland and being readmitted to the House of Commons on 26 June 1646. He was also named a member of a commission for the conservation of peace between England and Scotland, appointed in the same year. Thereafter, with advancing years and with the English revolution taking ever more extreme forms, he kept a lower profile and abstained from attending the house after Pride's Purge. He died about 1658.<br>
