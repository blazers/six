<span class="headword">Pond,  Edward</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1629), <span class="occ">almanac maker</span>, was born and educated around Ingatestone, Essex. His family background is unknown, though an Edward Pond was recorded at Fryerning in 1572 and another was baptized at Great Waltham on 10 March 1576. According to his almanacs Pond lived variously at Billericay (1602 and 1610) and Chelmsford (1609), and in 1611 he had a shop at the Globe outside Temple Bar in London selling clocks, watches, and mathematical instruments.<br>
<br>Pond published a series of almanacs from 1601 to 1612 and from 1625; others may not have survived. They were variously calculated for London, Chelmsford, Stamford, and Peterborough and that for 1602 was dedicated to Sir John Peter (Petre?) of Essex. His almanacs offered a miscellany of essays, chronologies, astrological prognostications, calendars, advice on health and husbandry, and a woodcut zodiac man. They were written, he claimed, &#145;In a most plaine &amp; vulgar manner, for the better and more easie understanding of the unlearned, or those of a meane capacity&#146;  (<span class="italic">Pond's Almanac, 1603</span>).<br>
<br>Pond's almanacs were successful and spawned a number of imitators. In October 1623 the Stationers' Company, believing they held a monopoly on printing almanacs, petitioned the privy council, complaining that Cantrell Legge, the Cambridge University printer, was infringing upon their patents. They claimed that he still printed an ABC and Pond almanacs, notwithstanding a prison sentence from Star Chamber, and requested that the matter be referred to the privy council. In December the council declared that the university and the company had joint rights in all books, save bibles, privileged to the university, and almanacs, which belonged exclusively to the company. The university printer ignored the judgment.<br>
<br>Pond also wrote some didactic works promoting astrology and related disciplines. In his parts of <span class="italic">A Helpe to Discourse</span> (1619), where he is described as &#145;Philomathem&#146;, he offers answers to questions on astronomy, astrology, mathematics, and natural history. In his almanac for the year 1604 he defends astrology and astronomy as a means to the proper appreciation of God's creation, and suggests that the common criticisms of these arts are more properly directed at those who abuse them. His labours are, he says, &#145;taken for the common good of all men&#146;  (<span class="italic">Pond's Almanac, 1604</span>, sig. A2<i>r</i>).<br>
<br>Pond died in 1629: the register of St John the Baptist, Peterborough, records the burial of &#145;Edward Pond Gent. Famous for Mathematical Science&#146; on 10 September. He was remembered in the most famous ballad of the civil war, Martin Parker's &#145;When the king enjoys his own again&#146;, in which the speaker asserts, against parliamentarian prognosticators, &#145;My skill goes beyond the depth of a Pond&#146; (written 1644&#150;7). Pond's death did not halt the publication of his popular almanac, which continued, under a modified title and prepared for Saffron Walden, at least until 1709.<br>
