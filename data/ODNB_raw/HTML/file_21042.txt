<span class="headword">Owen <span class="st"> [Owens]</span>,  Owen</span>  (1543/4&#150;1593), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, the son of Owen ap Robert, was born at Bodsilin, in Aber, Caernarvonshire, where the house still bears the family inscription. He matriculated at Christ's College, Cambridge, at Easter 1560. He graduated BA in 1560&#150;61, MA in 1564, when he was identified as Ovinus Owen, and incorporated at Oxford on 21 February 1566. He was ordained deacon, in London in 1566, and priest in February 1567, when he was identified as &#145;scholar of Christ's, aged 23&#146;.<br>
<br>Owen became rector of Burton Latimer, Northamptonshire, in 1567, which remained his permanent home. He married Margaret Matthews and, after her death, Jane, daughter of Robert Griffith of Caernarfon, with whom he had five sons and three daughters. His eldest son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21014/', "John Owen")</script>, was baptized at Burton Latimer in 1580. Despite a long sojourn in England, he maintained firm links with Wales. He was instituted to Llangeinwen, with the chapel of Llangaffo, Anglesey, by Nicholas Robinson, bishop of Bangor, on 11 August 1573. Robinson appointed him a canon and prebendary of Bangor Cathedral on 28 December 1576. He served as archdeacon of Anglesey, drawing an income of &pound;58 10<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>., from 1583 until his death. His appointment was not recorded in Robinson's register, which provides very limited information about cathedral dignitaries, but his tenure was noted by Henry Rowlands in the eighteenth century and his name occurs in modern lists of archdeacons. He was the last archdeacon of Anglesey to hold the office <i>pleno jure</i> (with full legal right); after his death the bishops of Bangor held it <i>in commendam</i> (with enjoyment of revenues). The late sixteenth century was a period when very few dignitaries resided in the diocese, and it would appear that he continued to live at Burton Latimer, where he died, and was buried on 21 March 1593. His successor at Llangeinwen was appointed on 4 May 1593. His eldest son, John, the future bishop of St Asaph, was still a youth when Owen died, but he succeeded to the rectory of Burton Latimer in 1608.<br>
