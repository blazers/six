<span class="headword">Baine,  James</span>  (1710&#150;1790), <span class="occ">minister of the Relief church</span>, was born at Bonhill, Dunbartonshire, the son of the Revd James Baine (1676&#150;1755) and Grizel, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Semple (<i>d</i>. 1756). He was educated at the parish school, then at the grammar school in Dumbarton before studying at the universities of Glasgow and Edinburgh. He gained his MA at Glasgow on 4 May 1725. Baine was ordained to the ministry of Killearn parish church in 1732 and became involved in the evangelical awakening associated with the preaching of George Whitefield in 1742. On 22 May 1740 he married Margaret Potter, daughter of Michael Potter, professor of divinity at Glasgow University; they had three sons and three daughters. As an opponent of patronage in 1752 he opposed the deposition of Thomas Gillespie over his refusal to be involved in the induction of the new minister of Inverkeithing and identified himself with the popular party within the established church, &#145;one well known for his Ministerial Abilities and particularly eminent for his constant struggle for Christian and ministerial liberty&#146;  (South College Relief church minutes, NA Scot., CH3/433.1, fol. 10<i>r</i>).<br>
<br>In 1756 Baine was translated to the charge of first minister of the high kirk in Paisley, although by the 1760s he had become disenchanted with the established church. When he had come to Paisley a general kirk session administered the affairs of the high kirk as well as those of the Lairgh kirk parish where John Witherspoon was the minister. Baine asked the presbytery of Paisley to allow him to have a separate kirk session but they refused. Baine may have felt that his own position and prestige as a parish minister had been undermined. When Baine resigned his charge in Paisley he claimed that the major reason was that he was now &#145;advanced in life&#146; and the &#145;high church&#146; was &#145;commonly so crowded&#146; and was &#145;much beyond his strength&#146;  (Dickson, 8).<br>
<br>Between August 1762 and August 1764 there was controversy within Edinburgh over the settlement of a minister of Lady Yester's Church. The moderate party within the Edinburgh presbytery believed that they had an opportunity to end the dominance which the popular party exercised over settlements within the city. When the moderates eventually triumphed Thomas Gillespie, founder of the Relief church, received a letter from a group who were determined to leave Lady Yester's Church and asked for Gillespie's advice. On 15 January 1765 a group of ninety-two subscribers indicated that they would form a Relief congregation and issued a call to Baine. Baine accepted their invitation and was inducted as the minister of the new Relief congregation by Thomas Gillespie in February 1766.<br>
<br>That his new church could seat up to 1200 and that he played an active part in its affairs gives the lie to his claim that he left his former position because of pressures of work. Although Baine left the Church of Scotland with feelings of resentment, he retained his commitment to Presbyterianism. His letter of resignation clearly stated that<blockquote>this change of my condition, and charge I have accepted, makes no change in my creed or Christian belief; none in my principles of Christian and ministerial communion; nay, none in my cordial regard to the constitution and interests of the Church of Scotland &hellip; at the same time, I abhor &hellip; that abuse of Church power of late, which to me appears &hellip; destructive of the ends of our office as ministers of Christ.</blockquote>Baine denied that the presbytery of Relief had any separating principles because they &#145;dare not decline communion with any who have the knowledge, the visible uncorrupted profession of real Christianity&#146;  (Dickson, 9&#150;10).<br>
<br>Baine was one of the ablest and most influential ministers within the early years of the Relief church. He championed the cause of congregations to call the minister of their own choice, even in the case of Blairlogie in 1769 when doubts were raised by Thomas Gillespie over the orthodoxy of Alexander Pirie. Gillespie believed that the only constraint to the free choice of any congregation was the suitability of the candidate, which the presbytery had the right to oversee. Baine believed that such a responsibility lay in the local congregation who should be able to exercise a free choice over the election of their minister. In the 1770s he became involved in two controversies, one in which he opposed the influence of James Cowan, minister of Colinsburgh, who held stricter views regarding the open communion than the founders of the Relief church, and the other in which he published a sermon against the theatre, <span class="italic">The Theatre Licentious and Perverted</span> (1770). Baine was especially critical of the portrayal by Samuel Foote of the preaching of George Whitefield and addressed further criticisms in his <span class="italic">Letter to Samuel Foote</span> published the following year. He died on 17 January 1790, aged eighty, maintaining to the end of his life his commitment to the principles of religious liberty and catholicity which characterized the Relief church from its earliest days. An earlier collection of sermons published in 1778 was followed by a posthumously published volume of <span class="italic">Select Sermons</span> (1850).<br>
