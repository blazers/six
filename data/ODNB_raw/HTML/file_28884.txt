</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Watts,  Alaric Alexander</span>  (1797&#150;1864), <span class="occ">journalist and poet</span>, was born in London on 16 March 1797, the youngest son of John Mosley Watts, of an old Leicestershire and Northamptonshire family, and his wife, Sarah, the daughter of Samuel Bolton, of Fair Mile, near Henley-on-Thames, Oxfordshire. His parents separated, apparently in his infancy, owing to his father's disreputable conduct, and were consequently involved in a lengthy chancery suit. His mother, an able and cultivated woman, did all that she could to bring up her children and to see that they were properly educated. In 1808 Watts went to Wye College Grammar School, Kent, where his eldest brother was an assistant master and where he spent a happy year or two. When he and his brother moved in 1810 to an academy at Ashford, Kent, kept by the Revd Alexander Power, he had a more miserable time, but acquired a good knowledge of French from an &eacute;migr&eacute; teacher, which stood him in good stead in later years. At the same time, a new imaginative world was opened to him when he read John Bell's 109-volume collection of <span class="italic">The Poets of Great Britain</span> (1782), Shakespeare, Fielding, Smollett, and Goldsmith.<br>
<br>After leaving the academy in 1812, Watts held a variety of posts. He was an usher in a school in Fulham, Middlesex, kept by the Revd George Crabb and then a private tutor in the family of Bartholomew Ruspini, the prince regent's dentist. In the latter employment he met George Cruikshank and Byron, among others. In 1816 he became a clerk in the office of the controller of army accounts but very soon afterwards moved to Runcorn, Cheshire, as an assistant teacher in a boys' boarding-school. When the school changed ownership he was employed as a tutor to the son of a Manchester manufacturer. With his heart set on a literary career, he was beginning to have poems published in periodicals. From January to June 1819, when he was only twenty-two years old, he edited the <span class="italic">New Monthly Magazine</span>. At about this time he met the Revd Charles Maturin (author of <span class="italic">Melmoth the Wanderer</span>), who asked him to superintend the production at Covent Garden in May 1819 of his tragedy, <span class="italic">Fredolfo</span>. Although the actors included Charles Kemble and William Macready, the performance was a failure.<br>
<br>On 16 September 1821, at Woburn, Bedfordshire, Watts married Priscilla Maden Wiffen (1799&#150;1873), always known as Zillah, who belonged to a prominent Quaker family. The Society of Friends disowned her, however, upon her marriage. A son, who died in infancy, was born to them on 23 August 1822. Another son, Alaric Alfred, was born on 18 February 1825 and a daughter, Zillah, on Christmas day 1831. Alaric Alfred married Anna Maria Howitt, the elder daughter of William and Mary Howitt, in 1859. Watts had expressive and mobile features, thick, silky hair, and a sallow complexion. His occasional irritability and hot temper were liable to lead him into quarrels and litigation which sometimes had unfortunate consequences, but he found comfort in a secure domestic life. An extravagant man, he filled his places of residence with books, pictures, and <i>objets d'art</i>, many of which he had not fully paid for.<br>
<br>Thanks to his association with William Jerdan, Watts regularly contributed to the <span class="italic">Literary Gazette</span> in the early 1820s, including a series of papers (24 February &#150; 17 March 1821), &#145;Lord Byron's plagiarisms&#146;, in which he juxtaposed passages from Byron with passages from other poets. &#145;An Austrian army awfully arrayed&#146;, a piece popular with anthologists of light verse, appeared in the <span class="italic">Literary Gazette</span> on 23 December 1820 (826&#150;7) in an article on alliteration and is sometimes attributed to Watts. He contributed to other periodicals, including the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> and possibly <span class="italic">Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine</span>, and brought out a volume, <span class="italic">Poetical Sketches</span>, in 1822 (with further editions in 1823 and 1824). These poems, conventionally Romantic in content and form, have long been forgotten, but Lamb and Wordsworth, among others, seem to have admired them. At the end of 1822 he became the editor of the <span class="italic">Leeds Intelligencer</span> at a salary of &pound;300 a year. After a controversial beginning, in which he attacked the factory owners' treatment of their workers and hence lost subscribers, he eventually made the paper successful. But in 1825 he moved to Manchester, where he established the <span class="italic">Manchester Courier</span>, remaining its editor for about a year.<br>
<br>Watts claimed that between 1827 and 1847 he established or assisted in establishing upwards of twenty conservative periodicals. With Charles Baldwin and Stanley Lees Giffard he founded <span class="italic">The Standard</span>, a right-wing newspaper, in 1827. From 1833 to 1841 he published and edited the <span class="italic">United Services Gazette</span>. Although he aimed in the <span class="italic">Gazette</span> to criticize patronage and other abuses in the armed forces, he broadly supported the <i>status quo</i> because of his tory sympathies.<br>
<br>For literary historians Watts's main achievement is his editorship and later proprietorship of two annuals, the <span class="italic">Literary Souvenir</span> (1824&#150;35) and its successor, the <span class="italic">Cabinet of Modern Art</span> (1836&#150;7). Annuals, elegantly produced volumes of selected prose, verse, and engravings on sale at Christmas, were fashionable at the time, with over sixty appearing in 1832, for example. Among the most popular were <span class="italic">Forget-me-not</span>, <span class="italic">Friendship's Offering</span>, and <span class="italic">The Keepsake</span>. Zillah Watts, who often associated herself with her husband's work, also edited an annual, the <span class="italic">New Year's Gift</span> (1829&#150;36). Among the contributors to Watts's early numbers were Scott, Coleridge, Southey, Campbell, and Felicia Hemans. The engravings were mostly of pictures by minor artists, though Turner was represented, and, as a result of yearly excursions he made to Paris from 1828 to 1831, Watts was also able to include engravings of French pictures. He used work by contributors to the <span class="italic">Literary Souvenir</span> in the <span class="italic">Literary Magnet</span>, which he owned between 1825 and 1828. In addition to his involvement in journalism he published a collection of contemporary verse, <span class="italic">Fugitive Poetry</span> (2 vols., 1828&#150;9).<br>
<br>A feud which had developed between Watts and William Maginn and others on <span class="italic">Fraser's Magazine</span> culminated in Watts's depiction as Alaric Attila Watts in the &#145;Gallery of illustrious literary characters&#146; (<span class="italic">Fraser's Magazine</span> 11, June 1835, 652; repr. in W. Bates's edition of the <span class="italic">Gallery</span> 1873, 161&#150;3). Watts thought that Daniel Maclise's drawing and Maginn's accompanying description made some scurrilous imputations concerning his honour and honesty. He therefore brought an action for libel on 5 December 1835, winning damages of &pound;150 but later claiming that the attacks helped to bring about the decline of the <span class="italic">Literary Souvenir</span>.<br>
<br>In the 1840s Watts, who had seldom been free from debt, increasingly found himself in financial difficulties, which were exacerbated by lawsuits which absorbed much of his energy over seven years. He severed all connection with the press in 1847 and was made a bankrupt in 1849 (but was discharged on 13 August 1850). In 1851, however, his <span class="italic">Lyrics of the Heart</span> appeared, and in 1853 his biographical sketch of Turner was prefixed to <span class="italic">Liber fluviorum</span>, a volume of engravings of some of the painter's work.<br>
<br>The days of Watts's multifarious literary and journalistic activities were over. In 1853 he became a clerk in the Inland Revenue office at Somerset House in London, where his son was employed in a senior position. On 7 January 1854 he was awarded a civil-list pension of &pound;100 a year in consideration of services rendered by him to literature and art. He edited the 1857 edition of <span class="italic">Men of the Time</span>, the biographical compendium, and included a lengthy autobiographical entry. His life became comfortable and uneventful and he delighted in re-reading and annotating at leisure the poetry of Chaucer, Spenser, Milton, and Dryden. After suffering a stroke Watts died on 5 April 1864 at his home in Blenheim Crescent, Notting Hill, London, and was buried in Highgate cemetery in London. He was survived by his wife.<br>
