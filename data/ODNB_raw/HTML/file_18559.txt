<span class="headword">Mends, Sir  William Robert</span>  (1812&#150;1897), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, the eldest son of Admiral William Bowen Mends (1781&#150;1864) and his wife, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Dawe, and the nephew of Sir Robert Mends, was born at Plymouth on 27 February 1812. After attending Haverfordwest grammar school and Plymouth School, in May 1825 he entered the Royal Naval College at Portsmouth, and shortly after passing out in December 1826 was appointed to the frigate <i>Thetis</i> (46 guns), going to the South American station. He was in the <i>Thetis</i> when she was wrecked on Cape Frio on 5 December 1830. It was Mends's watch when the ship struck, but as the night was dark with heavy rain he was held guiltless. He was considered to have behaved well in a difficult situation, and several of the members of the court offered to take him with them. After passing his examination he joined the <i>Actaeon</i> in the Mediterranean, which in 1832 was at Constantinople when a Russian army of upwards of 20,000 men arrived there after the defeat of the Turks by Ibrahim Pasha at Konya. The intervention of the western powers secured the withdrawal of this force, and Mends observed its embarkation, making careful notes of their methods of embarking the cavalry and guns. In the summer of 1834 the <i>Actaeon</i> returned to England and was paid off, and in January 1835 Mends was appointed to the <i>Pique</i> with Captain Henry John Rous. In July the ship was sent out to Canada, and on the homeward voyage, on 22 September, struck heavily on a reef off the coast of Labrador. After a perilous and for a time rudderless voyage, Mends reached St Helen's on 13 October, and learned that he had been promoted lieutenant on 11 August.<br>
<br>In December, Mends joined the <i>Vernon</i> at Malta. A year later he was moved into the <i>Caledonia</i> and then to the <i>Rodney</i>, from which, in July 1838, he went to be flag lieutenant of Sir John Louis, the second in command on the station and superintendent of Malta Dockyard. At Malta, in December 1837, he married Melita (<i>d</i>. 1894), the daughter of Dr Stilon, a Neapolitan by birth who had served as a medical officer in the French army at Maida and been sent as a prisoner to England, where he married and entered the navy; some years later he settled in private practice at Malta. Mends and his wife had a son and four daughters. Mends continued with Louis, sometimes afloat, but mostly at Malta, until July 1843. From November 1843 he was in the frigate <i>Fox</i> with Sir Henry Blackwood on the coast of Ireland and in the East Indies. On 2 January 1847 he received the news of his promotion, on 9 November 1846, to commander. In January 1848 he was appointed to the <i>Vanguard</i>, in which, a couple of months later, he lost some of the fingers of his left hand, which was carried into a block and badly crushed. It was this, more than the loss of the fingers, which caused trouble, and for years afterwards he suffered from severe attacks of neuralgia. The <i>Vanguard</i> went home and was paid off in March 1849, and in July 1850 Mends was appointed to the <i>Vengeance</i>, again with Blackwood, who, however, died after a short illness at Portsmouth on 7 January 1851, and was succeeded by Lord Edward Russell. Towards the end of the summer the <i>Vengeance</i> went to the Mediterranean, but came home in December 1852; on the 10th Mends was promoted captain in acknowledgement of the excellent order of the ship.<br>
<br>In October 1853 Mends was selected by Sir Edmund Lyons to be his flag captain in the Mediterranean, if Captain Symonds, then in the <i>Arethusa</i>, should prefer to remain in the frigate. If not, Mends would take the <i>Arethusa</i> [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26891/', "Symonds, Sir Thomas Matthew Charles")</script>]. Mends took the <i>Agamemnon</i> out and joined the fleet in the Sea of Marmora on Christmas eve, and then took command of the <i>Arethusa</i>. In her he took a particularly brilliant part in the bombardment of Odessa on 22 April 1854, attacking the Mole fortifications. He was promptly recalled by the commander-in-chief, who seems to have considered that he was needlessly risking the ship.<blockquote>I expected a reprimand when I went on board the admiral to report, but the enthusiasm of the fleet and the cheers given to us as we passed along the lines mollified the chief, and I was simply told not to go in again. (Mends, 102)</blockquote>In June, Lyons and Symonds had found that they did not get on well together, and Mends agreed to re-exchange into the <i>Agamemnon</i>. From that time his individuality is lost in that of the admiral. Lyons refused the services of a captain of the fleet because Mends was so successful in his dual role of flag captain and chief of Lyons's staff; he had the direction of those points of detail on which much depended. By far the most important of these were the admirably implemented embarkation of the troops at Varna and the landing of them in the Crimea on 14 September. Lyons and the navy fully recognized that the credit belonged to Mends.<br>
<br>In February 1855 Lyons moved his flag to the <i>Royal Albert</i>, and Mends accompanied him. In all the operations of the year he had his full share, and he was made a CB on 5 July. He continued in command of the <i>Royal Albert</i> until March 1857, when he was appointed to the <i>Hastings</i> and later the <i>Majestic</i>, guardships in the Mersey, from which, four years later, he was appointed deputy controller-general of the coastguard at the Admiralty. He held this office for about a year, and in May 1862 was appointed director of transports, responsible for the transport department of the Admiralty. Here he remained more than twenty years, during which there were several exceptional calls on his department which were successfully met. Among these the most important were the initial organization of the Indian troopship service in the mid-1860s, the expedition to Abyssinia, moving Indian troops to Malta in 1879, the Anglo-Asante and Anglo-Zulu wars, and the occupation of Egypt in 1882. On 1 January 1869 Mends became a retired rear-admiral, although he remained in service. The decision to end his sea-going career was not taken lightly. He earned further appointments and promotions: KCB (20 May 1871), vice-admiral (1 January 1874), admiral (15 June 1879), and GCB (24 November 1882), the last with special reference to his work on the expedition to Egypt. In 1871 he went to India to report on the Indian marine.<br>
<br>In February 1883 Mends retired and settled down at Alverstoke, within easy distance of his many old friends at Portsmouth. Here he lived peacefully for the next twelve years. In July 1894 his wife died after a short illness, a blow that seriously affected him, though he survived for three years. He died at his home, 3A Anglesey Crescent, Alverstoke, Hampshire, on 26 June 1897, the day of the great jubilee naval review. Mends's career demonstrated the limits placed on even the most brilliant officers by a lack of connection and patronage in the mid-nineteenth-century navy. Only through his close connection with Henry Blackwood and Lord Lyons, both of whom appreciated his outstanding abilities as a seaman and organizer, did Mends rise as far as he did, and both men died before they could render him much service.<br>
