<span class="headword">Fede,  Innocenzo</span>  (1661?&#150;1732), <span class="occ">composer</span>, was born in Rome, probably in 1661, the son of Antonio Maria Fede. Originally from Pistoia, his family had moved in the 1650s to Rome, where two of his uncles were castrati of the papal choir. Having failed to obtain a place as a tenor in the choir in 1683, he became the <i>maestro di cappella</i> at the Spanish church in Rome (1684&#150;5).<br>
<br>In 1685 or 1686 Fede was invited to England to become the master of the music of James II's new Catholic chapel at Whitehall. He was presumably accompanied by his wife, Caterina Bertolini (<i>d</i>. before 1717). It opened on Christmas day 1686 and for the next two years Fede played an important role in the musical life of the English court. He accompanied the king and queen to Windsor in the summers of 1687 and 1688, and composed the music for the celebrations to mark the birth of the prince of Wales in June 1688. He helped to introduce the latest Roman musical styles to England, particularly the sonatas of Corelli, but none of his own compositions from this period seem to have survived. He would have had more influence if his career at Whitehall had not been abruptly ended by the revolution of 1688.<br>
<br>Following his wife, who left in November 1688, Fede left England at the end of February 1689 and joined the court of James II and Mary of Modena in exile at St Germain-en-Laye, where he was appointed master of the music of both the Chapel Royal and his majesty's private musick. He remained there for more than twenty years and directed a small group of mainly Italian musicians, most of whom had previously been employed at Whitehall. He made the English court at St Germain an important centre of Italian music and thus played a major role in introducing Italian styles to France during the 1690s. He also taught music and the Italian language to the prince of Wales and his sister Princess Louise-Marie.<br>
<br>Fede was active in organizing secular concerts for the Jacobite court, particularly in the ten years following the death of James II in 1701. He continued to serve Mary of Modena in the Chapel Royal until her death in 1718. At the end of the following year he left France to return to Rome, where he was given a monthly pension by his former pupil, the Jacobite James VIII and III.<br>
<br>Innocenzo Fede was soon forgotten and has been completely neglected by posterity, partly because the archives of both the Catholic chapel at Whitehall and the Stuart court at St Germain were destroyed. It is only recently that his importance in the introduction of Italian music to both England and France has begun to be appreciated. Manuscripts containing some of his instrumental and vocal music have survived, but no copies have yet emerged of his only known publication (some flute sonatas, &Eacute;tienne Roger, Amsterdam, 1703). Nothing is known about Fede's life after he returned to Rome in 1720. He died, presumably in Rome, on Christmas day 1732.<br>
