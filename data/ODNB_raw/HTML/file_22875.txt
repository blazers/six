<span class="headword">Pullan,  Richard Popplewell</span>  (1825&#150;1888), <span class="occ">architect and archaeologist</span>, was born on 27 March 1825 at Knaresborough in Yorkshire, the son of Samuel Popplewell Pullan (<i>b</i>. 1796), solicitor, and his wife, Eliza, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Dewes. He was educated at Christ's Hospital, became a Grecian, and was afterwards a pupil of Richard Lane, architect and surveyor, of Manchester, along with Alfred Waterhouse. At Manchester, Pullan studied old missals and illuminated manuscripts in Chetham's Library, and became interested in medievalism. He developed a passion for heraldry, and amused himself by producing coloured pedigrees. In 1844 he submitted a design for the royal robing-room of Queen Victoria at the House of Lords. This was praised for its richness of colour, though Pullan was considered too young to be awarded the commission. Subsequently he produced stained glass designs and retained a lifelong interest in the study and practice of polychromy. He wrote extensively on architectural matters and read a number of papers at meetings of the Royal Institute of British Architects.<br>
<br>On 24 February 1859 Pullan married Mary Leschallas Burges, the sister of William Burges, the architect. They had no children. Mary Pullan later travelled throughout Asia Minor with her husband, and on the death of her brother, William Burges, in 1881 she and Pullan moved to the house Burges had built for himself in Melbury Road, London. During a visit to Italy Pullan studied church architecture. On his return he helped Sir Digby Wyatt with the polychrome decoration of the Byzantine and medieval courts of the Crystal Palace, which were opened by Queen Victoria on 10 June 1854. In October of that year Pullan went to Sevastopol and made sketches and models of the contours of the district which was under siege. When he returned home he exhibited a model of the country and the fortifications about Sevastopol.<br>
<br>In 1856, in conjunction with (Charles Emmanuel?) Evans, he entered the Lille Cathedral competition and won a silver medal. In 1857 the Foreign Office appointed him as architect to the expedition which was being sent to survey the mausoleum at Halicarnassus, which Charles Newton had excavated in 1856. Pullan arrived at Bodrum on 25 August 1857. He not only measured the architectural remains, but attempted a restoration of the mausoleum, in accordance with the descriptions of Pliny the elder, Hyginus, and Guichard.<br>
<br>On Newton's instructions Pullan then went to Cnidus, where he discovered a gigantic figure of a lion, 10 feet long and 6 feet high, weighing, with its case, 11 tons. This he sent to Britain, and it is now in the Elgin room of the British Museum. He made a restoration of the tomb which the lion had crowned, a survey of the principal sites in the island of Kos, and drawings of the remains. All these restorations are recorded in <span class="italic">A History of Discoveries at Halicarnassus, Cnidus, and Branchidae, by C. T. Newton, M.A., Assisted by R. P. Pullan</span> (1862&#150;3).<br>
<br>After this the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/92790', "Society of Dilettanti")</script> employed Pullan on further similar investigations. In April 1862 he began excavations on the site of the Temple of Bacchus at Teos, where he found the temple to be hexastyle (as described by Vitruvius in <span class="italic">De architectura</span>, vol. 3, chap. 3), with eleven columns on the flanks, rather than pseudodipteral, and so proved that it was not the one built by Hermogenes. Instead he believed that it had been erected in Roman times.<br>
<br>In 1862 Pullan visited the remains of the Temple of Apollo Smintheus, or the &#145;mouse-queller&#146;, near Kulakli, in the Troad, which had been discovered by Thomas Spratt in 1853. In 1864 he published, with Charles F. Texier, <span class="italic">Byzantine architecture, illustrated by examples, with historical and archaeological descriptions</span> and in 1865 they published <span class="italic">The Principal Ruins of Asia Minor Illustrated and Described</span>. He returned to Smyrna on 5 August 1866, and completed the excavation and drawings on 22 November 1866. He found sufficient remains to show that it was an octastyle pseudodipteral temple, with only fourteen columns on the flank, being superior to the Temple of Minerva Polias at Priene, and probably of about the same date. In 1869 Pullan, under an order from the society, excavated the site of the Temple of Minerva Polias at Priene, which had hitherto been encumbered with ruins. Accounts of Pullan's work on the three temples were published in the fourth part of <span class="italic">The Antiquities of Ionia</span> (1881).<br>
<br>At the same time Pullan visited most of the Byzantine churches in Greece and Asia Minor, and published an account of the examples of Byzantine and classical work that had been accumulated by himself and Charles Texier in two volumes, entitled respectively <span class="italic">Byzantine Architecture</span> (1864), and <span class="italic">Principal Ruins of Asia Minor</span> (1865). On Pullan's advice Lord Savile, the British ambassador at Rome, undertook excavations on his property at Civita Lavinia, on the Alban hills (Lanuvium), where the ruins of the imperial villa of Antoninus Pius were discovered, and magnificent fragments of sculpture, as well as some archaic terracottas. Pullan's other publications include: <span class="italic">The Altar, its Baldachin and Reredos</span> (1873); <span class="italic">Eastern Cities and Italian Towns: with Notes of their Architecture</span> (1879); <span class="italic">Studies in Architectural Style</span> (1883); and <span class="italic">Studies in Cathedral Design</span> (1888).<br>
<br>Pullan managed to combine a good London-based architectural practice with his archaeological explorations. He became a fellow of the RIBA in 1861. He competed for the memorial churches at St Petersburg and Constantinople, for Truro and Lille cathedrals, the War and Foreign offices, the Liverpool exchange buildings, the Natural History Museum (South Kensington), the Glasgow municipal buildings, the Dublin Museum, and the Hamburg town hall. His principal executed works were churches at Pontresina and Baveno in Italy, and the conversion of Castel Aleggio, between Lake Maggiore and Lake Orta, into an English Gothic mansion. The church at Baveno is octagonal in plan, and of the Lombard type, and was built for the numismatist Henry William Henfrey in the grounds of his villa. The whole of the coloured decoration was designed by Pullan&#151;much of it was also executed by him&#151;and a drawing of it was exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1882. On the death of Pullan's brother-in-law William Burges, in 1881, he completed all Burges's unfinished works, and edited his posthumously published works.<br>
<br>Pullan was a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries and a member of the Royal Archaeological Institute. A long-term sufferer from bronchitis, he died at 1 Oriental Place, Brighton, on 30 April 1888.<br>
