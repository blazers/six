<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Blount,  Martha</span>  (1690&#150;1763), <span class="occ">Roman Catholic gentlewoman</span>, was born on 15 June 1690 at the family estate of Mapledurham, Berkshire, the third child (but second eldest surviving) of six born to Lister Blount (1654&#150;1710) and his wife, Martha (<i>d</i>. 1743), daughter of Anthony Englefield of Whiteknights, near Reading. She was known to family and friends as Patty, and her mother was known as Pax. Her sister <a name="cosubject_71166"></a><span class="headword">Teresa Maria Blount</span>  (1688&#150;1759)<span class="occ"></span>, born on 15 October 1688 in Paris, was the eldest of the surviving children. Both sisters were educated principally at the English Benedictine convent in Paris. Their father's death in 1710 revealed that the estate was in financial crisis, and resources were concentrated on the heir, their younger brother Michael. On his marriage in 1715 they and their mother left Mapledurham for accommodation in London. Although they received letters of elaborately teasing gallantry from other members of the young Catholic &eacute;lite (Teresa as Zephalinda and Martha as Parthenissa), the loss of their financial prospects effectively disqualified them from marriage.<br>
<br>The sisters had met Pope about 1707 through their grandfather Anthony Englefield. They constituted Pope's most intimate link with the Roman Catholic high society which provided the subject of <span class="italic">The Rape of the Lock</span>: Martha's godfather, John Caryll, commissioned the poem to smooth over the cutting of Arabella Fermor's hair by his ward, Lord Petre. Lord Petre himself had been commended to the sisters, if only in jest, as an object of matrimonial pursuit; and Arabella, on whose final match with a country gentleman Teresa wrote a caustic commentary, was their cousin. In 1716 Charles Jervas painted them as &#145;a Couplet&#146;, calling them &#145;Pope's Favorites&#146; and evoking in the balances and contrasts of the image something of the fascination that the sisters held for Pope: Martha, blonde, blue-eyed, and retiring, looks across at her sister, while Teresa, darker and more assertive, boldly confronts the viewer's gaze  (<span class="italic">Correspondence of Alexander Pope</span>, 1.332).<br>
<br>The vivacious and sharp-tongued Teresa seems at first to have been the more attractive to Pope: she was probably addressed in &#145;You Know Where&#146; (1710), and was certainly the addressee of &#145;Epistle to Miss Blount, with the Works of Voiture&#146; (1710) and &#145;Epistle to Miss Blount, on her Leaving the Town, after the Coronation&#146; (1714). (Martha had missed the coronation because she had smallpox.) &#145;Verses Sent to Mrs. T. B. with his Works&#146; (1718) suggest that Teresa was increasingly irritated by his attentions; and in the same year she took offence at his settling on her an annuity of &pound;40. Several letters suggest that he was on difficult terms with both sisters: he declared in a letter jointly addressed to both:<blockquote>I have some times found myself inclined to be in love with you: and as I have reason to know from your Temper &amp; Conduct how miserably I should be used in that circumstance, it is worth my while to avoid it. (<span class="italic">Correspondence of Alexander Pope</span>, 1.456)</blockquote>Another letter, refusing an invitation to visit, suggests that one of the sisters had rebuffed his advances: &#145;You will please to consider that my Coming or not is a thing Indifferent to both of you. But God knows, it is far otherwise to me, with respect to One of you&#146;  (ibid., 1.460). The &#145;One&#146; may have been Teresa, but she may equally, by this stage, have been Martha; for in listing his complaints against Teresa he accuses her of betraying his confidence by &#145;telling the party concern'd, it was all butt an Amusement occasiond by my Loss of another Lady&#146;  (ibid., 1.468). By the 1720s Pope and Teresa were irreconcilable: Pope claimed that she was having an affair with a married man, slandering him and Martha, and subjecting her mother to physical abuse.<br>
<br>In 1715 Pope had inscribed &#145;To a Lady with the Temple of Fame&#146; in Martha's presentation copy of <span class="italic">The Temple of Fame</span>, and in 1716 he hinted that she had asked him to delete a tribute to her which had originally formed the conclusion of <span class="italic">Eloisa to Abelard</span>. Martha enjoyed romances, evinced a &#145;Romantic&#146; response to landscape, disliked dressing formally, and was very shy: she found it very difficult to assert herself, and tended to confide ill usage to Pope rather than directly confronting those responsible. Increasingly Pope idealized her quieter and more introspective qualities. He encouraged her friendship with Henrietta Howard, countess of Suffolk, the king's mistress (although in later years his friendship for Lady Suffolk cooled, and Martha increasingly cultivated the Roman Catholic widow Elizabeth, Lady Gerard). Martha was often ill, and although Pope blamed this on domestic tension which he attributed to scandalous and violent behaviour on Teresa's part, Martha persistently refused to give in to his entreaties that she would set up house on her own. Martha's weakness (as he saw it) in staying with her family exasperated him, but stemmed from the same virtues of humility and loyalty which qualified her in his eyes as a properly good woman. Unlike the more obviously striking and articulate Teresa, this sensitive, retiring, but intensely loyal woman evoked his lifelong devotion.<br>
<br>In 1723 his verses on Martha's birthday implicitly offered himself as &#145;a Friend&#146;  (<span class="italic">Twickenham Edition</span>, 6.244&#150;7). She and Pope denied persistent rumours that she had become his mistress, fianc&eacute;e, or secret bride. In 1729 Caryll seems to have offered Pope a dowry for her, but he declared that &#145;I have no tie to your God-daughter but a good opinion, which has grown into a friendship with experience that she deserved it&#146;  (<span class="italic">Correspondence of Alexander Pope</span>, 3.74&#150;5). His <span class="italic">Epistle to a Lady: on the Characters of Women</span> (1735) contains his most substantial tribute to the qualities he found in her: she, though unnamed, is the &#145;Friend&#146; to whom Apollo has given &#145;Sense, Good-humour, and a Poet&#146;. She may also have been the tantalizing beloved of &#145;The First Ode of the Fourth Book of Horace&#146; (1737).<br>
<br>In later years some of Pope's newer friends resented Martha's long-established intimacy, and the feeling may have been mutual. A quarrel in 1743 at the home of Ralph Allen, a recent but crucial addition to Pope's circle, pitted Martha against the Allens and Pope's new prot&eacute;g&eacute; William Warburton, and she wrote to Pope in bitter terms:<blockquote>I hope you are well. I am not. My spirits are quite down, tho they should not. for these people deserve so much to be dispised, one should do nothing but Laugh &hellip; Mr Warburton takes no notice of me. tis most wonderfull. they have not one of `em named your name, nor drank your health since you went. they talk to one another without putting me at all in the conversation. (<span class="italic">Correspondence of Alexander Pope</span>, 4.462)</blockquote>Pope returned an agitated letter commiserating over &#145;such monstrous Treatment&#146;, and ended by declaring &#145;W. is a sneaking Parson, &amp; I told him he flatterd&#146;  (<span class="italic">Correspondence of Alexander Pope</span>, 4.463&#150;4). Warburton remained her enemy and circulated various anecdotes impugning her integrity, particularly through the materials he provided for Owen Ruffhead's <span class="italic">The Life of Alexander Pope</span> (1769).<br>
<br>In 1743 Pope arranged to buy a twenty-six-year lease on a house in Berkeley Street (or Row) for Martha. His last letter to her is a somewhat awkward attempt to explain his reconciliation with the Allens without making light of her anger. He pleads:<blockquote>Would to God you would Quicken your haste to settle, by reflecting what a pleasure it would be to me, just to see it, and to see you at ease; &amp; then I could contentedly leave you to the Providence of God, in this Life, &amp; resign my Self to it in the other! (<span class="italic">Correspondence of Alexander Pope</span>, 4.511)</blockquote>He closes by assuring her that &#145;I love you upon unalterable Principles, which makes me feel my heart the same to you as if I saw you every hour.&#146; He died in May 1744, and in his will, dated 12 December 1743, left her &pound;1000, his goods and chattels, and the income from his estate for life, which enraged his half-sister Magdalen Rackett, who later became another source of derogatory anecdotes about Martha.<br>
<br>Martha was now comfortably provided for and presided over a household of her own for the first time in her life, although she continued to lend Teresa small sums of money. In 1749 she spoke affectionately about Pope to Joseph Spence, who added a substantial group of her reminiscences to his collection of anecdotes. Horace Walpole, recognizing her in later life in the street on a rainy day &#145;with her petticoats tucked up like a sempstress&#146; and &#145;nothing remaining of her immortal charms but her <i>blue eyes</i>&#146;, was content to dismiss her as &#145;red-faced, fat, and by no means pretty&#146;  (Walpole, <span class="italic">Corr.</span>, 33.511).<br>
<br>Teresa died on 7 October 1759 after a long illness, and was buried in the churchyard of St Pancras in London (that is, Old St Pancras, a customary burial site for Catholics). Her estate was administered by her nephew Michael Blount of Mapledurham. Martha died suddenly at her Berkeley Street home on 12 July 1763 and was buried beside her sister. Apart from a few small legacies she left everything to her nephew Michael, father of her god-daughter Martha (&#145;Little Patty&#146;).<br>
