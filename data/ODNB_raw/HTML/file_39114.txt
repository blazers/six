<span class="headword">&AElig;lfhere</span>  (<em>d.</em> 983), <span class="occ">magnate</span>, was the son of Ealhhelm, ealdorman of central Mercia (what is now Worcestershire and Gloucestershire) from 940 to 951. &AElig;lfhere and his brothers are greeted as kinsmen by successive kings, though the degree of relationship is unknown. They were particularly close to Eadwig (<i>d</i>. 959), who appointed &AElig;lfhere ealdorman in 956. When, in 957, Eadwig's brother Edgar (<i>d</i>. 975) took over the lands north of the Thames, &AElig;lfhere attests his charters as premier ealdorman, a position which he retained when Edgar became king of all England on his brother's death. He appears as ealdorman of Mercia in the leases issued by Oswald, bishop of Worcester, from 962 onwards, and Byrhtferth of Ramsey describes him as &#145;prince of the Mercian people&#146;  (Byrhtferth of Ramsey, 1.443). Edgar's fourth law code implies an equality of status among the three leading ealdormen, &AElig;lfhere, &AElig;thelwine of East Anglia (<i>d</i>. 992), and Oslac of Northumbria (<i>d</i>. 975), who outranked all other lay officials; and the other ealdormen in Mercia&#151;&AElig;thelmund (940&#150;65) in the north-west and &AElig;thelstan (nicknamed <i>rota</i>; 955&#150;70) in the south-east&#151;were probably subject to &AElig;lfhere's overall control. He may also have administered central Wessex after the death of his brother <a href="#cosubject_39114">&AElig;lfheah [<i>see below</i>]</a> in 971 until the appointment of &AElig;thelm&aelig;r in 977.<br>
<br>&AElig;lfhere's rise coincided with a reduction in the authority of &AElig;thelwine's family and the rivalry between them surfaced during the succession crisis after Edgar's death in 975. &AElig;lfhere supported Queen &AElig;lfthryth in asserting the claims of her son &AElig;thelred, as did &AElig;thelwold, bishop of Winchester, whereas &AElig;thelwine, with Archbishop Dunstan and Oswald of Worcester, upheld the rights of Edward the Martyr, Edgar's son with his first wife. The coronation of Edward averted a civil war, but did not end the disturbances. Edward's reign has been seen as a period of reaction against the growing power of the reformed monasteries, initiated by &AElig;lfhere and opposed by &AElig;thelwine, but this is both simplistic and misleading. &AElig;lfhere is said to have disbanded houses established by &AElig;thelwold  (<span class="italic">ASC</span>, s.a. 975, text E), yet is also presented as defending &AElig;thelwold's foundation at Ely against the oppression of &AElig;thelwine  (<span class="italic">Liber Eliensis</span>, 79&#150;80); and he was a benefactor of Abingdon  (<span class="italic">AS chart.</span>, S 1216), founded by &AElig;thelwold, and Glastonbury, reformed by &AElig;thelwold's teacher, Dunstan. The only named house destroyed at this time is Winchcombe, Gloucestershire, founded by Oswald, bishop of Worcester, though the monks of Evesham and of Pershore later claimed that &AElig;lfhere had seized lands belonging to them. &AElig;lfhere may well have resented the appointment of Oswald, a close friend of &AElig;thelwine, to the bishopric of Worcester: although the Worcestershire triple hundred of Oswaldslow, controlled by the bishop, can no longer be regarded as a liberty from which the ealdorman was excluded, Oswald was as much a royal officer as &AElig;lfhere himself and their spheres of authority overlapped. It is also clear that the wealth of the reformed monasteries was sometimes acquired by dubious means and many disputes involved attempts by the &#145;donors&#146; to obtain a better price for their lands than they originally received  (<span class="italic">AS chart.</span>, S 792).<br>
<br>King Edward was murdered at Corfe, Dorset, in 978. No contemporary source implicates &AElig;lfhere, who in 979 oversaw the translation of Edward's body from Wareham to Shaftesbury, where his cult was quickly established. Under &AElig;thelred II, &AElig;lfhere continued to hold the pre-eminence he had enjoyed under Edgar, until his death on 22 October 983. His wife may have been the Eadfl&aelig;d from whom his successor <a href="#cosubject_52810">&AElig;lfric Cild [<i>see below</i>]</a> abstracted land in Gloucestershire, but no children are recorded; &AElig;lfric, sometimes styled &AElig;lfhere's son, was actually his brother-in-law and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20542/', "Odda of Deerhurst")</script>, who has also in the past been described as &AElig;lfhere's son, was probably not related to him at all. &AElig;lfhere was buried at Glastonbury Abbey, where he was long remembered as a generous benefactor.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_52810"></a><span class="headword">&AElig;lfric Cild</span>  (<em>fl. </em>975&#150;985), <span class="occ">magnate</span>, was the brother-in-law (not son, as the twelfth-century chronicler at Abingdon calls him) of &AElig;lfhere. His wife may have been &AElig;thelfl&aelig;d, Ealhhelm's daughter, recorded <i>c</i>.950  (<span class="italic">AS chart.</span>, S 1539); his son &AElig;lfwine, killed at Maldon in 991, was remembered in the will of his uncle, &AElig;lfheah, who died in 971, and also, as Ealhhelm's grandson, in the Old English poem, <span class="italic">The Battle of Maldon</span>. &AElig;lfric Cild (literally &#145;child&#146;, but probably meaning &#145;nobleman&#146; in this context), came from the east midlands; he had lands in Huntingdonshire and is associated with Bishop &AElig;thelwold in the foundation both of Peterborough and of Thorney. After the death of Edgar in 975 he is found visiting Ely in company with Queen &AElig;lfthryth and her son, the future &AElig;thelred II. He succeeded as ealdorman of Mercia in 983 and held his position until early in 985, when he was banished by a council held at Cirencester; the charge was treason. No details are given, though he is accused of seizing land in Gloucestershire belonging to Eadfl&aelig;d, possibly &AElig;lfhere's widow  (<span class="italic">AS chart.</span>, S 896, 937). The date of his death is not recorded. Henry of Huntingdon seems to regard his banishment as unjust; and the twelfth-century Abingdon chronicle says he fled to Denmark, later returning to England with a band of viking raiders. Both sources, however, conflate &AElig;lfric Cild with his namesake, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/188/', "&#198;lfric of Hampshire")</script>, who died in 1016.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_39114"></a><span class="headword">&AElig;lfheah</span>  (<em>d.</em> 971), <span class="occ">magnate</span>, was probably the eldest of Ealhhelm's sons, since he was married by 940 to &AElig;lfswith. She was a kinswoman of King Eadwig  (<span class="italic">AS chart.</span>, S 662), who made &AElig;lfheah his seneschal and in 959 appointed him ealdorman of central Wessex. &AElig;lfsige, bishop of Winchester, addressed &AElig;lfheah as &#145;my beloved friend&#146;  (<span class="italic">AS chart.</span>, S 1491) and made him guardian of his son Godwine (<i>d</i>. 1001); Brihthelm, &AElig;lfsige's successor, was also a kinsman of &AElig;lfheah  (<span class="italic">AS chart.</span>, S 615). &AElig;lfheah was connected with <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/194/', "&#198;lfthryth")</script>, who married Edgar in 964 or 965 and he may have been godfather to one of her sons; in his will  (<span class="italic">AS chart.</span>, S 1485) he made bequests to both athelings and to their mother. &AElig;lfheah's will, when compared with the royal charters in his favour, allows some estimate to be made of his wealth: about 700 hides of land in seven shires. The will also mentions his brothers, but names only &AElig;lfhere; the others were Eadric  (<span class="italic">AS chart.</span>, S 1292), who probably predeceased him, and &AElig;lfwine, who became a monk of Glastonbury and was living in 975  (<span class="italic">AS chart.</span>, S 802, 1276). &AElig;lfheah also made a bequest to his sister's son &AElig;lfwine, son of &AElig;lfric Cild. He died on 18 April 971 and was buried at Glastonbury Abbey, of which he and his wife were benefactors; he also gave lands to Abingdon, Bath, the Old Minster, Winchester, and Malmesbury. He left two sons, &AElig;lfweard and Godric; the latter is perhaps the earldorman of Lindsey killed at the battle of &#145;Assandun&#146; in 1016.<br>
