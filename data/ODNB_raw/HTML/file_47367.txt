<span class="headword">Irving,  David Daniel <span class="st"> [Dan]</span></span>  (1854&#150;1924), <span class="occ">socialist organizer and politician</span>, was born in Birmingham on 31 October 1854, the son of Samuel Irving, a commercial traveller, and his wife, Susannah. He attended Dawson's national school, Birmingham, went to sea at the age of thirteen, and then in 1875 settled in Bristol. After a year as a warehouseman, he was employed by the Midland Railway, where he rose to the grade of foreman shunter. An accident cost him a leg, a down-grading of his employment, and a wage cut of 8<i>s</i>. a week. This trauma and the response of his employer perhaps affected his political and religious views which hitherto had been Liberal and Baptist. Eventually he joined the Bristol Socialist Society. His shift was contemporary with the growth of new unionism and Irving became Bristol secretary of a gasworkers' union (later incorporated into the National Union of General Labourers). He was also involved heavily in attempts to organize so-called unskilled and women workers.<br>
<br>Irving participated in the ethical mobilization sometimes characterized as the religion of socialism. He married Clara Brock, daughter of a Bristol house decorator, in 1879; they had two daughters. Late in 1891, the Irving house acquired a lodger, Katharine Conway, a Newnham-educated socialist. She characterized herself as Irving's &#145;spirit-wife&#146;. Irving and another Bristol socialist, Enid Stacy, were nominated by Katharine Conway as members of a home colony to be developed at Starnthwaite in Westmorland by a Unitarian minister, the Revd Herbert V. Mills. This venture, part of a broader attempt to develop a rural alternative to industrial society, proved during the winter of 1892&#150;3 to be a disaster. Eventually, Irving and Stacey led a revolt against Mills's appointment of a foreman without a democratic vote. The colonists were evicted. Lengthy legal arguments resulted in costs to all parties, a payment of &pound;75 to Irving, and the end of any relationship with Conway, who had supported Mills.<br>
<br>After a period as a socialist lecturer, in 1894 Irving was appointed full-time secretary of the Burnley branch of the Social Democratic Federation (SDF). Lancashire was a relative stronghold of the federation and Burnley was especially notable as the location of a sizeable branch. In the year of Irving's appointment, it boasted 1000 members. Thereafter the durability of the branch owed much to Irving's organizational skills. At the 1906 election, the SDF was 350 votes from victory. The candidate was the SDF leader, H. M. Hyndman, who contested Burnley on four occasions and was highly appreciative of Irving's organizational work.<br>
<br>The political significance of Irving's activities is contestable. It would be simplistic to present Irving as the organizer of a Marxist and politically distinctive SDF presence. The federation branch fulfilled much the same role as the Independent Labour Party (ILP) in other towns; it was not a sectarian anomaly. When the national SDF broke with the Labour Representation Committee (LRC) in 1901 on account of the latter's lack of socialist commitment, Burnley, under Irving's leadership, continued much as before. His strategy included working with local trade unions in a broad alliance.<br>
<br>Irving's attempt to expand socialist influence in one community can be seen as a variant on the theme of municipal socialism. He was a member of the school board from 1898 until its abolition in 1903; he spent two periods on the board of guardians. Most significantly he was elected to the town council in November 1902 and, with a one-year gap, worked assiduously in this forum until his defeat in 1922. Beyond his Burnley base, he was a significant figure in the SDF, sitting on its executive from 1897, propagandizing, and fighting elections. In the 1906 election he secured a creditable vote against the sitting Liberal at Accrington; in both 1910 campaigns he contested Rochdale, a town with some record of socialist strength. A more specially propagandist intervention came in the North West Manchester by-election of April 1908. All these candidacies were on a specifically Social Democrat platform independent of the LRC and its successor, the Labour Party. Irving's support from local trade unionists therefore varied, but in Lancashire where support for socialist unity was relatively strong there was often backing from ILP members.<br>
<br>Socialist impatience with the Labour Party produced the formation, in 1911, of the British Socialist Party (BSP) as a left alternative. Irving was a member of its executive. Early optimism proved unfounded and by 1914 the BSP was moving towards affiliation to the Labour Party. War divided the BSP. Irving was already an advocate of national defence and he quickly moved to endorse a pro-war position. The recriminations culminated at the BSP conference of April 1916, when the pro-war delegates, outvoted on a procedural issue, withdrew. Irving was a signatory to the consequential statement which identified the prospects for socialism with the defeat of Germany; he helped to form a new organization, the National Socialist Party (NSP), which later adopted the old title of SDF. Under NSP auspices Irving was adopted as Burnley's Labour candidate for the 1918 election. Local reputation and wartime patriotism combined to give him a narrow victory in a three-cornered fight, a victory that was repeated in the elections of 1922 and 1923. Irving in parliament seemed a venerable figure almost from another age. Despite the limitations of the Parliamentary Labour Party between 1918 and 1922 he never made much of a mark.<br>
<br>Irving died of a heart attack on 25 January 1924 at his London home, The Chase, Clapham Common; he was survived by his wife. His effects were valued at &pound;471. Contemporary assessments of Irving varied. Some saw him as a dogmatic follower of H. M. Hyndman; in Burnley where he was given the freedom of the borough shortly before his death, he was clearly revered by many. The electoral slogan &#145;Dan's the Man&#146; evoked familiarity; the thousands who paid their respects at his funeral showed the impact of a socialist on a community.<br>
