<span class="headword">Pine,  Robert Edge</span>  (1730&#150;1788), <span class="occ">painter</span>, was born in London, the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22293/', "John Pine (1690&#150;1756)")</script>, an engraver. John Pine's other children were Simon (<i>d</i>. 1772), a miniature painter, Horace (1731&#150;1770), Charlotte, and another daughter whose name is unknown and who married the painter Alexander Cozens. Nothing is known of Robert Edge Pine's early years, although it is presumed he would have received some instruction from his father. On 23 December 1749 he married Mary Fulford at the church of the Holy Sepulchre, Holborn, London. They had four known daughters, Elizabeth, Anne Charlotte, Rose, and a Miss J. He seems to have painted from the beginning the range of subject matter that he continued to use throughout his life: history paintings, theatrical subjects, and portraits. One of his earliest works was <span class="italic">Thomas Lowe and Mrs Chambers as Captain Macheath and Polly</span>, engraved in mezzotint by James McArdell in 1752. Pine was active in the Society of Arts and was on the committee of polite arts. In March 1759 he proposed to the society that it hire a room for exhibitions of the works of &#145;the present painters and sculptors&#146;  (Paulson, 2.308), one of the moves that led to the foundation of the Society of Artists in 1760.<br>
<br>In 1760 Pine won the first premium for historical painting at the Society of Arts with <span class="italic">The Surrender of Calais to Edward the Third</span> which was also exhibited at the first exhibition of the Society of Artists (1760, no. 42). He won the first premium again in 1763 with <span class="italic">Canute the Great Reproving his Courtiers for their Impious Flattery</span> (destroyed by fire in Boston, Massachusetts, in 1803), which was exhibited at the Free Society of Artists in the same year (no. 159), and again at the special exhibition of the Society of Artists in 1768 (no. 89). Both pictures were engraved by Fran&ccedil;ois Germain Aliamet.<br>
<br>Pine exhibited at the Society of Artists from 1760 to 1771, and at the Free Society of Artists from 1761 to 1763. Among his paintings exhibited in these years were <span class="italic">George II</span> (1759; Audley End, Essex), <span class="italic">The Earl of Northumberland Laying the Foundation Stone of Middlesex Hospital</span> (1761; Middlesex Hospital, London), and <span class="italic">Mrs Yates as Medea</span> (1770). In 1759 John Hamilton Mortimer became his pupil. Both artists through the 1760s were actively involved with the Society of Artists and sat on various of its committees. It is likely that Pine's radical political views were encouraged through the contacts he had made in the Society of Arts, for example with the republican Thomas Hollis, and in certain sections of the Society of Artists. Pine's republican sympathies led him to paint the portraits <span class="italic">John Wilkes</span> (1768; Palace of Westminster, London), <span class="italic">Richard Oliver</span> (1771; Guildhall Art Gallery, London), and <span class="italic">Brass Crosby</span> (1771; Daily Telegraph, London), the subjects of the last two being imprisoned in the Tower of London at the time for supporting the publication of parliamentary debates.<br>
<br>During the 1760s Pine was one of the leading portrait painters in London. On 5 October 1771, after a quarrel with the Society of Artists and probably its president, James Paine, over an unknown &#145;insult&#146; he erased his name from the society, and although the case dragged on his resignation was eventually accepted on 22 June 1772; he never exhibited there again. Pine exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1772, 1780, and 1784. In 1772 his brother Simon died and Pine moved to Bath, where he lived for eight years, for some of this time in close proximity to his nephew, the watercolour painter John Robert Cozens. Pine's address in Bath from at least 1775 to 1779 was at Cross Bath in the parish of St Peter and St Paul.<br>
<br>Pine continued to paint portraits, including one of David Garrick, exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1780 (possibly the version now in the Folger Shakespeare Library, Washington, DC). His republican views led him to support the cause of American independence and he came to know a number of supporters of America such as George William Fairfax, in Bath, a friend of George Washington, and Samuel Vaughan, a London friend of Benjamin Franklin. In 1778 he painted the allegorical picture <span class="italic">America</span>, now only known from an engraving by Joseph Strutt of 1781. He also held an exhibition of his work in the great room at Spring Gardens, London, in 1782, which included a series of Shakespearian scenes, an ambitious work which anticipated John Boydell's Shakspeare Gallery.<br>
<br>Following his political convictions, Pine decided to go to America and was settled in Philadelphia by August 1784. In the same year he wrote, &#145;I think I could pass the latter part of my life happier in a Country where the noblest Principles have been defended and establish'd than with the People who have endeavoured to subdue them&#146;  (Stewart, 20). By 27 October 1784 Pine had opened a gallery in the state house, Philadelphia, with paintings he had brought from England. <span class="italic">A Descriptive Catalogue of Pictures Painted by Robert Edge Pine</span>, produced by Francis Bailey, a local printer, in the same year, lists <span class="italic">America</span> and about ten Shakespearian pictures, including illustrations to <span class="italic">Lear</span>, <span class="italic">Hamlet</span>, <span class="italic">Macbeth</span>, <span class="italic">The Tempest</span>, and <span class="italic">As You Like It</span>, and also a picture of Boadicea. These paintings were destroyed by fire in Daniel Bowen's Columbian Museum in Boston, in 1803, after Pine's death.<br>
<br>Pine continued to paint portraits in America. With letters of introduction from the writer and composer Francis Hopkinson and the lawyer and writer Thomas McKean he stayed from 28 April to 16 May 1785 at Mount Vernon, where he painted George Washington. He sometimes travelled to the south for portraiture, painting faces on small canvases which were later incorporated into larger ones and completed in his studio. He also painted, with Edward Savage, <span class="italic">Congress Voting Independence</span> (Historical Society of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania), and three other untraced pictures of the American War of Independence.<br>
<br>According to John Hopkinson, Pine died of apoplexy on 12 November 1788 in Philadelphia. His will, which had been drawn up on 23 August 1782, was filed for probate in Philadelphia on 22 September 1789. His widow, Mary, was the sole beneficiary and executor. John Hopkinson said Pine was &#145;a very small man&#151;morbidly irritable&#146; and added that his wife and daughters were also very small, &#145;indeed a family of pigmies&#146;  (Dunlap, 1.377) and, according to Farington, Rose Pine was &#145;insane&#146; (Farington, <span class="italic">Diary</span>, 3.778, 25 Feb 1797). Pine's widow received some charity from the Royal Academy in the 1790s (ibid., 2.364, 10 July 1795; 3.1033, 20 July 1798).<br>
