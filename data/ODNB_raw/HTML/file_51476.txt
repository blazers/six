<span class="headword">Adams,  William</span>  (1820&#150;1900), <span class="occ">surgeon</span>, was born on 1 February 1820, the eldest son of James Adams, surgeon, of 39 Finsbury Square, London. He was educated at W. Simpson's private school in Hackney and then at King's College School, London, from 1835 to 1837. He trained at St Thomas's Hospital between 1838 and 1842 under Joseph Henry Green. Training as a surgeon when anaesthesia and antiseptic methods were undeveloped Adams gained an exceptionally thorough grasp of anatomy and a meticulous operating technique, described as &#145;careful but slow&#146;. He shared the contemporary view that post-operative infection was caused by excessive exposure of the wound to the air; consequently he favoured subcutaneous surgery with minimum excision of the skin, and was slow to adopt Lister's techniques of antisepsis.<br>
<br>Adams was admitted MRCS in 1842, the year that he was appointed curator of the museum and demonstrator of morbid anatomy at St Thomas's Hospital, posts that he held until 1854. The hospital had just purchased Grainger's Medical School and a member of the latter's staff who had been a leading body snatcher in the 1820s became Adams's &#145;chief dead-house assistant&#146; and provided him with numerous gruesome anecdotes. In 1850 Adams married Mary Anne Mills, daughter of John Mills, who predeceased him. There were two sons of the marriage.<br>
<br>Adams was admitted FRCS in 1851. During the same year he became assistant surgeon to the Royal Orthopaedic Hospital and in 1857 was promoted joint senior surgeon. His resignation in 1872 followed a confrontation with the hospital committee. This arose from criticisms of the two senior surgeons in the annual report on the hospital. When it was put to the vote that these criticisms be deleted since they were fallacious, the motion was defeated. It was later revealed that an assistant surgeon, B. E. Brodhurst, had rigged the vote by paying the membership fee of 1 guinea each for thirty-two new governors to vote against Adams and his colleague. Brodhurst subsequently accepted the post of senior surgeon, despite general condemnation of his conduct. The <span class="italic">British Medical Journal</span> commented: &#145;The services of the two senior surgeons, who have chiefly made the hospital distinguished through a long series of years, have been lost, and their long career of brilliant and gratuitous exertions rewarded with insult and crowned with ingratitude&#146;  (Plarr).<br>
<br>After his appointment as lecturer on surgery and medical practice at the Grosvenor Place medical school in 1854 Adams elected to specialize in orthopaedic surgery. However, it was while acting as surgeon to the Great Northern Hospital, London, from 1855 to 1891 that he established his reputation as the leading orthopaedic surgeon in England. There he devised the operation, subsequently known by his name, of osteotomy of the neck of the femur within the capsule of the hip-joint to relieve ankylosis of the joint, for which he invented a special knife that he called &#145;my little thaw&#146;. As surgeon to the National Hospital for the Paralysed and Epileptic, 1874 to 1891, he performed much general surgery.<br>
<br>Adams was elected vice-president of the Pathological Society of London, 1867; president of the Harveian Society, 1873; and president of the Medical Society of London, 1876, in which year he travelled to the USA as the society's representative at the International Medical Congress. He was the author of some fifteen medical books and papers, the best known being his Lettsomian lecture of 1869 on diseases of the joints and his Jacksonian prize essay on club foot, later praised as &#145;a classic, for it is an epitome of the knowledge of the time&#146;  (Plarr).<br>
<br>Adams devoted most of his time and energy to hospital work but established a private practice at 5 Henrietta Street, Cavendish Square, between 1853 and 1896. In 1896 he moved to 7 Loudoun Road, St John's Wood, where he died on 3 February 1900. Adams was regarded by his colleagues with a mixture of affection and irritation. &#145;He was a good but prolix talker, with a soft voice and a pronounced lisp&#146;  (Plarr). Sir James Paget complained that &#145;he never finished his sentences&#146;  (ibid.). The museum curator at St Bartholomew's Hospital recalled that &#145;he would often come in later days and waste two or three hours of valuable time, having nothing to do&#146;  (ibid.). But his reminiscences of the old body-snatching days were enthralling, and a contemporary described him as &#145;a most genial and humorous man, hospitable, exceedingly kind and a voluminous talker&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Lancet</span>, 812).<br>
