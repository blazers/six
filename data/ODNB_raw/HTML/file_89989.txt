<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Most,  Mickie</span> <span class="st"> [<em>real name </em>Michael Peter Hayes]</span>  (1938&#150;2003), <span class="occ">singer and record producer</span>, was born on 20 June 1938 at Louise Margaret Hospital, Aldershot, Hampshire, the son of Harold Victor Hayes, a sergeant (later regimental sergeant-major) in the Royal Artillery, and his wife, Doris Kathleen, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Bower. He was an under-achieving student and left school at the age of fifteen to become an apprentice in a metal works. After an accident at work left him with a foot injury (a toe was amputated) he became interested in entering the burgeoning pop industry of the mid-1950s. As a teenager in Harrow, Middlesex, he befriended Terry Dene (real name Terence Williams) at the onset of the British skiffle craze (1956&#150;8). Both found work as extras at Pinewood Studios in 1956. The following year, while Dene became one of the UK's early rock and roll stars, Hayes worked at the famed 2I's coffee bar in Soho.<br>
<br>In 1958 Hayes and his friend Alex Murray formed the Most Brothers, and he adopted the name Mickie Most, which he retained thereafter. They recorded unsuccessfully for Decca, and toured with the young Cliff Richard. Indeed the Most Brothers backing group included the future Shadows Hank Marvin and Bruce Welch on guitars, and the bassist Jet Harris. Mickie Most abandoned the light harmony rock and roll of the Most Brothers when he met Christina Frisco in 1958, marrying her a year later. Christina was South African by birth, and for the next three years Most performed in South Africa, forming the group Mickie Most and the Playboys. By exploiting the non-availability of American recorded music in South Africa he covered American rock and roll hits such as Chuck Berry's &#145;Johnny B. Goode&#146;. He was a great success there, achieving eleven consecutive number one hit singles, and becoming a household name&#151;at least in white society.<br>
<br>Most returned to England in 1962, attempting to break into the expanding R&amp;B and beat scenes. Despite his South African success he toured on the package tour circuit with little success (he was only an opening act on the UK tour of Little Richard, Bo Diddley, and the Everly Brothers in 1963), and his South African recording of &#145;Mister Porter&#146; only reached number 43 in the UK charts, in July 1963. He had, however, picked up a great deal of knowledge in South Africa about the art of rapid record production (records were cheaply and swiftly produced for the local South African market), and after accepting his shortcomings as a performer he turned to independent record production.<br>
<br>The Animals recorded Most's first acknowledged production, &#145;Baby Let Me Take You Home&#146;, in 1964. It was later variously reported that Most had spotted the Animals performing in either a Newcastle or a London nightclub, inviting them to a recording session on the strength of that one performance. Whatever the truth of the matter, &#145;Baby Let Me Take You Home&#146; and the follow-up, &#145;House of the Rising Sun&#146;, were brilliant studio re-workings of songs featured on Bob Dylan's first LP. &#145;Baby Let Me Take You Home&#146; was only a small British hit (reaching number 21), but its successor topped the charts internationally.<br>
<br>This was the start of an impressive run of success. Soon all Britain's major labels beat a path to Most's door. He had hits for Decca with the Nashville Teens (&#145;Tobacco Road&#146;); Brunswick with Brenda Lee (&#145;Is It True&#146;); Columbia with Herman's Hermits (including &#145;Silhouettes&#146;), the Animals (&#145;Don't Let Me be Misunderstood&#146;, and others), and Lulu (&#145;The Boat that I Row&#146;); and Pye with Donovan (including &#145;Sunshine Superman&#146;). The careers of Lulu and Donovan were both flagging when Most took over producing their records, and he furnished them with significant hits. By 1966 Most was a rare breed indeed, owning his own recording studios in London. However, Alan Price, the key figure in the Animals, did not like what he saw as Most's dictatorial approach in the studio and left the Animals; this in turn led to accusations that Most was a manipulator and a Svengali. There was some evidence for this: from 1966 onwards Most certainly played a major role in shaping the career of Donovan&#151;taking him from something of a Dylan clone to an international singer&#150;songwriter of great renown. Donovan later commented that &#145;He'd sift through my material until he'd say: &#147;right, I'll have that one and that one for singles&#148;. He knew right away&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>).<br>
<br>Most's productions were regularly performed by top London session musicians, including Big Jim Sullivan and Jimmy Page on guitars, John Paul Jones on bass and arrangements, and Nicky Hopkins on piano. Most also recorded the original Jeff Beck Group and put Beck into the top ten with &#145;Hi-Ho Silver Lining&#146; in 1967. He produced another two hit singles for Beck, &#145;Tallyman&#146; and &#145;Love is Blue&#146;, and the influential LPs, <span class="italic">Truth</span> and <span class="italic">Beck-Ola</span>. Furthermore, he teamed the Beck group with Donovan for the hit single &#145;Goo Goo Barabajagal&#146;, and signed new artists like the underrated singer&#150;guitarist Terry Reid. It was, however, no coincidence that by 1967 Most was being criticized for treating one of Britain's finest rock guitarists&#151;Jeff Beck&#151;as a &#145;pop star&#146;. Indeed, Most came to signify for the growing &#145;underground&#146; a line that should not be crossed in the search for popular music recognition, and Beck later disowned his hits produced by Most. Most's forthrightness and his opposition to over-production also led to his turning down lucrative production work for the Rolling Stones and the Who, groups who were known to spend inordinate hours in the studio, but were also leading players in the new album-oriented rock market.<br>
<br>By 1967, as rock music was turning to a heavier and more improvisational studio sound, Most's formulaic, singles-oriented approach appeared to be an anachronism. After the commercial and critical failure of the Yardbirds' <span class="italic">Little Games</span> album he decided to steer clear of rock groups, perhaps thinking that they did not quite share his vision. The Yardbirds had objected to practically everything Most had put before them as a producer. His policy of aiming to cut down every song to within three minutes and his (by now dated) idea that albums were only a postscript to success in the singles chart certainly angered this musically adventurous group. This somewhat myopic approach also led to splits with both Donovan and Terry Reid in 1969.<br>
<br>Despite these setbacks Most set up his own production office at 155 Oxford Street, London, which he shared with his business partner, Peter Grant. It was through Most's association with the Yardbirds that Grant was eventually persuaded to manage this by now disintegrating group. In 1968 Most and Grant jointly set up RAK Management, but Grant's involvement with the Yardbirds (who rapidly evolved into Led Zeppelin) meant that Most had full control by late 1969. RAK Records and RAK Music Publishing were also launched in 1969. Most also continued freelancing and in 1970 produced Mary Hopkin's Eurovision song contest entry, &#145;Knock Knock Who's There?&#146; (and its follow-up &#145;Temma Harbour&#146;), for the Beatles' Apple label.<br>
<br>With RAK Records Most's success began with the folk-singer Julie Felix's cover of Paul Simon's &#145;El Condor Pasa&#146;. Julie Felix was the first artist signed to the label in 1969. For a while Most appeared to be willing to embrace the underground, with signings such as Felix and Alexis Korner's CCS. However, his pop consciousness was never far from the surface and by 1971 RAK was regarded by the music press as a UK &#145;bubblegum&#146; label. As part of his successful strategy Most decided to work closely with people who were initially his rivals in this new teen pop market. The songwriters Nicky Chinn and Mike Chapman, the force behind Sweet, joined RAK Publishing to create number one hit singles and international successes for Suzi Quatro in 1973 with &#145;Can the Can&#146; and &#145;Devil Gate Drive&#146;. Most had approached Quatro while on a production assignment in Chicago in 1970, after seeing her on stage at a Detroit dance hall with the band Cradle (which included Quatro's sisters Arlene, Patti, and Nancy).<br>
<br>Most had by now tapped into the new generation of early and pre-teen record buyers, who were uninterested in self-indulgent albums by ageing 1960s rock bands. RAK records were noted for their well-produced sound and commercial appeal. Unlike early Motown, however, RAK did not have a &#145;sound&#146; as such (Mud did not sound like Hot Chocolate, and Suzi Quatro had a bass sound more reminiscent of T. Rex). But the appeal of RAK lay in its no-nonsense approach to production. RAK releases were never overburdened with noise and thus remained remarkably fresh. By 1973 Most achieved an all-time high ratio of hits with fourteen of eighteen RAK releases finding UK chart success. By the mid-1970s Suzi Quatro was at the forefront of a small roster of highly successful pop artists signed to RAK Records, including Hot Chocolate, Smokie, and Mud. In addition there were such other artists as Arrows, who enjoyed limited success at the time but, having also signed with RAK Publishing, were to receive long-term publishing benefits. Most was also lucky: the multiracial Hot Chocolate and Smokie were a cut above the average pop acts, and RAK boasted a long string of hit singles with these artists. Hot Chocolate, for example, enjoyed at least one British hit single every year from 1970 until 1984, twelve actually reaching the top ten.<br>
<br>Most was a studio man at heart but was also highly visible as a television personality on the popular 1970s ITV talent show <span class="italic">New Faces</span>. He and Tony Hatch were considered hard (at times acerbic) but fair in their assessment of aspiring artists, and Most's endearing good looks and affable personality made him appear a knowledgeable statesman of pop rather than a Svengali. He went on to produce the ITV rock show <span class="italic">Revolver</span> in the late 1970s, persuading the singer Kate Bush to appear as the first guest on the pilot episode. He used subsequent episodes of the programme to promote punk rock.<br>
<br>As a producer Most dabbled with punk a little (producing the Vibrators and Chris Spedding), but the legacy of punk and post-punk popular music unsettled RAK. Their artists were less successful as the 1980s dawned and Most did not adjust well to the dominant tastes of the 1980s. Despite the successes of the ever-popular Hot Chocolate and a string of hit records by Kim Wilde between 1981 and 1983 he became something of an anachronism in the new romantic and digital era of the mid-1980s. Most's motto, &#145;Find good songs, go in the studio, make good records and then go home&#146;  (Clarke), appeared at odds with the DIY aesthetic of late-1980s dance music. Perhaps as a consequence of this marked shift in song styles, production values, and recording techniques Most sold his RAK catalogue to EMI in 1983. Following this his production days were all but over. There were a handful of later productions; these included work with the pop group Johnny Hates Jazz in 1987 (&#145;Shattered Dreams&#146;, &#145;I Don't Want to be a Hero&#146;, and &#145;Turn Back the Clock&#146;), but only by virtue of his son Calvin being the group's drummer. In 1988 Most briefly revived RAK for the group Perfect Stranger, but no hit ensued. In later years he concentrated his business activities on the copyrights still held by RAK. These publishing rights were not part of the sale to EMI in 1983 and Most was able to administer these rights to his continued advantage until his final illness.<br>
<br>The <span class="italic">Sunday Times</span> &#145;rich list&#146; in 2003 estimated Most's wealth to be in the region of &pound;50 million, and many obituarists highlighted his financial success. Nevertheless Most's legacy deserved greater recognition. He was one of a small number of young independent producers of the 1960s who, having cut their teeth on the rock and roll of the 1950s, learned &#145;on the hoof&#146; and forever dislocated the hitherto vertically integrated British music industry. While labels such as Decca and EMI were monoliths unable to move at speed, mavericks like Most found their niche by responding rapidly to an ever changing popular culture and turning out, in the process, three-minute songs immediately recognizable by the youth of the nation. Additionally Most's studio accomplishments lasted far longer than many of his perhaps more illustrious &#145;rock&#146; contemporaries, and he certainly retained a knack for identifying what constituted a hit single, as Kim Wilde's 1981 hit &#145;Kids in America&#146; testified. Indeed, in a long career Most produced thirty-seven records which reached number one in the singles charts in either Britain or the USA. He was one of only a few post-war popular music studio professionals who were able to transform recorded sound: his place in the popular music canon is thus assured.<br>
<br>Most was diagnosed with mesothelioma, a form of lung cancer associated with exposure to asbestos, in 2000, and he died on 30 May 2003 at his north London home, Montebello, 19 Totteridge Common, Barnet. At the time of his death there was speculation that the cancer from which he suffered might have developed as a consequence of the many hours he spent in the unhealthy environment of the recording studio. He was cremated at Golders Green crematorium and was survived by his wife, Christina, and their three children, Calvin, Nathalie, and Crystalle.<br>
