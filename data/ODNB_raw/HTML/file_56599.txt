<span class="headword">James,  Charles Wilson Brega</span>  (1906&#150;1978), <span class="occ">fashion designer</span>, was born on 18 July 1906 at Agincourt House, Camberley, Surrey, the son of Ralph Ernest Haweis James and his wife, Louise Enders Brega (<i>b</i>. 1874). His father came from a Cornish landowning family, and was a professional soldier, engineer, and instructor at the Royal Military College, Sandhurst. His mother was descended from one of the wealthy founding families of Chicago. Charles James, as he was later to be known, was to retain his English nationality together with the right to reside permanently in America.<br>
<br>After a childhood spent mainly in London, James attended New Beacon School, Sevenoaks (1914&#150;18), and Hopkins School, Lake Placid, New York, USA (1919), before a brief spell at Harrow School in 1919. Although he achieved a certain artistic success, his career at Harrow was terminated after a year for what his father described as idleness, sloppy friends, and sexual escapades. James then spent a year in the architect's office of Samuel Insull, the utilities magnate of Chicago, for whom his father worked. Despite spending much of his time making batik scarves, he absorbed enough of the principles of technical design to provide a credible basis for his subsequent assumption of the role of architect or engineer of fashion.<br>
<br>James's career in fashion began in 1926. Working with a friend, Mme de Launay, he opened a millinery shop, Boucheron, in Chicago, moving briefly to New York in 1929, <i>en route</i> for London. He had expanded his range to include garments, made to order as well as retail. Mary Lewis, the fashion buyer for Best &amp; Co., New York, had become a steady patron and was subsequently guarantor of his US work permit. His first London atelier, at 1 Bruton Street, lasted only a year before liquidation, and in the pre-war years James divided his time between London, Paris, and New York.<br>
<br>James's skill with cutting and draping was well suited to the modes of the time and despite constant financial insecurity, eccentric business methods, and unreliable delivery times, both his retail and his wholesale clientele steadily increased. Two of his creations in particular were noteworthy: the Ribbon cape, created in 1937 at a time of financial crisis, and made from Colcombet of St &Eacute;tienne; old stock ribbons, and his padded jacket of 1938, referred to by Salvador Dal&iacute; as the first soft sculpture. Both items became fashion classics, unquestionably original as well as wearable.<br>
<br>In 1939 James left for New York where his first significant commercial association was with Elizabeth Arden, of the cosmetics and fashion firm. In 1944 the partnership was dissolved amid complaints of design piracy from James and of extravagance from Arden. Subsequent contracts with many of the main American wholesale clothing manufacturers tended to run a similar course, despite the undoubted style and popularity of James's work. A lawsuit with Samuel Winston in 1954, though won by James, proved particularly costly to him. James's range was wide, from couture to supermarket uniforms, children's clothes to jewellery and furniture. His dress forms to a revised module were a cherished project. Original models were sold through quality department stores in the US and UK.<br>
<br>Wealthy, socially notable private clients such as Mrs Millicent Huttleston Rogers and Mrs Randolph William Hearst doubled as patrons, ever willing to pay by retainer, and regarding the clothes as works of art, lending them for exhibition and donating them to museums. They shared Cristobal Balenciaga's opinion that James was &#145;America's greatest couturier, the world's best and only dressmaker who has raised it from an applied art to a pure art form&#146;  (Coleman, 9).<br>
<br>The three-dimensional aspect of clothing, the interactions of body mass, movement, and textile, were salient features of James's designs. A significant innovation was his development of master patterns, used in a number of garment contexts over many years. A perfectionist, he developed this aspect with obsessional consistency, and he later claimed that a sleeve had cost him $20,000 and three years' work. His method involved drawing, flat-patterning, and draping on the model and on occasion on himself. He was tireless in exposition, to students, in films, and in exhibitions; and at his insistence preparatory work was given to museums, together with the clothes to which it relates. The designs were recorded in a series of drawings by Antonio Lopez.<br>
<br>James's prices were high and, despite his own claim to be the most expensive dressmaker in the world  (Coleman, 84), James never attained the $500,000 turnover that in 1950 he had estimated as necessary for the maintenance of a design studio. There were injections of family money but even chameleon-like changes of corporate identity proved inadequate to protect him from requests for back-taxes, and by 1964 he had retired from the commercial fashion world.<br>
<br>Nevertheless, the New York years ensured James's recognition as a designer of great originality. In 1950 he received the Coty fashion award for &#145;Great mastery of colour and artistry in draping&#146;; in 1953 the Niemann Marcus award for &#145;Distinguished services to the industry&#146;; in 1962 a citation from Woolens and Worsteds of America Inc.; and in 1975 the first Guggenheim fine art fellowship awarded to a fashion designer.<br>
<br>James had various male partners but on 8 July 1954 he married Nancy Leigh Gregory; they had a son and a daughter. In 1961 they parted, the family remaining in Chicago and Charles James returning to New York, where his last years were spent sporadically supported by former clients in an apartment in the atmospheric Chelsea Hotel. Cared for by his friend and associate Homer Layne, James was tirelessly willing to work with students and discuss new projects. Despite long-term ill health, the legacy of drug use, diabetes, and kidney disease, he remained superficially unchanged, small, spare, always dark haired, restlessly energetic, endlessly talkative, unforgetful of slights or triumphs, until his death from pneumonia at the Chelsea Hotel, New York on 23 September 1978.<br>
<br>Although a projected autobiography was not completed, the Brooklyn Museum in 1982 organized a major retrospective of his work, and a pioneering study by E. A. Coleman, <span class="italic">The Genius of Charles James</span>, appeared in 1988.<br>
