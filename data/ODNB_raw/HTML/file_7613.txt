<span class="headword">Dickson,  Alexander</span>  (1836&#150;1887), <span class="occ">botanist</span>, was born on 21 February 1836 at 6 Fettes Row, Edinburgh, second son among the eight children of David Dickson (1793&#150;1866), advocate and landowner, and his wife, Jemima, daughter of the Revd David Pyper. His father's family had long held estates at Kilbucho in Lanarkshire and Hartree in Peeblesshire. He was educated privately and at the University of Edinburgh, whence he graduated MD in 1860 with a thesis on the development of the seed vessel of <i>Caropyllacae</i>. In 1862, having already written a number of papers for the <span class="italic">Transactions of the Edinburgh Botanical Society</span>, Dickson lectured in botany at the University of Aberdeen during the illness of professor George Dickie (1812&#150;1882). In 1866 he was appointed to the chair of botany at Dublin University and, for a brief period in 1868, he was concurrently professor of botany at Dublin's Royal College of Science. In the latter year he returned to Scotland as professor of botany at Glasgow, where he remained until 1879. He was then appointed professor of botany at Edinburgh, and regius keeper of the Royal Botanic Garden.<br>
<br>Dickson, whose early researches were into reproductive organs of the Coniferae (conifers), was regarded by contemporaries as an excellent field botanist. His later studies included work on phyllotaxis (arrangement of leaves on a stem), flower and embryo development, and the morphology and structure of pitchers in carnivorous plants. The results of his researches were published in a number of journals including the proceedings and transactions of the Royal and Botanical societies of Edinburgh and the <span class="italic">Journal of Botany, British and Foreign</span>; the Royal Society catalogue lists a total of some fifty papers. However, he was essentially a cautious botanist, and believed that if the latest botanical publications were left for a year or two, those worth reading would sort themselves. He was a fellow of the Linnean Society and of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, was twice president of the Botanical Society of Edinburgh, and was awarded an honorary MD from Dublin and an LLD from Glasgow.<br>
<br>In 1866 Dickson succeeded to the family estates, where he was considered a generous and improving landlord. It was said of him that he would &#145;spend everything on his tenants, on his gates, on his trees&#151;as little as possible on himself&#146;  (Hole, 201). Of a quiet and retiring nature, he was a skilled draughtsman and accomplished musician, and in later years collected many Gaelic airs. During the winters he was fond of curling on the ponds near Hartree House, his Peeblesshire home. It was while playing a game on 30 December 1887 at Thriepland Pond, Peeblesshire, that he &#145;dropped dead in the act of making a shot&#146;  (<span class="italic">Nature</span>). He was widely mourned by students and tenants; a contemporary wrote of him that &#145;He could never lose a friend, for he could never say an unkind word or omit to do a kind action&#146;  (<span class="italic">Nature</span>).<br>
