<span class="headword">Capper, Sir  John Edward</span>  (1861&#150;1955), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was born at Lucknow, India, on 7 December 1861, the second son of William Copeland Capper of the Bengal civil service and his wife, Sarah, the daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6260/', "William Taylor Copeland")</script>. His younger brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32285/', "Major-General Sir Thompson Capper")</script>, was killed at Loos in September 1915. John Capper was educated at Wellington College and commissioned lieutenant in the Royal Engineers on 2 July 1880; he was promoted captain on 1 November 1889 and major on 1 April 1899, after being employed primarily on military and public works in India and Burma. However, he did also see active service in the Tirah campaign on the north-west frontier in 1897. On 10 October 1895 he married Edith Mary (1868/9&#150;1942), the daughter of Joseph Beausire of Noctorum, Birkenhead: they had one son, killed in action in 1916, and one daughter.<br>
<br>From October to December 1899 Capper was deputy assistant director of railways in South Africa, and on 29 November 1900 he received a brevet lieutenant-colonelcy. Capper then remained in South Africa until February 1903, commanding locally raised units before becoming commandant of Johannesburg; he received the CB in 1902. Having received his substantive lieutenant-colonelcy on 7 October 1905 and a brevet colonelcy on 28 January 1906, Capper was posted to command the Balloon School at Aldershot on 27 May 1906; he remained commandant until October 1910. Capper piloted the army's first airship, <i>Nulli Secundus</i>, in a flight over London in 1907. Having been promoted substantive colonel on leaving Aldershot on 7 October 1910, and after a brief period of half pay, Capper became commandant of the School of Military Engineering at Chatham, a position he held from 7 April 1911 to 28 September 1914. He was then posted to France as deputy inspector-general on the lines of communication as a temporary brigadier-general. On 9 May 1915 he became chief engineer of the 3rd corps, and two months later he became chief engineer of the Third Army, having received promotion to major-general on 3 July 1915. However, on 3 October 1915 he received command of the 24th division. In May 1917 he moved to command the machine-gun corps training centre but on 28 July he took up the appointment of director-general of the tank corps and on 1 September director-general of the War Office tank directorate, having also been considered as a possible director-general of military aeronautics.<br>
<br>Capper was both intelligent and technologically aware. Consequently he was readily convinced of the tank's potential for large-scale operations. Indeed he was to present a more practical version of J. F. C. Fuller's &#145;Plan 1919&#146; to the general staff in July 1918, by which tanks would have played a major role had the war persisted into 1919. Unfortunately, however, Capper's poor communication skills and pomposity gave his subordinates at tank corps headquarters the entirely opposite impression that he was unreceptive to their ideas, to the extent that they nicknamed him the Stone Age. Capper was appointed KCB in 1917; he left the War Office in July 1918, before commanding the 64th division in Britain from November 1918 to April 1919, and number one area in France and Flanders from June to September 1919. He became lieutenant-governor and commander-in-chief on Guernsey on 1 July 1920, and retired on 1 July 1925, having been appointed KCVO in 1921. He was colonel commandant of the Royal Tank Corps from September 1923 and a governor of Wellington College from 1928 until 1946. Capper died on 24 May 1955 at the Esperance Nursing Home, Eastbourne.<br>
