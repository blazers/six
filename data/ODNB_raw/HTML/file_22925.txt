<span class="headword">Pyle,  Thomas</span>  (1674&#150;1756), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and religious controversialist</span>, was born at Stody, Norfolk, the son of John Pyle (<i>d</i>. 1709), rector of Stody. He was educated at Gresham's grammar school at Holt, Norfolk, under Mr Bainbrigg, and then at Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, where he was admitted sizar on 17 May 1692, aged seventeen, and elected scholar the following Michaelmas. He graduated BA in 1696 and MA in 1699. He was ordained deacon on 30 May 1697 and priest on 25 September 1698 by Dr Moore, bishop of Norwich; the bishop's chaplain, William Whiston, noted that Pyle was one of the two best scholars that he had ever examined. He was appointed vicar of Thorpe Market in 1698. Following his marriage to Mary Rolfe (1681/2&#150;1748), of King's Lynn, in 1701 he was appointed minister of St Nicholas's Chapel in King's Lynn. He served as lecturer and curate of St Margaret's from 1711, and also held the neighbouring rectories of Outwell (1709&#150;18), Bexwell (1708&#150;9), and Watlington (1710&#150;26).<br>
<br>Pyle was an eloquent preacher and a strong whig. The accession of the house of Hanover and the representation of King's Lynn in parliament by the prime minister, Robert Walpole, gave him hope of preferment in the church. He was not slow to take advantage of the Bangorian controversy, writing <span class="italic">A Vindication of the Bishop of Bangor, in Answer to the Exceptions of Mr Law</span> and <span class="italic">A Second Vindication</span> in 1718. He also published two tracts in reply to Henry Stebbing's tracts on the controversy. This flurry of pamphlets proved his talent as a disputant and gained him the friendship of Benjamin Hoadly. After Hoadly became bishop of Salisbury he collated Pyle to the living of Durnford, in that diocese. Pyle had begun to be noticed as a preacher in London, and his <span class="italic">Paraphrase of the Acts and Epistles, in the Manner of Dr Clarke</span> (1725) attracted favourable attention from the low-church party and from dissenters such as Samuel Chandler, and John Rastrick of King's Lynn. A further volume of paraphrases helped to strengthen his position with notable latitudinarians such as Samuel Clarke, Arthur Ashley Sykes, and Thomas Herring. But Pyle never received additional preferment, even after Herring became archbishop of Canterbury. Herring explained some of his reservations about Pyle in a letter to William Duncombe of 29 July 1745: &#145;That very impetuosity of spirit, which under proper government, renders him the agreeable creature he is, has, in some circumstance of life got the better of him, and hurt his views&#146;  (Herring, 81). Pyle made no secret of his views on the Trinity, in which he adopted an Arian position, and revelled in &#145;the glorious prerogative of private judgement, the birth-right of Protestants&#146;  (Richards, 1017). His heterodoxy probably cost him advancement in the church. In 1732 he exchanged his old livings for the vicarage of St Margaret's, King's Lynn, which he retained until 1755.<br>
<br>Despairing of promotion for himself Pyle used his influence with Hoadly and others on behalf of his three sons. The eldest, Edmund (1702&#150;1776), succeeded his father as lecturer at St Nicholas's, King's Lynn, in 1732, became archdeacon of York in 1751, and acted as chaplain to the king and to Hoadly; he left some piquant memoirs of Matthew Hutton, archbishop of York and then of Canterbury. Pyle's second son, Thomas (1713&#150;1807), became canon of Salisbury in 1741 and of Winchester in 1760. Philip, the third son (1724&#150;1799), was appointed rector of North Lynn in 1756. Mary Pyle died on 14 March 1748, aged sixty-six.<br>
<br>Thomas Pyle retired to Swaffham in 1755, where he died on 31 December 1756. He was buried in All Saints', King's Lynn. Three collections of his religious discourses were published by Philip Pyle, in 1773, 1777, and 1783.<br>
