<span class="headword">Hickey,  William</span>  (1749&#150;1827), <span class="occ">lawyer in India and memoirist</span>, was born in St Alban's Street, Pall Mall, Westminster, on 30 June 1749, the eighth child of Joseph Hickey (<i>c</i>.1712&#150;1794), an Irishman, a successful London attorney, and his wife, Sarah Boulton (1720&#150;1768), whose family were landed property owners in Yorkshire. Joseph was evidently an indulgent parent, whose efforts to advance William's career were largely wasted on what was, by his own account, an exceptionally wayward adolescent. William went to Westminster School from 1757 until he left in 1763, as he himself put it, &#145;most deservedly in high disgrace&#146;. By then his disinclination for systematic work or study, his capacity to spend money, and what he called his &#145;propensity to women&#146; were all well developed  (<span class="italic">Memoirs</span>, ed. Quennell, 24). A succession of scandals finally persuaded his father that William must seek his fortune overseas. In 1769 he obtained a cadetship in the East India Company's army at Madras and made the journey to India, but, seeing no prospect of advancement there, returned to London via China. An attempt in 1775 to set him up in Jamaica was no more enduring. In 1777, however, he was packed off to India again, this time to Calcutta, where, with the exception of an interval of two years in London managing a parliamentary petition, he was to remain until he retired in 1808.<br>
<br>For some thirty years Hickey practised as an attorney at the supreme court established in 1774 in the capital of the new British empire in India to administer English law to the inhabitants of Calcutta and to British subjects in Bengal generally. In addition Hickey served for some years as deputy to the sheriff of Calcutta and became clerk to Sir Henry Russell, ultimately chief justice of the supreme court. Although in his style of living he remained for many years something of a rake, his career in Calcutta appears to have been a success. He built up a large practice, relying especially on &#145;native&#146; clients, and earned enough money to enable him to live in a very opulent way, even if he did not save any considerable fortune. He prided himself on being a very well-esteemed member of the British community. He was known as the Gentleman Attorney and the company he kept &#145;always was the best&#146;  (<span class="italic">Memoirs</span>, ed. Quennell, 234). Fearing for his health, he reluctantly left India in 1808. Little is known of his retirement in Britain. He settled at first in Beaconsfield, moving to London in 1817.<br>
<br>Any assessment of Hickey's career and of his personality depends almost entirely on a single source provided by Hickey himself: his 742 pages of memoirs written shortly after his return to Britain. Little is otherwise known about him. No collection of his own papers survives, nor is there much about him in the letters of others. At least two portraits of him can, however, be definitely identified; one was painted in India by Thomas Hickey (no relation to William) and another by William Thomas was exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1820.<br>
<br>The memoirs are extremely detailed, yet Hickey states that he wrote them almost entirely from memory, having only a few documents available to him and those mostly from his later years. By strict standards, therefore, the memoirs must contain much that can be regarded only as fiction. For instance, Hickey includes many conversational passages that purport to be verbatim records, but must be reconstructions of what he thought was appropriate to have been said on the occasion. Nevertheless, the memoirs undeniably deal with real people, places, and events. Subject to many small mistakes, the memoirs stand up well to cross-checking with other records. They therefore constitute a significant historical source, above all in bringing to life the British community in Calcutta.<br>
<br>For Hickey, however, the memoirs were evidently much more than a mere record of past events. In them he tried to recreate the characters of people who had meant much to him. In some cases he was brilliantly successful, as with the &#145;irresistibly attracting and engaging&#146;  (<span class="italic">Memoirs</span>, ed. Quennell, 126) (but also outrageously insensitive) Robert Pott, his friend for thirty years. The main character of the memoirs is of course ultimately their author, and, although he ostensibly denied this, they constitute his apologia. In them he presents himself as a &#145;pickle&#146;, that is as a self-confessed reprobate, who made good. Even at his worst he implies that he never transcended the ultimate standards of gentlemanly conduct and human decency&#151;or at least never did so without sincere repentance.<br>
<br>Hickey never married. Being, as he freely admitted, of an &#145;amorous disposition&#146;, among innumerable liaisons he formed a number of enduring relationships with women. One of these, Charlotte Barry (1762&#150;1783), took the name of Mrs Hickey. After Charlotte's death the great love of Hickey's life was Jemdanee, one of his Indian mistresses, with whom he had a son, who died in infancy. His death date is unknown, but his burial was recorded on 10 February 1827 at St John the Evangelist, Smith Square, Westminster. Prior to his death he had been living nearby in Holywell Street.<br>
