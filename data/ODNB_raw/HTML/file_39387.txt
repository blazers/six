<span class="headword">Summers,  (Augustus) Montague</span> <span class="st"> [<em>name in religion </em>Alphonsus Joseph-Mary]</span>  (1880&#150;1948), <span class="occ">literary scholar, occultist, and eccentric</span>, was born in Pembroke Lodge, Clifton, near Bristol, on 10 April 1880, the youngest of the seven children of Augustus William Summers, a wealthy banker, and his wife, Ellen Bush. He grew up in Tellisford House, Clifton Down, in the evangelical Anglican faith of his parents, and was educated in the extensive library of his home, at the Misses Lucas's academy, and, after his fourteenth year, as a day-boy at Clifton College. He entered Trinity College, Oxford, in 1899, and after a university career in which he attracted attention by his dandyism, wit, and unusual learning, went down in 1903 with a fourth-class degree in theology. He graduated BA in 1905 and MA in 1906. He attended Lichfield Theological College as a candidate for holy orders, and in 1908 he was ordained as deacon and appointed first to a curacy in Bath and then at Bitton in Bristol. Rumours of studies in Satanism and a charge of pederasty, of which he was acquitted, terminated this phase of his career.<br>
<br>On 19 July 1909 Summers was received into the Church of Rome and was granted the clerical tonsure on 28 December 1910; after this his clerical career became murky and remains so. He may have received minor orders as a deacon, but no record of his ordination has ever been found. During his lifetime, he was addressed as the Revd Montague Summers, celebrated mass in his own chapel and those of friends, adopted two names in religion, and invariably wore the dress pertaining to Roman priesthood; his appearance in soutane, buckled shoes, and shovel hat, later with an umbrella of the Sairey Gamp order, was familiar in London and Oxford. He became increasingly eccentric and was described as combining a manifest benignity with a whiff of the Widow Twankey. Some spoke of an aura of evil. It was charitably assumed by his friends that he was indeed a priest, and his devotion was never in question; his biographer Joseph Jerome (Father Broccard Sewell) records that all his life Summers wore the Carmelite scapular.<br>
<br>After religion Summers's great pursuit was the theatre, and it is as a scholar of the Restoration drama that he is remembered. As a child he and his siblings played seriously with a toy theatre. Until the death of his father (who left him a comfortable independence) he supported himself as a schoolmaster and during that time came under the influence of Arthur Henry Bullen of the Shakespeare Head Press. It was Bullen who encouraged Summers to produce his excellent edition of Villiers's <span class="italic">The Rehearsal</span> (1914) and <span class="italic">The Works of Aphra Behn</span> (6 vols., 1915). There followed <span class="italic">Restoration Comedies</span> (1921) and <span class="italic">Shakespeare Adaptations</span> (1921), opening up a neglected area of scholarship to which Summers made extensive additions with <span class="italic">The Complete Works of William Congreve</span> (4 vols., 1923), <span class="italic">The Complete Works of William Wycherley</span> (4 vols., 1924), <span class="italic">The Complete Works of Thomas Otway</span> (3 vols., 1927), <span class="italic">The Complete Works of Thomas Shadwell</span> (3 vols., 1927), an edition of John Downes's <span class="italic">Roscius Anglicanus</span> (1928), and <span class="italic">Dryden, Dramatic Works</span> (6 vols., 1932).<br>
<br>These handsome books made available for the first time the substance of a period of English drama formerly neglected and dismissed by such critics as Macaulay as unmeritable and indecent. Summers's &#145;Introductions&#146; may well be the finest things he ever wrote, being in Edmund Gosse's words, &#145;astonishingly full of marrowy information&#146;. Although sometimes careless in detail, and although the wrongs suffered by his church obtrude needlessly here and there, the scope and depth of his knowledge is awesome.<br>
<br>Summers was a moving spirit in the founding of the Phoenix Theatre (1919&#150;25), which presented much admired productions of Restoration plays hitherto unknown to playgoers, with casts of players of the first rank. Summers provided copious and excellent programme notes, and at rehearsal was a mine of information about the manner of performance. The Phoenix was succeeded by the Renaissance Theatre, which gave performances sporadically until 1928, Summers providing the same scholarly understructure. He was very popular with the theatre folk, and was devoted to them and their art.<br>
<br>In addition to his writing on the drama Summers published several volumes about demonology, witchcraft, vampires, and werewolves. They are enlightening reading even when the credulity of the reader does not match that of the writer. He also wrote a history of the Gothic novel in two volumes, <span class="italic">The Gothic Quest</span> (1938) and <span class="italic">A Gothic Bibliography</span> (1940).<br>
<br>Summers died suddenly at his home, 4 Dynevor Road, Richmond, on 10 August 1948, and was buried three days later in Richmond cemetery, garbed in his priest's vestments and with the coat of his dog, Tango. All his life Summers was a notable eccentric, and legends about him, benign and malign, are numerous.<br>
