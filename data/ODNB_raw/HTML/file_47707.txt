<span class="headword">Roger, Sir  Alexander Forbes Proctor</span>  (1878&#150;1961), <span class="occ">businessman and public servant</span>, was born on 30 January 1878, at Rhynie, Aberdeenshire, the posthumous third son of James Paterson Roger (who to his family's eternal shame had committed suicide) and his second wife, Margaret, daughter of James Munro of Dingwall. There was a half-sister from his father's earlier marriage. He was educated at Robert Gordon's College, Aberdeen, and at the age of eighteen he went to work at the City of London office of the Law, Guarantee, Trust, and Accident Society. In 1908 he married Helen Stuart (1884&#150;1976), youngest daughter of James Campbell Clark. They had three sons, including the couturier <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/65766/', "Neil Munro Roger")</script>. At about the time of his marriage Roger became a junior partner of John Philipps, afterwards Viscount St Davids, who controlled several investment trusts interested in electrical supply, engineering, and transport.<br>
<br>From early in the First World War until July 1915 Roger directed the British Red Cross Society's motor ambulances on the western front. He was then recruited to the Ministry of Munitions as director-general of trench warfare supplies, charged with reorganizing the production of mortars, grenades, and similar weapons. He was knighted in 1916. When the Ministry of Reconstruction was formed in 1917 Roger was appointed to its council with responsibility for financial policy.<br>
<br>After the armistice Roger resumed his business career, though he had temporary charge of the London docks during the general strike of 1926. He became a director in 1918 of British Insulated Cables (BIC) and chairman in 1930. During the 1920s Roger had particular responsibility for BIC's telephonic interests, and was involved in the Constantinople, Portuguese, and other telephone concessions. He travelled widely, became an adept at business diplomacy, and was a director of the Associated Telephone and Telegraph Company, the front for an Anglo-American global marketing arrangement. Following the amalgamation of BIC with Callenders in 1945, he was chairman of British Insulated Callender's Cables until 1954, thereafter serving as president.<br>
<br>Roger withdrew from the St Davids group in 1920, owing to difficult relations with Lord St Davids, and joined the boards of several financial institutions, most notably the Midland Bank, which he served from 1932 until 1958 (latterly as deputy chairman). It was through this connection that he became chairman of the troubled Birmingham Small Arms Company (BSA; 1932&#150;40). At BSA he was involved in various aspects of rearmament, and visited Moscow and Prague on the company's behalf in 1938; but he found his fellow directors uncongenial, and was relieved to leave BSA to become chairman of the Tank Board in May 1940. In the same year he headed a Ministry of Supply mission to South Africa, Asia, and Australasia. Roger led the British delegation at the Delhi conference in 1940 and was created KCIE in 1941.<br>
<br>Roger was shy when young, but his confidence grew with success. He was an affectionate and even confiding father, and his concern for children generally led to his chairing the appeals council of the Great Ormond Street Hospital for more than a decade (1934&#150;47). In his prime he was slim, alert, and vigorous-looking; a good dancer, he played tennis, squash, and golf into his sixties, and was a keen stalker in the highlands. In business he had few equals at dissecting balance sheets and analysing accounts. He was hard to fool, and a good delegator, though his liking for fellow Scots (especially Aberdonians) sometimes led him astray. Despite his fidelity to Scotland, his tastes were metropolitan, and as an older man he relished the hours spent talking to cronies at the Carlton Club. In overseas business he saw much chicanery, but was neither cynical nor corrupt. He thrived on challenges and enjoyed his business prestige, but he disdained power and money for their own sakes, and, despite opportunities to do so, chose not to accumulate millions: his estate was valued for probate at &pound;221,644 gross.<br>
<br>He died of heart failure on 4 April 1961 at his residence, Binfield Lodge, Binfield, Berkshire, and was cremated at Woking.<br>
