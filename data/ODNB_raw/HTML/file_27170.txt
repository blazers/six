<span class="headword">Theodore of Tarsus</span> <span class="st"> [St Theodore of Tarsus]</span>  (602&#150;690), <span class="occ">archbishop of Canterbury and biblical scholar</span>, was a figure of exceptional importance for the establishment and growth of the church in early England; as Bede said of his archbishopric, &#145;Never had there been such happy times since the English first came to Britain&#146;  (Bede, <span class="italic">Hist. eccl.</span>, 4.2). Bede is the principal source for Theodore's later career, from the time he was first approached about the archbishopric of Canterbury in 667; many details of his earlier career can be gleaned from the corpus of biblical commentaries which record his teaching at the school of Canterbury.<h2>
<a name="EducationintheNearEastandatConstantinople"></a>Education in the Near East and at Constantinople</h2>Theodore was born in Tarsus (now G&ouml;zl&uuml; Kule in south-eastern Turkey) in 602, in the Greek-speaking province of Cilicia. Nothing is known of his earliest education, nor of Tarsus itself, which lies buried far beneath the present-day Turkish city. Antioch on the Orontes (then in Syria, now Antakya in south-eastern Turkey) was the largest city in the vicinity of Tarsus: a flourishing Christian city, which from the fourth century onwards housed a distinctive school of Christian exegetes, including Diodorus of Tarsus, and his two influential pupils, Theodore of Mopsuestia (<i>d</i>. 428) and John Chrysostom (<i>d</i>. 407). The biblical exegesis of this Antiochene school was characteristically literal (as opposed, that is, to the allegorical approach of Alexandrine exegetes such as Origen): its approach was historical and philological and had resort to such disciplines as grammar, rhetoric, philosophy, and medicine in its attempt to elucidate the sacred text. The fact that the biblical exegesis of the Canterbury commentaries is wholly Antiochene in character, especially in its resort to the disciplines of rhetoric, philosophy, and medicine, and that John Chrysostom is the patristic authority most frequently quoted in the Canterbury commentaries, suggests that Theodore received his early training at Antioch. Furthermore, Antioch was at that time a city bilingual in Greek and Syriac, so it may be presumed that Theodore first came into contact with Syriac Christianity in Antioch. At several points in the biblical commentaries, Syriac words are quoted; particularly interesting is the fact that the commentaries, in explaining the &#145;cucumbers and melons&#146; of <span class="roman">Numbers</span> 11: 5, contain the observation that &#145;cucumbers are called <i>pepones</i> when they grow large &hellip; in the city of Edessa they grow so large that a camel can scarcely carry two of them&#146;  (Bischoff and Lapidge, 1.413). This observation implies that Theodore had travelled at some stage to Edessa, which lies about 150 miles north-east of Antioch (it is now Sanliurfa in south-eastern Turkey). Edessa was the principal centre of Syriac-speaking Christianity from the second century onwards; the great exegete Ephrem (<i>d</i>. 373) taught in Edessa, and Theodore's younger contemporary, Jacob of Edessa (<i>d</i>. 708), won renown as a biblical scholar and exegete. It is not certain how much experience the young Theodore had acquired of Syriac Christianity: Ephrem is once quoted by name in the Canterbury commentaries (although the text in question was also available in Greek translation); and the commentaries contain various explanations which have striking parallels with Syriac texts such a the &#145;Book of the cave of treasures&#146; (which is not known to have been translated into Greek). These parallels can best be explained on the assumption that Theodore had some (perhaps rudimentary, probably only spoken) knowledge of Syriac, and that he had spent time in Edessa in contact with Syriac exegetes. In any case, Syria was twice invaded during the early seventh century: in 613 by Persian armies (who were subsequently defeated by the armies of the Byzantine emperor Heraclius), and in 637 by the Arabs. Theodore's presence is next attested in Constantinople, and it is possible that he went there as a refugee from one of these invasions. The Canterbury commentaries contain various remarks on the habits of the Persians, which implies that Theodore had the opportunity of observing them close at hand.<br>
<br>Theodore's presence in Constantinople is confirmed by a statement in the Canterbury biblical commentaries to the effect that &#145;Theodore reports that in Constantinople he saw the Twelve Baskets woven from palm-branches and preserved as relics&#146;  (Bischoff and Lapidge, 42). From other sources it is known that these relics were housed in a shrine at the foot of the famous Porphyry Column which stood at the centre of the Forum of Constantine (the column is still standing in present-day Istanbul, where it is known as the Cemberlitas, though the shrine has disappeared). Constantinople in the time of the emperor Heraclius (<i>r</i>. 610&#150;41) was an imperial city of culture and learning, which attracted scholars from all parts of the empire; in particular, it housed a university and several famous libraries. Heraclius had invited to Constantinople the great polymath Stephen of Alexandria, who gave lectures on philosophy and medicine and was known to be teaching there in 619 or 620; but in Heraclius's time Constantinople was also home to the historian Theophylact Simocatta, the poet George of Pisidia, and the anonymous author of the <span class="italic">Chronicon Paschale</span>. The intellectual complexion of the Canterbury commentaries suggests that Theodore's scholarly orientation was derived from his period of study in Constantinople, particularly his interest in philosophy, rhetoric, medicine, computus, astronomy, and astrology. Stephen of Alexandria was expert in all these fields, and it is striking that several medical explanations in the Canterbury commentaries have precise parallels in Stephen's <i>scholia</i> or lecture notes, which may suggest that the young Theodore attended the lectures of the great polymath.<h2>
<a name="AGreekmonkatRome"></a>A Greek monk at Rome</h2>Theodore's presence is next attested in Rome, where he was living as a Greek monk at the time he came to the notice of the pope who appointed him to the vacant archbishopric of Canterbury. The circumstances which took Theodore from Constantinople to Rome are unknown. There were at that time a number of communities of oriental monks living in Rome, many of them refugees from the Arab invasions of Syria and north Africa. One of these communities housed Greek-speaking monks from Cilicia; it was located <i>ad aquas Salvias</i> (now the Tre Fontane, outside the southern gate of Porto San Paolo) and dedicated to St Anastasius, a soldier who had been martyred by the Persians in 628. It is highly likely that Theodore belonged to this monastery: he was Cilician in origin and the earliest attestations of the cult of St Anastasius in England can be linked with him. During the 640s the community of Cilician monks was actively engaged, on the pope's behalf, in the monothelete controversy. In an effort to end several centuries of theological wrangling, the emperor Heraclius and the patriarch of Constantinople issued in 633 a formulation to the effect that there was only &#145;one will&#146; in Christ, and this formulation was made a matter of imperial policy in 638. Although Pope Honorius I (<i>r</i>. 625&#150;38) expressed initial support, subsequent popes were adamant in their opposition to the imperial policy. Their opposition was articulated at Rome by the Greek theologian Maximus the Confessor and was promulgated by the Lateran Council of 649 under the presidency of Pope Martin (<i>r</i>. 649&#150;53). The <i>acta</i> of the Lateran Council were drawn up by various communities of Greek monks resident in Rome, including the Cilician monks of St Anastasius. It is likely that Theodore participated in the drafting of these <i>acta</i> (indeed the list of witnesses to them includes the name of one <i>Theodous monachus</i>, who is arguably identical with the later archbishop of Canterbury). In any event, the consequences of the Lateran Council were dire. Because the promulgation of its <i>acta</i> was in opposition to imperial policy, Pope Martin was arrested, taken to Constantinople, and tried and condemned for treason, as was Maximus the Confessor, the principal architect of the Lateran <i>acta</i>, who was condemned, mutilated, and exiled to the Black Sea, where he died in 662. The theological differences between pope and emperor were not settled until the Sixth Ecumenical Council of 680.<h2>
<a name="AppointmentasarchbishopofCanterbury"></a>Appointment as archbishop of Canterbury</h2>In 664 the archbishopric of Canterbury fell vacant through the death of Deusdedit; his successor, one Wigheard, went to Rome to collect the pallium, but died there of the plague in 667. At this point, Pope Vitalian (<i>r</i>. 657&#150;72) sought the advice of one of his trusted counsellors, Hadrian, then abbot of a small monastery near Naples, concerning the vacancy. After declining the post himself, Hadrian suggested the name of Theodore, who (as Bede recounts) was then living as a monk in Rome. Vitalian was hesitant about appointing Theodore (his hesitancy becomes comprehensible in light of Theodore's involvement with the Lateran Council of 649 for the death of Maximus had taken place only a few years before Wigheard's arrival in Rome). However, this hesitancy was overcome on the condition that Theodore should be tonsured after the manner of western monks (Greek monks shaved their heads completely) and that Hadrian should accompany him to England. When Theodore's hair had grown and been tonsured in the shape of a crown, he was consecrated by Vitalian on 26 March 668, and set out for England on 27 May of the same year. He arrived in England on 27 May the following year (669) to begin his archbishopric. He was then aged sixty-seven.<h2>
<a name="Ecclesiasticaladministrationtheologycanonlawandliturgy"></a>Ecclesiastical administration, theology, canon law, and liturgy</h2>Theodore set about his administrative responsibilities with the urgency of an old man in a hurry. As soon as Hadrian arrived in England in 670, the two of them undertook a comprehensive tour of the archdiocese. The archbishopric itself had been vacant for five years before Theodore's arrival and a number of other bishoprics were similarly vacant (there were only three English bishops in office when he arrived). He moved swiftly to fill the vacancies, making appointments to Rochester, Dunwich, and Winchester. Because the bishop of York, Ceadda, had been appointed uncanonically, he was deposed by Theodore, and Wilfrid appointed in his stead; Theodore subsequently appointed Ceadda to the see of Lichfield. With the English episcopate thus restored to strength, Theodore summoned a national synod, which met under his presidency at Hertford in September 672 or 673. This synod (the <i>acta</i> of which are fully reported by Bede, <span class="italic">Hist. eccl.</span>, 4.5) made certain provisions which had a long-lasting effect on the structure of the English church: for example, that national synods should be convoked twice-yearly at a place called &#145;Clofesho&#146;, and that the number of dioceses should expand as the number of the faithful increased. The intention behind this last stipulation was that very large (and wealthy) dioceses, such as that of Bishop Wilfrid in Northumbria, should be broken up into smaller, more manageable units. This intention inevitably brought Theodore into conflict with Wilfrid; but on this particular issue, Theodore's will prevailed. On the pretext of a quarrel with King Ecgfrith of Northumbria, Theodore in 677 deposed Wilfrid; the vast Northumbrian see was broken up into three dioceses: Deira (with its see at York), Bernicia (with its see at either Lindisfarne or Hexham), and Lindsey. Wilfrid went to Rome to appeal to the pope; his grievance was heard by a synod of Italian bishops in October 679. After the death of King Ecgfrith in 685, Theodore effected a reconciliation with Wilfrid by appointing him to the Deiran see. The reconciliation was announced in a letter sent from Theodore to various authorities in England; in his life of Bishop Wilfrid, Stephen of Ripon preserves the text of Theodore's letter to &AElig;thelred, king of the Mercians (<i>r</i>. 675&#150;704). This letter is one of the few surviving texts composed by Theodore himself.<br>
<br>One of Theodore's principal administrative concerns was with orthodox belief. This concern is seen in his response to the initiative taken by Pope Agatho (<i>r</i>. 678&#150;81) to effect a reconciliation between the papacy and the Byzantine emperor on the monothelete controversy. Pope Agatho decided to canvass the opinion of the western churches; to this end he sent to England a legate named John, precentor of St Peter's in Rome. Theodore in turn summoned an English synod which met at Hatfield on 17 September 679 (the Hatfield in question is arguably that in Yorkshire). The synod was asked to endorse the <i>acta</i> or stipulations of the Lateran Council of 649; as Bede  (Bede, <span class="italic">Hist. eccl.</span>, 4.17 [15]) reports the <i>acta</i> of the Synod of Hatfield, their wording was closely based on the wording of the earlier council, particularly in respect of their credal statement. It is an intriguing irony that Theodore (and his English church) was being asked by the papal legate to endorse the <i>acta</i> of an earlier council in which he himself had participated. His participation is adverted to by Pope Agatho in a letter to the Byzantine emperor (Constantine IV), dated 27 March 680, in which Agatho explains that it had been his intention to invite Theodore &#145;the philosopher and archbishop of Great Britain&#146; to join the papal party at the ecumenical council which was to convene in Constantinople in the attempt to resolve the controversy  (Lapidge, <span class="italic">Theodore</span>, 23). The pope evidently knew that Theodore was one of the few living theologians who had participated in drafting the <i>acta</i> of the Lateran Council of 649 and that he would have had an unrivalled knowledge of the doctrinal complexities; but by then Theodore was seventy-eight years old and too tired to make the journey to Rome and on to Constantinople. After so much hatred and bloodshed, the Sixth Ecumenical Council, which met at the emperor's palace in Constantinople in 680, formally condemned the imperial policy of monotheletism.<br>
<br>Theodore was also deeply concerned with matters of canon law and ecclesiastical legislation. Bede reports that many of the <i>acta</i> promulgated by Theodore's first synod at Hertford were drawn by him from a <span class="italic">liber canonum</span>; and various evidence indicates that this book was a copy (modified) of the second recension of the collection of conciliar canons and papal decretals compiled by Dionysius Exiguus (<i>fl</i>. 525). The same collection of canons also formed the basis of teaching in canon law at the school of Theodore and Hadrian in Canterbury; excerpts from it also constitute the second book of the <span class="italic">Judicia</span> which have been transmitted under Theodore's name. In their present form, these <span class="italic">Judicia</span> present the responses given <i>viva voce</i> by Theodore to various questions put to him by one Eoda (otherwise unknown) on matters of private penance; the answers were subsequently edited by an unidentified &#145;disciple of the [North]umbrians&#146; (<i>discipulus Umbrensium</i>). The first book of the <span class="italic">Judicia</span> is concerned with private penance, the second with canon law. It is interesting that many of Theodore's judgements on matters of penance were informed by his experience as a Greek monk; in particular, St Basil is quoted by name five times (the text in question being the three canonical letters to Amphilochius of Iconium), but other Greek authorities such as Gregory of Nazianzus and the pseudo-Dionysius are quoted as well. Theodore's opinions on private penance as collected in the <span class="italic">Judicia</span> were widely influential, not only in England, but in Ireland and on the continent. Theodore here played a pivotal role in the transmission of eastern ideas to the Latin west.<br>
<br>Another sphere in which Theodore played a role of this sort is that of liturgy&#151;in particular, in the widespread use of the litany of the saints in public and private worship. Although the form of the litany, with its Greek invocation to the Lord to have mercy (<i>Kyrie eleison</i>), followed by petitions to individual saints to pray for the petitioner, is wholly familiar today, it is not attested in the Latin west before the eighth century. In fact the earliest Latin version of such a prayer is found in a prayerbook written probably at Worcester in the later eighth century  (now BL, Royal MS 2 A.XX); but it is clear that this Latin litany is a translation of a Greek litany of the saints in a form found in another (but later) Anglo-Saxon manuscript  (BL, Cotton MS Galba A.xviii). Because the form of the litany of the saints, with its characteristic long list of petitions to individual saints, is first found in Greek and Syriac manuscripts from the patriarchate of Antioch, the most reasonable hypothesis is that Archbishop Theodore brought with him to England a small prayerbook containing (among other Greek prayers) a litany of this sort, which was subsequently copied into the Galba manuscript, but also translated into the Latin form found in the Royal manuscript. In any event, the form soon spread from England to Ireland and the continent, and had become commonplace by the Carolingian period.<h2>
<a name="Scholarandteacher"></a>Scholar and teacher</h2>It was perhaps in the field of scholarship that Theodore made his most important contribution to Anglo-Saxon culture. Bede reports that, because Theodore and Hadrian were extremely learned in sacred and secular literature, &#145;they attracted a crowd of students into whose minds they daily poured the streams of wholesome learning&#146;  (Bede, <span class="italic">Hist. eccl.</span>, 4.2); he goes on to specify instruction not only in scripture but also in metre, astronomy, and computus, and adds that in his own day (731) some of their students survived who were as fluent in Greek and Latin as in their native English. One of these students was Aldhelm; among others Bede names Albinus (Hadrian's successor as abbot of St Peter's and St Paul's in Canterbury), Tobias (bishop of Rochester), and Oftfor (bishop of Worcester). With the exception of Aldhelm, none of these students has left any writings. In any event, the nature of the instruction given by Theodore and Hadrian is revealed in a substantial corpus of biblical commentaries and glosses which can be shown to have originated in their Canterbury school as notes taken by the English students from the <i>viva voce</i> instruction of the two great Mediterranean masters. In particular, a set of commentaries on the <span class="roman">Pentateuch</span> and gospels reveals the extraordinary range of learning which they brought to bear on the biblical text. It would appear that the teaching was conducted by comparing the Latin text of the <span class="roman">Vulgate Bible</span> with that of the Greek <span class="roman">Septuagint</span> and Greek <span class="roman">New Testament</span> (various comments point to meanings in the Greek text which are misrepresented in Jerome's Latin), and then illustrated by reference to a huge range of patristic authorities. These authorities are for the most part Greek ones. Although reference was made on occasion to a few Latin fathers, such as Augustine, Jerome, and Isidore, the majority of these references are to Greek exegetes: Basil of Caesarea, Clement of Alexandria, Cosmas Indicopleustes, Ephrem (in Greek), Epiphanius of Salamis, John Chrysostom, and Flavius Josephus. (Various other Greek fathers were borrowed from but not quoted by name and reference is occasionally made to patristic texts which have not survived.) The underlying intention of these commentaries was to extract the literal meaning of the biblical text: to explain the flora and fauna mentioned in the <span class="roman">Bible</span>, minerals and precious stones, the customs of the Jews, the topography of the Holy Land, and the paraphernalia of everyday life in biblical times. This method of interpretation is usually characterized as &#145;Antiochene&#146;; its deployment in the Canterbury commentaries is wholly unusual in western medieval exegesis, but is explicable in light of Theodore's background. As in earlier Antiochene exegesis, reference is frequently made to scholarly disciplines such as philosophy, rhetoric, and medicine and it is clear that Theodore had unusual expertise in these fields.<br>
<br>In addition to these commentaries on the <span class="roman">Pentateuch</span> and gospels, there is a huge (but as yet unprinted) corpus of glosses on the remaining books of the <span class="roman">Bible</span> preserved in numerous medieval manuscripts, which, when printed, will reveal how Theodore (and Hadrian) approached the remainder of the sacred text. In addition, a substantial corpus of medieval manuscripts preserves glosses to other patristic texts (notably Sulpicius Severus, Rufinus, Gildas, Isidore, Jerome, Cassian, Orosius, Gregory the Great, as well as various canons and papal decretals, and the rule of St Benedict) which manifestly derive from the teaching of Theodore and Hadrian at the Canterbury school. In their most accessible form, these glosses are preserved in the famous Leiden glossary, a manuscript copied <i>c</i>.800 at St Gallen from batches of glosses derived from the Canterbury school, and now in Leiden  (Bibliotheek der Rijksuniversiteit, Voss. lat. Q. 69); but related materials are preserved in a large number of (unprinted) manuscript glossaries.<br>
<br>The biblical commentaries and glosses are the record of Theodore's (and Hadrian's) oral teaching. A small corpus of writings composed by Theodore himself survives. There is, for example, a brief poem in octosyllables (&#145;Te nunc, sancte speculator&#146;) addressed by Theodore to H&aelig;dde, bishop of Winchester. The trochaic rhythm of these octosyllables is wholly distinct from that of other octosyllables composed in Ireland and England (for example by Aldhelm), and would appear to have been modelled by Theodore on that of Greek anacreontic hymns (also octosyllabic in form) with which he was familiar in his youth. So unusual is this form in surviving Anglo-Latin literature that three such hymns preserved in the ninth-century <span class="roman">Book of Cerne</span> (including the well-known hymn &#145;Sancte sator suffragator&#146;) can confidently be attributed to Theodore as well. Another work which is very probably by Theodore is an unprinted Latin <span class="italic">Passio sancti Anastasii</span>, an account of the Persian martyr Anastasius, who was the patron saint of the monastery of Cilician monks <i>ad aquas Salvias</i> in Rome. It has been shown that this Latin translation was produced from a copy of the Greek <i>passio</i> which had an interlinear, word-by-word gloss. Its Latin is not coherent, therefore, and it was probably this incoherent <i>passio</i> of St Anastasius which Bede &#145;corrected as best he could&#146;  (Bede, <span class="italic">Hist. eccl.</span>, 5.24). Finally, Theodore was almost certainly the author of the <span class="italic">Laterculus Malalianus</span>, a Latin work based partly on the Greek <span class="italic">Chronographia</span> of John Malalas (<i>d</i>. 578) and partly consisting of original exegesis of the life of Christ, from conception to death. The work draws on many of the same Greek fathers cited in the Canterbury biblical commentaries (notably Epiphanius and Ephrem the Syrian), and shares much of their scholarly orientation, particularly an interest in medicine and chronology.<br>
<br>Given that Theodore was some sixty-seven years old when he arrived in England, his scholarly output is astonishing. Knowledge of this output will be considerably refined when more of the works attributable to him (particularly the biblical glosses and the <span class="italic">Passio sancti Anastasii</span>) are available in print. But it may be no exaggeration to say that the school of Canterbury, under his direction between 670 and 690, represents the apogee of biblical scholarship in the Latin west between late antiquity and the twelfth century and that he was one of the greatest scholars ever to adorn the see of Canterbury.<h2>
<a name="Deathandcommemoration"></a>Death and commemoration</h2>Theodore died on 19 September 690, aged eighty-eight. He was buried in the cathedral at Canterbury and his tomb was inscribed with a metrical epitaph consisting of nineteen elegiac distichs, composed&#151;to judge from its diction&#151;by Aldhelm. The tomb and the inscription have been destroyed by successive reconstruction at Canterbury; the epitaph is known because Bede preserved eight lines of it in his <span class="italic">Historia ecclesiastica</span>  (5.8). An unprinted life of Theodore by the eleventh-century hagiographer, Goscelin, is preserved in two contemporary manuscripts; but the historical information contained in this life is derived wholly from Bede and adds nothing to our understanding.<br>
