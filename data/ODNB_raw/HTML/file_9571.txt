<span class="headword">Fitzgerald, Sir  John  fitz Edmund</span>  (1528&#150;1612), <span class="occ">landowner</span>, was the son of Edmund fitz James Fitzgerald, and succeeded his father as lay dean of Cloyne following his father's death in 1567. His mother may have been a daughter of either a seneschal of Imokilly, a Skiddy of Cork, or a man of Muskerry. At an unknown date he married Honor O'Brien, niece of the earl of Thomond, with whom he had three sons, Edmund, Thomas, and James, and two daughters, Joan and Eleanor.<br>
<br>In 1569 fitz Edmund remained loyal when the first Desmond rebellion, instigated by James fitz Maurice Fitzgerald, erupted. Sheriff of co. Cork in 1570, on 22 April of that year he was given a commission to execute martial law in the county as part of the crown's efforts to defeat the rebellion, and was appointed to a commission to shire the province of Munster into counties on 11 November 1571. In July 1579 violence returned to Munster when James fitz Maurice landed at Dingle, co. Kerry, at the head of a papal-sponsored expedition of approximately sixty men, igniting what became the second Desmond rebellion. Again he stayed loyal to the crown, suffering many rebel attacks as a consequence, some at the hands of his namesake John fitz Edmund, the seneschal of Imokilly, one of the principal rebel leaders. A raid on his lands in June 1580 resulted in the reputed loss of 3000 cattle, while the town of Cloyne was burnt the following March. By May 1581 it was estimated that he had lost over &pound;6000 in goods and cattle.<br>
<br>In late April 1582 fitz Edmund led troops under Colonel John Zouche against David Barry, Lord Barrymore, one of the main rebels in co. Cork, killing up to eighty rebels in the skirmish. As a reward for his loyal service, and recompense for his losses, he was granted an annuity of 100 marks (&pound;66 13<i>s</i>. 4<i>d</i>.) on 31 January 1583, although in July 1603 he was seeking Sir Robert Cecil's help in receiving this money. Reappointed sheriff of co. Cork, he was commissioned to execute martial law in Cork on 14 March 1586. However, he was involved in controversy in 1586 during the parliamentary session where a bill for the attainder of Gerald Fitzgerald, fourteenth earl of Desmond, killed in rebellion on 11 November 1583, was to be passed. He produced a feoffment made by Gerald, dated 10 September 1574, by which Gerald enfeoffed fitz Edmund and two others of his lands, with the use thereof accruing to Gerald and his heirs. Gerald's lands would therefore have been exempt from forfeiture as he was only proclaimed a traitor five years later, on 2 November 1579. Sir Henry Wallop, vice-treasurer of Ireland (1579&#150;98), then produced a document, the &#145;Desmond combination&#146;, whereby Gerald and some of his leading followers pledged themselves to resist Lord Deputy Sir William Fitzwilliam. This document, dated 18 July 1574, showed that Gerald had been engaged in treasonable activities prior to his feoffment, and therefore his lands would be forfeit on the passing of the bill of attainder, which was duly passed. As a result of this episode fitz Edmund's prestige suffered greatly, but he was eventually forgiven, being appointed to a commission to settle a dispute involving Sir William St Leger and Sir Richard Grenville on 21 June 1591, while in 1594 he was a commissioner for ecclesiastical causes.<br>
<br>In January 1595 fitz Edmund became embroiled in more controversy, this time with William Saxey, chief justice of Munster, when a number of witnesses alleged that he had made seditious and treacherous comments to the effect that the queen was engaged on a campaign to dispossess loyal subjects of their legally held land in Munster. In June 1596 he was indicted, and in September a three-man commission was appointed to hear his case. Saxey objected to this, insisting the case be heard in England, away from those friendly to fitz Edmund, but by 1597 circumstances had changed. Growing unrest since 1596, together with his previous loyalty, encouraged the queen to direct Lord Deputy Russell to dismiss the case against fitz Edmund in April 1597, and the following month he was pardoned.<br>
<br>In 1598 the unrest reached its zenith when James fitz Thomas Fitzgerald, the <i>s&uacute;g&aacute;n</i> earl of Desmond, broke out in rebellion in support of the earl of Tyrone, also in conflict with the crown. For the third major rebellion during his lifetime fitz Edmund supported the crown, and once again had his lands attacked by the rebel forces. In October 1600 one of his sons accompanied James fitz Gerald, the queen's earl of Desmond, who was sent to Ireland to counter the <i>s&uacute;g&aacute;n</i> earl. After landing at Youghal, James fitz Gerald spent a night at fitz Edmund's house at Cloyne. For his service to the crown he was knighted by Lord Deputy Mountjoy on 7 March 1602.<br>
<br>As dean fitz Edmund enjoyed possession of church lands in Cloyne, while he also had a number of other properties. On 20 November 1566 he received a twenty-one-year lease of three rectories in co. Cork, while on 24 January 1571 he got a similar lease for part of the possessions in co. Cork formerly belonging to the Augustinian abbey of St Thomas the Martyr (Thomas Court) in Dublin, receiving a regrant of these lands on 28 April 1584. By December 1600 he had received a custodiam of some of the <i>s&uacute;g&aacute;n</i> earl's lands, including his castle at Conna, co. Cork, getting a lease of these lands, as well as the Franciscan friary at Youghal, on 18 October 1602. In 1596 fitz Edmund's income was reputed to be &pound;1000 p.a., although, given the sustained periods of warfare and destruction and depopulation which afflicted Munster, by the time of his death it was probably much reduced. Fitz Edmund died on 15 July 1612, and was buried at Cloyne Cathedral.<br>
