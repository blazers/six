<span class="headword">Fox, Sir  John Jacob <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>Jacob]</span></span>  (1874&#150;1944), <span class="occ">analytical chemist</span>, was born on 12 April 1874 at 6 Samuel Street, Spitalfields, London, the eldest of the five sons and one daughter of Marks Fox, furrier of London, and his wife, Hannah Jacobs. He was born Jacob Fox and added the name John in the early 1920s. He was educated in London at St Thomas Charterhouse School and entered government service in 1896 as an assistant of excise. He joined the government laboratory in 1896 and, by arrangements recently made for assistants, he attended courses in chemistry at the Royal College of Science from 1897 until 1899, but did not take a degree. After completing his course he married, on 17 October 1899, Amelia 
    (Millie; <i>b</i>. 1874)
  , daughter of Saul Boas, a diamond dealer. They had a son, Charles, and a daughter, Irene. Fox next attended classes at the East London Technical College, both in the evenings and during holidays, frequently working there for twelve hours at a time. He took his intermediate science examination in 1907, his BSc (by research) in 1908, and DSc (by thesis) in 1910.<br>
<br>Fox joined the permanent staff of the government laboratory in 1904. His abilities were soon recognized and he was chosen to assist Professor Thomas Thorpe, principal of the laboratory, on the development of &#145;leadless glazes&#146; to avoid the dangers of poisoning factory workers. Fox carried out much research at East London College and at the laboratory. He became interested in ultraviolet absorption spectra, on which he carried out researches with James Dobbie, his new principal (later termed government chemist), in the years before the First World War.<br>
<br>During the war Fox devised new rapid methods of analysis to increase activity without a great increase in staff. In 1920 he was appointed a superintending chemist and exercised both his encyclopaedic knowledge of organic chemistry and his administrative abilities to organize an increased work load arising from the <span class="roman">Safeguarding of Industries Act</span> of 1921 and from new silk duties in 1926. He also wrote <span class="italic">The Analysis of Pigments, Paints, and Varnishes</span> (1927) with T. H. Bowles, and reviewed annually between 1926 and 1933, with B. A. Ellis, all published analytical methods in the <span class="italic">Annual Reports on the Progress of Chemistry</span>. He also wrote more than sixty papers for scientific journals.<br>
<br>Fox continued to carry out much research after the war with Dobbie and Sir Robert Robertson, government chemist from 1920. In 1936 he was himself appointed government chemist, having been deputy from 1929. In 1940 he joined the staff of the director of scientific research in the Ministry of Supply, as chief adviser to the controller of chemical research, while retaining his duties as government chemist. His interest in chemistry continued until the end of his life, together with his ready help to staff and enquirers. He held many offices in learned societies, and was treasurer of his local church for many years.<br>
<br>Fox was appointed OBE in 1920 and CB in 1938, and was elected FRS in 1943. He was knighted in 1944 and died later that year, on 28 November, at 24 Hayes Crescent, a nursing home in Golders Green. His wife survived him.<br>
