<span class="headword">Poekrich <span class="st"> [Pockrich]</span>,  Richard</span>  (1696/7&#150;1759), <span class="occ">inventor of musical glasses and social and economic reformer</span>, was born in Aghnamallagh, near the town of Monaghan, Ireland, and was descended from a Cromwellian planter family which had been granted land in co. Monaghan in the seventeenth century. His father, a landed gentleman also named Richard, was briefly a member of the Irish House of Commons. His mother's maiden name was probably Newburgh. A brother and a sister are mentioned in his father's will. On the death of his father, probably in 1722, Richard, as the eldest son, succeeded at the age of twenty-five to the entire family estate.<br>
<br>Poekrich went to Dublin as a young man about 1720. Although he has been accused of squandering his wealth on a variety of ill-advised projects, it has to be said that many of his proposals in the public domain were quite down-to-earth and realistic, such as providing an incentive for the reclamation of bogs through granting long leases in respect of land so reclaimed and the provision of better funding for the Dublin workhouse through tolls. In his address to the electors of Dublin in 1749, when he stood, unsuccessfully, as a candidate in the by-election of that year, he argued for the production of Irish malt liquors to replace imports from Britain and made proposals for getting the beggars off the streets and putting the able-bodied to work. Poekrich's attempt to enter parliament as an MP for co. Monaghan in 1745 had likewise been unsuccessful. It was probably on that occasion that he wrote the ballad &#145;A Lamentation&#146;, a powerful dirge about rack-renting landlords and the peasants' folly in voting such people into parliament. On 23 April 1745 he married Margaret Winter (<i>d</i>. 1758), a widow with an income of &pound;200 per annum, but owing, it is suggested, to Poekrich's impotence, the marriage did not last.<br>
<br>Poekrich is remembered as the inventor of musical glasses, by which music was produced by striking harmonically arranged goblets of glass. The invention was developed in the harmonica. Poekrich also invented a new form of dulcimer. In later life he gave concerts in various parts of England, at which practical exhibitions of his musical glasses were given.<br>
<br>In 1755 Poekrich published a volume entitled <span class="italic">Miscellaneous Works</span>, comprising poems and songs. Thomas Newburgh, a Dublin barrister, described his eccentricities and schemes in a poem entitled &#145;The Projector&#146;. &#145;A tall, middle-aged gentleman&#146;, usually wearing a bag-wig and sword, he perished on 10 November 1759 in a fire at Hamlin's Coffee House, Sweeting's Alley, near the Royal Exchange, London. Poekrich's wife seems to have formed a liaison with Theophilus Cibber, and was drowned with that author in a shipwreck in the Irish sea in 1758.<br>
<br>Although Poekrich was the butt of much hilarity in his time because of his then way-out ideas about blood transfusion and the manufacture of tin boats, and his prophecy that there would come a time when it would be as common for men to call for their wings as to call for their boots, Newburgh nevertheless conceded that Poekrich seldom disclosed any marks of an unsound mind and was a pleasant, jocular, and agreeable companion. Patently, Richard Poekrich was a man before his time.<br>
