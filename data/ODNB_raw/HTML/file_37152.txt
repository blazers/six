<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Baring,  John</span>, second Baron Revelstoke  (1863&#150;1929), <span class="occ">merchant banker</span>, was born on 7 September 1863 in Kingston upon Thames, the eldest child of the five surviving sons and three daughters of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/38281/', "Edward Charles Baring, later first Baron Revelstoke (1828&#150;1897)")</script>, and his wife, Louisa Emily Charlotte (<i>d</i>. 1892), daughter of John Crocker Bulteel of Lyneham, Devon. He was educated at Eton College and at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he excelled as an oarsman and horseman but did not take a degree.<h2>
<a name="PartnershipatBaringsandthecrisisof1890"></a>Partnership at Barings and the crisis of 1890</h2>Baring's father had from 1883 been senior partner in the merchant bank of Baring Brothers &amp; Co., and John Baring joined the firm on leaving Cambridge. He served his apprenticeship as a clerk and from 1885 until 1887 he toured the world, during which he spent some time with the firm of Kidder Peabody in the United States. Power of procuration at Barings was given him in January 1889, and his admission as a full partner followed a year later. He was fluent in French and Spanish, having lived in Spain for six months, and he had a good grounding in Italian and German.<br>
<br>In 1890 Barings experienced a liquidity crisis and had to be rescued from collapse by a Bank of England loan which was guaranteed by the banking community. The City of London narrowly avoided catastrophe. Barings' chief embarrassment was a commitment, taken up in 1888 but unsupportable by late 1890, to raise &pound;10 million for the Buenos Aires Water Supply and Drainage Company Ltd. In 1889 Barings' senior management had dispatched John Baring to Buenos Aires to investigate this company's difficulties; his discoveries shocked him and gave long notice of problems ahead.<br>
<br>In the face of what seemed to be inevitable liquidation, the junior partners, led by John and his older cousin Francis and buttressed by the assets of a retired partner, T. C. Baring, resolved to &#145;buckle to and make a fight of it&#146;  (Barings archives, DEP84). Bypassing their superiors they established a limited company, Baring Brothers &amp; Co. Ltd, financed by shares to the value of &pound;1 million taken up by relatives and City friends, and transferred to it the good business, leaving the bad debts with the old firm.<br>
<br>For the next fifteen years Baring, the firm's natural leader and chief workhorse, almost single-handedly rebuilt the business. He fully recovered its prestige, returned it to the private ownership of his family, and masterminded the orderly liquidation of the old bank whose debts were paid off and whose partners recovered some of their wealth. The achievement for a man not yet twenty-eight when the crisis broke was extraordinary, but the experience of ruin haunted him for the rest of his life, instilling in him a sense of excessive caution and a dread of being in debt. As a partner in the old business, the 1890 crisis had left him penniless and living off the generosity of relatives. His father died in 1897, and Baring was known thereafter, having inherited the barony, as Lord Revelstoke.<h2>
<a name="HeadofBarings"></a>Head of Barings</h2>Following Francis Baring's retirement in 1901, Revelstoke became senior partner and remained Barings' autocratic head until his death. He gathered around him a partnership comprised mostly of relatives, so the business remained truly a family affair. However, he insisted on a deputy of outstanding ability. Gaspard Farrer (1860&#150;1946), who worked &#145;cheek by jowl&#146;  (Barings archives, DEP193.74.14) with him from 1902, undoubtedly limited some of Revelstoke's autocratic excesses, and interpreted his actions to the junior staff. In 1925 Farrer was succeeded in this role by Edward Peacock.<br>
<br>Barings became extremely profitable, with declared profits increasing from &pound;125,000 in 1891 to almost &pound;600,000 in 1909, and to a &pound;750,000 peak for the 1920s in 1924. From 1896 Barings was owned and controlled by a new partnership and Revelstoke gradually increased his interest in its profits until his death. Thus although his income was modest in the 1890s, he eventually accumulated enormous wealth, receiving over &pound;100,000 for the first time in 1909, over &pound;200,000 in 1915, and well over &pound;100,000 in most years from then until his death. His endeavours to receive a greater share of the profits met with the outright opposition of his partners, led by Farrer who recognized the injustice to the junior employees.<br>
<br>Revelstoke was especially concerned with major transactions, such as bond issues during what was the heyday of London's capital market. But the environment was one of unprecedented competition from British and overseas banks, not least those in Paris, Berlin, and New York. He fought these competitors as ruthlessly as the next and withdrew only when profit was wanting or available at unacceptable risk. He moved with ease from one financial centre to the next, forming international syndicates of banks to underwrite bond issues and then taking a leading role in subsequent negotiations with the issuer. His clients were largely sovereign entities or giant corporations and his world was filled with presidents and finance ministers, ambassadors, and governors of national banks; the authority that he came to exercise meant that before 1914 many of them beat a path to his door. He moved around Europe by train, his secretaries furiously at work and his telegrams being sent and received at stations <i>en route</i>. His devoted assistant, Mr Hollings, organizer of this entourage, smoothed its progress through the largess to be found in a bag of gold sovereigns. But Revelstoke himself eschewed flamboyance; he kept far from the public eye.<br>
<br>After 1902 Revelstoke resumed Barings' historical connection with Argentina, rehabilitating its credit in London through leadership of numerous bond issues, mostly for the government; likewise after 1900 he returned Barings to the financing of the imperial Russian government. However, issuing for the government and railways of Canada, so important before 1890, was lost permanently afterwards, whereas financing of American business was stronger than ever. Barings again focused on railway finance, via bond issues for transcontinental and regional lines; and here Revelstoke with Farrer pitted his wits against the likes of E. H. Harriman, J. J. Stillman, and J. P. Morgan.<br>
<br>Revelstoke had no great liking for Americans but he recognized fully the emerging strategic importance of their country to his firm's issuing and trade finance businesses. When younger he had visited the USA annually, and from 1891 until 1908 his brothers Cecil and Hugo led a sister house in New York. To strengthen his American business further, in 1904 and 1905 he negotiated with Pierpont Morgan for the merger of their respective businesses in New York and London. By far the most powerful transatlantic banking alliance would have been created, but each party's overriding desire to maintain undisputed dominance in their home city scuttled the plan.<br>
<br>Under Revelstoke's leadership Barings steered clear of close involvement in British industry until the 1920s. In 1911 Revelstoke admitted to having a &#145;horror of all industrial companies&#146;  (Barings archives, DPP2.2.14), but probably he had in mind equity issues for manufacturing business. He was happier issuing debentures for infrastructure projects, and here his clients included the Mersey Docks and Harbour Board and London United Tramways. Those industrial debentures he issued&#151;largely for the armaments manufacturers Vickers, Sons and Maxim Ltd and William Beardmore &amp; Co. Ltd&#151;were handled under the name of a commercial bank, which was acting as little more than a receiving agent, as shown on the prospectus, in place of Barings. In turn the bank's own portfolio excluded securities in British industry.<h2>
<a name="Businessappointmentsandgovernmentconnections"></a>Business appointments and government connections</h2>The increasing prominence of the Baring name, and Revelstoke's desire to draw attention to the rehabilitation of his house, resulted shortly after 1900, however, in a succession of business appointments. These included his trusteeship for the debenture holders of the Cunard Steamship Company Ltd; his membership in 1900 (and chairmanship a year later) of a royal commission to examine the workings of the port of London which recommended the formation of the Port of London Authority; and his mediation in 1904 and 1905 in a furious dispute between Cunard and International Maritime Marine over north Atlantic conference rates. Sometimes, when Revelstoke saw certain profit, his commitment to industry was significant; in 1907 he joined a small syndicate of London bankers to finance and guarantee the important Caucasus Copper Company Ltd.<br>
<br>The historical depth of Barings' links with the British government, coupled with the influence of relatives, meant that few London houses were closer to the political establishment. Revelstoke courted such connections assiduously and was closest to A. J. Balfour and Lord Lansdowne, both his clients, and to H. H. Asquith for whom, in 1906, he threw a dinner party to introduce the new chancellor of the exchequer to City leaders. After 1900 Barings, while never a tool of government, worked for the promotion of British influence overseas, especially in the eastern Mediterranean. Revelstoke was closely associated with the abortive Trans-Persia Railway, formed to link the railway systems of Europe and India. Along with Sir Ernest Cassel and Sir Alexander Henderson, he took a one-third interest in the unsuccessful National Bank of Turkey. He was especially close to Cassel, whom he treated with unaccustomed deference. In 1911 he advised the committee of imperial defence on the implications for the City of war with Germany.<br>
<br>A number of Revelstoke's other transactions had enormous political implications. In 1902 he managed one of the first external bond issues for the Japanese government, which paved the way in 1904 and 1905 to arranging huge sterling bond issues in London and New York, undertaken to finance Japan's war against Russia. In doing this, Barings' long-standing and continuing relationship with the Russian government seems to have caused Revelstoke few qualms. In 1912, with Foreign Office enthusiasm, Barings was recruited to strengthen that group of British banks co-operating with, yet also competing against, other national groups for a share in Chinese government external finance.<h2>
<a name="TheFirstWorldWarandafterwards"></a>The First World War and afterwards</h2>During the First World War Revelstoke's chief preoccupation was the finance of allied governments in Europe; connections existed with those of Italy and Belgium but the needs of these administrations were dwarfed by those of Russia. Barings was London financial agent for the imperial government and Revelstoke now advised it on borrowing vast sums from the British government via the issue of Treasury bills, discounted at the Bank of England. His role was critical. As middleman he sat alongside Russian diplomatists at difficult Treasury meetings with Lloyd George, Reginald McKenna, and civil servants such as J. M. Keynes, arguing his client's cause and smoothing out difficulties. Sometimes he went to these meetings alone. He oversaw currency operations in support of the rouble and, from a distance, watched over the vast number of banking transactions required for Russia's munitions purchases. The business was immensely profitable.<br>
<br>Notwithstanding a potential conflict of interest, Revelstoke accompanied Lord Milner as minister-plenipotentiary and deputy head of the British mission to the allied conference at Petrograd in 1917. After the war he argued with the British government, steadfastly yet successfully, for the retention of frozen Russian government balances in Barings' books. Somewhat reluctantly he also arranged finance for the Omsk government resistance during the civil war that followed the Russian Revolution, via a syndicated advance secured on gold and provided by friends in London and New York.<br>
<br>After the war Revelstoke was less at ease in the City, where the international role of sterling was much reduced. Sovereign issues remained a staple activity of his business, but now they were invariably led jointly with old adversaries such as Rothschilds and Schroders, while seemingly everywhere the Americans had the upper hand. In 1929, as an elder statesman of British international capitalism, he joined Sir Josiah Stamp at Versailles as joint head of the British mission to the committee of experts&#151;the so-called Young committee&#151;reviewing the Dawes plan for German reparations. He was outraged by the tyranny of the Americans whose &#145;insolent wealth&#146; arising out of Britain's &#145;loss of blood and treasure&#146; made them &#145;the greatest profiteers that the World has ever seen&#146;  (Barings archives, 200011). He was highly important at these negotiations, petitioning forcibly for the establishment of the Bank for International Settlements, but he died before the committee's work was concluded.<br>
<br>While Revelstoke remained the undisputed head of his house in the 1920s, Edward Peacock, a Canadian recruited in 1924 as the future senior partner, steadily gained the initiative. Peacock differed culturally and temperamentally from Revelstoke and his appointment was as imaginative and courageous as it was brilliantly successful. Peacock gave the business vital new direction in the financing of British industry&#151;an area where Revelstoke was distinctly out of place&#151;which kept Barings at the forefront of London merchant banking. His appointment reflected Revelstoke's determination, strongly influenced by the 1890 crisis, to leave his house in capable hands.<h2>
<a name="LifebeyondBarings"></a>Life beyond Barings</h2>Outside Barings, Revelstoke's business activities were largely restricted to his directorship of the Bank of England. He joined the court in 1898 and its influential committee of Treasury in 1915, and sat on both until his death. Because he &#145;could never forget the Baring Crisis&#146;  (Sayers, 643), he ruled himself out as governor or deputy governor. In 1917 and 1918 he headed the so-called Revelstoke committee, formed to investigate the management of the bank in the difficult circumstances of an open quarrel between the governor and several directors. Like so many others he fell under the spell of Montagu Norman and was unusually influenced by him.<br>
<br>The increasing complexity of investment decisions and of taxation meant that Revelstoke's expert advice was sought by family and friends on the management of their capital. From 1908 until his death he was an innovative receiver-general of the duchy of Cornwall, and from this base he became the trusted financial adviser and close friend of George V and Queen Mary. He was associated with several charitable institutions, in particular King Edward's Hospital Fund, of which he was treasurer from 1914 to 1929, and Guy's Hospital, where he chaired the finance committee. He was sworn of the privy council in 1902, appointed GCVO in 1911, and in 1926 was created by George V his lord lieutenant for Middlesex. He also received honours from France, Japan, and imperial Russia.<br>
<br>Revelstoke never married but enjoyed close friendships with a number of lady friends, the most enduring being with Lady Desborough (<script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/40733/', "Ethel Grenfell")</script>). His brief affair with Nancy Astor, before her marriage, was abruptly terminated by his questioning of her capacity to cope with the social requirements of being his wife. She labelled him a snob and she was right; when he sold his motor car to his sister he changed its upholstery lest it should be recognized as formerly his. He had natural hauteur and remoteness. His London home from 1903 was 3 Carlton House Terrace, where he entertained on a lavish scale, but always with great propriety. His nieces were sent dresses to wear for their visits while women, apparently, were discouraged from excesses lest their faces became flushed. His country home was Firbank, near Market Harborough, where he hunted with the Pytchley and the Fernie hunts. Each year he spent lengthy holidays at Aix les Bains.<h2>
<a name="Deathandwealth"></a>Death and wealth</h2>Worn down by the Young committee negotiations, Revelstoke died of a heart attack at his Paris flat, 27 rue du Faubourg St Honor&eacute;, on 19 April 1929. He left unsettled net estate of over &pound;2.5 million, of which almost &pound;200,000 was bequeathed for the benefit of London's hospitals and a year's salary to each member of Barings' staff. His pictures were left to the National Gallery and the National Portrait Gallery. The barony passed to his brother Cecil.<br>
