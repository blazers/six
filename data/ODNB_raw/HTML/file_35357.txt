<span class="headword">Paget <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em> Finch-Hatton]</span>, Lady  Muriel Evelyn Vernon</span>  (1876&#150;1938), <span class="occ">humanitarian relief worker</span>, was born in London on 19 August 1876, the only daughter and elder child of Murray Edward Gordon Finch-Hatton, twelfth earl of Winchilsea and seventh earl of Nottingham (1851&#150;1898), and his wife, Edith (1855&#150;1944), only daughter of Edward William Harcourt, of Stanton Harcourt and Nuneham Park, Oxfordshire. She was educated at home. On 31 May 1897 she married the inventor <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35358/', "Sir Richard Arthur Surtees Paget, second baronet (1869&#150;1955)")</script>, of Cranmore Hall, Shepton Mallet. They had five children.<br>
<br>Muriel Paget's only brother had died in March 1892, when she was fifteen, and her own eldest child, born in March 1898, died in the following October, when she was just twenty-two. She collapsed into invalidism. But in 1905 she rallied to respond to the wretchedness of others when her aunt, Lady Templetown, suggested she become honorary secretary of a charity organizing soup kitchens in Southwark. Very soon Muriel Paget discovered that all the poor districts of London housed hungry people needing soup kitchens, and she founded a new association, the Invalid Kitchens of London, for which she remained honorary secretary until her death. By 1913 there were soup kitchens for mothers, children, and old people in Stepney, Victoria Docks, and St Pancras as well as in Southwark&#151;for which Muriel Paget had raised immense sums, principally via charity balls in high society.<br>
<br>Although pregnant with her fifth child in August 1914, Muriel Paget extended her invalid kitchens to help the Belgian refugees evacuated to London after the German invasion. In November 1914 her baby, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/51271/', "John Starr Paget")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35358/', "Paget, Sir Richard Arthur Surtees")</script>], was born, but 1915 found her organizing the funding and staffing of an Anglo-Russian base hospital in Petrograd&#151;she having been deeply moved by the account by her friend Bernard Pares of the suffering of the Russian army. In 1916 she left her family to begin a life of almost continuous humanitarian intervention abroad, returning home only for Christmas, Easter, and birthdays. She had no doubt that her own privileged children needed her less than did the millions of people in remediable pain. First she organized field hospitals, including 100 British-funded ambulances, in Galician Ukraine in 1916, for the thousands of untended Russian casualties who lay bleeding, unbandaged, and without morphine among the flyblown corpses on the battlefield. When, in 1917, the first Russian Revolution hit Petrograd, she found herself &#145;looking into the mouth of a revolver with a fierce Russian behind it. I pushed the revolver away and laughed at the soldier, who let me pass&#146;  (Blunt, 109). The British and French authorities then asked her to organize civil relief in the south that had not yet fallen to the Bolsheviks, so she went to Odessa. On learning that the situation in Kiev was still worse, she left for Kiev to find her food kitchens for 6000 people there under bombardment. The Bolshevik siege was victorious, and she and other British subjects had to be evacuated from Russia in February 1918, via Siberia, Japan, and America.<br>
<br>&#145;[Lady Muriel] never distinguished &hellip; between Imperial and Socialist Russia&#146;  (R. Byron, <span class="italic">The Times</span>, 21 June 1938). Being politically colour-blind, she was immune to the twentieth century's terrible selective indignation and selective compassion. In December 1919 she founded a Women and Children of Russia Relief Fund to support a hospital in the Crimea&#151;until Wrangel's White Russian campaign was defeated in November 1920. Then, during the Russian famine, she was permitted to return to the Soviet Union to try to set up child welfare centres and a training school for Russian nurses. That project was less successful than was her amazing relief work elsewhere in eastern Europe&#151;in Slovakia, the Baltic states, Romania, and Poland, often in conjunction with the recently established Save the Children Fund. As Harold Nicolson had reported during the Versailles conference of 1919: &#145;&#147;Her energy is terrifying. She sends Prime Ministers scuttling at her behests&#148; &hellip; [and] &#147;Prot&eacute;gez-moi, prot&eacute;gez-moi de cette dame!&#148; cried Bene&#353;, the Czechoslovak foreign minister&#146;  (Blunt, 136&#150;7). For while the male leaders were debating the political frontiers of Europe, Muriel Paget was travelling indefatigably, telephoning, writing letters, and lobbying day and night for Europe's sick, starving children. &#145;Collect all the milk you can up to 60 tons or more. Clear all the stores and get permission for export &hellip; Try to get <i>fats</i> at all price&#146;  (Blunt, 137). And her relief train duly left Paris for Prague. One very important part of the Paget Mission was the training of local paediatric nurses in Czechoslovakia and elsewhere so that sanitation, isolation, and inoculation procedures could be carried out in the war against typhus and tuberculosis.<br>
<br>In the new Baltic states of Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia the chaotic civil wars of revolution and counter-revolution continued into the 1920s. When Muriel Paget found herself on one of these battlefields she tied a white jersey to a stick and was waved through. The people of Riga, Taunus, Vilna, and Dvinsk owed their earliest food kitchens, feeding centres, infant clinics, and travelling first aid units to the Paget Mission nurses and volunteer social workers she had recruited on one of her lightning fund-raising visits to London. By 1922 all these countries' governments had taken over the work she had inaugurated. Nevertheless she had been subjected to criticism at home in <span class="italic">John Bull</span> and the Northcliffe press for not putting British needs first.<br>
<br>In 1924 Muriel Paget began work on her last rescue operation, on behalf of the destitute, stranded Britons in Russia&#151;elderly governesses, nurses, former employees of former British firms. Her organization on their behalf became known as the British Subjects in Russia Relief Association. At first she sent them money and food parcels, but by 1930 she realized she had to intervene in person and, accompanied by a social worker Dorothea Daunt, made frequent visits to Leningrad to keep up morale. &#145;When someone tried to dissuade her, saying that her prot&eacute;g&eacute;s were &#147;mere riff-raff&#148;, she said, &#147;I know. That's why I want to save them. No one else will.&#148;&#146;  (Blunt, 243). Despite the bogus charge of espionage rustled up against her in the Rakovsky show trial, she succeeded in evacuating &#145;her&#146; stranded Britons to Estonia in 1938&#151;so they escaped being deported to the gulag.<br>
<br>Lady Muriel's work brought her into frequent contact with the British consul-general in Moscow and then Leningrad, Reader Bullard, whose diaries, in which she is variously described as &#145;mad&#146; and a &#145;kind of steam-roller&#146;, record his reactions to her interventions, and leave the impression that she was &#145;a classic do-gooding pest&#146;  (Pryce-Jones). &#145;When Lady M. is about all you can do is walk about and wait until she has gone&#146;, he wrote of one meeting with her  (<span class="italic">Stalin's Russia</span>, 19&#150;20). Yet he acknowledged that &#145;when one is exasperated by her incompetence and dishonesty one forgets her courage&#146;  (ibid., 174). Those whom she saved between 1905 and 1938 would have more than reinforced this verdict. She died at her London home, 1 Devonshire Terrace, of cancer and exhaustion on 16 June 1938, having been appointed OBE in 1918 and CBE in 1938 as well as having received decorations from Belgium, Japan, imperial Russia, Romania, Czechoslovakia, Lithuania, and Latvia. The hundreds of condolence letters came from people of every social class from all over the world. She was buried at Cranmore, Shepton Mallet, Somerset.<br>
