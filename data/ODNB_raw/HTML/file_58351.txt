<span class="headword">Morgan,  Hector Davies</span>  (1785&#150;1850), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, was the only son of Hector Davies of London (<i>d</i>. 6 March 1785, aged twenty-seven) and Sophia, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2534/', "John Blackstone")</script>, first cousin of Sir William Blackstone. Hector's grandfather, the Revd David Davies, master of the free school of St Mary Overy, Southwark, took the name and arms of Morgan on his second marriage, to Christiana, one of the four nieces and heirs of John Morgan of Cardigan. Upon her death in 1800 Hector succeeded to the name. He matriculated from Trinity College, Oxford, on 24 February 1803, and proceeded BA in 1806 and MA in 1815.<br>
<br>About September 1809 Morgan was presented by Lewis Majendie to the donative curacy of Castle Hedingham in Essex, where he remained for thirty-seven years. On 7 October 1817, under the new statute of 57 George III c. 130, one of the earliest savings banks in Essex was opened by Morgan's exertions at Castle Hedingham for the Hinckford hundred. He was acting secretary until 28 November 1833, and while serving in this capacity published <span class="italic">The Expedience and Method of Providing Assurance for the Poor</span> (1830) and an address, <span class="italic">The Beneficial Operation of Banks for Savings</span> (1834), with a brief memoir of Lewis Majendie. About the same time Morgan became chaplain to George, second Baron Kenyon.<br>
<br>Morgan was appointed Bampton lecturer in 1819, and was collated by the bishop of St David's, on 7 August 1820, to the small prebend of Trallong, in the collegiate church of Brecon. He resigned the cure of Castle Hedingham in July or August 1846, and moved to Cardigan, where his second son, Thomas, was living. Morgan, who was married but whose wife's name is unknown, died there on 23 December 1850.<br>
<br>Two essays by Morgan&#151;<span class="italic">A survey of the platform of the Christian church exhibited in the scriptures</span> (1816) and <span class="italic">The doctrine of regeneration as identified with baptism and distinct from renovation, investigated, in an essay on baptism</span> (1817)&#151;each won a prize of &pound;50 from the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge and Church Union in the diocese of St David's, established on 10 October 1804 by Thomas Burgess, bishop of St David's. But his principal work was <span class="italic">The Doctrine and Law of Marriage, Adultery, and Divorce</span> (2 vols., 1826), which shows accurate and extensive reading and legal knowledge.<br>
<br>Morgan's eldest son, John Blackstone Morgan (<i>d</i>. 1832), was curate of Garsington, Oxfordshire. A third son, <a name="cosubject_58351"></a><span class="headword">James Davies Morgan</span>  (1811&#150;1846), was an <span class="occ">architect</span> who unsuccessfully submitted designs for the Palace of Westminster in 1835 and for the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford, in 1839. He lived principally at Hedingham, Essex, and designed St John's Church, Cornish Hall End, Essex. There were also two daughters.<br>
