<span class="headword">Cleghorn,  William</span>  (1718&#150;1754), <span class="occ">moral philosopher and university teacher</span>, was probably born in Edinburgh, the son of Hugh Cleghorn (<i>d</i>. 1734), a brewer and burgess of Edinburgh, and his wife, Jean Hamilton. He entered Edinburgh University in 1731 and graduated MA in 1739. He was probably intended for the ministry, and must have also studied divinity. It appears that he was licensed to preach, but never held charge of a parish. In 1739 and 1740 he was tutor to Sir Henry Nisbet of Dean, who died while still a minor.<br>
<br>In 1742 the continued absence of the Edinburgh professor of moral philosophy, John Pringle, on war service in Flanders, led the senatus of the university to appoint Cleghorn among others to conduct his classes while he was away. Pringle finally resigned from his post on 27 March 1745, and Cleghorn was appointed to the position on 5 June, after the Edinburgh clergy exercised their right to block a rival candidate, David Hume. Family connections may have played a part in the appointment. Cleghorn's grandfather William Hamilton had been principal of the university from 1730 to 1732, and one of his uncles, Gavin Hamilton, was a member of Edinburgh town council, which controlled university appointments. Cleghorn's appointment was also a victory for the squadrone political faction over the Argathelians in their ongoing battle for control of Scotland. In addition, it is probable that Cleghorn, a Presbyterian and whig, was considered a more appropriate candidate for the post than Hume, whose religious views had already attracted suspicion, and whose political position sometimes caused him to be suspected of Jacobitism  (Sher, 106, 108). Cleghorn's commitment to the whig and Presbyterian cause was amply evident in his conduct during the Jacobite rising of 1745&#150;6. He was a member of the college company of Edinburgh, volunteers formed to defend the city, and undertook to call upon the volunteers to join Sir John Cope's forces if the defence of Edinburgh were abandoned. Soon after the conflict he is said to have published a pamphlet entitled <span class="italic">Address to some Gentlemen Immediately after the Rebellion</span>, but no copies appear to be extant. He was also a member of the Revolution Club, which was dedicated to the protestant and anti-absolutist principles of the revolution of 1688.<br>
<br>Cleghorn held the moral philosophy chair for the remainder of his short life. He seems to have spent all his time in Edinburgh, apart from a brief visit to Huntingdon in 1750 and a possible tour of the highlands with Adam Ferguson. He never made any published contribution to moral philosophy, but a large collection of student lecture notes is preserved in Edinburgh University Library. Examination of these notes by modern scholars suggests that his political opinions inclined to classical republicanism and the views of Machiavelli, Harrington, and Algernon Sidney. He was a confirmed opponent of monarchical absolutism and despotism, and may have preferred republicanism to monarchy as a form of government  (Nobbs, 584, 586). His general view of moral philosophy also appears to have been heavily influenced by the thought of Cicero, particularly as expressed in <span class="italic">De officiis</span>  (Stewart-Robertson, 33&#150;4). Although not a major figure in eighteenth-century Scottish political and philosophical thought, Cleghorn apparently influenced no less a figure than Ferguson, who was commended by Cleghorn on his deathbed and who later held the moral philosophy chair. In 1754 Cleghorn's declining health led him to visit Lisbon, but he was soon back in Scotland. His condition led him to resign his chair on 21 August 1754, and he died at Edinburgh, apparently unmarried, two days later, at the age of thirty-six.<br>
