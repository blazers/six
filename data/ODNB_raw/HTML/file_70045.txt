<span class="headword">Aird,  William</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1606/7), <span class="occ">Church of Scotland minister</span>, worked as a mason until twenty years old. His wife, whose name is not known, taught him to read, and he later acquired Latin, Greek, and Hebrew. He studied theology for several years, probably at Edinburgh, and may have attended the university there during the first year after its opening in 1583, as he was called to the ministry in 1584. Shortly afterwards he fled to England with other ministers who opposed the passing by parliament in May of the <span class="roman">Black Acts</span>, which asserted the king's supremacy over the kirk. He remained in Berwick upon Tweed in the company of James Melville, but had returned to Edinburgh by October 1585, when the town council requested the return of John Cairns, reader, to St Giles, whom failing, either Michael Cranston, minister of Selkirk, or William Aird. The latter was eventually admitted minister of the collegiate charge of St Cuthbert's, Edinburgh, on 13 September 1586, as colleague of Robert Pont.<br>
<br>Aird remained close to the ministers opposed to the ecclesiastical policy of the crown and was in no way as cautious as Pont. In December 1592 he was one of the Edinburgh ministers vehemently opposed to Francis Stewart, first earl of Bothwell, and it was he who pronounced Bothwell's excommunication in February 1595. At the beginning of 1598 Robert Bruce, minister of Edinburgh and a prominent opponent of James VI, attempted to have Aird as one of his colleagues. This did not happen. At that year's general assembly Aird, along with Bruce, James Melville, and others, opposed the king's wishes in maintaining that ministers ought not to have the right to vote in parliament. There is no record of Aird's having been involved in the proceedings of any other general assembly and his name is listed only among the commissioners of the assembly of 1602. James VI is said to have sent him a purse of gold, probably during this assembly, but although Aird was impoverished he refused to accept it, considering it to be a bribe. However, an unknown hand left some sacks of meal the following day at his manse.<br>
<br>Exactly when Aird died is not known. He was present at a kirk session meeting at St Cuthbert's on 19 July 1606, but was dead by 20 September 1607, when his successor, William Arthur, was called. Aird's son John assisted his father after graduating MA at the University of Edinburgh in 1604, and was minister of Newton in 1614 before becoming minister of Newbattle the following year. He had the same attitude towards royal authority as his father, signing the protestation for the liberties of the kirk in 1617.<br>
