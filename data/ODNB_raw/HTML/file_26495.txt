<span class="headword">Clementina</span> <span class="st"> [Maria Clementina Stuart, <em>n&eacute;e </em>Sobieska]</span>  (1702&#150;1735), <span class="occ">consort of James Francis Edward, Jacobite claimant to the English, Scottish, and Irish thrones</span>, was born Maria Clementina on 18 July 1702. She was the third and youngest daughter of James Sobieski, prince of Poland, and his wife, Hedwig Elizabeth of Neuberg. Clementina's grandfather was the Polish hero-king John III, who turned the Turks back at the gates of Vienna in 1683, but the Polish crown was not hereditary and her father failed to be elected king on John's death. However, James retained powerful royal connections through his wife, whose sisters were Holy Roman empress and queen of Spain, and Clementina's sisters in turn married well; the elder, Casimira, was betrothed to James Francis Edward's cousin, the duke of Modena, while Charlotte married the powerful duc de Bouillon, great chamberlain of France and regular drinking and gambling partner of Louis XV.<br>
<br>To the alarm of many Jacobites, by 1718 <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/14594/', "James Francis Edward (1688&#150;1766)")</script> had reached the age of thirty without wife or heir, and had been rejected by the daughter of the duke of Modena. Finding a bride would be a delicate task, partly because he was a king without a throne, but also because the government in London was expected to put every obstacle in the way of a Stuart marriage. James ordered Charles Wogan, a passionately loyal Irish adventurer, to scour the courts of central Europe in search of a suitable bride, adding as an afterthought that he should enquire about the Sobieski prince's daughters &#145;if they fall in your way or be not much out of it&#146;  (<span class="italic">Stuart Papers</span>, 5.284&#150;5). Wogan found the princesses at Ohlau, and was enchanted with the youngest, sixteen-year-old Clementina, who was pious and beautiful, with large glowing eyes, brown hair, and a passionate desire to become queen of Britain one day. The pope was her godfather and she would bring a large dowry. James proposed at once and was accepted.<br>
<br>George I prevailed upon the Holy Roman emperor to arrest Clementina as she travelled through Austria on her way to Italy, and the young princess was detained in the Schloss Ambras at Innsbruck during winter 1718&#150;19. Wogan again came to James's rescue by spiriting his bride out of the castle disguised as a maid, and after a nightmare journey over the snowbound Brenner Pass, Clementina reached Bologna in April 1719. No bridegroom awaited her; James had departed for Spain to lead what became another ill-fated Jacobite rising, but had left instructions for a proxy marriage ceremony to be performed as soon as his bride arrived. Following this ceremony on 9 May, Clementina continued her journey to Rome, where she was f&ecirc;ted as the British queen. Four months later, after the failure of the 1719 rising, Clementina met her husband for the first time on 2 September at Montefiascone, and on the same day a second marriage ceremony took place in the cathedral there. Clementina and James settled in the Palazzo Muti, a small palace in Rome which the pope made over to them, and here, to the great joy of the Jacobite world, their first child, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5145/', "Charles Edward")</script>, was born on the last day of the year 1720. A second son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/12964/', "Henry Benedict")</script>, followed five years later on 6 March 1725.<br>
<br>Clementina's happiness was short-lived; even before the birth of Charles it was becoming evident that the marriage was not the success she or Jacobite followers had hoped for. James was twelve years older than his wife, and his &#145;dour, stoical, pragmatic approach to life failed to strike a chord in her romantic soul&#146;  (McLynn, 13). The drab Palazzo Muti offered none of the fun of her father's court at Ohlau, while her husband closeted himself away, writing endless letters and plotting to regain his crown. With a mounting sense of exclusion, it soon became evident to Clementina, that while she might be called queen of Britain in Rome, she would never reign in that country.<br>
<br>The peace of the Muti was broken by frequent quarrels, which led to tantrums on the part of Clementina and cold withdrawal by James. According to John Hay (later Jacobite earl of Inverness): &#145;Their tempers are so very different that, although they are never of the same opinion on the smallest trifles, the one will not yield an inch to the other &hellip; which must end in something very dismal&#146;  (Hay to earl of Mar, 21 April 1722, Stuart papers, 64/93). They argued fiercely whenever they were together, yet missed one another when apart. Clementina wrote on the last day of July 1722:<blockquote>I am trying now to overcome my bad temper so as to appear to you in the future as the best girl in the world &hellip; I shall know no rest or quietude until I am in the arms of my Carissimo. (ibid., 61/64)</blockquote>Ever solicitous of his wife's feelings, James intercepted correspondence from Ohlau to cushion the blow when her mother was dying, and he diverted her by taking her to watch the palio and visit religious houses at Bologna and Lucca.<br>
<br>Charles Edward's development towards boyhood introduced more serious causes for dissent. Both parents were utterly devoted to him, but for different reasons: Clementina to compensate for her husband's neglect, and James because the child was heir to his royal line. Protestant nurses were appointed to care for the child, but the earl of Mar proposed Mrs Sheldon, a Roman Catholic, as governess. Clementina, now lonely and miserable, fell under the influence of this domineering woman, who inflamed new quarrels over the child's education. Sheldon resented every protestant at court and spread rumours that James was having an affair with Hay's wife. Gossip, encouraged by Hanoverian spies, suggested that Charles was a sickly child and that Clementina could never bear a second child. According to rumours, Pope Clement XII was &#145;commonly supposed&#146; to be her lover  (<span class="italic">The Complete Letters of Lady Mary Wortley Montagu</span>, ed. R. Halsband, 3 vols., 1965&#150;7, 2.228).<br>
<br>As the young prince grew up he became aware of his father's cold withdrawals from family life and his mother's tantrums. As early as the age of three he could be wilful and disobedient, mortifying the court once by refusing to kneel when presented to Pope Benedict XIII. In November 1725 James decided the boy needed a firmer hand, so he took him away from Mrs Sheldon and female nurses and handed him over to male governors, first Andrew Michael Ramsay and later James Murray of Stormont, with Thomas Sheridan as under-governor. Although it has generally been assumed that this was done simply because James wanted a stronger masculine influence around his son, it has been suggested that in the eighteenth century there was a fear among aristocratic parents that children left in the care of females might be sexually molested  (McLynn, 13). The truth may lie somewhere in between, and apart from personal dislike of Mrs Sheldon, James was certainly blinkered by a lack of understanding of women. The appointment of Murray and Sheridan could not have come at a worse time, since in March Clementina had proved the gossips wrong by giving the Stuarts a second prince, Henry Benedict. By now, however, she was suffering from some form of hysteria, in all probability post-puerperal depression  (State papers, Italian States, quoted in McLynn, 14). Abetted by Mrs Sheldon, Clementina may have seen this thrusting of her first-born into the charge of so many men as an attempt to cut her off from her beloved Charles.<br>
<br>Clementina now prayed and brooded by turns, storming at her husband that he must get rid of Hay and his wife, as well as Murray, and Winifred, countess of Nithsdale, who had been given charge of Prince Henry. James refused, and dismissed Mrs Sheldon. On 15 November 1725 Clementina drove out of the palace with Sheldon and her other ladies and sought sanctuary in the convent of St Cecilia, where she poured out her marital woes to the nuns. The pope, fearing the Stuarts might abandon the Roman Catholic faith to regain their throne, took Clementina's part and reduced James's allowance. While Clementina wrote &#145;wronged wife&#146; letters to the king of France and the queen of Spain, her husband wrote to his wife's relatives, at one stage suggesting to her father that she should be sent back to Ohlau  (James Francis Edward to Prince James Sobieski, 16 Nov 1725, Stuart papers, 87/81). He visited her at the convent, but no reconciliation resulted, and neither talked afterwards of what was discussed. The quarrel turned into a grim internecine war which left supporters of the movement in Britain and throughout Europe greatly demoralized. By playing on the pope's fear that Prince Charles might abandon his Roman Catholic faith, Cardinal Giulio Alberoni, outwardly Jacobite but in the pay of London, ensured that Clementina remained in the convent and reconciliation proved next to impossible. While James blamed his old enemy, the earl of Mar, Clementina railed against the Dunbar&#150;Hay clique, who were hated even by fellow protestant Jacobites. All this dissent caused irreparable damage to James's cause.<br>
<br>Although the Hays left James's service in spring 1727, Clementina still refused to leave the convent, and in June, when George I died, her husband set out for France to seek help from Louis XV to mount an invasion of Britain. With tragic mistiming Clementina chose that moment to leave the convent and join her sons at Bologna. She had been separated from husband and children for two years, but now poured out her love to her boys only to abandon them again for long periods to go on pilgrimages. She refused to join James at Avignon, nor would she be reconciled on his return to Italy early in 1728, and she continued to keep Mrs Sheldon at her side. In despair James told Hay:<blockquote>She leads a singular life &hellip; and when she is not at Church or at Table, is locked up in her room and sees no mortal but her maids or so; she eats meat this Lent, but fasts to the degree that I believe no married woman that pretends to have children ever did; I am very little with her. I let her do what she will. (James to Hay, 7 Feb 1728, Stuart papers, 114/16)</blockquote>Clementina spent her time fasting and kneeling in prayer in cold, damp churches for such long periods that her health became damaged permanently, and she refused to accompany her family to Albano that summer. Now a deeply pious recluse, she no longer ate with her family, but kept her own little table, where James watched helplessly as she toyed with her food and grew weaker. She also suffered from asthma and manic depression as well as some allergy condition (see correspondence in <span class="italic">The Scotsman</span>, 15, 22, 26 April 1988, and H. Douglas, <span class="italic">The Private Passions of Bonnie Prince Charlie</span>, 1998, 45&#150;6). Her health deteriorated alarmingly.<br>
<br>During 1728 Clementina again fell pregnant but, hardly surprisingly, lost the child. There were rumours of other pregnancies, but the plain fact is that the couple rarely slept together and James lived much of the time at Albano while Clementina remained in Rome. She still showed great love for her children, however. When Charles was sent off to gain military experience with the Spanish army then besieging Gaeta in southern Italy in 1734, she became terrified for his safety and rushed off to church to pray for him. By the end of that year, when the prince attained his fourteenth birthday, it was evident that his mother was dying. Although it is difficult to diagnose at this distance in time and without fuller detail of her medical condition, she now was almost certainly suffering from some form of lung disease, probably tuberculosis. On 12 January 1735 Clementina received the last rites of the church, but remained perfectly lucid and asked to see her sons to plead with them never to abandon their Roman Catholicism for all the kingdoms in the world. On 18 January 1735 she died at the Palazzo Muti, Rome, and was laid to rest in St Peter's.<br>
<br>Historians have expressed the view that Clementina was quite unfitted to be the wife of an exile such as James, and Sir Charles Petrie goes so far as to say that, had the Pretender been restored to the throne during her lifetime, she must of necessity have become as much his evil genius as Henrietta Maria had been of his grandfather, and more than Mary of Modena had been of his father. As it was, Petrie claimed, she exercised no influence upon the course of the Jacobite movement. That verdict cannot be sustained: the conduct of Clementina and inept response of her husband caused irreparable damage to the Jacobites at a time when their cause was already at a low ebb. As for her son, those frequent withdrawals of a mother's love and abandonment during his formative years lay at the root of Charles Edward's inability to establish lasting stable relationships with men or women; this later played an important part in the failure of the Jacobite cause which he came in time to lead.<br>
