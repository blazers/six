<span class="headword">Glover,  Richard</span>  (1837&#150;1919), <span class="occ">Baptist minister</span>, was born on 6 January 1837 in South Shields, one of ten children (and the youngest of eight sons) of Terrot Glover (1802&#150;1885), a prosperous Scottish businessman, active Liberal, and respected civic leader, and his wife, Anne, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Reaveley (1798&#150;1858). The family had links with the sea: Terrot Glover had money in ships and two of his sons were shipowners (one son, John, becoming chairman of Lloyds), and in his youth Richard voyaged widely. They were also Presbyterian, Terrot Glover serving for nearly sixty years as elder of the English Presbyterian church.<br>
<br>In 1846 Richard Glover became one of the first pupils at a sessional day school linked to St John's Presbyterian Church, South Shields. From 1853 to 1855 he studied arts at Edinburgh University, without taking a degree. From 1855 to 1856 he took evening classes at King's College, London, in the <span class="roman">Old</span> and <span class="roman">New</span> testaments, English language and composition, history, and geography. In 1856 he began training for the ministry at the Presbyterian college, London, completing his course in 1860. While training, however, Glover became convinced of the case for believer's baptism and self-governing local churches. Encouraged by a friend, and with a letter of introduction from his tutor, he visited William Landels, minister of the Regent's Park Baptist Chapel. Soon after, Landels baptized him, recommending him to the small Blackfriars Street Church in Glasgow's east end. On preaching there, Glover was at once invited to the pastorate, starting in January 1861. During eight years' ministry he became known as a thought-provoking preacher, at ease with all kinds of people, notable especially for his Sunday evening lectures for young men on subjects such as science and religion. He spoke often at meetings of the Baptist Association of Scotland and helped initiate a new Baptist Union in Scotland. He also began a lifelong campaign to promote worldwide evangelism, making his mark with an inspirational sermon, preached at Landels's suggestion at the May meetings of the Baptist Missionary Society (BMS) in 1867. He married Anne Finlay (1838&#150;1924) of Glasgow on 26 March 1866. Of their three children, Dorothy was the first woman to chair the BMS, while <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/33427/', "Terrot Reaveley Glover")</script> became a distinguished Cambridge classicist and leading Baptist layman, perhaps best known for his influential <span class="italic">The Jesus of History</span> (1917).<br>
<br>Glover's main ministry was at Bristol, however, where in April 1869 he became the first minister of Tyndale Baptist Church, newly formed to serve the fast-growing and wealthy suburbs of Clifton and Redland. Glover remained at Tyndale until his retirement in 1911, assisted from 1908 by Herbert Burdett. The first twenty years saw Tyndale's membership multiply tenfold, a lecture hall and classrooms added, and a mission church founded. As secretary to the Bristol Baptist college from 1873 to 1919, Glover befriended and influenced generations of ministerial students. Patriarchal in appearance, with a mane of white hair and well-trimmed beard, he became well known in the city. He was a governor of the city's infirmary and an honorary secretary of the convalescent home, founded at his suggestion to mark Queen Victoria's diamond jubilee. In this last, as in other projects, he could count on the backing of wealthy and influential church members: in its first twenty-five years the church was said to have raised some &pound;40,000 for good causes, excluding buildings.<br>
<br>Within the wider Baptist denomination Glover was active, influential, well liked and respected, and known for his geniality, deep personal faith, wide interests, and freshness of approach. He championed the closer integration of home and overseas mission work, and as Baptist Union president in 1884 urged the need for evangelism. When the down-grade controversy shook the union, Glover managed to stay on good terms with all the protagonists. He himself was progressive in theology. Repelled by Calvinism's judgemental aspects, he was open to modern scientific teaching and Biblical criticism, confident that they could not threaten Christianity.<br>
<br>Glover took part in the ecumenical discussions at Grindelwald in 1891 and spoke at the second Free Church congress in 1894. His great passion, however, was overseas mission. In 1879, to much relief at Tyndale, he declined to become the BMS Indian secretary, but from 1873 until his death he was an influential member (and from 1907 an honorary member) of the society's committee, chairing the China subcommittee from 1884 to 1912. Resisting firmly any suggestion that finance should dictate missionary work, Glover raised funds effectively for the BMS and sister societies. His own church gave significantly, both in money and workers. Glover stressed the need for missionaries to understand the culture and respect the beliefs of the people among whom they worked. He travelled widely for the BMS, most notably to China with Thomas Morris of Ipswich in 1890. This visit, the first ever &#145;home deputation&#146; to the China mission field, was described by Morris in <span class="italic">A Winter in North China</span> (1892), for which Glover wrote the introduction. Shortly after his return from China, in 1891, Glover received an honorary DD from Edinburgh University. This was followed, in 1912, by an LLD from Bristol University.<br>
<br>Glover's published works included teacher's commentaries on the gospel of <span class="roman">St Mark</span> (1884) and the gospel of <span class="roman">St Matthew</span> (1889); lectures on the Lord's prayer (1881), the <span class="roman">Beatitudes</span> (1888), and the fourteenth chapter of the gospel of <span class="roman">St John</span> (1908); a biography, <span class="italic">Herbert Stanley Jenkins, Medical Missionary, Shensi, China</span> (1914); and&#151;reflecting his love of children&#151;several sets of &#145;Notes for teachers&#146; in the <span class="italic">Sunday School Chronicle</span>. Glover died on 26 March 1919 at 15 Westfield Park, Clifton, Bristol, after some years of failing health. He was buried in Bristol's Canford cemetery.<br>
