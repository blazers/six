<span class="headword">Overton,  Charles</span>  (1805&#150;1889), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and author</span>, the sixth son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20972/', "John Overton (1763&#150;1838)")</script>, rector of St Crux and St Margaret, York, and his wife, Elizabeth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Stodart (<i>d</i>. 1827), was born in York. He was expected to become a civil engineer, and so not sent to university, but in 1829 he was ordained a deacon by the archbishop of York, Vernon Harcourt. He was for a short time assistant curate of Christ Church, Harrogate, but in the year of his ordination became curate of Romaldkirk, Yorkshire. In the same year he married Amelia Charlesworth, who died in 1885. They had four sons and three daughters. In 1837 J. B. Sumner, bishop of Chester, presented him to the vicarage of Clapham, in the West Riding of Yorkshire, and in 1841 to that of Cottingham, near Hull, where he spent the rest of his life.<br>
<br>Like his father Overton was a firmly convinced evangelical, but was not narrowly partisan and could sympathize with good men who belonged to other schools of thought. He was an able preacher and an active pastor in his large and scattered parish, then encompassing Skidby and Newland, which later became separate parishes. Chiefly through his own exertions funds were raised to enable the parish church to be restored and parsonages and schools to be built.<br>
<br>Overton wrote both in prose and in verse. His first poem, entitled <span class="italic">Ecclesia Anglicana</span> (1833), was written at Romaldkirk to celebrate the restoration of York Minster after its partial destruction by the arsonist and religious fanatic Jonathan Martin (1782&#150;1838). A later edition appeared in 1853. It was good-humouredly satirized by Tom Moore, who began his parody:<blockquote>
<div>Sweet singer of Romaldkirk, thou who art reckoned,<br>
</div>
<div>By critics episcopal, David the Second,<br>
</div>
<div>If thus, as a curate, so lofty your flight,<br>
</div>
<div>Only think in a Rectory how you would write!<br>
</div>
</blockquote>Probably the best-known of his other works was <span class="italic">Cottage Lectures, or, &#145;The Pilgrim's Progress&#146; Practically Explained</span> (1847&#150;8). He died on 31 March 1889 at Cottingham, where he was buried in the churchyard six days later.<br>
