<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Simpson family</span>  (<em>per. </em>1894&#150;1990), <span class="occ">clothing manufacturers</span>, came to prominence with <a name="cosubject_39663"></a><span class="headword">Simeon Simpson</span>  (1878&#150;1932)<span class="occ"></span>. Born in London and apprenticed as a tailor, he is said to have opened a workshop in the East End of London in 1894. A highly skilled cutter and designer, a good organizer with the ability to retain a loyal workforce, he enjoyed increasing success and after expanding out of several East End workshops, opened his first purpose-built factory at 109 Middlesex Street, London E1, in 1917, largely in response to the demand for uniforms in the First World War. He married Sarah (1880&#150;1959); they had at least two sons and a daughter.<br>
<br>In the difficult post-war years Simpson concentrated on good quality ready-to-wear suits as well as providing provincial tailors and outfitters with a swift, reliable, mail-order wholesale bespoke service, with the suits fitted by the retailer but made in the factory. With prices about two-thirds lower than those of completely custom-made garments, demand outgrew supply and in 1929 he built a new factory at 92&#150;100 Stoke Newington Road, London, promoted as the largest and most modern clothing factory in the world. Despite active participation in the management of the factory and travels to Europe and the USA for style ideas and manufacturing techniques, Simeon Simpson was active in Jewish communal and local municipal affairs. He was elected as Municipal Reform candidate for Hackney borough council in 1925, and in 1931, after the family had moved to 88 Fitzjohn's Avenue, Hampstead, to Hampstead borough council.<br>
<br>Simpson died on 12 July 1932, from a perforated ulcer, at Hallam House, Hallam Street, London. He was mourned, with a sincerity which appears to be justified, as &#145;a good man, a good son, a good husband, a good father, a good friend and a model employer&#146;  (<span class="italic">Hackney Gazette and North London Advertiser</span>, 22 July 1932). After a legacy to his married daughter Rebecca Woolf, whose City solicitor husband Arthur was later to become a director of the firm, his estate was left equally between his wife, remembered as a warm-hearted and positive partner in the family and the business, and his sons, Alexander and Samuel Leonard.<br>
<br>It was his younger son, <a name="cosubject_56676"></a><span class="headword">Alexander Simpson</span>  (1902/3&#150;1937)<span class="occ"></span>, who took over the running of the firm. Known as Mr Alex to his employees, he was an enthusiast for style and quality who had saved pocket money for good, smart clothes while a child. Alexander entered the trade at fifteen, straight from Westminster City School, learned the business thoroughly at home and abroad, and at the age of twenty-one became his father's right hand in the planning of the new factory and partner in charge of sales. He shared with his father the credit for introducing the adjustable self-supporting trouser, obviating the need for belts or braces, patented in 1932. As Daks slacks they were the first fashion sports trouser and so convinced were Simeon and Alex Simpson of the quality of the design that they made 10,000 pairs in advance of the first sale. The trade mark Daks, registered in 1934, is, according to family legend, a combination of Dad and slacks, a late night inspiration of Alex and his brother Samuel Leonard, approved by William Crawford, their advertising agent and friend. Demand was great and by 1936 when S. Simpson Ltd changed from being a private to a public company, it had an issued capital of &pound;350,000, all held by the family, and employed 2500 people. In April 1936 Simpson married Ceridwen Catherine Rees Roberts, the daughter of a neighbour.<br>
<br>Alexander Simpson had a particular flair for promotion. In 1934 he and William Crawford organized a very successful Simpson stand at the British Industries Fair. This was the first to use live male models and sports demonstrations. In the same year he began to plan a permanent showplace for Simpson clothes, a prestige London shop. After acquiring the Piccadilly site, he commissioned a design team for what he intended as the most modern shop in London, with a unique feature, the largest curving plate glass windows in the world. Correspondence shows him to have worked closely and amiably with the architect Joseph Emberton. Interiors were designed by L&aacute;szl&oacute; Moholy-Nagy, design and lettering concept by Ashley Havinden. The shop became a listed building, acknowledged as a modernist classic. It had been financed by the parent company, with a supplementary loan arranged by the Yorkshire wool magnate Lord Barnby, later a director. In just over two years the shop was complete, opening on 24 April 1936, and by 1939 edging into profit. Only thirteen months after the store opened, Alexander Simpson's life was cut short by leukaemia; he died at Rookery Wood, Highwood Hill, Mill Hill, Hendon, on 15 May 1937.<br>
<br>The shock to the trade was great, for Mr Alex was popular and admired. Dark haired like his father, he was similarly active in Jewish and local affairs, especially those relating to young people. Of large build, he was lively, a good communicator, and &#145;never made a boring speech in his life&#146; according to <span class="italic">Mens Wear</span> (1937). Fond of amateur football, boxing, and fast cars, he had the family ability to get on with staff of any age and level. Knowledgeable about all aspects of the men's wear, he was a perfectionist with a sense of style and quality which included but went far beyond clothes.<br>
<br>The direction of the family business then passed to Alexander's brother <a name="cosubject_48193"></a><span class="headword">Samuel Leonard Simpson</span>  (1900&#150;1983)<span class="occ"></span>, known in the firm as the Doctor. Although he was educated like his brother at Westminster City School, his career had taken a different path. A Cambridge scholar and prizeman with a double first in the natural science tripos, he was also a boxing blue and in 1922 captain of the university boxing team. However, he refused the invitation to become a professional boxer. After qualifying as a doctor at the London Hospital in 1926, he worked at the Mayo Clinic in New York, as well as in Berlin and at the Lister Institute in London. He became a specialist in endocrinology and his book, <span class="italic">Major Endocrine Disorders</span> (1938; 3rd edn, 1959), became a standard work. He was already a distinguished and established physician so the decision to run the clothing business could not have been an easy one. On the advice of his Cambridge professor, he decided to divide his time between his practice and the family firm. He was fortunate in that, as part of a close family, not only had he already absorbed many of the essentials of the family business, he also had the help of long-standing employees of the firm. Solomon Klein (Mr Solly), for instance, had been apprentice and assistant to his grandfather, a director of the parent company from 1935, of Simpson Piccadilly from 1936, and was to become managing director in 1940 and joint managing director in 1949. In 1940 Simpson married Heddy Monique, Baroness de Podmansky (1908&#150;1994); they had one daughter.<br>
<br>Urbane, considerate, and very organized, as adept in staff management as his father and brother, Samuel Leonard Simpson spent Tuesdays and Thursdays at Simpsons, the last week of every month at meetings, and combined research, business, and lecture trips overseas. His medical interests also extended to metabolic research. A generous donation in 1964 to the medical school at St Mary's Hospital, London, where he was to become honorary consultant endocrinologist, was instrumental in founding the Alexander and Leonard Simpson Laboratory for Metabolic Research, a memorial to his brother. His industrial psychological work was relevant when he became director of personnel and chairman of the appointments board of Simpsons. His joint consultation committee on staff matters (1947) was as effective in staff management in the difficult post-war period as his brother's earlier concept, &#145;Partners in Progress&#146;, had been with staff and retailers in the economically fraught years of the 1920s and 1930s.<br>
<br>Initially vice-chairman, Samuel Leonard Simpson was precluded by his profession from taking up the chairmanship of S. Simpson Ltd, Simpsons (Piccadilly) Ltd, and Daks Simpson Ltd, until 1957. He then held these positions until retirement in 1983, his international as well as his sporting interests suggesting useful new directions for the firm. He is credited with the 1940 formation of the Simpson Service Club which performed an important public service role for the allied forces as well as providing a venue for prestige patriotic entertaining and exhibitions, events which were to continue as features of Simpson publicity. Simpson also developed a concerted export plan: Simpson Imports Incorporated was established in New York in 1941 and Daks Canada in 1950. From 1948 to 1952 he was a member of the grand council of the Federation of British Industries. He was also a member of the Carlton Club. By 1966 Daks Simpson were the biggest exporters of British menswear. The manufacturing side was similarly well served. The Stoke Newington factory, damaged by bombing in 1940, was finally replaced with a purpose-built factory at Larkhall, near Glasgow, in 1949, and was extended in 1963.<br>
<br>Golf, another of Samuel Leonard Simpson's pursuits, also became a Simpson speciality. Tournaments were regularly sponsored, most notably from 1961 the Walter Hagen annual award, which he was himself to receive in 1977. His interest in horses, which he bred on his estate at Grouselands, Sussex, and which he shared with his family, led the firm to sponsor many equestrian events. The Doctor was also an amateur painter of some skill but though he exhibited, this was in the main a private pleasure. His interest in the arts led to an important gift of current fashions to the Victoria and Albert Museum in 1979.<br>
<br>Heddy Simpson, who became a director in 1947, was vivacious and elegant. She was notable hostess at their London home (formerly that of Winston Churchill), 28 Hyde Park Gate, and was influential in the fashion focus of the Jermyn Street extension of the Piccadilly store opened in 1957. It was a role her daughter Georgina, who became a director in 1976, was to perform with great flair in 1977 for the opening of &#145;SJS&#146; and &#145;Young and Gay&#146;, new Simpson departments aimed at the youth market.<br>
<br>Sports sponsorship, export achievement, and a traditional English quality image became the Daks Simpson hallmark. As their prestige grew, they were awarded a royal warrant by the duke of Edinburgh in 1954, by the queen in 1962, and the prince of Wales in 1982. Samuel Leonard Simpson died peacefully at Crawley Hospital, Sussex, on 3 August 1983. On the sale of the firm to Sankyo Seiko Osaka in 1990, for &pound;65 million, the formal family association with the firm ceased. The Simpson Family Charity Trust, founded in the same year, nevertheless perpetuated the family's philanthropic commitment.<br>
