<span class="headword">Oliver</span> <span class="st"> [Oliver fitz Regis]</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1218/19), <span class="occ">soldier</span>, was the illegitimate son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/14841/', "King John")</script> and of Hawise, almost certainly the sister of Eve de Tracy and Fulk Fitzwarine. He was probably born before John came to the throne. Very little is known of him until he is found fighting on the royalist side during the civil war of 1215&#150;17. In June 1216 he was one of those besieged in the bishop of Winchester's castle of Wolvesey, situated in Winchester itself, by Prince Louis of France and English rebels. His most important action occurred during the critical siege of Dover. Louis, who had unsuccessfully attempted to take the castle in 1216, sailed from Calais on 22 April 1217 with the intention of landing at Dover itself. But just as his ships drew near a force led by Oliver and William of Kensham (Willikin of the Weald) descended upon the small force left by Louis in 1216, killing some, burning their huts, and gaining control of the cliff tops. This rendered any landing by the French extremely hazardous and obliged Louis to make instead for Sandwich. Dover remained in royal hands.<br>
<br>For his services Oliver was well rewarded, first by his father and then by the regency council of Henry III, chiefly in the form of properties confiscated from rebels. John's confidence in his son is shown by the grant made to him of the castle and honour of Tonge, Kent, in November 1215, which was confirmed in June 1217. Following the end of the civil war Oliver sailed with other English crusaders to join the forces of the fifth crusade assembled in Egypt. They landed at Damietta in August or September 1218, and it was there, later that year, or early in 1219, that Oliver died. It appears that his remains were brought back to England, since William Camden recorded their burial place in Westminster Abbey. Oliver does not appear to have married.<br>
