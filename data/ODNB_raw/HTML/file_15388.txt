<span class="headword">Kennedy,  Patrick</span>  (1800&#150;1873), <span class="occ">antiquarian</span>, was born at Kilmyshall, near Bunclody, co. Wexford, the son of Patrick Kennedy. In 1807 the family moved to Castleboro, with the result that&#151;thanks to the patronage of the Carew family&#151;the boy acquired a sound education in a traditional-style school. The area at this time was rich in folklore and communal harmony, a factor which imbued all his subsequent work with a humane warmth. In 1821 he moved to Dublin to further his education, and two years later became an assistant master with the Kildare Place Society, a pioneering project devoted to interdenominational popular education. Perhaps because of the hostility which the society provoked in certain sectors of Catholic Ireland, Kennedy (a self-effacing man) finally abandoned teaching in 1843, and opened a bookshop-cum-library in Dublin's Anglesea Street. His clients included notable figures such as Sir Charles Dilke.<br>
<br>Amid the modest literary revival stimulated by Isaac Butt, Samuel Ferguson, and others, Kennedy gained a reputation as a repository of folktales and local history. He collected his work using the pseudonym Harry Whitney. His principal publications in this vein are <span class="italic">Legends of Mount Leinster</span> (1855), <span class="italic">Banks of the Boro: a Chronicle of the County of Wexford</span> (1867), and <span class="italic">Evenings in the Duffrey</span> (1869). Kennedy's work with less local material, for example in <span class="italic">Legendary Fictions of the Irish Celts</span> (1866) and <span class="italic">The Bardic Stories of Ireland</span> (1871), prefigures the interest of W. B. Yeats, Augusta Gregory, and other writers of the Irish literary renaissance, while lacking their modernist appreciation of myth and the archaic world. His inclusion with Thomas Hood in <span class="italic">The Book of Modern Anecdotes</span> (1873) encapsulates his mid-Victorian middlebrow conception of the writer as entertainer. Nevertheless, Kennedy was one of the first people in the Anglophone world to recognize the importance of the <span class="italic">Kalevala</span> for the understanding of western folklore and tradition.<br>
<br>Kennedy's friendship and business relationship with Joseph Sheridan Le Fanu contributed to his material comfort during the 1860s. His many contributions to the <span class="italic">Dublin University Magazine</span> during Le Fanu's editorship (July 1861 to June 1869) are reflected in <span class="italic">The Wellesley Index to Victorian Periodicals</span> (1987, 4.657&#150;9) though the list given there includes some items attributed on slender, and often circular, evidential argument. It is certainly striking that the earliest article he claimed, writing to the Royal Literary Fund in April 1871, had appeared in the issue for September 1861, while the latest attributed to him by the Wellesley researchers appeared in May 1873, two months after Kennedy's death and four months after Le Fanu's. Both men were book lovers, with antiquarian interests. Though Kennedy has been cast as a specialist on Irish topics, his range in the <span class="italic">Dublin University Magazine</span> included French, Breton, and even Russian literature. His influence on Le Fanu's short fiction is evident in the stories the latter published in <span class="italic">All the Year Round</span> in 1870. Despite his modest background, his learning was both extensive and innovative, at least in the context of Victorian Dublin.<br>
<br>Patrick Kennedy died of bronchitis at his home, 9 Anglesea Street, Dublin, on 28 March 1873.<br>
