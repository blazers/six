<span class="headword">Willis, Sir  George Harry Smith</span>  (1823&#150;1900), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, of Stretham Manor, Cambridgeshire, only son of Lieutenant George Brander Willis, Royal Artillery, of Sopley Park, Hampshire, who had served in the Walcheren and Peninsular campaigns, was born at Sopley Park on 11 November 1823. Educated privately he obtained a commission on 23 April 1841 as ensign in the 77th (East Middlesex) regiment, then stationed at Malta. His further commissions were: lieutenant, 30 August 1844; captain, 27 December 1850; brevet major, 12 December 1854; brevet lieutenant-colonel, 6 June 1856; major unattached, 19 December 1856; brevet colonel, 26 June 1862; major-general, 29 May 1875 (antedated to 28 June 1868); lieutenant-general, 8 May 1880; and general, 11 May 1887.<br>
<br>Willis served with his regiment in the Mediterranean, the West Indies, and North America, and accompanied it to the Crimea in 1854. He was present at the battles of the Alma (20 September), Bulganek and McKenzie's Farm, and Inkerman (5 November), where his regiment distinguished itself, Willis leading the grenadier company in the charge. On 13 April 1855 he was appointed deputy assistant quartermaster-general on Lord Raglan's staff, and was present at the capture of the Quarries, the mismanaged attack of the Redan on 18 June, the battle of the Chernaya in August, and the fall of Sevastopol on 8 September. On 11 May 1856 he was appointed assistant quartermaster-general to the 4th division until the return of the troops to England. He was mentioned in dispatches, made a member of the L&eacute;gion d'honneur (fifth class), and received the Mejidiye (fifth class) and brevets of major and lieutenant-colonel.<br>
<br>After the Crimean War Willis went to Algeria with the French army and returned home in 1857, when he formed the 2nd battalion of the 6th (Warwickshire) regiment, with which he served until his appointment as assistant quartermaster-general at Gibraltar on 25 May 1858. He transferred to Malta as assistant adjutant-general on 20 February 1859. From 22 February 1866 he served for five years as assistant quartermaster-general on the staff of the southern district, was made a CB, military division, on 20 May 1871, and served on the headquarters staff at the War Office as assistant quartermaster-general from 25 August 1873 until his promotion to major-general.<br>
<br>Willis commanded the northern military district for three years from 1 April 1878. Despite his relative lack of experience of command on active service, in 1882 he was selected to command the 1st division in the Egyptian expedition under Sir Garnet Wolseley. He was in command at the actions of al-Magfar and Tell al-Mahuta, at the capture of Mahsama, and at the second battle of Qassasin on 9 September, and was wounded in the assault of the lines of Tell al-Kebir (13 September). He was mentioned in dispatches, received the thanks of both houses of parliament, was awarded the Osmanieh (second class), and was made a KCB.<br>
<br>Willis commanded the southern military district with headquarters at Portsmouth from 1 May 1884 until retirement on 11 November 1890. In July of the same year he was appointed colonel of the Devonshire regiment, and in October honorary colonel of the 2nd Hampshire volunteer artillery. He unsuccessfully contested Portsmouth as a Conservative parliamentary candidate in 1892. Decorated with a GCB (25 May 1895), in 1897 he was transferred to the colonelcy of his former corps, the Middlesex regiment. He was a grand officer of the L&eacute;gion d'honneur and a knight of justice of the order of St John of Jerusalem, and was in receipt of a distinguished service pension.<br>
<br>Willis married, first, in 1856, Eliza (<i>d</i>. 1867), daughter of George Gould Morgan MP, of Brickendonbury, Hertfordshire, and, second, in 1874, Ada Mary, daughter of Sir John Neeld, first baronet, who survived him. He died after a long illness at his residence, Seabank, Bournemouth, on 29 November 1900, and was buried at Sopley, near Christchurch, Hampshire.<br>
