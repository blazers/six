<span class="headword">Kennett,  Basil</span>  (1674&#150;1715), <span class="occ">antiquary and translator</span>, was born at Postling, Kent, on 21 October 1674, the son of Basil Kennett (<i>d</i>. 1686), vicar of Postling and rector of Dymchurch, and his wife, Mary White. He was educated by his elder brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15402/', "White Kennett (1660&#150;1728)")</script>, bishop of Peterborough, at a school at Bicester, Oxfordshire, and in the family of Sir William Glynne, baronet, at Ambrosden, near Bicester. In 1689 he entered St Edmund Hall, Oxford, under the tuition of his brother, who was then vice-principal. In 1690 he was elected a scholar of Corpus Christi College, Oxford, as a native of Kent, and graduated BA in 1693 and MA in 1696. That year he published his first and most successful work, <span class="italic">Romae antiquae notitia, or, The Antiquities of Rome</span>. Prefaced by two original essays&#151;&#145;The Roman learning&#146; and &#145;The Roman education&#146;&#151;it passed through many editions, and as late as 1786 the bookseller William Lowndes purchased a thirty-second share in the rights to the book. Its elegant synthesis of the antiquarian data assembled over the previous 200 years ensured it a leading place among books on the daily life of the Romans until the nineteenth century.<br>
<br>In 1697 Kennett became fellow and tutor of Corpus, and published <span class="italic">The Lives and Characters of the Ancient Greek Poets</span>. This book, like his earlier one, was dedicated to the duke of Gloucester, son of Queen Anne, and indeed there was some talk (reported in <span class="italic">Biographia Britannica</span>) of Kennett's becoming tutor to the young prince. Between 1703 and 1705 he published translations of several French works, including <span class="italic">Thoughts upon Religion</span> (1704, later edns, 1727, 1741) from Pascal's original, and original essays, of which <span class="italic">A Brief Exposition of the Apostles' Creed</span> (1705, later edns, 1721, 1726) enjoyed some success. He also presided over a collaborative translation of Puffendorf's <span class="italic">Law of Nature and Nations</span> (1703, later edns, 1710, 1717, 1729, 1749).<br>
<br>In 1705 Kennett's brother White, then a canon at Salisbury Cathedral, presented him to the vicarage of Coombe Bissett, Wiltshire. The following year he agreed, again at the instigation of his brother, a leading figure in the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts, to go as the first chaplain to the British trading factory at Leghorn. Nominated by royal licence dated 8 September 1706, he arrived in December. His appointment attracted attention both in England, where he was awarded an Oxford BD by decree of convocation the following February, and in Italy, where the Inquisition interfered with the execution of his duties and even, his brother's letters relate, with his personal safety. Though he had a firm ally in Henry Newton, British envoy at Florence, the political support needed to make his position tenable was long in coming. Kennett's health suffered, a fact variously ascribed to his scholarly lifestyle and, as suggested in a biographical note by White Kennett, a poison administered by the Inquisition. He soon decided to resign his post although, unwilling to abandon it before the still indecisive government sent out his replacement, he remained until February 1712. Before returning home he visited Florence, Rome, and Naples with the merchant Humphrey Chetham, and spent large amounts of money (much of it his brother's) on books, sculpture, and curiosities. He arrived back in July 1713, and in October took up another appointment arranged by his brother, as chaplain to William Wake, bishop of Lincoln.<br>
<br>During Kennett's absence several smaller works of his had been published, including a translation of selections from Jean-Louis de Balzac's <span class="italic">Aristippus</span> (1709). This caused some embarrassment for his brother, who had contributed the preface: soon after its publication a pamphlet entitled <span class="italic">French Favourites</span> appeared, containing extracts from it arranged so as to produce a satirical commentary on the relationship between Queen Anne and the duchess of Marlborough; authorship was attributed to White Kennett, compelling him to issue a swift denial. In May 1714 Basil Kennett was elected president of Corpus Christi College, being made DD the following July. His health had not improved. He fell seriously ill in November and died of a fever in the president's lodgings on 3 January 1715. He was buried in the college chapel on 6 January. Though his will included generous bequests to his college and university, it emerged that he had died in debt, and some of his effects had to be sold. His sermons to the merchants at Leghorn were published in 1715. His letters and unpublished works, including commentaries on the <span class="roman">Bible</span> and liturgy, &#145;Lives of the Latin poets&#146;, and notes on English poets, survive in his brother's collections, now subsumed in the Lansdowne manuscripts in the British Library.<br>
