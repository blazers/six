<span class="headword">Dodd,  Edward</span>  (1704/5?&#150;1810), <span class="occ">musical instrument maker</span>, was probably born in Northumberland in 1704 or 1705 (although Sheffield has also been suggested) and was probably either the son of John Dodd baptized at Simonburn, Northumberland, on 19 November 1704, or the son of Edward Dodd, baptized at Chollerton, Northumberland, on 19 April 1705. Considering his longevity, there are surprisingly few surviving details of his life. The first record of him in city directories, as a bow maker, is from 1802 to 1807, when he was at 11 Paradise Road, Lambeth, although he was probably resident in London by the early 1780s. From Lambeth he moved to the parish of St Bride, Fleet Street, &#145;whose archives record his death at the age of 105&#146;  (Beare and Kass). He died in London on 1 April 1810 and was apparently buried at St Bride's. Edward has been credited with many of the unmarked &#145;transitional&#146; bows from the eighteenth century that bridge the gap between the baroque and the modern bow developed in late eighteenth-century France by Fran&ccedil;ois Xavier Tourte. However, it is possible that he did not make bows before his arrival in London and probable that his output has been vastly overestimated.<br>
<br>Dodd's son <a name="cosubject_45875"></a><span class="headword">John Dodd</span> <span class="st"> [<em>called </em>Kew Dodd]</span>  (1752&#150;1839)<span class="occ"></span>, often referred to as the English Tourte, continued the family tradition and remains historically important for his contributions to the evolution of the bow, which may or may not have occurred independently of French advancements. John was baptized at Simonburn, Northumberland, on 28 December 1752 (which may also have been the day of his birth), and became a gunlock fitter and a money scale maker before turning to bow making with his father, probably from the 1780s. Active in the London area, he apparently lived in Southwark, Lambeth, Kew (during the early nineteenth century), and then Richmond, Surrey. His intemperate tendencies are said to have brought financial difficulties, often forcing him to place productivity over quality and ultimately, despite generous friends, landing him in Richmond workhouse. He died in Richmond on 4 October 1839.<br>
<br>Although his craftsmanship was not as consistent as that of Tourte, John Dodd is still considered &#145;the greatest English bowmaker before Tubbs&#146;  (Beare and Kass). His bows &#145;often have ivory frogs with &#147;DODD&#148; stamped on the frog or stick&#146;  (Harvey, 333), although there are also many unauthentic examples with these characteristics. Dodd's later bows made use of all the continental innovations, and his cello bows in particular were favoured among late twentieth-century players. Bows by Edward and John Dodd are in the Hill collection of musical instruments at the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford, and bows by Edward Dodd in the Smithsonian Institution, Washington, DC.<br>

James worked as a bow maker with his father in Lambeth and had two sons, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/45877/', "James Dodd (1792&#150;1865)")</script> and Edward (1797&#150;1851), both of whom continued to work in the family business.<br>
