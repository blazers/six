<span class="headword">Bostock,  John</span>  (1772&#150;1846), <span class="occ">physician and medicinal chemist</span>, was born in Liverpool, the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2940/', "John Bostock (1744?&#150;1774)")</script>, a physician, and Elizabeth (1749&#150;1819), youngest daughter of John Ashton of Liverpool, who later married the Unitarian minister John Yates (1755&#150;1826). He grew up in Liverpool as a member of the town's Unitarian community. In 1792 he attended Joseph Priestley's course of chemical lectures at Hackney College, Middlesex. After returning to Liverpool he studied as an apothecary prior to his move to Edinburgh, in 1794, where he was elected president of the Medical Society. At this time his tutors included Thomas Hope and Joseph Black, joint professors of chemistry, whose lectures were much influenced by H. Lavoisier and J. Dalton. Bostock graduated MD in 1798, having submitted a thesis on bile secretion.<br>
<br>Following graduation Bostock returned to Liverpool, where he became a physician to the General Dispensary. He played key roles in the formation of the botanic gardens, the Fever Hospital, and in 1812 the Liverpool Literary and Philosophical Society. He was also a member of the medical committee of the School for the Blind. Over the next few years Bostock wrote many of the medical and scientific articles for the <span class="italic">Monthly Review</span> and a large number of original papers for the <span class="italic">Edinburgh Medical and Surgical Journal</span>, William Nicholson's <span class="italic">Journal of Natural Philosophy, Chemistry and the Arts</span>, and the <span class="italic">Transactions</span> of the London Medico-Chirurgical Society. An early interest in physiology led to his <span class="italic">Essay on Respiration</span> (1804). This in turn led to a commission to write many medical articles for David Brewster's <span class="italic">Encyclopaedia</span>. Bostock published pamphlets on the new <span class="italic">Edinburgh Pharmacopoeia</span> (1807), and wrote <span class="italic">Remarks on the Nomenclature of the New London Pharmacopoeia</span> (1810), which criticized the basis of its terminology in favour of one based on more structured chemical and botanical terms. This had limited effect. One of the last papers he gave in Liverpool was in 1817, to the Liverpool Literary and Philosophical Society, entitled &#145;The best means of obviating the nuisance arising from the smoke of steam engines&#146;, which showed an early awareness of the serious implications of chemical pollution.<br>
<br>Despite having developed an extensive medical and chemical consulting practice in Liverpool, Bostock moved to London in 1817 and gave up the practice of medicine in favour of a full-time career in science. He succeeded his university contemporary and friend Alexander Marcet as chemical lecturer at Guy's Hospital, and for two years he co-edited the <span class="italic">Annals of Physiology</span>. Later at Guy's he was to work with Richard Bright and Thomas Addison. His works on the chemical composition of body fluids give him a claim to be one of the founders of English chemical pathology. The breadth of his work on normal and pathological urine was unprecedented and he was the first to realize the relationship between the fall of urea in the urine as it &#145;appeared&#146; in the blood, while the albumin in the blood disappeared as its level in urine increased.<br>
<br>However, it is for a short presentation to the London Medico-Chirurgical Society in 1819 that Bostock is best remembered. His &#145;Case of a periodical affection of the eyes and chest&#146;  (<span class="italic">Medico-Chirurgical Transactions</span>, 10, 1819, 161&#150;5) is the first recorded description of what became known as catarrhus aestivus or hay fever. Bostock described how he had personally suffered since childhood from a then unknown affliction. Each year at the beginning of June he developed the symptoms of a cold which lasted for about two months and was associated with profuse nasal discharge, repeated paroxysms of sneezing, itching of the eyes, and difficulty in breathing. He described the unique character of the condition. This description is the more remarkable coming from an ex-dispensary physician who would have been very familiar with a wide range of everyday disease, and it provides compelling evidence for the view that hay fever is a post-industrial-revolution disease, with a major environmental component. In the following nine years he collected details of a further twenty-eight cases, and he published these in <span class="italic">Medico-Chirurgical Transactions</span> in 1828, in an article entitled &#145;On the catarrhus aestivus or summer catarrh&#146;.<br>
<br>During his early years in London, Bostock published <span class="italic">An Account of the History and Present State of Galvanism</span> (1818), and between 1824 and 1827 he produced his three-volume <span class="italic">Elementary System of Physiology</span>, a book which was popular and influential at the time and which had reached a fourth edition by 1844. His interest in chemistry also remained active and in 1829 he published in the <span class="italic">Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society</span> &#145;On the purification of Thames water&#146;, in which he discussed the nature of a number of chemical impurities. In addition, in 1828 he had published an incomplete translation of Pliny's <span class="italic">Natural History</span> and in 1835 he published <span class="italic">A Sketch of the History of Medicine from its Origin to the Commencement of the 19th Century</span>, which formed part of the introduction to John Forbes's journal, the <span class="italic">Cyclopaedia of Practical Medicine</span>. Bostock's widening scientific activity and reputation were reflected in his appointments as council member of the Royal Society (elected in 1829, vice-president in 1832), president of the Geological Society (1826), and treasurer of the Medico-Chirurgical Society of London. In addition he served on the council of the Linnean, Zoological, and Horticultural societies and of the Royal Society of Literature.<br>
<br>Bostock married Anne Yates (<i>d</i>. 1863), with whom he had a daughter, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/52743/', "Elizabeth Anne Bostock (1817&#150;1898)")</script>, who became a promoter of women's education. Bostock died of cholera on 6 August 1846 at his home, 22 Upper Bedford Place, London.<br>
