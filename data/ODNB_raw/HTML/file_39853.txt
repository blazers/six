</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Lee,  Janet <span class="st"> [Jennie]</span></span>, Baroness Lee of Asheridge  (1904&#150;1988), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born on 3 November 1904 in Lochgelly, Fife, the third of four children (the older two of whom died in infancy) and only daughter of James Lee (<i>d</i>. 1951), miner and Independent Labour Party (ILP) activist, and his wife, Euphemia Greig (<i>d</i>. 1962), daughter of a commercial hotel-keeper; and granddaughter of Michael Lee, an Irish Catholic miner and Scottish labour leader. The Labour Party in Scotland was largely the ILP. Jennie's father was a friend of James Maxton, her grandfather a friend of Keir Hardie. The ILP, like the Communist Party, fought to overthrow capitalism; unlike the Communist Party, it chose the parliamentary road. The ILP, with its ardent, militant, and uncompromising far-left politics, rooted in the class struggle fought daily in the Scottish coal fields, was woven into every fragment of the Lee family life.<br>
<br>Jennie, much loved by her parents, unusually was brought up as the son of the family, free of female domestic responsibilities, and free to join her father in his ILP work. (Her easily led younger brother, Tommy, was to emigrate to Australia where after serving in the navy he became dependent on heroin and on Jennie's handouts.) She was educated at Cowdenbeath secondary school, and then obtained local authority and Carnegie grants to train as a teacher at Edinburgh University (one of the few routes to a degree for a working-class girl) where she also studied law, gaining an ordinary MA, her teacher's certificate, and an LLB in 1926. Her first teaching post, at Glencraig School, in the bitter aftermath of the general strike, was unhappy but short-lived. Her upbringing, vividly described in her autobiography <span class="italic">Tomorrow is a New Day</span> (1939)&#151;attending socialist Sunday school, collecting ILP subscriptions, joining great anti-war pacifist rallies, celebrating the 1917 Russian revolution, organizing politically correct lorry deliveries during the general strike&#151;meant that she was always destined for a political life. She was &#145;swept into socialism long before the age of consent&#146;, said a friend, Benn Levy  (Hollis, 10).<h2>
<a name="MPforNorthLanark"></a>MP for North Lanark</h2>By the time Jennie left university, her vivid good looks and passionate evangelical style made her one of the finest platform orators on the Scottish Labour circuit. In July 1928 she was selected for North Lanark, a miners' seat, which she won for the ILP in a by-election in February 1929 (turning a tory majority of 2028 into a Labour majority of 6578), and held at the general election with a reduced majority of 4204 a few weeks later. She was an MP at the age of twenty-four, before she was old enough to vote. She was the youngest woman MP ever elected: gifted, passionate, and quite lovely. Men were besotted by her dark smoky beauty and her arrogant sexuality; women rather less so.<br>
<br>At Westminster Jennie was introduced by James Maxton, befriended by Ellen Wilkinson, mentored by Sir Charles Trevelyan, Labour minister for education; and educated in Hobsonian economics by her lover, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/38704/', "Frank Wise (1885&#150;1933)")</script>, MP for Leicester East, and in the folly of sectarian politics by <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30740/', "Aneurin (Nye) Bevan (1897&#150;1960)")</script>, MP for Ebbw Vale&#151;all of them on the left. Jennie always reduced political issues to class issues, so she was dismissive of feminism, which she thought was a middle-class women's issue, and was reluctant to join the informal all-party group of women MPs led by Nancy Astor. As she told a woman friend (Mrs Suse Saemann), &#145;You are concerned with the problems of humanity; I am concerned with the needs and greeds of my class&#146;  (Hollis, 46).<br>
<br>Instead, as unemployment sharpened, Jennie savaged the policies of her minority Labour government (1929&#150;31), led by Ramsay MacDonald and Philip Snowden, who, as the depression deepened, sought to balance budgets by cutting benefits to the unemployed. The Parliamentary Labour Party sat unhappily but loyally silent while its ILP members berated them for betraying their own class. The poor, said Jennie, were required to save the rich from ruin; they should be demolishing capitalism, not rebuilding it. Along with 230 Labour MPs who refused to join the coalition National Government, she lost her seat in the general election of 1931 (19,691 to 24,384 votes for the national candidate). When finally in July 1932 the ILP refused to bind themselves to official Labour Party discipline, and disaffiliated, Jennie went with them into the wilderness. Her Scottish roots, her ILP beliefs, and her sectarian instincts made her choose opposition. Nye Bevan tried to hold her in the Labour Party&#151;&#145;you Scottish dissenters&#146; would be &#145;pure, but impotent &hellip; My Salvation Army lassie &hellip; I tell you, it is the Labour party or nothing&#146;  (Hollis, 64).<h2>
<a name="CampaigningoutofparliamentthewarandMPforCannock"></a>Campaigning out of parliament, the war, and MP for Cannock</h2>For Jennie, it proved to be nothing. She refought North Lanark for the ILP in the 1935 general election but, faced with an official Labour candidate, failed to regain her seat. For thirteen years she marked time, in politics but out of parliament, lecturing, broadcasting, dabbling in the law, campaigning for international revolutionary socialism, writing for the <span class="italic">New Leader</span>, helping Nye Bevan, Stafford Cripps, William Mellor, and the young Michael Foot to launch <span class="italic">Tribune</span> and the Unity campaign (which became the British expression of the Popular Front) in 1937 to fight fascism; until the Spanish Civil War and then the Second World War weaned her from the pacifism of the ILP and brought her back into mainstream Labour.<br>
<br>In 1940, summoned by Lord Beaverbrook (&#145;You and I were against this bloody war. Now we have to win it for them&#146;), Jennie toured barrage balloon factories (&#145;aerial barbed wire&#146;) for his Ministry of Aircraft Production, urging people to keep working even as the bombs fell  (Hollis, 93&#150;4). When Hitler attacked the Soviet Union she quickly drafted a pamphlet, <span class="italic">Our Ally Russia</span> (1941), demanding greater support for the Russian war effort. Later in 1941 she criss-crossed the USA pressing it to enter the European war. &#145;Don't come back&#146;, said Nye, not entirely joking, &#145;until you have brought America into the War&#146;  (Hollis, 96). In June 1942 she finally resigned from the ILP. She defied the wartime electoral truce (which Nye described as &#145;political blackout&#146;) to stand against the official tory candidate as an independent in the Bristol Central by-election in February 1943, with the backing of Sir Richard Acland's Common Wealth Party and the support of the local vicar, Mervyn Stockwood, and against the bitter opposition of the party she had left, the ILP. She built her campaign around the Beveridge report, published in December 1942, and was expected to win. But on an electoral register depleted by bombing, evacuation, and conscription she lost by 5867 to 4308. In December 1944 she renounced splinter parties and all their works, rejoined the official Labour Party, and in the 1945 general election she won Cannock, a midland mining seat, with a 19,634 majority, a seat she held through many boundary changes until 1970.<h2>
<a name="JennieNyeandtheBevanites"></a>Jennie, Nye, and the Bevanites</h2>The early 1930s had been hard years for Jennie. She had not only lost her parliamentary life&#151;she had also lost the love of her life, Frank Wise: a formidable and worldly man, twenty years older than Jennie, who died in his late forties from a brain haemorrhage in November 1933, leaving a widow and children as well as Jennie to mourn him. Nye Bevan, like Jennie from a mining background, had become a firm friend. (One evening, about to vote, Jennie had said, &#145;You know, Nye, we could be brother and sister.&#146; He: &#145;Mmm&#151;with a tendency to incest&#146;; Hollis, 71.) Jennie, in the deepest depression after Frank's death, was consoled by Nye. He nagged her to marry him, which she did, on the rebound, on 24 October 1934. Together, they made a home at Lane End Cottage, Brimpton Common, in Berkshire; they then in 1944 moved to Cliveden Place in Chelsea, and finally to Asheridge Farm in Chesham, Buckinghamshire. Jennie's much-loved parents moved south to cook, keep house, and offer generous hospitality to their friends, both in the arts and in politics. In turn, their friends financially assisted them to live and travel first class. They developed warm and loyal friendships abroad, with Milovan Djilas in Yugoslavia, and with Jawaharlal Nehru and later Indira Gandhi in India. They had no children. &#145;A litter or none&#146;, said Nye, and Jennie chose none.<br>
<br>Nye was in love with Jennie; Jennie came to love and respect Nye, as during the war and much reviled he maintained a lonely courageous parliamentary opposition to Churchill's politics. The war made their marriage. Following the 1945 election Attlee made Nye minister for health and local government, where he built the National Health Service, the greatest achievement of the Labour government. Although Jennie could expect office on her own behalf, she instead chose to sink her career into Nye's, at considerable personal cost, for she now believed he was Labour's next leader. &#145;He was doing what I wanted done, infinitely better than I could have done it&#146;  (Hollis, 197). Around them clustered the Bevanites (or Tribune group)&#151;Richard Crossman, Barbara Castle, Michael Foot, Harold Wilson, Ian Mikardo, Tom Driberg&#151;acting as a party within a party, seeking to keep Labour true to the socialist faith. In Nye's battles with Hugh Gaitskell during the 1950s, Jennie was seen as Nye's &#145;dark angel&#146;, his Lady Macbeth, always pulling him away from compromise and the centre and, true to her ILP roots, into confrontation, resignation&#151;and opposition.<br>
<br>Jennie had sound physical health, although occasionally she suffered prolonged spells of depression; Nye was mentally immensely strong but his early years in the pits, together with his hard drinking, physically scarred him. His death from cancer on 6 July 1960 stunned the nation. Jennie was desolate, turned to drink, and withdrew from public life. Her glossy black hair turned silver; her health broke. She was lovingly cared for by her cousin Bettina Stafford, who moved from Scotland with her husband, Bill, and their small boy, Vincent, whom Jennie adopted as her surrogate son.<h2>
<a name="MinisterfortheartstheOpenUniversity"></a>Minister for the arts, the Open University</h2>Jennie was rescued by Harold Wilson, who on Nye's and then (in January 1963) Gaitskell's premature deaths had become leader of the Labour Party. Following the 1964 general election he offered her a junior job. She refused health&#151;a &#145;wreath for Nye&#146;&#151;so was given a loose responsibility for the arts, and was parked temporarily as a parliamentary secretary at the Ministry of Public Building and Works (1964&#150;5), then moved to Anthony Crosland's Department of Education and Science, before becoming minister of state from 1967 to 1970. Her departmental colleagues and her senior civil servants despaired of her <i>grande dame</i> intransigent style; she in turn was deeply distrustful of the mandarins she thought were out to thwart her. She never learned to be a &#145;good&#146; minister; but with the help of Arnold Goodman (whom she appointed to chair the Arts Council) she became the first and possibly the finest minister for the arts. All subsequent arts ministers were judged against her, and all failed.<br>
<br>Before Jennie, the arts were the &#145;high culture&#146; of the &eacute;lite&#151;metropolitan, upper class, the leisure pursuit of the Oxbridge <i>cognoscenti</i> and the male connoisseur. Jennie insisted that the labour movement was entitled to &#145;bread and roses&#146;. Her February 1965 white paper, <span class="italic">A Policy for the Arts, the First Steps</span>, stated that the arts could become accessible&#151;diffused to the regions, to young people, to the trades unions, to the unemployed&#151;without diluting their excellence. The best for the most. For Jennie it was simple; the arts were life-enhancing. They also represented sound politics and sound business. At a time of stringent government finance, she trebled the Arts Council grant from &pound;3.2 million to &pound;9.4 million in her six years; and while generously funding the great London flagship companies, of opera, theatre, ballet, orchestras, museums, and galleries, and sorting the new South Bank complex, she also supported artists outside London by building their audiences, purchasing their paintings, subsidizing their small poetry magazines, starting a National Film School, and housing the arts in dozens of new theatres and community arts centres across the land. She was much loved. When she went to the theatre, the audience rose to applaud her.<br>
<br>The other task Wilson entrusted to Jennie reflected his own enthusiasm for educational technology&#151;to deliver a university of the air (or open university) offering distance learning to those who were immobile, tied by work, marriage, children, or disabilities to studying from home. She faced widespread opposition&#151;from universities, old and new, who insisted (as with the arts) that open access was incompatible with academic excellence; from the adult education movement who argued that the greater educational need lay with remedial adult education; from the Labour left who wanted a working-class and not an open university (which might attract &#145;mere housewives&#146;); from her cabinet colleagues who saw it as biting into their budgets; and from the tory right who thought it a costly irrelevance, which they would abolish if they won the next general election. But with Wilson's support, and Goodman's skills, she drove it through. A budget was agreed in July 1967. Walter Perry was appointed its vice-chancellor in May 1968, persuaded Margaret Thatcher in 1970 to back him, and accepted the first students for January 1971. By 1984 it was Britain's largest university, with 100,000 students. Wilson subsequently claimed that the Open University was the greatest achievement of his government.<br>
<br>On the way Jennie had collected admirers, and distinctions. She was sworn of the privy council in 1966, elected chairman of the Labour Party in 1967, awarded an honorary LLD from Cambridge in 1974, and became an honorary fellow of the Royal Academy in 1981. She republished Nye's <span class="italic">In Place of Fear</span> with an elegiac introduction of her own. She helped Michael Foot with his biography of Aneurin Bevan. However, she neglected her Cannock seat, which remained deeply suspicious of her work for the arts (too London, too toff). In the general election of 1970 her Labour majority of 11,000 became a Conservative majority of 1500. The swing against her was 11 per cent, double the national average and the highest in the country.<br>
<br>Wilson again rescued Jennie from depression and oblivion by appointing her to the Lords later in 1970, where she enjoyed a golden decade, f&ecirc;ted in the house and offering generous hospitality in her elegant Chelsea home, 67 Chester Row. In 1980 she completed her memoirs, <span class="italic">My Life with Nye</span>. From then on, she aged rapidly. Troubled by bad health&#151;fractures, cataracts, ulcers, and breast cancer&#151;she was increasingly confined to her home. She died of pneumonia at her home on 16 November 1988, her faithful cousin Bettina by her side. On 28 November her ashes joined Nye's, scattered on the Welsh hillside above Tredegar, Monmouthshire.<br>
