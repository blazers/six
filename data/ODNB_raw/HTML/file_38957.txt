<span class="headword">Glasgow Boys</span>  (<em>act. </em>1875&#150;1895)<span class="occ"></span> was the name adopted by a group of twenty or so young artists associated with new developments in painting in Glasgow who were more formally known as the Glasgow school of painters. The majority of these painters came from Glasgow and the west of Scotland, but some were from Edinburgh and the east coast, and one, <a href="#cosubject_38946">Joseph Crawhall [<i>see below</i>]</a>, was English. What drew them together was a shared admiration for James McNeill Whistler, the naturalist paintings of Jules Bastien-Lepage, a shared objection to the tired genre and history painting of many Glasgow-based painters (whom the Boys dubbed &#145;The Gluepots&#146;), a strong sense of ambition, and a shared aim of dismantling the stranglehold of Edinburgh and its Royal Scottish Academy over artistic life in Scotland.<br>
<br>The Boys first appeared as a coherent force in Scottish painting at the annual exhibition of the Glasgow Institute of the Fine Arts in 1885. They never spoke with one voice and they drew upon three distinct branches of adherents. The first group comprised <a name="cosubject_76470"></a><span class="headword">William York MacGregor</span>  (1855&#150;1923)<span class="occ"></span> and his friend <a href="#cosubject_64528">James Paterson [<i>see below</i>]</a>, who painted together from the mid-1870s. Macgregor was born in Finnart, Dunbartonshire, in September 1855, the son of John MacGregor, a shipbuilder, and his wife, Margaret, <i>n&eacute;e</i> York. He studied painting as a pupil of James Docharty in Glasgow and then at the Slade School of Fine Art, London, under Alphonse Legros. This more formal training, combined with his private means and a certain <i>gravitas</i> in his manner, gave him the sobriquet &#145;Father of the School&#146;, but in artistic terms he was eclipsed by the events of 1885 and took only a minor role in later years. He was crippled by asthma, and left Glasgow for the cleaner air of Bridge of Allan in 1886 as well as visiting South Africa in 1888 in the hope of a cure. On 30 April 1918 he married Jessie Watson, a nurse, and they lived at Albyn Lodge, Bridge of Allan, Stirlingshire. He died on 28 September 1923 at the Great Western Hotel, Oban, and was buried at Logie, near Bridge of Allan. His friend Paterson wrote that &#145;he relished a good sermon, loved savoury food, drank little or nothing, smoked fine cigars &hellip; [was] an omnivorous reader, keenly interested in classical music &hellip; always shy with women, [with] a cordial contempt for &#147;Swells&#148;&#146;  (Paterson).<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_64528"></a><span class="headword">James Paterson</span>  (1854&#150;1932)<span class="occ"></span> was born on 21 August 1854 in Hillhead, Glasgow, the son of Andrew Paterson, a cotton and muslin manufacturer, and Margaret Hunter. He studied at Glasgow School of Art from 1871 to 1874 and then with various masters in Paris, including Jacquesson de la Chevreuse (1877&#150;9) and Jean Paul Laurens (1879&#150;83). On 24 April 1884 he married Eliza Grier Ferguson (<i>b</i>. 1856/7) and settled in Moniaive, Dumfriesshire, thus removing himself from the centre of the artistic developments in Glasgow post-1885, although he was deeply involved in the launch and production of the <span class="italic">Scottish Art Review</span> from 1888 to 1890. He became a member of most of the artistic bodies in Scotland (Royal Scottish Society of Painters in Watercolour, 1885; associate member of the Royal Scottish Academy, 1896; full member of the Royal Scottish Academy, 1910; president of the Royal Scottish Society of Painters in Watercolour, 1922&#150;32). He died on 25 January 1932 at 12 Randolph Crescent, Edinburgh, and was buried there in Dean cemetery.<br>
<br>Paterson and MacGregor met at school and from 1877 to 1883 they painted together, mainly on the east coast of Scotland. MacGregor's pursuit of the tonal values found in the more consistent light of the east of Scotland, his honesty of technique, and Paterson's French training all combined to lead them towards the naturalism of Bastien-Lepage. Landscape watercolours became Paterson's forte, painted <i>en plein air</i>, for example <span class="italic">Moniaive</span> (1885; Hunterian Art Gallery, University of Glasgow), while MacGregor concentrated on both landscape and pictures of contemporary life, such as <span class="italic">Crail</span> (1883; Smith Art Gallery, Stirling) and his masterpiece <span class="italic">The Vegetable Stall</span> (1883&#150;4; National Galleries of Scotland, Edinburgh), a painting which he substantially altered after seeing the works of James Guthrie and John Lavery in 1885 and which he never exhibited publicly. MacGregor's private income enabled him to run a large studio in Glasgow, where he entertained many of his colleagues in the early 1880s and where many of the group's ideas and beliefs were honed, but any artistic leadership MacGregor offered waned after 1885.<br>
<br>The second group consisted of painters who made more sustained visits to France, particularly to Grez-sur-Loing, an artists' colony where many followers of naturalism congregated. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/34425/', "John Lavery (1856&#150;1941)")</script> was the most important of these, but others such as Thomas Millie Dow (1848&#150;1919) and <a name="cosubject_65397"></a><span class="headword">William Kennedy</span>  (1859&#150;1918)<span class="occ"></span> joined him. Kennedy was born on 17 July 1859 at 89 Hospital Street, Glasgow, the son of John Kennedy, master baker, and his wife, Lillian, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Shedden. He studied at Paisley School of Art and possibly also at Glasgow School of Art, probably at the evening classes. From 1880 to 1885 he spent much of his time in France, studying in Paris under William-Adolphe Bouguereau and A. F. Fleury and later working with Bastien-Lepage, L. J. R. Collin, and Gustave Courtois. By 1884 he was painting in a proficient naturalist manner, as in, for example, <span class="italic">Spring</span> (1884; Paisley Museum and Art Gallery), and making drawings and taking photographs of French peasants at work in the fields, which were later translated into paintings. On his return to Scotland he settled near Stirling, where he was attracted by the army camps in Queen's Park. For the rest of his life the daily routine of the military, not its grand set-piece pageants, became his principal subject matter, painted in a much more immediate and colourful manner than his earlier naturalist paintings. Examples include <span class="italic">In the Cooking Trenches</span>, <span class="italic">Waiting to Mount Guard</span>, <span class="italic">The Canteen&#151;Mid-Day</span>, all exhibited at the Glasgow Institute of the Fine Arts in the 1890s. Although never so united in drawing up a constitution as the contemporary New English Art Club in London, the Glasgow Boys, when they did toy with a formal association around 1887, proposed Kennedy as president. The venture was short-lived, however, and never had any real meaning in the development of the school. On 21 September 1898 Kennedy married Helena Fife Scott (Lena) (<i>b</i>. 1867/8), also a painter, and soon they began to pay extensive visits to Berkshire, where Kennedy underwent a change of style and subject matter, much influenced by the rural charm of its gentle villages. Kennedy's health caused him to settle in 1912 in Tangier, where Lavery had a house and where he died on 11 December 1918. He was buried in the British section of Tangier cemetery.<br>
<br>Many of the key naturalist works of the school were painted by the three members of the third group, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/33613/', "James Guthrie (1859&#150;1930)")</script>, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/38954/', "Edward Arthur Walton (1860&#150;1922)")</script>, and <a name="cosubject_38946"></a><span class="headword">Joseph Crawhall</span> <span class="st"> [<em>known as </em>Joseph Crawhall the third]</span>  (1861&#150;1913)<span class="occ"></span>. Guthrie and Walton painted together from the late 1870s, developing a strong interest in Bastien-Lepage's work, which they encountered not just at the Glasgow Institute but also in a series of exhibitions in London in 1882 and 1883. Bastien-Lepage strongly recommended that a painter become part of a local community, as he had at Damvillers, painting its daily life without resorting to the great set pieces which formed so many of the exhibits at the Paris Salon and its British equivalents. Peasants in the fields and tradesmen in the street seen going about their daily tasks became Bastien-Lepage's standard subject matter, which he painted without the symbolism with which Jean-Fran&ccedil;ois Millet had imbued his similar paintings a generation before. The Scots took to spending summers in single locations in emulation of Bastien-Lepage, such as Crowland, Lincolnshire, and Cockburnspath, Berwickshire (where Guthrie lived and worked for almost three years, 1883&#150;5). Their paintings of these rural locations were seen to best advantage in 1885 at the Glasgow Institute and they were recognized as the virtual leaders of an identifiable new school. Crawhall was related to Walton through marriage and began to paint alongside him and Guthrie from about 1879. He was born on 20 August 1861 at Wansbeck House, Newgate Street, Morpeth, Northumberland, the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/64725/', "Joseph Crawhall (1821&#150;1896)")</script>, a wood-engraver and arts promoter, and his wife, Margaret, formerly Boyd (<i>c</i>.1833&#150;1928). The young Crawhall attended King's College School in London from 1877 to 1879 but he had no formal art training other than two months in the studio of Aim&eacute;e Morot in Paris in 1882. He developed his own natural and considerable talents through the example of both Guthrie and Walton, who had each received a varied formal training. He became one of the most accomplished watercolourists of his generation, specializing in horses, birds, and other animals, in preference to purely figurative subjects. A close friend of Lavery, he spent much of his time from 1884 to 1893 in Morocco, where many of his best watercolours were produced. The Glasgow shipowner and collector William Burrell became his chief patron, acquiring over 140 of his pictures, including masterpieces such as <span class="italic">The Aviary, Clifton</span> (1888) and <span class="italic">The Flower Shop</span>. From 1907 he lived in Yorkshire and died at 92 Redcliffe Gardens, South Kensington, London, on 24 May 1913, following an operation for emphysema. He was buried at St Mary's, Morpeth.<br>
<br>
<script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/34983/', "Arthur Melville (1855&#150;1904)")</script> was another outsider, born and brought up in the east of Scotland, but at an early stage in his career he left Edinburgh to study in the ateliers of Paris, where he adopted the pursuit of tonal values which became an integral part of the style of the Glasgow Boys. He also visited Grez-sur-Loing but then travelled on through Spain and Morocco to the Middle East. His earlier, more naturalist works had a considerable influence on Guthrie, Walton, Lavery, and Crawhall but his watercolours of Spain and of Arab life (for example, <span class="italic">A Mediterranean Port</span>, 1892; Glasgow Museums and Art Galleries), with their strong colours and bold technique, had a greater appeal to a younger generation of painters associated with the Boys, particularly <a href="#cosubject_38956">George Henry</a> and <a href="#cosubject_38957">Edward Atkinson Hornel [<i>see below</i>]</a>.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_38956"></a><span class="headword">George Henry</span>  (1858&#150;1943)<span class="occ"></span> was born on 14 March 1858 at Irvine, Ayrshire, the son of William Hendry, brewer, and his wife, Ann, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Fisher. Though his name was recorded at his birth as Hendry, he used the name Henry. Hardly anything is known of his early life. By the early 1880s he was employed as a clerk in Glasgow but he also enrolled for classes at Glasgow School of Art in 1882 and 1883. He was working at Brig o'Turk in 1882, probably alongside Guthrie and Walton, and his early works show a clear interest in tonal values and are much influenced by the work of the older men. When Guthrie settled in Cockburnspath in 1883 Henry joined him and rapidly adopted a naturalist manner. It was probably in Cockburnspath that he met Arthur Melville, whose use of strong, clear colour was to divert Henry away from naturalism. He showed a fascination with the symbolic use of colour and with his friend Hornel began to experiment with looser and more emotional compositions. This culminated in <span class="italic">The Galloway Landscape</span> (1889; Glasgow Museums and Art Galleries), a painting which seems to owe much to the Pont-Aven painters centred on Paul Gauguin. Henry was certainly in France in the late 1880s and Scottish painters such as Charles Mackie were in touch with Gauguin. An interest in Japan and <i>japonaiserie</i> took over, however, encouraged by Hornel, and in 1893 Henry travelled with Hornel to Japan, where he stayed for eighteen months. By the time he returned to Glasgow many of the Boys had left the city and Henry followed several of them to London, where he established himself as a successful portrait and landscape painter. He died on 23 December 1943 at 132 Fulham Road, London, and was buried in Cathcart cemetery, Glasgow.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_38957"></a><span class="headword">Edward Atkinson Hornel</span>  (1864&#150;1933)<span class="occ"></span> was born on 17 July 1864 at Bacchus Marsh, Australia, the son of William Lidderdale Hornel (<i>b</i>. 1822), a bootmaker, and Ann Elizabeth Habbishaw (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1832), who had recently emigrated there from Kirkcudbright. The family returned to Kirkcudbright in 1866 and Hornel made the town his home for the rest of his life. He studied at the Trustees' Academy, Edinburgh (1880&#150;83), and then at the Acad&eacute;mie Royale des Beaux Arts in Antwerp under Charles Verlat (1883&#150;5). He appears to have met Guthrie, who was visiting Kirkcudbright, in 1885 and almost immediately adopted a naturalist manner in his painting. Guthrie may have introduced him to Henry but however they met, the two became close friends, sharing ideas and even canvases for the next decade. Hornel was keenly interested in folklore and local history, which began to appear in his paintings in a change of subject matter, rural peasantry giving way to druids, as in <span class="italic">The Druids: Bringing Home the Mistletoe</span> (1890, with George Henry; Glasgow Museums and Art Galleries), and goblins. Melville's intense colours were a profound influence but the heavily worked impastoed surface of his paintings was a unique aspect of Glasgow school painting. His fascination with Japan, inspired by J. A. M. Whistler, was reflected in the changing subject matter of his paintings. The Galloway milkmaids were now dressed in kimonos and chased butterflies with silk bandannas (for example <span class="italic">Midsummer</span>, 1892; Walker Art Gallery, Liverpool). Eventually, aided by funds from William Burrell and Alexander Reid, Hornel set out with Henry to visit Japan. His Japanese paintings are more a record of life in Japan than an assimilation of Japanese art; their bright colours and sometimes crude impasto seem the antithesis of Japanese art. Hornel remained in Kirkcudbright, refusing to move to London, and certainly not to Edinburgh (he refused membership of the Royal Scottish Academy in 1901). His later paintings concentrate on a repetitive formula (sustained by the use of photographs) of groups of young girls playing in bluebell woods or on the shores of the Solway Firth. They were extremely successful and he was able to afford the life of a country gentleman, indulging his interests in foreign travel and rare books. He died, unmarried, on 30 June 1933 at his home, Broughton House, 12 High Street, Kirkcudbright.<br>
<br>The exhibition at the Glasgow Institute in 1885 brought together all of the different aspects of the Glasgow school, and the painters were recognized as having common aims (the sobriquet Glasgow Boys was preferred by the artists themselves as they found the use of the term Glasgow school pretentious and stuffy). Just as soon as they came together, however, they began to drift apart. By the time their work was shown at the Grosvenor Gallery, London, in 1890 several of the artists had left Glasgow or were busy developing new styles. Their exhibition was the final show at the Grosvenor Gallery and so attracted much press attention. This in turn caught the eyes of several of the new exhibiting bodies in Europe, principally secessionist, where naturalism was becoming accepted as a logical compromise between academic painting and the avant-garde work of the Impressionists. The Grosvenor Gallery exhibition was taken to Munich and from there the Boys began to exhibit throughout Europe and beyond&#151;Berlin, Vienna, Venice, Rome, Barcelona, Budapest, Turin, Moscow, St Petersburg&#151;and then in America&#151;in Pittsburgh, St Louis, Chicago, Cincinnati, and New York. The Boys also began individually to send their work to the Paris Salon and similar institutions in Europe. Gradually they were assimilated into the establishment which they had railed against in 1880.<br>
<br>There were other naturalist movements in Britain, principally in Newlyn, Cornwall, but most of these painters were simply dressing up high Victorian sentimentality in modernistic clothes (as, of course, was John Lavery). Guthrie, Henry, Walton, Paterson, and Kennedy (and several other artists associated with the Boys) more fully understood the motives and aspirations of Bastien-Lepage. Their paintings were by no means social realism on the scale of Courbet, but they painted everyday life in its uneventfulness, without social or political comment and without trivializing the sometimes mean existences of their subjects. In this they echoed the work of Sir George Clausen and his circle in London and East Anglia, but their achievement was more than just pictorial or artistic. In 1875 the visual arts in Scotland were dominated by the Royal Scottish Academy and social institutions such as Glasgow Art Club. The Boys were ambitious enough to want to join these bodies, but not on the terms laid down to them: &#145;paint as we do, don't rock the boat&#146;. The academy even went so far as to exclude from membership any artist who did not take up residence in Edinburgh. By 1890 the Boys had broken all of these barriers and had shown that Glasgow was a major artistic centre, which had been concealed by the <i>status quo</i> of the academy for fifty years. Glasgow could not, however, sustain the Boys, or at least not satisfy their growing success, and gradually they left, usually retaining some formal link with the city such as teaching at the Glasgow School of Art or retaining a portrait practice there. They brought Glasgow to national and international attention, extended the boundaries of contemporary British painting, and gave an encouraging example to the coming generations of young Scottish painters such as the Scottish colourists. More immediately, their fame within the European Secessionist movement eased the path of Charles Rennie Mackintosh and his contemporaries, who began to exhibit in Europe in the late 1890s. Their star waned after 1918 and by the 1950s their paintings had been consigned to the basements of museums before being reappraised by a new generation of art historians and curators who recognized the power of the contribution they had made.<br>
