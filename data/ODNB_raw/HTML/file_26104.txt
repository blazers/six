</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Spelman, Sir  Henry</span>  (1563/4&#150;1641), <span class="occ">historian and antiquary</span>, was born at Congham, near King's Lynn, Norfolk, the eldest son of Henry Spelman (<i>d</i>. 1581) of Congham and his second wife, Frances (<i>d</i>. 1622), daughter of William Saunders of Ewell, Surrey. He was educated at Walsingham grammar school, where later tradition had it that he was a poor student. Spelman was admitted to Trinity College, Cambridge, on 15 September 1580; he matriculated in his seventeenth year on 17 March 1581 at Trinity College, Cambridge, and graduated BA in 1583, despite the interruption to his studies caused by the death of his father in October 1581. He then went to Furnival's Inn, and entered Lincoln's Inn on 14 May 1586 &#145;with a design of studying the law, but disliking the drudgery necessary for attaining to the lucrative part of the profession he applied himself to the history and antiquities of his native land&#146;  (Mirrlees, 147). Thus it was about this time that he helped to found the Society of Antiquaries, to which he delivered several extant papers on such topics as the state of the kingdom's coinage. It was through the society that Spelman made the acquaintance of other devoted antiquaries, including Sir Robert Bruce Cotton, first baronet.<h2>
<a name="Norfolk15901612"></a>Norfolk, 1590&#150;1612</h2>After three years at Lincoln's Inn Spelman returned to Norfolk and on 18 April 1590 he married Eleanor (<i>d</i>. 1620), daughter and coheir of John L'Estrange of Sedgeford, Norfolk. They had four sons, two of whom predeceased him, and four daughters: <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26106/', "Sir John Spelman (1594&#150;1643)")</script>, the eldest son, was a royalist author, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26102/', "Clement Spelman (bap. 1598, d. 1679)")</script> was cursitor baron of the exchequer. Most of his wife's inheritance remained with her mother, who married Richard Stubbe, but Spelman secured the wardship of Hamon L'Estrange, son of Sir Nicholas L'Estrange (<i>d</i>. 1591), his wife's cousin. This allowed him to live at the L'Estrange property of Hunstanton, Norfolk; its proximity to Castle Rising probably explains his return to parliament for that borough in 1593 and 1597. It was during Spelman's sojourn in Norfolk as a country gentleman that he wrote what may have been his first work, &#145;Aspilogia&#146;, a Latin treatise on coats of armour, which, although probably written before 1595, remained unpublished until 1654. His 1604 tract, &#145;Of the union&#146;, declared support for the general principle of union, but was opposed to proposals which sought a more perfect union through free trade, mutual naturalization, and a common legal system. Spelman was knighted in 1604 and served as sheriff of Norfolk from November 1604 until February 1606 and as justice of the peace until 1616. He transcribed many of the deeds and charters relating to Norfolk and Suffolk monasteries and, according to Thomas Hearne, he wrote the description of Norfolk printed in John Speed's <span class="italic">Theatre of the Empire of Great Britain</span> (1611).<br>
<br>In 1594 Spelman's purchases of the leases of Blackborough and Wormegay abbeys from the crown lessees caused him to be involved in extensive litigation in chancery, which was not settled until 1625 by the lord keeper, Sir Thomas Coventry. When Sir Francis Bacon heard the case, he found against Spelman, which perhaps explains his involvement in petitioning parliament against the lord chancellor. It was in his unhappy tribulations over these former church properties that Spelman &#145;first discerned the infelicity of meddling with consecrated places&#146;  (H. Spelman, <span class="italic">The History and Fate of Sacrilege</span>, 1853, 247). He was still collecting material on the punishment meted out to those committing sacrilege in 1633, but his work, <span class="italic">The History and Fate of Sacrilege</span>, although sent to the printers in 1663, was delayed in the press and temporarily lost during the fire of London. It was subsequently recovered by Edmund Gibson, but remained unpublished until 1698.<h2>
<a name="London16121630"></a>London, 1612&#150;1630</h2>The end of Hamon L'Estrange's minority presumably coincided with Spelman's decision in 1612 to move his permanent residence to Tothill Street in London. Within a year of his arrival in the capital he had completed and published <span class="italic">De non temerandis ecclesiis: a Tract of the Rights and Respect due unto the Churches</span> (1613), which, according to the title, was written to &#145;a gentleman [his maternal uncle, Francis Saunders], who, having an appropriate parsonage, employed the church to profane uses, and left the parishioners uncertainly provided of Divine service in a parish near there adjoining&#146;. Spelman had collected numerous cases showing that ill fates awaited those who enjoyed church property; his examples, as presented by his son Clement in the epistle to the reader with which he prefaced the third edition of 1646, included three of William I's children, and the disappearance of King John's plunder from Peterborough and Crowland abbeys, which were lost in quicksand. The book's advocacy was sufficiently powerful, according to Bishop Gibson, to ensure a steady stream of converts willing to return their impropriations to the church. It also helped to stimulate John Selden's response, <span class="italic">The Historie of Tithes</span> (1618), which refuted the contention that tithes were justified by both history and constant usage.<br>
<br>On 2 March 1617 Spelman was named a commissioner to determine unsettled titles to lands and manors in Ireland, business which necessitated three visits to Ireland. In July 1620 he had to recover from the death of his wife, a son, and a grandson all within the space of nine days. That year he became a member of the New England Company, an association which was to last until 1635 and which saw him heavily involved in the legal battles with the rival Virginia Company. In July 1621 the archbishop of Canterbury, George Abbot, accidentally shot and killed a park-keeper with a cross-bow while hunting. Perhaps in response to a request from the resultant commission charged with investigating whether the archbishop was now capable of carrying on his archiepiscopal duties, Spelman undertook an analysis of the case. His views appeared in &#145;An answer to the foregoing apology&#146;, which as the title suggests was a reply to &#145;A short apology for Archbishop Abbot&#146;. Spelman was critical of Abbot, noting that as he had intended to kill a deer, the death of the keeper was not truly accidental, and dismissing the argument that Abbot was merely hunting for his health. In finding Abbot's conduct irregular he lined up with bishops Williams and Laud, who refused to accept consecration from Abbot.<br>
<br>Following the agitation in the parliament of 1621 over the reform of the courts of justice, in October 1622 James I appointed a commission to investigate the fees taken in both civil and ecclesiastical courts since 1588. Spelman was an assistant to the privy councillors named in the commission, but he shouldered most of the immediate administrative burden. When the commission was renewed in March 1623 Spelman was named a commissioner, and he became a mainstay of that and the other commissions appointed in 1627, 1630, 1634, and 1637. He wrote most of the reports to the king and council, including &#145;Considerations touching the suppression of unjust fees&#146; in 1630, and attended as many as ninety meetings a year. In 1625 he was elected to parliament for Worcester, but he relinquished his seat to his son John at the election held in the following year. Indeed by 1628 Spelman was writing to Archbishop James Ussher of Armagh, &#145;I am no parliament man&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 25384, fol. 15).<br>
<br>Spelman's antiquarian labour increased during his residence in London, where he was part of a community of scholars such as John Selden and Sir Robert Cotton, and where he had the use of Cotton's magnificent library located in Westminster. His study of both the common law and the church forced him to confront the problem of the meaning and definition of the terms used in the past, especially Anglo-Saxon and Latin terms. With the encouragement of foreign scholars, such as Peiresc, to whom he submitted samples of his work, in 1626 he published <span class="italic">Archaeologus</span> (which covered the letters A&#150;L). This was the first part of his glossary of &#145;obsolete and barbaric words in the ecclesiastical and legal vocabularies&#146;  (Pocock, 93). It encompassed the study of the usages, offices, ranks, ceremonies, and rules in the medieval church and law in the context of the words used in Europe. However, he had to bear the full cost of its publication.<br>
<br>In June 1627 Spelman was appointed by letters patent to the Guiana Company and elected as its treasurer. That same year he completed his <span class="italic">Codex legum veterum</span>. This work studied the origins of feudalism, in that it discussed the Norman introduction of feudal tenures, while also supporting the traditional view that the Normans had confirmed the laws already in being in Anglo-Saxon England. Spelman designed to publish this material in 1640, possibly as an antidote to the more extreme claims of those who saw parliament's rights as existing from time immemorial. Such a theme ran through his unpublished &#145;Of parliaments&#146;, which was written after &#145;having seen more parliaments miscarry, yea suffer, shipwreck, within these sixteen years past, than in many hundred heretofore&#146; (probably therefore written about 1630), and &#145;The original, growth, propagation and condition of feuds and tenures by knight-service in England&#146;, which found its way into print in <span class="italic">Reliquiae Spelmannianae</span>.<h2>
<a name="Finalyears16301641"></a>Final years, 1630&#150;1641</h2>Simonds D'Ewes described Spelman in 1630 as &#145;a learned and studious gentleman, now very aged and almost blind&#146;  (Cooper, 106), but John Aubrey was less sure of his physical decline, recording a contemporary opinion that he &#145;wore always his sword till he was about 70 or more&#146;  (<span class="italic">Brief Lives</span>, 2.231). In any case Spelman spent most of the 1630s working on another large project, a plan to document all the church councils held in Britain or attended by British representatives. This would show the development of the church in all its facets since Roman times. Assisted by Jeremy Stephens and his own son John Spelman, he published part 1 of the work in 1639 as <span class="italic">Concilia</span>. It covered the period before 1066 and was used in evidence before the House of Commons in 1641 to argue against the sole jurisdiction of the bishops.<br>
<br>In January 1632 Spelman was described by the Norfolk justices in a letter to the privy council as &#145;a grave person, well knowing the state of their country and well known to their lordships&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1631&#150;3</i>, 258). In November 1636 he was granted &pound;300 by the king in recognition of his extraordinary &#145;labour and pains taken by him on sundry occasions in his majesty's service&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1636&#150;7</i>, 210). About February 1638 he declined the offer of the mastership of Sutton's Hospital, Charterhouse, preferring to solicit the place for his son John.<br>
<br>Spelman maintained his contact with Cambridge University and began discussions at some point around 1635 concerning the endowment of a chair in Anglo-Saxon. This was established by 1640 when Abraham Wheelock was professor, although the chair lapsed with his death in 1657. Spelman's scholarly reputation may explain his candidature, at such an advanced age, for the university in the elections to the Long Parliament, when he was defeated. His supporters included some youthful Laudians, attracted no doubt by his works on the church, although it is doubtful if Spelman himself could be characterized as such. The last work published by him before his death appeared in 1641: <span class="italic">De sepultura</span> was a result of his appointment to the commission of 1627 into the taking of exorbitant fees.<h2>
<a name="Deathandreputation"></a>Death and reputation</h2>On 8 October 1641 Spelman's assistant, John Walden, reported that his master had died on 1 October 1641 at the house in the Barbican of his daughter and her husband, Sir Ralph Whitfield. Walden recorded that Spelman was to be buried on the 14th in Westminster Abbey, although the printed registers indicate that interment took place on the 24th.<br>
<br>Much of Spelman's work remained unpublished at his death. As well as assisting with <span class="italic">Concilia</span>, Jeremy Stephens helped other of Spelman's later endeavours. Stephens saw to the publication of <span class="italic">Tithes too Hot to be Touched</span> in 1646, republished the following year as <span class="italic">The Larger Treatise on Tithes</span>. Another antiquary, William Dugdale, whom he met in 1638, was responsible for the publication after the Restoration of the remainder of the glossary. In 1694 Edmund Gibson gained possession of five bundles of Spelman's papers, which, together with those preserved in the library of Sir Charles Spelman, formed the basis of Gibson's <span class="italic">Reliquiae Spelmannianae</span>, published in 1698.<br>
<br>Spelman was known by contemporaries as a scholar and antiquary. His subsequent reputation has been enhanced by the knowledge that his determination to comprehend fully English institutions laid the groundwork for future methodology and understanding. In particular, he managed to link separate pieces of evidence together in order to explain the development of feudalism, rather than merely accumulate and present a series of unrelated facts. For many historians his comparative work on the language and terms of northern Europe led to the &#145;discovery&#146; that feudalism developed as a consequence of the Norman conquest, and that English institutions had not existed from time immemorial.<br>
