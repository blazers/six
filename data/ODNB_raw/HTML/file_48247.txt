<span class="headword">Ford,  Charles Bell</span>  (1784&#150;1860), <span class="occ">insurance company manager</span>, was baptized on 24 May 1784 at Pitcombe, Somerset, the ninth child of John Ford, barrister of the Middle Temple, and Margaret Ford. His father was a man of considerable means, a benefactor of charities in Bath and probably a director of Bath Fire Office. His brothers, John and William, went up to Oxford and followed their father into the Middle Temple. However, nothing is known of Charles's early career. He was appointed secretary to the Sun Fire Office in 1814 at the age of thirty. Unlike most of Sun's salaried officers, he had not come up through the ranks of clerical staff, nor, like previous secretaries, did he belong to the closed circle of existing managers. He was brought in to fill the vacancy left by the death of Philip Bewicke only after no internal volunteer for the onerous post of secretary could be found. One of the terms of his appointment, and what marked him as an outsider, was that he had to relinquish his seat on Sun's self-electing management committee if he gave up the post of secretary. Although Ford never married, his family did in time become &#145;insiders&#146;: his nephew Harry, son of his sister Eliza and Sir Robert Chester, was a Sun manager from 1835 to 1868.<br>
<br>At the time of Ford's appointment, Sun was the largest fire insurer in Britain, but had entered a difficult stage in its history. The new offices of the 1800s had eroded its market share, particularly in the north of England. One of Ford's principal achievements was to reverse this decline, so that the office continued to dominate British fire insurance long after his death. Ford proved ruthless in pursuit of market power. Particularly during the period of intensified competition in the late 1820s and 1830s, he undercut the premium rates of weaker opposition in a range of markets, and forced the other major offices to follow suit. The company take-over, however, proved to be his most potent device for maintaining Sun's competitive position. In seventeen successful take-overs during his term as secretary, including an extraordinary average of one each year between 1835 and 1848, he revealed himself as a great tactician, and a shrewd and tough negotiator. He would keep a close eye on the movements of his competitors, would carefully gauge the probability of persuading a majority of shareholders to sell, and would make great efforts to win the loyalty, sometimes through financial enticements, of a key insider&#151;a director or manager&#151;in the company targeted for purchase. In three, ultimately successful, attempts to buy the Bath Fire Office, Ford even recruited his father, his elder sister, and the family physician, all resident in Bath, to collect information and canvas support on Sun's behalf.<br>
<br>To his counterparts in other insurance offices, Ford could seem somewhat cold and aloof. He had a rather caustic sense of humour and did not tolerate fools gladly, but he clearly had a taste for the corporate battlefield, as well as a sense of fairness. A late convert to the cause of co-operation between insurers, he drafted the plan of the London Fire Engine Establishment in 1833, and he was the regular chairman of the Fire Offices' tariff committee from 1842. In 1836 he rather belatedly took Sun into foreign underwriting. The frequent generous bonuses awarded to Ford by Sun's board marked the high regard in which they held his managerial skills. He was appointed deputy chairman in 1845 and held this post, as well as the chairmanship of the Sun Life Office, until his death. He retired from the post of secretary in 1856 on an annual pension of &pound;1000, though he retained his title of manager. He died on 2 April 1860, aged seventy-six, at his home, 18 Grafton Street, Piccadilly, London, and was buried in Highgate cemetery.<br>
