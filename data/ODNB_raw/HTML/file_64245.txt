<span class="headword">Camden Town Group</span>  (<em>act. </em>1911&#150;1913)<span class="occ"></span> was a society of sixteen artists: <a href="#cosubject_73019">Walter Bayes [<i>see below</i>]</a>, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/64228/', "Robert Bevan")</script>, <a href="#cosubject_64245">Malcolm Drummond [<i>see below</i>]</a>, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37457/', "Harold Gilman")</script>, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/33410/', "Charles Ginner")</script>, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/56866/', "Spencer Gore")</script>, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/40717/', "James Dickson Innes")</script>, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/34196/', "Augustus John")</script>, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/34377/', "Henry Lamb")</script>, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/34517/', "(Percy) Wyndham Lewis")</script>, <a href="#cosubject_73021">Maxwell Gordon Lightfoot [<i>see below</i>]</a>, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/34864/', "James Bolivar Manson")</script>, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35535/', "Lucien Pissarro")</script>, <a href="#cosubject_64532">William Ratcliffe [<i>see below</i>]</a>, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36083/', "Walter Sickert")</script>, and <a href="#cosubject_73022">John Doman Turner [<i>see below</i>]</a>. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/31165/', "Duncan Grant")</script> was elected to replace Lightfoot after the latter's death in September 1911. The group held only three exhibitions, in June 1911, December 1911, and December 1912, all at the Carfax Gallery in fashionable St James's. By the end of 1913 it had ceased to exist as an independent entity.<h2>
<a name="Backgroundhistory"></a>Background history</h2>The Camden Town Group was nurtured by a number of painters who regularly attended the informal Saturday afternoon gatherings hosted by Walter Sickert at 19 Fitzroy Street, London. In spring 1907 the first floor at this address (to the south of more run-down Camden Town) had been jointly rented by Sickert and seven of his colleagues, among whom were Gore and Gilman. The eight founder members of what came to be known as the Fitzroy Street Group, together with disciples, pupils, and colleagues, met weekly to display their work to each other and to a small band of patrons while discussing art and its politics in London. Other painters were soon drawn to join the group, including more future members of the Camden Town Group: Pissarro in autumn 1907, Bayes and Bevan in 1908, and Ginner in 1910.<br>
<br>The district of Camden Town in north-west London also lent its name to the style of painting nurtured between 1907 and 1911 within the Fitzroy Street Group. The pictures were domestic in scale: &#145;mostly little pictures for little patrons&#146;  (L. F. Fergusson and W. Lewis, <span class="italic">Harold Gilman</span>, 1919, 19). An unmistakable Sickert-inspired vocabulary of favourite themes was established: nudes on a bed or at their toilet, informal portraits of friends and coster models in shabby bedsitter interiors, mantelpiece still-lifes of cluttered bric-&agrave;-brac, landscapes of commonplace London streets, squares, and gardens (not all of the Camden Town neighbourhood), and landscapes studied on visits to the country and abroad. Every theme was treated with objective perceptual honesty. The surface of &#145;Camden Town&#146; paintings was typically constructed from a mosaic of crusty touches of high-keyed colours, often dominated by violets and greens. Because Lucien Pissarro (son of the great French impressionist Camille Pissarro), through advocacy and example, influenced his Fitzroy Street colleagues to adopt this handling, it is interpreted as a late and temperate English flowering of French impressionism. As a style, Camden Town painting outlived the group by some five years, kept alive in the studios of the many pupils and disciples of Sickert and Gilman.<br>
<br>By the end of 1910 the gatherings at 19 Fitzroy Street attracted an extensive circle of painters drawn there through a network of friendships and professional relationships. Work by several of the group's younger and less well-known members had begun to breach the conservatism of the New English Art Club (NEAC) jury. Then during the winter of 1910&#150;11 <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/33285/', "Roger Fry")</script> staged his exhibition &#145;Manet and the Post-Impressionists&#146; at the Grafton Gallery. The figureheads of the art world united to condemn the exhibition as an outrage. The old guard of the NEAC were among the most hostile, and it became obvious that the tolerance recently displayed towards the mildly progressive art of Fitzroy Street and its allies would be abruptly withdrawn. This revived antagonism was the main impetus behind the creation of the Camden Town Group.<br>
<br>The chief topic of discussion among members and satellites of Fitzroy Street early in 1911 was this rift with the NEAC. The relative merits of capturing control of its jury or setting up a rival exhibiting society were hotly debated. Ginner told the story of how, dining together at Gatti's, he, Sickert, Bevan, Gore, and Gilman decided to create a new society. Discussion continued at Fitzroy Street and over dinner at the Criterion, when it was decided whom to invite as members. Gilman, strongly supported by Sickert, insisted that the group should exclude women. Ginner recorded that they wished to create a limited circle of those painters whom they considered to be the best and most promising of the day. A restaurant in Golden Square was the setting for a plenary meeting where Gore was elected president and J. B. Manson, recently introduced to the Fitzroy Street circle by Lucien Pissarro, was elected secretary. Bayes recorded that the name of the group was bestowed by Sickert because Camden Town &#145;had been so watered with his tears that something important must sooner or later spring from its soil&#146;  (<span class="italic">Saturday Review</span>, 25 Jan 1930).<h2>
<a name="Newrecruits"></a>New recruits</h2>
<a name="cosubject_73019"></a><span class="headword">Walter John Bayes</span>  (1869&#150;1956)<span class="occ"></span>, born in north-west London on 31 May 1869, was the son of Alfred Walter Bayes (1832&#150;1909), a painter and etcher, and his wife, Emily Ann, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Fielden (<i>fl</i>. <i>c</i>.1840&#150;<i>c</i>.1910). His younger brother was the sculptor <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/38290/', "Gilbert Bayes")</script>, and his sister Jessie Bayes (1878&#150;1970) was also a painter. Following his early education at a Quaker school in Saffron Walden, Essex, and University College School, London, he had been drawn into the Fitzroy Street circle in 1908 when the scale and competence of the decorative paintings he had submitted to the first exhibition of the non-jury Allied Artists' Association (AAA) caught Sickert's attention. Despite having had work accepted for exhibition at the Royal Academy since his student days at Westminster School of Art (1900&#150;02), Bayes had enjoyed little commercial success. His rhythmic sense of composition, his gift for synthesis and simplification, and his idiosyncratic humour won admiration from critics but scant attention from collectors. He was equally at home working on a huge scale&#151;for example, his commissioned war paintings (IWM)&#151;or a small&#151;such as his direct oil sketches of figures, often his wife, Kitty (he married Katherine Teller in 1904), and one or other of their two sons on the beach (public collections with good examples include the Graves Art Gallery, Sheffield, and the art galleries of Aberdeen, Bradford, and Bury). He earned his living as an art critic (at this period of <span class="italic">The Athenaeum</span>) and in later life as a distinguished teacher (he was headmaster of the Westminster School of Art, 1918&#150;34, and of the Lancaster School of Arts and Crafts, 1944&#150;9). He died at his home, 54 Fitzjohn's Avenue, Hampstead, on 21 January 1956.<br>
<br>Just as Sickert introduced Bayes to Fitzroy Street because he liked his work, so recruitment to the Camden Town Group was unsystematic, guided more by personal preference than communal ideology. Wyndham Lewis, his style already touched by the angularity of cubism, was introduced by Gilman or Gore, both of whom he had known since his days at the Slade School of Fine Art. Henry Lamb, a neighbour in Fitzroy Street, and Augustus John, already an artist of wide prestige and repute, sometimes joined the circle at Fitzroy Street on Saturday afternoons. John's membership of the Camden Town Group was a gesture of endorsement rather than personal involvement in the collective effort. The two slight sketches of Wales he sent to the first exhibition were unlikely to divert attention from his lesser-known colleagues. Lamb, on the other hand, treated the Camden Town Group exhibitions as a useful means of widening the audience for his art.<br>
<br>John's Welsh compatriot, James Dickson Innes (1887&#150;1914), was another irregular visitor to the Saturday afternoon gatherings. Innes was born in Llanelli on 27 February 1887. He studied at the Slade School from 1906 to 1908 and had his work accepted for exhibition at the NEAC from 1907 onwards. He travelled extensively. From 1910 to 1912 he frequently returned, sometimes with John, to their native Wales, where both created intense and colourful small-scale landscapes (most public collections in the United Kingdom have paintings by Innes, the greatest number being in the National Museum and Gallery of Wales, Cardiff). Many of Innes's paintings featured Mount Arenig, the personification of his unrequited love for Euphemia Lamb (the ubiquitous <i>femme fatale</i> and wife of Henry Lamb). He is said to have buried her letters in a silver casket on its summit. His fragile connection with the Fitzroy Street and Camden Town groups was severed in 1912 when deteriorating health led him to seek the sun in southern Spain and in north Africa and the Canary Islands. He died in Kent of consumption on 22 August 1914.<br>
<br>According to Bayes, it was Gore who proposed the precocious draughtsman <a name="cosubject_73021"></a><span class="headword">Maxwell Gordon Lightfoot</span>  (1886&#150;1911)<span class="occ"></span>. Lightfoot, born in Granby Street, Liverpool, on 19 July 1886, was the son of William Henry Lightfoot (1852/3&#150;1898), an insurance agent, commercial traveller, and pawnbroker, and his wife, Maxwell Gordon Lindsay (1858/9&#150;1946). After studying at Chester Art School (1901&#150;2) and taking evening classes at Sandon Studios, Liverpool (1905&#150;7), Lightfoot moved to London in 1907 to continue his studies, until December 1909, at the Slade School. During his time there he carried off many of the most coveted prizes. His refined technique, exquisite sense of tone, tender sentiment, and fastidious temperament would have set him apart from most contemporary cliques. The inspiration of the two tender figure paintings (<span class="italic">Mother and Child</span> and <span class="italic">Boy with a Hoop, Frank</span>, both priv. coll.) contributed by Lightfoot to the first exhibition of the Camden Town Group in June 1911 was removed from the twentieth century: <span class="italic">Frank</span> harked back through Whistler to Vel&aacute;zquez; the tondo <span class="italic">Mother and Child</span> had its roots in fifteenth-century Florence. Both paintings stood out as totally different from anything else in the show. Lightfoot regretted joining the Camden Town Group and resigned immediately after the exhibition. On 27 September 1911, aged twenty-five, he cut his throat and died at his home, 13 Fitzroy Road, Primrose Hill.<br>
<br>The art of Lewis, Bayes, Lightfoot, Lamb, John, and Innes was barely touched by association with the Camden Town and Fitzroy Street groups. However, communion with the inner core of Camden Town painters was the mainspring of the artistic development of two other new recruits, Drummond and Ratcliffe.<br>
<br>It is thought that Ginner supported Sickert's proposal of <a name="cosubject_64245"></a><span class="headword">Malcolm Cyril Drummond</span>  (1880&#150;1945)<span class="occ"></span>. The son of Arthur Hislop Drummond and his wife, Anna Harriup, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Dodsworth, Drummond was born on 24 May 1880 at the vicarage in Boyne Hill, near Maidenhead, Berkshire, where his father was a canon of the Church of England. Drummond did not immediately choose painting as his career. After leaving the Oratory School, Birmingham, where he converted to Roman Catholicism, he read history at Christ Church, Oxford (1898&#150;1902), then spent a year in Yorkshire training as an estate agent before studying at the Slade School (1903&#150;7). In 1906 he married Zina Lilias Ogilvie, herself an artist and illustrator, with whom he shared a deep love of music. He was Sickert's pupil from 1908 to 1910 at the Westminster School of Art, in 1909 at his private etching class, and in 1910 at Rowlandson House. By 1910 paintings such as <span class="italic">Brompton Oratory</span> (exh. 1910; Arts Council of England) demonstrate his sophisticated grasp of form, colour, and design. His most innovative work was done during the Camden Town period, and his finest paintings were exhibited at the three Camden Town Group exhibitions, beginning with <span class="italic">Paddington Station</span> exhibited in June 1911, when it was much praised by the critics. He was a founder member of the London Group (1913) and its treasurer in 1921. During the war he worked in the War Office and later taught at the Westminster School of Art (1925&#150;31). Following the death of his wife in 1931, he left London and settled in Moulsford, Berkshire. In 1934 he married Margaret Triquet Browning. He died at his home, Grange Cottage, Moulsford, on 10 April 1945, having been totally blind since 1943.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_64532"></a><span class="headword">William Whitehead Ratcliffe</span>  (1870&#150;1955)<span class="occ"></span> was proposed by Gilman. The son of Zachariah Johnson Ratcliffe, a mill worker, and his wife, Kezia, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Harness, a draper, Ratcliffe was born in Clenchwarton, near King's Lynn, Norfolk, on 6 October 1870 and grew up in Manchester. He went to evening classes at the Manchester School of Art, where he was influenced by the teaching of Walter Crane, an arts and crafts designer and illustrator. In 1894 he went to London to work as a wallpaper pattern designer, and in 1906 moved to the new garden city of Letchworth. When in 1908 Gilman moved to the same road in Letchworth as Ratcliffe, the two became friends. In 1910 Gilman persuaded Ratcliffe to abandon his work as a commercial designer in Letchworth to live as a full-time painter in London, where he briefly attended the Slade.<br>
<br>Membership of the Camden Town Group gave Ratcliffe, a shy and diminutive man (he was under 5 feet tall), the self-confidence to produce paintings at once distinguished and original. His controlled use of broken brushwork and high-keyed colour to support a taut design structure is seen at its best in his views of London, for example, <span class="italic">Clarence Gardens</span> (Tate collection), shown at the AAA and Camden Town Group exhibitions in 1912, and in the landscapes he painted on a visit to Sweden in 1913. Figures played but an incidental role in his paintings, even in <span class="italic">The Coffee House, East Finchley</span> of 1914 (Southampton City Art Gallery), which brilliantly captures the dingy respectability of a suburban caf&eacute;. Ratcliffe exhibited <span class="italic">The Coffee House</span> with the London Group in 1919, the year in which Gilman, its president, had died. The main body of Ratcliffe's work thereafter was watercolours and wood-engravings. Unencumbered by possessions, he led a peripatetic life, staying with friends and family. When he died, unmarried, at 24 Hayes Crescent, Golders Green, London, on 6 January 1955 he was barely remembered, despite the one-man show held at the Roland, Browse, and Delbanco Gallery in London in 1946 and another in Letchworth Art Gallery in 1954. After his death his brother, the journalist S. K. Ratcliffe, gave some of his better paintings to various provincial art galleries; the residue of his studio went to Letchworth.<br>
<br>Gore proposed his pupil <a name="cosubject_73022"></a><span class="headword">John Doman Turner</span>  (1871/2&#150;1938)<span class="occ"></span>, who worked in pencil, charcoal, chalk, and watercolour, but not in oils. Born in Lambeth, London, the son of Edmund Turner, a builder, and his wife, Sarah Ann, Turner married Frances Elizabeth, the daughter of George Birch, a carpenter, in Norwich on 25 November 1893, when his address was recorded as 61 Kings Road, Peckham. He lived most of his adult life&#151;certainly from 1900 onwards&#151;in Streatham, where he earned his living as a stockbroker's clerk. He was deaf. These facts, together with his unusual training as an artist through a sequence of some thirty letters from Gore offering constructive criticism on the drawings Turner sent to him over the period 1908&#150;13, suggest he was an amateur. So he was in the literal sense, but the quality of his work and his dedication were professional (Southampton City Art Gallery and the University of Hull own drawings by Turner). His extant drawings of Ilfracombe, Tenby, Walberswick, Eastbourne, and Folkestone probably reflect holidays in these seaside towns. In London he studied contemporary life, including theatre and music-hall interiors and fairground scenes on Mitcham Common. After the death of Gore in March 1914, Turner rarely exhibited his work. He died from pneumonia at his home, 63 Downton Avenue, Streatham, on 3 January 1938.<h2>
<a name="CamdenTownGroupexhibitions"></a>Camden Town Group exhibitions</h2>Once a finite membership of sixteen was achieved, Sickert persuaded Arthur Clifton of the Carfax Gallery in Bury Street, St James's, to lend his basement premises in June 1911 for their first exhibition. Each of the members was entitled to show four works, to be hung together rather than mixed on the walls. In fact at the first exhibition only fifty-five instead of sixty-four pictures were shown; Innes did not exhibit, while Lamb with three and Lewis and John with two pictures each did not take their full quota. Sickert's four contributions included two related figure subjects given the Camden Town murder title&#151;probably for publicity reasons. Lewis contributed two angular pen-and-ink drawings of a man's head which excited much derision. Otherwise, there was little to offend the critics: fresh urban and rural landscapes, Camden Town figures in interiors, two cab-yard scenes by Bevan, two music-halls by Gore. John's presence was reassuring, and every critic could recognize the qualities of design and draughtsmanship and the technical fluency of Lightfoot and Lamb.<br>
<br>The second exhibition of the group was held at the Carfax Gallery in December 1911, when fifty-three pictures were shown. Duncan Grant, elected to replace Lightfoot, contributed one picture; John did not exhibit; Bayes and Lewis with three pictures each and Lamb with two explain the shortfall. At a meeting attended by all members except Grant, Innes, and John, the idea of expanding the group was first debated but finally voted down. However, a motion that new and larger premises be sought for their exhibitions was carried unanimously and effectively delayed active consideration of their next exhibition, which did not take place until December 1912.<br>
<br>At the third and last Camden Town Group exhibition, held yet again at the Carfax Gallery because larger premises had not been found, thirteen of the sixteen members showed a total of forty-five pictures. Grant, John, and Innes abstained. Each, having closer artistic and commercial allegiances to rival societies and galleries, had exhibited only once with the group. Their absence meant that the overall character of the paintings on view was more cohesive than in 1911. Only Bayes, Lamb, and Lewis remained to represent styles developed outside the influence of the original nucleus of Fitzroy Street painters. The year between shows had allowed time for the talents of less experienced exhibitors to mature, and this third exhibition included Drummond's <span class="italic">St James's Park</span> (Southampton City Art Gallery) and Ratcliffe's <span class="italic">Clarence Gardens</span> (Tate collection). Ginner also showed a painting of central London, <span class="italic">Piccadilly Circus</span> (Tate collection), one of his earliest brilliantly coloured and tautly constructed cityscapes. Bevan showed his first London horse-sale paintings. Three artists exhibiting with the Camden Town Group&#151;Lewis, Lamb, and Gore&#151;were also invited by Roger Fry to contribute to his second post-impressionist exhibition at the Grafton Gallery, which opened in October 1912 and was extended in December, thus overlapping the Carfax Gallery offering. The coincidence of these two exhibitions tended to polarize their respective characters in the eyes of critics and public. The viability of the Camden Town Group was threatened when it was relegated to a neutral position between the radicalism of Fry's selection and the conservatism of the NEAC.<br>
<br>During 1913, as in 1912, Arthur Clifton continued to sponsor the work of individual members of the Camden Town Group by offering them separate exhibitions at the Carfax Gallery. The gatherings chaired by Sickert at 19 Fitzroy Street remained a focus where members of the Camden Town Group were joined by visitors drawn from a wider compass. Some&#151;for instance, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/33025/', "Jacob Epstein")</script> in April 1913&#151;became members of the parent society. Radical art politics were in a state of constant flux during this year as rival factions formed, overlapped, and re-formed. In the autumn, when the Fitzroy Street Group reassembled after a summer recess to face decisions about expansion of the Camden Town Group, it was resolved that a new society be formed by amalgamating the two groups. Thus was the more broadly based London Group born.<br>
<br>The Camden Town Group has no clear death date: it petered out after less than three years' independent existence. Its last gesture as a corporate body was to respond to the invitation to select an exhibition of &#145;English Post-Impressionists, Cubists and Others&#146; held at the Brighton Art Gallery from December 1913 until January 1914.<h2>
<a name="Significance"></a>Significance</h2>The Camden Town Group brought together a group of painters each in his own way gifted with a desire to explore and to innovate within the boundaries of figurative art. At a time of unprecedented ferment in the arts, when all the traditional canons were being cast aside, Sickert and his colleagues negotiated a path between the ultimately sterile working of tired styles from the past and the wilder shores of experimentation to which technically and intellectually they were not willing to respond. The lasting achievement of the Fitzroy Street Group and its Camden Town satellite was not to shelter a belated flowering of English impressionism but to offer a milieu where iconoclasm was not demanded as a proof of modernity, where the patient effort to present objective records of urban life was not anachronistic, and where the craft of painting was respected. Over twenty years later, when the jazz and the machine ages had passed, the Euston Road School drew inspiration from its north-west London forebears. The legacy endures.<br>
