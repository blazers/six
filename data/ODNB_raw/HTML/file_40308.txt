<span class="headword">Duncan,  Joseph Forbes</span>  (1879&#150;1964), <span class="occ">trade unionist</span>, was born at Boat of Bridge, Banffshire, on 3 June 1879, the son of William Duncan, gardener, and his wife, Margaret, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Munro. He was educated at the local school and Robert Gordon's College in Aberdeen, which he left at the age of fifteen to work on his father's small farm before taking up a position as a clerk in the General Post Office in London. He returned to Banffshire for health reasons in 1898 and worked as a clerk in Aberdeen where he became politically active, before becoming involved in the Scottish Workers' Parliamentary Election Committee and the Fabian Society. In 1904 he was appointed the general secretary of the Scottish Steam Vessels Enginemen's and Firemen's Union (SSVFU). Like many small Scottish unions, the SSVFU had little bargaining power with employers and the strikes under Duncan's leadership were not successful.<br>
<br>From 1906 to 1908 Duncan was employed by the Independent Labour Party (ILP), then the principal motive force of the Scottish labour movement, as their organizer in the east of Scotland. His daily letters to his fianc&eacute;e and later wife, Mabel Saunders (also active in the labour movement and the campaigns of the suffragettes), provide an insight into the life of an itinerant activist in the fissiparous world of Scottish left-wing politics. He often expressed idealism and optimism about the prospects for the advance of the labour movement, responding to Labour victories in the 1906 general election by telling Mabel that &#145;the revolution has started&#146;  (NL Scot., Acc. 5490(1)/30, 21 Jan 1906). He later complained, though, that the members of the rival Social Democratic Federation (SDF) had been trying to &#145;poison the wells&#146; in advance of his work  (NL Scot., Acc. 5490(1)/59, 2 July 1906) and on another occasion he reached the Fife mining district only to find that &#145;a teacher, John Maclean MA of Glasgow&#146; had been there just before him in the interest of the SDF  (NL Scot., Acc. 5490(1)/64, no date). The work was hard, the farming and mining districts of the east coast were not especially fertile territory for socialism, and the ILP was inefficient in payment of salary and expenses. As a result, Duncan resigned and returned to work in the north-east of Scotland in 1908 and was active in the attempt to rebuild the National Union of Dock Labourers. He married in Glasgow, on 22 May 1909, (Jessie) Mabel Saunders (1873&#150;1968), daughter of George Saunders, a Congregationalist minister. They had no children.<br>
<br>Duncan's next project took him into an area which remained one of the principal areas of interest for the rest of his life: agricultural trade unionism. In 1912 he began the Scottish Farm Servants' Union (SFSU). G. B. Clark, the former MP for Caithness, was also involved but Duncan was the moving force and in 1918 became the salaried general secretary of the union. The union's journal, the <span class="italic">Scottish Farm Servant</span>, provided a vehicle for Duncan's journalistic talents, and he also wrote extensively for the semi-official <span class="italic">Scottish Journal of Agriculture</span>. The system of annual hiring fairs with their twelve-month contracts hindered union organization and the Farm Servants Union was never able to attract more than a small minority of farm labourers in Scotland. The SFSU took a distinctive position on the question of setting wages for farm workers. In England this matter had been increasingly regulated by state bodies but Duncan resisted the application of this system to Scotland, as he felt that it would only serve to depress the relatively high wages of the highly skilled Scottish farm labour force. As a result of the activity of Duncan and the SFSU, Scotland was excluded from the first Labour government's legislation to regulate agricultural wages. Duncan was resisted the appeal of protectionism in Scottish farming. Indeed, in the 1920s the industry as a whole stuck to a free-trade position despite depressed years in the early part of the decade. The more serious and long-lasting downturn of the late 1920s and early 1930s forced him to reconsider on both wage regulation and government support for agricultural production. Wage regulation was brought in to Scotland in 1937 and over the course of that decade most of the main areas of Scottish farm output came to be supported by government. The SFSU affiliated to the Transport and General Workers' Union in 1932 and was absorbed by it in 1942 after a period of falling membership.<br>
<br>Duncan's concern for the social conditions of farm workers was recognized by his appointment a member of the royal commission on the housing of the industrial population of Scotland. This had been established in 1912 as a result of concern over miners' housing but it soon developed a wider agenda and Duncan was able to use the commission as a platform to criticize farmers for the appallingly low standard of farm cottages in Scotland. The royal commission exposed the shocking standard of housing and sanitation for farm labourers across lowland Scotland. He believed that pressure should be brought to bear on farmers to invest from their own resources in the improvement in housing so that they could meet statutory requirements under public health legislation. This view was defensible but impractical as farmers, especially in difficult years, failed to invest and local authorities were lax in their enforcement. The Scottish housing advisory committee, of which Duncan was also a member, returned to the problem in 1935 and instituted a system of state grants to improve rural housing. Duncan believed that this let the farmers off the hook.<br>
<br>These activities gained recognition for Duncan as the foremost expert on Scottish agriculture. He served on the royal commission on agriculture of 1919 and was also a member of the agricultural research committee, with a particular interest in agricultural economics. He wrote widely on this subject, notably for the <span class="italic">Journal of Agricultural Economics</span>, which he had helped to found. In an article of 1932 in this journal he argued for greater prominence for agricultural economists in policy making. He served on numerous public bodies concerned with agriculture, co-operation, and education, notably on the board of governors of the Scottish Colleges of Agriculture, established after the foundation of the Board of Agriculture for Scotland in 1912. In 1938 he was a member of the Scottish economic committee's sub-committee that looked into the problems afflicting the highlands and islands of Scotland. Its sensible recommendations to encourage economic diversification in the crofting areas were not implemented owing to government indifference and the outbreak of war. He had strong views on the land question and was an advocate of land nationalization. In his presidential address to the Agricultural Economics Society in 1940 he argued that agricultural reconstruction was hampered by &#145;the system of personal ownership&#146;  (p. 27). This was another subject of his journalistic output, notably for the ILP's vibrant Glasgow newspaper <span class="italic">Forward</span>.<br>
<br>Duncan served as president of the Scottish Trades Union Congress in 1926. The tough experiences of the inter-war period dampened his earlier youthful optimism about the prospects for the labour movement. He was three times an unsuccessful Labour candidate for parliament: in a 1919 by-election in Aberdeenshire Central, in Moray and Nairn in the general election of 1929, and in a 1935 by-election in Aberdeen South. None of these seats was propitious for a Labour candidate. Duncan, however, might easily have secured a safe Labour seat had he shown any firm interest in a parliamentary career. He was on the right-wing of the Labour Party, and critical of the left of the ILP, whom he saw as hopelessly impractical in their outlook. He was also a strong opponent of Scottish home rule, which he argued was divisive of the interests of the working classes in Scotland and England and potentially disastrous for Scottish farming. In this outlook he was in the mainstream of Labour opinion in Scotland, which was strongly unionist from the 1930s.<br>
<br>Duncan retired from the SFSU in 1945 but he remained prominent in Scottish public life until the early 1960s, when he was afflicted by poor health. He was awarded an honorary doctorate by the University of Glasgow in 1946. Duncan died in hospital in Aberdeen on 1 December 1964. His funeral took place at Aberdeen crematorium.<br>
