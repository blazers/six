<span class="headword">Stone,  Frank</span>  (1800&#150;1859), <span class="occ">artist</span>, born at Manchester on 22 August 1800, was the son of a cotton spinner. Having attended school at Manchester and later at Prestbury, Cheshire, he worked in his father's firm until he turned twenty-four. At that time he retired, taking a small share in the business, whose subsequent decline straitened his income all his life. Although he never received a single art lesson, Stone then supported himself for seven years by painting oil portraits of Mancunians. In 1831 he moved to a back parlour and bedroom at 84 Newman Street, Oxford Street, London, intending to study the art of watercolour. To support himself, he provided pencil designs at 5 guineas apiece for Charles Heath's <span class="italic">Book of Beauty</span> and other illustrated volumes, and watercolour busts at 10 guineas to art dealers and printers. On 11 February 1833 Stone was elected an associate exhibitor of the Old Watercolour Society. A few years later he moved into larger quarters in Berners Street, where he set up a studio with costumes and props. Between 1833 and 1846 he exhibited from one to three watercolours a year in the society's gallery. In 1837 Stone was represented for the first time at the Royal Academy exhibition by two portraits in oil, to which he turned, it is said, because his dealer for the watercolours was offensively vulgar. Many of these early works depicted women in exotic or sentimental situations taken from Byron, among others; Thackeray labelled them &#145;rococo rustics&#146;  (&#145;Picture gossip&#146;, <span class="italic">Fraser's Magazine</span>, June 1845). More rarely, Stone attempted scenes from Sir Walter Scott and Shakespeare. In 1841 he was awarded a premium of 50 guineas by the British Institution for <span class="italic">The Heart's Misgivings</span>, and on 13 June 1842 he was elected a member of the Old Watercolour Society. Among his most popular pictures, well known through an engraving, is <span class="italic">The Last Appeal</span>. Others with a wide circulation through engravings were the paired pictures <span class="italic">Impending Mate</span> and <span class="italic">Mated</span>. On 17 June 1846 Stone resigned from the watercolour society, probably because he intended to seek admission to the Royal Academy and pursue oil painting. He was elected an associate of the Royal Academy in 1851 and exhibited a total of forty-two pictures there, along with twenty-four at the British Institution and ten at the Suffolk Street Gallery.<br>
<br>Although he had arrived in London friendless and poor, Stone nevertheless made his way into the company of leading writers and artists. By 1835 he was close to William Makepeace Thackeray, Daniel Maclise, and George Cattermole. He became the intimate friend of Dickens, having first made his acquaintance when Dickens attended meetings of the Shakespeare Club (1838&#150;9) of which Stone was a co-founder and secretary. Dickens, Cattermole, and William Macready agreed that Stone could sometimes be a social bore, volubly opinionated on many subjects&#151;but they also found him a loyal friend, always ready for a walk, a dinner, or a holiday at Broadstairs. At some time married to his mistress, Elizabeth (<i>c</i>.1815&#150;1890), with whom he had a number of children both before and after marriage, and earning a good living from his art, Stone moved in 1845 to Tavistock House, Tavistock Square. During the next dozen years he played roles, with increasing effect, in many of Dickens's theatricals, performing in London and on tour. He was, in the words of the tour's inadvertent eyewitness, Mrs Gamp (a nurse Dickens had first created in <span class="italic">Martin Chuzzlewit</span>), &#145;a fine-looking, portly gentleman, with a face like a amiable full moon&#146;  (Forster, 2.353). In 1848 Stone provided designs for three illustrations to Dickens's Christmas book <span class="italic">The Haunted Man</span>: all featured the &#145;good spirit&#146; of the story, Milly Swidger. Dickens liked Stone's drawings so well he commissioned the artist to design portraits of 'Tilda Price, Kate Nickleby, and Madeline Bray which were engraved by Edward Finden and published &#145;with the approbation&#146; of the author for insertion as extra plates in the cheap edition of <span class="italic">Nicholas Nickleby</span> (1848). In the following year Stone designed the wood-engraved frontispiece for the cheap edition of <span class="italic">Martin Chuzzlewit</span>.<br>
<br>When Stone moved to the adjacent Russell House in 1851, and Dickens leased Stone's former home, the friendship between the two families grew even closer. Old Tone or Pumpion (Pump), as Dickens (the Sparkler) nicknamed Stone, painted a portrait of Dickens's son Sydney in 1849 and later drew portraits of Dickens's daughters Mary and Katherine. Dickens also befriended Stone's children, Ellen (<i>b</i>. 1836?), Arthur Paul (<i>b</i>. 1838), Lilian Bertha (<i>b</i>. 1845), and especially <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/101036/', "Marcus Clayton Stone (1840&#150;1921)")</script>, who later served as Dickens's illustrator (for <span class="italic">Our Mutual Friend</span>) and flourished subsequently as a Royal Academician. During the final years Stone's work acquired more breadth and simplicity and showed less trace of drawing-room sentiment. Among his later productions were <span class="italic">The Gardener's Daughter</span> and studies of fisherfolk at Boulogne.<br>
<br>Stone died suddenly at his home, Russell House, Tavistock Square, London, of heart disease on 18 November 1859 and was buried in Highgate cemetery six days later. At the time of his death he was estranged from his wife, who survived until 2 January 1890. He left her his Royal Academy allowance and her jewellery; the remaining assets were bequeathed to his children.<br>
