<span class="headword">Sears,  John George</span>  (1870&#150;1916), <span class="occ">shoe manufacturer and retailer</span>, was born on 6 February 1870 in Northampton, the eldest child of James Sears, leather seller and shoe manufacturer, and Amelia (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Cushion), both of Northampton. After attending a local elementary school Sears was apprenticed in the shoe trade, working for the Manfield company in Northampton. In 1891 he began a business with his younger brother William Thomas Sears, under the name J. Sears &amp; Co. Production was initially small-scale with the company able to take outwork for the strike-bound Manfields during the great shoe dispute of 1895. A year later, with his business prospering, Sears married Caroline Wooding, of Northampton, with whom he had one daughter and two sons.<br>
<br>The company soon began to make a bigger mark. According to an obituarist,<blockquote>it was not alone in the manufacture of boots and shoes that Mr. Sears won his way. &hellip; He was the pioneer of the modern multiple business which caters for the middle class man and makes specialities lines at fixed prices. (<span class="italic">Northampton Daily Chronicle</span>, 19 Feb 1916)</blockquote>In 1897 Sears opened his first branch shop, and in 1900 a branch in Fleet Street, London. By 1912 the company had eighty branches, forty-seven of which were in the London area. Production was continually expanded with moves to bigger works and then extensions to a purpose-built factory. In January 1912 the company was floated as a public company under the name J. Sears &amp; Co. (Trueform Boot Company) Ltd. In 1913 it took over another local manufacturing company run by Frank Panther who joined the Sears board. The war brought further prosperity from government orders and when Sears died the company was employing some 1000 workers in production and 1000 in retailing.<br>
<br>Sears was renowned for his capacity for work, and some felt that overwork contributed to his early death at the age of forty-six. However, the company success was the result of a team effort, including that of his brother, Frank Panther, and others, and for this reason the firm continued to prosper after his death. Sears's own flair lay in the retailing side, especially in selecting sites for high-street shops that would prove attractive to middle-class customers, and in overseeing the development of the retailing strategy.<br>
<br>It was expected that local manufacturers would play a role in the regulation of the shoe industry, and Sears served on the clicking arbitration board. In 1913 he also became president of the Northampton Shoe Manufacturers Association. However, the ill health that was to dog his last years and lead to his early death forced him to step down. This perhaps also prevented him from playing a more prominent political role. He was a Liberal in politics but refused to stand for local office. Like other manufacturers he supported local philanthropic causes. His ill health was such that he finally withdrew from real influence on the business in the last year of his life.<br>
<br>During his lifetime Sears rose from being a humble &#145;clicker&#146; (or leather cutter) in the shoe industry to the position of a great manufacturer and retailer. As he became more prominent, his lifestyle inevitably changed. He had been born into a Congregationalist family, but later switched to the Church of England. In 1913&#150;14 he bought and extended Collingtree Grange in Northamptonshire, the former estate of a prominent local brewer, and there he spent his last years collecting books and works of art, and taking an interest in breeding pedigree cattle. He was a prominent mason and served as a provincial grand master.<br>
<br>Sears died on 19 February 1916 at Collingtree Grange, survived by his wife; he was buried at St Columba's Church, Collingtree, on 23 February. The firm which he and his brother founded was to experience dramatic growth in the early twentieth century. It eventually became Sears plc, a conglomerate which played a major role in the retailing of shoes and clothing in the UK in the second half of the twentieth century.<br>
