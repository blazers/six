<span class="headword">Essex,  John</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1744), <span class="occ">dancing-master</span>, is of obscure origins, as the place and date of his birth, and his parentage, are unknown. Nothing is known of his early life or his education but by 1702 he was established as a professional dancer at the Drury Lane Theatre, where his repertoire included serious and comic dances. His stage career ended abruptly in 1703, when he made a complaint against the theatre's manager, Christopher Rich, which apparently resulted in his discharge from the company. He did not try to return to the stage, and by 1707 he had moved to Rood Lane (off Fenchurch Street) in the parish of St Dionis Backchurch in the City of London, where he seems to have taught music as well as dancing. Essex had married by 1703, for he and his wife, Catherine (<i>d</i>. 1721), were the parents of a son baptized that year at St Paul's, Covent Garden. Between 1707 and 1715 the registers of St Dionis Backchurch record that John and Catherine Essex had five more children, three of whom died soon after they were baptized.<br>
<br>By 1706 Essex was closely associated with a group of London dancing-masters working to raise the status and reform the practice of dancing, led by Mr Isaac, Thomas Caverley, and John Weaver. Essex subscribed to <span class="italic">Orchesography</span> (1706), John Weaver's translation of <span class="italic">Choregraphie</span> (1700), a treatise on dance notation by Raoul Auger Feuillet, and <span class="italic">A Collection of Ball-Dances</span> (1706), Weaver's notations of six dances by Mr Isaac. Essex himself produced a translation of the introduction to Feuillet's <span class="italic">Recueil de contredances</span> (1706), a treatise on the notation of country dances, entitled <span class="italic">For the Further Improvement of Dancing</span> (1710) and containing several notated country dances. A new edition of the work appeared about 1715, dedicated to the princess of Wales, with the notation for a ball dance by Essex entitled <span class="italic">The Princess's Passpied</span>. Essex wrote music as well as choreographing dances, for <span class="italic">A Collection of Minuets, Rigadoons &amp; French Dances</span> (1721) included some of his compositions.<br>
<br>Essex's wife was buried on 9 March 1721 but he himself continued to live in Rood Lane, which was given as his address in 1722, when his second book, <span class="italic">The Young Ladies Conduct, or, Rules for Education</span> appeared. This treatise on female education was conventional, except for its emphasis on the usefulness of dancing. It discussed qualities desirable in women, such as chastity and industry, as well as those to be avoided or corrected, such as pride and vanity; it also identified music, drawing, embroidery, and housewifery as among the proper employments for young ladies. Essex seems to have drawn many of his precepts from <span class="italic">The Adventures of Telemachus</span>, a translation of F&eacute;nelon's <span class="italic">T&eacute;l&eacute;maque</span>.<br>
<br>Essex maintained his links with other leading dancing-masters, subscribing to Weaver's <span class="italic">Anatomical and Mechanical Lectures upon Dancing</span> (1721) and Anthony L'Abb&eacute;'s <span class="italic">A New Collection of Dances</span> (<i>c</i>.1725), which consisted of theatre dances recorded in notation. His most important book appeared in 1728&#151;<span class="italic">The Dancing-Master, or, The Art of Dancing Explained</span>, his translation of Pierre Rameau's <span class="italic">Le ma&icirc;tre &agrave; danser</span> (1725), which for the first time described how to perform many of the steps notated in Feuillet's <span class="italic">Choregraphie</span>. Essex added his own preface to the work, in which he provided thumbnail sketches of the dancing-masters Groscourt (to whom the translation was dedicated), Isaac, L'Abb&eacute;, Caverley, and the dancer John Shaw, among others; he reserved special praise for John Weaver and the dancer-actress Hester Booth. A second edition of <span class="italic">The Dancing-Master</span> was published in 1731 and the work was reissued about 1733 with new illustrations by George Bickham the younger. Another edition appeared in 1744, the year that John Essex died; he was buried, alongside his wife, in St Dionis Backchurch on 6 February. His will included a bequest of &pound;20 for John Weaver and divided the residue of his estate between two surviving children, William and Elizabeth. William Essex, whose date and place of birth are unknown, was also a dancing-master and enjoyed a successful career as a dancer at Drury Lane and other theatres between 1724 and 1746. John Essex has been identified as the dancing-master portrayed in the second painting in Hogarth's series <span class="italic">The Rake's Progress</span> but there is little evidence to support this.<br>
