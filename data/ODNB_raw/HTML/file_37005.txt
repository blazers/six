<span class="headword">Wood,  Thomas</span>  (1892&#150;1950), <span class="occ">composer</span>, was born on 28 November 1892 at Chorley, Lancashire, the only child of Thomas Wood, a master mariner, and his wife, Hannah Lee. As a child he accompanied his father on many voyages and he always regarded this experience as an education of the most effective kind. It was supplemented, in his case, however, by other schooling, both general and musical; and Wood had already completed an external degree in music at Oxford before he arrived there in 1913 to work for the degree of BA which he obtained in 1918. In 1916 he migrated from Christ Church to Exeter College, with which he was to be associated for the rest of his life, and in 1917 his studies were interrupted by a period at the Admiralty. After the war, at the Royal College of Music, he studied under the direction of Sir Charles Stanford, to whom Wood's music owes much. He became DMus in 1920.<br>
<br>Wood spent a short time as director of music at Tonbridge School. On 2 July 1924 he married St Osyth Mahala (<i>b</i>. 1886/7), daughter of Thomas Eustace-Smith. The same year he returned to Exeter College as lecturer (he held the post until 1927) and there began the compositions for which he soon became known. During the next thirty years he produced a series of works, both choral and orchestral, of which the most successful were <span class="italic">Forty Singing Seamen</span> (1925), <span class="italic">A Seaman's Overture</span> (1927), <span class="italic">Daniel and the Lions</span> (1938), <span class="italic">Chanticleer</span> (1947), and <span class="italic">The Rainbow</span> (1951). Wood's achievements were made despite eyesight so poor as to be near blindness.<br>
<br>Apart from music the prevailing passions of Wood's life were the sea, foreign travel, and the British empire. For the empire he had a romantic idealist's love. He undertook extensive journeys, sometimes for musical activities, sometimes for personal interests, and at least once (1944) for the government. These journeys provided material for a number of books of which <span class="italic">Cobbers</span> (1934) was widely acclaimed as a penetrating account of the Australian scene and character. Wood's music was naturally influenced by these interests. English life, in the country or at sea, and the ways of ordinary men and women are the constant themes to which its sturdy plain-spoken individuality is well suited. After 1945, having come to feel that his wide interests were dissipating his talent, Wood prepared to devote himself wholly to musical composition. His sudden and untimely death on 19 November 1950, at his home, Parsonage Hall, Bures, Suffolk, frustrated an intention upon which his friends had based high hopes. He had been elected an honorary fellow of his college, and had been made a member of the Arts Council, in the previous year.<br>
