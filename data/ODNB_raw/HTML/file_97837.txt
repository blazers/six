<span class="headword">Young,  Priscilla Helen Ferguson</span>  (1925&#150;2006), <span class="occ">social worker</span>, was born on 25 November 1925 at her grandparents' home, Walcot Rectory, 22 The Circus, Bath, Somerset, the elder child of Fergus Ferguson Young, a teacher and social worker, and his wife, Helen Frances Graham, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Murphy, who had worked at the Foreign Office until her marriage. At the time of her birth her father was secretary of the Bradford Council of Social Service, and lived at 14 Cleveland Road, Heaton, Bradford. There were relatives of Scottish, Irish, and English descent.<br>
<br>When Young was four she went to Kenya with her parents, where her father taught in a rural area. Her brother, Angus, was born there in 1933. As a young white child she was relatively isolated. She did not go to school but was taught by her mother and examined by her father. She spent a good deal of time on her own, watching the dung beetles scurry around, and practising the skills to avoid charging rhinos, seeing every day the tall Maasai passing by. She developed a sturdy self-reliance and a capacity to enjoy her own company.<br>
<br>Young returned to England with her parents and infant brother in 1936. She went to Kingsley School in Leamington and thence to Edinburgh University where, after an honours degree, she took a course in social studies. She then worked in London for four years with the Family Welfare Association. From 1948 there were opportunities to work in the newly created children's departments in local government to provide services for children who had to live away from home. Young worked in Somerset from 1951 to 1953 and then from 1953 to 1958 in Oxford, where she became deputy children's officer. In the late 1950s she decided to widen her experience by working with the Child and Family Services in Portland, Maine, USA, where she remained for three years.<br>
<br>On returning to the UK in 1961 Young took a post as lecturer in social work at the University of Leicester, where she remained, becoming a senior lecturer, until 1971. This was a time of very rapid expansion both within social work and in education for an emerging profession. In 1971 the government decided to set up a statutory body to promote and validate social work training, the Central Council for Education and Training in Social Work (CCETSW). Young was appointed to head it and she began fifteen years of unremittingly demanding work, based in London. These years coincided with a period of heavy caring responsibilities, as her parents aged and grew ill.<br>
<br>For more than ten years the council of CCETSW was unwieldy and too big. Young herself said that &#145;it was like trying to work with a parliament without a government&#146;  (<span class="italic">Social Services Insight</span>). CCETSW was pulled hither and thither by the conflicting interests of employers, trade unions, and academics, as well as service users. Young and her colleagues had to modify, reconcile, resist, or accept the diverse influences. In the years of her leadership there was a sharply increased awareness of the role of social workers in the area of children's services, especially in relation to child protection. The government had set a target&#151;that the numbers in training should increase by 60 per cent in the first five years. This was achieved, but against a background of difficulties in resourcing and disagreement about ways forward. CCETSW had been set up without earmarked finance and was thus exposed to the chill winds of the oil crisis in the 1970s. The newly formed British Association of Social Workers, fleeing from &#145;&eacute;litism&#146;, removed professional qualification as a criterion for membership. Trade unions resisted post-qualifying training as the knowledge base grew. Educational establishments clashed with employers about the shape and content of courses. Issues concerning race began to emerge and caused much pain to many. Politicians were ambivalent and unclear about direction. Behind it all lay big questions about the range of tasks which should be described as social work and the extent to which a common basic training was appropriate.<br>
<br>Throughout the difficult years at CCETSW Young kept the ship steady. She remained true to her professional values, underpinned by a deep but unostentatious religious faith. She had a particular gift for making good working relationships with people at all levels in the organization from the chair to the cleaning ladies. She was least comfortable in adversarial situations, such as arose with trade unions or in relation to racial issues. She commented that &#145;one of the greatest stresses of the job was the diversity and levels of things that had to be dealt with&#146;  (&#145;Recollections&#146;). These years took their toll because CCETSW became an easy target for those with vested interests. She said&#151;ruefully&#151;that &#145;there have been times when I have thought of trying to establish a self-help group for Aunt Sallies&#146;  (<span class="italic">Social Services Insight</span>). Nevertheless she led CCETSW with a powerful commitment, integrity, humanity, a sense of proportion, and a keen sense of humour, and played an important role in establishing social work as a valuable and recognized profession.<br>
<br>Young was appointed CBE in 1982 for her services to social-work education. Her retirement in 1986 was marked by the award of an honorary DLitt by the University of Ulster. She lived in the west country for most of the time after she retired and engaged in a range of charitable and voluntary activities, enjoying her talent for home-making. She spent her last few years at The Rectory, Church Road, Leonard Stanley, Gloucestershire, with a friend, the Revd Sue Phillipson-Masters, who cared for her at home in her last illness. She died there, of cerebrovascular disease, on 8 January 2006, and her funeral was at the local church. She was survived by her brother, Angus.<br>
