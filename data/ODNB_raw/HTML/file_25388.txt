<span class="headword">Sherrey <span class="st"> [Sherry]</span>,  Richard</span>  (<em>b. </em><em>c.</em>1505), <span class="occ">schoolmaster and author</span>, was born in London diocese about 1505 and admitted as a demy (undergraduate scholar) of Magdalen College, Oxford, in 1522. He graduated as a BA in 1528 and as MA in 1531. From Magdalen he went to Cardinal College, Oxford, founded by Magdalen's alumnus Cardinal Wolsey, where in 1530 he occurs as a minor canon and teacher of grammar to the choristers. He returned to Magdalen, between Michaelmas 1531 and January 1532, as master of the college school, where he remained until Michaelmas 1540. In 1532 he also held a fellowship at University College and was ordained as an exorcist, but it is not clear if he proceeded to major holy orders. On leaving Magdalen College School, Sherrey appears to have moved to London, very probably to another teaching post since his four known published works include two contributions to the study of grammar. His <span class="italic">Treatise of Schemes and Tropes Gathered out of the Best Grammarians and Orators</span> (1550) provided a systematic review of figures of speech&#151;the first of its kind in English&#151;as well as a translation of Erasmus's work <span class="italic">De civilitate morum puerilium</span>, with an introduction dated at London. <span class="italic">A Very Fruitful Exposition upon the Sixth Chapter of St John</span>, translated from a work by Johann Brentz the elder, appeared in the same year and describes Sherrey as a Londoner. <span class="italic">A Treatise of the Figures of Grammar and Rhetoric</span> was published in 1555, and he also published a translation, no longer extant or datable, of <span class="italic">S. Basil the Great his Letter to Gregory Nazianzen</span>, &#145;shewing that many 100. years ago, certaine godly men began and used the life commonly called monasticall&#146;  (Ames, 1.677). <span class="italic">Schemes and Tropes</span> was addressed to Master Thomas Brooke esquire, probably the protestant activist of that name, and the work by Brentz to Lord Wentworth, a supporter of the earl of Warwick. These might suggest that Sherrey had protestant leanings, but the <span class="italic">Figures of Grammar</span> was dedicated to Sir William Paget, a supporter of Mary Tudor, and the translation of <span class="italic">Basil</span> looks like a work aimed at Catholics. It may be that the works were undertaken largely to earn money, or to attract the patronage of influential people of the day. Nothing is known of his death.<br>
<br>Sherrey shared a surname and London affiliation with <a name="cosubject_25388"></a><span class="headword">John Sherey</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1551), appointed <span class="occ">archdeacon of Lewes, Sussex</span>, in 1542, and precentor of St Paul's Cathedral, London, in 1543. John enjoyed the favour of Thomas Howard, duke of Norfolk, who presented him to the precentorship and to the rectory of Thackham, Sussex, which Sherey was holding in 1545. In that year he is also described as the duke's chaplain. Sherey held other benefices in the 1540s, including the rectory of Hayling, Hampshire, and the vicarages of Horsham and Worth, Sussex. His will, made on 1 August 1551, gave bequests to his poor parishioners, divided his books among three Sussex clergy, and left the majority of his lands and chattels to members of his family (among whom Richard Sherrey is not mentioned); he had died, unmarried, by 22 August.<br>
