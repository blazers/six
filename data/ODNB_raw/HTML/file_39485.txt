<span class="headword">Hill,  Micaiah John Muller</span>  (1856&#150;1929), <span class="occ">mathematician</span>, was born at Berhampore, Bengal, on 22 February 1856, the eldest son of the Revd Samuel John Hill, a missionary, and his wife, Leonora Josephine M&uuml;ller. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/33871/', "Sir George Francis Hill")</script>, numismatist, was his brother. After attending the School for the Sons of Missionaries, Blackheath, he entered University College, London, in October 1872. In 1874 he obtained his BA from the University of London, coming first in the mathematical honours list, and two years later was awarded the gold medal for his MA. In 1875 he entered Peterhouse, Cambridge, graduating as fourth wrangler and joint first Smith's prizeman in 1879. He briefly served as assistant to his old professor, Olaus Henrici, at University College before being appointed professor of mathematics at Mason College, Birmingham, in 1880. He made his final return to University College four years later when he was elected professor of pure mathematics.<br>
<br>Hill's research work concentrated on three main topics: hydrodynamics, differential equations, and the theory of proportion. In the first (in 1883&#150;94) he developed the theory of cylindrical vortices of finite section moving in an infinite fluid and published the solution for the axisymmetric spherical vortex, later known as Hill's vortex, the flow of which is somewhat similar to a smoke ring. Between 1888 and 1893 he investigated the various loci connected with first order differential equations and their complete primitives, obtaining many new and important results on the more general question of loci of singular points. Further papers on differential equations were published between 1916 and 1921. It was, however, the critical reappraisal of the fifth and sixth books of Euclid's <span class="italic">Elements</span> which was to dominate Hill's mathematical research. Inspired by problems experienced when teaching students the theory of proportion, his analysis is contained in five papers in the <span class="italic">Transactions of the Cambridge Philosophical Society</span> (1897&#150;1922), an edition of the two books in question (1900), and his book <span class="italic">The Theory of Proportion</span> (1914). In these works, by simplifying many of the proofs and deleting superfluous definitions and axioms, he was able successfully to reformulate Euclid's approach. Unfortunately, coinciding as it did with the period of Euclid's expulsion from the classroom, Hill's work was never properly appreciated.<br>
<br>Hill was a skilful and popular teacher. Infinitely patient, &#145;he possessed that rare quality, which students so keenly appreciate, of never slurring over difficulties: time spent on making a demonstration perfect was always to him time well spent&#146;  (Filon, <span class="italic">Journal of the London Mathematical Society</span>, 317). Described as &#145;one of the most commanding personalities&#146;  (Bellot, 390) of University College, he finally retired in 1923, although problems in finding a successor resulted in his staying on as acting professor for a further year.<br>
<br>A fellow of the Royal Society since 1894, Hill served on its council in 1911&#150;13, and was vice-president of the London Mathematical Society in 1894 and 1895. He also served on the senate of the University of London in 1900&#150;26, as vice-chancellor in 1909&#150;11. His last honour was to be president of the Mathematical Association in 1927&#150;8. He married Minnie Grace (1861&#150;1920), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/71089/', "Marriot Ogle Tarbotton")</script>, on 21 December 1892, and they had two sons, the eldest of whom was the renowned air force officer <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/33874/', "Sir Roderic Maxwell Hill")</script>, and a daughter. Illness left Hill totally blind for the last fifteen months of his life. He died at his home, 39 West Heath Drive, Golders Green, Middlesex, on 11 January 1929, and was cremated three days later at Golders Green crematorium.<br>
