<span class="headword">Coade,  Eleanor</span>  (1733&#150;1821), <span class="occ">manufacturer of artificial stone</span>, was born on 3 June 1733 in Exeter, the elder daughter (there were no sons) of George Coade, wool merchant, of Exeter, and his wife, Eleanor, daughter of Thomas Enchmarch, wool merchant, of Tiverton, Devon. She was brought up as a nonconformist. The family remained in Exeter until about 1760, when they moved to London. In the mid-1760s Eleanor was in business in the City on her own as a linen draper.<br>
<br>In 1769 George Coade died, bankrupt, and later in the year Eleanor joined Daniel Pincot, who was already established at Narrow Wall, Lambeth, making a form of artificial stone. They were there together until 1771, when Eleanor Coade sacked him for representing himself, instead of herself, as the proprietor of the factory. Shortly afterwards, she appointed <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/994/', "John Bacon (1740&#150;1799)")</script> as supervisor, and his neo-classical models set a very high standard of design. He designed for the firm until the end of his life in 1799.<br>
<br>Soon Eleanor Coade was working for all the eminent Georgian architects, including Robert Adam, James and Samuel Wyatt, Sir William Chambers, John Nash, and John Soane. A talented modeller, she exhibited at the Society of Artists between 1773 and 1780. As her mother's name was the same as her own, it has been mistakenly assumed that Mrs Coade, the mother, ran the factory until her death in 1796, but &#145;Mrs&#146; was a courtesy title for any unmarried woman in business at that time, and bills show that Eleanor Coade was in charge from 1771.<br>
<br>It was widely believed that Eleanor Coade had invented a new process for making artificial stone. Long thought to be a mystery, Coade stone is now known to be a ceramic material, and the British Museum research laboratory's analysis in 1985 showed that it was a form of stoneware so resistant to the weather that it is as precise today as when it was originally made. Its versatility allowed it to be used for all architectural details, commemorative and funerary monuments, fonts, statues, busts, coats of arms, chimney-pieces, garden ornaments, and furniture. Most is neo-classical, but there were also Gothic commissions such as Dalmeny House, Scotland, or Battle Abbey. Sizes range from the statue of Lord Hill in Shrewsbury (16 feet tall) to ornaments 1 inch long. Over six hundred and fifty examples have been traced, all over the British Isles, and in Canada, the United States, Brazil, and the Caribbean. Pieces were also sent to Russia, Poland, and South Africa.<br>
<br>In 1799 Eleanor Coade took as partner her cousin John Sealy, and the firm became Coade and Sealy. A showroom was opened at the east end of Westminster Bridge. Eleanor Coade had the royal appointment to George III, for whom she made the Gothic screen at St George's Chapel, Windsor, and to the prince of Wales, for whom, successively as prince regent and George IV, she did work at the first Royal Pavilion, Brighton, and Carlton House. Much work was done in the 1790s at the Royal Naval Hospital, Greenwich, and in 1810 work began on the pediment there, which was 40 feet long, designed by Benjamin West and Joseph Panzetta, and made in Coade stone. Sealy died in 1813, and Eleanor Coade appointed William Croggon as manager. The firm reverted to being Coade, and continued to flourish.<br>
<br>Eleanor Coade was unmarried. She died on 16 November 1821 in Camberwell, and rated an obituary notice in the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span>. Croggon bought the factory and made many thousands of pounds' worth of Coade stone for Buckingham Palace, but in the late 1830s trade declined, and the firm came to an end about 1840.<br>
