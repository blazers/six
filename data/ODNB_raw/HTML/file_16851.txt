<span class="headword">Lloyd,  Richard</span>  (1594/5&#150;1659), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, was the youngest of the five sons of David Lloyd, or Dafydd Llwyd (<i>d</i>. 1619), of Henblas, Anglesey, and his (second?) wife, Catherine, daughter of Richard Owen Tudor of Penmynydd. His father was a biblical scholar, linguist, and poet, and his mother was also an accomplished poet. He and his brothers were educated by their parents at home. He matriculated from Oriel College, Oxford, on 3 April 1612, aged seventeen, and &#145;took degrees in arts&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 3.472) before he proceeded BD on 7 May 1628. Like two of his brothers he became a clergyman, and, at an unknown date, minister of Sonning and of Tilehurst, Berkshire. At some point he married Joan Wickins; their elder son, Richard, may have been the Richard Lloyd baptized at Tilehurst on 28 August 1625; their younger son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16860/', "William Lloyd (1627&#150;1717)")</script>, the future bishop, was born at Tilehurst on 18 August 1627; they also had three daughters, who later married clergymen. When his sons matriculated at Oxford in March 1639, Lloyd was described as of Sonning, &#145;sacerd&#146;. At an unknown date he remarried, but no details of his second wife are known.<br>
<br>Anthony Wood says that during the civil war Lloyd was imprisoned four or five times because of &#145;the great affection and zeal he had for king Charles&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 3.472). He was imprisoned as a delinquent as early as February 1641. A Denbighshire nominee to the Westminster assembly on 25 April 1643, he was not included on the final list. At some unspecified date in the 1640s he spent a period in hiding in woods near Tilehurst to escape the attentions of parliamentary soldiers. During that decade he was sequestered and retired to Oxford where he taught a private school for several years in the parish of St Peter-le-Bailey; in December 1651 he was described as &#145;late of Englefield&#146;. He published <span class="italic">An English Grammar</span> (1652), <span class="italic">Artis poeticae</span> (1652), and <span class="italic">The Latine Grammar</span> (1653), and in 1654 he produced a combined English and Latin grammar entitled <span class="italic">The Schoole-Masters Auxilaries</span>. In March 1656, described as &#145;of Maidenhead&#146;, he was lodging at the Queens Arms at Holborn Bridge, London, but he left London for Oxford on 1 April. He died in 1659 and was buried at St Peter-le-Bailey, Oxford, in June that year.<br>
