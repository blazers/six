<span class="headword">Ziff,  (Israel) Arnold</span>  (1927&#150;2004), <span class="occ">businessman and philanthropist</span>, was born on 31 January 1927 at 28 Grange Avenue, Chapeltown, Leeds, the only son of Max Ziff (<i>d.</i> 1954), a boot manufacturer and retailer, and his wife, Annie, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Gilston. His family had moved to Leeds from Russia in the early years of the twentieth century. Arnold, as he was usually known, attended Roundhay grammar school in north Leeds before studying economics at the University of Leeds for one undistinguished year. He served in the Royal Army Ordnance Corps in the final months of the Second World War and as a staff sergeant assigned himself to an eight-month posting in Paris before he was demobilized in 1947. On 23 June 1952 he married Marjorie Esther Morrison, daughter of Jack Morrison, company director, at the New West End Synagogue in Paddington, London; the couple had one daughter, Ann, and two sons, Michael and Edward.<br>
<br>As a businessman Ziff energetically pursued two strands of activity. The origin of the first of these&#151;the family shoe business, Stylo&#151;can be traced to the small shop, selling Leeds-made footwear, opened by his aunt Fanny soon after her arrival in the city at the turn of the century. After the First World War her four brothers, including Max Ziff, expanded the business, added production to the retailing component, and in 1935 formed the Stylo Boot Company. On leaving the army Arnold Ziff joined the family enterprise and took responsibility for maintaining and augmenting the portfolio of shops. Such was his success in this sphere that he was promoted to managing director on his father's death in 1954, and served as the company's chairman from 1967 until 2000, when his elder son, Michael, already chief executive, took over. Under Ziff's management, Stylo (which later became Stylo plc but remained firmly in family hands) developed as a multiple shoe retail group. In 1964 it acquired the Northampton firm W. Barratt which extended the company's profile to southern England, and followed this with the takeover of Priceless (discount footwear outlets) in 1995, Hush Puppy from Sear in 1996, and Shelly's footwear chain in 2003. Ziff's acquisitions consolidated the company's position at the lower price end of the market and by the time of his death Stylo was one of the country's largest independent footwear retailers, with 100 shops and 6000 employees.<br>
<br>Ziff's knowledge of real estate, gained during his tours of northern England for Stylo, provided the foundation of the second element of his commercial enterprise. In 1959 he established Town Centre Securities (TCS), a retail property investment and development company, with capital of &pound;1000. The company benefited considerably from a property boom which followed the period of post-war austerity: eighteen months after its creation it went public valued at &pound;250,000. In 1964 TCS completed the innovative Merrion Centre in Leeds, then Britain's largest covered shopping centre and a major factor in the city's subsequent regeneration. The activity of TCS focused on the north of England and Scotland but also included the Maltings shopping and entertainment precinct in Salisbury. Early twenty-first century projects included the Eastgate and Harewood Quarter development in Leeds and the regeneration of Manchester's Piccadilly Basin, which was facilitated by Ziff's bold purchase of shares in the Rochdale Canal Company in the 1960s.<br>
<br>Ziff sought to use his wealth and business acumen for the benefit of others. As a committed Jew he aimed to enhance the lives of his co-religionists in Leeds, but his philanthropic work was by no means confined to Jewish causes. It embraced a wide range of local welfare, medical, sporting, educational, historic, and artistic endeavours; and took a variety of forms which included straightforward and generous financial donation but more commonly involved fund-raising and motivating others. His early charitable work, however, was shaped by his father's commitment to the Leeds Jewish Board of Guardians (subsequently renamed the Leeds Jewish Welfare Board). Following Max's death Arnold Ziff acquired positions of responsibility on the board and strove particularly to combat loneliness and isolation among the community's most disadvantaged members. He was the board's president for twenty years from 1968 and at the same time worked tirelessly for the Leeds Jewish Housing Association. Among his many other contributions to the city Ziff was instrumental in the acquisition of a whole-body scanner for St James's Hospital (raising &pound;1 million in six months) and served on the appeal committee of Leeds parish church, as patron of the Leeds Civic Trust, and as vice-president of the Leeds international piano competition. His passion for the arts was reflected in both individual and institutional support, and included the gift of a Steinway grand piano for the University of Leeds' concert hall. The business studies departments of both of the city's universities also benefited from Ziff's munificence, with an endowed Arnold Ziff chair in retailing at Leeds Metropolitan University and through his energetic fund-raising for the new business school at the University of Leeds. Ziff's commitment to charitable enterprise and artistic and educational pursuits was shared with his wife, Marjorie, and is recognized in the Marjorie and Arnold Ziff Community Centre, which opened in north Leeds in 2005, and the Marjorie and Arnold Ziff building at the University of Leeds. In recognition of his numerous contributions, Ziff was appointed a JP in 1967, OBE in 1981, and high sheriff of West Yorkshire in 1991. Although he did not graduate when a student, he later received honorary degrees from the University of Leeds (1993) and Leeds Metropolitan University (2003). He died of bronchopneumonia, congestive cardiac failure, and ischaemic heart disease on 14 July 2004 at St James's University Hospital, Leeds. He was survived by his wife and two sons, and succeeded as chairman of TCS by Edward Ziff.<br>
