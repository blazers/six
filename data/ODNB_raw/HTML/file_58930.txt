<span class="headword">Jacqueline</span> <span class="st"> [Jacqueline of Bavaria]</span>, <i>suo jure</i> countess of Hainault, <i>suo jure</i> countess of Holland, and <i>suo jure</i> countess of Zeeland  (1401&#150;1436), <span class="occ">princess</span>, was born at The Hague, on or shortly before 16 July 1401, the only daughter of Guillaume (VI), count of Hainault, of Holland, and of Zeeland (1365&#150;1417), and of Marguerite (1374&#150;1441), eldest daughter of Philip the Bold, duke of Burgundy. She thus embodied a Burgundian dynastic coup: the double union between the houses of Valois&#150;Burgundy and Wittelsbach&#150;Holland, made in April 1385. Her Wittelsbach ancestry explains frequent references to her as Jacqueline of Bavaria. In June 1406 Jacqueline was betrothed, and on 6 August 1415 married, to Jean, duke of Touraine (<i>b</i>. 1398). Jean succeeded his elder brother Louis as dauphin that December, only to die in April 1417.<br>
<br>The following August, three months after the death of her father, Jacqueline was betrothed to her first cousin John (IV), duke of Brabant (1403&#150;1427). The marriage required a papal dispensation, which was vigorously opposed by Sigismund, king of the Romans, and only confirmed by Martin V in January 1418: the ceremony took place on 8 March. John, however, proved powerless to prevent Jacqueline's uncle, Johann of Bavaria, bishop-elect of Li&egrave;ge, from the forcible pursuit of his claim to Holland and Zeeland, territories long divided by factional politics. By November 1417 the bishop had resigned his see and set himself up as count in Dordrecht, precipitating civil war. John (IV) was unwilling to intervene, agreeing instead to a humiliating truce at Woudrichem in February 1419, the terms of which Jacqueline refused to accept.<br>
<br>When, in April 1420, her husband mortgaged Holland and Zeeland and began to interfere with the management of her household, Jacqueline fled from Brussels to her mother's court in Hainault and began to seek outside assistance. In February 1421 she formally repudiated John (IV) and travelled to Westminster under a safe conduct granted by Henry V who had previously sent envoys to Le Quesnoy to gain her trust, and evidently saw her as a thoroughly useful ally. Jacqueline was provided with a monthly income of &pound;100 on the dower estates of Henry's stepmother, Joan, and was invited to be godmother to the infant Prince Henry. Lured by the prospect of a European adventure, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/14155/', "Humphrey, duke of Gloucester (1390&#150;1447)")</script>, temporarily abandoned his political ambitions in England in support of Jacqueline's cause. The couple may have married in 1422, but the event was clandestine, and although rumour attributed it to either 13 August or 25 October, after a dispensation had been obtained from the antipope Benedict XIII, neither date can be confirmed. All that can be said with confidence is that the marriage had taken place by the end of January 1423. In October 1424 they landed an army at Calais and swiftly moved to take possession of Hainault: however, they met opposition from Philip the Good, duke of Burgundy, who was now allied to John (IV) and determined to capture the Wittelsbach inheritance for himself. Johann of Bavaria's death in January 1425 gave Philip a freer hand to act against Jacqueline. He launched a counter-invasion of Hainault in April, as a result of which Humphrey abandoned his wife to Burgundian custody. Jacqueline was taken to Ghent to await a papal pronouncement on the validity of her marriages, but in September escaped to Gouda, where she rallied a faction against the Burgundians and renewed the Dutch civil war in alliance with the bishop of Utrecht.<br>
<br>Jacqueline's entreaties for English aid went largely unanswered, however. Unwilling to offend Philip, the regency council preferred to negotiate a settlement rather than engage Burgundian forces. She was thus left powerless to prevent Philip's assumption of control in Hainault after the death of John (IV) in April 1427. She still maintained a strong position in North Holland, but this was irrevocably weakened in January 1428, when Martin V ruled that her marriage to John (IV) had alone been valid. Humphrey took this opportunity to abandon his costly adventure and to marry his mistress, Eleanor Cobham, in May: now deprived of the English bluff she had been playing, Jacqueline was forced to sue for peace. By the treaty of Delft in July she agreed to recognize Philip as guardian of and heir to all her territories, which were to be administered by a jointly appointed regency council.<br>
<br>Jacqueline, however, refused to accept a quiet life: in the summer of 1432 she contracted a secret marriage with Frank van Borselen (<i>d</i>. 1470), governor of Holland and Zeeland since 1430. This contravened the terms of the treaty, and Borselen was swiftly imprisoned: the situation was resolved only in April 1433, when Jacqueline agreed to an immediate abdication of all her territorial rights and had her marriage confirmed. Thereafter she retreated to her well-appointed castle of Teijlingen, where she was free to indulge a passion for hunting. According to Dutch tradition, she also took up pottery, fashioning a distinctive style of long-necked jar.<br>
<br>Jacqueline died childless on 8 October 1436, after a long illness, presumed consumptive. She had requested burial in her lordship of Sint-Maartensdijk in Zeeland, but her mother insisted on a funeral held later the same month in the court chapel in The Hague, an arrangement which, for once, Jacqueline was unable to defy. Though biographers were later to romanticize her career, few have yet addressed her remarkable strength of character, or her utter refusal to act as a dynastic pawn.<br>
