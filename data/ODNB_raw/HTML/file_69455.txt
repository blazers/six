<span class="headword">Davis,  Richard</span>  (1617/18&#150;1693<span class="mult">x</span>1700), <span class="occ">bookseller</span>, was baptized at All Saints' Church in Oxford on 16 August 1618, the third of eight children of William Davis (<i>fl</i>. 1609&#150;1651), bookseller, and his wife, Mary (<i>d</i>. 1651). In December 1639 Richard followed his father by becoming a licensed university bookseller (&#145;stationer&#146;), as later did his brother Nicholas; their elder brother Thomas graduated from the university. Over the next few decades Richard Davis became Oxford's leading bookseller. Besides large holdings in theology, medicine, law, and the sciences, his stock&#151;which included works from many continental presses&#151;ranged from the esoteric (a Turkish grammar, a Syro-Chaldean dictionary, histories of Lapland and Barbados) to books on cookery or the propagation of vegetables. Aeschylus and Eusebius shared shelf space with Chaucer, Shakespeare, Milton, and Restoration drama. Among his customers were the antiquaries William Fulman (who bought and borrowed books by courier) and Anthony Wood.<br>
<br>From 1646 onwards Davis also made a major contribution to academic publishing, being solely or partly responsible for over 250 books; many, including works by Boyle, were scientific. Such was his reputation that when plague prevented the Royal Society from publishing three numbers of its <span class="italic">Philosophical Transactions</span> in London, they turned to Davis to produce them.<br>
<br>Davis's shop and home&#151;the present 14&#150;15 Oriel Street, Oxford&#151;were leased him by Lincoln College, but in 1663 he also rented the old Congregation House from the university as a warehouse for his expanding stock. Soon afterwards drunken undergraduates on their way home late one night were puzzled to see a light in the building at that hour, and suspected an illegal conventicle; they thought these suspicions confirmed when, listening at the window, they heard Davis say &#145;O the <span class="roman">bible</span>! I had almost forgot the <span class="roman">bible</span>&#146;. A proctor and other dons were hastily summoned, but they &#145;going with great speed and bursting open the doors &hellip; found none but Mr. Richard Davis the bookseller and his wife and boy looking out books to exchange at London&#146;  (<span class="italic">Life and Times of Anthony Wood</span>, 1.509).<br>
<br>Davis's first wife was dead by 21 April 1685, when he married Susannah Adams (1627/8&#150;1700), widow&#151;probably a connection, though not the relict, of his friend the bookseller John Adams. Wood sourly implies that this explains the subsequent collapse of Davis's business, since the following August he &#145;shut up his shopwindows for debt&#146;  (<span class="italic">Life and Times of Anthony Wood</span>, 3.157), but the expenses of Davis's publishing ventures are a more likely cause. His stock of over 40,000 books was sold off in four great sales (the catalogues of which survive) from 1686 to 1692. A contemporary pamphlet describes the interest these aroused, libraries and lecture halls emptying as scholars flocked to the saleroom. In spite of his reissue of three works in 1690, the bankruptcy effectively marked the end of Davis's career. In March 1693, when he was seventy-five, he was summoned as a witness in a libel suit; his signature is found in the records of the trial, but he had little information to give. Probably by February 1695 he was dead, for another tenant rented his house. He was certainly dead by 1700, when his widow died at the age of seventy-two.<br>
