<span class="headword">Williams,  Edward</span>  (1750&#150;1813), <span class="occ">Independent minister and tutor</span>, was born at Glan Clwyd, Denbighshire, on 14 November 1750, the son of Thomas Williams, a farmer, and his wife, Ann, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Williams. He was educated at St Asaph grammar school and then at Caerwys grammar school, for a year. He was intended for the church but came under the influence of the local Methodists, headed by the minister Daniel Lloyd. While studying with David Ellis, curate at Derwen, he attended Methodist meetings. He joined the Independent church at Denbigh, where he began to preach, and in 1771 entered the dissenting academy at Abergavenny, under Benjamin Davis.<br>
<br>Williams was ordained minister on 27 March 1776 at the Independent church at Ross-on-Wye, where he remained until September 1777, when he settled as minister at Oswestry. He kept a school in Oswestry and in 1781 began educating students for the ministry on Lady Glenorchy's foundation. In the same year he was invited to succeed Benjamin Davis as principal of Abergavenny academy. Concerned that ministerial training should be made available to students from north Wales, he accepted the post but stipulated that the academy should move to Oswestry. His advocacy of theological moderation, exemplified in <span class="italic">Antipaedobaptism Examined</span> (1789), brought him into conflict with the Baptist Abraham Booth, who firmly opposed infant baptism. Williams was very active in founding Sunday schools in Wales, thirteen of which had been established by 1797.<br>
<br>In 1792 Williams was called to the Carrs Lane Independent Church in Birmingham, where he remained for three years. He then took up his last charge, as minister of Masbrough Independent Church, in Yorkshire. In 1795 his wife, Mary Llewellyn, whom he married in 1777, died, and the following year he married Jane Yeomans (<i>d</i>. 1823). At Masbrough, Williams kept a school and worked as principal of the Yorkshire Independent academy. He was tireless in promoting his faith and church in the region, and a number of new Independent congregations were formed under his influence. Having been awarded the degree of DD by Edinburgh University in 1792 he helped to found and edit the <span class="italic">Evangelical Magazine</span> in 1793. The most significant of his publications, <span class="italic">An Essay on the Equity of Divine Government and the Sovereignty of Divine Grace</span> (1809), strove to &#145;bring Calvinism in harmony with the evangelical preaching of the day, which emphasized the universal application of Christ's sacrifice&#146;  (Owen, 2.1195) and is regarded as one of the founding texts of the moderate Calvinist school of theology.<br>
<br>Williams died at Rotherham on 9 March 1813, and was buried at Masbrough church. His collected works were edited by Evan Davis and published in four volumes in 1862.<br>
