<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Boece <span class="st"> [Boethius]</span>,  Hector</span>  (<em>c.</em>1465&#150;1536), <span class="occ">historian and college head</span>, was born in Dundee into the Boyis or Bois family of Panbride in Angus (Forfarshire): Boethius is a Latinized version of the original name and Boece a retranslation. His father was probably Alexander Boyis (<i>fl</i>. 1460&#150;1500), a burgess of Dundee, whose name appears in the register of the great seal between 1481 and 1487.<h2>
<a name="Familybackgroundandeducation"></a>Family background and education</h2>According to Boece his great-grandfather Hugh had received the lands at Panbride in 1332 through marriage with an heiress, as recognition of his father's death at Dupplin that year, fighting for David II. Boece, however, consistently refers to himself as Deidonanus and refers to Dundee as his <i>patria</i>, suggesting that his own family was a cadet branch. His father was none the less wealthy enough to put at least three sons through advanced schooling and to send two for further study in Paris; among Hector's colleagues at King's College in Aberdeen was his brother Arthur, a scholar of civil law, and nearby was another brother, Walter, the priest at St Mary's ad Nives, the parish church of Old Aberdeen. There may well have been other brothers, since other Boises appear in the records in the early years of the sixteenth century; without doubt, the family were important members of Dundee society.<br>
<br>After his initial education, probably at Dundee grammar school, Boece went to the University of Paris, specifically to the Coll&egrave;ge de Montaigu, probably not later than 1485. Montaigu was then under the leadership of Jan Standonc, a native of Mechelen in Brabant and an austere man, who ran the college under the rules of poverty and discipline. There, as well as following the traditional arts course, Boece met many men who were to make their own mark on Scottish affairs, as he commemorates in his description of his time in Paris in his own <span class="italic">Vitae episcoporum Aberdonensium et Murthlacensium</span>. They included John Mair, the scholastic philosopher and fellow historiographer, Patrick Paniter, private secretary to James IV, and George Dundas, later the master of the knights of St John of Jerusalem in Scotland. In addition he also met and struck up a friendship with the great humanist Desiderius Erasmus, receiving from him the dedication of Erasmus's only volume of poetry (1495). Through his acquaintance with Erasmus it is possible that Boece gained an introduction to some of the humanist circles in Paris, including that of Robert Gaguin, who was both a historian of France and a translator of Julius Caesar. After he returned to Scotland, Boece seems not to have maintained any degree of intimacy with Erasmus, though he wrote to him in 1528 when the Dutch humanist had been condemned by the Sorbonne, commending one of his books and assuring him of his esteem. While there was little enough that Boece could do for his old acquaintance, doubtless Erasmus was pleased by any show of support.<h2>
<a name="Aberdeen"></a>Aberdeen</h2>Boece completed his MA in 1492, when he is likely to have been in his late twenties, and thereafter remained at Montaigu as a regent while studying for his degree in theology. Then in 1497 William Elphinstone, bishop of Aberdeen, invited Boece to come to Aberdeen to teach liberal arts at the recently founded King's College. Elphinstone's university was designed to serve the north-east of Scotland and also to provide education for laymen as well as those intending to go into the church. In choosing Boece and his associates as the first teachers Elphinstone was aligning King's College both with humanist study of the arts and also with an austere and orthodox position in religion, an alignment which was evident in the teaching of liberal arts, more particularly of theology, within the college. Once Elphinstone had obtained the foundation charter for King's College, granted on 17 September 1505, he nominated Boece as first principal of the university. The appointment could not have been made previously, since one of the requirements of the principal was that he should hold a master's degree, or at the very least a bachelor's degree, in theology, a qualification Boece could have attained only a little earlier. As principal Boece received a substantial salary, with board and lodging, in return for wide-ranging duties which included administering the finances and the practical running of the college, monitoring the behaviour of teachers and students alike as well as the quality of the lectures. He also acted as the first librarian, an office not laid down in the foundation charters but evident from Boece's signatures and comments on many of the early volumes currently belonging to Aberdeen University Library. He was responsible for teaching theology and arts, and for preaching publicly in the vernacular six times a year. Boece seems to have performed these duties well, keeping the college together after Elphinstone's death in 1514, and furthering its development under Gavin Dunbar, bishop of Aberdeen from 1518 to 1532. As well as being principal Boece was a canon of the cathedral, rector of Tyrie from at least 1509, vicar of Tullynessle by 1528, and chaplain of the altar of St Ninian in the town's kirk of Aberdeen.<h2>
<a name="Minorwritings"></a>Minor writings</h2>Despite being committed to all these positions Boece continued his own intellectual development. Shortly after gaining his first qualification in theology he also finished his bachelorship in medicine, for he describes himself as a medical graduate in a document dated 1 October 1506. There is only one anecdote of his practising medicine, dating from 1535, late in his life, when he was summoned to the bedside of Thomas Crystall, abbot of Kinloss. Unfortunately Crystall was dying, and Boece was unable to do more than note his condition and ease his passing. Boece's interest in medicine is, however, evident in his writings, where there are some professional considerations of disease and causes of death; his library contained Galen's <span class="italic">Thegnis, seu, Ars medica</span> and Pliny the elder's <span class="italic">Historia naturalis</span>, two standard medical textbooks of the period. Boece also continued his studies in theology, becoming a doctor in the subject in 1528. More famously he also undertook several literary projects. His first book, on logic, was <span class="italic">Explicatio quorundam vocabulorum ad cognitionem dialecticos conducentium opera</span>, and was printed probably in Paris, in 1519; only one copy, in Glasgow University Library, seems to survive. It has been described as an undergraduate textbook, sound in its approach and particularly strong in the area of inference. That Boece should publish on logic demonstrates that no matter how enthusiastic he was in his devotion to the <i>studia humanitatis</i>, his thinking was none the less deeply imbued with scholastic modes of thinking, particularly in philosophy and theology.<br>
<br>Boece's other works are better known and clearly aspire to humanist models of historiography. The first, <span class="italic">Vitae episcoporum Aberdonensium et Murthlacensium</span>, was printed in Paris in 1522 by Jodocus Badius Ascensius, a printer from the Low Countries who seems to have been a favourite among Scottish writers. Possibly modelled on Bartolomeo Platina's <span class="italic">Lives of the Popes</span>, a copy of which Boece owned, Boece's <span class="italic">Lives of the Bishops of Aberdeen</span> is primarily a biography of Bishop Elphinstone, whose life takes up nearly half the volume. While the tone of Boece's account tends towards the hagiographic, it nevertheless provides detailed information on the foundation of King's College and on Elphinstone's actions as bishop. The discussion of Elphinstone and King's College was also designed as a goad to Gavin Dunbar, bishop of Aberdeen when the work was published, since it highlights works still to be completed or even undertaken for the benefit of the university. The lives of the earlier bishops are treated more cursorily, though there is more detail as the account approaches Boece's own time. The work demonstrates several of the concerns which were to underwrite Boece's second historiographical work, the <span class="italic">Scotorum historia</span>, namely the use of antiquity, the relationship of church and state, the importance of morality for rulers, and finally humanist style.<h2>
<a name="TheScotorumhistoriapurposeandreception"></a>The Scotorum historia: purpose and reception</h2>Boece's greater work is <span class="italic">Scotorum historiae a prima gentis origine libri xvii</span>. Published in Paris at the author's expense in 1527, again by Ascensius, the <span class="italic">Scotorum historia</span> (as it is generally known) is an account of the Scottish people from their very earliest origins and the foundation of the Scottish realm in Scotland in 330 <span class="smallcap">BC</span> until the death of James I and the capture and punishment of his murderers in 1438. In seventeen books, it takes the form of a dramatic narrative, with speeches before battle, councils, and embassies, in its style emulating classical historiography as exemplified by Livy and thus also contemporary humanist practice as seen in the writings of such men as Marcantonio Sabellico and Paolo Emilio. Boece also makes use of the latest in humanist learning in presenting the recently rediscovered <span class="italic">Agricola</span> and <span class="italic">Annales</span> of Tacitus as a source. With some help from Tacitus, Boece presents the Scots as a people of antique virtue and unyielding independence, notably through an unbroken line of kings. Throughout the narrative Boece draws attention to the connection he perceives between the austere virtue and devotion to duty of the ruler and good government. That poor rulers, especially in the earlier books, are frequently punished and deposed for their failures and misdeeds does not necessarily mean that Boece himself was a republican or a particularly radical republican, even though that was the interpretation applied to his work by George Buchanan; rather it falls into the category of more general &#145;advice to princes&#146;, common in Scottish literature and historiography, and with an awareness of conciliarist arguments.<br>
<br>The <span class="italic">Scotorum historia</span> is dedicated to James V, to whom Boece presented a copy at its first publication. In return the king rewarded Boece with an annual pension of &pound;50 Scots, which was afterwards doubled, and he also commissioned John Bellenden to make the first translation of the work into Scots. When searching for an account of the Scots to inform his new queen, Madeleine, James seems also to have chosen the <span class="italic">Scotorum historia</span> as the basis of a French version. The king's enthusiasm for Boece's account was repeated elsewhere. The Latin edition was reprinted in 1574 and again in 1575 in Lausanne, though circulated from Paris, under the guidance of Giovanni Ferrerio, who met Boece while he was resident at Kinloss Abbey. The later editions contain two further books, 18 and 19, which brought the account up to the death of James III. Ferrerio explains that the additional books remained incomplete at Boece's death, and himself completes the account of James III with a brief annal. Although the additional books are slight there is no reason to doubt that they are of Boece's composition. Narrative sources for the second half of the fifteenth century seem to have been scarce, and perhaps Boece's age disinclined him for extensive research. Polydore Vergil used the <span class="italic">Scotorum historia</span> as an occasional source for his <span class="italic">Historia Anglica</span> (1534), while both John Lesley's <span class="italic">De origine, moribus et rebus gestis Scotorum</span> (1578) and George Buchanan's <span class="italic">Rerum Scoticarum historia</span> (1582) depended heavily upon it.<br>
<br>The <span class="italic">Scotorum historia</span> proved just as popular in the vernacular. After completing his first translation of the work for James V, Bellenden embarked on a second, printed in Edinburgh around 1535 to 1540 and allegedly corrected by Boece himself. It is unclear whether this assertion is in fact true, since Bellenden did not translate the additional books, nor do the alterations made for the second translation appear to move the translation closer to the original Latin. However, Bellenden's printed text circulated quite widely, not least to the compilers of Holinshed's <span class="italic">Chronicles</span>, and hence to Shakespeare. There are two further translations of the <span class="italic">Scotorum historia</span>, both nearly contemporary with Bellenden's versions. The first, in pentameter couplets, was composed by William Stewart, a courtier of James V; the second, written in prose, is known as the <span class="roman">Mar Lodge Translation</span>, since the manuscript in which it appears does not contain the name of the author. There are also at least two continuations, one by John Lesley and the other by Robert Lindsay of Pitscottie, suggesting that they at least perceived the <span class="italic">Scotorum historia</span> as the standard account of the Scottish past.<h2>
<a name="TheScotorumhistoriacriticsandcommentators"></a>The Scotorum historia: critics and commentators</h2>Despite the popularity and immense influence of the <span class="italic">Scotorum historia</span> in its various forms, it has always had its critics. On its first publication, other historiographers, particularly those from England such as John Leland and John Bale, criticized its presentation of Arthur and the Brutus myth, crucial to their own versions of the English past. More recent critics have remarked upon Boece's style and approach, contrasting it unfavourably with that of his contemporary at the Coll&egrave;ge de Montaigu, John Mair. In his <span class="italic">Historia majoris Britanniae, tam Angliae quam Scotiae</span> (1521), Mair eschews ornate oratory, dismisses the origin myths of both England and Scotland, and applies his logic to arguing his case for the union of the crowns; so great is the difference between the two works that it has been suggested that the <span class="italic">Scotorum historia</span> was written with the particular purpose of answering the arguments in <span class="italic">Historia majoris Britanniae</span>. However, references to the <span class="italic">Scotorum historia</span> in Boece's <span class="italic">Lives</span> demonstrate that the author was composing his <span class="italic">Scotorum historia</span> before the publication of <span class="italic">Historia majoris Britanniae</span>, and moreover that the two works&#151;both published by Ascensius&#151;seem designed to serve different functions: Mair's argues a strongly held political cause, while Boece's belongs to the humanist fashion for historiography on a grand scale to affirm national identity.<br>
<br>The most serious criticism of the <span class="italic">Scotorum historia</span> has always been focused on Boece's identification of his sources for his account of the early history of the Scots, among whom he cites Elphinstone as well as Veremundus, Cornelius Hibernicus, and John Campbell. No writings by men of these last three names survive, and it is common to question whether such material ever existed independently of Boece. Forgery of this kind was not unknown in the period, and Boece's line of forty kings neatly fills the gap left by his predecessors John Fordun and Walter Bower. It is also clear that the continuous kingship of the Scots underpins Boece's presentation of Scottish identity. Queries about the nature of Veremundus and the others first appear in the sixteenth century, particularly around Buchanan's use of Boece's early narrative. Some commentators, such as Humphrey Lhuyd, were still enthusiastic supporters of the Brutus myth, but others, such as John Twyne, raised serious questions about the authority and nature of Boece's sources.<br>
<br>The first detailed analysis of Boece's history was undertaken by Thomas Innes in <span class="italic">A Critical Essay on the Ancient Inhabitants of the Northern Parts of Britain or Scotland</span> (1729). As a Jacobite, Innes also had a political agenda to meet, but as a scholar he identified the major deficiencies of Boece's narrative: that there is no corroboration for the sources (later references by David Chambres in his <span class="italic">Histoire abreg&eacute;e</span> are unreliable, since most of the information on the Scottish past is taken from the <span class="italic">Scotorum historia</span>); that Boece used the genealogies contained in Fordun's <span class="italic">Chronica</span> and turned them into king-lists; and that some of Boece's material contradicts Roman accounts and other versions of events. Innes believed that Boece's intention was to convince his audience that the deposition of unsatisfactory monarchs had always been part of Scottish government, and that he had invented authorities and manipulated his material to prove it. Innes's view that Boece's sources could not be what he claimed them to be prevailed for the next two centuries, though opinion was divided as to whether Boece had fabricated his authorities as Innes claimed, or whether he had been deceived by a forgery. In the nineteenth century only William Skene considered the possibility of Veremundus's existence. Recent study, however, both of early Scottish historiography and of Boece himself, has suggested that Boece may have been neither a forger nor a dupe.<br>
<br>Since the first edition of the <span class="italic">Scotorum historia</span> stopped its account in 1438, and since the later books in the second edition are so curtailed, the work is a disappointing witness for events in Scotland during Boece's lifetime. There are some interesting anecdotes, such as how Boece's ancestors came to Angus, the action of Katherine Douglas in trying to protect James I by using her arm as a door-bar, and an unexpectedly positive summary of James III in the catalogue of kings at the beginning of the narrative, but nothing more substantial. Boece's <span class="italic">Vitae</span>, however, is different, being a major source for the life of Elphinstone. Although designed to praise rather than to criticize, this work does offer some insights into Scottish affairs in the late fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries, particularly as they affected Aberdeen. Otherwise Boece's principal contribution to modern understanding of his own time is to be found in his expression of the nature of good government and his presentation of national identity.<h2>
<a name="Personalityandlikenesses"></a>Personality and likenesses</h2>As well as being respected for his literary and administrative achievements Boece seems to have been well liked. He was accompanied to Aberdeen by two of his brothers, and by his schoolfriend William Hay, who succeeded him as principal at King's College. He is also recorded as acting as defence in a case in Dundee in 1522, though his advocacy appears to have been unsuccessful. On 5 September 1528 Aberdeen town council awarded him a present of either a tun of wine or else &pound;20 to buy bonnets. Elphinstone evidently made a good choice in the first principal of his new university. There survive two likenesses identified as Boece. One came into the possession of King's College in the early nineteenth century and is reproduced as the frontispiece to the collective volume published in 1937 as <span class="italic">Quatercentenary of the Death of Hector Boece</span>; it represents a cleric dressed in the garments of the seventeenth century, and is unlikely to be Boece. The other, also in the possession of the University of Aberdeen, is older and is more likely, though not definitely, the principal. The last mention of Boece in the surviving records was made in 1532, when he witnessed the marriage settlement of Isabella Boyiss, assumed to be a niece. He had died by November 1536, when the king awarded the rectory of Tyrie to another man. He was buried in King's College chapel, where his tombstone is still visible. On the outside of the chapel is his coat of arms together with his initials and a notice of his date of death&#151;<i>ob. 1536</i>.<br>
