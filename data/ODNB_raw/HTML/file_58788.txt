<span class="headword">Forde,  (Cyril) Daryll</span>  (1902&#150;1973), <span class="occ">anthropologist</span>, was born on 16 March 1902 at 38 Manchester Road, Tottenham, Middlesex, the son of the Revd John Percival Daniel Forde, schoolmaster, and his wife, Caroline Pearce Pittman. He went to Middlesex county school at Tottenham and then to the geography department of University College, London, from where he graduated in 1922. There in 1923 he was appointed a lecturer in geography, and in 1928 was awarded a PhD in prehistoric archaeology. At this period both geography and anatomy at University College had research interests in ethnography and archaeology, and Forde found himself welcome in both disciplines. He was also in the student set associated with the Bloomsbury group. Though he was intellectually closer to the archaeologist Gordon Childe, it was through Sir Grafton Elliot Smith in anatomy that Forde met both the psychologist W. H. R. Rivers (for whose posthumously published books Forde drew the maps) and the distinguished Californian anthropologist R. H. Lowie. Forde spent 1928&#150;30 as Commonwealth fellow in anthropology with Lowie at Berkeley, working on American Indian economies. The twenty-eight-year-old Forde was recognized as <i>the</i> up-and-coming geographer, and at a time when air travel was still unusual, he was flown over from California to be offered the chair of geography and anthropology at the University of Aberystwyth.<br>
<br>Forde's academic career falls into four periods. The first, from 1923 to 1934, culminated in the publication of his major general text, <span class="italic">Habitat, Economy and Society</span> (1934). He was already recognized as an innovative archaeologist with his study on Welsh megaliths; at Aberystwyth he pioneered &#145;anthropology at home&#146; by initiating ethnographic studies of Welsh villages and towns. But his reading had shown him how little was really known about African economies. With the recently established International Institute for African Languages and Culture sending out researchers like Meyer Fortes to an acephalous community in northern Gold Coast, and S. F. Nadel to a complex state in northern Nigeria, in 1935 Forde opted instead for something in between&#151;a &#145;village&#146; of 10,000 Yak&ouml; in south-eastern Nigeria, whose kinship system (&#145;double unilineal descent&#146;) was particularly interesting for lineage theorists. Forde's second period (1935&#150;43) was interrupted by the Second World War. His curtailed fieldwork on Yak&ouml; marriage was none the less published in 1941. In the same year he was posted to the Foreign Office research department (then in Oxford), heading the section on the USA. He returned to Aberystwyth in 1943.<br>
<br>The third period, from 1944 to 1956, saw Forde appointed in 1944 to the post of part-time director of the renamed International African Institute in London; in 1945 was added the chair of the newly established department of anthropology at University College, London. He held both posts until 1969. As director he had to rebuild an institute crippled by war. The need for an up-to-date understanding of the societies of post-war Africa was obvious, especially with the new emphasis on economic development and calls for self-government. In 1946 Forde wrote, with R. Scott, <span class="italic">The Native Economies of Nigeria</span>. He devised an extended practical programme of research and publication (in English and French), and negotiated funding from government and from UNESCO. In nearly sixty volumes, the <span class="italic">Ethnographic Survey</span> under Forde's direction systematized existing ethnographic data, region by region; a similar, smaller series, <span class="roman">Handbooks of African Languages</span>, was produced; ethnographic monographs were published; <span class="italic">African Abstracts</span> regularly summarized the periodical literature; and the institute's quarterly journal, <span class="italic">Africa</span>, which Forde edited, again became the leading journal in the field. Of the symposia from this period, <span class="italic">African Systems of Kinship and Marriage</span> (1950) and <span class="italic">African Worlds</span> (1954) remain outstanding.<br>
<br>In his fourth period (1957&#150;69) Forde analysed Yak&ouml; ritual and belief, publishing <span class="italic">Yak&ouml; Studies</span> (1964). More importantly, he raised funds from the Ford Foundation for a series of international seminars, bringing together in different African countries scholars from America, Europe, and Africa. With new universities established in Africa and with independence near, these nine seminars (and the resulting volumes) were path-breaking, assembling the latest ideas and research in key subjects. Only Daryll Forde, with his network of contacts, his administrative skills and geniality, his intellectual energy and openness, could ensure success.<br>
<br>The department of anthropology that Forde started in 1945 reflected his broad vision. Based on the American model, it was the only department in Britain to combine archaeology and material culture with both social and biological anthropology. Forde's vision and intellectual generosity attracted, by the 1950s, some of the best postgraduates of the day; posts in his department were the starting-point for a talented new breed of anthropologists (including west Africans); new directions, for example in African history or medical anthropology, were warmly encouraged. Forde created not so much a school of anthropology as a style; and he developed the field of African anthropology less by his own writings than by his dissemination of new knowledge&#151;through international seminars, monographs, bibliographic aids, and the journal he edited, <span class="italic">Africa</span>. A crucial element in the expansion of African studies which he stimulated was breadth: the Forde style of anthropology included archaeology, genetics, technology, history, ecology, demography, and linguistics, as well as social anthropology. He fostered intellectual exchange and, over a period of twenty-five years, gave support, intellectually or financially, to an extraordinary number of scholars in Britain, Europe, and Africa.<br>
<br>Forde was twice married. In 1930 he married Joyce Marion Stock, and they had two sons. This marriage was dissolved in 1947, and in the following year he married Evelyn Harty Singer, a medical practitioner. After a brief semi-retirement, Forde died at his home, 8 The Boltons, Kensington, London, on 3 May 1973.<br>
