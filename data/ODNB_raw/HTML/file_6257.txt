<span class="headword">Cope, Sir  Walter</span>  (1553?&#150;1614), <span class="occ">administrator</span>, was probably born at Hardwick Manor, near Banbury, Oxfordshire. His father was Edward Cope (<i>d</i>. 1557), a gentleman farmer, and his mother, Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1587), daughter of Walter Mohun of Overstone and Wollaston, Northamptonshire. On their father's early death he was the third son of a family consisting of four sons and three daughters. He was entered at Gray's Inn in 1570. With no resources except a &pound;12 annuity, he became gentleman usher to William Cecil, and an official of the court of wards in 1574, doubtless through Burghley's influence as master. He was concerned with its financial aspects. Additionally, in 1580 he became the court's feodary for Oxfordshire, though he left to his deputy much of the work of ensuring that the crown received its dues from tenants-in-chief who were minors. He held this post at least until Elizabeth's death, and in 1601 became also the feodary for the city of London and Middlesex, a post he continued to hold under James I. The latter was especially lucrative as feodaries were paid a percentage of the revenue they brought to court. At an unknown date Cope married Dorothy (<i>d</i>. 1638), daughter of Richard Grenville of Wotton Underwood, Buckinghamshire, and Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Gifford.<br>
<br>Having the gift of making himself indispensable, Cope continued to serve Lord Burghley, for by 1593 he was described as his secretary and was thus known as a great person in England by Magistrate Valladares of Lisbon. Both positions made him a person well worth cultivating, and led to gifts in addition to his wards fees. He was also able to buy wardships and thus gain from managing wards' lands, as in the case of Thomas Hoardson of Folkestone. He acquired an estate in Dunsden, Oxfordshire, which he sold to his brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6251/', "Anthony Cope")</script> in 1591, buying West Town Manor in Kensington, Middlesex, in 1592, and subsequently all the other manors there, helped by a share in Overstone from his mother. He had also become the trusted friend of Sir Robert Cecil, and continued to be involved in national administration as Burghley sickened and died in 1598. He accompanied Cecil on a diplomatic mission to France, examined suspects in Essex's rebellion, and gave advice on emergency finance when customs collection was behindhand in 1601. He was also involved in personal errands for Cecil, including oversight of the improvements to the Theobalds water supply.<br>
<br>On James I's accession in 1603 Cope journeyed north to welcome him, and was thus knighted at Worksop. He continued to combine national affairs with his work as Cecil's factotum: he arranged for Burbage's company to revive <span class="italic">Love's Labours Lost</span> to entertain Queen Anne at Cecil's house; advised James I on the most acceptable way of establishing a lottery, by raising money for charity; and went on a diplomatic mission to Brussels and Holland. He was so influential that Dudley Carleton pleaded with him for help when suspected of involvement in the Gunpowder Plot, and later in gaining an embassy. He began building Cope Castle (later Holland House), an imbroglio of Dutch gables and Italianate ornament, in Kensington in 1605, with an extensive park containing exotic trees imported by John Tradescant. He repeatedly entertained the king and queen there. John Chamberlain complained in 1608 that he was not allowed to touch even a cherry because the queen was expected. He was on sufficiently close terms that, after Prince Henry died in 1612, James I spent the night there, and Prince Charles, Princess Elizabeth, and the elector palatine came next day to join him.<br>
<br>Cope continued to advance in favour under James I. In June 1609 he was made chamberlain of the exchequer, a virtual sinecure, for life; in October he was granted a sixth of all fines given the king in the next twenty-one years; and in 1611 or 1612 he was made public registrar-general of commerce, and keeper of Hyde Park with Cecil, from 1605 earl of Salisbury, further profitable offices. Thus he was able to marry his only known child and heiress, Isabel, to Sir Henry Rich, later earl of Holland. But the death of his patron, Salisbury, in 1612, left Cope isolated; perhaps the more so as he and his fellow executor disputed the validity of his will. As his dead friend and master was vilified, Sir Walter's career faced eclipse. Courageously, he wrote a vindication to present to the king, <span class="italic">An Apology for the Late Lord Treasurer</span>, in resonant prose: &#145;I held it base to flatter him in his life: I will not now begin to flatter him in his grave. To offer such incense to the dead, I account the basest kind of sacrifice&#146;  (Gutch, 119&#150;20). Perhaps Chamberlain was right to suggest that Cope was also putting forward his own qualifications to become master of the court of wards. In November 1612 the king granted him the office. This gave him precedence over all officials except privy councillors, and probably an income of about &pound;5000 a year. He increased the annual revenue from the sale of wards and marriages, which stood at &pound;12,491 in his second year. He purposed to act honestly, and was concerned to raise revenue. This was his zenith.<br>
<br>Cope was an MP in at least two Elizabethan parliaments, and those of 1604 and 1614, sometimes clearly through the Cecil interest. He was an active member, especially in matters of religion and also of finance. In 1604 he suggested that composition for the feudal right of purveyance should be set at &pound;30,000 p.a., strongly backing the rule of law: &#145;Cords bind Beasts, Words bind Men, Treaties bind Kings abroad, and Laws at home&#146;  (<span class="italic">JHC</span>, 1.984). He opposed impositions by prerogative on merchants, and resisted pressure in 1611 to consider subsidies before discussing redress of grievances. He was involved in considering what to do with the 1604 <span class="italic">Form of Apology</span>, and thus must have favoured it. He acted with independence of mind despite his closeness to Salisbury and desire for advancement from James I. Yet, as an influential figure, he was consulted before the speaker agreed to answer a question about Bate's case. The Addled Parliament ended his membership of the house ingloriously. Sir Thomas Parry, chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster, had offered one of the Stockbridge seats to him, and fraudulently altered the return when the electors refused to accept his nominees. Thus his election was annulled.<br>
<br>Cope invested in a number of overseas trading companies, including the Virginia and East India companies. Of the former he was a director, and persuaded others to invest in it. Another excursion into business was to prove disastrous. In May 1607, with his brother Sir Anthony, Arthur Ingram, Sir Thomas Lake, and others, he joined a syndicate to buy former church property in crown hands for &pound;37,333 6<i>s</i>. 8<i>d</i>. A further contract was undertaken in November; another in May 1608 for rectories worth &pound;75,000; and yet others in 1611, 1612, and 1613. Clearly, from Ingram's shady financial reputation, this was not a noble attempt to re-endow plundered livings: it was speculation, in a market which, by 1613, was glutted. Cope's involvement in Ingram's alum monopoly and the crown commission investigating it was dubious, and unprofitable. The probable portrait of him in 1612 shows an elegant, dignified, but anxious man.<br>
<br>Less than a month after Sir Anthony's death Sir Walter Cope was suddenly taken ill. According to Chamberlain, his brother's loss, rumours of losing the mastership of the wards, and his financial commitments after Sir Anthony's death had combined to break his heart. His will reflects anxiety about paying all his debts; and on 30 July 1614 he died at Cope Castle, reputedly with over &pound;26,000 to settle. He was buried at Kensington parish church on 1 August. His probable portrait, perhaps by John de Critz the elder, hangs at Hatfield House.<br>
