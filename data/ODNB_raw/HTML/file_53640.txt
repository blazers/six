<span class="headword">Findlay,  Alexander George, the younger</span>  (1812&#150;1875), <span class="occ">geographer and hydrographer</span>, was born in London on 6 January 1812.<br>
<br>His father, <a name="cosubject_53640"></a><span class="headword">Alexander Findlay the elder</span>  (1790&#150;1870), <span class="occ">engraver and cartographic and hydrographic publisher</span>, was born on 7 December 1788 in Bermondsey, Surrey (where he was baptized at St Mary Magdalen on 4 January 1789), the son of Archibald Findlay (<i>b</i>. 1754), variously described as a sailmaker or victualler, originally from Leith in Edinburghshire, who had moved his business from Scotland to the Thames in the late eighteenth century, and his wife, Mary (<i>d</i>. 1794). He married on 8 November 1810 Sarah, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Lumb. He had an engraving business in Pentonville and did much work for Richard Holmes Laurie, map publisher, son of Robert Laurie, engraver and map publisher. He was a founder fellow of the Royal Geographical Society in 1830 and engraved numerous charts and maps. With his wife, Sarah, he had at least three children: the younger Alexander, William Benjamin Findlay (1825&#150;1875), who became rector of Etherley, co. Durham, and Sarah. Alexander Findlay the elder died on 7 January 1870 at Hayes Common, Kent, where he was buried at St Mary the Virgin.<br>
<br>As a child and young man Alexander Findlay the younger's interest in geography was encouraged and his training supervised by his father. In 1844 he was elected fellow of the Royal Geographical Society and soon became an active member of its council and committees. In 1842 he published a revised version of Brookes's <span class="italic">Gazetteer</span> and <span class="italic">The Coasts and Islands of the Pacific Ocean</span>. The latter was the first of many meticulously compiled hydrographical works. His <span class="italic">Classical Atlas</span> (1847) was the most widely circulated of his geographical works. His meteorological research attracted the attention of Admiral Fitzroy who invited him to join an official department of meteorology then being established, but Findlay preferred an independent career.<br>
<br>On the death in 1858 of Richard Holmes Laurie, for whom he, like his father, had done much work, Alexander George Findlay took over that business and directed it to new success&#151;it became one of the longest running hydrographic publishing houses in Europe. Between 1869 and 1875 Findlay prepared and published six navigational directories which in text, maps, and diagrams documented the winds, currents, coastlines, and other information necessary for navigation in the major oceans of the world. The directories ran to several editions and were regarded as the standard authorities. His interest in lighthouses won him a medal from the Society of Arts and led to the publication of various editions of <span class="italic">A Description and List of Lighthouses of the World</span>. Findlay kept up his geographical work and took a keen interest in exploration. As a member of the Arctic committee of the Royal Geographical Society he helped to analyse possible routes taken by Sir John Franklin and gave valuable help in preparing the case which persuaded the government to send out the <i>Alert</i> and <i>Discovery</i> expedition in 1875. He was also active in mapping the discoveries being made in Africa and the quest for the source of the Nile. He was a friend of David Livingstone and made the official maps of the routes taken by Burton and Speke in their journeys in 1858&#150;9. He worked actively for the British Association for the Advancement of Science and gave papers on ocean currents and climatology to its conferences in 1853 and 1869 respectively. He married on 15 October 1850 Sarah (1821&#150;1875), daughter of Samuel Rutley, farmer, of Wrotham, Kent; the marriage appears to have been childless.<br>
<br>In 1870 the Societ&agrave; Geographica Italiana elected Findlay to foreign honorary membership in recognition of his services to hydrography and geography. He received the medal of the Congr&egrave;s International des Sciences G&eacute;ographiques in Paris in 1875. Many of his numerous maps, charts, and scientific papers remained in use long after his death, of heart disease, on 3 May 1875 at 1 Sydney Villas, Dover, where he was visiting, having made his home at Dulwich Wood, London. He was buried next to his father at Hayes. His business, at 53 Fleet Street, City of London at the time of his death, was taken over by two of his nephews, Daniel Walter Kettle (<i>d</i>. 1912) and William Richardson Kettle (<i>d</i>. 1918) who were probably as children to him: Daniel had accompanied him to Dover and was present at his death. Both were described as nautical publishers on their election to the Royal Geographical Society in 1875 and 1876 respectively. A third nephew, Henry Alexander Kettle (<i>d</i>. 1879), described as a hydrographical draughtsman on his election to the society in 1876, worked for the firm in 1876&#150;9.<br>
