<span class="headword">Heron, Sir  Robert</span>, second baronet  (1765&#150;1854), <span class="occ">politician</span>, born at Newark on 27 November 1765, was the only son of Thomas Heron of Chilham Castle, Kent, recorder of Newark (who died on 28 April 1794), and his first wife, Anne, the elder daughter of Sir Edward Wilmot, bt, MD. In childhood he was very feeble. His mother died on 30 April 1767, and he was brought up by strangers. He was educated from the age of eight by the Revd John Skynner, who lived near Stamford, and proceeded afterwards to St John's College, Cambridge, but did not stay long enough to take a degree. For two summers he travelled on the continent with an eccentric tutor, Robert Pedley (afterwards known as Robert Deverell). On 9 January 1792 he married Amelia (<i>d</i>. 1847), second daughter of Sir Horatio Mann of Broughton Malherbe. They had no children. He succeeded to the baronetcy on the death of his uncle <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13089/', "Sir Richard Heron")</script>, in 1805. On the death of another uncle, the Revd Robert Heron of Grantham, on 19 January 1813, he succeeded to considerable property, which was augmented by the widow's death shortly afterwards.<br>
<br>In politics Heron was a whig, though he voted for income tax in 1815 and had little faith in the whig leaders. He abandoned an intention to contest Lincolnshire in 1812 in order to canvass the borough of Grimsby, and was duly returned for that constituency. At the next general election in 1818 he stood for Lincolnshire, but he was in a hopeless minority and withdrew on the third day of the poll. Through Lord Fitzwilliam's interest he was returned in December 1819 for Peterborough, and was re-elected until 1832 without opposition. After that date he was frequently opposed, but continued to sit for Peterborough until his retirement in 1847. Heron was a constant speaker in the House of Commons, supporting slave-trade abolition, Catholic emancipation, and retrenchment in the 1820s; among his later proposals was a motion &#145;respecting the vacating of seats in parliament on the acceptance of office&#146;, on which the marquess of Northampton published a pamphlet of <span class="italic">Observations</span> in 1835. A quirky, quixotic politician, Heron embodied the spirit of the independent country gentleman.<br>
<br>Heron's wife died on 12 December 1847 and he died suddenly at his home, Stubton Hall, near Grantham, Lincolnshire, on 29 May 1854, the baronetcy becoming extinct. A monument to their memory was erected in Stubton churchyard by George Neville, the successor to the property; Heron had built the nave and tower of Stubton church about 1800. A volume of his <span class="italic">Notes</span> was printed anonymously for private circulation at Grantham in 1850, and published in 1851. They dealt mainly with politics and social economy, but included observations on natural history, drawn from the curious animals collected together in what was locally known as his &#145;menagerie&#146;. In one passage he spoke of J. W. Croker as &#145;one of the most determined jobbers&#146;, and in another referred to a &#145;most malicious article&#146; of that critic in the <span class="italic">Quarterly Review</span>. Croker revenged himself by a savage onslaught on the volume in the <span class="italic">Quarterly</span> (1852, 90.206&#150;25).<br>
