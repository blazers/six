<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Negus,  Arthur George</span>  (1903&#150;1985), <span class="occ">antiques expert and broadcaster</span>, was born on 29 March 1903 in Reading, Berkshire, the only child of Arthur George Negus (<i>d</i>. 1920), cabinet-maker, from Huntingdonshire, and his wife, Amy Julia Worsley (<i>d</i>. 1925). He left Reading School in 1920 to join his father in his business making and restoring furniture. His father also owned a small shop, attached to his workshop, where he sold pieces of antique furniture, and when he died, ten months later, Negus took over the shop and began to go to auction sales, building up a business as an antique dealer. In 1926 he married Irene (Queenie) Amy Hollett (<i>b</i>. 1908); they had two daughters.<br>
<br>Negus later worked for Reading Fine Art Galleries, travelling round England buying antique furniture, but after the beginning of the Second World War the showrooms were requisitioned, and he joined the police war reserve in 1941, spending the war as a clerk in the Criminal Investigation Department. In 1946 he joined Bruton Knowles &amp; Co., a firm of fine art auctioneers and estate agents in Gloucester, taking charge of the antique furniture side of the business. There he worked as an appraiser, and prepared the catalogues for auction sales in private houses. He became a partner in 1972.<br>
<br>When John Irving, a producer with the west region of the BBC in Bristol, had the idea for an antiques quiz on television, Negus, well known in the west of England for his skill in valuation, was asked in 1965 to take part as one of the resident experts in the first series of <span class="italic">Going for a Song</span>, in which two &#145;customers&#146; competed in identifying and valuing objects which had been secretly valued by the two experts. An instant success, the series was transferred to national television later that year. Although Negus thought it was so popular because the participants often discussed quite inexpensive objects, which the viewers might have at home, it was Negus himself who was the real reason for its success. His enthusiasm and affable manner endeared him to viewers, and he was able to talk in an interesting and authoritative way about a wide variety of objects, even though he only claimed to have any expertise in English period furniture. Audience surveys showed that the only criticism of the show concerned the &#145;customers&#146;, who often did not know very much, and so did not contribute to the interest of the programme. <span class="italic">Going for a Song</span> ran until 1977. It was soon joined in 1966 by <span class="italic">Talking about Antiques</span> on the Home Service (later Radio 4) of the BBC, in which Arthur Negus and Bernard Price described and discussed photographs of antiques sent in by listeners. The <span class="italic">Antiques Roadshow</span>, in which he took part until 1983, travelled around the country discussing antiques, and became even more popular than <span class="italic">Going for a Song</span>. Other television shows included <span class="italic">Pride of Place</span> in 1966, in which he visited houses such as Hardwick Hall, Corsham Court, and Saltram House, describing the contents, while John Betjeman talked about the architecture, and <span class="italic">On the Road</span>, where he travelled in a yellow Rolls-Royce along old mail-coach routes such as that from London to York. He made many programmes in the <span class="italic">Collector's World</span> series on such topics as furniture restoration, longcase clocks, and the history of the chair. Although at first he turned down invitations such as one in 1966 to join <span class="italic">Call my Bluff</span> on the grounds that he had a business to run, he soon became a well-known television personality, making guest appearances in <span class="italic">The Two Ronnies</span> and <span class="italic">The Generation Game</span>. He was equally popular with radio audiences, and gave frequent talks on <span class="italic">Woman's Hour</span>. A guest on <span class="italic">Desert Island Discs</span> in 1967, he chose Ralph Edwards's <span class="italic">Dictionary of English Furniture</span> as his one luxury. Although he had never spoken in public before 1965, he was soon much in demand, and gave talks all over the British Isles.<br>
<br>Negus published <span class="italic">Going for a Song: English Furniture</span> (1969; 5th edn 1977), and his autobiography, <span class="italic">A Life Among Antiques</span> (1982). It was largely through him that the world of antiques was opened up to ordinary people, who were inspired to search in their own attics for treasures. He became a freeman of the City of London in 1976, and in 1982 he was appointed OBE. Arthur Negus died on 5 April 1985 at his home, 31 Queens Court, Queens Road, Cheltenham.<br>
