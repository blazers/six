<span class="headword">Rohde,  Eleanour Sophy Sinclair</span>  (1881&#150;1950), <span class="occ">garden historian and gardener</span>, was born in Alleppey, Travancore, India, on 9 August 1881, the daughter of John Rohde, civil servant in India, and his wife, Isabel Crawford. Although her surname is German in origin, her grandfather John Rohde was employed in India as a judge in the East India Company and finally became inspector-general of gaols, and her father was commercial agent to the maharaja of Travancore and was later attached to the Travancore civil service. The family home in England after about 1920 was at Reigate, Surrey; earlier associations are unknown, though memories of Eleanour's childhood in her books are of England, not India. She entered Cheltenham Ladies' College at the age of fifteen, in September 1896. Four other pupils with the same surname were at the school in 1899, though any relationship with them is unknown. Examination results in 1900 show her passing second class in English language and literature and in the history of English literature (early English).<br>
<br>In 1900 Rohde became a student at St Hilda's Hall, Oxford, to read modern history, and reports by external tutors comment on her deep interest in political science, her thoughtful work, and her receptive mind. She completed her studies in 1903 but, for reasons unknown, did not take the final examination. She became an assistant mistress at a private school in Kensington, London, after which she was private tutor to Lord Curzon's children, from 1906 to 1908, and then assistant mistress at Caldecote Towers, Bushey Heath, Hertfordshire.<br>
<br>Between about 1908 and 1920 Eleanour Rohde's interests and activities ranged widely, though the chronology is uncertain. She was history tutor and vice-principal at St Hilda's from January to June 1910, standing in for Miss Christine Burrows when the latter was in America. She lectured for the Tariff Reform Association, and was an assistant on <span class="italic">The Times History of War</span> at some time between 1914 and 1918. In 1913 she published a book on Piedmont, with illustrations by Estelle Canziani. Aspiring to a career in politics she was secretary for three years to Lord Curzon of Kedleston Hall, Derbyshire, but she found politics disagreeably quarrelsome and returned home to her parents' house, Cranham Lodge, 44 Croydon Road, Reigate, Surrey. The house, which had a fair-sized garden, was bought in 1920, and Eleanour resided there for the rest of her life, developing her historical and practical interest in herbs and unusual plants.<br>
<br>Domestic herb cultivation for medicinal use had been urged by the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries in 1914 when imports ceased, and a training school was established at The Whins, Chalfont St Peter, Buckinghamshire. Rohde attended in 1916, and in May 1919 she assisted Maud Grieve, who had set up the school, in the creation of the first herb garden to be exhibited at the Chelsea flower show. Rohde seems to have been an early member of the British Guild of Herb Growers from about 1918, and her book <span class="italic">A Garden of Herbs</span> appeared in 1920. Thereafter she combined scholarship with practical gardening, dividing her time between writing books about old herbals, and growing herbs and unusual plants, issuing catalogues for the sale of plants at Reigate, lecturing (she lectured for Kent county council on gardening and fruit preservation), and designing herb gardens. Rohde joined a circle of illustrious, knowledgeable women who were renowned and pioneering experts in the 1920s and 1930s. She was also a close friend of Lieutenant-Colonel L. C. R. Messel and his wife, Maud, of Nymans, Sussex, the inspired Surrey gardeners, and made full use of their library. At her death <span class="italic">The Times</span> judged that &#145;the mantle of Miss Jekyll had fallen on her&#146;  (24 June 1950).<br>
<br>During the Second World War, Eleanor Rohde's efforts were necessarily more practical than scholarly, and led to the publication of her <span class="italic">Hay Box Cookery</span> (1939), <span class="italic">The Wartime Vegetable Garden</span> (1940), and <span class="italic">Culinary and Salad Herbs</span> (1940). She also cultivated additional land, with the help of &#145;land girls&#146; and prisoners of war. Although described as a retiring person, she is credited with much influence in reviving the growing of neglected herbs, and recalling and passing on the tradition of monastic gardens in cultivating fragrant and culinary plants. She was a member of the committee advising Mrs Hilda Leyel on the management of the House of Culpeper, and redesigned the kitchen garden at Lullingstone Castle, Kent, in 1946. From 1921 onwards she published many anthologies of poetry and prose on gardening, forming a strong bond with the Medici Society as her publishers between 1929 and 1938. Some of her many articles in <span class="italic">Country Life</span>, <span class="italic">The Queen</span>, <span class="italic">The Sphere</span>, <span class="italic">The Field</span>, and the <span class="italic">Journal of the Royal Horticultural Society</span> were reissued in books. She became president of the Society of Women Journalists.<br>
<br>Rohde's historical research in libraries and archives was always wide-ranging, thorough, and scholarly. Her <span class="italic">Old English Herbals</span> (1922) and <span class="italic">Oxford's College Gardens</span> (1932) reveal her deep reading of old herbals, histories of the university, and college archives. A visit to Palestine and Egypt lay behind her essays &#145;Garden-craft in the Bible&#146; and &#145;Gardens of the pharaohs&#146; (1927), and her travels in Italy illuminated <span class="italic">The Scented Garden</span> (1931). She possessed strong imaginative and literary powers which made past scenes live before the eye.<br>
<br>Rohde died at the Wallfield Nursing Home, West Street, Reigate, on 23 June 1950, aged sixty-eight, and was buried nearby at St Mary's Church. Her revised edition of <span class="italic">Uncommon Vegetables and Fruits</span> (1943) appeared after her death in 1951, but her papers and books are thought to have been destroyed in a fire at Nymans. Her closest kin and heir was her cousin, Arthur Cotton Rohde, gentleman farmer of Ranfold Grange, Slinfold, Surrey. No trace of her garden at Reigate survived, as some of the land was sold to build two new houses, but rosemary at the gate continued to thrive: it came from Arthur Trower of Wiggie Farm, Redhill, who received a slip from the Wimbledon garden of Mary Ann Cross (George Eliot); it had been taken there from Shakespeare's garden in Stratford.<br>
