<span class="headword">Preston,  Thomas</span>  (1537&#150;1598), <span class="occ">playwright and college head</span>, was born at Simpson, Buckinghamshire, of a Lancashire family. He was educated at Eton College and at King's College, Cambridge, where he was elected scholar on 16 August 1553 and fellow on 18 September 1556. He graduated BA in 1557 and MA in 1561. He made a favourable impression on Elizabeth I when she visited Cambridge in 1564 for his performance in the tragedy of <span class="italic">Dido</span>; for his &#145;gracefull gesture &hellip; and propernesse of person&#146; as a disputant in a philosophy act&#151;despite having the difficult task of refuting the statement &#145;monarchia est optimus status reipublic&aelig;&#146; (&#145;monarchy is the best form for a state&#146;); and for his oration upon her departure, at which Elizabeth dubbed him &#145;her scholar&#146; and gave him the not inconsiderable pension of &pound;20 a year (Fuller, 264; Cooper, <span class="italic">Annals</span>, 2.196). In 1565 he was a proctor in the university. He was directed by his college to study civil law in 1572, and subsequently proceeded to the degree of LLD, possibly in 1576. In 1581 he resigned his fellowship, perhaps in order to marry, since when he was appointed master of Trinity Hall he was the first married man to occupy the post. He was elected to this office by royal mandate in 1585, having been recommended as a man &#145;void of faction&#146;  (Crawley, 66), and on 17 May 1586 his name was entered in the subscription book of the College of Advocates, where, as master of Trinity Hall, he was entitled to lodge. In 1589&#150;90 he served as the university's vice-chancellor. He was admitted an advocate in the court of arches on 17 June 1591.<br>
<br>The best-known work attributed to Preston is the play <span class="italic">Cambises</span>, which, although licensed to John Allde in 1569&#150;70, could have been written as early as 1560 when it may have been presented at court over Christmas. Comprising thirty-eight parts for eight players, this play is deemed to be innovative both in terms of its staging requirements and as a hybrid dramatic form which marked the transition from the morality play to the tragedies and history plays of Marlowe and Shakespeare. Despite its innovative qualities <span class="italic">Cambises</span> has also been derogated for its &#145;gross bombast&#146; and &#145;absurd ineptitudes&#146;  (Wilson, 144), and its plodding couplets in fourteeners, interwoven with unmetrical verse spoken by the character of the Vice. The play was ridiculed by contemporaries, and was notably parodied by Shakespeare in Bottom's play in <span class="italic">A Midsummer Night's Dream</span> and in <span class="italic">1 Henry IV</span>, when Falstaff is made to &#145;speak in passion &hellip; in King Cambises' vein&#146;  (II.v)&#151;although such parody indirectly suggests the popularity of the play. Perhaps because of the work's more flamboyant qualities Preston's authorship has been questioned, and <span class="italic">Cambises</span>&#151;together with an anti-Catholic ballad of 1570 entitled &#145;A Lamentation from Rome&#146; (narrated from the perspective of a fly lodged in the pope's nose) which was also penned by a Thomas Preston&#151;is sometimes attributed to an itinerant actor&#150;playwright rather than the master of Trinity Hall. Two other ballads bear Preston's name, and he was undisputedly the author of Latin verses compiled by the university on the restitution of Bucer and Fagius in 1560, and at the end of Carr's <span class="italic">Demosthenis &hellip; orationes</span> (1571).<br>
<br>Preston died intestate on 1 June 1598, and inventories amounting to more than &pound;450 worth of goods left at his chambers in Doctors' Commons, his house in Barnwell, Cambridge, and in the master's lodging at Trinity Hall, suggest that he died a wealthy man. He was buried in Trinity Hall chapel, where a brass monument commissioned by his widow, Alice, still remains near the altar, commemorating him with an effigy and a Latin inscription.<br>
