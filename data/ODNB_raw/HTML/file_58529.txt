<span class="headword">Longe,  Francis  Davy</span>  (1831&#150;1910), <span class="occ">civil servant</span>, was born at Coombs, Suffolk, on 25 September 1831, the second son in the family of three sons and one daughter of Robert Longe (1800&#150;1890) of Spixworth Park, Norfolk, vicar of Coddenham-cum-Crowfield, and his wife, Margaret Douglas (<i>d</i>. 1873), daughter of Charles Davy, rector of Barking, Suffolk. Educated from 1845 to 1850 at Harrow School, where he was captain of the cricket eleven, he matriculated as a commoner at Oriel College, Oxford, in 1850, and went on to take third-class honours in classics in 1854, and to represent Oxford against Cambridge at cricket. George Goschen was a college contemporary and lifelong friend. After graduating BA in 1854, Longe was admitted to the Inner Temple in April 1855 and called to the bar in April 1858. On 27 September 1864 he married Sara Rose (<i>d</i>. 1905), daughter of the Revd Thomas Patteson, rector of Hambledon, Hampshire; they had no children.<br>
<br>Longe was a member of the Social Science Association committee which produced the important report on trade unionism <span class="italic">Trades' Societies and Strikes</span> (1860). His own contribution to the contemporary debate on unionism was a pamphlet, <span class="italic">An Inquiry into the Law of &#145;Strikes&#146;</span> (1860), which advanced the novel, and subsequently influential, contention that the common-law doctrines against trade combinations rested on extremely shaky foundations. He also observed the historic tendency of the statute law to favour the interests of the consumer and employer over those of the labourer. From 1862 to 1867 he was an assistant commissioner on the children's employment commission, and prepared reports on the employment conditions of women and children ranging across several industries and regions, including the Staffordshire potteries (1863), the Yorkshire textile trades (1863), the midlands iron trades (1864), copperworks in south Wales (1865), and the agricultural gangs of the East Anglian fens (1866).<br>
<br>Longe's observation of the damaging moral and social effects of low wages, and a practical interest in social reform, informed his most significant work, <span class="italic">A refutation of the wage-fund theory of modern political economy as enunciated by Mr Mill, M.P. and Mr Fawcett, M.P.</span> (1866). The first systematic critique of the theory that wages were paid from a predetermined sum of capital, Longe's pamphlet contended that the existing orthodoxy obstructed attempts to improve the position of the most depressed groups of workers by popularizing the idea that the aggregate rate of wages could not be raised. His arguments were not immediately noticed by political economists, and it was another writer, W. T. Thornton, who drew a recantation from Mill in 1869, but the significance of Longe's pioneering work was later more widely recognized. It was reprinted in 1903 in the series of economic tracts edited by the American labour economist Jacob Harry Hollander, to whom Longe supplied details of its publishing history  (Vint, 179&#150;80 n.). His work was, moreover, acknowledged in contemporary official circles, as were the implications of his comparative researches into the law of trade unions and strikes in France, published in the <span class="italic">Fortnightly Review</span> (1867).<br>
<br>In 1868 Goschen appointed Longe to be his private secretary at the poor-law board. He was made a general inspector at the successor department, the Local Government Board, in 1871, and had responsibility for supervising the administration of poor relief in the Gloucestershire district. His last annual report was dated 1 May 1896. His official career in a department whose routine work was described by his colleague Herbert Preston-Thomas in <span class="italic">The Work and Play of a Government Inspector</span> (1909) seems to have been unremarkable. In retirement he was a prominent member of the Norfolk Naturalists' Society, and published the results of some antiquarian researches, <span class="italic">Lowestoft in Olden Times</span> (1898; 2nd edn, 1905). Longe died at his home in Ipswich, Suffolk, on 20 February 1910.<br>
