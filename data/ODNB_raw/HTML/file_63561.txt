<span class="headword">Harris,  Thomas</span>  (1829/30&#150;1900), <span class="occ">architect</span>, was the son of William Harris, baker, and his wife, Charlotte. He was established in independent practice in London by 1851, when he was elected an associate of the Royal Institute of British Architects. In 1860, however, he published the pamphlet <span class="italic">Victorian Architecture</span>, which energetically engaged contemporary debate about the need for a modern architectural style rather than the prevailing historicism. Historical examples, Harris argued, should be studied for their spirit and principles, not merely copied; architects should seek a style to embody the revolutionary technological progress that typified modernity. The difficulty of achieving this appears in Harris's accompanying design for an apartment block, supposedly in the new &#145;Victorian&#146; style but actually an undisciplined effort in the eclectic Gothic of the period. In 1862 Harris edited, and largely wrote, <span class="italic">Examples of the Architecture of the Victorian Age</span>, which similarly advocated a distinctive &#145;Victorian&#146; style, and enthused about the iron and glass construction of railway stations and the Crystal Palace. Illustrations included two central London shops by Harris in a forceful, highly simplified Gothic that made some structural use of iron. Even more functionalist was a warehouse on Lisson Grove he designed in 1873, its rectilinear brick and girder construction given vestigial Renaissance styling.<br>
<br>Away from commercial buildings, Harris's career, and his style, developed more conventionally. His 1869 competition design for Bradford town hall, though unsuccessful, led to important contacts in the town, where he may have had family connections: Bradford's largest bankers, closely involved in architectural development, had the same surname. Harris's first two major houses were for local magnate families: the dramatically composed Gothic pile of Milner Field, Bingley (1871&#150;3; dem.) for a son of Sir Titus Salt, founder of Saltaire; and the many-gabled timber-framed Belstone Court, Shropshire (1884), for the Ripleys, woollen manufacturers and dyers. This latter commission probably led to his third great house, the nearby Jacobean-style mansion of Stokesay Court (1889), designed for a glove maker. Similar stylistic historicism characterizes the commissions Harris undertook in London, including the remodelling of Marylebone parish church (1883), houses in Shaftesbury Avenue and Wardour Street (1889), and the Holborn shop of the publisher Batsford (<i>c</i>.1889).<br>
<br>Yet Harris remained ideologically committed to the need for a new style. Returning to print with <span class="italic">Three Periods of English Architecture</span> (1894), he argued that the structural inheritance of Gothic represented indigenous tradition, and its revival was the prelude to an architectural awakening through a future style based on metal construction. His ideas were little regarded, and passed over in the brief obituaries following his death aged seventy-one at his home, 54 Carlton Hill, St John's Wood, London, on 10 July 1900. He was unmarried. Since then, however, his writings have been seen as anticipating the modernist movement, even as his career exemplified the Victorian dilemma of style.<br>
