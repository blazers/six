<span class="headword">Simmonds,  Peter Lund</span>  (1814&#150;1897), <span class="occ">newsagent and journalist</span>, was born on 24 July 1814 in Aarhus, Denmark. He was adopted by Lieutenant George Simmonds RN&#151;but his precise origins and the events leading to his adoption are obscure. The Simmondses were a naval family and their home at Portsea Island, Hampshire, was near the country's chief naval dockyard. From the age of twelve Peter served as a midshipman on the <i>Cygnet</i>, under the command of his uncle, James Gooding. In 1831 he was sent to Jamaica as a bookkeeper. The West Indies, in this tumultuous period of slave emancipation, made a deep impression on him; the experience formed the basis for all his later interests. His return to England in 1834 coincided with a remarkable proliferation of periodicals and he first emerged as a journalist editing <span class="italic">The Garland</span> (1836), a provincial miscellany of news and literature, and as main contributor to <span class="italic">The Alligator</span> (1841) which was devoted to West Indian matters. On 1 January 1838 he married Ellen Mary Molesworth (it seems that they later separated), and set up in Chichester as a &#145;newspaper agent&#146;, obtaining and circulating newspapers and journals from around the world, until 1841, when he moved to London to become secretary to the dynamic William Shaw, editor of the <span class="italic">Mark Lane Express</span>. Simmonds's interest in the overlap of science and trade was signalled by his membership of the Statistical Society of London; his essay in this society's <span class="italic">Journal</span>, &#145;Statistics of newspapers in various countries&#146; (1841) remains a useful survey of the world's press of that period. From 1842 to 1844 he served as sub-editor of the <span class="italic">Farmer's Encyclopaedia</span>, and was at some time later engaged as city editor of <span class="italic">The Globe</span>. In 1844 he began to publish <span class="italic">Simmonds' Colonial Magazine</span> which promoted the cause of colonial development, and criticized governmental &#145;apathy and supineness on the one hand and gross ignorance and misrule on the other&#146;  (<span class="italic">Simmonds' Colonial Magazine</span>, 7, 1846, preface). By this time he had established a worldwide communications network of impressive efficiency, and contributed to an enormous range of publications on a wide variety of subjects. In 1848, in keeping with the family tradition, he became a freemason. After the Great Exhibition of 1851 Simmonds was engaged to help with the display in South Kensington of &#145;trade products and objects of natural history&#146; sponsored by the Royal Society of Arts, of which he became a member in 1853. Subsequently he delivered nineteen major papers and published thirty-three substantial articles in the society's <span class="italic">Journal</span>, was made an honorary life member in 1862, and three times received the society's silver medal. It was Simmonds who successfully proposed Karl Marx for membership of the society. In 1861 he began a new periodical, <span class="italic">The Technologist: a Monthly Record of Science Applied to Art and Manufacture</span>. Its main concerns were with informed descriptions of natural resources and their acquisition, processing, and utilization, combined with the promotion of emigration as the solution to social problems. To these interests he added another, in which he was far ahead of his time&#151;the recycling of materials. His book <span class="italic">Waste Products and Undeveloped Substances, or, Hints for Enterprise in Neglected Fields</span> (1862) is a wide-ranging treatment of the subject. During these years he was closely involved with many international exhibitions, including those in London of 1862, Paris of 1867 and 1878, and Melbourne of 1880, and he was made of chevalier of the L&eacute;gion d'honneur in 1878, and a knight of the Crown of Italy in the same year. He helped establish natural science museums in Australia and Japan. His involvement with <span class="italic">The Technologist</span> ceased in 1866; in 1870 he started <span class="italic">The Journal of Applied Science</span> which covered similar topics, and continued for 146 issues until 1882. Thereafter, he was unable to sustain the journalism and lecturing which had been his main sources of income, though he continued to produce works such as <span class="italic">A Dictionary of Useful Animals</span> (1883). Despite a life of constant labour he was not prosperous and became increasingly impecunious. In 1892, sponsored by the prince of Wales and the archbishop of Canterbury (both freemasons), he was granted a pensioner's place at the Charterhouse in London. In mid-September 1897 he was knocked down by an omnibus in the Gray's Inn Road and died at the Charterhouse two weeks later, on 3 October. He was buried at Charterhouse burial-ground in Bow cemetery.<br>
