<span class="headword">Hutchinson,  Richard</span>  (<em>b. </em>1597, <em>d.</em> in or before 1670), <span class="occ">colonist in America and naval administrator</span>, was born in Alford, Lincolnshire, on 3 January 1597, the fourth child and fourth son in the family of six sons and two daughters (one of whom died young) of Edward Hutchinson, a merchant, and his wife, Susannah. Little is known of his early life. In 1621 he married Mary Hiley. They had six surviving sons and four daughters. His descendants included the earls of Donoughmore; the colonial governor and historian of Massachusetts, Thomas Hutchinson, was a collateral descendant. The commercially successful Hutchinson family emigrated to Massachusetts in 1633 and 1634. The Hutchinsons were involved in the great antinomian religious conformity controversy by which the infant colony was riven in 1636&#150;8, Richard's sister-in-law being the religious leader <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/14280/', "Anne Hutchinson")</script> and his brother-in-law her closest ally, the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/66155/', "Revd John Wheelwright")</script>. Richard had become a freeman&#151;that is, a full church member&#151;in 1634 but, along with others considered theologically unsound, was ordered to be disarmed in 1637, and with the rest of his family moved to the more tolerant atmosphere of Providence in 1638. He seems to have returned briefly to Massachusetts, perhaps in connection with his property there, but was back in England by 1643, in the service of the younger Sir Henry Vane, who as governor of the Massachusetts Bay colony at a precociously early age had been something of a fellow-traveller with the alleged heretics.<br>
<br>Hutchinson's first official work was under the navy and customs committee of the Long Parliament; by 1645 he was acting as Vane's deputy in the very important post of navy treasurer. In view of Vane's other commitments, Hutchinson must have had practical charge of parliamentarian naval finance, although it would seem that he was only paid a salary out of the treasurer's profits. Then in 1650 Vane was voted out of the position and Hutchinson succeeded him, holding it from the beginning of 1651 until the Restoration. With the outbreak of the First Anglo-Dutch War (1652&#150;4), the treasurership became much more lucrative, its holder being remunerated partly on a poundage basis related to naval expenditure. Hutchinson was also active in the Ironmongers' Company of London, of which he had purchased the freedom. His earlier association with Vane (who had tried to resist being replaced by his own deputy) did not prevent Hutchinson from remaining in office under the Cromwellian protectorate. Though inevitably losing office in 1660, he cleared his accounts successfully, and years later Samuel Pepys believed that the finances of the navy had never been better handled than while he was treasurer. Hutchinson seems to have resumed his part in a family transatlantic trading network; although according to tradition his losses in the great fire of London exceeded &pound;60,000, he seems to have died a wealthy man about 1670.<br>
<br>Confusingly, it was another Richard Hutchinson, of the City and later of Stepney, who was co-treasurer for sick and wounded soldiers, widows, and orphans from 1643 to 1660 and a judge for imprisoned debtors in 1653&#150;4, and who served as co-paymaster of the navy under the treasurers in 1668&#150;71, appearing in the latter part of Pepys's diary. The will of the former naval treasurer, the subject of this entry, was proved in April 1670, and the co-paymaster was still serving the following year and being called to account after that.<br>
