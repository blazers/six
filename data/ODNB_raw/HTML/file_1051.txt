<span class="headword">Bailey,  James</span>  (1791&#150;1864), <span class="occ">classical scholar</span>, was born at Otley, Yorkshire, where he was baptized on 16 November 1791, the son of James Bailey. He had at least four younger sisters, and was the grandson of James Bailey, master of the village school at Gargrave, Yorkshire, and later headmaster of the free school at Guiseley. Bailey is known to have been a boarder at Giggleswick School, from which he ran away, before being sent to Richmond grammar school under the headmastership of James Tate. To Tate he owed his love of classical scholarship. He was admitted to Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1808 as a sizar, gaining a scholarship in 1813. He obtained the university Browne medals for Greek ode and epigram, and the members' prizes in 1815 and 1816, the latter for an essay on hieroglyphics  (reprinted in the <span class="italic">Classical Journal</span>, vols. 16 and 17). He graduated BA in 1814 and MA in 1823, but did not gain the fellowship for which his talents might have recommended him.<br>
<br>Bailey decided against entering the church, choosing instead to pursue literary ambitions, despite friendly warnings from Walter Scott, with whom he corresponded from 1812, and from whom he received encouragement and financial assistance, that letters provided an uncertain living. He seems to have remained in Cambridge, contributing in 1817 classical articles to John Ballantyne's <span class="italic">Sale Room</span>, and assisting John Richardson Major in his new edition of J. Scapula's <span class="italic">Lexicon Graeco-Latinum</span> (1820). In the early 1820s he married and had a son. At the same time he was preparing his edition of Forcellini's Latin dictionary (2 vols., 1826), the work for which he was best known. In this he translated the Italian explanations into English, incorporated Forcellini's appendices within the main work, and added an extensive <i>auctarium</i> of his own.<br>
<br>In 1825 Bailey was appointed headmaster of the Perse Grammar School, Cambridge, at a salary of &pound;125 a year; gradual increases to &pound;400 a year testify to his effectiveness in raising the number of pupils. He resigned in 1833 owing to ill health, probably exacerbated by a chancery action brought by Cambridge townspeople challenging his policy of reducing the number of free places provided by the Perse trust from 100 to 16. Thereafter he lived on a pension of &pound;100 and pursued his literary interests. Part 1 of his <span class="italic">Comicorum graecorum fragmenta</span>, with English translations by Francis Fawkes, Francis Wrangham, and Richard Cumberland, appeared in 1840, but there was no sequel. Troubled by debts&#151;his books were sometimes in pawn&#151;he moved in 1841 to Peckham, where the burden of supporting his son, who unsuccessfully claimed talents to poetry, increased his difficulties. On the recommendation of John Kaye, bishop of Lincoln, and Edward Maltby, bishop of Durham, both of whom were accomplished Cambridge-educated classicists, Bailey received a civil-list pension of &pound;100 a year. He had married in the early 1820s, but by 1851 he was a widower. He died, in poverty, of chronic bronchitis at 1 Isabella Cottages, Arthur Street, Old Kent Road, London, on 13 February 1864.<br>
