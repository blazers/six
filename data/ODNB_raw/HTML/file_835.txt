<span class="headword">Atherton,  John</span>  (1598&#150;1640), <span class="occ">Church of Ireland bishop of Waterford and Lismore</span>, was the son of John Atherton (<i>c</i>.1560&#150;1609?), rector of Bawdrip in Somerset, where Atherton was probably born. He both matriculated and graduated BA at Gloucester Hall, Oxford, in 1617 and took an MA from Lincoln College in 1621. Though he had acquired some reputation as a canon lawyer, an Oxford career was precluded by his 1622 marriage to Joan Leakey of Barnstaple, with whom he was to have five daughters and who was to survive him, and he was presented to the living of Huish Champflower in Somerset by Philip Atherton in 1622. In 1629 he was elected to fellowship and conferred with an MA <i>ad eundum</i> at Trinity College, Dublin. His reasons for going to Ireland are unknown, but may be suggested by the currency of local rumours that he was the father of a child born to his sister-in-law Susan in 1623.<br>
<br>On 22 April 1630 Atherton was installed as rector of St John's, a prebend of Christ Church, Dublin, which he held jointly, without licence, with his English benefice. Accelerated advancement followed the arrival of Lord Deputy Viscount Wentworth: in 1634, he was appointed chancellor of the Killaloe diocese, rector of Killaban and Ballintubride in Queen's county, and chaplain to the lord chancellor. In 1635 he received an honorary DD from Trinity College, Dublin, and was installed as chancellor of Christ Church, and in 1636 he was appointed a commissioner for ecclesiastical causes and consecrated bishop of Waterford and Lismore (28 May). Archbishop Laud, who had insisted that Atherton resign his Somerset living and suspected him of having proposed a simoniacal transaction to his designated successor in the previous summer, at first opposed the nomination, but yielded to Wentworth's plea that Atherton was ideally qualified to recover the alienated property of the diocese from the earl of Cork: &#145;I will undertake that there is no such terrier in England for the unkennelling of an old fox&#146;, Wentworth urged  (Wentworth to Laud, 9 March 1636, Strafford MSS, vol. 6). This confidence proved justified: within two years, Atherton forced the earl to arbitration and procured a settlement which raised the potential income of the see from &pound;50 to &pound;1000 per annum.<br>
<br>In 1638 Wentworth proposed that Atherton should be translated to the bishopric of Cork, where he calculated that there was property worth &pound;800 a year to be recovered from the same hands. On this occasion Laud was unco-operative, perhaps influenced by an episode involving Atherton's recently deceased mother-in-law, Susannah Leakey, who was reputed to have appeared to her daughter-in-law in Minehead and entrusted her with a message to be delivered to Atherton in Ireland. A commission of inquiry concluded that this was &#145;a fiction and a practice, but to what end could not be discovered&#146;  (SP 161/383, no. 5). Laud thought that it was &#145;some money business&#146;, to which Wentworth responded that &#145;if money be that they aim at, it must be a strong and crafty devil that gets anything out of the bishop's purse&#146; (<span class="italic">Works of &hellip; William Laud</span>, 7.327; Wentworth to Laud, 10 July 1637, Strafford MSS, vol. 6). Local rumour, after the event, had it that the message was a warning to Atherton that &#145;unless he doth repent of the sin whereof he knows himself guilty, he shall be hanged&#146;, and that the sin was incest with his niece and complicity in the strangulation by Susannah of the daughter she bore  (D. L., <span class="italic">Bishop Atherton's Case</span>). On 17 June 1640 a petition against him was presented to the Irish House of Lords by his proctor, John Child, who both claimed to have had homosexual relations with him and accused him of acts of fornication and adultery. He was tried before a jury in the court of king's bench, where he admitted to &#145;some adulteries and fornications&#146; but strenuously denied the capital charge. He was found guilty of buggery on 27 November. The death of the acting lord deputy, Sir Christopher Wandesford, prevented his intended deconsecration, and he was hanged on Oxmantown Green in Dublin on 5 December. After a service in St John's in the late evening he was buried, at his own request, in a rubbish dump in the corner of the churchyard of St John the Evangelist in Fishamble Street.<br>
<br>An account of Atherton's last days, <span class="italic">The Penitant Death of a Woeful Sinner</span>, published in May 1641 by Nicholas Barnard, dean of Ardagh, who had attended him and preached at his funeral, strongly affirmed his innocence: the contrary view had been expressed in a rhyming pamphlet published some months previously which reviewed Atherton's career under the title <span class="italic">The life and death of John Atherton, who for incest, buggery and many other enormous crimes, after having lived a vicious life died a shameful death</span>. Its version of his conduct was restated in <span class="italic">Bishop Atherton's Case Discuss'd</span>, published in 1711 after the publication of John Dunton's <span class="italic">Athenianism</span> had drawn attention to a detailed account of the Minehead apparition written by the nonconformist minister John Quick in 1680, which provided full details of Mrs Leakey's disclosures. Posterity has been inclined to accept Bernard's vindication and to assume that Atherton was the victim of revenge for his successful recovery of church lands. No convincing culprit has been disclosed, however, and the assumption that it was inconceivable that a man &#145;of his years, education and function should be guilty of so unnatural and brutal a piece of lust as he was charged with&#146; no longer seems safe  (King).<br>
