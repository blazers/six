<span class="headword">Eleanor</span>, countess of Pembroke and Leicester  (1215?&#150;1275), <span class="occ">princess</span>, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/14841/', "King John")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/14483/', "Isabella of Angoul&#234;me")</script>, was born probably in 1215, a year before the death of her father. Her brothers and sisters were the future <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/12950/', "Henry III")</script>, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/23501/', "Richard (future earl of Cornwall)")</script>, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/14820/', "Joan")</script>, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/14482/', "Isabella")</script>. In 1224, at the age of nine, she was married to the powerful <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18127/', "William (II) Marshal, earl of Pembroke")</script>, a man about fifteen years her senior, at the behest of the king's council, after some three years of debate as to whether she should marry a foreign prince. The earl acquired a papal mandate and won both Eleanor and substantial revenues and estates in England, Wales, and Ireland. Until the marriage was consummated in 1229 Eleanor remained at her brother's court under the guardianship of Cecily of Sandford; thereafter she accompanied the Marshal on his travels in England, France, and Ireland. In 1231, however, at the marriage celebrations of Richard, earl of Cornwall, William Marshal died suddenly, and the grieving Eleanor took a vow of chastity in the presence of Edmund, archbishop of Canterbury. The king seized her estates, while her brother-in-law, Richard Marshal, earl of Pembroke, her husband's heir, took many valuable chattels. She retired to the castle of Inkberrow (Worcestershire), and in 1233 compounded with her brother and Earl Richard for &pound;400 yearly, less than a quarter of the annual value of her estates. Their failure to meet these obligations, together with Eleanor's extravagant spending, led to substantial debts. Henry III made spasmodic payments towards some of these, and in 1237 granted her Odiham Castle (Hampshire) which became her principal residence.<br>
<br>In January 1238 Eleanor married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/19049/', "Simon de Montfort")</script> in secret. When their union became known at court, Richard, earl of Cornwall, and other councillors were greatly angered, and Archbishop Edmund appealed to the pope on the grounds that Eleanor had broken her solemn vow. Montfort visited Rome to obtain a confirmation of the union, and on 28 November 1238, shortly after his return, Eleanor gave birth to their eldest child at Kenilworth. The following spring the king confirmed the earldom of Leicester to Montfort, and ordered that Eleanor's dowry be paid to him. In August 1239, however, Henry publicly turned on him, accusing him of defiling his sister before marriage, bribing the pope, and using the crown as security for his debts; Montfort and Eleanor fled in haste from England to France. While Montfort raised funds for a crusade, and made a return visit to England, Eleanor probably remained in France. She then stayed at Brindisi in southern Italy, in a castle belonging to her brother-in-law, the emperor Frederick II, while Montfort joined Richard of Cornwall's crusade in Palestine. 1242 saw the restoration of Eleanor and Simon de Montfort to the king's favour and she accompanied her husband on campaign in Poitou. The ruinous expense of this compounded their financial problems; but the king met their debts in part and settled an annual 500 marks on Montfort as Eleanor's dower, although the issue of her dower from her earlier marriage remained unresolved.<br>
<br>At the same time Henry made a formal grant of Kenilworth Castle to Eleanor, and this became her principal residence. Her eldest son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/19048/', "Henry de Montfort")</script>, was followed by others: <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/19050/', "Simon de Montfort the younger")</script>, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/19045/', "Amaury de Montfort")</script>, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/19047/', "Guy de Montfort")</script>, Richard, and a daughter, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/19046/', "Eleanor de Montfort")</script>. Robert Grosseteste, bishop of Lincoln, was their tutor and the Franciscan theologian Adam Marsh acted as confessor to Eleanor herself. A vivid insight into her fiery temperament emerges from letters she received from him in 1251: Marsh gently upbraids her for her language and temper, her contentiousness, and her extravagance. The last point is well borne out in her surviving household roll of 1265; yet so too is her administrative capacity. Between 1248 and 1254 Simon de Montfort, as seneschal of Gascony, spent most of his time abroad; Eleanor accompanied him in 1249&#150;50, 1251, and 1253, and on later visits to Paris to negotiate peace with Louis IX of France over Gascony. The issue of her dowry, which remained unsettled, featured in the provisions of Oxford (1258) and complicated the settlement with Louis contained in the treaty of Paris. Eventually ratified in 1259, this included a renunciation by Eleanor and Montfort of their own hereditary rights in France, while 15,000 marks due to Henry III under the treaty were set aside to act as a pledge for his future settlement of Eleanor's claims to dower in England. But although arbitrators were appointed, no final agreement was reached, even though the French king and queen later tried to mediate.<br>
<br>Eleanor remained at her stronghold at Kenilworth while Montfort and their sons led the baronial coalition which defeated Henry III and Prince Edward in 1264; in 1265, as the tide turned against them, she moved south to Dover, where in August, after the battle of Evesham, she received the news of the death of her husband and her son Henry. Her next son, Simon, was holding Richard, Eleanor's brother, a prisoner at Kenilworth, and released him only on condition that he protect Eleanor's interests. This was of little effect against the king's desire to disinherit and banish Eleanor; but Prince Edward, who took Dover Castle from her in October with the help of the prisoners there, allowed her a dignified retreat into exile in France. Here she retired to the Dominican convent at Montargis, founded by her sister-in-law Amicia de Montfort. In 1267, with the help of Louis IX, she obtained an annual payment of &pound;500 from the English exchequer provided that she remained in exile; this was confirmed in 1273 by Edward I. She died in 1275 (before 3 June) and was buried at Montargis.<br>
