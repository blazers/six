<span class="headword">Carr,  Arthur</span>  (1855&#150;1947), <span class="occ">biscuit manufacturer</span>, was born at Bowerbank, Barton, Westmorland, on 16 August 1855, the younger son of John Carr (1824&#150;1912) and his wife, Harriet Ellis. John Carr's elder brother was Jonathan Dodgson Carr, who in 1831 founded the milling and biscuit making firm of Carr &amp; Co. in Carlisle. After completing his apprenticeship, John Carr became a farmer and occasionally travelled for the firm. Having visited the rival biscuit manufacturing firm of Peek Frean &amp; Co. (established in 1857 at Bermondsey), Carr joined that business in 1860 and subsequently moved with his family to London.<br>
<br>The Carrs being Quakers, Arthur probably attended a Friends' day school near his Clapham home. After he and his elder brother Ellis (1852&#150;1930) had spent a year in Germany, in 1872 he became an apprentice in Peek Frean at &pound;3 a week, initially employed to open each morning's post. He nevertheless made rapid progress and was made a partner in 1877, two years after his brother. On 2 June 1881 he married Marie Georgette Baumann (<i>b</i>. 1855/6); they had two sons. About this time he left the Quakers to join the Church of England.<br>
<br>In the 1880s and 1890s Peek Frean's progress was only slow: turnover fluctuated, while profits were inadequate. The Carrs had to cope with three unprogressive senior partners on the Peek side. Even so, after a visit to the United States, where he was impressed by their employment, Arthur Carr was able to recruit female clerks into the office. In 1901, with the disappearance of the obstructive partners, the Carrs registered Peek Frean &amp; Co. Ltd as a limited company. Since John Carr was now elderly and the diffident Ellis immersed himself in production, Arthur Carr thereafter dominated the company. At first a joint managing director with his brother, in 1904 he became chairman and sole managing director. He used his organizing talents and energies not only to build the company up into an industry leader, but also to create contacts with the rest of the biscuit industry.<br>
<br>In particular, Carr launched important new varieties of biscuit, and backed them with innovative advertising and publicity schemes. These included the enduringly successful Pat-a-Cake of 1902, of the novel shortcake type. The first ever cream sandwich biscuit, the Bourbon, followed in 1910 and the Custard Cream in 1913. A range of the company's assortments also caught the public's fancy.<br>
<br>Realizing the importance of marketing, Carr spent freely on newspaper and display advertising, which featured catchy slogans such as &#145;For goodness sake, eat Pat-a-Cake&#146;. Among his ingenious publicity stunts, he treated some 20,000 London grocers to a free outing at the Crystal Palace, and sent 200,000 picture postcards to housewives up and down the country, with alluring (and frequently misinterpreted) messages which turned out to be about gift schemes. A 33-minute film of the company's activities (1904) was one of the earliest of its kind to be made in Britain. Deplored by rivals, such wheezes helped to double the company's sales between 1900 and 1913 and almost quadrupled profits.<br>
<br>Carr tirelessly strove for closer co-operation with similar companies in spite of remaining outside the Association of Biscuit Manufacturers, set up in 1903 to counter the increasing power of grocers. He had more ambitious plans for the industry: to corral member firms into a huge biscuit combine, like those in soap and tobacco. His idea was both to end cut-throat competition and to improve the low wages in the industry. In 1912 Carr unavailingly wooed Huntley and Palmers, the potential leader in any combine; and he was no more successful in discussions with the Scottish and Irish firms manufacturing &#145;quality&#146; biscuits.<br>
<br>The post-war problems of high income tax and death duties persuaded the directors of Huntley and Palmers in 1921 to merge with Peek Frean into the Associated Biscuit Manufacturers Ltd. Within this holding company both units maintained their own production and marketing strategies. Carr was first vice-chairman, becoming chairman in 1923. No other company joined them. Carr retired in 1927, when turnover of Peek Frean was nearly &pound;2 million, with profits of &pound;230,000: both greater than those of Huntley and Palmers. He nevertheless continued to go into the office, declaring that he &#145;would be seen as before&#146;  (<span class="italic">DBB</span>).<br>
<br>In appearance, his gold pince-nez and high collar stamped Carr as essentially Victorian in habit and outlook. As a youngster, he had ridden into work from Clapham on horseback; later he could be seen boarding a London bus just like any ordinary commuter. He found the intrusions of the telephone and unheralded visitors distasteful. Like his father before him, he concerned himself with all aspects of his employees' lives. From 1889 the company had in-house medical facilities, justified by him as &#145;a business proposition&#146;. In 1905 free dental and optician's services were added. He organized an evening school for the younger hands. A keen cricketer until well into the 1890s, he also established a sports club in 1905 and became chairman. In 1922 he and his brother jointly gave &pound;10,000 to set up an employees' benevolent club. Seven years later they introduced a pensions scheme with donations totalling &pound;130,000.<br>
<br>Carr kept free of public commitments, and therefore remained unknown to the wider world. His many outside benefactions were either anonymous or made unobtrusively. When he died at his home, 10 The Downs, Wimbledon, on 23 May 1947, neither the local nor national press seems to have noticed his passing.<br>
