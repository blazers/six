<span class="headword">Temple, Sir  John</span>  (1600&#150;1677), <span class="occ">judge and historian</span>, was born in Ireland, the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27121/', "Sir William Temple (1554/5&#150;1627)")</script>, provost of Trinity College, Dublin, and Martha (<i>d</i>. in or after 1627), daughter of Robert Harrison of Derbyshire. His father was knighted by Viscount Grandison in 1622. After graduating BA (1617) and MA (1620) from Trinity College, Dublin, John Temple entered Lincoln's Inn in 1620 and then spent some time travelling abroad. On 22 June 1627 he married Mary (<i>d</i>. 1638), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/12160/', "Dr John Hammond (c.1555&#150;1617)")</script> of Chertsey, Surrey, and his wife, Mary Harrison (<i>d</i>. 1650). They had four sons and three daughters before Mary's death at Penshurst, Kent, in November 1638.<br>
<br>Temple was a gentleman pensioner by the time he was knighted during the king's coronation visit to Scotland in 1633. At court in England, Temple was the friendly associate of Robert Sidney, second earl of Leicester, on whose behalf he lobbied assertively for the post of secretary of state during the earl's absence on embassy to France. Later he conducted Leicester's end of negotiations for appointment as lord lieutenant of Ireland. Temple was in the north of England with the king in the spring of 1639; he wrote several accounts of developments there to the earl. He was consistently solicitous of Leicester's often straitened financial situation. In the teeth of some opposition in the Irish parliament, Temple was created master of the rolls of Ireland on 31 January 1641, in succession to Sir Christopher Wandesford, having purchased the office. He did not leave to take up his appointment until August. On his arrival he was admitted a privy councillor at Dublin Castle.<br>
<br>When the Irish rising broke out in October 1641 Temple was of the greatest service to government in provisioning the city of Dublin. On 23 July 1642 he was returned MP for Meath, and resided at Staplestown, co. Carlow. In the struggle between crown and parliament Temple's inclinations drew him to the side of the latter, and, in consequence of the vehement resistance he offered to the cessation, he was in August 1643 suspended from his office by the lords justices Borlase and Tichborne, acting on instructions from Charles I, and, with Sir William Parsons, Sir Adam Loftus, and Sir Robert Meredith, imprisoned in Dublin Castle. He was charged with having written in May and June two scandalous letters against the king, which had been used to allege that Charles favoured the rebels. His imprisonment lasted nearly a year; he was then exchanged for Sir Thomas Malet, who was being held by parliament. In 1646 he was recruited to a vacant seat for Chichester in the English House of Commons, receiving at the same time its special thanks for his services to the English interest in Ireland at the beginning of the rising. Shortly afterwards he joined the Westminster committee responsible for overseeing Irish affairs.<br>
<br>Also that year, Temple published his <span class="italic">History of the Irish Rebellion</span> which made an immediate and great sensation. As the work of a professed eye-witness, and one whose position entitled him to speak with authority, its statements were received with unquestioning confidence, and the work did much to inflame popular indignation in England against the Irish, and to justify the severe treatment afterwards meted out to them by Cromwell. But its deliberate exaggeration of the blood-letting which took place in 1641 was just one aspect of the book's partisan intent. Temple was an important member of an &#145;Irish independent&#146; interest which aimed to prevent any reconciliation between parliament and the marquess of Ormond, the lord lieutenant who had negotiated a truce with the rebels in September 1643. By stoking the fires of retributive rage against Catholic atrocity, Temple probably hoped to implicate Ormond as an accessory to massacre after the fact (an undertaking made more explicit with the publication of Adam Meredith's <span class="italic">Ormonds Curtains Drawn</span>, in which Temple may well have had a hand). Temple also saw the manipulation of opinion in England for a war of imperial conquest in Ireland as a way of undermining the principal rival to the Irish independents for dominance in planter affairs in the south, Murrough O'Brian, Lord Inchequin, who was an ally of leading Westminster presbyterians.<br>
<br>Publication of Temple's history of the rebellion coincided with the appointment of Philip Sidney, Lord Lisle, eldest son of the second earl of Leicester, as the new lord lieutenant of Ireland in January 1646. This appointment was part of a strategy which also involved the disavowal of a joint Anglo-Scottish solution to the continuing Irish question. Inasmuch as it also encouraged the adoption of a scorched earth policy of total conquest, Temple's tract accorded well with the desires of the adventurers who had a substantial stake in the complete subjugation of the Irish. Temple was appointed to Lisle's privy council, accompanying him to Ireland in 1647. When Lisle's commission ended in April 1647, Temple returned with him to England. Resuming his place at Westminster, Temple proceeded to harry Inchequin's agent, Sir Philip Perceval, recently returned as a recruiter member, in a campaign of vilification which coincided with the impeachment of the eleven members by independents in the lower house friendly to the interests of the army.<br>
<br>In 1647, after the conclusion of the peace between Ormond and the English parliament, Temple was appointed a commissioner for the government of Munster, and on 16 October the following year he was made joint commissioner with Sir William Parsons for the administration of the great seal of Ireland. But, having supported the majority in favour of pursuing further the peace talks with the king then being held at Newport on the Isle of Wight, Temple was purged from the House of Commons in December 1648. He appears to have held aloof from the Commonwealth regime until 21 November 1653, when he was appointed as a commissioner for the settlement of the estates belonging to delinquents in Ireland. In 1655 he went to Ireland with a highly commendatory letter from Cromwell to Lord Deputy Fleetwood and his council of state in a successful bid to regain the office of master of the rolls. In September that year he and Sir Robert King, Benjamin Worsley, and others were appointed to a commission for letting and setting of houses and lands belonging to the state in the counties of Dublin, Kildare, and Carlow; on 13 June 1656 Temple was appointed a commissioner for determining disputes over the land settlement arising among the adventurers. For these services, so it is said, he received on 6 July 1658 a grant of two leases for twenty-one years: one comprised the town and lands of Moyle, Castletown, and Park, adjoining the town of Carlow, amounting to about 1490 acres, in part afterwards confirmed to him under the <span class="roman">Act of Settlement</span> on 18 June 1666; the other was made up of certain lands in the barony of Balrothery West, co. Dublin, to which were added those of Lispoble in the same county on 30 March 1659 for a similar term of years. He obtained license to go to England for a whole year or more on 21 April 1659.<br>
<br>At the Restoration, Temple was confirmed in his office of master of the rolls, sworn a member of the privy council, and appointed a trustee for the army officers who had remained loyal to Ormond and the Stuarts in 1649. On 4 May 1661 he and his eldest son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27122/', "William Temple (1628&#150;1699)")</script>, were elected to represent co. Carlow in the Irish parliament. On 6 May he obtained, for the payment of a fine of &pound;540, a reversionary lease from the queen mother, Henrietta Maria, of the park of Blandesby or Blansby, Pickering, Yorkshire, for a term of forty years. That summer he wrote several letters to the earl of Leicester describing his fears for a renewed outbreak by the Irish Catholics, encouraged as they were, in Temple's estimation, by the king's repeated interventions on their behalf for the restoration of property they claimed they had been deprived of wrongfully. Temple himself received a confirmation in perpetuity of his lands in co. Dublin, including those of Palmerstown, under the <span class="roman">Act of Settlement</span> in 1666; to these were added on 20 May 1669 others in counties Kilkenny, Meath, Westmeath, and Dublin. Other grants followed. On 3 May 1672 he received 144 acres formerly part of Phoenix Park, and on 16 November 1675 certain lands, fishings, and so on, in and near Chapelizod. He was appointed vice-treasurer of Ireland in 1673, but died on 12 November 1677. He was buried beside his father in Trinity College near the campanile, having that year donated &pound;100 to the college for building works. He was survived by two sons, William and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27115/', "John Temple (1632&#150;1705)")</script>, and two daughters. Temple's <span class="italic">History</span> was reprinted in 1679, helping once more to fan the flames of partisan politics in England. A decade later, James II's Irish parliament of 1689 ordered the book to be burnt by the hand of the public hangman.<br>
