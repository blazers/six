<span class="headword">Tindal, Sir  Nicholas Conyngham</span>  (1776&#150;1846), <span class="occ">judge</span>, was born at Coval Hall, near Chelmsford, on 12 December 1776, the son of Robert Tindal, a solicitor of Chelmsford, and his wife, Sarah, only daughter of John Pocock of Greenwich. He was related to the celebrated deist Matthew Tindal and was the great-grandson of the historian Nicholas Tindal. He was educated at Chelmsford grammar school, where Thomas Naylor was master, before going at the age of nineteen to Trinity College, Cambridge, where he graduated BA in 1799 as eighth wrangler, winning the chancellor's gold medal. He was elected fellow of Trinity in 1801, and in 1802 graduated MA; he was awarded an honorary DCL degree from the University of Oxford in 1834. In 1802 he entered as a student at Lincoln's Inn in London. Seven years later, on 2 September 1809, he married Merelina (<i>d</i>. 1818), the youngest daughter of Thomas Symonds, a captain in the Royal Navy. They had one daughter and four sons; their eldest son, Nicholas Tindal (<i>d</i>. 1842), became vicar of Sandhurst in Gloucestershire, and the youngest, Charles John (<i>d</i>. 1853), a barrister of Lincoln's Inn.<br>
<br>On 20 June 1809 Tindal was called to the bar, having previously read with Sir John Richardson and practised as a special pleader. He joined the northern circuit, and earned a considerable practice on the strength of his wide and accurate learning (he was never a good advocate). His learning, even in obsolete law, was shown to advantage in the case <i>Ashford v. Thornton</i>, in which he successfully claimed for his client the right of wager of battle, later abolished by statute. Henry Brougham and Parke (afterwards Lord Wensleydale) were among his pupils. He was subsequently with Brougham as counsel for Queen Caroline in her trial in 1820  (H. P. Brougham, <span class="italic">The Life and Times of Henry Lord Brougham</span>, 1871, 2.381).<br>
<br>Tindal entered parliament in 1824 as a tory member for the Wigtown burghs, and became solicitor-general on 20 September 1826 at a time of change caused by Copley's appointment as master of the rolls, and was knighted. Also in 1826, he was returned to parliament for Harwich; but in 1827, Copley's becoming lord chancellor created a vacancy at the University of Cambridge, and Tindal was elected by 479 votes against 378 for William John Bankes. With characteristic modesty he declined to assert his claim to become attorney-general, either against James Scarlett (afterwards first Baron Abinger) in 1827 or against Sir Charles Wetherell in 1828  (Arnould, <span class="italic">Life of Lord Denman</span>, 1873, 1.206). On 9 June 1829 he was appointed chief justice of the common pleas in succession to William Draper Best, first Baron Wynford, a position which he kept until his death. Among the cases which he tried were Norton's action against Lord Melbourne for criminal conversation and the murder trials of Courvoisier and MacNaghten. He worked up to ten days before his death from a stroke at Folkestone on 6 July 1846. He was buried at Kensal Green cemetery, Middlesex, on 14 July.<br>
<br>Tindal was esteemed by contemporary lawyers for his grasp of principle, accuracy of statement, skill in analysis, and store of case law. He became somewhat procrastinating and eccentric as a judge at the end of his life, but retained the respect and affection of those who practised before him. He had a considerable, highly legal wit, of which some examples are given in Benjamin Robinson's <span class="italic">Bench and Bar</span> (1889, 153&#150;8).<br>
