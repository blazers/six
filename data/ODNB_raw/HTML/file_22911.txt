<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Pusey,  Philip</span>  (1799&#150;1855), <span class="occ">agriculturist</span>, was born at Pusey, Berkshire, on 25 June 1799, the eldest of the three sons of Philip Bouverie Pusey (1724&#150;1828) and his wife, Lucy (1772&#150;1858), daughter of Robert Sherard, fourth earl of Harborough, and widow of Sir Thomas Cave. His father was the youngest son of Jacob Bouverie, first Viscount Folkestone, whose sister married the last male member of the Pusey family; the Pusey sisters bequeathed the Pusey estates to their brother's nephew by marriage, Philip Bouverie, on condition that Bouverie took the name of Pusey, which he did in 1784, inheriting the estates of some 5000 acres in Berkshire in 1789. Philip Pusey's next brother was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22910/', "Edward Bouverie Pusey")</script>, and a sister, Charlotte, married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6423/', "Richard Lynch Cotton")</script>, provost of Worcester College, Oxford. Philip was educated at Eton College and Christ Church, Oxford (where he matriculated in 1817, though he left without taking a degree), becoming great friends with Henry John George Herbert, Lord Porchester and later third earl of Carnarvon, to whose sister Lady Emily Herbert he became engaged in 1818. The marriage took place on 4 October 1822, no doubt postponed because of the youth of the couple, and in the interval Pusey went on tour with Porchester, both tourists being captured by rebel guerrillas near Montserrat in Catalonia, who temporarily mistook them for constitutionalists or soldiers in the army of the Cortes. Pusey and his wife settled for six years in Rome, at the Palazzo Aldobrandini, and became friendly with Chevalier Christian Bunsen (later German ambassador in London). In memory of his time in Rome, Pusey presented a pedestal for the font in the German chapel at Rome, with groups in relief by Thorwaldsen.<br>
<br>In 1828 Pusey inherited the family estate and at once began to build a reputation as a progressive and practical farmer, taking the management of the home farm of between 300 and 400 acres into his own hands. The rise in reputation was meteoric, and in 1830 he was elected FRS. The development of his farming was more measured, and it was not until the late 1840s that he laid out the water meadows at the Faringdon farm which secured him a permanent place in agricultural history through the detailed and laudatory notice by James Caird in <span class="italic">English Agriculture in 1850 and 1851</span> (1852). Pusey's fully developed farming system, hinging on the lush, and early, feed furnished by the water meadows in order to support a very large flock of ewes and early-maturing lambs, was similar to the Hampshire and Wiltshire sheep-and-barley farming with water meadows (somewhat oddly, Pusey apparently brought in experts from Devon to level his fields and construct the irrigation works), and the system was notable for close attention to detail rather than for radical innovation. His own farm had a &#145;fine dry easy-working soil &hellip; excellent corn and turnip land&#146;  (Caird, 107&#150;8), and was naturally well-drained. Pusey kept himself fully informed of all the latest developments in agriculture, however, and was an early enthusiast for the advantages of field drainage using the recently invented earthenware drainpipes. Convinced that the future prosperity and efficiency of agriculture depended on effective dissemination of information on good farming practice and reliable developments in technology, he played a prominent part in the formation in 1838 of what became, from 1840, the Royal Agricultural Society of England. He was a member of the original committee of management, and chairman of the committee for establishing a journal for the diffusion of agricultural information. He was thus the first editor of the <span class="italic">Journal of the Royal Agricultural Society of England</span>, until 1854, and contributed forty-seven articles to the <span class="italic">Journal</span> on such subjects as drainage, fertilizers, the breeding and feeding of sheep, water meadows, and agricultural machinery, as well as on surveys of the state of agriculture and the progress of agricultural knowledge. His contributions were informed by practical experience: the first trial of Cyrus Hall McCormick's reaping machine, for instance, was held on his farm in August 1851. He was president of the society in 1840&#150;41, and was again elected president in 1853. He was unable to attend the annual meeting and show at Lincoln in 1854 because of his wife's last illness; she died on 13 November 1854, only eight months before her husband.<br>
<br>An obituary of Pusey in 1855 justly noted that &#145;by a rare union of endowments he did much to win for agriculture a worthy place among the intellectual pursuits of the present day&#146;  (Acland, 608). By virtue of his social and political position he was also well placed to become one of the leading agricultural authorities in parliament. Already in 1828 he had published two political pamphlets on public finance, and in 1830 he was elected as MP for the Treasury borough of Rye, but was unseated on petition. Later in 1830 he was elected as one of the two members for Chippenham, but he lost that seat in the general election of April 1831, whereupon he migrated to Cashel. In 1832 he was an unsuccessful candidate for one of the two Berkshire county seats; he became one of the Berkshire MPs in 1835, and continued to be one until the 1852 election, when he withdrew after his re-election was opposed by George Henry Vansittart, an ultra-protestant protectionist; Pusey recorded, &#145;I hear that, among electioneering tricks, some call me a Puseyite. I am no more than Lord Shaftesbury is; but I will not consent to find fault with my brother in public&#146;.<br>
<br>As an MP Pusey spoke sparingly, but he was active on committees concerned with agriculture and in the 1840s was an adviser on agricultural matters to Peel and Gladstone, with whom he had a close political relationship. He provided Gladstone with a long memorandum in the early 1840s containing a programme of what needed to be done for agriculture  (Spring, 140), and he stayed at Drayton in 1844 to talk to Peel's tenantry about scientific farming. In February 1846 Peel wrote to Pusey, &#145;I know of no one who has done more than yourself to enable the Country to enter into successful competition with other Countries in respect to agricultural produce&#146;  (ibid., 140). Pusey, however, who had come to the conclusion that the corn laws could not be retained, broadly on Caird's grounds that high farming was the best substitute for protection, voted against repeal on the first reading later that month, in deference to the strong feelings of his county constituents. He then absented himself from parliament so as not to obstruct Peel's policy&#151;conduct which caused Peel to take a more jaundiced view of his character, noting, &#145;Mr Pusey's letter is a good specimen of an agricultural leader&#151;I never saw such an avowal under a Senator's own handwriting&#146;  (Gash, 614).<br>
<br>Pusey's parliamentary services to agricultural interests centred on his conviction that the productivity, and hence the international competitiveness, of British farming could be vastly improved by more intensive capital investment, especially in field drainage, and that investment was being significantly held back by the legal inability of many of the larger landowners to find the money. This was because strict settlements, which governed the estates of most of the aristocracy and gentry, normally prevented the owner for the time being, or the life tenant, from mortgaging the family estate in order to invest in its improvement. Accordingly Pusey's chief aim was to obtain legislation that would enable these &#145;limited owners&#146; to borrow in order to invest in improvements, and his efforts became the origin of a whole strand of Victorian land-law reforms designed to raise the economic efficiency of land ownership without undermining or destroying its social and family structure. His direct legislative achievement was modest. In 1840 he piloted a bill &#145;to enable Owners of Settled Estates to defray the Expenses of draining the same&#146;, which became 3 and 4 Vict. c. 55, known as <span class="roman">Pusey's Act</span>, which was very little used because it required resort to the great delays and expense of chancery. As he later explained, he regarded his Act as tactical rather than practical; its scope was restricted to drainage, to the exclusion of other types of investment: &#145;because of the extreme difficulty of carrying it in the House of Commons I had to be content with just the principle, for it was so much guarded as to make it too expensive for persons to use&#146;  (&#145;Select committee &hellip; entailed estates&#146;, 12.1372). The crucial point was that Pusey had carried onto the statute book the principle of overruling family settlements in the interests of encouraging borrowing to make productive investments; thereafter other hands devised less costly and more efficient administrative machinery for the practical application of this principle.<br>
<br>Pusey soon extended his concern about the adequacy of the supply of capital to agriculture so as to embrace tenant farmers as well as landowners, arguing that tenants would not invest in the latest developments in farming techniques, such as the use of artificial fertilizers or feeding stuffs, unless they could be certain of reaping the full returns on their outlays. Thus was initiated the campaign to provide outgoing tenants with compensation for unexhausted improvements, a concept which Pusey called &#145;tenant right&#146;, much to the alarm of many landowners, who resented the interference with their property rights and anticipated the later cry of &#145;tenant right&#146; becoming &#145;landlord wrong&#146;. For this reason he achieved even less on this front, obtaining a select committee on agricultural customs in 1848, which he chaired, but being humiliated by having his chairman's conclusions and recommendations rejected by his committee in favour of the less radical version proposed by Edward Pleydell-Bouverie; this roundly repudiated any idea of compelling landlords to compensate their tenants and relied instead simply on voluntary agreements. Bills did pass the Commons in 1849 and 1850, but were rejected by the Lords: there the matter was left, until the first <span class="roman">Agricultural Holdings Act</span> was passed in 1875 (itself a largely ineffectual measure). Nevertheless, as Disraeli observed when moving the second reading of the 1875 bill, &#145;Mr Pusey was the first person to introduce into this House the term &#147;tenant rights&#148;&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>).<br>
<br>Pusey's friend Bunsen called him &#145;a most unique union of a practical Englishman and an intellectual German, so that when speaking in one capacity one might think he had lost sight of the other&#146;  (Bunsen, 1.522). Pusey was that rare being, a country gentleman who understood ideas and mingled with the leading thinkers of the time. He breakfasted with Samuel Rogers and Monckton Milnes, and he entertained Lord Spencer, Sir Robert Peel, Gladstone, Carlyle, Whewell, Grote, Galley Knight, Bishop Wilberforce, and Lord Stanhope. In 1840 he became a member of the original committee of the London Library, and in 1851 he was chairman of the agricultural implement section of the Great Exhibition; he brought 500 of his labourers to London to see the exhibition, a visit commemorated by the presentation to him of a silver snuffbox. Thereafter in almost every cottage on the Pusey estate there hung an engraving of Pusey's portrait with a picture of the snuffbox underneath. Many of these cottages had been improved or rebuilt, to designs by the architect George Edmund Street; and as a model landlord Pusey provided his labourers with allotments, and organized works to keep them in constant employ. He was fond of sport, and was one of the best whips in England, once driving a four-in-hand over the Alps. In 1834 he wrote the hymn &#145;Lord of Our Life, and God of Our Salvation&#146;, which referred to the contemporary threats to the Church of England both from within and without.<br>
<br>Pusey and his wife Emily had three children: an only son, Sidney Edward Bouverie-Pusey (1839&#150;1911), who succeeded to the family estate, and two daughters; the elder, Edith Lucy, died unmarried in 1904, whereas the second daughter, Clara, married Francis Charteris Fletcher in 1862, and their son, Philip Francis Bouverie-Pusey (whose name was changed from Fletcher), inherited the Pusey estate when her brother died in 1911 without children. After the death of his wife in 1854 Philip Pusey went to live with his brother at Christ Church, Oxford, and within a week he was paralysed by a stroke; after a second stroke he died there on 9 July 1855.<br>
