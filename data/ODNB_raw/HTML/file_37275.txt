<span class="headword">Chantrell,  Robert Dennis</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1793, <em>d.</em> 1872), <span class="occ">architect</span>, was baptized on 24 January 1793 in Newington, Southwark, the eldest of the seven children of Robert Chantrell (1765&#150;1840), a businessman, then of Newington and later of Bruges, and his wife, Mary Ann, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Dennis (1766&#150;1829). He was an articled pupil of Sir John Soane from 1807 to 1814. On 12 February 1814 he married Elizabeth Caroline Boham (<i>d</i>. 1863), with whom he had four sons and four daughters. One son, John Boham Chantrell, later trained in his father's office.<br>
<br>In 1818 Chantrell was employed to carry out repairs on the parish church in Halifax, Yorkshire, and the following year he settled in Leeds, from where he developed a substantial practice in the Yorkshire area, particularly as a designer of churches. From 1823 onwards he built over twenty in the region, a number of them for the commissioners for building new churches established under the <span class="roman">Million Pound Act</span>, and in 1829 he was appointed surveyor to York Minster. In 1846, however, he returned to London and virtually withdrew from active engagement in his profession. Three years later he became one of the architects who inspected designs for the Incorporated Church Building Society, while the Yorkshire practice was continued for a short time, at a low level of activity, by his son John Boham Chantrell.<br>
<br>Chantrell's secular buildings were in the Greek revival manner&#151;notably the South Market at Leeds (1823&#150;4; dem.), which was centred on an ambitious, circular, market cross of the Doric order&#151;but his churches were mainly in the Gothic style. Most of them are of the lancet type particularly associated with the commissioners' buildings and many&#151;for example, Christ Church, Meadow Lane, Leeds (1823&#150;6; dem.), and Honley, near Huddersfield (1842&#150;3)&#151;had thin arcade piers of cast iron; but Chantrell was a serious student of Gothic. His essentially pre-ecclesiological manner was given a variety and solidity by the use of carefully copied detail, and some of his later churches of the 1840s, such as Armitage Bridge, near Huddersfield (1847&#150;8), were based on a system of proportions derived from medieval Gothic buildings, a subject on which he published a paper in <span class="italic">The Builder</span> in 1847. His most important work, St Peter's, Leeds (1837&#150;41), a rebuilding of the town's old parish church, was one of the key ecclesiastical projects of the time, a landmark in both the scholarly revival of the Gothic style and the high-church revival of Anglican Christianity, in which an accurate use of Perpendicular Gothic detail was combined with an approximation to a medieval plan form, complete with a fully developed chancel. A further dimension to his work was his occasional use of the neo-Norman style, for example at Shadwell church near Leeds (1841&#150;2), while the steeple he added in 1839 to the early eighteenth-century Holy Trinity Church in Leeds is an ingenious pastiche in the manner of Sir Christopher Wren, and shows an unusual sympathy for the architecture of that period.<br>
<br>Chantrell exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1812&#150;14 and in Leeds at the Northern Society for the Encouragement of the Fine Arts from 1822, and he became a fellow of the Royal Institute of British Architects in 1836. In 1863 he retired to Sussex, and following the death of his first wife that year he married, on 2 December 1867, Mary Elizabeth Dear. He died at the Queen's Hotel in Norwood, Surrey, on 4 January 1872. His second wife survived him.<br>
