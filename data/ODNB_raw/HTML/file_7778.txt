<span class="headword">Dolben,  William</span>  (1588?&#150;1631), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, was the only son of John Dolben, from Segrwyd, Denbighshire, who had become a merchant at Haverfordwest and founded the Pembrokeshire branch of the family, and Alice, daughter of Richard Myddleton of Denbigh and sister of Sir Hugh Myddleton. He was educated at Westminster School and then Christ Church, Oxford, from where he matriculated on 10 February 1604 aged sixteen, and graduated BA on 6 June 1607. He proceeded MA as from All Souls on 18 June 1610 and was incorporated in that degree at Cambridge in 1614. He was admitted BD on 13 December 1617 and was awarded his doctorate on 15 June 1619.<br>
<br>Dolben acquired two Pembrokeshire benefices, Stackpool Elidyr (1616) and Lawrenny (1620), and in 1623 was instituted to the rectory of Llanynys in Denbighshire. In the same year, from 11 July until November, he held the rectory of Bartholomew by the Exchange in London, but on 8 November 1623 he was instituted to the rectories of Stanwick and of Benefield, Northamptonshire. Also in 1623, he married Elizabeth Williams, daughter of Captain Hugh Williams of Cochwillan, Caernarvonshire, and Elizabeth, sister of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29515/', "John Williams")</script>, bishop of Lincoln and later archbishop of York. It was undoubtedly through the agency of Bishop Williams that in 1629 Dolben was installed in the Lincoln prebend of Caistor. Dolben was reported in 1741 by his great-grandson to have been nominated for a Welsh bishopric, but this assertion is likely to rest on confusion with a relative, David Dolben, who in the year of the prebend's death became bishop of Bangor in succession to Lewis Bayly.<br>
<br>Dolben maintained links with his native Pembrokeshire. At his death he was still in possession of the rectory of Stackpool, leaving some of its profits to one of its parishioners, his &#145;most honoured and faithful friend&#146; Henry Lort. He bequeathed &pound;20, in addition to the provision made by his cousin William Myddleton, merchant, of London, towards the stipendiary lectureship at Haverfordwest inaugurated about 1620. He died in 1631 and was buried on 19 September at Stanwick, aged forty-two. He was survived by his sons <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7775/', "John Dolben (1625&#150;1686)")</script>, later archbishop of York, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7779/', "William Dolben (bap. 1627, d. 1694)")</script>, later justice of king's bench.<br>
