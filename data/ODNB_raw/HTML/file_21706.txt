<span class="headword">Pearse,  Edward</span>  (<em>c.</em>1633&#150;1673), <span class="occ">clergyman and ejected minister</span>, matriculated as a servitor from St John's College, Oxford, on 10 April 1652 and graduated BA on 27 June 1654. Of his parents it is known only that his mother's name was Anne and that she survived her son. On 27 June 1657 Edward Pearse was appointed Sunday morning preacher in the parish of St Margaret's, Westminster, and on 31 December that year his salary was increased by 50<i>s</i>. a year; he was appointed lecturer at Westminster Abbey on 20 May 1658. After his ejection in 1660, Pearse's whereabouts are not certainly known. <span class="italic">A Beam of Divine Glory &hellip; whereunto is Added The Soul's Rest in God</span>, published posthumously in 1674, contained &#145;Mr Pearse's last letter To my dearly beloved friends, to whom, by the providence of God, I have some years last past preached the Everlasting gospel&#146;. Perhaps his ministry was at or near Hampstead, for it was from there that the author signed his letter on 3 October 1672, during his last illness. He died, probably from tuberculosis, aged about forty according to Calamy, after the drafting of a codicil to his will on 21 March 1673, and before the grant of probate on 5 June following. In his will Pearse gave his wife's name as Grace and left provision for a daughter Sarah, aged less than ten years.<br>
<br>Pearse has previously sometimes been confused with <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21704/', "Edward Pierce (1630/31&#150;1694)")</script>, Church of England clergyman, but neither Edward Pearse nor Edward Pierce appears to have been related to <a name="cosubject_21706"></a><span class="headword">William Pearse</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1626, <em>d.</em> 1691), <span class="occ">clergyman and ejected minister</span>, who was born at Ermington, Devon, and baptized, probably at Ermington, on 26 January 1626, the son of Francis Pearse of Ermington. He attended school at Plympton St Mary and studied at Exeter College, Oxford, from 1649 to 1652. On 7 December 1655 he was admitted as vicar of the sequestered living of Dunsford, Devon, and he was ordained on 15 September 1659 by presbyters at Wolborough. After his ejection in 1660 Pearse returned to Ermington and rented Stretch-leigh Barten, &#145;being well skilled in Husbandry&#146;  (<span class="italic">Calamy rev.</span>). In 1669 Pearse succeeded as minister to the congregation which met at Tavistock Abbey, home of the earl of Bedford; he preached at the abbey for some nineteen years. At an unknown date he married. His wife's name was Mary, and they had at least two sons, Francis and William, and four daughters, Mary, Elizabeth, Agnes, and Damaris. In April 1672 he received a general presbyterian licence as of Dunsford, but he met with much official harassment: &#145;Six times a Year the Bailiff came to Stretch-leigh-house, to warn Mr. Pearse and his Wife, with his Son and Daughters, to appear at the Assizes at Exeter, to answer for Riots &hellip; and not obeying the Laws&#146;  (ibid.). Pearse moved to London, but found that it, too, was dangerous for dissenters. On 21 January 1683 the authorities raided Stephen Lobb's meeting-place and &#145;seiz'd one Mr. Pearse and one Marmaduke Roberts both Preachers, who were both committed to New Prison&#146;  (ibid.). By 1690 Pearse had returned to Devon, where he acted as co-pastor with Thomas Palke at Ashburton. He was instrumental in building a meeting-house in the town and signed his will there on 2 April 1690. William Pearse died at Ashburton on 17 March 1691 and was buried in the town.<br>
