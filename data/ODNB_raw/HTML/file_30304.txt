<span class="headword">Zuccarelli,  (Giacomo) Francesco</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1702, <em>d.</em> 1788), <span class="occ">landscape painter and draughtsman</span>, was born at Pitigliano, Grosseto, Italy, and baptized there on 15 August 1702, the third son of Bartolomeo Zuccarelli (1641&#150;1706), a tradesman, and his wife, Orazia Parrini (<i>b</i>. 1675), daughter of Domenico Parrini. He went when very young to Rome, studying there under several painters and practising as figure painter before specializing in landscape. By 1728 he was in Florence, where he etched some prints after earlier Florentine artists and exhibited two religious paintings in 1729.<br>
<br>From approximately 1732 Zuccarelli was settled in Venice and soon became widely celebrated for his prolific output of pastoral scenes, frequently engraved. He was extensively patronized by Joseph Smith, the British consul, for whom he painted some of his more vigorous and varied compositions (Royal Collection), and for Smith he collaborated with the architect Antonio Visentini on a series of fanciful landscapes with English Palladian buildings (the majority are in the Royal Collection). He also painted small portraits for Italian patrons, notably his friend in Bergamo, Count Francesco Maria Tassi, who subsequently published useful information about him. A rare example of an altarpiece by Zuccarelli is that of St Jerome Emiliani (1748, Pinacoteca Repossi, Chiari, Brescia).<br>
<br>In 1752 Zuccarelli left Venice for London. In the previous year he had met in Venice Richard Wilson and been painted by him (1751, Tate collection). Along with Smith, Wilson may have encouraged his travelling to a country where his landscapes were already popular. He remained in London until 1762, when a sale of his work was held on 10 February and announced in the catalogue as &#145;by reason of his returning to Italy&#146;. In 1765 he was back in London, exhibiting in that and the following year at the Free Society. In 1767 the paintings he sent to the Society of Artists included <span class="italic">Macbeth Encountering the Witches</span> (a version: Shakespeare Memorial Gallery, Stratford upon Avon). He was made a founder member of the Royal Academy in 1768 [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/94593', "Founders of the Royal Academy of Arts")</script>]. George III commissioned some paintings from him, including probably the large <span class="italic">Finding of Moses</span> (1768, Royal Collection), possibly the picture of the same subject exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1773 after Zuccarelli had returned finally to Italy. In 1774 he settled in Florence, where he died at his home in the via del Parione on 30 December 1788, being buried on the 31st in Santissima Trinita. His will refers to his wife, Giustina Agata Simonetti.<br>
<br>Under numerous influences, Zuccarelli created a distinctive style of decorative pastoral landscape, evolving little in his long, productive career. Some monotony is inevitable but his work at its best is agreeable and highly accomplished.<br>
