<span class="headword">Temple,  Henry</span>, second Viscount Palmerston  (1739&#150;1802), <span class="occ">politician and traveller</span>, was born on 4 December 1739, the only son of Henry Temple (<i>c</i>.1704&#150;1740), joint chief remembrancer of the Irish court of exchequer, and his second wife, Jane Barnard (<i>d</i>. 1789), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1456/', "Sir John Barnard (c.1685&#150;1764)")</script>, lord mayor of London in 1738. He inherited the viscountcy from his grandfather, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27110/', "Henry Temple, first Viscount Palmerston")</script>, in 1757. He was educated at Clare College, Cambridge, from 1757 to 1759 and embarked on three tours in England before he was twenty-one, visiting several aristocratic houses as well as Birmingham, Newcastle, Leeds, and other commercial centres, and thereby established a taste for travel which stayed with him all his life. On coming of age he acquired an income of &pound;7000 per annum from his family properties, half the sum coming from Irish estates in co. Sligo and a few properties in Dublin. He was a typical English absentee landlord, disliked the country and saw it as a land of bogs and barren mountains&#151;&#145;the most dreary waste I ever yet beheld&#146;, he wrote  (Connell, 352). His income from Ireland rose to &pound;6000 per annum out of a total of &pound;12,000 after his mother's death on 28 January 1789.<br>
<br>Palmerston took his seat in the Irish House of Lords on 22 October 1761 but he never spoke there. His political ambitions, such as they were, were centred on England and on 28 May 1762 he was elected for the Cornish pocket borough of East Looe, then the property of John Buller, through the good offices of Henry Bilson Legge, who was chancellor of the exchequer in the duke of Newcastle's administration. He was a desultory attender and a very occasional speaker in the house, preferring the delights of foreign travel to the boring duty of political life. He supported the preliminaries of the treaty of Paris in December 1762 and his neighbour Hans Stanley, member for Southampton, recommended him to George Grenville on 9 December 1764 as a man &#145;highly worth your seeking&#146;  (Grenville MSS). Palmerston nevertheless spoke against Grenville on the issue of general warrants on 29 January 1765, and Horace Walpole remarked with approval that he was &#145;a young man of sense&#146;  (Walpole, <span class="italic">Memoirs</span>, 2.45). Rockingham, who was on the lookout for talent, offered him a seat at the Board of Trade in December 1765 with a salary of &pound;1000 per annum, and he accepted despite his declaration that &#145;My views &hellip; have never been directed towards the attainment of any public employment&#146;  (Rockingham MSS). He remained in office in the subsequent ministry of Chatham, being transferred to the Admiralty board in September 1766. He retained that office under Grafton and North until December 1777, and was then promoted to the Treasury board where he stayed until the fall of North in March 1782.<br>
<br>Despite Palmerston's early promise, his political career took second place to his travels. He visited Paris in 1762 and was presented to the French royal family at Versailles, and in 1763 embarked on a grand tour of Europe which lasted eighteen months, visiting France, Switzerland, Rome, Naples, and northern Italy. He met John Wilkes in Paris, called on Voltaire at Ferney, and was introduced by Sir William Hamilton to classical antiquities at Naples. He returned to his house, Broadlands, in Hampshire, with a collection of antique marbles and sculptures. He had met his future first wife at Spa and they were married on 6 October 1767. She was Frances Poole (1733&#150;1769), daughter of Sir Francis Poole, second baronet, who had died in 1763, and his wife, Frances Pelham, who was a granddaughter of Sir John Pelham. Their marriage was happy, but on 1 June 1769 Frances died after giving birth to a stillborn daughter.<br>
<br>Palmerston had lost his seat at East Looe at the general election of 1768. His former patron Bilson Legge was dead and Buller had other plans for the borough, but his friend Hans Stanley invited him to become his colleague at Southampton, a more populous constituency. He was elected without undue expense, but at the next election in 1774 he found a safer refuge in the government borough of Hastings through the favour of Lord North. He supported North's American policy but spoke rarely: he was hampered by a stammer. On seventeen occasions between 1768 and 1774 he had intervened briefly in debates in parliament, but only one speech is recorded in the years 1774 to 1780, one between 1784 and 1790, and none thereafter. He had become a spectator rather than a participant.<br>
<br>Palmerston's reaction to his wife's death was to embark on his foreign travels once more. He spent five months in the autumn of 1770 mainly in Switzerland and he also continued his social life at home. He had been elected to Almack's in 1765 and the Society of Dilettanti in 1766, and he became a member of the Catch Club in 1771, where he enjoyed singing rounds and catches in the evenings. He also became intimate with Garrick, Reynolds, and Gibbon, and with Sir Joseph Banks, the president of the Royal Society, to which he was elected in 1776. He was a pallbearer at the funerals of the two former. He was not a gambler, except for small, nominal stakes at cards, but he spent large sums on the refurbishment and rebuilding of Broadlands by Capability Brown after 1768 and by Henry Holland after 1788. He remarried on 7 January 1783. His second wife was Mary Mee (1752&#150;1805), daughter of Benjamin Mee of Bath, who was a substantial city merchant in Fenchurch Street. He was not, however, financially successful and ended dependent on Palmerston's financial assistance.<br>
<br>Palmerston's second marriage was a love match like his first. His wife was a sociable, witty, and affectionate woman and they had two sons and three daughters. They carried on an extensive social life at their London houses at Sheen and Hanover Square. A contemporary remarked that no schoolboy was &#145;so fond of a breaking-up as Lord Palmerston is of a junket and pleasuring. [Their life is made a] toil of pleasure&#146;  (C. Burney, <span class="italic">Memoirs of Doctor Burney</span>, ed. F. d'Arblay, 3 vols., 1832, 3.271&#150;2). After 1790 they dined occasionally with the prince of Wales at Brighton and also with his estranged wife, Caroline, at Blackheath, and after they met Emma Hamilton in Paris in 1791 she became a frequent visitor and companion.<br>
<br>Palmerston drifted away from his former partisanship with Fox after the French Revolution. He had supported the Fox&#150;North coalition in 1783 against Shelburne, and voted against Pitt on the Regency question in 1788&#150;9 and over the Ochakov affair in 1792, but his travels in France in 1791 made him aware of the violent tendencies of the revolution. The Palmerstons arrived in Paris two weeks after the flight to Varennes and stayed three months, during which time he attended most of the debates in the constituent assembly, witnessing the increasingly hostile tone against the royal family. He saw the riot at the Champ de Mars on 17 July and with his wife waited on Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette at Versailles five days before the mob broke in and massacred the Swiss guards. They left Paris soon afterwards and retreated to Naples, where they spent twenty-six &#145;idyllic&#146; months before returning home.<br>
<br>Palmerston supported Pitt thereafter. He deplored the failure of Lord Fitzwilliam's viceroyalty of Ireland in 1795 but shared the view of his wife that the &#145;feebleness of character, duplicity and I may add treachery&#146; of the duke of Portland was to blame  (Connell, 373). When the Irish rising led to expectations of a union with Britain, Palmerston, foreseeing the abolition of the Irish House of Lords, and apparently fearing that as an Irish peer he would be disqualified from sitting in the Commons, solicited a British peerage, but he was unsuccessful, Pitt no doubt regarding him as too recent a convert to his policies.<br>
<br>Palmerston's attitude was also influenced by the falling off of his income from his Irish estates during the troubles of the 1790s. By 1799 his total debts exceeded &pound;30,000 and he had to sell two English properties and mortgage Broadlands. He had sustained his membership of the House of Commons after 1784 by purchase, Treasury support being no longer forthcoming under Pitt. In 1784 he bought a seat at Boroughbridge from the duke of Newcastle for &pound;2685&#151;substantially below the normal market price&#151;but in 1790 Newcastle refused to return him again because of his support of the opposition and he moved to Newport, Isle of Wight, for &pound;4200. In 1796 he secured his return at Winchester through the duke of Portland's good offices, but by the end of that parliament he had decided to give up any further search. On 3 November 1801, he wrote to his wife:<blockquote>I have sat in seven Parliaments and do not now find myself desirous of throwing away a great sum of money for the satisfaction of continuing any longer, nor in the situation in which I now stand would it be either proper or even justifiable for me to do so. (Connell, 448)</blockquote>He resolved to make a further attempt to secure a British peerage. In his draft letter to Addington he reminded him of this point and stated that he had always acted as &#145;an independent man and a zealous supporter of our constitution as it at present exists. &hellip; Favours of a lucrative kind I have not solicited&#146;  (ibid., 448). Again, however, he was disappointed and five months later he died of an &#145;ossification of the throat&#146; on 16 April 1802 at Hanover Square, London. His wife survived him less than three years, dying of cancer on 20 January 1805 at Broadlands. She was buried alongside him in a vault in Romsey Abbey, where there is a monument to them by Flaxman. Their eldest son was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27112/', "Henry John Temple, third Viscount Palmerston (1784&#150;1865)")</script>, the prime minister.<br>
