<span class="headword">Aitken,  (Adam) Jack</span>  (1921&#150;1998), <span class="occ">lexicographer and philologist</span>, was born on 19 June 1921 in Edinburgh, the only son and eldest of the three children of Adam Aitken (1896&#150;1958), miner, and his first wife, Alexandrina Sutherland (1896&#150;1931). He was baptized into the Church of Scotland at Bonnyrigg at the age of six, but as an adult was agnostic. He was educated at Lasswade secondary school, Midlothian. With the support of the school and his minister, the Revd Oliver Dryer, he left home at the age of sixteen together with his younger sister Hope. He was able to continue his education thanks to a school bursary, and as the son of a miner he was able to obtain further bursaries that allowed him to enter the University of Edinburgh in 1939. His higher education was interrupted by the Second World War. Although philosophically a pacifist he served from 1941 to 1945 in the Royal Artillery and took part in the Normandy landings and in the war in north Africa, rising to the rank of sergeant-major. He was commended for bravery by Field Marshal Montgomery in 1944.<br>
<br>Aitken graduated MA with first-class honours in English language and literature from Edinburgh in 1947. In 1948 he was appointed assistant to the editor of <span class="italic">A Dictionary of the Older Scottish Tongue</span> (<span class="italic">DOST</span>), Sir William Craigie; assistant lecturer in English language at the University of Edinburgh; and research fellow at the universities of Edinburgh, Glasgow, and Aberdeen. On 19 June 1952 he married Norma Ward (later known as Chandra) Manson (<i>b</i>. 1927), a teacher for the National Childbirth Trust, with whom he had three sons and a daughter.<br>
<br>From 1954 to 1964 Aitken was lecturer at Edinburgh and Glasgow; he was promoted to senior lecturer at Edinburgh in 1965, and reader in 1975. From 1971 these positions were part-time, and from 1979 he devoted himself full-time to <span class="italic">DOST</span>, of which he was editor from 1956 until his retirement in 1986. In 1981 the British Academy awarded him the biennial Sir Israel Gollancz prize. In 1983 he was awarded a DLitt by the University of Edinburgh, and he was appointed honorary professor in 1984. In 1987 he was presented with a Festschrift: <span class="italic">The Nuttis Schell: Essays on the Scots Language Presented to A. J. Aitken</span>, edited by Caroline Macafee and Iseabail Macleod.<br>
<br>A. J. Aitken's major achievements were his work on <span class="italic">DOST</span>, which became a much more inclusive and more sophisticated work under his direction (vol. 3 onwards) than it had previously been, and his other publications on the Scots language. He also effectively established Scots as a university teaching subject. He was an early adopter of computer-assisted methods in the arts: with others he created the <span class="roman">Older Scottish Textual Archive</span> of over 1 million words of running text. He published numerous articles and edited collections of papers on Older and Modern Scots and on lexicography. He was editorial consultant and pronunciation editor of the definitive one-volume dictionary of Scots, <span class="italic">The Concise Scots Dictionary</span> (1985). Revised versions of three of his most important contributions, on Older Scots orthography, phonology, and stylistics, are included in the preface to volume 12 of <span class="italic">DOST</span>, and his posthumous monograph <span class="italic">The Older Scots Vowels</span> was prepared for publication by the Scottish Text Society. A cassette tape <span class="italic">How to Pronounce Older Scots</span>, with accompanying booklet, was published by Scotsoun in 1996. His name is attached to a sound law, Aitken's law, which he himself called the &#145;Scottish vowel-length rule&#146;.<br>
<br>Aitken was active in the institutions of his disciplines. He chaired the language committee of the Association for Scottish Literary Studies from 1971 to 1976. Of the Forum for Research on the Languages of Scotland he was chairman from 1978 to 1981, and honorary president from 1994 to 1997. He was also vice-president of the Scottish Text Society from 1985, honorary preses of the Scots Language Society from 1994, honorary vice-president of the Scottish National Dictionary Association from 1995, and honorary vice-president of the Robert Henryson Society from 1996. His influence was international: he served variously as adviser and consultant on several major dictionary projects, including the <span class="italic">Dictionary of Sanskrit on Historical Principles</span>, the <span class="italic">Dictionary of Middle English</span>, the <span class="italic">Dictionary of Early Modern English Pronunciation</span>, and the <span class="italic">Dictionary of Old English</span>. He was looked to as the leading expert on Scots, and gave generously of his time in talks to the public and expert advice to colleagues all over the world. Aitken was known as a man of great personal integrity as well as scholarly dedication. For a period after the war and up to 1956, he was a member of the Communist Party. He was also a member of the ex-services branch of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament.<br>
<br>Apart from brief stays in Iceland in 1951 and India in the late 1960s, Jack Aitken lived in Edinburgh all his adult life. He died of ischaemia at his home, 5 Bellevue Crescent, on 11 February 1998, having had a heart by-pass operation twenty years previously, and was cremated at Warriston crematorium, Edinburgh, on 18 February 1998. His wife survived him.<br>
