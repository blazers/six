<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Prout,  Ebenezer</span>  (1835&#150;1909), <span class="occ">music theorist and journal editor</span>, was born on 1 March 1835 at Oundle, Northamptonshire, the son of the Revd Ebenezer Prout, a Congregational minister, from a Devon family, and nephew of the water-colour painter Samuel Prout. He was taught music by his father, and was educated at Denmark Hill grammar school, London (1848&#150;51). He was a lay student at New College, St John's Wood, for a year, and in 1852 he became an usher at Priory House School, Clapton. He graduated BA from London University in 1854. After teaching at Joseph Payne's School, Leatherhead, Surrey, from 1856 to 1859, he decided to enter the music profession, despite strong opposition from his father. Although Prout received some piano lessons from Charles Kensington Salaman, he was almost entirely self-taught. He began by teaching singing at a girls' school in Hackney, and from 1860 to 1884 he was a professor of piano at the Crystal Palace School of Art. He was organist at Union Chapel, Islington, from 1861 to 1873. In 1862 he won the first prize in a competition for a new string quartet, instituted by the Society of British Musicians, and in 1865 their prize for a piano quartet.<br>
<br>In 1871 Prout was appointed the first editor of the <span class="italic">Monthly Musical Record</span>. He at once introduced a new element into music criticism, which he made the prominent feature of his journal. He wrote detailed analyses of the less known works of Schubert, of Schumann's symphonies, and of some of the later works of Wagner, all of which were practically unknown in England, and led the way for the introduction of Wagner's operas. In 1875 he was forced to resign the editorship, and after a period as music critic of <span class="italic">The Academy</span> he wrote for <span class="italic">The Athenaeum</span> from 1879 to 1889.<br>
<br>Prout continued to compose, and in 1871 produced an organ concerto in E minor which was performed by John Stainer at a Crystal Palace concert. This was followed by a duet sonata in A major for piano and harmonium, which became very popular. He wrote several cantatas, including <span class="italic">Hereward</span> (1878), <span class="italic">Alfred</span> (1882), <span class="italic">Queen Aim&eacute;e</span> (for female voices, 1885), and <span class="italic">Damon and Phintias</span> (for male voices, 1889), as well as three symphonies, overtures, chamber music, and sonatas. He also published many arrangements of classical pieces for the organ.<br>
<br>In 1877 Prout contributed a valuable text on instrumentation to Novello's series of music primers. He began a series of treatises in 1889 with <span class="italic">Harmony, its Theory and Practice</span>, which reached a twenty-fourth edition. <span class="italic">Counterpoint, Strict and Free</span> (1890; 9th edn, 1910), <span class="italic">Fugue</span> (1891), and <span class="italic">The Orchestra</span> (1897) were among many of his works which became standard textbooks.<br>
<br>From 1876 to 1890 Prout was conductor of the Borough of Hackney Choral Association. At the establishment of the National Training School for Music in 1876 he became professor of harmony, a post he held until 1882, and from 1879 until his death he taught at the Royal Academy of Music, where his pupils included Henry Wood and Edward German. He also became professor at the Guildhall School of Music in 1884. The reputation of his textbooks secured him in 1894 the professorship of music at Trinity College, Dublin, a non-resident post, in succession to Sir Robert Prescott Stewart, and he was awarded the honorary degree of MusD in 1895.<br>
<br>Prout was a leading Handel scholar, and he wrote additional accompaniments for a performance of <span class="italic">Samson</span> at the Leeds festival in 1880. In 1891 he carried on a long controversy in print over Franz's edition of <span class="italic">Messiah</span>, and in 1902 brought out his own edition of the work, still often used by choirs, eliminating textual errors and adding accompaniments. In his later years he concentrated mainly on Bach. Large selections of airs from Handel's operas and Bach's cantatas, translated and edited by him, appeared between 1905 and 1909. He invented words for all the fugue subjects of Bach's &#145;48&#146; to help students to see where the fugue subject ends, and these mottoes were widely circulated.<br>
<br>Prout married Julia West, the daughter of a nonconformist minister. They had one son, Louis Beethoven Prout, and three daughters. He lived at 246 Richmond Road, Hackney, always spending the summer vacation at Vik, Norway. He died suddenly at home, on 5 December 1909, and was buried at Abney Park cemetery.<br>
