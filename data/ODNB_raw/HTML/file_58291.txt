<span class="headword">Thomas,  David</span>  (1880&#150;1967), <span class="occ">educationist and socialist</span>, was born on 16 July 1880 at Quarry Cottage, Llanfechain, Montgomeryshire, the son of David Thomas, a mason and farmer, and his wife, Elizabeth Jones. He was educated locally and briefly attended Oswestry grammar school before finding work in a draper's shop. In 1895 he became a pupil teacher in the British School in Llanfyllin. He subsequently worked as a teacher in Anglesey, Glamorgan, and London before moving to the slate district of Caernarvonshire in north-west Wales in 1905, becoming a schoolmaster in Tal-y-sarn in the Nantlle valley in 1909. It was during this period that he established himself as a leading Welsh socialist propagandist. Brought up a Wesleyan, his political principles led him to break with all Christian denominations for a period, although he subsequently returned to the nonconformist fold. His political message and the language he used to express it were both characterized by a strong moral sense informed by the influence of Christian belief.<br>
<br>Thomas joined the Fabian Society and the Independent Labour Party (ILP) in 1907, and in 1908 he was embroiled in a debate on socialism in the columns of a local newspaper, <span class="italic">Yr Herald Gymraeg</span>. This led him to write his major work, <span class="italic">Y werin a'i theyrnas</span> (&#145;The people and their kingdom&#146;), which was completed in 1909 and published in 1910. This 248-page volume can be considered the most thorough and eloquent exposition of the socialist analysis of society and the socialist programme for change to be published in Welsh.<br>
<br>By 1911 Thomas was arguing both within the ILP and within the Welsh labour movement more widely that socialists should identify themselves more clearly with Welsh culture and Welsh issues and history. This, he argued, was the only way in which socialism would become acceptable to Welsh-speakers (in 1901 49.8 per cent of the population of Wales spoke Welsh and 15 per cent spoke only Welsh), many of whom were steeped in the values of nonconformity and Liberalism. During 1911 and 1912 he strove to establish a Welsh region of the ILP and for the publication of more socialist material in Welsh. He organized a meeting at the 1911 national eisteddfod of Wales in support of these aims which, although he later denied the allegation, was widely interpreted as an attempt to construct a Welsh labour party. Socialism was often portrayed as being an alien, English intrusion into Wales during this period and his efforts were crucially important in countering these accusations.<br>
<br>In north Wales, Thomas rapidly established himself as the leading socialist activist, establishing branches of the ILP and encouraging trade unionism among quarry workers and agricultural labourers. In 1912 he was instrumental in establishing the Caernarvonshire Labour Council and in 1914 the North Wales Council of Labour, of which he was secretary in 1920&#150;22. During this period he was undoubtedly the most influential socialist working in the Welsh language, and he made an impressive attempt to marry the Welsh radical and nonconformist tradition to socialism and the Labour Party. In his stance as a conscientious objector during the First World War he brought the radical elements of both traditions together in his pacifist arguments. He was sent to work on a farm in Bersham near Wrexham for his opposition to the war. His attempts to fuse socialism with Welsh radical nonconformity have led one historian to conclude that he &#145;came closest during these years to achieving the required synthesis between Socialism and the Welsh spirit&#146;  (Pope, 24).<br>
<br>After the war Thomas married Elizabeth Ann Williams (1881/2&#150;1955) on 26 July 1919, with whom he had two children. He remained a Labour activist, but from 1922 an educational rather than an agitational emphasis can be discerned in his career. He became a teacher at Bangor in 1922, where he remained until 1945. He completed a University of Liverpool MA course in 1928, a study of the maritime and agricultural history of north Wales in the nineteenth century, and became increasingly active in the Workers' Educational Association (WEA) and adult education provision. In 1944 he established <span class="italic">Lleufer</span> as a journal for the WEA in Wales and he remained as editor until 1965. He published a large number of books in Welsh including a biography (1956) of the influential socialist, poet, and educationist the Revd Silyn Roberts, with whom he had worked closely. He also wrote an autobiography, <span class="italic">Diolch am gael byw</span> (&#145;Thanks for having lived&#146;), which was published posthumously. He was awarded an honorary MA of the University of Wales in 1960. Thomas died at 2 Pen-y-bryn, Burry Port, Carmarthenshire, his daughter's home, on 27 June 1967, and was cremated three days later at Morriston crematorium, Glamorgan.<br>
