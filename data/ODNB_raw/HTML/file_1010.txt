<span class="headword">Bacon,  John</span>  (1777&#150;1859), <span class="occ">sculptor</span>, was born on 13 March 1777 in his parents' house in Newman Street, London, the second son of the sculptor <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/994/', "John Bacon (1740&#150;1799)")</script> and his wife, Elizabeth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Wade (<i>d</i>. 1783). His elder brother, <a name="cosubject_1010"></a><span class="headword">Thomas Bacon</span>  (<em>b. </em>1773, <em>d.</em> after 1800), was also a sculptor who entered the Royal Academy Schools in 1788 and exhibited some religious works at the Royal Academy between 1793 and 1795. Until the age of twelve the younger John Bacon was under casual apprenticeship in his father's studio, and this enabled him to enter the Royal Academy Schools on 29 March 1790. He exhibited his first work in 1792, a statue entitled <span class="italic">Moses Striking the Rock</span>. From then on, his progress through the ranks was steady: he gained a silver medal in 1793 and a gold medal the following year for his study of the Greek prophet Cassandra. He continued to exhibit work at the Royal Academy until 1824, and he also exhibited at the British Institution in 1806 and 1807.<br>
<br>After his father's death the younger Bacon succeeded to his business and finished many of the works left in progress, including the popular statue of Lord Cornwallis, which led him to secure many important civic and imperial commissions. He was assisted in this by his brother Thomas, but soon after 1800 all trace of Thomas is lost. (The statue of William III in St James's Square, London, erected in 1808, was begun by the elder John Bacon and completed by Thomas.) The younger John Bacon's work, in a neo-classical style, was in such great demand by 1803 that he was encouraged to organize a public exhibition of his works, a largely unprecedented step at the time. He continued to receive numerous commissions: in 1806 his model of William Pitt the younger was unveiled in Cambridge; and 1809 was his <i>annus mirabilis</i>, during which he made statues of the Marquess Cornwallis for Calcutta, the Marquess Wellesley for Bombay, and George III for the Bank of Ireland. His statue in honour of Lord Lavington was unveiled in Antigua and featured a personified image of the island paying tribute to its imperial governor. Sadly, the statue did not fare well in its final colonial context&#151;it was later destroyed by a hurricane. By 1814 the prestige of Bacon's work was so great that he was asked to restore the famous images <span class="italic">Madness</span> and <span class="italic">Melancholy</span> by the seventeenth-century sculptor Caius Gabriel Cibber, located at the Bethlem Hospital in London. His other works include portraits of various eminent late eighteenth- and early nineteenth-century dignitaries, including the bishop of Rochester, the archbishop of York, Richard Payne Knight (the art critic and theorist of the picturesque), captains Harvey, Hutt, and Cooke, and Admiral Totty.<br>
<br>In 1808 Bacon largely retired from public life, choosing to focus his attentions instead on ecclesiastic and architectural sculpture and monumental masonry. To this end, he formed a highly prolific partnership with Charles Manning (1776&#150;1812), to whom he entrusted the design and execution of the majority of commissions while retaining the family name on the work. Manning's brother Samuel (1788&#150;1842) succeeded him in the business, continuing its extensive production of monuments with Bacon as a sleeping partner until 1843. Bacon's work was treated with increasing disrespect in high aesthetic circles, since contemporaries felt that his later architectural masonry was mostly repetitive and dull, and he was blamed by later Victorian critics for the aesthetic and imaginative decline of mid-nineteenth-century British sculpture. Although his name was put forward, he did not receive sufficient votes to be elected ARA. Even though this has been attributed to his unusual business practices, it should also be noted that, in his diary, Joseph Farington recorded John Flaxman's views on &#145;the flimsiness of Bacon&#146;:<blockquote>Bacon he considered as scarcely to be taken up with a view of comparing his works with the pure standards of Sculpture. He had not made such his models, but worked <i>from notions of his own</i>, often showing much ingenuity, but void of greatness and simplicity. (Farington, <span class="italic">Diary</span>, 7, 2511)</blockquote>More recently, however, Bacon's reputation has been reassessed more generously in the light of his earlier work, which has been, according to M. H. Grant, &#145;too little recorded or regarded&#146;  (<span class="italic">Dictionary of British Sculptors from the XIIIth Century to the XXth Century</span>, 25).<br>
<br>Bacon died at his home, 35 Bathwick Hill, Bath, Somerset, on 14 July 1859, leaving his two sons, John Bacon and Thomas Bacon, who were both clergymen, as executors of his ample estate. A comprehensive list of his works is included in <span class="italic">Allgemeines K&uuml;nstler-lexikon: die bildenden K&uuml;nstler aller Zeiten und V&ouml;lker</span>.<br>
