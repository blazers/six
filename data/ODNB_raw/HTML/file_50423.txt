<span class="headword">Beckford,  Peter</span>  (1672/3&#150;1735), <span class="occ">planter and politician in Jamaica</span>, was the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/50424/', "Peter Beckford (bap. 1643, d. 1710)")</script> and his second wife, Anne Ballard. Beckford was elected to the assembly (like his father, who was a member of the house of assembly before he was elevated to Jamaica's privy council and appointed lieutenant-governor) in most of the years from 1701 to 1731, and was speaker from 1707 to 1713 and again in 1716. He was also comptroller of the customs in Jamaica. Like his father, young Beckford possessed a violent temper, and, according to Boyd Alexander, he &#145;shamefully murdered the Deputy Judge-Advocate in Jamaica who was more than twice his age&#146;  (Alexander, 31).<br>
<br>Few details are known of Beckford's career, but at his death he was the wealthiest planter in Jamaica and reputedly &#145;in possession of the largest property real and personal of any subject in Europe&#146;  (Leslie, 267). His great wealth is revealed, in part, by the inventories of his personal property. They show that Beckford was sole owner of nine sugar plantations and part owner of seven more, of which his personal property equity amounted to &pound;69,486 Jamaica currency. Nine cattle pens, together with a provision farm and storehouse, amounted to another &pound;13,098. In Spanish Town, the seat of government, his personal property was valued at &pound;5686. Much of his personal property took the form of black slaves, of whom he was sole owner of 1737 and half owner of 577 others.<br>
<br>Moreover, Peter Beckford was a financier of great magnitude, for his inventories list 128 individuals and firms that owed him a total of &pound;135,044 on the security of mortgages, bonds, and open accounts. Altogether, Beckford's personal property amounted to &pound;223,314. But this does not include the value of buildings and planted canes, which probably amounted to another &pound;100,000 or more. Thus Beckford's personalty and realty amounted to nearly &pound;325,000 Jamaica currency or &pound;222,000 sterling. Another &pound;20,000 sterling was said to consist of personal property in England, &#145;besides diverse large Quantities of Sugar and other Merchandise&#146;  (Pares, 25) consigned to Thomas Beckford, his cousin and London commission agent. Historian Richard Pares has estimated that Beckford's &#145;whole fortune must have amounted to &pound;300,000 or so&#146;  (ibid., 70).<br>
<br>Peter Beckford married Bathshua Hering; they had nine children: six sons, Peter, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1903/', "William Beckford (bap. 1709, d. 1770)")</script>, Richard, Nathaniel, Julines, and Francis, and three daughters, Ellis, Bathshua, and Elizabeth (1725&#150;1791). By his will proved on 6 October 1735 Beckford gave and bequeathed to his wife &pound;1000 sterling per annum and her choice of Dirty Pitt Pen or Dry Sugar Works. To his eldest son Peter he added to what he had already given him all of his property in Great Britain. He gave and bequeathed to his &#145;five sons now in England, vizt. William, Richard, Nathaniel, Julines &amp; Francis all my Estates in Jamaica both real &amp; personal to hold to them their Heirs &amp; Assigns for ever&#146;  (will). He gave and bequeathed to his daughter Ellis &pound;2000 Jamaica money and &pound;500 to each of her two children. To his two youngest daughters, Bathshua and Elizabeth, he bequeathed &pound;5000 Jamaica money. Elizabeth Beckford later married Thomas Howard, second earl of Effingham, and was the mother of Thomas Howard, third earl, who was governor of Jamaica in 1791 before his untimely death. Furthermore, Speaker Beckford gave and bequeathed to the poor of Jamaica &pound;2000 Jamaica money, of which &pound;1000 was to be given to the poor of St Catherine, and the other thousand to be applied towards the building of a free school or hospital for the poor. Other clauses in his will provided an annual salary for his white bookkeeper, and instructions to set free his &#145;Negro man Slave Named Diego&#146;  (ibid.) and allow him &pound;10 per annum and the use of 10 acres of land.<br>
<br>Peter Beckford died, aged sixty-two, in Spanish Town, Jamaica, on 3 April 1735. He was succeeded in the bulk of his estate by his eldest son, Peter, but the latter's premature death in 1737 meant that most of the Beckford lands passed to his second son, Alderman William Beckford. In 1754 William possessed 22,021 acres of land, whereas Richard had 9241, Julines 8197 and Francis 2616. Beckford's greatest legacy was that he had accumulated an estate great enough to support his sons in their British ambitions; three, William, Richard, and Julines, became members of parliament.<br>
