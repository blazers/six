<span class="headword">Johnstone,  William</span>  (1897&#150;1981), <span class="occ">painter and art educationist</span>, was born on 8 June 1897 at his parents' house above their butcher's shop in Main Street, Denholm, Roxburghshire, the only son and youngest of the three children of William Johnstone (1855&#150;1938), farmer and butcher, and his wife, Jane Maria Greenwood (1853&#150;1942), daughter of Robert Greenwood, textile designer and founder of the Art Gallery, Hawick, Roxburghshire. His father moved to Greenhead Farm, Selkirk, in 1902 and until Johnstone entered Selkirk high school in 1911, farm work took priority over his schooling. At school, authoritarian teaching methods proved beyond his endurance and he left to farm full-time. He had been painting since 1907 and some oils survive of only a slightly later date  (priv. coll.). The guiding principles of Johnstone's life were established early: from his mother's family he learned respect for the vocation of the artist; at school he acquired a contempt for conventional educational methods; and through his father he developed a regard for the independence of the self-employed man, epitomized by the farmer, and also a love for farming technology and the land.<br>
<br>Saved from the First World War until its last months by his work on the family farm, Johnstone was conscripted in the spring of 1918 only to be posted back to the farm on 11 November. By the time of his discharge in 1919 he had decided on an artistic career and entered Edinburgh College of Art with an ex-service grant in October of that year. A successful, if somewhat difficult, student, he was refused the college travelling scholarship when he graduated in 1923, despite a recommendation from George Clausen. Awarded the Stuart prize, MacLaine Walters medal, and Keith award by the Royal Scottish Academy in 1924, its award of the Carnegie travelling scholarship in 1925 enabled him to settle that autumn in Paris. There he studied under Andr&eacute; Lhote and came under the freer influence of the surrealist movement. During 1926 he spent a month in Madrid in the Museo del Prado, where the paintings of El Greco had a major impact on his work and were the source of inspiration for his major surrealist painting <span class="italic">A Point in Time</span> (1929, Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art, Edinburgh). Along with other works of this period, the painting is composed of complex patterns of organic forms and spatial voids, often with an implicit sexual content. In February 1927 in Paris he married a talented American sculpture student, Flora Macdonald (1903&#150;1976). She was at the time studying with &Eacute;mile-Antoine Bourdelle but later abandoned art. Johnstone and his wife returned to Scotland but left in August 1928 for California, where they briefly established an art school. A year later they returned to Scotland.<br>
<br>In March 1931 Johnstone settled in London, where he worked as a secondary school teacher and began to formulate educational theories regarding the importance of children's art for the adult artist, and the connections between art, design, and technology. His theories rest on belief in the creativity of all children and in automatic drawing, as developed by the surrealists Andr&eacute; Masson and Joan Mir&oacute;. He encouraged children to make random marks which were then refined by a process of tracing selected elements into what he termed &#145;developments&#146;, ultimately becoming finished drawings, elaborate figural compositions, or even portraits. Many others had expressed faith in the creative abilities of children but few had demonstrated how a teacher might encourage the development of a child's early efforts. The results were published in his book <span class="italic">Child Art to Man Art</span> (1941), which was later translated into Japanese. Johnstone differed from other educationists in his conviction that children's artistic efforts should be developed, with a teacher's involvement, into adult art and should not be shielded from adult influence. He used this method with older students, working with three-dimensional objects, and further encouraged them to be creative in all areas of art and design.<br>
<br>In the early 1930s Johnstone's painting was influenced by the vorticists, as in, for example, the portraits of his friends the poet Christopher Murray Grieve (Hugh MacDiarmid) and the musician Francis George Scott (both Scottish National Portrait Gallery, Edinburgh). He had known them since 1921&#150;2 and shared their desire to stimulate a &#145;Scottish Renaissance&#146;. Johnstone destroyed or reworked many of his paintings but a surviving landscape of the mid-1930s shows a reinvigoration of this traditional genre in a modern idiom. While <span class="italic">The Eildon Hills</span>  (reproduced in <span class="italic">Paintings, Drawings and Sculpture</span>, sale catalogue, lot 1) also reveals his knowledge of European Romanticism, the thinly applied washes of oil allowed to flow down the canvas in an uninhibited, almost random manner are clearly from the hand of a twentieth-century painter.<br>
<br>Following his post as head of Hackney School of Art in 1936, in 1938 Johnstone was made principal of Camberwell School of Arts and Crafts and there he employed professional artists to teach part-time, insisting on them working in disciplines far beyond their normal areas of practice. In 1940 his wife and daughter Elizabeth Jane (<i>b</i>. 1931) were evacuated to the United States; the marriage ended and Johnstone's physical and mental health suffered. At this time his painting recapitulated his earlier styles, making the dating of these works difficult. He set up home with a former student, Mary Joan Bonning (1918&#150;1988), an embroiderer whom he married in 1947 and with whom he had a daughter, Sarah. That year Johnstone was made principal of the Central School of Arts and Crafts in London, where he employed many successful artists including Patrick Heron, Eduardo Paolozzi, and Victor Pasmore. Of his students, Terence Conran made a distinctive impact on the design of British household goods in the latter part of the twentieth century. Johnstone made several teaching and study trips to the United States during 1948&#150;50 and was made an OBE in 1954. This period of success was also a time of conflict with his staff, whom he ruled autocratically. In the 1950s he painted a number of large canvases whose colouristic complexity and bold, almost violent handling vividly express his thrusting, self-confident personality and have something in common with the abstract expressionist painters of New York.<br>
<br>Suffering from exhaustion Johnstone retired to farm in the Scottish borders in 1960, but gradually he returned to painting. In 1970 he retired from farming and settled at Crailing, near Jedburgh, where an extraordinary late flowering of his art took place and where he received the enlightened patronage of a wealthy widow, Hope Montagu Douglas Scott. In the last decade of his life he worked with great ease and on a large scale. His numerous large abstract drawings in black ink of this period were executed with extraordinary technical delicacy. Together with the series of plaster reliefs he made with his assistant, George Turnbull, a local plasterer, the drawings illustrate his long-standing interest in chance, the immediacy of the creative gesture, and a concern with placing a time-limit on the creative act which had first influenced him during his days in Paris. His assistant placed wet plaster on a board and in the few minutes before solidification, Johnstone, armed with a trowel in each hand, manipulated the plaster in much the same way as he plied his ink-loaded brush when making the large drawings. A series of these reliefs was exhibited at the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art in Edinburgh in 1973. Two films were made of his life and art and Edinburgh University awarded him an honorary doctorate in 1980.<br>
<br>William Johnstone died at the Cottage Hospital, Hawick, Roxburghshire, on 5 December 1981, aged eighty-four, and was buried in the cemetery in nearby Denholm. He was survived by his second wife. Johnstone is considered by many to be one of the finest Scottish painters of the twentieth century. In addition to the National Galleries of Scotland his works are in the Tate collection; the National Portrait Gallery, London; the University of Edinburgh; the Glasgow Art Gallery and Museum, and the Hunterian Art Gallery, Glasgow; Nuffield College, Oxford; the Art Gallery of Ontario, Toronto; and Colorado Springs Fine Art Center, Colorado, USA.<br>
