<span class="headword">Lovell, Sir  Lovell Benjamin Badcock</span>  (1786&#150;1861), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, a descendant of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17064/', "Sir Salathiel Lovell")</script>, was the eldest son of Stanhope Badcock of Little Missenden Hall and Maplethorpe Hall, Buckinghamshire, who served in the American War of Independence as a subaltern in the 6th regiment, and with the Royal Buckinghamshire militia in Ireland in the 1798 rebellion. His mother was the daughter of William Buckle of Mythe Hall and Chasely, Gloucestershire. Educated at Eton College, he was appointed cornet on 18 December 1805 in the 4th light dragoons, in which he became lieutenant on 19 May 1808 and captain on 12 December 1811. He served in the expedition to Montevideo in 1807, on the staff of Sir Samuel Auchmuty. After landing with his regiment in Portugal in December 1808, he served with it throughout the Peninsular campaign of 1809&#150;14, much of the time with the light division. He was present in all at ten general actions, seven sieges, and forty other engagements. In 1811 he was much employed on the left of the army as an unofficial intelligence officer, and was strongly recommended by Wellington for promotion. After the war Badcock was given a brevet majority (21 January 1819) for his Peninsular services.<br>
<br>On 28 October 1824 Badcock was brought into the 8th light dragoons, after the return of that regiment from India, and on 21 November 1826 obtained a lieutenant-colonelcy, half pay unattached. He was one of the military reporters under Lord William Russell at the siege of Porto during the Miguelite War in Portugal. He published <span class="italic">Rough Leaves from a Journal in Spain and Portugal in 1832, '33, and '34</span> (1835). On 21 March 1834 he exchanged to the command of the 15th light dragoons (later hussars) with Lord Brudenell, later earl of Cardigan. In 1835 he was made KH. In 1839 he took his regiment out to Madras. In 1840, together with his brother, Captain William Stanhope Badcock KH, Royal Navy, he assumed the surname of Lovell under royal sign manual. He became brevet colonel on 23 November 1841. On 8 March 1850 he exchanged from the 15th hussars to half pay with the 11th hussars. He became major-general on 20 June 1854, and in 1856 was made KCB and appointed colonel of the 12th (Prince of Wales's) Royal lancers. He died at his residence, Brunswick Terrace, Brighton, on 11 March 1861, aged seventy-five.<br>
