<span class="headword">Milner <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Compton]</span>,  Mary</span>  (1797&#150;1863), <span class="occ">author</span>, was born on 12 November 1797, the daughter of Thomas Wilberforce Compton and his wife, Sarah. Her birth coincided with the death of her great-uncle <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18792/', "Joseph Milner")</script>, vicar-elect of Kingston upon Hull, with whom her mother, his niece and legatee, was living. After the death of her mother in August 1812, Mary Compton found a permanent home with her great-uncle <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18788/', "Isaac Milner")</script>, president of Queens' College, Cambridge, and dean of Carlisle. Her education gained greatly from her conversations with him on religion, mathematics, natural science, and history. Shortly before the death of Dean Milner, Mary Compton married a distant cousin, Joseph Milner (1797?&#150;1864), in 1820. He became vicar of St Lawrence, Appleby, near Penrith, in Westmorland, and they had at least six children, three sons and three daughters.<br>
<br>By 1840 Mary Milner had returned from domestic to literary pursuits with <span class="italic">The Christian Mother, or, Maternal Duties Exemplified</span>, a popular work of evangelical piety which stressed the value of the individual child in the sight of God. Some were shocked that she advocated a permissive attitude to mischievous children, although she emphasized that defects of character were to be punished. At the same time she was also at work on <span class="italic">The Life of Dean Milner, DD, FRS</span> (2 vols., 1842). This demonstrated an incisive style, attacking those &#145;who secretly if not avowedly, associate the ideas of piety and imbecility&#146;  (&#145;Preface&#146;, iv). Aiming at impartiality towards the subject, she handled historical evidence ably and generally avoided personal reminiscence in an impressive biography. Dean Milner's influence can be seen in <span class="italic">The Garland of the Months</span> (1852), in which natural history and sciences were used to exemplify &#145;the first great cause of all things&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Garland of the Months</span>, 240), as a stimulus to observations by the growing child. In her <span class="italic">Sketches Illustrative of Important Periods in the History of the World</span> (1843) Mary Milner showed a grasp of historical change from an evangelical point of view; she was asked to continue Sarah Trimmer's popular textbook <span class="italic">History of England</span> to the marriage of Queen Victoria (1849).<br>
<br>As an editor, Mrs Milner was probably able to count for support on William Wilberforce and Clapham Sect contacts among publishers in London and elsewhere. Her lively intellect can be seen in the <span class="italic">Christian Mother's Magazine</span> (1844). Apart from articles on religion and the truth of scripture, this periodical contained series on astronomy, mathematics, history, archaeology, and natural history, as well as poetry and other arts which reflected Mary Milner's broad interests. It soon became the <span class="italic">Englishwomen's Magazine</span> (9 vols., 1845&#150;55), in which Thomas Arnold's call for articles &#145;written with a decidedly religious tone&#146;  (1846, frontispiece) was answered. There was a feminist edge to the contents, which included a series on celebrated women such as Hannah More, Felicia Hemans, and Maria Edgeworth, and female influence on literature and society. Reviews kept readers in touch with the latest ideas and covered such social issues as the poor laws, infanticide in India and the potato famine in Ireland. As the editor of a popular periodical series of engravings, <span class="italic">The People's Gallery</span> (1848&#150;9), Mrs Milner encountered redoubtable women contributors such as Caroline Norton. In 1855&#150;6 she returned to &#145;scriptural christianity&#146; with the <span class="italic">Christian Lady's Magazine</span>. Series on the human body and the training and development of children were short-lived, possibly owing to religious opposition. She also edited a new edition of <span class="italic">The Essentials of Christianity</span> (1855), by her great-uncle Joseph Milner.<br>
<br>Mary Milner died at the vicarage, Appleby, on 10 May 1863, and was buried in St Lawrence's churchyard there. As a scholar, she demonstrated the versatility of the mid-nineteenth-century woman writer, and her editorial skill gave women a voice in Christian and wider circles.<br>
