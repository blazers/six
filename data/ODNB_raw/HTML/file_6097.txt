</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Conolly,  William</span>  (1662&#150;1729), <span class="occ">speaker of the Irish House of Commons</span>, was born in Ballyshannon, co. Donegal, Ireland, the eldest of the three children of Patrick Conolly and his wife, Jane, and brother of Patrick and Jane. Tradition has it that Conolly's father was either a publican or a blacksmith. This is unlikely, however, since William and his father are named on the list of Irish protestants whose land was declared forfeit by the Jacobite parliament of 1689. It is more likely that the Conollys were a minor Catholic gentry family who converted to Anglicanism some time before 1660. William Conolly studied law in Dublin, qualified as an attorney, was attached to the court of common pleas in 1685, and was land agent to Captain James Hamilton between 1692 and 1700. He was elected to the Irish House of Commons as MP for Donegal borough (1692&#150;3 and 1695&#150;9). In 1694 he married Katherine Conyngham, daughter of Sir Albert Conyngham and sister of Henry Conyngham of Mount Charles, co. Donegal. This marriage connected Conolly to the most important families in west Ulster. William and Katherine were childless but he was said to have had an illegitimate son who died in 1727, aged eight  (TNA: PRO, C 110/46/528).<br>
<br>Conolly's career was founded upon successful land speculation. He used Katherine's dowry of &pound;2300 to buy his first estates in co. Meath, and made his fortune during the 1690s by buying and acting as agent for the sale of forfeited Jacobite estates. The acquisition of an estate in Limavady gave him a valuable electoral interest in co. Londonderry, where he was collector of the revenue (1697&#150;1729) and sat as MP from 1703 until his death. He rose to national prominence during the party conflict of the early 1700s, when he emerged as a leading figure in the Irish whig party. The whig lord lieutenant, Thomas, earl of Wharton, appointed him a revenue commissioner and an Irish privy councillor in 1709. In 1710, however, he was dismissed by the tory duke of Ormond, and, he was removed from the privy council the following year.<br>
<br>Following the return to power of the whigs in 1714 Conolly was restored to the privy council and revenue board and was persuaded to stand as the government's candidate for speaker of the Irish House of Commons. He was elected unanimously on 12 November 1715 and quickly became a leading figure in the management of the Commons. He formed close relationships with the duke of Grafton, lord justice in 1715&#150;16, and chief secretaries, Charles Delafaye and Martin Bladen. His hitherto friendly relationship with the lord chancellor, Lord Brodrick, first Viscount Midleton, however, rapidly deteriorated. Previously regarded as leader of the Irish whig party, Brodrick resented Conolly's emergence as chief manager or &#145;undertaker&#146; of the government's parliamentary business. Brodrick's fortunes temporarily recovered with the appointment of his ally, the duke of Bolton, as viceroy in 1717. Conolly, however, continued to support the court in parliament and was appointed as a lord justice when Bolton left for England. A dispute between Brodrick and the ministry over Sunderland's <span class="roman">Peerage Bill</span> allowed Conolly to resume his position as chief undertaker when Bolton returned to Ireland in 1719. The speaker's position was strengthened with the appointment of the duke of Grafton as viceroy in 1720. Conolly's influence was so great during Grafton's viceroyalty that he was described as &#145;Prime Minister&#146;  (Wake MSS, 14, fol. 48). However, this viceroyalty witnessed the greatest crisis in Anglo-Irish relations in the first half of the eighteenth century when opposition to &#145;Wood's halfpence&#146; made the normal means of managing the Irish parliament impracticable. The intensity of popular opposition to the copper halfpence forced the normally loyal Conolly to desert the government in order to retain his political credibility in Ireland.<br>
<br>The replacement of Grafton by John, second Baron Carteret, in 1724 seriously threatened Conolly's position as chief undertaker. An ally of the Brodricks, Carteret was unlikely to place much faith in the speaker's loyalty and his investigations into the government's accounts provoked rumours that Conolly would soon be dismissed. For a year after his arrival in Ireland, Carteret remained aloof from both Conolly and Brodrick, and he provoked the latter's resignation as lord chancellor in April 1725. However, after having lost control of the House of Commons soon after the start of the parliamentary session of 1725 Carteret turned to Conolly to be his parliamentary manager. With Brodrick's resignation Conolly's position was stronger than ever and his dominant position in parliament was secure until his death. Re-elected as speaker in the first session of George II's parliament, he served until he collapsed in the Commons on 26 September 1729; he resigned as speaker on 13 October. A contemporary wrote on 25 October that Conolly &#145;has a great looseness that can't be stop'd has been twice blisterd for it. is something better this day, but its thought cannot live&#146;  (TNA: PRO, C 110/46/728&#150;9). Conolly died at his house in Capel Street, Dublin, on 30 October 1729 and was buried at Celbridge, co. Kildare. After his wife's death Conolly was succeeded by his nephew, William Conolly.<br>
<br>Conolly remains an elusive figure in terms of his personality. His rival, Brodrick, repeatedly accused him of sycophancy. Jonathan Swift was even more scathing:<blockquote>There was a fellow in Ireland called Conolly, who from a shoe-boy grew to be several times one of the chief Governors, wholly illiterate, and with hardly common sence. a Lord Lieutenant told the first K. George, that Conolly was the greatest subject he had in both Kingdoms, and truly this Character was gotten and preserved by Conolly's never appearing in England, which was the only wise thing he ever did except purchasing sixteen thousand pounds a year. (<span class="italic">Correspondence</span>, 3.493&#150;4)</blockquote>Other contemporaries, normally government supporters, gave a more positive assessment. The English-born bishop of Derry, William Nicolson, described Conolly as &#145;a person of wonderful parts and temper&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 6116, fols. 91&#150;2). Conolly was certainly adept at keeping in with those in power, realizing that political power in Ireland depended upon retaining the backing of the ministry in London. During the whig schism of the early years of George I's reign he kept close connections with the Townshend&#150;Walpole faction while also maintaining a good relationship with the earl of Sunderland, who protected the speaker during Bolton's viceroyalty. Recognizing, but affecting to despise, Conolly's skill in this respect, Brodrick complained that he was &#145;a happy man who by wishing well to and acting for one set of men renders or keeps himself gracious with the other&#146;  (Midleton MSS, 4, fols. 92&#150;4).<br>
<br>The true significance of Conolly's career is that between 1715 and 1729 he established a precedent for the government of Ireland for most of the eighteenth century. The first of the great &#145;undertakers&#146; who dominated Irish politics until the 1760s at least, he set the pattern for his successors. As speaker, chief revenue commissioner, and lord justice he normally controlled the proceedings of the Commons, had unrivalled access to revenue patronage, and directly communicated with the British ministry. His career illustrates the relatively open nature of the early eighteenth-century Irish &eacute;lite. Of relatively humble origins, he single-handedly established an Anglo-Irish dynasty and was reputed on his death to be the wealthiest man in Ireland, allegedly worth &pound;17,000 p.a.  (<span class="italic">Letters &hellip; Boulter</span>, 1.267). The physical manifestation of Conolly's career is his great house at Castletown, co. Kildare.<br>
