<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Yearsley <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Cromartie]</span>,  Ann</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1753, <em>d.</em> 1806), <span class="occ">poet and writer</span>, was baptized on 15 July 1753 (not 1752 or 1756 as are sometimes given) at St Andrew's Church in Clifton, near Bristol, the daughter of John and Ann Cromartie (<i>d</i>. 1784). Contemporary accounts describe Ann's mother as a milkwoman who trained her daughter in the same occupation, leading to Ann's later nicknames of &#145;the Bristol Milkwoman&#146; and Lactilla. Nothing is known about her father. Ann was taught reading and writing by her mother and her older brother, William, her only sibling. The mother died in March 1784, the brother at some time between 1774 and 1784.<br>
<br>On 8 June 1774 Ann married John Yearsley (<i>bap</i>. 1748, <i>d</i>. 1803), described as &#145;yeoman&#146; in the administration document of his mother's estate in that year; between 1775 and 1790 they had five sons and two daughters. By 1784 John Yearsley had lost yeoman status and was described as &#145;labourer&#146; in a deed of trust intended to protect his wife's earnings. Contemporary accounts of the family are inconsistent, but the local registers make clear that by the May of that year it comprised the parents and five children. They had fallen into destitution and were rescued from near-starvation by local charitable individuals; one of these, Hannah More, learned of Ann's local reputation as a poet. She organized, by subscription among her literary and wealthy friends, a volume of Yearsley's poetry, <span class="italic">Poems, on Several Occasions</span>, which was published to considerable acclaim in June 1785, with a &#145;Prefatory letter&#146;, addressed to Elizabeth Montagu, outlining More's version of Yearsley's story. Over one thousand subscribers are listed. Among members of the aristocracy and prominent churchmen are famous names such as Fanny Burney, Henry Dundas, Soame Jenyns, Sir Joshua Reynolds, Anna Seward, Lady (Eglantine) Wallace, Helen Maria Williams, and Horace Walpole. Shortly afterwards, More and Yearsley quarrelled about the profits from the book (about &pound;600), which More, with Montagu, had put in a trust &#145;lest her Husband shou'd spend it&#146;  (letter to Montagu, Montagu MSS, MO 3991). Yearsley thought that there should be no restriction, at least on her use of the interest from the investment. By October 1785 More had reluctantly wound up the trust and Yearsley eventually gained access to the money. Two more editions of the book were published under More's supervision; a fourth was undertaken by a different publisher in 1786 after Yearsley had broken with More. This includes an &#145;Autobiographical narrative&#146;, the author's version of the quarrel, which comprehensively refutes that of More.<br>
<br>With encouragement and some financial help from Frederick Augustus Hervey, fourth earl of Bristol, and others Yearsley published a second volume of poetry, <span class="italic">Poems, on Various Subjects</span>, in 1787, which adds the deed of trust to the other prefaces; the subscription list to this work, though shorter, shows some continued support among prominent members of the establishment. Close associates of Hannah More dropped away, and were replaced by the earl of Bristol and members of the Irish peerage, especially the Perceval family. Lady Wallace appears again; a new literary subscriber is &#145;Mrs. E. Knipe&#146; (Elizabeth). <span class="italic">Earl Goodwin: an Historical Play</span> was produced in Bristol and Bath in November 1789 and printed in 1791. In 1795 Yearsley published a four-volume historical novel entitled <span class="italic">The Royal Captives: a Fragment of Secret History, Copied from an Old Manuscript</span>, and in 1796 <span class="italic">The Rural Lyre: a Volume of Poems</span>. Subscribers to the latter work include figures of national and international importance, such as Augustus Frederick, son of George III; Henry Dundas, now secretary of war; Georgiana Cavendish, duchess of Devonshire; members of the Esterh&aacute;zy family; Sir William and Lady Hamilton; Charles Jenkinson, first earl of Liverpool; and, from the literary world, Charlotte Smith. A number of occasional poems and other pieces (for instance, <span class="italic">A Poem on the Inhumanity of the Slave Trade</span> and laments for the deaths of Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette) appeared between 1788 and 1796. Some of her poems are on topics of local interest, for example, <span class="italic">Stanzas of woe, addressed from the heart on a bed of illness, to Levi Eames, esq., late mayor of the city of Bristol</span> (1790) and &#145;Bristol Elegy&#146; in <span class="italic">The Rural Lyre</span>. Her poems were occasionally printed in Bristol newspapers. Twelve manuscript poems appear on the endpapers of a copy of her published poems up to 1788 held by Bristol Public Libraries. From about 1793 she ran a circulating library at the Colonnade, Hotwells. The quarrel had led to a polarization of opinion on the success of this enterprise: supporters of More tended to pronounce it a failure  (Thompson, 58&#150;9), while others refer to it as an integral part of Clifton life at the time.<br>
<br>Engravings of two portraits of Yearsley, both published in 1787, show a strong-featured, serious-looking woman, with dark hair and eyes; in one she is presented in becoming but unpretentious dress, perhaps indicative of her status; in the other she is wearing the characteristic broad-brimmed beaver hat of the Bristol milkwomen. Hannah More described her in a letter of 1784 as &#145;slender and not ill-made; her face plain, but not disagreeable, her countenance rather pensive than sad, her pronunciation vulgar and provincial&#146;  (Hannah More to Mary Hamilton, priv. coll.). In 1837 Joseph Cottle, a Bristol bookseller and literary patron, remembered her as evincing, &#145;even in her countenance, the unequivocal marks of genius&#146;  (Cottle, 48).<br>
<br>It is probable that Yearsley ceased milk-selling early in her literary career; her writing and her library appear to have furnished her with resources for a relatively comfortable life. A handwritten note on a Bath playbill now in the Harvard Theatre Collection indicates that she received at least &pound;80 from the benefit performances of her play, and Cottle says that she was advanced an unusual &pound;200 for her novel. In 1790 she apprenticed her eldest surviving son, William, to a famous London engraver, Anker Smith, for a premium of 100 guineas. William died in 1799, aged twenty-two; her third surviving son, Charles, also died, probably &#145;in battle&#146; during the 1790s  (Thompson, 61). Her remaining son, John, engaged prosperously in the cloth trade at Trowbridge, Wiltshire, becoming proprietor of the Bridge Mills, its largest steam textile mill  (K. H. Rogers, <span class="italic">Wiltshire and Somerset Woollen Mills</span>, 1976). Thither Yearsley followed him with at least one of her two daughters, probably after the death of her husband in 1803, settling in nearby Melksham. She died there on 6 May 1806; she was buried on 12 May in St Andrew's churchyard at Clifton. Her death was reported in the newspapers of Bristol as that of a prominent person and local worthy. Thompson's description of her as &#145;outcast, desolate &hellip; insane and destitute&#146; at the end of her life  (Thompson, 61) is without foundation.<br>
<br>Contemporary comment is curiously blind to the real content of Yearsley's work. She was regarded as a primitive, rural poet with a special, mysterious gift only bestowed on persons without conventional education. Her poetry is often referred to as &#145;wild and simple&#146;  (J. Evans, <span class="italic">History of Bristol</span>, 2 vols., 1816, 2.297). Such judgements misrepresent most of her work, which is highly sophisticated. Intense self-analysis often merges with religious and philosophical speculation. Although a number of the poems are concerned with social and political justice, she is a passionate opponent of war and revolution. Cottle is almost alone in his estimate of her as a formidable thinker, referring to her alongside Coleridge, Southey, and Humphrey Davy as one of the &#145;busy, the aspiring, and the intellectual spirits&#146; who inhabited Bristol during the 1790s  (Cottle, xiii).<br>
<br>Yearsley was also affected by the political reaction of the period which tended to categorize lower-status writers, especially women, as subversive  (R. Polewhele, <span class="italic">The Unsex'd Females</span>, 1798, 20). In the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries she was remembered chiefly as the ungrateful recipient of patronage, especially in biographies of Hannah More. Southey, who in 1799 was hoping to include a poem by Yearsley in his <span class="italic">Annual Anthology</span>, later gave a rather deprecating account of her, only conceding that &#145;she was no mocking-bird&#146;  (R. Southey, <span class="italic">Attempts in Verse by John Jones, an Old Servant</span>, 1831, 129&#150;30). Since the 1930s her work has been taken more seriously, though her poetry was still described as &#145;ungainly verse&#146; in 1938  (Tompkins, 58). Latterly her writing has received some serious critical attention; she has also been seen by some as an early feminist and combative champion of the proletariat. Taken as a whole, her <i>&#339;uvre</i> does not support this view; she seems rather to demonstrate a certain benevolent conservatism which influenced much of the literature of this period.<br>
