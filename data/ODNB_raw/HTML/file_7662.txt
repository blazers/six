<span class="headword">Dillon, Sir  Robert</span>  (<em>c.</em>1540&#150;1597), <span class="occ">judge</span>, was the eldest son of Thomas Dillon of Riverston, co. Meath, and his wife, Anne, daughter of Sir Thomas Luttrell (<i>d</i>. 1554), former chief justice of common pleas. His grandfather Sir Bartholomew Dillon (<i>d</i>. 1534) had been an important ally of the earl of Kildare and served briefly as chief justice of king's bench in 1533&#150;4. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7661/', "Sir Robert Dillon (d. 1579?)")</script>, of Newtown Trim, his great-uncle, was chief justice of common pleas from 1559 to 1579, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7659/', "Sir Lucas Dillon (d. 1592)")</script>, his cousin, was chief baron of the exchequer from 1570 to 1592. Robert Dillon of Riverston was probably born about 1540 and studied law at Lincoln's Inn where he was escheator in 1560. After a quarrel with Nicholas Nugent in that year he was bound to keep the peace. In 1562 he signed the book of twenty-four articles, a critique of the Dublin government's use of purveyance. He was called to the bar in England in 1567 and on 1 June 1569 was named second justice of the newly installed presidency and council of Connaught as &#145;a suitable man of this country, learned in the laws and with the knowledge of the Irish tongue&#146;  (Morrin, 533&#150;4).<br>
<br>Dillon was an ambitious and exceedingly well-connected member of a distinguished judicial family. In his first post, however, he exhibited the combative temper which marked his subsequent career. Allied with the first president of Connaught, the wily Sir Edward Fitton, Dillon defended his ruthless campaigns against the criticism of the cautious lord deputy, Sir William Fitzwilliam. When the truculent Fitton won higher office as vice-treasurer, after retreating from his precarious role in Athlone, Dillon was appointed chancellor of the exchequer in Ireland on 5 June 1572. Though aligned with his moderate older cousin Sir Lucas Dillon, who was made chief baron in 1570, Robert the younger made an enemy of Fitzwilliam. The viceroy attacked Fitton in council for refusing to sign a warrant and imprisoned the unruly vice-treasurer in June 1573. Fitzwilliam urged Elizabeth to commit Dillon to the Fleet when he arrived in London as agent for the closeted Fitton. However, the queen took the side of Dillon and Fitton, reprimanding Fitzwilliam, who was soon to be replaced.<br>
<br>When Sir Henry Sidney succeeded as chief governor in 1575 he regarded the Dillons as loyal allies and Robert was appointed second justice of common pleas, under his aged great-uncle, on 26 November 1577. Lord Chancellor Gerard commended him for his learning in 1576, and in 1580 the vice-treasurer, Wallop, sought the chief justiceship for him, noting that he had executed both offices during the past four years while the senior Dillon was too enfeebled to serve. During the constitutional crisis of the cess (1577&#150;9) Dillon was apparently an interested bystander, while his nemesis and rival Nicholas Nugent was summarily expelled as second baron of the exchequer for his challenge to the legality of purveyance. None the less, on the death of the ancient chief justice, Nugent was preferred as his successor on the nomination of the lord chancellor, frustrating the expectations of Dillon. Wallop claimed that Nugent had purchased the reversion of office for a mere &pound;100 and that he was a covert papist. The recommendation of Dillon by Edward Waterhouse on 20 April 1580 declared &#145;he is reported one of the most sufficient in knowledge and Judgment and he is of very good hability to beare out the Countenace of a Consaillor, being born to fair living as the chief of that surname&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 63/72/147).<br>
<br>Denied his chance in 1580, another opportunity came quickly for Dillon in the form of the Nugent rebellion in the pale in 1581. The new lord chancellor, Archbishop Adam Loftus, had written in April 1581 to Cecil that the chief justiceship had been promised by Sidney to Dillon, that Nugent was less skilful, and that Dillon's loyalty to the queen was not inferior to those of English birth. Dillon was appointed chief justice of common pleas on 14 July 1581 and the dismissed Nugent was accused of supporting his cousin's insurrection, conspiring to take Dublin Castle, and planning to ambush Sir Lucas and Sir Robert on their way to hold sessions at Mullingar. At a special tribunal at Trim on 4 April 1582 Nugent was tried for treason. He complained that only one tainted witness gave testimony, and Sir Robert was accused of soliciting witnesses and bullying jurors into reversing their verdict; but Nugent was hanged at Trim two days later.<br>
<br>Despite the political scandal Dillon was knighted in 1581 and raised to the honour of privy councillor. He was reputed the wealthiest commoner in the pale in 1586, and received a lease of land in Oxmantown in 1588 as token of gratitude from Dublin corporation. Like his cousin, Dillon was a supporter of Lord Deputy Perrot in council. In 1588 he was named a commissioner for the new composition of Connaught, but after Perrot's dismissal he faced his old enemy Sir William Fitzwilliam as the new chief governor. Dillon had quarrelled with Sir Richard Bingham over the management of the Connaught presidency and was excluded from the council during the inquiry into Bingham's government in 1589. In 1591 Dillon was accused by the former rebel William Nugent of encouraging Sir Brian O'Rourke in rebellion. His trial was managed by the English privy council in June 1593, seeking proofs from Dublin and requiring a speedy conclusion out of respect of the office of chief justice. On the evidence, Dillon was removed from office and imprisoned in October 1593, yet his supporter, Lord Chancellor Loftus, declared him innocent of the charges on 22 November. Five days later he was named a commissioner of ecclesiastical causes, and he was restored to the council in the following year. On the death of his replacement, Sir William Weston, on 23 September 1594, Secretary Fenton wrote to Burghley that Dillon should be restored to office. He regained the chief justiceship by patent on 15 March 1595, a notable exception to the elimination of loyal Old English councillors after 1592.<br>
<br>Dillon's first wife was Eleanor, daughter of Thomas Allen of Kilteel, co. Kildare, with whom he had one son who predeceased him. After the death of Eleanor he married Katherine (<i>d</i>. 1615), daughter of the wealthy Dublin alderman Sir William Sarsfield of Lucan; with his second wife he had five sons and nine daughters. Dillon died in office while at Riverston on 15 July 1597, and was buried at the parish church in Tara where a memorial was placed in his honour. His brother Gerald was clerk of the crown and third justice of queen's bench, though he was imprisoned as part of the anti-Dillon inquisition of 1591&#150;3. His kinsman Thomas Dillon of Proudstown was chief justice of Connaught and third justice of common pleas, though he also was briefly imprisoned in the Bingham conflict of the 1590s.<br>
