<span class="headword">Kerslake,  Thomas</span>  (1812&#150;1891), <span class="occ">bookseller</span>, was born in July 1812 in Exeter, the son of William Kerslake. He was educated in Exeter and married Catherine Morgan of Bath. In 1828 he moved to Bristol, and with his brother-in-law Samuel Cornish of London began business as a secondhand bookseller in Barton Alley. In 1839 the partnership was dissolved and Kerslake moved to a shop at the bottom of Park Street, Bristol. In 1860 a disastrous fire in the premises resulted in the loss of many rare and valuable books and manuscripts (Kerslake had amassed a valuable collection of antiquarian and archaeological works before the fire). He continued at the same premises, but in 1870 he moved to Queen's Road, retiring shortly after this.<br>
<br>Following his retirement Kerslake devoted himself to antiquarian studies and although self-taught he had a good command of Latin and modern languages. His main interests were in the hagiology and the Anglo-Saxon period of the south-west. He published a number of articles on these subjects, usually at his own expense, as well as contributing papers to national and local archaeological societies. His writings often contained original theories and complex and sometimes controversial arguments.<br>
<br>One controversy in which Kerslake became involved was in the origin of the Pen Pits near Penselwood in Somerset. He believed that this group of amorphous surface undulations were the remains of an old British city and he published two papers on the subject: <span class="italic">A primaeval British Metropolis</span> (1877) and <span class="italic">Caer Pensauelcoit: a Re-Assertion</span> (1882). Others claimed that they were merely quarries. Under the auspices of the Somerset Archaeological and Natural History Society a Pen Pits Exploration Committee was set up; rather belatedly Kerslake was invited to join, but he refused. An excavation in 1884 by General Pitt Rivers in his role as inspector of ancient monuments concluded that the pits were quarries for quernstones and should not be scheduled, evoking from Kerslake a scathing paper: <span class="italic">The Liberty of Independent Historical Research</span> (1885).<br>
<br>Kerslake died at his home, Wynfrid, Clevedon, on 5 January 1891; his wife predeceased him in 1887. They had no children.<br>
