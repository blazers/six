<span class="headword">Nugent,  Thomas</span>, fourth earl of Westmeath  (1668/9&#150;1752), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was the second son of Christopher Nugent, Lord Delvin (<i>d</i>. before 1680), the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20398/', "Richard Nugent, second earl of Westmeath (1626&#150;1684)")</script>, and of his wife, Mary (1640/41&#150;1737), eldest daughter of Richard Butler of Kilcash, co. Tipperary, and niece of James Butler, first duke of Ormond. His elder brother, Richard Nugent (<i>d</i>. 1714), was a Capuchin friar in France, and on the death of his grandfather in 1684 Thomas succeeded to the extensive family estates centred on his residence at Clonyn, Delvin, co. Westmeath. From then on he was generally styled earl of Westmeath, taking his seat as such in the upper house of the 1689 Irish parliament, by royal dispensation as he was under age. In 1684, aged sixteen, he married Margaret (<i>d</i>. 1700), only daughter of Sir John Bellew, later Baron Bellew of Duleek. They had eleven children, of whom two sons and two daughters survived to adulthood.<br>
<br>Westmeath travelled abroad for a few years, returning to Ireland to enter the army, which was being expanded in the crisis preceding the Williamite wars. He served first as lieutenant-colonel of the earl of Tyrone's infantry regiment, and from the summer of 1689 as colonel of the infantry regiment raised by Colonel Francis Toole, which in 1690 he led at the battle of the Boyne and the first siege of Limerick. For the 1691 campaign he transferred to command of a cavalry regiment and fought at the battle of Aughrim. He steered a middle line between the defeatist and militant factions on the Jacobite side, approving the acquittal by court martial of Brigadier Henry Luttrell on a charge of corresponding with the enemy, but supporting the arrest of Brigadier Robert Clifford for failing to obstruct the passage of the Williamites across the Shannon. When the Jacobites asked for terms on 23 September, he hurried to Limerick from the nearby cavalry camp, dining with Ginkel while passing through the Williamite lines. Subsequently he was one of four Jacobite peers exchanged as hostages during the negotiations which led to the treaty of Limerick. He was attainted in both England and Ireland for his participation in the war, but in 1692 he was pardoned under the Limerick articles and recovered his estates. Thereafter, as a Roman Catholic, he was excluded from public life. In 1705 he sought a pass for himself and his son to travel to Holland in order to settle his son there for education.<br>
<br>Westmeath's eldest daughter, Mary (<i>d</i>. 1725), married Francis (Bermingham), Lord Athenry, and her son, Thomas, was created earl of Louth in 1759. His second daughter, Catherine (<i>d</i>. 1756), married Andrew Nugent of Dysart, co. Westmeath, and was the mother of Lavalin Nugent. Westmeath died, aged about eighty-three, on 30 June 1752. As he was predeceased by both his sons, Christopher, Lord Delvin (<i>d</i>. 1752), who was unmarried, and John (<i>d</i>. 1725), his title passed briefly to his brother, the soldier <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20391/', "John Nugent")</script>, and on his death to his son Thomas (1714&#150;1792), who took his seat in the House of Lords, having conformed to the established church in order to avoid the adverse inheritance implications of the penal laws.<br>
