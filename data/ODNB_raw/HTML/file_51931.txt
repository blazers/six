</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Williams, Sir  (Evan) Owen</span>  (1890&#150;1969), <span class="occ">civil engineer and architect</span>, was the son of Evan Owen Williams, a grocer of Welsh provenance settled in Amhurst Park, Stoke Newington, London, and his wife, Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Roberts. He was born on 20 March 1890 at 16 Caroline Terrace, St Ann's Road, Tottenham. From 1901 he attended Tottenham grammar school where he did well in mathematics and matriculated in 1907. He then took an apprenticeship with the Metropolitan Electric Tramways Company, which was extending its network over northern districts of London. Simultaneously Williams went to evening classes at the Northern Polytechnic Institute, whence in 1911 he graduated with first-class honours in engineering.<br>
<br>In that year Williams entered the field which he was to make his own, that of structural engineering in reinforced concrete. Little more than a decade old but fast expanding, it was dominated by competitive contracting&#150;engineering firms which were exploiting different patent systems of reinforcement. Williams worked briefly for the Indented Bar and Concrete Engineering Company, then in 1912&#150;16 for the larger, American-owned, Trussed Concrete Steel Company, first as senior designer and afterwards as chief estimator. In the former capacity he designed his first building, a six-storey cabinet factory for the Gramophone Company (later EMI) at Hayes, Middlesex, but most of his responsibilities concerned bridges, docks, reservoirs, and industrial plant, often in south Wales where he spent time on site. In 1916&#150;17 Williams worked for the Wells Aviation Company, designing a flying boat; then in 1917&#150;18 he was chief engineer at the Admiralty shipyard at Poole, where he built reinforced concrete lighters and tugs (as others were also doing). This led to an unexploited patent for a system of ship construction. He designed further concrete barges and coasters during the Second World War.<br>
<br>Williams's independent career began straight after the First World War, when the patent licensees for concrete construction ceased to be dominant. He gained rapid success as a consulting engineer, with an office in London. Industrial buildings, especially in south Wales, were at first the staple of his work. He stepped into the limelight as engineer for the whole of the British Empire Exhibition at Wembley, opened in 1924. The vast and manly forms of the palaces of industry and engineering and of the Wembley stadium had more to do with Williams than with their architect, Maxwell Ayrton. They earned him an unexpected knighthood at the age of thirty-four, when he had yet to be recognized by his professional contemporaries. Williams and Ayrton went on to collaborate on a series of notable bridges, particularly at Findhorn, Spey, Crubenmore, and Loch Alvie on the A9 in the Scottish highlands (1924&#150;8). These commissions for the Ministry of Transport were the first structures in Britain convincingly to develop a distinctive aesthetic for reinforced concrete and display the raw, heavy, angular idiom which Williams was to make his own.<br>
<br>In 1929 Williams trespassed upon the realm of high architecture when he was invited by McAlpines, contractors for the Empire Exhibition, to design the whole of the Dorchester Hotel in Park Lane, London, including interiors and elevations. The structural candour of Williams's design proved too much for the syndicate to swallow. He was sacked after construction had commenced but took bitter delight in sending the drawings round to his successor, the architect W. Curtis Green, in a taxi. This episode ushered in an energetic decade during which Williams dazzled the avant-garde with a batch of big projects that were at the forefront of modernism yet, unlike the modernism of the architects themselves, owed little to continental paradigms. They included the <span class="italic">Daily Express</span> buildings in London, Manchester, and Glasgow, the first structures in Britain to explore the aesthetic of the curtain wall with a sure sense of style; the Boots &#145;wets&#146; factory at Beeston, Nottingham, Williams's masterpiece, in which an open production space in the centre, designed for cleanliness, is flanked by flat-slab floors on mushroom-headed columns, drawn out to the perimeter and revealed between continuous strips of glazing; the Boots &#145;drys&#146; factory, also at Beeston; the Pioneer Health Centre, Peckham, London; the Dollis Hill Synagogue, Dollis Hill, Middlesex, with an early &#145;folded plate&#146; roof; and, back at Wembley, the Empire pool, where Williams spanned over 230 feet with three-pinned arches counterbalanced by ranks of external fins with little water towers perched over the corners. The contrast between this building (1933&#150;4) and its predecessors at Wembley manifested Williams's spectacular development.<br>
<br>A setback to Williams's career occurred in 1940 when the Vickers-Armstrongs aircraft factory at Blackpool, a rare example of his engagement in steel-framed design, collapsed during construction; prolonged litigation ensued. In 1945 Sir Owen Williams &amp; Partners were appointed engineers for the Newport (Monmouthshire) bypass, the first British road to be designed to motorway standards. Though not built until 1957&#150;67, the project secured Williams's pre-eminence in the early years of British motorway design. The most famous fruit of this was the Luton to Crick section of the M1, opened in 1959 and punctuated by ponderous bridges that exploit concrete for monumentality rather than elegance; there is a specially noble viaduct, unseen by motorists, over the River Ouse in Buckinghamshire. Because of his commitment to roads, Williams was less involved with buildings after 1945. His most complex achievement, the structure of the <span class="italic">Daily Mirror</span> building, London (1955&#150;61), was hidden behind banal elevations by another hand. In his British Overseas Airways Corporation maintenance headquarters (now Technical Block A), Heathrow airport, London (1950&#150;55), Williams renewed his pre-war ambitions as an architect&#150;engineer to create a building of unique form in which four wide-span aircraft hangars are sandwiched between offices and workshops, the hangars having entrance arches of 336 feet in span with vast external counterbalances, and roofs consisting of deep V-shaped trusses running 420 feet from front to back.<br>
<br>On 31 July 1915 Williams married Gwladys Clarissa Tustian (1888&#150;1947), with whom he had a son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/60329/', "Owen Tudor Williams")</script>, and a daughter. After her death he married, on 24 October 1947, Doreen Elizabeth (<i>b</i>. 1913/14), daughter of Percy Harold Baker, who survived him and with whom he had a further son and daughter. &#145;O. T.&#146; Williams (1916&#150;1996) joined his father's firm and succeeded him as managing partner of Sir Owen Williams &amp; Partners. He was responsible for much motorway work during and after his father's lifetime, most famously for &#145;spaghetti junction&#146; on the midlands links motorway north of Birmingham. Williams retired to Berkhamsted because of failing health in 1966 and died at the West Hertfordshire Hospital, Hemel Hempstead, on 23 May 1969.<br>
<br>Sir Owen Williams was the most creative of all British structural designers working in his lifetime. Single-handedly, he revived the noble native tradition of empirical architect&#150;engineer. He was an ambitious autodidact whose career crossed boundaries and whose combative attitudes rustled the dovecotes in two professions. Building was his personal passion; he had an insatiable appetite for work. As a designer, Williams was a poor delegator and sometimes radically changed arrangements at a late stage. He wrote little, but enjoyed challenging orthodoxies and proposing cheap and bold solutions to public projects in letters to <span class="italic">The Times</span>. Compared to his nearest rival, Oscar Faber, Williams was not a structural theorist, though his understanding of concrete construction, especially of arches, was profound. His commitment to concrete was complete, though he could be conservative about the development of techniques, as in his aversion to pre-stressed concrete. To architecture he brought a plain man's economical and pragmatic attitude which appealed to clients, yet he was able after 1930 to convert this into a progressive idiom wholly his own which has given him international status in the architectural canon. He was at his best with big, functional buildings. The lumpy angularity of his cheap bridges faced in raw concrete and of his mushroom-columned factory frames prefigured and in part inspired the British &#145;brutalist&#146; aesthetic of the 1960s, with which Williams would have claimed no connection. His tall and broad physique and tough personality are lastingly expressed in his structures.<br>
