<span class="headword">Gast,  John</span>  (<em>c.</em>1772&#150;1837), <span class="occ">trade unionist and radical</span>, was born in Bristol, the son of Robert Gast, a seller of milk. He had at least two brothers, and at some time married Elizabeth, who outlived him, but nothing else is known of his family. Soon after finishing his apprenticeship he left Bristol, and after a short spell at Portsmouth Royal Dockyard in 1797, where he acted as the workers' spokesman in complaints against one of the quartermen, he went to London. He worked there in the Thames dockyards for the rest of his life. He was a leader in the great shipwrights' strike of 1802, of which he wrote and published a remarkable account; he also became a publican between 1810 and 1812, and was for a time a dissenting preacher in Deptford. In 1814 he was imprisoned for fortune-telling.<br>
<br>As a political reformer, Gast organized support for Sir Samuel Romilly in his candidacy at Bristol in the 1812 general election, but voted for both Romilly and the more radical Henry Hunt, whose ally he became. In 1818 he led the formation of the Philanthropic Hercules, a very early attempt at a general union of trades, a cause he supported for the rest of his career. He also became a leading member of the group of radical revolutionaries led by James Watson and Arthur Thistlewood that eventually in 1820 organized the Cato Street conspiracy, although it is unclear how far Gast was involved in this. He then took the leading role in organizing artisan support for the great campaign in favour of Queen Caroline against her husband, George IV.<br>
<br>In 1824 Gast was one of the leaders of the new Thames shipwrights' union, which organized a great strike in 1825. Gast also formed a committee of trades' delegates in 1825 to campaign against the move to repeal the legalization of trade unions the previous year. This committee went on to establish the world's first trade union paper, the <span class="italic">Trades' Newspaper</span>, of which Gast was manager. In the later 1820s he formed a new general trades organization, and was also one of the leaders in a campaign that in 1828 secured the defeat of a bill to control friendly societies; they went on to draw up a bill of their own, which was passed into law in 1829. In 1830 he was active in the new co-operative movement, and a deist lecturer in a group of radicals, freethinkers, Spenceans, and Owenites that met at various places during the next few years. He was also a prominent member of the National Union of the Working Classes between 1831 and 1833, and in 1836 was a founder member of the London Working Men's Association that drew up the famous <span class="roman">People's Charter</span>.<br>
<br>Gast died of a cerebral haemorrhage at Rotherhithe on 5 November 1837, after a long and exceptionally full career that made him one of the outstanding working-class leaders of his time and a pioneer of the labour movement.<br>
