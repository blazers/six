<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Miller,  Ruby Laura Rose</span>  (1889&#150;1976), <span class="occ">actress</span>, was born on 14 July 1889 at 64 Water Lane, Brixton, London, the daughter of Arthur Miller, a commercial traveller in the leather trade, and his wife, Augusta Catherine Leon. She was educated in London and at a convent in Amiens. Her first marriage, to Lieutenant Phillip Samson, ended when he was killed in action in 1918. Her second marriage in 1929, to her long-time sweetheart, the composer, conductor, and concert pianist Max Darewski, ended with his early death some five months later. <br>
<br>Miller later claimed that her first professional stage appearance was in J. T. Tanner's musical play <span class="italic">The Orchid</span> (music by I. Caryll and L. Monckton) alongside Gertie Millar and George Grossmith jun., at the Gaiety Theatre in 1903 at the age of thirteen, though she told those auditioning her that she was eighteen. When her parents found out about her lie some three months later, George Edwardes, the musical comedy impresario who produced the show, withdrew her from the production and told her to come back when she was eighteen. Other sources suggest that her d&eacute;but was in 1906 as a dancer in <span class="italic">Nero</span> by Stephen Philips at His Majesty's Theatre, which would have been after her time at the Academy of Dramatic Art. Miller spent a number of years as a Gaiety girl under the management of George Edwardes, but much of her early work was with Herbert Tree's company, taking small parts and understudying in Shakespearian and costume dramas. She also toured with Herbert Tree in Berlin in 1907. <br>
<br>At nineteen Miller returned to the Gaiety and understudied both Gladys Cooper and Gertie Millar in J. T. Tanner's <span class="italic">Our Miss Gibbs</span> (music again by Caryll and Monckton). The Gaiety girls were the toast of Edwardian London, courting the many aristocrats who frequented the shows. They led fashion trends and often ended up marrying into the aristocracy. Miller's time as a Gaiety girl provided the basis for one of the most long-lasting myths about her career&#151;that a Russian duke was so enamoured of her that he drank champagne out of her shoe; when she noted that the shoe was now ruined, he ordered numerous pairs of new shoes to be delivered to her rooms the next day. Such romantic stories abound in her autobiographical volumes, <span class="italic">Believe me or not</span> (1934) and <span class="italic">Champagne from my Slipper</span> (1962). However, Miller was more interested in her professional career than in marrying into the social &eacute;lite. In 1910 she went to work with Charles Hawtrey at His Majesty's Theatre and in 1913 she was given a cameo role in the touring and London production of a farce, <span class="italic">Oh! I Say!</span> by S. Blowe and D. Hoare. She then went on to one of her most famous roles, as Maimie Scott in the 1915 farce, <span class="italic">A Little Bit of Fluff</span> by W. W. Ellis, in which she apparently shocked a generation by revealing glimpses of her knee; she played the role for a year. <br>
<br>Miller also appeared in many early films, among them Bertie Samuelson's <span class="italic">Little Women and Good Wives</span> and <span class="italic">The Edge of Beyond</span> (1919), and Maurice Elvey's <span class="italic">The Mystery of Bernard Brown</span>. She later produced a stage adaptation of <span class="italic">The Edge of beyond</span> (1921) which she had co-written with with Roy Horniman. (Other co-authorships included her <span class="italic">Big Ben</span> with Evadne Price in 1939.) At this point she went into management as well as playing the lead in the show. The mid-1920s took Miller to America in the hope of an extended contract with Cecil B. De Mille, but she was usurped by Pola Negri, also known for her portrayal of what Miller called &#145;lurid vamp parts&#146;. On her return to England, Miller performed in the pre-London run of Arnold Ridley's long-running <span class="italic">The Ghost Train</span> (1925) alongside a very young Laurence Olivier. During the 1930s and 1940s Miller worked on more British films, including <span class="italic">Power of Attorney</span> (1942), <span class="italic">Flying Fortress</span> (1942), and <span class="italic">The Hundred Pound Widow</span> (1943), and during the Second World War she took part in concerts for the troops. In the 1950s she did a lot of radio and television work, also giving national and international lecture tours in which she talked about her days as a Gaiety girl and about her professional acquaintance with the leading performers of a bygone age, such as Marie Lloyd, Evelyn Laye, and Gladys Cooper. It was on these tours that she used to make such statements as, &#145;Women have lost the power to excite romance and mystery&#146;, or &#145;Remember, girls, men are the hunters. Don't try to compete with them&#146;. Miller came from an age of heightened femininity, but chose to work rather than get remarried in the early 1920s. She sought a career which marked her out as a modern, liberated woman during an age when marriage and family was the destiny for most women. <br>
<br>Ruby Miller died on 2 April 1976 at 8 Cawley Road, Chichester, Sussex.<br>
