<span class="headword">Boit,  Charles</span>  (1662&#150;1727), <span class="occ">miniature painter</span>, was born on 10 August 1662 in Stockholm, the son of Charles Boit, a French silk merchant and salt manufacturer, and his wife, Marie, daughter of Noak Creveleur of Calais, France. Boit served an apprenticeship to a goldsmith in Stockholm from 1677 to 1682 and then spent three months in Paris before heading to G&ouml;teborg. There he married his first wife, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Flitzberg, with whom he had a daughter who died in infancy.<br>
<br>By the time that Boit had returned to Stockholm, in 1685, he had become fully versed in the French art of enamelling. Reynolds suggests exposure to the work of Jean Petitot and Jacques Bordier in Paris and a previous connection with Pierre Signac, a French enamellist working at the Swedish court, as important early influences. Boit came to England in 1687 and soon became the prot&eacute;g&eacute; of the Swedish artist Michael Dahl, some of whose portraits, like those of Godfrey Kneller, he copied in miniature. He also worked from life and appears to have travelled around the country at this early stage of his career in search of work. Two of his earliest miniatures, of Sir Gervase and Lady Scrope (1693), were painted in Lincoln. He also worked in Coventry at about this time teaching drawing to Humfrey Wanley, library-keeper to Robert Harley, earl of Oxford, one of Boit's most influential patrons. The hallmark of his style, already distinctive at this early stage, was the application of rich colours to the enamel with very smoothly blended brushstrokes which became invisible on firing. He usually signed his work on the reverse &#145;C. Boit pinxit&#146; and often with the initials C. B. in monogram on the obverse. Boit's life was beset by crises and Walpole records the anecdote that, during his travels, he was unjustly imprisoned for conducting an affair with one of his pupils. This does not seem to have impeded his success for on his return to London he was appointed court enameller to William III (1696).<br>
<br>Boit left England to visit the Netherlands (1699), D&uuml;sseldorf (1700), and Vienna (1700&#150;03). In Vienna he produced his most impressive work to date, a huge enamel of Emperor Leopold I and his family, measuring 38 cm by 46 (Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna). Though this miniature was flawed by severe cracks Boit undertook an even more ambitious commission for Queen Anne on his return to England in 1703: an allegorical enamel, measuring approximately 60 cm by 40, commemorating the battle of Blenheim. Boit's assistant, Otto Peterson, gave Vertue a detailed account of the technical and financial difficulties that dogged the project over almost ten years. Eventually, in 1714, Boit was asked to return the money that had been invested in the failed scheme and he was subsequently forced to flee in debt to France. He visited Dresden in 1719&#150;20 but settled in Paris and at first appears to have prospered, receiving a salary of &pound;250 per annum and lodgings from the king according to Vertue. He was made an <i>agr&eacute;e</i> of the Acad&eacute;mie Royale and enjoyed the patronage of Peter the Great, tsar of Russia, whom he had first encountered in London in 1698, and of the regent, the duke of Orl&eacute;ans. However, he was once again in debt by the time of his death, at his lodgings in the rue de la Petit-Bourbon, quartier du Luxembourg, Paris, on 6 February 1727. He left three children by his second marriage, to Anne-Marguerite Williart, who predeceased him: Alexandre (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1712), Anne (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1714), and Charlotte (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1720).<br>
<br>Examples of Boit's English work can be seen in the Victoria and Albert Museum and the National Portrait Gallery, London, and in the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford. Of his largest surviving enamels one represents Queen Anne and Prince George of Denmark (1706; Royal Collection), another John Manners, second duke of Rutland (<i>c</i>.1714; Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge). Examples of Boit's work in France can be seen in the Mus&eacute;e du Louvre, Paris, and in the Mus&eacute;e Cond&eacute;, Chantilly; other enamels are in the National Museum, Stockholm, and the Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam. A portrait of Boit, engraved by A. Bannerman, was published in Walpole's <span class="italic">Anecdotes of Painting in England</span> (1763). His career was important not only for the transcendence that it gave enamel painting in England over the more traditional method of painting miniatures in watercolour on vellum but also for the transmission of the enamelling skills he had learned to his pupils Otto Peterson, John Milward, and Christian Frederick Zincke.<br>
