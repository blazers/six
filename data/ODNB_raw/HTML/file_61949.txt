<span class="headword">Reese,  (John) Terence</span>  (1913&#150;1996), <span class="occ">bridge player and writer</span>, was born on 28 August 1913 in the High Street, Epsom, Surrey, the son of John Reese, baker and confectioner, and his wife, Annie Maria Riddington, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Hutchings. His parents had met when &#145;first gentleman&#146; and &#145;first lady&#146; at a whist drive. He first played bridge at the age of seven, during a family holiday in Dorset. Finding thirteen cards rather a handful, he would dismount from his chair and sort his cards behind a cushion. He was educated at Bilton Grange preparatory school, then at Bradfield College, where he gained his colours at football and cricket. Very much an all-rounder, he won the top classical scholarship to New College, Oxford, and it was there that he first played bridge seriously. In the inaugural inter-varsity match he captained the Oxford team, defeating a Cambridge side led by Iain Macleod, the future chancellor of the exchequer. Unknown to the college authorities, Reese subsidized his lifestyle by running a book at nearby greyhound tracks. After leaving Oxford with a third-class degree in <i>literae humaniores</i> in 1935 he worked briefly at Harrods before becoming a full-time professional bridge player and writer. With four leading players of the day&#151;Macleod, Jack Marx, Maurice Harrison-Gray, and Skid Simon&#151;Reese invented the Acol bidding system. Still used by most British players, it embraced a variable no-trump, openings of one spade and one heart on a four-card suit, and intermediate two-bids. Joining forces with Hubert Phillips and Harold Franklin in 1936, he hosted early radio and television bridge programmes.<br>
<br>The tall, balding Reese soon became the dominant figure in the tournament world. He formed a famous partnership with Boris Schapiro, winning the gold cup eight times and the master pairs seven times. Reese was a masterful card player but conservative in the auction; Schapiro was more flamboyant, choosing bids and plays likely to provoke the opponents into error. They were the anchor pair in British teams that won the European championship in 1948, 1949, 1954, and 1963. In 1955 came his supreme achievement, winning the world championship in New York. In 1961 he won the World Par Olympiad (where the hands are pre-set by an expert panel), and in 1962 added the World Pairs Olympiad. His supreme technique, and the consistency of his results, led many to rank him as the world's finest player.<br>
<br>The 1965 world championships in Buenos Aires witnessed the biggest scandal ever to hit the world of bridge. Reese and Schapiro were accused of exchanging illicit information during the bidding&#151;signalling how many hearts they held by varying their finger positions. The World Bridge Federation judged them to be guilty. The verdict was not accepted in Britain and a full tribunal, headed by Sir John Foster and Lord Bourne, sat intermittently for many months. The visual evidence of finger signalling seemed convincing, but a detailed analysis of the subsequent bids and plays offered no evidence whatsoever that the pair had benefited from the information supposedly gained. Reese and Schapiro were eventually acquitted&#151;a verdict rejected by the World Bridge Federation.<br>
<br>Reese achieved his greatest fame as a writer. Editor of the <span class="italic">British Bridge World</span> magazine from 1955 to 1962, he became the game's most prolific author, producing over ninety titles. He combined exceptional insight into the game with a mastery of the English language. His famous classics, <span class="italic">Reese on Play</span> (1948) and <span class="italic">The Expert Game</span> (1958), dealt with areas of the game that players today still find difficult. He was also bridge correspondent for <span class="italic">The Observer</span>, the <span class="italic">Evening News</span> (later the <span class="italic">Evening Standard</span>) and <span class="italic">The Lady</span>. He made many lifelong friends but not everyone appreciated the way in which he expressed his opinions so openly. His terse book reviews were legendary. He dismissed one new work with: &#145;This writer knows little about bridge, even less about punctuation.&#146; A book entitled <span class="italic">Twelve Lessons on Bridge</span> was treated to: &#145;The author should hasten to take them!&#146; When asked whether he received many letters from readers of his columns, Reese replied: &#145;They're not to be encouraged at any cost. I just return the letter with the odd &#147;yes&#148; or &#147;no&#148; scribbled on it. I rarely receive a second letter from the same source.&#146;<br>
<br>Reese married Alwyn Sherrington (<i>b</i>. 1939/40), a computer trainer's registrar and daughter of Richard Sherrington, builder, on 23 January 1970, and for many years they lived in Woods Mews, off Park Lane in central London. They then moved to a fine Edwardian apartment overlooking the seafront in Hove. At the age of eighty-three, now very deaf, Reese attended the Macallan International Pairs in London. &#145;Why on earth did he hold on to the diamonds?&#146; he exclaimed loudly, after a world champion had misdefended a hand. &#145;It was obvious to keep the clubs.&#146; Two days later, on 29 January 1996, he died at his home, Flat 5, 23 Adelaide Crescent, Hove, Sussex, of aspirin poisoning. An inquest held on 14 February returned a verdict of accidental death. He was survived by his wife.<br>
