<span class="headword">Bagot, Sir  Charles</span>  (1781&#150;1843), <span class="occ">diplomatist and governor-in-chief of British North America</span>, was born on 23 September 1781 at Blithfield Hall, Staffordshire, the second surviving son of William, first Baron Bagot (1728&#150;1798), and Elizabeth Louisa (<i>d</i>. 1820), the eldest daughter of John St John, second Viscount Bolingbroke. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1041/', "William Bagot")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1039/', "Richard Bagot")</script> were his brothers. Bagot was educated at Rugby School and Christ Church, Oxford, and received his BA in 1801 and his MA in 1804. In November 1801 he entered Lincoln's Inn, but he abandoned his legal studies within a year. On 22 July 1806 he married Mary Charlotte Anne Wellesley-Pole (<i>d</i>. 1845), the daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29010/', "William Wellesley-Pole")</script>, the future third earl of Mornington, and a niece of the future duke of Wellington; they had four sons and six daughters.<br>
<br>In June 1807 Bagot entered the House of Commons for Castle Rising, a rotten borough in the gift of his uncle Richard Howard. In August 1807 he became under-secretary for foreign affairs, and formed a close friendship with his superior, George Canning. Later that year he abandoned his parliamentary seat in favour of a sinecure as steward of the Chiltern Hundreds. In October 1809 he followed Canning out of the Foreign Office but in 1814 briefly served as minister-plenipotentiary to France. On 31 July 1815 he became minister-plenipotentiary and special envoy to the United States and on 4 December was appointed to the privy council. In March 1816 he arrived in Washington, where, despite his youth and inexperience, he proved an able diplomat. He enjoyed neither Washington's climate nor its society, but he held his tongue and became popular and respected. He successfully resolved a number of the frictions arising out of the Anglo-American War of 1812&#150;14. His greatest success was an agreement to limit naval forces on the Great Lakes, which was formalized in an exchange of diplomatic notes with the American secretary of state, Richard Rush, in April 1817, and became known as the Rush&#150;Bagot agreement. Bagot was also involved in efforts to settle disputes over American access to the Atlantic fisheries and over the boundary from Lake of the Woods, in the far west of Upper Canada, to the Pacific, both of which were formally resolved by the convention of 1818 which was negotiated in London. Bagot thus helped to create what would eventually be the longest undefended border in the world.<br>
<br>Bagot returned to England in 1819. On 20 May 1820 he was created a GCB and on 23 May was made ambassador to Russia. He found St Petersburg more congenial than Washington, and formed a close and friendly relationship with the tsar, whom he sought to restrain from aggressive actions in Turkey. In 1821 he negotiated an end to Russian efforts to make the north Pacific a closed sea, and he began the negotiations which resulted in the Anglo-Russian treaty of 1825 defining the boundary between Alaska and British North America. In the autumn of 1824 Bagot persuaded Canning to transfer him to The Hague so that he could reduce the heavy expense of maintaining family homes in both London and St Petersburg. Until 1831 he served as ambassador to the Netherlands, and he played a minor part in the negotiations which established the independence of Belgium. In 1828 he declined appointment as governor-general of Bengal, but he was identified with the Conservatives, and the only diplomatic post he held after 1831 was a short mission to Vienna to congratulate Francis I on his accession in 1835.<br>
<br>When the Conservatives returned to power in 1841 Sir Robert Peel and Lord Stanley, the secretary of state for the colonies, persuaded Bagot to become governor-in-chief of British North America (27 September 1841). Bagot was selected partly because it was presumed his appointment would be welcomed in the United States, but also because the Conservatives were concerned to halt the trend towards responsible government in British North America. In the aftermath of the abortive rebellions of 1837, the whigs had accepted Lord Durham's recommendation that Upper and Lower Canada be amalgamated into the united province of Canada, thus placing the French Canadians in a minority, but they had also accepted Durham's recommendation that the colonial government must obtain the consent of the majority in the assembly, thus opening up the possibility that the French-Canadian party might have to be admitted to power on their own terms. Bagot's instructions were to continue the policies of his whig predecessor, Lord Sydenham, and to promote gradual assimilation of the French Canadians while governing through the non-party coalition which Sydenham had constructed in the assembly of the united province. Shortly after arriving at the capital in Kingston, Upper Canada, on 10 January 1842, and taking office two days later, Bagot realized that the non-party coalition was disintegrating and that he would have to conciliate the French-Canadian reformers led by Louis-Hippolyte LaFontaine. Bagot sought to win French-Canadian support by appointing to office a number of French Canadians, including Denis Benjamin Viger, who had been implicated in the rebellion of 1837 and whose appointment to the legislative council Stanley refused to confirm. To Stanley's horror Bagot also reported that many of the measures introduced by Sydenham to accelerate assimilation of the French Canadians were not working and ought to be abandoned and that the large civil list embodied in the <span class="roman">Union Act</span> of 1840 ought to be reduced. Bagot did persuade a moderate reformer, Francis Hincks, to join the executive council, and he opened negotiations with LaFontaine, but he was unable to break the solidarity of the French-Canadian bloc or to undermine their alliance with the English-Canadian reformers led by Robert Baldwin.<br>
<br>When the assembly of the united province met in September 1842 Bagot's conservative ministers could no longer command a majority. Bagot reluctantly accepted their resignations and negotiated an agreement which allowed the Baldwin&#150;LaFontaine coalition to take office on 14 September 1842. He retained several executive councillors not directly identified with any party, but he gradually came to develop a healthy respect for LaFontaine and Baldwin, and, as his health deteriorated, the reformers dictated policy and controlled patronage. As Bagot admitted, the principle of responsible government which the British government had previously refused to acknowledge had in effect been conceded and the policy of assimilating the French Canadians abandoned. Bagot's actions not only earned him the animosity of Canadian Conservatives, but created consternation in London, where Peel, Stanley, and Prince Albert had all made clear their opposition to a surrender of the prerogative to the Canadian reformers whose loyalty to the crown and the imperial connection seemed suspect. When Bagot submitted his resignation late in 1842 because of poor health, the Conservatives enthusiastically accepted it and appointed as his successor Sir Charles Metcalfe in the hope that he could undo the harm they felt Bagot had done.<br>
<br>When Bagot died in Kingston on 19 May 1843, after having been replaced by Metcalfe as governor on 30 March that year, reformers throughout the united province of Canada mourned his death. His body was transferred to England for burial. It was his short Canadian administration which established his reputation: in fact, Bagot's actions may well have saved the imperial connection, for they helped to convince the reformers, particularly the French-Canadian reformers, that they could achieve their goals through constitutional means, and he had established the principle of responsible government so firmly that there was no going back. Bagot was not as able a politician as his predecessor in Canada, Lord Sydenham, nor as capable an administrator as his successor, Sir Charles Metcalfe. He owed the series of offices he held to his family connections and to influential friends, and he was deeply conservative, if not reactionary, in his political views. But he was a capable diplomat, who happened to be placed in Canada at precisely the moment when diplomatic skill was required. Bagot did not go to Canada to introduce a new political system. Initially he did everything he could to avoid surrendering power to the reformers. But in the end he was shrewd enough to make a virtue of necessity, thus earning a permanent place in the pantheon of great imperial statesmen.<br>
