<span class="headword">Quilter, Sir  William Cuthbert</span>, first baronet  (1841&#150;1911), <span class="occ">art collector and politician</span>, was born at South Audley Place, London, on 29 January 1841, the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/48129/', "William Quilter (1808&#150;1888)")</script>, the first president of the Institute of Accountants and a prominent art collector, and his wife, Elizabeth Harriot Cuthbert (<i>d</i>. 1874), and brother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35641/', "Harry Quilter (1851&#150;1907)")</script>, an art critic. Following his private education, Quilter spent five years (1858&#150;63) working for his father's accountancy business. He married Mary Ann, daughter of John Wheeley Bevington of Brighton, on 7 May 1867. Together they had five sons and two daughters. After working for his father, Quilter started his own business, eventually founded as the firm Quilter, Balfour &amp; Co. in 1885. He was one of the founding directors of the National Telephone Company (registered on 10 March 1881) and continued as a director and large shareholder for the remainder of his life. In 1883 Quilter purchased the Bawdsey estate near Felixstowe in Suffolk. He spent vast sums of money on the estate, which totalled 9000 acres, in the form of sea defences, a manor house, and an alpine garden. He was an agriculturist and was particularly adept at cattle breeding. Quilter, an enthusiastic yachtsman, owned a number of famous boats, including the 40 ton cutter <i>Britannia</i>, and was vice-commodore of the Royal Harwich Yacht Club from 1875 to 1909. He was also president of the Suffolk Horse Society. In December 1885 Quilter was elected as the Liberal Party member of parliament for Sudbury. He was re-elected as a Liberal Unionist in 1886 and continued as a representative of his constituency until he was defeated at the beginning of 1906. He rarely spoke in the House of Commons. Quilter was made a baronet on 13 September 1897. He was also a justice of the peace and a deputy lieutenant for Suffolk, as well as an alderman of the West Suffolk county council.<br>
<br>Quilter shared his father's interest in art collecting, although he cultivated his own unique, albeit catholic, taste. His collection included works by modern English artists, such as the Pre-Raphaelite painters D. G. Rossetti, Millais, and Holman Hunt; Royal Academicians including Sir Frederic Leighton, Sir Edwin Landseer, and Sir Hubert von Herkomer; nineteenth-century French masters, for example Corot, Daubigny, and Millet; and old masters such as Frans Hals and Vel&aacute;zquez. His collection was well respected. The art critic F. G. Stephens praised Quilter's collection in a series of articles written for <span class="italic">Cassell's Magazine of Art</span> in 1896&#150;7, wherein he claimed it &#145;possesses a number of modern masterpieces the merits of which form a whole inferior to none in England&#146;  (Stephens, 121). In his reminiscences the artist William Rothenstein made note of the opportunity afforded him to view Quilter's collection. Quilter was generous in loaning his acquisitions to public exhibitions; he lent Sir Joshua Reynolds's <span class="italic">Nymph</span> and <span class="italic">Piping Boy</span> (Tate Collection) and Hals's <span class="italic">Pieter Tjarck</span> to the Royal Academy's winter exhibition in 1891. The whole of his collection was displayed at Lawrie's Galleries, Bond Street, in 1902 in aid of King Edward's Hospital Fund for London. He presented Herkomer's portrait of Spencer Compton Cavendish, eighth duke of Devonshire, to the National Portrait Gallery in 1909. Quilter's assemblage of paintings at his London house, 28 South Street, Park Lane, was sold at Christies on 9 July 1909, realizing &pound;87,780. He died suddenly at Bawdsey Manor on 18 November 1911 and was buried in the parish churchyard.<br>
