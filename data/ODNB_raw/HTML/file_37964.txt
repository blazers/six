<span class="headword">Sims,  George Robert</span>  (1847&#150;1922), <span class="occ">journalist and writer</span>, was born on 2 September 1847 at 8 Newton Terrace, Kennington, London, the eldest among the six children of George Sims and his wife, Louisa Amelia Ann Stevenson (<i>bap</i>. 1823). Sims's paternal grandfather was a friend of the scientist Michael Faraday (they were fellow Sandemanians), and his maternal grandfather was a Chartist. In different facets of his life Sims reflected both traditions, though an indulgent sense of fun and panache often made him appear trivial. His father, a wine merchant, became &#145;a wholesale and export cabinet manufacturer and plate-glass factor&#146;  (Sims, <span class="italic">Life</span>, 31&#150;2) in Aldersgate Street in the City. His mother was president of the Women's Provident League. Sims grew up in comfortable circumstances in Hamilton Terrace, Islington. His parents entertained a cosmopolitan circle, including the political refugee Karl Blind, the art historian George Zerffi, the theosophist Anna Kingsford, the poet Augusta Webster, Samuel Butler, and the suffragists Frances Power Cobbe and Lydia Becker. This earnestness did not outlaw amusement: from six, Sims accompanied his mother to theatres.<h2>
<a name="Journalismandsocialconcern"></a>Journalism and social concern</h2>After preparatory schooling in Eastbourne, followed by Hanwell College, a crammer for army cadets, Sims was dispatched to France and Germany to complete his education. He was recalled after developing a &#145;pronounced partiality for the roulette-tables of Ems and Wiesbaden&#146;  (Sims, <span class="italic">Limelight</span>, 157). He acquired some linguistic fluency, however. At Bonn he dabbled in play writing, adapting Benedix's comedy <span class="italic">Dr Wespe</span>; and in 1874 Chatto and Windus published his translation of Balzac's <span class="italic">Contes dr&ocirc;latiques</span>. This offended the strait-laced and was withdrawn, until reissued in 1903. Back home, he entered his father's office, but was not cut out for ordinary business. In the firm's time he scribbled stories and verse. <span class="italic">Fun</span> began accepting his copy in 1874; among fellow contributors were W. S. Gilbert and Ambrose Bierce, with whom Sims became friendly  (Nash, 112&#150;14). On 3 October 1876 while living in London at 24 Addington Square, Camberwell, Sims married Sarah Elizabeth Collis (<i>b</i>. 1850/51).<br>
<br>Sims's satire strayed into the libellous in 1876. His open letter &#145;To a Fashionable Tragedian&#146;, while comically charging Henry Irving with inciting mass murder by overdoing the gore in his stage Shakespeare, unwisely accused the actor&#150;manager of bribing hacks to flatter his performances. This landed Sims and his editor Harry Sampson in court. They apologized and Irving withdrew the suit. In 1877 Sampson started a Sunday sports and entertainments paper, <span class="italic">Referee</span>. Sims wrote its &#145;Mustard and Cress&#146; columns under the pen-name Dagonet. So successful was Sims's miscellany&#151;particularly the verses which, collated as <span class="italic">The Dagonet Ballads</span> (1879) and <span class="italic">Ballads of Babylon</span> (1880), sold in hundreds of thousands and were reprinted over the next thirty years&#151;that <span class="italic">Punch</span> sought to poach him. Dagonet's droll travelogues were also popular, but the literati thought Sims facile. In 1892 the <span class="italic">National Observer</span>, mouthpiece of the manly imperialist coterie led by W. E. Henley, sardonically nominated Sims to succeed Tennyson as laureate. More obvious in its attack was Charles Whibley's profile of Sims in the paper's &#145;Modern man&#146; series in 1889, which even Henley&#151;who normally did not flinch when applying the lash&#151;thought &#145;a trifle acid&#146;  (Connell, 167, 258). Sims fared no better in the estimation of Wildean aesthetes, whose patronizing contempt was echoed in Robert Hichens's spoof <span class="italic">The Green Carnation</span> (1894).<br>
<br>A solitary line from <span class="italic">The Dagonet Ballads</span> nevertheless ensured Sims entry into practically every dictionary of quotations: &#145;It is Christmas Day in the workhouse&#146;. Its sentimentality and social concern struck a chord and betokened Sims's crusading zeal. The characteristics that coloured his literary confections now enlisted public support for his campaigning, especially an eye for that graphic and pathetic detail which dramatized the plight of the suffering victim. Not just evident sympathy but omnipresent wit and reasonableness spared Sims's ethical scorn and solemn warnings from seeming humbug. His articles in the <span class="italic">Sunday Dispatch</span>, <span class="italic">Pictorial World</span>, and <span class="italic">Daily News</span> in 1879&#150;83&#151;&#145;The social kaleidoscope&#146;, &#145;The three brass balls&#146;, &#145;The theatre of life&#146;, &#145;How the poor live&#146;, and &#145;Horrible London&#146; (all later published in book form)&#151;derived from observation of London's slums. The burgeoning debate about landlord&#150;tenant relations and the role of public authorities further involved Sims as a member of an inquiry into social conditions in Southwark in 1882 and as a witness before the royal commission on working-class housing in 1884. He also campaigned against the white slave traffic in articles in the <span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span> (published as <span class="italic">London by Night</span>, 1906, and <span class="italic">Watches of the Night</span>, 1907); and he was active in the National Sunday League, seeking to dispel sabbatarian gloom by opening museums and galleries and providing concerts. He also wrote tracts against the maltreatment of children, such as <span class="italic">The Black Stain</span> (1907); he abetted the boys' clubs movement and, with Mrs E. W. Burgwin, headmistress of a Southwark board school, he founded the <span class="italic">Referee</span> Children's Free Breakfast and Dinner Fund (1880), which by 1900 was generating &pound;4000 a year. It was the capital's largest such charity, whose work anticipated the public provision of free school meals for necessitous children in 1906.<br>
<br>Sims's fascination with London's variety merits for him a place alongside Henry Mayhew, Walter Besant, and Charles Booth. His <span class="italic">Living London</span>, published by Cassell in thirty-six parts, and as a three-decker book in 1901&#150;3, has been too little regarded. Probably it was his &#145;Bitter cry of the middle classes&#146; campaign in <span class="italic">The Tribune</span> in 1906 that forfeited him the goodwill of progressives, for he argued that the clerk, the small independent tradesman, and others of the straitened lower-middle classes were the over-taxed casualties of a new social order which enthroned organized labour, big business, and statism.<h2>
<a name="Populardramatist"></a>Popular dramatist</h2>That Sims's campaigning involved sensationalism is unsurprising, because this quality made him a star writer of melodrama, burlesque, pantomime, and comic opera. For <span class="italic">Who's Who</span> he recited some twenty-eight titles of which he was author or part-author. Mostly adapted from continental stock or following formulas, they were of doubtful originality. Sims did not even bother to list his first hit, <span class="italic">Crutch and Toothpick</span>, modelled on a French farce, which opened at the Royalty on Easter Monday 1879 and ran for 240 nights. Rightly he began his credits with <span class="italic">The Lights o' London</span>, which Wilson Barrett produced at the Princess's on 10 September 1881. It stayed for 286 nights, then took hold in the provinces and earned record receipts in America. By 1916, when it was being staged in Copenhagen, it had been playing somewhere in the world non-stop for thirty-five years. <span class="italic">Romany Rye</span>, which opened at the Princess's on 10 June 1882, was a similar box-office smash. J. M. Barrie and Somerset Maugham are usually credited with the feat of having four plays running concurrently in West End theatres; but it was Sims who first achieved that in the early 1880s&#151;with, additionally, a dozen touring companies performing his work. His play-writing collaborators were numerous (Wilson Barrett, Sydney Grundy, Clement Scott, and Arthur Shirley), and his union with Henry Pettitt was particularly profitable, starting with <span class="italic">In the Ranks</span>, which opened on 6 October 1883 and ran for 457 nights at the Adelphi; it was followed by <span class="italic">The Harbour Lights</span>, which played there for eighteen months from 23 December 1885. Their <span class="italic">Faust Up-To-Date</span>, scored by the Gaiety's musical director Meyer L&uuml;tz, was the rage for several years after opening on 30 October 1888; and it inaugurated a new meaning of &#145;up-to-date&#146; in the language, that of being &#145;abreast of the time in respect of qualities of style, knowledge, presentation of facts&#146;  (<span class="italic">Oxford English Dictionary</span>).<br>
<br>Sims's craftsmanship should not be disparaged. Writing in the <span class="italic">Contemporary Review</span> in November 1891 D. Christie Murray expected great things of Sims in what he considered to be a new epoch in the theatre, alongside Arthur Pinero and Robert Buchanan. The latter collaborated with Sims to write five Adelphi melodramas. Typical was <span class="italic">The Trumpet Call</span>; its plot, mused <span class="italic">The Globe</span>'s reviewer, advanced from improbability to impossibility. Mrs Patrick Campbell (1865&#150;1940) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32261/', "Campbell, Beatrice Stella")</script>] played the tempestuous Gypsy villainness. This was before she established her credentials with intellectuals by her title role in <span class="italic">The Second Mrs Tanqueray</span>. <span class="italic">The Trumpet Call</span> gave her a different sort of fame when one night her costume collapsed and she was exposed in her drawers. This perhaps extended the play's run. Moreover, Sims and Mrs Campbell became lovers, but Sims's ardour persisted after hers cooled. She accused him of parading her as a trophy &#145;fruit of his labour for his fellow men to envy&#146;  (Peters, 92).<h2>
<a name="Legalreformandlaterlife"></a>Legal reform and later life</h2>On 17 March 1888, as a widower, Sims had married Annie Maria Harriss (<i>b</i>. 1859/60). On 15 August 1901, again a widower, he married Elizabeth Florence Wykes (<i>b</i>. 1873/4). There were no children from any marriage, and all three ceremonies were held in register offices. Sims's parents were Anglicans, but his religious life appears to have been void. From the early 1890s his home was 12 Clarence Terrace, Regent's Park, London, the address of a man who had made it; and he cut a figure in the royal parks driving his trotting ponies. Attending sporting events was a passion, horse-racing and boxing matches especially. Sims exercised at badminton and by strenuous walks; as a patriot he bred prize-winning bulldogs. The Devonshire ranked foremost among his clubs, though he incurred members' jibes when his marketing of a hair-restorer, Tatcho, supposedly a miracle cure of his own invention, failed to defeat his advancing baldness. What profit he gained from this unorthodox enterprise, wedded to his vast literary earnings, is not known, but his income approached &pound;150,000 in 1898. That he left only &pound;7111 at his death was probably due to his admitted gambling, a recklessness he shared with Buchanan who, despite their money-spinning play writing partnership, died bankrupt. Sims died at 12 Clarence Terrace on 4 September 1922 from cancer of the liver; his third wife outlived him.<br>
<br>Sims's ideal was to win &#145;the admiration of the literary school of critics without sacrificing the commercial approval of the general public&#146;  (Sims, <span class="italic">Limelight</span>, 57&#150;9); but, forced to choose, he preferred instant cash and popularity to critical reputation or literary immortality. That Sims's sketches and verses, plays and pantomimes added to the sum of human happiness in his day is plain. Unexpectedly, it is in the history of legal reform that Sims found an enduring place. Intrigued by the psychology of crime for the social pathologies it revealed, as well as for its fictional possibilities&#151;he wrote ingenious detective stories, one, <span class="italic">Dorcas Dene</span> (1897), involving a pioneering woman detective&#151;Sims enjoyed discussing cases with Conan Doyle, Max Pemberton, and Churton Collins at Arthur Lambton's Crimes Club. He became so wrapped up in the Whitechapel murders that some suspected him of being Jack the Ripper. More pleasingly, it was his campaign, fought through the <span class="italic">Daily Mail</span>, to release, pardon, and compensate a Norwegian, Adolf Beck, twice imprisoned owing to mistaken identity, that helped to get the court of criminal appeal established in 1907. His dedication was recognized in a knighthood of the order of St Olaf, first class, awarded by the king of Sweden and Norway in 1905.<br>
<br>Sims never received a native honour. His literary output was too prolific and ephemeral, and his social crusading, while spirited and arresting, was spread across too many causes. Yet he possessed uncommon flair and imagination, together with curiosity and concern about people. Sims prompted some indecision when selections were being made in 1934 for inclusion in the <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span> supplement. &#145;G. R. Sims I find we rejected, reconsidered, and again rejected&#146;, the secretary to the press R. W. Chapman told the essayist E. V. Lucas on 1 August:<blockquote>Do you say that this was wrong, and if so do you want to write a short life of him, (in which I am afraid you must not identify him with Jack the Ripper), or will you very kindly suggest a writer? I have always been very vague about the importance of G.R.S. (Oxford University Press archives, PB/ED/12916/OP1722)</blockquote>Presumably Lucas was vague too because it was not until <span class="italic">Missing Persons</span> (1993) that Sims became securely lodged in the public memory.<br>
