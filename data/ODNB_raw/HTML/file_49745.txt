<span class="headword">Boyd, Sir  John</span>, first baronet  (1718&#150;1800), <span class="occ">merchant</span>, was born on 29 December 1718 on St Kitts in the Leeward Islands, the only child of Augustus Boyd (1679&#150;1765) and Lucy, daughter of Judge John Peters and Elizabeth Henderson. Augustus Boyd was a native of northern Ireland who, about 1700, left co. Donegal for St Kitts, the home of a maternal uncle. There he purchased and managed several sugar estates, and established a business supplying European goods to planters. Failing to win a seat on the St Kitts council, he moved to London and established a trade with eastern Caribbean planters. In 1735 Augustus Boyd took lodgings with his brother-in-law, James Pechell of Broad Street. There, as Pechell's partner, he immersed himself in commission merchandising.<br>
<br>John Boyd, however, expressed little interest in overseas trade. Soon after the family's arrival in London, he enrolled at Christ Church, Oxford, in 1737, to read classics. Only after completing his studies and touring the continent did he reluctantly return to the counting-house. In 1749 he married Mary Bumstead, the daughter of a prominent Warwickshire landowner. He subsequently acquired the lease to a 304 acre estate named Danson Hill in north-west Kent to accommodate their growing brood. After purchasing the freehold in 1759, he employed William Chambers to design a new Palladian villa.<br>
<br>In national politics Boyd cut a low profile, opting to petition and inform parliament rather than enter its ranks as a member. He commented on the taking of British ships by the Spanish and the protection of mercantile interests in the Tortola trade. At most times he was an ardent supporter of the king, the administration, and their efforts to expand and defend the empire. Characteristically, he endorsed George II's war against France in the late 1750s, and embraced George III's peace in 1763. Boyd was a stronger presence in company politics. In April 1753 he was elected a director of the East India Company, and he served on its court until 1764. In Leadenhall Street he took an active part in Indian affairs. He was a member of nine different committees, attended them regularly, and served as the company's deputy chairman in 1759&#150;60. During the 1760s he allied himself with Laurence Sulivan. In 1763, for instance, he created ten new votes for Sulivan's consortium by splitting larger shareholdings into &pound;500 lots, each of which entitled its holder to a vote, and, in the following year, successfully ran as one of Sulivan's supporters. He supported Sulivan's stand on the appointment of John Spencer as the company's president in Bengal, complained about the extraordinary powers given to Clive's select committee in Bengal, and resigned when Sulivan failed to secure the chairmanship. In April 1765, and again the following year, Sulivan placed Boyd on his list of approved candidates, but the support proved costly, and Boyd lost. Frustrated with the directors and aggrieved by the unwillingness of those he had helped to repay him, Boyd retired from the company.<br>
<br>More personal matters now came to the fore. Boyd's first wife having died in March 1763, he had assumed the charge of the upbringing of his children. Although he married Catherine Chapone (<i>d</i>. 1813) on 1 August 1766 and raised three children with her, they never replaced his first wife and children in his affections. After the death of his father, Boyd passed to his son-in-law John Trevanion and William Wood the management of the family's trading business, and himself turned to more congenial pursuits. As befitted a man who had risen above the world of the counting-house, he broadened his sights. In late 1772 he visited Spain, France, Belgium, and the Netherlands, he learned new languages, and he purchased works of art for his villa. George III created him a baronet in 1775 and more significant travel and collecting followed in 1775 and 1776. Despite such honours and pleasures, however, his life was not untroubled. Chief among his concerns were the Caribbean plantations he inherited from his father and grandmother. Always a drain on time, energy, and money, these estates ran him aground in the 1770s. Early in the decade, political intrigues swept the island; a hurricane destroyed many of his buildings, and fire destroyed much of what remained. The capture of the island by the French in 1779 eventually stopped the flow of all proceeds. On account of such tribulations, his finances fell into disarray. In 1771, desperately needing money to manage his affairs, he turned for immediate relief to Richard Oswald, a partner in a Sierra Leone slave trans-shipment factory, but the loan did little to solve his long-term financial problems, which were complicated by the bankruptcies of several merchants who owed him substantial amounts of money. Gloom shadowed him, professionally and personally, and he began to see everything in the blackest colours. The deaths of loved ones crushed his spirit: his son Augustus died in 1772, and his favourite, Mary Jane, in 1779. Relations with those who survived became increasingly strained. He withdrew entirely from London society, and spent most of his time at Danson, hidden away in one wing of the mansion. He spoke in monosyllables. He constantly wept. Only the arrival of Paul Benfield, a clerk in his office who had gone out to India and made a fortune, and Benfield's loan of &pound;90,000 in 1779 steadied Boyd's affairs.<br>
<br>By the end of the American War of Independence Boyd had repaid his debts, but by that time he had lost all taste for business or society. He retired to the country and lived in virtual isolation with his wife, daughters, and servants. He turned inward, focusing on religious subjects and good deeds and administering local charities. But the philanthropies did not ease his mind, and he died, plagued by fear and loneliness, on 24 January 1800 at Danson Hill, where he was buried. To his second wife he left an annuity of &pound;1200, &pound;3000 cash, and his personal effects. His daughters received generous annuities and legacies. The residue of the estate went to his son John (1715&#150;1815), who subsequently auctioned off the extensive collection of paintings and drawings.<br>
