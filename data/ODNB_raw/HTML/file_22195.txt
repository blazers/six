<span class="headword">Free <span class="st"> [Fre, Freas]</span>,  John</span>  (<em>c.</em>1430&#150;1464/5), <span class="occ">humanist scholar</span>, spelled his name Fre or Free; it was Latinized in the fifteenth century to Frea(s), and in the early sixteenth to Phrea(s). His birthplace was Bristol according to William Worcester, who seems to have known him personally, or London according to John Burton, fellow of Balliol <i>c</i>.1467, and he may have had his schooling in either city. Free probably went up to Balliol College, Oxford, in 1445, since his supplication for BA in December 1448 specifies that he had studied three years there. Admitted in June 1449 and determined in 1450, he was dispensed in June 1453 and incorporated MA on 11 April 1454. On 21 March 1450 Free had been ordained acolyte at St Frideswide's Priory, Oxford; he was in priest's orders not later than 1456; and in April 1459 was admitted <i>in absentia</i> rector of Kelshall, Hertfordshire. In May, as clerk in the diocese of Bath and Wells and holder of benefices in the dioceses of Ely and Lincoln, he was granted extraordinary papal dispensation to hold supplementary benefices; and in July 1464 admitted by proxy rector of St Michael-in-Monte, Bristol.<br>
<br>By March 1450 Free was a fellow of Balliol. In autumn 1456 he left Oxford for study in Italy at the expense of William Gray, bishop of Ely. Like Gray, he went to Guarino da Verona, at Ferrara, where he was already on 22 October 1456. Free is one of five English pupils commended by name in Lodovico Carbone's funeral oration on Guarino, the others being Gray, John Gunthorpe, Robert Flemming, and John Tiptoft, earl of Worcester. Assimilating Guarino's methods of study and composition, Free began to write the new humanist hand, and to learn Greek, as Guarino encouraged his students to do. Evidence for Free's supposed Hebrew studies is negligible. Among his humanist friends and correspondents from Ferrara were Girolamo Castiglione, Carbone, and the Hungarian Janus Pannonius.<br>
<br>Free had been provided with money by Gray on setting out, and Gray had promised more; a year later this had not arrived and Free had to pawn books and clothes. Gray was then indulgent enough for Free, in autumn 1458, to ask for an extra sum to buy Greek books, which he could begin to translate. Some time after this he passed to Padua, where he still was in early 1461, being styled <i>doctor artium</i> in a university document of 22 March. There he became friends with Ognibene da Lonigo and the Greek Andronico Callisto. The presentation manuscript of his last surviving work  (Vatican City, Biblioteca Apostolica Vaticana, MS Vat. lat. 3713) makes him MD; Worcester and John Leland credit him with the degree of DCL in addition.<br>
<br>At Padua, Free probably first encountered Tiptoft; certainly their time there coincided. For Tiptoft he seems to have acted as secretary, making transcripts himself and probably commissioning others to do so, as well as advising the earl in acquiring books even after Tiptoft's return to England, and perhaps aiding Tiptoft in composition. He made corrections, additions (sometimes in Greek), and annotations in some of Tiptoft's manuscripts. Copies made by Free for Tiptoft of Tacitus's <span class="italic">De oratoribus</span> and Suetonius's <span class="italic">De grammaticis</span>  (BL, Harley MS 2639) are most likely the first manuscripts of these texts to have reached England in post-classical times. His Latin poems, dedicated to Tiptoft, are now lost. Free's best-known work, his Latin translation of Synesius of Cyrene's <span class="italic">Laus calvitii</span> (&#145;A praise of baldness&#146;), completed by 9 July 1461, was also dedicated to Tiptoft. A handsome manuscript, with the prefaces of Ognibene and Free himself, illuminated in the contemporary Paduan style and bearing the arms of Thomas Beckington, bishop of Bath and Wells, has corrections in Free's hand  (Bodl. Oxf., 80). Beatus Rhenanus praised Free's translation and included it, with his own commentary, in editions of Erasmus's <span class="italic">Praise of Folly</span> (Basel, Froben, 1515&#150;32); the first English translation, by Abraham Fleming in 1579, used both Free's version and the commentary.<br>
<br>Free's copies of late antique grammatical pieces discovered in 1433, his notes from Guarino's lectures on Virgil's <span class="italic">Georgics</span> and other ancient texts, and drafts of his letters to Gray and his chaplain Elias Cliderow, Pannonius, Guarino, and others (1456&#150;8) are preserved in &#145;Free's Notebook&#146;, a codex later also used by Gunthorpe  (Bodl. Oxf., 587). Others of his notes are in a manuscript later in Worcester's possession; his excerpts from Pliny's <span class="italic">Natural History</span> and the copy he made of Poggio Bracciolini's Latin <span class="italic">Diodorus Siculus</span>, attributed to Free by Worcester, its later owner, and initially by Leland, also survive  (Balliol Oxf., MS 124). A miscellany volume of Greek tragic and other poetry, also once owned by Worcester, has annotations by Free  (Bodl. Oxf., Auct. F. 3. 25). Others of Free's books passed to Gunthorpe, who was in Italy when Free died.<br>
<br>The date and place of Free's death are not precisely documented. Leland writes that he had been in Florence and in Rome and reports a rumour that he was poisoned by a rival. The only evidence for Free's death in Rome is the sole surviving manuscript of his second Latin translation from Synesius's <span class="italic">De insomniis</span> (&#145;On dreams&#146;), dedicated to Pope Paul II (elected 30 August 1464), presumably in the hope of patronage  (MS Vat. lat. 3713). The presentation manuscript is in Free's autograph, with decorated initials in the contemporary Roman style; Free was therefore alive in late summer 1464. Worcester's report that he was provided by the pope to the see of Bath and Wells but died within the month is repeated by Leland; the provision is not in the papal registers. If Free was so favoured, he must have died after the death of Beckington on 14 January 1465 and before the provision of Robert Stillington on 30 October 1465.<br>
<br>Free was the first Englishman to make himself a professional humanist on the Italian Renaissance model. Though not to be compared with the best of his Italian contemporaries, he was outstanding in the generation before that of Grocyn and Linacre as Latin stylist, Greek scholar, and translator. The circumstances of his life&#151;he had not, as Leland believed, enriched himself by medical practice&#151;and his death out of England, however, made him less directly influential in Oxford and on English humanists than his contemporaries Flemming and perhaps even Gunthorpe.<br>
