<span class="headword">King,  Robert</span>, second Baron Kingston  (<em>c.</em>1660&#150;1693), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15571/', "John King, first Baron Kingston (d. 1676)")</script>, parliamentarian soldier and owner of large estates in Ireland, and his wife, Catharine (<i>d</i>. 1669), daughter of Sir William Fenton of Mitchelstown, co. Cork. He was trained to a military career, receiving a cornet's commission in his father's cavalry regiment in 1663, while still an infant. Brought up on the family estate at Boyle Abbey, co. Roscommon, he was educated by a private tutor.<br>
<br>Kingston purchased a captain's commission in the duke of Ormond's cavalry regiment in 1684 and within two years was the regiment's colonel. He was deprived of his post in 1687 during Tyrconnell's purge of protestant officers from the Irish army. On the eve of civil war he left his estate in Boyle and travelled to Sligo, where on 4 January 1689 he and Captain Chidley Coote were elected joint commanders of the forces in the county by the protestant association of Sligo. Kingston garrisoned the town, improved its defences, and garrisoned posts on the borders with Mayo and Roscommon to prevent incursions by Irish raiders, against whom he was active in a series of skirmishes. On 7 March, Tyrconnell issued a proclamation in Dublin offering a free pardon to all those who laid down their arms, but specifically excluded Kingston and nine others as being &#145;principal actors in the rebellion&#146; who were &#145;not deserving of His Majesty's mercy or favour&#146;  (Leslie, 22).<br>
<br>Kingston received several messages from Robert Lundy, the governor of Londonderry, urging him to leave Sligo so that the protestant forces might be consolidated. He abandoned Sligo to the Irish on 22 March and led his troops and the whole protestant population to Ballyshannon, which was then held and fortified by his cousin Henry Folliot. On 14 April, Kingston received an order from Lundy to join forces with him, by which time King James's Irish army had got between him and Londonderry. Unable either to return to Sligo, which was then occupied by the Irish, or to reach Lundy, Kingston instructed his men to join the garrisons at Enniskillen, Ballyshannon, and Donegal. With some of his officers he seized two French smacks at Killybegs, from where he sailed to get help. He arrived in Scotland after a hazardous seven-day crossing, having left all his possessions behind &#145;but some plate&#146;.<br>
<br>While in England, Kingston was attainted by the Dublin parliament and his lands were sequestered. In October 1689 he was chosen by other Irish exiles to sit on a committee to address the king in parliament and make proposals for the settlement of Ireland. On 17 February 1690 he married Margaret Harbord (<i>d</i>. 1698), a daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/12233/', "William Harbord (d. 1692)")</script>, the vice-treasurer of Ireland. In London he wrote an account of his actions in Sligo, which was published in Mackenzie's <span class="italic">Narrative of the Siege of London-Derry</span> (1690). After the war his property was restored to him and he took his seat in the Irish parliament of 1692. He died in December 1693 leaving no children. By his will he demised all his property either to charitable purposes or to his cousins in an attempt to prevent his lands from passing to his brother John, the third baron (1664&#150;1728), who had married Margaret O'Cahan, a Catholic who had been a servant in his father's house. After fifteen years of litigation, his brother succeeded to most of the estates in 1708.<br>
