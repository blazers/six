<span class="headword">Reed, Sir  Andrew</span>  (1837&#150;1914), <span class="occ">police officer</span>, was born in Galway town, Ireland, on 26 September 1837, the only son and third of the four children (the others of whom died in childhood or adolescence) of John Reed, land agent, and his wife, Mary, daughter of John Adamson of Moate, co. Westmeath. His mother died when he was three and in 1847 his father remarried. He was brought up partly by his father's family, many of whom were Roman Catholics, and for a time was fostered among Irish-speaking peasants. He attended dame-school and Erasmus Smith's school in Galway, and at sixteen he was earning his living as a tutor. In 1856 he won a science scholarship, which enabled him to enter Queen's College, Galway, from which he obtained an LLB.<br>
<br>In 1859 Reed passed the examination for entry into the Royal Irish Constabulary (RIC) as an officer cadet and went to Dublin to train at the force's depot in Phoenix Park. After four months he was appointed a sub-inspector in north co. Tipperary. But his district was rather too quiet for his taste and in 1862 he obtained a transfer to co. Donegal. The rugged west coast of Donegal was a favourite haunt of illicit distillers and he spent an adventurous four years in pursuit of them. In 1866 he was transferred to co. Kilkenny and then in 1867 to Belfast. In the latter year he married Elizabeth Mary (<i>d</i>. 1913), only daughter of Hamilton Lyster of Croghan House, near Birr, King's county. They had one son and three daughters.<br>
<br>Reed's stay in Belfast was brief, for, late in 1868, he was invited by Colonel John Stewart Wood, the inspector-general of the RIC, to become his private secretary in Dublin. He filled this position for eleven years, first under Wood, and then from 1876 under his successor, Lieutenant-Colonel George Hillier. During these years he found time to study law and, when in 1873 he was called to the Irish bar, he contemplated retiring from the RIC to practise law. But Wood dissuaded him. At Wood's request, Reed also substantially revised the RIC manual, first issued in 1866, and produced his own <span class="italic">Irish Constable's Guide</span>, which was to become the Irish policeman's bible. In 1874, prompted by his commitment to temperance, he published what became a standard text on <span class="italic">The Liquor Licensing Laws of Ireland</span>.<br>
<br>In 1879 Reed passed the examination for county inspector and was appointed to Donegal, with his headquarters in Letterkenny. This gave him &#145;the greatest delight&#146;, he later wrote, as he was tired of the job of clerk and &#145;longed &hellip; for the pleasant outdoor life, and the variety in work, of an Irish police officer&#146;  (Reed, 3). But, with the spread of the land war to Donegal in 1880, he found himself with the far from agreeable duty of providing police protection at numerous evictions. As the land agitation escalated he was recalled to Dublin in June 1881 and put in charge of the RIC's crime division, with the task of combating politically inspired crime. He was thus closely involved in investigating many of the controversial crimes of the period. By his own reckoning, from June 1881 to November 1882, he was only absent from his office for one day. When Hillier's health broke down in 1882 owing to the strain of work, he was appointed assistant inspector-general, and in 1884 he became one of the country's four new divisional magistrates, based in Athlone.<br>
<br>In August 1885 Reed was offered the inspector-generalship of the RIC. He was initially reluctant to accept, fearing charges of anti-Catholic bias because his appointment would leapfrog the claims of seniority of the Catholic deputy inspector-general. He agreed, however, when told that an outsider would be sought if he refused the appointment. He served in the position until his retirement in August 1900, the year he was appointed CVO. He was knighted in 1889 and appointed KCB in 1897.<br>
<br>Although these years were not as difficult as those of the land war, the so-called Plan of Campaign, directed against selected landlords between 1886 and 1891, produced a number of serious clashes between the RIC and protesting tenants. Reed also took personal charge of the RIC in Belfast during the riots of August and September 1886, the worst of the century, which he later described as the &#145;most arduous&#146; duty of his whole police career.<br>
<br>Reed was the only inspector-general without a military background; the only one to rise through the ranks from a cadetship; and the only one with academic and legal training. He thus placed less emphasis on military drill and the use of firearms and more on the mastering of the legal and technical aspects of police duties. His attempts to turn RIC men from soldiers into policemen may have been appropriate in the largely peaceful Ireland of the mid- and late 1890s, but when the RIC was called upon in 1919 to resume its military character in order to defeat the IRA, it proved unequal to the task.<br>
<br>Reed died at his home 5 Dartmouth Road, Dublin, on 7 November 1914, having spent much of his retirement travelling in Europe and America. His son Captain Hamilton Lyster Reed, of the Royal Artillery, won the VC at the battle of Colenso in 1899.<br>
