<span class="headword">Harris, Sir  Ronald Montague Joseph</span>  (1913&#150;1995), <span class="occ">civil servant</span>, was born on 6 May 1913 at 41 Cornwall Gardens, Kensington, London, the only son and the youngest of the three children of the Revd (Joseph) Montague Harris (1864&#150;1964), a Church of England clergyman, and his wife, Edith Annesley, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Malcolmson (1874&#150;1957), the fourth daughter of George Forbes Malcolmson, merchant and banker. Through his maternal grandmother he was descended from King Edward I. His father was rector of St Nicholas's Church, Colchester, from 1913 to 1928.<br>
<br>After his education at West Downs School, Winchester (1922&#150;6), at Harrow School (1926&#150;32), and at Trinity College, Oxford (1933&#150;6), to which he won a scholarship and from which he graduated with first-class honours in modern history, Harris passed into the administrative class of the civil service in 1936. His first appointment, at the India Office, was in the department dealing with the affairs of Burma, and when in 1937 the office of secretary of state for Burma (held in plurality with that of secretary of state for India) was created, he was one of the six staff serving that office. On 14 January 1939 he married (Margaret) Julia Wharton (1914/15&#150;1955), the daughter of John Robert Wharton, an engineer, of Haffield, Ledbury, Herefordshire; they had three daughters and a son.<br>
<br>Also in January 1939 Harris moved to the Cabinet Office as private secretary to the secretary of the cabinet, Sir Edward Bridges, where he served until July 1943. Harris described it as a unique apprenticeship: a period of sustained hard work for long hours under intense pressure, working directly for a master whom he served with devotion, admiration, and affection. Bridges was always for him one of the two outstanding men whom he served. Harris (who was made MVO in 1943) remained in the War Cabinet Office for a further year, first organizing administrative arrangements for the British delegation to the first Quebec Conference, then working as civilian staff officer in London for Lord Mountbatten, the newly appointed supreme allied commander in south-east Asia, and also serving Sir Archibald Rowlands, the adviser to the viceroy of India on war administration. He returned to the India Office in October 1944 to serve as principal private secretary to the secretary of state for India (Lord Pethick-Lawrence from September 1945, the earl of Listowel from April 1947).<br>
<br>After spending 1948 at the Royal College of Defence Studies, Harris moved to the Treasury as an assistant secretary, in charge for two and a half years of an establishments division and then for eight months of the &#145;supply&#146; division dealing with the departments concerned with overseas affairs. Then in May 1952 he was summoned back to the Cabinet Office to serve as one of the two deputies to the secretary of the cabinet, Sir Norman Brook. In July 1955 he was appointed permanent commissioner of crown lands in succession to Christopher Eastwood (who had been transferred to other duties following the Crichel Down affair), to manage the reorganization of the crown lands commission as the crown estate commission, with a part-time first commissioner, Sir Malcolm Trustram Eve, and a full-time executive second commissioner, which Harris became. Eve was the second of those whom Harris regarded as the two outstanding men with whom he served. The reorganization was successful, and Harris enjoyed supervising the management of the crown estate, and in particular the rural parts of the estate. He was made CB in 1956. On 3 October 1957 (his first wife having died two years previously), he married Marjorie Tryon (1913&#150;1986), the widow of Captain Julian Guy Tryon (with whom she had a son and a daughter) and the eldest of the eight children of Sir Harry Calvert Williams Verney, fourth baronet, who had been Liberal MP for North Buckinghamshire from 1910 to 1918.<br>
<br>In 1960, newly made a KCVO, Harris returned to the Treasury to supervise the divisions responsible for overseas expenditure, pay, and conditions of the armed services, the &#145;law and order departments&#146;, and&#151;especially congenial to him&#151;arts and sciences. There was then no department for the arts; the Treasury was directly responsible for grants to the Arts Council, to the national museums and galleries, to the Royal College and the Royal Academy of Music, to the Royal College of Art, and to the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden. Harris much enjoyed dealing with these institutions, and for them he was an understanding and well-disposed &#145;friend at court&#146;. In this capacity Harris was responsible for advising the government on the decision to establish a national theatre.<br>
<br>Although Harris had elected not to follow his father and grandfather into the priesthood, he was sustained throughout his life by a strong Christian faith and an abiding commitment to the Church of England. When therefore in spring 1964 the archbishop of Canterbury asked him to be secretary of the church commissioners, he welcomed the opportunity. The appointment was the more welcome to him because it meant once again working with Lord Silsoe (the former Sir Malcolm Trustram Eve), the first church estates commissioner, until he himself succeeded Lord Silsoe in that office in May 1969. Harris sought both to increase the commissioners' income, which provides a substantial part of the stipends and pensions of the clergy, and to encourage larger contributions from dioceses, with the result that over his thirteen years as first commissioner the average clergy stipend rose, in line with inflation, by some 350 per cent, and the average pension rose fivefold (an increase of some 50 per cent in real terms), together with greatly improved provision for the housing of retired clergy. He also set himself to improve the commissioners' relations with the general synod and with the central administration of the church in Church House&#151;so much so, that in 1978 he was appointed chairman of the central board of finance, while continuing as first commissioner until his retirement in November 1982.<br>
<br>Harris was a man of wide intellectual and artistic interests, but music was of special importance. He sang for some years in the Bach Choir. His home in later years was in Stoke D'Abernon, near Cobham, Surrey, close to the Yehudi Menuhin School, in whose affairs he became closely involved. The school was his chief outside interest after his retirement: he had chaired the friends of the school from 1972, and served on its board of governors from 1976 to 1990 (as vice-chairman from 1984 to 1989 and as chairman for a year thereafter). He converted an Elizabethan barn on his property for it to use as a concert hall.<br>
<br>Harris was relatively tall, with an open and friendly countenance. He had a lively, engaging, and enthusiastic personality, and was notable particularly for his urbanity and his bow-ties. His volume of personal recollections, <span class="italic">Memory&#151;Soft the Air</span> (1987), described both his professional and his personal life, and articulated the basis of his Christian faith. He died of myelomatosis on 22 January 1995 at his home, Slyfield Farm House, Stoke D'Abernon, survived by the four children of his first marriage and by the stepdaughter of his second marriage. A memorial service was held in Southwark Cathedral on 24 May 1995, at which his stepson-in-law, the Very Revd Colin Slee, provost of Southwark, officiated, and at which the Right Revd Lord Runcie gave an address.<br>
