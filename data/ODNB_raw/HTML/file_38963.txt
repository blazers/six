</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Way,  Thomas</span>  (1837&#150;1915), <span class="occ">printer</span>, was born at Carpenter's Coffee House, Covent Garden, London, on 1 May 1837, the eighth and youngest child of George Way (<i>bap</i>. 1794), a market victualler, and his wife, Ann, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Clewett (<i>bap</i>. 1796). He was baptized in St Paul's Church, Covent Garden, on 24 May 1837, not far from Carpenter's Coffee House, where his father was the licensee. He married Louisa Mary (1834&#150;1911), the daughter of John Chapman, an auctioneer, on 16 June 1859, and the couple had seven children, one of whom died in infancy. Thomas Way first appears in trade directories in 1859 as a &#145;lithographer, engraver and general printer&#146; at 32 Brydges Street, Covent Garden, but not long afterwards he acquired the well-established lithographic business of George Edward Madeley (<i>d</i>. 1858) at 3 Wellington Street. Madeley (initially in partnership with Ingrey) was one of the most important early lithographers in London and one of the very few to survive in business into the second half of the century. Way worked as a commercial lithographer for over fifty years, for most of this time from Wellington Street, though the building he shared with Sothebys at this address was destroyed by a disastrous fire in 1865, which led to the loss of his equipment, stock, and records. He continued to print much the same kind of commercial jobbing work as his predecessor, specializing in lithographed plans and views for the sale particulars of property auctioneers. Other surviving commercial work of his includes art gallery catalogues, fashion plates for the monthly <span class="italic">West End Gazette</span>, and illustrations for other publications.<br>
<br>Way's principal contribution to lithography was his encouragement of artists&#151;the most important being James McNeill Whistler&#151;to turn to what was then a rather unfashionable method of making prints. Though his background was in the printing trade, he took a lively interest in the arts and had several artist friends. His tireless efforts to encourage British artists to take up lithography led to a revival of the process in Britain as a means of making prints, which began with a portfolio of twelve lithographs drawn by fellow members of the Hogarth Club on 15 December 1874. Three years later he was introduced to Whistler and printed a pamphlet describing the Peacock Room decorations that Whistler had painted for Frederick Leyland. Over the following twenty years Way printed nearly 200 of Whistler's lithographs, including lithotints, and many lithographs that were drawn on transfer paper in Paris and printed in London. Way was responsible for reviving both these branches of lithography, the second of which was widely used by artists because of its convenience. Fulsome praise from Whistler resulted in Way becoming the chosen printer of most artists in the country who practised lithography on a regular basis, including William Rothenstein, Joseph Pennell, Charles Shannon, and Theodore Roussel. At Whistler's bankruptcy in 1879 he was one of the main creditors and consequently suffered directly from the artist's deliberate destruction of saleable works of art. None the less, he remained one of Whistler's staunchest supporters and provided him with financial and material assistance. According to Rothenstein, Way &#145;was a cross-grained old man, with an uncertain temper, but where Whistler was concerned, a willing slave&#146;  (Rothenstein, 131). By 1902 financial pressures forced him to start selling his outstanding collection of Whistler's prints, drawings, and paintings, most of which were bought by the American collector Charles Lang Freer, though Way gave several of the finest proofs to the British Museum. About the same time the firm moved to 6/7 Gough Square.<br>
<br>In 1914, following the death of his son, Way sold his business to Estates Gazette, the publisher of a journal that undertook lithographic printing for property auctioneers. He died of bronchitis on 6 April 1915 at his home, 14 Eton Villas, Hampstead, London.<br>
<br>Thomas Way's son, <a name="cosubject_67982"></a><span class="headword">Thomas Robert Way</span>  (1861&#150;1913), <span class="occ">artist and printmaker</span>, was born at 13 Wellington Street, Strand, London, on 13 August 1861. He was educated at St John's College, Hurstpierpoint, Hassocks, Sussex, Archbishop Tenison's Grammar School, London, and King's College School, London. Later he studied at the Government Art School in South Kensington and, briefly, at the Acad&eacute;mie Julian in Paris. On 10 July 1888 he married Amy Ellen (<i>b</i>. 1865), the daughter of Cornelius Cox, a stockbroker and collector; they had eight children, two of whom died in infancy.<br>
<br>The younger Way is usually distinguished from his father by being called T. R. Way. In 1880 he worked as an assistant to Whistler, helping to print the latter's etchings of Venice. In his early twenties he regularly exhibited oil paintings and watercolours at the Royal Academy and other leading galleries, but by 1895 had turned his attention almost exclusively to lithography. Later he produced many pastel drawings, some of which were shown at solo exhibitions at the Baillie Gallery. He was not financially successful as an artist and was dependent on an income from employment in his father's business, where he worked until his death. Rothenstein wrote that his father kept him &#145;in rigid subservience&#146;  (Rothenstein, 131), though he was vital for the survival of the firm and shouldered the burden of dealing with the outside world.<br>
<br>Way carried on his father's crusade to encourage the best artists of the day to use lithography: he was a member of the Art-Workers' Guild, serving on its committee from 1902 to 1904, lectured on lithography, and gave demonstrations of it to guild members and to others, including the Royal Society of Arts. He was also a member of the Senefelder Club, which was dedicated to the advancement of lithography. In 1896 he published the first catalogue of Whistler's lithographs, which is still used to identify and number the works. Later he wrote one of the best biographies of Whistler, <span class="italic">Memories of James McNeill Whistler the Artist</span> (1912), was co-author of another, and contributed numerous articles on lithography. He was an accomplished lithographic draughtsman and tried to supplement his income by publishing his own lithographs, many of which were drawn on transfer paper. He is best-known for a series of eight limited-edition books on London, illustrated with his lithographs and with text by several different authors, culminating in the one (with text by W. G. Bell) that includes some of his finest work, <span class="italic">The Thames from Chelsea to the Nore</span> (1907). He illustrated other books, produced many individual prints, drew about forty lithographic posters for the London Underground, and published some 200 lithographic postcards of London under the imprint of the Pastel Publishing Company. His usual signature was &#145;T. R. Way&#146; or &#145;T. R. W.&#146;. He died from heart failure, following bronchitis, on 28 February 1913 at his home, 110 Regent's Park Road, and was buried in Highgate cemetery on 4 March. He and his family were active members of the church, and the rood beam in St Mary's, Primrose Hill, was commissioned by his family as a memorial to him.<br>
