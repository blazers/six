<span class="headword">Braddock,  Edward</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1695, <em>d.</em> 1755), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was baptized at St Margaret's, Westminster, on 2 February 1695, the son and namesake of an officer (eventually a major-general) in the Coldstream Guards and his wife, Mary. The elder Edward Braddock (1664&#150;1725) obtained an ensigncy for his son in the Coldstreams in October 1710, and he then progressed by purchase: lieutenant, 1716; captain-lieutenant, 1734; captain (line rank of lieutenant-colonel), 10 February 1736; second major, with army rank of colonel, 1743; first major, 1745; and lieutenant-colonel, 1745. Before the War of the Austrian Succession, which created opportunities for advancement, his pace of promotion was rather slow. Braddock probably did not participate in, and certainly did not command, any action during the war, but instead handled administrative assignments. Seeking advancement, in February 1753 he left the Coldstreams to become colonel of the 14th foot: he spent 1753&#150;4 with the regiment at Gibraltar, where he also served as acting governor. Of his governorship Walpole later reported: &#145;he made himself adored, and where scarce any governor was endured before&#146;  (Walpole, 20.496). In April 1754 he was promoted major-general.<br>
<br>During the autumn of 1754 Braddock was given command of an expedition to North America. The duke of Cumberland, captain-general and formerly colonel of the Coldstreams, seems to have been instrumental in placing him in charge. Braddock's task was twofold: he was to put the British colonies on a war footing; and, beginning with the seizure of Fort Duquesne, on the forks of the Ohio River, he was to sweep the French back into Canada and ultimately seize Quebec and Montreal. Despite the immensity of the assignment, Braddock was given only two regiments to work with, the 44th and 48th foot, both of which were undermanned. It does not appear that he had sought this position, and he is reported to have said: &#145;we are sent like sacrifices to the altar&#146;  (Bellamy, 1.194).<br>
<br>Braddock sailed from Cork in December 1754 and disembarked at Hampton, Virginia, on 20 February 1755. His first initiative was to co-ordinate the war preparations of the various colonies, but, despite government directives that exalted his authority, he was soon complaining over a lack of co-operation. On 15 April, at a conference in Alexandria, he did win the approval of five governors for a co-ordinated offensive, but he was unsuccessful in his attempt to persuade them to establish a common fund to finance the war. While in Virginia, Braddock became convinced that he needed to have a large contingent of Native Americans to accompany his expedition, yet, when his agents succeeded in recruiting several hundred of them, Governor James Glen of South Carolina helped persuade these warriors to stay at home.<br>
<br>Nor did Braddock find more co-operation after he joined his army at Fort Cumberland (Wills Creek, Maryland) on 10 May. The troops were poorly supplied and much of the food was spoiled. When he pressed contractors to fulfil their obligations they demanded extra time and raised their prices. Only in early June was this problem alleviated, as Benjamin Franklin was able to provide some wagons and provisions. Yet another problem that Braddock faced at Wills Creek was the quality of his troops. The two British regiments had been augmented by drafts and by recruitment in America, but as late as 8 June Braddock was writing to Cumberland's secretary: &#145;the whole of the Forces are now assembled, making about two thousand Effectives, the greatest part Virginians, very indifferent Men, this Country affording no better; it has cost infinite pains and labor to bring them to any sort of Regularity and Discipline&#146;  (Pargellis, <span class="italic">Military Affairs</span>, 54). Nevertheless, when the army finally marched, on 10 June, Braddock expressed optimism. The march proceeded slowly, and he became concerned that if the pace did not quicken Fort Duquesne would be reinforced before his army arrived (as did in fact happen). On 16 June Braddock ordered a division of his army, leaving about one-third of the men (and most of the wagons) to proceed at their own pace, under the command of Thomas Dunbar, colonel of the 48th.<br>
<br>By the early afternoon of 9 July Braddock's army was within 10 miles of Fort Duquesne when it was suddenly confronted by a force of about 800 men, more than three-quarters of them Native Americans, the rest French or Canadian. The enemy force had actually intended to ambush the British as they were fording the Monongahela, but it improvised quickly, as the Native Americans raced down the flanks of Braddock's army and caught it in a crossfire, while the French held the front. Within minutes many of the officers in Braddock's vanguard were killed or incapacitated, and the men fell back. Braddock himself was with the main body of his army, and it appears that on hearing the firing in the front he sent forward a detachment, which, however, soon encountered the retreating vanguard and became enmeshed with it. The three hours that followed found Braddock's army in the same confused state, helpless in the face of enemy fire. Braddock attempted to rally his men, but to no avail, and finally he was shot in the chest&#151;possibly by one of his own men&#151;and the army retreated, two-thirds of the men having been killed or wounded. On 13 July, in Dunbar's camp at Great Meadows near Fort Necessity, some 60 miles back in the direction of Wills Creek, Braddock surrendered his command and died. He was buried there the following day on the road. His grave was discovered in 1812, and in 1913 a monument was raised over it.<br>
<br>A lifelong bachelor, Braddock left his estate to a prot&eacute;g&eacute;, the actress George Anne Bellamy, and to John Calcraft, an army agent he mistakenly believed to be her husband. Like many officers, he had for years indulged himself at the gaming tables of London and Bath, and contemporary rumour linked him with several women. Regardless of his lifestyle, however, the fortune he bequeathed was significant&#151;&pound;7000, according to Bellamy&#151;if not large.<br>
<br>Contemporaries portrayed Braddock as hot tempered. It may be that as he aged he attempted to rein in his temper, and an officer who served with him 1746&#150;8 wrote that Braddock, &#145;by having been now and then taken down, is greatly reformed&#146;  (<span class="italic">Frankland-Russell-Astley MSS</span>, 354). The issue of his temper is related to a second: that he was a martinet. Even among his peers he seems to have had a reputation for harshness. Bellamy recalled an incident when he, at her request, interceded for &#145;a poor fellow [about] to be chastised&#146;. The officer that he spoke to asked him, &#145;How long since he had divested himself of brutality&#146;, to which Braddock responded, &#145;You never knew me insolent to my inferiors&#146;  (Bellamy, 3.55). But the characterization of Braddock as a fierce disciplinarian persisted, and it had particular consequence in America, where reports of his harshness fed a negative stereotype of British officers.<br>
<br>Braddock's historical significance is tied entirely to his expedition in North America and particularly to the battle that concluded it. For the most part, the assessment by contemporaries and historians alike has been harsh. As the officer in command of an army that suffered an overwhelming and bloody defeat he must accept some responsibility, but it would be simplistic to place all the blame on him. The assignment given him by the government was wholly unreasonable, especially considering the troops and the resources he was allowed. The lack of co-operation from the governors&#151;which, in the case of Glen, amounted to virtual sabotage&#151;hampered his progress, as did the dilatoriness of the contractors. At the battle itself Braddock was undermined by the troops, who ignored his orders to re-form and move against the enemy, and by the ineptitude of some subordinate officers, particularly Lieutenant-Colonel (later Major-General) Thomas Gage, who commanded the vanguard. The image that lingers, of Braddock stubbornly attempting to fight a conventional &#145;European&#146; battle in an American forest against an irregular force, may misrepresent his tactics during the engagement and certainly underestimates the obstacles that he faced.<br>
