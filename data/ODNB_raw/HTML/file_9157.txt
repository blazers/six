<span class="headword">Faricius</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1117), <span class="occ">doctor and abbot of Abingdon</span>, was a native of Italy. Born in Arezzo, he became the foremost physician in England, a man of letters, a powerfully effective monastic reformer and administrator, and one of the most highly regarded servants of Henry I. Tireless, austere, and possessed of an acute memory, he was also a charming conversationalist&#151;overall, a fine specimen of twelfth-century Renaissance man. It is not known either how or where he acquired his medical skill (no evidence links him to Salerno), or when he came to England. He is first noticed in the reign of William II, as cellarer of Malmesbury Abbey. At some point after Aldhelm's relics were translated to Malmesbury in 1078, Faricius composed there a scholarly hagiography of the saint (<span class="italic">Patrologia Latina</span>, 89, 1863, cols. 633&#150;84) which became a source for the life that William of Malmesbury later included in his <span class="italic">Gesta pontificum</span>. (Despite William's occasionally muted praise of Faricius, the possibility is at least worth entertaining that he sat at the cellarer's feet in his youth.) However, it would have been as physician rather than as hagiographer that Faricius began to attract attention at court.<br>
<br>When the dilapidated and oppressed abbey of Abingdon sought a new abbot after a three-year vacancy, Henry I's approval of the monks' nomination of Faricius&#151;suggested, in later legend, by the Virgin herself&#151;was readily forthcoming. Robert Bloet, bishop of Lincoln (<i>d</i>. 1123), installed him at Abingdon on 1 November 1100. The following year, when Queen Matilda was expecting her first child, Faricius was chief among those physicians ordered to attend her confinement. According to the eulogy of the abbot in the chronicle of Abingdon the king believed that he himself had often been cured by Faricius's prescriptions. Also among the abbot's notable patients were members of such families as the de Veres, the Fitzhaymons, and the Crispins. Benefactions from them and their kind, and still more from the royal family, ensured that, during Faricius's abbacy, Abingdon enjoyed a level of prosperity equalled by few contemporary English houses. Indeed, Faricius's resuscitation of monastic life at Abingdon bears comparison with &AElig;thelwold's reforms there over a century previously. The abbot was enabled to increase the number of monks from some twenty-eight to eighty, to rebuild both church and monastic buildings (including an infirmary) on a substantial scale, and to decorate lavishly. Relics arrived from as far away as Constantinople; the library was enhanced by professional scribes, who copied patristic and medical works; a school flourished. During all this Faricius also found the energy to debate infant baptism with the Oxford master, Theobald d'&Eacute;tampes.<br>
<br>But Faricius's energies were mainly directed towards political and administrative ends. In order to support the high quota of knight service assigned to the monastery at the conquest he had to spend much time trying, not always successfully, to recover alienated fiefs. He also had to exploit royal connections to the full. In defending the interests of his house the abbot was among the first both to benefit from the new writs &#145;of right&#146;, and to gain exemption from the 1110 feudal aid demanded by the king for the marriage of his daughter Matilda to the emperor Henry V. He is also sometimes said to have been an early appellant to <span class="roman">Domesday Book</span>; but the <span class="italic">Liber de thesauro</span> (exchequer book) referred to in a court case concerning the hundredal obligations of one of the abbey's manors must be some other record, because <span class="roman">Domesday Book</span> lacks information on hundreds in its relevant section. Whatever the document, in this as in all his various contacts with the royal family, both medical and forensic, Faricius showed himself to be archiepiscopal material. After exercising regalian right in Canterbury for the five years following the death of Anselm in 1109, Henry I decided on Faricius as Anselm's successor. The monks of Canterbury were in favour&#151;not so the other parties claiming involvement in the election. There was some apprehension about Faricius's zeal for reform; the secular bishops, led by Roger of Salisbury (<i>d</i>. 1139), wanted a Norman, a secular clerk, and, some speciously argued, a primate not tainted by a career spent examining female urine. Ralph d'Escures, bishop of Rochester, became the successful compromise candidate.<br>
<br>Thereafter Faricius's fortunes perhaps declined. If the thirteenth-century recensions of the chronicle of Abingdon can be trusted, he may have been the first of the great &#145;feudal&#146; abbots to maintain a separate household and table from that of his monks; and the tension resulting between them may have surfaced in a dispute ostensibly over cheese rations. The dispute was serious enough for investigation by a royal commission, rather embarrassingly consisting of the new archbishop, Roger of Salisbury, and one of the abbot's own vassals. Though Faricius was exonerated, little more is heard of him. He died not long after, in February 1117&#151;ironically, according to one of those late recensions, of food poisoning.<br>
