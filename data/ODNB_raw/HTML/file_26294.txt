<span class="headword">Stanihurst <span class="st"> [Stanyhurst]</span>,  Richard</span>  (1547&#150;1618), <span class="occ">literary scholar and translator</span>, eldest son of <a href="#cosubject_26293">James Stanihurst (1521/2&#150;1573) [<i>see below</i>]</a> and his first wife, Anne Fitzsimon, was born in Dublin. His parents belonged to the urban mercantile patriciate which had a proud record of service in civic and state administrations. The couple had two other sons and two daughters, including Margaret who was to become mother of James Ussher, another great Irish polymath.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_26293"></a><span class="headword">James Stanihurst</span>  (1521/2&#150;1573), <span class="occ">speaker of the Irish House of Commons and recorder of Dublin</span>, was himself the son of a mayor of Dublin and chancery official, Nicholas Stanihurst (<i>d</i>. 1554), who had shown an interest in literary and medical matters. James proved to be a loyal government servitor in a time of religious and political change, presiding over the restoration of Roman Catholicism in parliament in Queen Mary's reign and supervising the passage of the Reformation legislation in the parliament of 1560. He was speaker of the Irish House of Commons on three occasions. For his efforts he was well rewarded by grants from the crown and the city of leases to extensive properties in counties Dublin, Meath, and Kildare. As well as the Stanihurst city home in the tower that bore their name to the west of Dublin Castle, the family had a county seat and estate at Corduff, north of Swords, county Dublin. James enjoyed the patronage of the chief governor, Sir Henry Sidney, and in his opening speech to parliament in 1570 he strongly supported Sidney's proposals for a national system of secondary and tertiary education. Edmund Campion, the visiting English scholar, who was a guest at Stanihurst's home, recorded the speech in his history of Ireland. James's commitment to reform in public life was reflected in his agency of the printing of the Irish parliamentary statutes for the first time in 1571. Although supportive in public of the religious changes brought about by the Reformation, James's private convictions leaned towards the older religion, a fact that may have impeded his advancement to the office of chancellor of Ireland. After his first wife's death he married a woman named Brereton. He died on 27 December 1573 at the age of fifty-one.<h2>
<a name="RichardStanihurstseducationandearlyworks"></a>Richard Stanihurst's education and early works</h2>About 1556 Richard was sent to the famous grammar school run by Peter White at Kilkenny. White's teaching methods within a humanistic curriculum were vaunted by Stanihurst in a number of places in his works, and among the graduates were luminaries such as Peter Lombard, later archbishop of Armagh, and Thomas White, rector of the Irish college, Salamanca. Stanihurst matriculated at University College, Oxford, in 1563 and graduated BA in 1568. He then studied law at Furnival's Inn and Lincoln's Inn in London before travelling on the continent. Returning to his parents' home in Dublin, he was joined there in 1570 by Edmund Campion, the outstanding fellow of St John's College, Oxford, who had become mentor to the younger man.<br>
<br>It was Campion who, recognizing a precocious talent, encouraged Richard Stanihurst to press on with the publication of his work on Porphyry. Stanihurst was nineteen years old when he undertook the academic study which culminated in <span class="italic">Harmonia, seu, Catena dialectica in Porphyrianos institutiones</span>, published in 1570. Dedicated to Sir Henry Sidney, this is probably the first original work by an Irish writer to appear in print. <span class="italic">Harmonia</span> is an explication of Porphyry's treatise on Aristotelian logic, the <span class="italic">Isagoge</span>. In order to expound fully the logical categories deriving from Aristotle, Stanihurst adduced the commentaries of an impressive array of philosophers and schoolmen, his bibliography listing 109 names or sources. The book contains forty chapters, throughout which the Latin translation of Porphyry is presented seriatim. The synthesis of Aristotelian principles and those of the Greek Neoplatonist catches the spirit of the philosophical eclecticism of the humanist era. <span class="italic">Harmonia, seu, Catena dialectica</span> ranks as the first major exposition of Aristotle's logical system to be published in sixteenth-century England. A recent appraisal of Stanihurst's <span class="italic">Harmonia</span> describes it as &#145;by any standards, an impressive piece of scholarship, comparing favourably with the very best work being done on the continent at the same time&#146;  (Schmitt, 26).<br>
<br>As the <span class="italic">Harmonia</span> appeared in print in London in 1570, Stanihurst was joined in his Dublin home by Campion. Together they researched the history of Ireland, having access to records in the collection of Richard's father. Before he left Ireland, Campion produced his &#145;Two bokes of the histories of Ireland&#146; which he regarded as unfinished. Stanihurst took on the task of elaborating and refining his friend's work, and when Raphael Holinshed, seeking a contributor on Ireland for his major chroniculary undertaking, heard of the existing work, he invited Stanihurst's participation. The results are to be seen in the substantial sections on the history and description of Ireland and its inhabitants in Holinshed's <span class="italic">Chronicles</span> which, though based on the joint studies of the co-working scholars, are written in Stanihurst's flamboyant and eccentric prose. Among the more prominent features of his work are his absorption with unusual natural phenomena and also his <i>parti pris</i> as an advocate of Old English civility in Ireland in the face of Gaelic Irish cultural expansion. Before the <span class="italic">Chronicles</span> were fully distributed, Stanihurst's Irish sections fell foul of the privy council because of derogatory comments about the Butler faction and its adherents, to whom Queen Elizabeth was related. As a result, Stanihurst was interviewed by the councillors, and the publisher, Reginald Wolf, was forced to cancel the offending pages.<br>
<br>At the time of the publication of the <span class="italic">Chronicles</span> in 1577, Stanihurst was living in London in the household of the earl of Kildare, acting as schoolteacher to the earl's son and heir, Garret. Stanihurst's Geraldine sympathies are very clear in his coverage of the history of the earlier Tudor era in Holinshed's <span class="italic">Chronicles</span>. Accused of political unreliability and also suspect after his alchemical experiments had been discovered (he was arrested for forgery in London), Stanihurst became unsettled. On 26 August 1579 his young wife, Genet Barnewall (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1560), whom he had married about 1575, died while giving birth in London to a stillborn child. Her death, plus that of his pupil, Garret Fitzgerald, and of his mentor, Edmund Campion, may have led Stanihurst to cut his ties and migrate to the Low Countries. He settled first in Leiden and matriculated at the new university there in 1582 as a student of medicine.<h2>
<a name="IntheNetherlandsVirgilsAeneisandIrishhistory"></a>In the Netherlands: Virgil's Aeneis and Irish history</h2>In the same year there appeared from the press of John Pates in Leiden the last of Stanihurst's works in English, <span class="italic">The First Four Books of Virgil's &#145;Aeneis&#146; Translated into English Heroicall Verse</span>. Dedicated to his brother-in-law, Patrick Plunket, Lord Dunsany, Stanihurst's work attempted to put into practice the orthographical principles expounded in the introduction. He wished to show how &#145;verse&#146; (poetry adhering to fixed metrical patterns) was the proper medium for English poetry, as opposed to &#145;rhyme&#146; (poetry organized around end-rhymes), and that sound rather than orthography should be the arbiter of stresses in his lines. The particular form of verse that he advocated was the hexameter.<br>
<br>The result was an amazing display of linguistic virtuosity, entailing strange mimetic, onomatopoeic phrases, slang, intriguing verbal conjunctions, and strange inversions. A storm is described as follows:<blockquote>
<div>Thee whilst in the skye seat great bouncing rumbelo thundring<br>
</div>
<div>Ratleth: downe powring to sleete thick hayle knob is added.<br>
</div>
<div>The sayls tear tag rag, to the sky the waves uphoysing,<br>
</div>
</blockquote>while Neptune, addressing the winds as &#145;cloggy rakehells&#146;, chides them thus:<blockquote>
<div>Dare ye loa, curst baretours, in this my Segnorie regal<br>
</div>
<div>Too raise such raks iaks on seas, and dangers unordered?<br>
</div> (<span class="italic">First Four Books</span>, 21&#150;2)</blockquote>The diction used by Stanihurst in his translation was one of its most significant features. Indeed over 400 new English words are to be found in print for the first time in his <span class="italic">Aeneis</span>.<br>
<br>Although the work was published in London in 1583 and despite the support of Gabriel Harvey, a fellow believer in the superiority of the hexameter in English, the experiment was adjudged a failure by a succession of critics. Contemporaries such as Thomas Nashe and Barnaby Rich panned Stanihurst's efforts, the latter opining that he had &#145;stripped Virgil out of a velvet gown into a fool's coat&#146;  (<span class="italic">First Four Books</span>, viii). Joseph Hall parodied the work as follows:<blockquote>
<div>If Jove speak English in a thundering cloud,<br>
</div>
<div>Twick twack and riff raff roars he aloud.<br>
</div>
<div>Fie on the forged mint that did create<br>
</div>
<div>New coin of words never articulate.<br>
</div> (<span class="italic">First Four Books</span>, xx)</blockquote>Modern commentators have recognized the importance of the <span class="italic">Aeneis</span> in terms of prosody and philology but the poetic achievement remains largely unappreciated. The entire text was edited and reprinted at least twice in modern times&#151;by Edward Arber in 1880, and by Dirk Van Der Haar in 1933. Appended to the translation were various &#145;poetical devices&#146; including translations of some of the psalms in various metres, epitaphs for friends and relatives, and one original poem, &#145;A Prayer too the Trinitye&#146;, not composed in hexameters.<br>
<br>The second of Stanihurst's works devoted to Irish history and chorography, <span class="italic">De rebus in Hibernia gestis</span>, appeared from the Plantin press in Antwerp in 1584. In this more scientific treatment of Ireland, Stanihurst was anxious to reveal its merits to a continental as well as an Irish readership. In the first of four sections he rehearsed his perspective on the physical and human resources of Ireland, displaying therein a more benign attitude towards the Gaelic population. In the other three sections Stanihurst presented a version of Giraldus Cambrensis's account of the Norman invasion and settlement of Ireland in the twelfth century. From his vantage point in the Netherlands, Stanihurst was celebrating the political and cultural heritage conveyed to his own Old English community from Norman times. Also significant was the greater openness to the Gaelic Irish on the part of one who had previously been highly critical of their customs. As he became more absorbed within the Catholic milieu of the Spanish Netherlands, Stanihurst was less inclined to stress cultural or political divisions and, in an effort to present the population as universally faithful to the Roman church, was prepared to see his fellow islanders as joint upholders of the old religion.<br>
<br>This theme was consolidated in Stanihurst's next published work, <span class="italic">De vita sancti Patricii libri duo</span>, printed at Plantin's press in 1587. This new biography of Ireland's national saint was dedicated to Alexander Farnese, the duke of Parma, governor of the Spanish Netherlands. By that time Stanihurst was living at Dunkirk and was in receipt of a pension from the Spanish crown, being described as &#145;very loyal to the king [Philip II], not a soldier but very useful in other ways&#146;  (Loomie, appx III, no. 126). By associating the work of Farnese in countering heretics in the Netherlands with the evangelism of Patrick in the face of paganism, Stanihurst was claiming the saint for the European Counter-Reformation with an eye to a continental readership. Also, in boosting the tradition of Irish loyalty to the papacy since Patrician times, Stanihurst was anxious to identify his native land as a bastion of Catholicism under St Patrick's patronage.<br>
<br>While living in Dunkirk in the later 1580s, Stanihurst became integrated into the community of Roman Catholic exiles from England, and about 1586 married Helen (<i>d</i>. 1602), daughter of Sir Thomas Copley of Gatton in Surrey. He was also engaged in chemical medicine, and he concocted a remarkable potion which, it was claimed, was so efficacious that many who were ill, even at the point of death, were restored to health. The effects of the remedy were reported to Philip II who summoned Stanihurst to Madrid in 1591. In a letter to the humanist, Justus Lipsius, whom he befriended at Leiden, Stanihurst described his voyage to Madrid and his arrival there in early 1592. The main purpose of Stanihurst's sojourn at the Spanish court was to conduct scientific experiments in chemical medicine in the laboratory set up by Philip II adjacent to the palace of the Escorial. Although sponsored by the ailing king, the experiments may not have been a success as Philip's medics were opposed to them, but an outcome was Stanihurst's unpublished work, &#145;El toque de Alquimia&#146;, written in Spanish in 1593, and dedicated to the king. Therein Stanihurst explained his scientific principles and castigated the purveyors of black magic who gave alchemy a bad name.<h2>
<a name="DiplomacyforSpainandfinalyears"></a>Diplomacy for Spain and final years</h2>While resident at the Spanish court from 1592 to 1595, Stanihurst engaged in diplomacy on behalf of the community of English and Irish Catholic exiles who looked to Philip II for assistance and support. He was close to English Catholic activists such as Sir Francis Englefield and Father Robert Persons SJ, and was at one with them in advocating Spanish military intervention in England and Ireland to restore Catholicism. He remained sceptical, however&#151;at least in the earlier 1590s&#151;of Gaelic initiatives to draw Madrid into the rebellious activities of the northern Irish chieftains; his letters to Englefield from the Escorial palace in 1593 reflect his dismissive attitude to a unilateral enterprise in Ireland. Also attested in these letters, however, is his consuming interest in furthering Spanish Habsburg political interests throughout Europe, with the islands of Britain and Ireland forming one zone for Spanish involvement.<br>
<br>For six years after his return to the Spanish Netherlands as a pensioner of the crown in 1595, Stanihurst committed himself to the project for a Spanish succession to the crowns of England and Ireland, ideally in the person of the infanta Isabella, Philip II's daughter. To that end he belatedly embraced the cause of Hugh O'Neill, earl of Tyrone, for the overthrow of the Elizabethan protestant regime in Ireland, describing himself as an &#145;agent&#146; of O'Neill in the negotiations preceding the Spanish landing at Kinsale in 1601. Thereafter his career as diplomat faded, but there was an echo of his zealous anti-Stuart campaigning in 1605. The newly appointed Spanish ambassador at the English court, Pedro de Zuniga, announced that he wished to have Stanihurst as his interpreter, but the proposal gave grave offence to James I, who had been the target of an anti-Stuart tract, entitled <span class="italic">Beware of the Northern Gate</span>, published in 1598 by the group of exiled Catholics of whom the Irishman was a leading light.<br>
<br>For the last dozen or so years of his life Stanihurst retreated into the haven of his scholarly and spiritual interests. His second wife, Helen Copley, died in 1602. They had had two sons&#151;Peter, born in 1598, and William, born in 1600&#151;both of whom became Jesuits. Their father had preceded them into the Society of Jesus, being ordained priest in the mid-1600s. He was appointed chaplain to the court of the archdukes, Albert and Isabella, joint governors of the Spanish Netherlands, at Brussels. In that capacity he contributed to the corpus of devotional works reflecting the spirit of the Counter-Reformation. A collection of litanies and prayers to be said before the eucharist had been published by the Plantin-Moretus press in 1598 (<span class="italic">Psalmi litaniae et orationes</span>). His deep interest in Marian devotion, attested in his correspondence with Justus Lipsius in 1592, bore fruit in two works, one of which, &#145;Margarita Mariana&#146;, remained unpublished (Brussels, Biblioth&egrave;que Royale, MS 3816). The other, <span class="italic">Hebdomada Mariana</span>, was published in 1609. The &#145;Margarita&#146; was a work of solid patristic scholarship on the theology of the Virgin Mary, while <span class="italic">Hebdomada</span>, dedicated to Isabella, was a more popular work, consisting of a series of meditations and devotions on the seven principal Marian feasts. In 1614 there appeared at Douai Stanihurst's <span class="italic">Hebdomada eucharistica</span>. Written in the same format as the <span class="italic">Hebdomada Mariana</span>, this work encapsulated Tridentine orthodoxy regarding the sacrament of the eucharist, while providing readers with spiritual exercises for feast days in its honour.<br>
<br>Besides promoting the piety of the Counter-Reformation in his last years, Stanihurst also defended the Roman Catholic church and the papacy against attack by protestants, and specifically his own nephew, James Ussher. The younger man had enthusiastically espoused protestantism, was ordained in the Church of Ireland, and became archbishop of Armagh. Like his uncle he was a formidable scholar and he shared some academic interests with the older man. He wrote to Stanihurst in Flanders, requesting copies of certain documents for the elucidation of Irish ecclesiastical history. Although ideologically divided from Stanihurst, he admired his scholarship and had read his <span class="italic">De vita sancti Patricii</span> and <span class="italic">Hebdomada Mariana</span>. It was when Ussher published a work on the corruption of the Roman church, <span class="italic">The Succession of Churches in the West</span>, in 1613 that Stanihurst was moved to respond in print with <span class="italic">Brevis praemunitio pro futura concertatione cum Jacobo Usserio</span>, published at Douai in 1615. Using a variety of arguments to undermine Ussher's position, Stanihurst employed patristic sources. He also appealed to his nephew on the grounds of their common Christian inheritance: &#145;I take my stand in the defence of the Catholic faith in this spiritual duel which sees an Irishman contending with an Irishman, a Dubliner with a Dubliner, and, saddest of all, an uncle with his nephew&#146;  (Stanihurst, <span class="italic">Brevis praemunitio</span>, 1615, 3&#150;4). This utterance summed up the course of his later life. Richard Stanihurst died in 1618 and was buried in Brussels.<br>
<br>Stanihurst's younger son, <a name="cosubject_26295"></a><span class="headword">William Stanihurst</span>  (1600&#150;1663), <span class="occ">writer on theology</span>, was baptized in Brussels on 18 June 1600. He studied in Brussels and, following his father and brother, entered the Society of Jesus in Mechelen on 25 September 1617. He resided mainly at Brussels and preached in both English and Flemish. He became known as a voluminous writer of religious works, many of which were translated into many European languages. Among the more popular books were <span class="italic">Dei immortalis in corpore mortali patientis historia</span>, published in Antwerp in 1660, and <span class="italic">Veteris hominis per expensa quatuor novissima metamorphosis et nove genesis</span>, published at Antwerp in 1661. These went through several editions in the succeeding century. William Stanihurst died, unmarried, in what is now Belgium, on 10 January 1663.<br>
