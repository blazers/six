<span class="headword">Ayres,  Ruby Mildred</span>  (1881&#150;1955), <span class="occ">romantic novelist</span>, was born on 28 January 1881 at Gresham Villa, St John's Road, Watford, the third daughter of Charles Pryor (or Prior) Ayres (1850&#150;1914), architect, and his wife, Alice Whitford (1855&#150;1903), daughter of William Griggs, surgeon, of Ramsgate, Kent. Charles Ayres had been articled to Edward Welby Pugin (1834&#150;1875) and subsequently established a highly successful practice in Watford, designing a number of the public buildings there. Ruby Ayres was one of the most popular and prolific romantic novelists of the twentieth century. She began writing stories as a girl and claimed to have been expelled from school at the age of fifteen for writing &#145;an advanced love story&#146;. Meanwhile &#145;she discovered from the appreciation of her schoolmates, that she could satisfy the feminine taste for romance&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 15 Nov 1955, 11). She entered a competition run by <span class="italic">Boy's Own Paper</span> for a school story, using a brother's name, and won the first prize of a guinea.<br>
<br>On 23 December 1909 Ayres married Reginald William Pocock (1880&#150;1948), an insurance broker. The couple had no children and she continued to write, she said, to pass the time while her husband was at work. Shortly after her marriage her story &#145;The Professor and the Blue Stocking&#146; was accepted by a magazine and she was soon commissioned to write serials for the <span class="italic">Daily Chronicle</span> and the <span class="italic">Daily Mirror</span>. She also contributed to women's magazines. In the 1950s she provided responses to readers' problems for <span class="italic">Home Companion</span>. Her first book, <span class="italic">Castles in Spain</span>, was published by Cassell in 1912. It is a bitter-sweet story, narrated in the form of a journal by an elderly bachelor, of love flowering too late and differs significantly from the rest of her work, published by Hodder and Stoughton, where the third-person narratives focus on young people and end in unions.<br>
<br>Ayres's relationship with Hodder and Stoughton began in 1916 and ended only at her death. She wrote some 136 novels for them, many of which were regularly reprinted and were issued in both quality and cheap/popular formats. Her immediate and continuing popularity can be gauged from the data available for <span class="italic">Richard Chatterton</span>, which was issued in 1916 with a print run of 8000 copies: in 1917 a further 25,000 copies were printed, in 1918 another 19,000, and in 1932 another 30,000. Meanwhile subsequent novels were published in initial print runs of 20,000 to 45,000 copies; these included <span class="italic">The Remembered Kiss</span> (1918), <span class="italic">The Romance of a Rogue</span> (1923), <span class="italic">Unofficial Wife</span> (1937), <span class="italic">The Constant Heart</span> (1941), and <span class="italic">Love without Wings</span> (1953).<br>
<br>In Ayres's fictional world the country is good, town life, especially that of London, often bad. Households, white middle-class if sometimes impoverished, regularly include a cook and a maid. Plots concentrate on the misunderstandings that keep potential lovers apart and the (strained) coincidences or crises that bring them together. A simple morality approves forgiveness, truth-telling, and kindness to animals. Ayres's heroes are always self-assured, decisive, morally sound, and financially secure, and older than the heroines. She claimed to admire &#145;the rough, tough, he-man type who can curse and swear a bit&#146;  (<span class="italic">Daily Mirror</span>, 15 Nov 1955, 11). Her heroines, who rarely need to seek paid employment, can be sweet, self-effacing, and loyal to a family which exploits them, or spoilt, wilful, and self-seeking, needing the stern attitude (and sometimes harsh words) of a man with a determined mouth and chin to unlock their better natures and to make them realize that the glamorous &#145;fast set&#146; is not, after all, for them. &#145;Happiness&#146;, Ayres observed, &#145;lies in the simple things in life&#146;  (<span class="italic">Weekend Woman</span>, 1939, 102).<br>
<br>The attitude to money in Ayres's work is ambivalent: it is wrong to rank it above other values such as love and loyalty but a modicum of wealth is fundamental to the happy ending. However, she asserted that &#145;romance can be lively even when the strawberry season is over and there is only bread and cheese in the larder&#146;  (Vinson, 41). Deaths&#151;often of rivals or other figures who threaten the perfect bliss of the central characters, or who provide useful legacies&#151;occur with remarkable convenience, often in car or aeroplane crashes, and without distressing detail or mourning. A play, <span class="italic">Silver Wedding</span>, was produced in 1932.<br>
<br>Ayres was a good businesswoman. Her most frequently quoted remark was &#145;I write for money&#146;. She normally negotiated directly with her publisher, dispensing with an agent except for her overseas interests. She once said: &#145;First I fix the price, then I fix the title, then I write the book&#146;  (<span class="italic">Daily Mail</span>, 15 Nov 1955, 3). She could write as many as 20,000 words a day. There is so little contextual information behind her plots that Ayres's novels do not become markedly dated and with only minor revision a number were issued in new editions many years after her death. Her books continue to be popular among library borrowers into the twenty-first century.<br>
<br>Ayres was a forthright but kindly person. Her pet dislikes were ballet and affected young men. In the 1920s she was a member of the Lyceum and Writers' clubs and in the 1930s and 1940s she belonged to the Ladies' Carlton Club. She died at Lulworth House, Ellesmere Road, Weybridge, Surrey, on 14 November 1955 of pneumonia and a cerebral thrombosis. She was cremated at Golders Green, Middlesex, on 18 November.<br>
