<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Penington,  Isaac</span>  (1616&#150;1679), <span class="occ">Quaker and writer</span>, was born in London, the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21840/', "Isaac Penington (c.1584&#150;1661)")</script>, alderman, and his first wife, Abigail (<i>b</i>. 1588), daughter of the London merchant John Allen. He was admitted to the Inner Temple in November 1634 and called to the bar on 3 November 1639. In the meantime he matriculated from St Catharine's College, Cambridge, on 1 April 1637, though he apparently took no degree. Thomas Ellwood would later reflect that he had &#145;a sharp and excellent wit &hellip; well cultivated and polished with an ingenuous and liberal Education&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works of &hellip; Isaac Penington</span>, sig. c1<i>v</i>).<h2>
<a name="ThepreQuakeryears"></a>The pre-Quaker years</h2>Unsettled by the revolution Penington sought spiritual solace, the means to which he explored in <span class="italic">A Touchstone or Tryall of Faith</span> (1648). In addition to explaining how to discern genuine faith from that of the devil, &#145;<i>that great cozouning merchant</i>&#146;  (sig. A2<i>r</i>&#150;<i>v</i>), he expounded the practices of the primitive church. Unlike radicals who viewed the overthrow of monarchy with millenarian optimism, he was concerned about pervasive depravity, a theme he developed in <span class="italic">The Great and Sole Troubler</span> (1649). In <span class="italic">A Word for the Common Weale</span> (1650) he called on the Rump to enact sound laws to establish a salutary relationship between parliament and people. Having left the established church to become an Independent by 1649, he deplored the contentiousness over external forms that prevented England from attaining freedom of conscience. It was essential, he argued in <span class="italic">A Voyce out of Thick Darkness</span> (1650), to wait for the spirit's light, and in <span class="italic">Light or Darknesse</span> (1650) he recounted how he had been spiritually troubled and longed for &#145;somewhat more perfect&#146; righteousness  (p. 10). The struggle between the principles of light and darkness is also explored in <span class="italic">Certain Scripture Prophecies</span> (1650), which reflects a knowledge of typology.<br>
<br>Apparently referring to reputed Ranters as well as apostates in general, in <span class="italic">Severall Fresh Inward Openings</span> (July 1650) and <span class="italic">An Eccho from the Great Deep</span> (1650) Penington addressed &#145;the Mad Folks&#146; who had forsaken Christian beliefs and lived wickedly. Disillusioned, he resolved to &#145;retire into my secret corner, to lament and bewail that Misery and Desolation, which is seizing upon all things&#146;  (Penington, <span class="italic">Openings</span>, sig. A4<i>r</i>). Unless he was speaking figuratively, he embraced the unorthodox doctrine of the soul's sleep between death and resurrection.<br>
<br>During the spring of 1651 Penington addressed England's political problems. In <span class="italic">The Fundamental Right, Safety and Liberty of the People</span> (1651), directed to parliament and the people of &#145;this Sick Nation&#146;, he argued that parliament, like the Stuart monarchy, had exceeded its limits  (sig. B1<i>r</i>). Proclaiming that people have the right to choose their polity and governors, he insisted they could alter them when the government becomes &#145;burdensome or inconvenient&#146;. To keep parliamentary power from becoming arbitrary, elections must be free and frequent, MPs should not administer the laws, and parliaments should not engage in spiritual affairs. He was prepared to accept the return of monarchy if the prerogative were limited, people's rights were protected, and parliament had power to redress grievances. After the Rump's dissolution he wrote <span class="italic">A Considerable Question</span> (1653), averring that limited government, though less efficient, was preferable to absolute dominion. Rule by the saints&#151;if they truly were&#151;would be in the world's best interest, but otherwise not.<br>
<br>Penington continued to be dismayed by the emphasis on externals in religion at the expense of the inward substantial part&#151;the divine seed implanted by the spirit as opposed to Satan's fleshly seed. Embodied in much of his writing, this concern received expression in <span class="italic">The Life of a Christian</span> (1653) and <span class="italic">Divine Essays</span> (1654). In pursuing the life of the spirit he found a kindred companion in Mary Springett (<i>bap</i>. 1623, <i>d</i>. 1682) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/45819/', "Penington, Mary")</script>], daughter and heir of Sir John Proude of Goodnestone Court, Kent, and his second wife, Anne, daughter of Edward Fagge of Ewell, Kent; Mary's first husband, Sir William Springett, had died in 1644, and their daughter, Gulielma Maria, would later marry William Penn. On 13 May 1654, at St Margaret's, Westminster, Penington wed Mary, whose &#145;love was drawn towards him, because &hellip; he saw the deceit of all nations&#146;  (<span class="italic">Experiences &hellip; of Mary Penington</span>, 38). They had five children: <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21843/', "John Penington (1655&#150;1710)")</script>; Isaac (<i>d</i>. 1670); Mary (1657&#150;1726), who married the London woollen draper Daniel Wharley in 1686; William (1665&#150;1703), who became a druggist; and <a href="#cosubject_21839">Edward [<i>see below</i>]</a>. The Peningtons lived in London before moving in 1658 to the Grange, near Chalfont St Giles, Buckinghamshire, a wedding present from Penington's father. They also had estates at Causham (Caversham) Lodge near Reading, at Datchet, Buckinghamshire, at various places in eastern Kent, including Westbere, and, according to Ellwood, in Sussex.<br>
<br>Some time in the early 1650s Penington, feeling spiritually &#145;shattered&#146; and &#145;broken&#146;, left the Independents in search of inner peace, a quest he shared with his wife. Typically described as Seekers, they belonged to no group. The Muggletonian John Reeve wrote to Penington about this time. In 1656 Penington published his lengthy <span class="italic">Expositions with Observations on Several Scriptures</span>.<h2>
<a name="EarlyQuakeryears16581661"></a>Early Quaker years, 1658&#150;1661</h2>After reproving the Peningtons for their fashionable attire in 1657, an unidentified Quaker sent Thomas Curtis and William Simpson to visit them. Alexander Parker saw Penington at a Quaker meeting in Reading in February 1657, but not until May 1658 did Penington join the Friends after hearing George Fox speak at John Crook's home in Bedfordshire. The Grange soon became a hub of Quaker activity, and Fox held a meeting there in 1658. Reacting harshly to his son's convincement, the elder Penington threatened to disinherit him.<br>
<br>In his first Quaker publication, <span class="italic">The Way of Life and Death</span> (1658), Penington outlined his view of church history, according to which &#145;<i>the true state of Christianity</i>&#146; was lost after the apostolic period, though God preserved a remnant of the faithful; Penington looked forward to the overthrow of the anti-Christian Babylon and the recovery of the true faith through life in the Spirit  (p. 10). Anna Maria, Countess van Hoorn, translated the book into Dutch by 1661. Amplifying this theme in <span class="italic">Babylon the Great</span> (1659) he denounced Babylon, the spiritual fabric of evil and city of darkness, for its blasphemy, idolatry, spirit of witchcraft, and religious persecution. God, he proclaimed, is engaged in a controversy with England because of its adherence to Babylon. Where, he wondered in <span class="italic">The Scattered Sheep</span> (1659), were the praying people over whom a heathen spirit had descended? Distinguishing between human and divine faith in <span class="italic">The Axe Laid to the Root</span> (1659), he insisted that one must be guided by the light in one's soul, love simplicity, and live humbly to experience true religion. Those who ignore the inner light are like the ancient Jews, he contended in <span class="italic">The Jew Outward</span> (1659), for they commit the same errors, reject the doctrine of the new birth, and oppose Friends as the Jews rejected Christ.<br>
<br>Following the collapse of Richard Cromwell's government and the Rump's recall, on 18 May 1659 Penington wrote <span class="italic">To the Parliament, the Army, and All the Well-Affected</span>, accusing them of apostasy from the &#145;Good Old Cause&#146; because they committed blasphemy, overthrew God's work, and failed to relieve the poor. Parliament, he argued, had one final opportunity to undertake God's work. In <span class="italic">To the Army</span> [1659] he reflected that God had accomplished great things by and for the military, yet it had betrayed his cause and brought global reproach on his name. After Monck's army had marched into England, Penington announced in a broadside dated 19 January 1660, <span class="italic">Some Considerations Proposed</span>, that the time of reformation had arrived, and he exhorted people to &#145;run not out into parties&#146; but seek God. He published <span class="italic">A Question Propounded to the Rulers, Teachers, and People</span> on 14 February, asking how believers could belong to a church that still embodied the spirit of popery. In <span class="italic">Some Few Queries and Considerations Proposed to the Cavaliers</span> [1660] he pointedly enquired if their sufferings had been unjust in light of their previous persecution of the godly, their arbitrary rule, and the superfluity and evil ways of the court and gentry. Was not the cause of their opponents initially just?<br>
<br>Of the fourteen works he wrote in 1660, two&#151;<span class="italic">Some Queries Concerning the Work of God</span> and <span class="italic">A Warning of Love</span>&#151;were prophetic in tone, admonishing England for its adherence to false worship and religious persecution. Other publications were apologetic or controversial in nature. <span class="italic">A Brief Account of Some Reasons</span> explained the Friends' tenets to parliament, and <span class="italic">Where is the Wise?</span> explicated why the learned often opposed religious truth. Replying to Edmund Elys's defence of the <span class="roman">Book of Common Prayer</span>, Penington averred in <span class="italic">The Consideration of a Position</span> that genuine prayer comes only from the Spirit's &#145;breathings&#146;. In <span class="italic">The New-Covenant</span> and <span class="italic">An Epistle to All such as Observe the Seventh Day</span> he rejected the sabbatarian claims of William Saller and others on the grounds that Jesus had dispensed with the old covenant. Keenly interested in the conversion of the Jews, he hoped they would once again become God's people, a point he made in <span class="italic">Some Considerations Propounded to the Jewes</span>. In <span class="italic">The Root of Popery</span> he contrasted the churches of Christ and Antichrist, repudiated Catholic claims to infallibility, and associated protestant governments that engaged in religious persecution with Catholicism. When the government in Boston, New England, threatened Quakers with banishment or death, Penington came to their defence in <span class="italic">An Examination of the Grounds</span>, insisting Friends did not teach destructive tenets or foment disturbances, and affirming their belief in the Trinity, though depicting Christ as the eternal light who assumed a bodily &#145;garment&#146;. In <span class="italic">An Answer to that Common Objection</span> he offered to embrace all &#145;who suffered for the Testimony of a pure Conscience towards God&#146;, including John Hus and Martin Luther, but he insisted that God offers additional truth to each generation  (p. 1).<br>
<br>By February 1661 Penington was in the Aylesbury gaol, having been arrested at a meeting in his house. His confinement lasted seventeen weeks, during which he refused to take an oath, a position he defended in <span class="italic">The Great Question</span> (1661). While in prison he was visited by Ellwood, whom he and his wife had convinced two years earlier. Ellwood reported that more than sixty Friends were incarcerated with Penington, who was ill with distemper. From his cell he issued <span class="italic">Somewhat Spoken to a Weighty Question</span> (1661), espousing religious freedom and pacifism, though recognizing that magistrates can legitimately use force to protect people. While visiting Friends in the same prison on 17 September he wrote to Charles II, warning him not to provoke God. He was referring in part to religious oppression, which he denounced in <span class="italic">Concerning Persecution</span> [1661] as contrary to righteous government. Undeterred by the state's repression of dissent, he continued to write, expounding on the &#145;breathings&#146; of the spirit in <span class="italic">Some Directions to the Panting Soul</span> (1661) and <span class="italic">Concerning the Worship of the Living God</span> [1661], and using his experience to explain in <span class="italic">To All such as Complain</span> (1661) that divine power often manifests itself gradually in individuals. His continuing interest in the conversion of the Jews was evinced in <span class="italic">Some Questions and Answers</span> (1661).<h2>
<a name="Trialsandcontroversy16621671"></a>Trials and controversy, 1662&#150;1671</h2>Among Penington's works of 1662, <span class="italic">Three Queries Propounded to the King and Parliament</span> reminded readers that in the mid-century upheavals God had overturned the government and empowered men of low estate, and warned that he could do so again. No one, Penington insisted in <span class="italic">Some Observations</span> on <span class="roman">Romans</span> 14: 20, has the right to destroy God's work. Each person must fear God and obey his commandments, he explained in <span class="italic">Some Questions and Answers Showing Man his Duty</span>, by responding to the divinely implanted &#145;principle of life&#146; from which love, power, wisdom, and goodness spring. Nearly everything Penington wrote related to the spirit's workings and reflected his spiritual experience. &#145;I have had a very hard travel, and have felt [God's] power and cruelty beyond measure&#146;, he reflected in <span class="italic">Some of the Mysteries</span> (1663), &#145;yet the Lord my God hath helped me&#146;  (pp. 27&#150;8). He believed he was the recipient of divine messages, including one recorded in <span class="italic">Concerning God's Seeking out his Israel</span> (1663) regarding God's search for the lost sheep who had experienced the spirit's warmth but not entered the new covenant.<br>
<br>In <span class="italic">A Weighty Question</span> (1663), addressed to king and parliament, Penington asked whether they had the right to enforce laws people could not conscientiously obey. Unpersuaded, magistrates imprisoned him at Aylesbury for seventeen or eighteen weeks in 1664 for having attended a conventicle. In prison he wrote <span class="italic">Some Queries Concerning the Order and Government of the Church</span>, explicating the role of ministers and extolling unity. The topic was timely, for the Friends were experiencing tension over the schismatic John Perrot. Penington had been moved by Perrot's suffering in Rome and had provided hospitality for him in 1662. Perrot's opposition to the removal of hats during prayer had prompted criticism from leading Quakers, and Penington, dismayed by the strife, warned in <span class="italic">Many Deep Considerations</span> [1664?] that God might permit church leaders to fall, thereby endangering ordinary believers. Concerned, William Smith and Francis Howgill wrote to Penington, and Richard Farnworth sent him a paper denouncing Perrot's innovations. Penington accepted their counsel, including Howgill's request that he write nothing else critical of Quaker leaders.<br>
<br>For attending a Quaker funeral Penington was fined and imprisoned for a month at Aylesbury in March 1665. About May he was arrested again, this time at the behest of the earl of Bridgewater, who was offended because Penington had refused to address him as &#145;My lord&#146;. Released after nine months upon petition to the earl of Ancram, he was apprehended again about three weeks later and held in the Aylesbury gaol for a year and a half; he received his freedom about October 1667 after one of his wife's relatives obtained a writ of habeas corpus and had his case transferred to king's bench. These were difficult years, partly because of what Ellwood, who tutored the Penington children between 1662 and 1669, called &#145;the Tenderness of his Constitution&#146;  (Ellwood, 164). During Penington's nine-month imprisonment in 1665 the crown seized the Grange, forcing Mary and her children to find other lodgings, primarily at Bottrels in Chalfont and then, the following year, at Berrie House in Amersham.<br>
<br>During his imprisonments Penington's pen remained active, partly with letters to his wife, magistrates, relatives, Quaker meetings, and even Bridgewater explaining why he could not use worldly titles. Someone sent him one of Richard Baxter's writings, which he returned with the comment that Baxter had not directed sinners to the principle of spiritual life and power. In <span class="italic">One More Tender Visitation</span> (1666) Penington appealed for an end to the persecution of Quakers, whose core belief in the contrast between the seeds of the spirit and the flesh he expounded in <span class="italic">Concerning the Sum or Substance of our Religion</span> [1666]. A companion piece, <span class="italic">Concerning the Church</span> (1666), defined the true church as a spiritual body gathered out of the world in contrast to the apostate churches of Catholics and most protestants. Members of the true church have the &#145;Principle of Life&#146;, the &#145;Seed of the Kingdom&#146;, he explained in <span class="italic">Some Things of Great Weight</span> (1667). In <span class="italic">A Question to the Professors of Christianity</span> (1667) he asserted that only those who feel the spirit have religious certainty. He also addressed internal tensions among Quakers, cautioning them in an epistle, <span class="italic">To Friends</span> [1666], to beware of the enemy's efforts to foment prejudice against God's ministers and not to impose spiritual criteria that contradict the spirit's manifestation in others.<br>
<br>Penington's first post-imprisonment writings included counsel to those seeking spiritual life (<span class="italic">To such as are not Satisfied</span>, [1668]), a fuller exposition of his view of history (<span class="italic">Of the Church</span>, 1668), and advice to the Royal Society on attaining religious certainty by heeding the light in their consciences (<span class="italic">Some Things Relating to Religion</span>, 1668). He engaged in controversy with an unnamed Congregationalist (<span class="italic">Reply to Queries and Animadversions</span>, 1668, published posthumously) and Lodowick Muggleton (<span class="italic">Observations on some Passages</span>, 1668); the latter responded in <span class="italic">An Answer to Isaac Penington</span> (1669). Penington apparently wrote nothing in 1669, perhaps because he and his wife, assisted by Ellwood, were planning the extensive renovation of Woodside (1669&#150;<i>c</i>.1672), near Chalfont St Giles, which they acquired after selling the Westbere estate. About this time they sent their children to the Quaker school established by Fox at Waltham Abbey.<br>
<br>By May 1670 Penington was incarcerated at Reading, where he had gone to visit imprisoned Friends and had refused to take an oath. While in gaol he learned of the death of his son Isaac, lost at sea as he returned from Barbados. <span class="italic">A Salutation of Love</span> [1670], warning Buckinghamshire JPs of the imminent day of judgment, may have predated his incarceration, but at least seven works were composed during this twenty-one month confinement, including <span class="italic">Some Queries Concerning Compulsion in Religion</span> (1670), which reiterated the case for religious freedom. His account of the Friends was included in <span class="italic">Some Principles of the Elect People</span> (1671), to which Fox and others contributed. <span class="italic">A Treatise Concerning God's Teachings</span> (<i>c</i>.1671) is noteworthy because of its autobiographical section, elements of which are echoed in <span class="italic">A Few Experiences</span> (early 1672, published posthumously). Also published posthumously but completed in May 1671, <span class="italic">Life and Immortality</span> discusses the covenants, the ability of everyone to respond to the inner light, and other Quaker tenets. <span class="italic">An Enquiry after Truth</span> [1672], finished in April, optimistically claimed that spiritual darkness is fading. In <span class="italic">The Holy Truth</span> (1672) he replied to Sir Henry Vane, repudiating both the doctrine that God justifies sinners without regarding their moral state and the doctrine of perseverance.<h2>
<a name="Lastyears16721679"></a>Last years, 1672&#150;1679</h2>Following Isaac's release in early 1672 the Peningtons witnessed the marriage of Penn and Gulielma Springett on 4 April. About this year, they moved into Woodside. Penington returned to his favourite theme of the inner light in <span class="italic">The Ancient Principle</span> (1672), and in <span class="italic">The Naked Truth</span> (1674) he asserted its primacy over scripture. In <span class="italic">Judas and the Jews</span> (1673) he expressed remorse for having criticized the Quaker leadership in 1664. With Penn, Ellwood, George Whitehead, and George Keith he engaged in a series of debates with Thomas Hicks and other Baptists between 1672 and 1674, and this led to his refutation of Hicks's <span class="italic">A Continuation of the Dialogue</span> (1673) in <span class="italic">The Flesh &amp; Blood of Christ</span> (1675). During the 1670s he and other prominent Friends participated in the religious circle of Anne, Viscountess Conway, at Ragley Hall, Warwickshire, with Henry More and Francis van Helmont. When the Quakers were riven by the Story&#150;Wilkinson dispute over the movement's institutionalization, Penington, siding with Fox, wrote to John Story on 21 September 1676, castigating him as stiff, exalted, and selfish, and he attempted, unsuccessfully, to persuade Curtis that something was &#145;deeply amiss inwardly&#146; when he supported Story  (Penington MSS, 4.141).<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">To the Jews Natural, and to the Jews Spiritual</span> (1677) reiterated Penington's hope for the conversion of the Jewish people and depicted the saints as spiritual Jews. In September, while taking the waters at Astrop, Northamptonshire, he completed <span class="italic">The Everlasting Gospel</span> (1678), in which he professed not to dislike Catholics (his brother Arthur was a Catholic priest), Turks, and Jews, though he mourned their &#145;Mistakes&#146;  (p. 6). Two months later, in <span class="italic">Concerning the Dispensation of the Gospel</span> (1678), he expounded the completion of the work of redemption, the translation of souls into the eternal kingdom, and their union with God. In July 1679 he explicated the doctrine of spirit-baptism in <span class="italic">A Reply to an Answer</span>, and at the month's end he reflected on his religious pilgrimage in <span class="italic">Some Experiences</span>, noting his feeling of certainty and sense of the spirit's infallibility. <span class="italic">Concerning the Times and Seasons</span>, composed in August at Meresborough, Kent, depicted history in terms of contrasting periods of joy (for example the creation and the promise of the blessed seed) and misery (the fall and the flood). While he and Mary were visiting their tenants in Kent Penington died at Goodnestone Court on 8 October, after a week's illness. He was interred later that month in the Quakers' burial-ground at Jordans, near Chalfont St Giles, with hundreds of Friends and neighbours in attendance.<br>
<br>In her testimony Mary Penington remarked that no husband surpassed his kindness, tenderness, and love, and Fox recalled that Penington had undergone &#145;many Exercises, and Tryals, and Temptations, and Snares, both by them that were without, and False brethren&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works of &hellip; Isaac Penington</span>, sig. a2<i>v</i>). Fox was undoubtedly grateful that Penington had retracted his 1664 plea for broader toleration within the movement, and that in later years he had stood with the other leaders in deploring the divisions associated with Story and Curtis. According to Ellwood, Penington spent much of his time visiting Friends, ministering, reading the <span class="roman">Bible</span>, and waiting on the spirit, a key theme in his publications. He undoubtedly envisioned writing as a major part of his Quaker vocation, though his approximately ninety works (thirteen of them from his pre-Quaker period) are redundant and sometimes disjointed. His mystical approach to religion has led some commentators to suggest that he was influenced by Plotinus and Jacob Boehme, but there is no firm evidence of this. The leading proponent of a contemplative life among the Friends, he stressed the importance of meditation and self-denial. His Christology has sparked debate, for he downplayed the role of Christ's humanity while exalting that of the spirit. He suffered his imprisonments with equanimity, and apparently made no use of his legal training to obtain release. A number of his works were published posthumously for the first time, some of them in the two-volume folio edition of 1681. The most recent edition (1994&#150;7), based on an 1863 American edition, is incomplete. His son John's transcriptions of his correspondence are preserved in the Friends' Library, London.<br>
<br>Penington's youngest son, <a name="cosubject_21839"></a><span class="headword">Edward Penington</span>  (1667&#150;1701), <span class="occ">Quaker colonist</span>, was born on 3 September 1667 at Amersham. He was tutored at home by Thomas Ellwood and others until 1680, after which he was educated at Edmonton. One of the first purchasers of land in Pennsylvania, he was appointed surveyor-general of the colony on 26 April 1698, and arrived in Philadelphia with Penn on 30 November of that year. On 16 November 1699 he married Sarah (<i>b</i>. 1679), daughter of Samuel Jennings, governor of New Jersey, and his wife, Ann (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Olliffe, or Olive); together they had one child, Isaac. The author of tracts defending the Friends against Keith and Thomas Crisp, Edward died, probably of smallpox, in Philadelphia on 11 November 1701.<br>
