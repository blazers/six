<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Cooper,  Thomas</span>  (1759&#150;1839), <span class="occ">political writer and college head</span>, was born in Westminster on 22 October 1759, the son of Thomas Cooper, who was entitled to bear heraldic arms. He matriculated from University College, Oxford, in February 1779, but did not take a degree; well known in later life as a freethinker, he is said to have refused to sign the <span class="roman">Thirty-Nine Articles</span>. He attended anatomical lectures in London during the summer of 1780 and subsequently took a clinical course at the Middlesex Hospital. In the same year he entered into a partnership of calico printers at Raikes, near Bolton, and about 10 miles from Manchester. The register of alumni of Oxford states that in 1787 he became a barrister from the Inner Temple, but his name does not occur on its list of graduates. He travelled the northern circuit, which included Lancashire, between 1787 and 1790. By 1785 he was living south of Manchester at Woodheys, Altrincham, Cheshire, but later removed to Lever Hall, Bolton, which placed him nearer the dye works. He was married to Alice Greenwood in St George's parish, Hanover Square, London, several years before settling in Lancashire. They had five children before her death in October 1800.<br>
<br>In early adulthood Cooper distinguished himself as a humanitarian thinker and a philosophical radical. In 1787 he published <span class="italic">Letters on the Slave Trade</span>, an essay denouncing slavery as &#145;the most diabolical exertion of political tyranny, which the annals of oppression can exhibit an instance of&#146;  (p. 4). That same year he published <span class="italic">Propositions Respecting the Foundation of Civil Government</span>, a paper asserting that government had originated in the consent of the people who retained in perpetuity a right to alter the government at their will. As vice-president of the Manchester Literary and Philosophical Society and a founder member of the Manchester Constitutional Society, he befriended Thomas Walker, Samuel Jackson, James Watt jun., and others who were to join him in the ill-fated parliamentary reform movement. He also carried on a vigorous correspondence with the notorious radical John Horne Tooke. In the spring of 1792, while in Paris on business together with James Watt jun., son of the inventor, he was requested to establish contact with the revolutionary societies of France on behalf of the Manchester Constitutional Society. He and Watt duly paid a visit on Robespierre and the Jacobins, which earned them a rebuke in parliament from Edmund Burke. Upon his return to England Cooper published his <span class="italic">Reply to Mr. Burke's Invective</span>, a scathing attack on hereditary government in the spirit of Thomas Paine's better-known <span class="italic">The Rights of Man</span>. &#145;Kings and Nobles&#146;, Cooper wrote, &#145;have flourished at the expense of the People, who have been universally regarded merely as the Footstools of their pride, and the means of their gratification&#146;. He went on to prescribe a democratic remedy: &#145;If the good of the People &hellip; is to be the Object of Government, THEY MUST BE THEIR OWN GOVERNORS&#151;they must adopt, <i>in fact</i>, the government of the MANY by the MANY&#146;  (Cooper, <span class="italic">Reply to Mr. Burke's Invective</span>, 13, 28).<br>
<br>In 1793, discouraged by official repression of reform in England, Cooper paid an initial visit to America with an eye towards possible resettlement. While he was away, his calico-printing firm was forced into bankruptcy by its creditors. In 1794, his fortunes at a low ebb, he and a friend, the renowned scientist Joseph Priestley, quit their native country for Pennsylvania and together settled their families in Northumberland county. Unlike Priestley, who had lost all taste for public controversy, Cooper soon re-entered political life in the service of the Jeffersonian party working in close association with newspaper editor William Duane and lawyer A. J. Dallas, later to be secretary of the treasury under James Madison. A polemical tract targeting President John Adams, head of the rival Federalist Party, resulted in his prosecution for libel under the sedition law in the spring of 1800 and earned him a short stay in the Philadelphia gaol. He was later rewarded by his party with public office, serving first as a land commissioner and after 1804 as president judge of one of the state's common pleas districts. When the state party split over legal reform, he sided against the radical faction that wanted to open the practice of law to persons without formal training and to make judges subject to popular election. In 1811 his opponents succeeded in having him removed from the bench. The experience led him to conclude that popular democracy was &#145;not quite so perfect in practice as it is beautiful in theory&#146;  (Cooper, <span class="italic">Narrative</span>, 6). He expanded his critique of democracy in a letter dated July 1815 which circulated privately among his friends. &#145;Experience has taught us all&#146;, he lamented, &#145;that there is a perpetual and almost irresistible inclination among the people to cheat themselves, and to be cajoled and cheated by others&#146;. Contemptuous of the &#145;aristocracy of talent&#146;, popular opinion, he wrote, was &#145;harsh and violent, as well as unreflecting: prone to sacrifice its friends to its flatterers, and to commit injustice in the wantonness of power, as well as through mistake or resentment&#146;  (extract of a letter to a student at law, Madison MSS, 76.4).<br>
<br>Cooper became professor of chemistry at Carlisle College in 1812. Four years later he moved to the University of Pennsylvania. His friend Thomas Jefferson subsequently invited him to join the faculty at the University of Virginia, but Cooper's philosophical materialism and obvious contempt for religious establishments made him unacceptable to the state legislature. In 1819 he moved to Columbia, South Carolina, as professor of chemistry at South Carolina College. The following year he was named president of the college, and although his tenure was plagued by opposition from the community on account of his controversial religious opinions, he retained the support of the board of trustees until his retirement in 1834. Not long after his arrival in Columbia he was again enmeshed in political controversy. During the Anglo-American War of 1812&#150;14 he had supported a protective tariff; however, in the 1820s he rallied to the defence of <i>laissez-faire</i>. High tariffs on imported goods designed to protect the infant industries of the north were a sore point with the southern states, whose economic well-being depended on agricultural exports to Britain. Adopting the southern point of view, he denounced the tariff as a grave political threat that &#145;forebode no good to Union&#146;. The protectionists, he wrote, sought unfair advantage: &#145;Their object is monopoly; to make the farmer sell at the manufacturer's price, and buy at the manufacturer's price.&#146; His condemnation of northern manufacturing interests anticipated the critique of capitalism levelled at a later date by George Fitzhugh, the famous apologist for slavery. Like Fitzhugh, he deplored the effects of factory labour on the working man and complained that it was immoral &#145;to increase the wealth of a few capitalists, at the expense of the health, life, morals, and happiness of the wretches who labour for them&#146;  (Cooper, <span class="italic">On the Proposed Alteration of the Tariff</span>, 5, 11). In a less polemical vein, he also wrote <span class="italic">Lectures on the Elements of Political Economy</span>, an influential textbook espousing the doctrine of <i>laissez-faire</i>. The tariff controversy came to a head in 1832 when a special convention in South Carolina declared the new federal import duties null and void within the state. The nullification crisis was ultimately defused by a timely act of congress that lowered the tariff and at the same time affirmed the supremacy of the federal government. Cooper remained dissatisfied, however, and recommended in 1834 that the southern states contemplate secession from the union in order to protect their interests, including black slavery, which he now defended as a just and necessary institution. He is best remembered today as the &#145;schoolmaster of state's rights&#146; to the generation of South Carolinians that fought the American Civil War.<br>
<br>Over the course of his life Cooper published numerous books and essays on a wide variety of topics, including (in addition to politics) metaphysics, religion, science, economics, and law. His legal writings include a treatise on the bankruptcy law of America compared with that of England (1801), the first American edition of the <span class="italic">Institutes of Justinian, with Notes</span> (1812), <span class="italic">Tracts on Medical Jurisprudence</span> (1819), and a <span class="italic">Treatise on the Law of Libel and the Liberty of the Press</span> (1830). He devoted his last years to a revision of <span class="italic">The Statutes at Large of South Carolina</span> (5 vols., 1836&#150;9). He died in Columbia on 11 May 1839 and was buried in the Guignard plot, Trinity churchyard, Columbia.<br>
