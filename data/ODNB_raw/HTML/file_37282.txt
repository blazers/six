<span class="headword">Churchill <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Jerome]</span>,  Jeanette <span class="st"> [Jennie; </span></span> <span class="st"> Lady Randolph Churchill]</span>  (1854&#150;1921), <span class="occ">society hostess and writer</span>, was born in Brooklyn, New York, on 9 January 1854, the second of four daughters of Leonard Jerome, American sportsman and speculator, of New York, and his wife, Clarissa, daughter of Ambrose Hall, landowner and sometime assemblyman of the New York legislature. Their second daughter was christened Jeanette but known as Jennie after the singer Jennie Lind.<br>
<br>On 15 April 1874, at the British embassy in Paris, she married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5404/', "Lord Randolph Henry Spencer Churchill (1849&#150;1895)")</script>, politician, third son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5403/', "John Winston Spencer Churchill, seventh duke of Marlborough")</script>. They had two sons, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32413/', "Winston Leonard Spencer Churchill (1874&#150;1965)")</script> and John Strange Churchill (1880&#150;1947). Her relationship to her famous son Winston was affectionate but distant. Absorbed in the complexities of her own affairs, she played little part in the development of his early career. On her death he wrote of her, &#145;on the whole it was a life of sunshine&#146;  (Soames, 200).<br>
<br>During the early 1880s Lady Randolph supported her husband's political career, electioneering on his behalf, being active in the Primrose League, and entertaining imaginatively (she claimed to have invented &#145;the dinner party of deadly enemies&#146;). Privately, the marriage was faltering, not least because of Lord Randolph's syphilis, about which he informed her and which he does not seem to have transmitted to her. Lady Randolph acquired a number of romantic attachments; the most serious was with Count Kinsky, a diplomatist in the Austro-Hungarian embassy in London. She became known as &#145;Lady Jane Snatcher&#146; and, before learning the tricks of discretion, achieved considerable notoriety  (Manchester, 136).<br>
<br>After Lord Randolph's death from syphilis in 1895 his widow began a career in her own right. She was not squeamish about using her considerable social influence in support of her son Winston; she pressed his writing on publishers, sought for favourable reviewers, and appealed directly to the third marquess of Salisbury, then prime minister, to permit him to join the expedition to the Sudan under Sir H. Herbert Kitchener.<br>
<br>In 1899 Lady Randolph founded and edited the <span class="italic">Anglo-Saxon Review</span>; in spite of its contributors and its handsome binding, this monthly magazine was overpriced at a guinea, had no theme, and failed after ten issues. At the outbreak of the South African War in 1899, she chaired a committee of American women which obtained and equipped a hospital ship, the <i>Maine</i>; she sailed to South Africa on its maiden voyage. On her return, on 28 July 1900, she married George Frederick Myddelton Cornwallis-West (1874&#150;1951), an officer of the Scots Guards, who was a fortnight older than her elder son. He was the son of William Cornwallis Cornwallis-West, of Ruthin Castle, Denbighshire. The marriage was not universally welcomed; however, the couple acquired Salisbury Hall, near St Albans, where they entertained with panache: their guests included Edward VII and his entourage.<br>
<br>In 1908 she published <span class="italic">The Reminiscences of Lady Randolph Churchill by Mrs Cornwallis-West</span>, which was modestly successful in both Britain and America. She wrote a play, <span class="italic">His Borrowed Plumes</span>, which was performed in 1909 with Mrs Patrick Campbell as director and leading lady. Cornwallis-West became enamoured of Mrs Campbell; this was the effective end of his marriage, although his wife did not divorce him until 1913, when she reverted to the name of Lady Randolph Churchill.<br>
<br>During the war of 1914&#150;18 she presided over the American Women's War Hospital in Paignton, and served personally in a hospital at Lancaster Gate in London. She wrote articles for <span class="italic">Pearson's Weekly</span> which were later published as <span class="italic">Small Talks on Big Subjects</span> (1916).<br>
<br>On 1 June 1918 she married Montagu Phippen Porch (1877&#150;1964), the son of Reginald Porch, of The Abbey, Glastonbury, Somerset. He was a colonial official serving in Nigeria; he was then forty-one and she was sixty-four. &#145;He has a future&#146;, she remarked, &#145;and I have a past, so we should be all right&#146;  (Churchill and Mitchell, 260). She did not take his name, nor did she return with him to Nigeria, but the marriage was placidly successful. &#145;My second marriage was romantic but not successful; my third marriage was successful but not romantic.&#146; At the end of the war Porch resigned from the colonial service; in 1921 he returned to Africa, in search of a fortune. During his absence, Lady Randolph fell downstairs while visiting friends in Somerset, breaking her ankle. Gangrene set in, and her leg was amputated. She died suddenly at home, 8 Westbourne Street, London, after a haemorrhage of an artery in the thigh, on 29 June 1921. She was buried in Bladon near Woodstock, Oxfordshire, next to her first husband. Edward Marsh wrote of her:<blockquote>She was an incredible and most delightful compound of flagrant worldliness and eternal childhood, in thrall to fashion and luxury (life didn't begin for her on a basis of less than forty pairs of shoes) yet never sacrificing one human quality of warm-heartedness, humour, loyalty, sincerity, or steadfast and pugnacious courage. (Marsh, 154)</blockquote>
