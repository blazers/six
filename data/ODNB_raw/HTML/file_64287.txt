<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Winterhalter,  Franz Xaver <span class="st"> [Francis Xavier]</span></span>  (1805&#150;1873), <span class="occ">painter</span>, was born on 20 April 1805 in the village of Menzenschwand in the Black Forest in Baden-W&uuml;rttemberg, the sixth of eight children of Fidel Winterhalter (1773&#150;1863) and his wife, Eva Mayer (<i>b</i>. 1764/5). His father had various occupations, including selling watches, seasonal resin producing, and farming. Known in his youth as Xaver, Winterhalter, brought up a Roman Catholic, attended the local parish school, where Father Joseph Lieber taught him, encouraging an interest in the arts. Both he and his younger brother Hermann (1808&#150;1891) showed early artistic talent, and through Lieber Winterhalter obtained patronage from Baron Eichtal, a well-to-do factory owner from a banking family. This sponsorship prompted speculation that Eichtal was Winterhalter's natural father.<h2>
<a name="Youthandearlycareer"></a>Youth and early career</h2>In 1818, aged thirteen and funded by his patron, Winterhalter left his village to study in Freiburg im Breisgau near the French border. With a view to working as an illustrator and engraver, he served an apprenticeship in drawing and engraving in the studio of Karl Ludwig von Schuler (1785&#150;1852), who was soon appointed director of the Herdersche Kunstinstitut. Winterhalter attended this art school (somewhat unhappily, as he suffered bullying), remaining until 1823. His brother also enrolled in 1819. Some of Winterhalter's earliest known works, dating from 1818&#150;19, include careful copies after antique plaster casts, studies of animals, and copperplate engravings.<br>
<br>In Munich by 1823, Winterhalter worked at printmaking, contributing lithographs to periodical publications. In 1824 he received a grant to study at the Munich Academy of Art, where Robert von Langer (1783&#150;1846) provided some teaching; however, it seems that Winterhalter found academic methods less than congenial. He also joined the studio of Josef Karl Stieler, a miniaturist and portrait painter in oils who had studied with G&eacute;rard in Paris, and who was court painter to Ludwig I of Bavaria. Stieler's life and work influenced Winterhalter's career, for the older artist's glamorous, French-based neo-classical style enabled Winterhalter to portray society figures in a flattering fashion, evident in his famous series of beauties at the court of Ludwig painted from 1827 onward for the Sch&ouml;nheitsgalerie (now at Schloss Nymphenburg, Munich).<br>
<br>In 1825 Winterhalter received a pension of 200 florins from the grand duke of Baden with the stipulation that he submit one drawing each year. With this necessary patronage, in 1827 he travelled, from his base in Munich, around Germany to study. In 1829, again through the court at Baden, he was appointed drawing-master to Sophie Guillemette, grand duchess of Baden. In 1830 Winterhalter moved to Karlsruhe, where the court was located, executing portraits there, including an early self-portrait drawing. He found favour with Grand Duke Leopold, who partly funded a bursary so that he could travel to Italy in late 1832. Winterhalter spent over a year in Rome, sketching local scenes and producing some oil paintings of Italian genre subjects then fashionable. He mixed in the circle centred on the well-known Caff&egrave; Greco. It included the painter Horace Vernet, who as director of the French Academy in Rome may well have provided an entr&eacute;e into Parisian society. The trip indicated that Winterhalter had higher ambitions than solely producing portraits for his homeland.<h2>
<a name="Royalpatronage"></a>Royal patronage</h2>Winterhalter returned to Karlsruhe in 1834, after being appointed court painter to Grand Duke Leopold, but by the end of the year he had moved to Paris, almost immediately sending a painting of a woman's head to the Salon of 1835. His next exhibits were large-scale subject paintings: <span class="italic">Il dolce far niente</span> (1835; ex Christies, London, 17 June 1994) was awarded a second-class medal and sold from the Salon to the dealer Auguste Asse; <span class="italic">The Decameron</span> (1836) followed in 1837, selling for 10,000 francs and gaining a first-class medal. These effortlessly composed group scenes, based on literary subjects, reveal the artist's ease in the stage management of his figures. The success of the works assured Winterhalter a prolonged stay in France, with patronage for portraits immediately following from the king, Louis Philippe. He received the further accolade of the L&eacute;gion d'honneur in May 1839 and was raised to chevalier in 1857. The portrait of Louis Philippe (1839; Versailles, Mus&eacute;e National du Ch&acirc;teau de Versailles et du Trianon); is without the flattery Winterhalter accorded to his female sitters.<br>
<br>To deal with the influx of new commissions Winterhalter apparently took on pupils such as the Swede Olaf Johan Sodermark in the late 1830s, along with later assistants such as Albert Graeffle and Louis Coblitz. Winterhalter's brother Hermann worked with him, handling the business side of this increasing portrait practice and later assisting in the production of copies. A sensitive double portrait by Winterhalter of himself and Hermann in 1840 testifies to the closeness of their relationship.<br>
<br>Winterhalter met with great success with the Belgian royal family, with portraits of Leopold I, king of the Belgians, and Queen Louise-Marie (Royal Collections, Belgium). Through a recommendation from the queen of the Belgians Winterhalter came to the attention of Queen Victoria as early as 1838. The young Queen Victoria greatly valued the opinion of her uncle Leopold and his wife on artistic matters, so she was favourably predisposed to Winterhalter even before meeting him, acquiring several of his works during the late 1830s. However, it would seem that her marriage in 1840 to Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, who heard of the d&eacute;b&acirc;cle surrounding the state portrait of the queen by David Wilkie and who grew dissatisfied with the queen's official portrait painter, George Hayter, led to a search for an unofficial replacement. Prince Albert seems to have approved of an invitation to Winterhalter to visit England and the artist went on to produce approximately 120 oil paintings for the royal couple over the next twenty-five years.<h2>
<a name="ArrivalinBritain"></a>Arrival in Britain</h2>In early summer 1842 Winterhalter arrived in Britain to paint commissioned portraits of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert. The appeal of these early three-quarter length portraits (Royal Collection) secured further work for the artist, not least the many repetitions and variations of the queen's portrait. He produced a new, full-length, state portrait in mid-1843. In the queen's opinion, he invariably secured a good likeness yet also managed to animate his portraits, never producing images that were too formal or stiff. This recipe also recommended the artist wherever imposing yet lifelike and pleasing portraits were required, as in court circles in Europe. He worked to deadlines, reliably completing work on time. John Gilbert's view of Winterhalter painting in the throne room shows him at work surrounded by royal children and with court ladies in attendance, an indication, perhaps, of his relaxed manner and easy-going personality.<br>
<br>Winterhalter's role as court painter to Louis Philippe and his unofficial role at the British court meant that he painted many ceremonial scenes in both large and small scale, in both oils and watercolours. He was just as likely to be found on board the British royal yacht quickly painting a watercolour of the French royal family departing in September 1843 as he was to be included in royal tours to record family gatherings. The group portrait of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert with the family of King Louis Philippe at the Ch&acirc;teau d'Eu (1845; Royal Collection) demonstrates his skill in composing a group which, owing to the variety in poses employed and the interest of the setting, avoids monotony.<br>
<br>Winterhalter spent part of each year in Britain, usually about two months, working for Queen Victoria. By 1846 he had been commissioned to produce a group portrait of the royal family on a large scale for the substantial price of 1000 guineas (Royal Collection). This painting conveys the unity of the royal family in a harmoniously composed group with the five children each characterized in lively fashion. The queen called it a &#145;<i>chef d'&#339;uvre</i>&#151;like a Paul Veronese, such beautiful, brilliant, fresh colouring&#151;and we were enchanted&#146;  (Lloyd, 70). As a new addition to royal iconography the work enjoyed great public success as well as a special exhibition at St James's Palace accorded to the artist in May and June 1847. This rare event was attended by 98,000 visitors but it did not endear Winterhalter to the British art community.<br>
<br>To Queen Victoria Winterhalter was a &#145;personal, attached&#146; friend  (Millar, <span class="italic">Victorian Pictures</span>, xxvii) and he visited the royal family at their private retreat, Osborne House, Isle of Wight, and spent much time teaching the queen oil painting techniques. She commented in June 1851 that Winterhalter was &#145;so kind, and shews me everything so patiently, though at the same time, he is strict&#146;  (Roberts, 110). When Winterhalter was asked to portray the shared birthday of the duke of Wellington and the one-year-old baby, Prince Arthur, in <span class="italic">The First of May 1851</span> (Royal Collection), Prince Albert suggested that the painting be based on the theme of the adoration of the magi, and the work shows the duke making an offering to the infant. The date also refers to the opening of the Great Exhibition&#151;shown in the background&#151;towards which Prince Albert is looking over his shoulder. As the title suggests, Winterhalter adopted a historical treatment of these concurrent events. More often, however, he portrayed the royal children in a variety of unusual settings (such as the landscape around Balmoral) and in costume. Apart from portraits, Winterhalter was much in demand for surprise paintings intended as presents between the royal couple. The so-called secret portrait of the queen in 1842, showing her informally with her hair undressed, was Albert's favourite image of his wife; she also gave to him Winterhalter's massive nude group, <span class="italic">Florinda</span> (Royal Collection), for which she paid &pound;1000 in 1852 and which was exhibited at the Royal Academy in the same year.<br>
<br>Winterhalter avoided the upheaval of the revolution in France in 1848 by decamping to Brussels, Geneva, and then England: as a cautious and conservative individual, he was deeply affected by the horrors of these turbulent times. He returned to France at the end of 1849, and by 1853 he was painting for the new French royal family, Napoleon III and Empress Eug&eacute;nie. The years about 1850 were dominated by work in Britain and then by travel to Spain in 1852 and Poland in 1856. In 1854 he became <i>peintre attitr&eacute;</i> to the court of Napoleon III. Winterhalter had a particular insight into Empress Eug&eacute;nie: her devotion to the spirit of Marie Antoinette and her aspiration to be a leader in matters of style and taste, best exemplified by Winterhalter's group portrait <span class="italic">The Empress Surrounded by her Ladies in Waiting</span> (1855; Mus&eacute;e National du Ch&acirc;teau, Compi&egrave;gne).<h2>
<a name="Characterandlatercareer"></a>Character and later career</h2>Winterhalter's personality is elusive: Eug&egrave;ne Delacroix considered him &#145;not a bad fellow, but a terrible bore&#146;  (Ormond and Blackett-Ord, 49). His capacity for understanding women, conveyed in his best portraiture, did not apparently extend to his personal life. An engagement arranged for him by his friend the architect Karl Josef Berckmuller in June 1852 with Marie Scheffel in Karlsruhe was broken by July. He travelled constantly throughout the 1850s, but wishing to settle in Baden, where he had early success, he had a residence built by 1861, the Villa Trianon, Friedrichsgasse. By 1862, however, he had sold it. He continued to base himself in Paris with a studio on the rue de La Rochefoucauld and a residence on the rue de la Chauss&eacute;e d'Antin; he amassed a modest collection of old master and modern paintings.<br>
<br>Winterhalter continued to visit Britain. He produced new state portraits in 1858&#150;9 showing the mature Queen Victoria and Prince Albert (Royal Collection). After Prince Albert's death Queen Victoria was less active as a patron of the arts; as Winterhalter was himself ageing, she turned to other younger talents, always retaining affection for him even with &#145;all his peculiarities&#146;  (Ormond and Blackett-Ord, 64). Even after his death she still claimed that &#145;All these great artists Angeli, Richter etc. cannot throw that life and lightness and animation into a portrait that dear old Winterhalter could&#146;  (<span class="italic">Victoria</span>, 238, 6 Jan 1875). However, the English critics still rejected his art outright: Ruskin called him &#145;a dim blockhead&#146;  (Millar, <span class="italic">Victorian Pictures</span>, xxvii) and J. B. Atkinson dismissed him as a purveyor of &#145;confectionary art&#146; in 1862  (<span class="italic">Blackwood</span>, 357). His technique in particular was alien to English taste, and a reviewer of the Royal Academy exhibition of 1856 found that his &#145;low tints are extremely impure; they are deficient in natural transparency&#146;  (<span class="italic">Art Journal</span>, 1856, 165).<br>
<br>In his later years Winterhalter painted some of his most sumptuous portraits of European society women, such as <span class="italic">Mme. Rimsky Korsakov</span> (1863; Mus&eacute;e d'Orsay, Paris). His international stature was recognized with a request for a self-portrait from the Uffizi in Florence (1867). With the onset of the Franco-Prussian War Winterhalter retired in poor health to Karlsruhe in 1871. After contracting typhus he died on 8 July 1873, at the Diakonissen Krankenhaus, Frankfurt am Main, and was buried in Frankfurt am Main cemetery. Retrospective exhibitions followed in Frankfurt and Baden. His will, made only a few days before his death, included the bizarre request that twelve preselected, unexhibited paintings be locked away for fifty years and then submitted to the artistic judgement of a future generation. No one acceded to this request.<br>
<br>Winterhalter served his royal and aristocratic patrons well by accommodating himself to their whims, with the result that his own painting style served to flatter them in beautifully stage-managed and carefully lit portrayals, with little evidence of delving beneath the surfaces. His lifetime of compliance to patrons provided a comfortable livelihood, but he clearly felt posterity would judge him as a more rounded and accomplished artist.<br>
