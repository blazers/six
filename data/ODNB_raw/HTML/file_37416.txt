<span class="headword">Fitch, Sir  Thomas</span>, first baronet  (<em>bap. </em>1637, <em>d.</em> 1688), <span class="occ">building contractor</span>, was born in Barkway, Hertfordshire, the second son (the first died in infancy and there was also a daughter) of William Fitch and his wife, Alice, and baptized on 17 December 1637. Nothing is known of his early years, though he seems to have been occupied initially as a bricklayer. He is first recorded in April 1663, engaged on the brickwork of Sir Ralph Bankes's house at Kingston Lacy, Dorset, designed by Sir Roger Pratt. It was the great fire of London in 1666 which gave him his opening, however, and he became a prominent figure in the rebuilding of the city over the next decade.<br>
<br>Fitch's most important contract (first with a carpenter, John Ball, and then on his own) was for the deepening and wharfing of the Fleet ditch, an enormous task which employed two hundred men, took two and a half years to finish (1672&#150;4), and brought him a gift of plate worth &pound;200 from the City on its efficient completion. His other London projects included the stairs of Blackfriars and Three Cranes, the laystalls at Dowgate and Puddle Dock, wharfing at Whitefriars, and the imposing great storehouse at the Tower. Outside London, his major contract was the execution (with his brother John Fitch) of the ambitious designs of Sir Bernard de Gomme for new fortifications in Portsmouth, where he also built the garrison hospital. He was employed on the reconstruction of the bishop of Winchester's palace at Wolvesey, and he acted from time to time as architect as well as builder. He probably designed the court house in Windsor which was completed by Sir Christopher Wren after his death.<br>
<br>Fitch's prosperity is shown by the &#145;magnificent dwelling house&#146; which he built for himself on the north Thames frontage immediately to the east of the Fleet Canal. At the time of his death he also owned the country seat of Mount Mascall, in North Cray, Kent. He was elected sheriff for Kent in 1679 and knighted in the same year. On 7 September 1688 he was created a baronet by James II, but died nine days later on 16 September. He was buried at St Anne Blackfriars. He was survived by his wife, Anne, daughter and heir of Richard Comport, of Eltham, and a son, Comport (<i>b</i>. 1676), who succeeded him in the baronetcy.<br>
