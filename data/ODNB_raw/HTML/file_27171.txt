<span class="headword">Neuhoff,  Theodor Stefan  von</span>, Baron von Neuhoff  (1694&#150;1756), <span class="occ">king of Corsica</span>, was born in Cologne on 24 August 1694, second child and only son of Anton, Baron von Neuhoff (<i>d</i>. 1695), of a Westphalian family, and Amelia, the daughter of a draper of Viseu near Li&egrave;ge. The origin of the family's baronial title has not been found. Finding himself <i>d&eacute;class&eacute;</i> by this match, Anton had given up an appointment in the service of the bishop of M&uuml;nster and moved away from his ancestral area of the county of Mark. Shortly after his son's birth he died, leaving a modest estate of 11,000 florins; his widow then married a customs official at Metz called Marneau and had another daughter, who was later the wife of a parliamentary counsel at Metz called Gom&eacute;-Delagrange.<br>
<br>Theodor von Neuhoff seems to have been brought up at first by a relation on his father's side before being sent at the age of ten to the Jesuit school in M&uuml;nster. After some years there, in 1709 or before, he became a page to Elisabeth Charlotte of the Palatinate, duchess of Orl&eacute;ans (known generally as Madame), at Versailles. On her recommendation he was later commissioned in the army of the elector of Bavaria; contracting heavy gambling debts, however, he evaded his creditors and went to Paris to lodge with his sister, now countess de Tr&eacute;voux. According to a report relayed by Madame, his stay there was abruptly terminated by an argument in which he tried to kill his brother-in-law, and he again fled, this time to London. The other sources on Neuhoff's early life are silent on this affair, ascribing his departure to the pressure of further debts.<br>
<br>By 1716 Neuhoff had entered the service of the Swedish minister in the Netherlands, Baron Goertz. When Goertz was executed in March 1719, Neuhoff was on a mission for him to Cardinal Alberoni in Spain, and chose to remain there, obtaining a commission in a Spanish regiment through the influence of the powerful minister Ripperda.<br>
<br>It was at about this time that Neuhoff is stated to have married &#145;Lady Sarsfield&#146;, the daughter of an Irish peer at the Spanish court, &#145;Lord Kilmallock&#146;. This would most naturally mean a daughter of David Sarsfield (killed 1710), titular Viscount Sarsfield of Kilmallock (the title had in fact been forfeit since 1691), a colonel of dragoons in the Spanish service and governor of Badajoz. However, Ruvigny, in his <span class="italic">Jacobite Peerage</span>, suggested that she was a daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/24671/', "Patrick Sarsfield")</script>, who was created earl of Lucan by the exiled James II in 1691; his son James Sarsfield, Jacobite second earl of Lucan (1693&#150;1719), was also in Spanish service. The marriage did not last long, as in 1720 Neuhoff abandoned his pregnant wife in the Escorial (in some accounts, taking her jewels with him) and went to Paris. His wife may have followed him there; a manifesto issued (apparently by Neuhoff himself) in Cologne in 1740 states that she died in Paris in 1724, in childbed of a daughter who also died. Whether there is any truth in this, and if so whether the daughter was Neuhoff's, is unclear, as the sources imply that he stayed only a brief while in Paris. According to the letters of the duchess of Orl&eacute;ans, he once again absconded from his sister's house, this time with 200,000 livres of her husband's money.<br>
<br>Between 1720 and 1732 Neuhoff is said to have travelled a great deal, being at least twice in London and several times in Italy, occasionally using the pseudonym Etienne Romberg. In 1732 he was in Genoa, at a time of great tension between that republic and its recalcitrant possession Corsica. According to one account he achieved a semi-official status as intermediary between the Corsican agents at Leghorn and the Genoese authorities. This undoubtedly exaggerates his role, although he was certainly known to the leaders of the Corsican party from this date. Corsican sources state that Neuhoff presented himself at this stage as an English nobleman, and encouraged inferences that he was acting on behalf of the British authorities. His only connections with Britain at this time were his occasional letters to George II recounting Jacobite activity and his own strenuous efforts to prevent it.<br>
<br>It is unclear at what point Neuhoff saw an opening for himself in Corsica. In early 1736, however, he was in Tunis, where his associates included two alchemically inclined monks who claimed to have developed a &#145;universal medicine&#146; and a Sicilian doctor called Buongiorno. With their assistance he obtained arms, munitions, and other supplies on credit, and loaded them aboard a British vessel commanded by a Captain Dick, who may have been under the impression that the enterprise had official British support. They sailed for Corsica, with two redeemed slaves and some hangers-on, and on 12 March 1736 arrived at Aleria. In a letter to the rebel leaders Neuhoff offered himself as their king, requiring only that they guarantee religious freedom to non-Roman Catholics.<br>
<br>The offer was accepted. Corsica had long been regarded as a kingdom within the dominions of the kings of Aragon and then the doges of Genoa, and the rebels had already granted the title &#145;royal highness&#146; to their three leaders, the &#145;primates&#146; of the kingdom, Giacinto Paoli, Andrea Ceccaldi, and Luigi Giafferi. According to contemporary observers, these three found it a useful publicity-winning device to complete the picture with a king, however unsuitable the individual chosen. Neuhoff was installed in the episcopal palace in Aleria and crowned on 14 April, under a constitution which decreed his title hereditary by male primogeniture.<br>
<br>King Theodor's rule in Corsica manifested itself largely in the making of appointments (not all agreeable to the three primates) and the liberal distribution of titles, some of which were nobiliary while others were grades within the order of Deliverance (or Redemption). A silver and copper coinage was issued, struck from very poorly cut dies, the silver showing on one side the Virgin and, on the other, a shield with the arms of the Neuhoffs (three links of a chain) impaling those of the island (a Moor's head). Apart from a brief campaign in June, Neuhoff left military activities against the Genoese to the rebel commanders who had led them before. His own main assault on the Genoese was a robust reply to a long denunciation they had published of him and his dubious antecedents. But his rhetoric could not hide the disappointing lack of the supplies, munitions, and money that he had promised since the outset. As far as the rebel leaders were concerned he had served his purpose, and by the autumn his position in the island was perilously weak. On 4 November he published an edict creating a system of regency and, with Costa, his secretary of state, left for the coast. Disguised as a priest, he landed at Leghorn on 14 November.<br>
<br>In the five years that followed, Neuhoff travelled as ceaselessly as before, and was as frequently in debt, but managed with backing from a small group of Dutch merchants to mount two more abortive missions to Corsica. Among his followers were two nephews, both called Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric de Neuhoff, who both spent considerably more time and suffered much greater hardship in active support of the rebels in the island than he. Neuhoff now viewed Corsica as a family matter; in a letter of 1740 to his brother-in-law, Gom&eacute;-Delagrange, he claimed that his rights there derived not only from popular election as king, but also by inheritance from a Neuhoff ancestor who had been viceroy of the island and feudal lord of its southern part in the early tenth century.<br>
<br>In 1742 Neuhoff seems, briefly, to have gained rather more powerful support. Having been for an unknown period in London, he sailed in November for Leghorn, and thence, at the end of January 1743, for Corsica, with two British men-of-war and 400 Austrian deserters and Corsican exiles. His arrival had been announced in an edict drafted for him by General Braitwitz (commander of the Austrian army in Tuscany), Count de Richecourt (French minister to Florence), and Burrington Goldsworthy (British consul at Leghorn). On reaching Corsica he received the compliments of the rebel leaders and sailed around the coast distributing small amounts of arms, powder, and ammunition. But there was now a Genoese-sponsored, 5000-strong, French expeditionary force in the island; on a second journey towards the end of February, aware of the weakness of his position, he did not even disembark. In fact the British had not agreed to support him: Horace Mann, minister to Tuscany (and Goldsworthy's superior), had from the outset renounced any involvement or responsibility in the enterprise, and in April orders were addressed to the commander of the Mediterranean Fleet expressly forbidding it. Having achieved little, Neuhoff travelled incognito to Florence where he had a long interview with Mann, in the course of which he apparently claimed to be the uncle of Amalie Sophie van Wallmoden, countess of Yarmouth, George II's mistress. (Lady Yarmouth's family, the Wendts, were certainly related to the Neuhoffs.) Mann continued to advise that Britain do nothing to assist Neuhoff. His requests for support from other quarters were rebuffed, although Corsica remained the centre of much international interest, and another plan to sail for Corsica in 1745 was scotched by Mann. In September 1747 Neuhoff was expelled from Tuscany.<br>
<br>After a period in Germany and the Netherlands, Neuhoff moved to London in January 1749. Using the name Baron Stein, he stayed at first with the Dutch envoy, Hendrik Hop, who with the Hanoverian minister Baron M&uuml;nchhausen presented him to London society. In March 1749, at the house of the diplomat Sir Luke Schaub, he met Horace Walpole. But by the following December he was again seriously in debt, and shortly before Christmas he was arrested and imprisoned in the king's bench prison for a specific sum of &pound;400.<br>
<br>Much visited in gaol over the ensuing three years by sightseers and well-wishers, Neuhoff appointed many of them to the order of Deliverance. Among those so honoured was Colonel Frederick [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/10138/', "Frederick, Felice")</script>], who later claimed to be his son. According to the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span>, while a prisoner Neuhoff married on 25 July 1751 Miss Edmonston of Panton Square, &#145;a lady of beauty and fortune&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 1st ser., 21, 1751, 332), but the marriage is not mentioned by any other source. His financial plight did not visibly alter, and the public interest in him waned somewhat. A subscription inaugurated by Walpole in <span class="italic">The World</span> in February 1753 raised only &pound;50. Walpole attributed this to the notoriously bad character of the beneficiary, and complained that so far from being grateful, Neuhoff had threatened to sue the publisher of <span class="italic">The World</span> for misnaming him; but the satirical style of the announcement and its title &#145;Date obolum Belisario&#146; were unlikely to have earned his approval, or encouraged donations.<br>
<br>Neuhoff's release was eventually secured, with Walpole's help, under the <span class="roman">Insolvency Act</span> of 1755. Registering his claim to the kingdom of Corsica as his only asset, and assigning it to his creditors (in a document later acquired by Walpole and exhibited at Strawberry Hill), he left gaol on 5 or 6 December 1756 and took up residence with a tailor in Little Chapel Street, Soho. But exhausted by his long imprisonment he fell ill immediately, and died there a few days later, on 11 December 1756. He was buried in an unmarked grave in the churchyard of St Anne's, Soho; a monumental inscription composed and paid for by Walpole was placed on the exterior of the church, and survives to this day. A neighbouring public house is still called the King of Corsica. A different form of immortality was bestowed by Voltaire, who included Theodore among the deposed monarchs depicted in chapter 26 of <span class="italic">Candide</span>. This scene was the basis for the opera <span class="italic">Il re Teodoro in Venezia</span> by Giovanni Paisiello and Giambattista Casti, which Walpole saw in London in December 1787. He thought it of poor quality, but reported that the emperor Joseph II was delighted with it, believing it to be a satire on the king of Sweden.<br>
<br>Theodore was frequently caricatured, but two engravings are known that may derive from reliable portraits. One, signed J. V. Schley and dated 1737, shows him fully wigged, moustachioed, and dressed in vaguely oriental garb, standing on the coast as if just arrived in Corsica. Another, more idealized, is signed I. I. Haid, and shows him clean-shaven in a short wig and rich, courtly dress. A third engraving sometimes reproduced as a portrait of Neuhoff is in fact from a painting by Van Dyck of the seventeenth-century Parisian collector Everard Jabach. Walpole's plan of sending William Hogarth to the king's bench prison to portray Neuhoff there, as related to Horace Mann in a letter of 25 July 1750, does not seem to have borne fruit.<br>
