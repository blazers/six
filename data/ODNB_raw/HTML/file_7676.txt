<span class="headword">Dineley <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em> Dineley-Goodere]</span>, Sir  John</span>, fifth baronet  (<em>c.</em>1729&#150;1809), <span class="occ">eccentric</span>, was born at Burhope, Herefordshire, the younger of twin sons of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/10969/', "Samuel Goodere (1687&#150;1741)")</script>, landowner and naval officer, of Burhope, and his second wife, a widow, Elizabeth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Watts (<i>d</i>. 1742). The claim that Dineley-Goodere once practised physic is unsubstantiated and probably derived from his regular purchases of medical books. Dineley-Goodere's father, Samuel, lived on bad terms with his elder brother, Sir John Goodere, third baronet, who adopted the name Dineley-Goodere as heir to his maternal ancestors. He married Mary Lawford but their only son died young and unmarried. Because of this bad feeling Sir John threatened to disinherit Samuel in favour of his nephew, John Foote of Truro. To prevent this threat being carried out Samuel, then in command of the naval vessel <i>Ruby</i>, caused his brother to be kidnapped at Bristol, and then to be strangled by two sailors on board his vessel. The murder took place on the night of Sunday 18 January 1741, and on 15 April following the fratricide Samuel was hanged with his two accomplices at Bristol. The precise status of the baronetcy thereafter is unclear. It is possible that Samuel's eldest son, Edward, succeeded as baronet, or was merely granted a courtesy title. On Edward's death in March 1761, aged thirty-two, the title of fifth baronet passed to his brother John, assuming that his father never inherited the title. What little remained of the family estates he soon wasted; about 1770 he was obliged to part with Burhope to Sir James Peachey and he lived for a time in a state bordering on destitution. At length his friendship with the Pelhams, coupled with the interest of Lord North, procured for him the pension and free residence of a poor knight of Windsor. From then on he seems to have used the surname of Dineley only.<br>
<br>By the oddity of his dress, demeanour, and mode of life Dineley became one of the chief sights of Windsor. Each morning he locked up his house in the castle, which no one entered but himself, and went forth to purchase provisions. According to the <span class="italic">Penny Magazine</span>:<blockquote>He then wore a large cloak called a roquelaure, beneath which appeared a pair of thin legs encased in dirty silk stockings. He had a formidable umbrella, and he stalked along upon pattens. All luxuries, whether of meat, or tea, or sugar, or butter, were renounced &hellip; Wherever crowds were assembled&#151;wherever royalty was to be looked upon&#151;there was Sir John Dineley. He then wore a costume of the days of George II&#151;the embroidered coat, the silk-flowered waistcoat, the nether garments of faded velvet carefully meeting the dirty silk stocking, which terminated in the half-polished shoe surmounted by the dingy silver buckle. The old wig, on great occasions, was newly powdered, and the best cocked hat was brought forth, with a tarnished lace edging. He had dreams of ancient genealogies, and of alliances still subsisting between himself and the first families of the land.</blockquote>Dineley's second preoccupation was his search for a wife whose wealth he hoped would allow him to establish his lineage:<blockquote>To secure for himself a wife was the business of his existence; to display himself properly where women most do congregate was the object of his savings. The man had not a particle of levity in these proceedings; his deportment was staid and dignified. He had a wonderful discrimination in avoiding the tittering girls, with whose faces he was familiar. But perchance some buxom matron or timid maiden who had seen him for the first time gazed upon the apparition with surprise and curiosity. He approached. With the air of one bred in courts he made his most profound bow; and taking a printed paper from his pocket, reverently presented it and withdrew. (<span class="italic">Penny Magazine</span>)</blockquote>More than once he paid court to some lad dressed up as a fine lady. His marriage proposals were crudely printed by himself. Occasionally he advertised in the newspapers. He also printed some extraordinary rhymes under the title of &#145;Methods to get husbands &hellip; with the advertised marriage offer of Sir John Dineley, bart., of Charleton, near Worcester, extending to 375,000<i>l</i>., to the reader of this epistle, if a single lady, and has above one hundred guineas fortune&#146;.<br>
<br>Although obsessed by his search for a wife and for his lost inheritance, in other matters Dineley was both sane and shrewd. Twice or thrice a year he visited Vauxhall Gardens and the London theatres, taking care to apprise the public of his intention through the medium of the most fashionable daily papers. Wherever he went the place was invariably well attended, especially by women. Dineley persevered in his addresses to the ladies until the very close of his life, but without success. When he failed to appear at chapel one morning his door was broken open. His passage was filled with coals, his sitting room with his printing materials; there was little furniture. Dineley was found in bed. He died a few days later, in November 1809, aged about eighty. On his death the baronetcy became extinct.<br>
