<span class="headword">Phillipps,  (Henry) Vivian</span>  (1870&#150;1955), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born on 13 April 1870 at Lancaster House, Beckenham, Kent, the eldest son of Henry Mitchell Phillipps (1836&#150;1900), a merchant on the London corn exchange, and his second wife, Louise Vivian (1847&#150;1921). He was educated at the Abbey School, Beckenham (1879&#150;83), and Charterhouse School (1883&#150;6), before preparing for the Indian Civil Service examination with crammers in Brighton (1887) and at Heidelberg (1887&#150;9), where he became fluent in German. On failing the examination, he studied for the modern languages tripos at Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge (1890&#150;93), where he also played violin in the university string quartet. On graduating BA with first-class honours in 1893, he held the post of modern languages master at Fettes College, Edinburgh (1893&#150;1905), also becoming choirmaster. In 1895 he published <span class="italic">A Short Sketch of German Literature for Schools</span>. On 8 August 1899 he married Agnes Cassels, daughter of James Ford, an Edinburgh businessman. They had a son and two daughters, one of whom inspired Phillipps's children's story, <span class="italic">A Trip to Santa Claus Land, or, Ruth's Christmas Eve</span> (1905). In his mid-thirties his prosperous father-in-law enabled him to fulfil an ambition to become a barrister. He entered Lincoln's Inn, but undertook much of the studies by correspondence course. After qualifying in 1908, he practised on the northern circuit.<br>
<br>Phillipps also took up Liberal politics, but was defeated as the parliamentary candidate at Blackpool in the general election of 1906 and at Maidstone in both the general elections of 1910. His political advancement took a different route, after lack of success at the bar persuaded him to serve as private secretary to successive secretaries for Scotland, McKinnon Wood (1912&#150;16) and H. J. Tennant (July to December 1916). When the formation of Lloyd George's coalition government split the Liberal Party leadership, he declined to work for the new minister, serving instead as private secretary to the former prime minister, Asquith, from 1917 to 1922. Phillipps became a loyal member of the Asquithian inner circle, along with Sir Robert Hudson, Geoffrey Howard, Viscount Gladstone, and Sir Donald Maclean. His principal contribution to Liberal politics was as this group's most implacable opponent of Lloyd George. At the general election of 1918 he was defeated at Rochdale by a Conservative bearing Lloyd George's &#145;coupon&#146;, but after the fall of the coalition government he finally became an MP by winning West Edinburgh at the general election of 1922.<br>
<br>Despite being new to the House of Commons, Phillipps was appointed in January 1923 chief whip of the independent Liberal Party, because Asquith desired a close friend in the post who could be relied upon to resist pressures for reunion with Lloyd George's National Liberal Party. When the Conservative government's adoption of protection nevertheless forced the Asquithians into reluctant reconciliation with Lloyd George in autumn 1923, Phillipps negotiated the allocation of parliamentary candidatures and an agreed election manifesto. He retained his seat at the general election of 1923, but as the results produced a hung parliament with Liberal MPs holding the balance of power, his work as chief whip became unusually difficult. The Liberal leadership's efforts to influence the inexperienced first Labour government generated mutual resentment, while new differences developed among Liberal MPs as they were torn between the alternatives of voting with one or other of the two larger parties, or else abstaining. Amid a general Liberal Party collapse at the general election of 1924, Phillipps lost at West Edinburgh and thereby ceased to be chief whip.<br>
<br>Appointed early in 1925 as chairman of the Liberal Party organization with the formidable task of restoring its credibility, Phillipps engaged in new disputes which made matters worse. The party was desperately short of money, yet Lloyd George possessed a large political fund. Lloyd George's refusals to seal political reunion by financial union created Asquithian anxieties that he would use his fund to capture control of the party, so in 1925 Phillipps chaired a &#145;million fund&#146; appeal aimed at securing the party's financial independence. When the appeal failed miserably, Phillipps's sense of political proportion deserted him: he asserted not just that the Lloyd George fund deterred donors but that distrust of Lloyd George himself was the chief obstacle to the party's revival. For Phillipps, defence of Liberal principles and hatred of Lloyd George had become inseparable. If, he wrote, Lloyd George were &#145;to offer the Kingdom of the earth&#146; and ask &#145;what more do you want&#146;, he would say &#145;we don't want you&#146;  (16 Nov 1926, Gladstone papers).<br>
<br>Phillipps considered Asquith's break with Lloyd George in May 1926 over the general strike a &#145;deliverance&#146;, yet it precipitated what he most feared. Not only was Asquith forced into retirement, leaving Lloyd George as <i>de facto</i> party leader, but the party's income withered. In September Phillipps had to report that bankruptcy loomed within six months. The National Liberal Federation executive felt obliged in January 1927 to accept an offer of large sums from Lloyd George, with an implicit condition of Phillipps's removal as party chairman. Already, however, he and other Asquithians had resolved to continue the fight, forming the Liberal council under Viscount Grey's leadership as &#145;the champion of clean politics, the financial independence of parties&#146; and traditional Liberal values. As executive committee member and joint secretary Phillipps was the council's chief organizer, assisting Liberal parliamentary candidates critical of Lloyd George and seeking every opportunity to thwart him. When the Conservative newspaper the <span class="italic">Morning Post</span> ran a campaign during 1927 against the Lloyd George fund, exposing its origins in the sale of honours, Phillipps supplied much of the information.<br>
<br>Although at the general election of 1929 Phillipps, sharing the fate of most Liberal candidates, was again defeated at West Edinburgh, like other Asquithians he delighted in the failure of Lloyd George's efforts to achieve a substantial party revival. Phillipps publicly presented the Liberal election result as proof that Lloyd George's leadership was a liability to the party, and organized an abortive Liberal council assault on him in early 1930. During the rest of the parliament he combined a Liberal council campaign for retrenchment and free trade with encouragement to new groups of Liberal parliamentary rebels. But with Lloyd George's removal from the leadership as the Liberal Party finally disintegrated during the 1931 political crisis, the mainspring of Phillipps's political career was removed. He remained active in the Liberal council, and defended the historical reputation of Asquithian leaders by assisting their biographers, but he did not stand again for parliament. Instead he turned to legal and local affairs. A JP for Kent since 1915, he was elected vice-chairman of the county bench in 1931 and chairman in 1937. He was chairman of the West Kent quarter sessions (1933&#150;45), the West Kent Unemployment Appeal Tribunal (1934&#150;40), and the Kent Agricultural Wages Committee (1935&#150;40). He also served on the lord chancellor's committee on appointments to the commission of the peace, and the board of visitors to Maidstone prison. His autobiography, <span class="italic">My Days and Ways</span>, was printed for private circulation in 1943. He died on 16 January 1955 at his home, Upper Kennards, Leigh, near Tonbridge, Kent, and was buried two days later in the parish church.<br>
