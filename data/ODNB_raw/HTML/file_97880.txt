<span class="headword">Cairoli,  (Humbert Jean) Charles</span> <span class="st"> [<em>performing name </em>Charlie Cairoli]</span>  (1910&#150;1980), <span class="occ">clown</span>, was born in Affori, near Milan, Italy, on 15 February 1910, the son of Jean Marie Cairoli, who was Italian, and his wife, Eugenie Ricono, who was French. His parents, who were circus performers, were descendants of circus families with a solid background in circus skills and music. As the youngest child (he had a brother ten years his senior) Charlie was an unwelcome addition to the family, owing to the uncertainty of circus artists' income, and his childhood memories were not happy. His father taught him the basic circus skills (acrobatics, juggling, musical instruments) but was a strict disciplinarian. On one occasion a flute was broken over his head for not progressing fast enough: later, he became proficient in many musical instruments, but never mastered the flute.<br>
<br>By 1917 Cairoli's parents were presenting a successful musical comedy act in which, aged seven, he had to dress as a bell boy and blacken his face with burnt corks. His role was to interrupt their act and generally make a nuisance of himself in the ring. His father formed a partnership with a Portuguese <i>Auguste</i> (slapstick clown) named Porto and they secured a contract for the 1927 season at the Medrano circus in Paris, where they successfully competed with the Fratellini Trio, the stars of the rival Cirque d'Hiver. Charles was part of the act and, on account of his youthful appearance, was given an outrageous make-up, copied from another <i>Auguste</i>, Bario. It was a perfect apprenticeship for him, as they had to produce two different entr&eacute;es every fortnight during the season. During their four years at Medrano they presented over 100 different entr&eacute;es, and Charles revealed himself as a good Charleston dancer. When the Medrano was closed during the summer season the trio travelled and made successful appearances in circus shows, theatres, and cabarets around Europe. On 22 December 1934 Charles married Violette Laura Maximilliene Fratellini (1914&#150;2004), the youngest daughter of their competitors at Cirque d'Hiver (she had an Italian father and a Scottish mother). They had three children, Regina, Mary Diane, and Charles. Shortly afterwards Charles's elder brother, Philip, gave up his career as a juggler and replaced Porto in the trio. Tensions arose when Jean Marie and Philip felt that Charles was stealing the limelight.<br>
<br>In 1938 the Cairoli trio obtained a contract to play their musical number in Birmingham in a Christmas pantomime, followed by a contract for the 1939 summer season at the Tower circus in Blackpool. They were an immediate success with the Blackpool audiences and their contract was renewed for the next season. At the outbreak of war Philip went to Spain. Charles requested French naturalization, but while waiting for this to come through, in June 1940 he and his father, as holders of Italian passports, were interned on the Isle of Man as enemy aliens. They were released when the French documentation arrived. During the war years he and his father honoured their English contracts but missed the 1944 and 1945 seasons at Blackpool as they were playing at the London Palladium, returning to Blackpool for the 1946 season. At the end of the 1947 season his parents retired to France, but Charles remained in England and during the 1950s was naturalized as a British subject.<br>
<br>During the post-war seaside holiday boom Charlie Cairoli was the dominant figure at the Blackpool Tower circus, whose popularity rivalled that of Bertram Mills's circus at London's Olympia. Each year he had to present two different entr&eacute;es, one musical and one slapstick. He found that the audiences in Blackpool had a liking for &#145;water&#146; or &#145;slosh&#146; (soapy water) entr&eacute;es, and completely satisfied their expectations, though he did not often utilize the Blackpool circus's famous sinking ring (which could be lowered to allow water to rush in), believing that the effects were too predictable. His musical entr&eacute;es, in which he ingeniously devised a variety of instruments, provoked as many laughs as his slapstick, and illustrated the range of his abilities. He wore minimal make-up&#151;simply a red nose and highlighted lips and eyebrows&#151;and his usual costume for the slapstick act was chef's check trousers, braces, a shirt, and his trademark bowler hat, while for the musical entr&eacute;es he wore a formal frock coat. He developed a special rapport with children in the audience, who made repeated visits to watch &#145;Uncle Charlie's&#146; new &#145;misadventures&#146;. From 1948 until 1979, during thirty-two Blackpool seasons, he had four different white-faced clowns as partners, all called &#145;Paul&#146;: Paul Freeman (1948&#150;59), Paul King (1960&#150;67), Paul Connor (1968&#150;73), and his own son Charles (1970&#150;79). In 1953 he also began to employ a carpet clown adept at deadpan expressions, Jimmy Buchanan (Little Jimmy), a combination which proved an immediate success. In April 1955 he appeared in a royal variety show at the Blackpool Opera House.<br>
<br>As the Blackpool season only lasted from Easter to September, Cairoli appeared in many shows in Europe and the United States, notably a few appearances in the famous Ed Sullivan show. At Christmas he always secured pantomimes in premier theatres or ice shows, appearing as characters as well as providing the slapstick. He starred in a BBC children's programme <span class="italic">Right Charlie</span>, which was first broadcast between 1972 and 1976. It was, however, his forty-year association with Blackpool Tower circus for which he is best remembered. Ill health forced his retirement in November 1979 and he died at his home, 129 Warley Road, Blackpool, Lancashire, on 17 February 1980. He was cremated at Carleton crematorium, Blackpool. An exhibition in Blackpool Tower commemorates his career.<br>
