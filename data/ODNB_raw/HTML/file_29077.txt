<span class="headword">West,  Charles</span>  (1816&#150;1898), <span class="occ">physician</span>, was born in London on 8 August 1816, the second son of Ebeneezer West (<i>b</i>. 1776) and his wife, Jane (1783&#150;1871), daughter of Major Johnson of the Durham fencibles. In 1821 Ebeneezer West became a Baptist minister at Chenies, Buckinghamshire, and opened a school, which he later moved to Amersham. Here West received his early education, followed by attendance at a private school in Totteridge. In 1831 he was apprenticed to Mr Gray, a local general practitioner who had been apothecary to St George's Hospital. After two years, in which he learned the dispenser's art, he entered St Bartholomew's Hospital as a medical student. In 1835 he went to the University of Bonn where he won a prize for an essay on the female pelvis and its influence on parturition. He then went to Paris and Berlin where he graduated MD in September 1837.<br>
<br>After returning to London, West bought a partnership in a City practice, which failed. In 1838 he studied midwifery at the Rotunda Lying-in Hospital, Dublin, and also served at the Meath Hospital. He then returned to St Bartholomew's as clinical clerk to Dr George Burrows. In 1842 West gained the MRCP and became physician at the Waterloo Road Dispensary for Women and Children. In the summer of 1844 he married Mary Hester, daughter of N. B. Cartwright of Stroud, Gloucester; they had a son and a daughter. In 1845 he was appointed lecturer on midwifery at the Middlesex Hospital, and physician accoucheur in 1846. His lectures on the diseases of children were published in the <span class="italic">Medical Gazette</span> in 1847 and later as a book which saw seven English editions and was translated into several European languages and Arabic. This work made West famous as the father of British paediatrics. In 1848, now an FRCP, he was appointed joint lecturer on midwifery with Edward Rigby at St Bartholomew's Hospital. When Rigby resigned in 1849 West continued the lectures alone. Based on practical experience and expressed in elegant English, the lectures enhanced his reputation. He was designated honorary physician accoucheur with charge of the lying-in department and a ward of thirteen beds. He also gave a weekly clinical lecture, but his work was unrecognized, his name never appearing in the list of physicians of the hospital, despite more than ten years' service. From 1855 on he petitioned the hospital for recognition; it was repeatedly refused and he resigned in 1861.<br>
<br>In the 1840s West tried unsuccessfully to convert the Waterloo Road Dispensary to a children's hospital. In 1849&#150;50 he investigated the facilities for treating children at other London hospitals and wrote to all the children's hospitals on the continent. He personally visited every London physician to canvass support for a children's hospital. Richard Bright directed him to Henry Bence Jones who lent his house for meetings and used his personal influence to obtain financial support. On 19 March 1851, at a public meeting chaired by Lord Ashley, the Children's Hospital was founded and two weeks later the house at 49 Great Ormond Street, formerly the home of Queen Anne's physician, Richard Mead, was obtained for the hospital. West was its first physician and wrote the early reports. He lectured on children's diseases and wrote a little manual on nursing sick children which was published for the benefit of the hospital.<br>
<br>In 1874 West joined the Roman Catholic church. His first wife died and he remarried. His second wife was Marie Octavie Agatha Clotilde Flon (<i>d</i>. 1923); there were no children. In 1875 West resigned as physician to the Great Ormond Street Hospital which he had served since 1852. He was appointed consulting physician and retained his place on the committee of management. He also donated his extensive medical library to the hospital. But in 1877, following a disagreement with the committee, his connection with the hospital came to an end, though he continued to oversee the building of the school of nursing which he had designed. It was opened in 1878. He continued in private practice, but London's fogs troubled him and from 1880 he wintered annually in Nice. In 1885, with improved health, he moved back to London and many former patients returned to him, but he always wished to resume his life's work with children and sought in vain for a post in a children's hospital.<br>
<br>Throughout his life West was a prolific writer on medical subjects; he was also one of the finest public speakers of his generation. At the Royal College of Physicians he was Croonian lecturer in 1854, Lumleian lecturer (1871), and Harveian orator (1874). He regarded the profession of medicine as a sacred duty and his strict moral code made him a demanding colleague. On two notable occasions he argued forcefully to prevent the entry of women to the Royal College of Physicians. In 1865 he was elected a corresponding member of the Acad&eacute;mie de M&eacute;decine, Paris, and in 1892, <i>membre &eacute;tranger</i>, a rare honour attained by very few Englishmen.<br>
<br>West suffered a severe attack of neuralgia in 1891 from which he never fully recovered. The London fogs had again forced him to winter on the Riviera and in 1897 he went south, although warned that the journey might prove too much. On 20 December in Nice an acute attack of herpes further reduced his strength. He left Cannes for London on 1 March 1898, but at Paris he was forced to break his journey and, after three weeks of increasing weakness, he died peacefully at the Hotel Terminus on 19 March 1898. He was buried at St Mary's Catholic Church, Chislehurst, Kent, on 23 March.<br>
