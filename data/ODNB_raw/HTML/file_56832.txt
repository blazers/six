<span class="headword">Boraston, Sir  John</span>  (1851&#150;1920), <span class="occ">political organizer</span>, was born at 163 Hockley Hill, Birmingham, on 24 June 1851, son of John Boraston, a tea merchant from a Worcestershire family, and his wife, Elizabeth Palmer. He trained as a solicitor and took an early interest in politics. Aged only twenty-three he acted as Liberal agent for Southampton in the general election of 1874, and subsequently he worked in the same capacity in Liskeard, though continuing to practise as a solicitor. He married on 13 May 1876 Louisa Jane, daughter of William Henry Lewis, an engineer, with whom he had a son and three daughters.<br>
<br>A strong unionist on Irish issues, Boraston became assistant secretary of the new Liberal Unionist Party organization in 1887. Initially he ran the machine for London, but from 1891 he was Liberal Unionist chief agent for the whole country. His close collaboration with the Conservatives' Captain Middleton brought Unionist electoral machinery to a legendary pitch of effectiveness in the 1890s, when during actual campaigns Boraston took charge of the parties' efforts in Ireland. He collaborated actively with the party's parliamentary figures, but worked most closely with Joseph Chamberlain who, among the Liberal Unionist leaders, was the most fascinated by organizational matters. Boraston helped to ensure that the Liberal Unionist council backed Chamberlain's tariff crusade from 1903. Thereafter, party divisions hampered electoral effectiveness, but when the Unionist organization committee reviewed the situation in 1911, witnesses contrasted Boraston's efficiency for the Liberal Unionists with the slacker approach at Conservative central office.<br>
<br>When the two parties finally merged in 1912, Boraston became principal agent for the combined party, and seems to have won the trust of the former Conservatives. For he was, wrote the <span class="italic">Morning Post</span>, &#145;a very tactful and genial man, and quickly gained the regard of those with whom his duties brought him into contact&#146;. Thereafter, under the party chairman Arthur Steel-Maitland, he spruced up the party machine between 1912 and 1914. All this effort was rewarded with a clutch of by-election victories which steadily eroded the Liberals' parliamentary strength, and with progress in the annual registration courts that promised a more favourable register for a national contest. Boraston wrote in 1914 that fusion of the parties had been &#145;a sound investment and, although Unionist stock has appreciated greatly since the new issue, nobody has the slightest intention of selling out&#146;  (Ramsden, 93).<br>
<br>This seemed to presage well for the election due in 1915, but because of war no election was held. It was characteristic of the &#145;business as usual&#146; manner in which Edwardian Britain went to war that its party machines were turned over to the war effort. Boraston became honorary secretary to the parliamentary recruiting committee, which conducted propaganda for voluntary enlistment through his usual repertory of leaflets, posters, and public meetings, and took personal charge of organizing meetings. The success of the campaign was indicated in the large number of volunteers, enabling Britain to avoid conscription until 1916; his work was recognized by the award of a knighthood in that year. When conscription did come about he was redeployed to similar campaigns for war savings and national service. His only son, John Herbert Boraston, was Douglas Haig's secretary at general headquarters during the war.<br>
<br>With Boraston so involved in war work, he had less time for central office, and his assistant was promoted to joint principal agent. On the return of peacetime politics, old party certainties had vanished and his health was poor, but he soldiered on, holding the post of principal agent until his death; he died of cancer of the colon on 18 April 1920 at the Greta Nursing Home, Blyth Road, Bromley, Kent. He was buried on 22 April at St Paul's, Beckenham. <span class="italic">The Times</span> noted the passing of &#145;a great political organiser&#146;, and the <span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span> reported that &#145;the Unionist Party has suffered a heavy loss&#146;, for Boraston had been &#145;an admirable type of the British party official, dignified, reserved, discreet, and keen, but scrupulously fair in his methods&#146;.<br>
