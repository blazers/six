<span class="headword">Tonyn,  Patrick</span>  (1725&#150;1804), <span class="occ">army officer and colonial governor</span>, was the son of Charles William Tonyn (<i>d</i>. 1754), a colonel in the 6th dragoons. By the age of nineteen he had joined his father's unit, and rose to the rank of captain in May 1751. During the Seven Years' War this &#145;pugnacious Irishman&#146;  (Bailyn, 459) gained combat experience in Prussia and by 1761 had achieved the rank of lieutenant-colonel in the 104th regiment. He continued to earn promotions in subsequent decades, being appointed a colonel in 1777, a major-general four years later, and a full general in 1798, despite his withdrawal from active service with his unit more than two decades previously.<br>
<br>Tonyn's departure from his regiment coincided with his appointment as royal governor of East Florida, a province created out of the southernmost lands of North America that Great Britain obtained from Spain via the treaty of Paris (1763). He arrived in the colony's capital of St Augustine on 1 March 1774, just as revolutionary sentiment was peaking among many colonists in North America. Soon after his arrival the stridently loyal governor clashed with certain members of East Florida's population over the necessity of summoning a legislative assembly, thereby alienating, among others, the colony's chief justice and principal landowners. These tensions escalated as warfare broke out in the colonies to the north, although the relatively small population, geographical isolation, and economic insufficiency of East Florida ensured that as a whole the inhabitants remained loyal to the king.<br>
<br>Governor Tonyn energetically pursued measures to maintain his province's allegiance and defend it against American patriot agitators from the north. Responding to orders from the British government, he issued in November 1775 a proclamation inviting loyalists from the rebelling colonies to emigrate to East Florida, where for a ten-year period they would be eligible for land grants free of quitrents. As the number of loyalists inhabiting the province consequently increased, he initiated military preparations as well. In June 1776 Tonyn authorized the formation of the &#145;East Florida rangers&#146;, a loyalist regiment, to assist regular British troops in the colony's protection from opposing forces. Over the course of the war members of this regiment participated in both defensive and offensive actions, at times invading the Georgia backcountry where they stole cattle, harassed settlements, and obtained information on American troop movements and supplies. In addition the governor held several meetings with local Seminole and Creek leaders in which he enlisted American Indian support for the East Florida rangers and defence of the province. As a further precaution Tonyn issued several letters of marque to local shipowners and encouraged privateering while concurrently obtaining for the provincial navy dozens of brigs and schooners to patrol the coastal waters and inland rivers.<br>
<br>Tonyn's efforts succeeded in protecting East Florida from any significant incursion from either the American patriots or Spanish forces who had entered the war in 1779 hoping to re-obtain possession of the Floridas. Nevertheless, as the conflict turned badly for British armies, the governor's superiors called for the military to evacuate the region in May 1782. Despite protests against such a move by both the governor and the loyalist citizens of East Florida, British diplomats relinquished control of the colony to Spain in the peace agreements ending the conflict. Over the next three years Tonyn presided over the relocation of loyalist residents and property to Jamaica, Nova Scotia, the Bahamas, and Britain while negotiating, often heatedly, with the incoming Spanish administrators over transference of political control in the province. Tonyn himself departed from East Florida on 19 November 1785 and returned to Britain, where he resided at Park Street in London. There, like many displaced American loyalists, he petitioned the government for compensation of property losses sustained upon evacuating North America. The almost &pound;6000 he was awarded, along with his military pension, allowed Tonyn to live comfortably until 1804, when he died in London on 30 December at the age of seventy-nine.<br>
