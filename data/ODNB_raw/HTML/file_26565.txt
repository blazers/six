<span class="headword">Stone,  Andrew</span>  (1703&#150;1773), <span class="occ">politician and tutor</span>, eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/48246/', "Andrew Stone (d. 1711)")</script>, banker and goldsmith of Lombard Street, London, and Anne Holbrooke (<i>d</i>. 1725), was born in London and baptized at St Mary Woolnoth in February 1703. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26571/', "George Stone")</script>, archbishop of Armagh, was his younger brother. He was educated from 1715 to 1722 on the foundation at Westminster School, where he proved an able scholar and formed a lasting friendship with his fellow pupil William Murray, the future Lord Mansfield. He matriculated from Christ Church, Oxford, in June 1722 and graduated BA (1726) and MA (1728). His political career began in 1732 when he was introduced by his brother-in-law, William Barnard, to the duke of Newcastle, who was greatly struck by Stone's charm and potential. Within three weeks Stone was appointed private secretary to the duke on a salary of &pound;200 per annum.<br>
<br>For the next twenty years Stone was the indefatigable aide and constant companion of Newcastle. He became virtually indispensable to the duke: he wrote his speeches, offered advice, mediated and negotiated on his behalf, and carried out political and diplomatic errands. Above all his prudence and discretion made him invaluable as the duke's trusted confidant. He was also highly favoured by George II and accompanied him to Hanover in May 1748 as his private secretary. Newcastle ensured that Stone was well rewarded: in August 1734 he was appointed under-secretary of state, which he remained until 1751, and he received an annual income of over &pound;4000 from his many sinecures. He was MP for the Treasury borough of Hastings from 1741 to 1761. On 7 July 1743 he married at Tooting, Surrey, Hannah (1710&#150;1782), daughter of Stephen Mauvillain and Hannah Gregory. Their only child, Thomas, was born on 6 December 1749 and died at the age of eleven on 7 February 1761.<br>
<br>Stone's political influence, whether real or imagined, inevitably incited jealousy in others. To his detractors he was an intriguer and self-seeker. Horace Walpole described him as &#145;a cold mysterious man of little plausibility&#146;  (Walpole, 1.193&#150;4) who was concerned primarily with ingratiating himself with those who could promote his career, such as the dowager princess of Wales. Accusations that Stone entertained Jacobite sympathies ran throughout his career and came to a head in a scandal over the prince of Wales's tutors in the winter of 1752&#150;3. In 1751 Stone had been appointed sub-governor to the prince of Wales but the prince's governor, Lord Harcourt, and preceptor, Thomas Hayter, bishop of Norwich, were jealous of his influence and accused him and George Lewis Scott, sub-preceptor, and James Cressett, private secretary to Princess Augusta, of maintaining Jacobite connections and of attempting to instil tory principles in the young prince. George II refused to accept these accusations, and Harcourt and Hayter were obliged to resign. The opposition seized the opportunity to embarrass the Pelhams, and Lord Ravenscroft made public a story that Stone and William Murray had toasted the health of the Pretender (James Stuart) when students at Oxford. A cabinet council investigated the matter and completely vindicated the accused, and the opposition unsuccessfully attempted to prolong their campaign to the Lords. Although the historical significance of the incident was slight its historiographical importance was much greater, for &#145;the notion that the future George III had been indoctrinated at a tender age by a set of crypto-Jacobites fitted too well with later perceptions of his &#147;prerogative tendencies&#148; to be dropped&#146;  (Langford, 222).<br>
<br>Stone remained in service to the prince of Wales as sub-governor and, from 1756 to 1760, as secretary. He was appointed treasurer to Queen Charlotte on the formation of her household in 1761 and left parliament that year. When in May 1762 Newcastle was forced out of office, Stone rejected the duke's entreaties to follow him into opposition. Newcastle saw this as an unforgivable desertion and never again spoke or wrote to Stone. Although he attached himself to Lord Bute, Stone did not exercise the political influence he had enjoyed before and it was &#145;his wish henceforth to live a retired life&#146;  (Brooke, 484). He died at his home in the Privy Gardens, Whitehall, London, on 17 December 1773 and was buried in Westminster Abbey on Christmas eve. An apt summary of his career was provided by Joseph Welch when he wrote &#145;during thirty or forty years no man was more completely behind the scenes of the political stage&#146;  (Welch, 279).<br>
