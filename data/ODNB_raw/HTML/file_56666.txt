<span class="headword">Vere,  Thomas</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1682), <span class="occ">jury foreman</span>, was the son of Ralph Vere of Wrotham, Kent. He was apprenticed in 1635/6 to John Wright, a member of the Stationers' Company. He obtained his freedom in 1644, and between 1646 and 1680 he operated as a bookseller in the Old Bailey area.<br>
<br>Vere served as the foreman of the jury which tried the Quakers William Penn and William Mead at the Old Bailey before the mayor and recorder of London in September 1670. Penn and Meade had been arrested for conspiracy to commit a riot in Gracechurch Street on 14 August 1670. After an initial deliberation lasting one and a half hours, the jury split 8:4 for a guilty verdict. After being sent back again the jury found the defendants guilty of &#145;speaking in Gracechurch Street&#146;. After being sent out again, they found Penn guilty of speaking or &#145;preaching&#146; to an &#145;assembly&#146;, but found Meade not guilty. The judge then ordered the jury detained overnight, without food or drink. When they returned the same verdict twice more, the court threatened the jury with being carted about the city. The jury sent word of a new verdict, but the court adjourned until the following day, whereupon the jury found a unanimous verdict of not guilty. This enraged the bench, who imposed a fine of 40 marks upon each juror and ordered them detained until the fine was paid. Vere evidently paid his fine and was released, as he was not one of the four jurors, led by Edward Bushell, who sued out a writ of habeas corpus in the court of common pleas, and won the ruling that the fine had no basis in law and that the jury had been held without lawful cause.<br>
<br>Vere was elected a common councilman for the Farringdon Without ward in 1672 and 1675&#150;7. He served as warden of the Stationers' Company in 1677 and as master in 1681. His will, dated 13 February 1682, referred to himself as &#145;citizen and stationer&#146;, and to his belief in his personal salvation &#145;with the elect children of God&#146;  (will). He asked to be buried in his local church of St Sepulchre, near to his &#145;late wife&#146;. His will was proved later in 1682.<br>
