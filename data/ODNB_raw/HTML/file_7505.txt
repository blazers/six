<span class="headword">Dennistoun,  James, of Dennistoun</span>  (1803&#150;1855), <span class="occ">antiquary and art collector</span>, eldest son of James Dennistoun of Colgrain and Camiseskan (<i>d</i>. 1834) and his wife, Mary Ramsay, daughter of George Oswald of Auchencruive and Scotston, was born in Dunbartonshire on 17 March 1803&#151;one of fourteen children. He was descended from the lords of Danzielstoun who traced their ancestry to the reign of Alexander III. After receiving his education at the universities of Edinburgh and Glasgow he became a member of the Faculty of Advocates in 1824 but never practised.<br>
<br>Dennistoun early developed a taste for legal and historical antiquities, and made some progress in the collection of materials for a history of Dunbartonshire. During a continental tour in 1825 and 1826, in which his companions were Mark Napier, John Hamilton Gray of Camtyne, and Alexander Dunlop of Keppoch, the art and literature of Italy first attracted his attention. After his father's death he was obliged to part with the family estate on the shores of the Clyde, but with part of his remaining fortune he was able to purchase the farm of Dennistoun Mains in Renfrewshire, the centre of the original possessions of his family in that county.<br>
<br>A second visit abroad in 1836&#150;9, to the Netherlands, Germany, Switzerland, and Italy, was devoted mainly to literary research and to the examination of the monuments of art. It was at this stage that Dennistoun began to form a small, but choice, collection of early Italian pictures and illuminated miniatures from manuscripts, as well as items of the applied arts, which was added to during further visits to the continent in 1843&#150;6, 1851, and 1853. His declared intention was to illustrate &#145;the progress of painting from the 13<sup>th</sup> century through the successive schools down to modern times&#151;but my favourite style goes back to the 14<sup>th</sup> and 15<sup>th</sup>&#146;  (Dennistoun to D. Laing, 3 December 1848, Brigstocke, &#145;James Dennistoun's second European tour&#146;, 247). He did not in fact achieve his wider aim, but was one of the first acknowledged collectors of early Italian and Netherlandish painting. He also seems to have acquired pictures with his scholarly interests in mind; they included, for example, the portrait of Guidobaldo da Montefeltro attributed to Piero della Francesca (Museo Thyssen-Bornemisza, Madrid). Although Dennistoun bought extensively abroad, he also attended sales in Britain and correspondingly his taste widened to include Spanish seventeenth-century painting and, somewhat surprisingly, the work of Sir Joseph No&euml;l Paton, whose <span class="italic">The Reconciliation of Oberon and Titania</span> (National Gallery of Scotland, Edinburgh) he owned. The collection was assembled at Dennistoun's house, 119 George Street, Edinburgh, his permanent home from 1846, and a brief account of it was published in the third volume of G. F. Waagen's <span class="italic">Treasures of Art in Great Britain</span> (1854).<br>
<br>Dennistoun was a magistrate and deputy lieutenant for the county of Renfrew, and became a member of most of the societies formed for collecting materials for illustrating the history of Scotland, with a particular interest, for example, in the history of Dunbartonshire. For the Bannatyne Club he edited David Moysie's <span class="italic">Memoirs of the Affairs of Scotland from 1577 to 1603</span> (1830). For the Maitland Club he prepared <span class="italic">Cartularium comitatus de Levenax, ab initio seculi decimi tertii usque ad annum <span class="smallcap">MCCCXCVIII</span></span> (1833), <span class="italic">Cochrane Correspondence Regarding the Affairs of Glasgow, 1745&#150;6</span> (1836), <span class="italic">Coltness Collections, 1608&#150;1840</span> (1842), and, as co-editor with Alexander Macdonald, <span class="italic">Miscellany, consisting of original papers illustrative of the history and literature of Scotland</span> (3 vols., 1834). He also wrote <span class="italic">Letter on the Scotish [<i>sic</i>] Reform Bill by a conservative</span> (1832) and <span class="italic">Memoirs of Sir Robert Strange, engraver, and of his brother-in-law, Andrew Lumisden, private secretary to the Stuart princes</span> (2 vols., 1855). His most significant work, however, was <span class="italic">Memoirs of the dukes of Urbino, illustrating the arms, arts, and literature of Italy from 1440 to 1630</span> (3 vols., 1851), which combined his interest in early Italian history, art, and literature. It was notable, for example, for the attention devoted to Piero della Francesca. Dedicated to Lord Lindsay, twenty-fifth earl of Crawford, author of <span class="italic">Sketches of the History of Christian Art</span> (3 vols., 1847), the <span class="italic">Memoirs of the Dukes of Urbino</span> was issued in a second edition in 1909 with a short biography of the author by Edward Hutton. For the <span class="italic">Quarterly Review</span> of December 1846 Dennistoun wrote an article entitled &#145;The Stuarts in Italy&#146;, and for the <span class="italic">Edinburgh Review</span> of October 1854 a review of J. H. Burton's <span class="italic">History of Scotland</span>. After a highly critical article in the <span class="italic">Edinburgh Review</span> in April 1853  (pp. 390&#150;420) Dennistoun gave valuable evidence before the committee of the House of Commons on the National Gallery in London in the same year, and furnished an analysis of the report of the committee to the <span class="italic">Edinburgh Review</span> of April 1854.<br>
<br>Dennistoun married, on 2 March 1835, in Bern, Isabella Katharina, eldest daughter of James Wolfe Murray, Lord Cringletie. He died at his home at 119 George Street, Edinburgh, on 13 February 1855, aged fifty-two. The greater portion of Dennistoun's collection was sold at Christies on 14 June 1855 (list reprinted in the first volume of the 1909 edition of <span class="italic">Memoirs of the Dukes of Urbino</span>, pp. xix&#150;xxviii). Several of the paintings are now in public collections. Of the illuminated manuscripts, the Ghislieri book of hours is in the British Library  (Yates Thompson MS 29), and several items were in the collection of Kenneth, Lord Clark, and were sold at Christies on 3 July 1984.<br>
