<span class="headword">Kedourie,  Elie</span> <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>Eliahou Abdallah Khedhouri]</span>  (1926&#150;1992), <span class="occ">historian and political scientist</span>, was born in Baghdad on 25 January 1926, the son of Abdallah Eliahou Khedhouri (<i>d</i>. 1964), an employee of the Iraq currency board, and his wife, Loulou Moshi, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Dangour (<i>d</i>. 1980). Both parents were Jewish. He was educated at the Coll&egrave;ge A-D Sasson and then the Shamash School before going in 1947 to the London School of Economics (LSE) to study for the BSc (Econ). His graduate work was at St Antony's College, Oxford, between 1951 and 1953. From 1953 he taught at the LSE, becoming professor of government in 1965 and retiring in 1990. On 3 August 1950, at the Spanish and Portuguese Synagogue, London, he married Sylvia Gourgi Haim, a student of Semitic languages, and daughter of Gourgi Abraham Haim, a company director; they had two sons and one daughter.<br>
<br>Kedourie's academic career began dramatically when in 1953 he withdrew his Oxford doctoral thesis, later published as <span class="italic">England and the Middle East: the Destruction of the Ottoman Empire, 1914&#150;1921</span> (1956). Kedourie's history offended the Oxford examiner Sir Hamilton Gibb, of whose standards of historical scholarship Kedourie was still contemptuous when, in a second edition of the book in 1978, he wrote an introduction recounting this now famous event. Kedourie's lifelong study of the Middle East challenged the idea that British and French imperial dominance of Arab countries had been a unique oppression generating an irresistible demand for national self-determination. He believed that a culturally misconceived imperial remorse had facilitated the emergence of unscrupulous despotisms in Arab countries. The spread of Western ideologies had led to a way of talking about politics in the Middle East which persuaded Western statesmen, quite wrongly, that they understood what was actually going on. <span class="italic">In the Anglo-Arab Labyrinth</span> (1976) is regarded by some as Kedourie's masterpiece. This was a detailed examination of the history of Anglo-French relations with the Arabs during and immediately after the First World War which led Kedourie to conclude:<blockquote>Some sixty years or so after the exchanges between McMahon and the Sharif, then, there was in Britain a miasm of guilt and self-incrimination, of penitence and breast-beating which hung over relations with the Arab world. It has been chiefly generated by officials hopelessly lost in the labyrinth of their own files. (<span class="italic">In the Anglo-Arab Labyrinth</span>, 318)</blockquote>One of the most notable features of Kedourie's work was a lucid and witty style which could bring out the grand significance of political activity without sacrificing its contingent character.<br>
<br>Kedourie and his wife, Sylvia (herself a notable scholar of Arab affairs), were convivial hosts, and Kedourie was meticulous in performing administrative duties such as being convenor of his department at the LSE. He and Sylvia founded the journal <span class="italic">Middle Eastern Studies</span> in 1964. Four years previously Kedourie's <span class="italic">Nationalism</span> appeared. It had a dramatic effect on historical scholarship. Kedourie destroyed the idea that nationalism was an immemorial political passion. Rather, it was a specific doctrine created around the turn of the nineteenth century. Resisting the strong contemporary impulse to blame Hegel for all dangerous ideas, Kedourie found one source of nationalist ideas in Kant's doctrine of self-determination. He later developed these ideas in the long introduction to an anthology, <span class="italic">Nationalism in Asia and Africa</span> (1971).<br>
<br>Kedourie took a close historian's interest in the detail of politics, and sometimes became involved in public policy. He had a number of conversations with Margaret Thatcher. He was especially alarmed by the degradation of British universities as they expanded during and after the 1960s, and wrote two brilliant pamphlets on the theme: <span class="italic">Diamonds into Glass: the Government and the Universities</span> (1988) and <span class="italic">Perestroika in the Universities</span> (1989).<br>
<br>Kedourie's work was governed by two basic understandings. The first was a philosophical sophistication which treated history as the evidential study of events. This was in part developed from association with his friend Michael Oakeshott, who had been responsible both for appointing him to the LSE and for publishing his early work. The second was a realistic view of the mechanics of government as quite different from the moralistic justifications of policy advanced in public discourse. Kedourie immersed himself in the documents, and was alert to what could not be known. He eschewed the mechanical value-freedom on which, for example, students of Soviet politics often fatally prided themselves, but his judgements were always closely aligned to evidence.<br>
<br>Kedourie's education in Baghdad had been French, but he had acquired a great admiration for England, an England which he believed had been corrupted by a false interpretation of recent history. He talked of &#145;scrupulosity&#146; replacing &#145;scruple&#146;. One specific target of his criticism was Arnold Toynbee, and one book of essays was entitled <span class="italic">The Chatham House Version</span> (1970). He was also a mordant critic (in <span class="italic">The Crossman Confessions and other Essays</span>, 1984) of what Oakeshott called &#145;rationalism in politics&#146;, mocking, for example, the insouciant objectives (such as building half a million houses) conjured by the Wilson government of the 1960s out of nothing more substantial than abstract desirability.<br>
<br>Kedourie was made a fellow of the British Academy in 1975 and a CBE in 1991. He died of heart failure at the Adventist Hospital, Tacoma Park, Montgomery county, Maryland, USA, on 29 June 1992, while on a visit to Washington, DC. He was buried on 2 July at Edgware Spanish and Portuguese cemetery, London. He was survived by his wife and three children. A memorial service was held at the Bevis Marks Synagogue, London, on 24 September 1992, and a memorial meeting was held at the London School of Economics on 20 January 1993. Kedourie generally had several projects going at the same time, so that at his death a book, <span class="italic">Hegel and Marx</span> (1996) (typically developed from lectures), was virtually complete. It was published posthumously, edited by his wife. She also edited <span class="italic">Elie Kedourie, CBE, FBA, 1926&#150;1992: History, Philosophy, Politics</span> (1998), an indispensable source of knowledge about Kedourie.<br>
