<span class="headword">Donn <span class="st"> [Donne]</span>,  Benjamin</span>  (1729&#150;1798), <span class="occ">mathematician and cartographer</span>, was born in Bideford, Devon, and baptized there on 22 June 1729, the last of six children of George Donn (<i>b</i>. in or before 1680, <i>d</i>. in or after 1750) and his wife, Elizabeth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Ching. George Donn was from an old Bideford family and from about 1721 kept a well-regarded mathematical school there, in which his sons Abraham (1719&#150;1743) and later Benjamin taught. In 1749 Benjamin began to contribute to the <span class="italic">Mathematical Repository</span>, <span class="italic">Gentleman's Diary</span>, and <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> on astronomical and mathematical subjects. On 8 October 1759 he married Mary Anne, daughter of Henry Wilcocks.<br>
<br>Like other mathematicians Donn was also a surveyor, but his maps were of a quality far above the average. While still in Bideford he began his map of Devon at a scale of one inch to a mile, for which he received a premium of &pound;100 from the Society of Arts on publication in 1765. Donn was one of the first to respond to the society's offer in 1759 of a premium for accurate, newly surveyed county maps at a scale of one inch to a mile, and he was one of the few to succeed in his application. He had apparently planned the survey independently of the society's encouragement, and, as was normal, he issued a prospectus and ultimately enlisted 528 subscribers for the map. Even with the help of assistants the fieldwork took longer than anticipated and there were further delays while Thomas Jefferys engraved the results on twelve plates. Stung by criticism from the society, Donn retorted that his map was &#145;not an Engraver's Job [that is an updating of a more or less out of date map], but an accurate Survey at the expense of nearly &pound;2000 &hellip; the largest work ever done of the kind at private expense&#146;  (Harley, 120). The map is an important early county map because it was newly surveyed and because Donn was an able mathematician and judge of instruments, which increased his standards of accuracy.<br>
<br>In 1764 Donn moved to Bristol, where he leased rooms in the house of the city library in King Street, and from 1766 he ran an academy there to which the corporation and Society of Merchant Venturers had the right to nominate pupils. From the academy he sold his maps and instruments including his navigation scale (a Gunter's scale). In 1767 he announced his intention of publishing a map from a survey of the country 11 miles round Bristol. The city council awarded him 20 guineas on publication in 1769. The map is a valuable source of information on the then rapidly growing city. In 1768 he was elected librarian, but also continued as a mathematics teacher.<br>
<br>Donn was one of a number of educational reformers in Bristol at the time who wanted to stop the rote learning of words and substitute the study of things with the aid of toys or experiments, introducing children to the principles behind each subject so that they could accept rationally what they were taught, not merely believe it slavishly. He taught a practical and vocational curriculum, presenting Newtonian experimental science as an integral part of polite learning for both adults and children. His ideas were expounded in his classes and lectures, in letters to the local press, and in his publications such as <span class="italic">Mathematical Essays</span> (1764), <span class="italic">The Accountant and Geometrician</span> (1765), <span class="italic">The Young Shopkeeper's, Steward's and Factor's Companion</span> (1768), and later <span class="italic">An Essay on Mathematical Geometry</span> (1796).<br>
<br>Between 1765 and 1798 Donn gave at least seventy public lectures, many in Bristol but others over a wide area, in part as a means of establishing a scientific reputation and allowing him to teach a broader curriculum, and in part simply to make money, although since the supply of lecturers exceeded demand, he was not always successful. His audiences were mainly young men, with a few young women and &#145;mechanics&#146;. The lectures were advertised as cultural activities and were illustrated by experiments in which he used instruments of his own making.<br>
<br>Donn attracted an enthusiastic following, gaining civic and public support for his projects, which were thought to be a valuable addition to Bristol's commerce and culture: however, despite his supporters, an impressive range of publications, and active self-promotion through advertisements, he was unable to sustain a local career beyond that of an ordinary mathematics teacher. Such teachers were poorly paid and there was a rapid turnover of them in the city. By 1773 Donn had lost the patronage of the corporation and the Merchant Venturers and, when a new librarian was appointed on 27 March 1773, he had to move his school out of the library house. He set up an academy at The Park, near St Michael's Church, and, when this failed, left Bristol for Kingston, near Taunton, where he ran an academy. From about 1773 he added a final &#145;e&#146; to his surname, apparently reverting to the practice of his grandfather, Christopher Donne. After only two years continued financial troubles took him back to Bristol where he issued a pocket map of the city about 1775. While in Bristol he was helped by another Benjamin Donne (1764&#150;1843), often described as his son but in fact his nephew, who was also a teacher of mathematics, surveyor, and cartographer, and who issued further maps after his uncle's death. From 1796 to his death Benjamin Donne the elder was master of mechanics to George III and the list of subscribers to his <span class="italic">Essay on Mathematical Geometry</span> (1796), which includes such figures as Erasmus Darwin, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, and Josiah Wedgwood, shows the regard in which he was held by contemporaries. He is thought to have had a son, Henry, a Church of England clergyman and minor cartographer. Donne died on 27 May 1798.<br>
