<span class="headword">Herford,  William Henry</span>  (1820&#150;1908), <span class="occ">educationist</span>, was born at Coventry on 20 October 1820, the third surviving son in a family of six sons and three daughters of John Herford and his first wife, Sarah (<i>d</i>. 1831), daughter of Edward Smith of Birmingham, uncle of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25873/', "Joshua Toulmin Smith")</script>. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/49711/', "Edward Herford")</script>, coroner for Manchester, was his elder brother; <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/33833/', "Brooke Herford")</script> was a younger brother. Two other brothers, Charles and William, were active in local public life promoting liberal causes. His youngest sister was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/69105/', "Anne LauraHerford")</script>. His father, who was throughout life a strong Liberal and convinced Unitarian, became a wine merchant in Manchester in 1822, and sat on the Manchester town council from 1838 to 1846. He lived at Altrincham, where his wife, a woman of cultivation and an accomplished artist, conducted a successful girls' school.<br>
<br>After attending a school kept by Charles Wallace, Unitarian minister at Hale Barns, Cheshire, Herford was from 1831 to 1834 a day-boy at Shrewsbury School under Samuel Butler. From 1834 to 1836 he was at Manchester grammar school. Then, being destined for the Unitarian ministry, he was prepared for entry at the ministerial college at York by John Relly Beard, from whom he &#145;first learned by experience that lessons might be made interesting to scholars&#146;  (Herford, 6). From 1837 to 1840 he studied at Manchester College in York, during the principalship of John Kenrick, and there came into contact with German philosophy and theology. He removed with the college from York to Manchester in the summer of 1840, and thus came under the influence of three new professors, Francis Newman, James Martineau, and John James Tayler, the last of whom he regarded as his spiritual father. Graduating BA of London University in the autumn of 1840, he began to preach in Unitarian pulpits, but declined a permanent engagement as minister at Lancaster in order to accept a scholarship for three years' study in Germany. In 1842 he went to Bonn, where he attended the courses of E. M. Arndt, A. W. Schlegel, and F. C. Dahlmann, and formed a close friendship with his contemporary, Wilhelm Ihne. After two years at Bonn he spent eight months in Berlin, where he was admitted to the family circles of the church historian Neander and the microscopist Ehrenberg. After a brief period as preacher to the Unitarian congregation at Edinburgh, he accepted in the summer of 1845 an invitation from a Unitarian congregation at Lancaster, where he remained for a year. In 1846 Lady Noel Byron, widow of the poet, invited him, on James Martineau's recommendation, to undertake the tuition of Ralph King, younger son of her daughter, Ada, countess of Lovelace. Early in 1847 he accompanied the boy to Wilhelm von Fellenberg's Pestalozzian school at Hofwyl, near Bern. Herford developed a close association with Wilhelm von Fellenberg, becoming a temporary teacher on the staff, and accepting with enthusiasm Pestalozzi's and Froebel's educational ideas.<br>
<br>In February 1848 Herford resumed his pastorate at Lancaster, marrying in September 1848 Elizabeth Anne (<i>d</i>. 1880), daughter of Timothy Davis, minister of the Presbyterian chapel at Evesham. Meanwhile he resolved to work out in a systematic way the ideas which he had developed at Hofwyl. In January 1850 Herford, while retaining his ministerial duties, opened at Lancaster a school for boys on Pestalozzian principles. There were no prizes or merit marks, and much stress was laid on self-government by the pupils. Fresh air and physical exercise were essential elements of the regime. Prosperous on the whole, but never large, the school continued with some distinction for eleven years, when a decline in its numbers caused him to transfer it to his brother-in-law, David Davis (1821&#150;1897), a Unitarian minister, under whom the school was later renamed Castle Howell School.<br>
<br>Resigning his pastorate at the same time, Herford with his wife and five children went for eighteen months to Z&uuml;rich in charge of a pupil. On his return in September 1863 he filled the pulpit of the free church in Manchester until 1869, acquiring increasing reputation as a teacher and lecturer, especially to women and girls, teaching at the Ladies' College, Victoria Park. Some of his teaching was given at Brook House School, Knutsford, whose headmistress, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/58222/', "Louisa Carbutt")</script> (later to become Herford's second wife), was educating girls on principles very similar to his own. Herford and his wife formed a plan of a co-educational school for younger children. In April 1873 they opened their co-educational school for pupils aged between seven and thirteen at Fallowfield, Manchester, and afterwards moved it to Lady Barn House, Withington. For twelve years it was run with an individuality of method which had an important local influence. The regime at the school was in opposition to the contemporary emphasis on learning by rote; handwork and physical exercise were part of the curriculum. A supporter of training for kindergarten teachers, Herford was a founder in 1872 of the Manchester Kindergarten Association. At the 1885 conference on education under healthy conditions, he criticized overpressure on elementary school pupils. He was also a prominent supporter of the opening of universities to women, making a courageous speech during the debates in 1878 on allowing women to take London degrees, replying to opposition from the medical faculty with an attack on the double standard in relations between the sexes.<br>
<br>In 1886, following the death of his first wife and his marriage in 1884 to Louisa Carbutt, Herford resigned the school to his second daughter, <a href="#cosubject_58518">Caroline Herford [<i>see below</i>]</a>. In retirement Herford devoted his time to authorship and to travel, publishing in 1889 his chief work, <span class="italic">The School: an Essay towards Humane Education</span>, a masterpiece of English educational writing, which he described as &#145;the fruits of more than forty years of teaching; various in the sex, age, class and nation of its objects&#146;. In 1893 he published <span class="italic">The Student's Froebel</span>, adapted from <span class="italic">Die Menschenerziehung</span> of F. Froebel (1893; revised edn, posthumous, with memoir by C. H. Herford, 1911). This was the best English account of the educational doctrine which it summarized and expounded. In 1890 he settled at Paignton in south Devon. In 1902 he published <span class="italic">Passages from the Life of an Educational Free Lance</span>, a translation of the <span class="italic">Aus dem Leben eines freien P&auml;dagogen</span> of Dr Ewald Haufe. He died at Torbay Lodge, Paignton, on 27 April 1908, and was buried at Paignton.<br>
<br>Herford spoke of himself as having been for the first quarter of a century of his teaching an unconscious follower of F. Froebel, and for the following fifteen years his professed disciple. With Pestalozzi he urged the teacher never to deprive the child of &#145;the sacred right of discovery&#146;, and to seek to bring things, both abstract and concrete, into actual contact with the pupil's senses and mind, putting words and names, &#145;those importunate pretenders&#146;, into a subordinate place. Moral training, &#145;practised not by preaching and as little as possible by punishment, but mainly by example and by atmosphere&#146;, he held to be of supreme importance, and its primary purpose to be &#145;an intellectual clearing and purifying of the moral sense&#146;. To physical training (including play, gymnastics, singing, and handwork) he attached importance only less than that which was assigned to moral culture. Himself a teacher of genius, he disdained any compromise with educational principles or conventions of which he disapproved.<br>

<a name="cosubject_58518"></a><span class="headword">Caroline Herford</span>  (1860&#150;1945)<span class="occ"></span>, subsequently Caroline Herford Blake, was born on 1 November 1860 at 19 Queen Square, Lancaster, and educated at various schools in Manchester, including Lady Barn House, before attending the women's college at Brunswick Street, Manchester, which provided higher education for women before Owens College was opened to them. Resident in 1885 at Newnham College, Cambridge, she later graduated MA at Manchester University. As headmistress of Lady Barn from 1886, she was notable as a pioneer of lacrosse as a school sport. She resigned in 1907 to look after her father following the death of his second wife. After his death, she was briefly a lecturer at University College, Reading, and then lecturer in education at Manchester University from 1910 to 1918. She was a founding member of the Manchester University branch of the British Federation of University Women. Following the family tradition of public service, she was a member of Manchester city council, where she exercised a progressive influence on the education committee until her defeat by a Conservative candidate in 1923. During the war she was a Red Cross commandant in Lancashire, and was appointed MBE in 1919. Leaving Manchester in 1924 on her marriage to Robert Blake (<i>d</i>. 1931), JP, of Yeabridge House, South Petherton, Somerset, husband of her deceased sister, she became a member of Somerset education committee. After her husband's death Caroline Herford Blake lived with a Manchester friend and colleague, Julia Sharpe, at St Martins, Grimms Hill, Great Missenden, Buckinghamshire, where she died on 16 March 1945.<br>
