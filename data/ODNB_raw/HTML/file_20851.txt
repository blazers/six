<span class="headword">Orr,  William</span>  (1766&#150;1797), <span class="occ">Irish nationalist</span>, was probably born in Kilbegs, co. Antrim, to where his father, Samuel Orr, had moved his young family from Coleraine. They were New Light Presbyterians and settled at Farranshane, where William Orr was brought up. The Orrs were small farmers involved in flax-growing, horse-trading, and the operation of a linen-bleaching green at Rathbeg, which provided them with a comfortable income and high-quality accommodation. In 1788 at Duneane Orr married Isabella Greer, with whom he had six children.<br>
<br>Several of William Orr's brothers, uncles, and cousins had joined the revolutionary Society of United Irishmen by 1796 and he was evidently an early and popular member. Well known in the community from his service as a volunteer, sportsman, and an Antrim town freemason, Orr was voted that year on to the United Irish baronial committee which met near Carrickfergus. He contributed articles to the United Irish paper <span class="italic">Northern Star</span> and his name reached the ears of Newry informer Samuel Turner. Orr was arrested at his father's Milltown home on 17 September 1796 on a warrant issued by local magistrate, the Revd George Macartney, vicar of Antrim and Templepatrick. The arrest was made by Macartney's son, Arthur Chichester Macartney, a student at Trinity College, Dublin. Orr was detained in Carrickfergus gaol along with several other prominent United Irishmen seized during a crackdown on the organization's middle ranks. It was alleged that he had administered the United Irish oath to Scottish privates Hugh Wheatly and John Lindsay of the Fifeshire fencibles on 24&#150;25 April 1796. Doubt was later cast on whether the two men were actually soldiers, and both were advanced considerable sums from secret service funds by the crown solicitor, John Pollock. Wheatly was subsequently revealed to be suicidal and a suspected murderer.<br>
<br>The recently enacted <span class="roman">Insurrection Act</span> (36 George III) had reclassified the offence of administering an illegal oath from a transportable to a capital felony and this served to focus unusual attention on the Orr case. His lawyers, John Philpot Curran and William Sampson, were confident of acquittal given that their client's innocence was widely accepted. James Hope, a key Ulster organizer, apprised historian R. R. Madden many years later that William McKeever, a Derry city delegate, had made the approach to Wheatly and Lindsay at Jack Gourlay's barn in Farranshane. Orr had been present but had not trusted the two strangers in uniform.<br>
<br>Orr was held on remand in Carrickfergus gaol with many other United Irish prisoners and wore a green necktie as a sign of his radical politics. He was not brought to trial, however, until 17 September 1797 when judges Barry Yelverton and William Tankerville Chamberlain considered the case presented by prosecuting counsel Arthur Wolfe (later Lord Kilwarden). The jury deliberated all night and, having consulted the judges on a point of law, recommended that Orr be found guilty but worthy of clemency. He was brought up for sentencing the following day, at which time Chamberlain refused to consider Curran's protest at the inebriated state of the jury. In accordance with the law Yelverton had no option but to pronounce sentence of death, a task he performed with, reputedly, great emotion and reluctance. Orr made a statement protesting his innocence while his supporters prepared an appeal.<br>
<br>Orr's wife enlisted the support of Lady Londonderry who, according to Mary Ann McCracken, presented the appeal to her powerful brother, Lord Castlereagh. McCracken also ascertained that the elderly Alexander Thompson of Cushendall, foreman of the jury, had been threatened with violence and financial ruin if he failed to convict. Two other jury members claimed they had erred in their deliberations owing to drunkenness. More remarkable was Wheatly's admission that he had perjured himself in his affidavit against Orr and during the trial. The cumulative effect of the revelations suggested that Orr had been framed by the authorities to ensure the smooth running of a potentially vital test case. Several loyalists were convinced that a miscarriage of justice had occurred, but the lord lieutenant, Lord Camden, refused to intercede.<br>
<br>James Orr, brother of the prisoner, claimed in a letter to <span class="italic">The Press</span> of 28 October 1797 to have received assurances that clemency would be granted if William acknowledged his crime. This course was flatly rejected by William Orr, and James decided to forge a declaration of guilt which was seized upon by those wishing to uphold the verdict. An attempt to bribe the gaoler failed and the execution date, twice postponed, arrived without compromise. Orr wore his green ribbon to the gallows green outside Carrickfergus on 14 October 1797. He was buried at Templepatrick after a funeral procession viewed by thousands who defied a heavy military presence.<br>
<br>Orr became the first major martyr of the United Irishmen and the slogan &#145;Remember Orr&#146; soon replaced &#145;Remember Armagh&#146; in their toasts, propaganda, and memorabilia. William Drennan's poem, &#145;Wake of William Orr&#146;, was immediately popular, as was William Sampson's suppressed trial account. The case precipitated an action for seditious libel against <span class="italic">The Press</span> for the assertion by &#145;Marcus&#146; (Deane Swift) that Orr should have been pardoned. The printer, Peter Finnerty, was convicted, imprisoned for two years, fined &pound;20, and obliged to find a large security. Orr was survived by his wife, but his family was burnt out of their home by the military in the aftermath of the battle of Antrim in June 1798.<br>
