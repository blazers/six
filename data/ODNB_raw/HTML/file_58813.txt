<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Keller,  Hans Heinrich</span>  (1919&#150;1985), <span class="occ">broadcaster and writer on music</span>, was born at Nusswaldgasse 13, D&ouml;bling, Vienna, Austria, on 11 March 1919, the son of the architect Fritz Keller (<i>d</i>. 1939) and his wife, Grete Grotte (1883&#150;1959); he had one half-sister, Gertrud Franey (<i>d</i>. 1998). Raised in the well-to-do suburb of D&ouml;bling, he passed his Abitur at the local Landerziehungsheim (1935&#150;8) while benefiting from involvement in his parents' cultural circle, which included the composer Franz Schmidt. He was imprisoned, interrogated, and released by the Nazis (he described himself as an &#145;unpious Jew&#146;), an episode movingly recalled in his &#145;Vienna 1938&#146; (published in <span class="italic">The Listener</span> on 28 March 1974), and on 20 December 1938 he fled to join his relatives in England. After internment on the Isle of Man, he settled in London for the rest of his life and formed a partnership with the German artist Milein Cosman (<i>b</i>. 1921), whom he eventually married on 27 March 1961.<br>
<br>A brilliant but unconventional writer (he was a self-styled &#145;anti-critic&#146;), Keller drew on an unusual range of experience. In the 1940s he took his licentiate of the Royal Academy of Music, played violin in string quartets and orchestras, and later became a coach (or &#145;anti-coach&#146;) of string quartets; he reviewed film music, and in a book's worth of polemical notices, essays, and pamphlets related practice to (his own) theory; he began to champion the music of Benjamin Britten, on whom he edited an influential collection of essays (1952); he wrote music and dramas (though little remains) as well as the librettos for Benjamin Frankel's opera <span class="italic">Marching Song</span> and Josef Tal's <span class="italic">Der Turm</span>. He later taught composition and translated librettos; in 1949&#150;52 he emerged as a forceful critic through his contributions to <span class="italic">Music Review</span>; and with Donald Mitchell he also edited the lively <span class="italic">Music Survey</span>. Indeed, such was the impact of his intense, witty, companionable, yet highly combative personality that in 1959 he joined the BBC at the suggestion of William Glock. There he worked for twenty years in various senior capacities and helped to establish the European Broadcasting Union; he also set new standards with his short talks, interviews, programme booklets, and extended analyses of classical chamber music. After his retirement from the BBC in March 1979 he became visiting professor at McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, which he revisited during a tour of Canada and the United States in 1980. Until 1985 he also coached string quartets at the Yehudi Menuhin School and the Guildhall School of Music and Drama, and spoke in many other venues. On 30 September 1985 the president of Austria awarded him the Ehrenkreuz f&uuml;r Wissenschaft und Kunst, 1. Klasse, and on 23 February 1986 Channel 4 showed a posthumous documentary, <span class="italic">The Keller Instinct</span>.<br>
<br>His unpublished papers in the university library, Cambridge, show the origins of his thought. During the 1940s he worked closely with sociologists, and in his reactions to both their investigations into small-group psychology and his own into fire brigades, tank crews, clubs, schools, prostitutes, and string quartets he drew on an informed understanding of psychoanalysis. This he acquired partly through self-analysis and partly through the works of Sigmund Freud, Alfred Adler, Ernest Jones, Edward Glover, and J. C. Flugel. In addition, he developed a crystalline prose style in which paradox and aphorism held pride of place. For example, he wrote that &#145;Art arises where the arbitrary and the predictable are superseded by unpredictable inevitability&#146;  (Keller, &#145;Quotation&#146;, 25). He was thus well equipped to comment lucidly and provocatively on any issue of the day&#151;from the need to abolish capital punishment to Hitler, women's liberation, and the individual merits of members of the Brazilian football team. Some of these topics, together with a typically astute appraisal of the contemporary music scene, reappeared in Keller's book <span class="italic">1975 (1984 minus 9)</span> (1977). The psychosociological perspective also emerged in his exploration of the &#145;artistic personalities&#146; of composers from Haydn to his own day, and in his analyses of opera (mainly by Schoenberg and Britten). His understanding of culture emerged in <span class="italic">The Jerusalem Diary</span> (2001) and his sustained and formidable critique of critics and audiences found full expression in <span class="italic">Criticism</span> (1987).<br>
<br>Psychological concerns also informed his purely musical writings. Keller drew on the analytical models of Arnold Schoenberg (who had promoted a &#145;physiological&#146;, organic awareness rather than a dryly &#145;anatomical&#146; one), and devised a series of fifteen &#145;functional analyses&#146; of music, mainly by Haydn, Mozart, and Beethoven, to show how &#145;latent&#146; unity lay behind &#145;manifest&#146; contrast. These Spenglerian demonstrations eschewed words on the grounds that musical and conceptual logic are unrelated. He devised a &#145;two-dimensional theory of music&#146; to show how the &#145;foreground&#146; of what composers did was projected against the &#145;background&#146; of what they or others had done before (&#145;form is the sum total of our expectations&#146;); he then pursued this theory in all musical dimensions&#151;rhythm, pitch, key, timbre, and form. He also championed Schoenberg's twelve-note method of composing, and related classical to modern practice. His principal works were <span class="italic">The Great Haydn Quartets: their Interpretation</span> (1986) and <span class="italic">Stravinsky Seen and Heard</span> (in collaboration with Milein Cosman, 1982); he wrote voluminously on Mozart and Schoenberg in scattered articles, and sustained important columns on &#145;The new in music&#146; and &#145;Truth and music&#146;. A bibliography appeared in <span class="italic">Music Analysis</span>, 5.2/3 (1986), and was followed by selected <span class="italic">Essays on Music</span> (1994).<br>
<br>Hans Keller had a conspicuous appearance, with a thin, short-to-medium physique, a high forehead, an aquiline nose, a moustache, a measured, unfaltering diction, and penetrating eyes. According to his <span class="italic">Times</span> obituarist:<blockquote>he could be aggravatingly contradictory and/or challenging, never allowing any statement to pass without a challenge from his active thoughts on the matter. Though superficially prickly, he was&#151;to those who knew him well&#151;kind and considerate. He was a great soccer enthusiast and loved to talk about the game almost as much as music. (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 7 Nov 1985)</blockquote>He died childless from motor neurone disease at his home, 3 Frognal Gardens, Hampstead, on 6 November 1985 and was cremated at Golders Green crematorium. He was one of many distinguished Austro-German &eacute;migr&eacute;s who enriched British musical culture in the post-war years.<br>
