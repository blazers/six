<span class="headword">Lucas,  Louis Arthur</span>  (1851&#150;1876), <span class="occ">merchant and traveller in Africa</span>, was born on 22 September 1851 at Temple House, Cheetham, Manchester, the only surviving son of Philip Lucas and his wife, Juliana. <a name="cosubject_53118"></a><span class="headword">Philip Lucas</span>  (1797&#150;1865), <span class="occ">cotton merchant</span>, was born in 1797 in Kingston, Jamaica, the son of Sampson Lucas, a cotton trader who made his fortune in the West Indies before settling in London where he died in 1820. Philip was connected to wealthy Jewish merchant circles in London, through his elder brother Louis, and in Manchester, through his sister Anne, who was the wife of S. L. Behrens, one of the earliest and most successful Jewish immigrants in Manchester. Philip was the senior partner in Lucas and Micholls: Henry Micholls was Lucas's nephew and married Frederica, Behrens's daughter, strengthening family and business ties. In 1834 the firm set up in Brown Street, Manchester, as merchants and cotton spinners at a time when many merchants from London and continental Europe were establishing agencies in the town to gain a stake in the lucrative cotton trade. Lucas and Micholls was one of several Jewish firms to join this trend, but was unusual in setting out to control all stages in the cotton business, from the manufacturing and finishing of cottons and calicoes to their distribution in the overseas market. In Manchester, Lucas rapidly assumed a high place in middle-class Jewish and gentile circles. He supported Jewish institutions, such as the Jewish school in the foundation of which he was instrumental, and followed Moses Montefiore in standing against antisemitism. None the less, he sent his own son to a non-Jewish school and hoped for a national secular school system into which Jewish children could be integrated. He was a moderating influence and mediator between the groups into which Manchester Jews were split. He was an active anti-cornlaw campaigner, was elected a city councillor in 1851 (to the approval of Jew and gentile), and in 1858 was elected to the board of the very influential Manchester chamber of commerce. He maintained a fine residence at Temple House, Cheetham Hill Road, where he lived with his wife, Juliana (1825/6&#150;1873), daughter of the mathematician <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/10933/', "Benjamin Gompertz")</script>, his one surviving son, Louis, and seven domestic servants. His wife undertook philanthropic work among Jews. Lucas died at 1 Ebenezer Terrace, Kennington Park, Surrey, on 30 July 1865. After his death he lapsed into an obscurity from which he has only recently been rescued, while his son, an unremarkable explorer, able to travel because of his father's wealth, had his exploits and death widely noticed.<br>
<br>Louis Lucas was educated at University College School, London, and at University College, where he showed a preference for scientific subjects. After a trip to Switzerland in 1870, he visited the United States in 1872, reaching as far west as Nebraska. At the end of 1873 he set out for Egypt hoping to improve his health, but contracted typhoid fever and spent some months convalescing. In July 1875 he announced his intention of exploring Africa, beginning in the Congo, despite his poor health. He organized an expedition independent of the Royal Geographical Society, of which he was an associate. He left London on 2 September 1875 and spent some weeks in Cairo learning Arabic and engaging servants. He travelled via Suez, Suakin, and Berber to arrive in Khartoum in January 1876. After making preparations there for an absence of several years, he left in April and sailed up the White Nile in a steamboat lent by Colonel Charles George Gordon to Lado, where he met Gordon. Together they travelled to the Albert Nyanza (Lake Albert) and Lucas was the first to sail on its northern waters in a steamship. Gordon persuaded Lucas to return to Suez, go thence to Zanzibar, reorganize his expedition, and make a fresh start for the interior; but at Khartoum, Lucas was delayed two months by fever and dysentery. He reached Suakin on 18 November and embarked for Suez but died on board the steamship <i>Massowah</i> in the Red Sea on 20 November 1876. He was buried at Jiddah. He compiled a Bishareen vocabulary which was published in the Anthropological Institute's <span class="italic">Journal</span>. Lucas's fortune was valued for probate record at under &pound;60,000: he was described in his probate record as a merchant.<br>
