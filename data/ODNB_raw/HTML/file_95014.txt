<span class="headword">Pelham <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Catesby; <em>other married name </em>Dormer]</span>,  Dorothy</span>, Lady Pelham  (<em>d.</em> 1613), <span class="occ">benefactor</span>, was the daughter of Anthony Catesby (<i>d</i>. 1554) of Whiston, Northamptonshire, where he built the existing parish church, and his wife, Isabel. She had at least one brother, John. About 1550 Dorothy married <a name="cosubject_95014"></a><span class="headword">Sir William Dormer</span>  (1512?&#150;1575)<span class="occ"></span> of Eythrope and Wing in Buckinghamshire, as his second wife. William was the only son of Sir Robert Dormer (1485/6&#150;1552), a wealthy wool merchant and grazier who settled at Wing about 1520, and his wife, Jane Newdigate. His parents were conservative in religion, and Lady Dormer's brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/68241/', "Sebastian Newdigate")</script>, was one of the London Carthusians executed in 1535 for refusing the oath of supremacy. William, who certainly retained strongly Catholic sympathies throughout his life, had at least four children from his first marriage, two sons who died in infancy, and two daughters, Ann, who married Sir William Hungerford, and Jane, who became duchess of Feria [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7836/', "Su&#225;rez de Figueroa, Jane")</script>]. Jane was born in 1538 at Eythrope, where the family had a private chapel; William himself lived there from 1535 until 1559, when he moved to Wing.<br>
<br>Priests and others fleeing religious persecution are said to have been sheltered at Eythrope during Edward VI's reign, and Sir William Dormer was visited there by the Spanish ambassador, Diego Guzm&aacute;n de Silva, in 1566. Dormer had been made a knight of the Bath on 29 September 1553, two days before Queen Mary's coronation. His daughter Jane, following her marriage in 1558 to Philip II's representative in England, settled in Spain, where she became the recognized leader of the English Catholic exiles at King Philip's court. A year later, in 1559, Sir William's mother exiled herself to Louvain, where her home became a base for English Catholics until her death in 1571. Her son continued to send her money, and their correspondence was reportedly watched. In 1564 he was himself listed as a &#145;hinderer&#146; of religion. Even so, he (and later his son) must have conformed outwardly to the Church of England both before 1547 and after 1558, for at no time did his Catholicism prevent his playing an active part in county administration and politics. Sir William was MP for Wycombe in 1542, a knight of the shire for Buckinghamshire in 1553, 1558, and 1571, and sheriff of Bedfordshire and Buckinghamshire in 1553&#150;4 and 1568&#150;9. He seems to have owed his relative immunity to his close friendship with the local magnate Francis Russell, second earl of Bedford, who was a committed protestant. He is credited with having commissioned the superb Renaissance-style monument to his father in Wing parish church, described as &#145;one of the finest of its period in England&#146;  (<span class="italic">Buckinghamshire</span>, 751), and was himself buried there on 30 May 1575 following his death on the 17th. With Dorothy he had one son, Robert (1550/51&#150;1616), who succeeded to his father's estates, and six daughters, three of whom, Mary, Katherine, and Margaret, survived into adulthood and were still living in 1613. In his will Sir William left a life interest in various lands and manors in Buckinghamshire to his &#145;entirely beloved wife&#146; Dorothy, in addition to her jointure, and also the use of his lodgings in the Savoy Hospital for visits to London.<br>
<br>After her husband's death Lady Dorothy resided on her jointure estate at Eythrope. Her second marriage, to the soldier and military engineer <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21800/', "Sir William Pelham")</script>, whose first wife had died in 1574, may have occurred as early as 1576. Pelham, whose religious sympathies seem to have been puritanical, had extensive interests in former monastic properties in Lincolnshire (some of them purchased jointly with his second wife) and served in Ireland from 1579 to 1580, acting briefly as lord justice during this period. In 1586 he went to the Netherlands, and died of wounds at Flushing on 24 November 1587. There were no children of his marriage to Dorothy. In his will, dated June 1586, Pelham (who styled himself as of Eythrope), left her an income estimated at 800 marks (&pound;533 6<i>s</i>. 8<i>d</i>.) per annum for life, to be paid from his estates in recompense for her portion and dower. But as he died heavily in debt, there must be some doubt as to how much of this bequest she actually received.<br>
<br>It was presumably during her second widowhood that Lady Dorothy founded and endowed the almshouses, consisting of a range of four stone cottages, that are now known as the Dormer Hospital in Wing. She seems to have intended to honour the memory of her first husband, since a plaque over the entrance identified the foundress as &#145;some time wife of Sir William Dormer, Knight, Lord of this Manor of Winge&#146;  (Lipscomb, 3.525), albeit with the clearly erroneous date 1569. In 1862 the number of inmates was given as eight. She also erected an elaborate family monument (an inscription records its completion on 20 October 1590) in the chancel of Wing parish church, commemorating her first husband, both his wives and their issue, and incorporating conventional effigies of herself, Sir William Dormer, and their seven children, but ignoring Sir William Pelham. She is said to have made additions about 1610 to the mansion at Eythrope (demolished 200 years later). In her will, drawn up on 24 June 1611, Lady Dorothy requested burial next to her first husband, and in a codicil dated 19 September 1613 she left &pound;100 to be spent in varying proportions on the relief of the needy and the repair of the highways in the three neighbouring market towns of Aylesbury, High Wycombe, and Leighton Buzzard, and in nearly all the parishes in which she held land. The bequest resulted in the establishment of permanent charities in Aylesbury and High Wycombe, which were augmented in their turn under the will of her son Robert, who had been created first Baron Dormer of Wing in 1615, the year before he died. The preamble to her will shows that Dorothy Pelham shared the protestantism of her second husband, rather than the Catholicism of her first. She died on 30 September 1613, and was recorded in the Wing burial register as &#145;The Good Lady Dame Dorothe Pelham&#146;.<br>
