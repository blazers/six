<span class="headword">Hanbury,  Harold Greville</span>  (1898&#150;1993), <span class="occ">jurist</span>, was born on 19 June 1898 at Compton Verney, Wellesbourne, Warwickshire, the only child of Basil Hanbury (1862&#150;1933), gentleman of independent means, and his wife, Patience, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Verney (1873/4&#150;1965), younger daughter of Henry Verney, eighteenth Baron Willoughby de Broke. He was educated at Warren Hall, Eastbourne, and Charterhouse School, before going up to Brasenose College, Oxford, on a classical scholarship in 1915. During the First World War his father served as a major in the Warwickshire yeomanry, and was made honorary lieutenant-colonel. Hanbury himself enlisted in 1916, serving first in the Artists' Rifles and then (as a lieutenant) in his father's regiment. In 1939, on the outbreak of the Second World War, he re-enlisted, and served as a staff captain until 1942 when he was discharged to run courses for allied troops. It was not surprising that patriotism was an important element in his life.<br>
<br>After the First World War Hanbury returned to Oxford, and took his degree in jurisprudence in 1920, being awarded the Vinerian scholarship. He then came top in the examination for bachelor of civil law in 1921. In that same year he was elected a fellow of Lincoln College. He remained there as a fellow for twenty-eight years, and was an honorary fellow thereafter. On 21 July 1927 he married Anna Margaret Geelmuyden Dreyer (<i>d</i>. 1980), daughter of Hannibal Dreyer of Copenhagen, and niece of Georges Dreyer, professor of pathology at Oxford.<br>
<br>At the time of Hanbury's election Lincoln College was less distinguished than it later became, and its poverty was renowned. Hanbury, however, became the archetypal Lincoln man, serving as dean, senior tutor, and sub-rector. His style fitted in well with the Oxford of the &#145;Brideshead&#146; generation, with rather limited academic expectations of undergraduate commoners at a typical college. Expectations of college tutors were also modest, but this did not prevent Hanbury from publishing <span class="italic">Essays in Equity</span> (1934), <span class="italic">Modern Equity</span> (1935)&#151;a textbook which ran to thirteen editions by 1989&#151;and a brief history, <span class="italic">English Courts of Law</span> (1944; fifth edn, 1979).<br>
<br>Hanbury was immensely popular with his undergraduates. He and his wife entertained warmly and generously. Having no children of his own he took an especially keen interest in the lives and successes of his former pupils. He loved cricket, and also liked cats and was vice-president of the Oxford Cat Club. He was the model of a college man of that era. He was active in university affairs, and served as senior proctor twice, in 1933&#150;4 and 1944&#150;5.<br>
<br>Hanbury was a disciple (and literary executor) of Sir William Holdsworth, the leading academic lawyer of the inter-war years, at a time when academic law in England was in the doldrums. He and A. L. Goodhart edited the last four volumes of Holdsworth's <span class="italic">History of English Law</span> (1952&#150;66); the final volume was put together from boxes of notes found after Holdsworth's death. The newly created readership in equity was offered to Hanbury in 1948 and it seemed an appropriate reward for college and university service. When in the following year Hanbury was elected Vinerian professor and thus fellow of All Souls, there was considerable surprise, his success owing more to the dislike of more obvious candidates than to Hanbury's academic distinction. He held the chair until 1964 without producing any significant research, though he published the engaging <span class="italic">Vinerian Chair and Legal Education</span> in 1958. He remained a popular figure: his rather discursive style of lecturing and writing was appreciated by a core of admirers. His tall, ambling, spare figure was a familiar Oxford sight.<br>
<br>Hanbury served on a number of government committees inquiring into industrial disputes (such as the committee of inquiry into the provincial omnibus industry, 1954) and as chairman of inquiries in the West Indies (board of inquiry into West Indian Airways, 1958) and Gibraltar (tribunal for industrials, 1960). He was an honorary bencher of the Inner Temple, London, and was made an honorary QC in 1960. In 1962&#150;3 he served as visiting professor and acting dean of the law faculty at the new University of Ife, Nigeria; and, following his retirement as Vinerian professor, he was dean of the law faculty at the University of Nigeria from 1964 to 1966. He was subsequently an advocate of the Biafran cause, publishing <span class="italic">Biafra: a Challenge to the Conscience of Britain</span> in 1968.<br>
<br>Following the death of his wife in 1980, Hanbury was consumed with grief and went to live with a god-daughter in South Africa, whence he bombarded friends and acquaintances with letters. He died in a nursing home in Pinetown, Natal, South Africa, on 12 March 1993.<br>
