<span class="headword">Spooner,  William Charles</span>  (1809?&#150;1885), <span class="occ">veterinary surgeon</span>, was born at Blandford, Dorset, where his father is said to have been an innkeeper. He was in no way related to his namesake, Charles Spooner (1806&#150;1871), with whom he has frequently been confused. He entered the Royal Veterinary College, London, in November 1827, and obtained his diploma on 7 March 1829. While at the college he presented two papers to the London Veterinary Medical Society, one on glanders and farcy and the other on staggers. He went into practice at Southampton, where he established a veterinary infirmary, forge, and register office for the sale of horses, at Vincent's Walk, Hanover Buildings.<br>
<br>In 1845, however, Spooner largely gave up his veterinary practice and entered into partnership with a Mr Bennett, manufacturer of chemical manures at Eling Hill Farm, near Eling, in Hampshire. Spooner subsequently purchased the Old Bone Mill at Eling, and the Spooner and Bailey Chemical Manure Works became perhaps the most complete of their kind in the south of England. Spooner lectured regularly at various clubs and societies in Hampshire and the adjoining counties. He also played a leading part in the Botley and South Hampshire Farmers' Club.<br>
<br>Spooner was a frequent contributor to the earlier numbers of <span class="italic">The Veterinarian</span> and the <span class="italic">Journal of the Royal Agricultural Society</span>, and he gained a prize from the society for two essays in the <span class="italic">Journal</span>&#151;&#145;On the use of superphosphate of lime produced with acid and bones for manure&#146;  (1846, 7.143), and &#145;On the management of farm horses&#146;  (1848, 9.249). In 1852 he was awarded a prize by the Bath and West of England Agricultural Society for his essay &#145;On the most economical and profitable method of growing and consuming root crops&#146;. This essay was printed among the society's proceedings for 1854. In the same year a water drill that he had invented was exhibited at Pusey, and was much praised.<blockquote>Mr Spooner has been a writer, lecturer, public-spirited promoter in every way of agricultural improvement &hellip; His strong commonsense, well tempered enthusiasm, sound judgement and wide intelligence, had for years exerted a most useful influence on both local and general agricultural progress.</blockquote>Spooner wrote many books and articles on veterinary and agricultural subjects, of which <span class="italic">The History, Structure, Economy and Diseases of Sheep</span> (1844) is perhaps the most well known. However, several other titles should also be mentioned, for example, <span class="italic">A Treatise on the Influenza of Horses</span> (1837), <span class="italic">A Treatise on the Structure, Functions, and Diseases of the Foot and Leg of the Horse</span> (1840), and <span class="italic">A Treatise on Manures</span> (1847). For the <span class="italic">Encyclopaedia metropolitana</span> Spooner wrote the article &#145;Veterinary art&#146;, which was subsequently published separately. He contributed to John Morton's <span class="italic">Encyclopaedia of Agriculture</span>, which was published between 1848 and 1853. He edited, and in part rewrote, in 1842, James White's two treatises, <span class="italic">A Compendium of the Veterinary Art</span>, and <span class="italic">A Compendium of Cattle Medicine</span>, which contained &#145;the first short account in the English language of the foot and mouth disease which prevailed in England and Ireland from about 1838 to 1840&#146;. Spooner also wrote on a wide range of other agricultural topics.<br>
<br>Towards the end of his life Spooner concentrated his attention almost solely on the manufacture of superphosphate and other artificial manures. He suffered greatly throughout life from deafness, which eventually led to his retirement from active life. He died of apoplexy on 3 May 1885 at Eling House, his residence at Eling. He left a widow, Caroline, and a son, Albert.<br>
