<span class="headword">Blochmann,  Henry Ferdinand <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>Heinrich Ferdinand]</span></span>  (1838&#150;1878), <span class="occ">orientalist</span>, was born in Dresden, Germany, on 7 or 8 January 1838, the son of Ernest Ehrenfried Blochmann, printer, and nephew of Karl Justus Blochmann, a distinguished pupil of Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi. He was educated at the Kreuzschule in Dresden and the University of Leipzig (1855), where he studied oriental languages under H. L. Fleischer, and afterwards (1857) under Haase at Paris. In the following year he came to England. Eager to visit India and to study eastern languages further, he enlisted in the British army in 1858, and went out to India as a private soldier.<br>
<br>Blochmann's linguistic and other abilities became known on the voyage to India, however, and soon after his arrival in Calcutta he was set to do office work in Fort William College, and gave lessons in Persian. In the course of about a year he obtained his discharge, and for a time entered the service of the Peninsular and Oriental Company as an interpreter. He was befriended by the Arabic scholar William Nassau Lees of Calcutta, who had assisted in obtaining his discharge, and through whom he obtained, at the age of twenty-two, his first government appointment (1860), as assistant professor of Arabic and Persian in the Calcutta madrasa. In 1861 he graduated MA and LLD at the University of Calcutta, choosing Hebrew for the subject of his examination. In the following year he was appointed pro-rector and professor of mathematics at Doveton College. In 1865 he returned to the madrasa; he remained there for the rest of his life and was principal at his death.<br>
<br>Though Blochmann made some archaeological tours in India and British Burma, he generally lived quietly in Calcutta, worked hard at Persian and Arabic, and in 1868 became philological secretary to the Asiatic Society of Bengal. He contributed extensively to the society's <span class="italic">Journal</span> and <span class="italic">Proceedings</span>. He wrote competently on anything connected with the history of Islamic India, but the most elaborate and valuable of his papers were his &#145;Contributions to the history and geography of Bengal&#146;  (<span class="italic">Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal</span>, vols. 42, 43, 44, 1873&#150;5). The work, however, on which his fame mainly rests is his translation of the <span class="italic">A&#146;in-i-Akbari</span> of Abu'l-Fazl, the first attempt at a thorough translation of the original. Blochmann did not live to translate more than the first volume (Calcutta, 1873), and the work was completed by H. S. Jarrett. Blochmann's notes are full and accurate, and throw a flood of light on the emperor Akbar and his court, and on the administration of the Mughal empire. Prefixed to the translation is a life of Abu'l-Fazl. Another important work was <span class="italic">The Prosody of the Persians</span> (Calcutta, 1872). With all his learning, Blochmann was the most modest of men, and welcomed criticism and correction.<br>
<br>Overwork and the exhausting climate caused Blochmann's early death on 13 July 1878 in Calcutta. He was buried in the Circular Road cemetery, Calcutta. He married an Irishwoman, who survived him, and left three children.<br>
