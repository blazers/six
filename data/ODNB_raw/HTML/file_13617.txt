<span class="headword">Holt,  John</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1504), <span class="occ">schoolmaster and grammarian</span>, was the son of William Holt (or Smyth), sometime mayor and tradesman of Chichester, Sussex, and, apparently, his first wife, Joan. His schooling may have taken place in Chichester, but he is first recorded being admitted as a probationary fellow of Magdalen College, Oxford, on 27 July 1490, becoming a full fellow one year later. He graduated MA in 1494, and by Michaelmas of that year was employed as usher or second master of Magdalen College School, then in its heyday as a pioneer centre of humanist Latin teaching. Holt left this post at Easter 1496 (having been ordained priest in the previous year) to become grammar master of the boys and youths of Archbishop Morton's household at Lambeth Palace. There he wrote his surviving grammatical work, <span class="italic">Lac puerorum</span>.<br>
<br>In 1498 Morton rewarded Holt with the valuable rectory of Smarden, Kent, and after the archbishop's death in 1500 Holt appears to have withdrawn to this parish. In September 1501, however, he accepted a new full-time teaching appointment from the dean and chapter of Chichester Cathedral as master of Chichester prebendal (or cathedral) school. The school had been endowed two years previously by Bishop Story of Chichester with the cathedral prebend of Highleigh, providing the master with a salary to teach without charging fees. Holt held the post for only about a year before leaving, by the end of 1502, for a fourth scholastic appointment as grammar master to Prince Henry (later Henry VIII), in succession to John Skelton. In 1502 he was also presented to the rectory of Week St Mary, Cornwall, by Sir Edmund Arundell, possibly through the influence of Arundell's relative the bishop of Exeter, a colleague of Morton and Story. This benefice (which he held with Smarden by papal dispensation) made him a wealthy man, but by 21 March 1504 he had fallen sufficiently ill to make his will at St Paul's, London, and he was dead by 14 June.<br>
<br>Holt was one of a group of schoolmasters associated with Magdalen College School, including John Anwykyll (<i>d</i>. 1487), William Lily (<i>d</i>. 1522), and John Stanbridge (<i>d</i>. 1510), who were influential in spreading the teaching of humanist Latin to schools in England through the publication of school textbooks. His own published work, <span class="italic">Lac puerorum</span>, subtitled <span class="italic">Mylke for Chyldren</span>, survives only in editions printed after the author's death, the earliest about 1505, but it contains a dedication to Morton, then dead, and verses by Holt which state that it was written with the archbishop's approval in the hall of Lambeth Palace: evidently between 1496 and 1500. It was prefaced and concluded by complimentary Latin verses by Thomas More (<i>d</i>. 1535), whose earliest surviving letter was also written to Holt in 1501. <span class="italic">Lac puerorum</span> is an elementary textbook in English, introducing pupils to Latin accidence, grammatical definitions, and syntax. Though traditional in form, it tries to help children in the first stages of learning Latin by the novel practice of using pictures to present the declensions of nouns and by employing simple words (&#145;showing&#146;, &#145;asking&#146;, &#145;bidding&#146;, and &#145;wishing&#146;) to explain the moods of the verb. The work had a modest success, being published at least five times before about 1511 in London and Antwerp, before it lost the field to grammars like those of Stanbridge and Lily.<br>
