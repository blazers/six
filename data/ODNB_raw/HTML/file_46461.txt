<span class="headword">Seaton,  Roger  of</span>  (<em>c.</em>1230&#150;<em>c.</em>1280), <span class="occ">justice</span>, belonged to a family that took its name from Seaton in Rutland. The fact that he is first recorded as an attorney <i>c</i>.1253 suggests that he was born about 1230, possibly at Seaton. Later evidence suggests that he may have studied canon law at Oxford; by 1258 he was styled <i>magister</i>. By 1260 he was utilizing his knowledge of canon law in service as the official and commissary-general of Walter of Kirkham, bishop of Durham (<i>d</i>. 1260), in all matters delegated to the bishop by the Holy See. He was also in the service of Kirkham's successor, Robert of Stichill (<i>d</i>. 1274). He may have been his chancellor, and was later one of his executors.<br>
<br>In 1268, in what looks like a major change of career, Seaton switched from a world where his training in canon law was of immediate practical use to one where it was only of limited relevance, by entering the king's service as one of the justices of the common-law courts. His first period as a justice of the common bench started in Hilary term 1268. He left the court after Hilary term 1271 to lead an eyre circuit that visited the counties of south-eastern and eastern England. Although the circuit was brought to a premature end in mid-November 1272, with the death of Henry III, Seaton was immediately reappointed to the common bench, and on the death of Gilbert of Preston became the court's chief justice as from the beginning of Hilary term 1274. He served as chief justice of the court until the end of Trinity term 1278. The few surviving law reports from this period indicate that what he said was thought worth recording, but provide too little material to allow any real estimate of his professional abilities. During this period Seaton also acted as the justice of an assize circuit in 1273&#150;4 and headed the eyres held in Middlesex in 1274 and in London and in Bedfordshire in 1276. He was also nominal sheriff of Northamptonshire from late 1272 to October 1274, and gave a speech on the king's behalf to the autumn parliament of 1275, explaining the king's need for money.<br>
<br>It was probably soon after his retirement from the common bench that Seaton suffered a stroke. He entered the Augustinian house at Thornton in Lincolnshire in 1279, having already appointed executors who were allowed to collect his debts and pay his debtors as though he were dead. They included Master Oliver Sutton, later bishop of Lincoln, who is known to have studied canon and civil law at Oxford, and Master Nicholas of Higham who may also have studied at Oxford. Seaton probably died not long after his entry into Thornton; his brother, Richard of Seaton, was his heir.<br>
<br>Roger of Seaton held a number of valuable ecclesiastical livings, many of which he seems to have held simultaneously. One of his earliest livings was at Wicken in Northamptonshire to which he was presented by John Fitzalan of Wolverton, who seems to have been an early patron. He also held the living of Seaton and the Northamptonshire churches of Maidwell and Earls Barton, the Yorkshire church of Rowley, the Durham church of Egglescliffe, the Cambridgeshire church of Over, and the Sussex church of Broadwater. In addition he had prebends in York Minster and Lincoln Cathedral, and was master of the hospital of Sherburn, co. Durham.<br>
