<span class="headword">Castleman,  Christopher Norman Anthony</span>  (1941&#150;2006), <span class="occ">merchant banker</span>, was born Christopher Norman Phillips on 23 June 1941 at St Joseph's Nursing Home, Beaconsfield, the son of Stanley Howard Phillips, a P&amp;O purser then serving in the Royal Naval Reserve, and his wife, Joan Doris, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Bennett-Levy. He was given the third name Anthony as an infant and adopted his stepfather's surname of Castleman as a schoolboy. He was educated at Harrow School and Clare College, Cambridge, where he took a first in law. After graduation in 1963 he joined the middle-ranking merchant bank M. Samuel &amp; Co. Two years later it was acquired by Philip Hill Higginson, the combined firm, Hill Samuel, becoming one of the City's largest merchant banks. Hill Samuel was the creation of Kenneth Keith, one of the most forceful merchant bankers of the post-war decades. His ambition was to build a top City firm, and his philosophy was &#145;big is beautiful&#146;. Keith insisted on hard work and professionalism, and disdained the gentlemanly amateurism that was widespread in the City at that time. Castleman became his foremost prot&eacute;g&eacute;. The year of the creation of Hill Samuel also saw another merger&#151;Castleman's marriage on 30 October 1965 to Sarah Victoria Stockdale (1942/3&#150;1979), a secretary, and daughter of Frank Alleyne Stockdale, a county court judge. They had a son and a daughter.<br>
<br>Working on the corporate finance side of the business, Castleman advanced rapidly in the firm. Keith entrusted him with the launch of Hill Samuel Australia, of which he was general manager from 1970 to 1972. (In 1985 it combined with other interests to become Macquarie Bank, one of Australia's leading financial institutions, and Castleman joined the board.) After returning to London in 1972 he was promoted to director in the corporate finance department. In 1976 he became chief executive of the New York office and in 1978 he was dispatched to run the South African subsidiary. Profits grew 60 per cent over the two years he was at the helm in Johannesburg, establishing him as heir-apparent among the younger generation of executives.<br>
<br>Castleman's elevation came sooner than expected. In 1980 Keith abruptly resigned from Hill Samuel, having fallen out with the board over unsanctioned takeover talks with Merrill Lynch, precipitating a reshuffle. Castleman became group chief executive. In the first half of the 1980s under his leadership Hill Samuel's profits quadrupled to &pound;32 million, making it the most profitable of the merchant banks. This performance was achieved by strong cost control and the firm's transformation into a pocket financial conglomerate with five divisions: merchant banking, fund management, employee benefit consultancy, insurance broking, and shipping services.<br>
<br>The mid-1980s saw the deregulation of the UK securities industry in a series of stages, culminating in the &#145;big bang&#146; in October 1986. Relaxation of the rules regarding the ownership of stock exchange firms led to a scramble by merchant and commercial banks to acquire brokers and market makers. Though Castleman recoiled at the prices being paid for securities firms Hill Samuel took a stake in the broker Wood Mackenzie. &#145;We felt that to ignore big bang developments and basically go on as we were would have relegated our investment banking side to the role of a niche player&#146;, he told <span class="italic">The Banker</span>  (Travers, &#145;Castleman interview&#146;). Castleman's strategy was the development of Hill Samuel as a British investment bank with a growing emphasis on the provision of personal financial services, unlike some other City houses that sought to meet the challenge of the Wall Street &#145;bulge bracket&#146; firms in the global capital market, an idea that he described as &#145;lunacy&#146;. In 1987 Hill Samuel was approached about a merger by Union Bank of Switzerland (UBS), which was keen to establish a substantial presence in investment banking in London. Castleman opposed a merger, believing that UBS would jettison the non-banking businesses, and advised against opening discussions with UBS, fearing that it would put the firm &#145;in play&#146;. When the board disagreed he resigned. Within weeks of his departure UBS withdrew from the talks and the foundering firm was bought by the Trustee Savings Bank and later broken up when that bank merged with Lloyds Bank.<br>
<br>Castleman was immediately hired as chief executive of Blue Arrow, a fast-growing employment agency, though he clashed with the chairman and left after only a few months. After a spell as an independent consultant, in 1989 he became chief executive of the transatlantic financial services group Johnson Fry, then from 1991 to 1995 its chairman. Also in 1991 he became an executive director at Standard Chartered, which was undergoing a major restructuring. He handled more than 100 acquisitions and disposals in the 1990s and contributed significantly to the bank's refocusing and substantial increase in profits. He retired from Standard Chartered in 2001, but remained an advisory director. He was also, at various times, chairman of National Investment Holdings, a director of Consolidated Goldfields, and an adviser at UBS Investment Bank, being valued for his extensive international contacts and experience.<br>
<br>Highly competitive and passionate about sport, Castleman was a keen cricketer and ran marathons for charity. Following the death of his first wife, in 1980 he married Caroline Clare Westcott, a South African with whom he had two daughters. The marriage was dissolved in 1990 and on 5 July the same year he married another South African, the 34-year-old Susan Mary (Suzy) Diamond, a dress designer, and daughter of Geoffrey Michael Twycross, farmer; they had a daughter and a son. Castleman lived latterly at Tofte Manor, a seventeenth-century manor house in Sharnbrook, Bedfordshire, with a holiday home in South Africa. He was diagnosed with leukaemia in 2003, but remained active until shortly before his death, on 26 April 2006, at St Anthony's Hospital, North Cheam, Surrey. He was survived by his wife, Suzy, and his six children.<br>
